BALANCE-SHEET of a CONFERENCE
.. IB alance-sheet of a Confe-
rence"-such is the title
under which Le Monde, an
influential French daily, sums
up its impressions of the
Fourth Session of Unesco's General
Conference.
Is it possible-the question is worth
raising-to strike a balance at this
date ? Unesco, and particularly its
legislative body, the General Confe-
rence, has so frequently been engaged
in this kind of self-probing that it has
been ironically cal1ed"an organization
in search of a purpose". Would it
not be better to get on with the work
in hand ? Should one not leave the
striking of balances to the future when
the programme resolutions adopted in
Paris have been translated into the
realities of contemporary life ?
But realities, for men, do not exist
independently of ends. The health of
the spirit, implies a ceaseless self-
interrogation. This much we have
learned in the first years of Unesco's
existence. And we have also learned
that every meeting of men-whether
it be a football match a symphonic
concert or an international conference
- has this in common : it adds up, as
man himself adds up, to more than the
sum of its parts. The balance-sheet
of the Fourth Session can scarcely be
a mathematical one. And the signi-
ficance of a Conference cannot be
found in a mere enumeration of the
matters inscribed on its agenda.
t should be noted, of course, that
a meeting of men, a fortiori a
conference of some fifty nations,
could scarcely address itself more
energetically than did the Fourth
Session, to a given series of practical
tasks. Between September i9th and
October 5the, the delegates examined
and adopted a new budget, involving
important matters of detail and prin-
ciple.
They defined Unesco's position
with respect to the United Nations
Plan for Technical Assistance to
Under-developed Countries. They
discussed and voted on the Director
General's proposals for simplifying
and concentrating the programme of
Unesco, which meant a point-by-point
analysis of projects in every field of
education, science and culture. They
elected six delegates to sit on the Exe-
cutive Board. And they settled such
thorny questions as the extension of
Unesco's work to Germany and Japan.
These and many others, were the
practical tasks of the General Confe-
rence. A detailed account of how
they were handled will be found on
other pages of the Courier. But the
question remains : what is the balance,
how does it all add up ?
The Courier cannot pretend to
give a final answer to this
it question. We have a sugges-
tion, however, and one which proceeds
from the proposition that Unesco must
be, at this stage of its growth,"an
organization in search of a purpose"...
A few days after President E. Ronald
Walker declared the Fourth Session
closed, Unesco held a meeting of
experts on the problem of juvenile
vagrancy. This gathering, which took
place in the Children's Village of Mar-
cinelle, near Charleroi, in Belgium,
focussed the attention of many emi-
nent sociologists and child psycholo-
gists on one of the most moving phe-
nomena of the post-war world. News-
papermen who attended the conference
These expressive hands are those of a very old worker. They have shaped, created and toiled. Now, in the evening
of his line. their owner, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by an adult education campaign against illiteracy, has
experienced the wonder of being able to read and has solved the mystery of writing.

wrote articles vibrant with compassion
and protest. And then, after praising
Unesco for organizing this confron-
station of methods experience and ideas,
one Parisian journal asked : But what
is Unesco going to do ?
The answer, in despite of all irony,
lies in one more reference to our ends.
The Organization has done what it can,
within the limits of its meagre resour-
ces, to expose the anguishing problem
of homeless children. It is doing
what it can to help the experts who are
trying to create conditions in which
these children can become healthy
men and women. And now it'can
only turn to the States which have
solemnly ratified Unesco's Charter,
and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and say to them :
What are you going to do ?'
Seen thus in its proper light, the
meeting at Charleroi confronts
the nations with thei responsi-
bilities. And does not this suggest
a useful way to strike the balance-
sheet of the General Conference ?
Our Charter has now been signed
by fifty sovereign nations. Let the
reader of the Courier, in examining
the decisions of the Fourth Session,
remember : this is what the nations
have decided.
Now what are they going to do ?

### 74131: National Commissions draw blueprint for Florence Meeting

Delegations to Unesco's Fourth
General Conference this year in-
cluded over one hundred repre-
sentatives of permanent or provisional
National Commissions from the 41
countries where they have been
former.
Advantage was therefore taken of
their presence in Paris to hold two
informal meetings for an exchange of
views and information, and these took
place on September 23 and October 4.
under the chairmanship of Professor
Marcel Florkin, vice-chairman of the
Belgian National Commission.
The main subject under discussion
was the important meeting of repre-
sentatives of National Commissions to
be held in connection with Unesco's
Fifth General Conference in Florence,
next year.
The first official meeting of Natio-
nal Commission representatives was
held last November immediately before
the opening of the Beirut Conference
and was attended by members of 28
commissions. The purpose of such ga-
therings is to enable the members of
Unesco's National Cooperating bodies
to become better acquainted with one
another and to exchange ideas and
experience.
At the recent informal discussion it
was decided that a three day meeting
should be held before the opening of
the Florence Conference on May 22,
and that, if necessary, a further meet-
ing could be called before the confe-
rence ended.
Before the representatives considered
in detail the Agenda for the Florence
meeting, a long discussion was held
on a draft resolution proposed by the
Vice-Chairman of the Turkish Natio-
nal Commission, Dr. Tevfik Saglam.
"The Director-General is instruct-
ed to convene in the near future a
meeting composed of a member
from each National Commission or
National Co-operating Body, with a
view to co-ordinating the methods
of work to be applied in common, in
order to ensure that these National
Commissions, in their relations both
with Unesco and with their Govern-
ments, achieve better results."
The essence of the Tarkish proposal
was that a special expert meeting of
National Commissions representatives
of a maximum duration of three weeks
should be held quite separately from
sessions of the General Conference.
While this proposal was received
with great interest, many representa-
tives considered that the problems re-
lating to methods of work of the va-
rious commissions might be more
easily solved by the sending of Secre-
taries of National Commissions to the
headquarters of Unesco for periods of
study and consultation and by the ge-
neral discussion of common problems
at the annual meetings of National
Commissions held in connection with
General Conferences.
It was, moreover, considered imprac-
ticable to hold such a meeting before
the Fifth Session of the General Con-
ference. Finally, it was agreed that
the Secretariat should prepare a do-
cument on the implications of this
proposal for consideration at the Na-
tional Commissions Meeting to be held
in Florence in 1950.
AGENDA FOR FLORENCE
After a lively discussion, the repre-sent tives agreed that the Agenda
for the Florence meeting should
allow opportunities for reports and
discussion on the programme activities
and organization of the various Natio-
nal Commissions.
These subjects would include :
Organization of National Commission
Secretariats and the financial resources
at their disposal for programme acti-
vities ; action taken by Commissions in
response to requests from'the Secreta-
rill ; action taKen on their own ini-
tiative in support of Unesco's program-
me ; areas of activity in which they
may effectively engage ; methods of
work employed. by National Commis-
sions ; decentralization of activities
and relations between National
Commissions and non-governmental
organizations, e. g. Youth Organiza-
tions, Labour Organizations, Universi-
ties, etc.
The meeting would also consider the
report of the Secretariat on action ta-
ken to carry out the decisions of the
Fourth Session of the General Confe-
pence on liaison with National Com-
missions, and the report on the Turkish
proposal.
It was agreed that a Committee
consisting of the representatives of the
United Kingdom, the United States,
France and Belgium, should assist
the Head of the National Commis-
sions Division, in the drawing up of
the final Agenda for the Florence
Meeting, which should later be cir-
culated to all National Commissions.
The representatives at the Florence
Meeting will, therefore, come prepared
to speak with authority on the various
items in the Agenda, since a sufficient
interval of time will have been allowed
to enable National Commissions to
study these questions in detail.
MESSAGE IN ANCIENT GREEK
Relations between National Commis-sions and th  Secretariat, it was
agreed, had been more fruitful
and generally more satisfactory in 1949
than in previous years. Certain sug-
gestions for improvement in liaison
arrangements and on the subject of
documents for National Commissions
were made by the representatives of
Australia and the United Kingdom.

### 74131: National Commissions draw blueprint for Florence Meeting

Central Administrative Services, re-
plying to representatives who had sug-
gested the need for improvement in
the content and distribution of docu-
ments, informed the meeting that a
Committee of Experts on documenta-
tion would meet shortly.
It was hoped, he said, that the find-
ings of the Committee would enable
the Director-General and the Execu-
tive Board to evolve a sound policy for
the future.
The co-operation of the National
Commissions in the distribution of in-
formation documents and publications
of Unesco was essential to the success
of any policy adopted by the Unesco
Secretariat. It was generally agreed
that « a two-way effort>&gt; was required
for the solution of liaison problems.
Before the close of the meeting, Pro-
fessor C. Eustathiades (Greece an-
nounced the creation of the Greek
National Commission for Unesco and
read part of a message addressed in
ancient Greek by the rresident of the
National Commission to the Dlrector-
General of Unesco.

### 74132: One hundred non-governmental organizations now working with UNESCO

ONE HUNDRED
NON-GOVERNMENTAL
ORGANIZATION
NOW WORKING WITH -UNESCO
by Vladimir Hercik, Head, Non-Governmental Organizations Division
LTHOUGH planned
 as"A short busi-ness session", Unes-
co's Fourth General Con-
ference has surpassed
ll previons Conferences
as regards the numbers
of observers sent by in-
ternational non-govern-
mental organizations.
The fact that head-
quarters of most of
these organizations are
located relatively near
to Paris, and some of
them in Paris Itself, does
not wholly explain this
record attendance of sev-.-
enty-n ! ne obervers from Slxty-tnree organ-
izations.
A more significant fact is that the number
of non-governmental Organizations entitled
to send observers to the General Conference
has more than trebled since the Second
Session in Mexico City, to which only
thirty such organizations were invited.
Participation in the General Conference
with a light to speak is one of the basic
privileges granted to organizations with
which Unesco has concluded"consultative
arrangements". On the eve of the Confe-
rence, the Executive Board had approved
18 additional organizations to be included
in this category, thus bringing the total
number to one hundred.
The organizations represented at the
General Conference reflected in a striking
way an amazing variety of interests pursued
by these groups on an international level. A
large majority of them have been In exis-
tence considerably longer than Unesco and
have consequently accumulated invaluable
experience in most fields of Unesco's pro-
gramme.
Apart from specialized, professional bodies
of educators, scientists, artists, architects.
the groups represented included a number
of women's organizations, others concerned
with religious, humanitarian, relief, and
child welfare work, as well as youth, stu-
dents and trade-union groups.
Something for Everyone
fVERY one of these organizations was*L abl  to find in the progr mme th t
Unesco proposed for 1950 at least one, and
often more than oar, activity of particular
interest to its members. Representatives of
several bodies spoke in the commissions on
matters falling within the competence of
their organizations.
The Commission of Official and External
Relations devoted two full sessions to dis-
cussion of relations between Unesco and
ion-governmental organizations. An annual
review was made of all international non-
governmental organizations with which
Unesco maintains official relationship, either
under consultative arrangements, or formal
agreements.
A report has been submitted on more than
thirty contracts concluded in the course of
1949 for a total amount of nearly $200. 000
between Unesco and competent non-govern-
mental organizations for the execution of
specific tasks listed in Unesco's programme,
such as surveys, investigations, bibliogra-
cc The evidence of good will which we have
already received in abundance from these asso-
ciations is most encouraging. Whether it is a
case of calling on the services of experts or mobi-
lizing public opinion, they are ready to help us,
so that there may be grouped around the work
of the Secretariat great numbers of people united
by a common interest, who, In conjunction with
the work of governments, wilt convert Unesco
into a true popular crusade for peace. 
M. Jaime TORRES BODET, in his
Report to the Fourth General Conference
EV
phies, international meetings and various
studies.
Another report gave an account of
grants-in-aid accorded by Unesco to cer-
tain very representative organizations
which are in daily working relations with
Unesco programme departments and
contribute by their activity to the further-
ance of Unesco's objectives. These grants
amounted in 1949 to $320. 000.
The Commission discussed at great length
the question of how to make the co-ope-
ration with non-governmental bodies more
effective. Ii was felt that the time had
come to make a thorough review of the
directives governing Unesco's relationship
with these bodies and in the light of the
experience acquired during the past two
years, to amend and complete the policy
of Unesco in these matters when necessary.
Two-way Help
IT has therefore been decided to give spe-t ei l attention to this probl m at th  next
session of the General Conference in Flo-
rence. A comprehensive report will have to
be prepared for the Florence Conference on
the contribution to the work of Unesco
made by all international organizations
which have been brought into official rela-
tions with Unesco and have received
assistance in any form from the Organi-
zation.
This decision is in line with the policy of
the Economic and Social Council of the
United Nations which is contemplating, for
its forthcoming Tenth Session, a similar
review of its relations with non-governmen-
tal Organizations.
In view of this special item on the agenda,
the next General Conference is likely to
attract at least as large a number of obser-
vers of non-governmental organizations as
the last one. Moreover, by giving its atten-
tion to this matter, the Florence Conference
will be able to realize what valuable
resources may be made available for Unesco
by these bodies representing all sections of
public opinion and manifold forms of volun-
tary effort throughout the world.
It is safe to predict that In its own in.
rest. Unesco will increase and intensify co-
operation with International non-govern-
mental organizations which are in their
daily work bringing about the underlying
community of organized interests without
which no form of international co-operation
can succeed.

### 74133: Budget for 1950 8,000,000 dollars

GENERAL
CONFERENCE
ACCEPTS
COMPROMISE
FIGURE
BUDGET FOR 1950
8OOOOOO DOLLARS
A move by the United
_/\. Kingdom, backed by
several other General
Conference delegations to
apply the"axe"to Unesco's
proposed budget figure for
1950, so as to maintain it at
the 1949 figure of $7, 780, 000
was rejected at the close of a
dramatic discussion before
a special session of Uneseo's-
Programme and Budget Com-
mission on September 29.
Mr David Hardman, Mem-
ber of the British Parliament,
and head of the United
Kingdom delegation, had, up
to this point, led his dele-
gation colleagues in a stre-
nuous fight for economy cuts
in the Budget. He finally
agreed at the close of the
debate, to accept a"target"
figure of $8, 000, 000, proposed
to the conference by Mr
George V. Allen, principal
United States delegate in
place of the'''devaluation-ad-
justed"sum of $8, 170, 000,
submitted by the Director-
General.
An indication that the U. K.
delegation intended to press
for a reduced budget ceiling
was given by Mr Hardman in
an earlier speech to the
Conference.
Quoting a phrase used by
M. Torres Bodet, that Unes-
co's mission was"'both mili-
tant and practical"Mr
Hardman commented"My
delegation feels that being
militant and practical means
concentration : not. through
re-organization necessarily,
but in particular by wielding
the axe and cutting out a lot
of dead wood."
Mr Hardman asked for a
careful examination of the
system of payment of fees,
and said he wondered if pre-
paration by Unesco of forty
million pages of cyclostyled
memorS !, nda and documents
in a year was really neces-
sary.
Needs Not Sole
Criteria
HE also advocated extendeduse of private publishing
houses rather than an
attempt to set up a"grandiose
Unesco, avenue Kleber, pu-
blishing house."For the sake
of concentration he appealed
to delegations to give up
some of their"pet schemes."
Mr Proceso Sebastian (Phi-
lippines) declared that while
he had no quarrel with the
principles enunciated by Mr
Hardman, it must be remem-
bered that Unesco was a
growing concern."It must
grow,"he said,"and we
should not tie the. hands of
the Director-General by not
giving an increase, simply
because we do not want an
increase".
Mr. John B. C. Watkins, of
Canada, who followed the
Philippines delegate, express-
ed the following view :
"Needs alone cannot be ac-
cepted as the solve criteria
for deciding on the extent of
the Unesco programme. The
world's capacity to m e e t
these needs must also be
taken into account". It
was for the conference to
decide, he told delegates,
whether projects already
under way and those still to
be initiated were really a
basic minimum which could
be maintained. He added :
"It would seem that, in the
light of the general interna-
tional situation, it is desirable
to effect substantial econo-
mies, and thereby limit ex-
penditure to a figure which
can more easily be borne by
member states during 1950".
Previously, at a joint meet-
ing of the Programme and
Budget and Official and
External Relations Commis-sion on September 24, M.
Torres Bodet presented
delegates with revised budget
estimates"'in the light of
devaluation measures".
The Director General
stated that, after consultation
with the Executive Board,
and in full agreement with
the Board, investigations
carried out by the Secretariat
showed that a reduction of
$575, 000 might be made to
the total budget figure under
discussion, thus reducing the
increase over the 1949 Budget
from $968, 000 to $393, 000.
Delegations had the Direc-
tor-General's report before
them until the *'key"discus-
sion on the Budget ceiling
took place at the meetings
of the Programme and
Budget Commission on Sep-
tember 29.
Dr. Tara Chand, of India,
then opened the discussion by
requesting delegates to ac-
cept the adjusted Budget
figure submitted by the
Director-General, amounting
to $8, 170, 000. He was sup-
ported by Dr. Portuondo
(Cuba), M. Bidault (France),
M. Verniers (Belgium), M.
Photiades (G r e e c e) and
Count Jacini (Italy).
Mr. Hardman intervened
after the Cuban delegate,
with a United Kingdom pro-
posal that the former ceiling
of $7, 780, 000 should be
maintained for the year 1950.
"The National Commission of
the United Kingdom,"he
said,"has studied each item
of the programme and has
come to the conclusion that
the former ceiling should be
maintained during the coming
year."
His proposal was supported
by several other delegations.
"prestige 01 Unesco
Not At Stake"
DR. VAN ZYL, of SouthAfrica, said :"The pres-
tige of Unesco is not at stake,
but the fact must be consi-
dered that all over the world
nations are having difficulties
in balancing their Budgets.
It will be a very delicate
matter to go back home and
say that more money must be
contributed to U n e s c o"
"The proposed ceiling of
$8. 170. 000 really means an
increase of more than one
million dollars."he added.
Dr. Alf Sommerfelt of
Norway, backed the United
Kingdom proposal and said :
"My position is motivated by
economic difficulties now

being experienced by a num-
ber of countries."
Mr George Allen, head of
the United States delegation,
here provided the turning
point in the debate."I feel,"
he told delegates,"it win be
best not to fix a ceiling, but
rather a target figure which
the approximate total might
be expected to come to.
"I propose that the Com-
mission should send instruc-
tions to the Drafting and Co-
ordination Sub-Committee
that the target figure should
be $8, 000, 000."
This new proposal had
support from M. Jean Piaget,
of Switzerland, and was
agreed to by Mr Watkins, of
Canada, with the qualifica-
tion that the sub-committee
would be very careful in its
consideration of the appro-
priation of each item.
When Dr. Chand expressed
acceptance of the American
figure, delegates turned
expectantly to the United
Kingdom delegation. Mr
Hardman said he regretted
"that he could not accept
the terms"presented by
iVI r A II e n."'While fully
agreeing"he explained"that
the proposed programme is
most exðellent, my conclusion
is based on the complete dis-
cussion which has been held
by the National Commission
of the United Kingdom, and
on a full consideration of the
Budgetary implications by
those who would be obligated
to request the appropriation
of funds."
The Chairman of the Com-
mission, Professor Carneiro,
of Brazil, called for a vote
on the United Kingdom pro-
position. It was rejected
by 23 votes to 7.
J. S. Compromise
Accepted
p ROFESSOR CARNEIRO thenput the United States re-
commendation. As the dele-
gates raised their hands to
vote they saw that the United
Kingdom delegation and the
other supporters of Mr Hard-
man's recommendation hacì
waived their opposition to
join in the unanimous appro-
val accorded by the Commis-
sion to the $8. 000, 000 figure
proposed by Mr George
Allen.
With the fixing of the
Budget figure, there remained
only a number of technical
discussions in sub-committee
before the final vote was
taken at the last Plenary
meeting.
Sir John Maud, of the
United Kingdom, while
joining in the general support
of the $8, 000, 000 figure at the
last Plenary session, added'
"I think we ought not, at a
conference, too hurriedly to
assume that there are not
disadvantages in, on future
occasions, fixing a Budget
figure, and not proceeding
towards a Budget figure by
stages, the first of which is to
decide provisionally on a cei-
ling... In our experience
during the past three years,
we do not think that there
are distinct advantages in
starting with a ceiling."
Sir John suggested that in
future years, on the lines of
the House of Commons Public
Accounts Committee, before
the Conference assembled,
there might be some small
Commission of government
representatives who would
look at Budget proposals, not
from the point of view of
policy, but with a view to
seeing whether all the pro-
posed expenditure was justi-
fiable from an economic point
of view.
The Chairman put the
resolution to the Conference
and the Budget discussion
had ended.

### 74134: Les chapitres du budget

AT the Beirut Conference the Unesco Budget ( veiling o for 1949 was first fixed at 8, 000, 000 dollars,and finally reduced to $7, 780, 000. This year, delegates voted down a United Kingdom proposal
for retaining last year's figure, and accepted a United States « target » figure of 8, 000, 000 dollars
for 1950.
This accepted total is to embrace the most important and urgent of the projects submitted to the Fourth
Session of the General Conference.
The Programme Budget for the Departments of Unesco is distributed, in order of size of appropria-

### 74136: UNESCO clears the way for Florence

"BALANCE SHEET
. of the
CONFERENCE/I
1
SEVENTEEN days after
the opening of the Fourth
Session of Unesco'  Gene-
ral Conference on Septem-
ber 19, delegates, hard at work
in plenary sessions and com-
mittee rooms, had reviewed the
current Unesco programme
and that for 1950, established
the budget"ceiling"of the
Organization at 8 8, 000, 000 and
also prepared the way for the
Fifth General Conference, to
be held in Florence next May.
On the afternoon of Octo-
ber 5, Dr. E. Ronald Walker,
head of the Australian delega-
tion, and Chairman of the
Fourth Session, rapped his pre-
sidential gavel on the desk
before him in the main confe-
rence hall at Unesco House for
the last time. He said"Je
declare close la Quatrieme Con-
ference Générale de I'Unesco".
Dr. Walker, speaking in
French, had just made a busi-
nesslike and friendly conclu-
ding speech to the 47 delegates
in draft, for final consideration
by the plenary sessions.
Four large-scale modern tra-
gedies were brought home to
delegates at a meeting of the
Programme and Budget Com-
mission on December 24 in a
discussion on what Unesco
could do to help victims of the
Ecuador earthquake, the child
refugees in Greece and the
Middle East, and to aid the
people of war-stricken China.
Subsequent appeals by the
Director-General, recommen-
dations of the Executive Board,
various statements by local
delegates describing the tragic
state of present conditions in
their countries, were heard
and discussed in commission,
sub-commission, and plenary
session.
At the close of the confe-
rence, four important resolu-
tions were approved, thus
expressing in practical terms
the urgent desire by all dele-
gations to help.
Delegates to the Fourth General Conference
packed public gallery, the
three-power motion for rejec-
tion was again turned down,
this time by 35 votes to 4,
Israel joining in opposition
and Mexico abstaining.
A Brazilian proposal, desi-
gned to strengthen the hand
of the Executive Board in Ger-
many, and to bring together
the allied powers for promo-
tion of Unesco work there,
was carried and incorporated
in the Executive Board pro-
gramme for Germany for 1950.
The animated debate ended
with a vigorous protest by
Mr P. Ogradzinski (Poland) on
behalf of his own and the
Czechoslovakian and Hunga-
rian delegations, against the
adopted resolution.

the dollar.
(A report on the Budget
debate appears on page 3,)
By the opening of the second
week of the Conference, the
delegates of the 47 nations, in
commission, sub-commission or
committee were deeply immer-
sed in the hard work of
shaping, for ultimate appro-
val by the concluding plenary
session, the technically com-
plex programme of Unesco's
educational, scientific and
cultural projects.
On Monday, September 26,
the Programme and Budget
Commission adopted the re-
mainder of the Education
budget, and the entire Natural
Science budget. At the same
meeting Dr. Hugo D. Barba-
gelata (Uruguay) confirmed his
government's readiness to bear
the entire cost of a Seminar
to be held next in Monte-
video, on Primary Education
problems in Latin America.
During these discussions
Dr. G. Zook (United states)
sought assurances that Unes-
'co's provisions for war-handi-
capped children adequately
covered all handicapped chil-
dren, and the Chinese delega-
tion asked for the creation of
two more Field Science Co-ope-
ration Offices in China. The
Israeli delegation requested
and received assurances that
its government could co-ope-
rate with Unesco Middle East
office in Cairo.
'International Interest"is strikingly expressed in this picture
of delegates and visitors examining Unesco publications at
the special stand set up in Unesco House, during the GeneralConference.
of Unesco's fifty member states
represented at the fifteenth
and closing session of this
Unesco"Business Meeting"
conference.
His review of the tasks ac-
complished was loudly applau-
ded by the 49 member states"shareholders"in Unesco, the
observers from interested non-
member countries, and the rep-
resentatives of associated non-
governmental organizations.
Looking back, the delegates
had cause for satisfaction at
the results achieved during the
previous 17 days.
After the opening meetings
of the conference, as reported
in the last issue of the Courier,
several main issues had emer-
ged. There was a general de-
mand for closer concentration
of Unesco's programme. There
was unanimity on the question
of Unesco making an all-out
effort to participate in the
United Nations plan for Tech-
nical Assistance to Underdeve-
loped Countries, and on the. resolutions concerned with 
welfare of the young, with
special emphasis on help for
the refugee children of Greece
and the Middle East.
Another encouraging fact
. was the staunch support ac-. corded M. Torres Bodet in his
plea for the development of- Unesco National Commissions
in Member States.
With the end of the sixth
plenary meeting on September
22, much of the work of the
conference was transferred to
committees or commissions.
It was, therefore, during these
meetings that many of the
thorny problems of the confe-
rence were thrashed out.
Most important of these
working parties was the Pro-
gramme and Budget Commis-
sion which held all its meet-
ings in the big hall used for
plenary meetings. It was, in
fact, a committee of the whole
conference, at which the exist-
ing programme, plans for the
future, and the Budget were
sifted, criticised, and approved
These final resolutions called
on Unesco to :-
Co-operate actively with the
United Nations and other Spe-
cialized Agencies concerned
with victims of the recent
earthquake in Ecuador, and to
address an appeal to donor
organizations towards meeting
these needs.
Appeal to governments, Na-
tional Commissions and Inter-
national Organizations to
secure aid in education, science
and culture, additional to that
already given by Unesco, for
refugees driven from their
homes in the Middle East.
Appeal, on the same basis,
for assistance to refugee Greek
children, and to open and ad-
minister a special fund for
this purpose.
Establish a special China
Reconstruction Fund, out of
unused funds allocated by the
Executive Board for emergency
aid to China in 1949, parti-
cularly for assistance to child
and student refugees.
Unesco in Germany
and Japan
AT a joint meeting of theProgramme and Budget
Commission and Official
and External Relations Com-
mission on September 24, the
delegations of Poland, Czecho-
slovakia. and Hungary, made
it clear they were opposed to
the Unesco programme for
Germany. They stated forci-
bly that they were against the
inclusion of Germany in Unes-
co's. activities, so long as
Germany was split in two.
Later, when the matter came
to a vote and their rejection
plea was defeated by 25 votes
to 3. all three delegations left
the meeting as a protest.

The joint commissions had
reviewed at the same meeting
Unesco plans for Japan, and
turned down a Philippines
amendment, which would have
barred Japanese experts from
attending Unesco-convened
meetings, until the Allied
powers had signed a peace
treaty with Japan. Forwarded
to the plenary session, the
Japanese programme of Unes-
co was also endorsed.
An important part of the
business of the joint commis-
sions on September 24 was the
announcement by M. Torres
Bodet that a decrease in the
Unesco Budget had been made
possible by the devaluation of
Delegates to the Adminis-
trative Commission session of
September 26 heard the audi-
tors report that the finances
of Unesco were satisfactory,
but a committee was set up to
discuss arrears in contribution
payments of certain member
states.
At the next day's meeting
of this commission a generous
gesture was made by the Uni-
ted States delegation which
announced that it would not
press for the full reduction of
the United States contribution
to Unesco, as originally plan-
ned. This was folfowed by an
important statement reitera-
ting United States Government
policy on the American contri-
bution of two-thirds towards
non-local costs of Unesco acti-
vities in connection with the
Technical Assistance p r o-
gramme.
The debate at the Pro-
gramme and Budget Commis-
sion session of September 28
on Cultural Activities produced
a proposal from the Israel
representative that Unesco
should organize in 1950 appro-
priate celebrations to mark the
bi-centenary of Johann Sebas-
tian Bach. A representative
of the Director-General replied
that plans for this were al-
ready under discussion, but
further suggestions would be
welcome.
Miss Myrna Loy, the film
actress, and active member of
the U. S. delegation, told the
meeting :"There seems to be
a very general idea that
Unesco is difficult to interpret.
It is my belief that it would
not be difficult to interpret
Unesco once the interpreters
had been enlisted", This sta-
tement drew applause, as
did the later comment of Sir
John Maud of the United
Kingdom that his delegation
would like to include a famous
film star among its members
next year. Miss Loy had also
assured the conference of film
world's interest in Unesco.
Spanish As Third
Unesco Language
M LEOPOLD Sedar Seng-<I hor, French delegate,Senegalese representa-
tive in the French Parlia-
ment, and author of the
French Constitution, added, in
this connection, the view that
Unesco could produce an im-
portant contribution to films,
but he warned the organiza-
tion against substituting itself
f () r a censorship.
September 29 was notable for
the liveliness of its debates.
Outstanding was the discussion
leading up to provisional fixa-
tion of the Unesco 1950 Budget
"ceiling"at 88, 000. 000 (dealt
with on page 3). In the
Procedure Commission the
chief delegate for Mexico,
M. Antonio Castro Leal, was
leading his Latin American
colleagues into an animated
discussion, urging the intro-
duction of Spanish as a third
working language of Unesco.
Even voting of 11-11 on this
issue threw the Commission
into deadlock, but later confe-
rence developments resulted in
the Mexican resolution being
accepted for further discussion
at the Florence conference.
A United States delegation
proposal this day aimed at the
setting up of a Unesco Head-
quarters Commission, with the
objective of arranging perma-
nent headquarters in Paris for
Unesco, was welcomed by most
delegations as a possible means
of whittling down present high
maintenance costs of the Orga-
nization. At the final plenary
session of the conference the
American plan was handed
over to a seven-nation ways
and means commission.
The following day the Chair-
man of the Executive Board
announced the Board's appro-
val of Ceylon's application for
membership. There were
cheers from delegates when
the official observer from the
prospective 51st member state
of Unesco, Mr L. J. de S.
Seneviratne, thanked the
conference from the rostrum.

Busiest week of an energetic
fortnight ended on Saturday,
October 1, with unanimous
agreement of the delegations to
the recommendation that the
F i f t h General Conference
should take place in Florence
in May next year.
After the heat of the debate
on Unesco activities in Germa-
ny which occupied most of the
Twelfth and Thirteenth ple-
nary sessions of October 4, and
the"winding-up"sessions of
the various commissions and
committees, delegates went
into the final Fifteenth ple-
nary meeting on the afternoon
of October 5, with the most
important work of the confe-
rence ahead of them-appro-
val of the Programme and
Budget Commission Report.
But there was no serious op-
position to any of the many
resolutions, fixing Unesco's im-
mensely detailed programme
and budget, carefully presented
to the conference by the Rap-
porteur of the Commission,
Mr W. D. Pile (United King-

This vital work accompli-
shed, the conference went on
to adopt the non-programme
resolutions, after listening to
the texts of appeals for Middle

refugee children, and speeches,
in support of these appeals
from Professor Carneiro of
Brazil, Professor Photiades of
Greece, and Mgr. Jean Maroun
of the Lebanon.
With the acceptance of the
ApRI'opriation Resolution for
1950 the Director-General
requested heads of dele-
gations to intervene with their
National Commission and go-
vernments in order to facili-
tate the work of the Executive
Board in revising the pro-
gramme. He was referring to
an amendment, proposed by
Mr Luther Evans (U. S.), sup-
ported by the French delega-
tion, and agreed to by the
Conference, that the Director-
General should be exempted
from the requirements to re-
port to the Fifth Session on
any matter which in the Exe-
cutives Board's judgment was
not urgent.
The conference adopted the
report of the Sub-committee
for Technical Assistance, with
the addition of an Australian
amendment, providing for
maximum consultation on the
project between Unesco and
international scientific unions
and established scientific bo-
dies throughout the world.
Signifying the approval of
delegates was the applause for
the Director-General when he
suggested amending a proposal
by Professor Louis Verniers
(Belgium) for publication of
all M. Torres Bodet's speeches
for Unesco, to include only the
more important. The propo-
sal and amendment were ac-
cepted.
Tribute To
José Clemente
Orozco
MARS. Gladys Tillett (UnitedStates) then suggested
that the Director-Ge-
neral and the Executive Board
should, in conjunction with
United Nations, consider the
services Unesco could render to
bring about greater under-
standing of the Convention
against Genocide.
A eulogy from Mr David
Hardman (United Kingdom)
on the Mexican painter, J06é
Clemente Orozco, was acknow-
ledged with tributes to the
artist from M. Torres Boëlet
and M. Antonio Castro Leal.
Mr Hardman had asked that
Unesco associate itself in the
tribute to the painter, whose
death, he said, was a great loss
to the world of art. The con-
ference supported this request.
Business of the 17-day Busi-
ness : meeting of Unesco ended
that afternoon with the pas-
sing by 32 votes to 3 of an
amendment to Article 9 of the
Organization's Constitution,
depriving of voting powers any
Member State with two years
contributions unpaid.
It fell upon M. Leo Munde-
leer (Belgium) and M. Jean
Sarrailh (France) to thank
Dr. Walker, the Director Gene-
ral and the Secretariat for
their efforts on behalf of the
conference, and for Dr. Walker
to sum up that work before
bidding his conference col-
leagues au revoir until next
May, in Florence.
During the General Conference many of the delegates visited the studio in Unesco House to
record their impressions of the work being done. These recordings, as well as others made
during the plenary sessions, were then flown to all parts of the world for use by broadcasting
stations.

### 74137: United Nations Day, 24 October

United Nations Day-24 October
r ACH year. United Nations Day becomes more and
more a truly international festival, an occasion on
which people gather together in every part of
the world to voice their longing for peace.
It capital cities, provincial towns and in the coun-
tryside, men and women of all races and creeds meet to
celebrate the birth of the United Nations Organization
and to affirm their belief in its future.
IN PARIS, this year, important ceremonies brought
together many distinguished Frenchmen and women to
take part in the various celebrations arranged by the
United Nations Information Centre. Those attending
a reception at the Paris Hotel de Yille heard a speech
from M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco, in which he outlined the purposes of the United
Nations and described Unesco's important contribution
to its work of peace.
In addition to a formal gathering in the great amphi-
theatre of the Sorbonne, the press, radio, cinemas and
many of the Paris theatres all collaborated in honouring
United Nations Day.
IN THE ARGENTINE, important ceremonies, in
which educational institutions of all kinds were particu-
larly prominent, were organized at Buenos Aires.
THE PRESS IN COPENHAGEN published special
articles, and all Danish radio stations broadcast
feature programmes which included educational and cul-
tural subjects.
THE BRITISH fOREIGN OffiCE, the Ministry of
Education, the Specialized Agencies and non-govern-
mental organizations arranged a United Nations Week
in Great Britain, covering London and the rest of the
country../.. ..,. "
IN INDIA there was a happy coincidence in the fact
that United Nations Day fell on the same day as the
< : Divani  or < (Festival of Slight)), a great Indian
fraditional holiday. Local authorities there organized
many joint ceremonies to honour the two occasions.
AUSTRALIA, which had established a National
Committee for United Nations Day, marked the anniver-
sary with ceremonies in big cities and remote township
throughout the country.
IN THE UNITED STATES, a National Committee was
responsible for a big programme of commemoration held
simultaneously in the forty-eight States. An address
by President Truman and proclamations by all State
Governors were widely disseminated with the help of
3. 500 local authorities. Tens of thousands of posters
were displayed and hundreds of thousands of leaflets
distributed.
Thus, all over the world, with the growing support of
more and more peoples, the custom is being established
of setting aside October 24 as the day for spreading
the aims and ideals of the Uniied Nations. In years
to come this symbolic day will become for future gene-
rations the Festival of Nations.

### 74140: Dans le coeur d'un homme on peut trouver tous les hommes

M. Georges BIDAULT
(Head of French
. Delegation)
THE unity of the world has become a
necessity and the small communities must
make he e for  to merge into the single
community, for henceforth everything is on a large
scale and universal.
This means that a new duty for the State has
come into being. It has not only to consider its own
people ; it must consider all, even if only for thesarety or us own people.
It is not so easy, and it is not self-evident in advance that a person
who knows a foreign country will be friendly-disposed towards it. In
some cases, this is so. In others, the reverse is true. Knowledge may
be converted into love, but equally, ignorance may be nearer to love
than knowledge. Nevertheless, ignorance becomes love only through
ignorance, and love based on knowledge is always preferable to the
ether. Thus, when all is said and done, Montaigne was right : it is
necessary for us all, assembled here from so many different countries,
to try to know one another ; it is perhaps more difficult to love each
other when we know each other, but love without knowledge is a less
hardy growth. It is, in any case, essential to understand and, if need
be, to allow tolerance. Not all differences between countries deserve
to be calmly accepted, but neither do they deserve to be rejected. We
have to try to bring out the likenesses between our peoples.
When Giraudoux sent his Suzanne across the Pacific, he made her
a little poem, which I venture to read to you only because he is the
author of it..'What have you seen on your travels in Rome, Vienna,
Bergamo and Calcutta ?"asked Spencer's wüe."Nothing,"he said.
"If you wish to discover the world, Rosamond, close your eyes."That
is Giraudoux. But the gentle Joubert put the idea in almost the same
words, in a maxim which, like all good maxims, has been entirely
forgotten, when he said :"'Close your eyes and you will see."
Man exists in all men, and that is one thing which I think Unesco
might proclaim : that differences are not fundamental and that all
men can be found in the mind and heart of every man.

The idea for Unesco to hold a discussion o/this Aind. coinciding M) tth
the General Conferences. was proposed by the French delegation at last
year's Conferences. in Beirut.
One purpose of the debate was to broaden the scope of the Conference
by bringing the public, as it were,'"inside", and the interest shown in the
discussions, which took place at the Maison de la Chimie, in Paris, on
September, 27, 28 and 29, gave ample proof of its success and emphasized
the significance of the subject being debated.
Each evening, three eminent personalities from among the members of
delegations to the General Conference, presented their points of view on
the following question :"What are the duties of the Sta (e in regard to
education, science and culture four the purpose of ensuring a better under-
standing between peoples, and what practical steps should be taken to
discharge those duties ?" Following these speeches, five or six"debaters"
from different countrtes, took part in a discussion on the views that had
been expressed.
In addition to associating the general public more directly with the
activities of the General Conference, the debate helped to define the
prospects open to Unesco in the present day world.
This hope was expressed by M. Torres Bodet,. Director-General of
Unesco, in his report to the General Conference in which he said :
"The very existence of Unesco shows that States, bearing an immense
responsibility, have felt the desire to break the vicious circle of the
old struggles for power in order to accept in full measure their duty
towards humanity.
"We may therefore hope that the discussion will allow us to decide on
a more accurate conception of the economic, social, political and legal
functions in relation to spiritual considerations."

cannot enforce law, if there is not a community that wants to obey
it. If there is not an integral community the police power is effective
only upon a recalcitrant minority, and it is a significant thing that
behind the very power of a state there is not merely law and its police
power, but the authority of the community itself, its willing and
implicit acceptance of certain standards of justice. The community
comes first. We cannot create a world community by law, we cannot
create it by police force. ! We can create it only by the gradual growth
of mutual forbearance within this multi-coloured world society.
Now, we must not claim too much for this process, we must not
claim that the process of cultural co-operation can obviate the
necessities of political arbitration. There are particular kinds of
friction in any community, even in national communities, where the
particular problem of cultural interchange stops. This becomes a
matter for the police or for the courts. There can be tragic situations
in the world community, where we can maintain peace only by the
preponderance of power on the part of those who want peace, as
against those who would break it. I am not afraid to throw this idea,
which belongs to the very stuff of our common contemporary life,
into the idealism of Unesco. We may be at such a moment now,
and we must not pretend that we have particular spiritual forces
which will lift us above this tragic situation. We must not be too
cynical either, if we say that we will maintain peace by the pre-
ponderance of power of those who want peace.

... Academic freedom I am sorry to have to mention as a separate
heading, because I should have hoped that it might be taken for
granted. Any State or any university which demands that its
teachers should accept, or that they should reject, the doctrines of
Marx or of Thomas Aquinas or of anybody else from Confucius to
Stalin, is failing in its elementary duty, and cannot be admitted tothe comity of the world of learning. The battle for academic freedom
was long and arduous ; in the nineteenth century it seemed to be won.
Now, alas, it is explicitly repudiated over a large part of the earth's
surface, and is in danger of being forgotten in many other parts,
though not, I hope as yet, in Western Europe. Its importance, r
believes, is greater in our age than at any former time.
... There should be in as many universities as possible an international
club. These clubs should form a network, and every member of one
of them should receive the hospitality of any other during any au-
thorized period abroad.
... The main stress in history should be on world history, treated-
as for instance, in lWel1s'''Outline of History"-in a manner to
exhibit the collective development of mankind, and to make wars
appear foolish rather than glorious. I do not mean that there should
be a dull and colourless neutrality, still less a concealment of things
discreditable to this or that country. What I mean is that the
emphasis should be on humanity in general, not on any one nation,
and on collective achievements rather than on the virtue or prowess
of one's own country.
I do not, of course, deny children must learn more of the history
of their own country than of that of others countries, but it should
be taught in an international setting, and not made to seem more
important than other history.
... 1 suggest that, in place of the national flag, schools should display
an international nag. And in place of the national anthem they
should be taught to sing a new international anthem.
IWOUld like to say to begin with, that I consider
this a matter of thp very greatest importance,
in the long run the possibility of peace depends
upon the existence of friendly feelings between
nations more than upon any other one factor, but
in the creation of such feelings education must play
a major part.

By drawing the attention of Member States to
the duty of creating and fostering better
understanding between the peoples, Unesco
has induced us to raise the question of human
solidarity in a novel and striking fashion at our
Conferences. The Organization has asked us to
look into our consciences and to reflect on this
sense of solidarity, seeking the most effective means
of carrying into practice tne sprit wmcn msplI'es tne urgamzatIOn

of so-called people's government the power is in actual fact con-
centrated in the hands of a small group.
In our eastern democracies the decisive influence is held bv the
people and we know very well that our people want peace. We are
trying with all means at our disposal to show to our people that they
are not alone in this peaceful endeavour, but that they have the
support of millions of people from countries of East and West. and
that there is a longing for peace in North and South, East and West
alike. This longing for peace is the only common denominator of
the most divergent sections of mankind. We are daily working for
the intellectual and moral solidarity of men. In this respect our
endeavours are in full accord with the Preamble of Unesco which
reads :.'thai a peace based exclusively upon the political and eco-
nomic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could
secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of
the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not
to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind".

save in his own country."But this scientific fraternity in its various
forms-exchanges of teachers, student fellowships and the inter-
national recruitment of scientific staff-can have no influence (or
very little) on the growth of a sense of unity in public opinion, unless
the creation of an international public opinion is brought about by
other means.
This sense of solidarity and understanding is indeed already found in
statesmen, philosophers, sociologists, scientists, writers and artists who
are well acquainted with the present-day world. These men feel as
true members of humanity, they are conscious of the interdependence
of mankind, and they can derive happiness, comfort and hope from a
fine and noble action or a scientific discovery, wherever it may take
place. They are tragically and agonisingly afflicted at the idea of
those catastrophes, near at hand or far away, which, if they occur,
will not be local or national but general and universal, like those
foreshadowed in the Apocalypse.
This state of mind and sensibility, which are still confined to a few,
must be developed in all human beings, by giving them access to the
great currents 01 information and opening their hearts to the emotions
of all mankind. That is the duty of the State which Unesco has
asked us to define and hopes to see carried out in practice.

I contend that international education, mass
Education, the education of youth, is a task
hat Unesco must emb rk on and must be
able to demand of States, and is no more than a
Copernican revolution in intellectual and moral
attitudes in every field of spiritual life. And that
is why the problem of international education
which I was asked to speak of tonight is such adifficult one, infinitely more SO than is generally supposed. This
education entails a total change in the instinctive attitude of the mind,
a complete reversal of instinctive egocentricity and socio-centricity in
the direction of reciprocity.
00'zit is quite hopeless to depend on specialized education for the
building up of world-mindedness if the other branches of education do
not inculcate a sense of the solidarity and interdependence of peoples.
I am thinking of history lessons. Provided history is not regarded
simply as the story of kings and of battles, but, as is generally accepted
today, a history of civilizations, their coincidence or lack of coincidence
in time and their interdependence-then nothing can be of greater
help to the development of an international sense. The teaching of
geography seems particularly designed to rid us of the egocentric
illusions I have mentioned. The teaching of languages and of litera-
ture can help us to read the soul of foreign nations. In the teaching
of science, the close interdependence of research and discoveries, and
their striking international character, proceeding simultaneously in.
different countries, with repercussions from one country to another,
and also the interdependence of techniques-these are all fields that
illustrate this solidarity.
... Our generation has known only gropings and setbacks in inter-
national life and that is not a stimulating example for the generations
to come. International teaching and the introduction to international
life must therefore be based on careful study of the complexities of
the problem.

standing and enduring peace, we must clear up
these misunderstandings and remove these weapons from individuals
and nations. That is what I mean by mental disarmament-a form
of disarmament which, when clearly comprehended and carried out
will necessarily create among the peoples the mental attitude of
tolerance without which no understanding, no spirit of equity, peace
and justice could truly come into being.
... The sincerity and goodwill of States-small and great, weak and
strong-are necessary conditions for moral disarmament.
The foregoing will show that in future, the States must no longer
confine themselves to bringing about this disarmament, the mental
tolerance among the members of their respective communities ; they
must work for that end on an international scale.
... The most important of the scientific reforms we should undertake
is probably the establishment of an independent institute where, in
addition to lectures and courses on general history, geography, li-
erature, general sociology in relation to education, scientific research
on international relations could be carried out These institution : : :
could also be used as a meeting place for teachers and scholars
interested in these subjects and particularly in social science.

religion, political party, trade union and many more. The sociological
conception which I wish to put before you is this : this sum of inter-
mingled groups, serving both to unite individuals whilst at the sam
time separating them from their fellows I propose to designate by the
term social symbiosis.
The term'symbiosis'is borrowed from natural sciences and it
signifies that social groups of differing and frequently conflicting types
are agreed not only to exist side by side but, normally, also to help
one another.
... Many advocate the formation of a single strong unified group to
which all other groups would be more or less directly subordinate8
Their theory is that humanity must pass from the stage of social
symbiosis to that of a single social group based, if necessary, on force.
What we must realize, however, is that the chief aim of all these
groups is to perpetuate themselves. Any of the desires made manifest
to unite with other groups is inspired, not by the desire to merge, to
lose their identity in the whole ; on the contrary, they desire to
confirm and prolong their existence. It is thus clearly the duty of all
those who understand the need and the desirability of a society
comprising plural groups to work for the organization of social sym-
biosis. The aim is not to eliminate different groups but to make them
more mutually compatible : antagonisms and rivalries cannot be
entirely eradicated but their probability can be lessened, they can be
reduced to tolerable limits, even made to act as a stimulus.
But, ladies and gentlemen, you will doubtless anticipate my words ;
there is an inner logic which moves faster than I can speak :"What
then is Unesco ? Basically surely it is a manifestation of a sym-
biosis, an organ designed to bring about that plurality of group
which constitutes social symbiosis."
WEare faced with the real character of social
reality ; society is composed, neither simply

### 74148: A Sightless soldier works for the blind

A SIGHTLESS
SOLDIERI
WORKS
for the
BLIND
THE problem of educating and assisting millions of blindj persons, especially those in Asia and Africa, should be
greatly reduced through a plan approved by Unesco's
Fourth General Conference, last month.
After considering a report on the problems caused by the
diversity of Braille alphabets in use in different parts of the
world, the conference decided that Unesco should study the
world Braille situation and, with the advice of a committee
of experts who are due to meet this month, call an international
conference in 1950 for the purpose of reaching agreement on
the standardization of Braille methods.
The conference would comprise representatives from 18 or
19 countries, representing each of the main Braille groups, who
would try to establish certain international principles which would
allow the greatest degree of uniformity in Braille and would
improve its rationalization and develop its extension.
The article below describes the preliminary work already
carried out for Unesco in this field by Sir Clutha MacKenzie,
of New Zealand, who, since he was blinded in the first World
War, has devoted his life to helping the blind.
By Daniel BEHRMAN
The world's population ofblind persons is great
enough to make up a
city rivalling New York, Lon-
don or Shanghai in size.
An estimated 7, 000, 000 men,
women and children on five
continents either are totally
blind or unable to see enough
to obtain a normal education
or normal employment.
Only two centuries ago, a
vast majority of them would
have spent their lives shut off
by a wall of darkness from
nearly all human relation-
ships. A sightless person,
before the beginnings of
blind welfare activity, lived
as a charge upon his family...
or scraped his existence out
of whatever he could earn as
a beggar.
<&lt;The blind long to have a
normal place-not to be
unwanted, miserable people
on the edge bf society.
Through history, there are
many blind persons who have
taken leading places as poets,
musicians, philosophers and
statesmen, but even the most
humble of the blind yearns
to find a way of ending the
monotony of long hours in
the darkness. >&gt;
These are the aims of the
blind, as summed up by one
of the world's leading blind
welfare workers, Sir Clutha
MacKenzie, now at Unesco
House in Paris to study the
problem of setting up a
single international system of
Braille symbols for the bld
in all nations.
Sir Clutha was totally
blinded himself in 1915 by a
shell during the Gallipoli
campaign of World War I
while serving with the New
Zealand Expeditionary Force.
He then became one of the
first students at St. Dunstan's
Hostel for Blinded Soldiers,
Sailors and Airmen, founded
in London in 1915. From St.
Dunstan's, he returned to
duty and edited the New
Zealanders'army newspaper
in Europe, occasionally acting
as his own front-line repor-
ter. Once the war ended, he
entered the field of blind
welfare and it has become
his life's work.

of the British War Office
in 1942 to take charge
of rehabilitating and res-
settling the war blind of
Southeastern Asia. It was in
India that he first ran up
against the tragic confusion
in Braille systems.
<&lt;In o e training centre for
blind soldiers near the Hima-
layan foothills of Northern
India, Sir Clutha recalled,
<&lt; eighteen mother tongues
were spoken. 
There are from five to eight
Braille systems extant for
each of Asia's three princi-
pal linguistic areas-China,
India and the Persi-Arabic
nations.
<&lt;The result is that the
education and cultural deve-
lopment of the blind have
suffered. There are not suffi-
cient readers of any one
Braille system in Asia to
make Braille printing econo-
mically possible, and there
always is the danger that a
book may become obsolete
overnight through an admi-
nistrative decision changing
the Braille system in use ,
Sir Clutha explained.
He has been surveying
these differences in Braille
systems for Unesco and his
reports were presented to
the Unesco General Confe-
rence in Paris last month.

### 74149: Has UNESCO anything to declare?

Is there anything to declare ?In future, when parcels of
books bought under the
Unesco book coupon scheme
are being examined at frontiers,
the answer to this question will
be plainly shown on the parcels
themselves.
To save the time and trouble
of the customs men, and the
buyer at the receiving end, it
has been decided that the par-
cels shall carry a special label
bringing them to the notice of
the customs authorities in dif-
ferent countries. This decision
was taken pt a meeting of
experts on the Book Coupon
scheme, held at Unesco House
from 4 to 6 October, which
made a thorough study of
results of the scheme since its
inception in December 1948.
The new <Please hurry it
through the customs » tag is one
small move in the general
policy of Unesco, aimed at
securing abolition of present
restrictions on free movement
of books and scientific and
educational material. Govern-
ments are to be approached by
the organization, with a request
that they reduce to the mini-
mum customs and other forma-
lities in respect of parcels and
packets bearing the Unesco
Book Coupon label.
With facts and figures before
them of the immense success of
the Coupon Scheme in many
countries, the experts had hoped
to bring into action an exten-
sion of the scheme to embrace
purchases abroad of scientific
material and educational films.
Examination proved that the
projected widening of the
scheme could not be achieved
immediately, and that any hasty
move might compromise the
future of the scheme.
The idea was not dropped.
Unesco will, very soon, be
convening two separate corm.
mittees of experts responsible
for working out proposals for
extending Unesco Book Cou-
pons to scientific equipment and
educational films. The principle
of this extension has already
been accepted by many dealers
in science equipment and films,
in France, the United States,
United Kingdom, Sweden and
other countries.
Demand exceeds
Supply
Most encouraging news beforethe Unesco House experts
was that a total of Coupons
worth $250, 000 has been issued
by Unesco in ten months. But
the demand greatly exceeds the
financial resources which Unesco
can at present place at the dis-
posal of buyers.
France, which has so far been
allocated 20, 000 dollars'worth
of Coupons, thinks that she
could dispose or Coupons up to
$150, 000. Czechoslovakia up to
now has used 50, 000 dollars
worth, and is asking for Coupons
totalling $ 240, 000. India has
received Coupons for $15, 000,
and is now estimating her an-
nual needs at $200, 000.

### 74148: A Sightless soldier works for the blind

A lJNIVERSAI.. SCRIPS.
Sir Clutha believes that thetask of unifying Braill
systems, while a tedious
and complicated one, can be
successfully tackled. <&lt;The
blind, by being in possession
of Braille, are a good lap
ahead of sighted people-we
have a universal script, >&gt; he
said.
Braille consists of 63 sym-
bols, based on the Roman
alphabet because the system's
founder, Louis Braille, was a
Frenchman. Most letters in
the Roman alphabet can be
correlated with Oriental lan-
guages, such as <&lt;kh>&gt; or
<&lt; ch, » which can be given
related Braille symbols. Spe-
cial sounds, like variants of
<&lt; s : Þ and <&lt; Z : Þ in Persi-Arabic
languages, call for linking
with their own linguistic
families.
Since its invention in 1829,
Braille has been adopted in
a standardized form by
nearly all of the western
world. It was transmitted to
Asia, however, mainly by
missionaries and teachers
who worked in remote areas
where they were unaware of
what was going on elsewhere
and often made their own
modifications. The result is
the situation which Sir Clu-
tha is trying to clear up.
ASIA'S BLIND
In his office in Paris, hetalks eag rly about blind
welfare work and his own
task of modifying Braille.
He was knighted for his
work with the blind in New
Zealand. There still is much
to be done, however, espe-
cially in Asia where more
than half of the world's
blind population is to be
found.
<&lt; The aim of blind wel-
fare, r Sir Clutha summed
up, <&lt; is to give to the blind
the same general opportu-
nities for a full life as are
provided for sighted people. 

### 74149: Has UNESCO anything to declare?

From some of the other coun-
tries to which Unesco had allo-
cated $56, 000 worth of free
Coupons came welcome expres-
sions of wishes to join the
Coupon Scheme. Israel has just
enrolled as a member, and
Belgium, Italy and Burma will
be joining shortly.
The object of the Unesco
Book Coupon Scheme is gene-
rally well known. It is to help
cultural bodies and private
persons to overcome currency
and other difficulties. Since the
war these barriers have made it
almost impossible for some
countries to obtain books from
abroad, particularly from hard
currency areas. The Book Cou-
pon is a kind of international
currency for the purchase of
books, issued by Unesco, and
guaranteed by its own reserves
of hard currency.
Final target of Unesco is
destruction of all restrictions on
the free circulation of indis-
pensable media of culture.

### 74150: Integration is keynote of UNESCO's 1950 education programme

ONE of the most encour-
aging developments of
Un e s c o's Education
Programme for 1950
is the growing cohesion be-
tween its different parts.
The experience of the last
two years has greatly assisted
the clarification of the Depart-
ment's work and this, more
than ever, is reflected in the
progress being made in
carrying out the programme.
In general, the whole edu-
cation programme has been
built around three fundamen-
tal aims :
the interchange of expe-
rience between individuals
and organizations as well as
between States ;the raising of the world's
education standard ;
and the promotion of in-
ternational understanding.
The main task of the Educa-
tion Department is to act as
a centre of exchange between
the different parts of the
world which are doing into-
resting and useful education
work, and those parts desirous
of knowing the results.
This so-called clearing house
function is, however, not
merely mechanical. It is a
matter of judging what is
good education and what it is
desirable to help to spread.
Under this category, the ma-
jor activities for 1950 will
include :
(a) the development of a centre
of educational documentation.
Materials on the specially signif-
icant contributions of each coun-
try to educational theory and
practice will be collected and ana-
lyzed.
(b) publication of a world hand-
book of educational systems in-
cluding statistics. The work was
started in 1949 and will be conti-
nued through 1950. When com-
pleted, it will form an important
source of reference.
(c) Publication of a series of
monographs on current educatio-
nal topics of practical interest to
Member States. One of the first
to be published will be on school
buildings, in which different types
of school architecture suitable to
varied conditions will be fully
described.
(d) Continued collaboration with
the International Bureau of Edu-
cation, firstly to arrange the 13th
Annual Conference on Public Edu-
cation ; and secondly to study the
problems involved in making free
compulsory primary education
more nearly universal and of lon-
ger duration throughout the
world, with a view to submitting
the result to a meeting of Minis-
ters of Education, which it is hop-
ed to arrange at a future date.
Attacking Ignorance
And Illiteracy
THE second important task
of the Department will
be concerned with Funda-
mental Education. It is a
recognized fact that no one
can be an informed and res
ponsible citizen of the modern
world without a certain mi-
nimum of education, nor
without it can he achieve his
full development as a human
being.
In many countries, low and
uneven standards of education
are intimately connected with
poverty, ill-health, inefficient
methods of agricultural pro-
duction and poor social orga-
nization. If : nations are Wi-
dely separated by differences
of educational'standard, it is
certainly difficult for them to
understand one another.
Unesco considers it, there-
fore, its duty to launch a
world-wide attack on igno-
rance and illiteracy, aiming at
the eventual realization of a
minimum standard of educa-
tion for all peoples in all coun-
tries. This work represents a
common problem for both fun-
damental education and adult
education. Consequently in
1950, attempts will be made
to fuse the activities of fun-
damental and adult education
as far as possible.
Much useful work of this
kind has already been done in
many parts of the world. But
each country has been acting
more or less independently and
often in ignorance of what
other countries are doing.

E. Beeby, was born at Neufchâtel in Switzerland In 1896. He
holds the chairs of Psychology and Sociology at the Universities of
Geneva and Lausanne and is in charge of the University Institute
of Educational Sciences. His many books on child psychology,
translated into several languages, have made him internationally
famous, and he has been honoured with degrees from the Universities
of Harvard, Brussels, and Paris. Recently, he was made a Professor
honoris causa of the University of Rio de Janeiro.
Besides his psychological investigations, Professor Piaget has done
valuable work in the field of internatitonal education. As Head of
the International Bureau of Education in Geneva for the last twenty
years, be has been particularly well placed for studying the interna-
tional aspects of educational questions.
Professor Piaget has been associated with Unesco's work from the beginning. He attended
the Constitutive Conference of 1945 in London as observer for the International Bureau of Edu-
cation, and in 1947 he gave a course of lectures at the Sevres Seminar. Recently, he represented
th, e Dil'ector-General at Unesco at the Seminar on Literary and Adult Education in Rio de Ja-
neiro. He is also President of the Swiss National Commission for Uneseo.
As head of the Swiss delegation to the Forth Session of the General Conference of Unesco,
Professor Piaget was elected Vice-Chairman of the Programme and Budget Commission, and took
an important part in the discussion of the general pollcy of the Organization.

### 74152: Dr. Beeby: an appreciation

Dr BEEB-
AN APPRECIATION
f IGHTEEN months may
seem a short time in
*** which to leave one's mark
on an Organization, but it is
nearly half the present lifetime
of Unesco, and in saying
good-bye last month to Dr. C. E.
Beeby, who has been Assistant
Director-General for Education
since April 1948, delegates to
the General Conference, his
friends and colleagues on the
Secretariat, all realized with
something of a shock how
much his contribution to
Unesco would be missed in
future.An implacable enemy of
vague and woolly phrases, of
verbosity and lack of precision,
of any attempt to disguise litt-
le things with big pretentious
Dr. C. E. Beeby (on left) Unesco's Assistant-Director General for Educa-
tion. shortly before he left Unesco to return to his post as Director of
Education for New Zealand. With Dr. Beeby is Dr. Cheng Chi-Pao, who
wrote the article which appears on this page.
words, he expected of his staff
in the Education Department
the same high standards of
clear, logical thought and hard
work which he always showed
himself.
Under his leadership,
Unesco's educational p r o-
gramme has become integrated
and the members of the De-
partment have become a team
of colleagues who can see the
relationship of their own work
with that of the Department
as a whole.
His conception of Unesco's
clearing house function in
education is now bearing fruit
and Unesco's educational
missions have, since Dr. Bee-
by's arrival, developed into one
of the Organization's most
valuable methods of placing
the knowledge and experience
of other countries at the dis-
posal of the States who have
need of them. He, too, has
been responsible to a very
large extent for the plans that
Unesco has presented for the
help which it can give to the
provision of technical assist-
ance to under-developed coun-
tries.
But even more than his
work, for the foundations that
he has laid will remain,
Unesco will miss Dr. Beeby
personally. His friendliness,
his quick wit and love of
absurdity his complete lack of
pomposity, and his frankness
and courage, will be missed as
much as his wisdom and his
stimulating belief in the value
of the work that Unesco can
do.

### 74150: Integration is keynote of UNESCO's 1950 education programme

Hence there is a genuine need
for Unesco to act as a clear-
ing house of information
about Fundamental Education,
to experiment with new
techniques, to provide expert
advice and to help train
people for work in this field.
Among the major projects
under Fundamental Educa-
tion for 1950 will be :
(1) The development of or
system of associated proJects
and agencies. Many impor-
tant works and experiments
are being carried out in d ://e-
rent parts of the world : the
cultural mission in Mexico ; co-
operatives in China ; the basic
education movement in India ;
school broadcasting in the
United Kingdom ; literacy
campaign in Thailand ; and
Village Institutes in Turkey
are but a few of such exam-
ples. Unesco can do a useful
job by linking them together to
facilitate eTch. ange o/eipe-
riences and information likely
to be of mutual benefit to aM.
(2) The continuation of the
Pilot Project in Haiti. This
Project, initiated in 1947 has
met many di ! ! iculties, but has
also achieved striking results.
We will continue our effort to
employ the technical means
within the field of Fundamen-
tal Education to develop the
Marbial Valley, where the pro-
ject is located, to test and
develop new techniques in
Fundamental Education, so
that other localities requiring
such educational development
can have a source of informa-
tion based on experienc. e.
(3) The establishment and
operation of a regional train-
ing and production centre.
Fundamental Education is still
a comparatively new and un-
organized field. There is need
for both personnel and mate-
rivals. We need to train per-
sonnel for the specific task
embodied in the field of Fun-
damental Education, and we
need to produce the necessary
materials in the form of books
and audio-visual aids, such
as films, filmstrips, posters,
etc. A training and produc-
tion centre four the prepara-
tion of new educational mate-
rials and the training of about
40 students during a seven-
month period is planned for
1950.
Four Ways To
Understanding
LASTLY, all the projects inthe education programme
are concerned with deve-
loping international under-
standing. The projects which
have the most direct bearing
on this development are group-
ed together under the special
heading of Education for
International Understanding.
These important activities in-
clude :
(1) Assistance to Member
States in teaching about the
United Nations and its Spe-
ciahzed Agencies, and the
organization of centres to ex-
periment with materials pre-
pared by United Nations and
Unesco as a result o/the
Seminar on Teaching about
the United Nations ;
(2) The preparation and dis-
tribution of educational aids
to teachers, such as hand-
books on teaching of geogra-
phy and history, and the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human
Rights.
(3) The preparation of a se-
ries of pamphlets tor youth
organizations and the publics-
tion of periodical bulletina on
the international activities off
youth and student organiza-
tions ; and
(4) The completion or the
international study of success-
ful methods employed in diffe.
rent countries to overcome the
barriers to universal educa-
tion ;
The study of textbooks of
the different countries is one
of the main features of this
branch of the Department's
work. During 1949, a model
plan by which each country
can analyze its own textbooks
as aids to international under-
standing was prepared. This
has now been sent to all
Unesco Member States with
the suggestion that they exa-
mine their own textbooks from
the point of view of their prob-
able effects on world under-
standing. Unesco has no
power to force any country
to make changes in its text-
books. But it is expected that
as a result of making surveys
of their own textbooks, many
countries will themselves
decide that some revision of
the books is desirable.
Linking Up
The Peoples
IN this conection, the De-partment finds it extre-
mely useful to bring people
with similar interests together
thus effecting across frontiers
a functional link-up between
peoples. Here, the organiza-
tion of missions and seminars
plays an important part. The
consultative education mission
is the most direct method of
bringing to bear on the pro-
blems of one country the accu-
mulated experiences of a num-
ber of others. The internatio-
nal seminar constitutes one of
Unesco's most useful con-
tributions to the interchange
of educational experiences and
the fostering of international
understanding.
In 1950, three missions have
been provided for, and they
are at the disposal of any
Member State which cares to
ask for them. Two internatio-
nal seminars, one on teach
ing of Geography as an aid
to international understand-
ing planned to take place
in Canada, and one on impro-
vement of textbooks, particu-
larly history textbooks, to
take place in Belgium, are
already being prepared.
A third seminar on adult
education, as a result of the
Elsinore conference on Adult
Education, will be organized,
and will probably take place
in Austria in the summer
of 1950.
There are two remaining
items in the educational pro-
gramme which should be men-
tioned. One is the work with
universities. Following the
Universities Conference m
Utrecht in 1948, a Universities
Bureau was created, and as
soon as the Bureau gets into
full operation it will take over
much of the work concerned
with Universities formerly
carried on by the Education
Department.
The other is the work with
war-handicapped children.
Four years after the war, it is
becoming increasingly difficult
to separate the problems of
war-handicapped children
from those of handicapped
children in general. Conse-
quently, starting in 1950, this
project will have to be broad-
ened to include studies of all
types of handicapped children.
As in 1949. it will confine its
activities to publishing reports
so as to create a wider under-
standing of the problems, and
to co-operating with national
and international organiza-
tions engaged in similar work.

### 74154: Experts review educational interchange programmes

-UNESCO'S meeting of experts on
exchange of persons which was
held recently, in Paris, provided
an opportunity for exchanges of views
and news on cultural policies and
marked a stage in the further develop-
ment of international co-ordination of
exchange of persons programmes.
Unesco's annual Handbook on in-
ternational fellowships and related
opportunities was recognized as an im-
portant tool in this field and sug-
gestions for expanding and improving
its publication and distribution were
made.
The experts also recommended that
Unesco assist countries which offer
fellowships and receive foreign students
with technical advice, continue its sta-
tistical information on the international
movement of students and define fields
of study in which fellowships are re-
quired.
Furthermore, countries engaged in
sending large numbers of their natio-
nals for overseas training requested
Unesco's help in developing techni-
ques for analytical study in the country
of its needs for overseas scientific and
educational training and the provision
of periodic information on outstanding
facilities for study of specific subjects
available in various countries. These
suggestions, it was felt, would not only
promote additional fellowship opportu-
nities but would also rationalize and
co-ordinate existing programmes.
Expert discussion also centred
around certain specialized interchange
programmes. I reviewing the
Unesco survey of young people's
exchanges, the group suggested that
national Commissions and sponsoring
organizations should use teachers,
youth leaders and mass media material
in preparing young people for their tra-
vel abroad, that Unesco's efforts to
co-ordinate and publicise information
on exchange programmes should be
widened and an information manual to
facilitate young peoples'exchanges
should be published.
It was also suggested that
Unesco call a meeting of youth
experts in 1951 to carry forward co-
ordination and expansion of efforts.
In discussing worker's educational
and training exchange programmes, it
was felt that the close collaboration
between the International Labour Of-
fice and Unesco in publicising pro-
grammes in the Unesco Handbook
and promoting further exchanges
should be continued. Existing sche-
mes tor the exchange of primary and
secondary school teachers were review-
ed and Unesco's initial efforts in
this field were commended.
BREAKING
THE BARRIERS
:'-n HE experts discussed the deve-
lopment of techniques for deter-
mining the success of program-
mes in promoting international under-
standing. The group was sharply di-
vided between those who felt that over
elaborate investigations would not
achieve desired results and those who
wished to evaluate the results of exist-
ing programmes with a minimum of
technical machinery in order to bettel
the administrative procedures of ex-

### 74156: Bari holds a "UNESCO Day"

BARI HOLDS A
:'2 :,',,"UNESCO DAY"
VISITORS to this year's Levant
\/Fair held at Bari, Italy, from
September 10 to 26 were surprised
to see among the exhibition
stands one devoted to the activities of
Unesco.
Encouraged by the success of a simi-
lar exhibition it organized at the Milan
Fair last April, Unesco accepted an
invitation to take part in the Levant
Fair so as to make its aims and acti-
vities better known in Southern Italy
and South Eastern Europe.
A stand, situated in the Gallery of
Nations, was placed at Unesco's dis-
posal and enabled the Bureau of.
Public Information to display illustra-
ted panels, graphs and pamphlets
covering the different aspects of
Unesco's work and its practical achie-
vements in education, culture, science
and reconstruction.
The representatives of the Eastern
Mediterranean States were greatly
interested in the illustrations of
Unesco's work on behalf of the refugee
children of Greece and the Middle
East.
At the suggestion of the organizers
of the Fair, a"Unesco Day"was held,
on 25 September, in the great amphi-
theatre of the Adriatica University.
The Deputy Director of Cultural
Relations at the Italian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, M. Orlandini, sent a
telegram to M. Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, informing him of
the success of this Day, and including
the following passage. :
"Unesco Day has just been cele-
brated in the presence of representa-
tives of the Government, delegations
of several foreign universities, and a
very large public. The Rector of the
University, M. Presta, and the speakers
who followed him emphasized the
great importance of Unesco's aims
and the work it is doing for science,
education and culture in order to
promote understanding between the
peoples and to contribute to a fruitful
and lasting peace".

change schemes. It was decided that
any study of the effects of exchange
programmes should be limited in scope
and related to the practical needs of
programmes.
One of the major problems facing
all administrators in this field is the
many barriers-legal, economic and
academic-which impede, to a greater
or lesser degree, the movement of per-
sons for educational purposes. In sur-
veying this problem, it was agreed that
it was part of a larger problem of bar-
riers to travel faced by all persons and
currently under study by the United
Nations. It was also felt that as the
problem of barriers arose primarily at
the national level it could best be met
by action within member States.
It was urged that Unesco's role in
this field was to define clearly and
make known the various obstacles
which obstruct the movement of per-
sons and to publicise current proposals
by States and groups of States to re-
duce these barriers.

### 74155: UNESCO's exchange of persons programme to be extended in 1950


UNESCO'S EXCHANGE
of
PERSONS PROGRAMME
TO BE EXTENDED
IN 1950
THE Fourth Session of the Gene-ral Conference authorised a
consideml} le increase in the
exchange of persons programme of
Unesco, both with respect to infor-
mation and clearing-houses activities
and in the number of Unesco-finan-
ced fellowships available for the
ycar 1950.
The publication of.'STUDY
All/WAD","olume/, during 1948
and Volume II in November of this
year has provided the basic infor'-
mation for the extension of Uncsco's
planning and advisory services in
the whole field of international
educational exchange.
The first major event in the ex-
tension of this part of the pro-
(Jmmme was a meeting of experts
on fellowships and related problems,
held at Unesco House in September,
attended by individuals fmm four-
teen countries and four United Na-
tions agencies. This group, compo-
sed of administmtors of Cllltuml
relations programmes from five
continent, commended Unesco's
work in the information field, and
urged development of further stu-
dies and advisory services.
UNESCO FELLOWSHIPS

D CRING 1950 a meeting ofexperts will be called, in col-
laboration with the Internat-
ional Labour Office, to discuss
ways of increasing activities in
the field of cultural exchanges
of industrial and agricultural wor-
kers. Later in the yeal', in conner ;-'
tion with the International Bureau
uf Educatiun/Unesco Conference, a
group of experts will discuss ways
of increasing and extending pro-
grammes for the international ex-
change of teachers.
Special efforts will be made
during 1950 also to extend Unesco's
current cnquiries into or'ganizations
and pr'ogr'arnmes promoting the

### 74157: Pattern of UNESCO's reconstruction work for 1950

THE over-all pattern of
Unesco Reconstruction
programme for 1950,
as approved by the
Fourth General Conference,
follows much the same line. s
as that of 1949. But it is
an enlarged pattern,
bringing in more areas
where reconstruction is
badly needed.
The emphasis is gradually
shifting from the mechani-
cal fulfilment of emergency
requirements, and with
greatly limited resources, to
the marshalling of public
endeavour and goodwill for
the further alleviation of
educational, scientific and
cultural needs.

Unesco Secretariat and

The chief reconstruction
function of Unesco rests in
the stimulation and chan-
neling of the immeasurable
fund of goodwill existing in

widening its scope of res-
ponsibility, is the Emer-
gency Action resolution
agreed to by the Conference.
This instructed the Director
General to take action to
assist in meeting educatio-
nal, scientific and cultural
needs, not only of victims
of war, but of several other
modern tragedies.
This decision to widen the
range of the reconstruction
activities was hastened by
the recent earthquake disas-
ter in Ecuador. To help the
victims of this catastrophe,
Unesco, acting on another
resolve of the conference,
will co-operate with United
Nations and other Speciali-
zed Agencies concerned with
aiding these stricken people,
and will address an appeal
to donor organizations to
contribute towards meeting
their needs. These include
gifts of books. for the libra-
ries of Quito, teaching
equipment for schools, and

money grants for intellec-
tual reconstruction in Ecua-
dor.
Unesco will also handle
two special appeals the
Conference decided to make
to governments, national
commissions, and interna-
t i o n a I organizations, on
behalf of Greek refugee
children and Middle East
refugees.
Twelve war-hit
countries on aid list
BURMA was designatedby Unesco Executive
Board, at a meeting
held just before the General
Conference, as eligible for
educational reconstruction
aid. This brings the list of
countries in this category to
twelve. The other coun-
tries are :. Austria, China,
Czechoslovakia, G r e e c e,

The kind of direct emer-
gency grants these countries
receive from Unesco is
limited to specific and ur-
gently needed items of
scientific and school equip-
ment, to technical books,
and to museum and musical
supplies. Last year,
Unesco allocated $175. 000
for shipments of this sort to
the eleven countries then
listed. For 1950 a slightly
larger sum will be allocated
among the twelve states
now listed.

structive programme 0 f
The Republic 01 Ecuador, bounded on the West by the Pacific Ocean, with the Andes mountains
running throughout its length, and spreading out in the East as far as the vast Amazon basin,
became an independent state in 1830. Its capital, Quito, was devastated by earthquakes in
1775 and 1797.
On August 5, this year, the town of Ambato the country's fourth largest city, 100 miles from Quito,
was shaken by one of the worst earthquakes in history.
In the space of a few moments, between five and six thousand people were killed and the
exact total of those missing and homeless has not yet been estimated.
A few days after this catastrophe, Mr. Walter H. C. Laves. Assistant Director-General of Unesco,
on behalf of M. Torres Bodet, the Director-General, sent a telegram to the Government of Ecua-
dor. In it, Mr. Laves expressed the"deep sympathy and fellow-feeling"of Unesco for the
people of Ecuador."Our sorrow,"said Mr. Laves,"is based not only on human fraternity
but on the ideals of co-operation which are the'raison d'etre'oi our Organization". Following
this, Unesco's General Conference, at its recent session in Paris, issued a world appeal for help

TWO of the first-line nter-prises of the Department
of Mass Communications-
Technical Needs and the Free
Flow of Information, approved
by the Conference, with slight
modifications, will be carried
on in 1950, as in the past
twelve months.
The Conference had noted
with satisfaction that the
Projects Division of the De-
partment of Mass Communica-
tions is now becoming an
original operation, by which
Unesco is materially increas-
ing the flow of educational
scientific and cultural material
through the world's press,
r&dio and films.
Plans for 1950 will, of
course, embrace extension in
circulation of two important
Mass Communications publica-
tions : Unesco Features and
World Review.
Started in the summer of this
year, Unesco Features appears
fortnightly, contains news if
current international cultural
life, and is distributed to the
world's press, principally in
the provinces and in under-
developed areas.
Unesco world Review, an
older publication than its
contemporary, is published
weekly in three languages :
French, Spanish and English.
It carries radio news and
script material about Unesco's
activities. This radio material
is currently used in 38 count-
ries and territories.
Unesco will, in 1950, extend
to other countries the surveys,
already carried out in certain
countries, covering technical
needs of Press, Radio and
Film. Dissemination of in-
formation about the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
Fundamental Education and
the Food and People project
will be continued and expand-
ed.
Plans for 1950 also include
preparation of a new draft
agreement on the importation
of educational scientific and
cultural material. The new
draft agreement will be based
on a text recommended to
Unesco by the 34 nations
participating in the recent
Annecy Conference of the
Contracting Parties to the
General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. A Committee of
Experts and representatives
of interested governments are
to meet at the invitation of
Unesco to prepare a revised
text which will be submitted
to the Florence Conference
next May.

### 74159: Why we fight

"WHY WE FIGHT."During the War, while the world struggled to
determine it future, the United Nations illustrated their aims in
UM a remarkable film whose titl6 the Courier has taken to express
the peaceful aims of UNESCO, to-day...
The Constitution of UNESCO proclaims the basic aims which deter-
mine its action, and in these pages the Courier is presenting pictorially
the essential themes of this fight for peace in which no cannons speak
- a fight whose outcome is as vital as that of the struggle which ended
in 1945.
The duties incumbent on all men and women in the fight for peace
were recently defined by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco, when he spoke at the United Nations Day ceremony, held at
the Paris City Hall, on October 24.
Below, we publish extracts from this speech.
THE war which has recently wrought such havoc, was a crisis without precedent in
history. Begun in 1914, with an interval more apparent than real of twenty years,
it att ined between 1939 and 1945 such pr portions that we should today feel
no surprise that peace is so difficult to establish, but rather wonder that civilization did
not sink without trace during the storm, and that even before peace has been signed,
the peoples had the wisdom to evolve a law designed to bind them all.
We have barely started to blaze the trail of international co-operation through the
darkness, our hands still stained with blood. We know that the task will be a harsh
one, but we know, too, that there is no work more urgent or worthier of our devotion.
Today all problems are universal ; neither economics, education nor health can any
longer be treated solely on national lines. Mankind has at long last realized this unchal-
lengeable truth : its life is a single whole and its future indivisible. From now on, no
race, no nation, can either owe salvation to, or seek it for, itself alone. For years it was
said that collective security was an impracticable theory. Events have swiftly shown
the fatuity of that assertion. The only security is collective security ; and in our day
collective means world-wide. The temporary check suffered by this principle was due
not to the ideal itself, stated before the war by the League of Nations, but rather to the
dangerous spirit of passivity with which the peoples received it, as though they saw in it
an encouragement to sloth, a pretext for negligence and a premium on irresponsibility.
Peace is only a finer name for work, for daily self-sacrifice. Or if we prefer, it is the
collective name for all occupations and all skills aimed at serving humanity. Peace is
not a rampart, erected once and for all against the forces of evil. Peace is man's dwelling,
which must constantly be rebuilt and strengthened, enlarged, adapted to changing needs,
for as long as man survives and because man survives.
As a result ofthe obstacles against which the United Nations have inevitably stumbled,
the impatient lose hope on finding once again that peace calls for vigilance as stern and
unceasing as in war. In so doing, they discover merely that collective security can never
be a synonym for the collective neglect of duties incumbent on all and on each one.
We must not hesitate to repeat, on every occasion and in whatever words and tones
suit best, that the measure of peace's worth is the degree of freedom and justice which
it secures for the world
We have been shown clearly enough that there is no victory to be won in modern
war ; for the conquered there is suffering and humiliation ; and for the conqueror, suffering
and responsibility.
j
All European wars, said Voltaire, are civil wars. In the twentieth century his formula
applies to the whole earth. In our world, which shrinks progressively as communications
become swifter, all wars are civil wars ; all battles are battles between fellow-citizens,
nay more, between brothers.
... Through the Food and Agriculture Organization they concern themselves with the
needs of a world which must eat to live. Through the International Labour Organization
they co-ordinate endeavours to secure working conditions which are in accord with social
justice. Through the World Health Organization they combat disease and contribute
to bringing health to unhealthy regions. Through UNESCO they endeavour to increase
international understanding by ensuring the spread of education, science and culture.
The work of these Specialized Agencies does not always capture the interest of the
general public as much as it deserves. Usually the newspaper reader does not attach
much importance to an anti-malaria campaign, or to the ratification of a Convention on
Women's Hours of Work, or an agreement on the agricultural resources of Polynesia,
or a pilot project in Fundamental Education in Haiti. He is more concerned with the
political discussions proceeding in the limelight of actuality.
In the final analysis, the most urgent political questions are no more than the conse-
quence of age-long chronic problems, economic and social, ethical and educational, pro-
blems ill-stated and ill-resolved. In every. political issue there lies latent a history, some-
times centuries old, of incalculable and disastrous technical shortcomings.
Undoubtedly, it is of very great importance to decide who is to rule over a particular
area of the earth, for it may happen that such a decision may threaten the peace we need
in order to rebuild a civilization in ruins. But if we take a truly historical view, the most
urgent task is to satisfy the manifold necessities of men, by devoting to that end all the
resources available through international co-operation. Political solutions merely cure
the symptoms ; and they do not always do that much. Economic and social solutions
go to the very roots of the evil.
In the few years of their existence, the several Institutions making up the complex
system of the United Nations have been able to do no more than plot the course they
must follow in the future. let us not grudge them the support they need. let us not
despair of their success, for that would be to despair of humanity itself.
A rule of justice such as the San Francisco Charter offers us, is not born full-fledged
in the moment of its acceptance by the plenipotentiaries of governments, nor even later
when it is ratified by the parliaments of the peoples. Such a rule must be ratified by
every man, at every moment, everywhere and by all his acts.

### 74160: Trygve Lie commends UNESCO's work for Palestine refugees

TRYGVE LIVE, commends UNESCO'S work
attw commendation"for Unes-who's work i  supplying urgent
educational assistance to Arab
children in Middle Eastern refugee
camps, was expressed in a tele-
gram received October 13, at Unesco
Headquarters, from Trygve Lie,
Secretary Genera) of the United
Nations Organization. The telegram,
addressed to Director-General Jaime
Torres Bodet, declares that an Advi-
sory Committee on Palestine Relief
which recently met at Lake Success
has associated'itself with Mr. Lie,
"in expressing warm commendation
for the valuable work being done"
by Unesco in its programme of
urgent aid to Arab children.
Reference was made in Mr. Lie's
message to the thirty-odd Unesco-
sponsored schools which were im-
provised this year with the help of
such organizations as the Internation-
al Red Cross and the American
Friends Service Committee. These
schools, located in Syria, Transjor-
dan, the Lebanon and the Gaza area
for Palestine Refugees
of Palestine, are designed to provide
elementary instruction to homeless
children. Conceived by Unesco as
emergency measures, they are part
of an integrate United Nations cam-
paign to relieve the physical and
moral sufferings of several hundred
thousand victims of the Palestine
war.
Taking note of an appeal for aid
to Arab children refugees issued by
the Fourth Session of L'nesco's
General Conference, the UX Secre-
tary General stated :"The recent
actlons of Unesco's General Confe-
rence, taking cognizance of the si-
tuation of the Palestine refugees are
most gratifying. I trust that existing
cooperative arrangements between
Unesco and field missions of In-
ternational Red Cross Organizations
and the American Friends Service
Committee in their respective areas
of administration can be continued
and strengthened".

PEAL
ON BEHALF OF REFUGEE
CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE EAST
:)'8 General Conference, at its Fourth

ents of Member States, of the National
issions and of international organizations

, modest as it is, is in danger. If further
rapidly forthcoming, Unesco's schools in
East will have to suspend their already
, ctivity. The governments and organiza-
have undertaken the maintenance and
education of these refugees will not be able to meet
all needs unless a big collective effort brings them
immediate relief.
These children cannot be brought up on bread alone.
Like other children, they have the right to learn, to
develop themselves and to grow up into men and
women. Unesco wants to enable them to do so by
providing them, in the camps where they are forced
to live, with the schools, books, materials and teachers
; hey need. And those are what Unesco is asking
for. To condemn these children to ignorance would
be to condemn men and women to despair. If the
world of tomorrow were to be peopled by desperate
souls, it would be doomed to the most atrocious of
wars.
Unesco therefore appeals to its Member States,
the National Commissions and international organiza-
tions to co-operate in a charitable work which is
justified by the most natural of human sentiments as
well as by the duty of constructing more, stable
defences of peace in the minds of men.

### 74161: Appeal on behalf of Greek children

Appeal
THE General Conference of Unescomeeting in plenary session, ur-
gently appeals to the Govern-
ments of Member states, to the
National Commissions and to interna-
tional organizations on behalf of the
340, 000 Greek refugee children froth
the northern provinces at present liv-
ing in makeshift camps or in hastily
requisitioned buildings. They are
without schools, teachers, teaching ma-
terial, clothing, medical attention and
a social and cultural environment cap-
able of meeting their essential needs.
Out of 10, 000 schools, 7, 625 have been
completely destroyed or badly damag-
ed. In the educational field alone
the losses amount to more than 50
million dollars.
Instead of the relief which the end
of the war brought to almost every
country, the situation in Greece today
is worse than during the better years
of 1940-1944. Nine years of incessant
fghting have reduced the children of
this country to an indescribable state
of physical debility and moral dis-
tress. In spite of the ordeals of the
second World War, which have blunt-
ed human sensibilities, we cannot
but be moved at the thought or these
340, 000 children whom it is necessary
to save from ignorance and from re-
volt against an inhuman destiny.
The sense of continuity and of cul-
tural influences needs no rekindling in
regard to Greece, which gave birth to
the art, science and philosophy that
are ours today. All those who share
the advantages of modern civilization
know well what they owe to its Helle-
nic sources.
Resolved to give effective help to the
Greek refugee children. Unesco is-
anxious to find the means necessary
for this work of mercy.
It therefore launches this appeal
with confidence. In the name of civi-
lization as well as of humanity it asks
for a gesture of gratitude and solida-
rity which will help education, science
and culture to flourish once more on
the devastated soil of Greece.
Help for the people of countries devastated by war. One of the most urgent
problems UNESCO is tackling is to help Greek refugee children, like the ones
shown above, driven from their homes by
war.

### 74163: The Question of race and the democratic world

THE QUESTION OAF RACE
AND THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD
by Dr. Arthur RAMOS, Head of Unesco's Social Sciences Department
While endeavouring to make known and understood the Uniyersal Declaration of
Human Rights, UNESCO must also encourage the creation of conditions fayourable to their
application.
One of the important ways it can do this is by fighting against all form of racial pre-
juice-a task which the UN Economic and Social Council has already requested it to
undertake.
It is by seeking and assembling historical scientific data on racial questions, and in
making them widely known, that UNESCO can strike a useful blow in this fight.
Already it is carrying out preliminary inyestigations into present day fallacies concern-
ing racial questions, and the results will be giyen wide publicity.
IN any discussion on the re-
organization of the post-
war world, particular ac-
count must be taken of an-
thropology. No other science
has been so deflected from its
true ends. In its name, whole
nations have resorted to con-
flict, to defend the false ideal
of racial or ethnic supremacy.
It is, therefore, entirely natu-
ral that anthropology, restored
to its proper place and strip-
ped of the myths in which it
had been veiled, should now
deliver its scientific message to
the world.
War is the most serious
example of a lack of balance
in communities. Its causes are
many and complex, but the
form it takes is always strife
between men-peoples, races
and civilizations. Regarded, in
its accepted modern sense, as
the « general science of men »,
anthropology is no longer a
mere descriptive or illustrative
study of the so-called «primi-
tive» peoples, but is, at any
rate for some, a science of
« human relations ».
The objective attempt to es-
tablish the importance of these
variable factors inevitably pro-
duces the normative attitude,
which today is rightly one of
the most essential objects of
what is known as « applied
anthropology ?. This branch of
science, at first merely a tech-
nical means of securing better
treatment for colonial peoples,
is now concerned with the
more far-reaching task of ana-
lyzing and adjusting human
relations.
Before suggesting rules or
measures for correcting and
preventing lack of racial bal-
ance in the world of to-mor-
row, it would be interesting to
turn back for a moment and
take a general look at this
tremendous history of the rela-
tions between peoples and bet-
ween races. The mythology of
racial inequality and superiori-
ty is a very old one. And the
theory 01 the « chosen people ?
INTERNATIONAL ORGANI-
RATION IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCE. The Department
of Social Sciences has begun
quarterly publication of an Inter-
national Social Sciences Bulletin
designed to act as a link be-
tween specialists In different
countries and Unesco, and to
spread knowledge of the activi-
ties of the new international
associations In the Social Scien-
ces : the International Associa-
tion of Economists, the Interna-
tional Association of Compara-
tive Law, the International Poli-
tical Science Association and the
International Association of
Sociology. The formation of an
international association of
social psychology is also planned.
A scheme to co-ordinate the
exchange of social science infor-
mation has been completed and
should make possible an exten-
sion of the services of documen-
tary analysis. In point of fact,
abstracting and blbllographlcal
Index services are channels of
communication essential to any
sciences and more particularly to
those of relatively recent origin.
Lastly, three scholarships for
higher studies have been founded
to assist the advancement of
social sciences in countries where
they have made little headway.

METHODS IN POLITICAL
SCIENCE. The work entitled
"Enquiry into Political Science"
summarizing the present position

years, to be published in French
and English by Unesco at the
end of 1949, will be widely dis-
tributed in all countries.
has always been adopted, at
various periods of history,
when a civilization at its ze-
nith attempted to rationalize
its « ethnocentric)) feelings.
As regards psychological
« grading s, it was Aristotle
who sought to define the diffe-
rences between the free man
and the slave. It was the view
of the Greek philosopher that
those differences did not deri-
ve from the vicissitudes of the
environment or society, but
were in fact « gradings » pres-
cribed by nature. According to
the same train of reasoning,
some « racers » are destined to
command, others to obey.
Grafting
met Culture
THE contrary view of theSophists who maintained
that these inequalities
were merely a man-made
convention, was accepted by
many people, including certain
politicians and generals of
ancient times like Alexander
the Great, who even advocated
intermarriage between the
conquering Greeks and the
barbarians. Christian huma-
nism gave a new turn to this
old dispute by preaching the
doctrine of the fundamental
equality of all human beings.
We have seen that, in hu-
man relations, the"racial"
technique has led to one of
the greatest states of disequili-
brium that exist, namely war.
The present century has paid
tribute in the shape of two
great wars of the European
nations, wars of which there
were many causes ; but one
cause was undoubtedly the
philosophy of racial domina-
tion espoused by several na-
tions.
We see then, in the last
analysis, that racialism is a
direct result of Europeaniza-
tion and imperialism. This is
amply proved by the research
engaged in by contemporary
European sociologists and
anthropologists themselves.
Economic and cultural supre-
macy leads to a feeling of
"ethnocentricity", and this is
rationalized in biological terms
of racial supremacy. Every-
thing, in the last resort, is
reduced to"methods of domi-
nation".
It is on the peoples of
Europe that the results of
having had to accept domina-
tion by the"master races"
have borne most heavily and
disastrously. Cultural disequi-

### 74163: The Question of race and the democratic world

librium has led to processes
whose favoured form today is
the transfer of cultural
characteristics from one group
to another (the"grafting"of
culture). Cedric Dover has
provided us with a masterly
analysis of the half-castes in
India, those types of men who
oscillate between two conflict-
ing kinds of culture. They
are the men whom Park and
Stonequist have described as
"marginal"man, an admir-
able expression meaning indi-
viduals who live on the
borderland of two civiliza-
tions oar. two ethnic groups,
but who fail to attain a
balance between the two.
The studies conducted by
contemporary sociologists and
anthropologists into cultural
contacts, with particular re-
ference to those transfers of
culture between different
groups, reveal all the results
of contacts between two or
more types of culture. As
these authors show us, the
usual results of this state of
things are acceptance, com-
promise and reaction. But in
most cases, despite an appa-
rent, superficial equilibrium,
there is a clash produced by a
reaction against these trans-
fers of culture.
Objective analysis of all the
results of contacts between
races and civilizations has led
some observers to propose
certain steps for safe-guarding
so-called"primitive"peoples
against the various attempts
summarily to impose on them
the methods of the ruler
nations, that is to say, gene-
rally speaking, the European
whites. After the First World
War, British colonial policy
registered some progress by
introducing"indirect rule"
("Gouvernement indirect",
indirekte Vorwaltung).
Applied Social
Anthropology
\Q TRUCK by the demorali-
nation caused by the
breaking up of the tribal
and cultural units, the flight
of the natives, the loosening
of social and political ties, the
Joss of the characteristic
marks of culture, the"disillu-
sioned melancholy"and so
forth, and also by the inevi-
table repercussion of this state
of things on economic output,
the British administrators re-
called many native chiefs who
had been banished from their
territories and reinstated them
as leaders of their former
subjects.
They also tried to recons-
truct, so far as they could, the
aboriginal cultural framework
which was in process of di-
sappearance or dissolution.
This"indirect rule", i. e. rule
exercised through the native
chiefs, was designed to repair
the serious damage previously
caused to the natives'tradi-
tional civilization. And the
seal was set on this policy by
the establishment of institu-
tions which set about trying to
give concrete effect to the li-
beral principles of applied
social anthropology.
Several other nations have,
since the 1914-1918 war.
pursued an enlightened policy
in regard to ethnic minorities.
The work done by the Danes
as regards their Eskimoes
should be mentioned ; anthro-
pologists have, at various
congresses. constantly suggest-
ed steps that should be taken
for the preservation and
defence of the culture of these
Arctic peoples.
In the United States, too,
after many years of vain
effort, the policy of protecting
the Indians seems to have
become more humane and
scientific. Here it is a
question not only of protecting
the Indians'"reserves", but
of respecting the characteris-
tics of their civilization.
material or otherwise ; liberal
protective measures of an
economic kind have even been
taken as regards the inheri-
tance of tribal land that had
formerly been taken from the
natives.
In Brazil, the National Ser-
vice for the Protection of the
Indians, mainly through its
authorized spokesman, General
Rondon, has fought for a
policy of cordial and peaceful
co-operation with the native
masses who are still scattered
throughout the vast area of
the country. The results have
been highly encouraging.
In this humanitarian and
scientific movement in applied
anthropology the religious
missions are making every
effort to co-operate.'
The work accomplished be-
tween the two wars shows us
what lines to follow for the
future. Much, indeed, remains
to be done, and much to be
corrected. The violence of the
last war shows us clearly that
men are still unbalanced. In
many countries, contacts be-
tween groups and castes conti-
nue to be dominated by misun-
derstanding and hostility. In
some, racial antagonism
breaks out in hatred and
violence. Anti-semitism and
anti-negro feeling are still two
disagreeable phenomena. And
in its contacts with so-called
"primitive"peoples, colonial
policy still reveals features
that hark back to the early
days of European exploitation.
One cause of the recent war
was a conftict between racial
castes, brought about by a
false philosophy of racial
supremacy. The first task,
then, will be to correct this
odious frame of mind scientifi-
cally. The working must be
laid bare of that"historical
rationalization", which reach-
ed its zenith in European
racialism, beginning with Go-. bineau and Chamberlain and
ending with Rosenberg. The
ideological battle is just as
important as the military
battle fought by armies.
Disarmament of the mind can
only be achieved through a
reasonable, humane and scien-
tific policy, designed to bring
about harmonious contact
between he different races of
the world.

THIS is the new humanismwe al1 hope ill triumph
in the post-war world. It
involves, not the imposition of
the ways of life and culture by
a. dominant nation but the
democratic view of existence.
Westermann reminds us
that the Ewe of Dahomey,
when speaking of a cherished
friend, say enye amé-"he
is a man". For their enemies,
for egotistical and cruel people
(including Europeans), they
reserve the expression menyé
amé-"he is not a man".
These expressions correspond
to the Latin humanus and
inhumanus, and reveal an
empirical view of human na-
ture. Only those who as Te-
rence says, bring scientific
curiosity to bear on human
affairs, with a generous desire
to help to remove conflicts
between human beings, truly
deserve the name of men.

"IN THE FRONT LINE"
"WE may say that the conception of the network of
Field Science Co-operation Offices is precisely in line
with the intentions of the founders of Unesco.
Science had to be included in the organization because
it affords perhaps the most striking example of the unity
of humanity, and also because the understanding of the world
of nature alone permits its control, and hence the raising of
the standard of life of millions of our fellowmen in those
farflung countries which, perhaps by a series of historical
accidents, have remained underdeveloped.
"In the building of a better world, the fostering of culture
without science and technology would become a mockery ;
and the attempt to spread education without spreading decent
minimum standards of freedom from disease and malnutri-
tion would only lead to a discontent worse, and more justi-
fied, than before.
"Hence the watchword, All Aid to the Scientists and Tech-
nologists in the Front Line ! While not neglecting the due
provision of facilities for the men in the great centres of
science and technology to meet together, to publish, and to
work for the advancement of knowledge, help must urgently
be sent to the less favoured areas.
"whether it is a Chinese engineer building a bridge on the
borders of Mongolia, or a Haitian entomologist studying insect
carriers of disease through the microscope in a tropical grass
hut, or an Arabic successor of al-Razi teaching chemistry to
young Iraquis, these are the men who stand at the invisible
focal points of the advance of civilization.
"These are the men who need, and most fully deserve, all
possible help. The International Science Co-operation Ser-
vice which earlier scientists hoped for, is now in being-let
it not fail for lack of means. *'
These are the concluding paragraphs of a booklet"Science
Liaison, Unesco"describing the Unesco Field Science Co-
operation Offices obtainable from Unesco House.
FORCES TO SERVE MANKIND
A prediction that naturalscience, whose revolu-
tionary advances in l'ecent
years have plunged man-
kind into the maelstrom of
social upheaval, will yet
lead us safely through to fl
bettel'world, was made by
Professor Arthur B.
of Harvard University at
Atlantic City recently.
"With the advance of
science", said Professor
Lamb,"a host of favorable
forces will pperate on may-
kind's behalf : his ever-in-
creasing power ; his wider
and deeper understanding of
his environment, of himself,
and of the social organism ;
his enhanced realization of
the unity of the human fa-
mily ; his heightened intellec-
tual activity resulting fl'om
the eagel'and widespread
prosecution of science ;
and, best of all, the increas-
ing myriads of men and
women with active and train-
ed intellects available to
study the problems of the
m. oment with the enthu-
siasm and objectivity of the
scientists.
"By these means mankind
will master his difficulties
and achieve a richer and
more significant existence.
Our watchword should then
be not to falter but
confidence to redouble ow'
efforts toward the progress
of science,"

members of a Science Club, at work in a laboratory.
In Finland. the universities and technical schools have set an
example, that might well be followed in other countries, by
throwing open their laboratories to members of science clubs.
In a number of countries, faced with a rapid increase in the
school population and a limited number of schools and teachers.
the Science Club movement provides a useful means of easing
the strain on available resources. It is an activity that can be
undertaken very simply and easily as part of the school curricu-
lum, without requiring new equipment or teachers.
Museums provide an important means of presenting scientific information to the masses. Above,
for example, is one of the fascinating exhibits that can be seen in Paris at the famous Palais de
la Découverte. It represents a grain of salt enlarged 400 million times, the chlorine atoms
being shown as dark spheres and the sodium atoms as white ones. M. André Léveilllé,
Director of the Palais de la Découverte, has written a book on « Museums, and the Populariza-
tion of Science", copies of which can be attained from Unesco.

port to Unesco's work on
abstracting, rationalization
and other aspects of scienti-
lìc documentation ; the stan-

lerminology and the mainte-
nance of a scientific appara-
tus information service.
For this purpose it should
obtain the full co-operation
of South African universi-
ties and scientific organiza-
tions. It should keep these
bodies informed and encou-
rage them to affiliate with
international organizations.
'"Through the schools a
programme for the popula-
rization of science and its

### 74166: UNESCO's cultural activities

UNESCO'S CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
Unesco's programme of
cultural activities approved
by the 4th General Confe-
rence is not designed to
break into many new fields, but
at the same time it allows for a
considerable development of exist-
ing activities.
So far as ideologies are concern-
ed, it is not Unesco's task to sug-
gest the imposition of any given
doctrine or belief, still less to claim
the right to impose it. Unesco can
suggest no choice between different
and virtually conflicting ideologies ;
but it must provoke comparisons
and exchanges of ideas, and try to
find occasions and subjects on
which practical collaboration is
possible.
It is therefore essential to main-
tain and promote co-operation
between Unesco and those inter-
national associations which, in
every country, comprise men who
work to enrich and disseminate
culture, whether they be artists,
authors, thinkers, humanists, libra-
rians or curators of museums and
monuments. This form of indirect
action is more necessary in the
cultural than in any other field.
One of the direct activities
planned by Unesco is to ask an
international committee of disting-
uished experts to put the final
touches to the plan for the Scien-
tific and Cultural History of Man-
kind. Once in possession of this
plan, the Member States will be
able to consider it before the Flor-
ence General Conference, and if
they agree, a start can be made in
carrying it out.
Carrying on its work of dissemi-
nating and popularizing the arts, to
which the exhibitions of colour
reproductions have already made a
considerable contribution, Unesco
will arrange next year for the pu-
blication, in several languages, of
an international review of art, This
will be, not a critical or biased
periodical, nor one with an educa-
tional purpose, but an objective.
popular publication designed to
spread among the public a taste
for and a knowledge of the out-
standing works of art of all periods
and all countries. Drafted by the
best available experts and amply
illustrated, it will be published at a
low price for sale through the ordi-
nary commercial channels.

### 74167: Art and education

by
Trevor THOMAS
IN recent years there has been agreat increase of interest in the
part which art can play in educa-
tion, not merely as subjects such
as painting, music, dance or drama in
the school syllabus but as a principal
means towards education. We all need
the arts in our daily lives and they play
a much more important par tin our ge-
neral well-being than many of us rea-use.
Apart from the
ways in which we
decorate our homes,
or choose our
clothes or layout
our gardens, most
of us go the theatre,the cinema, the concert nail, tl1e aance
floor, or even sit at home alongside the
radio, in order to relax from our
regular routine. These are mostly
forms of passive relaxation but is
through the most active forms of
artistic creation that the greatest per-
sonal satisfaction can be found, as
one world-renowned statesman has
recently testified in his war memoirs.
One of the projects which come wit-
hin the framework of Unesco's aim in
promoting international understandingIS concerned with the role of the arts
in general education. It is intended to
find out what is being done by various
people in different parts of the world in
reference to art education, in order to
circulate this information.
Unesco has just published the flrst
issue of a Bulletin entitled « Arts and
Education)) (Publication NO 349) which
in future will be published quarterly as
separate issues in French and in Eng-
lish. In the first issue there is a gene-
ral account of this project, the range of
subjects which it covers.
Towards World Peace
do. Thomas Munro, of the Cleveland. : \Museum of Art, U. S. A., contributes
the main article, an authoritative
account of interchange in the arts as
a means to world peace and of the
place of the arts in education. He
writes that underlying the Unesco pro-
ject is"a belief that the arts can and
should be used as a means to interna-
tional understanding... and to develop
mutual tolerance and friendship". He
advocates that the arts should be used
in a systematic way under some such
administration as that of Unesco, and
points out that it is"not enough to
train and encourage artists themselves,
or even to help circulate their works
among the general public".
Of the other items in this Bulletin,
one of the most stimulating is an ac-
count by M. Marcel Cuvelier, Director-
General of the Brussels Philharmonic
Society, of the creation in Belgium in
1940 and extraordinary subsequent de-
velopment of the movement known as... Jeunesses Musicales"which aims at
encouraging young people to appreciate
and perform good music.
Forbidden by the Germans, this move-
ment carried on clandestinely during
the occupation, spread its influence to
other European countries and North
Africa, and after the war held the first
Congress of the International Federation
of Musical Youth which has now be-
come an annual event with its own
international orchestra of young mu-
simians.
From the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, Mr Victor d'Amico sends an
account of two major activities sponsor-
ed by the Museum in the interests of
art and education. The first is the Com-
mittee on Art Education which is an or-
ganization of teachcers, parents and
students acting as a forum for the ex-
change of ideas through its conferen-
ces. It has workshops and groups for
the discovery and development of
new and improved
methods.
But perhaps it is
the second activity,
the People's Art
Centre, °organizedLO nelp satIsry me
creative needs of the community",
which is of the widest interest because
it provides classes for children and
adults in which they can receive expert
guidance of a practical character.
Schools, institutions and individuals
who want or can provide information
on the arts and education are invited
to communicate with the Programme
Specialist for Arts and Education at
UNESCO House, 19, Avenue K) eber,
Paris-16'.

### 74166: UNESCO's cultural activities

The preservation of historic
monuments and archaeological
sites, including their protection
against the ravages of time and
the dangers of war, raises difficult
technical and financial problems
for many countries. Unesco is,
therefore, trying to bring about
real co-operation between the
various States, through exchanges
of information (for example as
regards methods), the despatch of
expert missions, and the establish-
ment of a special international
fund. Measures will also be sug-
gested with a view to co-ordinating
excavation and ensuring access to
sites.
There can be no world-wide
dissemination of culture without a
free flow of books and publications.
Unesco's international"book cou-
pon"system has produced such
good results that the General Con-
ference has decided to extend it to
other materials like scientific and
educational films. But it is not
enough to facilitate the purchase
of books ; exchanges between libra-
ries, and particularly the interna-
tional lending of publications, must
also be encouraged.
There cannot, moreover, be any
proper circulation of books and
publications unless readers are kept
informed of the important works
that are published in the various
countries. Unesco will try to
encourage the preparation, in each
country, of lists of bibliographies,
and the international co-ordination
of the sciences of bibliography and
documentation, by re-starting, in
particular, the publication of the
Index Bibliographicus.
DELHI PILOT PROJECT
S'SPECIAL attention will also be
paid to the development of
public libraries. For this
purpose Unesco organized, in 1948,
an international seminar for pro-
fessional librarians ; and it was so
successful that the General Confe-
rence decided a second one should
be held in 1950 on the role of public
and school libraries in adult edu-
cation.
Aimed at making Unesco's ac-
tion more direct and concrete, a
pilot project will be carried out at
Delhi, in co-operation with the

### IGNORE

As part of its work to encourage the growth of a popular appreciation
of the arts, Unesco has just published a catalogue containing
informat on on over 400 colour reproductions of paintings.
Because of the difficulties encountered in moving exhibitions
of works of art from one country to another at the present time, most
people are obliged to develop or complete their artistic culture, through
studying reproductions of the original works.
The Unesco catalogue, which lists reproductions of paintings from
1860 to the present time, will be of great help to schools, museums and
other institutions, in choosing good quality reproductions.
In a preface to the catalogue, Jean Cassou, Curator, of the Paris
Modern Art Museum, who helped to choose the reproductions from among
700 in Unesco's archives, writes :"Art is a langWlge which all the
peoples of tJhe world are now learning to speak, and which they are eager
to use in understanding one another. They need to become familiar with
the symbols of this language, and with symbols that lare as close as possible
to t !. he thing expressed, that is to say, to tJhe heart of a masterpiece which
the genius of mam has invested with such vital and pregnant meaning."
A second catalogue of colour reproductions covering paintings prior
to 1860 is being prepared and will be published by Unesco, next year.

### 74166: UNESCO's cultural activities

Government of India, as part of
the literacy campaign undertaken
by the local authorities. The pur-
pose of this project is to provide
persons who have just learned to
read with carefully chosen libraries,
and to assemble the staff required.
The results achieved in the Delhi
area can be applied on a larger
scale and later used in other coun-
tries.,.
As regards Unesco's work in the
field of copyright, preliminary in-
vestigations have convinced the
experts concerned of the need for
a universal convention, to which
all countries could agree. The
principle of such a convention has
now been accepted, as has also the
idea of convoking an international
conference to work out its text.
Member States are shortly to be
consulted in order that their points
of view and policies in this matter
may be ascertained.
MESSAGES FROM GREAT
MEN
THIS very substantial pro-
gramme of cultural activities,
which is taking concrete and
detailed shape as Unesco defines
more closely its purpose and
methods in this particular field of
international collaboration, invol-
ves a considerable number of
publications. Some of these perio-
dicals like the Bulletin for Libra-
ries, Museum, the Copyright Bulle-
tin and the Index Translationum
are part of the normal functioning
of the permanent services of
Unesco as an international centre
of information and exchange.
Others, like the publication on the
Rights of Man and the Scientific
and Cultural History, bring to all
peoples what Unesco has to say on
the subject of peace and interna-
tional understanding.
Others, again, like the recently
published collection of essays on
Goethe or the similar collection
which is being prepared on Balzac,
convey messages from great men
who have been educators of huma-
nity. There are, no doubt, many
ways in which Unesco can deliver
its own message to the world, and
of these, the printed word is one of
the most effective and least ephe-
meral.

### 74168: UNESCO catalogue lists recorded works of Chopin

UNESCO
catalogue lists
recorded works
of CHOPIN
A catalogue, wh1ch constitutes the
first general list of the works of
Frederic C opin i  recorded
form, has just been published by
Unesco and thus coincides with the
tribute paid to the great composer by
Unesco, in the form of a concert of
chamber music. At the concert, which
took place at the Salle Gaveau, in
Paris, on October 3, unpublished works
written by leading contemporary
composers"in homage to Chopin"
were heard for the first time.
The catalogue of Chopin recordings
- it comprises 5, 000-was prepared
under the direction of M. Armand Pa-
nigel and presents full details of each- title, interpreter's name, date of
recording, record number and publish-
ing company.
In the preface to the catalogue,
M Marcel Beaufils, a noted musicolo-
gist and author of several works on
Wagner,. analyses the works of Chopin,
including the very few works which
have not yet been recorded. His in-
formative study makes the catalogue a
valuable reference book both for record
collectors and professional musicians.
Following the Chopin catalogue,
Unesco proposes to make a list of
the recorded works of Western and
Eastern music, and also of ethno-
graphical and folk music. The first to
appear will cover the recorded works
of J. S. Bach and Mozart, the music of
India and China, and the collections
of the National Records Library (Pho-
notheque Nationale) and the Musèe de
I'Homme in Paris.

has said.
Speaking to the Congress on conclusions she

teacher. Dr. Montessori, paraphrasing Unesco's
Constitution, said that"peace as well as war
is horn in tile minds of mcn"and that there-
fore it is within onr own power to establish
the conditions necessary in order that peace
and not war may reign among men.
Listening delegations were well aware of
her tremendous influence in education, and
notably how her inspiration and personal
efforts created children's schools in the rural
areas of Lazio and. lbruzzi in Italy, where the
MARIA MONTESSORI
Do Maria Montessori, who was born at Chiaravalle,near Ancona. Italy. in 1870. began her professional
career as a pioneer ; the first woman in Italy to gra-
duate in medicine, at Rome University, in 1894.
From medicine she turned to the subject of educating
defective children and, working on the lines first laid down
by a French physician. Dr. Sguin, she soon achieved
starting results. She then turned her attention to the edu-
cation of normal children and began, by examining the
various educational systems of Europe.
She was astonished to find the children everywhere
reduced to immobility in the class rooms.'like rows", as
she said,"of butterflies transfixed with a pin". Later, in
her schools, the contrary practice was established.
The methods she developed were finally published in 1912
under the title of"THE MONTESSOR ! METHOD", which
described the work she had carried out in the"Case dei
Bambini", the"Children's Homes"which were set up in
the slum quarters of Rome.
These schools, which were the forerunners of present day
kindergarten schools, became world famous, and the"free
discipline methods she employed began to be adopted in
schools in other countries.

This Congress, to which many distinguished
educationists contributed their views was wi-
dely reported in the Italian press, which also
published many articles on school problems.
The Congress debates also emphasised that
Italian educational traditions are still verb
much alive.
The presence at San Remo of representa-

### 74170: Italy's damaged art treasures are losing their scars

ITALY'S DAM AGE D'A R T
TREASURES ARE LOSING
THE THEIR SCARS
DISCUSSIONS by a group of
experts on the question of
restoring and preserving
historic and artistic sites
and monuments, which took place
at UNESCO House from October
17 to 21, served to highlight the
tremendous restoration problems
resulting from the Second World
War.
Among the questions of war
losses in works of art and monu-
ments discussed at UNESCO
House, those suffered by Italy
received special attention, for
war damage was spread over
almost the whole of the country.
One of the fullest surveys on
this subject,"Works of Art in
Italy-Losses and Survivals of
the War", was published by the
British War Office, in 1946, and
presents interesting facts about
real and apparent losses.
Monte Cassino, for example,
was among the names most often
mentioned in the war communi-
ques and the destruction was
deeply deplored because it was
a famous old centre of culture
and religion.
But many people do not realize
that, long before its destruction.
this monument had l06t most of
the traces of its early Christian
origin. Between the 16th and
18th Centuries the monastery
had been virtually rebuilt and
historians agree that In its
modern form It was of no great
artistic value.
MANUSCRIPTS
ESCAPED BOMBS
ON the other hand, the
r. 1an uscrlpts In the library
. were unique, but these It
was possible to carry into safety
before the bombing began. It IS
evident, therefore, that in esti-
mating the exact extent of
damage to a monument, account
must be taken not only of its
architecture, but also of sculp-
tures, paintings and frescoes, as
though a complete Inventory was
being drawn up.
To take an instance, the partial
destruction of the Church of
Santa Maria della Verità at
Vlterbo would have mattered
comparatively little, were It not
for the unfortunate loss of all
the frescoes of Antonio da
Viterbo. These the Restoration
Institute In Rome has only been
able to re-assemble In part after
very careful work. The restora-
tion of a fresco from often
unrecognizable fragments pre-
sents insuperable difficulties.
Then, there is the case of the
Church of Santa Chiara, the lar-
gest church In Naples.
On 4 August 1943, Incend1a. ry
bombs destroyed the roof and
the interior, charring the
frescoes and many of the tombs
and statues. It was found im-
possible to restore the baroque
interior, as all the 18th Ce : ltury
decoration had disappeared.
There was only one solution :
to rebuild on the basis of the
14th Century structure, bringing
to light more of the edifice which
the fire had partly exposed. This
solution, however, presented many
difficulties, and It was necessary
to sacrifice the stucco pillars and
the cornices of the windows.
because they had no organic
counterpart in the new architec-
tural style of the church.
Other technical problems of
reconstruction concern the mate-
r1a. 1s used In the work. The
roof of the Cathedral at Bolzano
has been rebuilt In reinforced
concrete instead of wood. which
is locally scarce, or was so
when restoration began.
These and other examples
show that It Is Impossible to lay
down hard and fast rules In the
matter of restoration and that
much depends upon the diffe-
rent styles. Gothic or Byzantine,
and upon the mathematical
design of decorations. The latter
can be altogether ruined by the
collapse of an arcade or by the
shifting of the foundations. In
any case, the work to be done
exceeds the present resources at
Italy's disposal.
'LEANING WALL"
OF TREVISO
ANOTHER Instance of difficult-ty in the restoration of old
walls its presented by the
gallery of the Palazzo del Tre-
cento at Trevtso. Here. bomb ex-
plosions had left a large part of
the wall on one side of the gal-
lery leaning 87 cm. out of true.
But for the presence of a
fresco, It would have been easy
to pull down the wall and re-
build it in identical form with
the same kind of materials. It
was, however, thought better to
re-erect the wall piece by piece
with the help of steel ties, care
being taken to reinforce the wall
beforehand with a brick support.
Many countries, including Italy
with its wealth of historical
records, lack the necessary funds
to repair the damage. The re-
construction and protection of
buildings, sculptures and other
art works would call for resour-
ces which are beyond the means
of any single nation.
Accordingly. UNESCO is trying
to make everyone realize that he
or she has a share in the world's
cultural heritage, and, therefore.
an obligation to care for its
reconstruction today and for its
preservation in the future, disre-
garding frontiers and the preJu-
dices which have hitherto pre-
vented a general recognition of
the fact that art is universal.

### 74171: UNESCO's Germany, Japan programmes endorsed by General Conference

-UNESCO'S GERMANY,
JAPAN PROGRAMMES
NDORSED BY
GENERAL CONFERENCE
-UNESCO'S activities in Germany
became one of the big policy
issues of the Fourth Session
of the General Conference,
following a speech on Sep-
tember 20 by M. Jan Boor, delegate for
Czechoslovakia."Sonner or later Ger-
many will have-to find her place as a
member of the community of the Euro-
pean nations", M. Boor told the Confe-
rence."\Ve do not see any other solu-
tion of this painful problem than an
agreement between the Big Four and
the consequent early signing of a peace
treaty with a unified Germany. Once
this is achieved, the function of Unesco
in Germany becomes quite clear".
From then on the delegations of Po-
land, Czecholovakia and Hungary
made it plain, in words and by vote,
that they desired a postponement of
the organization's activities in Germa-
ny.
The case for this delay was based
on the political considerations M. Boor
had already put to the conference, plus
his contention that there had been a
revival of national movements in Ger-
many, which, it was asserted, rendered
Unesco's current and projected pro-
gramme in Germany valueless.
Against this submission the majority
of member states taking part in the
sometimes lively discussion through
commission and plenary session,
strongly supported Unesco policy for
Germany, which aims at strengthening
democratic elements particularly among
young Germans, so that they might
reject Nazism.
It is with this purpose in view, and
with the important final project of
bringing Germany as a partner into the
community of nations always in mind,
that the Organization, has drawn up its
work-plans for Germany.
These include the revision of text-
books for schools, the spreading of
knowledge about Unesco and its pur-
pose, and a variety of projects, in which
Germans themselves will co-operate,
directed at securing a peaceful and
democratic development of cultural
life in Germany.
Bevivøl of Hitlerism.
THE first important debate on
Unesco policy in Germany took
place at a joint meeting of the
Programme and Budget and Of-
ficial and External Relations Commis-
sions on 24 September. A proposal from
M. Fleischmann (Czechoslovakia) to re-
move Unesco's proposed 1950 Ger-
many programme from the agenda was
rejected by the majority.
Immediately, M. Ogrodzinski, Vice-
president of the Polish delegation,
spoke of evidence of a revival of Na-
zism in Germany, and of monuments
erected to the victims of Hitler having
been besmirched."'Under these condi-
tions", he said,.'the campaign of
Unesco becomes useless".
He stressed that the absence of uni-
Oed control in Germany, the creation
of a"pseudo-state"of Western Ger-
many, far from creating an atmosphere
favourable to the work of Unesco, had
led to exploitation of divergences of
opinion with a view to revenge. His
delegation could not then vote in favour
of the proposed programme.
'"two refuse to collaborate with
Messrs. Heuss and Adenauer, whose
names are associated with the memory
of aggressions against Poland, Czecho-
slovakia and Austria", he said,"'will
indicate to the Germans that only the
way of peace will lead them to become
part of a world community. Unesco
Will not be able to work usefully in
Germany until there is a return to
agreement between the four occupying
powers".
Dr. Kruyt (Netherlands) declared
that, after Poland, no country had
suffered as much at the hands of the
Germans as had Holland. He said :
'"The general opinion in my country is
that it is absolutely necessary to re-
educate the German people and it is
Unesco's task to do this". He added
that the Netherlands delegation was
satisfied with the work done by
Unesco in Germany in 1949, and
wished to approve the Director-Gene-
ral's report.
Italy's viewpoint was expressed by
Count Stefano Jacini, who said he
sympathised with the sentiments of the
Polish and Czechoslovakian delegations,
but considered that the activity of
Unesco in Germany would only have
the consequences implied in its pro-
gramme.
The importance attached by Switzer-
land to the activities of Unesco in
Germany was emphasised by M. Zutter,
who described the educational and
cultural interchange his country was
prepared to make with Germany.
Four Power Support
Requester.
R. NIEBUHR of the United Statesdelegation, answering the Polish
delegation's contention that no
work could be accomplished in
Germany without Four Power Accord,
reminded the meeting that the Director-
General had sought Four Power sup-
port.
Unesco had initiated in 1947 and con-
tinued in 1948."In my opinion", he
said,"the re-education of the German
people depends on the re-education of
the occupying powers. Unesco has
been doing its very best to overcome
existing obstacles, to break down bar-
riers and teach German youth to follow
Goethe and Kant. The good work has
begun and must be continued".
Miss Pedersen, of Denmark, informed
delegates that for two years Danish
women's organizations had been in
close contact with German women's
democratic organizations, who repre-
sented 65 per cent of the electorate.
Everyone would understand the impor-
tance of Unesco's co-operation with
those women, an importance which
transcended the question of who was
President of the new German State.
Dr. Vejarano of Colombia, felt that
Unesco's action in Germany was a
vital matter. He could not believe that
the German people, who had contribu-
ted so much to world culture and
Unesco, and the \\"llUlc World, was
seeking to help a very sick nation and
be advocated the usual therapeutic
method of turning to the residual
health of the patient."It is monstrous
to suggest", continued Dr. Niebuhr,
"that Lnesco's programme could aid
the re-birth of nationalism in Germany ;
none of its activities is in any way
likely to do that". It was obvious that
L'nesco s aim was the democratic edu-
cation of the German people, and, the-
refore, he moved that the programme
be adopted.
Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan of In-
dia, seconded Dr. Niebuhr's motion. He
recalled that the proposal before them
was to extend the scope of the work
science, could be impervious to that
action. He emphasised that the demo-
cratic neighbours of Germany favoured
Unesco's programme and approved
the Director-General's report.
Changed German
Situation.
M. FLEISCHMAt'7N of Czechoslo-
vakia then renewed his earlier
demand for the German ques-
tion to be removed from the
agenda. The first results of the Bonn
Constitution had revealed, he said, the
real intellectual state of Germany.
He re-called that the Unesco Com-
mittee of Experts on Germany was in
agreement that the current nature of
the situation in Germany should be
defined, and that it should be recogni-
zed as different from that of the epoch
of the Mexico and Beirut conferences.
They should not precipitate the march
of events, and until new orders had
been made, all decisions concerning
Germany should be made after agree-
ment between the four occupying
powers.
M. Verniers (Belgium) approved the
programme of the Director-General, but
suggested amending the text to throw
into relief the importance of providing
the fullest Unesco documentation for
educators and youth movement leaders
in Germany.
M. Ogrodzinski of Poland, here de-
clared that not a single delegate had
denied the existence in Germany of a
military and nationalist spirit, which
continued to grow. He again under-
lined the necessity for four-power.
accord in Germany before Unesco
could act there.
A compromise was suggested by
M. Perrin of France, in the form of an
amendment calling on German circles,
especially educators : to refrain from
action prejudicial to the principles of
Unesco, and urging them to help
create the atmosphere of international
understanding necessary for develop-
ing the work in Germany of the Organ-
ization.
This brought from M. Gyalmos of
Hungary the comment that progressive
education for democracy was indispen-
sable in Germany, but conditions in that
country, its way of life, the degree of
denaziScation, of minds as well as of
institutions, and its genuine desire for
democracy must be taken into consi-
deration before any action was under-
taken.
Unesco should consider the question
of German unity, the fundamental
condition of peace and human progress.
As German nationalism still existed, he
said, his delegation did not think
Unesco's action opportune and sup-
ported the Polish motion.
The meeting ended on a dramatic
note after the motion for the removal
of the Germany programme from the
agenda, on which the delegations of
Czeclioslovakia, Hungary and Poland
agreed to combine, was put to the vote
and defeated by 25 votes to 3 with
2 abstentions. Shortly afterwards, the
delegations of these three countries rose
and left the meeting.
The United States proposal, made by
Dr. Niebuhr, approving the Director-
General's report on Germany and the
policy to be adopted in 1950 was then
unanimously approved by the remain-
ing delegations with one abstension.
As a result of these decisions new
resolutions were tabled. In the First,
the Czechoslovakian, Polish and Hun-
garian delegations proposed postpone-
ment of the discussion and decision on
Unesco's German Programme until
next year's Conference in Florence.
The second, presented by the Brazi-
lian delegation, proposed the continua-
tion of Unesco's work in Germany,
and called on the Allied Powers to
promote German unity. It also empha-
sised that Unesco could only succeed
in its German activities with German
co-operation, and underlined the impor-
tance of a supervision by Unesco's
Executive Board, of the work under-
taken.
These two resolutions were the focal
points of the debates which took place
at two plenary sessions of the Confe-
rence on October 4. ProfessoI'Vana, of
Czechoslovakia, opened what was to
prove the liveliest discussion of the
conference. Moving the new three-
power resolution, he said the funda-
mental principles on which they could
form their relations with Germany after
the war were expressed clearly and
precisely in the agreements of Yalta
and Potsdam.
"own the proposals now before us",
he continued,"we must ask ourselves
varous questions. Has the moment, of
which we spoke in the Potsdam agree-
ment, come for Germany to participate
in the life of peaceful peoples. Has

### 74173: Illiteracy and hunger: twin evils of Asia

ILLITERACY AND HUNGER
- TWIN EVILS OF ASIA.
Vital Link Between Education and Living Standard is Theme for 11Mysore Seminar
THE connection between learning to
read and tending a plot of rice
land may seem rather vague-
until you sit down at the table of
a typical illiterate farmer in Asia.
There the tight bond between ignor-
ance and hunger is demonstrated, and
much more forcefully than by any
column of statistics.
Multiply this man by hundreds of
millions and you have an idea of what
education must accomplish in its
indirect role as a farm tool. The land
of Asia can be made to produce more
food, but the men who work it are
isolated, by ignorance, from new and
improved techniques.
This is the reason for the Unesco
Seminar on Rural Adult Education in
Asia, to be held from November 2nd to
December 14th at Mysore under the
joint auspies of Unesco and the
Government of India. For many
years, educators, agricultural scientists,
health specialists and other experts
have been conducting rural education
projects in many areas. Unfortun-
ately, this work cannot be done at a
large, centrally-located university
under the eyes of an international
audience. By its very nature, it is
carried on in more remote regions.
The purpose of the seminar which will
bring together men from such widely-
separated nations as Australia, Saudi
Arabia, China and Great Britain, is to
pool the results of these experiments
and extract the best of the tehniques
tested.
This international meeting in India
is part of a continuous pattern of
Unesco seminars for educators. The
first was held in France a little more
than two years ago ; the most recent
one has just completed its work in
Brazil. The Brazil seminar, which
took up"Illiteracy in the Americas,"
provided a wealth of new material on
adult education which will be brought
into Mysore.
In operation, the seminar at Mysore
will be divided into four sections. The
first is the only one which could pos-
sibly conform to a narrow int2rpre-
tation of the functions of education.
A symbol of Asia's illiteracy problem. This Indian letter writer does a thriving business on
the steps of a New Delhi post office. The typewriter is a modern innovation to deal with
business letters.

There methods of fighting adult illi-
teracy will be discussed In its other
sections, the seminar will cover such
fields as the improvement of farming
methods, better hygiene and health
education techniques, and the training
of the former illiterate to play a
healthy role in society.
The men and women who are run-
ning the seminar are anything but dry
theorists. Typical of the organizers is
Dr. Spencer Hatch of the Inter-
American Institute of Agricultural
Sciences, who will act as chairman of
the group studying the economic side
of rural adult education.
Dr. Hatch has become a leading
exponent of the rural centre, where,
on plots varying from one to fifty
acres, the local farmer is shown how
Í1e can improve his land and his way
of life. A rural centre, as set up by
Dr. Hatch in Costa Rica, Mexico, and
India, usually consists of demonstra-
tions in strip cropping, erosion control
and the proper methods of handling
cattle and poultry. In addition, a
community kitchen is organised for
farmwives, and, in some centres, model
houses have been built out of local
materials-often nothing more than
whitewashed mud.
Dr. Hatch bristles when you describe
his rural centres as"model farms."
These he considers as attempts by
outsiders to do things better than the
farmer could possibly do them himself.
As a rural educator, he is completely
opposed to absentee experiments. He
and his students work and live on the
job they undertake.
In addition to Dr. Hatch, Unesco is
sending two other experts to the
seminar. They are Dr. Frederick Rex
of its Fundamental Education division,
and Dr. Ismael Rodriguez Bou of the
University of Porto Rico. Three other
United Nations specialized agencies,
the International Labour Office, the
World Health Organisation and the
Food and Agriculture Organization-
will send observers to Mysore. Parti-
cipants from eighteen countries are
expected at the seminar.
It is this international mingling of
men and their ideas which is one of
the most important principles of the
Unesco seminar-over and above its
printed agenda. The farmer in Asia,
his wife and his family, for whom the
Mysore seminar has been organized,
may hope for a much better chance to
escape hunger and misery if they have
the educational resources of a good
part of the world working to help
them.

to constitute a threat to her neighbours
and to the peace of the world ? Has
the activity developed or proposed by
Unesco in Germany any uniformity
for the German population throughout
Germany !"
"Ger.""""Divided."
PROFESSOR v AKA protested that
the activities of Unesco in Ger-
many touched only the Western
zone... That signified that Unesco
approved the concept of a Germany
divided into two parts which was a
violation of the Yalta and Potsdam
agreements. Unesco should not conti-
nue its activities in Germany if it was
not possible to spread that activity over
the whole of German territory.
Of present conditions in Germany, he
said :"'The situation is changing, but
it is changing only in one direction, ma-
nifest in the fact that the renaissance
of Nazism in Western Germany is
transforming Western Germany, not
into a democratic state, but. into a
centre of Neo-Fascism and militarism.
The so-called Parliament of Bonn is
merely a platform that calls out for
revenge".
1\1. Paulo de Benedo Carneiro, Head
of the Brazilian delegation, put his pro-
posal declaring,"Hitlerism is a conta-
gious epidemic and the countries far-
thest away from Germany have also
gone through its consequences. Unesco
cannot fail to give attention to this
problem, and try to find a solution.
There is in German youth a tendency
to follow again the road of yesterday.
No one ignores this. : \0 one wishes to
ignore it.
"It is because we are faced with
this picture that we have to be assured
L.'ncco is working to fight this atmo-
sphere, which, during the Hitler years,
allowed this situation in Germany to
survive. Give up the task of Unesco
in Germany, because at this moment
Hitlerite manifestations are taking
place ? 2\'0 ! What ever the difficulties
of the task Unesco cannot give up
without betraying her charter".
Professor. \) fSomtnerfeH of Norway,
while understanding Ine anxieties and
scepticism of the Polish, Czech and
Hungarian delegates, said :"woe cannot
abandon this fight. In reality, if we stop
work in Germany, we declare ourselves
beaten in this right. When we cannot
work in the whole of Germany, and we
have never received a reply from the
authorities of Eastern Germany, we have
to work where we can, in Western Ger-
many". He therefore supported the
Brazilian proposal.
Sir John Maud of the United King-
dom, answered the Czech delegate point
hy point, stating :"It is solely because
the Soviet authorities have not felt it
possible, either in quadripartite discus-
sions or in respect of an individual
invitation, to agree that Unesco should
work in the Soviet Zone, that the ans-
wer to the Czechoslovakian delegate's
question is probably, that Unesco's
activity will not, in the coming year,
be in the whole of Germany". But, Sir
John added, the Brazil resolution left
the door open and invited participation
of the Soviet authorities, so that
l'nesco might work in a united and
whole Germany.
To the question :"Is Germany demo-
cratic enough ?" Sir John said :"Which
of us, in all honesty, can say that our
member State is perfectly democratic
to-day ? Most certainly the United King-
dom would not claim to be perfectly
democratic, and it is because we believe
that Unesco can help us to become
more democratic, that community will
become more of a community, because
we believe that men and women can
forgive each other, that they can be
converted, that we remain in Unesco.
It is in that faith that we believe it is
a perfectly clear answer that we can
give to the question of t) ie Czechoslo-
vak delegate. It is because Germany is
not yet democratic enough that
Unesco should work there".
The first speaker at the second ple-
nary session on October 4 at which
Germany was discussed, was Dr. Mau-
rice Fischer, head of the Israel Dele-
gation, who said his delegation would
oppose thf developing of a Unesco
programme in Germany."We are for-
ced to the conclusion", he said,"from
information that comes to us from Ger-
many that the Nazi spirit is very much
alive".
off Ger."a"People are
foolish".
Mar. GEORGE V. ALLEN, UnitedStates chief delegate, who fol-
lowed Dr. Fischer, said :"We
have listened today to implica-
tions that there is evidence that there
continues to exist in Germany a spirit of
nationalism ; that by implication those
that favour Unesco's activities in Ger-.
many favour that revival of Nazism.
That its a most unpleasant reflection for
anyone to discern, particularly anyone
representing a country which has
recently contributed to the defeat of
Nazism.
"The German people have brought
on a world war twice in the last gene-
ration. I am entirely convinced if the
German people are so foolish as to bring
on another, the destruction of Germany
will be greater than it ever has been
before. There is not the slightest doubt
about the fact that as far as my country
is concerned we are as indelibly opposed
to the rise of Nazism in Germany as
we are in any other country in the
world".
"All the action my country has taken
is directed against the wiles of the Fas-
cist type of mentality or an aggressive
nation-it does not matter who it is-
including Germany".
There were those, he added, who
thought the only way to treat this or
that country was by force. The Unesco
approach was directly opposite to that.
"There are those who propose the
alternative that Unesco should have
nothing to do with the German people.
I believe that is dangerously on the road
towards every principle we detest so
strongly in the Nazi regime : that of
condemning an entire race because of
the actions of certain of its people",
he continued.
"I submit to you, that that is dange-
rously close to the theory of genocide,
which we all condemn so bitterly."
For the second time member states
were called upon to declare by vote
their attitude to Unesco plans for
Germany. The first poll rejected the
three-power postponement resolution
by 35 votes to 4, Israel joining with
the minority, and Mexico abstaining.
By the same number of votes the Brazil
amendment was carried, and was embo-
died in the introduction to Unesco's
programme for Germany.
The German debate ended with a
prot. est on behalf of the Czechoslovak,
Polish and Hungarian delegations, made
by M. Ogrodzinsky, Polish delegate,
who said they considered it necessary
to protest energetically against the
resolution wicIl had been adopted"By
this resolution", he declared,"Unesco
recognises and supports the idea of the
partition of Germany which is a Qa-
grant violation of the Yalta and Potsdam
agreements".
Compared with the protracted inter-
changes on Germany, the following
discussion on Unesco plans for Japan
was brief. 11. Proceso E. Seabastian of
the Philippines, reaffirmed his delega-
tion's belief that it was much too early
to admit the Japanese into Unesco's
Seminars and Conferences, before a
peace treaty had been concluded. He
proposed that the section Df the reso-
lution enabling Japanese individuals to
be invited to conferences and seminars,
be suspended until the 5th General Con-
ference. The Philippines, however,
wished Unesco's work to continue in
Japan.
Mr. A. J. A. Nelson, of Australia,
while stressing that their aim in Japan
was not to open wounds but to heal
them, supported the Philippines propo-
sal. Dr. william K. Bunce, representa-
tive of the Supreme Commander for theAllied Powers in Japan here intervened
to state that the Supreme Commander
believed it was desirable to extend to
the Japanese people participation, as
observers and visitors, to international
conventions or meetings of a technical
nature, not involving political conside-
rations. Put to the vote, the Philip-
pines amendment was defeated by 17
votes to 6 with 5 abstentions. Thus,
Unesco plans for Japan were finally
approved.

### 74174: The Work of the General Conference as viewed by delegates

BY DELEGATES :
Sir John MAUD,
a member of the United
Kingdom delegation and a
member of Unesco's
Executive Board :
"1 personally leave
this Conference feel-
ing happier about
Unesco than 1 have
felt since it was set
up three years ago.
It is doing a job, for all of us, and in the end
it is going to make the world a definitely happier
place-and a better one."
Don ARMANDO SOLANO,
Head of the Colombian Delegation, Minister Plenipo-
tentiary, and permanent representative of Colombia to
Unesco :
"The conscientious and solid hard work done at
the Conference by some of the most distinguished
scientists in the world, as well as by others in a
humbler position who labour in their respective
countries on behalf of the Organization, justifies
a sober faith in everything that has been done
towards achieving our goal. Every matter of
controversy or dispute was thoroughly thrashed
out. The Conference provided the opportunity
for numerous consultations and hard work on every
item of the Agenda, ending in that full measure of
agreement upon which all fruitful activity must
be based."
Professor
L. VERNIERS,
Belgian delegate to the
conference, after recalling
that an organisation is
assessed by its principal,
said :
"7'hot is why I would like
to make a suggestion, a
proposition : thatthe Confe-
rence should decide to
publish in brochure form,
the speeches delivered by
the Director General, since tie took on his heavy and
important duties of assuring the progress of Unesco. This
would be the finest proþogondo for Unesco".
Note : Professor Verniers'proposal was adopted at the
fifteenth plenary meeting, the conference accepting M.
Torres Bodet's reservation that speeches an the least
prominent activities be omitted.
Dr Martinez
BAEZ,
Mexican Delegate and
member of the Executive
Board.
"The Programme, as
drawn up by the Direc-
tor-General, is an ex-
cellent summary of the
essential aims of Unes-
co, and establishes a
very direct link between the activities of the
Organization and its general purposes. The
compression of the Programme will avoid dissi-
pation of effort, will achieve a full coordination
of work, without overlapping, and will undoubtedly
make for more effective results."
M. Jean
SARRA ! LH,
Rector of the Academy
of France, President of
Paris University Council,
and a member of the
French delegation to the
Fourth Session of the
General Conference :
"We have 01/been very

also like to say, at a moment when delegates ore leaving

to corny out the heavy tasks of Unesco.
We must work energetically in our notional commissions,
in order to combat the sceþticism which still exists in the
minds of some who could be working with us, and to dispel
the ignorance about Unesco, which is still too widespread
among the general pubic."
Don Ramon Diaz
SANCHEZ,
Venezuelan Delegate,
writer, and director of
the Press, Information
and Publications Depart-
ment of the Venezuelan
Government :
"This year's Conference

PRESIDENT OF THE LEBANESE
STUDENTS UN ASSOCIATION
THIRTY men and women students,t representing nve continents,
gathered round a table in one of
the rooms of Unesco House, d'uring the
progress of the Fourth Session of the
General Conference, to learn about the
"know-how"of Unesco. This study
group, or seminar, had been inspired
by the World Federation of United
Nations Associations (WFUNA), whose
business it is to spread knowledge to
young and old'about the behind-the-
scenes mechanism of Unesco and other
United Nations Specialized Agencies.
An important purpose of WFUNA
in convening this seminar was to give
the young people concerned, who are
preparing for political, economic and
international careers, a chance of be-
coming acquainted with the technique
of a large international conference.
The Federation had made similar
arrangements for doctors to attend
the WHO Assembly in Rome and the
same opportunity will be given at the
Economic Commission for Europe
meeting in Geneva, next May.
Students Came
From Five Continents
GEOGRAPHICAL distribution of
the students was wide. From the.
Argentine came a student of the
Institute of Social Studies, from Bel-
gium a student of journalism, and from
Cambodia and Ceylon, law students.
A Chinese woman student was
preparing a thesis on Unesco, while
several French women students were
studying law and literature. Science
was the chosen study of the Egyptians,
Syrians and Turks while Dominican
students had taken up social science.
Members of the student group, who had an.. inside view Ð of Unesco's General
Conference, with Miss Myrna Loy a member of the United States Delegation,
after she had spoken to them on films and mass communications.
Young Americans were going in for
international studies, and an English-
man was taking modern languages.
All these studies are closely linked
with Unesco's work.
For a fortnight, the students were
part of the conference organization.
They enjoyed the same advantages as
delegates, attended plenary and com-
mission meetings, and were guests at
official receptions. They had the full-
est opportunity to make close contact
with those responsible for shaping
Unesco's future.
Anthropology and
Conference Preview
But the students had not come to
the conference merely as obser-
vers. They had their own special
work in the Unesco House room, where
every day an important spokesman or
spokeswoman from Unesco spoke to
them. often after lunching with them.
on one of the problems with which the
conference work time to address them
on one of Unesco's most serious pro-
blems : fundamental education. His
example was the Belgian Congo. Pro-
fessor Sommerfelt of Norway used the
latest discoveries of anthropology to
demonstrate how out-of-date are racial
and nationalist doctrines..
How Education May Save
Civilization
Do. G. Zook, Chairman of the
United States Council of Educa-
tions, spoke about higher educe :
tion in his country, and described
Unesco's work at the Universities Con-
ference held at Utrecht last year.
Mr. Mei, president of the Chinese
Univesity of Pelping, told about his
country's students and their work.
M. Sarrailh, Rector of the Academy
of Paris, dealt with the mission of the
universities, and detailed his plan to
oring higher learning more into line
with the needs of modern life.
Mr. David Hardman, British Mem-
ber of Parliament, and Parliamentary
Secretary to the Ministry of Educa-
tion, broadened the scope of the se-
minar discussion with a lively, per-
sonal account of how education may
save our civilization.
Count Jacini, head of the Italian
delegation, lectured on Europeans'pro-
blems, and gave his conclusions on the
work of the Council of Europe at
Strasbourg, which he had attended.
Dr. Zeissel, head of the Austrian dele-
gation, had a busy time answering
questions on current happenings in
Austria.
To end this round of prominent
Unesco speakers came U Ba Lwin,
head of the Burma delegation, who
talked about his country, and Miss
Myrna Loy, film star, and member of
the United States National Commission
for Unesco, who spoke on films and
mass communications.
Twelve Voices
Round a Microphone
, EE discussion followed each talk
and this unofficial, frank and
lively exchange of views between
students was steered by Mr John
Ennals, Secretary General of WFUNA,
and_his assistant, M. Dausset.
Outside their work as observers
and debaters, the visiting students
made excursions to centres of cultural
interest in the vicinity of Paris : mu-
seums, historic chateaux and libra-
ries. At the Palais de la Decou-
verte, M. Leveille spoke to them, on
behalf of the International Council of
Museums, about the links between
Unesco and museography. At the Mu-
see GaIIiera, they saw the Unesco Exhi-
bition of Human Rights. At the Salle
Gaveau, they listened to the concert
of works by international composers
to commemorate the centenary of the
death of Chopin.
A dozen students of different na-
tionalities went to the microphone for
a broadcast arranged by the Unesco
radio division, to give impressions of
their visit to Unesco. They welcomed
the invitation of other broadcasting
stations, Paris-Inter and Radio-Luxem-
bourg to relay these impressions to stu-

HUMAN
RIGHTS
EXHIBITION
MR. Clive Entwistle, R. R. I. B. A..M. S. Lea., architect and coordinator
of the Human Rights Exhibition, the first
major exhibition organized by Unesco,
has carried out a number of exhibitions
in England, but is better known for
some of his large-scale architectural
and town-planning projects which have
been widely illustrated in the architec-
tural press of Europe and America.
His prcject for the rebuilding of the
burnt-oust Crystal Palace in London in
the form of a great Cartesian pyramid
of glass was described by Le Corbu-
sier, the great French master of the
modern movement, as"this brilliant
and perfectly magnificent paradox... it
has grandeur and nobility... a serious
work, thoroughly mature and stud-
ied..."
Present conditions in England pre-
clude the execution of his capital pro-
jects, which led to his coming over to
undertake a commission for Unesco
that offered interesting scope for
designing.

A MESSAGE FROM
DR. H. V. EVATT
To the General Conference
I believe the Universal Declarationwill stand as a lasting monument
to the United Nations and to the great
city 01 Paris, especially having regard
to its historic association with many
past struggles for the liberation 01 the
human spirit. The Declaration was a
solemn pronouncement by governments.
that power exercised by governments
is to be used by them, in trust, for the
benefit 01 those they govern.
"It is my fervent hope that the efforts
01 the United Nations will be as suc-
cessful in propounding a Covenant and
measures of implementation as it was
in propounding the Universal Declara-
tion 01 Human Rights. I commend the
United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization for spread-
ing knowledge 01 and respect for tha
lolty principles 01 the Declaration of
Human Rights."
Dr. H. V. EVATT (Deputy Prime
Minister of Australia, and
President of the Third Gene-
ral Assembly of the United
Nations, which adopted the
Universal Declaration of
Human Rights in Paris, last
December) in a message to
Unesco's Fourth General Con-
ference.
THE letter above was written bya visitor to Paris after seeing
the Exhibition on Human Rights
organized by Unesco at the Musée
GaHiera. The purpose of the exhi-
bition, which opened on October I,
is to celebrate the moral values
enshrined in the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights, adopted
by the United Nations General
assembly, last December.
The Courier feels that from this
letter, readers will obtain both an
impression of the exhibition itself
and will understand its message-
the universal responsibility for
achieving and defending human
rights.
At the opening of the Human Rights Exhibition, Dr. E. Ronald Walker, President of Unesco's

### 74177: New charter defines code for Latin American universities

Meeting in the City of Guatemala, for the first Latin American Congress of Universities.representatives of 134 universities and state and denominational institutions have
approved a new Charter, defining the principles which will govern their activities.
The Charter, accepted by the Congress, at a special meeting under the chairmanship of
Dr. José Rolz Bennet, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy of Guatemala, lays down that the
Universities of Latin America shall :
« Direct education tow. arus the complete
development of the human personality and
towards ensuring respect for human rights
and fundamental liberties ; towards the
promotion of understanding, tolerance and
friendship between all nations, social or
religious groups ; towards furthering the activ-
ities of the United Nations for the maintenance
uf peace, in close co-operation with institutions
devoted to the advancement Of culture, science,
education. and arts
The Charter also enumerates the Principles
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
to the realization and maintenance of which
the Universities must also contribute. In doing
so, it confìrIIlS the words of M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco, who in a
message to the Congress said that such a
Declaration :
«... is not the fruit of a moment's legalistic
euphoria on the part of governments. Though
it yet lacks the contractual character which
would make dt a legal weapon in the hands of
men meeting their current trials, it is even
now a spiritual buttress of the future peace.
Its importance springs from the fact that
every stone in this buttress is a contribution
from some different section of the human race.
All history, all races and all languages speak
its precepts. And with them are heard the
voices of all civilizations ; for many of the
rights here stated found their, first refuge In
halls of learning like your own)).
Universities Union
EstahlÏshed
To carry out the directives of the Congress,the Uni n of Latin American Universities
was established, on a proposal from the
University of Havana and the Institute of
University Relations and Research of Santiago.
Chile.
By these means an improvement of the edu-
cational centres will be sought through the
strengthening of their relations with Unesco,
and with the Inter-American Cultural Council :
of the Organization of American States.
Wider co-operation in the academic and
administrative organization of Latin American
Universities is one objective, but without pre-
judice to the distinctive qualities of each.
There will be considerable increase in exchan-
ges of professors, students, research workers
and graduates as well as freer flow of publi-
cat'ons, articles and research and teaching
material.
Thirty-four delegations, under the Press.
dency of Dr. Carlos Martinez Duran, Rector of
the University of San Carlos, approved these
fundamental bases for cO-Qperation between
educational centres.
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, in his message to
the Congress, also stated :
« In this age of transition the fundamental
problem is that of Duty in Freedom. To the
solution of that problem the universities are
committed as irrevocably as Unesco. Were
there no other reason, that joint task would
alone explain my fraternal interest in your
Congress and my eager wishes for your suc-
cess x.
Living Expression
0' community
A number of international observers studiedthe work car ied out by the Congress
commissions, set up for examining the
various programme items : the mission of the
University, organization of studies, University
co-operation and the formation and indepen-
dence of the University patrimony. Among
these visitors were the Rector of Brussels Uni-
versity and representatives from the University
of California, the George Washington Uni-
versity of Seattle, the University of Tulane,
and of the Paris Sorbonne.
The meetings unanimously upheld the prin-
ciples relating to the intellectual freedom of
professors and research workers, and to the
independence of Universities.
Another clause in the new Charter declares
that the University is :
« The living expression of its times and of
the community in which tt operates. It is not
only an entity which accumulates culture and
transmits knowledge, but an active system of
functions benefiting the community in which
it is born x.
The new code also cites the manner in which
a University must contribute to the forming
of a civic outlook, in order to achieve an era
of peace, based on respect for human persona-
lity in accordance with the ideals of democracy
and social justice.
Professor Bosch-Gimpera, Head of Unesco's
Division of Philosophy and Humanistic Stu-
dies, who attended the Congress as personal
representative of M. Torres Bodet, has reported
that the University spirit dominated the work
done in Guatemala.
« The majority of those present were Uni-
versity Rectors x, he said, « convinced of the
extreme importance of the moment, and of
the need four maintaining close contact with
Unesco and with the Interim Committee of
Universities, which is at present functioning
at Unesco House, and which has been instruc-
ted to organize the First World Conference of
Universities >&gt;,
The Congress supported Unesco's drive to
ensure that the great Educational Centres
in the world co-operate more closely.

### 74178: Congress of Americanists extends international cultural ties

Costumes, such as the ones shown above worn by Indians of Latin America,
are an important source of information to scientists tudying the evolution
of ancient civilizations. Recently in connection with the Congress of
Americcmiats, an exhibition of North American Indian costumes was heldart the Brooklyn Museum, New Yolk.
CONGRESS OF
AMERICANISTS
extends international
-.' cultural ties
DID relations by way of the Pacific exist in far-off times betweenthe people of America and those of Southern Asia ?
This was one of the questions raised at the Congress of Ameri-
canists which recently brought together distinguished American spe-
cialists in the historical sciences, archaeology, anthropology, ethnology
and history at the Natura ! History Museum of New York.
The Congress, in addition to studying-the linguistic problems pre-
sented by the Indian languages and the results of the civilizations Of
Peru (Inca and Pre-Inca), considered the parallels between Hindu Art
and the Mayan Art of the Central American regions.
The research so far carried out reveals a striking coincidence of
artistic ideas, religious symbols and ornamental themes in large monu-
ments and In the industrial works of art, as well as in the sculptural
decorations and friezes of the temples and in ceramic decorations.
At the same time, various exhibitions were held in order to give a
comparative picture between Asian archaeology and that of the New
World. The exhibits came from China, Indo-China and the Facitlc Regions
and included magnificent bronze vases, ceramics and jade ware from
the time or the Shang dynasty-the second half of the second mille-
nium B. C.-and from the Shul dynasty, dating'from the last centuries
of the same millenium up to several centuries before the birth c, f
Christ.
Another exhibition, held In the Brooklyn Museum, contained a
collection of North American Indian costumes, which traced the historical
evolution of Indian wearing-apparel over a period of 1. 500 years.
From the International point of view, the Congress was of great
Importance as a factor In relations between the New and the Old
Worlds through Its adoption of the constitution of the International
Committee of Americanisms. This committee will be a permanent member
organization of the Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences
which forms part of the International Council for Philosophy and Huma-
nistic Studies, which was established under the auspices of Unesco.
In other words, the old cultural relations between the organized
institutions of America and Europe will gain in importance by belrg
extended to the whole of the American continent.
Professor Pedro Bosch-Gimpera, Head of Unesco's Division of Philo-
sophy and Humanistic Studies who attended the Congress, reported
that he was very satisfied with its results, and particularly with the
readiness shown by American investigators in general to try to streng-
then their research and co-ordinate it with that of their colleagues in
Europe and in other parts of the world, in accordance with the aims
of Unesco.
Much of the work of the Congress, whose president was Professor"
Paul Rivet, was concerned with chronological research and the ines-
tigations of the American archaeological groups. The Congress, in fact,
served to emphasise the progress which nas been made m the use of
chronology for the study of ancient American civilizations.

### 74179: Latin American organizations to tell U.N. story

TEIE women of South Ame-
rica were active in cru-
sading for a better stan-
dard of living at a
recently held conference of
Latin American non-govern-
mental associations in the City
of Panama, according to a
report from a Unesco obser-
ver who attended the confe-
rence.
For four days, delegates,
representing 37 organizations.
including the International
Law Organization, Rotary and
Lion Clubs, Trade Union asso-
ciations, and religious bodies
of all denominations, met and
talked over problems of Edu-
cation, Public Information,
and methods of reaching the
minds and hearts of the
people.
Reporting on the conference,
Professor de Benito, a member
of Unesco Public Information
Bureau, states :
« It is encouraging to note
that the women of Latin Ame-
rica do not lag behind in this
crusade. Together with the
professionals, educators and
labour leaders, they have acti-
vely co-operated by presenting
proposals, amendments and
projects for raising the stan-
dard of life on a foundation of
freedom and peace)).
In accordance with plans of
the United Nations, and follo-
wing a resolution adopted by
a UN conference held at
Geneva in July, a series of
conferences is to be arranged
in different Latin American
cities, to guide private asso-
ciations who are able, in one
form or another, to help make
known the aims and work of
United Nations.
A resolution adopted at
Panama affirms the necessity
of teaching in schools the
fundamental principles of the
United Nations Charter, and
emphasises that this is one of
Unesco's main tasks, adding
( the non-governmental orga-
nizations will work in close
co-operation with this Specia-
lized Agency.))
call for
Information Centres
THE Conference also urgedthe establishment in
each country of a centre
of documentation and
information to provide the ne-
cessary facts and figures to
those concerned with teaching
about the structure, aims and
ideals of the United Nations
and its Specialized Agencies.
It was also proposed to
establish a centre of documen-
tation in each country in order
to place at the disposal of
educators the necessary work-
ing materials for carrying out
their important educational
task.
Delegates to the conference
made it substantially clear
that the Latin American
peoples desire to work in close
co-operation with the UN and
its Specialized Agencies and
for that purpose many of the
national associations represen-
ted at the conference asked
the United Nations and
Unesco for working plans relat-
ing to each matter discussed.
Delegates in Panama also
approved policies for promo-
ting a common programme for
all kindred organizations, in
order to accomplish the task
of establishing that world
peace and international
conch : d proclaimed by the
Charter of the United Nations.
Various working commissions
were set up to carry through
details of conference resolu-
tions.
In addition to the prominent
Latin Americans who addressed
the conference, there were
talks by M. A. Salsamendi,
representative of the United
Nations Department of Public
Information ; Dr. Ricardo J.
Alfaro, Chairman of the Pre-
paratory Commission, and Pro-
fessor de Benito, who reported
on the programme and work
of Unesco.

### 74180: Children of the street: urgent problem of post-war child vagrants studied at Charleroi Conference

Urgent Problem of Post-War
Child Vagrants Studied
at Charleroi Conference
ONE of the greatest and perhaps the most pathetic of problems left by
the Second World War is that of the host of vagrant children to be
found in many parts of Europe and also in those areas of Asia which
have known War for ever a decade.
Idle for the most part, often homeless or housed in hovels, eking
out an existence through various forms of petty crime, most of these children
would appear to have little to hope from life.
A hope exists, however, thanks to the numberless people who are working
to help them and to show them how to become useful members of the commu-
nity.
Some cf these people met last month at a two-day conference, called by
Unesco, in the Children's City of Mareinelle, Charleroi, Belgium, to discuss
this vast problem of re-adjusting vagrant or war-orphaned children to social
life.
The conference, first of its kind since the war, brought together magistrates,
psychologists, social welfare experts, and directors of children's communities.
These expert ; exchanged views, presented on-the-pot reports of every phase of
this vast problem of social and psychological causes of vagrancy, outlining,
practical ways and means for educating vagrants and dealing with youthful
gangs, and providing assistance for badly-placed children and their families.
Various Children's Communities of Europe, important post-war centres in
the struggle to alleviate the problem of juvenile vagrancy, were represented at
the Charleroi meetings. Other interested international associations, the Red
Cross, International Union for the Protection of Children, and United Nations
agencies, sent delegates to the conference.
The dramatic facts of the present-day plight of these children and their
elders were laid in # : lccesion before the assembled experts, first in a moving
survey from M. Jean Chazal, a magistrate and a leading authority on the
subject, from his day-to-day dealings with children in the Seine Court.
FROM Italy, Dr. Maria Venturini,
. presented a heart-rending pic-
ture of conditions i  her
country."Even before the war",
she said,"many people lived in slum
conditions, in a single room below
street level, where the only light came
through the open doorway, and
where anything from four to ten
people were huddled together like
animals. But those days now seem
like a past Golden Age to the poor of
Naples.
"The war has destroyed 100, 000
houses, and half a million people live,
if it can be called living, in hovels,
in barrack yards, in caves. There are
even cases of eighteen people from
two or three families living together
in a single room, often without
windows. There is frequently only
one water-closet for ten or twenty
people, and, as a rule, none at all.
"There are three caves at Capodi-
mento and at Mergellina", she went
on,"where more than one hundred
families, or at least five hundred per-
sons, live together. There are long
passages dug out of the hillside,
without air or light. Water and
hygienic facilities are all at the en-
trance to the cave".
No Help From Family
will always remain beggars and
thieves from those who, once they
have food inside them, are capable of
something better. In our cowardice,
we gamble on the chance that despair
may not drive these children into the
courts, where it is they who will have
to answer the charge."
The Friendship Teams
F GUNDER of the"Friendship
t-t Teams", M. Dacier-Falque, des-
cribed to a journalist-observer of
the conference the preventative
methods of the teams."The Friend-
ship Teams", he said,"are made up
of young people from every class.
Outside their ordinary work they
devote themselves to re-educating
gangs of children. Under Various

leroi Conference also revealed the efforts being made to save these children. Our photo

pretexts, they win the children's
confidence and encourage them to go
in for sport, camping and work. In a
year and a half, this new kind of
Salvation Army has transformed eight
gangs of such children into useful
apprentices".
Unesco has been asked to give
material support to these Friendship
Teams, to enable them to extend
their work, and set up homes to
shelter these children from the street.
"W HE, RE are the children when
they are not forced back
into these icy tombs by
rain or sleet ?" asked Dr.
Venturini."In the street, where they
can at least play in the sunlight. The
eldest go further afield to beg in
districts where people have money in
their pockets. I think Naples is the
only large city in the wor : d without
public gardens.
"The family is no help. Why
should families wish to share the
hazards of the street with their chil-
dren, who haunt them by expressing
the mere instinct of self-preservation.
No, their families send them into the
street to play and to beg. The family

knowing that all the rest can be
learned in the streets. The police
know all about it, so do the law courts.
"Children convicted in juvenile
courts should theoretically be sent to
reform schools, but there are none.
But in this respect there are countries
much worse off than Italy.
"Police and magistrates therefore
close their eyes, waiting for some
crime to be committed, since it will
then be easier to pick out those who

### 74181: Folk arts must be saved

THERE are numerous and important links between the field of popular arts and fun-damental education. The preservation and development of traditional arts present
a series of urgent problems which require a prompt solution. These must be faced
not only for aesthetic or sentimental purpose, but also for practica) reasons. The exis-
tance of popular arts is often closely related to the economic life of societies and contri-
butes substantially to their well-being.
The important part played by the popular arts in the programmes of fundamental
education prompted Unesco to convene a conference of experts in Paris to examine the
whole problem and offer practical suggestions regarding the future activities of Unesco
in this promising field.
The Committee of experts, who met at Unesco House from 10 to 15 October,
discussed the significance of popular arts in three types of culture : tribal, pre-industrial
and industrial. In their reports the experts cited numerous examples of decadence and
disappearance of once vigorous arts and they stressed the need to help the people con-
cerned in saving their cultural heritage.
On the other hand, occasional revivals of popular arts were also noted and their
significance was duly analysed. Some interesting observations came out from the discus-
sions. Thus, for instance, it was remarked that action by governments and private orga-
nizations, though sometimes instrumental in the rebirth of a dying tradition, often created
a danger of formalism and archaism. Interference with the liberty of the artist was
unanimously condemned, for popular arts should reflect the tendencies and aspirations
of the culture which produced them.
Finally, the Committee recommended that Unesco should take the initiative in
publishing a symposium dealing with the main problems of popular arts in the modern
world and should undertake surveys in a few communities where experiments had been
tried out. It further called on Unesco to support efforts to prevent the disappearance
of folk arts and to preserve a valuable part of the cultural heritage of the world. Lastly,
the committee unanimously recognized Unesco to be the most suitable organization
for encouraging the exchange of information and documentary material, as well as orga-
nizing exhibitions on this subject.

### 74180: Children of the street: urgent problem of post-war child vagrants studied at Charleroi Conference

In a few months time the first
Friendship Home is to be established.
From it, the children will leave daily
for their factory or training centre,
and will find a large measure of
freedom in their new home.
Honorary chairman of the Charleroi
Conference was M. René de Cooman,
Vice-President of the International
Federation of Children's Communities.
Experts from several war-devastated
countries in Europe and the Far East
contributed to the useful exchanges
that took place.
These experts included : M. Jean
Chazal, Children's Magistrate of the
Seine Court (France) ; Professor De-
motre Caranicas of the University of
Salonika (Greece) ; Dr. Maria Ventu-
rini, a prominent Italian child psycho-
logist ; Mr. U Ba Lwin of Burma ;
M. Jean rranois ; Inspector-General
of the French Educational System and
Dr. Preaut, President of the Intern-
tional Federation of Children's Com-
munities. Chairman of the confe-
rence was Mr. Maurice Millaud, a Eu-
ropean representative of the UN De-
partment of Social Affairs.
"Understand Then Act"
THE importance of the Conference
was stressed by the Press of
many countries. Alexis Danan,
a leading authority on the pro-
blems of neglected children, wrote in
the French daily"Franc-Tireur., :
"The general public knows little of the
wide range of work Unesco is carrying
out to solve the manifold problems of
neglected children. Its mission is not
confined to investigation : the practi-
cal results it has achieved are asto-
nishing.
"And while giving immediate assis-
tance to relieve proven needs, it spares
no efforts to assess requirements
throughout the world. It has corres-
pondents and information agents in
every country and organizes working
conferences to which it invites anyone
able to give useful advice. Its motto
might well be :'Understand then act'".
A report is being prepared from the
conference, on which further action to
improve the tragic existences of these
young vagrants of Europe and Asia
will be based.

17FLORENCE
"HERE THE SPIRIT LIVES"

F LORE :'\CE-the ven svmbol of
Form which is continuously chan-
ged and renewed in space. A
* continuity exists in the various
forms of art which mark through the
centuries the city's glorious passage in
the history of the world. The fine and
translucent air emphasises the outlines
of its hills, soft yet firm surrounding
the Arno like a protecting arm.
Perhaps this happy conjunction of
natural elements has made Florence a
source of forms in space. Throughout
centuries filled with history, its artists
have created visible equivalents to the
hopes and anxieties of man.
The Etruscans had already brought
into the Valley of the Arno extreme
refinement and the mystery of their
rites. The soft Tuscan hills have wel-
comed austere priests who studied the
divine laws of the lightning or the flight
of birds.
Today, the Archaeological Museum
enables us, in the heart of Florence, to
make a mysterious and fascinating
parallel in history : Cimabue, Giotto,
Orcagna, Donatelio, Masaccio, Fra An-
gelico, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Leo-
nardo... The history of forms offers
few examples of such a wealth of
mighty creations in such a compara-
tively short time.
The Uffizi Gallery, the Pitti Palace,
the Bargeilo, the Monastery of St. Mark,
the Gallery of the Academy, the Chur-
ches... everything in Florence bears the
stamp of unique lives and works of art
and their creative power, transcending
Michelangelo's works are well represented among the art
treasures of Florence. This"Madonna and Child"is in the Chapel

journey into the life and times of more
than two thousand years ago : arms,
works of art, jewels which were worn
by knights and ladies during their life-
time and then placed in their tombs,
guarding their eternal rest.
It is a glimpse into an extremely
civilized epoch when men tried to find
forms which would express the sense
of their possible relations with the
world. Transcending space and time,
mysterious and subtle bonds link the
sculptures of the Florence of over two
thousand years ago with the sculptured
forms of the East, of India, China...
As a result of the Roman conquest,
the life of the region considerably
changed. Forms became less inventive
and took on a powerfully realistic
aspect which answered the needs of an
organized life, but diminished the poetic
impulse. The architecture is the best
proof of this, the most striking example
being the Roman theatre at Fiesole.
In the Middle Ages Florence again
took up its primarily creative role.
This was a dark and magnificent era
filled with bloody strife. The citizens
gathered round Church and Empire in
two hostile factions and both sides
waged a relentless struggle for power.
The vanquished lost all ; exile was their
last resource. During such an exile
was created that tremendous and divine
work which summarises passions,
poetry and learning of the period : the
Divine Comedy gave birth to the Ita-
lian language.
It may have been during this period
that the walls of Florence acquired
their forbidding aspect, which persisted
even in full Renaissance days. Around
the Ponte Vecchio, the mediaeval part
of the town spread out in straight lines,
their severity making a striking contrast
with the soft curves of the surrounding
hills.
The Renaissance was the splendid
close of a triumphantly successful crea-
tive period, which is almost without
national boundaries, still stirs our emo-
tions with the high poetical value of
their message.
The Medicis, particularly Cosimo the
Elder and Lorenzo, greatly stimulated
the creative urge of the city in a highly
civilized age. Poetry, painting, sculp-
ture, architecture, craftsmanship, every-
thing contributed during this period to
make Florence one of the most vital
centres in the world.
In the following centuries, the ferti-
lity of ideas that began in Florence
developed in the world a certain sense
of balance and harmony which still
represents an ideal of life.
Florence, on which the War left its
cruel marks, must itself be considered
as one great museum.
Florence, was built as a logical whole,
of which all the parts answered to a
precise need and to a creative desire.
The smallest break was bound to deal
a serious blow at this carefully arranged
harmony. Its logical construction has
today perhaps been destroyed forever ;
two pitiless gaps are to be seen in the
two mediaeval quarters around the
Ponte Vecchio.
The compact line of houses along the
banks of the Arno, from the Ponte
Vecchio to the Ponte Trinita, which
made the river almost like a closed-in
basin-shut in still more by the row
of houses on the Ponte Vecchio itself-
has been broken. The Ponte Santa Tri-
nita, which connected the two sides of
the city by its incomparable arches, and
which was one of the purest examples
of Renaissance architecture, has dis-
appealed.
Those who have examined the pro-
blem of restoring the unity of the city
have grasped the full gravity of this
break.
What was slowlv built in the course
of ages by the combined efforts of the
city's artists who gave it a harmony
answering to the political, Economic and
social demands of life, has been des-
troyed by one violent and sudden below.
The Fifth Session of the General Con-
ference of Unesco will be held in a
building which is one of the master-
pieces of Florentine architecture.
The Palace which Luca Pitti asked
Brunelleschi to build as a private resi-
dence, and which was to constitute an
ideal link between town and country,
has become one of the living symbols
of Art. It combines the constructive
harmony of ancient Roman walls with
the hard austerity of the Middle Ages.
The citizens of Florence, who have not
forgotten the ClastIes and explosions
