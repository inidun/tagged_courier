Goddess on a silver cauldron
In 1891, a magnificent silver cauldron of Celtic workmanship was unearthed from a marsh at
Gundestrup, in Jutland (Denmark). Its inner and outer surfaces were richly ornamented with
embossed figures: a sacred bull, legendary animals, horsemen, warriors, musicians and numer¬
ous divinities, including Cernunnos, the horned god of the Celts. The cauldron was probably
used in religious ceremonies and dates from the end of the Celtic expansion in Europe some
2,000 years ago. Among its decorative motifs whose style reflects a mixture of Celtic art and
oriental and classical influences is this figure, believed to represent a goddess-mother.

More than one-tenth of our land
surface is permanently covered by
ice. Utilization of even part of this
enormous reserve of "solid" water
would solve the growing world
shortage of fresh water. But can
we accelerate the melting rate of
certain glaciers without disturbing
their normal regime with possible
unforeseen effects? This is one of
many problems which scientists
are studying in the glaciological
research programme of the
International Hydrological Decade
(see article page 16). Here, a giant
glacier flows into the sea at the
head of a Greenland fjord (see also

IS the ocean thrusts itself
into our affairs, it creates situations
that demand new political and juridical
answers. Its present and future uses
are incompatible with the old assump¬
tion that beyond the three-mile limit
it belongs to no one. For all intents
and purposes other than navigation,
the assumption is as anachronistic as
the shore batteries upon whose range
the limit was based. At least seven
nations have claimed jurisdiction over
fishing rights 200 miles off their shores.
Under the Convention on the Conti-
DANIEL BEHRMAN writes on science for
Unesco's Press Division. While on leave
from Unesco, he authored "The New World of
the Oceans", to be published this month by
Little, Brown and Co. in Boston. The above

Oceans" and is reprinted by permission of

newspaperman, has written extensively on
Unesco field projects.
nental Shelf, adopted by a United
Nations conference in 1958 at Geneva,
all coastal nations now have a clear
title to the bottom resources of their
continental shelves down to a depth
of 200 metres (656 feet), a boundary
that can run as far out to sea as 250
miles, depending on the hazards of
submarine geography. It is as if a con¬
tinent larger than Africa were added
to their area.
Within it, states the Convention, they
own "the mineral and other non-living
resources of the seabed and subsoil
together with living organisms belong¬
ing to sedentary species, that is to say,
organisms which, at the harvestable
stage, either are immobile on or under
the seabed or are unable to move,
except in constant physical contact
with the seabed or the subsoil."
Certain "organisms" slip through
this legal barbed-wire entanglement.
In international disputes since the
4
adoption of the convention, marine bio¬
logists have been drafted as experts
to determine whether lobsters and king
crabs swim or crawl. If the animals
swim, then the lawyers must consider
them as fish and anyone can catch
them ; if they crawl, they belong to the
owner of the continental shelf.
Ownership of the shelf is not all
that clear, either. In 1958, the Geneva
Convention's framers expected that
twenty years would go by before any¬
thing worthwhile could be mined
beyond the depth boundary of 200
metres that they had drawn.
Oil drillers are already capable of
surpassing it; the miners of phospho¬
rite and manganese nodules are wait¬
ing in the wings. They can make
use of a purposely opened loophole
in the convention's definition of the
continental shelf as "the seabed and
subsoil of the submarine areas adja¬
cent to the coast ... to a depth of 200
metres, or beyond that limit, to
whether the depth of the superjacent
waters admits of the exploitation of
the natural resources of the said area."
In other words, exploitation of the
natural resources is nine points of the
law. Dr. Kenneth O. Emery, a geologist
from Woods Hole Océanographie Insti¬
tution, Cape Cod, U.S.A., is among
those who note that "exploitation" is
not defined in the convention.
He has asked several provocative
questions that cannot as yet be answer¬
ed: "Does the recovery of a few man¬
ganese nodules as curios constitute
exploitation? How many tons of nodu¬
les per year per unit area constitutes
exploitation? Is profit on a free and
open market required, or will large
governmental subsidies substitute for
profit? Manganese nodules with their
content of cobalt, copper and nickel
are the chief deep-sea resources that

No flags on the sea floor
generally receive mention, but does
the recovery of a few million dollars
worth of these metals per year warrant
assignment of sovereignty to huge
areas of the earth?"
There are other questions. What
is the status of the country with a
deep trench near it's coast that separ¬
ates it from what would normally be
its continental shelf? Norway was in
such a position when drilling rights
were apportioned in the North Sea, but
Great Britain allowed her to extend
her claim across the trench.
In the Pacific Ocean, the long arm
of American law reached over waters
10,000 feet deep to prosecute an in¬
genious group that had tried to put
a man-made island on Cortes Bank,
110 miles off San Diego, to reap a crop
of abalone and lobster. To start their
island, they decided to sink an old
troopship on the bank, but their plans
went awry and the ship was wrecked
in 35 feet of water. They were charg¬
ed with creating a hazard to navigation
on the continental shelf off California. '
6
T,HE convention's least
controversial provisions are already
becoming obsolescent. It declared
as a matter of course that the
legal status of the seas above the
shelf remains unaffected. Serious
doubts are now being expressed about
allowing freedom on the top of the
sea.
Dr. John P. Craven, chief scientist
of the Navy Special Projects Office in
Washington, does not see how fishing
and shipping could continue in areas
where divers are working for long
periods at a stretch:
"They are in a precarious position
with respect to man-made perils. They
cannot tolerate explosive detonation in
their near vicinity; they cannot tolerate
extensive pollution; they cannot toler¬
ate interference by trawls or dragnets."
Such prospects are plausible in the
context of a legal vacuum. There is
a growing sentiment that the vacuum
cannot be allowed to exist much longer
if we are not to repeat in the ocean
the same grievous mistakes that have
left us in our present predicament on
land.
In July 1966, President Johnson said
what many are thinking: "Under no
circumstances, we believe, must we
ever allow the prospects of rich har¬
vests and mineral wealth to create a
new form of colonial competition
among the maritime nations. We must
be careful to avoid a race to grab
and to hold the lands under the high
seas. We must ensure that the deep
seas and the ocean bottoms are, and
remain, the legacy of all human
beings."
In several quarters, the President has
been taken literally. Senator Clai¬
borne Pell, of Rhode Island (a state,
as he has said, with 156 of its 1,214
square miles under water and a shore¬
line of 384 miles) introduced into the
U.S. Senate, in September 1967, a
short resolution aimed at achieving
"a reasonable legal order for the extra¬
national world ocean."
The resolution speaks of an "urgent
need" for an international agreement
to keep the deep-sea floor and its
resources free for use by all nations.
The agreement would also ban the
stationing on the ocean bottom of
"unproven types of nuclear or other
kinds of mass destruction weapons."
Pell asked that the U.S. State De¬
partment take steps leading to an
ocean space treaty that would allay
any fear that the United States and
the Soviet Union "might attempt to
carve up the oceans of the world into
co-dominions much as the Spanish and
Portuguese sought to do with the
New World in their agreement at Tor-
desillas, signed on June 7, 1494."
Just about this time, Malta, a state
even smaller than Rhode Island, drop¬
ped a similar idea into the United
Nations General Assembly. In August
1967, Malta requested that the Assem¬
bly's agenda be modified to include an
item on "the reservation exclusively
for peaceful purposes of the seabed
and of the ocean floor, underlying the
seas beyond the limits of present

THE UNDERWATER LANDSCAPE
OF OUR PLANET
Beneath the enveloping mantle of the
oceans lies most of the geography of
our planet, a landscape as seamed and
rugged as any on earth. Until recently,
man knew even less about the
submerged 70 per cent of the earth's
surface than he knew about the near side
of the moon. Today with the aid of new
electronic instruments man has mapped
the ups and downs of much of the sea
bottom. One striking result is this map
of the Atlantic Ocean floor (detail of a
larger map) reproduced here by special
permission of the National Geographic
Society, Washington (U.S.A.).
Map shows how the Continental Shelf,
a vast underwater platform,
juts out from the coasts of North America,
Greenland, Iceland, Europe and Africa.
Deep gorges and canyons, crevasses and
valleys mark the greatest depths. Winding
down the middle of the ocean from
Iceland towards the equator is the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an immense oceanic
"spinal cord", criss-crossed by deep
fractures and flanked by chains of high
mountain ranges. Key to figures shown:
-12,000, depth in feet below sea level;
(14,000), height above the 16,000-foot
average depth in the abyssal plains;
9,000, height in feet above sea level
on islands and continents.

270.000,000,000 tons of heavy water
national jurisdiction, and the use of
their resources in the interests of
mankind."
In an accompanying memorandum,
Malta suggested that the "net financial
benefits" that would come from use of
the sea floor should be used "primari¬
ly to promote the development of poor
countries." An international agency
could be created to assume jurisdic¬
tion over the ocean floor as a trustee
for all countries.
One of the main proponents of
such a solution has been Dr. Francis
T. Christy, Jr., of Reseach for the
Future, Inc. in Washington, a non¬
profit corporation financed by the Ford
Foundation. Christy discounts the
feasibility of simply extending each
country's continental shelf as it is
exploited.
Under such a "national lake" ap¬
proach, the French and the British
could lay claim to vast areas of the
Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans
because of their island holdings (the
Geneva Convention gives islands the
same rights as the mainland). The
Soviet Union, with its comparatively
small coastline, would be short-chang¬
ed and, Christy remarks, no ocean
regime can be set up without its
agreement.
The second possibility he mentions
is that of the "flag nation". Any¬
one could operate on the ocean floor
under the protection of his own country
but competition and conflict would in¬
evitably call for supra-national rules
anyway. Christy concludes that the
answer is an international authority
that could collect royalties from the
the seabed miners in the deep ocean,
and in return guarantee their exclu¬
sive rights to a deposit.
I

HE U.N. General Assem¬
bly started to discuss Malta's idea in
November 1967. Dr. Arvid Pardo, the
Maltese delegate, provided more
details about the international agency
that his government had in mind. The
ocean floor, he believed, could not
very well become the responsibility of
the U.N. in its present form: "It is
hardly likely that those countries that
have already developed a technical
capability to exploit the ocean floor
would agree to an international regime
if it were administered by a body
where small countries, such as mine,
had the same voting power as the
United States or the Soviet Union."
Pardo suggested a new agency that
could finance itself by income from
rental of the ocean floor. If the agency
were created in 1970, its gross income
could reach $6,000 million a year by
1975, a sum that could be transfused
into the underdeveloped world. Two
months later, the General Assembly
adopted its resolution setting up a
committee of thirty-five countries to
study the item in view of future action.
Malta's suggestion kicked up a cur¬
ious storm in the United States.
Strong reactions were heard in the
halls of Congress against the idea of
turning the sea floor over to the
United Nations (which Pardo specifi¬
cally said he did not have in mind).
Florida seems to have led the attack.
One of the state's congressmen,
Representative Paul G. Rogers, propos¬
ed an eastward ho! alternative. He
urged that the United States should
occupy the sea floor out to the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge by 1980. "The sea bot¬
toms off the United States present an
opportunity to expand our national
borders in the same manner we did
as we crossed the West in the early
days."
In October 1967, Florida's governor,
Claude Kirk, went down in the under¬
water research vessel Aluminaut and
planted the flags of his state and
the United States on the bottom, eight
miles off Miami, at a depth of 1,000
feet. When he came up, he explain¬
ed to the press: "I didn't make a fan¬
fare about this thing because we would
have had eighteen senators and the
federal government protesting. Well,
it's too late now. You should dismiss
the question of boundaries when talk¬
ing about the ocean bottom. It is only
a question of possession. That's the
way the Spaniards did it. They just
said 'it's mine' and took it. The United
States should do the same."
Eighty-six members of Parliament for
all British parties do not see things-
his way. In May 1968, they tabled a
motion in the House of Commons that
asked, as Pell had done in the U.S.
Senate and Malta in the U.N. General
Assembly, for a treaty to conserve the
sea floor as "the common heritage
of mankind."
Elsewhere, it has been hinted that
the strongest backers of the Malta
plan were large companies with a
stake in the sea. Their support was
attributed to their business sense, not
to a sudden infatuation with the U.N.
Yvonne Rebeyrol, who covers ocean¬
ography for Le Monde in Paris, wrote:
"They [industrial firms] are the most
eager of all to see a settlement of the
legal problems raised by the exploit¬
ation of the resources of the ocean
bottom. In fact, they cannot start
to invest heavily on the bottom until
they are certain they will not be evict¬
ed by someone else who, for example,
could claim prior discovery or rights
under a national law."
The debate among parliamentarians,
economists, jurists and diplomats
shows that the land world is becoming
aware of the built-in internationality of
the ocean. The oceanographers are
involved in dozens of international
organizations, the oldest being the
International Council for the Explora¬
tion of the Sea that dates back to
1901, when it was founded in Copen¬
hagen by countries of north-western
Europe.
Dr. Arthur Maxwell, associate direc¬
tor of Woods Hole, has gone so far
as to say that "the oceanographers
have arrived at a position where they
are actively considering a public order
of the sea quite independently from
the efforts taking place in internation¬
al law circles."
Maxwell, who is equally at ease at
sea or in a U.N. working group, traces
the first major co-operative effort in
oceanography back to the International
Geophysical Year, which ran through
1957 and 1958. It was based on en¬
lightened self-interest: "While the mo¬
tivation of the organizers of this effort
was co-operation on a world-wide
basis, its acceptance among the océan¬
ographie community was at least in
part an economic necessity. Support
for oceanography had been fluctuating
widely and this international pro¬
gramme provided a salvation."
The scientists then convinced their
foreign ministries to support an Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Commis¬
sion, which came into being under
Unesco's wing in 1960, with the late
Anton Bruun, a Danish deep-sea bio¬
logist, as its first chairman.
0.PNE of the Commission's
earliest moves was to turn all its
members' guns against a propos¬
ed international research vessel. The
oceanographers knew what they were
doing. Instead of one ship performing
international research, they have since
had dozens their own. The Com¬
mission offers them a way to combine
their resources, represented by land
laboratories as well as by ships.
Such resources are not the mono¬
poly of a single country. The United
States, it is generally agreed, spends
more than anyone else on the ocean.
Its federal marine science and techno¬
logy budget has been growing lust¬
ily: $333 million in the 1966 fiscal
year; $409 million in 1967; $447 mil¬
lion in 1968.
The proposal for fiscal year 1969
was $516 million, an increase of 15 per
cent, but still only 3 per cent of the
$17,000 million that the federal govern¬
ment devotes to research and develop¬
ment. In 1967, the United States had
125 océanographie ships.
In a report to the U.N., the U.S.S.R.
has stated that its annual expenditures
on oceanography run to $20 million
and that it operates 1 1 0 vessels. Com¬
parisons are difficult to establish and

are always being made. In the United
States, there is a tendency to speak
in public about "catching up with
the Russians" whenever funds are
being sought. American oceano¬
graphers who visited the U.S.S.R. have
told me that their Soviet colleagues
tend to use the same argument for
the same purpose.
There is certainly a similarity in
attitudes about the sea. The follow¬
ing quotation must sound familiar to
Western readers: "More than 40 chem¬
ical elements have been discovered
in sea water. There are more than
10 billion tons of gold, four billion
tons of uranium and 270 billion
tons of heavy water [the author uses
"billion" in the U.S. sense, 1,000
millions] to say nothing of the fact that
MINING SEAFLOOR URANIUM
Century after century, water washing
off the land has deposited in the oceans
every" mineral known to man.
Scientists are now devising
new ways to "mine" the ocean's uranium
which totals four billion tons.
Drawings below explain the functioning
of a huge "uranium trap" to be set up on
the coast of North Wales.
Nodules of titanium hydroxide, a "mag¬
net" for uranium, are placed on the
beach at low tide.
The rising tide covers the nodules. A
barrage is placed across the bay to trap
the seawater.
Two days later the barrage is removed.
Nodules, on which uranium has combined
with the titanium hydroxide, are recov¬
ered at low tide.
the sea contains 97 per cent of our
planet's wealth in water. The ocean
is a storehouse holding all the minerals
of the globe. If they were gathered
and spread evenly over the earth's
surface, they would form a layer more
than 200 metres thick."
It is from an article entitled "Seven
Seas," by A. Grinevitch, in Yuni Tech¬
nik (Young Technician), a popular Sov¬
iet science magazine aimed at young
readers. The issue also contains
articles on the polar seas, whaling,
ships of the year 2000 and a piece
by Jacques Cousteau, who starts by
telling Yuni Technik's audience: "Mys¬
tery is a challenge I cannot resist."
There is a difference between the
usual Western presentation of the
subject and the Russian approach:
Grinevitch talks of six seas (those of
the physicists, the biologist, the geolo¬
gist, etc.), and adds a "poet's sea." A
Soviet captain describes an area in the
Mediterranean: "A handful of amber
beads is scattered over the blue
Aegean. Garlands of yellow pebbles
fill the waters between the Greek and
Turkish shores; their many rows cross
the sea, and along the southernmost
strand of the necklace of islands, there
hangs the mysterious amulet of
Crete."
To learn more about Soviet oceano¬
graphy, I called on an old acquaintance,
Dr. Konstantin N. Fedorov, a physical
oceanographer from Leningrad who
worked for the Institute of Oceano-
logy of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences. He now doubles in brass
as head of Unesco's oceanography
office and secretary of the Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission
(and manages to do valid scientific
work during his weekends). No inter¬
preter was needed: Fedorov's English
is as fluent as his Russian, and his
French is not far behind.
He thought that American and Soviet
océanographie efforts are now run¬
ning parallel, though at their very origin
they stemmed from different sources:
the practical needs of the seaman and
the fisherman in the United States,
and basic scientific curiosity in the
U.S.S.R. "During the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, attempts were
often made to study the ocean as part
of Russia's major geographic explora¬
tory efforts. The great Russian scien¬
tist-explorers were always assured the
active support of the Academy of
Sciences. Ever since its creation by
Peter the Great, the academy has
never been a passive club of academi¬
cians."
A major stimulus to Soviet oceano¬
graphy was the early exploration of
the Arctic. "Little is known outside
Russia of the dramatic history of the
Arctic seas. They were our only free
route to the Pacific: to Japan, to the
Aleutians, and to Alaska, our source
of furs and gold. Beginning in the
seventeenth century, Russian explorers
went east along the Arctic coast in
summer. This economic drive was
the basis of our present efforts in
Arctic meteorology and oceanography.
On the northern route, the U.S.S.R.
runs one of the few existing océano¬
graphie services in the world. It serves
shipping bound from Archangel and
Murmansk to Vladivostok."
Fedorov himself came into oceano¬
graphy through meteorology. In 1947,
he graduated from a technical col¬
lege in his native Leningrad with the
diploma of meteorological observer.
"Our diplomas are narrowly specializ¬
ed, true, but they are based on a
very broad education. The technical
college also offered a course in de¬
scriptive and physical oceanography.
It interested me, and I chose it for my
higher education and more advanced
work for my Ph.D."
His first expedition took him to the
Baltic and the Barents Seas. Later, he
worked in the Black Sea and the
Pacific, and in 1959, he was chief
scientist aboard the Akademik Vavilov
when she made the first Soviet re¬
search expedition to the Mediterra¬
nean. Following that trip, he went
to England to study at Liverpool Uni¬
versity and the Imperial College of
Science and Technology in London on
a Unesco fellowship.
F.EDOROV has also sailed
on an American ship, Woods Hole's
Atlantis II, during the International
Indian Ocean Expedition in 1965.
This cruise his idea of a vacation
from his office in Paris gave him
an opportunity to work with Henry
Stommel, an American oceanographer,
on the study of differences in temper¬
ature and salinity over depth ranges
of only a few feet the new field of
micro-oceanography.
He knew of Stommel from his writ¬
ings. "His works were among the first
scientific books that I studied in
English. Practically every research
oceanographer in the Soviet Union
reads English. Later, I met Stommel
at a meeting of our Commission's
scientific advisory group in Moscow.
He is one of those scientists I only

father of marine biology in the Soviet
Union, or Roger Revelle, or Vsevolod

lished a joint paper on their research.
Fedorov saw no difference between
Atlantis II and Soviet vessels in the
organization of work at sea and the
spirit in which it was carried out. "On
both American and Soviet ships, many
crewmen participate voluntarily in
scientific observations: bird-watching
or surface fish-catching. When one
of our ships is on station at night,
sailors lower a lamp into the water
and catch fish. It's a sport, of m
course, but they don't eat the fish M

their collections. I think that, like

### 58097: The New world of the oceans

NEW WORLD OF THE OCEANS (Continued trom page 9)
According to legend, Alexander the Great, in the 3rd century B.C., was lowered
into the sea in a glass barrel "to see what was there and to defy the whale"
(from a 15th century manuscript, below). Leonardo da Vinci designed submarines
and diving gear and is said to have made a descent in a diving bell. Above, a
17th century one-man diving bell, ballasted by a large lead ball. Water penetrated
the bell to the point where it equalized the air pressure.
Mobile houseboat for
who doesn't go to sea just for the
money."
I asked Fedorov a question that
keeps popping up: why are Soviet
research ships so big. The largest is
the veteran Ob, displacing 12,000 tons,
and several newer vessels run to
6,000 tons, three times the size of
Atlantis II. "There are several
reasons. The boundaries of the
U.S.S.R. are such that our ships
cannot keep returning to Soviet ports.
It is not profitable for them to pay for
supplies in foreign ports. Fuel, for
example, is much cheaper at home.
So voyages must be long. A large
ship offers more comfort for the
scientific team and much more of a
cultural life for both the scientists and
the crew."
Fedorov confirmed what I heard
from American visitors to the Soviet
Union who were struck by a solid
emphasis on details in océanographie
work. "We're very pedantic in
scientific work. When we make
observations, we bring along not only
great scientists but a host of inter¬
mediate characters. They take a
student by the ear and they give him
a smack if he is careless. This is an
absolute must, from the point of view
of methodology. You must enforce
standards of observation when you
deal with a changing environment
otherwise, your measurements will
change more than the environment."
Marine science in the U.S.S.R., he
explained, has three main bases: the
Academy of Sciences, responsible for
basic research in the world ocean;
the Ail-Union Institute of Fisheries and
Oceanography; and the Hydrometeor-
ological Service, which provides
forecasts for fisheries and shipping.

deep-sea divers
They are co-ordinated by a State
Committee of Science and Technology
under the Soviet Council of Ministers.
Fedorov, who never neglects a
chance to score a point in the long
and usually friendly debate that we
have had over the years, reminded
me that the U.S.S.R. brought the
ocean into national affairs as early as
1921, when Lenin issued a decree
establishing a "Floating Marine
Science Institute" at Murmansk aboard
a research vessel, the Perseus.
Behind the Soviet Union and the
United States, money spent on
oceanography falls off sharply, but
there is no corresponding dip in qual¬
ity. Discovery in Great Britain,
Meteor in the Federal Republic of
Germany, Jean Charcot in France are
every bit the equal of American and
Soviet ships, and laboratories are at
the 'same level. Unlike space a rich
man's game oceanography can be
played by the moderately well-off.
T«OTAL British expenditure
on oceanography is less than $8 mil¬
lion a year, funded through a
Natural Environment Research Coun¬
cil, which also finances activities in
conservation, marine biology and
Antarctic exploration.
The National Institute of Oceano¬
graphy at Wormley in Surrey must get
along on an annual budget of
$1,800,000 that includes operation of
the 2,800-ton Discovery. Frills are
few and far between at the institute's
laboratory, where offices are spartan
and secretaries a collector's item.
There is no scrimping on the ship:
she is fitted out as a small liner, on
the theory that scientists get more
work done when they live well.
British oceanographers whom I met
shuddered, when they recalled the
steel decks of American vessels and
the ordeal of going to breakfast
without a cup of morning tea served in
one's cabin by a cheery steward.
Discovery's size and comfort are
considered an economy: she can work
throughout the North Atlantic winter,
and nothing costs more than a ship
in port.
The Federal Republic of Germany is
on pretty much the same tack as the
British. The Ministry of Scientific
Research pays the bills for the new
$4-million Meteor, a magnificent
2,740-ton ship equipped with a dozen
laboratories to work in all branches
of oceanography. The German Re¬
search Society enabled her to carry
out a notable cruise that studied
both the geology and the inhabitants
of seamounts in the North-East
Atlantic, particularly the Great Meteor
Seamount, a peak rising from a depth
of 15,000 feet up to 900 feet and

by the French cartoonist, Pierre Jacquot.
discovered by the first Meteor in 1938.
The cruise was led by another
marine internationalist, Professor Gün¬
ter Dietrich, head of the Institute of
Oceanography at Kiel University.
Dietrich was elected president of the
International Association for the
Physical Sciences of the Ocean in
1967 and he stuffs the Meteor with
foreign scientists (on the seamount
cruise, he had sixteen aboard from
France, Great Britain, Norway, Por¬
tugal and Spain).
He once told a writer for Science:
"When we were at the zero point of
our existence in 1945, there was one
commander who came as supervisor
for oceanography from the British
navy to our country. He did not come
as a conqueror who drove the oceano¬
graphers in all directions ... He gave
them chances to work in Hamburg and
Kiel ... If oceanography revived in the
Federal Republic of Germany, it was
by his help. This was Dr. J.N.C.
Carruthers of the National Institute
of Oceanography."
A French government survey has
counted 500 Frenchmen working in
oceanography at no fewer than
100 laboratories. The statistic sums
up the brilliant individualism that
characterizes the French. While their
country devotes but $26 million a year
to all forms of marine science, they
are present everywhere: whether in
diving and underwater living, deep-sea
tide measurements, biological studies
in the deepest ocean with the bathy-
scaph Archimède, or the use of
manned floating islands.
A National Centre for the Exploita¬
tion of the Ocean has been set up
by the French government to har¬
monize these commendable, if some¬
what disjointed, efforts. The centre
operates the Jean Charcot, a new
2,200-ton ship, and is establishing a
large océanographie laboratory at
Brest. As priorities, it has chosen
the development of marine protein
concentrates for food, aquaculture, the
mapping of the continental shelf, deep-
diving techniques, the prevention and
cure of pollution, and air-sea inter¬
action research.
It has contracted with Cousteau's
Centre for Advanced Marine Studies
at Marseilles for a new diving saucer
that will-take a pilot and two scientists

NEW WORLD OF THE OCEANS (Continued)
The Mediterranean ideal site for polar studies

down to 10,000 feet. Also under
construction in co-operation with the
French Petroleum Institute is a 230-ton
submarine that is really a mobile
houseboat for divers, rendering them
independent of a surface ship and
attendant risks of bad weather.
A new floating island will replace
the first version that has been in the
water since 1963 as a house sitting
on top of 210 feet of pipe, with 160
feet below the waterline (it cannot be
flipped; once it is down, it stays
vertical even when it is towed). It
has spent most of its working life
anchored between Nice and Corsica,
staying for as long as two years at a
stretch.
Its main user has been the labora¬
tory of Professor Henri Lacombe, who
started the first modern course in
physical oceanography in France in
1948. Members of Lacombe's staff,
based at the Paris Museum of Natural
History, take turns living on the buoy
to. run an ocean data station. They
try to correlate what happens in the
sea with the atmospheric records kept
by meteorologists less than a hundred
miles away.
"That is the advantage of working
on air-sea interaction in the Mediter¬
ranean," Lacombe said. "It is caged
by a network of land stations." To
study these processes on a smaller
scale, he is also creating a sample
ocean 130 feet long, 10 feet wide and
3 feet deep, to be used with a wind
tunnel. Professor Alexandre Favre,
director of the Institut de Mécanique
Statistique de la Turbulence at Mar¬
seilles, is in charge of this work.
Lacombe considers the whole Medi¬
terranean as a miniature ocean where
processes can' be studied with greater
ease and accessibility. He and
Dr. Paul Tchernia, his assistant
director, put the finishing touches to
the solution of the ancient riddle of
why the Mediterranean doesn't over¬
flow despite the current that rushes
into the Straits of Gibraltar from the
Atlantic.
The presence of an opposing under¬
current in the straits had long been
known (and put to use during World
War II by Italian submarines that rode
it silently out into the Atlantic past
British listening posts), but the
Mediterranean's water budget was
still uncertain. Using measurements
obtained by ships of five nationalities,
in a one-month survey of the straits,
Lacombe and Tchernia concluded that
about 31,600 cubic kilometres of
water enter the Mediterranean from
the Atlantic every year and only
30,000 slip out below. The missing
five per cent represents evaporation
by Mediterranean sunshine.
Despite the sun, Lacombe also finds
the Mediterranean an ideal place to
study the formation of deep water
under "polar" conditions normally
found only off the Greenland ice cap
and Antarctica. During a cold Euro¬
pean winter, the Mediterranean off the
Riviera behaves ' almost like the
Labrador Sea: surface water chilled
by cold winds grows denser as it
cools, then sinks to mix with under¬
lying water and thus contributes to
the formation of bottom water. What
happens to it after that is of impor¬
tance not only to physical oceano¬
graphers but to researchers in marine
pollution who wish to know the fate
of dangerous wastes buried in the
deep.
Movements of bottom water are
influenced by "sills" in the seabed,
another feature that the Mediterranean
offers in abundance for convenient
examination. Lacombe told me of a
study of the process of deep water
formation in the north-west Mediter¬
ranean that he hopes to carry out
with the participation of American,
British and French vessels. Very
detailed observations are to be made
with new techniques to follow "mini-
features" of temperature or salinity
characteristics and to try to get at
the underlying processes.
Lacombe served as chairman of
the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission from 1965 to 1967. He
manages to remain active in teaching
and research, yet finds time for inter¬
national affairs. It is something of an
act of faith. He once wrote: "Will
man be able to see the ocean's unity
as an image of the need for a unity
of efforts, a sharing by nations of
their capacity for discovery so they
can first explore and then exploit an
area that is intrinsically almost entirely
international and open to all open
to hopes but also to ambitions?"
A.i S chairman of the Com¬
mission, Lacombe was busy with
legal matters. The status of buoys
drifting or anchored in mid-ocean
is a subject for discussion; so
is freedom of research itself, which
was set back, many feel, by the
convention on the continental shelf.
Under the convention, the country
owning the shelf must give permission
for research there, and scientists are
complaining that it can take longer to
get a permit than to do the work.
Lacombe sees two distinct view¬
points here: "The Americans and the
British prefer to look at an issue case
by case before trying to frame rules;
the Soviets, and to some extent, the
French and the Latin countries, want
to study all aspects at once and move
immediately to a convention."
The Commission has sixty member
countries, but no budget of its own,
no building and no bureaucracy.
Administrative housekeeping arrange¬
ments are provided by Unesco at a
cost of $50,000 to $80,000 a year, as
compared to the $10 million to $20 mil¬
lion a year that the Commission's
members have devoted to international
co-operative expeditions.
The most recent -of these expedi¬
tions is a study of the Kuroshio (its
name means "black water" in
Japanese), the western Pacific's equi¬
valent of the Gulf Stream. It has
been carried out by eight countries
and thirty-six vessels, with Japan
making the greatest contribution. In
1963 and 1964, an international co¬
operative investigation of the tropical
Atlantic was conducted by the same
number of nations using thirteen ships.
The Commission's largest single
effort has been the International Indian
Ocean Expedition from 1959 to 1965
that launched an armada of forty
research vessels under fourteen flags,
with nine more countries participating
in shore operations.
On the oceanographers' charts, the
Indian Ocean was one of the last
great blanks; even data from commerc¬
ial shipping had dwindled since the
opening of the Suez Canal.
It was also the site of the kind of
natural experiment that every physical
oceanographer dreams of performing.
To see the effect of the wind on the
circulation of the sea, he would dearly
love to switch it on and off. In the
Indian Ocean, he has the seasonal
reversal of the winds with the
monsoons. Geologists wanted to
learn if their ridge system continued
into the Indian Ocean; biologists were
interested in the actual productivity of
an ocean that accounts for 25 per cent
of the area of the sea but only 5 per
cent of its fish catch.
No single nation could mount such
an undertaking. The major océano¬
graphie powers sent ships, but so did
Australia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Portugal, South Africa and Thailand.
The expedition was started' by the
Scientific Committee on Oceanic
Research (SCOR) of the International
Council of Scientific Unions, an organ¬
ization that groups scientists in their
professional capacities, not as dele¬
gates of governments.
Later on, the expedition was co-
sponsored by SCOR and Unesco, while
the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission, took over its co-ordina¬
tion. Its implications for weather and
fisheries became the respective con¬
cerns of two U.N. agencies: the World
Meteorological Organization, and the
Food and Agriculture Organization.
Tangible results were produced by
the free-roaming ships. The great
wind experiment was a success. Dur¬
ing the south-west summer monsoon,
Soviet, British and American ships

the coasts of Arabia and Africa. It
races north at speeds up to seven
knots almost twice as fast as the
Gulf Stream.
The Somali Current turns sharply
away from the Arabian coast. To
replace it, cold water 55 degrees F.,
the coldest surface water anyone has
ever found so close to the equator
rises and brings up nutrients. It is
roughly the same upwelling situation
that feeds the anchovies off Peru.
It would be comforting to write that
a scientific expedition has found fish
for the protein-hungry populations on
the shores of the Arabian Sea. It
would be misleading: the 150,000 tons
of fish that are now being taken off
the Arabian coast go into the holds of
modern Japanese and Soviet trawlers.
Antiquated local dhows are unable to
work this new offshore fishery.
In the short run, therefore, the
expedition has failed to achieve one
of its stated purposes: to bring food
out of the ocean for Asia. In the long
run, the prospects may not be as
gloomy. The expedition has given a
salutary jolt to marine science in the
region, mainly in India, which now
has a National Institute of Oceano¬
graphy of its own at New Delhi.
0.MHER results of the expe¬
dition are being charted. Scripps
Institution has brought out an atlas
of the fishery oceanography of
the Arabian Sea; Soviet scientists are
responsible for a biological atlas of the
entire Indian Ocean; Americans at the
University of Hawaii are compiling
physical and meteorological atlases.
Another heritage of the expedition
is an International Meteorological Cen¬
tre at Bombay that is getting an insight
into the vagaries of the monsoon, upon
which Indian agriculture depends. The
end of the expedition has seen the
start of permanent research in the
Indian Ocean.
Scientific co-operation on the high
seas is now focusing on areas that
can be covered more intensively. The
latest studies conducted by the Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Commis¬
sion are aimed at the Caribbean and
the Mediterranean, two seas that have
already been explored but now need
to be understood.
What is heartening about both
studies is that they give smaller
countries a chance to join in oceano¬
graphy. The investigation of the
Caribbean was proposed by the
Netherlands; research in the Mediter¬
ranean is bringing together countries
of North Africa and the Near East
under arrangements that permit them
to carry out scientific investigations in
the same waters.

ITH the advent of the
Space Age, man has viewed his planet
from afar for the first time and has
marvelled at its beauty.
From a space capsule in orbit, the
physical features of the globe
are plainly visible. Vast plains and
mountain ranges, the variegated
patterns of deserts and steppes, taiga
and jungle contrast sharply with the
dazzling whiteness of the glaciers and
the frozen ice covers of the Arctic and
Antarctica. Even at a glance, an
astronaut sees that much of the world
is still locked in deep freeze.
Ice covers sixteen million square
kilometres of the earth's surface
(11 per cent of its total land area),
and most of this expanse is occupied
by the immense polar icecaps.
These frozen masses affect the
circulation of the atmosphere and the
ocean currents and strongly influence
their thermal balance. By their action
on the winds and waters, which give
the earth its varied climatic and
geographical zones, the giant icecaps
thus serve as global "weather
factories".
Several tens of thousands of years
ago, ice covered 45 million square
kilometres of the earth's surface. Cli¬
matic contrasts were greater and geo¬
graphical zones moved towards the
equator. But between each of the
world's periods of glaciation there

have been warmer ages, the inter-
glacial phases. As these have lasted
eight times longer than the ice ages,
the absence of glaciers on the earth's
surface is considered to be more
characteristic of its normal state.
The last great Ice Age began about
one million years ago during the
Quaternary period. The rise of Man
also dates from this glaciation following
the appearance of his ape-men
ancestors at the beginning of the
Quaternary.
Man's development was accelerated
by the advance of glaciers and ice
sheets, as the drop in planetary
temperatures forced him to master the
mechanics of fire-making, to garb
himself in warmer clothing and to build
homes as protection against the cold.
In our own era, glaciers are receding,
but the great icecap of Greenland and
the frozen continent of Antarctica
prove that we still live in a glacial age.
It has been said that glaciers are
a negative phenomenon of nature, a
global "malady", capable in certain
circumstances of spreading rapidly.
We do not share this view. Glaciers
are a source of health to our planet
since they help to shape climatic
contrasts and thus the rich diversity
of our global environment.
Moreover, they may eventually help
to solve a major problem the world
water shortage. This becomes more
acute each year as scientific and
technological progress increases the
need for fresh water. Scientists and
engineers in many countries are there¬
fore experimenting with ways to tap
hitherto unused water resources. In
this connexion the rational use of
glaciers vast untapped reservoirs
of fresh water deserves special
consideration.
Another feature of glaciers is the
special rôle they play in the natural
cycle of our planet because of their
ability to conserve water in solid form
for very long periods. A snowflake
which falls on a mountain glacier can
"live" for 10,000 years before melting
and becoming water again. This is
quite a short lifetime compared to that

GLACIERS ON THE MOVE (Continued)
THE SAME SITE
100 YEARS APART
GLACIER IN RETREAT. Observation of glaciers in many parts of the world,
particularly in the Alps and Scandinavia, shows they are receding. Between 1891 and 1965,
with the exception of three years, more than half the Swiss glaciers observed were
receding every year. In the early nineteenth century painting above, the artist was
able to depict the famous Rhône glacier in Switzerland (source of the river which
flows through France into the Mediterranean) as a mountainous wave of ice pouring
out into the valley. As photo below taken at same site shows, it has since retreated
considerably, and its mass is now trapped between two mountainside«.
of the ice mass in large glaciers. The
"core" of those in Antarctica, for
instance, is known to be 200,000 years
old.
Almost 80 per cent of the world's
fresh water between 24 and 27 million
cubic kilometres is locked up in
glaciers. The total volume is equal to
the water flow of all the world's rivers
for 700 years. Should this ice melt
completely, the result would be a rise
in the ocean level of 64 metres
enough to submerge the coastal
regions of all continents over an area
of about 15 million square kilometres.
Enough fresh water for man's
present needs could be obtained by
liquifying only a part of this enormous
mass of "solid" water. Icebergs, for
instance, could be used as water
supplies for coastal cities.
Even a relatively small iceberg (two
kilometres long, half a kilometre wide
and 150 metres thick) contains about
150 million tons of water enough to
supply each person in a city of eight
million inhabitants with 1,000 litres of
water a day for a month. Towing the
icebergs and tapping the water during
the melting of large masses of ice
would obviously present major tech¬
nical problems, but theoretically the
operation is feasible.
Similarly, glaciers in mountain
ranges are a potential source of
plentiful fresh water, particularly for
use in irrigating the fertile but often
arid plains that lie close to the foothills
of mountain systems.
The glaciers of the Tien Shan
mountains and the Pamirs in Central
Asia, which border on fertile plains,
contain about 2,000 cubic kilometres
of ice. This represents nearly twice
the amount of water currently used for
irrigation throughout the world.
The first step in tapping at least part
of our glacier water reserves is to find
an effective way of melting ice rapidly.
One solution is to cover the glacier
with a dark powdery substance which
helps to accelerate the melting process.
This technique was used over two
thousand years ago, in the time of
Alexander the Great, by farmers in the
Pamirs who spread earth and cinders
on the snow to thaw out their fields
more quickly.
Experiments on these lines in the
Soviet Union and other countries have
shown promising results, but the
method will be more difficult to apply
on a large scale because of the
vagaries of the weather and the
problem of transporting and spreading
the melting agent.
To bring down a regular and
adequate supply of water to the plains
involves, on the one hand, retaining
the snow on the mountain sides with
screens, stockpiling snow in the
foothills and producing artificial avalan¬
ches, and on the other, using techni¬
ques to melt the glaciers more quickly.
In this way a steady flow of melt-
water into the rivers could be assured.

A TORPEDO
TO THE HEART
Vast Arctic ice shelves moving inexorably towards the sea "calve" giant-size icebergs
(above) which often drift southwards with the currents. Despite radar, echo-sounders
and airborne ice patrols, drifting icebergs still constitute a menace in the North Atlantic.
Attacks on icebergs by bombing and shelling have had little effect, but a French
scientist, Pierre-André Molène, proposed a method of placing an explosive in the core
of an iceberg so that it can be blown apart (see drawing below). (1) A torpedo-shaped
device is lowered by helicopter and burrows into the heart of the iceberg with the help
of a heated nose cone. (2) A delayed action mechanism detonates the torpedo at the
point where it will have the greatest effect. (3) Ship which serves as helicopter
landing platform observes the effects of the explosion visually and with underwater
shock wave detection apparatus (4).
In the spring and early summer, water
could be obtained by melting reserves
of snow, and towards the end of
summer by a more intensive melting
of glaciers. The operation would be
made more effective by the installation
of mountain reservoirs and water
control systems.
It is still too early to say, however,
whether melting operations could be
carried out each year, since glacier
water reserves are not unlimited.
With the development of technology,
man penetrates more deeply into
mountain areas. He discovers new
seams of valuable minerals and
untapped reserves of hydraulic power;
he constructs motorways, pipelines and
power lines. In the process, he
invariably comes up against the
dangers of snow and ice avalanches,
mud streams and glaciers that advance
with unexpected rapidity.
All mountainous countries in the
temperate zone are exposed to the
dangers of avalanches and sometimes

### 58101: The Alaskan earthquake that shook five continents

THE ALASKAN EARTHQUAKE
THAT SHOOK FIVE CONTINENTS
A T 5.36 p.m. on Good Fri¬
day, March 27, 1964, a devastating
earthquake " hit south-central Alaska,
releasing in three to four minutes twice
as much energy as the earthquake that
destroyed San Francisco in 1906. One
hundred and fifteen persons were kill¬
ed in Alaska, $300 million worth of pub¬
lic and private property was destroyed,
and the state's economy was crippled.
The quake's magnitude, duration, and
geographical scope rank it among the
major earthquakes of history.
That the death toll was not many
times higher was due to a happy
combination of several chance ele¬
ments: the sparse population, the for¬
tuitous timing (the earthquake occurred
on the evening of a holiday, when
schools were empty and most offices
deserted), a low tide, the absence of
fire in residential and business areas,
the generally mild weather, and the
fact that it was the off season for
fishing.
Since then, the Alaska earthquake
has become the best documented and
most thoroughly studied in history.
Accurately described as a "natural
scientific experiment on a grand scale,"
it has provided insights into a host of
long standing scientific problems.
The first report in what will even¬
tually be an eight-volume series on the
earthquake has now been published
by the U.S. National Academy of
Sciences. With the overall title "The
Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964," the
series is intended to be a compre¬
hensive report on the earthquake. Its
volumes will cover in detail subjects
in the natural sciences, engineering,
and the social sciences.
The first volume, "Hydrology," (1)
describes the effects of the earthquake
on water in all its continental forms
on groundwater, on surface water, and
on masses of snow and ice.
Most people do not associate water
with earthquakes. But much of the
epicentral region of the Alaska earth¬
quake was covered with water in the
form of snow and glaciers.
The hydrologie effects were spec¬
tacular: frozen lakes shattered, giant
landslides spread over large glaciers,
and snow avalanches plunged down
steep mountain slopes. Human sig-

nificance, however, lies in the less
spectacular: in the compaction of
underground reservoirs, causing dimin-;
ution of community water supplies;
in the hazard of landslides in valleys
once filled by glaciers but now oc¬
cupied by man; and in the damage
to lake shores and lake facilities.
This earthquake was the first such
event known to have affected water
levels in wells, aquifers (underground
water beds), and rivers across a con¬
tinent indeed, across several contin¬
ents.' - Fluctuations in water level were
recorded in more than 700 wells in
Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and
North America. Seismic seiches (sud¬
den oscillations of the water levels
in lakes and streams) were recorded
at more than 850 gauging stations in
Australia and North America; nearly
half of these latter occurrences were
along the U.S. Gulf Coast. (This fact,
the report said, suggests that a local
earthquake along the Gulf Coast might
cause more damage than one of the
same magnitude anywhere else in the
conterminous United States.)
Permanent changes in water level
were observed and measured in many
wells. Such effects have been sus¬
pected after previous earthquakes, but
now for the first time the changes
have been. carefully documented.
Generally the amount of the change
was found to depend on the total input
of energy at the well site. Some wells
in Alaska increased in level as much
as five feet or decreased as much as
fifteen feet; permanent changes out¬
side Alaska are measured in hundredths
of a foot. Not all wells in any one
region were affected to the same
extent, however. This variation in
response has been fairly clearly related
in some cases to porosity changes
and compaction of aquifers in un¬
consolidated sediments.
The earthquake altered stream vol¬
ume and water quality in places. It
also brought down at least a year's
expected quota of snow avalanches
and a decade's quota of rockslides on
to glaciers. Some 51 rock avalanches
covering areas as large as a mile
long and more than a quarter mile wide
plunged on to many glaciers. The
largest covered 4.4 square miles.
One the most spectacular (and most
accessible for study) occurred on
Sherman Glacier, 170 miles south-east
of Anchorage and only seven miles
from the Cordova, Alaska airport.
Here, at least 13 million cubic yards
of rock from two mountains fell on to
the glacier, covering three square miles

of its surface with a layer of mixed
rock debris and ice three to ten feet
deep. That such a massive slide
spread on to a glacier where nobody
lives, notes the report, was a lucky
accident.
An intensive study of this slide has
been made, and a long-term study
of its future effects on the glacier has
been started. Already, it is clear, the
shielding effect of the debris has
changed the glacier from one shrinking
in volume each year to one growing
markedly in size. ,
The most startling aspect of the be¬
haviour of avalanches triggered by the
earthquake is probably their surprising¬
ly great trajectory over long gentle
slopes and even up reverse slopes as
high as 490 feet. To explain the
mechanics of sliding in these long
trajectories, a novel theory has been
proposed: that much of the motion
took place over a cushion of com¬
pressed air trapped beneath the mass
of rock and ice that came down. Al¬
though the scientific verdict is not
yet complete on this theory, it could

## [Page 25](078244engo.pdf#page=25) 0

Avalanches racing uphill on cushions of air
explain why relatively soft surface
snow was buried intact under the
blanket and why some low bushes
survived.
A possible alternative theory is lubri¬
cation on snow and ice. This is
supported by the fact that the long
avalanche paths were over glaciers
and that at the time of the earthquake
snow covered the areas of the slides.
In summarizing the effect of the
earthquake on glaciers, the report notes
that a negative conclusion is perhaps
the most significant one. The enigma
of rapid glacial surges, which occur
only occasionally and during which
glaciers move forward at rates of 10
to 150 feet a day, is still unsolved:
but the Alaska earthquake has seeming¬
ly eliminated the "earthquake advance"
theory which for years held that vast
snow avalanches in the upper regions
of a glacier during an earthquake
caused changes in the glacier's mass
balance, making it surge ahead for a
few months.
Snow was abundant in southern
Alaska on the day of the earthquake,
but surprisingly few snow avalanches
were caused, and no significant in¬
crease in glacier surges has followed
in the critical areas, nor can any be
detected in the making. Nevertheless,
surges have gone on apace in random
fashion since 1964.
Glacier fronts and ice-dammed lakes
have shown surprisingly few immediate
effects. The 25 tidal glaciers entering
the sea near the earthquake's epicenter
were "unperturbed." How little we
actually know, says the report, is
shown by the simple fact that the
immediate effects on glaciers after the
earthquake were far fewer and less
conspicuous than had been expected.
All in all, the report notes, the
hydrological effects of the earthquake
were more a threat to the Alaska eco¬
nomy and to comfort than to lives.
If the earthquake had been in a centre
of broad-valley agriculture as in Cali¬
fornia or in an area of industrial con¬
centration, the hydrological damage
could have been a hundredfold greater.
The report suggests that a scientific
task force be readied by an agency
of the U. S. government to gather
data and to make immediate studies
within hours of the next major earth¬
quake in the United States, and that
a number of types of recording instru¬
ments be installed now in quake-prone
areas to assist such studies. Some
of these instruments, such as hydro-
seismic recorders in test wells and
precise level gauges on lakes, might,
the report observes, foretell an im¬
pending earthquake.
Another suggestion is that the fore¬
casting of avalanches be extended to
all seismically active valley areas and
that signs showing danger levels for
the day, similar to those warning of
forest fire hazard, be posted on all
major approaches to the areas.
Some of the major lessons to be
drawn are those of zoning: which areas
people should not inhabit (such as
within two miles of an avalanche area)
and where to build with caution, pro¬
tection, or strength. It is foolhardy. OC
the report states, to locate dwellings ^**
less than 10 feet above a large lake
in a quake-prone area.

Oriental Music - Occidental Music
THE
NON-ACCEPTANCE
OF
THE UNFAMILIAR
by Tran Van Khê
A,
TRAN VAN KHE, seen here playing the dàn
tranh, a 16-stringed Vietnamese instrument,
comes from a family which has produced
several generations of musicians. He is
himself an accomplished musician in both
western and eastern music. After studying
medicine at the University of Hanoi, he
devoted himself to musicology, and at the
Sorbonne in Paris took his doctorate in
Vietnamese music. He now teaches at the
Institut de Musicologie de Paris, heads a
music research team at the Centre National
de la Recherche Scientifique (Paris), and
directs the Vietnam section at the Interna¬
tional Institute of Comparative Music Studies
and Documentation (Berlin). He is also a
member of the Unesco-sponsored Interna¬
tional Music Council. He has written widely
on musical questions and is the author of
"Viêt-Nam" (published by Editions Buchet/
Chastel, Paris, 1967.)
26
i PART from a handful of
wjstern musicologists who have
learned to understand and appreciate
the different musical traditions of the
East, and travellers who have spent
many years in eastern countries, the
western listener is usually puzzled by
"eastern music".
Even Hector Berlioz, one of the
world's great musicians, found it
disconcerting. In 1851, while in
London as France's official representa¬
tive to the Universal Exhibition, he
heard the performance of a Chinese
air. Berlioz set down his impressions
in a book he wrote three years later,
"Les Soirées de l'Orchestre".
"The song, grotesque and horrible
to a degree," he wrote, "ended, like
any vulgar ballad, on the key-note;
and never varied from the tonality and
mode indicated at the outset. The
accompaniment consisted of a rapid
and monotonous rhythmic pattern
executed on the mandolin (1), totally
discordant with the notes sung."
Berlioz concluded with a severe
stricture on Chinese and Indian music:
"The Chinese and the Indians would
have music like ours, if they had any
at all; but in this domain they are
plunged in the uttermost darkness of
barbarity and childish ignorance, in
which a few ineffective, groping
aptitudes are barely perceptible. The
peoples of the East call music what
we would call a din; to them, as to
the witches in Macbeth, 'Fair is foul,
and foul is fair'."
And in his "A Travers Chants", he
wrote: "The Chinese . . . sing as dogs
yawn, or as cats throw up when they
have swallowed a fish-bone."
It should not surprise us, therefore,
to learn that an Indian musician of
Lahore, according to H. Popley in
"Music of India", described western
music as "the howling of a jackal in
a desert". A few years ago when
I asked a teacher of musicology at the
University of Madras, what he thought
of the music of the West, he replied
"It's noise!".
Mohammed Zerrouki, writing on
Arab music in the "Revue Internation¬
ale de la Musique", has pictured the
reactions of a person from an eastern
country listening to western music.
"Accustomed as he is to monody,
in which all the players perform in
unison, as if they were all reciting
the same poem, he is completely
baffled by this criss-cross of con¬
flicting and superimposed sounds.
His distracted mind wanders from one
musical phrase or instrument to
another, in an attempt to understand
what is going on.
"He sees a western orchestra as a
group of musicians all babbling
different languages. Each performer,
completely independent, is free to
express himself as he chooses. They
all seem to turn their backs on each
other, and a deaf ear as well. While
the music is in full swing, some put
down their instruments, leaving the

says the writer, "is the inevitable
reaction of an eastern listener who
is completely uninitiated in European
music."
Eastern and western listeners are
generally unable to pass a valid
judgement on music which is un¬
familiar to them, for the reason that
they base their opinion entirely on
the artistic values and criteria applying
to music in their own country or

breathed new life
into harmony and
enriched western
music by expanding
the expressiveness
of wind instruments.
But for most of his
contempories, he
was only a noise
maker, as shown by
this caricature of

Misunderstood
genius that he was,
Berlioz in turn could
not understand the
music of the East:
he spoke of it with
the same contempt
as the neo-classicists
mocked his work.

KOREAN HARMONIES
Traditional Korean music, which inherited its rules and forms from
the music of China, has brought down to the. present time the essence
of an ancient musical art of the Orient. It is called "graceful music"
(see also back cover) and is performed in its purest and most
orthodox forms in Korea's Confucian temples. Played on traditional
instruments, some of which were invented several centuries
before our era, Korean music continues to figure prominently in
secular and religious ceremonies. Above, an orchestra with stringed
instruments placed in the foreground and bamboo flutes behind,
plays a piece of "graceful music". Left, a dance traditionally
performed by Buddhist nuns. The dancer provides a rhythmic
accompaniment to her movements by striking the zua-go (a type of
gong invented in China over 2,000 years ago) with sticks (below).

modes, rhythm, the principles of
instrumental and vocal execution, and
aestnetic conceptions.
Yet music, whatever its origin, is
basically the same everywhere. In
the West as in the East, it is, as Jean-
Jacques Rousseau put it, "the art of
combining sounds in a manner
agreeable to the ear." The Yo-ki, or
Journal of Music, a major chapter in
the Chinese book Li ki (The Journal
of Rites), defines it as "an artistic
combination of sounds."
Originally music was related to the
image of a mythological god or super¬
natural being. The music played on
the flute by the Indian god Krishna,
or that composed by the legendary
Chinese emperor Fou hi and played
by Confucius on the Ch'in, had a
semi-divine origin; so had the music
of Orpheus, the prophet of Apollo,
who with the strains of his lyre
succeeded in taming wild animals.
Not only in China was the belief
held that music had power, as the
Yo-ki says, "to encourage the emula¬
tion of good examples, to deeply
affect the emotions, change customs
and transform morals and manners."
Marcel Belviannes, in "Sociologie
de la Musique", writes that Plato
believed music had a calming and
moderating influence on human nature.
According to Tseu Hia, the disciple
of Confucius, quoted in the Yo-ki,
"the songs of Cheng stimulated
debauch and licentiousness; those of
Song, womanizing and sloth; and
those of Tsi, arrogance, depravity and
overweening pride, and should be
forbidden on ceremonial occasions."
Belviannes says that in Homer's
view, "evil music and lascivious airs
corrupt morals and weaken character."
And according to the same author,
Socrates proscribed "the effeminate
music played at banquets, in the
Ionian and Lydian modes, which he
considered too flabby. He admitted
only the Phrygian mode, as approp¬
riately rendering the temper and
virile accents of a warrior in the midst
of the fray."
If we consider the form rather than
the content of music, we are struck
by the great variety of musical tech¬
niques and the differing conceptions
of what is art. This is the cause of
the mistaken judgements passed by
the listener accustomed to one par¬
ticular tradition, on music of other
traditions.
A person from the West thinks that
Indonesians sing out of tune because
the intervals of the Indonesian slendro
and pe/og scales are quite different
from those of the equally tempered
scale. A musician in the Indonesian
tradition judges a piano to be out of
tune, since not one of its 88 keys
exactly reproduces any of the notes
in the slendro scale.
Even two Asian musicians, if they
belong to different musical "families,"
are bound tö disagree on the accuracy
of scales. An Indonesian musician
who once heard me play a piece of
music in the bac mode of Viet Nam,
transposed into the pentatonic scale
(do, re, ta, sol, la), said with a smile,
"It's the slendro scale, but not quite
in tune." This is understandable, since
the slendro scale is theoretically
obtained by dividing an octave into
five equal intervals.
In this connexion it should be
remembered that in a number of Far
Eastern countries the limits within
which a sound is considered to be
in tune are very wide. Oscillations
in pitch are often used for ornamental
effect. A musical performance should
not be considered out of tune merely
because it does not exactly reproduce
the notes of the equally tempered
scale.
L,ET us suppose that a piece
of music is played to an audience of
musicians with different traditional
musical backgrounds. The western
musician tries to identify the tonality
of the passage, project an underlying
harmonic structure, trace a theme and
its variations, and study rhythm and
tempo; but not in the same way as
would an Indian. Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, and Vietnamese musicians
are more interested in melodic line.
An Indian listener will try to situate
a passage in the framework of a given
raga (melody-type), or attribute a
modal feeling. Each member of the
audience has his own listening habits,
and judges a passage in the light of
the criteria and rules typical of his
own tradition.
The notions which serve as guide¬
lines in fact vary considerably from
one tradition to another. Alongside
the equally tempered scale of western
music are to be found countless other
scales used in other countries. These
include the five varieties of the Chin¬
ese pentatonic scale, the Japanese
scales in the ryo, ritsu, yo sempo and
in sempo modes, the Vietnamese sca¬
les in the bac and nam modes, and
the modal scales of the music of
India, Iran, and the Arab countries.
The major and minor modes of
western music have their counterpart
in hundreds of modes belonging to
other traditions. For example there
are the Chinese tiao, the Japanese

### 58103: Oriental music, Occidental music: the non-acceptance of the unfamiliar

NON-ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNFAMILIAR (Continued)
To each tongue its own grammar
sempo, the Vietnamese dieu, the
Indian ragas, the Iranian dastgah, and
the Turkish and Arab maqamat modes.
Ornamental notes, which in the
western tradition are considered simp¬
ly as grace-notes superimposed on
a given harmonic system, are an
essential part of the Indian, Iranian,
and Arab traditions. In Indian music
an unornamented note is likened to
"a moonless night, a garden without
flowers, a river without water." In
the Vietnamese tradition, set orna¬
ments are one of the elements govern¬
ing the mode.
While in the West a performer must
not stray from his score, in India, Iran,
and the Arab countries, improvisation
is the rule; it is the musician's per¬
sonal contribution during the actual
performance.
In the West, one listens to music
in the same way one looks at a
cathedral. One begins by admiring
the architecture, symmetry, and the
balance, before passing on to the bas-
reliefs. In the East, greater emphasis
is placed from the outset on the most
minor details; music is perceived
aesthetically in the same way as one
contemplates a Persian miniature.
Thus each tradition has its own
particular way of creating, executing
and listening to music. Aesthetic
conceptions may be entirely different
according to whether they are occi¬
dental or oriental. For example, a
western audience finds falsetto gro¬
tesque, whereas it is highly appreciat¬
ed by lovers of the traditional Chinese
and Vietnamese theatre. Criticism of
unfamiliar music should be made
with the utmost circumspection.
In the age of jet planes and transis¬
tor radios, the western public has
greater opportunities for listening to
the great traditional masters of India,
Iran, and Japan. Conversely, village
homes in the most distant parts of the
globe may be invaded by western
music, broadcast daily by powerful
radio stations. East and West meet
much more frequently than in the past
in the world of music.; yet how many
musicians, eastern or western, have
been able to turn this to their advan¬
tage?
It must be admitted that most east¬
ern musicians, dazzled by the tech¬
nological and material civilization of
the West, and by the "wealth" and
"scientific" nature of western music,
have learned to handle the musical
idiom of the West, and have repudiat¬
ed, despised or even abandoned their
own musical heritage, of which they
are often totally ignorant.
This may be acceptable where they
acquire such a thorough knowledge
of western music that they are capable
of creating works whose merit is uni¬
versally recognizable. Often however
they produce hybrid music modelled
on broadcast "pop" songs, contribut¬
ing nothing to western culture and
merely debasing their own music.
Frequently they try to "modernize"
their traditional music by imposing a
harmonic structure on basically melod¬
ic or modal music. This is the same
kind of error a linguist would make
were he to apply to his own language
all the rules of English grammar,
because he found them more practical.
1 F only the younger gener¬
ation of eastern musicians would make
themselves more familiar with their
own traditional music, before trying to
renovate or modernize it on western
lines. I strongly believe in preserving
musical traditions, but "preservation"
is not the same as conservatism or
stagnation. I am all for progress, but
"progress" does not necessarily mean
westernization.
Westerners should get rid of the
superior attitude that so many display,
and try to understand music other
than their own, which they are too
often inclined to describe as "exotic"
or to dismiss as "folk tunes."
A number of musicians, it is true,
have looked to the East in their search
for elements to renew their own
musical language. Let us hope that
they will succeed in capturing the
spirit of eastern music, finding in it
not a hybridization, but a wellspring
which will richly nourish their own
music.
While, as we have seen, similarities
exist on the theoretical level between
oriental and occidental music, this
should not blind us to their funda¬
mental differences. There can be no
justification for criticizing unfamiliar
music on the basis of criteria which
are valid only for one's own tradition;
nor for attempts to "modernize" one's
own musical language by borrowing
from foreign music elements which
are totally out of keeping with it.
One of India's greatest figures,
Rabindranath Tagore, defined the
essential difference between the music
of the Orient and of the Occident in
these words:
"The world by day is like European
music: a flowing concourse of vast
harmony, composed of concord and
discord. . . And the night world is our
Indian music; one pure, deep and
tender raga. They both stir us, yet
the two are contradictory in spirit.
But that cannot be helped. At the
very root nature is divided into two,
day and night, unity and variety, finite
and infinite."
This does not mean that eastern
music will forever be a closed book
to the western public, or that western
music cannot be understood in the
East. But if Europeans are to enjoy
the music of the East, and Asians to
acquire a taste for western music,
cultural exchanges will be needed as
well as a period of initiation. As
Romain Rolland wrote in "Jean-Chns-
tophe": "In spite of the claims made
for it, music is not a universal lang¬
uage. Only the archery of words
can pierce the heart of each of us
with the arrow of sound."

and form of decoration, is found throughout Islamic Africa. In numerous

their friends and neighbours with traditional local melodies played,
in many instances, on instruments of their own making. A remarkable
oboe solo by a young boy from the Kanem area of Chad figures
in a record entitled "Music of Chad (Kanem)", in the Unesco series
"An Anthology of African Music" (see inside back cover).

GLACIERS ON THE MOVE (Continued from page 17)

of mud streams, against which costly
protective works need to be raised.
In the Soviet Union, a new technique
was used in 1966 and 1967, when two
powerful explosive charges were set
off to create a protective barrage for
the town of Alma Ata in the northern
foothills of the Tien Shan mountains.
Equally dangerous are glaciers
which suddenly advance at several
hundred times their normal speed.
Such movements occur in numerous
regions of the globe, from Central Asia
to Spitsbergen and Alaska. They are,
indeed, so frequent that special
studies should be undertaken to
enable scientists to predict their
possible effects. These movements
are set off by processes at work
within the glacier itself.
Geological and historical studies
have revealed other features of glacier
evolution. In the 10th and 11th
centuries, large settlements grew up
on the coasts of Greenland, whose
inhabitants engaged in intensive cattle
rearing. At that time, mountain glac¬
iers in the Alps, the Caucasus,
Scandinavia and Iceland had retreated,
opening up many mountain passes.
But around the 14th and 15th
centuries, glaciation of the northern
seas increased; navigation to Green¬
land was interrupted, while in Iceland
many ancient settlements were buried
by glaciers. These "changes were
caused by glacial variations whose
cycle occurs every 200 years or -so.
Other glacial variations have shorter
cycles which occur every 100, 22 or
1 1 years, and which some scientists
attribute to periodical changes in solar
activity. There is, however, an
important mediator in the sun-glacier
link atmospheric circulation which
transforms variations in solar activity
into changes in the behaviour of
glaciers.
And though climatic variations
during several centuries are syn¬
chronized with the evolution of glaciers
over the planet as a whole, variations
over a 10 to 20 year period may be
more or less simultaneous only within
particular regions. Observations over
the last century show, for example,
that 20 year cycle variations in the
glaciers of Scandinavia occur inversely
to such variations in the glaciers of the
Alps and the Tien Shan mountains.
Variations in glacier activity affect
the flow of rivers that rise in glacial
regions as well as the reserves of
"solid" water accumulated there.
Thus, plans for economic development
in these regions need to take into
account long-term predictions of the
behaviour of glaciers. Such pre¬
dictions can be made only on the
basis of comprehensive studies of the
mechanism that causes the fluc¬
tuations of glaciers. This is a major
task of modern glaciology the
science which studies glaciers and
other types of natural ice.
Solution of this problem calls for
the elaboration of a general theory
on the fluctuations of glaciers, a task
on which scientists in many countries,
including the Soviet Union, are now
engaged. The modern approach they
are making to this problem is through
systems of equations and mathemati¬
cal modelling with the aid of compu¬
ters. Solutions have already been
found for the simpler types of glaciers,
but we are far from resolving the
problem as a whole.
Not all the laws governing the
development of glaciers are known.
It is still difficult to answer such
questions as whether former glaciers
can reappear in the present climate
or what changes in the atmospheric
circulation may be brought about by
the partial disappearance of glaciers.
Nor, at present, can we answer the
vital question, "Is the world heading
for a new Ice Age?".
I T is quite possible that in
the lifetime of the present generation
there will be a new advance of
glaciers. During the last five to ten
years, for example, glaciers in many
mountain regions (the Caucasus, the
Alps, Scandinavia, Alaska, Central
Asia) show a tendency to advance.
But we should not regard this as
a threat to the future of our planet.
It may well be that glaciers, the
natural refrigerators of the earth, will
be absolutely indispensable to man in
the future.
The climate of the earth is primarily
conditioned by solar radiation. Yet
already, the amount the energy used
by man over large areas of industrially
developed countries is almost equal
to the amount of solar energy that
reaches these areas. And if the pro¬
duction of man-made energy continues
to increase at its present rate (almost
10 per cent per year), within a century
it will exceed the energy we receive
from the sun. That is why the advance
of the glaciers could protect us from
a different threat the overheating of
the planet.
If scientists are to foresee the
effects of glaciation on the life of
our planet, joint international research
programmes need to be carried out
in a number of fields the use of
snow and ice masses as additional
sources of fresh water, forecasting
sudden movements and variations in
glaciers, the rôle of glaciers in the
partial and overall water cycle in the
world.
The first attempts to undertake such
studies began ten years ago during
the International Geophysical Year.
The research lasted only two to three
years which was clearly too short
a time, since accurate predictions can
be made only on the basis of
long-term observations of glacier
fluctuations.
That is why the study of glaciers
an important element in the water
balance of the earth has been includ¬
ed in the programme of the Interna¬
tional Hydrological Decade organized
by Unesco from 1965 to 1974. This
research will have a direct impact
on programmes for the rational utili¬
zation and conservation of natural
resources, particularly in the develop¬
ing countries of South America and
Southern Asia where glaciers can be
an important source of fresh water.
Glaciological research in the Inter¬
national Hydrological Decade relates
to three major problems: the evalua¬
tion of polar ice and snow resour¬
ces; permanent observation of the
fluctuation of glaciers; studies of the
balance of ice, water and heat in
typical mountainous glacial basins.
Soviet scientists are actively engag¬
ed in these programmes. They are
compiling the first catalogue of gla¬
ciers in the U.S.S.R., a multi-volume
work presenting data on the size,
forms and locations of all the coun¬
try's glaciers. The Soviet Union is
also collaborating in the creation of
a permanent international glacier
service to collect data on glacier
variations throughout the world. Stud¬
ies are now being made on the
mechanism of water flow from glaciers
in seven experimental basins in the
U.S.S.R. (three in the Caucasus, three
in Central Asia and one in the Altai
region).
Joint efforts by the world's glacio-
logists will enable man not only to
predict the evolution of glaciers, but
will eventually permit him to harness
and utilize them as one of the natural
resources of his planet.

Letters to the Editor
TOURIST TRIBULATIONS
Sir,
The U.N. General Assembly desig¬
nated 1967 as "International Tourist
Year". Has it been of some practical,
worldwide benefit? Some countries have
clearly confused "tourism" with certain
endemic maladies that plague the world,
if one is to judge by their determined
efforts to stamp it out.
An exaggeration? Let me list the
number of documents a foreigner living
in one of the central African countries
has to obtain if he wishes to visit a
neighbouring country as a tourist: pass¬
port; foreign resident's identity card;
identity card and authorization to leave
the country issued by his own national
embassy; international certificate of vac¬
cination; receipts for payment of taxes
and water and electricity bills; attesta¬
tion that he has no police record;
re-entry permit; national and internation¬
al driving licences; automobile regis¬
tration and insurance certificates; tem¬
porary vehicle export licence (including
a deposit paid to the local authorities).
Sometimes he also needs an addi¬
tional travel pass stamped by "author¬
ities" with a somewhat doubtful offi¬
cial status. Finally he has to obtain a
visa not a simple matter when some
neighbouring countries have no diplo¬
matie representatives in his country of
residence.
Sad to relate, such formalities and
red tape are strictly applied. For in¬
stance, an attestation to the absence of
a police record is delivered only in
exchange for a record of the applicant's
fingerprints.
After assembling this astonishing col¬
lection of documents and ensuring that
their varying periods of validity cover
the dates of the proposed holiday, and
after the last stamp has'been applied,
the would-be tourist can hopefully set
out on his journey.

PRESERVING LAPP LANGUAGE
AND CUSTOMS
Sir.
This letter is to fulfil a promise I
made to a Laplander I visited at Vàster-
botten, Sweden, last year. Though an
Assyriologist, I take a keen interest in
the Lapps, their customs and language.
These extremely likeable people are
somewhat neglected nowadays and suf¬
fer as a result.
Per Bals, the Laplander with whom
I had long talks, is an elderly man who
has built up a museum singlehanded
with everything he could collect on his
people, their customs, implements and
so on. He is now completing a compre¬
hensive dictionary of the Lapp language
comprising words, expressions, ways of
pronunciation, etc. As far as I can
judge, he has compiled it with great
care, but I believe he is unable to raise
enough money in his own country for
its publication.
Can this be treated as an ethnic prob¬
lem, as much as a linguistic one, trans¬
cending the national level, and possibly
coming within the scope of Unesco's
activities? Could something be done
internationally to help the Lapps? And
how can Per Bals be encouraged to
continue his work? His address is: Per
Bals, i Vilasunds Vasterbotten, Sweden.

BLIND SPOT IN
PLANETARY MANAGEMENT
Sir,
Bravo for your "planetary manage¬
ment" issue (January 1969). There
seems, however, to be one very im¬
portant blind spot in your coverage of
the problems. How could a modern
city function without a telephone direc¬
tory and a central exchange? How could
a factory function if no one knew the
relationship between the activities of
different departments? Although we have
a fairly good estimate each year of
the population breakdown of our Global
City, we do not know how many organ¬
izations and other bodies there are
(one to two million?), what they do,
or how they interact. We live in a
Global City with a thousand specializ¬
ed, unplanned, out-of-date telephone
directories to discourage us from trying
to communicate and co-ordinate with
other bodies, or manage the problems
which particularly concern us. We
cannot see the trees and shrubs, let
alone the wood, because of our concen¬
tration on the leaves.

JUDGING MODERN JAPAN
Sir,
Your issue marking Japan's century of
change since the Meiji Restoration
(September-October 1968) did not show
life in Japan or its people in true per¬
spective. Few people in Japan today
regard Emperor Meiji as the Father of
Modern Japan because he was almost
a puppet emperor backed up by nation¬
alists and royalists of Satsuma-Choshu
han (who set up the first central govern¬
ment). By the Constitution they them¬
selves drew up they made almost a
monarch of the emperor. Then in the
name of Ten-no (the Emperor) they
and their successors launched their
notorious imperialistic policy.
One good feature of the policy was
that it protected the country against
colonialism, but their ultranationalism
forced the people to become subservient
to the State and later led Japan into
a war of totalitarian aggression.
After the Second World War, we
set up a democratic government, but
the spirit of democracy is not yet root¬
ed among us, and education in demo¬
cratic principles is still imperfect. Indiv¬
idual human rights are often infringed
and violated. We have only just start¬
ed on this road.
Japanese civilization as seen by the
world is not always representative of
Japan's general social civilization. We
have not yet reached the point from
where we can judge or appraise modern
Japan.

FULL OF SOUND AND FURY...
Sir,
I admire the exceedingly good quality
of articles and photography in your mag¬
azine, but I object to the pusillanimous
variety of letters in your correspondence
page. These often reveal nothing of
interest except the world-wide reader¬
ship of the magazine. In most English
newspapers or magazines letters pub¬
lished are usually of a strongly inform¬
ative character or present rational
arguments on topical ideological con¬
flicts. I think you should pursue the
same approach, or else use the space
for further articles. Let the magazine
speak for itself, which it can competent¬
ly do.

VENICE TODAYAND
TOMORROW
Sir,
"Is Venice condemned to collapse?"
asked the German language edition of
the "Unesco Courier", to which I sub¬
scribe, in its December 1968 issue.
To my way of thinking the answer to
this question is the radical one of stop¬
ping off the sea flooding by sluice gates
and the pumping out of the internal
canal system, making Venice a normal
city with dry roadways. Prior to filling
in, the canal trench system would be
provided with sanitational piping, elec¬
tric power cables, etc. After a drying
out period the foundations of the build¬
ings might presumably be strengthened
by pumping in cement.
The curse of Venice is water and the
decay produced through damp. Any¬
one seeing what has happened to the
Palazzo Garzoni (colour photo in your
issue) since the start of this century
can answer the plain question: "What's
up with Venice?" DAMP.

Soviet prize
to promote literacy
The Government of the Soviet Union
has offered a prize of 5,000 roubles (about
$5,000) for the promotion of Unesco's
compaign against illiteracy. This was
announced by Professor Serguei L. Tikh-
vinsky, representative of the U.S.S.R. on
Unesco's Executive Board, at its meeting
in Paris last month. The prize is to be
called the Krupskaya Prize, after Nad-
jexda Krupskaya, widow of Lenin and a
Vice-Minister of Education in the U.S.S.R.
The Soviet Government is also offering
1,000,000 copy books for use in literacy
work.
International aid
for Borobudur
Unesco has received money and equip¬
ment totalling $22,000 to be used in the
restoration and preservation of Borobudur
in Java, one of the most important monu¬
ments of the Southern Hemisphere (See
the "Unesco Courier", June 1968). The
Netherlands has pledged $15,000 for pre¬
liminary surveys, Bremen (Fed. Rep. of
Germany) is donating $3,000 for photo¬
graphic documentation, and the JDR III Fund
is contributing scientific instruments worth
$4,000. The total cost of engineering and
archaeological work to be done at Boro¬
budur is estimated at $4 million.
The romance of water
The story of the world's creation, and
of man, is to a great extent the story of
water. This story is told in layman's
terms in "The Romance of Water" by
Herbert Wendt (see Bookshelf). The book
covers oceanography, glaciology, the evolu¬
tion and proliferation of life and the central
rôle water has played in world history.
Unesco team to survey
Acropolis
A Unesco team of specialists is to
make a photogrammetrical survey of the
Acropolis in Athens. The survey will
help the Greek Antiquities Service to
formulate plans for the conservation and
restoration of monuments on the Acropo¬
lis (see the "Unesco Courier", June 1968),
and for the integration of the site into
development projects for central Athens.
'Paper' boat for Atlantic
crossing
Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian explorer
who led the Kon Tiki expedition on a 5,000
mile voyage by balsa wood raft across
the South Pacific 22 years ago, plans to
cross the Atlantic in a boat made of
papyrus. He will sail with a crew of seven
from Safi, Morocco and expects to land
in Central America two to three months
later. The boat, 45 ft. by 15 ft., will be
a replica of the ancient Egyptian "paper
vessels". Heyerdahl aims to show that
people from ancient Mediterranean civili¬
zations could have made the journey in
similar boats, and that cultural imports
from the Old World may thus have influenc¬
ed Central American civilization.

brings to the public at large as well as the
expert perhaps the most original and lu¬
xuriously presented archaeology magazine
available today. Sold chiefly by subscription,
"Archaeologia Viva" contains a unique
documentation written by leading inter¬
national specialists and illustrations in co¬
lour and black and white on unfamiliar or
little-known aspects of the world's ar¬
chaeological treasures, much of it drawn
from the reserves of the world's great
museums inaccessible to the public and
from private collections. The first two
issues deal with Iran and Tunisia (Carthage)
respectively. Future issues will treat Leba¬
non, Cyprus, Afghanistan and Spain. For
full information write to "Archaeologia Vi¬
va", 27 rue Saint-Andrè-des-Arts, Paris 6e,
France. (Annual subscription: UK. £11.12 0,
U.S A. and Canada $27.50; single issues
£3.8.0, $8 50).
Flashes...
Industry in the developing countries of
Asia grew 26 per cent between 1963
and 1967.
The importance of protecting the envir¬
onment in industrial countries will be the
theme of the joint Scandinavian pavilion
at the World Exhibition in Osaka, Japan
in 1970.
Europe's first poster museum, with
16,000 exhibits, has been opened near
Warsaw, Poland.
Only two-fifths of school age children
complete primary school in developing
countries, reports Unicef.
A Centre for the Improvement and
Demonstration of Olive Growing Techniques
has been established in Cordoba, Spain
by the U.N. and FAO. With 150 million
trees, Spain is the world's major olive oil
producer.
Spacecraft fish-spotters
Spacecraft, using electronic sensors and
photographic equipment to detect shoals
of fish, could tell fishing vessels at sea
where to cast their nets, says an FAO
report. While orbiting the earth, a space¬
craft spends three quarters of its time
over oceans.
Red Cross League
214 million strong
This year, the 50th anniversary of its
foundation, the League of Red 'Cross So¬
cieties embraces 111 national Red Cross,
Red Crescent, and Red Lion and Sun
Societies with a total membership of 214
million (one person out of ewery 12 in
the world). The League was organized
to link the different national societies
which had grown from the original Red
Cross movement founded in 1863 by
Henri Dunant in Switzerland (see the
"Unesco Courier", June 1963). As co¬
ordinating agency for international Red
Cross activities, it is especially active in
the fields of disaster relief, health and
social services, nursing and youth work.

GRACEFUL MUSIC OF KOREA
Beauty and goodness, the two cardinal vir¬
tues taught by Confucius, characterize the
"graceful music" born in China more than
2,000 years ago and brought to Korea seven
or eight centuries ago. The music has been
handed down almost unchanged to the pre¬
sent day. Here, women musicians in Seoul
play a traditional melody on the kayageum,
a 12-stringed instrument made of paulownia
wood (see article p. 26 and photo story p. 28).
