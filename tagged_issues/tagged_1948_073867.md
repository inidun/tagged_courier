General view of Beirut, site of Third Session of Unesco's General Conference scheduled to open this month.
Dr. HUXLEY'S SUGGESTIONS FOR :
The Advance
Of World Civilization','
Just before this issue of the"Courier"was to go to press, he
editors received an advance copy of the Introduction written by Dr.
Julian Huxley, Director-General, to his annual report on the activities
of the Organization in 1948. This Intcoduction is the personal report
of Dr. Huxley. Below, our readers will find large extracts from this
highly stimulating and provocative statement.
lrHls is my personal report,
which the Executive Board
through its Chairman will
present to the General Con-
ference.
It IS once again my own view
of what Unesco has done-a
gleam row the dark and disturbed
waters of the world today-and
of what, given good leadership
and some luck, it may yet
achieve-a stilling of the waters
to a peace In which they might
ceflect the glory of the mind's
inheritance for generations yet to
come.
I make no apology for writing
freely of my : aith in the im-
mense service which this Organ-
ization might render to human-
ity : otherwise I would not be
here. As I hand over the reins,
I have felt bound to affirm and
set down, for comment and ap-
praisal. what the work has meant
to me.
In writing this report..., I have
wished to present not only a
resume of the events of 1948, but
some general appraaal of the
Organization in the present state
of its existence, together with
some evaluation 0 : its programme.
While such an evaluation must,
of necessity, be a purely personal
oM. in the majority of cases the
views expressed have esther the
explicit backing of the Con-
ference. Or its implicit approvaL
The first fact to be remembered
is the extreme youthfulness of
Unesco. As a definitive Organ-
ization, it is, at the time this
report goes to press, only 21
months old ; and its effective
operation dates back only to a
year and a half, to the time when
the first programme and budget
was agreed upon in April 1947.
While much can be surmounted
by goodwill, time and practice, it
is prohably true that, : n tne
present state of the world, no
international staff can hope to
attain quite the same degree of
efficient co-operation that is pos-
sible to a homogeneous group
(although of course the heterog-
eneity provides the necessary
: oundation for our ultimate
ideal-an international group
welded into a unified team).
I would also remind my readers
that Unesco has so far been
operating in a period of unusual
political tension and financial
stringency.
Any new organization, es-
pecially a large international one
of great complexity and novel
type such as Unesco, will find
itself in its first years much
preoccupied with problems of ad-
ministration and internal organ-
ization. While Unesco still has
many such preoccupations. I
think it fair to say that it has
now passed a critic : ail point in Its
development. While 1947 was
spent largely in trial and error.
experiment and even sometimes
improvisation, 1948 has seen the
emergence of a more dye : incite
structure and assured cont : nuity
of operation.
Work in Germany
An important innovation in
1948 has been the extension of
Unesco's activities to Germany.
and the decision of the Executive
to recommend to the Conference
their further extension to Japan.
There has not u : : matUraJlv been
a good deal of difficulty in agree-
ing on a programme for Germa-
ny. the nationals of some countries
wishing Unesco to go much more
slowly. those of others, much
faster. A certain fact must be
remembered. This is not oar of
our reconstruction campaign : we
are undertaking work in Ger-
many. not for Germany. We are
attempting a reorientation of the
Germaas towards'democracy and
against all forms of aggressive
nationalism and isolationism.

and programme of work for
the General Conference. The
provisional agenda, which the
Executive Board has worked

briefly. as follows :
The opening ceremony will
take place at three o'clock in
the afternoon of November 7
in Beirut, with the Head of l1e
Mexican delegation priding.
Prior to this, at 11 a. do. out the
same day, there-will be a for-
mal ceremony of welcome ar-
ranged by the Lebanese Gov-
ernmen t.
Following the adoption of
the agenda of the conference.
the delegates will elect the
President and the Vice-Presi-
dents of the Third Session.
The Conference will then
consider recommendations of
the Executive Board on the
admission of new Members.
Three Commissions will then
be established for one of the
most important jobs of the
Conference :

### 73871: Middle East Cultural Liaison Office proposed
2 UNESCO COURIER November 1948
Conference in Lebanon
(Continued from Page 1)
Information received 80 far indicates
that the delegations will be composed of
some of the outstanding world's spokesmen
in the fields of education, science and
culture. Belgium and Afghanistan are
sending their Ministers of Education as
their chief envoys. The United Kingdom
delegation will be headed by the Partia-
mentary Secretary at the Ministry ot
Middle East Cultural
Liaison Office Proposed
WHEN the Third Session of the General Conference of Unesco meets. ill Beuuton November 17th, it will have before it a proposal from the Executive Board
on the representation of Unesco in the main cultural areas of the world. One such
ar"a is the Middle East, and the proposal urges the creation of a Cultural Liaison
Office for that area.
, ThIs suggestion tames with the choice of the Middle East as the venue of the
Conference : :'01'. by meeting in a different place each year, Unesco arouses interest
in its work among the people of that and neighbouring areas and thereby helps its
activities to spread-
Telling evidence of this can be seen in the fact that the meeting of last year'3
conference in Mexico has resulted I

Secretariat.
America, on the other. Today, the
countries and people of Latin
America follow closely the work
of Unesco and contribute to the
development of its activities.
Similarly, the Middle East pre-
sents a two-fold interest to Unes-
co Just as Unesco presents a
multifarious interest to the Gov-
ernments and peoples of the
Middle East
As far as Unesco is concerned,
one experiment has already pro-
duced sufficiently good results to
warrant the encouragement of
cultural liaison throughout the
Middle East. The Unesco Field
Science Co-operation Office which
has been functioning in Cairo for
over a year, has done valuable
work in bringing Middle East
sCientists within the orbit of in-
ternational science and putting
within their reach the wealth of
world knowledge.
Similarly, a Cultural Liaison
Office if voted by the General
Conference, would be called upon
to play a leading role in the
development and spread of educa-
tion and culture. Although the
Arabs are heirs to one of the
world's great culturar"possessions,
handed down to them over cen-
turies of eventful history, they
find themselves today striving
vigorously for a cultural rebirth
WhICh twentieth-century condi-
tions generally, and their aloof-
ness and isolation from the rest
of the world, render more diffi-
cult. This aim can. consequently,
be brought nearer to realization
through international co-opera-
tion.-which is where Unesco can
help.
In such countries as Egypt and
Iraq, where the illiteracy rate is
high. the problem facing the na-
tional education authorities is a
very hea\7 one. It is. naturally,
their concern in the first place.
But it 15 undeniable that in co-
operation with Unesco they can
find solutions to their difficulties,
through the technical assistance
which the Organization can make
available, in the same way as the
Field Science Co-operation Offices
arp oegmning to do.
It must be made clear that
Unesco does not and cannot
substitute itself for national
administrative bodies, or interfere
in their affairs. It can only
arrange for expert help and
advice to be provided when it is
needed, making the best ex-
perience of one country available
to another. This task should be
made easier thanks to the Arab
League Cultural Committee, which
since its formation two years ago
has done much to bring about
closer ties between the Arab Gov-
ernments in the cultural fie1l ; l
In view of all these considera-
tions. the Executive Board of
Unesco decided to define the
responsibility of the proposed
Cultural Liaison Office for the
Middle East as follows :"To pro-
mote the exchange of ideas, in-
formation, materials and persons
in the fields of arts, letters, philo-
sophy and humanistic studies"
The small staff to be assigned
to this task. if the Cultural Off-
ice IS approved, would initially
spend several months at Unesco
House in Paris and then travel
throughout the Middle East. No
fixed regional office is con-
templated at this stage.
In addition to this experimental
undertaking, the Executive Board
also proposes to appoint, in areas
to be determined by the General
Conference, one or two regional
representatives who will main-
tain liaison with the Govern-
ments and National Commis-
sions. distribute information on
the activities of Uneseo. and
represent Unesco at conferences
and meetings convened by the UN
and other agencies, in those
areas.
Should these new activities of
Unesco be sanctioned by the Gen-
eral Conference, there is no doubt
that a step forward will have
been take spreading understand-
ing and interchange of culture in
a world which needs such action
to achieve the goal of One World.

Cairo Meeting
The World Enginering Con-
ference (WEC), one of the in-
ternational organizations en-
joying consultative status with
Unesco, is calling a second In-
ternational Technical Con-
gress in Cairo during March,
1949, following an invitation
extended by the Egyptian Gov-
ernment.
The Conference,'which will
be devoted to the main subject
of Raw Materials as an Indus-
trial and Social Problem, wilt
study three problems :
Industrial raw materials
and their rational utilization
throughout the world : social
aspects of technical develop-
ment and of raw material pro-
blems ; and the problem of
water in the Middle East
It is expected that the Cairo
Congress will furnish ome
basic information, in its study
of water, on one of the cru-
cial problems of the Middle
East. Irrigation, drainage na-
vigation, drinking water and
artificial rain will be some of
the problems discussed at the
meetings.
The Executive Board of
WEC has borne in mind that
the Economic and Social Coun-
cll of the UN is calling an
International Scientific Con-
ference on Conservation and
Utilization of Resources
(UNSCCUR) in the USA in
June 1949, The programme of
the Cairo Congress has been
established so as to complement
the UNSCCUR programme.

### 73873: A Philosopher looks at Arab literature among world classics
### 73872: Spotlight on Arab thought: Taha Hussein calls UNESCO "common man-elite link"
November 1948 UNESCO COURIER 3
SPOTLIGHT ON ARAB THOUGHT
Taha Hussein Calls Unesco
,"Common Man-Elite Link"
A S the month of November of
A'-thus year draws to a close,
the Arab World will witness
in Beirut a great festival of cul-
ture never before equalled in all
its glorious and far-reaching his-
tory.
The Arab peoples have not for-
gotten the cultural meetings
which they held centuries ago, in
their market-places-meetings
which paved they way for the
union of the Arab nation. Nor are
thy unaware of the fact that
other ancient nations used to
hold similar cultural meetings
which gave similar results.
The Arab World knows that,
.. although the effect of these meet-
ings was limited, yet, at the same
time, they helped to create na-
tional unity on the one hand and,
on the other, emphasized the in-
dividual characteristics of each
nation and defined the frontiers
between them.
These meetings, making nations
conscious of their individuality,
gave them self-confidence and
helped them to realize what distin-
guished them from others. Thus,
they were at the same time a
source of unity and of separation.
Owing to them, the Arabs began,
at the end of the pre-islamic period
(called the"Age of Ignorance"),
to realize their own importance,
and they felt the differences be-
tween themselves and their neigh-
bours just as the Greeks, owing
to their Academies, learned what
ties ìinked together their various
cities and realized at the same
time what distinguished them
from other nations and commun-
ities.
Cultural Festivals
Besides, the Arab World is no
stranger to the congresses to
which mankind is to-day ac-
cuswmed and. which are held
from time to time to examine
varied problems : political, lite-
rary, philosophical or artistic
congresses. Nevertheless, the
Arab World felt that these con-
gresses, owing to their composi-
tion and their particular aim,
were not of general or universal
interest but were limited to spe-
cialists in certain realms of know-
ledge or in certain branches of
art or political and social science.
The Arab World wok part in
these congresses, often held In
Europe and America, and some-
times in their own land. But
never in their own land has a
festival of culture been seen on
so large a scale and so extern. slave
in its aims as that which they
will attend in Beirut.
The Unesco session which is to
hold its conferences In Beirut this
year, is neither a cultural con-
gress such as those of old. which
had to unite on one hand and
divide on the other ; nor is it a
scientific, artistic or political
congress such as those which the
modem world has witnessed and
the direct benefit of which is ex-
clusively limited to specialist and
only effects na tion. ; indirecLly.
It is rather a cultural and human
assembly in the widest sense of
these two words :"cultural"be-
cause it is not composed of spe-
cialists in one particular science,
but of all those who are dis-
tinguished in different branches
of culture ; and"human"smce
it is not composed of those wno
represent a particular country or
different countries united by
common interests and common
aims. but is composed of men
who represent the cultural circles
of all the nations of the world.
Moreover, it does
not aim, in its con-
ferences to examine
only limited pro-
blems of science or
art ; its object is
something more
extensive and of
a deeper purport :
that is, the realiza-
tion of co-opera-
tion amongst vari-
ous nations in all
matters concerning
the intellect, the
heart and the con-
science of man-
kind.
Thus, this Organ-
ization IS uniting
nations that are
divided, drawing
nearer those who
want to live apart,
'trying to help them
to live and think in
closer relationship
with others, and to
abolish differences
and discord as far
as is in its power.
The aim of the ancient cultural
"market-gatherings"in Arabia.
was to try to unite one nation,
but this new Organization is
endeavouring to unite all human-
ity.
* * *
It is true that the Institute of
Intellectual Co-operat ; on of the
League of Nations had already
tried, between the last two wars,
to perform the task which Unesco
is trying nowadays to accomplish.
But its efforts were weak because
its means were. limited. as it did
not enjoy the same independence,
power and financial facilities as
Unesco.
In spite of its meagre privilege.
however, the previous organiza-
tion succeeded to a certain extent
in drawing together nations sep-
arated by discord and in achiev-
ing a significaat degree of cultur-
al co-operation. It founded the
Committee of Arts and Letters, a
body, which organized meetings
every year in a different capaal
of Europe. t0 examine the cultur-
al problems of that time. But
those meetings, and discussions.
remained narrow and limited so
that they did not go beyond the
distinguished intellectual leaders
and reach the general public.
Reaching
the Man-in-the-Street
Unesco, on the contrary, has
attached great importance, ever
since its foundation, to gettmg in
touch with the man-in-the-treet,
much more than with an intel-
lectual elite ; or rather, it has
laboured to create a solid and
fruitful link between that intel-
lectual elite and the general pu-
blic. This link allows leaders of
culture to study problems of in-
terest to all individuals, aad
helps the public to profit fully
by these ideas.
The Committee of Arts and

Unesco is fixed in Paris through
its permanent Organization, but
by its action and its public meet-

world.
Moreover, when Unesco meets
in a particular country, it
achieves two considerable aims :
it, encourages different forms of
cultural co-operation between
governments and scientific, lite-
rary or artistic bodies : and it
narrows the gap which often
separates the man-in-the-street
from the technical exoert and
the intellectual specialist.
Thus, it is not strange that
Unesco and these who support it
or seek its protection in a dir3ct
or indirect way should be striving
for that peace amongst nations
which may, at the moment, seem
too difficult of fulfilment, but
which is without doubt possible
if genuine collaboration based on
goodwill and sincere understand-

A PHILOSUPHER LOOK5 AT
Arab Literature
AmonQ Wor ! d Classics
 s
A\S
A S already reflected by Arabic journals and reviews, the inter-
'national cultural event in Beirut this month awakens 111 the
Arab peoples distant memorIes of the cultural festivals of
"Okaz", perhaps the first e, over held, when in the pre-Islam cra the
nomad tribes of Arabia met annually to appreciate and gauge the
genius of their respective poets.
A typical Middle East landmark : toe mmaret.
In these annual literary com-
peitions and in other circum-
stances, many of the poets com-
posed their verse extempore. This
was the so-called Era of Igno-
rance, because no written alpha-
bet yet existed. Poets of all
beliefs, pagans, Christians and
Jews, thus produced the first
literary masterpieces in the Arab
tongue ; they were mcomparable
in their chiselled perfection of
form'and classic style. Outstand-
ing among all these works were
the at-Mouallakat", odes.
Here we have Arab literature
in all its purity, free of foreign
mfluences. Those who know it
best, Orientalists, ar firmly con-
vinced of the importance of
making it known
alongside the
world's classics.
Unesco is work-
ing in this di-
rection in its
plans for a wid-
er diffusion of
would classics.
It is not possible here to give
an outline of Arab literature,
which one of the richest and
oldest and stiU one of the most
crcative in the world. Let us limit
ourselves, therefore, to some of
the features of the second great
period of Arab literature, the Is-
lamic Period.
The Islamic Period
The coming of Islam gave an
enormous impetus to Arab lite-
rature. Was not the exceptional
eloquence of the Koran the one
"miracle"of the Prophet ? No
doubt it suited the mentality of
nomadic tribes who felt them-
selves to be poets. Its influence
was therefore very strong. But un-
like the purely Arab age of"Igno-
rance", the Islamic period was
genuinely"international" ; it was
also truly"humanistic"in the
sense that it assimilated the val-
ues, ideals and knowledge of the
finest civilizations of the past.
Internationalism and humanism
are the two points of contact be-
tween Unesco's aims and Arab
culture. That culture is already
tinged with universalism, so that
Unesco's beneficent influence in
this part or me
world will be tht
most easily exer-
ted.
After the spread
of the new religion,
the nomads, who
had become civil-
ized citizens of
large towns extend-
ing from China to
the Atlantic, re-
vealed great under-
standing for other
civilizations and an
extraordinary ca-
paucity to assimilate
their values. In-
dian. Persian.
Egyptian. Greek
and Roman culture
filtered in side by
side. and formed
the civilization hen-
ceforth to be call-
ed"Moslem"rather
than"Arab". The
only Arab element
is the instrument
of thought, the
Arabic language,
which thereby be-
came one of the
first international
languages.

ness of this litera-
ture, which urges

or 600 books,
many of them consisting of 10. 20
or 30 volumes. These classics will
occupy a most important place
among the others, once they are
made known in foreign langua-
ges.
Some of the g :'eat llterary
works of this period were either
translated from foreign langua-
ges Or written partly in popular
Arabic. An example is"KaJila
and Dimna", translated by Ibnul-
Mokafaa from Sanskrit. Never in
the history of Arabic has literary
style reached such a degree of
clarity and nobility as in this
writer.
The above-mentioned work,
which is a collection of fables,
fully deserves a distinguished
place among world classics, be-
cause unlike those of Aesop and
La Fontaine, these fables are
composed as syntheses in novel
form, and not as fragmentary
Mtecdotes. The characters are
human beings, animals being
Used only to personify human
qualities.
The writings in popular Arabic
Include the Arabian Nights and
al-Mouachahat of Andalusia. The
latter poems, which break with
the traditional rules of Arab ver-
sification, are specially suitable
for translation, owing to the light
they throw on the origins of
French literature (the Trouba-
dours).
Modern Arab Literature
Modern Arab literature dates
from the end of the nineteenth
century. The Lebanese, who were
already more conversant with
European culture, were pioneers
in the movement. Men such as al-
Bustani, al-Yazidji, Zidan and
Matran, were the first of the
modernists. But it is in Egypt
that modernism is bearing its
fruit and being fostered. More
familiar with the Arab classics,
through the existence of the Un-
iversity of Al-Azhar. and at the
same time strongly attracted
towards European culture, this
country has produced famous
writers such as Ismail Sabry,
Chawki (prince of poets) Hafez,
al-Manfalouti, Taha Hussein, al-
Akkad, Hussein Haikal, Taimour
and Tawfik el Hakim, whose
works are celebrated throughout
the Arab world and who in-
troduced new themes and forms
unthought of in earlier periods.
Cairo has thus become he

part of the world. The printmg-
works of Cairo, Beirut, and other
intellectual centres are constantly

YEAR'S ROUNDUP OF UNESCO ACT
.,-.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
RECONSTRUCTION
'"It is estimated that by the end of 1948 over S50. 000, 000 will have
been distributed in educational relief by various bodies, in most cases
in response to Unesco's campaign for educational reconstruction.
Furthrmore, nearly $400, 000 will have been expended out of Unesco
funds for emergency equipment"writes Dr. Huxley in his arnual
report on the activities of Unesco during the current year. This
report which has just been published has served as the basis for the
"Year Roundup"wbich we are presenting on this page.
IN order to advance educational,scientific and cultural recon-
struction in the war-devastated
countries, Unesco has been
working during 1948, with the
organs of the UN and other
Specialized Agencies and with
international non-governmental
bodies by providing the Secreta-
riat for TICER. Unesco has col-
lected and analyzed evid< : nce of
needs and s : imulated campaigns
for voluntary aid. It has provided
books, materials and equipment
to a limited extent through emer-
gency grants, and aided in etab-
lishing national book exchange
centres. It has worked with
organizations on the educational
problems of war-handicapped
children and on voluntary work
camps.
This year, for example. the
Director-General points out in
his annual report to the General
Conference that"members of the
Secretariat have undertaken field
surveys of educational, scientific
and cultural needs in Burma.
China, India. Malava. Sarawak.
North Borneo, the Philippines
and Malta".
'"The Governments of Austria,
Belgium, Burma, China. Czecho-
slovakia, France, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Netherlands. Pakistan and
the Philippines have submitted...
data on war-damaged schools.

and other cultural institu"ons."
This information has been
analyzed, prepared In document
form and distributed to mter-
ested Member S : ates and nation-
al organizat : ons active in edu-
cational reconstruction.
"In consultation with Unesco",
the Director-General rewets.
"the Provisional Commission of
the IRO currently is investigating
the educational needs of displaced
persons in Germany. Aus'ria and
Italy."
Campaign aids
During the current year.
Unesco has continued to produce
materials suitable for naTIonal
campaigns. These include the
second volume of the"book'of
needs", to be published before
the end of 1948 ; the monthly
"Reconstruction Newsletter"in
English, French and Spanish :
illustrated pamphlets such as
"The Universities in Need".
published in Ausust, and"Impro-
visations in the Teaching of
Science".
In addition, a (iocumeIJtarv
film on the reconstruction of
universities (in production icintlv
with the World Student Fund) is
to be released before the end of
the year.
A series of radio broadcas : s on

tion (CIER) has distributed edu-
cational supplies, books, period-
cals. fellowships and study grants
estimated at $39, 714. 400 in 1947
and $43, 098. 400 in 1948.

Voluntary Work Camps
During the current year,
Unesco furnished 250 to 300 books
on international subif'ct to
27 camps in eleven countries. A
conference of voluntary work
camp organizations was held in
Unesco House in April 1948 to
discuss proposals of the TICER

their value in international

July.
Clearing House of Books
Referring to the Importance
of collecting accurate inform-
tion on needs and sources of
supply of publication, Dr. Huxley
states :
"One of the main factors
enabling Unesco to carry ou'this
function successfully is the pub-
lication and distribution of the
Unesco Bulletin for Libraries. The
Bulletin is now a well-established
mternational library service. It
has been issued everv tor. month
since April, 1947, contains 40
pages, is bi-lingual and is discl'l-
buted... to about 6, 500 institu-
tions."
The file of periodicals, offered
or wanted, for free distrihution or
exchange, now covers aproxima-
tely 3, 440 titles. By mid-July 545
sets of scientific periodicals (com-
prising about 4, 466 volumes), and
20, 644 miscellaneous publication
were allocated bv Unesco'0 war-
hit libraries.
A SHIFT o* emphasis has taken place progressively this year.
` Thus the main undertaking of Unesco in Education is a
clearing-house acivity.'Tt i-3 felt". Dr. Huxley reports."that by creating a central service
to provide technical information and advice on education at all
levels, and by publicizing new and interesting national achievements
in all parts of the world, educa--,
A'
tional advance will be renjered I
not only more rapid, but more
of an international venture, and
new standards will graduaHy be
set up."
Fundamental Education
"This policy", Dr. Huxley con-
tiImEs,"has been especially
emphasized in Fundamental Edu-
cation".
'A programme is being submit-
ted for 1949", the Director-Gener-
al reveals,"that will give
increased emphasis to central
clearing-house services. It m<\y be
necessary to consider afri'sh, in
the light of this year's experience,
what are the most valuahle con-
tributions that Unesco can make
to a pilot project".
"Our general ! policy is now
becoming increasing4r devoted to
encouraging Member States to

"I. i Natural Sciences", Dr. Huxley writes,"perhaps the most
outstanding event has been the establishment of the first inter-
national regional research institute under the auspices of a UN
organizations in the shape of the Institute of the Hylean Amazon, to
undertake research and surveys on problems of the wet tropics

were agreed upon, and an Interim
Commission set up, with head-
quarters at Manaus. Preliminary
pilot surveys for the Institute are
now being undertaken by Unesco
in the Rio Huallaga."
Field Science Co-operation
Offices
"The Principle of regional field
offices", the Director-General re-
ports,"has justified itself, and is
beginning to yield valuable re-
sults in raising the level of scien-
tific activity in the regions con-
cerned, as well as setting a
pattern for field operation in
other domains"
* Latin America : Occupied
chiefly with creation of Hylean

has continued to make various
contacts in me region, and has
participated in the expert confer-
ence held in Montevideo under
the joint sponsorship of Unesco
and the Government of Uruguay,
which has made important re-
commendations on the develop-

"As in 1947, a considerable sum
was set aside for grants-in-aid to
ICSU (the International Council

constituent bodies.
"The field of medical science is
one which interests both Unesco
and WHO. In this joint activity
considerable progress has been
made, in regard to the interna-
tional co-ordination of Medical
Science Abstracting and of Medi-
cal Science Congresses."
Preservation of Nature
The international Union for the
Protection of Nature was founded
at a conference called by the
French Government in September
and October. A Unesco Technical
Conference on this subject is
scheduled to follcw the UNSCCUR
conference in May 1949.
World Centre
Of Scientific Liaison
In 1948, Unesco continued its
clearing-house activities. Requests
+'nor assistance range from informa-
tion on new indexes of : nathe-
matical tables for vitamins and
chemical compounds to questions
from scientific institutions on
how to set up a microfilm unit.
"Within its limited resources",
Dr. Huxley points out."Unesco is
developing an information centre
on scientific apparatus to answer
enquiries from the Field Science
Co-operation Offices and else-

atus are available."
juncts in this and other fields".
Higher and Adult Education
A) Work with Universities : Uni-
versities conference held in
Utrecht, Netherlands, during
August."It was. possible". Dr.
Huxley writes,"to shed light
from many different angks on
the problems besetting universi-
ties in all Darts of the world The
success of the discussions encou-
raged the Conference to take
preliminary steps towards sitting
up a permanent international
organization of Universities. This
will be of the greatest importance
by Viking Fund (anthropological
- work) and Rockefeller Founda-
tion (develop use of visual edu-
cation techniques in Fundamen-
tal education). WHO and FAO
agreed to co-operate with Unesco
and Haitian Government. Presi-
dent of Haiti invited UN to make
survey of economic, agricultural,
health and educational tondi-
tions of whole country. Unesco
representative appointed to UN
team.
"The most important conclu-
sion coming out of the prelimin-
ary investigations was that the
Haiti Project was a long-term
one which could not be expected
to show results of permanent
value in less than five to ten
years", the Director-General
reports.
"The idea", he continues,"that
the UN and its Specialized Agen-
cies might undertake a combined
project in Haiti opens up very
interesting possibilities".
2) China : Unesco consultant
advising general fundamzntal
education programmes of the
Chinese Government, co-ordinat-
ing efforts of several agencies,
Chinese, international and for-
eign.
3) East Africa : project going

4) Peru : development of rural
arts and crafts to raise social
and economic level of population.
Mexican sociologist with a know-
ledge of art, sent to Peru by
Unesco to make survey and
determine advisability for a full-
scale pilot project.
Educational Seminars
"Among Unesco's most suc-
cessful activities in 1948", Dr.
Huxley states,"are to be reckoned
the three educational Seminars
in Czechoslovakia, the U. K.
and the U. S. A.". These were :
Childhood Education, Education
and Training of Teachers and
Teaching about the U. N. and its
Agencies (the lastnamed arranged
in co-operation with UN). In
addition the Pan-American Union
was aided in organizing a region-
al Seminar on the Educational
Problems of Latin America
"Unesco has, by means of thp
Seminars", states Dr. Huxley
"acquired unique experience in a
method of international co-opera-
tion that is
still novel."

Created in 1948
During 1948, Unesco helped
the creation of a number
of important international
non-governmental organi-
zations, in specialized fields,
such as those of Universi-
ties, Political Science, Men-
tal Health, Sociology, Eco-
nomics, Scientific, Abstract-
ing.
Other important organiza-

Studies, the International
Theatre Institute, the In-
ternational Union for the
Protection of Nature.
achievements
In the Social Sciences
II N the Social Sciences,"themost important single ad-
vance in 1948", writes Dr.
Huxley in his annual report,"has
been made in re : ation to the
Tensions Project... representative
research organizations in the
field of public opinion are con-
ducting surveys designed to bring
out the ideas of the genera ! public
in various na. ions, on their own
country and culture and those
of other nations... Special men-
tion must be made of the first
International Congress on Mental
Health, which Unesco attended
and to which it made a con-
siderable financial contribution.
Continuing co-operation is assur-
ed with the permanent-body set
up, the World Federation for
Mental Health".
Unesco's activities in this field
may be briefly summarized as
follows :
Tensions Affecting
International Understanding
1. Pilot Monographs of"Way
of Life"in France, Norway,
Poland and Switzerland are being
prepared. To be published in En-
glish and French, and If possible
in language of country concerned.
Work carried out in collaboration
with International Studies Con-
ference (ISO.
2. Surveys of adult populations
to determine their concepts of
their own and other nation are
being conducted by public opinion
institutes in Argentina, Australia,
Belgium, China, France, Hungary,
Italy, Norway, UK and USA.
3. Techniques for changing
mental attitudes : Memoranda
have been prepared by I
Freud, the New Education Fellow-'
ship (USA), the Tavistock Ins-
titute of Human Relations (UK),
the Danish Folk High School, t. he
International School of Geneva,
the Jung Institute (Switzerland),
and ten research groups in the
U. S. working jointly.
4. Aggressive Nationalism : In
July, psychologists, sociologists,
psychiatrists, psychoanalysts irom
Brazil, France, Hungary. Norway,
UK and USA met to discuss in-
fluences encouraging aggressive
tendencies. 1, 500-word unanimous
statement issued and widely dis-
tributed by Unesco.
Secretariat has prepared memo-
randa on the cultural assimila-
tion of immigrants, and the ef-
fects of education on the occu-
pational structure of countries.
Methods in Political Science
1. Preparatory work for sympo-
sium in 1949. Collection of papers
during 1948 written by outstand-
ing scholars on standards and
methods employed in current po-
litical science.
2. Preliminary work for propos-
ed International Political Science
Association.
Preparatory work in 1948 on
promotion of groups in Member
States to discuss social implica-
tions of science. Suggested sub-
jects : tele-communications, avia-
tion, scientific Improvements in
agriculture, substitute products in
applied chemistry and genetics.
Mass Communications
"The main new feature in the
field of Mass Communications",
the Director-General states in his
annual report,"has been the crea-
tion of the'Projects Division'
(originally styled the Interna-
tional Ideas Bureau !.
"Themes for world presentation
have been decided on and worked
out, and contracts made with the

and film are not being neglected."
One of the projects presented in
concrete detail by ooe Projects
Division (organized in June 1948)
is the publication of a Unesco
Calendar of World Affairs, con-
taining anniversaries of important'figures and events in education,
science and culture, international
co-operation and human progress.
It is intended as a reference book
for writers, editors and producers
and will also aid school and dis-
l cession groups. The Calendar will
tube ready for publication by the
spring of 1949 and will apply to
the year 1950.
The Projects Division has also
prepared draft international film
lists on International Understand-
ing and Co-operation : Fundamen-
tal Education (including elemen-
tary hygiene, public health and
agriculture) ; the Arts ; and the
Popularization of Science. When
revised and edited the lists wiU
be made available for publication
in all countries for the use of pro-
ducers, distributors and educa-
tional film users.
Technical Needs
The 1948 surveys were extended
to 17 additional countries, largely
in Latin America and the Far
East ; Cuba, Dominican Republic.
Ecuador. Haiti, Honduras, Mexico.
Peru. Uruguay and Venezuela in
Latin America : Burma, India,
Pakistan. Malaya and Singapore
in the Far Ea. st : Austria. Hungary
and Italy in Europe. The results
are being published in English
and French. The 1947 surveys
were highly praised at the UN
Conference on Freedom of In-
formation at Geneva.
Free Flow of Information
The Secretariat has prepared a
draft analysis of the political.
economic, financial, technical and
professional obstacles to (1) ac-
cess to sources of information,
(2) publication of information of
foreign origin or affecting foreign
countries, (3) transmission of un-
published information from one
country to another, and (4)
dissemination of published in-
formation from one country to
another.
Unescq collaborated fully with
the Economic and Social Council
in the preparation for the UN
Conference on Freedom of In-
formation''and of the Press and
in the conference itself."Unesco
upheld a distinctive line of policy
at the conference, stressing the
need for a balance between free-
dom on the one hand and respon-
sibility and control on the other.
"Resolutions were passed favour-
able to Unesco's work in the
Survey of Technical Needs, con-
clusions concerning newsprint
shortage, and the proposal to set
up an International Institute of
Press and Information."

### 73868: Dr. Huxley's suggestions for... the advance of world civilization
4 ; UNESCO COURIER November 1948
Dr. Hux ! ey On"Ih6 Advance of World Civilization"
(Continued from Page 1)
We are not operating in any sense as
agents of the Allied Authorities (though
ølmays with their agreement and. co-opefa-
tions), but as an international nonolitical
organization : and it is clear that such an
organization will have a much greater
possibility 0 : success in any"re-education"
of Germany than could be expected by as
occupuing Power.
"Advance of World Civilization"
Ã year ago I was thinking in term of ageneral Unesco philosophy, and of its
gradual buildmg up over a comparatively
long period. Today, while still believing
that this might and probably should
eventually be undertaken, I now feel that
we should search for a single unifying
idea, and that we should make this an
immediate task.
t would tike to throw out the suggestion
that for the purpose of a unifying and
general appeal, the underlying idea behind
all Unesco's activities can best be ex-
pressed in the five words"The
Advance of Word Civilization",
"Civilization because civilization
implies peace, and is indeed in
essence the technique of peaceful
Ihing ; World civilization because
peace must be global, and because
civilization confined to one section
of humanity is not compatible
with Unesco's constitution, and is
indeed provocative of violence and
war ; advance of world civilization
because world civilization is in its
infancy, and because we need the
jJynami appeal of a distant and
tver-receding goal.
This idea of the promotion of
çivilization on a world basis has in
the first place the advantage of
( : eing practical and concrete
However, vast in scope, however,
vague at the edges, it adds
up to a series of definite and
limited tasks. It introduces no
Jlote of ideological theory.
Furthermore, it commends itself
o the great majority of people,
what !"over their underlying phi-
losophy. It commends itself im-
mediately to the educated portion
of the world's population, and can
be readily made intelligible and
desirable to the rest.
Tre advance of civilization can
readily be fitted into the broader
concept of evolutionary progress,
but is quite indepe : 1dent of it. or. :_-.. 1--... 11--------------.. -,--..----moeea or anv general Ideology
or philosophy except those which would
entirely reject this world for the sake of a
sell-centred and sterile a3ceticism.
As with any other general and com-
prehensive concept, civilization can be
defined in various ways and can mean
rather different things to different people.
There is, however, an area of common
agreement. The advance of civilization
implies better cultivation of the arts of
peace. It implies the advance of knowledge
and the exploration of new and more outlets
for creative activity and expression.
external matters, such as mutual under-
standing with other nations ; and a nation's
population policy (or equally, its lack of
sue', a policy) may readily become one of
the tensions threatening peace.
Unesco is an inter-governmental organ-
ization. Accordingly while its purposes are
either world purposes (implicitly like peace,
or explicitly like promoting the general
wetfare of mankind), its very nature puts
difficulties in the way of their realization,
since the ultimate control of its policy is
in the hands of official delegations repres-
enting the points of view of separate
national governments.
Leaders of Civilization
 my mind, the best method available-" for securing any immediate advance in
this direction, is for Unesco courageously
to delegate an important part of its work
to private individuals, chosen not as official
delegates of governments, but as leaders of
civilizations-outstanding thinkers, artists,
writers, men of science, owning their best
allegiance not to nations, but to humanity-
view of humaa destiny as the crown and
continuation of the cosmic process of
evolution, seems necessary to synthesize
what is of value in the crowd of warring
beliefs and interpretations to be found in
the world today, and to provide the sour to
fruitful action on a world scale.. That
Unesco might make a contribution towards
some such dynamic synthesis is a : l inspiring
thought.
Value of Personal Contact
A considerable part of my time andenergy has been spent in travelling, I
having visited no less than 19 countries
during the spring and summer, some of
them twice. Since I have been with the
Organization, I have visited 32 countries. 23
of them Member States, and two protector-
ates or colonizes of a Member State.
This has been of great value to my work
for Unesco ; indeed I regard travel as an
indispensable part of the duties of the high
officials of the organization.
Such visits are of importance in making
personal contacts with the authorities and
leading personalities in the countries con-
Mind and Spirit
y is not for me here to try to formulatea detailed definition which will fit both
the facts and Unesco's purpose. That is a
matter, it seems to me, for the world's
leading thinkers and creative workers to
hammer out for Unesco over a period of
years.
I would here only throw out the sugges-
tion that the advance of civilization consists
essentially, or at least most importantly, in
the development of those human activities
which can be shared and participated in
wihout being destroyed or quantitatively
divided-namely the higher activities of the
human mind aid spirit. Knowledge is ac-
tually multiplied by being shared : a work
of art can influence and be enjoyed by an
indefinite number of people. For such
development of the higher activities of may,
there is of course needed an elaborate
framework of material things and activities
which cannot be shared in the same way :
but this, though part of civilization, its
machinery rather than its essence, is means
rather than end.
The idea of world civilization has a
further advantage in that it transcends
both nationalism and the limitations of
that hopeful offspring of nationalism,
interaationalism. I use the phrase"inter-
nationalism"in the strict sense of collabora-
tion between separate sovereign nations.
Nations in our worl, : till claim unrestricted
sovereignty, and all existing international
organizations are debarred from interfering
In the matters of internal concern to their
tmember nations.
In practice, however, this line caa rarely
be drawn sharply. To mention two out of
innumerable possible examples, a nation's
educational policy is legal1y a matter of
purely domestic ccern ; but it may affect
representatives not of governments depart-
ments, but of departments of the human
mind
"We Must Run the Risk"
THERE are, however, certain special fieldsin which Unesco must begin by bravely
delegating the discussion of the question
from the official and governmental to the
unofficial and individual level, even if it
runs the risk of finding that some suscep-
tibilities, including those of some of its own
Member Governments, are offended in the
process. For if it does not run this risk, it
incurs the certainty that little or nothing
will be accomplished.
The Economic and Social Council have
worked along these lines in regard to the
UN Scientific Conference to be held is 1949.
on the Conservatio ; ; l and Utilization of the
Resources. The Conference is designed to
bring out the scientific and technical
aspects of the subject, as far as possible
removed from purely national interest, in
the hope that the illumination and the
rational motives thus provided may
influence possible later official action. Such
a method, I suggest, will be even more
necessary if we are to deal with the prob-
lem of world population.
In fact I do not believe that it be brought
on to the international stage at all unless
it were previously made a matter of public
world concern ; and there is no hope of
effecting this except by means of a con-
ference of private individuals, free to say
what they believe on the basis of the full
facts, and to arrive at any conclusions they
liked without being tied by official instruc-
tions or susceptibilities or by purely na-
tio : lal in terests.
A New Interpretation of Life
INDEED, we may go further, and sav thatthe advance of world civilization in the
inur. ediate future depends upon the emer-
gence of a new interpretation of life, which
would provide the basis for the driving force
of belief and for its realization in action.
Such an interpretation would have to be
in one aspect humanistic, based on the
possibilities and the limitations of human
nat"re, including its spiritual and emotional
and intellectual as well as its physiological
aspects ; it would have to be based on
scientific knowledge of the universe ; and
it would have to be dynamic, concentrating
on the possibilities of change, not on the
litatu quo, nor yet on a static ideal.
Soo'ne such dynamic humanism, some such
cerneu, and in bringing home to them that
Unesco is a livinf reality, not merely a
remote and shadowy organization operating
in far away France.
I should add that this applies not only
to visits from highranking officials, but to
all official travel and to the influeace of
representatives in the field, such as the
staff of the Field Science Co-operation
Offices.
For instance, the representatives of the
Reconstruction Department travelling Ia re-
mote parts of the countries of South and
East Asia have noted the deep impression
made by their mere presence. Through it
the UN and its agencies came alive to the
local population, who could feel that they
were participating L, international life,
instead of being distant and neglected
objects in a scheme of things run by'a
mysterious"They"in some far-off and
alien region.
Grave Population Problem
I stress the gravity of the world populatio : J.problem largely, because I have seen the
undernourished children of the Marbial
Valley in Haiti and the erosion of its hill-
sides under the pressure of its already
excessive but still increasing population,
and have realized at first hand the impos-
sÎl : >llity of relieving that pressure by
emigration. It is because I have seen the
general low standard of life in the in-
habitants of countries like Tunisia and of
Egypt, where the population has doubled
in approximately one geaeration.
To see, with one's own eyes erosion, as
in West Africa and the southern U. S. A. and
Haiti ; the effects of deforestation, as 111
Mexico and North Africa and the Middle
East.. the low state of general health in the
poorer people of Latin America and the
Moslem world ;-to see such things : s to
realize forcibly that Fundamental Educa-
tion must always be concerned as much
with teaching people how to raise their
standard of life as with education in the
narrower sense, and that Unesco in all such
ventures cannot hope for success unless it
works in the closest co-operation with its
sister agencies, FAO and WHO.
Discrimination
I have talked personalIy with represent-atives of the hundreds of University
teachers who have been dismissed or driven
to resign in various countries ; I have
heard with my own ears Lysenko lead the
absence of any social colour-bar in a
country like Brazil, and the intelli-
gence and public spirit of many
African chiefs and professional men
in West Africa, and the wealth of
artistic talent, previously unsus-
pected, that has been elicited among
the Haitians by the modest encour-
agement provided by the Art Centre
at Port au Prince, or in Turkey by
the mere removal of the traditional
ban on representational art, is to
be given very real faith in the
results which could accrue from a
genuine application of non-discrimi-
natory principles.
International Publicity
SUCH facts lead on to theencouraging belief that inter-
national publicity is one of the most
fruitful methods open to Unesco.
If Unesco brings to light the
positive successes which have been
achieved. where discrimination has
not been practised, and where the
authorities have genuinely believed
in equality of opportunity, the facts
will confound the forces of reaction.
University Development
IN a more restricted fietd that of- *-University development it is of
great value for someone familiar
onty with European and North.
American practice to see at first
hand university life in other regions._....J. o nave J. ÆLln-AIllencan pro-
fessors tell you of their duties and their
salaries is to realize that the concoct of
university teaching as many educational
systems in the region. To see for oneself
how. in eastern Europe and the USSR, an
increasing amount of research work is
being assigned to the Academies of
Science is to realize that the. western idea
of research being maialy a university
function is not the only one possible.
To talk to the staff of one of the Islamic
institutions of higher learning attached to
the Great Mosques is to realize that in
Islamic countries two entirely different
conceptions of higher education exist side
by side. with little or no correlation.
During my official visit to Yugoslavia,
Hungary. Poland and Czechoslovakia, every-
where I went I saw the immense efforts
being made in the cultural, scientific and
educational fields, as regards not only
reconstruction but also new ventures and.
achievements ; I found no barriers between
me and my academic colleagues, and in
general a great willingaess to exchange
information with other countries and to
co-operate in Unesco projects. Indeed, 50 far
as I could ascertain, barriers to cultural
exchange are at least as great between
these countries and the USSR, as they are
between them and Western Europe.
In the Middle East, I was accompanied
by Dr. Raadi who was acting as Consultant
on the project of establishing an office of
Cultural Co-operation ia the region. He and
I were equally struck by the general
readiness to think in terms of a broad
cultural region, embraclllg Turkey, Iran
and Afghanistan as well as the countries
of the Arab League, as against the cultural
nationalism of single countries or the more
insidious temptation of a narrower region-
ahsm based solely on Arabic culture.
The first two years of Unesco's existence
have proved that the new organization is
viable and healthy, and that a number of
practical projects, which could not be
undertaken by any other body, lie ready to
its hand.
In its second year, Unesco has for one
thin achieved a much more satisfactory
organization. But what in the ion : run
will be more important, it has begun to
glimpse the way towards a central unifying
concept, or, to use Monsieur Maritain's
phrase, a central principle of practical
action, which will serve both to illuminate
its path more clearly, and to : live added
energy to its action.
now resulted in the dismissal of some. of
the leading biologists in the USSR. and the
strait-jacketing and distorting of one of the
most important branches of Science. And
such experiences have brought home to me
how far the world is from those ideals of
freedom of research, thought and expression
which are enshrined in Unesco's Constitu-
tion.
Again, it is one thing to read about
discrimination. It is a much more forcible
experience to see it at work in many parts
of the world, includin, l :", alas, parts of
countries whish are States Members of
Unesco ; or to hear a leading academic
personality in Peru maintain that the
Indians should not be given educationat
opportunities because they were, racially
and inherently, so inferior as to be un-
educable.
On the other hand, I have seen with my
own eyes the evidence that this is not so,
in the remarkable success of Mr. Truman
Bailey in training Peruvian Indians in
skilled craftmanship and habits of regular
work.
To see this, and the almost complete

Dr Charles Malik, President of
the Economic and Social Council,
has advocated that, to begin with,
these measures sho : Jld be applied
to the Arab countries. He no
doubt realized that the West was
dangerously ignorant of the great
works of Arab literature and that
this was an underlying cause of
misunderstanding and distrust
between the two cultures.

As regards the General Confer-

opinion that after two vears of

of the proramme and budget
should now be subordinate to
discussion of the broader questions

in marshalling the forces of edu-
cation, science and culture for

the achievement of peace is a

AN INDIAN VIEW
The Place oj W OTnen
in Unesco
The article printed below is reproduced from the"Behar Herald,'"
Patna, India.
THE Charter oaf Unesco states that the purpose of the Urganization.will be realized by giving fresh impulse t  popular duc tion ana
the spread of culture by instituting collaboration amongst the natzons
to advance the idea Of equality of educational opportunity without
regard to race, sex or any distinction, economic or social.

Accepts Unesco
Programme
in Japan
(Continued from page 1)
In addition, the Supreme Com-
mander suggested that Unesco
serve as the agency to encourage
the exchange of scientific, educa-
tional and cultural publications
between Japan and other coun-
tries. He also recommended that,
in view of the financial difficul-
ties which today face Japanese
students wishing to study abroad,
Unesco undertake to make known
existing fellowships and scholar
ships for which Japanese may be
eligible.
It was pointed out to Dr. Kuo
that Japanese desiring to go
abroad for educational and culture-
al purposes required sponsors
who could guarantee their total'
expenses while away from their
country.
General MacArthur also point-
ed out the desirability for ; :'. CAP
representatives and selectd Jap-
anese experts to attend, as
observers, sessions of Unesco's
General Conference, certain
technical conferences (particular-
ly those concerned with textbook
revision). seminars, etc. He sug-
lZested to Do, Kuo that : 3CAP
might furnish Unesco with in-
formation on Japanese tes : book
revision and that Unesco in turn
inform SCAP of progress made in
developing criteria for text. boot
reform.
At the end of this meeting,
General MacArthur told Do, Kuo
that the Japanese people, with
SCAP assistance, have under-
taken a nation-wide programme
'oaf educational, scientific ana cul-
tural activity which is in har-
mony with the aims and pur-
poses of Unesco. Working through
Unesco, the Supreme Commander
said, SCAP might encourage
those activities bv continued ma-
nifestation of interest and bv the I
extension to Japan of special
assistance in certain areas and
projects.
During his ten-day stay in
Japan, Dr. Kuo met w th the
heads of various sections of Gen-
eral MacArthur'g staff including
Civil Information and Education :
Public Health and Welfare : Eco-
nomic and Scientific ; Natural
Resources ; Civil Communicat ! ons ;
Diplomatic and Government He
also held conferences with Jap-
anese Civil Authorities which
had been arranged for him by
SCAP.
It is of vital importance that
the intention to provide equality
of opportunicy for girls and
women, expressed with equal
forcefulness in the Education
Plan for India, should be imple-
mented. and not remain a vague
and unreallzed assertion.

sisted in the provision of children
to maintain he race, along with
incidental assistance in gaining
the common livel'hood.
No one w : 11 dent that the
greatest tnfluence on he child,
and hence on the succesding gen-
eration. derives trom the mother,
nor that MOmaK's true vocation,
settled biologically trom th dawn
of time, is motherhood. Yet it is
only comparatively recently that
recognition has been given to the
fact that the uneducated mother
can do the greatest harm to our
children through her own ignor-
ance, and hence can do the
greatest harm to the race. Even
woman's great function as a spiri-
tual gUide is vitzated by ignorance
and it tollows that that deep re-
ligious belief which inspires and
stirs the noblest sentiments can-
not be imparted effectually.
Discrimination
We in India are very conscious
of discrzm, nation in education bet-
ween the sexes. Our women today
are steeped in ignorance and
poverty. But it must at the
same time be admitted that
the general attitude to MomeK's
education can only be described
as lukewarm. It is the relatively
small handful at educated women
zn India who must act as pioneers
in their own tand. Further, they
must join width Unesco and loo

It is the mothers in all land
who suffer from the doctrine that

millions then not only see their
children slaughtered and maimed
but sense their children's failure

Women without education can
play but a small part in mould-
ing the tuture generation, and I
would be tempted today tc say
that in my country the education
ot girls should take precedence in
all schemes of educational develop-
ment over the educatzon of boys

Women must be in Unesco and
the instruments organized to
achieve its aims to ensure'that
the essential opportunities to
learn are provided and, further-
more, provided in the right way.
Duty for omen
In the spread. ot scientific
knowledge there is an essential
duty for women. Here everything
possible must be done to ensure
that scientific advances shall be
directed to the bènefit and not
to the destruction Of mankind.

"Conditions of Intellectual
Activity In the Arab World"
- HAT Unesco is holding itsconference in the Lebanon
this year is no insignificant
event ; and if, is necessary, I think
for us to consider the full mean-
ing of this fact.
It means that the Arab wor : d

tation ; no longer do the people
of thins region seem confined
within its boundaries, and isolat-
ed from the intllectual activities
and the history of the world.
The coming to the Lebanon of
this nigh international Organiza-
tion for Education. Science and
Culture, shows that the Arab
world, and more generally, the
Middle East, are gradually com-
ing out of the : r deep mental iso-
lation, trying to study the prob-
lems with which they are faced
and the possibilities which lie
before them. It shows that they
are trying also to respond to
the daring example given them.
by other nations and peoples.
and to become fit for cultural ex-
changes and collaboration based
on total mutual respect.
It shows moreover, that the
world has begun to believe in the
great importance and possibilities
of the Arab people. As fOl the
Lebanon, the coming of Unesco.
to Its territory shows that the
, important position of this coun-
try both in the Western and in
the Arab world is a clear realty
which lays upon it a positive in-
ternational mission that it must
modestly prepare and lovingly
fulfil.
I say that we are gradually
coming out of our mental isola-
tion, and in our present state, it
is difficult and even impossible
to say more. In order reallv to
escape from this isolation, to
realize thoroughly our importance
and possibilities and to plav an
active part in the great world
pageant of thought, in order that
our judgment may be va'ued and
our opinions respected in Hel-
sinki.. Bordeaux. Boston, Buenos
Aires, Sydney, Minsk 01 Cape
Town, there are seven conditions
which we must fulfil, and these
are the conditions of the exis-
tence of our mental activity.
I. A complete and fundamentalreform of our social and economic
principles
I can confidently assert that
our opinion will never be res-
pected, nor will our judgment be
valued so long as the majority
of : the people 111 the Arab coun-
trip-s have insufficient social and
economic rights. This state of
affairs is most prejudicial M us.
as I myself have been compelled
to feel, time and again, when
III. The preservation of our true
cultural heritage
This means that we must
distinguish clearly between what
is positive and what is negative.
what is true and what is false,
and this distmction IS the touch-
stone by which we will test our
judgment. As this touchstone
shall truly reveal all that is false,
so shall we discard these false
things readily and with a true
heart. Thus, and thus only, shall
we be able to benefit fully from
our true cultural heritage.
IV. The translation of the classics
into Arabic
If the Arabic mind is steeped
in Aristotle, Plato. Augustine,
Akwini, Ibn Rushd, Al-Faraby,
GaIaI-Eddine E I r 0 u m i, Ibn
Khaldoun, Hegel, Dostoievsky.
Nietzsche. Tolstoy and other great
thinkers ; if the Arabic mind
studies deeply the practical appli-
cation of experimental science,
and, consequently, seeks to pierce
mysteries of nature, then the
Arab world will be able. before
the close of the 20th century, to
create and express something
new which will have repercussions
in Helsinki and Cape Town. But
if it remains a stranger to these
accumulated riches, I do not see
when it will take a serious place
in the intellectual world.

dealing with international affairs.
These facts are there, to he seen
and faced with the necessary
courage and decision..,
II. The complete emancipation of
women and the normalizing ofthe emotions
This is an essential part of
social reform, for so long as we
do not consider women as a human
entity in their own right and
so long as the emotional side of
our being is unsettled, the mental
side also will have neither order
nor stability. In history, with a
few exceptions which cannot be
taken as a standard, we find
that it is impossible for a nation
to produce anything in the realms
of intellect and culture, unless
its emotional side, fundamentally,
is first normalized. The choice
then remains between keeping
ajar ;, from any intellectual and
cultural movement and preserving
emotional disorder, or taking an
active part in those movements
after mastering those emotions.
V. Freedom of Thought
and Conscience
To desire truth and to find it,
to adopt it and change our men-
tal outlook accordingly ; to gain
further freedom with each new
discovery of truth : that is the
most important principle of any
responsible mental activity. For
any objective intellectual develop-
ment there is one indispensable
condition : that our society and
our governement should guarantee
the responsible use of freedom in
the expression of personal opi-
nions and beliefs in science, art,
philosophy and religion. BUt if
our real being is not entirely
known to us and if our attitude
deprives us of this knowledge or
of the free expression of it, then
I do not see how we can ever
attain true intellectual activity.
The condition of this intellectual
activity is that it must be at the
same time a substance and a
form and not always a substance
for another form.

VI. The Disinterested Pursuit
of Truth.
As long as we shall consider
that the greatest catastrophe of
our existence is our failure in
spheres of practical interest : com-
mercial, material. literary or poli-
tical, our voice will never make
itself heard in the"temples"of
pure intellect.
Science did not grow and pro-
gress, sublime art did not flourish,
nor philosophy impose itself ex-
cept by disinterested research and
thought. He who believes in some-
thing objective and real, outside
his own self, and who trusts III
the possibility of attaining it ; he
who desires above all else to
arrive at this point, who will im-
pose upon himself absolute priva-
tion for its sake, to whom the
joy of intellectual vision is a
greater satisfaction than any
pleasure or profit ; he who aspires
to free, conscious, logical and
analytical thought, he alone will
have lasting place in intellec-
together for the common good.
If this union were surrounded by
an atmosphere of freedom and
understanding, with the searCh
for truth as its aim, and if there
were far-sighted sympathisers
ready to offer it all material ne-
cessities, and if it remains in
constant contact with practical
life and its responsibilities, never
shrinking or drawing back, then
, we can say that reason has at
last come and that it may
perhaps stay.
In order that it may stay, and
be established on sound founda-
tions, this Arabic intellectual unity
must maintain contact with other
intellectual circles throughout the
world, with universities and cul-
tural institutions, in a spirit of
noble modesty ready to accept the
plain truth. The most important
condition is that great thinkers in
the Arab world should know each
other and be united in genuine
friendship, the spirit of which is
love, and the framework hopeful
patience. Then what heights can-

tual life. But he who demands
profit from all things, will be
deprived of both the things and
the profit.
VII. Close collaboration between
leading thinkers
Intellectual activity implies a
living and unfettered exchange
among the enlightened spirits or
the age. Seclmaon and isolation
have never produced any respon-
sible thinkers. If we wish reason
to flourish and develop in the
Arab World, then all great think-
ers should co-operate and work
not be attained and what hidden
lights cannot be revealed ?
There may be some scoffers
who do not believe in the possi-
bility of the Arab world, real1zing
these conditions, and, as a result,
do not believe in intellectual ac-
tivity for the Arab world. Great
may be their number. But all
these conditions. I am convinced,
are quite easy to fulfil. I affirm
that the future is for him who
believes in the possibility of their
realization. It may be that we are
already on the threshold of all
this, and that we know it not.
