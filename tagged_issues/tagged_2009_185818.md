Language and worLd views
each language is a unique world of thought
Australian linguist Christopher Moseley explains the crucial 
importance of preserving languages and presents the main 
innovations of the UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s 
Languages in Danger. 4 
 
The monkeys, the scorpion and the snake
Stone is petrified speech, water is language laughing, the sown 
seed, a promised word: every element of reality is an integral  
part of Toro Tegu, currently spoken by some 5,000 Dogons  
in the north of Mali. 6 
Preaching in the wilderness or banking  
on the future?
After prolific production in French, the Senegalese novelist  
Boubacar Boris Diop decided to write in Wolof.  
For a poor, multilingual population with an oral tradition, books 
are not a priority. Yet African writers who express themselves  
in their national languages are becoming more  
and more numerous. Interview. 8 
indigenous Languages
an epidemic is threatening  
indigenous languages
Some languages are spoken by very few people but are still 
very much alive, while others have been preserved by the isola-
tion of their speakers. Marleen Haboud from Ecuador explains  
these apparently paradoxical phenomena. 11
The secrets of Machaj Juyai-Kallawaya
Developed down through the centuries, Machaj Juyai  
is a “secret language” still spoken by a few families of traditional 
sPeciaL ediTion ocToBer 2009
herbalist healers, the Kallawaya, who live in the Bolivian Andes. 
They propagate a now-threatened ancestral knowledge,  
which UNESCO is working to safeguard. 13
The saga of the ainu language
Several thousand years old, the Ainu language spoken  
in northern Japan was dying out due to political pressure  
from the central government. At the end of the 20th century, 
this trend was reversed. While Ainu’s future is still not  
guaranteed because it isn’t taught in schools, the resurgence 
of interest is undeniable. 15 
Languages and sociaL cohesion
Languages and immigration:  
bilingualism is an asset
To deprive immigrant children of their mother tongues  
is to create situations of conflict between the family model  
and the social model, which is to scorn their identities.  
If their languages and cultures were respected by school  
systems, they would develop a better esteem of themselves 
and of others. 18
The indian dilemma
With some 1,650 languages and more than a million schools 
including all levels, India faces a serious challenge: to ensure 
national cohesion without compromising the interests  
of regional languages. It has invented the “three language 
formula”, difficult to implement. 21 
 
Kyrgyz: an “emerging” language
In the streets of Bishkek, two languages are found side by side  
on advertising billboards, at newsstands and in conversations.  
After gaining its independence in 1991, Kyrgyzstan adopted 
Kyrgyz as its national language and kept Russian as the official 
language. Linguistic results are mixed. 23
Editorial
as societies slowly realise just how 
closely related they are to one 
another – often when violence 
erupts because of some crisis 
or another on the planet – their relation-
ship to development is also beginning to 
change. We can no longer push forward 
our own growth at the expense of others, 
in a spirit of competition. Progress is now 
intimately linked to the harmony of all, so 
strong and complex are the interactions 
between all aspects of life on Earth.
 As a result, the principle of “intellec-
tual and moral solidarity”, enshrined in 
UNESCO’s constitution as the basis for 
the peace and prosperity of mankind, is 
more relevant today than ever. Everything 
is played out in the minds of men.
However, nothing happens in the minds 
of men without the intervention of lan-
guage, or languages. Humans only 
operate mentally, and even emotionally, 
through languages.
 If men and women are to have their 
say in decisions concerning this de-
velopment that is now common to us 
all, it becomes absolutely necessary to 
ensure that each of the languages in 
which they think, understand and ima- 
gine, continues to survive. It is impos-
sible to conceive of the development 
of a globalized human race if it is not 
polyglot.
 Every language is a precious trea-
sure, because it is the path towards the 
life and vision of a human being, whose 
contribution to the common cause 
can only be authentic if it is expres- 
sed in the words of his or her own 
language. And, as we must all contribute 
to this common cause, the issue of 
translation between all these languages, 
and their perpetual interaction, becomes 
crucial for the justness of future deve 
lopment.
 If there were only one language in 
the world, it would not be long before 
it started to diversify, because humans 
are themselves diverse and use their 
language creatively. The plurality of lan-
guages is proof of this. And, as such, it 
is a heritage that is truly common to all.

time aware of just how many lan-
guages there are in the world, and 
are coming to a better understand-
ing of the forces that are attacking 
them and exterminating them, and 
of ways to control those forces. It’s 
very difficult and complex, and it 
would be naïve and oversimplifying 
to say that the big ex-colonial lan-
guages, English or French or Span-
ish, are the killers, and all smaller 
languages are the victims. It is not 
like that; there is a subtle interplay 
of forces, and this Atlas will help or-
dinary people to understand those 
forces better. 
But to answer in one sentence: 
why do we have to care? Because 
each language is a uniquely struc-
Why should we care  
about language preservation? 
We as human beings should care 
about this in the same way we 
should care about the loss of the 
world’s variety of plants and ani-
mals, its biodiversity. What is unique 
about present-day language revival 
movements, which didn’t exist be-
fore, is that linguists are for the first

tured world of thought, with its own 
associations, metaphors, ways of 
thinking, vocabulary, sound system 
and grammar – all working together 
in a marvellous architectural struc-
ture, which is so fragile that it could 
easily be lost forever.
Can you tell us a few projects 
or initiatives you know that 
have helped to safeguard  
a language?
Projects and initiatives exist at all 
levels – from local grassroots cam-
paigns from the bottom up to get 
people to read in their own language 
and thus pass it on to younger gen-
erations, up to big state–supported 
plans. 
In Australia, for instance, there are 
active and successful campaigns 
to revive the use of languages that 
were regarded as dead for gen-
erations, but turned out to be only 
‘sleeping’. In New Zealand, the 
Maori language has been rescued 
from near oblivion through the 
scheme of ‘language nests’ – nurs-
eries where the language is passed 
on to young children. 
But the biggest success stories 
are the ones that are operated with 
state support and infrastructure, 
such as the reclaiming of Welsh 
in Wales or Catalan in Catalonia 
– two regions of Europe that have 
seen success in our own lifetimes – 
or, of course, the revival of Hebrew 
as a national language in Israel. 
What is new in this edition  
of the Atlas? 
This third edition of the Atlas is 
new in at least three important 
ways. Firstly and most obviously, it 
is being published in two different 
formats: an on-line version as well 
as a printed version. The on-line ver-
sion is an important new develop-
ment, and is based on Google Earth 
maps, with the location of each 
endangered language, no matter 
how small, pinpointed as exactly as 
possible on the maps, which can 
be filtered to any desired scale and 
level of detail. 
Secondly, for the first time we 
are giving a comprehensive cover- 
age of the whole world. The pre-
vious two editions gave only a 
sample from some continents of 
the state of threatened langua- 
ges, but this time we have been 
careful to cover every language, 
and, as before, to show the level 
of endangerment, from “Unsafe” 
down to “Moribund” with a sys-
tem of colour coding. 
And thirdly, we are making 
the Atlas available in three lan- 
guages: English, French and 
Spanish, with possibly more 
translations to come later.
You are the general editor  
of the Atlas. Can you explain 
how the work for this Atlas  
was done?
It was a worldwide collaborative 
effort by a team of linguists, all of 
them experts in the field of endan-
gered languages and linguistics. As 
in the previous editions (published 
in 1996 and 2001), we had Re-
gional Editors in charge of collect-
ing data for each continent, writing 
the regional essays for the Atlas, 
and entering the language points in 
the maps. 
For some areas, local knowledge 
of the situation came from special-
ists in several countries. Of course 
the contributors needed help and 
guidance from technical experts at 
the Section for Intangible Heritage 
of UNESCO as well. The Web Edi-
tor from UNESCO provided help 
and guidance for the editors at 
every step of the way while the on-
line version was being created, be-
cause this was a pioneering experi-
ment for all of us; and meanwhile 
the commissioning editors and my-
self as general editor were oversee-
ing the preparation of the texts. The 
whole project has been done to a 
tight schedule, in just under a year 
from start to finish.

### 185899: The Monkeys, the scorpion and the snake
6
This is the twentieth time I have 
come to work with the Dogon paint-
ers of Koyo, high up on their table 
mountain in the north of Mali. In the 
black of night, we all stretch out on 
mats outside the mud house set 
aside for me, in the centre of the 
village. The farmer-painters and I 
are exhausted, but happy with the 
poem-paintings that we have just 
made on cloth, under the burning 
sun. The youngest of the painters is 
making tea. Our conversation turns 
to the ancestors. 
Suddenly there is a sharp pain 
in my left hand. I grab my torch. A 
white scorpion has just stung me. I 
kill it. I panic at first and imagine that 
it will all be over for me in an hour. 
Then I think that I have thirty min-
utes of – relative – peace before the 
convulsions start. So I ask the head 
of the village if he has any traditional 
antidote to the venom. “No,” he re-
plies, “just wait. You will see.” The 
conversation starts again. My hand 
then my arm feel as though they are 
on fire. But, two hours later, the pain 
has stopped. I fall into a deep sleep, 
with the head of the village staying 
to sleep beside me. A mystery. 
Three days later, all eight of us – 
the six painters, the chief and my-
self – reach the foot of the cliff at 
the top of the mountain, ten kilome-
tres from the village, where each 
monsoon storm turns into a mas-
sive waterfall. This place, where the 
water thunders, chants and sings 
almost all summer, is the source of 
many a legend. Caves protected 
by initiations bear ancient pictorial 
signs. But I know that they are also 
home to awesome cobras. I ask the 
painters if they have any medicine 
against their venom. “No. Sit down 
and we’ll explain.”
All of reality is speech
I will try to put together here what 
was passed on to me that morning, 
and so many times before, using the 
signs and symbols that the painters 
draw when, in our poem-paintings, 
we tell of the profound life of this 
place. 
All of reality is speech; it is made 
and mellowed on the plateau at the 
top of the mountains. The beautiful 
round or flat stones are petrified, 
dense speech. Water is language 
laughing; the sky is its distant fore-
shadowing, the clouds its gestation 
and rain its joyful roar. The sown 
seed is a promised word: and, if 
the farmer sings, it increases its 
fertile strength. Here, the crops are 
farmed with the hoe and a song. 
The language of my companions, 
after all, is called Toro Tegu, “word 
of the mountain” and is one of the 
fifteen Dogon languages, with 
about 5000 native speakers. The

According to tradition, the cobra is the guardian of the Toro Tegu 
language spoken in Dogon country, in Mali.

     stone is petrified speech, water is language
    laughing, the sown seed, a promised word:  
every element of reality is an integral part of Toro
      Tegu, currently spoken by some 5000 dogons 
                   in the north of Mali.

Dogon from this ethnic group call 
themselves Toro Nomu, “people of 
the mountain”. 
The speciality of the Koyo village 
community, about 500 individu-
als, is to energize the fertility of the 
word through farming practices 
and rites. The community is bro-
ken down into small groups of six 
to eight individuals, who are linked 
forever and share at least one meal 
a day together. There is the group 
responsible for the collective grain 
stores, which are “reservoirs of the 
word”, the group responsible for 
rainmaking rites, the group respon-
sible for maintaining cliff paths, etc. 
Each group, of course, has its ref-
erence ancestor and only acts for 
the benefit of the community as a 
whole. 
The dynamic harmony of reality is 
regularly recast through nocturnal 
singing and dancing by a special-
ized group of “women elders”. The 
choreography includes a regular, 
wide, horizontal sweep with the 
right arm, which signifies sowing 
the word as if it were a seed.
The word at work
Since 2002, the painters, the 
head of the village and I – the poet 
of the written word – have formed a 
support group. We spread cloth or 
paper onto the flat rocks, like the 
fine loam of the market gardens, 
then I lay the “seeds” of the poem, 
while they lay the “seeds” of picto-
rial signs. These textiles and sheets 
of paper are then exhibited all over 
the world, bringing income, a “har-
vest” that feeds the village. We have 
been able to build a school, five 
reservoirs, which have doubled the 
area under cultivation, three “Paint-
ers’ Houses” which can be visited, 
etc., as part of a development proj-
ect for the village [see ‘Koyo, a place 
for dialogue between two cultures’, 
UNESCO Courier , n° 4, 2008]. 
Our group has two reference an-
cestors, because it soon spawned 
other groups, responsible for main-
taining the school, the “Painters’ 
Houses” and other fruits of our 
development project. “We have de-
cided that you have become Dog-
on,” the painters tell me, “and you 
must add the names of these two 
ancestors to yours. The last time 
a foreigner was allowed to join us 
was five centuries ago. He is the 
one who painted the symbols in 
one of the caves near to the great 
waterfall. He is one of our two refer-
(•••)
ence ancestors. But now he is the 
last but one foreigner to be accept-
ed, because you are the last.” 
According to Toro Nomu, every-
thing on the mountaintop is the 
word at work and in harmony with 
itself. Animals are also elements 
of this. But, in contrast, everything 
that is beneath these high plateaux 
– like a ravine, a gorge or even a 
42 kilometre-wide plain, separating 
the two plateaux – bears the gener-
ic name of pondo: here the word is 
weak, shapeless, undulating, shifting. 
Above all, it is the word of the nomad-
ic herders, who have held feudal rule 
over the plain for centuries 
“Our hordes of monkeys shake the 
word into confusion”, the painters 
continue, “but the scorpions and 
cobras are creatures that the word 
uses to protect itself. If they come 
across a stranger, they kill him. But 
they never attack us”. 
“Ah, that is why the scorpion stung 
me the other evening!” 
“No, no, you still haven’t understood. 
Make an effort! You speak Toro Tegu. 
You have become Dogon. The scor-
pion made a mistake when he stung 
you. Who is dead, him or you?”

Interview by Jasmina Šopova. 
          after prolific production in French, the senegalese novelist Boubacar Boris diop decided

prEaching  
in thE  
wildErnEss 
or banking on 
thE futurE?
published in France in September 
2008.
Why didn’t you decide to pub-
lish it in French in Senegal?
Because now there are only pub-
lishers in national languages. That’s 
good news, anyway… even if their 
tongues are hanging out! They 
work with enthusiasm, but with im-
measurable difficulties too: no way 
to make a profit, no distribution… 
True, the state occasionally steps 
in. The “Direction du Livre et de 
la Lecture” (book and reading ad-
ministration) funded, for instance, a 
second edition of my book Doomi 
Golo after the first run of 3000 
copies was sold out. 
Besides my publisher Papyrus, 
there’s the Organisation Sénég-
alaise d’Appui au Développement 
(OSAD) that does remarkable 
work. And also ARED publishers, 
but they’re specialized in research 
and in education for development. 
You wrote a dozen books in 
French before choosing Wolof, 
your mother language.  
Why this reversion? 
Actually, my language was always 
there, inside me. The only problem 
I faced was the ability to write in 
my language. I was “corrupted” by 
French. I spoke everyday Wolof, but 
I didn’t possess it intimately. 
Then there was Rwanda. A group 
of writers I belonged to went there 
after the genocide, in 1998, as part 
of the operation “Rwanda: writing as 
a duty to memory”. I said to myself 
that if we’d let 10,000 Rwandans 
get killed per day for three months, 
if nobody had done anything, this 
conveyed a certain contempt for 
Africa… 
At that moment I felt even more 
strongly the desire to write in my 
mother language. It became es-
sential. Oh, at first it was painful…I 
was very afraid of writing a French 
novel in Wolof. I had to fight against 
myself, but the Diops are stubborn! 
Then I began to hear voices – voic-
es that came up out of the past. 
And writing became very easy. I am 
certain that my first novel in Wolof, 
Doomi Golo (The She-Monkey’s 
Young), is my best piece of writing. 
Is writing in Wolof therefore 
also a political act? 
Absolutely. Coming back to the 
title of my novel The She-Monkey’s 
Young: what’s a monkey? It’s an 
imitation of the other. The passage 
that best sums up the book is the 
one in which you see a huge mir-
ror in the middle of nowhere. Two 
gorillas find themselves in front of 
the mirror and they see their own 
images. They start fighting their re-
flections and as a result of hitting 
the mirror, they hurt themselves 
and die. What we call hatred of the 
other is in fact self-hatred. You have 
to be able to tolerate your image in 
the mirror, assume your identity. 
At the moment I’m translating 
this novel into French. It will be 
Boubacar Boris Diop.

who will translate it into Swahili? 
Do we have to wait two or three 
centuries? Not necessarily, but 
that’s what I fear, alas. 
You know, Africa was divided up 
by the colonial powers in Berlin in 
1885. Africans speak to each oth-
er through the colonial languages. 
And me, making fun of it, referring 
to the Berlin Wall of the Cold War, 
I call it our “Berlin Wall”. It is invis-
ible but terrible – it separates the 
English-, French- and Portuguese-
speaking countries in Sub-Saha-
ran Africa. 
With Moussa Konaté, Malian 
writer who heads the French-
speaking festival “Etonnants 
voyageurs” (Amazing Travelers) 
in Mali, I’ve often discussed the 
idea of organizing a big meeting 
of African writers who write in na-
tional languages. A way of at least 
making cracks in this wall. But it’s 
easier to find sponsors for French-
language writers than for those 
who write in national languages. 
UNESCO could be the perfect 
venue for such a pan-African 
encounter, particularly this year, 
International Year of Languages 
(2008). And it’s an international 
space. Without walls.
How many readers 
 can you have in Wolof? 
If I’d asked myself that question, I 
would never have started writing! It’s 
true that where I come from, many 
people don’t know how to read and 
don’t buy books. And they have oth-
er priorities: their children’s health, 
feeding their families… There’s also 
another phenomenon: rich people 
who live in poor societies generally 
prefer buying a fancy car, because 
you can’t show off a book… 
We have to accept this situation 
and bet on the long term. It will take 
a while for books written today in 
the African languages to prevail, but 
they’ll eventually find acceptance. 
Thirty years ago, literature in national 
languages didn’t exist, except for a 
few isolated cases. Today the situ-
ation is the opposite: hundreds of 
books have been published in Wolof 
and Pulaar, definitely more than in 
French. 
There are two writers’ organiza-
tions in Senegal, one composed of 
writers in French, the other of writers 
in national languages. The latter are 
far more numerous, but they have no 
visibility, because we live in a soci-
ety where French is the language of 
prestige. 
Do you count on diaspora  
readership? 
A great deal. But although the 
younger generations of the diaspora 
speak their mother languages, they 
don’t know how to read or write 
them. This is why I had the idea of 
organizing a Wolof workshop with 
young people whose background 
is Senegalese immigration in 
France. At first the parents didn’t 
necessarily see any benefit in 
their children learning their moth-
er language, but there was great 
demand from the young people. 
We’re starting in Bordeaux on 25 
February. It’s an idea that seems 
odd initially, but if it works I’ll be 
very proud of it.
Often when one travels from one 
African capital to another, one has 
to stop off in a European capital. 
Does this also happen in the world 
of African literature?
It would be fantastic if I could 
translate the Kenyan writer Ngugi 
wa Thiongo directly form Kikuyu 
into Wolof, without going through 
English and French… To my knowl-
edge there’s almost no translation 
from one African language into 
another. My novel Doomi Golo is 
translated into Pulaar now. But

### 185904: An Epidemic is threatening indigenous languages
11
What is the status of Central 
Andean languages, in terms  
of their viability? 
In the Central Andes (Ecuador, 
Peru, and Bolivia) the estimate is 
that one hundred indigenous lan-
guages are still alive. Determining 
exactly just how alive they are is 
not easy. This varies not only from 
one language to another, but also 
within a given language, depend-
ing on where it is spoken, the age 
of the speaker, their vocation, gen-
der, level of education, etc. 
For example, in Ecuador, Quechua 
is widely spoken in certain regions 
of the country, while it is rapidly 
disappearing from others. In this 
heterogeneous context, and even 
if certain languages continue to be 
used by the new generations, the 
general trend for all languages in 
the region is constant regression. 
How do you explain  
this situation? 
Several factors are involved, such 
as the living conditions of native 
speakers, whether or not they re-
ceive institutional and social aid, 
the extent to which the language 
continues to function in all modern 
communication contexts, and in-
deed, the interest and pride of the 
people who speak it. 
In terms of viability, the number 
of native speakers can be a rela-
tive concept. Some languages are 
spoken by a small number of peo-
ple but are very much alive, such as 
A’i cofán in Ecuadorian Amazonia. 
And, on the contrary, the number 
of speakers of some trans-national 
languages, such as Quechua, is 
dwindling every day. 
Some indigenous languages 
maintain their vitality because of 
the isolation of native speakers, 
who find they have around them all 
they need to live comfortably. But 
isolation should not be a condition 
for the survival of one of these lan-
guages; the ideal situation would 
be that they cohabit with the pre-
dominant languages and societies 
and that they gain in strength, de-
spite the homogenizing trends of 
globalization.
Why do languages disappear?
Over the last decades, a complex 
set of circumstances has acceler-
ated the disappearance of indig-
         some languages are spoken by very few people but are still very much alive, 
       while others have been preserved by the isolation of their speakers. 
           Marleen haboud from ecuador explains these apparently paradoxical phenomena.

enous languages, including con-
tacts with other peoples, the death 
of native speakers, radical chang-
es in their way of life, loss of land, 
massive migrations, and so on. 
Only joint actions integrated with 
global society can curb this kind of 
epidemic, which is making indige-
nous languages and their speakers 
vulnerable. This presupposes that, 
first of all, society as a whole gets 
to know these languages and their 
speakers, and learns to respect 
and help keep them alive, so that 
we achieve the ideal of a truly multi- 
cultural society. 
Another very important factor for 
keeping a language alive is the 
image that both its speakers and 
non-speakers have of it. A person 
who is proud of his or her language 
will be more likely to keep it going.
Could you give examples  
of some national or regional 
initiatives that have helped  
to revitalize languages  
in the region?
There have been several initiatives 
in our countries to help maintain 
minority languages. On one hand 
there have been government ini-
tiatives. In Andean countries, 
constitutional reforms have given 
indigenous languages an official 
status. The linguistic and educa-
tional policies of these countries 
are quite well defined and, even if 
they are still not always widely ap-
plied, their aim is to preserve the 
languages, culture and identity of 
their speakers, as well as respect 
and equality between peoples. 
At the same time there are the 
efforts being made by speakers 
themselves, both collectively and 
individually. For example, thanks 
to the creation of specific fam-
ily- and community-based edu-
cational programmes, families are 
trying to regain or consolidate their 
languages. Indigenous movements 
in Latin America have turned a cor-
ner in their campaign for the rights 
of indigenous peoples, with the 
creation of new bilingual, inter-
cultural educational programmes 
at all levels of formal education, 
specific health programmes and 
the creation of official services for 
speakers of certain languages. 
In some countries more than oth-
ers, the media have also taken 
initiatives to encourage the public 
use of certain languages, espe-
cially those with the greatest num-
ber of speakers. Bolivia is a prime 
example of this. 
Throughout history, new lan- 
guages have been born while oth-
ers have died out, why should we 
be concerned about the disap-
pearance of languages? 
Just like humans themselves, 
languages are born and die, but 
we have never before seen them 
die at such a rapid rate as during 
the past decades. This means not 
just the loss of words and expres-
sions, but also a store of knowl-

edge and ways of understanding 
the world and communicating with 
others, of constructing history, 
of exchanging with other human 
beings, with elders and younger 
generations, and of conceptualis-
ing time, space, the living world, 
life and death. Each language is a 
universe. And, every time a word 
dies, unique and irreplaceable 
stories disappear with it.

The Kallawaya’s

was proclaimed  
a masterpiece  
of the oral  
and intangible  
cultural heritage 
of humanity  
by UNESCO  
in 2003.

### 185908: The Secrets of Machaj Juyai-Kallawaya
T
                                      developed down through the centuries, Machaj Juyai is a “secret language” still spoken 
                       by a few families of traditional herbalist healers, the Kallawaya, who live in the Bolivian andes. 
             They propagate a now-threatened ancestral knowledge, which unesco is working to safeguard.
thE sEcrEts  
of machaj juyai-kallawaya
spread that the Kallawaya were Ay-
mara. 
Another half-century had to elapse 
before the Kallawaya were accept-
ed as a specific group with its own 
language and forms of expression. 
The Machaj Juyai-Kallawaya lan-
guage was heard by scientists in 
ceremonial and healing contexts, 
and it was also proven that it was 
used to a great extent as a language 
of communication within the group. 
There was thus, mid-20th century, 
renewed interest in the Kallawaya’s 
language as an expression of their 
know-how. According to some, 
Machaj Juyai-Kallawaya was the 
secret language of the Inca kings 
and those closest to them. Other 
experts attempted in vain to find 
parallels between Machaj Juyai and 
the ancient Puquina language, or 
the Uru from the Andean high pla-
teaus. Others imagined a possible 
link to languages of the Amazonian 
forest, where the Kallawaya trav-
eled to seek out the herbal, animal 
and mineral resources they used 
to prevent and cure illness. The 
Kalawaya’s role as intermediaries 
he Kallawaya, itinerant herbalist 
healers from Bautista Saavedra 
province in the state of La Paz, have 
developed down through the cen-
turies a “family language” in their 
kinship groups (ayllu), within which 
they have transmitted their holistic 
medicinal know-how from genera-
tion to generation. They named it 
Machaj Juyai, the “folk language”, 
still spoken today by the eight ayl-
lus of the Kallawaya in a province 
where the language of social rela-
tions and daily life is Quechua. 
Already colonial administrators 
were curious about this language 
and writers of Hispanic and mixed 
origin testified to its “rareness”. As 
early as the 17th century, informa-
tion circulated regarding the exis-
tence of a specialized language of 
herbalist healers who spent their 
time concocting remedies for Inca 
kings and their entourage.
The Kallawaya  
and the Eiffel Tower
Scientists in the 19th century, 
however, would not recognize the 
Kallawaya as having their own lan-
guage, and questioned them on 
their knowledge of herbal medi-
cines in the dominant language of 
the high plateaus, Aymara. The Kal-
lawaya speak it, in order to com-
municate with a larger number of 
patients and to enlarge their sphere 
of activity. 
With the aim of publishing a list 
of medicinal plants with industrial 
properties and present it at the 
1889 Universal Exposition, the one 
for which the Eiffel Tower was built, 
Bolivian scientists and civil servants 
asked the Kallawaya to describe in 
Aymara the properties of more than 
100 plants brought to France for 
this great “celebration of civiliza-
tion”. This was the moment the idea

The second event was the 1952 
revolution led by the National 
Revolutionary Movement (NRM), 
which led to structural social 
change: the right to vote was ex-
tended universally, the biggest 
national mining companies were 
nationalized and agricultural lands 
were redistributed. The Kallawa-
ya’s traditional nomadic way of life 
gave way to settlement in cities, 
where they became herbalists or 
jewelers. 
The idea of sending young Kal-
lawaya to medical school, spar-
ing them criminal prosecution for 
practicing indigenous medicine 
outlawed by Bolivian law, came 
out of this urban environment. This 
has created space for the struggle 
to decriminalize indigenous medi-
cine in Bolivia. The Kallawaya are 
becoming professionals within the 
framework of Western university 
knowledge, but they are doing so 
at the cost of a crucial cultural di-
mension: the Machaj Juyai-Kalla-
waya language. These days a large 
majority of Kallawaya is trilingual 
– Castilian, Aymara and Quechua 
– but few of them are fluent in their 
original language. 
During the 2001 census con-
ducted by the Bolivian state, the 
existence of the Kallawaya ethnic 
group and its language was not 
recognized. Nor is UNESCO’s 
proclamation of the Cosmovision 
of the Kallawaya as a masterpiece 
of the oral and intangible cultural 
heritage of humanity legally recog-
nized. At present, the Kallawaya 
are taking steps in order to obtain 
legal recognition from the Boliv-
ian Parliament for themselves and 
their language. The new Constitu-
tion (currently in the making) could 
prove them right.
By Carmen Beatriz Loza, 
researcher at the Bolivian institute of 
traditional Kallawaya medicine 
(El Alto, La Paz, Bolivia)
between the Incas and the Ama-
zonian populations may have influ-
enced their language.
Chronicle  
of a death foretold
Obviously the Kallawaya’s lan-
guage was subjected to the influ-
ence of Quechua, which was the in-
strument of their forced conversion 
to Catholicism. The Kallawaya elite 
were persecuted in the 17th cen-
tury in the battle led by the Catho-
lic Church known as “extirpation of 
idolatry”. Children were separated 
from grown-ups, to be brought up 
by Spanish people or Quechua 
Catholic priests. Quechua exerted 
further influence on the Kallawaya 
in the 19th century, when the latter 
emigrated massively to Peru, where 
they found numerous clients and 
even became in the early 20th cen-
tury the official doctors of President 
Augusto Bernardino Leguía. On 
their own territory too, the Kallawa-
ya felt the demographic pressure 
of neighboring ayllus, who spoke 
Quechua. This is why today Machaj 
Juyai-Kallawaya has absorbed near-
ly all the phonology and grammar of 
Quechua. 
More recently, Machaj Juyai-Kalla-
waya’s vitality was sorely tested dur-
ing two historical events. The first 
was the Chaco War (1932-1935) 
between Bolivia and Paraguay. The 
Kallawaya were mobilized as aides 
to the doctors responsible for giv-
ing care to the enormous contin-
gent of indigenous Bolivians, com-
prised of Aymara and Quechuas. 
Kallawaya lost their lives in great 
number, which would have serious 
repercussions on subsequent de-
mographic development.

### 185911: The Saga of the Ainu language
15
A
         several thousand years old, the ainu language
     spoken in northern Japan was dying out 
due to political pressure from the central 
     government. at the end of the 20th century, 
this trend was reversed. while ainu’s future 
       is still not guaranteed because it isn’t taught 
in schools, the resurgence of interest is undeniable.
thE saga of thE 
ainu languagE
age and inferior. Officially, the new 
Hokkaido authorities never intend-
ed to eradicate the Ainu language. 
But they did everything to that end, 
notably by building schools specifi-
cally for the “natives” in which they 
were taught Japanese. In order to 
survive in this new Hokkaido soci-
ety, irrigated by continual waves 
of Japanese immigrants, the Ainu 
gradually gave up their customs 
and their language. Today, for new 
generations, Ainu is a second lan-
guage, if they even speak it.
The last Ainu  
is not dead
The exact number of Ainu speak-
ers is unknown. Only surveys con-
ducted every seven years since 
1972 by the Hokkaido government, 
concerning living conditions among 
uteri (compatriot, in Ainu) people, 
allow an approximate assessment 
of the Ainu language situation. The 
2006 poll shows that out of 23,782 
 true linguistic enigma, Ainu (Ainu 
Itak) can’t be linked with certainty 
to any family of languages. Yet, as 
numerous specialists agree that 
the Ainu people are descendants 
of populations from the Jomon era 
(11,000 to 6,000 B.C.) that inhab-
ited the Japanese archipelago, it is 
very probable their language finds 
its origins in Neolithic languages. 
According to historical sources, 
the Ainu people first settled the 
northern part of the Japanese ar-
chipelago. The inhabitants of the 
Tohoku region (in the north of Hon-
shu, the largest Japanese island) 
gradually had to abandon their lan-
guage and culture starting in the 
14th century, due to pressure from 
the central government. But further 
north, in Hokkaido, as well as in the 
southern part of Sakhalin Island 
(the north belonging to Russia) and 
in the more isolated Kuril Islands, 
they were able to preserve them un-
til the islands were annexed by the 
new Meiji government in 1869. 
Not long after, following the sign-
ing of the 1875 “Treaty for the Ex-
change of Sakhalin for the Kuril 
Islands” between Japan and Rus-
sia, most of the Ainu from southern 
Sakhalin were displaced to Hokkai-
do. Epidemics decimated the popu-
lation. The same fate befell the Kuril 
Islands Ainu, who died out entirely 
after being forcibly regrouped, for 
national security reasons, on an is-
land off the coast of Hokkaido. Jap-
anese authorities feared that these 
Ainu, some of them converts to Or-
thodox Christianity, would serve as 
spies for the Russians established 
in the Kurils. 
At the end of the Russian-Japanese 
war, as of 1906, a good number of 
the Ainu from Sakhalin returned, 
because Japan controlled the south 
of the island. But on Stalin’s orders 
all were expelled in 1945 and they 
settled in Hokkaido. Sakhalin’s tra-
dition and dialect disappeared as 
the expatriates died – generally, 
they hadn’t transmitted their knowl-
edge to the next generation. 
Beginning in 1868, the Japanese 
government imposed a new way of 
life on the Hokkaido Ainu. A series 
of prohibitions concerning hunting 
and fishing, for instance, traditional 
Ainu resources, profoundly under-
mined their culture. The community 
was stigmatized, considered sav-
In the past, the Ainu occupied the northen 
part of the Japanese archipelago.

A law can change  
everything
Founded in 1946, Hokkaido’s 
Ainu association, the largest in Ja-
pan, gives free language courses 
in 14 regions in Hokkaido, to both 
Ainu and Japanese students. No 
statistics on attendance are avail-
able, however. The foundation for 
research and promotion of Ainu cul-
ture, created by the 1997 law, has 
a section for training Ainu language 
teachers; it accepts seven students 
a year. 
The publication of dictionaries, 
textbooks and bilingual Ainu-Jap-
anese collections of Ainu oral lit-
erature is increasing year by year. A 
private radio station in Sapporo has 
been broadcasting a weekly Ainu 
language class program over Hok-
kaido territory since the 1980s. In 
April 2001, Shigeru Kayano, activ-
ist for Ainu identity and first Japa-
nese parliament member from this 
community (1926-2006), financed 
the creation of a radio station, FM 
Pipaushi that airs a show in Ainu lo-
cally in central Hokkaido two Sun-
days a month. 
It must be recognized, however, 
that for now the Ainu interested in 
their language are from relatively 
affluent backgrounds. The Ainu are 
for the most part marginalized and 
have little time to devote to learn-
ing their language. Despite the up-
surge of interest, as long as Ainu is 
not part of the curriculum in Hokkai-
do schools, its future is uncertain. 
This language is part of Japanese 
intangible heritage and is entitled 
to government protection, notably 
through its official recognition as a 
second national language.
By Kaori Tahara, 
historian of Ainu origin, 
graduate of the École des Hautes Études 
en Sciences Sociales, Paris
Ainu, 304 know the language, and 
among these 4.6% feel they master 
it to the point of being able to teach 
it. But we mustn’t forget these an-
swers are subjective and don’t 
necessarily correspond to reality. 
Furthermore, much of the popula-
tion doesn’t participate in polls and 
hides its identity. 
This said, assertions that the Ainu 
language is becoming extinct must 
be understood in relative terms. 
Since the 1990s, whenever an Ainu 
dies, the media announce the death 
of the last Ainu speaker, forgetting 
that more and more Ainu are start-
ing to relearn their language, in-
spired by elders or linguists.
To replace the 1899 law support-
ing assimilation policies, the Ainu 
demanded the promulgation of a 
new law in the 1980s. The law for 
the protection and promotion of 
Ainu culture was finally promulgat-
ed in 1997, facilitating, for instance, 
language instruction.

### 185913: Languages and immigration: bilingualism is an asset
18
Alarge number of “developed” 
states have official languages, but 
their populations of various ethnic 
origins speak a number of other lan-
guages every day. “It has been es-
timated that in the year 2000 more 
than one third of the population un-
der the age of 35 in urbanized West-
ern Europe had an immigrant minor-
ity background”, said a UNESCO 
document about language diversity 
(see link), which notes that that “the 
biggest immigrant groups in the Eu-
ropean Union are Turkish and North 
African and live in France, Germany 
and Britain”. 
Politicians in western countries are 
today drafting laws to tighten im-
migration conditions and are intro-
ducing language and culture tests. 
To ask applicants for immigration 
to know the rudiments of French, 
Dutch or English, as well as the ba-
sic rules of how the host countries 
work, does not seem absurd. 
But when they arrive, there is often 
an attempt to “erase” their mother 
tongues from their heads, especial-
ly if these are considered as “minor” 
languages. We only need to remem-
ber the October 2004 report about 
internal security in France (see link 
to Report about the prevention of 
delinquency). “[For children from 
1 to 3 years old], only parents, and 
especially mothers, have contact 
with their children. If the children 
are of foreign origin, the parents 
should force themselves to speak 
French at home, in order to get the 
children used to having only this 
language to express themselves 
in”, says the report, noting: “But if, 
in certain cases, they feel the reluc-
tance of their fathers, who often in-
sist on the use of the dialect of their 
countries of origin at home, they will 
be dissuaded from doing so. It will 
then be necessary to take action to 
encourage fathers to go in the right 
direction”. 
In the original French passage 
the word “français” (French), des-
ignating a language, was written 
in capitals, which is contrary to the 
rules of French spelling. It may be 
supposed that “speaking a dialect” 
is understood as speaking Arabic, 
Chinese, Serbian, etc. 
           To deprive immigrant children of their mother
      tongues is to create situations of conflict between 
the family model and the social model, which is 
   to scorn their identities. if their languages 
  and cultures were respected by school systems, 
     they would develop a better esteem 
                       of themselves and of others.
Welcome to the Island of Gorée, Senegal.
According to this report, the cog-
nitive, educational and social de-
velopment of children that are not 
forced to speak French at home 
would be compromised, as they 
would inevitably have language dis-
orders, leading to behavioural disor-
ders, later resulting in delinquency!
The mother tongues  
of immigrants under 
accusation
This absurd position reflects a fla-
grant ignorance of language devel-
opment and of the role of the moth-
er tongue in the psychic, cognitive 
and cultural construction of an in-
dividual. How for a moment could 
one imagine that a mother might 
speak a language that she did not 
master well to her child? How could 
one be ignorant of the fact that the 
mother tongue conveys affects, that 
it enables the organization of cogni-
tive faculties, that it symbolizes – for 
children of immigrant background – 
the continuity between the country

### 185913: Languages and immigration: bilingualism is an asset
19
Académie Française since 2003, 
wrote in his book Le Dialogue 
(2002): “fate made that from a cer-
tain time in my life, I became the 
bearer of two languages, Chinese 
and French. Was it only because 
of fate? Unless, all the same, there 
was a part of deliberate free will in 
it? The fact remains that I tried to 
take up the challenge, by coming 
to terms with the two languages in 
my own way, with the most extreme 
consequences. […] It is not surpris-
ing that since then, in the heart of 
my linguistic adventure, which is 
directed towards the love for an 
of origin and the family. 
To deprive the child of the mother 
tongue at home is to create a situ-
ation of conflict between the fam-
ily model and the social model and 
between family and school, with the 
further risk of impoverishing cultural 
references and weakening social-
ization. 
This also implies that bilingualism 
is not considered as an asset but as 
a handicap, as an obstacle to suc-
cessful education and integration, 
above all when the languages con-
cerned, such as Arabic, Chinese 
or Russian, are, ridiculously, called 
“rare”. When the languages con-
cerned, such as English or German, 
are ‘socially valorized’ languages, 
bilingualism becomes a symbol of 
the elite! 
The arguments and proposals for 
the use (or rather non-use) of the 
mother tongue in the 2004 Report 
about the prevention of delinquen-
cy have many supporters in political 
and academic circles in France, but 
the report gave rise to violent reac-
tions: associations, NGOs, trade 
unions and intellectuals were mobi-
lized, and the wording of the report 
was modified. In the 2005 version, 
the following can be found: “Rec-
ognition of early bilingualism as a 
factor of integration. After many de-
bates, the commission has consid-
erably changed its position on the 
subject. It also seems that maintain-
ing both the mother tongue and the 
dominant language enables chil-
dren to have better results at school 
(...)”
Conflict or dialogue 
of languages?
The last twenty years of research 
into psycholinguistics and sociolin-
guistics has unequivocally shown 
that the acquisition and learning 
of several languages by children, 
no matter what their socio-cultural 
background may be and no mat-
ter which languages may be con-
cerned, does not hinder the cogni-
tive and educational development

To deprive the child of the mother tongue at home is to create a situation  
of conflict between the family model and the social model.
of these children in the slightest. 
On the contrary, bilingual children 
show a greater speed and flex-
ibility in certain learning situations, 
and develop better communication 
skills. If they are slightly deficient in 
the second language, this is often 
temporary, and they compensate 
for this by a richer mental system, 
cognitive skills that are often more 
efficient and a richer vision of the 
world. 
When educational difficulties af-
fect children of immigrants, most 
teachers in France place the blame 
mainly on the conflict of languages 
and cultures. However, if the lan-
guages and cultures of immigrants 
were emphasized more, taught to 
all pupils in schools and respected 
by the school system and by the 
dominant society, individuals would 
develop a better esteem and re-
spect of themselves and therefore 
of others.

had pride of place: dialogue…” 
Dialogue between communities, 
dialogue between languages - lin-
guists know and emphasize the 
fact that immigrants contribute 
to the dynamism and enrichment 
of languages such as English or 
French. As an example, the mixing 
of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and 
Vietnamese with English is a world-
wide phenomenon, which immi-
grants of various Asian origins use 
to communicate with each other, 
therefore making their own linguis-
tic contributions. It is the same for 
“Spanglish”, a hybrid language that 
mixes English and Spanish, which 
is very popular with young people in 
the United States, and is one of the 
most striking examples of changes 
in a language faced with immigra-
tion and globalisation.

(•••)
babylon rEconquErEd
The image of this tree in its 
earth and in this different earth 
inflames my heart and I think of 
the tree’s distress and solitude, 
and I know very well those who 
at some point in their lives were 
forced to leave their linguistic 
and cultural territory, to es-
tablish themselves in another 
linguistic and cultural territory, 
know very well this distress and 
solitude. They fully conceive the 
wrath of God and they live the 
story of Babylon and its tower.
The story of those people 
who wanted to be God and 
devoted themselves to building 
a tower. From day to day the 
tower took shape and gained 
in height, it approached the 
sky and these people became 
God… So God became angry 
and took away the unity of their 
language. No one could un-
derstand the other’s language. 
The tower remained unfinished 
and the desire to become God 
even more so. Every language 
became a wall and people 
found themselves alone and 
powerless. Behind the wall, 
they isolated themselves and 
the desire to become God left 
them. 
Possibly it was these same 
cries of solitude, this absence 
of anyone to speak to intel-
ligibly, that took form and gave 
birth to poetry and literature… 
and each language became a 
treasure of unconfined unlim-
ited riches. 
While God took linguistic unity 
away from humans, they on the 
other hand created the diversity 
of translation. Every translation 
opens a door in the wall, a door 
that gives onto another lan-
guage, another culture, another 
existence and another wealth, 
so that every reader of another 
language may go through these 
doors, forget Babylon and 
divine wrath; so that another 
language may become their 
language, another culture their 
culture, another existence their 
existence and another wealth 
their wealth.
Spôjmaï Zariab, 
Afghan novelist
a brutal separation from one’s linguistic and cultural context evokes in my mind  
the image of a tree cut down one fine day to be planted in different earth. 
The tree that until that day had run its roots in its own soil and stood firm  
and solid on its roots found itself suddenly uprooted, and made an effort  
to put down its roots again in other soil and to remain standing.

### 185919: The Indian dilemma
21
The Indian tower of Babel takes 
the shape of a pyramid, with Hin-
du and English at the top, both of 
which remain foreign languages for 
two-thirds of the population. Then 
come the official languages of the 
States and Territories (regional 
languages), followed by minority 
languages, spoken by more than 
a million people, but with no ad-
ministrative function. Hundreds 
of others are located at the foot 
of this imposing linguistic edifice, 
under the aegis of a linguistic mi-
nority commissioner whose man-
date is advisory and not legally 
binding. 
In all: 1,650 languages, with 
400 used as languages of com-
munication. Among the latter, 22 
are spoken by 75% of Indians and 
are listed in the Indian constitu-
tion. It guarantees the protection 
of languages that are not listed, 
but only 60 of those are taught in 
schools, 11 of them registered as 
minority or tribal. 
An odd fact: Hindi, the official 
Indian union language along with 
English, is spoken by only 40% 
of the Indian population and is 
therefore a minority language. The 
issue of minorities is extremely 
complex, insofar as language is an 
element closely related to ethnic 
and religious identity. Muslims, for 
instance, speak Urdu, Sikhs Pan-
jabi, and Anglo-Indians English. 
While their languages are recog-
nized by the constitution, more 
than 600 tribal minorities from the 
mountains speak languages that 
are not taught in schools.
The trilingual formula
The sub-continent counts more 
than one billion inhabitants, 35% 
of them under 15 years of age. The 
Indian government has the oner-
ous task of managing an educa-
tion system that dates back about 
150 years and today comprises 
664,041 primary schools, 219,626 
upper primary schools, 133,492 
secondary schools, 297 universi-
ties, 8,737 university-level general 
education colleges and 2,409 pro-
fessional institutes. 
Since its independence in 1947, 
the country has been putting into 
effect educational policies aimed 
at mass literacy and economic de-
velopment – key factors to unite a 
people split into a multitude of re-
ligions, languages, castes and cul-
tures. 
Beginning in 1952, the Indian 
government’s secondary education 
commission put forward the outline 
of a multilingual educational policy 
including the mother language, the 
regional (or State) language, Hindi 
as the language of general com-
munication and one of the classical 
languages (Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic or 
Persian). 
Revised in 1961, the proposal 
was named “three language formu-
la” (TLF) including the regional lan-
guage, Hindi in non-Hindi-speaking 
areas or another Indian language in 
              with some 1,650 languages and more than a million schools 
including all levels, india faces a serious challenge: to ensure national cohesion 
without compromising the interests of regional languages. it has invented  
                the “three language formula”, difficult to implement.

Hindi-speaking areas, plus English 
or another European language. 
Finally, between 1964 and 1966, 
the Education Commission pro-
posed a modified version of TLF: 
the mother language or regional 
language; an official language, 
Hindi or English; and another modern 
language, Indian or foreign. 
Over the 12 years of primary and 
secondary school, instruction is giv-
en in the mother or regional language 
from the first to the fifth year, and TLF 
is introduced in the sixth year.
No magic formula
Recognized as the national norm, 
TLF is nonetheless not applied to 
the letter in all states. It is more 
hypothetical project than social 
reality. Although priority is given 
to the mother language at least 
at the start of formal education, if 
not throughout schooling, it is not 
obligatory. Certain states, such 
as Tamil Nadu, have opted for 
two instead of three languages; 
in others, instead of learning a 
modern language, a classic lan-
guage is substituted, like San-
skrit or Arabic. In some schools 
French or German is taught in-
stead of Hindi. 
Failure of state policy? Or in-
stead, as we would say, a dynamic 
and flexible linguistic policy in ed-
ucation, which seeks to reconcile 
tradition and modernity on one 
hand and institutional and civic re-
sponsibilities on the other. 
Because it must be understood 
that although tribal/minority lan-
guages are closely linked to cul-
tural, religious and ethnic identity, 
at the same time they are “use-
less” in contemporary life. Minor-
ity communities are torn between 
two trends: some demand their 
rights and struggle to obtain an 
official status for their language, 
while others choose assimilation 
with the majority instead. 
In order to protect minority lan-
guages and safeguard the thou-
sand-year-old heritage they con-
tain, there is talk of turning the 
three language formula into a 
four language one. Nothing is yet 
certain. 
The state may well guarantee 
schooling in a minority language 
whenever a class contains 10 
pupils who speak it as their 
mother language, but the fact is 
most parents would prefer their 
children to learn English or be 
educated in English. The “un-
constitutional” languages have 
no “market value” and social up-
ward mobility often comes before 
socio-cultural identity.

### 185921: Kyrgyz: an emerging language
23
O back only to the 1920s. And for the 
duration of the Soviet period, its 
use was limited to rural areas (with-
in families and between friends) or 
in certain circles of the intelligentsia 
(concerned about the preservation 
of the language), even if Kyrgyz is 
used for teaching in most schools 
and is studied at the highest level 
in Moscow and Leningrad (now St 
Petersburg).
Russian:  
back and forth
Shortly before independence, with 
the impetus of perestroika, local 
authorities imposed Kyrgyz as the 
national language, by passing the 
1989 law on the national language 
of the Soviet Socialist Republic of 
Kyrgyz. But political will is one thing, 
reality another. Due to insufficient 
means, the law was not applied; 
very quickly, funds were reduced 
and the civil servants in charge dis-
missed. 
Interest in the language fluctuated 
according to the numerous changes 
in government in the country, where 
the political situation was in fre-
quent upheaval. Different decrees 
Out of the 15 former Soviet re-
publics, Kyrgyzstan is the only one 
– along with Kazakhstan – to keep 
Russian as its official language in 
addition to its national language, 
Kyrgyz. Yet the latter, a member of 
the Turkic group of languages, is 
spoken by 73% of the population 
(amounting to 3.7 million people). 
At the same time, in the capital 
Bishkek, center of Kyrgyzstan’s 
public and cultural life, Russian re-
mains present if not dominant. 
The generations educated in Rus-
sian at the time of the Soviet Union, 
notably in urban areas, speak Kyr-
gyz without mastering it entirely. 
Often it’s a language they learned 
in school. “If tomorrow the govern-
ment decided to switch to Kyrgyz, 
I’d never make it in my professional 
life,” says Jyldyz Asanbayeva, pro-
gram assistant at the Public Policy 
Institute. She’s among the 2 to 3% 
ethnic Kyrgyz who don’t consider 
Kyrgyz their mother language. 
The language has a long oral tra-
dition, with its famous epic bards 
called akyns, but the alphabet of 
today, starting with Latin characters 
and then changing to Cyrillic, dates 
came one after another in support 
of Kyrgyz, but this protectionist 
linguistic policy only exacerbated 
tensions in the country, which is 
home to 80 different ethnic groups 
who use Russian to communicate 
among themselves. Concerned to 
see Russian-speaking people leav-
ing the country in droves, deputies 
in 2000 voted a new law on the of-
ficial language: Russian and Kyrgyz 
from then on had equal status, the 
first as official language and the 
second as national language. 
Good news for Russian speakers 
in Kyrgyzstan, who in 16 years of in-
dependence had not felt the need 
to learn Kyrgyz, for lack of a coher-
ent linguistic policy. 
Authorities wanted to “create a ne-
cessity” to speak Kyrgyz, but didn’t 
allocate the resources. “Our Institute 
doesn’t have the funds to publish 
our scientists’ research. The manu-
script for the Great Russian-Kyrgyz 
dictionary, which has 250 pages, 
is sitting in a cupboard covered 
in dust,” laments Kadyraly Konko-
bayev, director of the Linguistic In-
stitute of Kyrgyzstan’s Academy of 
Sciences. While during the Soviet 
        in the streets of Bishkek, two languages are found side by side on advertising 
      billboards, at newsstands and in conversations. after gaining its independence in 1991,
             Kyrgyzstan adopted Kyrgyz as its national language and kept russian 
                        as the official language. Linguistic results are mixed.

### 185921: Kyrgyz: an emerging language
24
era more than 30 fundamental 
texts on the Kyrgyz language 
were published, almost none 
have been produced since the 
country’s independence. 
Konkobayev sounds another 
alert: “The literary and artistic 
situation is dire. In the literature 
department, we don’t have 
enough authors to study in the 
area of Kyrgyz national litera-
ture and, I have to say, many of 
our contemporary writers are 
practically illiterate.” It isn’t only 
the authors, he adds; one only 
has to look at the poor quality 
of the newspapers. 
“The work accomplished 
since independence regar- 
ding the development of the 
language is unsatisfactory,” ex-
plains Tachboo Djumagulov, presi-
dent of the Commission for the 
Development of the National Lan-
guage. But since the March 2005 
revolution (which ousted President 
Aska Akayev) efforts are increa- 
sing: “Before 2005 state subsidies 
amounted to US$ 35,000; now 
they’re US$ 170,000.” 
Even if that’s nothing compared 
to the US$ 30 million spent in 
neighboring Kazakhstan to pro-
mote Kazakh, results are tangible. 
Television is the best example: 
before 2005, there was only one 
Kyrgyz-language channel; now five 
out of ten devote 60% of air time 
to programs in Kyrgyz.
Education:  
the weak link
Education seems to be the main 
element missing from the national 
language battle. “On one hand the 
number of hours of Kyrgyz instruc-
tion is increasing in schools and 
universities, but on the other hand 
there are very few qualified tea- 
chers,” explains Konkobayev. In-
deed, all universities have esta- 
blished a new post: vice-rector for 
the Kyrgyz language, responsible 
for promoting it and encouraging 
professors to give courses in it 
(including within Russian-language 
universities). 
Thanks to the Commission’s efforts 
to develop the national language, 
new teaching methodologies for 
Kyrgyz have been developed. They 
replace the old ones, often very 
cumbersome and ineffective, and 
introduce short dialogues, games 
and concrete examples. 
With 3,000 copies of the 
course in circulation, it is 
nonetheless difficult to meet 
the needs of the more than 
2,100 schools (1,700 of them 
entirely Kyrgyz) and the 40-
odd universities across the 
country, some of which give 
Kyrgyz classes. Besides, the 
state funds the publication 
of textbooks for schools, but 
not for universities. Result: 
university textbooks simply 
don’t exist. 
The mixed linguistic results 
in Kyrgyzstan bring up ques-
tions about the methods em-
ployed. Is it really useful to 
impose a language without develop-
ing the educational infrastructure? 
Measures taken to preserve the 
Kyrgyz language must be entirely 
revised, in the context of globaliza-
tion, which here too is knocking at 
the door with English and becom-
ing more and more of a threat.

cultural expression of the nomadic Kyrgyz 
people, the great Kyrgyz epics, represent 
a veritable oral encyclopedia of Kyrgyz 
social values, cultural knowledge and 
collective memory. The Akyns’ art of 
storytelling, which combines spirited 
singing, improvisation and musical 
composition, is performed at religious
