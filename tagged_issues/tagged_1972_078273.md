'Aloalos' twelve feet high
The people of Madagascar decorate their tombs with distinctive and often surprising effigies
that differ from one part of the island to another. The Mahafali, who live in the arid south¬
west corner of Madagascar, raise totem-like carved wooden planks called "aloalos". Between
six and twelve feet high, they are topped with wooden statuettes of people, animals, houses,
bicycles, aeroplanes, motor-cars and many other figures that may recall the work or the interests
of the dead person. A proud pair of ducks surmount the "aloalo" shown here and the carving
of a zebu on another tomb is seen in the background. Figures of these long-horned cattle figure
on many tombs since the zebu not only occupies an important place in daily life, but also has a
religious significance. Funeral ceremonies are traditionally accompanied by the sacrifice of a
zebu to venerate the dead.

Conventional insecticides are needed
to control 80 to 90 per cent
of the insect problems affecting
agriculture and public health
today, says American scientist
Norman E. Borlaug in reply to those
who urge the banning of DDT
(see page 4). Research to find new
techniques and methods must be
strengthened, he says, but pesticides
and chemical fertilizers remain
indispensable if agricultural yields
are to be raised without increasing
the areas under cultivation; in this
way they contribute indirectly to
the preservation of animal and plant
life by reducing the encroachment
on forest, marshland, etc. Photo

### 51958: In defence of DDT and other pesticides
The 'Father of the Green Revolution' speaks out
IN DEFENCE OF ffif
AND OTHER PESTICIDES
Jr\re pesticides and chemical fertilizers as harmful as some people
claim? The "Unesco Courier" has devoted space in the past to opposing views
on this controversial question, on the one hand favourable to DDT and pesticides
(Gene Gregory in "The Magic of Modern Chemistry", June 1971) and a number
of articles pointing to the danger of DDT and other pesticides ("Man the Killer
of Nature", a U.N. report on problems of the environment, August-September
1970; "SOS Environment", a message from 2,200 scientists, July 1971). In
addition, our Letters to the Editor column has contained many letters opposing
the use of DDT etc.
In this issue we publish large extracts from the 1971 McDougall Memorial
Lecture delivered on November 8, 1971, at the Food and Agriculture Organization
in Rome by Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E. Borlaug. Dr Borlaug was
awarded the Nobel Prize for his contribution to the Green Revolution in agri¬
culture (see page 6). His address was entitled "Mankind and Civilization at
Another Crossroads". Here Dr. Borlaug makes a vigorous refutation of the
campaigns being staged in the name of the protection of the environment
against chemical products such as DDT and certain fertilizers. Dr. Borlaug
considers that not only do these products do a great deal more good than harm,
but that their use is essential to the survival of a large portion of mankind,
particularly in the developing world.

VNCE again the "Naked
Ape" homo sapiens stands at a
crossroad. Before deciding along
which road to proceed, he hesitates
and glances behind at the long road
he has trod.
He is both amazed and proud of the
tremendous progress he has achieved
as he manoeuvred and advanced along
the pitfall-laden trail of human survival
during the brief period he has inhab¬
ited the planet Earth. Within the last
second representing a short 5 million
years as measured on the geologic
clock he remembers emerging from
the bush somewhere in south-east
Africa, standing upright on his back
legs and beginning to assume the role
of Desmond Morris's so-called "Naked
Ape".
With a club in one hand and a rock
in the other, he stalked animals and
became a carnivore. For a long time
he struggled for survival as a hunter
and food gatherer under the hostile
environmental pressures dispensed by
a fickle mother nature. More than
once he barely averted extinction. He
remembers having seen certain other
species perish, because of their in¬
ability to adjust to the capriciousness
of the environment. They have left for
posterity only a fragmented history of
their existence recorded in the book
of fossil rocks.
During his long early period as a
hunter, social progress was negli¬
gible. Survival itself was man's only
sense of achievement. Then his help¬
mate, neolithic woman, only about
9,000 years ago, invented agriculture
and animal husbandry. This brought
new hope. It ensured his food supply
and lightened his load. Survival be¬
came less of a problem. The quality of
human life improved. It gave him time
for pleasure and time to think. There
was time to develop his intellect, a
society and, subsequently, a culture.
He made many worthwhile scientific
discoveries that made life more com
fortable, gratifying and enjoyable.
Among these were the discoveries of
control for many diseases that had
plagued and scourged him from the
beginning of time.
With «the control of diseases and the
resultant drop in death rates, combin¬
ed with a reliable food supply, human
population growth soared. The popu¬
lation monster looms ahead and now
threatens to obstruct further progress,
and even to erode progress already
achieved, unless tamed.
All these events that have taken
place along the tortuous road of
human progress over which the Naked
Ape has travelled, flash back to him
now, as he hesitates and reflects be¬
fore turning forward again to make
the necessary decision as to which
road to choose, at this, the most com¬
plex series of crossroads and inter¬
sections that he has ever encountered
along the highway of social evolution.
He realizes, as he now meditates his
decision, that the world civilization has
split into two factions the privileged
world of the developed nations and
the improverished world of the devel¬
oping nations. One is living a life

Wheat ruined by the granary weevil. An estimated 20 per cent of the annual world food crop
plantings is destroyed or damaged by diseases, insects and other pests.
of luxury never before experienced by
man outside the proverbial Garden of
Eden; the other still leads a life of mis¬
ery built on poverty. Discordant voices
cry out to counsel him now concern¬
ing his choice at the next crossroad.
One of the siren songs is that of
the so-called establishment which
counsels continuing on the road that
has brought the high standard of liv¬
ing to the developed or privileged
nations. This infers that these benefits
can be extended to those in the under¬
developed world by following the
same path.
A second tone cries out against the
establishment and the materialistic
world, even while they themselves are
living as social drop-outs, social para¬
sites in reality.
The third, and most seductive voice,
is that of those extreme environmen¬
talists who discredit science and advo¬
cate a back to nature movement. They
demand the discontinuation of the use
of chemical compounds even though
they are absolutely essential for pro¬
tecting man against diseases, and for
restoring fertility to the worn out soil
so man can produce his food, and pro
tect his crops against the ravages of
weeds, diseases and insects.
Civilization as it is known today
could not have evolved, nor can it
survive, without an adequate food
supply. Yet, food is something that is
taken for granted by most world
leaders, despite the fact that more
than half of the population of the
world is hungry and an even larger
proportion malnourished.
With the help of our science we
must not only increase our food sup¬
plies, but also ensure them against
biological and physical catastrophes,
through international efforts involv¬
ing both developed and developing
nations.
International granaries for food re¬
serves financed by all nations should
be established for use in case of need.
These granaries should be strategic¬
ally located in different geographical
areas so as to simplify logistics in
time of emergencies. And these food
reserves must be made available to all
who need them and before famine
strikes, not afterwards.
Man can and must prevent the
tragedy of famine in the future instead
of merely trying with pious regret to
salvage the human wreckage of the
famine, as he has so often done in
the past. We will be guilty of criminal
negligence, without extenuation, if we
permit future famines. Humanity can¬
not any longer tolerate that guilt.
The destiny of world civilization
depends upon providing a decent
standard of living for all mankind. It
has been said that "Universal and
lasting peace can be established only
if it is based upon social justice. If
you desire peace, cultivate justice".
Almost certainly, however, the first
essential component of social justice is
adequate food for all mankind.
I feel that the aforementioned guid¬
ing principle must be modified to read:
"If you desire peace, cultivate justice,
but at the same time cultivate the
fields efficiently to produce more
bread; otherwise there will be no
peace."
During the past five years, spectac¬
ular progress has been made in in¬
creasing wheat, rice and maize produc¬
tion in several of the most populous
developing countries of southern Asia,
where widespread famine appeared

IN DEFENCE OF DDT (Continued)
inevitable only six years ago. Most
of the increase in production has re¬
sulted from increased yields of grain
per hectare, a particularly important
development because there is little
possibility of expanding the cultivated
area in the densely populated areas
of Asia.
The term "Green Revolution" has
been used by the popular press to
describe the spectacular increase in
cereal grain production during the
past five years. Perhaps the term
Green Revolution, as commonly used,
is premature, too optimistic, or too
broad in scope. Too often it seems
to convey the impression of a general
revolution in yields per hectare and in
total production of all crops throughout
vast areas comprising many countries.
These implications both oversimplify
and distort the facts. The only crops
which have been appreciably affected
up to the present time are wheat, rice
and maize. Yields of other important
cereals, such as sorghums, millets and
barley, have been only slightly affect¬
ed; nor has there been any appreci¬
able increase in yield or production of
the pulse or legume grain crops, which
are essential in the diets of cereal
consuming populations. Moreover, it
must be emphasized that thus far the
great increase in production has been
in irrigated areas.
Nevertheless, the number of farmers,
small as well as large, who are adopt¬
ing the new seeds and new technology
is increasing very rapidly, and the in¬
crease in numbers during the past four
years has been phenomenal. Cereal
production in the rainfed areas still
remains relatively unaffected by the
impact of the Green Revolution, but
significant change has been made in
several countries during the past three
years.
Despite these qualifications, how¬
ever, tremendous progress has been
made in increasing cereal production
in India, Pakistan and the Philippines
during the past three years. Other
countries that are beginning to show
significant increases in production
include Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil,
Ceylon, Indonesia, Israel, Iran, Kenya,
Malaysia, Morocco, Thailand, Tunisia
and Turkey.
Before attempting to evaluate the
significance Of the Green Revolution
one must establish the point of view
of the appraiser. The Green Revolu¬
tion has entirely different meanings to
most people in the affluent nations of
the "privileged world" than to those in
the developing nations of the "forgot¬
ten world".
Most people in industrialized socie¬
ties have difficulty in comprehending
and appreciating the vital significance
of providing high-yielding strains of
wheat, rice, maize, sorghum and millet
for the people of the developing
nations.
There are no miracles in agricultural
production. Nor is there such a thing
as a miracle variety of wheat, rice or
maize which can serve as an elixir to
cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional .
agriculture. Nevertheless, it is the
Mexican dwarf wheat varieties and
their newer derivatives that have been
the principal catalyst which triggered
off the Green Revolution.
If the high-yielding dwarf wheat and
rice varieties were the catalysts that
ignited the Green Revolution, then
chemical fertilizer was the fuel that
powered its forward thrust. The res¬
ponsiveness of the high-yielding varie¬
ties has greatly increased fertilizer
consumption. The new varieties not
only respond to much heavier dosages
of fertilizer than the old ones but are
also much more efficient in its use.
The continued success of the Green
Revolution will hinge, however, upon
whether agriculture will be permitted to
use the inputs agricultural chemicals
including chemical fertilizers and
pesticides, both absolutely necessary
to cope with hunger. If agriculture is
denied their use because of unwise
legislation that is now being promoted
by a powerful lobby group of hysteri¬
cal environmentalists who are pro¬
voking fear by predicting doom for
the world through chemical poison¬
ing then the world will be doomed
but not by chemical poisoning, but
from starvation.
The current vicious, hysterical pro¬
paganda campaign against the use of
agricultural chemicals, being promoted
today by fear-provoking, irresponsible
environmentalists, had its genesis in
the best-selling "half-science, half-fic¬
tion novel" S/7ent Spring, published
in 1962.
This poignant, powerful book
written by the talented scientist Rachel
Carson sowed the seeds for the pro¬
paganda whirlwind and the press, radio
and television circuses that are being
sponsored in the name of conserva¬
tion today.

other countries. The Borlaug techniques
have since been applied to rice, corn,
potatoes, cotton, millet and other crops.
The International Rice Research Institute,
set up in the Philippines in 1962, assembled
some 10,000 strains of rice from every
corner of the world and began a patient
process of crossbreeding to produce a
dwarf rice strain comparable to the wheats.
Combining a dwarf variety from Taiwan
with a tall variety from Indonesia, the Cen¬
tre produced "IR-8", a new strain that can
easily double the yield of most local rices
in Asia. This rice and other new varieties
since developed have saved millions from
starvation. Left, an agriculturalist at Hyde¬
rabad's Andrah Pradesh Agricultural Uni¬
versity prepares a rice plant for cross¬
breeding with a different strain. Right, cen¬
turies of toil went into the construction of
these terraced rice fields in the Philippines
which, thanks to the new rice strains, has
become a net exporter of rice.
It is both sad and unfortunate that
Silent Spring was the last book
which was written by this gentle, great
scientist and authoress. She had pre¬
viously contributed so much to the
understanding of the beauties of
nature in the best-sellers Under the
Wind and The Sea Around Us.
The gravest defect of Silent Spring
was that it presented a very in¬
complete, inaccurate and oversimpli¬
fied picture of the needs of the
interrelated, worldwide, complex prob¬
lems of health, food, fibre, wildlife,
recreation and human population. It
made no mention of the importance
of chemicals such as fertilizers and
pesticides for producing and protect¬
ing our food and fibre crops. Nor did
it mention that by producing more
food per unit of cultivated area more
land would be available for other
uses, including recreation and wildlife.
Certainly the greatest inexcusable
error of omission was that of neglect¬
ing to mention the valuable role DDT
has played in bringing malaria under
control in many countries.
Silent Spring convinced the general
public that the use of pesticides and
especially DDT was upsetting the
"balance of nature" and was doing
great damage to wildlife, especially
birds and fishes. It implied that' a
number of species were facing
extinction because of its use.
Moreover, it left the impression that
agriculture really did not need insecti¬
cides if it changed its methods. It
indicated that farmers by adopting a
system of extensive mono-culture,
have made their crops more vulner¬
able to pests than necessary.
According to this expert, farmers
have compounded their errors more
by applying insecticides in attempting
to kill insect pests and in the process
have generally only killed off the
predators, parasites and pathogens
that normally kept the insect under
control, and thereby only further upset
the "balance of nature."
Moreover, according to the author,
insects have invariably soon developed
resistance to the insecticide. It
implied that, by shifting to other suit¬
able insect control measures already
available, the losses from insects
could be kept under control without
chemicals.
I am in complete agreement that we
should try to preserve all forms of
wildlife as part of our heritage, as far
as it is possible to do so. On the
other hand, let us not become
egotistical to the point of assuming
supernatural powers. A glance at the
book of rocks tells us of the im-
potency of many species, including man
against the forces of nature. Yet it
is incredible that only a few, if any,
of the leaders of the current environ¬
mentalist movement have studied
palaeontology and the "parade of the
species," in the geologic past.
Spencer estimates that 99 per cent
of all the species that have lived,
since the candle of life was first lit on
the planet earth about 3.2 billion years
ago, have flunked the adaptation
imperative: "evolve or perish," and
consequently have now become
extinct.
The implied command: "evolve or
perish" has been an unwritten natural
law from the beginning of time. It is
equally evident in the physical and
biological world.

IN DEFENCE OF DDT (Continued)
The multitude of changes in the
physical features of the earth, as well
as In our solar system itself, have
repeatedly greatly modified the en¬
vironment of the earth. Climates have
changed time and again in many parts
of our world. Vast areas that once
possessed tropical climates have sub¬
sequently been covered by continental
ice sheets. Areas that once were
blessed with heavy rainfall have
become desert and vice versa. These
changes in environments have, in
turn, exerted strong selection pressure
on the evolution of all forms of life.
There are undoubtedly many subtle
changes being exerted on the environ¬
ment of the planet today that are
beyond the influence and control of
man. Man too, however, is exerting
strong influence on the environment.
The composite effect of the present
day selection pressure of the environ¬
ment, affected both by. natural and
human influences, will undoubtedly
continue to take its toll of some
species that are poorly adapted to
the current world environment.
Rhodes, Zim and Shaffer estimate
that there are at present approxima¬
tely 1,100,000 species of animals,
many of them very simple forms, and
350,000 species of plants that currently
inhabit the planet earth. Of these,
the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service in 1966 listed 33 species of
mammals, 49 species of birds and
9 species of reptiles and amphibians,
and 38 species of fish in the U.S.A.,
which were either rare or endangered.
In discussing the causes for
reduction in numbers and possible
disappearance of these 129 species,
the destruction of the habitat and
disturbances resulting from man's
activities were paramount. Pesticides
were mentioned as possible contribut¬
ing factors in only two cases. In the
past three or four years there has
been much propaganda, but little
convincing scientific evidence, put
forward by environmentalists indicat¬
ing that DDT has contributed to the
decline of the Bald Eagle, Peregrine
Falcon, American Osprey and Califor-
nian Condor.
One does not need a thin egg shell
hypothesis due to DDT to explain the
reduction in the population of these
species. The truth of the matter is
that many ornithologists had reported
on the reduction in populations of
these large birds of prey as far back
as the 1880s and 1890s, long before
the time of DDT. It is almost a fore¬
gone conclusion, for anyone who uses
some common sense, that one or
more of these species is about to
flunk the imperative "evolve or perish."
Their habitats are being destroyed by
the encroachment of man.
Protective legislation alone will not,
in most cases, be adequate to save
them. Dynamic research, propagation
and good sound game management
might do so, providing human popula-

### 51958: In defence of DDT and other pesticides
KILLERS... PLUNDERERS
Catrinee the appearance of DDT and other
chemical pesticides 25 years ago, says the World Health
Organization, it has been possible, for the first time, to
combat the host of mosquitoes, fleas, lice, bugs, flies and
other insects that are responsible for many of the diseases
that plague the world. In the words of a 1971 WHO state¬
ment: "At one time, DDT was used against a host of insect-
borne diseases : not only malaria, but plague, typhus, yellow
fever, dengue, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, filariasis.
sleeping sickness, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, etc. How¬
ever, suitable alternatives have now become available for
use against most of these diseases ; but DDT must be retained
for the control of malaria transmitted by mosquitoes and the
sleeping sickness transmitted by tsetse flies".

fight against this scourge, excellent results have been
obtained, since 1 945, by the spraying of chemical insecticides.

IN DEFENCE OF DDT (Continued from page 8)

### 51958: In defence of DDT and other pesticides
The banning of pesticides and chemical fertilizers
would result in starvation and world chaos
tion pressures on their habitat are
not too great.
Although it is generally the long-
term continuing changes in the envi¬
ronment which exert their effects on
the evolution and survival or the
extinction of a species, there are
many other changes in the environ¬
ment that effect the more short-
term "balance of nature," among the
many species in a given habitat or
ecosystem. These are the seasonal
shifts we are concerned with in
producing and protecting our crops
or animals.
The cliché "in balance with nature,"
which is in common usage today by
modern environmentalists is very mis¬
leading. It implies we would have a
favourable "in balance with nature"
to assure the protection of our crop
species if the "balance of nature"
were not upset by man. This, of
course, is not true. Nor is there in
existence a single "in balance with
nature" ecosystem. Rather there is,
within a given area, an infinite number
of local and many more extensive
merging ecosystems.
None of them are in static equili¬
brium. They are in a constant state
of dynamic change, responding to the
changes in the environment. At
different times, the selection pressure
provoking change is drought, floods,
frosts, heat, insect or disease attacks,
or invasion of the habitat by other
species.

or wilderness area completely isolat¬
ed from the influence of man, I learn¬
ed of the fickleness of nature. I have
seen 20 forest fires ignited by a
single "dry thunder (electric) storm".
Some of these fires started by lightning
destroyed or damaged vast areas
of several forest types (ecosystems).
In the same area I have seen tens
of thousands of acres of lodgepole
pine killed by Dendroctonus spp.,
infestation. The havoc done by the
Dendroctonus beetle should not have
happened according to some pseudo-
ecologists, for it was, after all, a native
insect pest with its entire army of
natural predators, parasites and patho¬
gens, and consequently should have
been "in balance with nature."
Many times I have seen attempts
made to grow cotton without the use
of insecticides in the native home of
the boll weevil in Mexico where all of
the native predators of this insect were
present. The results were disastrous.
In fact, it was difficult to tell from
casual observation whether the cotton
was being grown for the production of
fibre to clothe man or for the product¬
ion of feed for a native insect. Never¬
theless, there should have been,
according to our environmentalist
jargon, an "in balance with nature"
equilibrium.
I must also point out that modern
agriculture with 3,700 million people
demanding food and fibre has no
choice but to grow extensive areas to
a single crop in areas ecologically
best suited to the culture of that crop.
This was not true 5,000 years ago,
when there was less population
pressure, so that crops could be
grown in small isolated fields.
It therefore becomes abundantly
clear that we cannot rely on biological
control alone to protect our food and
fibre crops from the fickleness of
nature. If we leave things to mother
nature's whims, we will harvest only
one third or one half of the yield per
unit of cultivated area that can be
harvested using a modern balanced
technological package of practices.
Dr. Knipling has clearly indicated
that we must, for the forseeable future,
continue to use an integrated
approach to control the insect pests
of man, of the crops and of the ani¬
mals on which he depends. Insect
control is a complex problem for there
are more than 200 insects that are or
have been important on our main
crops, animals and forests. We will
need to use an integrated approach
to hold them in abeyance.
It is true that in the past few
decades spectacular control of a few
insect species have been obtained
with biological, bio-environmental or
other non-chemical methods i.e.
cottony-cushion scale of citrus, the
spotted alfalfa aphid and the screw-
worm of livestock in Florida.
Some day it may be possible to use
alternate non-chemical methods to
control many of the insects respon¬
sible for the most severe crop and
animal losses, but that day, if ever
attainable, lies far in the future.
Today, however, conventional in¬
secticides are needed to control 80 to
90 per cent of the insect problems
affecting agriculture and public health.
Meanwhile, research to find new
techniques and methods, must be
strengthened. Present control pro¬
grammes must be designed to take
advantage of the best materials and
techniques available so as to reduce
losses to an acceptable level.
The environmentalists would now
like to have a legislative ban placed
on DDT so as to prohibit it for any
use in the U.S.A. Almost certainly as
soon as this is achieved, these
organizations will begin a worldwide
propaganda barrage to have it banned
everywhere. This must not be per¬
mitted to happen, until an even more
effective and safer insecticide is
available, for no chemical has ever
done as much as DDT to improve the
health, economic and social benefits
of the people of the developing
nations.
The World Health Organization
(WHO), with the assistance of the Pan
American Health Organization and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNI¬
CEF), in 1955 launched a worldwide
campaign against malaria, based on
spraying the interior of all houses with
DDT, so as to kill the Anopheline vec¬
tor and break the cycle.
Of the 124 countries and territories
in the tropics where malaria has exist¬
ed, the disease has been eradicated
from 19. There are 48 other countries
in which eradication programmes are
in progress and an additional 37 where
extensive control programmes are
under way. There remain only 20
nations in malarial areas where no
programmes have yet been initiated.
I HERE is also dramatic evi¬
dence from Ceylon of what can hap¬
pen if a programme is stopped before
eradication is accomplished. When
the campaign was initiated in the mid
1950s there were more than two mil¬
lion cases of malaria in Ceylon. By
1962 it had dropped to 31 cases and
by 1963 to 17, at which point the spray
programme was discontinued for bud¬
getary reasons. By 1967 the number
of cases had jumped to 3,000 and by
1968 to more than 16,000. Before the
programme could be re-established,
in late 1969, two million cases had
reappeared.
In summarizing the progress in this
world wide malaria campaign on
February 2, 1971, officials of WHO
made the following statement:
"More than 1,000 million people have
been freed from the risk of malaria
in the past 25 years, mostly thanks to
DDT. This is an achievement unparal¬
leled in the annals of public health.
But even today 329 million people are
being protected from malaria through
DDT spraying operations for malaria
control or total eradication.
"The improvement in health resulting
from malaria campaigns has broken the
vicious circle of poverty and disease
resulting in ample economic benefits:
increased production of rice (and
wheat), because the labour force is
able to work, and the opening up of
vast areas for agricultural production.
"The safety record of DDT to man is
truly remarkable. At the height of its
production 400,000 tons a year were
used for agriculture, forestry, public

health, etc. Yet in spite of prolonged
exposure by hundreds of millions of
people, and the heavy occupational
exposure of considerable numbers, the
only confirmed cases of injury have
been the result of massive accidental
or suicidal swallowing of DDT. There
is no evidence in man that DDT is
causing cancer or genetic change."
Although more than 1,400 chemicals
have been tested by WHO for use in
malarial campaigns, only two have
shown promise and both of these are
far inferior to DDT.
As more and more scientific evi¬
dence accumulates, the charges
against DDT become less and less
convincing. There is evidence, of
course, that man and most species of
birds, fish and animals that have been
examined have small quantities of DDT
and/or other related componds such
as polychlorinated bi-phenyls in their
fat. But there is very little convincing
evidence available to date which indi¬
cates that it is threatening the exis¬
tence of any species, nor is it causing
any discernible injury to man.
Part of the past confusion concern¬
ing pesticides in the environment
derives from the tremendous improve¬
ments that have been made in recent
years in chemical analysis. With gas
chromotography it became possible to
detect 1 or 2 parts per billion, or even
a few parts per trillion, both of which,
of course, would have gone unnoticed
20 years ago. But such sensitive
methods can also detect contaminants
and in the hands of inexpert operat¬
ors may lead to wrong conclusions.
A recent article by Dr. Thomas H.
Jukes, a reputable biochemist, empha¬
sizes this dilemma: "How reliable is
the test? There has been a great hue
and cry over alleged traces of DDT
in the Antarctic penguins, amounts of
the order of 1 or 2 parts per billion.
I have not yet been convinced of the
validity of these results."
A few months ago at the University
of Wisconsin, some soil samples that
had been sealed since 1910 were test¬
ed for synthetic organochlorine pesti¬
cides by the latest, most delicate gas
chromotographic procedure. Several
pesticides were detected in 32 of the
34 samples. The only flaw was that
these pesticides not only were not
used in 1910, they did not even exist
until 1940.
Another complication is that the
residues of a class of modern com¬
pound called polychlorinated bi-phenyls
(P.C.B.'s) interfere with the DDT test.
The P.C.B.'s are used in water-proofing
compounds, asphalt, waxes, synthetic
adhesives, hydraulic fluids, electrical
apparatus and general plastics. They
are widely distributed in the fat of
wildlife species, in which they have
originated as industrial wastes taken
up by aquatic species. To sum up,
P.C.B.'s are not used as pesticides,
but they interfere with pesticides resi¬
due analysis and they are toxic.
Another complicating factor in iden¬
tifying the origin of chlorinated hydro¬
carbons in human, animal, bird or fish
tissue is that many thousands of tons
of chemical wastes of all kinds have
been and are still being dumped into
the oceans. Do not some of these
also get into the food chain, even if
they still have not got into the "hys¬
terical word chain"?
IT is now obvious that the
current aim is to ban DDT, first in
the USA, and then in the world if
possible. But DDT is only the first of
the dominoes. But it is the toughest
of all to knock out because of its
excellent known contributions and
safety record.
As soon as DDT is successfully
banned, there will be a push for the
banning of all chlorinated hydrocar¬
bons, then in order, the organic phos¬
phates and carbamate insecticides.
Once the task is finished on insecti¬
cides, they will attack the weed-killers,
and eventually the fungicides. As a
matter of fact, by default, they have
already been successful in having
organic mercury seed disinfectants and
slimeicides for papermills banned.
This ban was achieved during all of

the confusion resulting from finding
mercury in fish, first in fresh water
species, in the Great Lakes, and rivers
of the USA, and subsequently in both
tuna and swordfish. The ridiculous¬
ness of some of this rhetoric came to
light recently when someone analysed
tuna caught 90 years ago and found it
contained about the same level of mer¬
cury as those caught today.
Moreover, it has been shown that
swordfish recently caught in ocean
waters hundreds of miles from possi¬
ble industrial contamination contained
1 to 2 p.p.m. of mercury. This indicates
clearly that both tuna and swordfish
are picking up the low levels of mer¬
cury from the ocean food chains, of
which this metal has always been a
part.
If the use of pesticides in the USA
were to be completely banned, crop
losses would probably soar to 50 per
cent, and food prices would increase
4 to 5 fold. Who then would provide
for the food needs of the low income
groups? Certainly not the privileged
environmentalists.
Within the past decade, because of
the improved technology and higher
yields, it has been possible to remove
50 million acres from cultivation and
still meet both the domestic and export
needs for agricultural products. Were
the USA still relying on the 1940
technology, however, not only would
the 50 million acres now held in reserve
be back under the plough, but an
additional area of 241.9 million acres
by necessity would have been opened
to cultivation. In reality it would require
considerably more than 241.9 million
acres of additional land since the
quality of the land would be poorer
than that now in cultivation.
In order to bring under cultivation
an additional 241.9 million acres (and
perhaps considerably more because of
the poorer land quality) it would be
necessary to open to cultivation lands
that were in a large part rolling or
semi-arid, and consequently vulnerable
to erosion by water and wind.
It would also require clearing the
forests from large areas so as to meet
the food, feed, oil and fibre needs of
the nation. Now reflect on the addi¬
tional havoc that this expansion of
cultivated area would do to wildlife
habitat, and especially on rare and
endangered species of animals and
birds that are already on the brink
of extinction.
Looking at it from another angle
291,9 million acres of land, an area
roughly equivalent to the total land
area of the USA east of the Missis¬
sippi river and south of the Ohio river,
is today available for other uses,
because of the improvements in crop
production technology that have taken
place in the past 30 years. These uses * u

the efficiency of agriculture throughout
the world if we wish to alleviate human
suffering, conserve wildlife and im¬
prove recreational opportunities. Un¬
less the food production of East Africa
is expanded to meet the growing food
needs, the large animals in the Game
Reserves of East Africa will be poach¬
ed out of existence within the next
three decades. Similarly, the elephant,
tiger, and peacock will perish from
India because of population pressure.
It is hard to understand why the
conservation organizations and envi¬
ronmentalists have taken a negative
rather than positive view in trying to
protect wildlife. Why have they not
promoted research and fought for more
funds for game management in gen¬
eral? Why have they not fought for
more funds for research so that
qualified scientists can be assigned to
study the reasons why certain threat¬
ened species are on the verge of
extinction, and whether it is feasible to
try to save them?
Why do they not spend more of
their energies and funds on educating
the public on the adverse effects of
population pressure and rampant popu¬
lation growth on wildlife and the envi¬
ronment? How many of the US public,
for example, know that more than
100,000 deer are killed each year by
automobiles, whereas everyone is
informed in the press or television
whenever a few birds or fish are
found dead, presumably but this is
not necessarily proven from a pesti¬
cide?
Imagine the rhetoric that would be
produced if 100,000 deer were killed
by a pesticide.
I have been a great admirer of the
spendid work that has been done by
game management experts in the USA
in re-establishing species, such as the
wild turkey, that were nearly extinct.
Under wise management and protec¬
tion many other species of wildlife have
made spectacular comebacks. The
tremendous success of the introduc¬
tion of the Chinese ring-neck pheasant,
the Hungarian and Chukkar partridge,
are other tremendous accomplish¬
ments. The research that has brought
under control the lamprey, that threat¬
ened the survival of the lake trout is
another tremendous achievement; so
is the introduction of Coho salmon
into Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
The breeding of faster growing and
more sturdy salmon is another tremen¬
dous step forward.
I repeat what I have said many times
before: without thinking, conservation¬
ists and environmentalists and only
partially-informed people in the com¬
munications media have embarked on
a crusade designed to end the use of
agricultural chemicals, such as pesti¬
cides and fertilizers. They give no
thought to the end result of such
action: the eventual starvation and
political chaos that will plague the
world.
SIX INTERNATIONAL CENTRES
FOR TESTING NEW IN-SECTICIDES
The World Health Organization has set up six international centres for
the evaluation and testing of new Insecticides and six stations for village-
scale trials. WHO research helps to develop new weapons against
harmful insects replacements for the classic insecticides, which would
be effective yet safe for large scale use, and biodegradable, and to
which insects would be unlikely to become resistant It also seeks for
alternative methods of biological or genetic control of Insects. To destroy
mosquito larvae in areas where resistance to DDT has developed, fish-
breeding centres are being developed in a number of countries (U.S.,
Iran, Greece, Italy, etc.) in which larvae-eating fish called "Gambusia"
(right) are raised for' release in ponds and lakes In infested areas. One
Gambusia eats about 100 larvae per hour. Ladybirds, which have an
insatiable appetite for aphids (photo above), are being raised by the
million to reduce the damage caused by these insects to fruit trees.
The Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic
Energy Agency are experimenting with new means of fighting certain
insects, such as the Mediterranean fly which attacks fruit, by the sterili¬
zation of male Insects by Irradiation.

/% CROSS the deserts of
Asia from Arabia to Mongolia, outlines
of fields and canals, traces of by¬
gone farming and remnants of former
settlements still mark the sites of
ancient irrigation systems.
Those who have travelled to these
places long remember the majestic
ruins of cities with their formidable
walls and towers, the dried-up canal
beds and the vestiges of skilfully laid
out but long-unploughed fields. Here,
long ago, the farmer reaped bounteous
harvests of wheat and cultivated
grapes and melons.
In our day, every new achievement
in science and engineering, every new
improvement in technology, working
tools and production as a whole re¬
moves us further and further from the
long-forgotten and imperfect farming
methods and techniques of Antiquity.
But these ancient skills and tech¬
niques should interest not only a small
circle of scholars. Historians and ar¬
chaeologists say that a knowledge of
the concrete experience of long-van¬
ished civilizations is of great econo¬
mic value. Information about the dis¬
tribution and nature of the now dry
canals, for instance, can be used in
evaluating water resources and in de-

studies, including an extensive monograph

Sea region, and several books on the
peoples of Africa. He is senior scientific

signing the basic course of major
canals, and particularly in laying out
networks of small irrigation ditches.
The lands that were irrigated in
Antiquity make up one of the most
potentially productive zones in the
world: each irrigated hectare of land
in the desert zone is four to five times
more productive than a hectare of non-
irrigated land.
In the last 20 years, the area under
irrigation throughout the world has in¬
creased nearly threefold from 80 mil¬
lion to 220 million hectares (200 mil¬
lion to 560 million acres). Today,
scientists are preparing an even more
decisive attack on the desert, and our
knowledge of its past can make a
valuable contribution to this campaign.
One Soviet scientist, V. V. Dokucha-
yev, has defined the soil as, "a natural-
historical body" which reflects every
change in natural conditions climate,
water conditions, vegetation and so
on. During many centuries man's eco¬
nomic activity too has left its indel¬
ible traces in the soil.
Through a process lasting centuries,
thousands of tons of salts were carri¬
ed by water supply systems to every
hectare of irrigated land, and these
salts remained even after the cultivat¬
ed lands turned into desert.
In ancient times, the struggle against
salinity required the efforts of a whole
army of workers to remove the surface
layers of salts and carry them beyond
the irrigated plots. In the state lands
around Basra (Iraq), according to al-
Tabari, a celebrated Arab historian of
the Middle Ages, this work was done
by thousands of black Zinji slaves.

Complex irrigation systems using a wide variety of storage tanks and canals existed on the Indus

Today's irrigation engineers have much to learn from their ancient counterparts In the matter of
siting water supply systems to reclaim now arid but once fertile lands. Left, among other machines
that help modern man to tame the deserts is this Soviet channel digger which cuts a trench three
metres deep by 14 metres wide at the rate of about 100 metres a day. Ancient methods of lifting
water are still used by farmers in many lands. Above, this "sakiya", a revolving wheel turned by

ANCIENT IRRIGATION (Continued)
50,000 hectares of irrigated land were
abandoned and ultimately turned into
salt marshes.
Large areas of land in present-day
Iraq are saltridden, and it is no acci¬
dent that this problem has become the
central theme of historical and archaeo¬
logical research with long-term eco¬
nomic aims conducted in the Diala
River basin by Iraqi experts and
specialists from Chicago University's
Oriental Institute.
The study of thousands of large and
small ancient settlements has made it
possible to reconstruct a broad his¬
torical picture of life in the oasis, to
determine the size of the population
during various epochs, and to answer
many questions of practical signifi¬
cance for agriculture in the Republic
of Iraq today.
In 1954-1955, specialists working on
an assignment for Syria's Ministry of
Agriculture used aerial photo mosaics
of the Upper Gezir to draw up a map
of the ancient irrigation systems on
the river Habur. Many of these sys¬
tems have been reconstructed, and
crops now grow on what was only
recently desert land. It would .be ex¬
pedient to include in current develop¬
ment plans for arid zone countries a
broader utilization of formerly irrigated
lands.
Large-scale historical and archaeolo¬
gical research projects with these aims
have been under way for several dec¬
ades now in the. Soviet Union, where
the remains of ancient irrigation sys¬
tems have been located over an area
of eight to ten million hectares an
area equal to all the land presently
under irrigation in the U.S.S.R.
Half of the once-irrigated land lies
at the lower reaches of the large Cen¬
tral Asian rivers, the Amu Darya and
Syr Darya, along the shores of the
Aral Sea. The region has a warm cli¬
mate and a long, frost-free season, but
rainfall is low and farming is possible
only with artificial irrigation. All life
here depends on the river waters and
irrigation systems.
Armed with modern technology, the
farmer has begun to develop the once-
irrigated but now desert land surround¬
ing the oasis. All in all, the area
covers five million hectares.
The Khorezm archaeological and eth¬
nographical expedition of the U.S.S.R.

TREASURES
OF MEDIEVAL
BOHEMIA

\^NE of Europe's finest illu¬
minated manuscripts of the Roman¬
esque period, the 11th century Codex
of Vysehrad has recently been repro¬
duced in a superb facsimile edition in
Czechoslovakia. The facsimile, a
masterwork of modern printing techno¬
logy, was published with the assist¬
ance of the Czechoslovak National
Commission for Unesco, as a prelude
to its programme for International
Book Year 1972.
The Codex of Vysehrad, also known
as the Coronation Codex, was written
and illuminated on the order of Vra-
tislav I, to mark his coronation in 1085
as the first king of Bohemia. Vratis-
lav was the first prince of Bohemia's
ruling Premyslide dynasty to assume
the title of king, conferred on him by
the Emperor Henry IV.
Vratislav's coronation codex, today
preserved in the Czechoslovak State
Library in Prague, is an illuminated La¬
tin text of readings from the Gospels,
consisting of 108 parchment sheets,
41.4 cm. by 34 cm. Twenty-six pages
carry pictures of the Evangelists, four
others retrace the genealogy of Christ
and a further four are inspired by
scenes from the old Testament. A
Christological cycle recounts the life
of Christ in a series of 29 scenes.
The texts of the codex are inscribed
in Latin in majuscule (capital letter),
writing, and include many highly dec¬
orative initial letters. The manuscript
is held in a binding of wooden boards
covered in leather, and in a fragment
of the original remaining linen, overlaid
on the back cover by fragments of
richly decorated material.
The reproduction of a facsimile edi¬
tion of the manuscript was a challeng¬
ing task, involving many technical
problems. It was accomplished by
Pragopress Publishers, for their "Ci-
melia Bohémica" series of publications.
Before printing began, hundreds of
tests and verifications were carried
out: six zinc plates, each reproducing
a different colour, were needed for
every page.
Numerous corrections and modifica¬
tions were made before a page proof
was pulled, and when a perfect colour
register had been achieved, each proof
was submitted to the publishers' tech¬
nical committee for final approval.
Equally complicated and painstaking
work went into the reproduction of the
original binding. Guided by fragments
of the original material, a specialist
designed a five-colour brocade which
was woven on an ancient loom borrow¬
ed from a museum.
These combined efforts have en¬
abled the facsimile edition to restitute
to the Codex of Vysehrad an appear¬
ance whose original splendour had
been diminished by the centuries.
The facsimile edition comprises
222 pages, of the same size as the ori¬
ginal manuscript, printed in five or six
colours on art paper. Bound in bro¬
cade with a white leather back, it is
presented in a special leather case to¬
gether with a separate volume giving
a brief historical introduction by Fran-
tisek Kavka of Charles University,
Prague, and a commentary by Jiri
Masin, of the National Gallery, Prague.
The introduction and commentary are
published in Czech, English, Russian,
German and French.
In all, 780 numbered copies of the
Codex were published to mark the
50th anniversary of the establishment
of the independent State of Czecho¬
slovakia. One copy was presented to
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. René
Maheu, last year, by Mr. Joseph Groh-
man, representative of Czechoslo¬
vakia on the Unesco Executive Board.
The Codex of Vysehrad takes its
name from the church of Vysehrad, the
original owner of the manuscript, in
whose possession it remained until it
was acquired by the library of the
Seminary of the Archbishopric of
Prague in 1728. Some historians
believe that the manuscript was origin¬
ally prepared for the St Vitus Cathe¬
dral in Prague Castle, where the
coronation of the Czech kings took
place.

Opposite: "The Resurrection

extraordinary paintings in the
Codex of Vysehrad. Framed

tombs seem to float on their
golden background like
so many boats.
Below, detail from the painting
depicting "The End of Judas'
Betrayal", in which Judas

The Codex of Vysehrad is the larg¬
est and most magnificent of four exist¬
ing manuscripts which there is every
reason to believe came from the same
workshop. Of the three other manu¬
scripts, one is kept in the library of the
St Vitus Chapter in Prague castle and
the other two are in Poland where
they are believed to have been sent as
gifts shortly after their completion.
The Czech scholar Jan Kvet has des¬
cribed the decoration of the Codex of
Vysehrad and of the other manu¬
scripts in the same group as one of the
most important chapters in the history
of Bohemian art. Despite its affinities
with Bavarian miniatures, he writes,
it contains so many special features
that one would be justified in referring
to it as the first school of Bohemian
painting (1).
Palaeographical and liturgical analy¬
ses of these manuscripts, writes Jiri
Masin in his commentary to the fac¬
simile edition, suggest the wide in¬
fluence of the Regensburg scriptory.
But no analogies so far established can
explain the originality of style used
by the "Master of the Codex of Vy¬
sehrad" and followed by his assistants
who ¡Illuminated the rest of the manu¬
scripts in the group. There is no
doubt that this Master, a gifted and
inventive artist, has left a stamp of a
crystalline purity on this particular
expression of the 11th century art of
Romanesque book painting.
The theory that the Codex of Vy¬
sehrad was produced in the Brevnov
monastery seems justified. This mon¬
astery was one of the most active cul¬
tural centres in Bohemia and maintain¬
ed good relations with the reigning
Premyslide dynasty. According to Jiri
Masin, it is likely that an accomplished,
though today unknown, artist the
Master of the Codex of Vysehrad
was invited from abroad to Bohemia to
execute there, with the help of his
assistants, this princely order.

by P.V. Glob
\^NE spring morning in 1950,
two Danish farmworkers cutting peat
at Tollund Fen in central Jutland dis¬
covered a body in the peat layer they
had just uncovered. Looking down at
the well-preserved features, they could
only suppose that they had come
across the victim of a recent murder.
The police were soon on the scene,
and with them they brought represent¬
atives of the local museum, since
PETER V. GLOB is Director-General of Danish
Museums and Antiquities and Director of the
Danish National Museum in Copenhagen. An
internationally known archaeologist and a
leading authority on Danish prehistory, he
has directed numerous excavations in Den¬
mark, Greenland and the Persian Gulf. For
further reading on the Bog People, see Prof.
Glob's "The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Pre¬
served" (Faber and Faber, London, and Cor¬
nell University Press, New York, 1969; Pala¬
din, London, 1971). Among Prof. Glob's other
books on archaeology are 'Ard and the
Plough' (1951), "Rock Carvings in Denmark"
(1969), and "The Mound People" (1970). His
latest book, 'Danish Prehistoric Monuments"
(Faber and Faber, 1971) is an exceptionally
attractive account of the rich heritage of
archaeological remains in Denmark, from the
Stone Age to the Vikings.
well-preserved remains of Iron Age
men were not unknown in the region.
I was hastily summoned from Aarhus
University and, that same evening,
bent over the discovery, I found my¬
self face to face with an Iron Age man
who had been deposited in the peat¬
bog some two thousand years earlier.
The dead man lay on his right side
in a natural attitude of sleep. The
head was to the west, with the face
turned to the south; the legs were to
the east. He lay fifty yards out from
firm ground and had been covered by
eight or nine feet of peat.
On his head he wore a pointed skin
cap fastened securely under the chin
by a hide thong, and round his waist
was a smooth hide belt. Otherwise
he was naked. His hair was cropped
short and he was clean-shaven,
although his chin and upper lip were
covered with very short stubble.
Round his neck was a rope made
of two leather thongs twisted together
and drawn tight into his throat in a
noose and then coiled like a snake
over his shoulder and down across
the back.
The Tollund man's head was remark¬
ably well preserved, the best pre¬
served human head, in fact, to have
survived from antiquity in any part of
the world. The dead man's lightly-
closed eyes and half-closed lips give
the face a distinctive expression,
calling to mind the words of the
world's oldest heroic epic, the Gil-
gamesh, "the dead and the sleeping,
how they resemble one another."
A wooden crate was assembled on
the site of the discovery so that the
Tollund man could be removed to the
National Museum in Copenhagen in
exactly the position in which he was
found.
The doctors and medico-legal
experts who examined him in Copen¬
hagen concluded that he had probably
been hanged rather than strangled by
the rope found round his neck.
X-Rays showed that the skull was
undamaged and the brain intact but
shrunken. The wisdom teeth had
developed indicating that the man
must have been appreciably over
twenty years old at the time of death.
An autopsy showed that the inner
organs, such as the heart, lungs, and
liver were well preserved as were the
stomach and the large and small
intestines which contained traces of
the dead man's last meal, eaten
between 12 and 24 hours before death.
Apparently this had consisted of a
gruel prepared from barley, linseed,
"gold of pleasure" and various other
weeds, but there was no trace of any
meat or fish.
After these exhaustive examinations,
the head underwent conservation
treatment, and was sent to the Silke-
borg Museum, not far from Tollund,
where it can be seen to this day.
Dark in hue, the majestic, 2,000 year
old head is still full of life; it astonishes
the beholder and rivets his attention.
Barely two years after the discovery
of the Tollund man, in April 1952,
another body was discovered in a
Jutland fen. This time it was in the
Nebelgard Fen at Grauballe, about
eleven miles east of Tollund. When

The head shown here is
2,000 years, and the
hand 1,500 years old. They
belong -to two of the many
well preserved bodies of men
and women discovered
in the peat-bogs of Denmark.
The age of these two bodies has
been confirmed by carbon 14
tests. Tollund Man (left)
has the best preserved head of
any Iron-Age man yet unearthed
from the bogs. The skin
patterns on Grauballe Man's
hand (right) are so clear that
perfect fingerprints some of the
oldest fingerprint patterns in
the worldwere obtained
from them.

I was called to the scene, the man's
head and shoulders were sticking up
out of the dark brown peat. I immedi¬
ately arranged for the body to be
transported to the Museum of Pre¬
history at Aarhus, still in the block of
peat in which it lay.
The Grauballe man had been placed
in his peat grave completely naked
and no objects of any kind were found
in the vicinity. Carbon 14 dating of
the liver and muscle tissue and dating
by pollen analysis placed the date of
death between 210 A.D. and 410 A.D.
X-Rays and examination of various
bone tissues and the teeth established
the Grauballe man's age at around
thirty years.
There could be no doubt about the
cause of death. A long cut ran round
the throat practically from ear to ear.
so deep that the gullet was complet¬
ely severed.
The Grauballe man was perfectly
preserved, though somewhat flattened
by the over-lying peat. His hair was
about six inches in length and short
stubble on his chin and upper lip
showed that he had been clean¬
shaven.
Radiography of the head showed
that the brain was remarkably well
preserved though a little shrunken.
The two halves of the brain and its
convolutions could be clearly seen in
the X-Rays.
His last meal was similar to that of
Tollund man consisting of a gruel of
grain and seed, but containing no
trace of summer or autumn berries or
other fruit or greenstuffs. There are
thus grounds for thinking that both
men met their deaths in winter or
early spring, before everything had
come into leaf. It may be deduced
that they were both sacrificed and
placed in the peat-bog as offerings at
the mid-winter celebrations or the fes¬
tivals of spring.
Examination of the beautifully pre¬
served feet and hands revealed such
clear line patterns that it was possible
to take prints of several of his fingers,
the oldest known fingerprints of any
human being.
When investigation of the Grauballe
man was completed, and before he
was given conservation treatment, a
plaster cast was made of him lying in
exactly the position in which he was
found in the peat-bog.
During the 1,500 years he had lain
in the peat-bog a tanning process had

Top left, this is the famous silver
cauldron recovered in 1891 from
a peat-bog at Gundestrup,
Denmark. The cauldron had been
placed there as a sacrificial
offering. It is splendidly decorated
inside and out with male and
female divinities, religious
processions and sacrificial scenes.
Where this 2,000-year-old
masterpiece of the metalworker's
art originated is not known, but
it may have come to Scandinavia
as booty of war. The "Bog
People" of N.W. Europe, as they
are now called, worshipped
Nerthus, the Earth Mother and
goddess of fertility, to whom they
prayed for good harvests. Detail

been taking place which had pre¬
served him up to our day. This
process begun by nature was success¬
fully completed in a laboratory by the
"pit-tanning" technique, using oak
bark, to which the body was subjected
for just over a year and a half. Since
then the Grauballe man has been
exhibited in the Museum of Prehistory
at Aarhus, where he lies just as he
was found in the peat-bog.
The peat-bogs of north-west Europe
have yielded up nearly 700 bodies of
men, women and children preserved
by nature for twenty centuries. Most
of the bodies of these people, who
lived during the early centuries of the
Christian era, were found in Denmark,
and more than half of them in the
Jutland peninsula and the adjoining
regions of north-west Germany.
Other bog people have been found
in England, Wales, Scotland and Ire¬
land and, in smaller numbers, in Nor¬
way, Sweden and central Europe.
It is the acid in these peat-bogs, as
well as the low oxygen content of bog
water, which has tanned the skin and
hair of the bodies and preserved them
as though they had only recently been
placed there.
But only very few of these bog
people are still in a good state of
preservation. Most of the bodies
crumbled away as soon as they were
exposed to the oxygen in the air,
since no one seemed to know how to
preserve them. A few have been
saved by a careful drying process, in
particular the body of a woman found
at Haraldskjaer in Denmark, in 1837.
The experts of the day thought that
this might have been the body of the
Norwegian Queen" Gunhild who was
murdered by being drowned in a peat¬
bog 900 years earlier.
But the body was later identified as
that of an Iron Age woman dating
back a further thousand years. Her
body is still preserved and lies in the
crypt of the church of St. Nicholas at
Vejle, in Jutland, in an oak coffin
personally presented by King Frede¬
rick VI.
Another early discovery, dating back
to 1780, is that of a woman of rank
unearthed from a peat-bog near Drum-
keragh Mountain in Ireland. She was
dressed in a finely-woven red and
green garment and a stole embroider¬
ed with figures, and she lay on three
woollen blankets.
Other well-preserved bodies of bog
people found in Denmark include
those of a man and a woman, un-

covered in Borre Fen at Himmerland,
in the north of Jutland, near the site
of an early Iron Age village in which
they had probably lived.
The man had been placed in the
peat-bog in a sitting position. The
back of his head was crushed in and
round his neck was à hemp rope
fastened with a slip-knot. Both ends
of the rope were skilfully bound and
stitched with hide thongs to prevent
them from unravelling. He had prob¬
ably been hanged or strangled with
this rope.
The dead man had been brought to
the peat-bog naked except for the
rope around his neck. Rolled up at
his feet, however, were two capes,
sewn together from pieces of light and
dark sheepskin.
The woman lay face downwards on
a sheet of birch bark. The upper part
of her body was uncovered while the
remainder was covered by a woollen
blanket.
28
^^N an island in the same
Fen, an iron Age village consisting of
some twenty houses has been exca¬
vated. Like most Jutland peasant
houses of two thousand years ago
those of the village of Borre Fen were
dwellings for both men and animals.
The houses varied in size and were
clustered round the village street.
The biggest house is eighty-eight feet
long by twenty-three feet wide and the
smallest is half this length and some¬
what narrower. The walls were made
of turf and the roofs of straw or
heather thatch. The Inhabitants lived
in one half of the house round a
central hearth while the animals
occupied the other half.
Other bog people have been dis¬
covered in Schleswig Holstein close
to Jutland's southern border; they are
now exhibited in the local museum of
Gottorp castle in Schleswig. Among
them are an elderly man and a young
girl found in a peat-bog at Windeby
farm in 1952.
Also to be seen at Gottorp castle
is the head of a man wearing a
curious hair style, described by the
Roman historian Tacitus in his treatise
on the German tribes, written at the
time of the bog people, in the first
century A.D. The reddish hair, origin¬
ally blond, was eleven inches long.
It was gathered at the right side into
a skilfully contrived knot which,
Tacitus tells us, was a style typical of
the Swabian tribe. Similar knots are
to be seen in Roman sculptures
depicting the Germanic tribes.
Writing on human sacrifice among
the Germani, Tacitus states that this
was connected both with the punish¬
ment of crime and the ritual of spring
worship of the gods. Concerning
Germanic law, he writes that accusa
tions and demands for the death
penalty could be brought before the
tribal assembly. Traitors and desert¬
ers were hung from a tree and
cowards and evil-doers were plunged
into the mud of the marshes.
Each year a dramatic ritual of wor¬
ship was enacted to awaken the
forces of nature and to ensure the
germination of corn and the fertility
of man and domestic animals.
Tacitus tells us that on an island in
the ocean there was a holy grove
where no man could set foot. In the
grove was hidden a chariot in which
none but a priest could ride in
company with the goddess.
In this chariot, drawn by oxen,
they drove through the countryside
awakening life and fertility in all things.
The goddess then retired to her divine
abode. The chariot and the goddess
were washed in a secret lake by
slaves and ministrants who were then
drowned in the lake.
The many people found in the peat¬
bogs may, therefore, have been placed
there as punishment for crime or as
sacrifices to the great goddess, whom
Tacitus calls Nerthus, or Mother Earth.
During the centuries preceding and
following the birth of Christ, such a
goddess was worshipped in northern
lands. She is depicted in several
small bronzes wearing only two rings
around her neck and sometimes in
her ears and with her hands under
her life-giving breasts.
The Mother goddess had already
been worshipped in neolithic times.
Her eyes look out at us from the clay
pots of this period and her symbol is
to be seen on slate pendants worn
as amulets.
During the period of the bog people,
in the late iron age, this goddess
reigned supreme over all other gods
and she is represented in highly
stylized form on bronze jewel-pins.
Many bracelets and necklaces have
been discovered in the peat-bogs
where they were placed as offerings.
A magnificent silver cauldron was
found in a peat-bog near Gundestrup
in Jutland. It is decorated with em¬
bossed figures representing, on the
outside, gods and goddesses with
their attendants and, on the inside,
scenes showing the goddess sur¬
rounded by legendary beasts and
human sacrifices.
The Gundestrup cauldron was made
in south-east Europe where it was
captured as war booty, brought back
to Denmark and placed as an offering
in a peat-bog near Borre Fen. But
several of the deities worshipped by
the bog people of Denmark are
represented on the cauldron.
The Tollund man and many of the
other bog men, after their brief time
as the companion and lover of the
goddess, may have been sacrificed
and placed in the peat-bogs in which
they have been so remarkably pre¬
served.
This massive statue the "fat woman",
as it has become known was
discovered In the central temple at
Tarxien, Malta. It dates from
Maltas's neolithic period
(around 1600 B.C.). As with many
other ancient sculptures unearthed on
the island, the head and upper part
of the body, perhaps fashioned from
some material other than stone, are
missing. When intact, the statue was
about two metres high and is thought to
portray the Mother Goddess seated.
The pleated skirt ¡s a feature that reflects
the refinement in art that marked the
Tarxien period, zenith of Malta's
prehistoric civilization.

1 HE Maltese archipelago,
consisting of the islands of Malta (the
largest island of the group), Gozo,
Comino, Commotio and Fllfola, lies
60 miles off the southern tip of Sicily
in the central Mediterranean.
Strategically placed between Europe
and Africa, Malta has a long history.
In ancient times the archipelago was
occupied successively by the Phoeni¬
cians, the Greeks, the Carthaginians
and the Romans. But Malta's mega-
lithic monuments, not isolated as else¬
where in Europe, but grouped together,
bear witness to a flourishing Maltese
civilization in prehistoric times preced¬
ing, according to some archaeologists,
the Aegean, Cretan and Mycenaean
civilizations.
One thing is certain, the men who
built the great megalithic temples
with enormous blocks of stone must
have used well advanced techniques
for lifting and transporting slabs that
weighed many tons.
Where did trie earliest people of
Malta come from? To which ethnic
group did they belong? When did
they first tread the soil of Malta?
These are questions which to this day
remain unanswered, although it Is
thought that the first peoples must
have settled in the island some
6,000 years ago.

VENUS FIGURES (Continued)
The legend of the Tower of the Giants
The pottery objects found at Ghar
Dalam (or Dalam cave), long thought
to be the most ancient in Malta, are
very similar to those of the same
period discovered at Stentinello, near
Syracuse, which suggests that the
first inhabitants of Malta came from
Sicily, the largest of the neighbouring
islands. But the decorative motifs of
the Ghar Dalam pottery are also found
on pottery from further east, in Dal-
matia, in Cilicia and other countries
bordering on the eastern coast of the
Mediterranean.
Some historians believe that the
Maltese of the neolithic era came from
Libya. The bay in which the Dalam
cave lies, known as Marsaxlokk, is
situated in the south-eastern part of
the island. Marsaxlokk and Valetta,
which is situated on the north coast,
are the island's best natural ports,
and if it is accepted that the first men
to come to Malta landed in the bay of
Marsaxlokk, then it seems more likely
that they crossed the sea from Libya
and not from Sicily.
The Ghar Dalam period, placed by
archaeologists between 2500 and
2100 B.C., was followed by the Mgarr
period, which takes its name from a
small site in the north-west of the
island where the ruins of a temple,
known as the Ta'Hagrat temple, were
discovered.

FEMININE BEAUTY 20,000 YEARS AGO. Numerous statuettes of corpulent women
have been found at Palaeolithic sites in Europe, in places as far apart as western
France and the Don Valley in the U.S.S.R. These "Venus figurines", as they are
known, were made about 18,000 B.C. Drawings above show eight of the Palaeolithic
Venus figurines, modelled according to a common pattern. The bulk of the
trunk breasts, belly and pelvis fits within the circumference of a circle and the
sharply tapered legs and narrow shoulders lie close to the limits of isosceles
triangles. Drawn in outline by the French prehistorian André Leroi-Gourhan, the
figurines (left to right and top to bottom) are from: Lespugue (France) ; Kostenki
(U.S.S.R.) ; Dolni-Vestonice (Czechoslovakia) ; Laussel (France) ; Willendorf (Aus¬
tria) ; two centre figures, Gagarino (U.S.S.R.) and Balzi Rossi (Italy). Stone-Age
sculptors in Malta, 16,000 years later, gave the same ample forms to their statues
f women, as did the artists of the Iron Age, two thousand years ago, to amulets
presenting the fertility goddess, discovered in Danish peat-bogs (see page 27).
Small in size, this temple was both
a shrine and a burial place. The dry
stone-building technique appears to
be already fairly advanced, but the
construction of the roof must have
posed considerable problems. It is
thought that this was also constructed
of carved stone, in large thin slabs,
but it is not known how these were
assembled.
Zebbug, another site in the western
part of the island, has given its name
to the next period. In 1947, archaeo¬
logists discovered several tombs and
a considerable quantity of pottery
there. Among, the decorative motifs
were representations of a small human
head.
The various artefacts found in the
temples and tombs of the Mgarr and
Zebbug periods provide valuable
evidence of the evolution of ways and
customs over the centuries that
separate these two periods. In
addition to pottery, the principal
finds at Ghar Dalam and Mgarr
were tools fashioned from bone
and flint. The tombs at Zebbug, how¬
ever, contained ornaments, the most
numerous of all being necklaces made
from shells. However, the chrono¬
logical order of the Mgarr and Zebbug
periods has not been definitely
established, and some experts place
Zebbug before Mgarr on the basis of
carbon 14 dating.
From Zebbug, one crosses the
narrows separating Malta from the
island of Gozo to reach Xaghra and
the Ggantija temples (the "Tower of
the Giants" as they have come to be
known) which have given their name
to the next period.
Situated on a hillside with a pano¬
ramic view stretching out to the
northern coast of the tiny island, the
remarkable temples of Ggantija rightly
deserve their fame. The southern
temple, the largest of the two temple
buildings, was built to a plan which
bears certain resemblances to those
of churches of the Christian era.
On each side of the 108ft long
central corridor, which might be
described as the "nave", are two small
rooms. At the end of the central
corridor is the apse which is marked
off by a low partition wall about two
feet in height. Part of the left hand
side of the central corridor was prob¬
ably used as a sacrificial altar.
The Phoenician inscriptions found
here give no indication as to when
these bold sailors from Asia Minor
came to the island of Gozo. It is
thought that they used Malta and
Gozo as staging ports and worshipped
in the temples.
The northern temple is in the form

### 51963: Headless 'Venus figures' of Stone-Age Malta
This headless limestone statue, 48 cm. high, was discovered in
the ruins of Hagar Qim, a temple complex first excavated in 1839,
in the south-west of Malta. The holes at the top are sockets where

the head was fitted. Though no sexual characteristics are
indicated, the shape of the body, recalling those of Palaeolithic
Venus figurines (see opposite page) suggests a female divinity.

of a square with sides measuring
82 feet. The rooms into which it is
divided feature several niches which
are differently placed from those of
the southern temple. Careful examin¬
ation of the interior walls suggests
that they were covered with bright red
paint. In view of the size of these
rooms, it is unlikely that they had
stone roofs and the builders probably
made them of wood, though the
possibility that they were left without
roofs cannot be entirely ruled out.
It is surprising that the Ggantija
temples, gigantic for their time, were
built on this particular site. In this
part of the island there is no trace of
the limestone rock of which they are
built. It must have been brought from
Ta'Cenc, on the south coast of the
island some considerable distance
from Xaghra.
Transporting this material from
Ta'Cenc to Xaghra represented a
remarkable feat at that time. It must
certainly have made an impression on
popular imagination since a legend
relates that a giantess carried the
stones on her head, at the same time
holding a baby in her arms and feeding
it along the way.
Tarxien, on the island of Malta, is
the most famous archaeological site
in the archipelago. It was during the
Tarxien prehistoric period that the
ancient Maltese civilization reached
its apogee. To their technical mastery
the builders added artistic taste and
feeling. Not only were the stone
blocks carefully hewn and dressed;
they were also decorated with designs
in relief. Most of these decorations
are carved in spiral patterns and other
geometrical figures, though some
motifs represent animals.
The Tarxien group consists of three
interlinked temples. Their existence
32
Temple complexes discovered in
Malta-, and in particular that of
Tarxien, show that a well-established
religion existed in the Island
3,500 years ago. Excavations
at Tarxien between 1915 and 1919,
laid bare major structures raised
by neolithic builders. Photo right,
of part of the Middle temple at
Tarxien, shows the passage leading
to the inner rooms. Access, however,
is blocked by a small slab gracefully
carved with two spirals, a decorative
motif also found on ancient
monuments In Crete. Many stones
in the Tarxien temples are blackened
with smoke suggesting that the dead
were cremated there in ancient times.
The huge stone slabs used
to build these and other
Maltese temples have
inspired a legend that a giantess
transported the stones on her head,
while feeding the baby she
carried In her arms.
was unknown to archaeologists until
1915 and they were eventually discov¬
ered by accident. The fact that they
remained buried for centuries explains
their perfect state of preservation.
One discovery that immediately
attracts attention is the statue of an
enormously fat woman placed in the
middle of the central temple. The
statue is impressive, even though the
upper part of the body is missing, and
is probably a colossal representation
of the goddess of fertility.
The majority of the stones of the
Tarxien temples are blackened with
smoke, which suggests that the
Bronze Age inhabitants of the island
cremated their dead there. The ashes
of innumerable funeral pyres erected
in the temples throughout the Bronze
Age and the broken remains of
burnt urns recovered there, have
been submitted to scientific, carbon
14 testing. The results of these tests
have enabled a precise chronological
table of the various stages of this
period in the prehistory of Malta to be
established.
The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum (or Paw-
la Hypogeum), an ancient catacomb
discovered not far from the Tarxien
temples, also ranks among the most
important archaeological remains of
Malta. Like the Tarxien temples, the
catacomb was discovered by chance
during the construction of two blocks
of houses in 1902. Entirely carved
from the rock, which here forms a
limestone plateau, the Hypogeum is
several centuries older than the
Tarxien temples.
The Hypogeum is an architectural
complex of halls, passages, chambers,
stairways and high-walled galleries,
into which are carved niches of vary¬
ing shapes and sizes, spread out on
three levels.
The largest and most carefully
constructed room, the inner sanctum
or "Holy of Holies," is situated in the
upper part of the catacombs, and it
is here, in all probability, that animal
sacrifices were made. Access to the
third storey is difficult and the stair¬
way leading to it ends with an impass¬
able step some six feet high.
The purpose of the room below this
stairway is still a matter of conjecture.
Some specialists believe that it was a
treasury and that it was to protect its
contents from robbers that access
was made so difficult. Others maintain
that it was merely a water tank.
During the Bronze Age the period
of invasions began and Maltese
civilization gradually lost its original¬
ity. The isolation that Malta, as an
island, had experienced up to the
Stone Age was disturbed by the
arrival of sailors from the eastern
Mediterranean, from Greece, from
neighbouring islands such as Sicily
and Lipari, and even from the Gulf of
Lions. Improvement in boat-building
techniques and in navigation brought
Malta within reach of the bold sea¬
farers who had set out to seek their
fortunes in distant lands.
The newcomers brought with them
new customs and beliefs which they
imposed upon the peoples of the
islands who, small in number, were
unable to defend themselves. The
objects discovered in the tombs of
succeeding periods are so different
that they cannot be explained in terms
of the evolution in customs of a single
people. Such radical transformations
can be due solely to the cultural
contributions of invading peoples.
No doubt this tiny country with such
a turbulent history conceals beneath
its soil other precious traces of the
past.

### 51964: Six hundred million new literates in twenty years
Six hundred million
new literates
in twenty years
A crucial point has been reached in the mass­
ive world effort to wipe out illiteracy, according to the
latest information received by Unesco.
Some of the updated statistics covering the last two
decades look like light at the end of the tunnel. They
show that:
'. round the world, the number of people who can read
and write has risen by 600 million since 1950, the rate of
increase keeping ahead of the rate of population growth;
:. in the regions with the greatest illiteracy-Africa
and the Arab States, Asia and Latin America-illiteracy
rates have dropped over the past ten years;i. the tide is turning in Latin America, where the percent­
age of illiterates has been cut by more than a quarter to
23.6 per cent and where, for the first time and ag'ainst the
world trend, the absolute number of illiterates has been
reduced;
,. despite the rise in population, the number of illiterates
rose marginally less than had been predicted.
But world figures, also serve several warnings. The
estimates reveal:
:. a staggering total number of illiterates in the world­
even counting the reduction on the predicted rise:
783 million instead of 810 million;
• in Africa and the Arab States the drop in illiteracy
rates still leaves 73.7 per cent of the adult population
unable to read and write;I. even on the most optimistic projections, the number
of illiterates in 30 years is not likely to be less than
650 million or about 15 per cent, so the problem of illiter­
acy may not be solved this century.
Replies to a questionnaire sent to Unesco Member
States make the perspective clearer and tend to confirm
hopes that at last the right approach to the problem has
been taken on a world scale. According to the Unesco
statistics, the proportion of illiterates in the world-not
far short of 50 per cent in 1950 and still 40 per cent in
196D-is now down to 34.3 per cent.
The 73.7 per cent illiteracy rate in Africa and the Arab
States and the 46.8 per cent rate in Asia still represent a
gigantic task, but in ten years Latin America has cut its
rate from 32.5 per cent to 23.6 per cent, demonstrating
what can happen when the two-pronged attack through
primary education and adult literacy instruction begins to
break through.
For in 1957, Latin American countries launched a contin­
ental "major project" to extend primary education and, in
ten years, increased enrolments by 35 million children.
Adult literacy programmes on the continent, such as
Colombia's famous "Radio Schools of Sutatenza· have
also been in operation for some years and are gaining
impetus.
In Asia and Africa, however, relatively newly independent
countries have only begun to tackle the problem of provid­
ing primary education, let alone adult literacy teaching.
Replies to Unesco's questionnaire show that literacy and
adult education are now widely regarded as integral parts
of social and economic development. Roughly half the
countries with a literacy problem take this view, and have
included literacy in their national development plans.
Allied to this is an Increasing acceptance of the "functional
literacy" approach promoted by Unesco: literacy teaching
that gears reading, writing and arithmetic to daily life and
work, with literacy and job training combined as part of
industrial and agricultural development projects.
After a long count-down, Unesco-assisted projects under
the Experimental World Literacy Programme are just
beginning to have a measurable effect, the most advanced
projects now having reached the expansion stage: in India,
64,800 adults are being taught, in Iran, 55,000; in Mali,
40,000; in Tanzania, 20,000.
Enrolment in these 13 projects has risen from 25,000 in
September 1969, when the first became operational, to
more than 235,000 today. The rate of increase in enrol­
ments will speed up this year and if countries decide to
create future programmes they will have a solid base of
literate workers to build on.
The "if" is a big one. Future action to combat illiteracy
will depend on the priority given and the funds available:
in neither case is present evidence cause for optimism.
For example, returns from 44 countries giving figures
which are internationally comparable reveal only four (only
one a developing country) spending more than three per
cent of their education budget on adult education, including
literacy. Three-quarters of the countries were allocating
less than one per cent to adult education and since literacy
forms only part of this, the priority-or lack of it-is clear.
IN fact, developing countries have rapidly in­
creased their total spending on education in the past
decade. But though the percentage of the total education
budget of developing countries nearly equals that being
spent by industrialized lands (in Africa, the 1965 average of
16.4 per cent is even higher), the absolute amount is
incomparably less for popuJations which are frequently
incomparably greater.
While their Gross National Product only inches forward,
there is small prospect of much more money being found
by the developing countries themselves. Dr. V.K.R.V. Rao,
when he was India's Education Minister, advocated a
national emergency programme to reduce the 150 million
illiterates in the 15-25 age group to 50 million by 1981.
Even at a cost of only $4 a head, this would require
$400 million. India's Fourth Plan, however, provided for
only $1.3 million.
The dilemma is whether resources should be con­
centrated on providing primary education or whether the
problem should be tackled through adult literacy instruction.
Belief is growing that the best solution is an attack on
both fronts; reports of drop-out rates (as high as 81 per
cent in Africa) indicate that merely providing schooling is 33
not the whole answer. Until the problem of resources is
solved at an international level, however, part solutions
are likely to set the pace for progress. •

ANCIENT IRRIGATION AND MODERN SCIENCE
(Continued from page 16)

work of this expedition, making it pos¬
sible to link scientific studies, particu¬
larly cartography, with the tasks of
modern economic development. Excav¬
ations of the ancient farming villages
and the towns of Khorezm, systema¬
tic exploration of the whole area and
the use of detailed maps drawn up
from aerial photographs, have produc¬
ed an overall picture of the agricultu¬
ral history of the oasis at the lower
reaches of the Amu Darya.
A legend relates that in ancient
times the Amu Darya did not flow into
the Aral Sea, but into the Caspian.
According to the legend, the king of
Khorezm won from the king of the
"East" the right to divert the river
towards Khorezm only "for one day and
one night". However, the disobedient
river, once turned, continued to flow
towards Khorezm. The people there
"ran canals from it and built towns
along its banks". Archaeologists have
now determined how and when agricul¬
ture actually began in Khorezm.
/AGRICULTURE and canal
building in the lower reaches of the
Amu Darya began in the middle of the
2nd millenium B.C. In ancient times,
the Amu Darya had a huge triple delta,
consisting of hundreds of channels.
Natural silt deposits gradually filled
the upper channels and they ultimately
disappeared.
The ancient irrigator, who learned
his methods from nature, observed
this process and made use of it. The
hydrographie changes he saw taking
place gave him the idea of controlling
small natural river channels and using
them, with the help of ditches, to pro¬
vide a more or less regular water
supply for his fields.
At first, agriculture depended solely
on natural flood irrigation; later it made
use of the gradually disappearing delta
channels, which were adapted for irri¬
gation by means of short aryks, or irri¬
gation ditches, leading from them.
According to the American archaeo¬
logist, Robert McCormick Adams, irrig¬
ation in ancient Mesopotamia, where
natural conditions were similar to those
of the Khorezm oasis, evolved in the
same way.
Nature herself pointed the way to
technological progress for the an¬
cient irrigation engineers. As early as
the Bronze Age, men discovered the
principle of gravity flow and built head
structures far upstream of the delta
channels to ensure a steady flow of
water to their fields. Yet irrigation in
this early epoch still depended solely
on the whims of the river.
In the 6th-5th centuries B.C., during
the Persian Achaemenid dynasty when
Khorezm became a large slave-owning
state, irrigation engineering underwent
a sharp change. The huge irrigation
systems of this period in no way re¬
sembled the small river beds adapted
for irrigation in the primitive epoch.
The building of such irrigation sys¬
tems required vast manpower resour¬
ces as well as strict state organization
and control. The process was accom¬
panied by radical changes in the struc¬
ture of society, the formation of
classes and the consolidation of
state power.
Numerous fortified settlements were
established in the oasis, and the area
under irrigation was increased many
times over. Here grain crops barley,
wheat and millet and cotton were
raised. Viticulture, horticulture and
melon cultivation were developed.
Local growers became skilled in selec¬
tion methods and raised the best
melons in the world and special var¬
ieties of grapes. Remarkably enough,
in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya
the ancient traditional dimensions of
the vineyards (width of beds, 3.2 to 3.6
metres) and the melon fields (up to
2.2. metres) have been preserved to
this day.
The growth of irrigation farming in
the ancient Khorezm oasis was inter¬
rupted in the middle of the Ist millen¬
nium, a time of widespread social
upheaval and a decline in agriculture.
But the ancient lands with irrigation
systems were developed once again in
the 7th-8th centuries during the so-
called Afrigidian period. The huge
90 kilometre-long Kyrk-Kyz canal on
the right bank of the Amu Darya was
put into operation, and numerous for¬
tifications sprang up along its length.
In the year 712, however, the oasis
was invaded by an army led by Kut-
eiba, who ordered all the ancient Zoro-
astrian books burned and the magi
the custodians of knowledge about
irrigation put to death. Afterwards,
in the words of al-Biruni, the 11th cen¬
tury Khorezm scholar and scientist,
"the people of Khorezm remained illi¬
terate and depended on memory for
what they needed."
The 11th to the early 13th centuries
saw a new upsurge of life in the oasis.
Khorezm was transformed from a poor
northern principality into the centre of
a great Eastern empire. The domain of
the Khorezm shahs extended from the
Aral Sea to the Indus River, from Iraq
to Ferghana.
The huge expanse of abandoned
land was again developed, and on the
left bank of the Amu Darya even ad¬
vanced for dozens of kilometres into
the heart of the desert. This area,
studied by an expedition working along
the Chermen-Yab canal, has retained
all the engineering features of medie¬
val irrigation. This differed from the
ancient systems in its more economical
use of the land within the basin, lar¬
ger side branches, and the introduc¬
tion of complex branch layouts
and water-hoisting wheels. All this
was connected with the efforts of
farmers to reduce silting up in the
canals, and thus lessen the work of
cleaning them.
While the overall territory occupied
by irrigation installations was reduced,
the area irrigated actually grew, since
new lands were irrigated within the
existing basins.
Basically, this phenomenon, seem¬
ingly paradoxical at first glance,
reflects the general trend of progress
in irrigation that can be traced from
ancient times right up to our day. The
coefficient of land use has grown from
5-10 per cent in ancient times, to 30-40
per cent in the Middle Ages, and to
50-70 per cent in modern irrigation
engineering systems.
HE flowering of the
Khorezm oasis was cut short in 1220
by the Mongolian invasion. Genghis
Khan's advance detachments appeared
at a time when the rulers of Khorezm
were still at the zenith of their glory.
The Mongolian invasion was disas¬
trous for the farming oases of Central
Asia. At the lower reaches of the
Amu Darya not only was right-bank
Khorezm depopulated, but so were
the vast lands on the left bank, where
the once densely populated oasis
(30,000 inhabitants) along the Cher¬
men-Yab canal was turned forever into
desert.
The dam at Urgench was destroyed
and the dykes fell into disrepair. The
river waters, whose level was higher
than that of the oasis land, destroyed
the dykes and flooded the fields and
villages for a time.
In the 13th and 14th centuries, a

large part of Khorezm was incorporat¬
ed into the Golden Horde. During this
period, cities and villages were reviv¬
ed and the area of land under irriga¬
tion grew.
But the destruction that accompan¬
ied Timur's invasion in 1379 caused the
waters of the Amu Darya to break
through to the west again, through the
Daryalyk river bed to the Sarykamish
depression, filling it to a level that
allowed it to drain along the dry Uzboi
river bed into the Caspian. Urgench
perished and, as archaeological find¬
ings have shown, only one area of
habitation survived, in difficult condi¬
tions, up to the 17th century.
Stormy political events, strife and
wars between feudal lords, and popu¬
lation migrations all militated against
settled irrigation farming. The out¬
skirts of the oasis, where there was a
frequent population turnover, suffered
the most.
Such scant but revealing facts from
the history of irrigation in the lower
Amu Darya region illustrate the close
connexion between political and social
events and the fate, for better or
worse, of the irrigated lands.
Today, the traces of ancient irrigation
that stand as memorials to the labour
of many generations of farmers are
helping the peoples of Central Asia to
tame the desert. In the Kara-Kalpak
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic,
for instance, water flows once again in
the newly reconstructed Afrigidian
Kyrk-Kyz canal, which had been aban¬
doned back in the 8th century.
N 1952 the Khorezm ex¬
pedition began to systematically map
the ancient irrigation systems. The
maps have since been profitably used
in planning the contours of new
irrigation tracts on the left bank of the
Amu Darya.
As long ago as 1962, it was propos¬
ed to revive the vast formerly irrigated
lands at the lower reaches of the Syr
Darya and Amu Darya, by creating a
huge rice-growing region covering up
to two million hectares to the east
of the Aral Sea. It is now planned to
divert the waters of Siberian rivers
towards Central Asia. Here again, ar¬
chaeologists have begun to draw up
maps of the ancient irrigation areas.
Irrigation specialists and archaeolo¬
gists of the Uzbek SSR are doing
similar work in Bukhara where the
second section of the Amu-Bukhara
canal is under construction. Over
50,000 hectares of land will be devel¬
oped for cotton growing here in the
near future.

Malayan farmers carry shrubs

Knowledge of the history of the irri¬
gated lands and in particular detailed
drawings of the ancient water supply
systems, based on aerial photographs,
will be dependable guides for this
development project.
Thus, the experience of bygone peo¬
ples is being put at the service of
modern economic development. And, as
never before, science is co-ordinating
the search for solutions to complex
theoretical problems with the urgent
tasks of economic progress. The
study of farming methods used by
those who lived in lands where irriga¬
tion was used is a concrete example of
this co-ordination.
Ten years from now, the traveller to
these lands will be greeted by verdant
gardens and orchards, hillsides white
with cotton and new villages spread
out over what was only recently a
wasteland. <

UNITED NATIONS 1
This U.N. stamp, issued recently to
commemorate the United Nations School
in New York and Geneva, reproduces a
painting done In 1938 by Pablo Picasso
of his daughter Mala, then a child. It is
the second Picasso work ever to be
printed on a stamp (the first was his
famous work "Guernica", painted in 1937).
The stamp commemorating the U.N. school
has appeared in three denominations:
8 and 21 cents and Sw. Fr 1.10. As agent
in France of the U.N. Postal Administration,
Unesco's Philatelic Service (place de Fon¬
tenoy, Parls-76) stocks all U.N. stamps and
first day covers currently on sale.
Iran's ethnological
museum
Iran has set up its first ethnological
museum, designed to show the diversity
of Iranian ethnic groups and traditions, in
the Gulestan Palace, in Teheran. A Unesco
specialist, Mrs Teresa BattestI, helped to
collect, organize and catalogue Its exhibits.
Man and the Biosphere
A new Unesco programme is to mobi¬
lize International scientific co-operation to
find out exactly what we are doing to
nature and what nature Is doing to us. The
International Co-ordinating Council of this
"Man and the Biosphere" programme
recently defined its general objectives: to
develop a basis within the natural and
social sciences for the rational use and
conservation of the resources of the
biosphere and for the improvement of
man's relationship with the environment;
to predict the consequences of today's
actions on tomorrow's world, so that man
can use his global resources more effi¬
ciently. The research involved will range
from Arctic tundra to tropical forests.
Thirty-six national "Man and the Biosphere"
committees have been asked to prepare
programmes of environmental education
and training.
Vacation Study Abroad
Unesco has just published the 20th edi¬
tion of "Vacation Study Abroad" (55p,
$1.50), an Indispensable guide to opportu¬
nities for study and travel abroad. The
present edition gives full facts on short
courses, seminars, summer schools, scho¬
larships and travel grants In 60 countries,
available to students, teachers and others
planning to study or train abroad during
their vacation.
More aid needed for
Palestine refugee schools
An urgent plea for further International
aid to finance education for Palestine refu¬
gees was made at the United Nations
recently by Mr. Alfonso de Silva, Director
of Unesco's Office for Liaison with the
U.N., In New York. Costs of the pro¬
gramme had risen because of the growth
of the school-age refugee population.
Despite International aid totalling $1 million
in cash and $700,000 In kind, following
an appeal in 1971, cuts In the refugee
education might become Inevitable If new
resources were not soon made available.
New strategies
for education
The International Commission for the
Development of Education, set up by
Unesco last year, plans to send fact-finding
missions to the People's Republic of China
and the German Democratic Republic.
Members of the Commission have already
visited 18 countries to assess national
experiences In educational development.
The Commission will present its findings
and Its recommendations for new strategies
for the expansion and Improvement of
education around the world to Unesco's
Director-General later this year.
Astuter computer
By the turn of this century there Is an
even chance that computers will be the
intellectual equals of the average citizen,
predicts the computer specialist. Dr. Irving
John Good, In the latest issue of Unesco's
quarterly, "Impact of Science and Society"
(Vol. XXI, No 4. Price, $1.24, 40p). Current
computers, says Dr. Good, are logical
machines but not thinking machines. New
computer technology and new methods of
writing programmes will enable us to make
computers "creative", capable of "learning"
and much more capable of simulating human
mental processes.

Unesco's latest Statistical Yearbook
WORLD PROFILE IN FIGURES
Swedes are the world's most avid news¬
paper readers (more than one copy for
every two persons). The U.S.A. has more
TV sets than any other country (81 million).
The proportion of women enrolled in
higher education, where they have long
been outnumbered, is rising rapidly (38 per
cent today). World book production was
74 per cent greater in 1969 than in 1955.
These figures come from the latest edi¬
tion of Unesco's Statistical Yearbook, an
annual summary of significant facts and
figures in education, science, culture and
communication (1). The present edition
covers over 200 countries and territories.
Below, we present a few facets from this
statistical portrait of the world we live in.
EDUCATION
Enrolments in primary, secondary and
higher education rose from about 325 mil¬
lion in 1960 to about 460 million in 1968.
On top of this total came nearly 40 mil¬
lion children enrolled in rapidly expanding
pre-primary education.
While the largest part of the Increase
is still at primary level (about 80 million
more since 1960), the greatest proportionate
increases are at the higher levels: secon¬
dary enrolment rose significantly more than
primary enrolment everywhere except in
Asia. Enrolments in higher education show
a remarkable rise throughout the world,
with ten out of every hundred In the 20-24
age-group studying in 1968, compared with
only six in 1960. The European figures
doubled to more than 16 per cent by 1968,
and figures for North America show that
nearly half the total age group was receiv¬
ing higher education in that year.
BOOKS
World book production rose to a record
496,000 titles In 1969. Of this, European
production accounted for 225,000 titles,
North America produced 71,000, South
America 12,000 and Oceania 5,000. Asian
production was steady at 100,000 titles,
and so was Africa's but at only 8,000.
The U.S.S.R., which has published around
76,000 since 1960, produced 1,000 fewer
titles in 1969.
Distributed among the estimated world
population of 3,552 million, this production
means that the 13 per cent who live In
Europe get more than 45 per cent of the
books, but the 56 per cent who live in
Asia get only around 20 per cent. North
Americans, who represent less than 9 per
cent of the world's population get more
than 14 per cent of the books; Africans,
who make up nearly 10 per cent, get less
than 2 per cent South America produces
less than 3 per cent of the world's books
for more than 5 per cent of the population
and the U.S.S.R. more than 15 per cent
for less than 7 per cent
TELEVISION
In ten years, the number of television
sets In the world tripled to about 251 mil¬
lion by 1969. After the United Sutes,
(1) Unesco Statistical Yearbook, 1970,
786 pages. Bilingual. English-French. Paper:
£8.70, $29. 116 F. Cloth:£10.50, $35. 140 F.
with 81 million sets, came the U.S.S.R. with
nearly 31 million, the United Kingdom and
the Federal Republic of Germany, both
nudging 16 million sets, and France with
more than 10 million. But the number rose
Into the millions In several countries.
From 650,000 in 1960, Mexico Increased
Its receivers to 2,553,000 In 1969, Argen¬
tina reached 3,100,000, while Brazil in¬
creased its receivers more than five times
to 6,500,000. The whole of Africa still had
only around a million receivers in 1969,
but In that year Algeria had 100,000,
Morocco 145,000 and Egypt 550,000. With
nearly 22 million sets, Japan was well
ahead of the field in Asia; other countries
where the number considerably increased
were the Republic of Korea with 246,000
and Thailand with 241,000. The Republic
of Viet-Nam had 373,000.
CINEMA
Among the 47 countries covered by sta¬
tistics on film production, India shows a
regular increase (from 324 films In 1960
to 367 in 1969), and Japan a slight de¬
crease (from 549 to 494) as does France
(from 158 to 154). Most films made in
co-production came from Italy, 104 out of
a world total of 253.
RADIO
In ten years the number of radio sets
in the world has Increased 82 per cent:
653 million In 1969 as compared with
358 million in 1959. The number of radio
receivers per 1,000 Inhabitants is a fol¬
lows: North America, 1,339; U.S.S.R., 375;
Europe, 280; East Asia (excluding the Peo¬
ple's Republic of China) 192; Oceania,
190; Latin America, 167; Africa, 45; South
Asia, 33. The world had 19,110 radio
transmitters In 1969.
NEWSPAPERS
World figures show that about 300 more
dallies were published in 1969 than ten
years earlier. The distribution per thou¬
sand of the population shows some
changes In the pattern, with fewer in
North America, traditionally a top-of-the-
table area.
The U.S.S.R. has nearly doubled circula¬
tions to some 320 copies per thousand
in 1969; the Federal Republic of Germany
is ahead of this with 331, but U.S. circu¬
lations went down to 305 copies per thou¬
sand. '
In general, the encouraging Increases
are In the developing world. In Asia, for
instance, while Japan has a clear lead with
503 copies per thousand, only 25 behind
Sweden, and Hong Kong has 485, Ceylon
has a large proportionate Increase from
36 to 58 per thousand. Malaysia, with 74,
is on the upgrade. In South America,
Bolivia shows an increase from 27 per
thousand in 1960 to 34 in 1969. Distri¬
bution remains sparse in Africa, with Mau¬
ritius still heading the table at 78 despite
a falling tendency, and Ghana, with 34,
leads distribution rates on the African conti¬
nent. Four African countries still have
less than one copy for every thousand
people.

Letters to the Editor
UNESCO'S 25 YEARS
Sir,
I have just finished reading every word
of the August-September "Unesco Cou¬
rier" on Unesco's 25 years. It is the most
remarkable, exciting informative publi¬
cation I've seen. As an American, I wish
a copy could go to every school district
in the United States.
May I extend my commendation and
appreciation to you and all your staff
for this excellent presentation of Unesco.
M. Irwin
Teheran, Iran
INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY
Sir,
The Idea launched by the Secretary-
General of the United Nations for the
establishment of an international university
(see "Unesco Newsroom", May 1971)
opens up new prospects of peace and
progress for mankind. Such a United
Nations University could be the best means
of overcoming the sad realities of the
present day in which opportunity of access
to higher education Is often denied to
people with the necessary Intellectual abi¬
lity, on grounds of race, religious beliefs
or politiclal opinion. For these reasons
I feel that men of good will throughout the
entire world should give this project their
moral and material support to ensure that
it becomes a living reality.
Albert de los Toyos
Havana, Cuba
IRELAND
Sir,
The November 1971, issue of the "Unes¬
co Courier" contained an item on the
recent Unesco poster competition and I
was glad to note among the illustrations
a reproduction of the poster for which my
young fellow-countryman, Roland Mahon,
was awarded a second prize. I was, how¬
ever, surprised to find an error of nomen¬
clature in the caption. As you will be
aware, and as the official Titles of Member
States and Associate Members of Unesco
makes clear, the name of our country, in
English, is Ireland.
I trust you will not mind my bringing
this lapse to your attention and that you
will believe me when I say how highly I
regard the Courier's well-deserved repu¬
tation for accuracy and precision.

Permanent Delegate of Ireland
to Unesco, Paris
STILL LOOKING AHEAD
Sir,
At my advanced age, I was doubtful last
year about taking out a two-year subs¬
cription to the "Unesco Courier", but this
year I shall not hesitate. In fact, the
"Courier" gives me more and more the
desire and the will to say "No" to the
passage of time. The idea of a better
future and a happy and united mankind
is exalting and this is the future that I
see coming alive in your magazine. Having
lectured and written a great deal on the
subject of "A Council of World Con¬
science", I find in your pages the echo and
the mirror of the highest aspirations of
my life.
Raoul Villedleu

FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW
Sir,
I Imagine that you receive many letters
of praise for the "Unesco Courier", but
I would like to add my personal congra¬
tulations. I am fourteen years old and for
a long time I have been very interested
and, at times, troubled by the various
questions raised in your magazine.
Carthage, Iran, Futurology, reports on
the progress of the modern world are all
fascinating subjects which concern every¬
one. I would also like to see, if possi¬
ble, in a future issue of the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" an article on the various theories
about the possibility of any form of life
existing on other planets.
I take this opportunity to wish the
"Unesco Courier" a happy 25th birthday,
and I hope that when I am an old retired
grandfather I shall still be able to look
through this "Window Open on the World".

MUSEUM OF THE WORLD
Sir,
At the headquarters of our Office of
Educational Studies we have organized a
museum in which we assemble and pre¬
serve objects from all parts of the world
typical of local craftsmanship, specimens
of local flora and fauna, archaeological
and mineralogical specimens, etc. Our
main purpose is to stimulate In our
1,400 pupils an Interest In distant coun¬
tries.
An appeal for objects of this type has
been published in a number of Italian
magazines and we have already received
several interesting objects from various
countries. I should be most grateful if,
through the different language editions of
the "Unesco Courier", you would tell your
readers what we are doing and invite them
to help us to enrich our "museum".

MAN AND NATURE
IN EQUILIBRIUM
Sir,
I have just finished going through two
1971 issues of the "Unesco Courier":
"S.O.S. Environment (July)" and "25 Years
of Unesco Viewed by a Student of 25"
(August-September). I find them excep¬
tionally useful in improving my perspec¬
tive regarding my country's logical role in
the world task of reaching some balance
or equilibrium between the íesources
essential to life, all life, and man.
Man, by his essential craft, ambition
and competition, becomes wilfully destruc¬
tive. I am asking myself to what lengths
he would have gone these past 25 years
except for the leavening influences of the
United Nations, and particularly Unesco?
We are great at sharing lamentations;
we are born critics as is every other
creature. But young Wayne McEwing, In
the August-September issue, does stimu¬
late hope. He is a fact-finder now, an
auditor. I hope that one day he will find
himself a poet, because he has the uni¬
versal mind that art requires.

S.O.S. ENVIRONMENT
Sir,
Your issue of July 1971, "S.O.S. Envi¬
ronment", was of special Interest to me.
I was made particularly aware of this ques¬
tion by the 2nd World Food Congress
held at The Hague In 1970. Previously
I had only vague notions about this prob¬
lem of such importance for the future of
mankind. I now fully appreciate why
France and other countries have found it
necessary to appoint Ministers for the En¬
vironment. Unfortunately, in the devel¬
oping countries the full extent of the
problem does not yet appear to have
been recognized.
I feel that lessons on the environment
and pollution should not only be included
in school syllabuses, but should be com¬
pulsory.
Father Fernand Parrel

AWARENESS
Sir,
I am head of a social education depart¬
ment in an English secondary school which
caters mostly for "immigrant" pupils
about 50 per cent West Indian and 20 per
cent Indian. For the last two years we
have been trying to develop a programme
which reinforces our pupils' various "cultu¬
ral" or group awareness backgrounds and
yet Introduces them to realistic career
goals In an English society.
I found your issue on "Answers to
Racism" (November 1971) helpful in pre¬
paring lessons for the first of our objec¬
tives. The main purpose in developing
this material was to bring together African,
West Indian, Indian and English (European)
historical and cultural traditions by using
visual, literary and cultural hero material.
The article on Miklukho-Maklal In your
November issue emphasized his achieve¬
ment and not that of the Papuans, but
since we are presently doing work on
people from faraway places, I felt I could
use the material on Papua to go along
with some "same" and "difference" dis¬
cussions we had in class. Because I
have prepared lessons for third year pupils
and shown them to a number of people,
a network of teachers interested in doing
similar work is being built. I am interested
in using material from such publications
as the "Unesco Courier".
