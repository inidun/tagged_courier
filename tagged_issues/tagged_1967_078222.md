Adam and Eve spared by the flood
The only existing works of Masaccio, one of the great Florentine painters of
the early 15th century, are his frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel of the
Carmelite Church in Florence. These works were spared by the recent
flood that ravaged Florence. Masaccio died in 1428 at the age of 27. But the
masterpieces he produced in his short life mark him as the true creator of Renaissance
painting. Above, detail of Masaccio's "Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise".
From " Masaccio : Frescoes in Florence ". published by the New York Graphic Society, by
arrangement with Unesco, in the Unesco World Art Series (1956) ; 32 full colour plates.

The Uffizi in Florence is one of the
world's most celebrated museums.
Last November invading flood-
waters wrought havoc in its baseÂ¬

waters had subsided, some of these
works lie half submerged in mud. 3

FOR FLORENCE AND

on December 2, 1966
by
RENÃ‰ MAHEU
Director-General
of Unesco
at the opening
of the International
Campaign for
Florence and Venice
4
f uring the first days of NovÂ¬
ember, Tuscany and Venetia were
devastated by floods of extraordinary
magnitude and violence. The damage
has been enormous. To the toll in human
lives and the loss of property were addÂ¬
ed the destruction, in Florence and VeÂ¬
nice, of creations of the human spirit
which made the enchantment of the
culture and art of living that Italy has
given to the world.
In all, 885 works of art of the first
importance, eighteen churches and some
10,000 other objects have suffered. SevÂ¬
enty libraries and learned institutions
have been stricken. More than 700,000
volumes of archives comprising some
50 million items, of which 10,000 were
of inestimable historical and scientific
value, have been damaged.
Florence and Venice! The names
alone say why Italy's grief is ours. But
they indicate also why Italy's resolution
to preserve and restore everything that
can be saved will be the common purÂ¬
pose of us all. Venice sinking into the
waters, it is as if one of the most radiant
stars of beauty were suddenly engulfed;
Florence bemired, it is the springtime
of our hearts which is for ever disfigurÂ¬
ed. We will not resign ourselves to
such disasters.
The General Conference of Unesco,
which has just concluded its fourteenth
session, has decided unanimously to
issue an urgent appeal "to the spirit of
fellowship of Member States to assist,
to the fullest extent of their means, the
efforts of the Italian people and authoÂ¬
rities to preserve and restore cultural
property that has been or is in danger
of being damaged".
In so doing, Unesco in no way wishes
to take the place of the aid and co-opÂ¬
eration, public and private, which Italy's
innumerable friends throughout the world
have spontaneously offered and are
prepared to furnish directly. The broÂ¬
therhood of man that the international
agencies seek to promote and to
organize is nurtured by the living springs
of natural and historic friendships betÂ¬
ween persons and peoples.
But Unesco, called upon by its ConsÂ¬
titution to assure "the conservation and
protection of the world's inheritance of
books, works of art and monuments of
history and science" can, as the Italian
Government has requested, assemble
and distribute information regularly on
the needs, on the one hand, and offers
of aid on the other. In this way outÂ¬
side assistance may be best directed by
stages, in agreement with the Italian
authorities, to meet the needs and fit
the possibilities of the situation.
Most important, Unesco can stimulate
international solidarity and that indeed
should be its rÃ´le. Just six years ago,
from this very platform, my predecessor
launched a pressing appeal to the world
to save the monuments of Egyptian and
Sudanese Nubia which were threatened
to be flooded as a result of the construcÂ¬
tion of the Aswan High Dam. Fifty
countries responded to that appeal.
Today it can be said that the safeguardÂ¬
ing of the antiquities of Nubia is accomÂ¬
plished or assured, including the unique
monumental ensemble of Abu Simbel.
I am sure that once again mankind will
not fail to acknowledge and act to save
its common heritage, thereby acknowÂ¬
ledging again and reaffirming its proÂ¬
found spiritual unity.

N behalf of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
I address a solemn appeal to the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind
for the preservation and restoration of the damaged cultural treasures
of Florence and Venice.

### For Florence and Venice: appeal launched on December 2, 1966 by RenÃ© Maheu, Director-General of UNESCO, at the opening of the International Campaign for Florence and Venice
I call upon the 120 Member States of Unesco, and first of all
upon their governments, to give generous aid in the form of money,
equipment and services to carry out this immense task of preservation and
restoration which will require several years.
I call upon museums, libraries, archives and learned institutions
in all the countries to put their experts, their laboratories and their workshops
at the disposal of the corresponding Italian institutions whose
installations and collections have suffered. I call upon those international
organizations of specialists which are closely associated with Unesco's work
in this field the International Council of Museums, the International Council on
Monuments and Sites, and the International Federation of Library
Associations and the International Council on Archives to promote and
co-ordinate efforts in this respect.
I call upon the writers, artists, musicians, critics and historians, indeed all
those and they are legion whose works have been inspired by the
treasures of Florence or Venice, to donate a part of what they have
gained they know better than anyone else that they can never repay their true
debt, which is a spiritual one and to help us with their talents in
reaching the public.
I call upon museums, art galleries, theatres, and concert halls, foundations
and private collections, which glory in the works we owe to the genius
of Florence and Venice, to organize exhibitions, performances, and
other events, devoted to Florence and Venice, the proceeds of which would go
to the Funds that have been set up in many countries, and by Unesco
itself, to receive voluntary financial contributions.
I call on the millions and tens of millions of persons who have visited these
famous cities, even if only once, and who have returned enriched for the rest
of their lives, to send one dollar or whatever they can to Unesco.
Finally, I also call on all those who have never been to Florence
or Venice, and many of whom may never have that chance, to contribute
something: be it money or work something of themselves.
Each one of us knows himself to be a member of the family of Man.
How then could any one of us remain indifferent to the fate of these most
precious jewels of our common human heritage?

URING the first anxious
days, those in my country stricken by
the sudden violence of the floods had
to stifle their distress and devote all
their efforts to the immense task of
rescue and protection. At that time,
the sympathy shown by the whole
world stirred feelings of deep gratitude,
encouragement and hope in Italy.
In Tuscany and Venetia, two regions
which are among the richest in monuÂ¬
ments and works of art, the toll of

criticism and on the history of art.

damage and destruction is immense,
particularly in Florence and Venice,
though other important historical
centres have also been hit in varyÂ¬
ing degrees.
In Venice it has been found that
the most precious works of art (sculpÂ¬
tures and paintings) in the museums
and churches have escaped injury.
But very serious damage much of
it irreparable has been caused to the
libraries (including the historically imÂ¬
portant Biblioteca Marciana), the GiorÂ¬
gio Cini Foundation, archives and art
collections, art and antique shops.
The chief cause for alarm in Venice
is the state of monuments, churches
and palazzi in the picturesque old parts
of the city. Water polluted with fuel
oil from tanks replenished for the winÂ¬
ter has risen several metres and
seriously defaced and fouled these
buildings. Their restoration will be
long and difficult.
Great anxiety is also felt about the
stability of many important historic
buildings already in a precarious
state and in fact of the entire city.
The surge of the floodwaters placed
abnormal stresses on old walls already
weakened by constant dampness and
on their foundations which, as is well
known, rest on piles. (See Unesco
Courier, January 1965).
The most immediate problems are
those of inspection and of carrying
out the necessary reinforcement and
restoration operations. We fear that
there are unpleasant surprises in store
for us here.
Venice's old ills have become more
acute, thus making us better aware of
the price which has to be paid for its
beauty.
The situation calls
measures:
for radical
the movement of water in the
lagoon must be controlled by making
it independent of the tides in the AdriaÂ¬
tic: this is an enormous undertaking
but absolutely essential;
sufficient financial and technical
resources must be made available for
the restoration and maintenance of the
monuments and the historic setting;
a new use as public and cultural
buildings must be found for the main
private palazzi, in order to save them
from the threat and hence from the
risk of being left derelict.
As for Florence, it is a city disfigurÂ¬
ed, an artistic heritage built up over
long centuries of artistic fervour graÂ¬
vely damaged and in part lost forever
because of the violence of the natural

### Years to repair the damage
Dual threat to Venice
Venice has never been in greater peril. Last November, storm tides
breached its protective walls, flooding the city to a depth of several feet
(right) and exposing it to a powerful additional impact from the Adriatic.
The Italian Government has earmarked nearly 40,000 million lire
($63 million) to help save the city. Venice is built on a foundation of
old wooden piles (below) driven into the soft ground of several hundred
tiny islands. The stability of its buildings is increasingly threatened by
subsidence of the lagoon bed (see the "Unesco Courier", January 1965).
Erosion from the surge of waters is also attacking the foundations and
causing increasing damage to monuments, churches, palaces and other
old buildings. An enormous programme of reinforcement and restoration
throughout the city is needed, and also protection from the Adriatic tides.

forces unleashed in the space of a
few hours.
In the centre of Florence, 18 churÂ¬
ches, with a wealth of works of art,
were flooded with water and mud,
their altars and ornaments overturned,
their paving stones uprooted, the fresÂ¬
coes and paintings on wood adornÂ¬
ments which made them living muÂ¬
seums seriously damaged.
Many palazzi of historic interest as
well as museums and libraries have
been damaged. The picturesque
shops of the Ponte Vecchio have
been destroyed. The embankments of
the Arno have been damaged and
parts of them have collapsed.
The list of treasures affected by the
flood is still incomplete. But it is
known already that the following works
of art, to take account of "only the
most famous, have been rescued from
the water:
313 paintings on wood,
431 paintings on canvas,
11 series of frescoes,
39 individual frescoes,
31 frescoes which had been removÂ¬
ed from their original settings,
14 groups of sculpture,
144 individual sculptures, including
22 wood carvings,
23 illuminated codices.
In all, more than 1,000 works of art
of outstanding importance.
Considered by their respective
periods, the damaged paintings inÂ¬
clude:
over 30 paintings of the 13th and
14th centuries, including works by Ci-
mabue, Lorenzo Monaco, Lorenzetti,
Bernardo Daddi, Giovanni del Biondo;
over 40 paintings of the 15th century,
including works by Fra AngÃ©lico, Co-
simo Rosselli, Lorenzo di Credi, Paolo
Schiave, Domenico Veneziano, Neri di
Bicci, Alessio Baldovinetti;
nearly 150 paintings of the 16th cenÂ¬
tury, including works by the greatest
artists of the age, from Bronzino to
Vasari and from Cristoforo Allori to
Poppi and Naldini.
To these must be added the loss
of a quantity, yet to be established
but certainly very great, of lesser
works of art, church ornaments and
vestments, and documents, which,
together with the major works of art,
created in Florence an incomparable
atmosphere of artistic civilization.
Faced by this disaster, we have
tried to provide for the most urgent

needs and to deal with the grave situaÂ¬
tion by every means possible.
We have been greatly touched by
the offers of assistance, the personal
contributions and the supplies of
equipment which began to come in
from all sides as soon as the first
news of the disaster became known.
Foreign museums, international instiÂ¬
tutions, Unesco's International Centre
for the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property in
Rome, and scholars and scientists in
all countries have offered their supÂ¬
port.
The emergency and the absolutely
exceptional situation in the city of FloÂ¬
rence made it impossible for us at the
start to call on anyone except the peoÂ¬
ple already on the spot. There is no
doubt, however, that we shall need
to take advantage of these exceptional
offers in the future programme of work
and we shall indeed be glad to count
on them.
For the most pressing needs, the
Italian Government has already alloÂ¬
cated 4 thousand million lire (over
$6.4 million) to save cultural property,
as well as 1,300 million lire (over
$2 million) for the University of FloÂ¬
rence alone. But it can already be
seen that these costs will have to be
multiplied five-fold for the work of resÂ¬
toration to be undertaken over the
next few years. For Venice, the
government has added 9,000 million
lire ($14.4 million) to the 30 thousand
million lire ($48 million) already alloÂ¬
cated to the preservation of the city.
Over sixty priority operations are at
present in progress in the chief histoÂ¬
ric buildings of Florence and the surÂ¬
rounding area: they are being cleared
out, the mud is being removed, shaken
structures are being strengthened and
technical studies in view of subsequent
integral restoration work- are being
carried out.
As regards works of art (paintings,
sculptures, tapestries, ancient weaÂ¬
pons, miniatures), priority has been
given to their recovery and then to
a preliminary clean-up; the main
effort is being concentrated on fixing
painted surfaces, which, where they
have not already been lost, are all
in great danger. This is an extremely
delicate operation.
Fifty technicians sent from the main
specialized laboratories in Italy (the
Central Institute of Restoration at
Rome, and the restoration workshops
of Bologna, Milan and Naples) are
now working in the Florence laboraÂ¬
tories under the direction of the

(Continued)
Superintendent of the Galleries of FloÂ¬
rence, Professor Ugo Procacci and
his immediate colleagues. Thanks to
their courageous efforts in this diffiÂ¬
cult work, carried out with self-sacriÂ¬
fice and devotion, it has been possible
to rescue a great part of this artistic
heritage and return it to a state in
which it can be saved.
Shifting one crate may be work for a
handyman, but shifting a thousand
crates becomes work for an engineer.
The restoration of a picture is
always a delicate and complex operaÂ¬
tion; but we have to restore several
hundred works of art simultaneously.
This raises problems of unprecedented
scope and complexity: co-ordination of
research in each individual case; mobiÂ¬
lization of technical resources; assessÂ¬
ment of restoration costs, which will
certainly be very high.
Even under the most favourable
conditions, this immense artistic heriÂ¬
tage cannot be quickly and fully resÂ¬
tored. There are technical reasons
why short cuts cannot be taken in
certain operations. It is expected that
several years will be required, certainly
more than five.
Never before have we been faced
with the need to operate on such an
enormous scale, for so many works
of art.
We have a long-term programme
before us, involving much work and
responsibility. We are ready to face
it. We pledge ourselves to this task,
for which we shall be responsible to
the world of culture, convinced that it
will continue to support us with its
understanding, sympathy and co-opÂ¬
eration as it has so admirably done
up to the present.

The plight

Florentine
artisans
p
I LORENCE is the treasure house of Renaissance
art and thought, but it is also a treasure house of living
people, people who are heirs to the traditions that were
established when that grand creative upsurge of the human
spirit had subsided. In and around Florence live some
7,000 artisans, men and women who fashion the objects
which generations of visitors to Florence have been
delighted to admire and to buy.
Working with the skills of centuries In his fingers and
using tools that make mockery of machines, the Florentine
artisan is unique. Yet some 6,000 of them have lost their
all tools, materials, workshops. Most of them are not
young and it is feared that they will lack the resources
to start again, painfully to reconstruct their shattered lives,

and instead will turn to other kinds of work for a livelihood.
The world will be the poorer for their loss.
It was heartbreaking to wade through the byways of
Florence and see the owners of the little shops for which
Florence is celebrated struggling to put things to rights.
Some, hopefully, displayed the pitiful remains of their
stock, saturated and stained, for sale at rock-bottom prices
in the hope of recovering a few lire to help start again.
But more often than not the stuff was unsellable.
Some 6,000 of Florence's 10,000 shops have been desÂ¬
troyed. Thousands of families are homeless and those
lucky enough to have ground-floor apartments still habitÂ¬
able are doomed to live for many months in rooms satuÂ¬
rated with water and reeking of fuel oil. Many houses,
undermined by the surging torrent of the flood have started
to collapse and are shored up with great timbers.
Nevertheless, the work of clearing the streets of debris
and mud is going ahead swiftly and methodically right
through the night. Every little shop has its owner, someÂ¬
times alone, more often with helpers, busily scrubbing
walls, repairing floors and hammering up counters and
showcases, and every shop has in it a brazier or even
a bonfire, to dry off the interior. Over all the rain pelts
down as it has ceaselessly for weeks, perpetuating the
slimy mud in streets and alleys and adding immeasurably
to trie discomfort of the shaken city. And over everything,
in every building, in every street, a dank humidity and the
acrid tang of fuel oil.

### Dimensions of a disaster
DIMENSIONS
OF A DISASTER
The list which follows of artistic
and cultural casualties suffered
by the city of Florence alone is
necessarily incomplete. It will be
months, perhaps years, before a
detailedanddefinitive assessment
can be made of the losses.
Fifteen hundred paintings were damaged in Florence alone. An emergency
"hospital" has been opened for these flood-damaged masterpieces in the huge
building that normally houses the unique collection of lemon trees of the Palazzo Pitti.
The building, 120 metres long by 10 metres high (400 ft. by 30 ft.), has been
transformed into a vast insulated chamber equipped with furnaces and air blowers.
Paintings on wood which demand a long and delicate treatment are set on wooden
tables and sprayed with special disinfecting gas to kill mould. Above,
"Noli me tangere", a celebrated work by Pontecormo (1531) based on a sketch
by Michelangelo. It was preserved in the Casa Buonarroti (Michelangelo's home).
Except for a hand, the figure of Christ has been completely effaced (right
of photo). A city set on the hills in background has almost vanished. Left, works
in marble, bronze and ceramic from a museum storeroom after rescue from the mud.
MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES
MUSEO ARCHEOLOGICO. Thirty-four
ground-floor rooms, including Etruscan
topographical museum, invaded by floods.
Floors burst open, glass cases demolished
and exhibits buried in mud. Over 9,000
vases and other valuable relics, including
many objects in bronze and other metals,
await cleaning and restoration. In restoraÂ¬
tion studio, equipment and objects being
restored, including six painted Egyptian
sarcophagi, badly damaged. Photographic
studio equipment destroyed and records

DIMENSIONS OF A DISASTER (Cont'd)
MUSEO BARGELLO. Four metres (13 ft.)
of water in exhibition room of Michelangelo
sculptures submerged and stained these
works. Three terracotta figures by Tribolo,
another by Vincenzo Danti and the bronze
"Samson and the Philistine" by Perino da
Vinci all broken. Courtyard sculptures by
Ammammati and Giovanni Bologna stained
by oil and water. Valuable collection of
armour and weapons damaged.
CASA BUONARROTI. Ground floor flooded
up to the vault. All works on this level
suffered. Two paintings by Bronzino and
Battista Franco almost ruined. The collecÂ¬
tion of portraits of Michelangelo (including
the well-known one by Bugiardini), and the
"Two Lovers" attributed to Titian immersed
and covered with mud. Some della Robbia
statuettes broken. Recently discovered
"Crucifix" by Michelangelo unharmed.
CONSERVATORIO CHERUBINI. In the
library, two shelves of autograph and in
part unpublished musical manuscripts (16th
to 19th centuries), including the "Fondo
Pitti", and unpublished manuscripts by
Rossini flooded and bemired. Much of
this material may still be saved. Collection
of musical instruments, including works by
Stradivarius, was fortuitously saved, having
been temporarily moved upstairs.
MUSEO DELL' OPERA DEL DUOMO. Over
100 statues covered with mud and oil.
Uninue collection of models for construction
of cathedral and Brunelleschi's model for its
dome severely damaged by upthrust of
air and water under floor. Over 6,000
volumes of ancient archives in basement
damaged plus 55 illuminated Renaissance
musical codices.
MUSEO DI STORIA DELLA SCIENZA.
Many collections of inestimable value
engulfed by mud. Collections of ancient
clocks, alembics, scales and scientific
instruments (16th to 20th centuries), incluÂ¬
ding Edison's phonograph, destroyed or
seriously damaged.
MUSEO HORNE. This museum, presentÂ¬
ed to Florence by an English scholar
and collector, Herbert Home, was seriÂ¬
ously damaged. Over four metres (14 ft.)
of water and mud in ground floor
and cellars. Among damaged works: a
stucco attributed to Luca della Robbia;
"Drunkenness of Noah" and a "Madonna"
by Beccafumi; a "Saint Sebastian" by
Ferrarese; a "Madonna" by Begarelli; an
"Adoration" by Bartolomeo di Giovanni; a
school of Ghiberti stucco, "Madonna and
Angels" (shattered); a bust by Matteo
Civitali. One hundred volumes of archives
(14th to 18th centuries) saturated and fine
Renaissance furniture and woodwork partly
destroyed.

Using vegetable strainers to sift carefully
through the mud, specialists search for tiny
fragments of pamt from the celebrated "Crucifix"
by Cimabue. In the museum of the church
of Santa Croce water submerged most
of the big wooden crucifix. When water withdrew,
blisters opened on the paintwork and 60%
of the painted surface flaked away.

### Dimensions of a disaster
The 'Crucifix'
by Cimabue
A SEVEN
CENTURIES-OLD
MASTERPIECE
RUINED
Cimabue's "Crucifix" (detail
right), the masterpiece which
launched a new era in Florentine
painting in the 13th century,
is now ruined (below).
The work had already survived
a series of disasters.
Placed high on the choir screen
in the church of Santa Croce,
it came through the great floods
of 1333 and 1466 unscathed.
About 1500 it was moved
to the left wall of the church,
otherwise it would have been
destroyed in 1512 when a storm
toppled the campanile, which hurled
down a mass of debris on top
of the choir screen.
After being moved in and out'
of various chapels, the "Crucifix"
ended up on the top floor
of the Uffizi Gallery, where it
would have been safe
in the recent floods. But less
than two years ago the work was
returned to Santa Croce and put
in the low-lying museum where
the waters reached
it on November 4.

Baptistery door.
This doorway was wrought in
1336 by Andrea Pisano, who
related the life of John the BapÂ¬

twenty bas-reliefs to which were
added eight allegorical panels
representing the virtues.

### The Painting hospital in the lemon grove
THE PAINTING HOSPITAL
IN THE LEMON GROVE
by Harold J. Plenderleith

n November 4, 1966, the
swollen Arno river burst its retaining
walls and flooded all the central secÂ¬
tion of Florence, the level of the waters
reaching heights between 1.50 and
6 metres (4 to 20 ft.) above street
level. In Venice the sea broke the
coastal dams at several points and the
water rose to about 1.50 metre above
street level.
Because these events took place at
an early hour (between 8 and 12 a. m.)
and due to the fact that the day was
a national holiday, the death toll was
less than might have been expected
from the magnitude of the catastrophe.
The damage to cultural property,
however, was immense; while initially,
at all events, the relatively slow rise
of the waters left time for people to
reach higher ground, not much could
be done for the immense wealth of
works of art, the libraries and the
archives that stood in the path of the
flood.
It must be recognized that the flood
level was far above anything that had
HAROLD J. PLENDERLEITH is director of
the International Centre for the Study of
the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural
Property in Rome. He was In Florence
on November 3, 7966, and thus witÂ¬
nessed the catastrophic floods. Before
becoming the first director of the Rome
Centre in 1959, Mr. Plenderleith was
professor of chemistry at the Royal AcaÂ¬
demy of Arts, London, and Keeper of the
Research Laboratory at the British Museum.
His best known work is "The Conservation
of Antiquities and Works of Art" (Oxford
University Press, London, Toronto, New
York, 1957).
ever been recorded even though
records went back to the 11th century
in Florence. This explains why large
numbers of objects that were susceptÂ¬
ible to damage even by short expoÂ¬
sure to damp now found themselves
inundated completely immersed in
muddy water contaminated with black
oil from domestic central heating plants
and from submerged cars.
Dramatic rescue operations took
place in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence
where the waters progressively invadÂ¬
ed the painting storerooms and the
restoration cabinet; in the latter, paintÂ¬
ings by Giotto, Simone Martini and
other great masters were evacuated
just ahead of the rising water.
Part of the collection in the storeÂ¬
rooms could be lifted to upper levels
through a window which had to be
broken, as the door was already
obstructed by water, but many paintÂ¬
ings had to be left behind. At the
very time that the salvage operations
were taking place, the Renaissance
stone building of the Uffizi, exposed
to the full blast of the raging torrent,
was felt to be shuddering violently
and many thought it would collapse as
a whole.
Not even a partial salvage was
possible in other parts of the city: the
museum of Santa Croce and the CapÂ¬
pella dei Pazzi were buried under 5-6
metres (16-20 ft.) of water. Paintings
on wood by Cimabue, Bronzino, Va-
sari, Salviati and detached murals by
Orcagna were completely submerged.
Other inundated areas were Casa
Buonarroti with a complete art gallery,
the church of SS. Apostoli with a
famous Vasari panel, S. Ambrogio,
S. Piero a Ponti and a number of
other churches, less known perhaps,
but each one a small precious museum
with altarpieces some of which had
been standing in their original positions
within their original frames ever since
the 15th centuryl
The bronze doors of the Baptistery
in Piazza del Duomo were forced open
by the great flood of water now havÂ¬
ing obtained a calculated speed of
40 mph; some of the precious reliefs
by Ghiberti and Andrea Pisano fell
down and a famous piece of sculpture
in wood by Donatello (the Maddalena)
was reached by the water, and
seriously damaged.
What happened to books and archÂ¬
ives was even worse: the National
Library (300,000 volumes) and the UniÂ¬
versity Libraries (100,000 volumes)
were completely inundated. So was
the State Archive of Florence with its
unique collection of codices and
manuscripts, an immense amount of
still unstudied and unrecorded material
essential for the study of Florentine
history and art, one of the reference
points of western civilization. Here
some 40,000 volumes were involved.
In the Archaeological Museum
where the Etruscan collection was at
least as important as Villa Giulia's in
Rome, the flood filled up the cellar,
then the vaults burst open under the
upward rush of ascending water: showÂ¬
cases on the ground floor were shatterÂ¬
ed and the objects dispersed.
In Venice the Marciana Library was
invaded by waters, but paintings and
other precious works of art could, for
the greater part at least, be transportÂ¬
ed away from the menaced areas.

On the evening of November 4 the
waters started to recede and by night
the river in Florence was back within
its original boundaries; more slowly
the sea retired in Venice. On ground
floors the submerged objects reappearÂ¬
ed covered by a thin layer of fine drab
coloured mud; black residues of oil
marked the walls and statues, parallel
black lines indicating the levels of the
receding flood.
On superficial examination the
objects appeared dirty but unaltered,
but the processes of deterioration iniÂ¬
tiated by the immersion in water were
under Way; a dramatic race against
decay had to be begun at once, if
ever the works of art were to be
saved.
Wood, even very old wood, absorbs
water readily: the process is accomÂ¬
panied by expansion across the fibres.
On painted panels the gesso layer is
softened by the action of water on its
binding medium and loses much of its
consistence while both gesso and coÂ¬
lour layers are distorted by the dimenÂ¬
sional changes in the wooden support.
The big crucifix by Cimabue had
been submerged up to the top of the
head of the Christ; when the water
withdrew blisters appeared on the
surface due both to loss of strength
of the gesso layer and to the rather
speedy contraction of the wood to
which the colour layer could not so
quickly adjust itself. The enormous
weight of the crucifix and its deformÂ¬
ation made it very hard to remove
from its vertical position.
The rescuers hindered by working
over a floor covered by a foot of mud,
were unable to save the situation
in time, and blisters opened and, to
the dismay of all, about 60% of the
painted surface flaked away to fall in
the mud. The friars of S. Croce careÂ¬
fully sifted the mud for days afterÂ¬
wards; they retrieved a large number
of paint flakes, but it is doubtful whe-

The state of this 13th century triptych
(left) dramatically shows the destructive
effects of water on painted wooden
panels. The painting has been taken
from the Santa Croce museum for
treatment in the picture hospital
at the Palazzo Pitti. The child in the
Virgin's arms disappeared as paintwork
fell away after the swelling of the
wooden support. Months may go by
before a painting regains its former
state; It is the time taken to "heal"
paintings that determines the length
of restoration programmes. Right,

an army of art surgeons
ther it will be possible to use them to
reconstruct even part of the lost areas.
Other panels underwent the same
destructive process before the resÂ¬
cuers could reach them, for some
churches remained flooded for days
and it was often quite an acrobatic
feat just to reach paintings located in
positions that were almost inaccessible
even in normal times.
With successive drying of the
wooden panels one could expect that
their condition would further deteriorÂ¬
ate because of the dramatic warping
of supports, splitting due to opposing
and contrasting forces in frames and
panels, extensive blistering and flakÂ¬
ing of the colour layer; It was observÂ¬
ed that the paintings having thick
layers of transparent varnish exhibited
better resistance to water than the
thinly varnished ones.
Canvas paintings showed in general
good resistance, except when physiÂ¬
cally damaged by objects transported
by the flood; however, the latter kind
of damage is less disfiguring by far
than would appear at first sight, a
simple relining operation being the
traditional and effective answer. The
excellent resistance to water of linÂ¬
seed oil based grounds was here the
deciding factor. Neither, in general,
did mural paintings suffer substantial
damage; the hardboard supports of
detached murals, however, easily beÂ¬
came distorted by exposure to changÂ¬
ing humidity and careful control of
their stability will be necessary in the
future.
Two immediate dangers lie ahead
for submerged books and documents:
rotting and physical disintegration of
paper, and the cementing together of
contiguous sheets to form single blocks

the case of a small number of books

technical and scientific problem
relating to the preservation and
restoration of cultural property.
It is an international laboratory
for the study of diseases of stone,
wood and other materials, and also
co-ordinates and stimulates research
into restoration techniques. It helps
to train researchers and technicians
and compiles and publishes special
reports and studies.
It works closely with Unesco, the
International Council of Museums

its work.
Advice given by the centre is
usually based on the reports of
specialists which it sends to make
on-the-spot studies of monuments

of conservation or restoration. TypÂ¬
ical examples Include the preservÂ¬
ation of monuments in Nubia, the

Republic of Korea, and also the
setting up of conservation services
in Tunisia and Morocco.
call for help was made volunteers
came quickly to the rescue.
Private experts and art students
from Florence and from elsewhere in
Italy rallied to help salvage the collecÂ¬
tions and restorers arrived even from
abroad. They had received the news
of the water levels in the town and
they knew what it meant; a painting
restorer drove in from Lugano (SwitzerÂ¬
land) across the partially inundated
highway system, though not really
believing what he was being told ("it
must be one of those inflated newsÂ¬
paper stories"). Others came from
Bologna and Rome; the Rome Centre
made its own immediate contribution
in supporting an emergency expediÂ¬
tion of the neighbouring Istituto CenÂ¬
trale del Restauro.
Panel paintings were the first worry
of the painting experts; to avoid the
sad catastrophe of the Cimabue, panels
had to be laid down flat so that paint
would not fall from them even if blisterÂ¬
ing occurred. Then they had to be
faced with specially fine tissue to give
a strong support to the paint layer,
now held only weakly by the gesso,
and this in view of the foreseen shrinkÂ¬
ing and warping of the support.
Prior to facing, the paintings had
to be cleaned from mud, a very deliÂ¬
cate operation as the mud overlay
softened and swollen surfaces; exper
ience taught that the best way was
to damp the mud again with water
using a soft brush, then to suck up
the muddy water with a very soft
sponge. While Japanese tissue was
generally used as a facing material, in
the rush of the moment almost any
kind of available material had to be
brought into service.
Reconsideration of the problem after
a few hours led to general agreement
that there should be a standard policy
using acrylic resins (Paraloid B72 or
Elvacite 2045) because they would be
easier to re-dissolve in the future and
were not subject to the danger of
being nutrients to mould growth. As
soon as the technique became uniÂ¬
fied the emergency teams ran out of
materials, and a frantic search startÂ¬
ed for Japanese paper and acrylic
resins and their solvents.
Here the Rome Centre had a key
function in assessing the needs and
transmitting the call to possible supÂ¬
pliers. Acrylic resins came from many
sources in Italy and abroad. A resÂ¬
torer from Bologna had a stock at
home; his family went on for days
shaking the slowly dissolving polymer
with the solvent. One great Italian
firm which by chance did not manuÂ¬
facture the precise material required
was kind enough to purchase a large
supply and ship it free to Florence.

### The Painting hospital in the lemon grove
The Laboratory of the National GalÂ¬
lery, London, gathered all that was
available and sent it at the earliest
moment: it arrived (via Rome) on the
table of a restorer in the Uffizi Gallery
within the day and just when he had
exhausted his own personal supply.
It was found that Kleenex tissue
could be used as a substitute for JapaÂ¬
nese paper but it was not easy to find
usable tissue in downtown Florence
where all chemist shops and drugÂ¬
stores had been flooded. The first
packs of Kleenex that the Rome CenÂ¬
tre secured were of a pale blue shade
and this accounts for the bluish tinge
of the faced Bronzino and Vasari
paintings in Santa Croce today!
Parallel with this work carried out
in feverish haste, plans were deveÂ¬
loped for drying the wet panels slowly
under controlled conditions in order
to minimize shrinking and warping.
The Rome Centre took care of placing
hygrometers in the key points where
damaged panels were being collected
and when, seven days after the inunÂ¬
dation the weather turned cold and
dry, the faced panels were lowered
closer to the wet muddy floor, and
wet sawdust was added to keep the
areas damp.
An immense storeroom was in the
meanwhile being prepared where the
400 panels and 1,000 canvases which
had been victims of the disaster could
be sheltered under controlled humidity
and temperature conditions. The so-
called Limonaia, a huge (120 m. long
and 10 m. high) masonry shelter for
the unique collection of lemon trees
of Palazzo Pitti, was requisitioned for
this purpose, and incidentally there
arose the problem of finding another
shelter for the lemon trees which were
threatened with destruction because of
the decreasing temperature.
In a little over one week the LimoÂ¬
naia was converted to become a hospiÂ¬
tal for paintings. It was equipped with
a stock-room for materials and wooden
stands for the pictures; thermal insuÂ¬
lation of walls and windows was imÂ¬
proved and finally a heating and
humidifying system was created. Two
weeks after the inundation the paintÂ¬
ings started to come in; it appeared
that no further damage had taken place
in the panels after the first dramatic
hours.
For- books and documents the
emergency teams were composed of
students, Benedictine friars of abbeys
like the one of Grottaferrata (near
Rome) dedicated over the centuries to
the restoration of codices and manuÂ¬
scripts and of experts from the Istituto
di PatologÃ­a del Libro in Rome. The
emergency procedure consisted in
getting rid of the mud, interleaving
with a suitable kind of paper, then
drying as soon as possible.
Many hundreds of high school and
university students formed lines in the
mud passing books from hand to hand
to evacuate the flooded areas in the
libraries and in the archives. Part of
the books were sent away in blocks
of 10,000 to the Benedictine abbeys
of Praglia, Monte Oliveto, Grottafer
rata, Cesena, S. Maria Novella, or to
the Istituto di PatologÃ­a in Rome, but
some of the most urgent treatment
was begun immediately in Florence.
Water could be squeezed out by
means of hand presses, drying could
be accomplished using industrial dryÂ¬
ing equipment of large dimensions. It
was found for example that tobacco
and brick manufacturers had just the
kind of equipment that was needed.
This work is in progress now. On
the other side precious codices were
removed to the Vatican Library for
specialized treatment.
At the present time it is still imposÂ¬
sible to assess the amount of losses
among the books and archival materials
damaged by the inundation.
At the Archaeological Museum no
emergency intervention has been
carried out so far; here are housed
ceramic and metallic objects from
excavations and these have already
been acclimatised to conditions in
damp soil. The danger here is thought
to be in the mechanical damage to
fragile objects or the possible loss of
loose parts in any hasty recovery
campaign.
Meantime the museum has been
secluded from the rest of the world;
nobody is allowed in the rooms. The
semi-dry mud will be excavated inch
by inch using the most refined archaeoÂ¬
logical techniques. Repair of the damÂ¬
aged objects will come in due time,
using methods that are already well
established.

OVER A MILLION WATERLOGGED BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS
Hundreds of thousands of books old and new, irreplaceable historical
documents, unpublished manuscripts of literary and musical works were
submerged by floodwaters in the basements of Florence. At the National
Library alone, 300.000 volumes had to be rescued from scenes of indesÂ¬
cribable chaos (photo left). Teams of helpers came spontaneously to
Florence. Among them were many young people, including Italian and foreign
students. Chains of volunteers worked day and night (above) to evacuate
the sodden, muddy volumes. These were washed and then stored in safety
(right) to await first-aid treatment. Below, volunteer helper puts blotting
paper between pages. This operation has to be repeated three times for
each page, for each volume, for hundreds of thousands of volumes.

ings by facing and controlling their
environmental conditions obviously is
no final solution of the problem of
ensuring permanency and full visibility
of the paintings. Many roads, howÂ¬
ever, are opened for possible treatment
and one can safely assume that the
treatment will be diversified and that
it will be adapted to the particular
conditions of each single panel.
Probably an effort will be made to
avoid transfer of panel paintings to a
new support, since this operation may
imply a substantial alteration of the
work of art. It may well be that the
damp wood could be treated with soluÂ¬
tions of synthetic or natural resins in
order to displace the water from the
inner structure by substituting the
inert resin, thus avoiding collapse of
the cell walls on drying.
It must be remembered, however,
that the gesso ground might have lost
part of its cohesive strength, so impairÂ¬
ing the adhesion of the colour layer
to the support. In such conditions the
painting would live in perpetual danÂ¬
ger of blistering and flaking of the
paint. When, as in such a case, the
strength of the ground cannot be resÂ¬
tored by appropriate fixing operations,
transfer to a new support is likely to
be inevitable if the painting is to be
saved.
Problems lie ahead also for books,
archival documents and manuscripts,
for obviously industrial dessication
cannot be pushed too far or it would
damage the mechanical properties of
the sheets. If left too humid, on the
other hand, the paper would be subject
to mould infection. This underlines the
importance of adopting a disinfection
procedure. It appears that vacuum
fumigation with ethylene oxide will be
the preferred procedure, but there is
a serious problem of obtaining specÂ¬
ialized equipment and technical personÂ¬
nel to handle it.
Since books and documents are
being distributed in different locations
for treatment, the Istituto di PatologÃ­a
del Libro is planning to use movable
fumigation units which could be postÂ¬
ed according to momentary requireÂ¬
ments and at the time of writing a
hue and cry is being issued in the
hope of locating such additional help.
Who will do the restoration of manuÂ¬
scripts? We have seen that a soluÂ¬
tion to this problem has already been
found for paper materials; it is fortunÂ¬
ate that many religious institutions
in Italy are specialized in this kind
of work. Far more difficult is the
problem for paintings (for a total of
over a thousand paintings requires
restoration work by skilled personnel).
This exceeds the limits of possibiÂ¬
lity for all the state institutions and
private restorers in Italy. However, it
must be remembered that offers of
help by specialized experts are comÂ¬
ing in from all over the world: Britain,
U.S.S.R., U.S.A., Yugoslavia, the FedeÂ¬
ral German Republic, Canada, Poland
among others.
The Florence disaster thus opens
the way for a major project in interÂ¬
national co-operation which, aside from
its spiritual value as a proof of goodÂ¬
will, has deep implications for techniÂ¬
cal exchange and progress. If proÂ¬
gress results from disaster, as often
happens, it will not be for the first
time in Italian history that victory has
been thus achieved.

of Renaissance painting were submerged under several feet of water. Below, deterioration
is clearly visible on Vasari's "Last Supper", painted in 1546 (left of photo) and on

them with special paper to absorb moisture and consolidate the paint. Photo Â© Epoca Giorgio Lotti, Milan

A N atmospheric disturÂ¬

November 3, 4 and 5, 1966 poured
torrential rain over vast areas of Italy
for more than 48 hours. Snow already
accumulated in the mountains thawed
rapidly. Abnormally high tides and
gales lashed the Gulf of Venice.
These are the cause of the rampaging
floods that have devastated large parts
of Central Italy.
Almost one-third of the country,

has suffered grievous loss of life as
well as serious damage and destrucÂ¬
tion, not only to public works, technical
installations and industrial plants, but
also to some of the finest treasures in
an artistic heritage that belongs to all
mankind.
In the last fifty years, Italy has been
the victim of 130 serious floods and
innumerable lesser Inundations. In
the Po delta alone (the Province of
Rovigo between the lower reaches of
the Po and Adige), 20 floods occurred
between 1945 and 1965 alone.
For centuries Italy has been fightÂ¬

cal and financial efforts employed have

THE ANATOMY OF THE FLOOD (Continued)

result that they have succeeded only
in the case of the most recurrent
floods.
Take the work of afforestation and
the stabilization of mountain regions.
This is the very basis of any struggle
against floods, but its results are not
seen for at least a generation. Storms
nearly always occur when the soil is
just beginning to become firm and in
a matter of hours a cloudburst destroys
the work and hopes of many years.
Embankments are built, destroyed
and then rebuilt higher and higher in
a continuous battle against the enorÂ¬
mous quantities of solid matter brought
down by rivers in spate because there
are no natural or artificial lakes to halt
them. These alluvial deposits evenÂ¬
tually raise the level of river-beds
above that of the surrounding countryÂ¬
side.
Finally, man's hunger for land has
meant that the unfarmed areas betÂ¬
ween one embankment and the next,
or in the vicinity of deltas where floods
were once able to spread and lose
some of their force, have shrunk more
and more. People settle in areas
which should have continued to play
a protective role, and where measÂ¬
ures taken against the most recurrent
and therefore less important floods
may well have created a false feeling
of security.
I N Italy there are few large
rivers but tens of thousands of torÂ¬
rents, due to the morphology and
hydrographie structure of the Italian
soil: 10.4 million hectares (26 million
acres) of mountains; 11 million hecÂ¬
tares of hilly ground, and less than
6 million hectares (15 million acres)
of plains. So the waters rush down
steep, bare slopes, no longer impeded
by the forest which once covered a
great part of the peninsula.
Since the Middle Ages entire forests
have been destroyed, either to provide
timber for Europe's fleets, or to obtain
land for farming or pasture. Three and
a half million hectares (8.6 million
acres) need replanting with trees;
meanwhile the erosion of the land
continues unchecked and the waters
continue to carry away rich humus to
the sea and to cause landslides and
avalanches.
All this was demonstrated more
violently than ever during the recent
floods. The waters tearing down the
mountain sides brought with them
stones and rocks and earth. An
already precarious situation was agÂ¬
gravated by temporary obstructions
backwaters, diversion of river beds,
silting the disastrous effects of which
persist long after the waters have
retreated, as though the waters themÂ¬
selves had become petrified in a new
world of apocalyptic appearance.
0 N the plains the muddy
waters have left a malodorous deposit
of mud and oil as well as the putrefying
remains of animals and plants to sully
alike fertile fields and. famous monuÂ¬
ments, the patient work of small craftsÂ¬
men and vast installations of modern
industry, irreplaceable manuscripts and
yellowing papers in some humble
office.
To this must be added the onÂ¬
slaught of the raging sea on the barely
reclaimed lands of the Po delta lying
just beyond the battered and broken
defences of Venice.
The discharge of flood waters
depends on various meteorological,
geological and hydraulic factors : inÂ¬
tensity, distribution and duration of
the rains (sometimes accompanied by
the rapid melting of accumulated
snow); general climatic conditions;
greater or lesser permeability of the
basic geological formations and of the
layer of detritus covering them ; types
and extent of cultivation; shape of the
major and minor hydrographie basins;
gradient of the slopes and drainage
channels; natural and artificial lakes;
areas for the spreading of flood waters;
stabilization of the river-beds or along
the river-beds ; river defences ; public
or industrial works ; human habitations.
Every flood is the result of a special
combination of some of these factors,
each of which has a specific imÂ¬
portance. Those in which an almost
equal number of predominant factors
of average magnitude are combined
cause the normal floods which occur
with some regularity (on an average
once a year or once every two, three,
five or ten years). Combinations of the
maximum number of factors of extreme
magnitude cause exceptional floods
which may occur only- once every
50, 100, 200 or 1,000 years, or even
longer.
The chief stumbling block to foreÂ¬
casting the recurrence of exceptional
floods is the lack of precise informÂ¬
ation about the number and importance
of the factors involved, and partiÂ¬
cularly the maximum figures for rains,
snow, temperatures etc. Available
statistics, which rarely date back more
than a century, at best indicate a
tendency and certainly not maximum
figures, which we are still unable to
calculate even by theoretical studies.
Observations of present-day floods
give some indication of the extent of
floods in past times, but they do not
tell us how many of the factors inÂ¬
volved had attained their maximum
intensity.
Such figures, in any case, usually
apply to water levels and not to the
corresponding discharges. Water levels
fluctuate even with the same discharge
because they depend to a great extent
on local conditions in the river-bed,
the existence of breaches and whether
or not there is room for the water to
spread.
T O speak of a maximum
flood, as people often do, is absurd.
Instead, we should talk of floods with
a probability of one-in-a-hundred, or
one-in-a-thousand; floods, in fact, that
occur on an average once every
hundred years (centennial floods), or
once every thousand years (millennial
floods) etc. "On an average" in this
context stresses the aspect of probÂ¬
ability; centennial floods may occur
twice in a century, in consecutive
years even, and there may be no
floods at all in the next century.
Hence, forecasts can do no more
than assess approximately the probÂ¬
able scale of flooding. The larger the
flood, the less often it is likely to
occur because of the reduced posÂ¬
sibility that all the factors involved in
a large flood will reach their maximum
levels simultaneously.

It is impossible to predict when
exceptional floods are likely to occur,
except in general terms that they are
much more likely to happen in certain
seasons (autumn and spring, for
example) or just before the floods
actually begin, on the basis of rainÂ¬
fall observations, the state of the
ground, the capacity for water storage
and so on.
This also requires a careful analysis
of previous floods, their seriousness
in relation to presumed orders of
magnitude and the time taken by the
floodwaters to reach the primary and
secondary basins. The analysis itself
presupposes that an efficient hydro-
meteorological network and communiÂ¬
cations system has already existed for
some time and, above all, that the
phenomena will develop according to
a certain pattern.
The system for protection against
floods is based, in short, on an emÂ¬
pirical knowledge of the past which
becomes increasingly uncertain the
further we go back. It can never be
foolproof since it cannot cover certain
factors the maximum value of which is
not known.
Furthermore a system designed for
protection against very infrequent
events is so little used that the floods
of the past are forgotten and the
system comes to be regarded as a
perfect guarantee of safety for all
time.
I
HE result is that its upkeep
is neglected and its efficiency impaired
by failure to apply safety measures
to a wide enough area. But the play
of forces keeps on shifting until one
day an exceptional combination of
circumstances brings disaster in its
wake. Paradoxically, the stronger the
defence system, the more catastrophic
the results of its collapse.
The Italian floods of November 1966
fit into this pattern. To find examples
of similar floods in the past we have,
in some instances, to go back several
centuries to descriptions contained in
old, forgotten chronicles; in other
cases, these floods are a repetition of
recent events, considered so excepÂ¬
tional that their recurrence was believÂ¬
ed impossible.
In the Venetia region, the rains of
3-4 November 1966 came when the
draining lands of the hydrographie
basins were already saturated by the
heavy rainfall of the previous months,
which had already produced considerÂ¬
able flooding at a very unusual season
(August 1966).
A
point to note is that other
floods, likewise fairly serious, had
occurred in 1965. In November 1966 the
downpour continued for about 38 hours
without a break, and increased steadily
in intensity from about 10 mm (4 in.) per
hour at the beginning to 20 mm. per
hour in the last three hours. This
accounts for the formation of a single
flood wave which attained, and in
many cases exceeded, the maximum
levels previously recorded in a number
of streams.
The actual rain which fell in 24
hours amounted, in many cases, to
15-20% of the mean annual rainfall,
and the amount which fell in the
38-hour period totalled as much as
30% or even 37% of the annual mean.
This exceptionally heavy rainfall
caused flood waves which rose almost
everywhere to levels higher than thÃ©
maximum previously recorded, even
during the disastrous flooding of the
Adige Â¡n 1882. The recent flooding of
the Adige downstream from Trento
was considerably lessened by disÂ¬
charging 70 million cubic metres of
water into Lake Garda through the
recently completed run-off canal.
The situation in the terminal sections
of the rivers in Venetia was aggravated
by a high tide which reached a level
never before recorded . in Venice :
1.90 metres (6 ft.) above sea level,
against 1.53 metres (5 ft.) recorded
in November 1951. Statistics indicaÂ¬
ted that on the average the level
would probably rise to 1.60 metres
only once in a century, and to 1.93
metres (just over 6 ft.) only once in a
thousand years. What happened to
Venice can thus be regarded as a
once-in-a-thousand-years event.
The normal tides at Venice cause a
maximum rise of 0.60 metres (2 ft.)
above the mean, but this level can be

THE ANATOMY OF THE FLOOD (Continued)
A third of a years rain
in 38 hours
raised considerably by, among other
factors, an exceptionally high velocity
sirocco and atmospheric pressures
that are low over the Upper Adriatic
and high over the Southern Adriatic
and Central Mediterranean.
The exceptionally high tides overÂ¬
came the centuries-old defences built
at the time of the Republic of Venice
to protect the lagoon and the city;
further south they flooded a large part
of the lands in the Po delta. ForÂ¬
tunately the great river did not join
forces with the sea, but remained
threatening, a few inches below the
level of the ground already flooded.
In the Arno basin rain was also quite

annual rainfall in 24 hours and 25% to
30% in 48 hours. The level of the Arno
reached 11 metres (36 ft.) in Florence
as against 7.08 metres (24 ft.) in 1942.
In the Ombrone basin and the neighÂ¬
bouring Grosseto area, rainfall of 268
millimetres (over 10 inches) was
recorded at Baetignano as against a
previous maximum of 114 millimetres
(over 4 inches), and 232 mm at GrosÂ¬
seto as against 103 mm.
The floods of November 1966 renderÂ¬
ed more catastrophic by the heavy
seas and by landslides due to the rapid
melting of snow, caused over a
hundred deaths, including those of
nine of the rescuers. The damage to
works of art and to state and private
archives is incalculable; material damÂ¬
age is estimated at $2,000 million.
As for agriculture, 310,000 hectares
(990,000 acres) of fertile land were
inundated, 5,000 kilometres (3,000
miles) of country roads were destroyed
or deteriorated, 50,000 cattle were
drowned, 12,000 buildings and 16,000
agricultural machines were damaged,
112 agro-industrial plants and over
three million quintals (170,000 tons)
of fodder were ruined.
Industry counts over 200 damaged
factories; thousands of small enterÂ¬
prises had to close down, putting
60,000 out of work. At least 20,000
artisans' workshops and 40,000 shops
were damaged.
The damage to public works, the
tourist industry, private houses and
cars is enormous.
But reconstruction is already in full
swing.

125,000 U.S.-international
educational exchanges
A record total of 125,000 college and
university students, teachers and scholars
participated in educational exchange proÂ¬
grammes between the U.S.A. and 150 other
countries in 1965-66, according to "Open
Doors 1966", the annual census of the
Institute of International Education, New
York. Nearly 83,000 students and over
9,000 scholars from overseas studied,
taught or did research at U.S. colleges
and universities. As in past years, the
largest group of students, 23,049, or 35 per
cent of all foreign students, came from the
Far East.
'En avant' language lessons
for Britain's 8-year-olds
Children in over 100 British primary
schools are learning French, using a special
language course developed for 8 to 11-
year-olds by the Nuffield Foundation.
Entitled "En avant" (Forward), the course
lasts for three years in primary school
and two in secondary. Early stages are
based on games, acting, cartoons and
recordings of songs and conversation in
Franch schools. From these oral lessons
the course progresses to reading and
writing, translations and finally, revision
and practice. Experiments in British schools
with these methods showed that children
learned an average of 500 words a year.
In three years they could write and speak
simple French without difficulty. Similar
courses in Spanish, Russian and German
are being tested for introduction in 1967
and 1968.
U.S.S.R. gives 300 books
to Unesco Library
Three hundred books and two documenÂ¬
tary films have been presented to the
Unesco Library by the Soviet National
Commission for Unesco on the occasion
of Unesco's 20th anniversary. The books
consist of Soviet political, scientific and
literary works, dictionaries, textbooks on
science and education and art albums
devoted to major Soviet art galleries. The
titles of the documentary films are: "The
Road to Science" and "Steps to the World
of Beauty".
REPUBLIQUE DU MALI
From the Unesco New:
Small industries, big results
International experience is helping to
boost the activity of small industries in
Malaysia. In Singapore alone, some 2,000
small enterprises come within the orbit of
a programme assisted by the International
Labour Organization to expand and improve
light industry and thereby create more
employment.
Electricity from hot water
A power station operating on hot underÂ¬
ground water and designed to supply cheap
electricity to a wide area is being built at
Makhach Kala, near Baku, in the U.S.S.R.
Though not the first station of its type,
it is the first to be built outside a volcanic
area (where superheated water is found
close to the surface). To tap subterranean
sources which attain a temperature of
160 degrees O, engineers at Makhach
Kala drilled down more than 15,000 feet.
Youth science leaders
for Mali
A Unesco-organized training course for
youth science leaders was held recently
in Bamako, Mali. Lectures and practical
work covered optics, astronomy, electricity,
radio, aerodynamics and other scientific
subjects. Youth leaders who took part will
now organize science courses for groups
of young people in six regions of Mali.
Record world fish catch
A record catch of 52,400,000 metric tons

Organization. Peru was leading country
with 7,400,000 tons, followed by Japan and
then, FAO believes, by Mainland China
and the Soviet Union. Mr. Oris V. Wells,
Deputy Director-General of FAO, recently
said that better fishery administration and
services were essential if the world's
protein diet was to be improved with more
fish. Problems of control and rational use
occurred because most fish stocks are in
international waters.
$2.5 million water project
for Istanbul
More than $2.5 million will be spent on
a Turkish Government project for the
Istanbul region water supply and sewerage
system. Istanbul is the largest city in
Turkey and its population of 1,600,000 is
double that of 25 years ago. Basic
services of water and sewage have been
unable to keep up with a rapidly expanding
demand. Over $1,250,000 has been alloÂ¬
cated from U.N. Development Programme
funds for the project, scheduled for
completion in 1968.
Improving crops
in the Mekong Delta
New types of crops would be grown in
four Cambodian and ten Vietnamese provÂ¬
inces following the construction of a
proposed barrage across the Tonle Sap
tributary of the Mekong River in CamboÂ¬
dia, according to a recent report based
on the Mekong River Delta Model Study,
being made by Unesco with assistance
from the U.N. Development Programme. By
regularizing the flow of irrigation water,
such crops as maize, cotton and tobacco
could be added to the region's staple crop
of rice. In this Unesco-U.N. study an
electronic computer is being used to
analyse the hydrological and hydraulic charÂ¬
acteristics of the Mekong Delta from
Chlong to the Gulf of Thailand and the
South China Sea, as well as those of the
entire Tonle Sap and Great Lake Basins.
'The school under a tree'
"The school under a tree" Is the name
given to the literacy campaign that now
covers the whole territory of Cameroon.
Over 1,700 literacy centres have been set
up, attended by over 75,000 people. Two
booklets on this four-year campaign have
been published, and a monthly journal and
weekly broadcasts report its progress.
Television for another
African country
The Democratic Republic of the Congo's
first television transmitter began operating
in Kinshasa, the capital, on November 23.

Technical aid in setting up the service was
given by the French state Office de CooÂ¬
pÃ©ration Radiophohlque, which also trained
a team of Congolese technicians to run
the transmitter.
Library without books
For years past, long lines of students
have formed almost every day outside the
Hibiya Library in downtown Tokyo. They
are- not interested in the library's books;
they bring their own. They are merely
looking for a quiet place to study. Some
of the pressure may now be taken off the
Hibiya Library with the opening of a study
room in a building that formerly housed
an Education Research Institute. ReportÂ¬
ing the opening of this "library without
books", the Japan Times Weekly suggests
that the idea might well be copied elseÂ¬
where.
New Unesco art slides
of Austria's medieval murals
The 24th series in Unesco's Art Slides
Collection is devoted to the medieval wall
paintings of Austria. It reproduces fresÂ¬
coes dating from the end of the 11th to
the end of the 13th centuries, which
embellish churches in Carinthia, Styria and
the Eastern Tyrol. The series consists of
30 colour slides mounted in cardboard
frames, with explanatory notes in English,
French and Spanish. Order through PubliÂ¬
cations FilmÃ©es d'Art et d'Histoire, 44 rue

imately $10.00 or equivalent.
Preserving the painted tomb
of Kazanluk
A Unesco commission has studied preÂ¬
servation problems of a unique Thracian
tomb and its mural paintings at Kazanluk,
Bulgaria, and reported on its findings to
Bulgaria's cultural conservation authorities.
The tomb dates from the late 4th or early
3rd century B.C. It is the only tumulus
among the thousands dotting the Thracian
plain that has been found to contain
frescoes which thus constitute a rare
document of the art of that period. The
Unesco Commission, which went to KazanÂ¬
luk at Bulgaria's request comprised speciaÂ¬
lists in physics, chemistry, the history of
art and architecture, archaeology and the
conservation of paintings and monuments.
World's largest publication
lists 500 years
of printed books
Publication of the British Museum's
general catalogue of printed books the
world's largest single publication to date
has just been completed. The catalogue
contains over 4 million entries in 263 large
volumes and covers 500 years from the
start of printing in Britain to 1955. It has
taken nearly seven years to produce, and
has now been delivered to libraries in
40 countries.
Peruvian pre-lnca 'fardo'
presented to Unesco
A Peruvian fardo a mummy seven
centuries old offered to Unesco on its
20th anniversary by the Peruvian GovernÂ¬
ment, was unwrapped recently before
television cameras at the Natural History
Museum in Paris. The fardo had been
discovered at Puruchoco, a pre-lnca site
near Lima, by Professor Arturo Jimenez
Borja, director of Peru's archaeological
site museums. The fardo, believed to be
the first of its kind to arrive in Europe
intact, contained the bones of a young
Indian boy who died in the 13th century,
and a collection of toys, a whip, a catapult,
a spinning top, and clothes made from
delicately woven material. The burial
objects were all in a perfect state of
preservation.
African music on records
The first four discs are on sale of a
Unesco Collection of recordings entitled
"An Anthology of African Music", produced
for the International Music Council by the
International Institute of Comparative Music
Studies and Documentation. The first disc
is devoted to the music of the Dan, a
people living in the Ivory Coast and Liberia.
The second consists of vocal and inÂ¬
strumental music from Rwanda: among
instruments included are drums, table-
zither, vertical flute, musical bow, trumpets,
horn and a kind of fiddle. The third disc
offers a selection of the music of the
Pygmees who inhabit the vast equatorial
forest zone in the south west of the
Central African Republic. The last disc
is devoted to Ethiopia, where the liturgical
music of the Coptic Church has remained
unchanged since the beginning of the
Christian era. (Order from Le Chant du
Monde, 32 Rue Beaujon, Paris 8e; price:

Letters to the Editor
MEMORABLE ANNIVERSARIES
OF 1967
42
Sir,
For two countries 1967 will be a
memorable anniversary year. The
Soviet Union will celebrate the 50th
anniversary of its revolution. My
country, Canada, will commemorate
the centenary of its confederation.
Its most ambitious celebration will be
the Universal and International ExhiÂ¬
bition, Expo 67, held in Montreal.
You thus have an appropriate
occasion to devote two issues, though
not necessarily exclusively, to these
countries.
Expo 67's theme will be "Man and
his World". The time would thus be
ripe for you to open your "window"
on the "world" created for Expo 67
on a complex of mainly man-made
islands in the St. Lawrence River.
Open it, in fact, on the Â»whole of
Canada which, as far as I know, is
only mentioned in your excellent
magazine in the context of perpetual
statistics.
Yves Daoust
Masson, Quebec, Canada
ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY
FOR SPACE CREWS
Sir,
Your issue on Man and Space
(May 1966) stated that artificial
gravity would be provided for crews
of future space stations placed in
orbit around the earth. How can this
be done?
Hasslssene Mokhtar
Benjaia, Algeria
One way to protect astronauts from
possible ill effects produced by long
exposure to conditions of weightlessÂ¬
ness would be to spin the space
station on its own orbit. The centriÂ¬
fugal force thus created would produce
the same effect as gravity. Thanks
to this "artificial gravity," astronauts
and unsecured objects would no
longer float freely inside the space
pla tform Edi tor.
NEVER TOO OLD TO LEARN
Sir,
I have on my shelf Volumes I and
II of the Unesco-sponsored History of
Mankind. The immensity of InformaÂ¬
tion in these volumes offers me many
occasions to compose popular lectures
for my old audience here in our Home.
You might think that we do not like
history (80 % of us are over 80), but
you are wrong. We are still full of life.
I myself have "come of age" four
times (21 times 4 equals 84).
My knowledge of languages comÂ¬
prises English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, High Dutch and AfriÂ¬
kaans, and I subscribe to the English
and Spanish editions of the Unesco
Courier.
On reading your wonderful issue on
Unesco's first twenty years (July-
August 1966) I learned that Unesco's
biggest single best-seller is the
Unesco Source Book for Science
Teaching 400,000 copies sold to date
in 22 languages. I do not know what
is in it, but 400,000 readers cannot
go wrong. There must be lots of stuff
to tickle even the oldest fancies and
imaginations.
I cannot put down In adequate
words how rich, how happy I feel NOT
to be illiterate. I am getting a little
stiff already, but still I will plunge into
Science like a retrieving dog into
water.

POEMS OF
JAIME TORRES BODET
Sir,
Your "Bookshelf" (April 1966) lists
works from Unesco's Translations
Series including my own book,
Selected Poems of Jaime Torres
Bodet, which you say is a bilingual
volume of 44 works by the celebrated
Mexican poet and educator. But my
name as the translator and as the
person who wrote the critical introÂ¬
duction is not given. May I ask you
to correct this omission.

ROLL-CALL FOR BAGPIPES
Sir,
I am working on a study of the
gaita (the traditional Instrument of
Galicia. Spain) and its counterparts
elsewhere in Europe. The best known
of these ancient instruments are the
(Majorca), corobout (Brittany), hornÂ¬
pipe (England), zampogna (Abruzzi
and Calabria, Italy), gaida (Bulgaria).
I have been unable to find a biblioÂ¬
graphy on the subject and so I would
be glad to receive information on the
instruments named above and on any
similar ones, particularly their shape,
the materials used to make them,
their ornamentation, tonality and scale,
and how many drones (pipes producÂ¬
ing a fixed continuous note) are fittÂ¬
ed. Photographs and historical and
iconographical data would also be
welcomed as well as details of typical
pieces of "bagpipe music".

ANOTHER MAGIC SQUARE
Sir,
The arrangement of numbers in Alb-
recht DÃ¼rer's "magic square" (UnesÂ¬
co Courier, June 1966) is not the only
one which produces 34 when the numÂ¬
bers are added up by rows, diagonals
or columns. Here Is another one:
16 2 3 13
5 8
1
11 10
12 9 6 7
1 15 14 4
Other features of this version are:
Numbers in the corner squares also
total 34.
Numbers in the top and bottom
squares of each colums always total
17, i.e. half of 34 (16 + 1, 2 +
15, etc.).
Numbers in the inner squares of
each column thus also add up to 17
(5 + 12, 8 + 9, etc.).

STUDENT SERVICE ABROAD
Sir,
I am very glad to endorse the
Unesco Courier. It Is unbiased and
therefore doing good work by giving
fair opinions of the views of different
nations. I was a little disappointed,
however, that no mention was made
of the Canadian University Service
Overseas in the article on youth
organizations (July-August 1965). Of
course it is small compared to the
U.S. Peace Corps. It was formed
before the Peace Corps and
s a private organization. The young
Deople are paid by the country in
which they work. The son of a
"riend of mine is in Ghana and is
giving most of his salary to help the
Doys he teaches to continue their
education.
K.M. Tempest

GREAT AUTHOR OF THE MONTH
Sir,
The article on Natsume Soseki, the
most popular writer in Japan (October
1966); was particularly inspiring.
Why not put aside a page or two in
each issue for an article on a great
writer? I am sure it would be of
great value to all those readers- who,
like me, are perhaps not so well
acquainted with the world's many
great writers

Oh Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls
Are level with the waters, there shall be
A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,
A loud lament along the sweeping sea!

VENICE'S SUNKEN HALLS
Floods, caused by a tidal surge in the northern Adriatic lashed by violent gales, invaded
Venice in November 1966, damaging and defacing monuments and historic buildings. The
buildings in Venice stand on piles driven into the bed of an Adriatic lagoon, and the city is
slowly sinking, dragged down by subsidence of the lagoon bed. The recent floods the
worst for 200 years reveal the vulnerability of this ancient island city and the urgent
need for protective action. Here, tidal waters beat against the columns of the Doge's palace.
