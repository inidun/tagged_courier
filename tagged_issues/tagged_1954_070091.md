T is a brave man who attempts to "define" art.
though countless thinkers and artists have spoken and
written about its nature and its mystery. Mankind's
craving for art is so fundamental that it has existed
continuously since pre-historic days. All that we
know of early man, except what may be gleaned from
his bones, is learned from his crafts and arts. These
reveal man's constant urge to add something beyond
pure utility to his tools to give them aesthetic form,
and to adorn and decorate them.
Art may mean different things to different peojile.
To Aristotle it suggested the formulation of an aesthetic
theory; to Spengler the reflection of a civilization.
Tolstoy called it "an outcry for communion between
men." The French thinker, Elie Faure, once went so
far as to say that "art is not simply useful; after bread,
it is the only really useful thing there is."
Whether art is "useful" or simply a source of great
enjoyment is unimportant here. The enjoyment or
appreciation of art, however, is something like fashion:
it can change with lime and place. But the avenues
are open to all. Some require no training whatever,
others demand previous experience or knowledge, or
both. But the richest satisfaction will come to those
who have the closest contact with art.
Unesco has set itself the mission of increasing the
number of these contacts on the postulate that the arts
are' meant for everyone and that no obstacle, either
economic, social or political, should prevent their
diffusion. Its goal is to help make the art of each
nation belter known and appreciated by ils own people
and by the peoples of other lands, and through this
greater appreciation and knowledge to encourage
international understanding and respect for other
notions and their cultures. Unesco co-operates with
governments in the protection of works of art: it
supports artists, critics and scholars in their endeavours
to achieve international co-operation and mutual" aid,
and helps in the defence of their professional interests.
An International Society for Education through Art
was created in 1953 under Unesco's auspices to improve
methods of leaching the arts in schools and to promote
the appreciation of art by the general public. In the
past five years Unesco has been arranging travelling
exhibitions of reproductions of great works of art to
make these masterpieces available to a wide public not
only in capital cities but in small towns, village halls,
schools and local museums in countries throughout the
world,
Unesco has encouraged private publishers to raise
the standard of colour reproductions, and every two
years issues two catalogues of the best reproductions
now available. In 1954, the "Unesco World Art
Series" was launched to bring within the reach of
artists, teachers, students and Ihe wide art-loving public
the finest quality colour reproductions of masterpieces
of art which hitherto have been known only to a
limited few. Each volume in this collection K

This issue of the unesco
courier presents examples in
colour and in black and white
of the art of Norway, India,
Egypt, Australia and YugoslaÂ¬

Unesco art series. An unbridgeÂ¬
able gulf may appear at first
to separate the tombs of ancient

of Australia from the medieval

of these from the Doddhisatvas

unity: they are part of man's

They bring out not only the
artistic traditions of the past
but make vivid the life of those
far-ofT limes. In all these
works, history becomes human
and living and is not merely a
record of some distant age

### Norway: suffering and triumph in wood
Triumph in Wood
Norway's Stavkirker (stave churÂ¬
ches) are medieval masterpieces
in wood which never fail to
surprise visitors from abroad.
These all-wood churches take their
name from the staves massive
upright timbers which are a basic
part of their construction.
But what really impresses the newÂ¬
comer to the Norwegian scene is the
strong resemblance these churches
bear to giant trees. The "stave
church", wrote Anders Bugge, a NorÂ¬
wegian art specialist,* "stands rooted
in the floor of the valley, with all the
majestic isolation of a huge fir, with
the dragon head carvings reaching out
like branches and the spire, to crown
all, pointing to the sky, while weatherÂ¬
ed shingle, like layers of branches one
above the other, encloses the holy
shrine."
Built entirely of wood and having a
form so suggestive of a tree, the stave
churches could serve as a symbol of
Norway itself, with its vast pine and
spruce forests. Wood is available
there in almost unlimited quantities
and has always been a widely used
building material one which NorÂ¬
wegians have always known how to
treat with the virtuosity of master
craftsmen, in their architecture and
carvings.
There was once a particular examÂ¬
ple of Norwegian wood carving which
the rest of Europe came to know
and to fear in early medieval
times. This was the drakkar, the
carved dragon's head prow on the
ships of the Vikings who set out from
the Scandinavian lands Norway,
Sweden and Denmark and learned
to penetrate all the greater waterways
of Europe well before the end of the
9th century A.D.
Well organized and equipped, these
Vikings raided England, Ireland,

is characteristic of similar works of this period. Suffering is always controlled,
joys always subdued. (Oslo University Museum of Antiquities.)

-France, Germany and Frisia. Their
long, lean ships swept down to Spain
and even as far as North Africa. And
these expeditions were only prelimiÂ¬
nary to wider voyages through which
at last even the New World became
known for a time to men of ScandiÂ¬
navian birth.
The Vikings sailed up rivers and
attacked cities; they occupied lands
and established settlements. So great
was their prowess as warriors that a
special prayer"From the fury of the
Norsemen, Good Lord, deliver us" was
inserted in some of the litanies of the
countries of the West.
monsters
It was difficult to reÂ¬
sist the onslaughts of
these sea-going warÂ¬
riors. They were raidÂ¬
ers who sailed out in
quest of glory, who
made a fetish of courÂ¬
age and who disdainÂ¬
ed death because their
Valhalla only prolongÂ¬
ed the hotblooded life
of a Viking hero.
They even took poets
with them in their
vessels to write the
sagas of their wars.
A Europe imbued with
its Roman heritage met
the civilization of an
unknown land. Though
the clash was violent,
both Norwegians and
Western Europeans
alike profited by it.
The Vikings and their 3
ships terrified entire
peoples and left the bitterness of sack
and pillage in their wake, but they
also brought the first Norwegian conÂ¬
tribution to European culture.
It was a contribution of craftsmanÂ¬
ship in the form of jewellery, golden
spurs and arms inlaid with silver, for
the Vikings looked upon their smiths
as artists practising a noble profesÂ¬
sion. And literature was enriched by
the sagas and legends from the
northern lands.
This sudden expansion of the VikÂ¬
ings into other parts of Europe also
had its counterflow, especially follow
ing the introduction of Christianity
into Norway around 1 000 A.D. when
King Olav (St Olav) was working for
a united and Christian country. The
new religion brought with it the eleÂ¬
ments of an ancient civilization until
then unknown in Norway.
Medieval art in Norway, therefore,
was influenced by the opposing curÂ¬
rents of national and foreign trends,
of old traditions and new ideas. And
we could hardly find a better examÂ¬
ple of this struggle than the stave
churches. These have been called
translations of Gothic churches into
wood. As it happens they were preÂ¬
cursors of Gothic in several techniÂ¬
cal aspects, and even if there was
an element of "translation" involved,
the churches are nevertheless true
examples of a national art.
Their general form of construction
may have come from abroad but it
was adapted to the character of the
country and conceived and executed
with traditional techniques and maÂ¬
terials to harmonize perfectly with
the country's established customs
and ideas. What was basically new in
the churches was the introduction of
figure painting and sculpture, which
had not previously been practised in
Norway despite the great wood-working
skill of the people.
It is not surprising that the stave
churches are so little-known in other
countries, for they were only "discoÂ¬
vered" by the Norwegians themselves
in 1826 when Professor J. C. Dahl, a

painter and teacher at the Fine Arts
Academy in Dresden, returned to his
native country after a long absence
and was struck by their beauty and
masterly craftsmanship.
He told of his enthusiasm in a pubÂ¬
lication which he entitled in German:
Denkmale einer seher ausgebildeten
Holzbaukunst aus den frÃ¼hesten JahrÂ¬
hunderten in den inneren landschaf-
ten Norwegens. This long and desÂ¬
criptive title expressed exactly what
Dahl had discovered in his travels
monuments of a highly perfected arÂ¬
chitecture in wood, the heritage of
early centuries, discovered in outlying
areas of Norway.
But it so happened that 1826 was
the time of Romanticism, and the
"scale covered monsters" (a contemÂ¬
porary term for the stave churches)
were unappreciated. Dragon heads
reared up from the gables of these
churches, the same dragon heads
which had witnessed the heroic past
of Norway from the prows of Viking
ships, and the same monsters who
proudly raised their necks above the
first stone churches in 1300.
Unfortunately, Dahl's discovery
came somewhat late. Through indif-

ference or incomprehension, a good
many of the stave churches which had
weathered the years and remained in
excellent condition had nevertheless
been demolished. Between the 11th
and 12th centuries, more than 1,000
staves churches were constructed, but
today- only a handful remain.
Later stone churches appear ausÂ¬
tere alongside these wood structures
with their elaborate interlaced carved
motifs of slender serpents entangled
in ferocious battles as they were on
the bows of the Viking ships. Another
motif, the acanthus leaf, only made
its appearance in the 12th century,
borrowed from the holy books brought
by English missionaries. Though of
foreign origin, this motif was incorÂ¬
porated into the animalistic style, and
it fitted into the rhythm and the
aggressiveness inherited from the heÂ¬
roic days of the Norsemen, and beÂ¬
came an element in a purely Nordic
style.
This animalistic
style is the very
essence of traditionÂ¬
al Norwegian art.
Its origin goes back
to the era when
men engraved the
image of the stag
on the walls of
their cave homes.
The Norwegian artÂ¬
ist found inspiration
in mountains, in
forests and in waterÂ¬
falls. He was representative of a
warlike people battling cold and darkÂ¬
ness, but whose art was softened by
the magic half-light of summer nights
in the Far North. When Christianity
arrived the animals of a pagan faith
were not forgotten as artists carved
works to the glory of a new divinity.
Writing of Borgund, the most repreÂ¬
sentative of existing stave churches,
Anders Bugge evokes the atmosphere
which must have existed in those far-
off days :

and from small apertures placed high

above in the walls of the raised midÂ¬
dle section, the daylight filters in fitÂ¬
fully, filling the space beneath the
lofty arched rafters with a chiarosÂ¬
curo, bright enough for us to see with
surprising clarity. This half-light must
have increased the effect of the glitÂ¬
ter from the candles on the altar,
which in the Middle Ages could be
glimpsed through a choir opening
much narrower than the present one.
The flickering light glancing over the
rich vestments of the clergy and the
gleam of holy vessels, must have
provided an enchanting and dazzling
setting for the solemn service enacted
in the choir within."
Authorities consider that NorweÂ¬
gian medieval art reached its flowerÂ¬
ing under the reign of
King Haakon Haak-
onsson (1204-1263). But
by 1349, the year of
the "Black Death" this ,
rich era came to an
end. Some books speak
of a "decadence" in
the period that followÂ¬
ed, but it was only a
relative one, for the
old native themes were
taken up by secular
art and gave birth to
new masterpieces. ToÂ¬
day these old themes
continue to inspire new
generations of NorÂ¬
wegian artists.
For centuries, Nor- Â¡
way's wooden churches i
have braved the
assaults of wind and
weather. We begin to
understand why, when
we read an account left
by Professor Lorentz
Dietrichson who lived
from 1834 to 1917.
He wrote: "Up in the
mountains the weather
was clear. The sun set
the tufts of heather
aglow and the morning
air was vibrating with
light as I entered the
shadow of the old stave
church to take meaÂ¬
surements and to make
notes. But during the
morning the weather
changed and a storm
broke suddenly outside.
"The walls of the old
church creaked as if
they were ready to
cave in. It seemed as
if each plank was
about to tear lose from
its place, break away
from its fixed frame of
pillars and beams and bring down
everything under the shaking columns.
The entire building seemed to be
oscillating and, in fact, it was.
"But little by little the creakings
seemed to become more regular and
rhythmical. Despite the howling of
the storm growing even stronger, the
noise around me diminished it was as
if the planks had slipped back into
their grooves. The entire building
regained its equilibrium and its calm.
"Although the storm, instead of
abating, became even more violent, I
soon heard neither the slightest noise
nor the least creaking from the walls
of the stave church. The entire buildÂ¬
ing had settled: from now on, it would
stand hard and fast in the midst of
the torment around it."
And today, though reduced in numÂ¬
ber through man's indifference, the
stave churches of Norway stand as
firm to meet future storms as they
have since the day when master arÂ¬
chitects and craftsmen first conÂ¬
structed them.
To reveal to art lovers throughout
the world these masterpieces of NorÂ¬
dic art a volume entirely devoted to
them is to be published early in 1955
in the Unesco World Art series. It
will contain many reproductions in
colour of the superb wall and altar
paintings, as well as black and white
illustrations showing the unique archiÂ¬
tectural character of these buildings.

### India: the lonely grandeur of Ajanta
INDU
The lonely grandeur
of Ajanta
By
Francis
Brunei
Ajanta's twenty-nine rock-hewn shrines and sanctuaries are shown in
this general plan. They were numbered from West to East by the
archaeological service responsible for their conservation. Cave XIV
is situated directly above Cave XIII, and has not been represented.
O
ne day, over 2,000 years
ago a group of Buddhist
teachers and their disÂ¬
ciples, searching for a
place to set up a spiritual reÂ¬
treat in a secluded part of
western India, came across a
deep, semi-circular gorge surÂ¬
rounded by overhanging cliffs.
On the flank of the southern cliff face they discovered
caves which from distant times had probably been the
dwellings of hermits. All around was the jungle in its
coat of verdure, bright with its flowers and contrasting
with the warmly tinted rock of the mountain. Below, a
torrent the source of the river Waghora cascaded
through the rocks.
In its harsh and lonely grandeur, the site seemed an
ideal one to these men searching for solitude and tranÂ¬
quility. They saw from the rock formations that the
caves could be enlarged, and arranged as living quarters
and places for meditation. So they set about transforming
them.
The news of the Buddhist monk's arrival and their setÂ¬
tlement in this secluded valley, soon spread throughout the
surrounding countryside. People in search of knowledge,
work or mysteries came to visit them and stayed to. help
them in their enterprise, as a few weatherbeaten inscripÂ¬
tions in old Sanskrit still bear witness. In the tenth shrine
10
is written : "The gift of a doorfront by Basathiputa"; in
the sixteenth monastery, "Salutation first to the renowned
Buddha, who dispels the intense fire of misery from this
world, a King" ; and in the twelfth monastery, "The meriÂ¬
torious gift of a dwelling with cells and hall by the merÂ¬
chant Ghanamadada.".
Little by little this spiritual retreat became a small
university, where Buddha's teachings, philosophy, ethics,
the traditional sciences, and techniques like art, could be
studied and practised. One of the world's centres of
learning had been born.
Faith and enthusiasm fed the efforts of a multitude of
monks, artisans, artists and students who, through the
centuries, hewed and chipped away the mountain rock.
Inspired by a common purpose, they filled the peaceful
valley with the sound of their hammers and chisels. The
first shrines and monasteries took shape, were decorated
and painted. Ajanta, as the place was called, became a
pilgrimage centre as well as a home of learning.
From the 2nd century B.C. until the 7th century A.D.,
a whole series of monasteries and temples Was hewn out
of the solid rock at different levels along the cliff, and
these were linked with each other by narrow paths and
many steep stairways. Finally, they were large enough
to shelter hundreds of monks, students, visitors, or beneÂ¬
factors.
In the daily life of these monastery dwellers study and

meditation alternated \vith physical exercises and manual
and artistic occupations, inspired by the serene and peaceÂ¬
ful Buddhist doctrine. And from their high-perched stone
verandahs, the monks could look out on a scene of wild
and magnificent natural beauty, enhanced by the torrent
twisting through its seven cascades at their feet.
The approximate periods of the Ajanta community's
development have been fixed by a comparative study of
architectural styles, sculpture and paintings, which show
two main periods of expansion. The first of these is
identified with a group of two shrines (IX and X) and five
monasteries (VII, V11I, XI, XII, and XIII), which were
constructed between the 2nd century B.C. and the 2nd
century A.D. The second period followed some centuries
later, and it -is thought to have ended towards the beginÂ¬
ning of the 7th century.
The gap between these two periods was probably due
to the division of Buddhism into two streams when
the conception of Ilinayana was being challenged by
Mahayana, which saw in Buddha not a mere teacher but
a being, eternal and divine, Who came to sojourn among
men. Some of the temple monasteries were never
completed either because the rock resisted further work
or for other, unknown reasons.
It is difficult for anyone who has not actually seen these
temples hewn from the.mountain to imagine their grandeur,
which becomes still more amazing when we realize all
the difficulties which had to be overcome by those who
built them. In the largest and oldest shrine (No. X), the
main hall is 95 feet long, 41 "feet wide and 30 feet high.
The central hall of monastery No. XVI is 03 feet in length,
05 feet in breadth and 15 feet in height. These monastery
temples are among the earliest rock-cut remains in India ;
and in their monumental galleries the whole of India's
ancient life can be seen anew, With its scenes, settings
and atmosphere preserved for us in an artistic description
of extraordinary variety and quality.
The caves are of two main types the Chaityas, shrines
or meeting-places, in the form of an apse (semi-circular in
shape) and the Viharas, four-sided monasteries or living
caves.
. The Chaityas have a monumental portico, and the
vaulting is supported on both sides by massive colonnades,
flanked by secondary side-aisles. The style of these
shrines seems to be inspired from wooden structures of
the secular communities mentioned in early Buddhist
literature. In the "choir", is a slupa a kind of symbolic
dome serving also as a reliquary. In later years these
slupas were adorned with effigies of Buddha.
The Vihara are the cave monasteries, with a verandah
in front of a square hall, cells provided with stone beds
on three sides and one or more minor shrines. Sturdy
pillars support the roof and the vaulting ; the faÃ§ades are
adorned with columns hewn from the rock which, by its
overhang, forms a protection for them.

### India: the lonely grandeur of Ajanta
INDIA
(Continued) Early Buddhism on a ' magic carpet'
A walk round
these many-levelled
temples is like a
journey "by magic
c a rp e t" to the
ancient world
of early Buddhist
times. Wonderful
decorations, sculpÂ¬
ture, bas-reliefs and
paintings cover the
walls, columns and
roofs and reveal the
full splendour of a
supreme "moment"
in Art one of its
"golden ages".
The sure techniÂ¬
que and undoubted
mastery of these art forms are evident as far back as the
2nd century B.C. They have a remarkable freshness and
a complete absence of rigidity. Their easy-flowing lines
caress, emphasize or enliven the forms and figures. Their
refined style and the flexibility in the composition of the
captivating crowds and groups, whether in movement or
in repose, is remarkable. A whole
range of nuances is displayed in the
isolated figures, full of strange ma
jesty or tenderness, grandeur or abanÂ¬
don, meditation or compassion, yet
always vibrant with life.
Alongside the tangible world of
people and objects, the other, the one
of feeling and thought, is also admiÂ¬
rably expressed with a powerful force
of suggestion. And.even though the
artists' main concern is with the life
and message of Buddha, it is life as
a whole that is portrayed.
"Human life", says the introduction
to the Unesco Volume on Ajanta, "in
the crowded drama of love, compasÂ¬
sion, happiness, yearning, death, sufÂ¬
fering and sacrifice, is illuminated by
a glow of religious feeling dominated
by a sense of transience of existence
and profound piety."
All this, found in the frescoes, is
perhaps the secret of their creators.
At one juncture an atmosphere of intense fervour, of
religious feeling and love is created in these soberly or
sumptuously sculptured shrines; at another, the religious
subjects come to life and the love scenes are filled with
spirituality. At one moment, vast scenes show the preÂ¬
tentiousness of official events caparisoned elephants,
knights on prancing mounts, princes or princesses bedeckÂ¬
ed with jewels and surrounded by the flowing concourse
of their subjects, hunting scenes', the capture of wild eleÂ¬
phants, legends like the landing nf King Bijaya in Ceylon,
processions and offerings.
At other times, intimate family scenes are depicted
lovers embracing beneath pavilions supported by red and
blue lacquer^ columns, or beside richly coloured beds of
flowers ; a princess at her toilette, musicians and dancers
preparing to entertain ; groups of lightly or barely clad
women revealing a charming beauty of human form ;
children playing by their mother's side, with their favourÂ¬
ite birds or animals.
In these life-like frescoes of living beings the artists
have given free rein to their inclinations in portraying
the human body, feminine slenderness, in particular,
being one of their favourite themes. The modelling, the
contrast of flesh-tints, the airy lightness of_ celestial beings
such as Indra, God of the Heavens, with his escort of
14
nymphs all are expressed with thÃ© same intense interest.
What is the explanation for a choice of subjects that
seem "profane" and apparently so far removed from the
cloistered life of the seeker after wisdom ? It is perhaps
because the Master, when confronted with the many
aspects of life and desire, and having renounced all, had
said : "Passing beyond the forms of beauty, ye may find
beauty itself."
This is one of the outstanding features of an art which
is steeped in humanity, and in which design, colour, form
and composition were simply artistic elements of a
spiritual inspiration underlying all of it. It is a truly
Indian tradition, found as long ago as we are able to go
back, that the divine is not separated from the human,
nor the spirit from the body. For he who has been freed,
the body is a "garden of delight"; no longer the slave
of the senses it remains calm and detached.
When Buddha's disciple Ananda asked him whether
friendship, association, and intimacy with the beautiful
were not half of the holy life, the Master replied: "Say not
so, Ananda, it is the whole, not the half of the holy life."
Inspired by this principle, disciples and teachers, artisans,
sculptors and painters, have tried to convey a better
understanding of Buddha's message of love and compasÂ¬
sion for every living thing, and of
universal peace. They have left the
world this moving testimony of their
research and their discovery.
, After being forsaken and neglected
for centuries, and -despite the damage
or destruction of so many of its paintÂ¬
ings by weather, swarms of wild bees,
insects, birds, bats and even by human
hands, Ajanta still remains an outÂ¬
standing treasure trove of Indian art
from the 3rd century B.C. to the 7th
century A.D. a joyous and serene art.
Every evening, the last rays of the
setting sun penetrate for a few
moments into these places of meditaÂ¬
tion. As they light up the faces in the
frescoes and sculptures, one by one,
they invest these achievements of
bygone times with new life. In the
shrine of the Vihara XI the shafts of
sunlight bring a sudden divine ecstasy
to the face of Buddha as he sits upon
his throne with, at his feet, a kneeling
man, and on each side, two lions lying peaceably with two
deer. In the presence of the splendours at Ajanta, the
words of Buddha take on their full meaning: "DiscovÂ¬
ering the life that is in himself, everywhere and in
everything, the wise man embraces the whole wbrld in
one feeling of peace, compassion and limitless love."
"Be ye kind
all that liveth."

"Be ye the heirs
of truth."

An art on bark and stone
The aborigines of
Australia still
practise an art
comparable with
that of our stone age
ancestors of Europe. This
art permeates all aspects
of the aborigines' life. It is
the vital medium through
which they keep alive
their philosophies, laws and the stories of their creation.
Throughout southern and central Australia, this art is
remarkably simple and abstract, consisting almost entirely
of spirals, concentric circles, wavy and straight lines. In
other parts of the continent, however, the art tends to
become representational. In the Ilawkesbury Biver basin
of New South Wales, the natives engraved, on the flat
rocks, outlines of huge men, animals, birds and fish, some
of them reaching a length of sixty feet. Because the
meanings and the underlying myths of these engravings
were not collected whilst the aborigines who produced
them were still living, that knowledge is lost forever.
In North-eastern Australia, on the opposite side of the
continent, the art of the caves is dominated by large
anthropomorphic figures with halolike ornaments known
as the Wandjina. These paintings are associated with the
ceremonies of rainmaking, spirit children and the increase
of food.
In Arnhem Land, Northern Australia, aboriginal art has
developed in some of .its most interesting forms. The
volume published in the "Unesco World Art Series" deals
with the rich and varied art forms of the cave and bark
paintings found within the boundaries of that remote land.

mg or throwing spears and women
carrying their food vessels. These
single-line monochromatic drawings
have a sense of movement entirely
lacking in the polychrome paintings.
The aborigines believe that these
drawings most of them less than
half a metre high are the work, not
.of their own kind, but of a tall
thinbodied fairy people known as the
Mimis, who live in the rocky plateau.
No one has seen a Mimi, though
they collect food and hunt in the same
way as the* aborigines, for the Mimis
are a shy people, particularly keen of
hearing, who, at the faintest sound of
an intruder, run to a cleft.in the rocks
of the plateau and blow upon it.
The cleft opens, admits the Mimis to
their underground home, then closes
behind them to keep out all intruders.
The belief in the Mimi artists is, it
vvould seem, a rationalisation on the
part of the aborigines to explain
an ancient art form which they
themselves do not practise.
Although most of the cave paintings
belong to an age not yet defined, few
of the bark paintings of Arnhem
Land could be more than a year old
when collected. The bark sheets,
the walls of the wet-weather shelters,
on which the men paint their designs
during the enforced idleness of the
monsoon season are generally desÂ¬
troyed by bush-fires, the elements
and insects in less than a year.
The bark paintings illustrated in
the Unesco volume are from five
localities in Arnhem Land, Oenpelli
in the west, Goulburn Island and
Milingimbi on the north coast, Yirr-
kalla at the north-eastern corner and
GroÃ³te Eyelandt in the Gulf of CarÂ¬
pentaria.
Arnhem Land aborigines are
divided into different clans, each
clan having its own particular totem,
with its attendant songs, ceremonies
and designs. These clans, and their
territories, were determined by the
mythical creators who lived during
the early days of the world, and the
myths which describe the exploits
and adventures of those creators and
which are, in essence, the philosophy
of the aborigines, explain how they
made the firmament, the world
beneath, and the creatures upon il.
Two of these creators, the Djunkgan
Sisters, occupy an important pla<Â¿e in
the beliefs- of the aborigines of
Northern Arnhem Land. Corning
from some place near Hie sunrise, the
mythical women landed on the shores
of the Gulf of Carpentaria and,
travelling westward, named all the
clan territories, the animals and tin-
plants in their path. Certain bark
paintings, high totems of the Narra
ceremonies of the Djunkgao Sisters,
illustrate incidents of that journey.
On a plain south of Milingimbi, the
sisters wishing to create wells of fresh
water, pushed their digging sticks into
the ground at p. number of places.
As the water gushed out, they named
each well, decreed the design and
chanted the song that would, forever
altcrwards, be associated with them.

KANGAROO HUNTERSmen and womenand their quarry are
depicted in painting, above, from Unbalanya Hill. Below, mangrove

The discs on the bark painting
indicate those wells, the intersecting
lines, the path made by the Djunkgao
Sisters as they walked from one place
to another, and the cross-hatched
areas, the open plain.
The basic art of Arnhem Land, of
which the bark paintings of GroÃ³te
Eylandt are typical, consists of single
or grouped figures on a plain ground.
This arrangement is used over most
of the area, extending southward
until it reaches the simple abstract
designs of Central Australia, and
northward, until it is absorbed by the
more complex symbolism of the north
coast. Toward the west, however,
the paintings, though still retaining
their basic characteristics, are moÂ¬
dified by the curious X-ray art.
Within a limited area on the north
and north-eastern coast of Arnhem
Land, the range of designs becomes
wider and the figures more complex,
and the ground, instead of being
plain, is filled in with cross-hatchings
of various colours.
The material and tools used by the
artists of Arnhem Land could hardly
be simpler. The painting surfaces
are either the inside of a sheet of bark
stripped from a eucalyptus tree, or
the walls and ceilings of caves. The
colours are black, red, yellow and
white pigments ground to a thin paste
on a flat stone. The fixative is the
18
sap of a bruised orchid bulb, rubbed
directly on the painting surface. The
brushes, too, are no more than strips
of chewed bark for the broader lines,
thin sticks for making dots and a
single feather or strands of palm leaf
for cross-hatching and finer details.
When watching the artists at work
one is impressed with their sureness;
each man appears to have a complete
mental image -of his picture before he
begins ; he seldom alters his design
or even corrects a brush stroke.
Many of the bark and cave
paintings have- no ceremonial or
religious function, but are produced
tor pure pleasure of creative effort, a
pleasure which stimulates the true
artist in all cultures.
There are paintings, both on bark
and in caves, which have more imÂ¬
portant functions. In the initiation
rituals, secret designs, painted on
sheets of bark-, instruct the novitiates
in the esoteric myths of the tribe.
Although the culture of the- aboriÂ¬
ginal artist is vastly different from
that of our own, the subject of his
painting beyond the realms of our
knowledge, his symbolism unlike
anything we possess and his maÂ¬
terials and colours extremely limited,
he uses the same principles of line,
colour, balance, and spacing of design
elements present in all great art.

Scenes of a happy after-life
The Egyptians were not only
architects, sculptors and
craftsmen of genius; they were
also painters who were aware from the
beginning of the extent to which a
drawing or a carving in relief could be
improved by colour. The artists of the
Nile Valley made use of colour in every
field of art even in goldsmith's work,
where pigments were replaced by semiÂ¬
precious stones or fragments of
coloured glass. Statues and archiÂ¬
tectural motifs, too, were painted. In
speaking of painting, however, it is
natural to confine oneself to the bright-
coloured scenes which decorate the

Antiquities, Louvre Museum, Paris.
walls of Egyptian temples and tombs.
Even this comparatively narrow field
offers countless examples.
The majority of scenes depicted in
the tombs, and an even greater
proportion of those shown in the
temples, were carved either in relief
or in hollow relief before being
coloured; but wall painting was also
used at all periods in the decoration
of tombs. Under the New Empire (1),
in the famous necropolis, at Thebes,
capital of the Empire, this process
predominated. It is from this necroÂ¬
polis that most of the illustrations in
the Unesco Album Egypt: Paintings
from Tombs and Temples are drawn.
It was not, however, a considered
preference, but resulted from technical
necessity, since the rock was of poor
quality and unsuitable for carving; so

faulty was it that it had to be primed
before it would hold the colour.
The background colour of these
paintings varies. Under the XVIIIth
Dynasty, the most flourishing period,
it was usually white or blue-grey; the
same colours are found at a later
epoch, but light or dark beige and
yellow become increasingly frequent.
Apart from black and white, the
Egyptians used only four colours
yellow, red, blue and green which
could, of course, be mixed if desired.
The scenes, which were drawn and-,
corrected before being painted, were
aligned in horizontal bands across the
walls, and covered them completely,
save for a decorative frieze at the top
and a series of strips in different
colours forming a kind of skirting-
board below.
Egyptian drawings are governed by
a number of conventions which often
disturb the uninitiated, though speÂ¬
cialists, through familiarity, hardly
notice them. To begin with, although
the Egyptians knew perfectly well how
to show a subject .full face if they
wished, they could seldom bring
themselves to do so in wall paintings,
where they no doubt wished to abide
by a particular concept of graphic art.
They seem to have felt that the profile
was more typical of- the individual than
the full face. The details of the profile
are depicted realistically, except for
the eyes, which are shown more or less
as though seen from the front.
Complications did not arise except
where the whole body was shown.
The aim of the artists was to reÂ¬
produce the different parts of the body
as fully as possible. To have drawn
the shoulders in profile would have
meant concealing, or almost concealing,
one arm; so it "may be concluded
despite a very few exceptions that the
Egyptians thought it essential to give
a front view of the shoulders, at any
rate in the case of a motionless figure.
When the subject is seen in action,
the position of the .shoulders varies,
within certain limits, according to the
nature of the movement. We are
given a side view of the bust and a
three-quarter view of the abdomen, the
navel being always visible. The legs
and feet are invariably shown in
profile; male figures, when in repose,
have the left foot forward, whereas the
females are shown with the legs
pressed together though in this latter
case the artist always contrives to show
the line of the leg which should be
hidden, slightly in front of the visible
leg. These rules cease to apply, of
course, when the body is in motion.
On first thought, it might seem
difficult to achieve a successful comÂ¬
position in this way; but without
departing from these conventions the
Egyptians succeeded, owing to their
restraint and their feeling for sty-

lization, in presenting figures which
are elegant, well-proportioned, and
almost natural in appearance.
At the beginning of the Old KingÂ¬
dom, the scenes themselves were very
simple. With a few exceptions, the
best known of which are in the
Meidum necropolis, in northern Egypt,
the only portion to be decorated was
the stele used to simulate
the door separating the
world of the living from
that of the dead. Later, it
became customary to depict
figures bearing offerings on
the wall surrounding this
supposed .door; and finally,
from the Vth Dynasty onÂ¬
wards, in the Mastaba tombs
of important officials, the
chapel walls were entirely
covered with illustrations.
This type of decoration
originated in a belief, which
persisted until the end of
the XVIIIth Dynasty, that
the after-life was modelled
on life in this world, that the '
dead had the same desires
and needs as the living. It Â¡
is not a matter for surprise,
therefore, to find, on the
walls of the tombs, side by
side with illustrations of the
various funeral rites, secular scenes
which have provided us with a great
deal of valuable information about the
daily life of the ancient Egyptians.
Food naturally takes a very imÂ¬
portant place, and the artists never
tire of showing the dead man alone
or with his wife seated at a table
spread with various dishes and reÂ¬
ceiving servants who bring him
offerings and even, in some cases, live
animals. Poultry also seems to have
been highly appreciated and it is not
unusual to find butchers cutting up a
bullock. Amusements are also inÂ¬
cluded, and the meal is often enlivened
by music and dancing. Moreover, a
prince is represented as still addicted,
in the other world, to the pleasures of
hunting and fishing, and as faithful to
all the obligations of his' earthly life.
Under the Old Kingdom, however, nÃ¶
allusion is ever made to the official
career of a dead man, but only to the
existence he led in his immense estates
in the Nile Delta probably because on
his own land he could really regard
himself as absolute master.
It was for him, and for him alone,
that the peasants laboured, that the
shepherds tended their flocks, and the
barges threaded their way through the

marshy channels. Craftsmen, too, are
often shown at work.
All these scenes continued beyond
the Old Kingdom, and are still found
in the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty.
At this period, however, a great change
took place, and the official aspect of
the dead man's existence is regularly
illustrated, side by side with more
pleasurable scenes taken over from
previous epochs. The master is still
fond of gliding along in a boat, past
thickets of papyrus, and hurling his
boomerang at unsuspecting birds.
When he tires of hunting he takes his
harpoon and turns to spearing the fish
in the Nile.
By this time life had become less
harsh. To the offerings customary in
earlier periods have been added fruits
and flowers, arranged with a strong
decorative sense, jewels, and cups of
wine; meals have developed into
banquets the master and his wife ,
receive their guests; charming servant-
girls, almost naked, pour wine, dress
the hair of ladies seated somet'mes on
the ground and sometimes on elegantly-
shaped chairs, or deck them with
jewels.
Another great change took place
under the XlXth Dynasty due, no
doubt, to the religious revolution of
Amarna. Life itself had certainly
not altered but, as a reaction against ,
the exaggerated realism of the Amar- '
nian period, secular scenes were no
longer depicted in the tombs. The
decoration was thus confined almost
entirely to religious and funerary
themes, drawn chiefly from large
mythological compositions illustrating
the ritual of the dead. As a result, it
more closely resembled that of the
royal tombs, for scenes of pleasure had
never been admitted to the mysterious
Valley of Kings, even during the period
when the joy of life provided the
dominant note in the burial-chambers
of private individuals.
The royal tombs, like the temples,
showed a god conferring life, stability
and strength upon the king, or the
goddess Isis spreading her wings
protectively over the dead sovereign, or,
kneeling on the emblem of gold, asking
protection for him from Gheb, the
Earth-god. Others represented the
reigning king, in priestly
vestments, performing the
,rite of "opening the mouth"
of his predecessor (in this
case the celebrated Pharaoh
Tutankhamen) .
The private tombs present
increasingly detailed versions
of the funeral scenes alÂ¬
ready illustrated under the
XVIIIth Dynasty, but now
deliberately stripped of any
secular features; the dead
man's meal, for instance,
is once again a strictly
funeral rite. Many tombs
show the eldest son officiatÂ¬
ing before his parents, the
dead man woshipping Osiris,
or the phoenix, symbol of
the Sun-god of Heliopolis, or
some other god whose proÂ¬
tection might be given him.
In one of the most graceful
of these solemn scenes the
dead man is shown kneeling beside a
palm-tree (see centre page in colour),
drinking the water of the river a
mysterious gesture the significance of
which is not quite clear to us.
All the scenes found in the tombs,
varied as they are, reveal one and the
same concern that of a happy afterÂ¬
life. From the earliest epoch until the
end of the XVIIIth Dynasty, the
attempt was made to beguile fate by
depicting that life as a pleasurable
affair and thus, by means of imitative
magic, to achieve eternal felicity.
From the XlXth Dynasty onwards,
the same purpose was pursued solely by
means of the performance of religious
rites and strict obedience to the divine
decrees. These two concepts are not
incompatible, for both emphasize the
great dread of death which was felt by
the Egyptians, thus bearing out the
opinion of Herodotus, who declared
that of all nations the Egyptians were
the most religious.

### Yugoslavia: frescoes buried under plaster for 500 years
Frescoes buried under plaster for 500 years
I
n the monastery
churches of YuÂ¬
goslavia,- artists
and historians are
today engaged in
one of the great
"treasure hunts" of
art history. The
prizes they seek are
medieval wall paintÂ¬
ings which were
(lost to the world
for 500 years, buried
beneath coats of
whitewash and plasÂ¬
ter applied by the
Ottoman Turks who
overran the Balkans
in the 14th and 15th centuries.
After this time few travellers from
Western Europe journeyed along the
Balkan roads, once main trading
routes and communication highways
between East and West. Those who
did, often stopped to look at the mysÂ¬
teriously beautiful churches and monÂ¬
asteries standing in isolated settings
like monuments to a happier past.
Though they could only see a very
minute part of the vast treasure of
frescoes that really existed, they came
away entranced by the beautiful
things they witnessed.
But it was not until the 19th cenÂ¬
tury, with the removal of a part of
Turkish dominance, that a small echo
of this great hidden wealth began to
reach the outside world, and that it
became possible to undertake a serious
study of Yugoslavia's rich medieval art
which flourished from the 11th to the
14th centuries.
In 1872, an exhibition of Serbian
Byzantine art objects was held in
Moscow. Two years later another was
held in Kiev. Soon foreign archaeoloÂ¬
gists, architects and art historians
began to visit the churches and monÂ¬
asteries of Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia-
Herzgovina and Montenegro, and they
were amazed.
In 1881, a British art historian
named A. Evans caused a sensation
in art circles by publishing a series of
articles on Serbian medieval art. He
claimed that without a knowledge of
the hidden masterpieces in the BalÂ¬
kans one could not really understand
the Renaissance art of Italy, and he
compared the Angel of the ResurrecÂ¬
tion, a delicate fresco produced by a
Serbian artist in the 13th century
Milesevo Abbey, with the best works
by Michelangelo.
By the beginning of the present
century, Yugoslav specialists had
mapped out their first full-scale plans
to investigate all of Yugoslavia's mediÂ¬
eval art, and taken the first steps in
the overwhelming job of uncovering
and restoring their art treasures.
Thus began the great "treasure
hunt" which Yugoslav authorities have
resumed since the end of the last
World War with a vigour unequalled
in the past. As these unknown
treasures have gradually been recoverÂ¬
ed they have opened new landmarks
in the history of European painting
and thrown considerable light on the
development of Byzantine art which
originated in the eastern part of the
Roman Empire when, in 330 A. D., its
first Christian emperor, Constantine,
removed the capital from Rome to the
old Greek city-state of Byzantium, reÂ¬
naming it Constantinople (Now IstanÂ¬
bul). Byzantine Art developed from
Egypt to the Balkans and Russia, and
from Mesopotamia to Italy.
Byzantine art was religious in charÂ¬
acter and served chiefly to depict the
principle figures in the Bible. It
provided visual explanations during
church services, prompting one authoÂ¬
rity to say that it was probably one of
the world's first "picture stories" of the
New and Old Testament. Although

Monastery of Mana-
sija (early I 5th centuÂ¬
ry). Like many others
of that time it was
surrounded by high,
fortress-like walls.
Byzantine art is generally characterized
by a severity and formality of design,
the medieval artists of Yugoslavia
showed remarkable originality in
departing on many occasions from the
rigid stylization of their time. They
instilled in their works elements of
freshness, realism and rhythm. They
portrayed their figures as human
beings, vibrant with life, with indiÂ¬
vidualized faces and "normal" eyes
instead of the usual fixed gaze. In
the 12th century, they gave the art of
the fresco a new direction imparting
to it both greater flexibility and
expressiveness.
This more humanistic approach is
well illustrated by the wall paintings
dating from 1164 found in the little
Macedonian church of Nerezi, near
Skopje, which was built at the same
period as Notre Dame Cathedral in
Paris. Here, in the various scenes of
the Passion the Descent from the
Cross,. the Entombment and the MournÂ¬
ing of the Virgin the Nerezi painters
have captured feeling and emotion,
sadness and compassion with striking
vividness. In the Entombment, for
example, contrary to the ecclesiastic
codes of the time, the Virgin isxseated
with Christ tightly held in her arms,
her face pressed against his head.
This face expresses the supreme sufÂ¬
fering of a mother weeping over her
dead son.
In scenes such as these of death and
suffering, human beings racked by
pain or deeply moved by compassion
have been portrayed with such force
and realism that AndrÃ© Grabar, author
of a profound study on "Byzantine
Painting" and professor of Byzantine

history at the famed College de
France, has described them as "a
landmark in the history of European
painting" and "in advance of all EuroÂ¬
pean paintings of the same period."
The 13th and 14th centuries saw the
development of a definite Serbian
school of fresco painters, the most
notable examples of their work being
found in churches and monasteries at
Milesevo, Sopocani, Gracanica and
Studenica.
Serbian painting probably reached
its greatest height in the 13th century
in the monumental frescoes of the
monastery of Sopocani. The Death of
the Virgin, for example (see reproÂ¬
ductions, page 34) would deserve to be
included in any history of art. The
human qualities which are portrayed,
the feeling of grandiose effect and
the dignity of the draped figures ;
these and the manner in which each
figure is drawn with individual psyÂ¬
chological expressiveness and an
everyday realism, have led one critic
to call it "the most brilliant example
of what 13th century artists achieved
by way of a return to nature."
The oldest frescoes of Yugoslavia are
only now coming to light. They have
been discovered in the picturesque lake
shore town of Ochrida in mountainous
southwest Macedonia. There, on the
walls and vaults of the Church of
Saint Sophia, paintings dating back to
the early 11th century have been .
uncovered during the past four years
which are an artistic discovery of the
first order.
Not only do these frescoes reflect
accurately the various phases in the
construction of the church itself, but
since they are representative of a
broad period
ranging from the
11th to the 14th
century, they
offer something
that is distinctly
Tare a general
view of the deveÂ¬
lopment of ByÂ¬
zantine expresÂ¬
sion through
the course of
several hundreds
of years in a
region that was
of capital imÂ¬
portance in the
evolution of
Byzantine art.
The Church of
St. Sophia of
Ochrida is one of
the most imT
portant and an-
c i e n t religious
buildings surÂ¬
viving in MaceÂ¬
donia. It is remarkable for the deliÂ¬
cately proportioned lines of its archiÂ¬
tecture as well as for its frescoes. Its
graceful two storey galleried arcade,
added in the 14th century, brings to
mind contemporary Venetian buildings.
The church is at least 900 years old
and may have been begun a thousand
years ago, though its exact date of
construction or its founder is not
known.
Age, dampness and neglect, however,
have damaged St. Sophia considerably.
Sometime before the 17th century fire
destroyed a part of the church. The
Ottomans, who had transformed it into
a mosque in 1466, restored the" damaged
portion and rebuilt the roof. But it
was so heavy that it buckled the vaults
Chancel of St Sophia of Ochrida as it appeared
at start of restoration. Most of its frescoes were
still hidden under plaster. Working on high scaffÂ¬
olding, experts patiently removed the coating
from the roof and (as shown on page 39) brought
paintings to light. To remove some paintings
(inset) canvas covered with strong glue was
applied to wall, and painting with backing of thin
plaster was then peeled off, like the skin of an orange.
and pushed out the walls. Later, at
an undetermined date, the vaulting and
cupolas caved in. In 1913, a year after
the end of Ottoman rule, the people of
Ochrida re-roofed the church, again
putting excessive pressure on the
walls.
Various attempts to restore Saint
Sophia were made afterwards, some of
them harmfully bungling. In 1950, an
Historic Monuments Commission of
the People's Republic of Macedonia
(one of the six Federal Republics of
present-day Yugoslavia) made a preliÂ¬
minary study of the damage.
In many places they found the
foundations too weak to hold up the
superstructure, masonry had crumbled
away, beams had rotted, walls and
arches had buckled. The south wall,
containing many frescoes, was in
the worst shape. Because of the
complexity of the problem, the YugoÂ¬
slav government asked Unesco to send
an advisory mission which arrived in
December 1951. Ferdinando Forlatti,
an Italian architect and SuperintenÂ¬
dent of Monuments at Venice, who had
successfully tackled similar problems
in restoring the Venetian Palazzo dei
Trecente, led the mission. The direcÂ¬
tor of the Central Institute for ResÂ¬
toration of Rome, Cesare Brandi, and
Yves Froidevaux, chief architect in
charge of historic monuments in Paris,
accompanied him. Working with YuÂ¬
goslav experts, the Unesco mission

YUGOSLAVIA (Continued)
made a month-long investigation of
the church and drew up recommendaÂ¬
tions for restoring Saint Sophia and
its frescoes. (1)
The delicate job of saving the church
and its paintings began almost at
once. The Yugoslav government asked
Mr. Forlatti to stay on and direct the
work along with the Yugoslav architect-
engineer, Boris Cipan, Director of the
Institute for the Protection of HistoricÂ¬
al Monuments of the Republic of
Macedonia.
Straightening out the south wall of
Saint Sophia was probably the hardest
job. The whole, wall leaned outward
and at one end there was a bad jagged
break. The Unesco mission recomÂ¬
mended that a complicated arranÂ¬
gement of heavy beams and strong
cables be built to snag the jag back
into place and then straighten up and
back the wall. (See diagram below).
The preparations for this took two
months. Workmen set about building
a giant wood and iron rectangular
frame, 90 feet long, around the wall of
the church, the idea being that as the
steel cables were tightened the frame
would' straighten out the wall. On
May 2, 1953, Yugoslav and Italian
directors were ready. In two hours
the jag was straightened. Two days
later, two hours again were enough to
pull the wall back to support the roof.
The special repairs made to the walls
consisted mainly of boring and filling
holes with a cement specially resistant
to humidity. This was carried out
with a tool operated on the principle
of a syringe a new instrument which
had been developed in Italy.
But before any of this work could be
started, the frescoes had to be removÂ¬
ed. In the past, frescoes were painted
on thin coats of plaster spread over a
layer of finely mixed sand, clay and
sometimes even mud covering the stone
or brick walls. The artist painted his
picture, or such sections of it as time
permitted, on the thin plaster layer
while it was still moist. As the
picture dried it became an integral
part of the wall.
For the damaged frescoes of St.
Sophia careful incisions were made in
the outer plaster to get at the sand-
clay mortar behind. Then the paintÂ¬
ings were lifted off in sections with

their mortar backing. For the unÂ¬
damaged frescoes a special glue was
spread on canvas and the canvas
was applied to the wall. The mural
was then peeled off like the skin of an
orange, with the thin layer of plaster
holding the colour.
Once off the walls, the murals were
specially treated and the mortar
thinned down, sometimes to as little
as two-tenths of an inch, after which
they were placed on new, strong wood
bases and remounted on the walls.
Thus far more than 600 square metres
of frescoes have been uncovered in the
church. On certain walls, it was
found that several layers of paintings
existed which thus presented a rare
panorama of the development of the
Macedonian school of Byzantine art in
the most compact space possible.
The restoration of Saint Sophia of
Ochrida has been an excellent example
of international co-operation between
specialists - which Unesco seeks to
foster this time between artists, arÂ¬
chitects, archaeologists and engineers.
These contacts have led to others.
Experts from Yugoslavia have recently
visited Italy and France to study resÂ¬
toration methods, and Italian and
French specialists have gone to YugoÂ¬
slavia to investigate the great treasures
that have now been revealed by the
restoration work still in operation and
scheduled for completion in 1955. Such
contacts contribute towards a better
knowledge of the common values of
the past, and to a better understandÂ¬
ing of the cultures of different peoples
which are Unesco's major goals. The
album of colour reproductions on the >
medieval frescoes of Yugoslavia's churÂ¬
ches in Unesco's World Art Series is
another step in the same direction.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
UNESCO'S MONTEVIDEO CONFERENCE
WHEN the flags of Unesco's
72 Member States were
lowered for the last time
before the Palacio Legislativo in
Montevideo, Uruguay, the Eighth
Session of the Unesco General
Conference had an impressive
list of precedent-setting achieÂ¬
vements behind it.
During a four-week meeting
ending December 11, the ConfeÂ¬
rence had adopted the highest
budget in the history of the Uni
ted Nations agency and laid
down a new Unesco programme
with an accent on basic issues
where the future of the world
in which we live is at stake.
This was the first Unesco
General Conference to be atÂ¬
tended by delegations from the
Union of Soviet Socialist RepubÂ¬
lics, Byelorussia and the UkraiÂ¬
ne. Contributions from these
new Member States are largely
responsible for the Conference's

decision to raise Unesco's budget
for 1955 and 1956 to a total of
$21,617,000an increase of 15
per cent over the 1953-54 budget
of $18,752,000.
This Conference, the first to
be held in South America, pasÂ¬
sed three joint resolutions which
will have a profound effect on
Unesco's programme.
The first, proposed by France,
India and Japan and voted unaÂ¬
nimously, instructed the SecreÂ¬
tariat to co-operate with the
U. N. and its Specialized AgenÂ¬
cies in studying the peaceful
uses of atomic energy and to disÂ¬
seminate "objective information
concerning the dangers and the
practical utilization of atomic
energy". In addition, Unesco
will now study ways of faciliÂ¬
tating the use of radio-isotopes
in research and industry.
The second put the ConferenÂ¬
ce on record as declaring its
"faith in the possibility of
resolving all tensions by peaceful
means" and ordered Unesco to
undertake "an objective study of
the means of promotmg peaceÂ¬
ful co-operation in accordance
with aims expressed in the
Unesco Constitution". It had
been proposed by three . counÂ¬
tries India, Czechoslovakia and
the United States.
The third resolution condemnÂ¬
ed the use of press, radio or
films to "provoke -or encourage
any threat to the peace" and
asked "all Member States of
Unesco to take necessary meaÂ¬
sures to assure freedom of exÂ¬
pression and to remove barriers
to the free flow of undistorted
information between Member
States." Adopted unanimously,
it had been presented jointly,
by Canada, Colombia, CzechoÂ¬
slovakia, Ecuador, France, India,
Lebanon, Mexico, the United
Kingdom, the United States
and the Union of Soviet SociaÂ¬
list Republics.
These two last resolutions
were termed by Dr Luther
H. Evans, Unesco Director-GenÂ¬
eral, in a message on Human
Rights Day, as "ample proof of
the lessening of international
tensions of which, I am sure,
the present Unesco Conference
is a living proof."
In the programme adopted fry
the Conference, the 15 per cent
budgetary increase is to toe used
almost entirely for projects
meeting specific needs of Unes-
. co Member States.
Examples of such projects are
the use of radio broadcasting in
adult education, Unesco aid in
producing reading materials for
new literates, international
scientific co-operation centres,
an international centre for
research on social problems of
industrialization in South Asia,
the training of fundamental
education leaders in museum
techniques, and Unesco support
of scientific research into such
fields as the problems of the
world's arid zones.
In addition, Unesco's 1955-56
programme contains provisions
for technical aid to Member
States on specific problems of
education, communications,
science and the organization of
libraries and museums. This
technical aid is over and above
Unesco's participation in the
United Nations world programÂ¬
me of technical assistance for
economic development. Under
this latter programme, Unesco
now has 140 educators and
scientists working in 36 counÂ¬
tries.
The General Conference also
acted on a heavy administrative
agenda. Among major decisions
was a vote to change the naÂ¬
ture of Unesco's Executive Board
which shapes the policy of the
Organization in between ConfeÂ¬
rence sessions. Board members
will now represent their governÂ¬
ments instead of serving as
individuals.
Following this decision, the
Conference then elected an enÂ¬
tirely new Executive Board with
22 members, two more than in
the past. Countries now repreÂ¬
sented on the Board are Brazil,
Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt,
France, the German Federal
Republic, India, Indonesia, Iran,
Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Liberia,
the Netherlands, Pakistan,
Spain, Thailand, the U.R.S.S.,
the United States, the United
Kingdom and Uruguay.
In one of its final decisions,
the Conference voted that its
next meeting, in two years, will
be held in New Delhi, India.
