HALL OF MYRIAD BUDDHAS. Some 15 centuries ago sculptors, painters and stone cutters began to hew out and embellish hun¬¨
dreds of Buddhist cave-chapels in the solid rock of Maichishan, a mountain in northwest China. One of the largest and most striking
of their achievements is the Hall of a Myriad Buddhas. Here the entire wall surfaces are covered with frescoes and thousands of impres¬¨
sed plaster figures of the Buddha painted in bright colours (photo above). To make this spacious hall, beams, struts, ceiling ridges
and lintels with reliefs of clouds were all cutfrom the living rock. Atthe entrance stands a large statue of Buddha. See photo page 20.

THE PERILS OF AIR POLLUTION
Until recently, most of us have paid strangely little
attention to the quality of the air We breathe even
though the purity of the food iwe eat and of the
water we drink has been considered important enough
to warrant proper safeguards for many years. Yet the
fact is that the average adult person needs about thirty
cubic feet or about three pounds of air a day for breathing
while less than three pounds of food and four and a half
pounds of water are consumed. on an average during the
same day.
It has taken a series of fatal smog disasters in recent
years 'to jolt many of us out of this singular unconcern
and to make us ponder the fact that With the tremendous
growth of industrial centres and the increase in' motor
traffic, millions of tons of gases, fumes, vapours, dusts
and other impurities are being poured into the air we
breathe daily.
It has been estimated that over eight million tons of
atmospheric pollution are produced each year in Great
Britain just from the burning of coal and its derived fuels.
A recent study in Paris has shown that motor traffic
accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of the total air pollution
of the city and the heating of houses for about 50 per
cent.
A British authority on air pollution, Mr. A.R. Meetham,
describes ..the problem in -the following words: "Since the
beginning of the industrial revolution a minor irritation
has become a great social evil. In towns and industrial
districts rain water loses its purity; ash and other solids
fall continuously to the ground; the air contains . a
suspension of fine particles which penetrate indoors,, to
be deposited on walls, ceilings, curtains and furniture; our
clothing, our skins, and our lungs are contaminated;
metals corrode, buildings decay, and textiles wear out;
vegetation is stunted and blackened; sunlight is lost;
germs multiply; our natural resistance to disease is
lowered. In a hundred and one Ways the miasma of
atmospheric pollution is lowering our vitality and our
enjoyment of life."
This increasing pollution of the atmosphere must be
prevented if our health is" to be safeguarded from its
disastrous effects.
A long fight is ahead if clean, smokeless air is to be
achieved everywhere, but already much has been done to
alleviate the pollution in a number of the world's cities.
Now with a world campaign against atmospheric pollution
proposed by- the World Health Organization the drive is
building up into a major campaign.
Just as we no longer throw rubbish into the street, we
shall eventually cease to discharge smoke and other filth
into the air. It is high time we stopped using the air we
breathe as a sewer.

MUST WE USE THE AIR OF
OUR CITIES AS A SE
by P.J. Lawther
M.R.C. Group for Research on Atmospheric Pollution,
St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London
Today the effects of air pollution on health are
the urgent concern of research workers in many
countries throughout the world. Their intense
activity is partly the result of the stimulation afforded
by recent "smog" disasters which have shown beyond
doubt that air borne filth can kill [when it reaches high
concentrations for a few days.
But this not merely a modern problem: the menace of
air pollution was recognized many centuries ago and the
fouling of the common air by coal smoke has long been
considered to be a social crime in Britain. In 1273 an Act
Of Parliament was passed forbidding the burning of coal
in London and, indeed, a man was executed in 1306 for
this crime.
The problem continued to exercise the minds of those
in authority and in 1661 there was published the most
eloquent plea for clean air which the world is likely to
see: the diarist John Evelyn wrote his pamphlet "Fumi-
fugium" which makes us blush with shame at our 400
years .of indolence in the face of the pernicious nuisance
which he describes so accurately:
"That men whose very Being is Aer, should not breath
it freely when they may: but (as that Tyrant used his
Vassals) condemn themselves to this misery and fumo
praefocari, is strange stupidity: yet thus we see them
walk and converse in London, pursued and haunted by
that infernal Smoake, and the funest accidents which
accompany it wheresoever they retire."

Madeleine Church in the background and (right) the Place de la Concorde. Damage caused by air pollution in France is calculated to be
240,000 million francs per year. In Paris motor traffic accounts for 30-40 % of total pollution and domestic heat for 50 %
The industrial revolution in the 19th century saw a
vast increase in the amount of air pollution due to the
prodigal use of great quantities of fuel. Wise men saw
the dangers but their warnings went largely unheeded as
we continued irresponsibly to use the air as a sewer.
When iwe in Britain talk of air pollution we mean the
filth which we must breathe in our towns and which is
produced mainly from the burning of 200 million tons of
coal and 20 million tons of oil each year. This confla¬¨
gration produces many hundreds of pollutants but we'
may concern ourselves mainly with the smoke (2.1 million
tons), sulphur dioxide (5.3 million tons) and carbon
monoxide (24 million tons). The smoke contains many
complex organic chemicals among which are compounds
which are capable of producing cancer in experimental
animals. Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid come from
the sulphur in fuels and both these substances can be
very irritant to the lungs when breathed in high enough
concentrations. Carbon monoxide is, of course, a dange¬¨
rous asphyxiant gas.
Obviously no proper study of the effects of air pollution
is possible without paying very careful attention to the
nature of the filth in the air We breathe and the physician'
and physiologist must work patiently with the physicist
.and chemist in order to gain a clear idea of the'
complexity of the subject. The physicist strives to
describe the minute structure of the tiny particles and
droplets contained in town air because their fate on
inhalation largely depends on their size and shape; we
want to know if they are small enough to get into the
lung and having got there how far they penetrate and
what proportion remains inside. The chemist has a
formidable analytical task trying to unravel the myriads
of compounds which are present in extreme dilutions and
therefore do hot behave at all the way they do in books
and lecture theatres.
The complex, nature of air pollution is often forgotten
and deceptively simple explanations of its effects are all
too common. Great confusion has been caused by the
assumption that pollution differs only in amount whereas
it is clear that it varies widely in composition as well;
ordinary winter pollution is not merely dilute smog. Day-
to-day air pollution in cities is mercifully dispersed by
winds but occasionally this scavenging process fails with
tragic results and we have a famous "smog disaster" in
which many people die. This happens when the air is
abnormally still for some time and, in valleys, cold air
rolls down the hillsides and comes to lie under a layer
of warm air. The refuse from our chimneys cannot rise
but is trapped under a huge lid and accumulates to reach
high concentrations in which it probably brews up and
forms dangerous compounds Which would not be found
in more normal circumstances.
During these temperature inversions it is frequently
cold (people therefore burn more fuel) and fog is common.
A word of warning is necessary to avoid a cause of grave
confusion: Britain's '"smog"'' smoke polluted fog is in no
way like the lachrymatory haze which annoys the
people of Los Angeles where very special
meteorological conditions exist and where
coal smoke and fog are equally rare.
Analytical work indicates the need to re¬¨
cognize two main types of air pollution the

rare, acute variety and the chronic day-to-day urban
filth.
The acute type, the "smog", can kill. Old people with
respiratory difficulties brought about by disease of the
lungs or heart may find themselves unable to tolerate the.
Irrltajtion of long periods of high pollution and the strain
may be mortal. Very many who escape death are yet
made much worse during these episodes and it is likely
that the onset of diseases such as chronic bronchitis is
hastened by this form of pollution.
We must identify with certainty the substances res¬¨
ponsible for these evil effects and, if it is not y√®t possible,
to prohibit their emission, some forms of protection must
be devised for patients known to be susceptible. Simple
masks may stop the coarser particles from entering the
respiratory tract and such masks are being given careful
clinical trials. Small concentrations of ammonia liberated
from wick bottles can neutralise acid particles and gases
and may be of value in preventing their irritant effects.
Orthodox medical treatment must be applied and the
common sense advice to rest indoors is sound.
The long term effects of chronic pollution are less dra¬¨
matic but recent research shows that dirty town air may
well be one of the most serious scourges which man has
inflicted upon himself. Chronic bronchitis Nis a disease
which produces untold suffering, incapacity to work and
ultimate premature death. The delicate lining of .the
air passages is first irritated and later destroyed giving
rise to cough and expectoration. Frequent infections,
occur and the function and structure of the lungs, are
then impaired. Severe breathlessness follows this damage
and later the heart may be severely affected
It would be strange if such conditions as domestic over¬¨
crowding, dusty occupations, bad working conditions,
poor diet and smoking had not played some part in
the production of the disease but it seems that air pollution
is likely to be an important factor. Undoubtedly urban
pollution, is the most important single factor affecting the
daily well-being of patients who already have bronchitis.
Lung cancer is a disease which has become alarmingly
common in the last decades. Mention has already been
made of the presence in town air of chemical compounds
which can produce cancer in experimental animals and
common sense leads one to suspects air pollution as a
cause of the disease in man. There is, however, no reason
to believe that the character of the smoke in our towns
has altered significantly as would be required by such an
hypothesis and all the evidence points to some new factor
which began to operate early this century. From all
over the world come fresh indictments of the cigarette
smoking habit as the principle cause of lung cancer and
the association must be considered proved beyond rea¬¨
sonable doubt. This factor tends to swamp any carcino¬¨
genic effects of air pollution but it must not lead us to
ignore it.
Air pollution Is a monstrous social evil which can no
longer be tolerated in civilized society. There is ample
evidence that it is harmful and though a vast amount
of detailed work is urgently needed to elucidate its effects,
the abolition of pollution must not await the results of
research. We now have a Clean Air Act in Great Britain,
which bids fair to give us some relief but there must be
no respite in the technological battle to abolish completely
this shocking self-inflicted scourge of urban man.
PITTSBURGH: 'SMOKY
CITY' NO LONGER
Because its industries burned soft coal, there was a
time when Pittsburgh was one of the blackest cities
in the United States and was known as the "Smoky
City." Soot accumulated everywhere on buildings as
well as in the lungs of the inhabitants. Today it is
losing that reputation. More efficient coal burners,
smoke-prevention devices, wider use of natural gas,
fuel oil and electricity, all aided by enforcement of city
laws against smoke, have made Pittsburgh a cleaner
place. Photos above and below, taken several years
apart at the entrance to the city's Liberty Tunnel, vividly
show the progress made in smoke abatement. Since
the passing of new laws in 1957 city's air is 65% cleaner.

SMOG IS TRAPPED in the Los Angeles Basin by what is known as a temperature inversion layer of "upside down" weather caused
when warm air from the Pacific descends on the basin and meets ocean-cooled air below. In photo above, Los Angeles Civic Centre
and other buildings project above the base of the inversion layer while pollution remains trapped below, surrounding mountains
preventing its dispersal by the weak winds (Diagram, below right). In the Pacific coast area where a ground layer of colder air
is often pronounced, the condition may persist for many weeks. Severity of Los Angeles smog is accentuated by exhaust fumes
from city's dense traffic totalling some two and a half million automobiles. Below left, packed highways during the rush hours.

### 64965: Smog: a world problem with many answers
SMOG
A WORLD PROBLEM
WITH MANY ANSWERS
by A.J. Haagen-Smit
Professor of Biochemistry, California Institute of Technology
From time to time we hear that soon tnere will no
longer be room for our crops, no fuels to burn, no
water for irrigation, and last, but not least, no air fit
to breathe. Such statements are usually countered by a
blind confidence in the accomplishment of the engineer or
inventive genius. Fortunately, each time something has
been done which postpones the evil day. Nevertheless,
this warning cry is needed. It is essential that we start
working before it is too late, and great harm is done to
our existence.
There is no doubt that our fossil fuels will be exhausted
at some time, perhaps only two or four generations from
now. Already there is a much larger supply of fuel in
sight in the form of atomic energy, but this energy has
not been made available without considerable effort by
scientists and engineers. The same is true for our water
shortage. Tremendous engineering projects have been
constructed, and research is going on to prepare fresh
water from sea water. In the field of food technology
efforts are continuing to obtain the most efficient use of
land, and production of synthetic food draws nearer.
The air we breathe is a part of our diet, and there is
every reason to be as particular about quality of the air as
we are about our food. The amount of air we inhale per
day is in the order of 30 cubic feet, weighing about three
pounds. An air pollutant at a concentration of only one
part in a million adds one milligram to our daily diet, and
such additions, when toxic, might have serious conse¬¨
quences. Usually we are not too concerned about the
possible toxic properties of the air, and only when acute
symptoms are noticed do we demand some action.
Such circumstances have arisen in Donora, Pennsyl¬¨
vania, in' the Meuse Valley in Belgium, in Poza Rica,
Mexico, in London, and, since the war years, in Los
Angeles. In Donora, as in Belgium, the causes of the
discomfort were the release of sulphur oxides, metal dusts,
and perhaps fluorides. In Mexico it was a wave of
hydrogen sulphide which killed some twenty people.
No poisoning but torrents of tears
With the rapid growth of cities and the increased
density of population, air pollution problems have
become quite general all over the U.S.A. There was
a time when Pittsburgh was one of the blackest cities in
the United States. Due. to the burning of soft coal, soot
accumulated everywhere on buildings, as well as in the
lungs of the people. Today the black colour of Pittsburgh's
famous landmark, the Cathedral of Learning, slowly
begins. to wash down.
Los Angeles has its own brand of pollution, and although
no sign of acute poisoning has yet been observed, living
conditions are nevertheless highly disagreeable at times
because of lachrym'atory effects and irritating chemical
odours. The same circumstances which made the Los
Angeles basin an ideal place, to live also made it vulnerable
to the development of a first-rate air pollution problem.
It is surrounded by high mountains and most of the time
the pollutants drift slowly back and forth over the basin
impelled by alternating sea and land winds.
The situation is aggravated by an inversion condition
which holds the pollutants close to' the ground. Almost
everyone has seen such conditions when he has looked
at the early morning haze covering the meadows. Usually
such an inversion disappears when the air near the ground
warms up. In the Pacific Coast area, where the ground
layer of colder air is often quite pronounced, the
condition may persist for many weeks. In this way the
pollutants become trapped, and reach concentrations
which cause concern to the Public Health officials.
The nature of the pollution problem in Los Angeles is
now well established. Formation of the typical smog
symptoms, such as eye irritation, plant damage, severe
rubber cracking and brownish haze is no longer a
mystery. It has been shown that the major culprit is
the emission of large quantities of organic material and
of oxides of nitrogen. When the sun shines on this
mixture, ozone and eye irritating substances are formed.
A muffler for every automobile
As soon as these facts were established, a thorough
checkup was made on the sources contributing to
this smog reaction. It was found that the petroleum
industry, through evaporation losses, contributed a
substantial part of the hydrocarbons to the atmosphere.
The major part of these sources are, at present, controlled.
There is, however, a much larger source the automobile.
In the Los Angeles basin, two and one-half million
automobiles are polluting the air daily with about
1,000 tons of hydrocarbons. This large emission is
caused by the incomplete combustion of the fuel in the
engine cylinders, and amounts to seven to eight per cent
of the petrol consumed in the Los Angeles area. The
oxides of nitrogen are formed from nitrogen and oxygen
in the air in all high temperature combustions in the
burning of natural gas and oil, as well as of petrol. The
consumption of all these fuels has increased in proportion
to the phenomenal population growth of the area, and so
has the amount of oxides of nitrogen formed. At present,
it is estimated that six hundred tons are produced daily,
of which two-thirds have to be credited against the
automobile and one-third against oil and gas burning.
Efforts are therefore being made to produce exhaust
mufflers which burn the residual gases completely to
carbon dioxide and water. Although promising ex¬¨
perimental units have been produced, there is still a long
way to go before the exhaust burner becomes a standard
item on the car, just as the windshield wiper is today.
Research and development towards control of emission of
the other partner in the smog reaction, the oxides of
nitrogen, is still in its infancy, but it is hoped that' their
concentration in exhaust gases may be reduced through
catalytic devices or by prevention of their formation.
While most of the typical Los Angeles smog symptoms
will be reduced by the control of hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides, there are still large quantities of materials
to be controlled, which, in other areas, have given rise to
objectionable conditions. Among those we should mention
dust and smoke particles. A concentration of six million
people, through their daily activities, produces large
amounts of ordinary smoke in a densely populated area.
Old-fashioned methods of trash disposal have to be
abandoned and modern methods of
complete incineration substituted. Even
more desirable are cut-and-fill dumps,
which not only dispose of trash most
efficiently, but assist in land reclamation

### 64966: The U.S.S.R. fight to free its cities from air pollution
THE U.S.S.R. FIGHT
TO FREE ITS CITIES
FROM AIR POLLUTION
In the Soviet Union the battle against air pollution in
towns and' industrial centres has been given high
priority since 1949 when the U.S.S.R. Council of
Ministers approved a "Clean Air" Act for populated areas.
Headquarters of the nation-wide anti-pollution campaign
is the Chief Sanitary Inspection Office whose special
committee for the protection of the air, with its large
staff of chemists, doctors and other specialists, is in fact
a scientific centre for consultation and research.
One of its chief tasks, says Professor V. Ryazanov (1), a
Soviet scientist, in a special report to The Unesco Courier,
is to study the harmful effects of atmospheric pollution
on human beings and to determine the permissible limits
for the concentrations found in the air. It has been
found, for example, that the concentration of sulphur gas
in city air normally varies around one or two milligrammes
per cubic metre and that workers in industrial plants can
tolerate up to 20 milligrammes per cubic metre without
any noticeable harm.
However, the concentration of impurities in the air of
populated areas must be kept much lower than that found
in industry: a worker spends only six to eight hours a
day in a factory; the town dweller breathes the same air
all day long, and air inside homes contains only slightly
less harmful admixtures than the outside air.
Furthermore, factory workers are usually of an age
when organisms have a high resistance to such harmful
impurities; city dwellers include old people and young
children whose level of resistance is much lower. Measures
for health protection in industry aim primarily to prevent
harmful action of toxic substances; those designed for
urban populations must also make a special effort to guard
against unpleasant physical effects, such as tears, sneez¬¨
ing, coughing and changes in the depth and frequency of
breathing.
Soviet experiments have shown that various reflex
reactions result from breathing very small, sometimes
imperceptible concentrations of atmospheric pollutants.
The odour of sulphur gas, for instance, can be detected
only in a concentration of at least 1.6 milligrammes per
cubic metre, yet even a concentration as small as 0.6 milli¬¨
grammes per cubic metre can provoke reflexes in the
brain. Bottom photo on this page shows studies being
made of the effect of very weak concentrations of sulphur
gas on electric currents in the human brain. This is one
form of research which helps Soviet scientists to deter¬¨
mine the permissible concentration limits of pollutants.
Attacking industrial air pollution at its source, a special
committee for cleaning industrial waste in the atmosphere
stimulates research in many institutes on ways and
devices for cleaning industrial gas and smoke released
into the air. Thousands of such devices are used in Soviet
power stations and factories.
Today the Soviet Union is also seeking more radical
and economical methods, primarily the rationalization of
technological processes through which the pelease of
harmful gases and dust into the atmosphere will be
decreased or completely stopped. In the fight against
pollution of the air by automobiles, buses will gradually
be replaced by trolleybuses and the numbers of electro-
mobiles and cars running on liquid gas will be increased.
Top photo shows traffic density in Gorki Street, Moscow.

### 64968: The Price of unclean air
THE PRICE OF UNCLEAN AIR
Major smog disasters. There have been
four major smog disasters in the past
30 years. The first was in December 1930,
in the Meuse Valley near Li√®ge, Belgium,
lined with blast furnaces, iron and steel
mills, zinc and glass works and other
chemical plants. After five days of per¬¨
sistent fog 63 people died. The victims
all suffered from acute irritation of the
respiratory tract and vomiting until death
came from heart failure. Several hundred
other people became severely ill; many
head of cattle had to be slaughtered. In
November 1948 another 5-day smog at
Donora, near Pittsburgh, caused the death
of 19 people.
The worst smog disaster in modern times
was the one that ravaged London in Dec¬¨
ember 1952 when a 4-day fog killed some
4,000 persons and made thousands of other
people violently ill. Even the cholera
epidemic of 1866 did not equal this, and
in the past 100 years only the peak week
of influenza in November 1918 produced
more deaths over the expected normal
than did the smog of 1952. Following the
disaster the Government called for an
investigation which resulted in a series of
recommendations aimed at preventing
recurrences. Nevertheless, a similar though
less severe smog occurred in 1956 causing
an estimated 1,000 additional deaths in
Greater London.
Financial losses: $3 million of damage
is reported to have been done to crops in
the Los Angeles area every year since 1953.
The total losses in the U.S.A. from air
pollution in 1950-1951 amounted to $1,500
million, i. e. $10 per inhabitant per year.
In the U.K. losses for 1947 were estimated
at ¬£100 million, while in France the dam¬¨
ages are calculated to be as high as
240,000 million francs.

WORLD ANTI-AIR-POLLUTION
CAMPAIGN URGED BY W.H.O.
A world campaign to combat the growing menace of air pollution has been
proposed by an international committee on air pollution recently set up
by the World Health Organization in Geneva and grouping together
medical and public health specialists from Europe, America, Asia and Africa.
In a special report issued a few months ago the committee calls for the
mobilization! of world public opinion through a broad programme of education
to make clear to everyone the nature and causes of air pollution, its harmful
effects on health, the difficulties which face any programme for producing clean
air, and the ways in which ordinary citizens can help in reducing air pollution.
The W.H.O. committee has proposed that national air pollution councils now
set up in every country to take stock of the situation as a whole and to
supervise all aspects of an anti-air-pollution drive in the nation. It suggests that
these councils include not only public health officials but also representatives of
various industries, agriculture, science, transport, housing, town planning, etc.
One of the important functions of these councils would be to advise on the form
and scope of special legislation eventually deemed necessary to combat air
pollution. According to the World Health Organization report one thing is
certain: on the basis of present knowledge much pollution can be avoided at a
reasonable cost by careful planning and siting of factories and dwellings, the
better design of equipment, and better operation based on adequate training of
management and employees. The report cites numerous examples of how
pollution can be reduced without undue cost and sometimes even with a financial
saving.
Smoke, it points out, for example, is a .visible sign of the inefficient burning of
fuel and hence of the wasting of fuel. If proper air supplies were ensured for
burning coal and oil in industrial boilers these would eliminate all or most of the
smoke with a consequent saving of fuel used for the same operation. However,
to avoid air pollution from domestic coal fires such as those in London, new
heating systems may have to be introduced.
Whereas it is generally accepted that unusual concentrations of smog over a
city have been responsible for sickness and death, the committee stressed the
fact that smaller doses of atmospheric pollution have also had harmful effects
upon the health of large numbers of people. The exact toxicity of long-continued
exposure to smaller concentrations of pollution, however, are not yet known, and
more research work is needed on a large scale in many selected places before
definite conclusions can be reached. The W.H.O. committee therefore urges a
stepped-up programme of research on air pollution and the pooling of information
between all countries.
are less resistant than sheep and pigs.
Sheep and cattle are particularly sensitive
to fluorine in the air which tends to accu¬¨
mulate in the grass. The teeth of grazing
animals have been known to deteriorate so
much through fluorosis that the animals
were unable to feed. Research in England
has shown how radishes and other plants
lose from half to nine-tenths of their
growth in a polluted atmosphere, if they
survive at all, and that soil loses its stock
of accessory plant foods very rapidly under
the action of polluted rain.
' Works of art can ¬°be seriously affected
by pollution. Smoke is harmful to paint¬¨
ings, particularly on wood, and to' textiles,
leather and wax-film material. The deterio¬¨
ration of works of art and historical monu¬¨
ments by the corrosive effects of air
pollution has been a matter for concern to
Unesco and national authorities for years.
' Damage to buildings: Building materials
are corroded and disfigured by atmo¬¨
spheric pollution. Smoke particles stick
on every surface of stone, brick, paint or
glass, whether horizontal or vertical, which
may or may not be partly removed by
rain. An authoritative estimate in 1930 put
the cost of th√© damage to buildings in the
United Kingdom at two and a half million
pounds per year.
EXAMPLES REPORTED
FROM EUROPE
Switzerland: Harmful effects on animals
and on plant life have been reported in the
neighbourhood of aluminium factories.
Poland: In some districts where the
concentration of smelting and similar
industries is particularly heavy, the health
of school children is being adversely
affected.
Netherlands: Pollution from fluorine
compounds has had such a serious effect
on cattle that some have had to be
slaughtered. Damage to plant life has
also been noted.
Germany: Animal losses have occurred
near plants releasing arsenic compounds
and metallic dusts into the air.
Sweden: Harmful effects on plat life
have been observed as a consequence of
flue gases from shale-oil factories, iron

discharged into the air. Today scientists
and health authorities in many countries
are investigating the effects of smoke
and other factors contributing to air
pollution. Here, members of a research

### 64969: Is radio-activity in the air a new threat to our health?
IS RADIO-ACTIVITY IN THE AIR
A NEW THREAT TO OUR HEALTH?
by Dr. N.G. Stewart
Head of Health and Safety, U.K. Atomic Energy Authority,
Dounreay Experimental Reactor Establishment, Scotland
Measurements of the natural radio-activity in the
atmosphere were first made more than fifty years
ago and several scientific papers were published
between 1903 and 1908. The subject then lay dormant
for some time but with the development of nuclear power
and the testing of nuclear weapons, interest has revived
in recent years and a world-wide programme of
measurement of atmospheric radio-activity both natural
and man-made was undertaken during the Interna¬¨
tional Geophysical Year.
One . very important feature of radio-activity in the
atmosphere is that, in contrast with some other forms
of atmospheric pollution, maximum permissible concen¬¨
trations (M.P.C.) have been laid down for all the
important radio-active isotopes by the International
Commission on Radiological Protection (I.C.R.P.) which
keeps these figures under constant review. A maximum
permissible concentration is defined as that which, in
the light of present knowledge, is not expected to cause
appreciable bodily injury to a person continuously exposed
to that concentration throughout his lifetime.
At the present time there are three principal sources
of radio-activity in the atmosphere:
naturally occuring radio-activity,
radio-activity from atomic energy installations,
radio-activity from atomic test explosions.
The radio-active elements naturally present in air fall
into two main groups light elements and heavy
elements and each has its own distinctive origin.
The lighter elements such as tritium, much publicized
as a component of the H-bomb, and carbon 14, used in
radio-carbon dating, are formed continuously by the
action of fast cosmic rays from outer space on air
molecules. The total amount of each present in the
universe is very nearly constant, having built up to an
"equilibrium" value where the number of new atoms
created per unit time is balanced by the number which
disappear by radio-active decay. The concentrations in
ground-level air are small and the highest standards of
radio-chemical analysis and measuring techniques are
required for their evaluation.
Miners' deaths from 'mountain sickness'
caused by deadly underground air
The bulk of the natural radio-active content of the
lower atmosphere is due to the heavy gas radon and
its daughter products. Radon is one of the elements
formed by the radio-active decay of uranium which is
present in greater or lesser degree in rocks and soils all
over the world. Being a gas, radon can escape from the
earth's crust into the atmosphere where it disintegrates
radio-actively to form a chain of seven daughter products
each of which is produced by the disintegration of the
preceding one, the final element being lead which is stable.
These daughter products, being solids, are ultimately
Washed out of atmosphere by rain after an average
residence time of about ten days.
In average meteorological conditions, the radon escaping
from the earth's surface rapidly diffuses upwards due to
the natural turbulence of the atmosphere. When the air
is relatively still, as on clear evenings, the rate of upward
diffusion can be very low so that the radon accumulates
and high concentrations build up in ground level air.
Thus near Harwell, England (site of the main U.K. Ato¬¨
mic Research Centre) although the mean concentration
of radon in air was less than .06 per cent of the M.P.C.
for occupational workers as defined by the International
Commission on Radiological Protection, peaks of up to
15 times this mean level have been observed in stable
atmospheres. Similar concentrations have been observed
in other parts of the United Kingdom but on the average
it appears that the natural radon content of the air in
the United Kingdom is at a very safe level.
Higher values are to be expected in countries where the
uranium content of rocks and soils are high. Thus in
Sweden, where building bricks contain more natural
uranium than those used in the United Kingdom, high
concentrations of radon have been observed in badly
ventilated rooms in some houses. The biggest problem
of all is, naturally, in uranium mines where very efficient
ventilating systems are now used to maintain the radon
in air at a low level. Years ago, before adequate venti¬¨
lation was introduced, many uranium miners died in
middle-age from a respiratory disease which they called
"mountain-sickness" but which is now known to have
been cancer of the lung almost certainly due to the high
radon content of the air in the mines where they worked.
Hazards from radio-active grass,
eaten by cows & passed into milk
Most industries have to dispose of some waste products
by discharging them into the atmosphere through
chimney stacks. In the United Kingdom, the
Atomic Energy Authority has had to face the same problem
but, under the terms of the Atomic' Energy Act, 1954, the
amounts discharged have to be authorized jointly by
appointed Government Ministries who maintain an
inspection system to ensure that the permitted levels are
not exceeded.
Similar controlling arrangements exist in most coun¬¨
tries. In fixing a permissible discharge rate, the
controlling authorities will have in mind the appropriate
recommendations of the I.C.R.P. which will specify the
maximum permissible concentration at ground level. To
translate this into a maximum permissible discharge rate
presents a complex problem which is best solved
experimentally. Thus at Harwell an intensive programme
of observation was carried out on the spread of the radio¬¨
active gas (argon 41) which is discharged from the
chimney of the Bepo reactor. These experiments not
only confirmed that the mean concentration of A-41 at
ground level was less than 1% of the Maximum
Permissible Concentration but provided systematic data
which have been applied to specifying the maximum
permissible discharge rates from similar stacks elsewhere.
In many cases, however, the limiting hazard is not due
to the radio-activity suspended in the air but to that
fraction of it which is deposited on grass, eaten by cows
and passed into milk which is subsequently consumed by
human beings. This is the case with the
biologically important radio-active isotopes
iodine 131 and strontium 90. Typical
questions which must be answered before
permissible discharge rates can be defined
for such isotopes are, for example,

IS RADIO-ACTIVITY
IN THE AIR A NEW
THREAT TO HEALTH?
(Continued)
(i) how much of the iodine 131 in air is deposited on
grass in dry and wet, calm and windy Weather.
(il) what concentration of 1-131 appears in milk as a
result of a given level on grass.
In past years the answers to these questions were not
known and discharge rates were estimated on an
extremely conservative basis. Now, as a result of
systematically surveying the biological environment of
nuclear Installations and of exploiting all events in
which radio-activity has been released into the atmo¬¨
sphere, information is being gathered which allows more
realistic estimates to be made.
Examples of such work are the surveys made in the
United States in the environment of the chemical
processing plant at Hanford and the extensive surveys
carried out in the United Kingdom after the reactor
accident at Windscale which caused a large amount of
iodine 131 to be released into the atmosphere. The
Windscale accident illustrates a point made earlier in
that the airborne iodine 131 gave rise to no significant
direct hazard in the cities over which the radio-active
cloud passed but the agricultural hazard led to restrictions
in milk consumption over an area of 200 square miles.
The dust particles from nuclear test explosions contain
fission products which consist of a large number of
different radio-active isotopes. In the air above the
United Kingdom the average airborne activity from tests
since 1952 has been less than 1% of the natural activity
of the radon daughter products Which indicates that this
is not a significant problem in Western Europe at least.
The main hazard from the dust arises from the strontium
90 component after it has been deposited on grass and
transmitted into milk.
The amount of strontium 90 deposited in the successive
years since 1954 has been fairly constant and the current
level in children's bones is about 1 strontium unit (S.U.).
On this scale the maximum permissible level for
occupational workers is 1,000 S.U. and for members of the
general public 100 S.U. The Medical Research Council
of the United Kingdom in their 1956 report on radiation
hazards accepted these figures but added that immediate
consideration would be required if the concentration in
human bones showed signs of rising greatly above 10 S.U.
It will be seen that the present amount in children's
bones is considerably below these levels.
Atomic dust clouds float to earth
for years after weapons' tests
World-wide surveys of strontium 90 have revealed
some interesting features of the diffusion and
deposition of the dust clouds from weapon tests. It
has been shown that most of the strontium 90 deposited is
derived from the large scale thermonuclear explosion
whose clouds enter the stratosphere and return to earth
slowly over a number of years. Thus strontium 90 will
continue to be deposited for some years after the cessation
of all nuclear tests. The rate at which the dust re-enters
the lower atmosphere is not constant but varies seasonally,
with peaks in the late spring and troughs in the late
autumn of each year. The deposition rate varies markedly
with latitude; the highest rate occurs in the middle
latitudes of the northern hemisphere and relatively little
is deposited in equatorial regions. These data are of great
meteorological interest and contribute to an under¬¨
standing of the general circulation of the atmosphere.
The need for controlling radio-active contamination of
the atmosphere is widely recognized and was one of the
concerns of the United Nations Scientific Committee on
the Effects of Atomic Radiation whose report was
published in 1958. If nuclear power is to be developed in
the interests of a developing civilization, a balance must
.be struck between the hazard to populations of discharging
low-activity wastes into the atmosphere (or ocean) and
the high costs of processing and storing them. In
striking this balance and in planning to protect popu¬¨
lations from the effects of reactor accidents, however
unlikely these may be, there is a continuing need for
experimental study of the relationship between man and
the .radio-activity in his environment.

### 64970: Smog in the tropics
SMOG IN THE TROPICS
by E. M. Fournier a"Albe
For most people, who have only dreamed of going
there, Mexico is a country of colour, of light and
shade, of brilliant sunshine, with figures of horsemen
casting black shadows on the arid cactus-studded land.
And indeed this is a fairly true picture of Mexico as a
whole.
But the traveller arriving for the first time in Mexico
City is often sadly disappointed. The sky is free of
clouds, but it is not of the blue which he imagined. The
mountain peaks stand around the city, but their outlines
are only faintly visible through the dry haze. The air
is pleasantly cool, but not fresh. There is a faint but
persistent odour in the air which, if he were a chemist
would make him remark "mercaptans," or if he came
from Los Angeles might remind him vaguely of home.
The fact is that Mexico City has a smog. Not quite such
an aggressive smog as Los Angeles nor so depressing as
those of London, but still it is there, becoming thicker
each year as the city grows.
Mexicans have always been proud of the beauty of
their skies and have been quick to notice the change
which the last thirty years has gradually brought to
those of their capital. At first, they blamed the deforesta¬¨
tion of the hills and the drainage of the lake which in
Aztec times surrounded the city. It is true that in the
spring, after the dry winter, sudden stormscalled
tolvaneras bring palls of dust from the lake bed into
the city. But these storms only last a few hours, and
then the air clears again.
A change in the wind
cuts the sun's heat 50 %
What is new is the haze, sometimes almost as thick
as fog, which hangs over the city in the calm
windless mornings. Could this possibly be smoke?
If so, where from? Mexico City is becoming industrialized,
but still not to the extent of cities in North America and
Europe; and happily the climate does not require houses
to be heated, except on one or two days each year.
In 1955, the same questions began to be asked by a
small group of scientists working at the Institute of
Applied Science 'of the National University of Mexico.
They had been studying the strength of solar radiation,
thinking that one day it might be put to some use, and
were surprised to discover that the strength of the
sunlight √§t the University depended on the direction of
the wind.
When it blew from the south and west, coming in from
the country, the sun was very strong, say 1.3 or 1.4 calories
per square centimetre per minute ; but on days when
the wind blew from the north bringing down to the
University the haze from the city, the sun's strength
fell sharply, sometimes .down to 0.6 calories, or less than
half its normal value! This even happened on dry,
cloudless days, and meant that the amount of dust and
smoke in the air coming from the city was really
tremendous.
One of the first things the scientists of the Institute
did was to check the data on visibility over the city,
observed every day from the headquarters of the National
Meteorological Service. It soon became obvious that a
great change had taken place in the last twenty years.
Up to about 1940 "the average visibility in the mornings
over the city was between 10 and 20 kilometres, but from
that year onwards there has been a steady decline and
at present it is hardly more than four kilometres. No
climatic change can account for this. It must be due
to an increase in air pollution.
The next step was to put out on roofs of buildings
in different parts of the city small glass dishes, to see
how much dust and grit they collected in the course of a
week. This of course could only be done in dry weather,
but luckily it rains very rarely in Mexico during the
winter months from December to March. At the end of
each week the dishes were collected and replaced by
clean ones. The dust collected in each dish was carefully
weighed and then examined under the microscope to
discover what types of dust and grit had been deposited,
whether it came from the ground or from chimneys.
Dust pall on Mexico City
totals 200 tons per day
The weighings showed that on the average about five
tons of dust and grit were deposited per square
kilometre per week during fine weather, and that in
the centre of the city the figure rose to over 15 tons per
square ¬°kilometre per week, Which is almost as high as that
observed in English industrial towns, such as Birmingham.
How could this be true, in a city which is not nearly so
heavily industrialized? The reason is that Mexico City
lies in a valley surrounded on all sides but one by high
mountains. Winds are light, and smoke, instead of being
carried away, just hangs around the valley.
It is a simple matter to multiply the figure of five tons
per square kilometre by the area of the city (approxi¬¨
mately 250 sq. kilometres) and to arrive at the result that
1,250 tons of dust and grit fall on the city each week, or
nearly 200 tons a day.
Now, "if what goes up must come down" it is equally
true that 'What comes down must have gone up." In
other words, at least 200 tons of smoke are loosed into
the air every day, and probably half of this is unburnt
fuel, worth at least $ 5,000. So the cost to the city in
unburnt fuel alone may be nearly two million dollars
yearly. Add to that the cost of corrosion of metals and
materials, the extra laundry bills, the damage to buildings,
to say nothing of the danger to public health, and there
is clearly a case for studying the smog phenomenon and
investigating what steps may be taken to control it.
A beginning has now been made in Mexico. On the
one hand the Institute of Applied Science is continuing
its work and is making a special study of carbon dioxide
and carbon monoxide in the city air; the former be¬¨
cause it is the principal product of the combustion of any
kind of fuel and thus a good index of pollution ; the latter
because it is highly toxic and is produced in quite large
quantities by automobiles.
On the other hand, the Mexican Ministry of Health has
set up a special air pollution section in its Department of
Industrial Hygiene, which has started a comprehensive
study not only of the smoke but also of. the gases which
are found in city air: sulphur dioxide, the oxides of
nitroyen, aldehydes, ammonia, etc. Many of them are
toxic or corrosive, even in very small
amounts.
We know that the smog exists, because
we can see it every day. We know it is a
nuisance and may easily become a danger.

SMOG IN THE TROPICS
(Continued)
But there are also many questions which must be
answered before effective steps can be taken to combat it.
What does the smog consist of, what kind of smoke,
grit and gases does it contain ? Where does it come from ?
From the large factories, from the oil refineries, from the
small industries, from homes or from the traffic ? What
quantities of each pollutant are produced every day ?
What proportion of these falls back on the city and what
proportion is carried away by the wind. When the
answers to these questions are known, but not before, it
will be possible to plan effective countermeasures.
Mexico City is but one of 'many cities in the tropics
which are growing rapidly and facing for the first time
the menace of smog. Many of the cities' are set in the
mountains and have delightful climates with abundant
sunshine and soft breezes, but it is just these climatic
amenities which aggravate the problem. Many industrial
cities of the north are habitable only because they are
washed and ventilated by rain and wind. In the calmer
tropics one cannot take such liberties with the atmosphere.
It is not to be used as a drain.
Governments and other authorities have two ways of
approach to the control of air pollution: education and
legislation. The technical methods to be employed vary
from one city to another, for no two cities have exactly
the same smog. Once the nature of the smog and its
principal sources are known, then the first step Will
probably be to ensure that the public in general, and in
particular those persons connected with activities which
produce the smog, are sufficiently informed of the
technical means available to reduce it.
These may be relatively simple and inexpensive, as for
instance when it is simply a matter of ensuring the more
16

efficient and smokeless combustion of oil fuel in furnaces;
or they may be more expensive and complicated, as in the
case of suppressing the emission of certain gases from
chemical works. But almost always the money invested
in devices for preventing emission of smoke or gases is
returned within a very short time in the form of. increased
efficiency or of saleable by-products. Perhaps the most
knotty technical problem yet to be solved is that of
suppressing the emission of harmful gases from auto¬¨
mobile exhausts.
When education and persuasion fail to produce the
desired results recourse may be had to legislation. Many
countries have by now adopted legal measures to enforce
the zoning of certain industries and to restrict the
emission of smoke and gases in urban areas.
In all aspects of the air pollution problem, in research,
in techniques of suppression, in public education and in
the drafting and enforcement of legislation, the highly
industrialized countries of the north have learned much
from experience which can be passed on to those which
are facing the danger for the first time. Civilization
implies, by its definition, the concentration of people in
cities, and the present tendency throughout the world in
this direction is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable
future.
The newly growing cities will avoid much trouble and
expense if they profit from the errors and experience of
the older industrial centres. In the interchange of
information and skills which this implies, the United
Nations, through its Specialised Agencies such as the
World Health Organization and Unesco, has certainly an
important part to play. >

Just over a year ago an archaeological-photographic
mission headed by Madame Anil de Silva, of Ceylon,
reached the mountain sanctuary of Maichishan, an
impressive treasure house of Buddhist art in N.W. China
which was unknown to the outside world for centuries
until it was rediscovered some 20 years ago. The exclu¬¨

of Ceylon, she is the author of "The Life of the Buddha"
(Phaidon Press, London, 1955) and two other works:
"Chinese Landscape Frescoes from Tun Huang" and
"Western Caves of Maichishan" shortly to be published.

The richest store . of Chinese Buddhist sculpture and
paintings which has become available to the world
recently lies in the cave chapels of Maichishan.
Maichishan, which means Corn Rick Mountain, so called
because of its shape, is situated in northwest China close
to Tien Shui, the town of Heavenly Water, on the railway
line running through the Yellow River basin from Peking
to Sian and Lanchow. Two hundred years ago, the wooden
galleries projecting along the West facade of this moun¬¨

tructed four years ago no one was able to enter them.
All this region has had a continuous history from
neolithic times and Sian itself, the ancient capital of
China, has been a centre of civilization for thousands of
years. Prom Tien Shui one drives across rich countryside
cultivated with maize, alternating with soya bean, melons
and egg plants. The roads are lined with weeping willows
and poplars, and children, like golden fish, swim- in the
rivers and pools. Gradually, as one draws near the
thickly wooded slopes of the western extremity of the
Ch'in Ling mountains, Maichishan is seen rising out of
this wooded countryside, a tall ancient pagoda topping
its summit. It is described in The Idle Tales of the Jade
Hall written in the 10th century A.D.:
"'In the North the Maichi range bestrides the counties
of Ching Shui and Weichow. In the South it touches the
county of Liang Tang. Maichishan stands halfway among
the ridges and peaks spread over five hundred li. It is
a great rock rising abruptly a million fathoms high,
perfectly circular in appearence resembling the shape of
a peasant's corn rick, after which it is named. On the
precipitous walls of its upper half, among the blue clouds,
were carved many Buddha figures and a thousand
chambers in the rock to serve as niches for other figures.
Although this was the work of man, one might think it
the work of the Gods. In the year Hsun Wei at the end
of the Tan Dynasty, I climbed to this place and left an
inscription..."
Another inscription formerly in the Hall of the Buddhas
is very vivid:
"A path like a ladder to the clouds was constructed on
the face of the rock... as if one were to mount a carriage
and pierce the mountain, carving out great niches,
bestriding the peak ridge and infinite medley of stars
overhead, all the land spinning far below. The walls are
covered with sacred inscriptions, the niches multiplied
with images of the Buddha. A Moon Disc Palace is
carved and a Hall of Mirrored Flowers."
Maichishan however was started very
much earlier than the 10th century. In
420 A.D. a Buddhist monk, T'an Hung,
retired to live there. Later he was joined
by another monk and soon three hundred
disciples had collected around them.

MAICHISHAN (Continued)
A CLIFF
WITH 30-FT
STATUES
As the traveller approaches the beetling
cliffs of Maichishan the first Inkling
he gets of the art treasures enshrined
In this tunnelled mountain are the giant
figures of Buddha set on the rocky
facades. On right ¬°s a detail of a
Sung Buddha (10th-11th century)\some
30 feet high, as seen from a nearby
gallery. Opposite page, another enor¬¨
mous statue of Buddha flanked by
attendants. Part of the significance
of Maichishan lies In the fact that here,
grouped together, is a unique collec¬¨
tion of large-scale modelled figures
dating from the 5th century down to
the 17th century A.D., for additions
to the caves and statuary were made
right to the end of the Ming dynasty.
The rock rises for about 500 ft. with colossal groups of
statues of the Buddha and attendants on its face. A
fissure in the centre divides Maichishan in two the
Western group and the Eastern group of caves. The Rai
Yin monastery lies at the foot of the rock surrounded by
thick jungle.
The Maichishan caves were excavated at various
periods, the earliest dated inscription in one of them being
of the 5th century during the time of the Northern Wei
Emperors. Today there are 194 cave-chapels, ranging
in size from as large as churches and abbeys, to as small
as shrines* All the walls were covered with frescoes and
numerous statues of the Buddha, Bodhisattvas, attendant
figures, disciples, lay donors, both men and Women,
guardians of the four cardinal points, apsaras or celestial
nymphs carrying offerings of flowers and incense,
heavenly musicians playing the harp, flute or cymbals.
For centuries all these have waited patiently to be re¬¨
discovered in the dim recesses of the caVes.
The names of the caves themselves are evocative: The
Hall of a Myriad Buddhas; The Nirvana Cave^ The Hall
of the Bull; The Gallery of the Thousand Buddhas; The
Hall of Scattering Flowers; The Cave of Heaven. In
ancient times wooden galleries had been constructed on
the face of the rock so that pilgrims and worshippers
could walk between them. The remains of the old
galleries destroyed by fire are seen in the long wooden
stakes which protrude from the face. The difficulty of
reconstructing the damaged galleries can hardly be
conceived, and carpenters did heroic work, using the old
stakes and sockets on the beetling cliff wall as they
climbed 150 ft. or more above the ground. .
The Gallery of a Thousand Buddhas carved during the
N.Wei dynasty (5th century A.D.) is about 100 feet long.
The figures are modelled in clay over a core of rock. As
one walks along this gallery with the figures on one side
and a sheer drop of hundreds of feet on the .other, it is
truly like a path in the clouds for on some days the
clouds float by on a level with the caves.
Though Maichishan was started under the N.Wei
Emperors (a Wei Empress actually retiring and living in
the monastery of Rai Yin) there were continual additions
in caves and statues right up to the Ming period in the
15th-17th Century A.D. It seems to have escaped the
effects of the three great persecutions of Buddhism,
known as the "Calamity of the Three Wus'". Each of
them lasted only a few years but great damage was done.
Thousands of temples with their famous frescoes were
destroyed; bronze statues and bells melted down; and in
the first persecution alone (444 A.D.) 260,000 monks and
nuns were forcibly returned to secular life.
Not one in a thousand dares
to climb to the Cave of Heaven
An enormous stone Buddha and two attendant figures
apparently of the Northern Chou period, under one
of whose Emperors the second persecution took place,
had been brought, no-one 'knows how or from where, and
placed in the highest cave, the Cave . of Heaven, most
certainly for safe keeping. A 10th-century description
shows how difficult a task this must have been: "Further
up from the last chamber there is still another excavation
in the rock called Heaven. It is reached by climbing a
single ladder suspended over space. Not one man in a
thousand has the nerve for this climb."
The Hall of a Myriad Buddhas is one of the largest of
these, caves and is elaborately constructed. Again we are
told, "ascending a hanging ladder from the western alcove
there are one thousand rooms and a myriad chambers.

The Unesco Courier. March 1959
The e.dge is unprotected and from it one steps on to air;
in climbing none dares look over his shoulder. Climbing
to the top one discovers a Hall of a Myriad Bodhisattavas,
more spacious than any of the great halls of ancient or
modern times. Carved beams, painted struts, carved
ceiling ridges and lintels with reliefs of clouds all are
cut out of the living rock."
Here the entire wall surface is covered with either
frescoes or thousands of impressed plaster figures of the
Buddha painted in bright colours. The great T'ang
Buddha standing at the entrance is about 18 feet high, his
hands extended in blessing over the figure of a disciple.
This cave, which is sometimes called the Cave of Tablets,
has 20 stone tablets carved with scenes from the life of
the Buddha and with sacred symbols. All the statues
and stone tablets were painted, and the centuries having
done their work, the paint is now of a delicate and
wonderful beauty.
The frescoes on the walls are rare examples of 5th and
6th century murals. There are scenes of battles,
processions of nobles and ladies, flying figures, donors,
disciples, figures of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas,
hunting scenes, palaces, forts and the everyday life of
those times.
The Emperors and Empresses who contributed to the
building of monuments like Maichishan employed
thousands of stone, cutters, sculptors and painters on
the face of the living, rock, creating such monuments as
the caves of Tun Huang, the P'ing Line temple, Yun Kang,
Lung Men and Maichishan which are undoubtedly
among the marvels of the Asian world. Though the Wei
and T'ang rulers did most to build up these magnificent
monuments to their faith, all the imperial houses in fact
encouraged and participated in this work.
For instance one of the Emperors of the short-lived
Sui dynasty (589-618 A.D.) ordered the construction of
nearly 4,000 temples, repaired one and a half million old
images and made 10,000 new ones of gold, ivory, bronze,
sandalwood, lacquer and stone.
At Maichishan we have excellent examples of the art of
all the various styles and periods, particularly the Wei
period which produced some of the most spiritual and
beautiful religious art in the world.
Most of the figures are modelled and are unique exam¬¨
ples of some of the largest sculpture of this type found
either in China or elsewhere. The rock of Maichishan
is not well suited for carving and the stone groups and
tablets found there were certainly brought from other
places, probably for safe keeping during troublous times.
Many scholars and poets came to the caves during the
years; some wrote verses and often carved them on the
cave walls. Wang Jen-yu, a poet of the T'ang period,
climbed to the Hall of Heaven; "'Looking down from this
position", he said, "one discerns the mass of mountains
like a low bank:
I have climbed the full length of the myriad-fathom
ladder suspended over space,
Making my idle body the co-equal for the white clouds.
Beyond the caves and far below how small the
mountains!
From the hall the level rays of the setting sun seem
low;
At the peak the road is perilous, few men can reach so
far.
On the aged cliff the pines are sturdy, the cranes love
to dwell there.
I would leave my name in this distant place beyond the
horizon,
So dusting the rocks I diligently inscribe these words."

LADDERS TO THE CLOUDS. Wooden
galleries and stairways were built in ancient
times on the face of the rock so pilgrims
could walk between them. Those projecting
on the West side were destroyed by fire
some two centuries ago. The caves on
this facade were therefore inaccessible
until a few years ago when the galleries
were rebuilt. Last year, after these photo¬¨
graphs were taken, the galleries were
again damaged, this time by an earth¬¨
quake. Entry to the caves is now unsafe.
One inscription formerly in the Hall of the
Buddhas vividly describes them: "A path
like a ladder to the clouds was constructed
on the face of the rock... as if one were
to mount a carriage and pierce the moun¬¨
tain, carving out great niches, bestriding
the peak ridge and an infinite medley of
stars overhead, all the land spinning far
below." (Below, view from cliff gallery.)
THE GALLERY OF A THOUSAND
BUDDHAS (left) dating from the
5th century A.D. has been described
as "a path in the clouds." Here,
figures modelled in clay over a core
of rock and protected by the over¬¨
hanging cliff, line one side of the
long gallery ; on the other there is
a sheer drop of hundreds of feet.

MAICHISHAN (Continued)
A HALO OF FLYIN mSmm
Behind the heads of the Buddhas, Boddhisattvas
and other figures, the ancient Buddhistartists often
made a halo or a nimbus on the walls of shrines
and chapels. They first painted the nimbus and then
placed the modelled figures in position. Thus they .
made a conscious effort to combine the elements
of relief and painting. In China the early haloes were
simply concentric circles of colour and the nimbus
bore flame and cloud motifs with flying apsaras
(celestial nymphs). Later the flame motif became
more complicated and elaborate, flowing figures
were placed round the nimbus. Similar developments
took place in India where haloes progressed from
the simplicity of the earlier sculpture to the elabo¬¨
rateness of later periods (5th-6th century A.D.).
Details on these pages, photographed at Maichishan,
include an apsara carrying an offering, a heavenly
musician playing the harp and other celestial figures,
enlarged from nimbus shown serving as background
to stone Buddha in upper right photo, opposite page.

IMAGES OF SERENITY. Some remarkable examples of Buddhist iconography from the caves of Maichishan. (1) Two Boddhi-
sattvas, or potential Buddhas, modelled in clay and painted. They have been depicted in. a most unusual "cheek to cheek" pose
which suggests two people in intimate conversation. The tenderness and gentle expression they reflect is typical of Wei Period
sculpture. (2) Lay devotee modelled in clay and painted in the 6th century. (The same figure photographed from another angle
appears on our back cover.) (3 and 4) Heads of two Boddhisattvas whose serenity of expression places them among the great
manifestations of religious art. The face of the second figure recalls the "smiling angel" of the Cathedral of Reims and, like No.2,
is reminiscent of French Gothic sculpture. (5) Modelled and painted head of a donor, dating from T'ang (8th-9th century) period.

as the Cave of the Tablets from its

and given them a rare and delicate

as well. Smoke is pouring out of a number of automobiles,
and many citizens will be thankful when persistent
violators of this kind are forced to have a piston ring
job done on their old automobiles. Diesel engines, foun¬¨
dries, steel mills and many others contribute dust and
smoke particles to the air. Means for the control of these
sources are known, and it is only a question of how badly
clean air is wanted, and whether the people are willing
to pay the price.
Acute problems, such as that in Los Angeles, - have
focussed attention on cleanliness of the air, and have
stimulated a great deal of interest all over the U.S.A.
Symptoms of Los Angeles type smog, such as typical crop
damage, have appeared in other metropolitan areas in
the United States, as well as in Europe. Unusually high
ozone concentrations have been measured in the San
Francisco and San Diego (California) areas, and this type
of air pollution is bound to increase, making its entry
when some of the more common types of pollution with
soot and sulphur dioxide begin to disappear.
Inversion conditions, while prevalent on th√© Pacific
Coast, may appear elsewhere at less frequent intervals
and since no one is prepared for such attacks, disasters
develop, as in Belgium and Donora. To avoid such
happenings it is necessary to guard against unnecessary
pollution of the air at all times. The efforts spent in
cleaning the air are by no means to be considered as
waste. On the contrary, the materials which used to go
into the air are often valuable. In addition, corrosion
problems are solved, maintenance costs become less, and
fire hazards diminish.
No wonder that at the present time U.S. Government
agencies, Public Health officials, as well as private
organizations and universities have large program¬¨
mes under way to investigate air pollution. These
students of air pollution are faced with an overwhelming
number of problems.
Every reduction in the harmful emissions from the
industrial plants is but a partial one, and a small
percentage of the pollutants still escapes to the air. The
reduction in the pollution from automobiles through
exhaust devices or improvements in engine performance
will probably be, in practice, not much better than
seventy-five per cent. With the present increase in the
number of automobiles, ten or twenty years qf increasing
automobile population would practically wipe out all our
gains. At that time, however, a further reduction in
.emission will be considerably more difficult and expensive.
Air pollution control measures for industry and the
automobile have to be refined to keep up with the
increasing population. The study of means of controlling
the emission of pollutants, and the development of' equip¬¨
ment and instrumentation, will be a steady diet at our
universities and technological institutes. At these
institutions courses will be given on how to plan a city in
order to ensure clean air to its inhabitants. Discussions
will be held on the size of breathing areas in the form of
spacious parks, the needs and forms of rapid public
transportation, and revolutionary proposals such as the
relocation of industries and the establishment of
community air purification plants and other similar
projects which may seem fantastic at this time.
We should not forget that the need for control has only
one tendency, and that is to become more urgent. It is
only through vigilance, through planning and positive
action that we can keep abreast of this more difficult
problem and keep the air fit to breathe in. the atomic age.

### 64973: Karl von Frisch to be awarded Kalinga Prize
KARL VON FRISCH
TO BE AWARDED
KALINGA PRIZE
Karl von Frisch,
famed for his find¬¨
ings on the "lan¬¨
guage" of bees and
considered' the most
distinguished living
investigator of the
sensorial physiology
of insects and fishes,
will be awarded the
¬£1,000 Kalinga Prize
for the populariza¬¨
tion of science on
March 26, at Unesco
House in Paris.
Professor von
Frisch is the author
of over a hundred
scientific works, the
most remarkable of
which deal .with his research into the world
of bees (Dancing Bees: an account of the life
and s√ünses of the honey bee, 1955; Bees, their
Vision, Chemical Senses and Language. 1951).
. The studies, written in a simple, non-technical
style, helped to solve the mystery of how
insects as Well as birds possess such an
uncanny sense of direction. Von Frisch
showed that the eyes of bees see polarized
light in the sky, thus enabling them to
distinguish zones of different shades by which
they can orient themselves. Most startling of
all, he revealed that bees, after discovering
a good source of nectar, return to the hive
and perform a ballet dance to communicate
the distance and direction of the food to the
other members of the hive.
Born in Vienna in 1886, Professor von Frisch
studied medicine and natural science in his
native city and in Munich. Successively
director of the zoological institutes of the
Universities of Rostock, Breslau, Graz and
Munich, he retired last April and now lives in
Munich. His other books include You and
Life (A . Modern Biology for Everyman),
Memoirs of a Biologist, and works on the
sense of hearing and the colour-sense of
fishes.
The Kalinga Prize is awarded by the Kalinga
Foundation (State of Orissa, India). Its
winner is chosen annually by an international
jury appointed by Unesco; its purpose is to
offer recognition to leading interpreters of
science and also to strengthen links between
India and scientists of all nations. Last year
the prize was awarded to Lord Bertrand
Russell of the United Kingdom. (See The
Unesco Courier February 1958.)

F REEDOM FROM HUNGER:
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Orga¬¨
nization has chosen 1963 as a target
year for its campaign to mobilize and
enlighten world opinion regarding the
possibilities and problems of freeing
the World from hunger. Preparations
for the campaign will include a third
World Food Survey to highlight the
situation of food supplies in relation
to population and nutrition especially
in less-developed countries; a study of
the possibilities of increasing food
production and an evaluation of na¬¨
tional and international arrangements
and policies for distribution and trade
governing agricultural products.
These measures will culminate in a
World Food Congress in 1963 covering
the whole field of food supplies and
needs.
INTERNATIONAL FILM AND
TV COUNCIL: Delegates from 24
organizations covering every aspect
of the 'cinema and television
from film production to the
tastes of spectators met in Paris
recently, adopted a programme
and elected officers for the newly-
created International Film and
Television Council. The pro¬¨
gramme adopted by the Council
will makfi for closer co-operation
in the cinema and TV world, and
includes the publication of a
quarterly bulletin and a calendar
of festivals and other international
. events, as well as the setting up of
specialized committees to deal
with such questions, as the possi-
bilities of standardizing film for¬¨
mats so as to facilitate the wider
use of films. The Council is also
sponsoring a conference on the
provisi√≥n of suitable TV films for
children, to. be organized later this
year in Great Britain by the Inter¬¨
national Centre for . Children's
Films.
S<ICHOOL IN THE FAR NORTH:
Lessons in ¬°kayak-building and dog-
team driving supplement the three
R's in the curriculum of a boarding
school at Thule in the north of
Greenland. Boys also learn har¬¨
pooning and the use of firearms
while girls are taught to sew skins.
In Iceland, itinerant teachers are still
considered to be the best available
answer to the problem of educating
children in sparsely populated dis¬¨
tricts. The teacher travels from one
farm to another and children from
nearby homes come daily to the farm
where the class is held.
TRAVEL GRANTS FOR YOUTH:
During 1959 Unesco is again offer¬¨
ing international travel grants
to enable young men and women
from youth and student orga¬¨
nizations to visit their .opposite
numbers abroad. These grants
give youth leaders, who act as
envoys both of their countries and
of their particular groups, a
chance to see how other countries
organize their group activities, to
make useful contacts and then to
put this experience to use on their
return.
J. HE U.S.SJR. 'COUNTS NOSES':
Something like 600,000 enumerators
were in action when the U.S.S.R.
carried out its first population census
since 1939. The census took place in
January, but preparations started
many months earlier so as to cover
the vast expanses of the Union. In
such remote spots as the Pamir
mountains and the offshore islands
of Siberia, census takers, travelling
by camel, helicopter, dog-sled or on
foot, had a ten days start on the rest
of the enumerators. Citizens of the
U.S.S.R. were tabulated according to
where they were at midnight on
January 14, and a time limit of eight
days was allowed for completion of
the work. Results of the census are
expected to be announced in April.
MENTAL HEALTH YEAR: The
idea of organizing worldwide cam¬¨
paigns over a period of a year to
tackle specific scientific problems
is appealing more and more to
scientists. One of the latest exam¬¨
ples is the World Mental Health
Year to be held in 1960 under the
auspices of the World Federation of
Mental Health. During this Year
there will be studies of children's
needs ; national surveys in mental
health and ill-health; training of
medical and other personnel in the
principles of mental health; inves¬¨
tigation of the sociological aspects
of industrial change and the psy¬¨
chological problems of migration.
The theme for World Health Day
1959, on April 7, will be "Mental
Health", announces the World
Health Organization.
* Trailer schools': in the
United States some 40 "trailer
schools" are used to bring education
to Navajo Indian children living in
remote areas. Each of these schools-
on-wheels consists of a group of
house trailers constructed for school
use, for housing the teaching staff,
and for transporting a classroom
which can be erected in sections in
the centre of a community. Children
from an entire region attend as day
pupils, receive two meals a day and
are often taken to school by bus.
This type of school is preferred to
boarding schools as it enables the
children to remain in contact with
their families and social envronment.
'OPERATION MUSEUM': A na¬¨
tional campaign known as "Ope¬¨
ration Museum" has been launched
in Belgium with the aim of bring¬¨
ing together the people of the
country and the art treasures
housed in its museums. Orga¬¨
nized by the Belgian Directorate
of Museums and the Belgian
Tourist Bureau, the six-month
campaign will include a "treasure
hunt" tourist organizations will
publish photographs of well-known
art works from, museums which
the public will be asked to identify.
Schoolchildren will prepare sou¬¨
venir albums devoted to a museum
of their choice, and the albums
will afterwards be sent to schools
in other countries.
VOLUNTEERS INVITED FOR 1959
INTERNATIONAL WORK CAMPS
A chance to visit a foreign country and take part in voluntary community
work is offered to young people joining one of the numerous international
voluntary work camps being organized this year in many parts of the
world. A provisional list of the 1959 camps which has just been issued by the
Co-ordination Committee for International Voluntary Work Camps gives brief
details of projects planned in 57 countries and territories.
A feature of this year's list is the number of camps being held in various
parts of Africa: 14 countries and territories will be receiving international
volunteers to work on projects such as the construction of a leprosy centre at
Harar in Ethiopia, the construction of homes for earthquake victims in Algeria,
and agricultural and community development in many others.
As in previous years, a wide choice of camps exists in Europe, while in Asian
countries, India and Japan offer varied opportunities in different branches of
community work.
Projects are grouped according to geographical location, and the organization
responsible for each camp is given. In general, volunteers are required to pay
their fares to the camp, but free board and lodging is provided on the spot.
The list can be obtained from the Co-ordination Committee for International
Voluntary Work Camps, Unesco; 2 Place de Fontenoy, Paris 7".

Letters to the Editor
A world school flag
Sir,
Groups, societies and the nations of
the world have flags or emblems, but
the schools do not. A flag or emblem
should be adopted. Its lower half
should be of a vivid green colour to
symbolize the virtues and the energies
and the hopes of our schoolchildren and
young people. Its upper half should be
of gold to remind us that all the hope
and wealth and future of the world will
come from its younger generation. In
the centre, half in the green and half in
the gold, could be the silver figure of a.
school book or some other internation¬¨
ally recognized school implement.
In case the designation were a flag, it
might be fringed with green and gold
mixed, and cords and tassels of the same
colours might be fixed at the head of the
staff. It should be displayed in the same
general manner as the International Red
Cross flag. If the designation were used
as an emblem, it could be employed in
case of war to identify all school houses
and institutions of higher learning. Cer¬¨
tainly a world school flag or emblem
would be just recognition of all those
who are engaged in the pursuit of edu¬¨
cation, learning and advancement.

NETHERLANDS' SECOND TONGUE
Sir,
In your December 1958 issue a
Netherlands' reader, Marian Gobius,
contested, the statement of Sir Ben'
Bowen Thomas that the Netherlands is
a bilingual country. Mr. Gobius
wrote: "This is very definitely not so.
We have- many, dialects, of course, but
only Dutch is spoken. Or was Sir Ben
thinking of 'Double' Dutch'?"
Of course there is only one Dutch
language in the Netherlands. A section
of the Dutch people, however, does
speak another language West Frisian
which is not "Double Dutch", but a
language in its own right, and a very
old one.
West Frisian is spoken today
throughout the province of Friesland,
with the exception of the chief city,-
Leeuwarden, and it was once . spoken
over a wide area including the north¬¨
west part of the northern Netherlands,
part of northern Germany and the area
between Germany and Denmark.
It is taught as a language in several
universities, but in the West Frisian
schools Dutch' is the first language.
Some children hardly know any Dutch
when they first go to school as they are
to speak Frisian at home.
West Frisians are trying to get their
language officially recognized for use in
courts, churches etc...

Sir,
I hesitate to take issue with a Dutch¬¨
man about his own country, but I
think Mr. Gobius was in error when
he scolded Sir Ben Bowen Thomas for
referring to the Netherlands as a
bilingual country. What the newly-
elected Chairman of the Executive
Board of Unesco was referring to was
presumably the fact that a bilingual
problem does exist in the province of
Friesland, where many thousands of
good Dutchmen speak West Frisian or
one of its dialects in their homes. The
Frisians themselves have no doubt
about the existence of the bilingual
problem, "De Twatalichheit" as they
call it in their own language, and the
Netherlands educational and broad¬¨
casting systems give Frisians in Fries-
land special privileges.
West Frisian has a rich, cultural
tradition and is of all the Germanic
languages the one which stands closest
to English, especially in vocabulary.
Centuries ago fishermen and traders
from the South-East corner of England,
who had frequent contacts with their
Frisian neighbours, used to recite a
couplet which is still apposite today:
"Good butter and good cheese
Is good English and good Fries."

CURRENT & COMING EVENTS
Sir,
I have been a subscriber to your
excellent magazine since January 1957,
when it first appeared in Russian. I
feel, however, that it has one small
shortcoming: it seems to be far too pre¬¨
occupied with the things, of the past
whereas, in fact, it should show more
interest in present-day affairs and with
the world of tomorrow. I should like
to see some special issues on such
subjects as the cinema, jazz and painting
today - and tomorrow. Science and
technology dealt with in the same
context would also provide instructive
and interesting material, as would
themes on problems in such fields as
longevity, astronautics and cybernetics.
Finally, let us hear about current trends
in philosophical, political and religious
thinking...
V.S. Marin
Moscow, U.S.S.R.
Editor's note: The future of science
and technology was the subject of last
month's issue. The problems of longe¬¨
vity were dealt with in the October 1958
issue. Astronautics will rbe discussed
in a special issue now in preparation.
Most of the other subjects suggested by
our reader will be dealt with in future
issues of The Unesco Courier.
WHERE TO WRITE FOR PEN FRIENDS
In its February 1958 issue, The Unesco Courier stated
that it could no longer publish requests from readers
wishing to make pen friends. Since then many requests
have come in from new readers who missed the announcement,
and these have been passed to the International Federation of
Organizations for Scholastic Exchanges (Fioces) at 29 Rue
d'Ulm, Paris, which has been kind enough to deal with them.
Fioces has more than 60 affiliates in some 20 countries (a
partial list was published in our February 1958 issue) and
readers can obtain the addresses of. these national affiliates
by writing to Fioces in Paris. The aim of. many of these
organizations is to find pen friends for young people of school
age, although some do concern themselves with corres¬¨
pondence between young adults. Alternatively, readers in the
older age groups may wish. to use the services of some pen
friends' clubs whose organizers have written to The Unesco
Courier. These clubs are: Cercle de Correspondence
Culturelle, M. Aubertin, 4, Avenue de l√† Porte-Brancion,
Paris 15*, France (Exchanges of ideas and views to promote
international understanding; open to all and free of charge;
members include artists, writers and teachers; each member
receives a list from which to choose a correspondent); Rao
International Pen Pals Club, 11 Biram Bagh, Jodhpur, India;
The International Youth Friendship, Department of Corres¬¨
pondence, P.O. Box 66, Pforzheim, Federal Republic of
Germany. Readers are reminded that when writing to Fioces
or to the other organizations they should enclose an inter¬¨
national reply coupon, and that all requests for pen friends
should include sender's name and address (in block letters),
age, status and interests.
readers are asked once again not to send pen friend
requests to the unesco courier.

radioisotopes
in the service
of man
by Fernand LOT
unesco
Never a day passes without
newspapers and magazines
reporting some new applica¬¨
tion of artificial radio-active
elements: tumours removed
by radio-active iodine or
treated by "cobalt bombs,"
insecticides developed by
"marked" mosquitoes, hither¬¨
to impossible diagnoses today
achieved through radio-act¬¨
ive isotopes. Isotopes play an
ever-increasing part in an
ever-widening range of fields:
analysis of metals and lubri¬¨
cants, petroleum research, oc√©anographie investigations and even the fixing of geo¬¨
logical and historical events. How is all this made possible^ The answers are given
ih an 80-page publication, "Radio-isotopes in the Service of Man," in the series "Unesco
and Its Programme." The author, Mr. Fernand Lot, traces the history of the new
"pure gold" of modern alchemists, from the discovery of natural radio-activity to the
latest uses of the latest discoveries in that field.
The author leads the reader into the heart of the atom, shows how the atom disintegrates,
how the radiations are produced, how reactors operate, how physicists, medical doctors,
biologists, chemists and agronomists make use of the astonishing results of the experi¬¨
ments of Becquerel, Rutherford and the Curies which have given us the amazing key
to a new era.
Price: U.S. SI. 00; 5/- (stg); 300 FF
Last year some 165,000 students enrolled for
higher education in countries other than their own.
This fact alone shows the usefulness of this most
popular Unesco handbook. Volume X, just pub¬¨
lished, brings you the latest information on 75,000
fellowships and scholarships offered by govern¬¨
ments, universities, foundations and other institu¬¨
tions in 109 countries and territories. A new
system of classification will help you to find rapidly
all the details: who can study what subjects and
where, what is the amount of each award and how
and where applications may be made.
An invaluable manual for anyone contemplating
study in a foreign country. An indispensable
reference book for all libraries, universities and
information centres. A useful instrument in
promoting educational contacts throughout the
world.
Price: U.S. S3.00; 15/- (stg); 900 FF. 780 pages.
