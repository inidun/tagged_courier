The infinite variety of life is one of the most intriguing
topics for nature-lovers and for scientists whose lives
are devoted to understanding the world. Part of its
fascination is the amazing adjustment of plants and animals
to the various conditions of living. Through countless
generations of the slow process of mutation they have gradu¬
ally altered not only their habits but their anatomy and
physiology to fit them for life in the depths of the sea, the
jungle tree tops or even beneath the soil. Each species is
marvellously fitted to a specific type of environment, but
each is also unfitted for life in a different one.
There is only one species of animal that has the ability
to live anywhere on earth except under water: man. He
has adapted not so much by changing his nature in the
course of generations as merely by adapting the environment
to himself by inventing clothes for cold weather, shelter
against the storms, fire for making hard foods edible, and
tools to master the soil. Man has made almost every patch
of the earth somehow habitable.
Yet there are large areas that are almost deserted by man
and where only those men live whose wants are meagre and
who thrive on solitude. "'Terra deserta", the Romans called
these deserted areas whence the modern word "desert".
They need not be hot, for there are deserts in the Arctic
and on cold high plateaus. But a desert is always dry, its
vegetation is sparse, animals rare and men poor. In the
deserts, neither ancient nor modern science has accomplish¬
ed much improvement.
One practical definition of science is that it is the best
use of the human intelligence to improve the conditions
under which we live. Thus, the desert still is one of the
greatest challenges to mankind and to science. More than
one-fourth of the entire land area of the earth is almost
useless because it has too much sun, not enough rain. To
improve living conditions in the desert may require Improving
the climate or at least the weather, and both of these have
everywhere been beyond man's control.
Before science can act it must understand. It needs to
know the cause of dryness and the reasons for lack of rain;
it must understand the geological structure of rocks and
the types of soil and of sand in order to find underground
water. It must understand what means are used by desert
plants and animals to thrive and live so happily in austerity;
it must know the wind and the sun and know how to
harness them and use their energy to improve living
conditions. Furthermore, the problem is so vast that it
involves the lives of people of at least 37 nations. No single
nation can accomplish much but what one does can benefit
all. The problem of the arid lands is therefore an inter¬
national one, to be solved by the best use of the human
intelligence on a world scale. It has for this reason
demanded the attention of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization since it was first organ¬
ized.
Practical progress has been slow, but the growth of under¬
standing has not. Small successes in adjustment have
appeared, such as the use of dew for plant growth; applying
the lessons that the camel can teach; the prevention of the
spread of the desert through misuse of the marginal areas.
Further successes seem imminent such as the location of
underground water, the use of the wind for operating local
wells, the use of sunshine for cooking, and perhaps even the
production of fresh water from the sea for use in irrigation.
This is one of the liveliest of the scenes where science is now
at work.
Because so much of Unesco's efforts has gone into this
many-sided problem this issue of the Unesco Courier is a
review of the present status of the great campaign to make
the deserts habitable and to extend man's realm to the
farthest, driest and in many ways pleasantest regions of
this planet.

### 69031: One quarter of the earth is arid; a major UNESCO problem
A major
Unesco problem
ONE QUARTER OF THE EARTH
IS ARID
by James Swarbrick
One of the purposes of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization is to
improve the living conditions of man¬
kind through scientific research. Very
soon after Unesco was organized this
high purpose came down to earth as
the fact was faced that more than one
quarter of the land area of the earth
is able to support but a thin population
at a very low standard of living because
it lacks sufficient water.
The arid zone sweeps across the map
from the Atlantic across the Sahara in
North Africa into Arabia, Pakistan and
on across the great Gobi in China.
Another band runs north and south
close to the Pacific Coast almost from
Alaska to the tip of South America,
with only a wet gap in Central Ame¬
rica. A large part of South Africa is
arid, as is all but the eastern rim of
Australia. In all of them the problems
are similar if not the same.
They were, in fact, under attack in
many lands, but independently and
separately. Unesco's first action was a
survey of research already in progress
which resulted in a directory of almost
100 research institutions, devoted at
least partly to aridity, in 23 countries
and this did not include the Soviet
nations which were not then members
of Unesco. The survey also showed
that most of the research was
concentrated in those countries that
were arid only in part, like the United
States, and thus had enough wealth
from their rich areas to support
research. The wholly arid countries,
which needed it most, could not afford
it. Clearly joint international action,
which would focus many special
sciences on the problem, offered the
only solution and, if successful, would
benefit the arid lands everywhere.
Hidden waters
What Unesco attempts to achieve
through its arid zone programme
is to stimulate an awareness in
all countries of the aridity problem, to
foster research directed towards its
solution, and to spread the knowledge
needed to apply the results of research
to common use. The work is conducted
under the guidance of an "Advisory
Committee on Arid Zone Research",
with nine members who come from dif¬
ferent countries and who are experts
James SWARBRICK is in charge of Unesco's Arid Lands
Programme and is secretary of the Unesco Advisory
Committee on Arid Zone Research. A specialist in
chemistry, he was formerly a science officer with the
British Council.
in the different sciences involved. The
Committee sessions are attended by
representatives of the United Nations,
of the Specialized Agencies that have
arid zone interests, (such as the Food
and Agriculture Organization, the
World Health Organization and the
World Meteorological Organization)
and of some international organizations
of scientists and engineers, such as
the International Union of Geography
and the World Power Conference.
One great- problem common to all
arid areas is the lack of water. This
may be absolute, because no rain or
very little rain falls, or it may be rela¬
tive, because what rain does fall is not
available to support a utilizable vege¬
tation. So in some arid areas the
problem is to find water supplies, and
in others the population must be pro¬
tected against drought, and planned
use made of what water there is.
When rain falls on the ground, some
of it remains in the upper levels of the
soil and either is used by plants or is
evaporated. Some of the rain, however,
sinks into the earth, where it may be
drained away by streams and rivers, or
it may remain underground, travelling
very slowly through permeable rocks.
If these rocks can be reached from the
surface by boring, then the water can
be lifted by pumps and used for drink¬
ing purposes and for irrigating the
soil; or, if the water-bearing rock is
between two impermeable strata, the
water will gush out as an artesian well.
Rainfall in arid areas, though defi¬
cient, often results in floods which
cause erosion, since the water loosens
and carries away with it the upper soil
later. Thus not only is the water
wasted but the land is impoverished.-
The damming of rivers and the building
of reservoirs to impound flood water
are thus imperative. At the present
time India leads the world in irrigation
from rivers, but the planned develop¬
ment of river resources advances wher¬
ever rivers flow through arid areas.
Evaporation from the surface of
impounded water can represent a seri¬
ous loss in arid areas. The construc¬
tion of deeper reservoirs with less
surface is one way of reducing the loss.
A more radical solution is to allow the
water to seep underground through
specially prepared percolation beds and
store it there to be pumped up as
required.
If an economic method could be
devised whereby the salts could be
removed from sea-water and from salty
underground water which is all too
frequently found, perhaps the greatest

Unesco has just completed a
special film entitled " Beni-
Abbes Science in the De¬
sert " which shows the
work of a desert research
station in the south Alge¬
rian desert. This film will

single step would have been taken
towards desert reclamation. Unesco is
now giving this problem special atten¬
tion. The map of the world's deserts
(page 8) shows that many of them
lie along the coasts, especially the west¬
ern coasts of the continental land
masses. The coastal deserts of Chile
and Peru are extreme examples. With
the sea in sight, water has to be
brought by pipe line or even by railway
tank cars from the other side of the
Andes. But so far no process has been
discovered to remove that salt from sea
water at a cost that permits the large-
scale utilization of fresh water. An¬
other possibility of increasing water
supply is to provoke rainfall artificially.
In recent years much research has been
devoted to it, with considerable
success but with no certain method
yet established. (See page 51.)
A problem secondary only to that of
water supplies in arid areas is the
provision of energy. It is needed for
pumping water, for domestic and farm
use, for industry, for the exploitation
of mineral wealth. It is needed above
all to remove the pressure that exists
in all arid areas to cut down trees and
shrubs for fuel. People whose imme¬
diate need is firewood do not take
willingly to conservation.
The prevention of the spread of
deserts is at least as important as the
reclamation of areas which have been
deserts for thousands of years. Land
on the fringes of deserts is in a very
delicate equilibrium, and unless great
care is exercised in using it, and especi¬
ally in cultivating it, this equilibrium
will be upset and the desert will
inexorably march on.
Dew-fed plants
The methods of preventing erosion
are now well known. They include
contour ploughing, the setting up
of wind breaks, the prevention of floods,
and above all scientific knowledge of
what a given area can and cannot
produce. Unfortunately these methods
are not always applied.
It is Unesco's purpose to guide and
correlate the many researches in all
these fields that are under way in a
score of countries and to make sure
that advances in knowledge in any
field and in any country are shared by
other research men throughout the
world. The Advisory Committee on
Arid Zones Research meets twice a year
for a detailed discussion of research
progress. Once a year one of the
topics is stressed as a subject of a
general symposium to which scientists
of the world are invited. The next
symposium will be held in Australia in
October 1955 and will be devoted to the
study of climate. In previous years the
meetings have been devoted to hydro¬
logy (the study of water supply) at An¬
kara in Turkey in 1952, on plant ecology
at Montpellier in France in 1953 and on
wind and solar energy at New Delhi,
India in 1954.
The Committee also authorizes a
number of general projects such as the
drawing of accurate maps of conditions
in arid lands. Funds are also allocated
for special research projects such as the
one on the physiology of the camel
(reported on page 28) and the study of
the role of dew in providing moisture
for plant growth, made by Prof. S. Duv-
devani of the Hebrew University in Je¬
rusalem. Prof. Duvdevani found that
certain plants can draw water from
dew through their leaves into the roots
and even into the soil for storage.
The Unesco Arid Zone Committee
also supports international meetings
that are sponsored locally. For in¬
stance, in the spring of 1955 the
Committee met with and assisted the
American Association for the Advance¬
ment of Science in the programme of
its International Arid Lands Meetings
at Albuquerque and Socorro, New
Mexico. This , series of meetings was
attended by nearly 500 scientists from
28 countries and by a large number of
farmers and business men from the
arid area of the southwestern United
States. In November of 1955 Unesco
will collaborate in a world meeting on
Applied Solar Energy at Phoenix,
Arizona, USA.
In addition, other departments of
Unesco are active in promoting the
interests of arid lands. The Exchange
of Persons Service annually awards a
number of fellowships to enable persons
from the arid lands to travel abroad
for training in new techniques and for
an exchange of information and expe¬
rience. So also the Technical Assis¬
tance Department of Unesco is able to
respond to requests from its member
states for assistance in projects of arid
zone development.
Thus a geophysical institute has been
established in Pakistan and a hydro-
geological institute in Turkey. A Unes¬
co mission is working in Mexico to
establish a research institute on atmos¬
pheric physics and hydrology with a
view to increasing the rainfall and
better control of the waters that fall.
Peru has asked for assistance in estab¬
lishing an institute for research in
Peruvian desert conditions. Other ex¬
perts have been sent to the Desert
Research Institute at Heliopolis in
Egypt to assist in extending its work,
and a survey of wind energy has been
carried out in Israel.
Deserts of stone
The residents of large cities are often
unconcerned about the desert and
do not realize that the cities are
themselves deserts of stone where no
food is given and water is spent largely
in sanitation. But to the people of one
fourth of the earth the lack of water
and the many related topics that have
been mentioned are basic to life itself.
While active research is in progress
much could be done if the media of
public education and information were
used to encourage the residents of dry
lands to apply the best of present
knowledge to their own farms and
communities and thus to advance the
conquest of the desert.

### 69033: Conquest of the desert; science accepts the challenge
Arid lands, wherever they may be located, especially if
they are hot, are characterized by intense blue skies
by day, immense distances in a shimmering atmos¬
phere, sparse vegetation and still sparser animal and human
population, with a limited and erratic rainfall of less than
ten inches in a good year. Yet we recall that great civili¬
zations were developed in arid areas crossed by great rivers,
the Tigris-Euphrates, the Indus and the Nile.
How big is the challenge so far as area goes? It is difficult
to get precise figures but it is generally believed that the
total land surface of the earth is of the order of twenty-five
thousand million acres and of this at present about two
thousand five hundred million, or ten percent, are under
some form of cultivation. But it is also estimated that
about six thousand four hundred million acres are arid, in
other words about one quarter of the
total land surface of the earth. That
is to say the arid area is just over two
and a half times as large as the pre¬
sently cultivated area.
The end of the First World War saw
the end of large scale settlement in,
and development of, new lands by
pioneering individuals in whom the
spirit of adventure or the desire for
a freer life was strong. Came the
Second World War with a startling
realization of the precarious way in
which most nations lived, a way
fraught with all the explosive possi¬
bilities of further bitter struggles
between peoples.
Today we know that Malthus was
just ahead of his time and we have
to ask ourselves whether adequate
food requirements of the people can

which used to be fertile in ancient times, and are now out of
use. I refer to the millions of acres in the valleys of the
Tigris-Euphrates, the Indus-Chenab and the Nile, in the dry
north of Ceylon where still are to be seen the remains of
ancient irrigation channels and reservoirs.
It is estimated that in Latin America over twelve million
acres are susceptible of development, and an area bigger
than Egypt's productive land is said to be available in the
middle Niger. The re-establishment of these ancient areas
and the development of new areas require the joint efforts of
research institutions, of governments and the instrumenta¬
lities of the United Nations such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), etc., and not
forgetting the international financial authorities.

all the technological experience avail¬
able to us. We suggest that two
possibilities arise, one a reduction in
the rate of growth of the population
of the world and the other an increase
in production of foodstuffs not only
just to feed people on a minimal diet
but on a diet nearer to the optimal.
With the control of the rate of popu¬
lation growth we arid zone people have
little or nothing to do. We do say,
however with regard to the second,
that it is possible to increase world
food supplies by increasing production
from present areas and by bringing
into production more land at present uneconomically used.
By applying technological knowledge to the fullest extent
in what are at present underproducing areas a great in¬
crease in food production by individual growers is possible.
India, for example, possesses irrigation works on a great scale
and nowhere else in the world is so large a population de¬
pendent on irrigation for food supplies and yet it is estimat¬
ed that less than ten per cent of the run-off of her rivers is
utilized.
When we come to consider the possibilities in arid lands it
is recognized that the efforts of individual growers can play
but a small part in the development of new areas of pro¬
duction or the re-establishment of production in great areas
Dr. B.T. DICKSON, British-born Australian botanist, is one of the leading world autho¬
rities on plant adaptation and biology of arid lands. He ¡oined the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia, in 1929. and became
the head of its Division of Plant Industry. The above article is a slightly
condensed version of a paper entitled. "The Challenge of Arid Land Research and
Development For the Benefit of Mankind" presented on the symposium of the Interna¬
tional Arid Lands Meetings in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, under the sponsorship
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It will be published
in unabridged form by the Association as part of the volume of proceedings.

Let us now look at some of the problems with which those
charged with arid land development have to deal. I propose
to list them under the following heads water, soils, plants,
animals and man, and give what must obviously be a very
sketchy outline of some of the salient features of each and
then come to a conclusion.
Water is placed first for obvious reasons and adequate
information about the water resources of a region is essential
to a safe usage of that water for full development in food
production, domestic use and industry. In the desert one
conserves every drop of water for the maintenance of life,
in great urban centres we turn a tap and water flows, but
sometimes restrictions are placed on turning those taps. In
other lands the fresh water from great mountain ranges
flows several thousand miles to the sea and constitutes a
fresh water delta of tremendous size in the ocean.
Whence comes the supply, great or small? The answer is
rainfall and this is the beginning of what is called the
hydrologie cycle. Some of the rain soaks into the ground,
some runs off in streams, some is evaporated and
some transpired by vegetation. That which is ' ont on
evaporated or transpired by plants, like stream next page)

waters, may travel great distances, but ultimately it again
falls somewhere as rain, snow, hail, fog or dew.
In tropical areas rainfall may actually be beyond the
capacity of man to use, as with the Amazon, but in arid and
semi-arid areas rainfall is low and every effort must be made
to conserve usage to the best ends. This applies even when
an arid area is using imported precipitation as in Egypt,
where the Nile valley is dependent in the main for its supply
of water on the rainfall in the Abyssinian highlands.
One of the first problems in the hydrological cycle of arid
areas is that of accurately measuring precipitation, because
rainfall is low anyway. It can be very local and extremely
sporadic, this erratic distribution, both geographically and in
time, making for considerable discrepancies in accurate
measurement.
It is well known that advanced civilizations formerly
occupied what are today arid regions. Excavations show the
remains of reservoirs, canals, fortifications, and human
habitations, presuming an intensive and extensive cultivation
by a large population. Such is the case in India, Pakistan,
North Africa, the Near East, and even in the desolate region
of Lob Nor in Central Asia there are remains of oasis towns
and irrigation works. The disappearance of these civiliza¬
tions may have been brought about by severe climatic
changes or by the doings of man not for the benefit of
mankind.
M. Jean Tixeront, of Tunisia, in asking whether it is
possible to forecast weather over long periods, points out that
we haven't yet sufficient reliable records, but states that in
Tunisia they use one of nature's records In the growth rings
of trees and one of , man's in archaeological studies. The
meteorological service of Tunisia studied the climate of Ain
Draham from 1736 to 1955 by examining the growth rings of
an oak tree. The inference drawn was that from 1736 to
1790 there was significantly more rain than later and this
seems to be confirmed from historical documents which refer
to abundant crops in the eighteenth century.
Tixeront considers that a study of the ruins of Arab and
Roman irrigation works, of historical texts, of the continuity
of cultivation methods and the cultivated plant species
indicates that the climate is stable and has not become
decidedly drier. Similarly it was reported at the Unesco Arid
Land conference in Jerusalem in 1953 that all the historic,
botanical and archaeological evidence pointed to little change
in climate during the last eighty years or so in Israel and
India.
Tixeront points out that droughts do occur and we ought
to become aware of their statistical probability and makes a
plea that we study all the climatic factors which may lead
to the development of drought periods, as conversely to flood
times.
In practice, in Tunisia information from historical and
archaeological sources has been used to good effect. The
planting of olive trees at the same spacing as used by the
Romans in dry farming is successful today. So, too, wells,
cisterns and irrigation channels of Roman origin give a guide
to modern siting and use.
In semi-arid and arid areas transpiration and evaporation
(or to put them together as Dr. C. W. Thornthwaite does
under the term évapotranspiration) constitute the major
factor in the recirculation of rainfall into the air, but it is
Extremely and.

notably difficult to measure satisfactorily because of differ¬
ences in plant cover. It is becoming clearly evident that in
some instances an increase in crops or pastures or tree cover
may severely tax the capacity of ground water supplies and
in general a balance has to be struck between the needs of
crops and the water supply.
Experiments in South Africa indicate that only about
three percent of rainfall goes lower than the root zone of
veldt grasses. Phreatophytes, or plants which grow their
roots down to the water table like alfalfa, are notable for
their efficient transpiration; indeed I have on occasion
recommended the use of alfalfa to drain waterlogged
orchards in irrigated country. Worthless phreatophytes may
waste millions of acre feet of water in an arid country.
In order to assess the water requirements of an area,
wherever it may be, some way of measuring evaporation and
transpiration must be used, yet strange though it may seem
we have not yet achieved exactitude even in reading evapo¬
ration pans. Dr. Thornthwaite, who has devoted his scienti¬
fic life to the study of climate, has proposed a method oí
estimating the water need of a region so that it is possible,

knowing the rainfall and the évapotranspiration, to deter¬
mine how much additional water, if any, is needed by way of
irrigation.
Latterly, specially designed soil tanks four square metres
in area and seventy centimetres deep, in which plants can be
grown under field conditions, have been set up in a number
of places, each tank being surrounded by a large buffer area
to ensure greater accuracy in results, but not enough are yet
in use to give the range of variation from one area to
another. Meantime Thornthwaite and his colleagues have
come to the conclusion that the computation of potential
évapotranspiration for any place can be done from data on
air temperature and latitude alone. With this it is possible
to determine the water needs of an area and as it were keep
accounts whereby the most economical use may be made of
irrigation water.
Having briefly referred to rainfall, using that as a general
term, we may naturally turn to what happens to the rainfall

Luxor to about 70 miles north of Cairo. According to
Mohamed El Sayed Ayoub, one-time Inspector-General for
Nile Control, the mean width of the stream is 10 kilometres,
the strata of sand and gravel in which it flows ranges from
100 metres to 300 metres in depth, with a water storage capa¬
city of nearly 500,000 million cubic metres, and the water
takes nearly 100 years to arrive at the head of the delta.
Each year 1,400 million cubic metres is planned to be used on
25,000 acres of a new irrigation project, about another
1,000 million cubic metres are used by plants and nearly 4,000
million cubic metres flow into the delta unused.
The great aquifer under the Nile and the Nile itself receive
their water from distant sources, but were they to rely, on
local rainfall for the infiltration and stream flow they would
be dry each year for six months.
I would like at this stage to tell you briefly the story of
another great arid area which is being reclaimed, the recla¬
mation of which illustrates regional organization of the order
of the U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority. I refer to the Thai
desert area in western Pakistan.
It consists of a triangular area
of nearly five million acres with
a base of 65 miles along the Salt
Range to the north, and a length
of about 175 miles to the apex at
the south, and is in the Punjab
between the Indus, Jhelum and
the Chunab. Tradition, support¬
ed by geological evidence, has it
that the Indus formerly flowed
down the middle and deposited
huge quantities of sand and silt
and later changed its course to
the west. The superficial sand
dunes arise from fine material
blown from coastal and desert re¬
gions of Sind and Rajasthan.

other layers and goes underground where it may be stored or
move slowly in suitable layers gradually towards the sea.
The most generally used method of determining infiltration
is to examine the data of the use and fall of water in wells,
although today radio-active isotopes are available to make
evident the movement of water through permeable strata.
There are in the United States of America about seven
thousand observation wells, and approximately five percent
of these have automatic recording equipment.
The examination of an area for underground water in the
first place calls for geological knowledge and the use of
geologists to make the survey with or without the aid of geo¬
physics. By this means exact records would be kept of all
the wells or bores put down, the strata through which they
went down, the quality and quantity of the water, and so on.
Such a survey would enable estimates to be made of the total
volume of the underground supply, of its area and depth in
a confined source, or of its flow if unconfined, and the region
of flow in the aquifer.
Below the Nile there is an underground river (aquifer)
about 560 miles long reaching from about 80 miles south of
The question of developing the
Thai area was first considered in
1870, but nothing was done until
1901 when a Colonization Bill au¬
thorized the construction of a ca¬
nal to the Shamlat area. However
nothing was done until 1936 when
the distribution of the waters of
the Indus and its great tributa¬
ries was considered. Work on a
Thai project was begun in 1939
but held up because of the war,
and channels were filled up with sand when in 1947 the flood
of refugees from India moved into Pakistan. Of these 250,000
are being settled in the Thai.
In August 1949, the Thai Development Authority (T.D.A.)
was established, to be responsible for the full development
of an area of 834,500 acres, with an area of 638,000 acres to
be developed by private enterprise with the assistance of the
Authority.
It was believed that the agricultural development of the
area and the establishment of villages and small towns
throughout the area needed the balance of industrial deve¬
lopment, and so today there are sugar mills, cotton textile
mills, a woollen mill and a cement factory in the area. Some
640 villages have been established, each with forty or fifty
houses on a total of 100 acres, with a green belt all round
each village and a timber area of 50 acres alongside. Each
settler is allowed 15 acres of land at not more than a mile
and a half from his village, to cultivate satiifactorily.
The authority of the T.D.A. originally covered
the million and a half acres commandable by (Cont'd on

CONQUEST OF THE
DESERT (Cont'd)
Fresh water from the se
was examined for parts of the three and a half million
acres not commanded by canals. In certain belts masonry
wells have for years been used to supply water for small
holdings. The aquifer consists of sand layers with a water
table at 40 to 60 feet in ample quantity, and so a tube
well scheme has been initiated. How successful this will
be remains to be seen because percolation is heavy and
evaporation with summer temperatures up to 120° F. is high,
but it is hoped that each well can irrigate 150 acres. Early
last year Australia supplied tube wells to the T.D.A. under
the Colombo Plan.
Before leaving this very sketchy description of a brave
project I think it is safe to prophesy that in perhaps a decade
there will be need to study a salt problem in parts of the
Thai, and FAO is already at work in Pakistan on this problem
"in the Indus valley.
Mediterranean - Dead Sea Canal ?
In arid and semi-arid areas where the need for recharging
the underground water is acute there are often long
periods of no rain, interspersed with short bursts of storm
rains with extremely rapid run-off, carrying astonishing
quantities of surface material of sizes ranging from silt part¬
icles to boulders. These storm waters are gone in a relatively
short time, as you know, and the problem is how to make
good use of what are sometimes quite large supplies, by
spreading and slowing down the rush of waters, by the use of
dams and tanks, by selection of the site for percolation, and
so on.
I referred a moment ago to the possible development of
salty conditions in some of the irrigated land under the
T.D.A. Rainfall is relatively free from salts and where
rainfall is adequate for agricultural production excess soluble
salts in the soil are leached away in the drainage water, but
where rainfall is low leaching is reduced and salt accu¬
mulation can occur. All irrigation waters contain salts dis¬
solved from rocks and soils through which the water moves.
Some years ago Scofield studied irrigated areas in the
southwest United States and described the salt balance as
the relation between the amount of salts being delivered in
irrigation water and the amount removed from area in drain¬
age waters. This concept backed by suitable methods for
its application may be valuable in preventing salting and
in remedying existing salt conditions.
Dr. H. E. Hayward, of the U.S. Salinity Laboratory at River¬
side, has prepared a most comprehensive review for Unesco
of research on plant growth under saline conditions. In it
he refers to the classification of saline and alkali soils, the
quality of waters for irrigation, the physiological bases in
plants for salt and alkali tolerance, the effects on plant
growth and on seed germination and then succintly reviews
the position in Australia, India and Pakistan, South and Cen¬
tral America and North America.
As human, animal and plant bodies are so largely made up
of water it is little wonder that the ability of man to live is
dependent on having plenty of good water. I referred earlier
to the relationship between population and food supply. The
same sort of relationship obtains between population and
water supply. It is little wonder then that men's minds turn
to those seemingly inexhaustible supplies of water, the seas
and oceans, and wish it were economically feasible to desalt
sea water in immense quantities.
On one occasion a sincere good wisher asked me whether
it would be possible to construct a canal from the Mediter¬
ranean through the Negev desert to the Dead Sea using
desalted sea water for irrigating the desert and raising the
level of the Dead Sea waters with the drainage. Well, the
answer is that success in producing large quantities of fresh
water economically from salt water is not just around the
corner. There is no magic wand, but research is going on in
many parts and there is little doubt that the day will come
when in some arid areas it will be possible to provide desalt¬
ed water at lower cost than, for example, water transmitted
over great distances.
Dr. Everett Howe, of the University of California, prepared
for Unesco an excellent summary of research on the utiliza¬
tion of saline water and Sheppard Powell, a member of the
Advisory Group to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, has
reported on the Saline Water Conversion Programme. This
programme was established by the Congress of the United
States under Public Law 448 and the research projects financ¬
ed by grants in aid under this enactment are already highly
productive, especially in assessing the merits and costs of
producing fresh water from saline supplies. The Saline
Water Programme is due to end July 1957, but I am sure we
hope that it may be extended beyond that date.
I now come to a consideration of that which forms the base
on which food production on the scale for world needs takes
placel the soil. It is not proposed to go into any detail
about arid soils. Suffice it to recall a few characteristics
such as their low content of organic matter and so of nitro¬
gen, the fact that they are more usually alkaline than acid
and so may develop permeability problems with irrigation,
and their sometimes rather high content of soluble salts.
Despite these characteristics, with suitable fertilizer treat¬
ments crop yields under irrigation can be remarkably high
and large scale prosperous communities may be established,
as witness the position in the U.S.A. and in Australia.
There is little evidence of any marked climate change for
the worse since man used or misused the Iand for living. The
effectiveness of the rainfall has however been seriously reduc¬
ed by man's over-use of plough, the axe and the grazing
animal, particularly the goat. Marginal areas have become
man-made desert areas and it is in this sense that the desert
is advancing. In any attempt to re-establish marginal areas
for better production and living conditions it is necessary to
survey and map the existing plant cover, whether natural
or cultivated, and land use, as is being done, and/or plan¬
ned, by F.A.O. working with national authorities.
The main task is to attempt the regeneration of a better
plant cover and to do this while the population is engaged
in gaining a living from the area. It is essential to have as
guides in this work enclosed or protected areas which are
ungrazed, in order to study such natural regeneration as may
occur and indeed sometimes the results may be startling.
One thing we cannot do, and that is go over from one area
in one part of the world and at once begin to apply proce¬
dures elsewhere in the expectation that they will be success¬
ful. Much experimentation is needed in selecting suitable
plants, in getting them seeded, germinated and growing in
these very old environments.
Land of imported plants
It is dangerous to disturb the land surface more than ne¬
cessary even with good intent because of the possibility of
soil removal or seedling scarification by the sand-loaded
winds which blow in the hot season. I have seen this in
the Thai desert of Pakistan where we are making trials
with a number of plants. It seems to me that the provision
of some shelter from these searing winds is essential and this
can begin round nursery areas and in strips suitably placed
across the prevailing winds. The limitless horizons of the
desert are very interesting to write about but they are no
good for proper land care.
Now, I come from a land where it has been necessary to
introduce and establish every kind of plant food which
you can think of for man and his animals, with the exception
of the native grasses and top feed dry climate trees like the
mulga (an Acacia). We have successfully introduced every
kind of fruit and vegetable which can be grown anywhere
and we are still testing many grasses and legumes. The
same is true of the U.S.A., where I think trial introductions
from all over the world total more than 65,000.
Oustanding with us has been the success of subterranean
clover, which has meant millions to sheep men in southern
Australia. Phalaris tuberosa and rye grasses t

illustrations. But the U.S.A. and Australia use alfalfa, called
by Australians lucerne, the American name being nearer the
Arabic which means the good plant. I refer to this to illus¬
trate the possibilities of plant exploration for grasses and
legumes particularly in old arid areas. There is much yet to
be done in this field.
It is obviously necessary to learn what are the physiological
factors which enable desert and near-desert plants to sur¬
vive long periods with limited water supply under conditions
of excessive insolation, very high day temperatures and low
night temperatures.
Colonel Omar Draz, Director of the Desert Range Develop¬
ment Project in Egypt, has referred to the need for a tho¬
rough understanding of the ecological, genetic and physiolo¬
gical bases which will enable the selection of plants and ani¬
mals most suited to arid conditions, and has drawn atten¬
tion to the importance in animals of heat tolerance and heat
dissipation, about which much is still to be learned. He has
stressed the idea that it is shortsighted to look down on
local breeds which have become adapted to the conditions of
living in the environment.
Whatever research work is done in any or all of the fields
we have so far considered, the end result should be for the
benefit of man and it is appropriate therefore to think at this
stage about man himself, his well-being and living conditions.
One striking feature of man in the desert is his nomadism,

and while it may always be that some movement of flocks
must occur to and from grazing areas it does not follow that
the shepherds remain nomads. It is unnecessary to do more
than remind you how very different the lives of men, women
and children are under nomadic conditions from those which
you enjoy in a dry climate. Any changes in modes of living
must mean great social adjustments for those people.
W. S. S. Ladell, Director of the Hot Climate Physiological
Research Unit in Nigeria, dealing with the influence of envi¬
ronment in arid regions, points out the wide range in tem¬
perature which man has to live under, as for example at
Basra where the mean monthly minimum varies from freez¬
ing to 83 °F and the mean monthly maximum from 67 °F to
109 °F. Under these conditions there is also little cloud, and
scanty vegetative cover so that the ground radiates heat,
and dust-laden air radiates still more heat. With wind in
addition, water loss from the body may proceed faster than
physiologically desirable.
Ladell refers to heat acclimatization, by which is meant
the physiological changes resulting in an improvement in
work following exposure in a hot environment and consi¬
ders that man can live under conditions more severe than
occur in the hottest parts of the world. Protection from
direct solar radiation is desirable in the form of a light
broad-brimmed hat, or on a tractor a canopy over the driv¬
ing seat (1).
Good housing is essential cool by day and such as to give
adequate protection at night; and in this respect the thick-
walled, small-windowed, pise houses of the Near East, Pakis¬
tan and India are types.
Desert dwellers may suffer from prickly heat and from
malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency which leads to slow
healing of wounds.

Water is the essence of life and it seems a pity that because
of religious beliefs or tradition desert dwellers do not take
to the use of galvanised iron tanks to store roof water.
We who live in comfort find it hard to realize what life is
like without electricity or gas, without water in pipes, without
refrigeration and radios, air conditioning in buildings, good
roads and fast cars and so forth. But many thousands live
where hydro-electric power is not available nor where fossil
fuels like coal and oil can be used. So we turn to such sour¬
ces pf power as wind and sun.
Successful wind-driven generators up to 70 kW capacity
are functioning in the United Kingdom; and much thought is
being given to automatic regulation in variable winds in
order to make the fullest use of wind power. It is most
important to choose the right site for a windmill.
The use for wind power to pump water either directly or
through the use of electricity should result in saving bullock
power and thereby acreage for human food.
Solar energy has already been put to work for cooking and
heating water and we saw demonstrations of equipment in
action at New Delhi, India, last November. The problem is
to reduce cost to within the means of the average Indian.
Here in California hot water heaters have been installed on
the roof with insulated hot water storage tanks.
Considerable thought and experimentation is being devot¬
ed to the possibility of developing a solar engine. Dr. Abbott
of the Smithsonian Institution has long pioneered in this
field.
In any scientific work it is first essential to survey the
field. In this case it is a survey of the fields, and so it is a
highly complex operation calling for teamwork of the highest
order. I do not decry individual effort, indeed some of the

greatest contributions to knowledge have been made by the
Newtons and Einsteins. But in the title of the address allot¬
ted to me "The Challenge of Arid Land Research and Deve¬
lopment for the Benefit of Mankind" it is impossible to avoid
the inference that here we must have team work, and that
team work should be between individuals, between univer¬
sities and research institution and between peoplesin
other words between United Nations Organizations.
Particularly does it seem appropriate that we who belong
to those sections of mankind that enjoy the highest stan¬
dards of living should see a plain duty to help in every way
possible to benefit the less well-off sections of mankind.
I often think how wasteful it is that the billions of money
used in defending part of mankind against possible aggres¬
sion by another part of mankind could not be spent in
research work of this sort for the benefit of mankind. Ima¬
gine our young folk being called up for service and electing
to serve for a period in one of the fields we have been discus¬
sing during these meetings. But that is Utopian.
It seemed to me that the title of this address required me

SCIENCE SAFARI
IN THE U.S.A.
Avast area of the United States is desert or semi-arid. Except
for a few rich valleys in the northwestern corner, the.
western third of that agriculturally rich country, measur¬
ing almost 2,000 miles from northwest to southeast and
1,000 miles eastward from the Pacific ocean, depends on irri¬
gation with waters from the high mountain ranges that run
through it. The irrigated lands are miraculously productive,
but irrigation can touch only a small fraction of the area. The
Americans Avant to do something about the land that cannot
be irrigated.
It was this that led the farmers and businessmen of the Rio
Grande valley in the states of Texas and New Mexico to organize
a three-day international conference at the old Spanish city
of Albuquerque in New Mexico, attended by 64 arid-land experts
from 26 nations and more than 400 American specialists. With
the aid of Unesco, the American Association for the Advance¬
ment of Science and the National Science Foundation, the
scientific sessions were held at the University of New Mexico
during the closing days of April this year.
But the most effective feature of their plan was a two-day,
600 mile autobus caravan for 95 of the experts, including
men from 20 other arid countries, who saw and studied
desert conditions and exchanged experiences and opinions face
to face. Never before has a desert been so expertly examined.
One of the scientists wrote afterwards : "It was a time for
relaxed exchange of ideas, for a birds-eye view of almost the
entire range of arid-land problems in the framework of the
lives and prosperity of the people of the area. It welded strong
friendships which crossed many national boundaries and
provided a common experience and backgreund for future
friendly co-operation between nations."
The expedition started from the city of Albuquerque on the
Rio Grande, which is not grand, but is a mere trickle of water,
and wound over a mountain pass into the undrained Estancia
Valley where pinto beans are grown in large quantity at the
cost of pumping irreplaceable ground water from far beneath
the surface. Then came an area of dry salt lakes that testify
to ample rain in former times. Then to higher mesas where
remains of ploughed fields and ruins of houses show how
recently the desert has advanced. The stone ruins of the
Spanish church at Gran Quivira show that the Spanish settlers
three hundred years ago also failed where the native Indians
had prosperously lived on the land for many centuries.
Still farther south came the barest desert of all, the "mal-
pai" or bad country formed by a flow of lava less than 1,000
years old that covers 127 square miles to an average depth
of 70 feet. Following this came the unique "White Sands" and
more and more desert. On the second day the caravan wound
north from the city of El Paso up the valley of the Rio Grande
through the irrigated farmlands and to the experimental desert
ranch of the State College of New Mexico. Before returning to
Albuquerque the expedition also examined the dam, lake and
irrigation system at Elephant Butte which has been in operation
since 1915 and shows what forty years can do in reducing the
effectiveness of a river dam.
The photographs on these pages tell the story. The scientists
do not look impressive or even scientific. And they did almost
nothing to improve this land that they saw at least, not yet.
But these are some of the men on whom the future of the arid
lands depends. Under the leadership of the Unesco Advisory
Committee on Arid Zone Research, and after this extended
intimate contact with each other, any benefit accomplished
for one arid land will swiftly be extended to all arid landsand
that means to one third of the earth's surface and to the'i
peoples of 37 nations or almost exactly half the member states
of Unesco.

White Sands, New Mexico, whose snow-like glistening sand dune
formations cover 270 square miles, is the largest of the world's gypsum

carried by rivers into a lake which once covered the entire area. As
the climate became arid, the lake evaporated and the gypsum separated
into crystals which the wind has piled into high dunes. (Photos I and 2)

HARNESSING POWER
FROM DESERT WINDS
For centuries nomadic peoples have
led a precarious existence in
deserts, or semi-deserts. They
wander about with their herds of sheep
and goats and sometimes camels
following the occurrence of spasmodic
rains which bring forth a thin cover of
grasses and other plants for pasture.
This crop is quickly consumed and the
animals browse on the foliage of such
shrubs as manage to thrive on the
treeless plains. This mode of life is
indeed free and independent but it is
hazardous. If the rains fail the ani¬
mals, and perhaps also their owners,
die of starvation unless they are lucky
in getting away quickly enough to
better-watered lands.
Although it is a method of using the
by
E. W. Golding
sparse "agricultural resources" of the
desert, nomadism is a sure way to keep
it as desert. Vegetation never gets a
chance to become established so as to
provide shade and to retain the
random rain which, on a bare surface,
so rapidly runs away, with disastrous
effects in erosion. In addition to this
excessive grazing, the inhabitants
themselves make conditions worse by
cutting shrubs to provide fuel for their
fires for cooking and warmth at
night when the desert is cold.

areas which can support a population

MUSCLE POWER V. A MODERATE BREEZE : In eastern countries camels or bullocks are used to lift water from wells. In raising some
600 or 700 gallons an hour from a depth of 30 to 40 feet, these animals exert only a small fraction of a horsepower. Windmills of even crude or old-
fashioned design like those at Aden shown above can easily do same work driven by moderate breezes which blow in these areas. (Photos E. W. Golding)

efforts. Life is inevitably harder in
the under-developed countries and
the help of machine power is even
more needed' power for water pump¬
ing, for cultivation, for corn-grinding
and food preparation, for lighting,
heating, refrigeration and for other
domestic and agricultural purposes.
Whence can this power come?
It could, of course, be imported, but
only at great cost. Electrical trans¬
mission from a distant power station
to supply a scattered population, is
likely to be matched in cost by that of
transporting oil for local diesel-driven
power stations. Maybe in the future,
though how distant no-one can say
with any certainly, relatively small
"packaged" nuclear power plants will
become available at an economic price
but even the smallest of these will
almost certainly be too large for use by
isolated communities. In any case, are
we to wait for many years before
attempting to develop these areas in
which water! the prime necessity*
quite often lies at no great depth in
the ground needing only some form of
power to pump it to the surface for
irrigation?
Search for power
The question naturally arises "Are
there any local sources of energy
which could be used instead of
attempting to bring in energy from
outside the area?" Often there are.
Abundant sunshine is a feature of
many desert areas and this can
be used for water heating, for the
distillation of saline waters, for
cooking and perhaps, later, for power
when the problem of building solar
engines at an economic price has been
solved. The fact that bright sunshine
in the desert supplies energy at the
rate of about one horse power for every
square yard certainly makes the idea
attractive.
The wind often blows strongly
enough to be used to produce power by
means of some form of windmill.
Very commonly during the daytime
there is a breeze of 15 miles an hour
(or even more) and we can easily
calculate, for example, that at that
speed the wind has a power of 20 horse
power passing through a vertical area,
10 yards square, which could be swept
by the revolving blades of a windmill.
Not all of this power in the wind can
be captured by the machine but if only
one tenth of it were extracted it would
be a very useful amount of power.
Aerodynamics helped
In eastern countries one frequently
sees water being lifted from wells
by a camel or a pair of bullocks

Mr. Edward W>. GOLDING is head of the rural elec¬
trification and wind power department of Britain's
Electrical Research Association, London. He was res¬
ponsible for setting up the first British wind-powered
generating plant in the Orkney Islands. In 195/ he

gramme to advise the government on the possibilities
of exploiting the country's wind resources. In 1954

an hour from a depth of 30 or 40 feet
the animals are exerting, on the aver¬
age, a small fraction of a horse power.
A windmill of even a very crude design
could easily cope with this duty when
driven by the moderate breezes which
blow for several hours a day here.
During the last few years, encourag¬
ed by the rapid advances made during
the war in our knowledge of aerodyna¬
mics, several countries have been giv¬
ing much attention to the possibilities
of wind power and national committees
have been set up in England, France,
Denmark, India, Israel, Holland and
Spain. Present ideas go much beyond
the simple water-pumping windmills
and rather in the direction of generat-
ing electric power, on a significant
scale, from wind-driven generators.
These will probably take a somewhat
similar form to that of the small two-
bladed windmills used to charge an
electric battery for electric lighting in
country houses, but they will be much
larger.
The power in the wind is proportional
to the cube of the wind speed so that
if this is doubled the power is increased
eight times. It is thus very important
to choose the site for a wind power
plant very carefully. Hill-top sites are
best because of their good exposure
and, even if the main purpose is water
pumping, it may be well to instal the
machine on a nearby hill, and to
transmit the power to the pump elec¬
trically rather than to build it close to
the well where the wind speed may be
much lower. Any surplus electric

power from the machine can then be
used for other domestic or agricultural
purposes.
In general, the present wind power
researches aim at two main scales of
use. The first is large scale, with
wind-driven generators feeding their
output of electrical energy directly into
supply networks and so saving fuel
which would otherwise have to be
burnt in the power station to generate
this energy. Wherever there are ex¬
tensive electric power networks and
there is sufficient wind or high en¬
ough fuel costs to make their use
economic, these large machines could
play an important rôle.
For the desert areas with scattered
power domestic purposes; pump all the
water for domestic use and, besides,
could drive several water pumps, for
irrigation, each equivalent to the
efforts of a bullock team.
To give some figures, a suitably
designed and well-sited 10 kW windmill
could give an annual output of 15,000
to 20,000 units of electrical energy, each
unit of which is capable of pumping
about 5,000 gallons of water from a
depth of 50 feet. As for energy costs,
wind power compares favourably with
that from oil engines (which may cost
3d. to 4d. per unit for fuel alone in a
remote area) unless the wind speed is
very low. Usually, however, it has not
to compete with oil engines but with
Ingenious combined use of sun and wind
power provides salt in the Tripoli region of
the Lebanon. Wind energy harnessed"" by
simple windmills lifts sea water to evaporating
basins (sometimes several yards above sea
leyel) where solar energy completes the
operation, evaporating the water in each
basin in about two weeks. Modern windmills
(shown in column on left) reflect improved
knowledge in aero-dynamics applied to wind
energy research by many countries in search
of increased power supplies. (I) Two types

X t
populations, the second scale, employ¬
ing machines from about 10 to 100
kilowatts in capacity, is likely to be
more applicable. Here there are no
widespread networks and wind power
must be used either alone or preferably
assisted by solar radiation to fulfil the
people's needs. It will be wise to use
these two sources of energy for pur¬
poses for which each is best suited, e.g.
the wind to produce motive power and
the sun to provide heat for water heat¬
ing and distillation and for cooking.
At least two wind power plants of
about 10 kW capacity are already
available and it is interesting to consid¬
er what amenities two or three of these
machines, installed on a favourable
site, could provide for a community of,
say, 30 or 40 families. They could, for
example, supply all the power needed
for lighting, fans, radio and small-

bullock power, and a team of 4 bullocks,
with 2 men working them, can raise,
in an hour, less than half the 5,000
gallons of water just mentioned. The
bullocks are expensive to buy; they
have a working life of only 5 or 6 years
and each consumes some 10 to 15 tons
of fodder a year.
It seems obvious, therefore, that the.
local resources of wind and sunshine
should be exploited. Three main re¬
quirements must be met in exploiting
them. Suitable machines must be built
at a low enough cost. They must be
installed at good sites to give maximum
outputs, and their operation must be
planned to make the fullest possible
use of this output.
Whether it be from wind power or
from solar radiation, the power supply
is not continuously available and to
store energy is expensive. Thus we
must arrange to use it as and when it
comes. Loads such as water pumping
or water heating, which have inherent
storage, must be used, keeping the
storage by electric batteries to a mi¬
nimum.
Wind, sun and animals
Machines are being developed by
engineering manufacturers in
several countries but their de¬
signs must be based on adequate data
from local observations. Sometimes
it may be possible for crude windmills,
sufficiently useful to serve as a start
in development, to be made from local
materials with, perhaps, reed or
bamboo mats for sails.
There is an urgent need for me¬
teorological data from these areas,
but it must be obtained in suitable
form for selected sites. We need
information on wind speeds throughout
the year, on the duration of calm
spells, on the daily occurrence of wind
and on sand storms and other local
conditions. Often a place with a low
average wind speed will be found to
have quite usable winds for some hours
in the daytime followed by calm
periods at night.
" A very important question which
calls for study and for trials under
practical conditions, is that of combin¬
ing the power resources' wind, sun
and animal power/ to fulfil all the
needs without storing the energy in
batteriestexcept perhaps a little for
electric lighting. Many purposes such
as irrigation pumping, and corn-grind¬
ing, can be served at any time but
power for lighting and heating is
needed at night while cooking must be
done by day.
Heat stored in blocks
There are many possibilities to be
considered as, for example, the
storage of heat in solid blocks, in
liquids or in melted crystals which give
up their latent heat upon solidifying
again; some agricultural loads can easi¬
ly be met as power becomes available,
while (if one dare mention it with re¬
ference to a desert area where it is so
important to conserve vegetable mat¬
ter) there is sometimes a little waste
material which could be used as fuel
for the small portable steam engines
which have been developed in Great
Britain. These engines can provide a
small amount of power to fill up the
gaps when there is neither wind nor
sunshine.
One can conclude that the energy
resources are often available to provide
for the needs of remote communities
capable of developing desert or semi-
desert areas. Suitable machines are
being built but what is now especially
needed is intelligent siting and instal¬
lation of these machines, and careful
planning for their combined use, with
guidance for the users until they grow
accustomed to the new ideas which are
involved.

### 69045: The Desert's greatest resource: energy from the sun
Energy from the sun:
THE DESERTS
GREATEST
RESOURCE
by Gerald Wendt
The source of all life on earth is sunshine. When water
is available green leaves use the energy of the sun to
manufacture both foods and fuel. Each year the sun
thus produces many hundreds of millions of tons of starch,
sugar and, less directly, fats and proteins for human food.
It makes no less than 10,000 million tons of wood each year.
In past ages it has provided the many thousands of millions
of tons of vegetation that are now underground in the form
of coal. For lack of water, this does not happen in arid
lands. The challenge persists, however, at least to utilize this
great resource of the deserts as energy to replace fuel, if not
to make food.
The amount of available energy in the form of sunshine is
colossal many times larger than can ever be used. The
sunshine that falls in a day on 100 square meters of flat
surface (an area 32.8 feet on a side, about as large as the
roof of a small house) is equivalent to 558 kilowatt hours of
Press Information Bureau, Gove of India.
electricity, to 146 pounds of soft coal, or 14 gallons of gasoline.
If this could be used for power with an efficiency of only five
percent, the sunshine on so small an area would provide
28 kilowatt hours or 38 horse power hours of work per day.
The urge to find a way for using this energy is irresistible.
Sunshine may eventually be used on a large scale for the
operation of factories. That day is far off, but the imme¬
diate need in the arid lands is for small power units for
pumping water from wells and underground streams.
At the Unesco symposium.' on the utilization of solar energy
which was held in New Delhi, India, in October 1954, Dr. Far-
rington Daniels of the University of Wisconsin, U.S.A., made
this point in these words : "Let us be content with solar
machines that have a conversion into useful work of only
me to five percent of the sun's radiation thai
falls on them but let us insist on a simple low- (Cont'd on

COOKING BY
SUN POWER
Simple devices for putting the sun's
energy to work in the kitchen are
now being successfully developed
in several countries. In the Middle
East, a simple, compact solar cooker
has been designed and perfected by a
Lebanese, Dr. Tarcici. An Egyptian,
firm expects to manufacture about
18,000 a year. Photos on opposite
page show Dr. Tarcici demons¬
trating his solar stove. In India a
simple solar cooker developed by
the National Physical Laboratory,
New Delhi, is being manufactured
on a large scale. It consists of a
concave metallic plate which focuses
the sun's rays on an iron ring. Photo,
left, shows it being used in conjunc¬
tion with a pressure cooker with
which it can cook vegetables in
ten to fifteen minutes. Sun's heat
from reflecting surface will bring
water to boiling point in 20 to
30 minutes. Thanks to solar
cookers sparse vegetation and ani¬
mal dungat present used in many
countries as fuel will be saved for
the protection and improvement of
the land.

STEAM FROM
GIANT RUSSIAN
MIRRORS
The Soviet Union with almost one million square miles of
arid land has devoted years of research to developing practical
means of putting the sun's energy to work. Recently the
U.S.S.R. made the startling announcement that it had deve¬
loped an apparatus capable of producing steam by solar
energy. Photo above right, shows one of these reflectors, a
giant curved mirror over 30 feet in diameter whose heat
energy can produce steam. These heaters can operate can¬
neries and refrigeration plants as well as distil fresh water
from sea water. Recently a solar engine was developed for
industry which produces 33,000 tons of steam per year.
Russian technicians have found that distillation plants power¬
ed by solar energy provide the cheapest method of purifying
water for livestock grazing in remote desert pastures. Photo

no more than a horse, bullock or camel

conditions.
Even cloudy weather does not necessarily destroy the
effectiveness of solar engines, according to Dr. A. E. H.
Bleksley of the University of Witwatersrand (South Africa).
He reported at New Delhi on measurements made during the
past forty years of the amount of solar radiation at different
locations and in different climates. He told the symposium,
"Except in the relatively rare cases of a sky completely
covered with a dark cloud layer, the presence of diffuse
radiation serves largely to compensate for the loss of direct
radiation due to thin or scattered clouds or to considerable
quantities of dust in the atmosphere".
While there is ample energy in sunlight, the chief difficulty
in making use of it is that it is spread so thinly. Nowhere on
earth is the direct heat of the sun sufficiently intense to boil
water. The highest temperature on record is 136.4° F. (At'
Aziziya, Libya, in 1922) but water boils at 212° F. For this
reason sunshine from a larger area must be gathered and
concentrated into a small area to attain the necessary tem¬
perature, as small boys focus sunshine with a lens that they
call á "burning glass". This is effective but involves the
mechanical difficulty of moving the mirrors about with the
change in the position of the sun during the day.
Nevertheless by such means a simple device was developed
for home use by the National Physical Laboratory at New
Delhi in India. It consists of a metallic plate curved into
a concave shape and supported on a stand so that thß sun's
rays are reflected upward from the polished metallic surface
ind are thus concentrated on an iron ring at the focus, or
centre of curvature. When a pot of water or of rice is set
on the ring it absorbs the sun's heat from about one square
yard of surface and is heated to the boiling point in 20 to
30 minutes. This solar cooker is to be manufactured on a
large scale and should be effective in avoiding the use of
scarce fuel, particularly in the many arid regions. It serves
well for cooking and is of value in saving both sparse vege¬
tation, and fertilizer for protection and improvement of the
land instead of using them a fuel.
But to obtain sufficient energy to operate a pump, long
cylindrical mirrors are more useful. At the focus of such
mirrors a glass tube filled with water serves as a boiler. By
various modifications of mirror systems it has been possible
to generate three or four kilowatts of the energy as steam
which can be harnessed to an electric generator, there turned
into electricity to operate a motor and thus a pump.
Sun makes 12,000 tons of ice a year
At the same symposium, there was a striking report by
Professor V. A. Baum, head of the Heliotechnical Labo¬
ratory at the G. M. Krzhizhanovsky Power Institute at
Tashkent in the Soviet Union. He said that Soviet scientists
have succeeded in developing curved-mirror (paraboloid)
reflectors ten meters in diameter which produce 100 pounds
of steam per hour at a pressure of 100 pounds per square
inch. Such heaters have been used for the operation of
canneries, for distilling water, operating refrigerators, and
for heating the laboratory.
Similar heaters have also been developed to make fresh
water from salt water. A practical still of this type produces
250 gallons of distilled water per day and uses only 4 pounds
of steam per gallon. This proves to be the cheapest method
of providing water for livestock grazing in the Kara Kur
desert. A still of this type has been used to make 75,000 tons
of distilled water and 12,000 tons of ice a year.

### 69045: The Desert's greatest resource: energy from the sun
Unesco Courier. Nr 8-9. 1955
One of the great handicaps of solar energy is its disconti¬
nuous operation. There is no way to make sun shine during
the night, nor on days of dense clouds. The pumping of
water for irrigation is not seriously handicapped but the
generation of electricity for home and village lighting in the
evening, which is an important function of a possible solar
engine, obviously requires the storage of power.
In a discussion submitted to the United Nations Confer¬
ence on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Dr. Farrington
Daniels made the following suggestions on the storage prob¬
lem : One obvious solution is to pump water to a reservoir
at a higher level and allow it to fall back at night to operate
a water turbine and dynamo. For many years a mine in
New Mexico (U.S.A.) was lighted day and night by electric
lights operated by a dynamo and solar engine. A parabolic
mirror focussed sunlight onto a boiler which ran a steam
engine and pumped water into a 5,000 gallon tank 20 feet
above the ground. One can imagine that if solar power
should become important those communities would be
favored, which have a high plateau nearby for easy con¬
struction of a water reservoir to store hydro-electric power.
Abandoned mines with a water turbine at the bottom might
be used also, the water being pumped up during the day and
allowed to flow back during the night. Diving bells with
deep chambers in the ocean to be pumped out during the
day, might be used by coastal cities.
Electrical storage batteries would also serve the purpose
and in principle they are ideal. The lead storage battery
has been developed for automobiles to a high state of per¬
fection. It is too expensive and requires too much attention
for general use in non-industrialized areas. But for use
with solar engines, says Dr. Daniels, the storage battery need
not be strong, rugged and of small size. It does not have
to give a high amperage and it does not have to be instantly
and completely reversible. Ignoring these requirements of
our present lead storage batteries, it may well be that new
chemical systems and new types of electrodes can be devel¬
oped. For general use, the cost should be no more than
one-tenth that of present lead storage batteries.
There are thus a number of approaches to the problem
of power in the desert. They are important because small
local sources of power would not only be useful in cooking
and in lighting remote communities but would also permit
the use of arable land to grow human food in place of the
vegetation that is now required to feed the animals that
are the present sources of power. This alone would accom¬
plish a considerable increase in the food production in arid
lands. Where underground water is available such local
power resources would of course be primarily valuable in
permitting irrigation and thereby further increasing food
production.
House warming by ' heat traps '
There are however, other uses to which the sun can be
put, namely, the heating of houses and of water for
domestic use. In many desert countries the temperature
is very hot by day and yet uncomfortably cold at night. In
such locations house heating requires the absorption of the
sun's energy by day and its storage for use by night. Since
this use does not require the generation of steam or a high
temperature the collection of sunshine is a much easier
matter. It is done quite simply by using a "heat trap", an
insulated box exposed to the sunshine on the roof. It is
blackened on the inside to absorb heat and is covered with
a piece of glass or a thin sheet of transparent plastic. The
cover allows visible sunlight to pass into the box where the
short visible light waves are transformed into the much
longer waves of heat radiation. This does not pass through
the glass or plastic and the box becomes quite hot. The hot
air from this box is then led to a storage bin which is
filled with crushed rock or gravel. This is heated by the
air and retains the heat. By night, cool air passes through
the storage bin and, warmed by absorbing the
heat from the rocks or gravel, in turn warms (Cont'd on
the house. next page)

MULTI-MIRROR solar heater is one of many devices being developed at India's National Physical Laboratory. Battery of cheap, flat glass mirrors (left)
concentrates sun's heat. Each mirror is fixed on its own small mounting (right). All mirrors can be tilted as a group by a single automatic control to
reflect rays into single focus. Heater is designed to provide power for small steam engines or electric motors. (PIB-Government of India photos)
Water heating for domestic uses, including the washing
of clothes, is done similarly, the water in a storage tank
being gradually heated by the hot air from the heat trap
on the roof. For example in the Russian village of Firusa
near Asshabad, a solar heat collector with a surface of
900 square feet provided 10.5 tons of hot water in 24 hours
at a medium temperature of 120° F.
One other possibility is available for future use. In April
1954 the Bell Telephone Laboratory announced a solar battery
able to transform sunlight directly into electrical energy
without the use of heat. It employs two thin wafers of very
pure silicon in contact with each other. This highly purified
silicon now costs $380 per pound. Although the wafers are
thin the cost of such a battery is very high and it is used as
yet only to produce electrical power for amplifier stations on
rural telephone lines. Yet it is remarkably effective. The
current is about 25 milliamperes per square centimetre or
2.5 amperes per square metre at a voltage of 0.3 volts. This
indicates a high efficiency in the utilization of sunshine, up
to 8 % being common and it has reached eleven per cent.
The promise of this direct method of generating electricity
from the sun therefore depends only on the possibility of
manufacturing silicon, which in its common form is a cheap
metal, in high purity at a low price.
It is apparent from this survey that utilization of sunshine
for heat and for power has been neglected in the past, partly
because the researches have been done in highly industria¬
lized countries where ample coal is available, and where
sunshine can hardly compete. Present attention to the
needs of arid lands where coal and other fuels are either
costly or lacking, has revealed many promising possibilities
and it is now legitimate to anticipate that practical means
of using the sun will gradually become available to desert
peoples and that sunshine will become a valuable resource
that can be converted into food, fuel and power to improve
tl>e standard of living.

This glimpse of the
future is the achieve¬
ment of Professor Felix
Trombe, director of the
Solar Energy Labora¬
tory at Mont - Louis,
and Marc Foex, its
assistant director. It
is the result of more
than twenty years of
research in high-tem¬
perature treatment of
metals and nine years
of experiments with
solar energy.
Recently, the Unesco
Courier sent this cor¬
respondent to Mont-
Louis. He expected to
find a Jules Verne set¬
ting and he was not
disappointed.
The fortress at Mont-Louis was built by the Marquis of
Vauban, Louis XIV's great military engineer in 1676, and it
has changed very little since then. You enter the solar
energy laboratory over a bridge crossing a moat. The great
wooden gates with their nail-studded flanks guarding the
bridge have not changed in 300 years either.
The Courier's correspondent asked a tall man in his late
forties, wearing rope-soled espadrilles and perched on top of
a framework of girders, where Monsieur le Professeur Trombe
could be found.
"I'll be right down," said the man on the girders, "You'll
have to excuse me we're making our plans as we go along."
Prof. Trombe led the way into his office and sat down at
a desk covered by great white vases which he used indiscrim¬
inately as ashtrays. I pointed to one. "Melted quartz from
the solar furnace", he explained, throwing a match into it.
FOCAL POINT of solar furnace at the Mont-Louis Solar Energy Laboratory, France.
Concentrated heat from sun rays in the centre of photo (they produce a temperature
of 5,500 degrees F.) was made visible by throwing a handful of powdered aluminium
at focal point of rays. Furnace is used for high temperature treatment of metals.
In his office, Prof. Trombe and his assistant director
explained how they turned to solar energy in 1946 as a way
of producing high temperatures for treating minerals.
"With solar energy," said Prof. Trombe, "you can keep
substances free from carbon or other impurities, for energy
can be produced independently of any chemical reaction."
. . This also enables the
metallurgist to control
the properties of the
atmosphere inside his
furnace to a high de¬
gree of precision.
They started on a
modest scale at the
Me u don Observatory
near Paris. The weath¬
er in the 1 1 e - d e -
France was not exactly
ideal for their experi¬
ments, and they had
only reflectors from
wartime anti-aircraft
searchlights for use as
parabolic mirrors. Still,
they could see they
were on the right
track.
In 1949, General Paul
Bergeron, director of
the French National
Defence Scientific Ac¬
tivities Committee, saw
their experiments and
agreed with them. He
offered them a new
site. Mont-Louis in the
sunny Cerdagne coun¬
try of the Pyrenees.
There are now 20
research workers at
Mont - Louis and 25
more in Prof. Trombe's
laboratory in Paris.
The work is financed
jointly by the French
National Defence and
especially by the
French National Cen¬
tre of Scientific Research and the Ministry of Education.
"We build our own apparatus", said Prof. Trombe. "Our
team believes in what we are doing."
The new site in the Cerdagne offered Prof. Trombe and
Mr. Foex the sunniest region in France, a "micro-climate"
only 300 square miles in area and protected by mountains
against the carcanet wind from the north and the damp
southwesterly gusts from the Atlantic.
At Mont-Louis, the solar energy laboratory can count on
200 sunny days a year at Meudon, it had 50. For solar
energy purposes, Prof. Trombe explained, the regions near
the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are ideal. Closer to the
Equator, there is too much moisture in the atmosphere.
The first major problem to be overcome in 1949 was one
of cost. To make a parabolic mirror only six
feet in diameter requires a lense costing (Cont'd on
1,500,000 francs ($4,200 or £1,500)... and the next page)

research device. In the old

Pyrenees, flat mirror (right)

the sky and reflects rays to

curved that it concentrates
all rays into the orifice of

parabolic mirror now used at Mont-Louis is more than
30 feet in diameter!
Prof. Trombe and Mr. Foex solved the problem with a low
budget and a great deal of ingenuity. Their parabolic mirror
is the largest in the world, but it consists of nothing more
than 3,500 lozenge-shaped pieces of window glass. Each
piece of window glass is only 1/16" thick and is laterally
warped into the shape of the great parabolic lens by the
pressure of adjustable screws.
In operation, the solar furnace is a weird sight. A flat
mirror 426 square feet in area rises up next to one wall of the
fortress with a great piston behind it to control its

movements. This mirror, consisting in turn of 520 individual
mirrors, has the job of catching the sun at any angle and
sending its rays into the fixed parabolic mirror 80 feet away
which then focuses the rays into the orifice of the solar
furnace placed between the two mirrors, an orifice about as
big as the porthole of a small boat. All of this is done
automatically. One pane on the flat mirror sends the image
of the sun between photo-electric cells. As the sun moves, so
does the image, and photo-electric cells respond, sending an
order down to the pistons which move the flat mirror.
One of the laboratory's engineers started the machinery to
demonstrate how the flat mirror could be moved. It looked
like a great blind animal turning slowly as it worshipped the
sun. Up on the platform between the two mirrors, Prof.
Trombe led me quickly into the tiny shed housing the
furnace. The day was overcast, but I could still feel a breath
of heat from the mirror. "You have to be careful here," he
said, "that mirror once burned the overcoat of a very impor¬
tant visitor."
The furnace stood in the axis of the parabolic mirror. At
a touch of a switch, it began to spin rapidly. In operation,
explained Prof. Trombe, centrifugal force pushes the mineral
under treatment against the jcylindrical wall of the furnace
and forms the "vases'" which I had seen on his desk.
First, a refractory material such as zirconia is produced in
the furnace to form a crucible which can then be used for
making metals, again of pure quality.
The present solar energy plant at Mont-Louis has a power
rating of 75 kilowatts (the equivalent electric furnace would
require a dynamo with a 100 h.p. motor). Prof. Trombe
told the Unesco Courier that plans are now well advanced
for a 1,000-kilowatt solar energy plant (the equivalent of a
1,300 h.p. generator).
A site has not yet been chosen definitely for this new
plant, but it will consist of a parabolic mirror measuring

115 ft. by 165 ft. with an area of 1,793 square yards. With
this new mirror, Prof. Trombe hopes to drive down the cost of
producing refractory materials to one-half that of the elec¬
tric furnace. Even with the present mirror, the plant at
Mont-Louis would pay for itself within five years if it did
nothing but produce refractory materials.
"Of course, we don't," said Prof. Trombe, "We are a
research laboratory, not a factory. Still, running the furnace
commercially only 30 days a year, we produce two tons of
refractory material and, since it's extremely pure, we have
no trouble finding buyers for it."
What of the future? "Solar energy will develop according
to the world's needs and the problems raised by existing
methods of producing energy," said Prof. Trombe.
At Mont-Louis, as elsewhere, experiments are also being
conducted in the heating of buildings by the sun and, not
at all paradoxically, in refrigeration (the use of solar energy
in the refrigeration cycle to replace electricity or a gas flame
as a source of energy has been demonstrated over and over
again and a house in the Sahara air-conditioned by the sun
is not by any means as fantastic as it sounds).
Prof. Trombe firmly believes that in producing high
temperatures for certain metallurgical work, solar energy is
now the most economical source available. The great
stumbling block lies in converting it into motive power.
"As soon as we try to use the sun to heat a boiler, we
are up against the fact that the steam engine is the most
inefficient of all power plants", he said, "It only converts into
energy about five per cent of the calories you put into it.
Under such conditions, it cannot compete with the Diesel
engine as a small power plant for isolated regions."
Prof. Trombe told the Courier, however, that he does see
a possibility of using the sun to drive efficient turbine power
plants of at least 100 h.p. to generate electricity.
"I do not think there is any problem in producing power
after sundown", he declared. "Heat can be stored by certain
materials and, at midnight, we have measured a temperature
of 1,000 degrees Centigrade in our own small furnace. There
is no reason why a solar plant could not supply power during

the peak hours of the evening although you would need an
auxiliary engine, of course, for days when the sun doesn't
shine at all. The economics of solar energy depend on the
availability of other sources of energy."
As I left Mont-Louis, Prof. Trombe and Mr. Foex showed
me another source which has been definitely supplanted.
Less than 20 yards from the high-temperature furnace and
the world's largest parabolic mirror, a door led into a dank
hall where a wooden wheel 15 feet high rose up in the dark¬
ness.
"This is the 'Convicts Well'," said Prof. Trombe, "It worked
in the same way as a squirrel cage only with a man inside
to draw up water from a secret well."
SUN CATCHER, a mirror 40 feet
across and composed of 520 individual
mirrors, rises up next to one wall of
the fortress. It is mounted on a pivot
so that it can do its job of catching the
sun at any angle. Sun's rays, acting on
photo-electric cells, send orders " to
the great piston which controls mirror's
movement. (All photos these pages court¬

### 69047: The Camel: facts and fables
TAKE A DEEP BREATHl I The camel's unique ability to go without drinking water is the result of half a dozen extraordinary gifts that are not shared by
any other animal. While he cannot store water as such, he conserves every drop of water in his body tissues. The camel never pants, never breathes
with mouth open even in the hottest Sanaran weather and perspires so little, because it can regulate its body temperature, that its skin always feels
completely dry. Here Prof. Schmidt-Nielsen uses a special apparatus to measure oxygen consumption on one of his experimental subjects.

THIRSTY CAMELS are the exception rather than the rule. After being
deprived of drinking water for two months, two camels at the Béni Abbês
research centre showed no interest in water when it was offered. They had
obtained enough from the winter desert vegetation. In summer a camel
was kept without water for eight days during which time it lost 100 kilo¬
grams in weight. When given water it drank 103 liters in ten minutes,
thus restoring the lost 1 00 kilograms. Experiments showed that camels
only drink enough to restore normal water content of their bodies.

### 69047: The Camel: facts and fables
THE CAMEL
Facts and Fables
by Bodil and Knut Schmidt-Nielsen
Up until a few months ago, the camel was one of the
great riddles of nature. No one knew how the "ship
of the desert" could survive hard work in the blazing
heat and go for so long without a drop of water. It was
once believed that the camel stored water in its hump and
more commonly that it drank huge quantities of water which
it stored in one of its several stomachs. The mystery of
the camel has now been solved as the result of a pains¬
taking investigation carried out in the North Sahara under
the auspices of the Unesco Advisory Committee on Arid
Zone Research. Working in a region where the temperature
often reached 140 degrees Fahrenheit, a research team led
by Prof. Knut Schmidt-Nielsen of Duke University, U.S.A.,
put the camel through its paces and came up with some
startling findings. In the article published below, specially
written for the Unesco Courier and copyrighted, Professor
Schmidt-Nielsen and his wife describe their experiments
and the results they achieved.
The exceptional abilities of a camel as well as his unusual
appearance have for centuries attracted the attention
of travellers, naturalists, and zoologists. Legends and
fables have been intermingled with factual information,
amazing stories have been told, and it has been difficult to
know whether such accounts represented truth or tale.
The camel is of great value in many desert areas where it
is often the most important domestic animal. Not only is it
the principal beast of burden, but it gives milk and its wool
is used for clothing and tents. In spite of the advancements
in technological culture it is likely that the camel will keep
its present role in the desert economy for long periods to
come. Some factual information on this remarkable animal
is much needed.
Legend has it that the camel can cross the most scorching
desert without water or food. There is no doubt that the
camel has very unusual abilities in this direction, and the
popular appeal of tales of desert adventure has created a
great deal of interest in the endurance of this animal.
It is remarkable to learn how little scientific information
is available about an animal on which people depend for
their livelihood over vast geographical areas. Until recently,
many common questions could not be answered by science,
such as: How long can a camel go without water? How is
it that the camel can get along without water under such
difficult conditions? Does the camel have a store of water
in its body? What is the function of the camel's hump? etc.
A better understanding of the camel and its functions
would be of importance in evaluating the future of arid
lands and programmes for agricultural improvements.
Knowing more about the characteristics that enable the
camel to get along in the desert will perhaps also contribute
to the evaluation of characteristics that make other animals,
such as sheep and cattle, tolerant to an arid climate. It was
therefore natural that Unesco, among other institutions,
supported an expedition on which scientists from Duke Uni¬
versity attempted to find answers to many of the unsolved
problems about the camel. The group consisted of scientists,
the two authors of this article and our excellent collabora¬
tors, Dr. T.R. Houpt from the University of Penn- /cont'd on
sylvania, and the Danish physician Dr. S.A. Jar-
num. Our field studies were carried out in the next PaSe)

Algerian Sahara in 1953-54, with headquarters at the French
research station, Centre de Recherches Sahariennes. Our
work was greatly facilitated by the support and help we
received from the Director of the Centre, Dr. Menchikoff,
and from local French authorities, represented by Capitaine
Lepage at Béni Abbès.
How long can a camel go without water ?
If one asked the question : "How long can a man live
without water?" the answer would depend on the circum¬
stances. In the desert in the summer, it might be one or
two days. But it might be a longer time, perhaps a week, in
a cool climate. Furthermore, if the man had some succulent
food such as melons he could manage for a longer time. In
fact, he might do perfectly well without any drinking water
if he had an adequate supply of juicy fruits such as apples,
oranges, tomatoes and melons.
The same thing goes for the camel; how long it can live
without drinking depends on external conditions. The
answer will depend on factors such as the amount of food and
its water content, how much load the camel carries, how far
it has to travel, the temperature, and also the breed of the
camel, and its condition. It is therefore impossible to say
that any camel can endure abstinence from water for a
certain number of days.
There are two kinds of camel, one-humped and two-
humped. Those we worked with at Béni Abbès were one-
humped camels or dromedaries. The two-humped, or bac-
trian camel belongs to the desert and high plateaus of cen¬
tral Asia, while the one-humped camel is found in the hot
deserts of Arabia and North Africa.
Observing camels in the Sahara Desert, we soon found that
those that were grazing in the winter
were usually not watered at all. This
is not surprising because if it rains the
vegetation in the desert contains a
considerable amount of water. We
examined a number of such camels
that were brought to Béni Abbès to be
butchered. They had been without
drinking water for one or two months,
and one might think that these camels
would be very thirsty, but this was not
the case. If they were offered water
they showed no interest in it whatso¬
ever. However, the winter rains are
very irregular, and in dry winters when
the usual growth of new vegetation is
absent the camels would undoubtedly
have to be watered.
To And out how much water a camel
needs we would have to give them some
dry food instead of the ordinary
pasture. We therefore fed them dry
hay and dry dates. The dates that are
given to camels differ from the sweet,
soft dates eaten by humans, and are
dry, hard and not as sweet. We kept
a camel on this dry feed for several
prolonged periods, the longest being
sixteen days in January. After this,
the camel was rather thirsty but in no
way in serious condition. The conclu¬
sion was that the camel can easily be
without drinking water for more than two weeks in the
winter, even when the feed is dry.
The camel continues to use water during such periods of
water deprivation. Like all mammals, it must use water for
the formation of urine, and water evaporates from the lungs
when it breathes. In the camel the continued loss was
indicated by a decrease of body weight corresponding to the
amount of water used. It continued to eat, and had water
been available it would have maintained its usual body
weight. At the end of the sixteen-day period it drank an
amount corresponding to the expenditure, bringing the body
weight back to normal.
This experiment did not tell us how much depletion of the
body water the camel can withstand. We could have conti¬
nued the experiment to find out, but there were other
pressing problems and we decided to wait until the summer.
Then the rate of water loss would be much higher, and the
camel would become seriously dehydrated in a much shorter
time.
In late June we kept a camel without water for eight days,
and it had then lost 100 kg in weight, the original weight
being 450 kg. It was at this time in a rather serious condi¬
tion from lack of water, and when allowed to drink consum¬
ed 103 litres of water in ten minutes. This experiment shows
that camels can tolerate losing about a quarter of their body
weight in water, and that they can drink it back in a few
minutes.
Another camel that had been subjected to more experi¬
mentation on this ocasión was without water from June 5
to June 22, a total of seventeen days. Both of these
animals were in rather poor condition and had lost their
appetite towards the end of the period. They looked thin
and emaciated. The abdomen was drawn in against the

vertebral column, the muscles were shrunken, the legs were
scrawny and appeared even longer than usual. They would
not have been fit for heavy work or long distance travel in
this condition.
These two camels had been exposed to the hot desert wind
and sun but they had not been worked. Judging from this
experiment it seems likely that even the best camels could
not be used for desert travel without water for much beyond
a week in the summer. However, this depends on so many
factors that extensive investigation under various conditions
would be necessary before definite rules could be given.
Still, it can be stated that the length of time the camel
can live without water far exceeds that of other mammals,
including man. Under similar conditions it is likely that
man would be seriously debilitated and in very poor condi¬
tion after one day's travel in the desert and would probably
die of thirst during the second day.
Unesco Courier. Nr 8-9. 1955
but this is characteristic of all ruminants. However, to
make sure that water was not stored we analyzed the fluid
from the stomachs of a dozen animals. First of all, the fluid
is a rather foul smelling, unappetizing, green fluid with little
similarity to drinking water.
Chemical analysis reveals that it has great similarity to
digestive fluids, and its salt content is closer to that of blood
rather than to water. Furthermore, the so-called "'water
sacs" usually contained masticated food and not much fluid.
We thus found no scientific support of the fable of water
storage.
Although fluid that is found in the camel's stomach is
rather unappetizing it could very well be used for drinking
in an emergency. The tale of the Arab who saves his life
by killing his camel in order to drink the water in its stomach
may be true, and the mistake is made in the implication that
the fluid found is stored water.
Does it really store water?
Many travellers have suggested
that the tolerance of the camel
to lack of water is explained by
a storage of water in the stomach or
other parts of the body. In support
of this view one will often And related
the well-known tale of the Arab who is
out of water in the desert and will kill
his camel as a last resort and drink the
water he finds in its stomach.
It is easy to understand how the idea
of water storage could arise. Before a
longj journey in the desert one would
of cburse water the camels. If they
had been without water for a few days
previously they would consume large
quantities of water, and to the uncri¬
tical observer this might look as if the
saméis were taking in huge quantities
of water in anticipation of the coming
needs. However, as mentioned above, _^
we observed that camels would drink
a quantity of water corresponding to
that which had been lost in the period
of water deprivation, but they would drink no more water
than needed to make up for that lost. We observed no
instance in which a camel drank an excess of water that
could be regarded as storage.
The belief that the camel stores water is widespread, and
has been supported by the fact that the structure of the
stomach is rather unusual. The camel is a ruminant, and
like the cow and sheep it has a stomach that is divided into
several parts or compartments. The first and largest part
is the rumen, which contains the coarsely masticated
fodder.
This rumen has certain sacs in its walls which are not
found in other ruminants, an interesting fact which has
been linked with the legend of water storage. However, the
volume of these little pouches which have been called
"Water sacs" is so small (5 to 7 litres) that they could not
possibly store water in the quantities necessary to meet the
needs of such a large animal.
The rumen of camels does contain large quantities of fluid,
A grain of truth in the hump story
Some people have stated that the camel's hump contains
the camel's water reservoir. However, the camel's
hump is practically exclusively fat and is an energy sto¬
rage just as the fat of other animals. It is a curious fact
that the fat of several animals that live in hot climates is
found in one location rather than distributed over the body.
The Indian or Zebu cattle have a hump over the shoulders,
and the fattailed sheep carries the fat in a tremendously
enlarged tail. To the Arabs the camel's hump is a prized
delicacy, and when camels are butchered the hump often
gets a higher price than the meat. Although it is quite clear
that the hump does not contain water, there is a grain of
truth in the belief that the camel gets water from the hump.
Whenever organic material is burned, water is farmed in the
process. Most people will have noticed that if
a pot of cold water is placed over a fire, water (Cont'd on

water which is formed by oxidation of hydrogen present in
the fuel. In the same way, water is formed when fat is
oxidized in the animal's body. However oxygen is required
for the oxidation, and the air that is pulled into the lungs is
exhaled again, saturated with water vapour.
The amount of water lost this way depends upon tempera¬
ture and humidity, but usually water is lost by evaporation
from the lungs of the camel about as rapidly as it is formed.
Therefore, the fat of the hump does not mean a large extra
storage of water, as was once suggested. However, in
another desert animal, the kangaroo rat, the entire water
economy depends on water formed by oxidation of food.
The camel's body temperature
Most warm-blooded animals maintain a constant body
temperature of around 37 to 40 °C. When man is
exposed to the hot desert environment his body tem¬
perature does not increase, although the air temperature
may be considerably higher than his own body temperature.
Any inanimate object placed in the same surroundings would
heat upTjust as the rocks on the desert surface, which may
reach 60 "C or higher. Man avoids a rise in temperature in
these surroundings by evaporation of water, which appears
on the body surface as sweat.
The camel also regulates its body temperature and keeps it
from rising beyond a dangerous level by sweating. However,
the camel is able to utilize certain variations in the body
temperature to save on the amount of water necessary to
keep cool. Instead of keeping the body temperature
constant as the heat of the day comes on, the camel permits
its body temperature to increase slowly until a maximum of
almost 41°C has been reached. During this period of tem¬
perature increase the camel does not lose much water, while
a man maintaining a constant lower body temperature
would have to evaporate water continually.
It is clear that the' camel would benefit even more if he
could start on the morning of a hot day with a body tempera¬
ture lower than usual. In this way it would take longer
for him to heat up to the critical point where he must start
sweating to avoid further rise and death. This is just what
the camel does, during the cool night he gives off heat so
that his morning temperature may be as low as 34°C.
The body temperature of the camel thus regularly varies
more than ,6°C. Under similar conditions the daily tem¬
perature variations in man are around 1°C.
The human body normally contains about 1/3 solid matter
and 2/3 of water. Only a small fraction of this water can
be lost before serious symptoms occur. The organism reacts
with a craving for water which, if unrelieved, rapidly passes
into discomfort, uneasiness and irritation. These symptoms
are rapidly relieved by drinking water or other fluids.
If the dehydration continues and the water loss exceeds
about 5% of the body weight, the symptoms become more
serious. There is disturbance of the bodily functions, the
salivation becomes scant and the mouth is dry. The tongue
sticks to the mouth, and the inspired air penetrates
unbearably hot into the lungs. The voice becomes cracked
and the senses distorted. The movements become ill-
controlled, and judgment and morale is impaired. The stage
that has been vividly described as "cotton-mouth" occurs
when 6 to 8% of the body weight has been lost.
The symptoms of a water deficit of more than 10% of the
body weight are known mostly from reports of men who have
been lost in the desert, and those are of necessity rather
unprecise. There is delirium, deafness, insensitivity to pain
from bruises and wounds, and no blood or exudate appears
in cuts in the skin. There is an inability to swallow at about
12% water deficit, after which a man is probably unable to
recover without assistance. In the final stages of dehydra¬
tion there is no recovery; the agony is relieved only by a
merciful unconsciousness.
If the heat is not excessive, life may perhaps last until
there is 20% water loss. In the desert heat, however, a mai}
will die at 10 to 12% water loss. This has been explained by
the American physiologist Adolph as "'explosive heat death",
because death comes suddenly, associated with a rapid tem¬
perature increase.
The explosive heat rise is due to the fact that the blood
becomes thicker and more viscous as water is lost. It takes
more work to pump the thick blood, the load on the heart
increases, and as dehydration proceeds further, a point is
reached at which the heart cannot keep up with the increas¬
ed strain. The circulation then slows down, the metabolic
heat is not carried away, and at this point the temperature
of the body rapidly increases and death follows in a short
time.
Defence against explosive heat death
In view of this knowledge it was curious to find that the
camel could tolerate losing as much as 30 % of its body
weight during water deprivation in the hot desert. To
the trained physiologist this seems rather incredible, and
we were interested in the physiological peculiarities that
enabled the camel to escape explosive heat rise.
If it were possible for the camel to maintain its usual blood
volume during dehydration and not give up water from the
blood, the normal circulation could be maintained. The
blood volume can be measured by injecting a non-poisonous
dye into the blood stream and see how diluted this dye
becomes when it is evenly distributed in the blood fluid, a
procedure which is completely harmless. In a camel that
had lost 50 litres of water during water deprivation (20%
weight loss) the reduction in blood volume was less than
1 litre. The rest of the water had therefore been taken from
the tissues and tissue fluids. This places the camel in a
much better position than other mammals, in which the
thickening of the blood is the main cause of the explosive
heat death.
Although the camel needs less water than ICont-d on
other mammals, he has to drink if the feed does l ¿3.

f all the nomads that wander
over the sands of the Sahara there
are none poorer than the Nemadi.
They possess no tents and most of
the time their camp is nothing more
than a hole in the sand or the shelter
afforded by a small bush. In order to
placate the treacherous shifting sand
dunes the Nemadi give them affect¬
ionate names. One they will call
Nebket Naada, "the Round Dune, its
sand so soft for the night is a gazelle's
robe"; another, Elnwurich, the Forest
(there are scarcely three thorny bushes
and a few tufts of alfa grass but their
enthusiasm is so great over so much
shade and miraculous freshness that
they add: "Our camels will be as cool
as at the wells!"). A third dune they
will call Haz ould el Routh, a Fat Pas¬
ture though it needs the eye of a
starving camel or of a poet to spy the
rare tufts of scrub buried here and
there beneath the sands.
When water is nowhere to be found
and the camels collapse on the Nemadi
hunting grounds, the women trace a
clover-shaped cross in the sand. This
is the "Terejanna" or bird of paradise
which will intercede with the Prophet
on behalf of the luckless hunters.

pots (a whole week's work) and endeav¬
ours to reduce the strength of the flame

cunning structure of camel droppings
with green twigs, she too quickly draws
in the sand the sign of the "'good eye".
These patterns in the sand, which
are an appeal to the gods and spirits
and to which are attributed powerful
magical qualities, are basic elements of
Saharan decorative art.
In the Sahara, art finds itself
between two poles Islam and the great
desert. It would seem that it could be
no more than a form of expression
imported from the Orient, an art of
illuminators or of rugmakers applied to
leather, wood and metal.

SAHARAN
ART (Cont'd)
FEAR OF THE ' EVIL EYE
"minor art" which as André Malraux
said "does not express man's spirit."
Yet amid the jigsaw of its geometri¬
cal patterns and despite the limitations
of a conventionalized style almost
devoid of feeling, the personal, indivi¬
dual character of Saharan art is ever-
present. The people of the Sahara
tell us their story through their artists,
the Tuareg "Enhaden" and the Moorish
"Mâlemin".
They tell us of their wells, their
flocks and gazelles, of their houses
practically devoid of furniture, of God,
of the "Peoples of the Empty Spaces',
the "Sons of the Devil", the evil eye,
scorpions and vipers, thirst and the
sand-blown winds.
Saharan art might
be little more than an
art of fear if it did not
also reveal man's
positive stand face to
face with the Universe,
and express his subdual
of superior, hostile
forces through rites
and symbolic decora¬
tions which are as
moving as prayers
written with threads
of wool on a carpet or
engraved by chisel on
copper or silver.
Viewed in this light
the art of these shield
decorators is nearer to
conquest than to sub¬
mission. The nomad
ends by believing that
the wind, the tracks
and the wells can be
tamed, that agreement
can be reached with
the gazelles, the ostri¬
ches, the bustards and
the guinea-fowl. He
feels freed from some
of his fears, and
master of the desert
and his own destiny.
All marabouts (holy
men) are well acquaint¬
ed with the magic
attributed to numbers
and letters. Each letter
has a sacred meaning
and letters are used to
compose Koranic amu¬
lets and talismans. As
Jean Marques-Rivière has written,
"Islamic tradition, like the Talmud,
teaches that the letters of the
alphabet are the essence of things,
related to the celestial spheres, the
signs of the Zodiac and the four ele¬
ments." Thus we find the Saharan
people, and particularly the Moors,
using letters as sacred decorative motifs
in sheepskin rugs, jugs, wooden bowls,
jewellery and even on the doors and
walls of houses.
Numbers are used to inscribe the
name of Allah on rings, pectoral pla¬
ques, pendants and bits of paper placed
in special leather bags. The number
five is considered particularly sacred.
It represents the famous hand of
Fathma as well as the five sacred
personages (Mohammed, Ali, Fatima,
Hassan and Hussain). It also symbo¬
lizes Providence and the epitome of
Law and Religion. Because of this it
recurs not only in jewellery but in
practically every form of ornamenta¬
tion.
Berber crosses and certain leather
bags (tassoufra) show the multiple use
of the number five in decoration as
pearls of silver, as dots in the centre of
a pattern, as cruciform motifs, as five-
pointed stars and as two crosses of
St. Andrew transformed into an eight-
pointed star.
Fear of the evil eye is extremely
common among the nomad tribes of
the desert and particularly so among
the Berbers. To ward off its evil
Routes taken by Jean Gabus during the expeditions he made between I 942 and
1953 are shown on this map, together with the names of several tribes and
places he refers to in his article. This map, taken from his book " Au Sahara,

influence, the triangle (a form of styliz¬
ed eye) is one of the protective symbols
used. It appears, for example, in the
form of heavy pectoral pendants worn
in southern Morocco, the Sudan and
other regions of the desert. The
Tuaregs, who have carried the art of
making camel saddles to the height of
perfection, adorn their saddle bags to
an amazing extent ' with leather tri¬
angles. They also put a cluster of
leather triangles, painted in green, on
the tassels and fringes which hang
from the saddles themselves.
Against the powers of the evil eye
there also stands the "good eye". A
mirror, a piece of glass, shining jewel¬
lery or stones anything in fact that
glitters will do the trick. All of these
substances figure frequently in the de¬
corative motifs of Saharan art. But
belief in the magical powers of the
"good eye" is so powerful and so much
part and parcel of everyday life that it
often takes a more utilitarian character
than mere artistic expression.
A circle inscribed with a line or a
circle with a dot in the middle is often
drawn rapidly in the sand to answer a
specific need. This we have already
seen in the two examples cited at the
beginning of this article.
A star drawn on the palm of the
hand by Nemadi women on the eve of
a long voyage is another way of pro¬
tecting oneself against the evil eye.
Then of course there are many Koranic
talismans, known as "kitaba" amongst
the Tuaregs, which are
little bags of leather
or silver containing
verses of the Koran,
one or several names
of God, magic symbols
and letters of the
Arabic alphabet, num¬
bers, the names of
days of the week, of
planets and various
signs representing the
eye.
There are many
other ways of warding
off the evil eye. The
Peuls and Mozambites
tattoo inscriptions on
their bodies, while on
the occasion of certain
feasts Tuareg girls
paste little green
triangles on the paint
covering their faces.
We should not as¬
sume, however that,
because magic pervades
Saharan art, this
prevents the artists
from being realists or
even trivial. Thus two
matmakers, Aicha and
Lalia, who were sitting
- shivering in front of
their tent one icy
morning in the Sahara,
clamoured for "hot
tea to warm our
bones" at seven a.m.;
then for "three more
glasses with plenty of
	 sugar" at 11 a.m., wail¬
ing "our backs ache
and if we don't regain
some strength the brush will drop from
our fingers." At three in the afternoon
they asked for more tea, this time the
five Moorish glasses, "'because it is too
hot!"
But their old, half-withered hands
wove strips of leather into the mats
with designs expressing "'the young
girl's laughter" and "the wings of the
turtle dove" guaranteeing that "this
will bring happiness to the house."
Then there was Meimouna in the
camp of Ould Oumer, Emir of Trarza.
Though the symbolic motifs she was
painting on a "faro" (sheepskin carpet)
were meant to ensure prosperity in her
master's house, she seemed in no way
awed by the magic part of her art.
She spat, blew her nose with her fin¬
gers, told a bawdy joke or
two and all the while (Cont ° °n

'FORGOTTEN OF GOD'
In the middle of the Sahara live the Tuareg
tribesmen, a Berber people whose name,
given to them by the Arabs, means "Forgotten
of God". The Tuaregs however call them¬
selves Imohar or nobles. Mounted on swift
mehari (white thorough-bred speed camels)
Tuareg warriors can cover unbelievable dist¬
ances even during the hottest season.
Though Moslems, their womenfolk are not
veiled ; instead the men usually are, so as
to protect their faces from the sun and desert
winds. Above right, a Tuareg nobleman
from the Hoggar region in the south Algerian
territories. Above left, a young Tuareg girl.
Note huge earrings worn. Cross of Agades
tipped with green triangles is painted on face
for festive occasions and dances. The trian¬
gle helps to ward off the "evil eye". Right, a
camel-mounted Tuareg brandishes his enor¬
mous shield, called "arar". This famous
shield is made from the skin of a whole oryx,
a type of gazelle or antelope. Despite the
fact that it is heavy and cumbersome the
Tuareg takes the greatest pride in his shield.
He uses it not only as a weapon but also as a
wind and sand break by propping it against
his camel's cross-pommelled saddle. The
kind of St. Andrew's cross with projections on
upper part of the shield is supposed to possess
magical qualities and ward off evil spirits.

the seriousness of her explanations, the
slightest trifle, like a shepherd passing
by with a calabash of milk, or the cry
of a meat vendor, was enough to make
her stop abruptly and blurt out: "My
stomach comes first. It is more
important to get some food into it
every day than to put paint on walls."
But triviality on the part of an artist
in the Sahara is the mark of a caste
which is both feared and despised, as
well as the mark of close acquaintance¬
ship with a craft which is half magic.
But it is also true that one spoken
word too many may arouse the spirits
and result in reprisals. The artists
believe in the preventive powers
of their symbols even when they cannot
explain them.
Tuareg decorations adhere closely to
the fundamental symbols found in
Moorish patterns. The Tuaregs seek
protection from the evil eye and
believe in the curative and preventive
powers of copper and cornelian and
in the malefic influence of iron. They
believe in infernal creatures inhabiting
the Empty Spaces, the Night and the
Dunes, against whom they protect
themselves by means of rites, amulets
and symbolic decorations.
They admit all this but do not ask
themselves too many questions. These
are the myth-realities of everyday life,
the constant small reminders that the
winds, the earth, the trees and other
substances have changing moods
which can be countered by merely
taking simple precautions like eating,
drinking and sleeping. Through their
art they thus reveal the symbiosis or
communion with nature which the
anthropologist Radclifle-Brown speaks
about. Their religion and the magic
which is part of it are deeply embedded
in their lives.
To get some idea of the many
factors that must be taken into account
in making even a simple instrument,
let us take a look at a dagger made at
Iforas, a frontier zone between the
Tuareg country and Mauritania.
First there is the foreign origin of
the iron, then the magical properties
of the materials used, and then the
symbolism of the decoration. But the
dagger also tells us the story of the
frontier which separates the Moors
from the Tuaregsi two distinct ethnic
and linguistic groups and two different
cultures living almost side by side in
the Sahara.
The blade was a diamond-shaped
French bayonet sold by a Senegalese
rifleman stationed at one of the
desert outposts. The handle was
Moorish in shape but in Mauritania it
would be considered of Moroccan
inspiration. The ornaments inlaid In
the wood were also based on Moorish
techniques of jewellery making: little
pieces of silver skilfully worked with the
point of a needle into twin "waous"

HYDROPONICS
Farmers grow food
crops without soil
by J. W. E. H. Sholto Douglas
(USIS)
Every large city of the globe including New York, London, Paris, Calcutta, Buenos Aires, Rome and
Tokyo, could now be made completely self-supporting in vegetables by the large-scale adoption of
hydroponics, a new science which enables people to grow food simply without the use of soil. Hydro¬
ponics is still believed by many to be a complicated, expensive business, but new simplified methods
evolved by scientists in recent years have now made it extremely economical. Tomatoes, rice, potatoes,
maize, peas, lettuce, French beans, and a host of other vegetables have not only been grown successfully
by hydroponics but yields are sometimes four times as high as those obtained by conventional methods
in soil. Photo above right, shows American pomologist (fruit tree expert) growing apple trees in large
pots filled with sterile sand to which nutrient elements are added. Above, hydroponicum in Japan.

Ever sinc£..the publication in 1798
of Malt.hus' Essay on Population,
there have been periodical warn¬
ings that in time mankind would face
starvation, owing to the number of the
world's inhabitants outgrowing the
available food supplies. Fortunately,
this grim prediction has not yet come
to pass. True, the possibility still
remains, but the immense advances
made in agricultural science, and the
consequent increased production, seem
to have staved off disaster. at any
rate for the time being. Nevertheless,
nothing would be more ill-advised than
an attitude of complacency. Although
food surpluses may arise in some areas,
there can be actual famine in others.

from being solved as ever, and it is
likely to remain so until new methods
of producing food in the areas where it
is most needed are introduced on a
large scale.
One of the most promising of the
new methods is soilless cultivation. It
is not generally realized that a way of
cultivating food crops without using
any soil at all has been evolved. Also
known as hydroponics a word derived
from the Greek, meaning "water-work¬
ing", as opposed to geoponics or agric¬
ulture, meaning "care of the earth"
this growing of plants without soil has
now become a practical proposition.
Many successful installations are flour¬
ishing in various parts of the world,
in all kinds of climatic conditions.
By divorcing food production from
the soil, hydroponics enables countries
lacking fertile farmland to grow all
the crops they need to nourish their
people. It is no exaggeration to say
that the introduction of soilless culti
vation on a large scale can provide the
solution to the problem of local hunger.
Excellent crops can be grown without
soil, at low cost and with a minimum
of trouble, in places where convention¬
al methods of agriculture are impos¬
sible. By bringing cheap and nourish¬
ing foodstuffs within the reach of all,
hydroponics offers something of real
value to humanity.
Hydroponics is the art and science of
growing plants without soil by feeding
them on chemical solutions. Crops
can be raised in the absence of organic
matter simply by giving them in arti¬
ficial form the nutrients which they
usually draw from the earth through
their roots. The basic principles of
soilless culture are not new. In fact,
for nearly a century workers have been
producing plants for physiological
experiments in their laboratories by
the use of similar methods, but until a
few years ago nobody had thought of
adapting or applying such ideas to

practical or commercial food production.
Indeed, the sole object of water
culture experiments was to enable the
farmer to make better use of his soil.
Then, suddenly, amazing results were
obtained by Californian researchers
who managed to raise crops without
any soil at all, by growing them out of
doors in nutrient solutions or inert
media moistened by cultural infusion.
This was the beginning of a new and
successful method of crop growing.
The study of crop nutrition began
thousands of years ago, long before the
time of Aristotle. Ancient history
recounts that various experiments were
undertaken by Theophrastus (372-287
B.C.), while several writings of Dios-
corides on botany and its allied sub¬
jects, dating from the first century A.D.,
are still in existence. The earliest
scientific approach to the question, how¬
ever, was that of F. Wood¬
ward (1699), who worked in (Cont'd on

to see whether it was the water or the
solid particles of soil that nourished the
plants. At the time, it was commonly
believed that "'for nourishment of
vegetables the water is almost all in
all". Van Helmont had grown a
willow for five years in an earthen
vessel containing 200 pounds of soil to
which nothing had been added except
rain water or distilled water, and had
produced a tree weighing 169 pounds at
an expenditure of only 2 ounces of soil.
ornato vines
25 feet high
But Woodward has recorded his
disagreement with the current
ideas. He wrote that "earth and
not water is the matter that constitutes
vegetables". His conclusion was based
upon experiments in which he grew
spearmint in glasses containing water
from various sources, methodically
recording the initial and final weights
of the plants and the total amount of
the liquid consumed. He observed that
the addition of an ounce and a half of
garden soil to the water increased the
"terrestial matter" and consequently
the growth of the plants.
Handicapped as they were by lack
of equipment, investigators of those
times could make little progress. But
modern chemistry, built up during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
subsequently revolutionized scientific
research. The experiments of Sir
Humphrey Davy, inventor of the
safety-lamp, had evolved a method of
effecting chemical decomposition by
means of an electric current. Several
of the elements which go to make up
matter were brought to light, and it
was now possible for chemists to split
up a compound into its constituent
parts.
By 1842, a list of nine elements known
to be essential to plant growth had been
made out, and the discoveries of the
German workers, Sacha and Knopp, in
the years 1859-65, resulted in the
development of a technique of soilless
culture in the laboratory. The addi¬
tion of a chemical to water was found
to produce a nutrient solution which
would support plant life, so that by
1920 the laboratory preparation of
water culture had been standardized
and the methods of conducting trials
were well established.
Until 1928, however, the phrase
"crops without soil" was virtually
unknown. The value of the discoveries
had not been realized. In that year,
Robbins, working at the New Jersey
Experiment Station, suggested that
sand culture had possibilities for
research and commercial work in
horticulture. This was followed by a
similar announcement from Biekart
and Connors, of the same institution.
At Ohio State University, Laurie issued
an account of thé trials carried out
there with washed -¿sand in greenhouse
culture.
A further step was taken in 1929
when Professor W. F. Gericke, of the
University of California, succeeded in
growing tomato vines 25 feet in height.
Even the most incredulous critics were
impressed. A new factor had suddenly
appeared and was making itself felt in
the world of practical and scientific
agriculture. Such a novel technique
was bound to attract attention. The
American press hailed it as one of the
most colossal inventions of the century,
reporting -. with magnificent abandon
. that farmlands had become relics of
'the past.. Many extravagant and ir¬
responsible claims were made for the
new science, which could not at that
time be justified.
Although hydroponics had broken
laboratory bounds and in one stride
entered the world of practical horti¬
culture, it was still an involved and
complicated technique. Because of
this, and the fact that the different
functions of the various parts of the
necessary apparatus were imperfectly
understood, early sensational publicity
threatened to destroy its future. Un¬
scrupulous adventurers attempted to
"cash in" on the discovery by selling
useless equipment at fantastic prices to
the ignorant or the credulous. Fortu¬
nately, experienced research workers
and scientific institutions continued to
give hydroponics considerable thought
and attention.
Despite the excellent reports of its
efficacy as a means of crop production,
hydroponics had not spread among the
general public. This was mainly due
to the elaborate apparatus and equip¬
ment required for the operation of the
methods advocated up to quite recently.
Planting in rock
cinders and sand
The world war of 1939-1945 resulted
in a spread of hydroponic cul¬
tivation to many different areas,
and a general realization of the im¬
mense possibilities of soilless growth
began to dawn upon agronomists every¬
where. In 1946 research studies were
commenced at the Government of
Bengal's experimental station at Ka-
limpong, in India, with the object of
introducing a simple and practicable
technique, suitable for popular use.
In 1948 it was possible to announce
the development of the Bengal system
of hydroponics, which incorporated
substantial modifications of all previ¬
ous practice. The plants could be
grown in troughs built from any suit¬
able material, and filled with a mixture
of five parts of rock chips, leached
cinders, gravel, or broken bricks, of
five-eighths to one-quarter inch grade,
and two parts of sand. Substitutes, "
such as peat, could also be employed.
The nutrients are applied dry, at
regular intervals, in stipulated ratio to.
the area of the bed surface, either as
fertilizer grade chemicals, or as syn¬
thetic resins. Packeted powdered
compounds or tablets can be utilized.
After application, the salts have to be
watered in with a light, spray of water,
if there is no rain.
No elaborate equipment is required
for a hydroponicum of this kind, and
extensive use may be made of local
indigenous materials. Simple rules
must be followed by the grower, but if
these are carefully adhered to, -anyone
can use the method without special
knowledge or training. The Bengal
system of hydroponics, adapted and
modified for different climatic zones
and conditions, is today rapidly spread¬
ing throughout the world and becoming
very popular on account of its com¬
parative simplicity, economy, and its
easy installation.
Greenstuff in
any odd corner
WB
Today hydroponics is an established
branch of agronomical science.
Progress has been rapid, and the
results obtained during the past five
n years in various countries, including
the work conducted in Bengal, have
proved it to be thoroughly practical and
have some very definite advantages
over normal soil culture. The two chief
merits of hydroponics are, first, much
higher crop yields, and second, the
fact that it can be used in places
where ordinary agriculture or garden¬
ing is impossible.
Not only is it a profitable undertak¬
ing, but it enables people living in
crowded cities to grow fresh vegetables
in window boxes or on house roofs.
Town residents and workers in indus¬
trial settlements often have verandahs,
backyards or pavements of which they
can generally make little use. By
means of hydroponics all such odd
corners can be made to yield a regular
and abundant supply of greenstuff.
Other possibilities are factory roofs or
disused roads. Not only town dwellers,
but also country residents, can profit
from soilless culture. Deserts, rocky
and stony ground in mountainous dis¬
tricts, or barren and sterile areas can
be made productive at relatively low
cost. It is no exaggeration to say
that hydroponics can mean as much
to the landless worker
as the abolition of Slav- (Contdon
ery did in the past. page 46)

Millions of tons of nourishing foods could be grown in hydroponicums. Not only could immense barren
lands be made productive but crops might also be raised in sterile and arid regions such as the Sahara

tories of Australia, Canada and Patagonia. Left, on Tokyo hydroponic farm some of crops are started in

The U.S.A. is the original home of hydroponics. Here it has been developed more than in any other count¬
ry. Many techniques are used but very often they are too complicated for the general public. But where
equipment can be afforded results have been excellent. A large part of the tomato crop of California, for
example, is raised by hydroponics. U.S. Army and Air Force now have Hydroponics Branches to provide fresh
vegetables to overseas personnel. Left,- Air Force man inspects tomato crop in Hawaii; right, workers

Apart from the advantages already
mentioned, there are others, in parti¬
cular quick growth combined with
relative freedom from soil diseases, and
very consistent crops, the quality of the
produce being excellent. There is also
a considerable reduction in growing
area, weeds are practically non¬
existent, while standard methods and
automatic operation mean less labour,
less cost and no hard manual work.
As many plants can be raised out of
season, better control of crops naturally
results; moreover there is no dirt and
no smell. Waterlogging never occurs,
owing to good drainage.
Nor does the use of hydroponics alter
the taste of a crop in any way. In
fact, the piquant savour of soilless-
cultured produce cannot be found any¬
where else in agriculture. There is no
other distinction between a chemically
grown plant and a naturally raised one
in point of flavour, nor have analyses
shown any vitamin content differences.
The real development of soilless
cultivation began when, having broken
laboratory bounds, it was taken up by
government departments and commer¬
cial organizations. The first great
achievement came when Pan-American
Airways decided to establish a hydro-
ponicum on distant and barren Wake
Island in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean, in order to provide the passen¬
gers and crews of the airliners with
regular supplies of fresh vegetables.
In 1945 the British Air Ministry took
steps to commence soilless culture at
the desert air base of Habbaniyah in
Iraq, and at the arid island of Bahrein
in the Persian Gulf.
Some of the most successful installa¬
tions have been those at military bases,
notably in British Guiana, Iwojima and
Ascension Island. American headquar¬
ters in Japan started with 16 five-acre
units devoted to vegetable growing,
while various oil companies in the West
Indies operating on barren or isolated
islands, especially off the Venezuelan
coast at Aruba and Curacao, have
found soilless culture invaluable for

ensuring that their employees get a
regular ration of greenstuff.
In the continental United States
itself there are extensive commercial
hydroponicums, especially in Illinois,
Ohio, California, Indiana and Florida.
New Yorkers are taking increasingly to
skyscraper gardening. Russia, France,
Canada, South Africa and Germany
are among other countries where
hydroponics has received attention.
The English carnation growing indus¬
try has partly switched over from soil
to soilless methods.
It is also of interest to note that a
primitive form of hydroponics has been
carried on in Kashmir for centuries.
Visitors to that state will have observed
light frameworks of branches, covered
with rotting vegetation, floating on the
numerous lakes. Excellent crops are
raised by the local peasantry from
these rafts which provide both water
and nutrients to the growing plants.
The simplified Bengal methods are ra¬
pidly spreading in Southern Asia, the
adjacent areas, and South and East
Africa. Australia and New Zealand
have also expressed great interest in
these new techniques.
Wastelands could bloom
In fact, soilless cultivation, conducted
according to the new simplified
methods, can make all the large
cities of the globe, such as New York,
London, Paris, Calcutta, Buenos Aires,
Rome and Tokyo, self-supporting in all
vegetables, thus leaving the available
fertile country farmlands free to
concentrate on cereal production.
Millions of tons of nourishing foodstuffs
could be grown in hydroponicums. Not
only could immense barren lands be
made productive, but crops might also
be raised in sterile and arid regions,
such as the Sahara Desert, the wastes
of Arabia or Central Asia, the "bad¬
lands" of the Middle West of America,
the rocky highlands of Japan, or the
undeveloped territories of Australia,
Canada, and Patagonia.
It is not claimed that hydroponics
should replace agriculture, but it has
been proved beyond doubt that waste
land, rocks, even house-tops and back-
verandahsranywhere that sufficient
sunshine and water are available can
be made to bloom and bear at little
cost in money and trouble.
Where water is scarce it will be better
conserved by running the available
supply into controlled hydroponic beds
than by dissipating it recklessly over
the earth, as is done in ordinary irri¬
gation, and so losing over half in eva¬
poration.
To sum up: hydroponics has already
reached the stage where it is a practical
proposition; it is profitable in almost
any conditions; and it is invaluable as
a means of food production in countries
or areas which have not enough fertile
soil to feed their population.

T NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS
Contrary to popular belief rain is not completely unknown In the great deserts of the
world. When desert rains do come, they often descend in brief but torrential downpours.
Rainfall in the desert is so undependable though that permanent streams cannot exist.
(Rivers like the Nile that flow through deserts obtain their water from sources beyond
the desert area.) But here and there among the most forbidding of desert wastelands an
occasional green oasis flourishes. Water usually comes from underground streams which
seep to the surface and permit vegetation and trees to bloom. Photo, above, was taken in
Algerian oasis after flash storm flooded the area. Arab inhabitants quickly took to make¬
shift rafts. Another aspect of the desert countenance is shown in photo, below, of the
ancient oasis city of^Palmyra in Syria with its carefully tended palm groves. In walled
enclosures (foreground) are young palms protected from the searing desert winds.

NATURE'S
ARID LAND
MYSTERIES
by Dr. H. I. S. Thirlaway
What strikes a traveller going north from Karachi on
the southern coast of West Pakistan to Lahore up
in the Punjab or wandering over the Baluchistan
plateau, is the vastness of the barren land that stretches
with little variation as far as the eye can reach. The oases
inside this desert zone are the irrigated and cultivated patches
of land on both sides of the rivers, the canals which flow
from the rivers, and the isolated orchards which thrive on
water from underground springs or brought to them by
karezes (man-made underground channels), from a meagre
reservoir hidden many miles away in the bleak hills. But
many a farmer who has no access to water either from
spring or reservoir, tills his land, dumps any manure he can
get, then waits for the merciful heavens to pour down.
This is the arid and semi arid land of West Pakistan, a
zone with an area of nearly 250,000 square miles, covering
Baluchistan, Sind and the major portion of the Punjab.
The total annual rainfall does not normally exceed five inches
in Baluchistan and is less than ten inches elsewhere in the
country excepting the extreme northern portions where the
rainfall is nearly fifty inches in the year.
The development of the arid lands in Pakistan, and for
that matter anywhere else in the world, entails scientific
research and application on many problems including the
procurement of more water either from the sky above or the
ground below, the conservation of the available water, and
its economical use for the growth of plants. The utilization
of the huge quantity of energy from the sun's rays beating
down on these lands is another problem of great importance.
In some of the schemes designed to develop the productive
capacity of the arid zone of West Pakistan, the national
Meteorological Service is immediately involved. The two
most obvious problems of interest to the meteorologist are
the Increase of natural rain by artificial means and the
utilization of solar energy, though his services are
appreciated when given in co-operation with other research
Dr. H.I.S. Thirlaway, British seismologist, is a member of the Geology Department
of the University of Sydney. Since 1951 he has been working in Pakistan with
a (/nesco team of scientists which is co-operating with Pakistan in harnessing the
country's natural resources, both above and below ground. He has been particu¬
larly associated with the development of Pakistan's Geophysical Observatory at
Quetta.

The size of a raindrop, a subterranean dynamite explo¬
sion, and the measurement of water flow and of the
sun's energy don't seem to have much in common. But
for scientists working in Pakistan's Geophysical Obser¬
vatory at Quetta they are raw materials from which
solutions to Pakistan's arid zone problems will be found.
Since 1951, a Unesco Geophysical Mission has been
operating in Pakistan under the U.N. Expanded Techni¬
cal Assistance Programme. It has co-operated with
Pakistani scientists in harnessing the country's natural
resources, both above and below ground. Photos

Karl Wienart
The Pakistan Meteorological Service has established at
Quetta, with technical assistance from trNEsco, a geophysical
observatory which is already equipped for research in prob¬
lems not only of artificial rain, water economy of desert
plants and use of solar energy but also in arid zone hydrology
with special reference to underground water resources.
The Meteorological Department was keenly interested in
finding whether artificial increase of rain over the arid areas
was feasible and if so whether it was economical to launch
on a long scale and long term project.
Dr. Fournier d'Albe, the unesco expert from France who
worked with the department for nearly three years, set about
this problem in a methodical manner. He first established
five stations in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Peshawar and
Quetta for taking regular bi-weekly samples of the air near
the ground. These samples were analyzed at the Quetta
Geophysical Observatory and inferences were drawn about
the natural concentration of hygroscopic particles.
Of all the aspects of cloud formation and rain, there is
only one that man can hope to modify. Changing the dimen¬
sions of a cloud or increasing its water capacity is beyond
human power at present. But if all the water in the cloud
does not fall down as rain, just because the cloud lacks
suitably big water droplets, this defect can be remedied. The
cloud can be charged with particles hygroscopic in nature,
which will form big droplets about fourhundredths of a
millimeter in diameter which will grow at the expense of
the minute smaller droplets in the cloud to raindrop size of
about a millimeter in diameter. This is the principle behind
seeding the clouds with hygroscopic particles.
One has to know first, however, whether any deficiency or
lack of big hygroscopic particles actually exists. The results
of Dr. Fournier's analysis of the hygroscopic particle content
of the air of West Pakistan brought out the futility of any
scheme to increase rain over Sind, the southern province of
West Pakistan. Here there are already too many of the
hygroscopic nuclei present, and the causes for scanty rainfall
are to be accounted for by shallow cloud formations. But
the field looked promising in the central and northern
Punjab where the lack of nuclei coincides with formations
of cumuliform clouds the type which readily use up the
supply of material used for aiding big drop formation.
The experiments were conducted, one in Mardan in July
1953 and the other over the central Punjab in the monsoon
of 1954. The Mardan experiments brought out the inade¬
quacy of ground seeding with sprayers of salt solution but
indicated clearly that the seeding of the atmosphere from
the ground with the most readily available hygroscopic
substance namely common salt, was not quite ineffective.
A new technique was devised at Quetta by Dr. Fournier and
the team of young Pakistani scientists to seed the atmosphere
directly with salt particles of the required size.
Careful calculations showed that if a salt particle sent up
from the ground has any chance of reaching the cloud base,
it should weigh between one thousandth and one hundredth
of a microgram. Salt had to be ground to this size if any
use was to be made of it. Also salt, being hygroscopic, had
to be kept dry during its preparation into powder and up
to the time of its leaving the generator at the ground. For
this reason, the grinding of salt was done at Quetta where
the humidity of the atmosphere was very low at the time of
preparation. The ordinary grinders for domestic use in
Pakistan were found to be ideal instruments for powdering
the salt lumps to particles of the required size. Empty
kerosene tins were purchased, the seeding material was
packed in them, and the tins sealed against outside air.
The technique of salt dispersal was designed with a view
to cheapness, effectiveness and the availability of all
materials in the country itself. The final set-up turned out
to be very satisfactory. An ordinary silversmith's blower was
fitted to the top of the tin containing the salt particles
through a bent inlet tube carrying a gauze basket containing
burning charcoal. Another outlet tube was fitted to the tin
and air was forced in at high pressure by means of the
blower. The air stream that rushed out of the tin, was warm,
thanks to the hot charcoal, and carried with it the salt
particles. The heat given to the outgoing air was meant
to give the particles an initial lift before they are carried
up by the turbulent eddies in the atmosphere near the
ground. A series of tests showed that by this method, one
tin full of salt particles could be sent up in less
than three quarters of an hour. This meant (Cont d on
dispersal of nearly one thousand million particles next page)

PAKISTAN-UNESCO
RESEARCH (Cont'd) Shock-waves track underground water
per second ! The whole mechanism only cost 75 Pakistani
rupees, or about £8 sterling.
On the roof of the Meteorological Office in Lahore and the
High School building in Jauharabad in the Thai area about
200 miles west northwest of Lahore, the blower mechanism
for seeding with salt particles was in operation from early
morning till sunset on days when the wind blew from an
easterly direction. The Lahore station was in charge of
Mr. A.M.A. Lateef and the Jauharabad station under Mr. S. I.
Rasool, both young and enthusiastic scientists who worked
under Dr. Fournier from the early days of his mission in
Pakistan. Seeding was done at Lahore and Jauharabad on
39 days during the two months' period of the trials.
The increased rainfall in the seeded areas has induced
optimistic views about the efficacy of this new technique.
Statistical evaluation of the results has borne out that there
was a significant increase in the rainfall over the seeded
areas when checked with the rainfall of the previous forty
years over the seeded and adjoining areas. Considering that
not more than 5,000 Pakistani rupees were spent for the
whole project, including allowances to the staff and purchase
of equipment and materials, the method appears indigenously
suitable and further proposed tests to confirm the 1954 results
for the same period in 1955, should help in evolving a general
scheme for artificial rainmaking on a routine basis for the
arid areas of Punjab.
The long stretch of land flanked by hills, beginning from
Mästung in the state of Kalat and extending southward to
about 30 miles past Mästung, is a valley where barren fields
and green orchards alternate every few miles. The orchards
round Mästung grow on water fed into them from deep-
seated underground springs. The fields to the south are at
the mercy of the seasonal rains.
Explosions from dawn till dusk
Early in February 1955, the seismology section of the
Observatory under my direction, took their instruments
to this valley and with the co-operation of the Geolo¬
gical Survey of Pakistan, determined the thickness of the
gravel layers which store water.
This typical upland valley zone about 25 miles long by
six miles wide south of Mästung, was chosen for the work
at the suggestion of M. Chleq of the tjntaa, who was operating
a pilot project in the area, and the work was financed by
the Baluchistan States Union.
Excellent co-operation and team spirit between the
Observatory headed by Mr. Moiduddin Ahmed and the Geolo¬
gical Survey headed by Mr. Mannan Khan, and the super¬
vision and assistance which M. Chleq and I were able to give
resulted in a thorough searching for the knowledge that
could lead to Pakistan's most precious mineral water.
The method employed is called by seismologists "refraction
shooting". It consists in recording, at a central station, the
time taken for the shock waves produced by a series of
dynamite explosions at a distance of 100 yards to a mile,
to reach the special detectors buried a foot beneath the
surface. The further the explosions from the detectors, the
deeper the layers which transmit the shock waves. For
example at distances up to 1,000 feet between the explosions
and the detectors, the shock waves were transmitted by the
water table about 50 feet below the surface of the valley.
The time taken for the shock waves to reach the detectors
can be measured in thousandths of a second since the instant
of the explosion is recorded by the breaking of an electric
cable wrapped round the dynamite. The depth of the water
table is calculated from the time intervals so measured.
Similarly at distances between 1,000 and 5,000 feet the
shock waves received on the recorder were found to have
been transmitted along a rocky layer between 400 feet and
600 feet below the surface. From the geological conditions
seen at the surface, this deep layer can be regarded as the
"floor" of the valley and the thickness of the material lying
on this floor gave a measure of the amount of water bearing
gravels available for tapping by tube wells.
Day after day, for nearly four weeks, regular explosions
from dawn to dusk broke the age-old silence of the valley.
It was wintertime and only a few watchmen were left in
the mud villages clustered round the sides of the valley
where drinking water flows out from limestone rocks. The
poor folk in these villages, who cannot afford warm clothing,
50
had migrated to the warmer plains. The few who remained
tilled the dry fields, hoping for the seasonal rains in February
and March to begin germination.
With tube wells to tap the known resources of deep under¬
ground water, irrigation will be possible for the first time
in this valley, the population will grow in numbers and
wealth, and for the first time, they will be able to afford the
warm clothes and fires which will remove the need for the
wasteful unproductive annual migration.
It was to this object that the seismologists contributed
their quota of information as at sunset every evening they
stored their equipment in tents, lit their lamps and settled
down to a welcome pot of tea to the accompaniment of the
rhythmic drone of the portable generators charging batteries
ready for the next day's "shooting".
How thirsty is a fruit tree?
Four weeks of investigation throughout the length of the
valley enabled contours of the underground structure to
be drawn accurately and thus helped to site tube wells
in the most productive places. The seismologists and their
bangs gave way to the drillers and their rigs.
When water is found and developed by irrigation engineers,
the work of the scientists would seem to be at an end. All
that remains is for the farmer to grow his produce. But all
over the world the tendency is to use too much water in
irrigated areas. Rights to such a precious commodity are
jealously guarded.
How much water does a fruit tree need? The scientist must
come back again to give the answer. At Quetta Observatory
there are 100 fruit trees of 20 different kinds, and of 5
varieties each. To each tree a measured amount of water
is given, a great deal to some, very little to others. Each
day the growth and condition of each tree is measured and
compared. The trees are now three years old. By the time
they are 10 years old we will be able to answer much more
accurately than ever before, the question "how much water
does a fruit tree need ?" The answer will help to conserve
the available water resources, and to use them more effi¬
ciently and economically.
Before the establishment of the Geophysical Observatory
at Quetta, no regular quantitative measurements were being
taken in Pakistan of the solar radiation energy reaching
the surface of the earth. The atmospheric physics section
set up by Dr. Fournier and his Pakistani counterparts at
Quetta, began measuring the solar energy over Quetta by
means of standard meters. The observations began in
October 1952 and are being continued. These constitute an
incomparable set of values due to the large percentage of
clear sky days at Quetta permitting observations on an
average of 330 days in the year. Preliminary analysis of the
collected data has been done by Mr. Shafi Ahmed, who is
now specializing in this branch. These data provide the
basic material required for any serious move to utilize the
sun's energy.
A fabric woven from many threads
A type of solar cooker, both cheap and easy to make out
of local materials, has been designed by Mr. A.M.A.
Lateef. The soft clay found at the foot of the hills
around Quetta was moulded to form a paraboloid inside an
ordinary wooden packing case and pieces of polished tin were
fixed to the surface. The cooking material is kept at the
focal point of the paraboloid by either being suspended from
a stand or attached to a straight rod fixed at the centre of
the paraboloid. Certain modifications to suit the local
domestic use are being made and the cooker is being tested
this summer. Successful solar cookers are available for a
price. Our aim is to show the villagers that they can make
their own, just as they can make their own houses.
The size of a raindrop, an explosion of dynamite, the
measurement of water flow, and the sun's energy, do not
seem to have much in common. Yet a group of people at
Quetta, working under the same roof, are trying to weave
one fabric from these threads, trying to find the key to the
fascinating problem Nature has set mankind in the
apparently arid and energy deficient areas of the world.

SCIENCE WAY UP
IN THE CLOUDS
Experiments in the possibilities of rain-miking are
today going on in many parts of the world. Radar to
measure water content of clouds and aircraft for
"seeding" them are playing important roles in such
experiments. Above, nose of an American aircraft
used in rain-making research bristles with a multi¬
tude of scientific instruments for measuring atmos¬
pheric conditions. Right, radar antenna scans the
skies in Australia. Next page, cumulus clouds bet¬
ween 25,000 and 27,000 feet high were "seeded"
with dry ice in Australian experiments. Thirteen /
minutes after operation, cloud in centre billowed up
some 5,000 feet and rain began to fall from its base.
Much expensive effort has in recent years been put in
attempts to induce rainfall. The experiments have
received wide publicity because of the enormous value
that a successful method would have, not only in the arid
and semi-arid lands of the earth, but also elsewhere when
a temporary drought threatens agricultural production. It
has been estimated, for instance, that an increase of only
ten percent in the annual rainfall on the wheat-producing
areas of the western United States would increase the value
of the land itself by one half. Even in Norway the cost of
the one-month drought last July has been put at about
fifty million dollars.
In spite of the many experiments, some of them specta¬
cular, no completely successful method of rain-making has
yet been perfected. Droughts are still inevitable and the
arid lands are still arid. This means that it is impossible
today to use any method that is absolutely certain to give
results. On the other hand the experiments are in many
cases encouraging. The World Meteorological Organization
at Geneva, one of the Specialized Agencies of the United
Nations, has called the results '"inconclusive" but in a 1953
preliminary report recommended that "new scientifically
designed and rigorously checked experiments be undertaken
in all regions where there is a possibility of success".
Several limitations on the hopes for rain-making are well
established. In the first place, a cloud is needed and no
man can make a cloud. Indeed there are many types of
thin and hazy clouds which cannot possibly produce rain,
either naturally or artificially. Unfortunately such clouds
or a burning clear sky are characteristic of the deserts so
52
that where rain is most needed there is generally least hope
of creating it.
In the second place, experiments which have seemed suc¬
cessful have usually been done with the towering and bulging
"cumulus" clouds, that are characteristic of thunder-storms,
and with some other types of clouds that are natural pro¬
ducers of rain. Thus the chief effort has been to coax the
rain from such clouds over an area where rain is needed
and where the land-owners are willing to pay the cost,
instead of allowing the clouds to drift farther and shed
their rain elsewhere. Thunder clouds have also been
attacked in order to start the rainfall earlier than normal
and before storm conditions become violent enough to pro¬
duce either floods or hail.
These are some examples of what are at present considered
the most promising conditions for success in rain-making.
They have little relation to areas where rain seldom falls.
The report of the World Meteorological Organization, based
on a critical study of results in five areas of the earth, uses
these words: "The most favourable meteorological condi¬
tions for the artificial inducement of precipitation are to be
sought in regions and during seasons where natural preci¬
pitation is most likely."
The methods used for inducing rainfall are based on two
theories of the natural formation of rain. The first applies
in general to the temperate and high latitudes of the world.
Here the beginning of the natural rain-making process in
the cloud is the creation of minute ice crystals in the cold
upper part of the cloud extending above the freezing level.
In some circumstances there may be insufficient ice crystals

(CS I.R.O. photos )
present, and in such cases an artificial introduction of ice
crystals into the cloud may be a means of inducing rain¬
fall. Many experiments on the artificial inducement of rain
have therefore been aimed at producing ice crystals in select¬
ed clouds.
One well-known method has been to "seed" the clouds
with a very cold substance, commonly called dry ice, which
is in fact the solid or frozen form of carbon dioxide. The
particles of dry ice fall through the cloud and leave a wake
of very cold air behind them in which ice crystals form
spontaneously. Another method has been to introduce
minute crystals of silver iodide into the cloud. These
resemble ice crystals in shape and structure and under some
conditions have an effect similar to that of ice crystals.
Silver iodide may be released as a smoke from generators
on the ground or carried in airplanes.
The second theory of natural rainfall applies in general
though not exclusively to tropical regions where the upper
parts of the clouds do not reach freezing temperature. Here
the rain-making process is started when some of the
droplets in the cloud are so much larger than the bulk of
the cloud droplets that they move differently in the cloud
and so collide with the smaller ones. In this way they
become bigger until they are eventually large enough to fall
out as rain. Thus experiments have been conducted with
a view to introducing water droplets into the cloud that are
larger than the bulk of the cloud droplets. This has been
done by spraying into the clouds either water or very small
hygroscopic (water-absorbing) particles, such as salt
crystals, which at once form droplets of water.
Interesting results have been reported from Pakistan. In
the Northwest Frontier Province near the Khyber Pass,
between August 25 and 31 in 1953, jeeps from the Pakistan
Air Force sprayed salt solution over the roads leading from
the city of Mardan. The expectation was that wind would
carry the salt particles from the ground thousands of feet
into the air where they would cause drops to form in
moisture-bearing clouds. In this case scattered observers
reported that the areas around Mardan had a 2-inch
rainfall following this experiment.
In September of the same year, tests were also made in
Pakistan in which the salt solution was sprayed directly
into the clouds. Four of the Ave flights were unsuccessful,
but in the fifth the plane left a wake of showers falling
thirty or forty minutes after it had sprayed each cloud.
On the basis of these and similar experiments cloud-
seeding by air does not seem economically practical in an
area as large as West Pakistan but the use of salt on the
ground offers considerable promise. What Pakistan's
meteorologists hope to do is to tap some of the clouds that
blow over Western Pakistan during the monsoon season by
using the hygroscopic action of salt in such areas as
Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier Province where
there are very few hygroscopic nuclei naturally present in
the air.
In a new series of experiments in 1954 another and
inexpensive method for salting the sky was used in the
Punjab. The method made use of small hand
blowers like those used by silversmiths in the (Com don
Pakistani bazaars. These generators were set next page)

up at Lahore and Jauharabad and used salt that
had been ground to a fine powder in a local mill.
This powder was blown into the air from the ground at a
rate of about a pound a minute. Eight tons of salt were
thus wafted upwards in the course of 39 days and at a total
cost of about $1,000. Rain gauges scattered over an area of
1,500 square miles showed that this area received at least
fifty percent more rain than did the adjoining regions.
(For a detailed report on Unesco experiments in Pakistan,
see page 48.)
Radar measures growing rain drops
In the Union of South Africa clouds at a temperature
below freezing were seeded with dry ice and observation
of the cloud by means of radar showed some formation
of rain drops but there was no measurement of rain that
actually fell. The evidence was that seeding with dry ice did
at least stimulate precipitation at an earlier stage than would
otherwise have occurred. There were also experiments in
British East Africa during the rainy season from January
to April of 1952 in which silver iodide was carried into the
cloud by a balloon and was scattered in the cloud by means
of small gun-powder explosions. Rain gauges on the ground
showed a slight increase in rainfall. Similar experiments
were done with hygroscopic particles. In both cases the
evidence was that more rain fell at some distance downwind
from the point of release, but that there was a reduction in
the rainfall directly beneath the point where the chemical
was released into the cloud.
In India both dry ice and silver iodide were used for
seeding cold clouds and water drops were sprayed
into the clouds that were above the freezing point. These
experiments were made during the monsoon season when
rain occurs naturally so that the results were difficult to
evaluate.
In South America numerous experiments were made.
Over the Sierras of Cordoba and San Luis in the Argentine
dry ice was scattered within a cloud at a temperature of
10"F, but there was no proof that rain fell. Similarly,
experiments in Peru were done on cumulus clouds but it
was impossible to tell whether the rain that fell was natural
or artificial.
In Australian experiments under the direction of Dr. E.G.
Bowen of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization, the evidence was better. By seeding
a "suitable cloud", rainfall was certainly obtained, the
amount varying from 1 mm at the edge of the shower area
to approximately 13 mm (1/2-inch) at the centre.
Seeding clouds with silver iodide
In North America one well-known rain-making operation
has been carried out by Dr. Irving Langmuir in New
Mexico. He used a silver iodide ground-based generator
and carried out regular weekly seedings, using about 1,000
grammes of silver iodide per week over a long period. A
large number of other experiments have been made and one
careful study of the results indicates a significant increase
in rainfall of about 10% above normal. Thus the tendency
has become to seek relatively small increases in rainfall
rather than to produce rain where there is none.
The report of the World Meteorological Organization is
critical of nearly all past experiments, on the basis that
they lacked an adequate method of measuring accurately
the amount of rain produced and of distinguishing it from
natural rainfall. WMO therefore recommends that in
future experiments precise methods of measuring the
rainfall must be developed. Especially, every operation on
a cloud should be considered primarily as a scientific
experiment which will lead to an understanding of the
basic factors of rainfall and the mechanism by which rain
can be induced rather than as a practical operation to
produce rainfall then and there on the land below.
Such scientific experiments are now being planned or
begun in certain countries and there is hope that more
definite results on this very important subject will soon be
forthcoming.

### 69075: Invoking the rain gods
INVOKING THE RAIN GODS
The richest land in the world would be worth almost nothing and
people would starve if there were no rain or irrigation. Down
through the ages the necessity of rain and the fear of drought
have put rain gods and rain-making ceremonies prominently in
the religions and mythologies of most of the people of old. In
ancient Greece and Rome, Zeus or Jupiter wielding thunder and
lightning, was the god of rain and the earth's fertility. In many
parts of the world, snakes, serpents and dragons were closely
associated with rain and water generally. The Chinese dragon,
for example, represented water in all its forms and moods. It
was the life-giving rain and rivers without which the earth would
be barren, as well as the storm and the sea and the mysterious ebb
and flow of water. In India and elsewhere throughout East Asia,
the serpent-god Naga had an essentially similar role. The Greeks
considered the oak the tree of the gods and dipped an oak branch
in water to induce rain. The Romans cast ¡mages into the Tiber,
and the Teutons poured water over a naked girl. The Druids
went to sacred wells or springs in processions where they beat
upon the surface of the water or poured water over special stones.
The ancient Hebrews looked upon rain as a blessing bestowed by
God in return for their obedience to the Law. To the Aztecs,
in semi-arid Mexico, the rain god Tlaloc was one of the chief
divinities worshipped. Today, rain-making ceremonies and dances
still exist in different parts of the world. Primitive rain-makers
sprinkle water, use flashes of fire to indicate lightning, make smoke
clouds and use drums, clappers and rattles (probably to imitate
the sound of thunder or showering rain). Certain African tribes
have elaborate ceremonies lasting many days during which chick¬
ens, goats and other animals are sacrificed to invoke the gods.
Among the Pueblo Indians of the semi-desert southwest U.S.A.,
feathers are attached to prayer sticks and planted in shrines
at springs and irrigation ditches. The annual snake dance of the
Hopisand the Rain Dance of theZunis are both invocations for rain.

### 69077: The Myth about the tropics
THE MYTH
ABOUT
THE TROPICS
by Dr. W.S.S. Ladell
Copyright Unesco Courier
By all scientific indications man is a
tropical animal. Physiological
tests have hitherto failed to show
that the black man is any more suited
to life in the heat than the white, yet
the myth that the Tropics are no place
for a white man and that sojourn
there saps the mental and physical
energy of men from temperate climates
still remains. In defiance of that myth,
however, Queensland has been success¬
fully settled and there are many
prosperous parts in the southern States
of America which would be rated as
"tropical" from their climate were they
anywhere else.
The term "tropical" has come to have
a psychological rather than a geogra¬
phical or climatic meaning; do people
complain more of Tropical Fatigue in
Rio de Janeiro than they do in
Bahrein? They ought to, if such a
thing existed, as Rio is within the
Tropics and Bahrein outside.
Man must sweat
Human laziness is responsible for
tnis myth. Man, like other ani¬
mals, produces heat as he lives
and the harder he works the more heat
he produces. In warm climates the
body's problem is to get rid of this
metabolic heat. To do so, the superfi-
2ial tissueswarm up to the internal tem¬
perature of the body and blood flows
into the skin so that it becomes flushed
and hot. This hot skin radiates heat
to cooler surroundings and cooler air
moving over the skin takes up heat
from it.
The heat loss by these two routes
is adequate at first, but it becomes more
difficult as the temperature rises until
at 88°F., only if a man is naked and
inactive can he get rid of his metabolic
heat; if it gets warmer his temperature
rises and the third mechanism for heat
loss, the evaporation of sweat, becomes
important. The sweat glands begin to
produce sweat and as this evaporates
from the skin it takes up the heat that
could not be got rid of by convection
and radiation.
Dr. LADELL, British physiologist, has devoted many
years of research to the influence of tropical environ¬
ment on the human body. He is now director of the
Hot Climate Physiological Research Unit, Lagos, Nige¬
ria. He is also Senior Medical Research Officer of the
British Colonial Research Service.
Anything impeding heat loss by these
two routes will reduce the temperature
at which the sweating mechanism
comes into play; for example, a poor
flow of air over the skin, or, of course,
clothing. Similarly an increase in the
total amount of heat to be lost will
necessitate sweating sooner; this extra
heat may be from working muscles
twice as much heat is produced when
strolling at two m.p.h. as when sitting
quietly or it may be acquired exter¬
nally, as by standing in the sun when
the heat gained from solar radiation
may be more than that produced by
walking at 4 m.p.h.
However, by suitable clothing, by
keeping out of the sun and in the
breeze, and by not putting up heat
production by working, a man can
usually avoid sweating, but for a
productive life in the Tropics a man
must be willing to sweat; in vast areas
of the world there is poor nutrition
caused in part at least by man's
temperamental unwillingness to do so.
The same physiologically induced
laziness leads to economic difficulties
and to dirt and disease and a vicious
circle is set up. It is dirt, disease and
malnutrition that kills in the Tropics,
not the climate.
Modern Adam in Eden
Man's cooling system involves two
distinct physiological functions.
The first concerns the heart and
the flow of blood through the skin
bringing the metabolic heat to the
surface, and the other the production
of sweat, the evaporation of which
removes heat.
Tests show that a temperate climate
man reacts badly to work in heat when
he is first tried out; the opening up of
blood vessels in the skin drains blood
from other parts so that his heart
begins to race and he may vomit or
faint: sweating is slow in starting and
not profuse. But with training the
body compensates for the extra blood
vessels to be filled by increasing the
amount of blood, so that those dangers
pass; then he begins to sweat sooner
and more freely, and thus becomes
"acclimatized to heat". Tests on tro-

pical men, both in Asia and Africa,
have shown, surprisingly, that these
men react more like untrained tem¬
perate climate men than like "fully
acclimatized" individuals, and with
training they show the same changes.
This is because indigenous tropical
man rarely works hard in the heat; he
prefers to take life quietly, to move
slowly and take no exercise, and to
catnap frequently; he avoids sweating
and keeps his agricultural activities to
the minimum, living when possible as
Adam did in Eden. The immigrant to
the Tropics, however, who works hard
and plays hard becomes nearly com¬
pletely acclimatized, and thus we
have the paradox that he is better able
to work in the heat than the locally-
born.
But then all around him the immi¬
grant sees the indigenous man culti¬
vating inactivity, sleeping when he can
and avoiding hard physical work.
Surely, the immigrant asks himself, the
local inhabitant must know best; so he
too begins to work short hours, and to
take a long midday sleep from which
he arises confused rather than re¬
freshed to restart his broken day.
When a man sweats he loses water
which must be replaced. Physiologi¬
cally it is best to drink as one sweats,
but drinking when at work is often
frowned upon; so by evening men have
substantial water deficits. Pure water
is dull stuff, so the tendency is to make
good the deficiency with more in¬
teresting alcoholic drinks; compatriots
and friends gather together to exchange
news and gossip; nostalgia stimulates
more drinking; so insidiously an im¬
migrant community becomes mildly but
chronically alcoholic and thus develops
"Tropical Neurasthenia". Possibly the
best tropical settlers are the Moslems
who are forbidden by their religion to
touch alcohol. But prohibition is not
necessary, merely the recognition that
to drink water as one sweats is natural
and desirable, a sign not of weakness,
but of good sense.
WW6*Y
Improved living and working con¬
ditions, with or without air-condi¬
tioning, will help to reduce the heat
load, but the settler cannot avoid the
heat of the air. Sweat is only praise¬
worthy when it is the outcome of useful
effort; so tractors should be fitted with
canopies, and hats should be wide-
brimmed enough to shade the whole
body from the sun.
The way to productive life in the
Tropics is the same as anywhere else;
eschew sloth. A tropical community
must be prepared to work as hard as
it would do in a temperate climate and
not be frightened of the heat; by hard
work food production can be increased
and indigenous diseases eradicated.
Emulate the horse
Tropical men must be taught that
they are not like cattle, who
cannot sweat well and have to
rest for half the day to prevent being
overheated, even at the risk of starving
themselves: men are born with sweat
glands so that they may safely work in
the heat. The brunt of the day's work
must be done before taking a nap. Let
communities in these areas develop
into fully integrated societies, where
isolation and boredom are no longer
the lot of every man when his day's
work is done, and separation from wife
and family the rule rather than the
exception for the immigrant.
Recreation must be provided, so that
alcohol can revert to its correct role
from being a universal hobby to a
useful social lubricant. With a real
home life and the development of
cultural facilities the brain worker too
can play his part. But the key above
all is the willingness to sweat, and only
when much sweat has flowed will a
community be able to afford such
extravagant luxuries as improving its
local climate by air-conditioning.
Only horses sweat; gentlemen per¬
spire and ladies glow. There can never
be productive life in the Tropics until
humanity emulates the horse.

### 69079: A Desert steeped in fog; the paradox of coastal Peru
The coastal region of Peru a thirteen hundred mile-long
strip of territory enclosed between the Cordillera and
the sea is one of the most extraordinary arid zones of
the world. Quite recent upheavals have given it its present
form, and these upheavals are still going on. The average
number of earthquakes per year in Lima is about two hun¬
dred, but most of them are felt and recorded by the seismo¬
graphs alone. They merely demonstrate that the earth's
crust is still unstable in these regions, and has not yet
completed its evolution.
This narrow strip of land along the whole length of the
Peruvian coast is traversed by some forty water-courses',
which are the source of its wealth. These water-courses have
a common characteristic in most of the coastal area: cutting
through the mountains in deep valleys or canyons, they
spread out in the narrow coastal plain and supply water to
irrigated zones of varying extent.
Seen from the air, they form a long, narrow, well-defined
ribbon of water, sometimes edged with cultivated land, rising
Peru plans to tap rivers like the Ocona (above) which flow out of the Andes, so as to extend the cultivated lands which
today form oases in the dry, coastal belt. Centuries ago the Indians brought water here in hundreds of miles of canals.
up over each bank and spreading out into the plain. But the
river is not the only source of water. There is also subter¬
ranean water, known to the Indians long before the arrival of
the Spaniards.
Archaeologists have found the remains of a complex agri¬
cultural civilization which provided the soil for the growth
and blossoming of a great culture. The works of its artists,
on the one hand, and of its hydraulic engineers on the other,
show the full extent of the skill of the Indians.. Their en¬
gineers overcame immense difficulties to construct hundreds
of miles of canals, thus providing water for the arid land of
the coastal belt.

Assistance mission to Peru and author of many works on Latin-American and Ibe¬
rian geography, climatology and economics, as well as on the art, history, litera¬
ture, etc.. of these countries.

These canals took their water from fifty or more miles
up-stream, in the heart of the Cordillera of the Andes. Some
of them are still in use. Others have fallen into disuse and
their abandonment meant the abandonment of formerly
cultivated land.
But this civilization in Peru is not as dead as one might
think, for the people of the river oases of the Peruvian coast
have never ceased to cultivate their land just as their obscure
and distant ancestors laboured before them.
Today, these river oases constitute one of the country's
greatest sources of wealth. Though only three per cent of
the arid coastal belt is cultivated (about one and a quarter
million acres) the output is amazing. These tiny oases
produce goods (cotton, sugar, rice) which in 1953 represented
fifty-one per cent of Peru's total exports.
Cotton has earned the name of "'white gold" in Peru, and
each acre of wheat yields more than one and a half tons per
annum, in the province of Arequipa. But there are not
enough acres under
cultivation, and it is
imperative to exploit
the coastal belt to the
maximum by extending
its oases and making
use of semi-arid land
with the help of the
new techniques for the
utilization of arid and
semi-arid soils.
In the development
of the coastal belt the
subterranean water re¬
sources, once used by
the Indians, are of vi¬
tal importance. In
Southern Peru planta¬
tions have sprung up
like mushrooms in the
last three years and
where all was sand and
desert, the waters of
the subsoil have en¬
abled many acres of
land to be planted with
cotton. At Los Castil¬
los, near lea, four hun¬
dred wells have been
sunk in the last ten
years. Further studies
of these underground
water supplies are need¬
ed so that their possi¬
bilities can be fully ex¬
ploited. An engineer '
from the Peruvian Mi¬
nistry of Agriculture
recently returned from
India and California
where, with a Unesco
grant, he made a study
of methods of location
and utilization of subterranean water supplies.
How can water exist beneath the apparently arid surface
of Peru's coastal strip ? Some is produced by the infiltration
of rivers that come down from the Andes, and some by the
heavy fogs, typical of a part of this coast, which condense
and seep into the soil.
The Peruvian coast, although so uniform in appearance,
has very varied weather conditions. In the North, the ex¬
treme dryness of the atmosphere contrasts with the humi¬
dity of the sub-soil, and causes vast areas to be covered with
steppe-land vegetation. Further to the South, particularly
in the central coastal region around Lima, clouds hide the
sun for several months of the year, and create the paradox
of an arid land, with little rain, where the atmosphere is
perpetually saturated with moisture. Still further South, the
picture again changes completely. Here the sun
reigns supreme and the dryness of the atmosphere (Cont'd on
reaches a maximum. The "white city" of Arequipa, next page)

In each of these three different regions men are struggling
with widely contrasting conditions. Solutions to the
problems of the jNbrth are likely to be simpler. The diversion
of water from the rivers near the frontier of Ecuador offers
great possibilities. The Quiroz was recently diverted to
supply the river oasis of Piura, which had always been short
of water. In the first year increased cotton production had
covered the cost of the construction of the canal, a result
which must be unique in the worlcV Further South, the
Chancay, the Santa and other rivers also present tremendous
possibilities. A few years ago, more than twelve thousand
feet up in the Cordil¬
lera, the waters of 	
several lagoons which
formerly fed the Ama¬
zon basin, were diverted
to the Rio San Juan.
The same thing is now
to be done for the lea,
a tremendous under-
taking which will
enable the oasis to be
extended and pro¬
duction to be increased.
But this work is not
yet being carried out
on a scale calculated
to meet the increased
needs of the country,
and so vast schemes
are being worked out.
The people of Are¬
quipa, for example, are
tackling the problems
presented by Nature
with daring, courage
and energy, and their
problems are much
greater than those of
the North or even of
the centre. Arequipa
is seriously over¬
crowded and feels the
constant pressure of an
increasing population,
while people from the
overpopulated Andes
plateau (the Puno re¬
gion and the Peruvian
shores of Lake Titi¬
caca) continue to pour
in.
Recently I flew over
the pampas of La Joya,
Sihuas and Majes,
which are the hope of
the "'white city" of
Arequipa, and which
cover many hundreds
of thousands of acres
to the north of it. Today these vast pampas are deserts but
they can be placed under cultivation as soon as water can be
brought to them from the Sihuas and Majes rivers. Beyond
them is the immense Majes Canyon, deeper than the Colo¬
rado Canyon, at certain places reaching a depth of nearly
two miles. Here, at the bottom of this wild uninhabited
gorge, flows South Peru's largest water-course. And it is
here that Peru must capture the water that one day will
supply the people of Arequipa, by means of a hundred miles
or so of channels cut through one of the most rugged regions
in the world.
The aridity of these areas of Peru is largely caused by the
Humboldt current, a cold current which flows northward up
the coast, and also by the cold sea water which rises to the
surface from a great depth along the coast of Peru. Their
40 MILLION SEA BIRDS
1
Forty million sea birds swarm on the shore of tiny islands fringing the
coast of Peru. Their droppings (guano), richest nitrogenous fertilizer known,
once covered islands to depth of 40 to 150 feet. Stripped away in I 9 th
century, government today protects guano, still one of Peru's richest sources
of wealth and vital to prosperity of its coastal farmers.
-V 'AM
effect is to make the climate of this sub-tropical region
colder than it would otherwise be and to cause aridity. It
is not a desert, however, for most of the soil along the coast
would yield excellent returns if its thirst were quenched with
a little water. Much can be done to transform a considerable
part of this arid zone into a productive region.
The exceptionally cold coastal waters are also the reason
for the amazing wealth of sea-life in the Pacific off the coast
of Peru. Few seas are as rich as these and the best
evidence of their abundant fish is the vast number of guano
birds living on the islets strung out along the coast. It is the
incredible though not inexhaustible richness of these
waters, that satisfies the voracious appetite of the thirty or
forty million birds
(their number varies
from year to year)
which swarm on these
islands and produce
the valuable fertilizer
known as guano.
These tiny islands
are the most densely
populated in the
world in terms of
guano birds, guanayes,
Diqueros, ana alcatraces
or pelicans. Sometimes
their swarming num¬
bers may reach eighty
thousand to the acre.
Thus, thanks to the
wealth of the ocean,
almost three hundred
thousand tons of guano
have been obtained
from these islands
each year by the Com¬
pañía Administradora
de Guano. Today, as at
the time of the ancient
Indian civilizations,
guano is one of the
basic elements of agri¬
cultural prosperity in
the coastal region of
Peru, and is indispen¬
sable for the survival
of the oases in this
areas.
The productive
output of the coastal
belt is today only a
fraction of what it
might be if modern
techniques for -the
utilization of arid areas
were employed. Today
we are entering upon
an era of geographical
planning, and many
river basin develop¬
ment projects, creating
power for industry and
supplying water for agriculture, have shown that whole areas
can be completely transformed in this way. There are pro¬
bably few places in which geographical planning could hope
for better results than in the arid regions of Peru.
There are many problems to be solved, and much research
is needed. Geographical, climatic and hydrological surveys
will have to be undertaken and a thorough study made of the
different soils and their characteristics, of the subterranean
water resources and of wind as a source of power before
plans can be drawn up.
As a first step to carrying out such projects, Unesco has
agreed to help the Peruvian Government to set up an Arid
Zone Research Institute, thus providing the means of co¬
ordinating all branches of arid zone research in this part
of the world.

### 69047: The Camel: facts and fables
THE CAMEL
(Continued from page 32)
However, there are many wild animals in the desert that
seem to live so far from any free water that one must assume
that they never drink. The desert gazelles, for example, are
found far from water holes, and they must subsist on the
water obtained from the sparse vegetation upon which they
browse. The carnivorous animals, such as the desert fox,
obtain a considerable amount of water with the blood and
tissue fluids of their prey. Some small rodents eat juicy
plant material and cacti, but other very interesting animals
eat only dry food.
Among those living on dry food are the jerboas of the Old
World deserts, and the kangaroo rats of the American
deserts. These rodents are rather similar in appearance and
habits, although they are not closely related. They can be
trapped easily and when they are kept in captivity it is
unnecessary to give them drinking water. In fact they will
not drink even if water is offered to them. They can live
for months and months eating only dry plant material and
dry seeds such as they do in their native deserts. They do
not lose weight nor does the water content of their body
decrease; in other words, they have no storage of water to
tide them over long periods of water deprivation.
These animals contain as much water as other mammals ;
about 2/3 of their body is water. They lose water vapour
from the lungs when they breathe, and their kidneys use
water to produce urine. There is constant water loss from
the body ; where does the water come from ?
In experiments with these animals we found that the
jerboas as well as the kangaroo rats depend almost entirely
on the water that is formed in their bodies by the oxidation
of their food. Such oxidation water is formed in the meta¬
bolism of all animals, and there is no secret mechanism for
chemical manufacture of water ; the amount of water
depends only on the composition of the food.
Life without drinking
As in the automobile engine, where water is formed dur¬
ing combustion, neither more nor less appears than
corresponds to the amount of hydrogen chemically
bound in the fuel. The ability of the desert rats to get along
on this very limited water supply is due to their water saving
mechanisms. They lose only half as much water by evapo¬
ration as an ordinary rat. They form very little, but highly
concentrated, urine, and they lose a minimum amount of
water with the faeces.
It is possible to induce kangaroo rats to drink if they are
given food that causes the formation of relatively large
quantities of waste products without yielding sufficient
water for their elimination. This is the case with any dry
food containing a high proportion of protein, which in meta¬
bolism yields quantities of urea that must be excreted by
the kidney.
We gave some kangaroo rats dry soy beans which contain
40 % of protein, and they would then drink water when it
was offered to them. This led us to try to determine whe¬
ther the kangaroo rats could drink sea water. Other animals
cannot tolerate drinking sea water because the organism
cannot handle the large extra amount of salt. Indeed, if
a man who is stranded without fresh water tries to drink
sea water, he is worse off than if he does not drink at all.
We offered kangaroo rats sea water to drink with the soy
beans and it turned out that they not only maintained their
weight but even gained on this rather severe diet. Of
course, in his natural desert habitat the kangaroo rat does
not have much use for drinking sea water, but it shows that
he can get along on sea water as well as without any water.
In most countries where the cow is of importance in agri¬
cultural production there are research centres and experi¬
mental stations and farms that deal with problems of scien¬
tific and economic importance. This is not so with the
camel, although to millions of people over vast areas this
animal is of major importance as a beast of burden as well
as for production of meat, milk, leather, and wool.
We have often been asked about the practical value of our
research on desert animals. Although our primary objective
is to increase the amount of basic scientific knowledge in a
fascinating field, it is easy to understand that such know¬
ledge is essential to the evaluation of the practical problems
that arise in connexion with, for example, the agricultural
nlanning and management of arid land.

Letters to the Editor
Sir,
I am a constant reader of the
Unesco Courier. I was a bit
annoyed when you went over to the
smaller size, but the tremendous
increase in the quality and interest
of the articles has more than made
up for my disappointment in the
format change. I would not like to
see it changed back now. Your
Pacific Islands issue was particularly
notable. How I wish I had had such

Sir,
Sincere congratulations on your
excellent puppetry issue. I cannot
tell you how many people both in
the field and in other lines of
endeavours have brought it to my
attention. All were delighted with
the serious and searching approach
used in the compilation of this issue.
The wealth of pictorial material was
much appreciated.
There is one area, however, which
I was sorry to see neglected. That
is, the field of puppetry in the
United States and Canada where a
great deal of vigorous, original
work is being produced. May I
suggest that at some time in the
future you devcte an issue of the
Unesco Courier to North American
puppetry? Not only would this
serve to define the current status of
the art here, but it would also give
a great deal of encouragement to
our puppeteers who feel at times, I
think, that they are crying in the
wilderness. In addition, such a
publication would be of the most
positive interest and importance to
puppet enthusiasts in other parts of
the world.
Without seeming to cavil, I should
like to point out that some of the
facts concerning American puppetry
published in the June (N° 3/4 Eu¬
ropean) Courier are obsolete. There
are at least two permanent public
puppet theaters in the United
States: The Detroit Puppet Theater
which we co-sponsor with the
Detroit News, and the Turnabout
Theater in Los Angeles operated by
the Yale Puppeteers. In addition,
while it is true that the names
of Tony Sarg. Rufus Rose and
Remo Búfano are world famous,
none of these men is now active in
the field strictly speaking. Tony
Sarg died in 1942, Remo Búfano in
1948; Rufus Rose now limits his
activity to the puppet episodes on
the "Howdy Doody" telecast. Such
names as Basil Milovsoroff, Romain
and Ellen Proctor, George Merten,
Martin and Olga Stevens, Cedric and
Lee Head, George Latshaw, Spence
and Alan Gilmore, Bill and Cora
Baird and many more should have
been mentioned in addition.
I hope that one day your fine
publication will focus its attention
on the outstanding work in puppetry
now being done in this country and
in Canada.

Sir,
I've read with much interest and
a little dismay your issue on
puppets. The dismay was occasioned
by your statement that "there are
no permanent public puppet theatres
in U.S.A." The Yale Puppeteers,
comprising Harry Burnett, Richard
Brandon and myself, was organized
in 1927 and puppeteering has been
our life work. We established the
Olvera Street Theatre in Los An¬
geles in 1929, where we played for
two solid years. In 1933, at The
Puppet Show in New York we played
for six months. On July 10, 1941,
we established the present theatre,
and we are now starting our
fifteenth year of continuous per¬
formances. Tonight, I see by my
calendar, is the 4163rd. We have
produced, in this time, eight com¬
plete hour-long musicals with casts
of from twenty to sixty puppets, and
since the shows are beamed strictly
to an adult audience, we're rather
proud of our record. We have
played to nearly a half-million
people, in a theatre seating 172.

### 69050: Triangles and circles with magic meaning; Saharan art
SAHARAN ART
centre was nearby. It was inlaid with
copper, as "protection against wounds",
as well as silver for "the Lord's
benediction."
The hilt was studded with typical
copper projections to guard against
the evil influence of iron, and chiselled
with Tuareg designs like the "'devil's
eyebrows" found on pins and clasps.
But it had two additional floral
patterns of Arab origin. The subtlety
of workmanship pointed to a Moorish
origin. Finally, a small cross inscribed
in a circle and isolated from the other
decorations protected the weapon and
its owner from the evil eye.
' I love Touantine '
Now a curious weapon of this kind
(curious because of the bayonet
form) deserved a signature. And
it had one. It was engraved by the
blacksmith who made it a man named
Habaia ag Mohammed, who belonged
to a Moorish group which had migrated
to the Tuareg country 70 years before
and which was now in the process of
assimilation. But since he was proud
of his origin, the blacksmith engraved
his name on the dagger and in Moorish
fashion tacked on a whole string of his
ancestors.
When a Tuareg tribesman later
bought the dagger he too decided to
immortalize it with a name. And here
we find one of the great differences
between the Moors and the Tuaregs.
When an escort of Moorish goumiers
accompanies you on the road, their
conversation turns to their ancestors,
to God and their salaries; the Tuareg
composes poems for the girl he loves.
"My beauty with the blue-painted
temples, my beauty with the white
teeth... I have only the night to
accompany the torment of being
without you." And he is quite ready
to make a hundred and fifty mile
detour to serenade her with his poem
and the strains of a violin.
It was in this spirit of gallantry, and
of the camel race, of the mad dash in
the saddle of a fleet-footed thorough¬
bred mehari, just to win a perfumed
scarf, that Babou ag Gaba dedicated
his new-bought dagger to a woman.
His inscription read simply: "I love
Touantine".
A knowledge of the Saharan lan¬
guages, Tifinagh and Hassanya, has
revealed what otherwise might have
remained unsuspected. In addition to
their purely traditional role in decora¬
tion, the geometrical pattern wrought
on leather, wood and metal sometimes
contains intimate personal messages
by the artists. Here, for instance, is a
short poem by a shoemaker from
Mederdra in Mauritania. In the centre
of the decoration of his rice bag the
shoemaker had, in an explosion of
pride, inscribed the following lines:
All men of evil heart will covet you.

Those I shall not even answer.
For good men would not dare to ask
[for you.
In another instance, when all the
ornaments such as "devil's eyebrows",
stars, lizards and suns had been
removed from a finely stitched bag
made in Tamesnar, in the Tuareg
country, the entire bag was found to
.be a message of love. It read:
May the stars accompany you and
[guide your steps.
May the wisdom of the sages be with
[you.
May the Peoples of the Empty Spaces
[retreat from your path.
On a fringe was written this short
note of anxious love:
She named Takouani senas many
[greetings to Mertar.
Only the good Lord knows how to look
[into the eyes of Mertar.
Other artists sign a "tassoufra" or
cushion as a painter signs his canvas:
"'This is by me, Amadi."
How misleading an obsession with
geometrical surfaces and the austerity
of their lines can be I realized fully
when a young girl, Fathimaton,
explained to me: "These are flowers;
I saw them on the major's curtains...
Here is Limguenfé, the servant girl.
You can see, she is on her knees,
spinning wool!"
I had been unaware of all the signs
in this language of Saharan nomadic
art. I had translated them poorly and
said, "'those are triangles, those are
circles and the others there are more
curves." But those triangles just
barely recognizable because they were
smaller than the others were the
flowers on department store cretonnes.
And those curves and the twin volu¬
minous spirals were Limguenfé. The
servant girl knew it and recognized
herself. Ignoring all the other designs,
she touched "her portrait" cautiously
and announced with pride "That's
me".
Scorpions, vipers and stars
If one the criteria of art is the
expression of human drama in its
many forms, then the people of the
Sahara desert would certainly seem to
offer us an authentic art. Malraux
answered the question "'What is art?"
with this prudent formula: "That by
which form becomes style."
To this definition I might perhaps
add those fears and joys which Saharan
craftsmen discreetly express with their
scorpions and vipers, their stars and
suns, with their faithhowever naive
in their own art and which they ack¬
nowledge in their written messages and
through their signatures. We shall
then find a close contact I was
going to write between the artists of
their world and our own, but shall
simply say between men.
Mat makers of Mauritania use alfa and other grasses often strengthened by thin strips
of leather which are painted after the plaiting is complete. In this detail the curved channels
represent flowing water. (All photos on this page copyright Jean Gabus)
To decorate a calabash, craftsmen use a sharp
knife and a piercing tool to thread thin strips
of tamarisk tree bark (coiled in bowl).
Palanquins, placed on camels to transport
women and children, are decorated at Hoggar
with silver and copper inlays.
Each of the motifs woven into this Mozabite rug has a specific symbolic meaning.
Reading from left to right and from bottom to top: a small table, candles in sticks,
combs, a scorpion, a finger (called the finger of Tunis) and a key.

From the Unesco Newsroom
o_ THER MEN'S WAYS :
The story of Unesco's Exchange
of Persons Service, an operation
that grew out of the tremendous
rise of educational exchanges
and study abroad in the past
three decades, has now been
told in "Other Men's Ways", the
latest pamphlet in the "Unesco
and its Programme" series.
The pamphlet presents a pic¬
ture of what Unesco has been
able to do since 1947 to establish
personal contacts between peo¬
ple from different lands. Some
of the things Unesco has done
to smooth the path of educa¬
tional travel, such as collecting
and making available inform¬
ation on fellowships, vacation
study opportunities, teaching
posts open abroad and travel
reductions and facilities, are
described. Unesco itself has
offered nearly 1,000 fellowships
over the past eight years, and
its exchange of workers scheme
has already helped three thou¬
sand European workers to
undertake study tours abroad.
Today an estimated 100,000 stu¬
dents are studying in foreign
countries.
GOING UP: The world's
population tot ailed
2,528,000,000 in the second
half of 1954, compared with
2,493,000,000 in 1953, accord¬
ing to an analysis made by
the United Nations Statis¬
tical Office. Totals for dif¬
ferent world areas were as
follows: Africa: 216,000.000;
North America: 233,000,000;
South America: 121,100,000;
Asia (excluding U.S.S.R.) :
1,323,000,000; Europe (exclud¬
ing U.S.S.R.): 406 500.000;
Oceania: 14,200,000; U.S.S.R.:
214,500,000.
Il EOPLE ON MISSIONS:
Canadian film maker, Graham
Crabtree, is now in Indonesia to
help the authorities there set
up an audio-visual production
unit at the Bandoeng teacher
training centre. Mr. Crabtree
who is working on a Unesco
technical assistance mission, did
a similar mission in Thailand
in 1953. Among the many other
specialists now carrying Unesco
technical missions in various
parts of the work, three have
just joined the Unesco team
working in Liberia. One is Dr.
Juntaro Kawai, a Japanese
chemist, who will join the fa
culty of the University of Libe¬
ria in Monrovia, capital of the
West African republic. A se¬
cond is a British physicist, Dr.
J. Aharoni, and the third is
Mr. Erling Rossing, Danish
educator. They, too, will join

Liberia expand facilities for
science teaching. At the same

* CULTURAL 'RED
CROSS': Egypt is the first
country to ratify the "Blue
and White Shield" agree¬
ment, an international Con¬
vention for the Protection of
Cultural Property in the
Event of Armed Conflict.
The agreement will come
into force after it has been
same sort of protection in
time of war that is now uni¬
versally given to hospitals,
ambulances and medical per¬
sonnel. Countries who sign
also pledge themselves to
take a number of unprece¬
dented peace-time measures.
The banner symbolizing this
international agreement is a
blue flag with a white shield.
It is significant that Egypt,
a country rich in culture and
artistic treasures, should
have become the first to
ratify this convention, which
marks an important step
forward in international law.
MJ OW-COST LABS: Sets
of one hundred and fifty-six
drawings to enable schools in
tropical countries to build low-
cost science teaching labora¬
tories have just been issued by
Unesco. With these drawings
a laboratory can now be pro¬
duced at about a third its
market price. The drawings
cover equipment needed in pri¬
mary and secondary science
teaching, and in the training of
science teachers. They will par¬
ticularly aid countries which
are short of science teaching
equipment and lack foreign
exchange to import apparatus,
yet which have craftsmen and
vocational schools where the
equipment might be manufac¬
tured locally at low cost.
PRISONERS' RIGHTS:
The first U. N. World Con¬
gress on the Prevention of
Crime and the Treatment of
Offenders was held recently
in Geneva, Switzerland. The
400 delegates, who included
social scientists, criminolo¬
gists, research workers, pri¬
son wardens, juvenile court
judges and social workers,
discussed, among other sub¬
jects, a basic set of interna¬
tional rules for the treatment
of prisoners, as well as ways
of preventing juvenile delin¬
quency.
w HERE COLOUR
COUNTS : Coloured filmstrips
used for educational work more
than justify their increased
cost over black and white ones
because of their added power of
persuasion according to experi¬
ments carried out at the Latin
American Regional Fundamen¬
tal Education Centre, Patzcuaro,
Mexico. Over 200 copies of film-
strips covering every aspect of
community improvement from
animal vaccination to rural ar¬
chitecture have been sent out by
the centre to five countries
Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico and Mexico. Stu¬
dents at the Centre which is
operated jointly by Unesco, the
Organization of American States
and the Mexican Government,
used filmstrips in some twenty
Tarascan Indian villages where
they taught and also learned
some techniques to apply in
their own countries.

A NOTE TO OUR READERS
It is now almost two years since the Unesco
Courier abandoned its tabloid newspaper size
and adopted the present magazine format.
Since then no effort has been spared by the
Editors to improve the appearance and the
contents of each succeeding issue. New features
and columns have been added, the number of
pages has been increased, and a high quality
whiter paper is now being used both for the
cover in colour and the inside pages. The
response of our readers throughout the world
to these and other improvements has been most
gratifying.
Though the Unesco Courier is a non-profit
publication the present annual subscription
rate of 300 fr. francs, or 6/- no longer even
covers printing and postage costs. It has there¬
fore become necessary to announce an increase
in price. Nevertheless, to permit the Unesco
Courier to continue to reach the widest pos¬
sible number of readers, this increase has been
kept to an absolute minimum.
As of January I, 1956 the new subscription
rate will be 400 French francs, 8/- or S2.00
per year. The per copy rate will be 40 francs,
9d., 20 cents. New subscriptions and renewals
will be accepted at the current rates if post¬
marked not later than December 3 1, 1955.

THE UNITED NATIONS
-A FRANK APPRAISAL
The Atomic Age and the U.N. were born together in 1945.
WHERE DID WE GO FROM THERE?
For many peopleand especially for the younger generationunder¬
standing these events is like walking into a cinema after the film has
been running for an hour. It is not always clear who is going where,
and why.
A father puts the past ten years ¡n perspective for his teen-age
daughter.
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
The chances of peace, and of economic progress and social betterment.
A scientist takes a realistic look at the International Atom.
