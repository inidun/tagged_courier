Literacy is an inalienable human right, says Nadine Gordimer, 
1991 Nobel Prize for Literature. But, according to the South 
African novelist, being able to read a billboard doesn‚Äôt mean 
one is literate. 3

disastrous economic effect is seen 
from the humble levels ‚Äì at an au-
tomobile assembly plant in South 
Africa, research found that many 
workers on the line could follow 
only spoken orders, unable to read 
any written notification. At the level 
of higher education for the profes-
sions, universities are faced with 
the problem of students ostensibly 
qualified for entry who do not have 
the vocabulary or skilled use of the 
written word necessarily assumed 
for university courses. The shortage 
of suitably competent candidates 
for positions essential in develop-
ment of governance, social services, 
industry and commerce, is thus evi-
dent. President Mbeki recently said 
that, in order to serve the needs of

n the beginning was the Word. The 
Word that was Creation. Its transfor-
mation into the written word came 
to us when it was first scratched as 
a hieroglyph or ideogram on a stone 
or traced on papyrus, and when it 
travelled from parchment to print in 
Gutenberg. That was the next gen-
esis: of literacy. It was and is the mi-
raculous ability that humans alone 
possess within the miracle of cre-
ation (we have devised the means 
to take to the air). 
Our new millennium, stated as 
dedicated to defining and uphold-
ing human rights, surely should list 
literacy as an inalienable one? 
Yet UNESCO reports that over 
700 million adults in our era can-
not read or write and more than 
72 million children do not go to 
school, deprived of their rightful 
heritage, literacy. In South Africa, 
where I write these words, illiteracy 
is almost 50% in certain rural areas. 
What are the reasons, world-wide 
or nearer wherever one‚Äôs home may 
be? Poverty and lack of educational 
facilities are the obvious ones in

fill such positions, particularly in in-
dustry. An upgraded version of the 
adage, ‚Äúeach-one-teach-one‚Äù.
But we come back to the abso-
lute. It shouldn‚Äôt need to be stated, 
but has to be, it seems. Literacy is 
the basis of all learning. Even if one 
goes on to the differently profound 
numero-ideogrammatic knowledg-
es of science. 
And, on the way back to the 
source that is the written word, 
we arrive at a presently prevalent 
intermediate condition of literacy: 
semi-literacy. This is no doubt ex-
acerbated in multilingual countries 
where, as a result of long coloniza-
tion, a foreign language became 
and remains a lingua franca, the Philae temples on the Island of Agilkia.

second language, not the mother 
tongue, the natal Word, of the in-
habitant. One would accept that 
you are unlikely to be able to read 
and write the lingua franca as confi-
dently, precisely, as, once master of 
the alphabet, you surely could read 
and write your own. But a distin-
guished writer and academic, Pro-
fessor Es‚Äôkia Mphahlele, tells me 
that black South Africans emerge 
from their schooling semi-literate 
in the reading and writing of their 
own mother tongues, just as white 
South Africans and those of other 
ethno-linguistic backgrounds are 
semi-literate in theirs. To be able to 
read the legend on a billboard and 
the bubble-enclosed dialogue of 
Spacemen in a comic book, while 
unable to understand the vocabu-
lary of a poem or follow in prose 
literature the meaningful variations 
of syntax, the use of words in ways 
that open up new depths of self-
comprehension ‚Äì that is not literacy. 
It is not what every individual should 
have by human right. 
The developing countries, although 
with more reasons for producing 
only the halfway to literacy, are not 
alone in this cultural state. Colleges 
in the USA report the same result of 
their educational system, reflection 
of current cultural values of their 
society. In Britain there is the same 
dismay at young men and women, 
born and educated in the country 
NadiNe Gordimer: The imaGe aNd The Word
of the birth of the English language, 
who cannot read or write using the 
great resources of their mother 
tongue. 
So, while poverty and lack of edu-
cational opportunity are responsible 
for the great void in our world that is 
illiteracy, this tragic situation is not 
the prime cause, let alone the justifi-
cation for the widespread phenom-
enon of semi-literacy.
The fact is that we are conjoined, all 
countries long developed or strug-
gling to develop across the abyss 
between rich nations and poor, un-
der threat of the Image against the 
Written Word. From the first third 
of the 20th Century the image has 
been challenging the power of the 
written word as the stimulation of 
the imagination, the opening of hu-
man receptivity. The bedtime story 
of middle class childhood has been 
replaced by the hour in front of the 
TV screen; in shack settlements all 
over the poor countries of the globe 
the TV aerial signifies the battery-
run screen where no book is to be 
found. School and community librar-
ies don‚Äôt exist in villages and towns 
where video cassettes are for hire. 
Yes, TV images are accompanied 
by the spoken word, sometimes 
by text, but it is the picture that de-
cides how secondary the Word‚Äôs 
role shall be. 
The American writer, William Gass, 
defines best the Written Word, in its 
home, the book: ‚ÄòWe shall not un-
derstand what a book is, and why 
a book has the value many persons 
have‚Ä¶ If we forget how important 
to it is its body, the building that 
has been built to hold its lines of 
language safely together‚Ä¶ Words 
on a screen have virtual qualities, 
to be sure‚Ä¶but they have no ma-
teriality, they are only shadows, and 
when the light shifts they‚Äôll be gone. 
Off the screen they do not exist as 
words. They do not wait to be re-
seen, reread; they only wait to be 
remade, relit.‚Äô 
Yes, the Image of text, of the Word, 
disappears off the screen; to recall 
it, along with the other visuals, you 
have to have an apparatus, a cell, a 
battery, access to an electric power 
connection. The book needs none 
of these. Simply held in the hand 
it can be read, turned to again and 
again, on a bus, in the subway, in 
the bath, on a mountain top, in a 
queue. 
This is no fuddy-duddy turning 
away from progress. The vast ad-
vances in communications tech-
nology are an information revolu-
tion that has great possibilities for 
social development if well used, 
which means made economically 
available to the millions in the world 
whose lives will otherwise be bull-
dozed by the financial oligarchy of 
globalization. 
But information does not, it cannot, 
ever replace, outmoded illumina-
tion ‚Äì searching knowledge of the 
human intellect and spirit that, all 
readers know, comes in communi-
cation with the Word in its infinitely 
portable, available home between 
hard or paperback covers. 
First it became the book of the movie. 
Now it is the book of the website. 
Don‚Äôt let it happen.

South African novelist, 
Nobel Prize for Literature 1991

for Literacy, UNESCO)

### The Long-lasting memory of storybooks

   The Tanzanian Children‚Äôs book Project has just been awarded 
        the uNeSCo king Sejong literacy Prize for its work promoting
              the love of books among children and adults. This work has proved very positive

stand than English.‚Äù
Social change
The Children‚Äôs Book Project, a non-
governmental organization, was 
launched in 1991 by CODE, a 
Canadian charitable organization, 
as a measure to alleviate the acute 
shortage of books in Tanzania, par-
ticularly children‚Äôs books. ‚ÄúBefore 
CBP, there was a serious lack of 
reading books in schools in the 
country, because the government 
monopolized publishing houses 
[‚Ä¶] There was a need for interven-
tion; CBP intervened,‚Äù Ms Dumea 
says. The NGO‚Äôs aim was to de-
velop a strong reading culture, sus-
tained by effective reading skills 
and the provision of quality reading 
materials. 
CBP collaborates with publish-
ers to produce its own selection of 
children‚Äôs books in Kiswahili. It then 
purchases 3000 of the 5000 cop-
ies of each title for free distribution. 
‚ÄúOur objective is to develop and 
promote excellent quality and cul-
turally suitable books in Kiswahili 
and make these materials accessi-
ble,‚Äù CBP‚Äôs Marcus Mbigili says. To 
date, 237 titles have been distribut-
ed to 3642 schools in the country, 
and the demand for CBP-trained 
writers has increased in Tanzania, 
Kenya and Uganda. So far, 356 
writers, 191 of them women, have 
been trained in CBP workshops. 
‚ÄúIn general, women are sensitive 
writers; some of them draw on 
their own experiences. They advo-
cate social change in their writing. 
For example, women from Zanzibar 
aasai women were inspired by 
a visit to Children‚Äôs Book Project 
(CBP) libraries in the Morogoro 
area to build a temporary classroom 
for their children, hire a teacher and 
ask the District Education Officer 
(DEO) for books. The DEO turned 
to the CBP, which sent the newly 
established school reading mate-
rials and included it in its reading 
programme. 
‚ÄúThe Maasai women‚Äôs reason for 
starting the school was to empower 
their children for them to gain ac-
cess to information, a stronger 
voice in the household and help 
their mothers in managing finances,‚Äù 
the Project‚Äôs Secretary, Pili Dumea 
explains. 
And they were right: schools join-
ing CBP improve. Mwajuma Tyeah, 
headmistress of Mwendapole pri-
mary school (Kibaha district, Coast 
Region), a school with 876 pupils 
and only seven classes, confirms 
this: ‚ÄúSince we became part of the 
programme in 1998, the school has 
significantly improved. Performance 
is better and the pupils and teach-
ers are more skilled. For the last 
three years, all our pupils who sat 
for the standard national examina-
tion passed to the next level, com-
pared to about five years ago, when 
only 24% to 25% passed. We are 
also among the top three schools in 
the district.‚Äù 
Sofia Beda, an 11-year-old pupil 
at the school, agrees: ‚ÄúPupils from 
neighbouring schools come here 
and that is a good sign, it means we 
are better! I have read most of the 
books in the school library, which 
helped me learn about different 
topics through interesting stories 
told in our own national language,

prefer writing on gender inequality,‚Äù 
Ms Dumea comments. 
CBP also organizes training work-
shops for illustrators, publishers 
and printers. As the demands in 
health, environment, educational 
and human rights practices evolve, 
the programme teaches new cre-
ative strategies and techniques in 
presenting relevant information and 
encourages indigenous creation. 
In 1997, the NGO initiated a read-
ership programme. The programme 
develops primary school teachers‚Äô 
skills in teaching reading and writing 
based on progressive child-centred 
methodologies. ‚ÄúWe have competi-
tions, reading tents and book do-
nations, all as a part of motivating 
children and adults to read books,‚Äù 
Ms Dumea explains.
The remotest areas
Today, the Children‚Äôs Book Project 
has established 96 school libraries 
among 99 programme schools. Al-
though these libraries were meant 
for students and teachers, commu-
nity members increasingly visit them: 
‚ÄúData from 11 districts showed that 
more than 9000 borrowers in the 
programme school libraries were 
adults. And last year, we awarded 
Zena Muuigi, a woman from Bingwi 
village in the Coast region, for hav-
ing read 100 titles in a year,‚Äù CBP 
Assistant Monitoring Coordinator, 
Mary Kihampa, says. 
The Project is bringing about social 
change and adults are now benefit-
ing from this project that was start-
ed to benefit their children. ‚ÄúIn rural 
areas, school libraries are centres 
for recreation and education, where 
village meetings and discussions 
on various issues are conducted. 
Therefore, adults get the opportuni-
ty to see the books and read them, 
discuss and apply the skills in their 
daily life,‚Äù Ms Dumea says, and, she 
adds, ‚ÄúThey inspire their friends to 
attend literacy classes. Frequent 
adult readers have gained self es-
teem and personal empowerment. 
Women have gained confidence in 
speaking during village meetings 
and running for village positions.‚Äù 
CBP wishes to expand, but lacks 
resources to do so. Ms Dumea 
urges: ‚ÄúWe would like to go to all 
schools, especially those in the re-
motest of areas, but we lack suffi-
cient resources. We need the gov-
ernment‚Äôs support.‚Äù 
CBP spends just over US$ 
325,000 a year and is funded by 
various international and national 
governmental and non-governmen-
tal donors from Europe and North 
America. ‚ÄúOur strategies can be 
adopted in schools to improve the 
learning situation, build a reading 
culture in both children and adults 
which, in the long run, will lead to 
sustainable development,‚Äù says Ms 
Dumea, concluding: ‚ÄúThere is a 
need to rekindle the desire to read 
amongst society at large, for, be-
yond the textbooks, it is the memory 
of the story books that lasts longest 
in our minds.‚Äù

The loNG-lasTiNG memory of sTorybooks
Our gaze alights on the world. Our heart beats as the world beats. Our hands caress the world‚Äôs 
curves, our laughter tickles the world and our tears leave it trembling, but the world would be nothing 
without our words to tell it, without our words to believe it, without our words to build it.
Small letters, big sentences, pebbles of ink on white deserts of paper and screen, signs of stone, 
scratches and traces, lines of sand, we draw at the surface of the earth a second landscape that remains 
and recalls truths and memory to other humans. 
Because reading is indeed remembering the one who lived and who wrote. And writing is indeed think-
ing about the one who will come after us and, in the invisible books, rub up against our stirred thoughts, 
still living when we are dead, despite our long-ago disappearance. 
Take all these letters left by all men, these letters that tell our humanity, take them in your pocket, in your 
mouth, in your dreams, in your fists. 
Keep them like the treasures they are. 
Let no one steal them, but on the contrary share them with everyone. 
Help the one who hesitates to grab them, who struggles to befriend them. 
Be his master so he can become one himself. 
Make him like you. 
Because our first freedom is that of language, spoken language, murmured, written and deciphered, 
friend language, mother language, sweet language, language that comes under our fingers, on our lips 
and under our gaze like the great mirror of our humanity

### Literacy versus poverty
8
Situated in a mountainous area in 
the north-east of Guangxi Zhuang, 
Longsheng Autonomous County is 
inhabited by some 170,000 people, 
three-quarters of them belonging to 
ethnic minorities (Miao, Yao, Tong 
and Zhuang). The literacy rate is to-
day particularly high, thanks to the 
Community Education Administra-
tion Centre. 
As part of its literacy programme 
for women (launched in 1992) and 
its programme of poverty eradica-
tion through education (1998), the 
Centre has virtually eliminated illit-
eracy: nearly 100% of young adults 
in the county can now read and 
write. And the 3700 ethnic minor-
ity women living in the county that 
were found to be illiterate in 1997, 
had all acquired literacy in 2000, 
according to a survey.
Made-to-measure  
instruction
While it is difficult to end illiteracy, 
it is even more difficult to maintain 
the literacy rate at a satisfactory 
level. This is why the Centre also 
launched the idea of home school-
ing: teachers go to women‚Äôs homes 
to teach them to read and write, and 
follow up to make sure they don‚Äôt 
forget what they learned. 
The key to the Centre‚Äôs success is 
its use of teaching methods geared 
to local conditions: bilingual text-
books (Mandarin-Yao, Mandarin-
Zhuang, Mandarin-Tong and Man-
darin-Miao); classes comprising 
students who belong to the same 
ethnic group; flexible schedules 
(night school, classes during the off-
season); enhanced education curri-
cula (studies associated with prac-
tical activities); classes according 
to category of student (boys, girls); 
possibilities for boarding, individual 
assistance and so on. Another es-
sential ingredient is the involvement 
of all community members, from the 
youngest to the oldest, by way of 
village cadres and activist farmers. 
And finally, the teaching is effective 
because it creates a link with devel-
opment of agriculture, tourism and 
services.
Forty thousand fewer 
poor people
Pan Jufeng, for example, learned to 
read and write at age 40 through 
the Centre‚Äôs programmes, after 
which she trained another 35 illiter-
ate women and created a song and 
dance troupe with her ‚Äòpupils‚Äô. Later, 
the members of this ensemble, hav-
ing taken elementary English les-
sons, focused on tourism. The team 
now receives hundreds of visitors a 
day. They have become a pillar of 
the region‚Äôs tourism. 
Pan Jufeng symbolizes the Cen-
tre‚Äôs success, one might add. She 
took part in the national women‚Äôs 
literacy contest held in Beijing and 
won first prize. 
What proved crucial for the 
Longsheng communities was com-
bining literacy with technological

### Literacy versus poverty
Joining forces against illiteracy
W hat is the best way to promote literacy in countries such as Indonesia and Papua New 
Guinea, where an extraordinary linguistic diversity prevails? How can people learn to read 
and write in rural and isolated areas? What initiatives can benefit migrants? These ques-
tions and a host of others were covered in discussions during the Sub-Regional Confer-
ence in Support of Literacy in East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific held in Beijing (China) on 
31 July and 1 August. 
The conference, bringing together more than 200 participants from 15 countries, was the second 
in a series of six regional and sub-regional conferences organized by UNESCO with the aim of redu- 
cing illiteracy around the world. The first took place in Doha (Qatar) in March 2007. Four more confer-
ences along the same lines in Mali, India, Costa Rica and Azerbaijan will be held between now and 
the end of 2008. The objective of the meetings is to build cooperation between stakeholders ‚Äì high-
level policy-makers, international organizations, NGOs, civil society members ‚Äì as well as to identify 
effective projects and mobilize resources. 
These initiatives follow up the White House Conference on Global Literacy organized in New York 
on 18 September 2006, hosted by Laura Bush, First Lady of the United States and Honorary Ambas-
sador for the United Nations Literacy Decade. The conference kicked off an extensive international 
campaign promoting literacy in the context of the UN Literacy Decade (2003-2012).
After Doha (Qatar), beijing (China) hosted  
the second regional conference in support of literacy.  
before the end of 2008, four more meetings of this kind  
will be held to boost the fight against illiteracy.

areas connected to everyday life. 
Today, numerous farmers and arti-

or three specialties besides their

per inhabitant rose to 1978.4 yuan

### From idea to breakthrough: the inspiring story of Tostan
10
SSaturday, 21 July 2007. At 9 a.m., 
Sam Ndiaye has yet to emerge 
from its torpor. A diffuse, light tor-
por, unlike that of so many other 
Senegalese villages. A joyful torpor! 
Because this village of nearly 500 
souls, located some 80 kilometres 
from Dakar and two kilometres from 
the nearest asphalt road, may not 
yet have electricity, but its inhabit-
ants exude a rare joie de vivre. 
Warm welcomes sound from all 
sides ‚Äì from the village chief who 
receives the required courtesy visit 
most cordially, from the head of the 
local Degoo organization (‚Äúaccord‚Äù 
in Wolof, Senegal‚Äôs most wide-
spread language), and in between, 
from Sam Ndiaye‚Äôs women and 
children. 
Besides Senegalese hospitality, 
which is legendary, particularly in 
the rural world, the population‚Äôs en-
thusiasm is prompted by the nature 
of the visit: a journalist, escorted by 
Tostan‚Äôs programme director, has 
come to profile the achievements of 
the non-governmental organization, 
which has gained recognition with 
its remarkable non-formal basic 
education programme. And as it 
turns out, Sam Ndiaye played a sig-
nificant role in the inspiring story of 
Tostan, because it all began here. 
A Wolof word, ‚Äòtostan‚Äô means 
‚Äòhatch‚Äô or ‚Äòbreakthrough‚Äô. And, judg-
ing by the results, we can indeed 
talk about a genuine breakthrough, 
to the great satisfaction of Molly 
Melching, Executive Director of the 
      literacy, microcredit, rejection of female circumcision ‚Äì these are among 
      the achievements of Tostan, 2007 laureate of uNeSCo‚Äôs king Sejong literacy Prize.
       The NGo focuses on adolescents and adults, most of whom have never set foot in school. 
               Distinguishing characteristics: mother tongue instruction and use 
                            of traditional modes of communication.
NGO, which aims to provide partici-
pants with the knowledge and skills 
they need to become empowered 
individuals, able to take charge of 
their economic development and 
bring about social change within 
their community.
Mother language, 
key to success
Ms Melching founded Tostan in 
1991, after developing the Demb 
ak Tey (‚ÄòYesterday and Today‚Äô in 
Wolof) resource centre, which also 
offered non-formal education, from 
1976 to 1988. She took advantage 
of suggestions from participants 
and outside evaluations to better 
adapt her new NGO‚Äôs programme 
to people‚Äôs needs.

permanent employees in Dakar and 
Thies, in Senegal, 303 contractors 
work all around the country. In ad-
dition, more than 40 staff and 160 
contractors are scattered through-
out Guinea, Somalia and Gambia. 
A similar programme has just been 
launched in Mauritania. 
For the last 15 years, Tostan has 
developed relationships with vari-
ous donors including UNICEF, 
the United States Agency for In-
ternational Development (USAID), 
the Wallace Foundation, the Wal-
lace Global Fund and the Hilda 
and Jacob Blaustein Foundation, 
as well as other foundations and 
individual donors. In 2006 its 
annual expenses totalled more than 
US$ 3,200,000. 
In a UNESCO publication*, Cyn-
thia Guttman rightly pointed out 
that Tostan demonstrates how 
people who have received no for-
mal education, coming from villages 
with minimal resources, can im-
prove their environments and their 
lives, thanks to a well-designed 
programme that opens the way to 
greater self-determination.
Mamadou Amat, 
Senegalese journalist
*Breaking through: TOSTAN‚Äôs non-formal 
basic education programme in national  
languages in Senegal, UNESCO, 1995
At the beginning, recalls Khalidou 
Sy, Tostan‚Äôs Programme Director, 
the goal was to promote non-formal 
education in Dakar‚Äôs working-class 
Medina neighbourhood for chil-
dren in difficult circumstances, who 
weren‚Äôt part of the normal National 
Education system. ‚ÄúThese children 
thus had access to books, theatre, 
puppets, various games and other 
activities inspired by Senegalese 
tradition and in their mother tongue,‚Äù 
he explains. The approach was fur-
ther refined as time went on and 
produced tangible results, which 
are visible in Sam Ndiaye and nu-
merous other communities. 
As for Ms Melching, she empha-
sizes ‚Äúthe importance of human 
rights education, not at university or 
academic level, but at the people‚Äôs 
level, in their national languages.‚Äù 
Human rights education is ‚Äúthe 
foundation of all community devel-
opment projects,‚Äù she explains. 
But if there‚Äôs one facet that makes 
Executive Director Melching partic-
ularly proud, it‚Äôs the empowerment 
of women. Those who have partici-
pated in Tostan‚Äôs programmes now 
express their ideas in public and 
participate in decision-making with-
in their families and communities. 
Some have emerged as leaders 
of opinion, like the Malicounda vil-
lage women who became pioneers 
when they decided to put an end 
to the harmful ancestral tradition of 
female circumcision.
Education 
= Self-determination
Tostan operates outside the formal 
education system and is directed at 
people who, for the most part, have 
never attended school. Its capacity-
building programme for communi-
ties aims to provide participants 
with life skills related to democracy, 
human rights, health, hygiene, litera-
cy, business management, account-
ing, microcredit, etc. It lasts for 30 
months and uses traditional modes 
of communication including discus-
sion, song, dance, theatre and po-
etry. It is implemented by specially-
trained volunteers who usually 
belong to the same ethnic group 
as the community concerned. The 
facilitators live in the villages where 
they give their classes, three times a 
week, to groups of 30 participants. 
Each village has a class for adoles-
cents and another for adults. 
With international headquarters 
in Washington, D.C. in the United 
States, where five people work 
(one staff and four volunteers), 
Tostan runs its African office in the 
Senegalese capital. Besides the 66

### Reach out and read: linking literacy and health
T

hree-year-old Miguel lived in Los 
Angeles, California, with his moth-
er, who faced chronic illness, de-
pression and poverty. Despite this, 
she brought Miguel to the doctor 
for his well-child visits. Each time 
they left the clinic, Miguel clutched 
a brand-new Reach Out and Read 
book. Miguel and his mother cher-
ished those books. Two years later, 
Miguel is the number one reader in 
his kindergarten class. He loves to 
read and he looks set to become 
a lifelong learner. Miguel is cer-
tain to face many obstacles, but 
Reach Out and Read has brought 
hope to his life. His success, says 
his paediatrician, is a testament to 
the power of Reach Out and Read 
to help families break the cycle of 
poverty. 
This year, thousands of doctors 
will give 4.6 million new books to 
2.8 million infants, toddlers and 
preschoolers from low-income 
families at check-ups and advise 
their parents about the importance 
of reading. The only American lit-
eracy programme featured at the 
recent White House Conference 
on Global Literacy, Reach Out 
and Read doctors distribute new 
books at more than 3000 paedi-
atric practices, hospitals, clinics 
and health centres throughout 
all 50 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. To date, 
American doctors have given out 
more than 20 million books. Inter-
national programmes modelled 
on Reach Out and Read have 
been started in Bangladesh, Italy, 
Israel, the Philippines, England, 
and Canada.
Language and health
Reach Out and Read focuses on 
the most vulnerable children, 6 
months to 5 year-olds living in or 
near poverty. Today, Reach Out and 
Read helps about 25% of Ameri-
ca‚Äôs most impoverished children. 
      one of uNeSCo‚Äôs two Confucius Prizes for literacy was attributed this year 
            to the u.S. organization, reach out and read, for its work with health care providers 
                       to reach low-income children at risk of dropping out of school.
And the number grows daily. Each 
child who participates in Reach Out 
and Read starts kindergarten with a 
home library of up to 10 books and 
a parent who has heard, at every 
well-child visit, about the impor-
tance of books and reading. Doc-
tors participating in Reach Out and 
Read distribute carefully selected 
new, developmentally and cultur-
ally appropriate books ‚Äì starting 
with board books for babies and

### Reach out and read: linking literacy and health
books for preschoolers. Bilingual 
books are available in 12 languag-
es. Some sites also have volunteer 
readers who read to children in the 
waiting rooms. 
Research shows that the pro-
gramme really works. Parents 
who get books and literacy coun-
selling from their doctors and 
nurses are more likely to read to 
their young children, read to them 
more often, and provide more 
books at home. Low-income chil-
dren exposed to Reach Out and 
Read show improved language 
development, a critical compo-
nent of school readiness. Chil-
dren score four to eight points 
higher on vocabulary tests, giving 
2-year-olds a six-month head start 
developmentally. Reach Out and 
Read is endorsed by the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics. 
Reach Out and Read was co-
founded by Barry Zuckerman, 
M.D., a 6‚Äô5‚Äù (1.95 m) gentle giant 
who has great warmth, passion 
and unwavering determination 
that all children start life with 
books in their home and a parent 
who reads to them. 
‚ÄúReach Out and Read started 
as a single programme at Bos-
ton City Hospital [now Boston 
Medical Centre] with the goal of 
making literacy promotion a stan-
dard part of paediatric primary 
care,‚Äù says Zuckerman, Board 
Chair and CEO of the organiza-
tion, who is also Professor and 
Chairman of the Department of 
Paediatrics of the Boston Medi-
cal Centre at Boston University 
School of Medicine. ‚ÄúToday, we 
reach millions of at-risk children 
in the U.S. and serve as a model 
for programmes around the world. 
But we are far from reaching our 
goal of providing books to every 
child and literacy counselling to 
every parent living in poverty.‚Äù
Taking advantage  
of existing structures
Although, by international stan-
dards, the U.S. is considered a rich 
country, 35% of American children 
start school without the language 
skills necessary to learn to read. 
‚ÄúOne of the tremendous advantag-
es of Reach Out and Read,‚Äù says 
Perri Klass, M.D., Medical Director 
of Reach Out and Read and Pro-
fessor of Journalism and Paediat-
rics at New York University, ‚Äúis that

on the value of literacy
A
s a poet, I cannot imagine a life without words. Language is the element in which the mind lives, and it 
is the very basis of human being.
It is that which distinguishes Man from all other creatures. To speak, to read and write, to encounter the 
power and beauty and magic of words‚Äîthese are gifts that enrich and ennoble our existence. It seems 
almost miraculous to me that a child, only two or three years of age, can learn the complexities of language. But 
children take possession of language naturally, as a birthright. And it should be by birthright also that the child 
learns to read and write, and is therefore enabled to discover the riches of the world and to share those riches 
with others. I believe with all my heart that every person in the world is entitled to the gift of literacy. We must 
provide that gift to the best of our ability, for doing so ensures our humanity and makes possible the realization 
of a more nearly perfect world.

and UNESCO Artist for Peace

health care structures, which are to 
be found in virtually every country 
in the world to deliver basic health 
care to children.‚Äù 
Nearly 46,000 medical provi- 
ders have been trained by Reach 
Out and Read since its founding in 
1989. The programme now spends 
a total of over US$30 million per 
annum on its activities across the 
U.S.A. and receives support from 
the U.S. Department of Education, 
as well as 12 states and cities. It 
also receives donations from cor-
porations, foundations, and indi-
viduals. 
While doctors give a lot of impor-
tant advice at check-ups, few inter-
ventions have been the object of as 
much research that substantiates 
their ability to impact behaviour at 
home. ‚ÄúReach Out and Read has 
one of the strongest records of 
peer-reviewed research support of 
any primary care intervention,‚Äù Dr. 
Klass says. ‚ÄúBecause we give fami-
lies the books, we provide the tool 
to follow the advice.‚Äù 
‚ÄúImproved language is the single 
strongest predictor for school suc-
cess. Reach Out and Read is work-
ing to reach parents and children 
at the critical stage before they 
enter kindergarten so children en-
ter school prepared for success in 
reading.‚Äù

sent by Boma, a former student, to 
inform Alaibe of her progress since 
she was transferred to secondary

deep into the rural areas of Bayelsa 
and Delta States, where access is 
difficult. There are many areas that 
you can‚Äôt reach except by spending 
three or four hours on a boat.‚Äù 
Poor road and water networks and 
difficult access in many villages and 
towns can frustrate development 
plans for the region. But they do not 
deter Alaibe, 43, whose background 
is in Bayelsa though she was born 
and educated in Lagos. ‚ÄúI come 
from a family of seven girls and two 
boys who were educated by a poor 
and illiterate mother in a poor area of 
Lagos. I thought if my siblings could 
take turns to help our mother sell fish 
in the Ajegunle boundary market, and 
all nine of us have university educa-
tion now, I think it is only fair to give 
back to this region,‚Äù Alaibe says. 
Three years before the inauguration 
of her NGO, she had been rousing 
rural Bayelsa women folk with a new 
not-for-profit project, FREE, which has 
become a useful platform for mass 
literacy programmes, especially for 
women who missed their first chance 
of getting educated. It was her per-
sonal initiative that started the project 
with the creation in 2002 of the first 
Pioneer Adult and Non-Formal Study 
Centre at Trofani. Another was soon 
created at Opokuma. The number of 
centres grew to 16, spanning 12 
communities, after FREE became 
fully operational in 2005. This re-
markable educational project now 
numbers 27 centres that provide lit-
eracy training to some 700 learners 
and it is spreading to more commu-
nities. 
In 2006, FREE built the Support 
for Africa Health Centre in Igbain-
wari Town, in Bayelsa State, in part-
nership with the UK-based Support 
for Africa Foundation of Nigerian-
born singer, Patti Boulaye. FREE 
also organizes education and 
health seminars and a large number 
of activities, including free eye tests 
and the distribution of spectacles 
to students. 
Old women with no education at 
all are a priority target group for 
FREE, which also accepts single 
mothers and youths with missed 
opportunities. ‚ÄúOur aim in this area 
is to design a curriculum that will be 
good enough to make them return 
to standard schools so that they 
can fit in with other students,‚Äù Alai-
be says. Lucky students in this cat-
egory enjoy free scholarships from 
a bank, negotiated by FREE. Close 
to 20% of FREE‚Äôs learners wind up 
returning to formal education.
Bridging the gap
This method is proving to be a re-
markable support system in Nigeria, 
where only 35% of the population 
is literate. Although public education 
is free at the primary and secondary 
levels, many years of infrastructural 
decay and official neglect have dras-
tically lowered standards, according 
to Universal Basic Education (UBE), 
a Federal Government of Nigeria 
organization. Literacy is even lower 
among girls and women, due to social 
and cultural prejudices, which still 
prioritize education opportunities for 
boys. Many families, unable to afford

school uniforms and meals, are pre-
vented from sending their wards to

admissions to tertiary institutions 
every year in a country of 140 million 
people. 
FREE‚Äôs initiative bridges the gap 
between expensive private schools 
and failing public establishments, 
especially in the Niger Delta.
With support from the National 
Mass Education Commission 
and teachers who agree to take 
less than Nigeria‚Äôs minimum wage 
‚Äì of 5000 Niaras monthly (about 
US$40) ‚Äì  FREE provides eve-
ning classes between 4 and 6 p.m., 
Monday to Friday, in all its centres. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a volatile region and sometimes 
we are greeted with aggression. 
It takes a lot to convince them that 
we are not calling them out for po-
litical reasons,‚Äù says Alaibe, whose 
husband, Timi, heads the Niger Delta 
Development Commission (NDDC), 
the government agency mandated 
to bring improvement to the region. 
Her privileged position, coupled 
with people‚Äôs scepticism about 
fund-raising methods of NGOs, 
makes fund-raising difficult. But per-
sonal and family resources, corpo-
rate support and small contributions 
from community leaders have helped 
keep the project alive, and FREE 
operates with an annual budget 
of 20 million Niaras, approximately 
US$150,000. 
FREE‚Äôs message of hope con-
tinues through people like Regina 
Joyful, a community women‚Äôs leader 
in Igbogene. She used to thumb-
print to cash her money at banks. 
But after two years with FREE, she 
proudly announces that she can 
now append her signature on the

The alphabet of poverty
A long time ago, I was a merciless schoolteacher. I was barely ten 
years old and my pupil was close to sixty. I was arrogant from the 
height of my good fortune. I knew how to read and write. I‚Äôd been 
lucky to be born in a country where school was compulsory from 
age six. I didn‚Äôt yet realize how lucky I was. My pupil was my grandmother. 
A stubborn pupil, narrow-minded, who balked, it seemed to me, at making 
the little letters of the alphabet enter into her old brain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late,‚Äù she 
moaned. ‚ÄúMy head is an arid savannah. My mind is a basket with holes. 
It‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶.‚Äù I lost my temper. It was clear that she wanted to thwart me. 
‚ÄúYou will learn! It‚Äôs easy! Come on!‚Äù I ordered. ‚ÄúRepeat: A! A! A!‚Äù I‚Äôd had the 
good luck to grow up at a time when children weren‚Äôt forced into the cane 
fields. I didn‚Äôt yet realize how lucky I was. My grandmother had watched her 
neighbours set off on the path to school. There you sang the words formed 
in letters of all shapes and sizes, like the animals that populated the earth, 
the seas and the sky. My grandmother, because of poverty, was shown 
the road that led to the sugarcane field. That‚Äôs where her arms and sweat 
and courage were needed. And never mind the letters written in chalk on 
the blackboard. Never mind the words hung too high for her, inaccessible, 
reserved for the elite. Now I think of all those children, here and elsewhere, 
who will never go to school because of poverty, because of wars, because 
of everyday hell. I think of all those children. Those who go into the fields 
every morning. Those who dig mines, wearing out their hands and their 
eyes and their innocence. Those who don‚Äôt go to school because they are 
used as slaves, because their bodies are coveted merchandise. Those who 
are prostituted. Those who spin wool and build houses. Those who beg 
from morning until night in the sun and in the rain. Those who walk along 
the roads for stagnant water and stale bread. Those who will never know 
the joy of reading and writing. Now I realize how lucky I was.

ike many writers of the young na-
tions of the late Third World, I ended 
up writing because those who had 
written about my country, my peo-
ple or my culture (I now put leaden 
quotation marks around all those 
notions) did not always give me en-
tire satisfaction. We are aware by 
now of Chinua Achebe‚Äôs suspicious 
examination of the otherwise sub-
lime work of Joseph Conrad. As for 
myself, I was often left hungry. The 
maritime adventures of the gentle-
man, Henry de Monfreid, to cite but 
one example, are unworthy of the 
most puerile childishness ‚Äì sheeka 
carruureed, as we say in Somali. Yet 
I don‚Äôt pretend, obviously, to satisfy 
all those who read or will read me. I 
am set on bringing my contribution, 
simply and modestly, to share with 
everyone ‚Äì countrymen, friends, 
guests passing through and for-
eigners, of course. For me, reading 
and writing represent much more 
than entertainment: they mean par-
ticipating ‚Äì sorry, I‚Äôm going to use 
a grand phrase ‚Äì in the edification 
thing that fell into my hands and ar-
rived as far as my shantytown: last 
month‚Äôs issue of the popular French 
magazines Paris Match and Nous 
Deux, wet from girlfriends‚Äô tears, 
a used Blek Le Roc comic strip, a 
Reader‚Äôs Digest landed from who 
knows where, a San Antonio de-
tective story or G√©rard de Villiers 
spy novel, if the gods were kind. As 
an adolescent I travelled on foot the 
two or three kilometres separating 
me from the country‚Äôs only library, 
the French Cultural Centre Arthur 
Rimbaud, located in the real town. 
Having ransacked the comic strip 
section, I attacked the so-called se-
rious reading, at least at that time in 
my life, which comprised Albert Ca-
mus as well as Christiane Roche-
fort. At the lyc√©e, I made other dis-
coveries at the Reading Club, run 
by my French teacher and attended 
essentially by girls. My friends, who 
aspired to the serious disciplines 
(maths, physical sciences) openly 
despised my reading and my femi-
nine clan. It is only in France that 
I fully discovered the French- and 
English-speaking writers of Africa, 
the Caribbean, India, France or the 
entire world (from Nuruddin Farah 
to Derek Walcott, Mario Vargas 
Llosa to J.M. Coetzee, Walter Ben-
jamin to Joseph Roth, Michel Le 
Bris to Jacques Lacarri√®re, Pierre 
Bergounioux to Tahar Bekri), in 
short these inspirations that enthral 
me and lighten the burden of life. 
I never suspected for an instant that 
some of these authors I admired 
could one day become acquain-
tances, colleagues and even more, 
friends like Nuruddin Farah. I blithe-
ly stepped over the barrier sepa-
rating the reading and the writing. 
Reading and writing, the two tracks 
of my life. 
Abdourahman A. Waberi, 
Djiboutian writer
of the Nation. Reading and writing 
are also a way to live. To drift be-
tween the here and the elsewhere, 
two more and more elusive places, 
indistinct, scintillating with paradox. 
I continued to advance leaning on 
the guardrail of writing, to stagger in 
the spirals of spoken, translated and 
written poetry, most often in French. 
I buried myself in the ashes of Paul 
Celan‚Äôs language: ‚ÄúNe cherche pas 
sur mes l√®vres ta bouche, /ni devant 
le portail l‚Äô√©tranger, /ni dans l‚Äô≈ìil la 
larme‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúSeek not your mouth on 
my lips, nor a stranger at the gate, 
/nor a tear in the eye‚Ä¶‚Äù (Cristal, 
Gallimard, 1998). It spoke, it moved 
and it comforted the foreign student 
I was at the end of the 1980s and 
who I never stopped being. 
That is how, at less than 30 years 
old, I entered the educational cur-
riculum of my country. That is how 
future graduates sweat blood over 
my short stories (my novels are sub-
jected to a subtle but very effective 
censorship!) in mid-June, during the 
Baccalaureate exam, an exam that 
is still, 20 years into independence, 
in French and certified by the acad-
emy in Bordeaux, Rouen or Besan-
√ßon. Strange dizziness. 
What to read, then? For me, 
coming from a poor family without 
books except for a tattered and 
rarely opened copy of the Koran, 
I read almost nothing at home. I 
lived a schizophrenic childhood 
between two completely separate 
worlds, torn apart between family 
and school. Reading (in French, of 
course) was first accomplished in 
primary school through the inter-
vention of a sensitive teacher who 
introduced us to adventure novels. 
Eug√®ne Sue and his Mysteries of 
Paris, the great Alexandre Dumas, 
The Three Musketeers, and the 
bard Victor Hugo, Les Mis√©rables, 
were our first green pastures. Later 
I read, in the pell-mell of life, every-

‚ÄúAnd since only a few letters (two or three 
thousand in Asia, I am told, fewer than thirty in 
the West) suffice to formulate all human 
languages, then words are indeed the 
foundation of all cultures, of all nations.‚Äù

‚ÄúMacon focused his eyes on his son. 
‚ÄúPapa couldn‚Äôt read, couldn‚Äôt even sign his

Everything bad that ever happened to him 
happened because he couldn‚Äôt read.‚Äù

‚ÄúReading is an activity that has always been 
regarded with mitigated enthusiasm by 
those who govern us. It is not by chance 
that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, laws 
were passed forbidding slaves to read, 
even the Bible.‚Äù

what I wrote when I see that others understand 
it too, but never before.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember you are writing, not for critics, academics, 
or other writers, but for your own people who, in their silence 
and perhaps poverty, cannot express their aspirations 
and anguish. You are their voice but only if you have 
not deserted or betrayed them.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe felt ashamed, and placed the volume in the little 
boy‚Äôs hand: ‚ÄúTake this, it‚Äôs yours!‚Äù The child grasped 
it contentedly: ‚ÄúOK‚Ä¶ but I cannot read yet.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNeither can I,‚Äù said Vell≈ë. The little boy laughed, 
he thought the old man was joking.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe the ability to read isn‚Äôt something one absolutely 
needs to get by in this world. Still, if there are people  
who have the desire to read or write but are never given 
the chance, that‚Äôs not right. The world matured 
long enough ago that it ought to be able to give 
that chance to everyone‚Äù
