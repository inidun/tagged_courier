In the Great Market Square
of the new Rotterdam,
which rose from the ruins of
the Second World War,
stands the statue of Erasmus
reading (left). Wrought In copper
by Henry de Keyzer in 1622,
it replaced two earlier
statues of the great humanist,
one of polychromed stone
raised in 1557, the other a wooden
effigy placed In 1549 in front
of the house where Erasmus
was born 100 years earlier.
Below, a 16th century
engraving of Rotterdam, then
only a tiny township on the
River Rotte.
HAT a strange story we
have In the life of that nameless
child who was born In Rotterdam
in mysterious, if not shameful, circum¬
stances on the night of 27-28 October
in the year 1469 (or was 1466, 1467
or perhaps even 1468?). Yet in the
course of his lifetime he won the name
of Prince of Humanism and left a mark
so profound that for five centuries he
has deeply influenced Man's think¬
ing, an influence now being marked in
the Erasmus 500th Anniversary Year.
But in studying his influence, the
historian of philosophy has come to
realize that the case of Erasmus leaves
more questions unanswered than it
supplies real answers. This has clearly
JEAN-CLAUDE MARGOLIN of France is one
of the leading European authorities on Eras¬
mus. He is the author of eight major works
on the Dutch thinker, one of which his trans¬
lation and critical study of Erasmus's "De-
clamatio de Pueris Statim ac Liberaliter Ins-
tltuendis" won him in 1967 the Prix Langlols
of the Académie Française. He is now at
work on the second volume of a fully annotat¬
ed edition of the complete works of Erasmus,

demy of Sciences and Letters, and Is direct¬

emerged from the recent seminars,
congresses, conferences and scholarly
publications which the Anniversary has
provoked from Basel to New York,
from Mons to Tours, from Brussels to
Rotterdam and Paris.
The fact Is that the author of In
Praise of Folly a book which, despite
its innumerable editions, translations
and printings, is better known for its
title than for its contents has achieved
fame and influenced the thinking of
individuals and nations through chan¬
nels not those generally thought
of as ensuring posthumous fame.
Erasmus was no leader of men, his
name is linked to no philosophical sys¬
tem, and if today much is made of
"Erasmism" or the "Erasmian spirit,"
the sense of these terms is at best
loose and subjective. Unlike Luther,
Zwingli or Calvin, he was not the foun¬
der of a religion; he escaped all forms
of persecution at a time when unrest,
civil and foreign wars were taking a
toll of his best friends, victims of their
religious faith or political involvement.
And while he produced a large body
of work, he did so in a language acces¬
sible only to scholars, Latin, and the
greater part of his writings is made up

ERASMUS (Continued)
The life
of a wandering
scholar
of philological commentaries, annota¬
tions of the Bible, translations from
Greek into Latin, which in our time are
of immediate interest only to a hand¬
ful of scholars.
What Is it then that has given Eras¬
mus his immortal name and why is he
considered so modern that Unesco
feels justified in paying tribute to this
Dutch monk with an ill-chosen career
who during his life was not always
successful in dominating the particu¬
larly complex and seething period of
time stretching from the fringes of the
Middle Ages to the Renaissance?
Any attempts on the part of his
commentators to reduce him to a
system are defeated by the many-sided
aspects of the Rotterdam "philoso¬
pher". His mobility of mind, his richly
impressionable nature, his many con¬
tradictions and the hazards of his life
in which historical events played a part
that did not enter into his scheme of
things, place him beyond the standard
classifications found in encyclopedias.
For all that, I shall attempt to show
that in spite of his extreme individ¬
ualism, in spite of his being so pro¬
foundly a man of his time, and so dif¬
ferent from our own, we cannot help
recognizing in Erasmus a universal
thinker, standing high above his epoch
and free from the temptations and
snares of anti-humanistic nationalism,
whether viewed in terms of his own
16th century or our 20th century.

The illegitimate son of a priest from
Gouda (named Geert of Gerard) and
of the daughter of a physician from
Zevenbeque, he gained renown under
the Latinized name of Desiderius Eras¬
mus Roterodamus, which he assumed
after the death of his parents, thereby
immortalizing the little town on the
Rotte where he was born.
His first schooling was at Gouda
under Peter Winkel, then as a choris¬
ter at Utrecht and finally, at the age
of nine or ten, as a pupil of the famous
school attached to St. Lebwin's Church
at Deventer. His parents having died
of the plague, he was put in the care
of his uncles who dispossessed him
and sent him to Hertogenbosch to be
prepared for a monastic life in the
community of the Brethren of the Com¬
mon Life. Although he was to declare
later that he had wasted three or four
years of his life there, he was never¬
theless initiated into logic, dialectics,
the study of the Bible and, towards the
end, a grounding in humanities.
He was driven back to Gouda by the
plague and in 1487 entered the Augus-
tinian convent at Steyn where he was
ordained priest on April 25, 1492, the
very year Christopher Colombus
reached America. There he was able
to read the classics to his heart's con¬
tent, make a careful study of the
Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla's De
Elegantiis Latinae Linguae (Latin Ele¬
gances) and write poems in Latin.
These activities apparently suited
him better than monastic life, although
he formed a close friendship with Ser-
vatius Roger who was later to become
prior of the convent. Permission was
granted him to leave Steyn to become
Latin secretary to the bishop of Cam¬
brai, Henry of Bergen, who was soon
to consent to his going to Paris to
attend a course in theology.
In 1495, Erasmus did, in fact, enter
the "Collège de Montaigu" in the Latin
quarter of Paris, the "foul-smelling,
infested pauper's school" as he called
it and as Rabelais was to qualify it in
almost identical terms. Then, after a
short stay in Cambrai and in Holland
where he had already gained a repu¬
tation as an "orator" or "poet", that
is to say as a learned man, he returned
to the French capital where he eked
out a living giving rich pupils lessons
in grammar and literature.
One of these pupils was Lord Wil¬
liam Mountjoy who invited him over to
England at the end of 1499. He was
happy in England and the friendships
he formed amongst the most prominent
people there, while ensuring him the
material means he needed to satisfy
his love for learning, gave him the
opportunity for discovering his real
bent as a humanist and theologian.
Two English friends were to exercise
a profound influence on his thinking
and personal life. One was John Colet,
then professor of Theology at Oxford

### 58737: Erasmus, universal thinker of yesterday for today

and soon to become Dean of St. Paul's
Cathedral in London; the other was
Thomas More, his companion in work
and honest pleasures, future Chan¬
cellor and future martyr of the Tower
of London whom he praised as "a man
for all seasons," the famous formula
that the playwright, Robert Bolt, used
for the title of his play which was
recently staged in many countries the
world over.
Erasmus returned to the Continent
in 1500 and thereafter was to remain
true to the double purpose of his life:
the scholar who was soon to publish
the first edition of the Adagia (1500)
and the theologian whose Enchiridion
Militis Christiani, or Manual for a
Christian Soldier (1503) ¡s a bold plea
for the internal reform of the Church.
Until his death in Basel on July 12,
1536, he continued to lead the life of
a wandering Scholar, driven as he was
by motivations so diverse as the search
for a Patron, the study of a rare manu¬
script, flight from an area devastated by
war, the plague, sweating sickness or
much later subversive ideas, pro¬
posals from a printer wanting to secure
the exclusive rights to his literary
works, or the presence of the Emperor
at Aachen or Brussels.
So it came about that Erasmus of
Batavia (the Latin name for the Nether¬
lands) who had always professed deep
attachment to his small country, was
to become increasingly European and

cosmopolitan. Remaining true to his
nature and to the ethical and
Christian purpose of his writings, he
was to discover his true vocation for
universality and receive consecration
as the first citizen of the Republic of
Letters which, in his mind, he always
identified with Christendom.
I think that this vocation for univer¬
sality which perhaps partly explains his
significance today, appears through¬
out his work as well as in his per¬
sonal behaviour. The man who proudly
proclaimed as his motto: "I make con¬
cessions to no one," but who was also
at the mercy of political and religious
antagonisms, ("I am a Guelph for the
Ghibellines and a Ghibelline for the
Guelphs") was neither an individualist
grimly clinging to his rights and prero¬
gatives nor a neutral or indifferent in¬
tellectual standing aloof from the gen¬
eral fray, as certain careless or dis¬
honest commentators have claimed.
He was uncompromising on princi¬
ples, but not on ways of applying them.
And to safeguard peace, that most pre¬
cious of all treasures, he would readily
have advised using manoeuvres like
those of Ulysses the Greek and Hector
of Troy, to avert the Trojan War, as
Jean Giraudoux imagined in his play
"La Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu".
This is what he himself tried to do
when Christendom was not yet divided
in two and he maintained courteous
relations with Martin Luther.

Most of the portraits of Erasmus were
painted by Hans Holbein (see back

drawings of Erasmus's hands, including
the one (left) of his right
hand holding a pen. A man of vast
learning, Erasmus had also a keen
humour as shown in the "doodles" (below)
which he made in the margins of
some of his manuscripts. The topmost of
these little faces is a self-caricature
of his own long-nosed profile.

### 58737: Erasmus, universal thinker of yesterday for today

ERASMUS (Continued)
Champion of the Spirit of Dissent
Today, when old university structures
and educational methods are being
seriously challenged in virtually every
country, when Vatican Council II has
set in motion inside and outside the
Catholic Church a wave of liberaliza¬
tion and a powerful movement toward
a new Oecumenism, when people
everywhere, through countless private
and public organizations, are voicing
their determination that the principles
of human rights be uncompromisingly
applied in all countries and clamour¬
ing for positive action to free mankind
from the paralyzing effects of greed
and narrow self-interest, mutual fear
and suspicion and hopeless despair,
how can we fail to respond to the
words of Erasmus, even If the problems
of his time were quite different from
those we face in our day?
T.

HIS master humanist, who
might fittingly be called the Tutor of
Europe, just as his friend Melanchthon
was appropriately named "Tutor of
Germany", proved to be a better edu¬
cational adviser than a teacher. Neither
his temperament nor his inclinations led
him to engage directly or persistently
in any specific educational activity.
But in his educational treatises, the
most important of which was De pueris
instituendis (On a liberal education for
children), he advocated active teach¬
ing methods based on children's emo¬
tional reactions and their intellectual
curiosity. In this method, dialogue
between teacher and pupil and
absolute respect for the freedom and
natural inclinations of the Individual
child constituted a complete break
with the "old-style" education based
on mechanical repetition of abstruse
formulas and fear of corporal punish¬
ment.
Erasmus proposed to the school¬
masters of his time and to the young
people for whom he wrote most of his
pedagogical treatises and works of
rhetoric a study plan (ratio studiorum)
in which the cultivation of the mind
was inseparable from a moral and
religious education.
But whatever reading material he
recommended to students whether
from pagan Greek or Roman antiquity,
the Gospel and the Church Fathers, or,
for those who were older and more
advanced, Hebrew and the Old Testa¬
ment his aim was to develop an open
mind devoid of dogmatism. He made
a selection of works from among the
best writers and proposed them for
study, but taught that subservience to
the ideas and style of any single writer
of the past, be it Cicero himself, was
always to be condemned.
He tried to inculcate this critical
spirit in his teachings, warning of the
dangers both of choosing one's
authors haphazardly and without pur¬
pose and of blindly imitating their
writings which can lead only to sterility
of the mind. His work, Ciceronianus
(On the best style) demonstrates not
only the keen and sarcastic wit he
excelled in but to what lengths of folly
the blind glorification of a man, a book
or a civilization can actually lead.
It is here that we find the originality
of Erasmus's humanism as an educator
and his universality as a man: a
humanism directly linked to his overall
conception of man in the world. When
he proclaims in a phrase that is central
to his thinking, "man is not born man,
but learns to be so", he is saying that
thanks to the educational process
which is embodied in the teacher who
teaches and the student who parti¬
cipates actively in this teaching ani¬
mal nature becomes human nature.
No other humanist has carried the
very conception of culture to such a
high degree of practical effectiveness
as has Erasmus, because to him the
"humanities" or to use an exact
translation of the Latin expression,
these "letters of humanity" which
make man more "human" are not
intended as mere ornaments of the
mind. It is in the community, in the
Church,, in Government that this
culture should find its proper use
because "Man does not live for him¬
self alone". "Nature," writes Erasmus,
"is a great power but reason is a
greater one."
We must not forget that he believed
human reason to have been created
by God as an integral part of His great
design, and that the contradictions
within the Erasmian concept of nature
sometimes good, sometimes inclin¬
ed towards evil, more often indifferent
are resolved in the philosophical
and theological dialectics on nature,
the main lines of which are given in
his treatise, De libero arbitrio (On free
will), published in 1524.
Several objections might be advanc¬
ed against the contention that Eras¬
mus's educational methods are either
modern or universally applicable
today. One in particular concerns the
use of Latin the only language the
Dutch humanist deemed worthy to be
taught or written (with the possible
exception of Greek, although Greek, to
be sure, was never seriously consid¬
ered as a universal language).
Latin was in fact understood and
spoken only by a very small minority
of his contemporaries those who
were socially and economically privi¬
leged by birth. And was it not for the
children of the richer classes that
Erasmus recommended the ideal
method of home tutoring and highly
individualized teaching?
When he spoke of a "liberal" educ¬
ation for children an expression he
played upon and exploited constantly
did he not actually have in mind the
education of Christian princes or the
sons of the aristocracy or of the upper
middle class? Who spoke Latin out¬
side the Universities, the chancelleries,
the law courts or the Church? Who
could read Erasmus in the original
and who for that matter can do so
today? Very few people, indeed, even
though in many countries today the
study of Latin is not confined to the
privileged rich.
I would reply that to this
objection every age and every civiliza¬
tion generates its own special form of
universality. The Renaissance and Eur¬
opean humanism had theirs. The most
effective arm at its disposal against
the contradictory movements of polit¬
ical nationalism and religious sectar¬
ianism wast the rediscovered culture
of antiquity, and the schoolmaster or
university professor was the natural
wielder of this arm.
The correspondence of the great
humanists of the time, the most emi¬
nent of whom was Erasmus with his
thousands of letters addressed to
correspondents all over Europe, reveals
to us the importance of this "third
force" culture, which stood between
the two great powers struggling in the
Middle Ages to shape and control that
European segment of the world errone¬
ously believed at the time to represent
all mankind.
Latin, whose universality and cultural
importance are seriously questioned
today for reasons that are perhaps
justified by the social, political and
economic conditions of our modern
world, was, at the time of the Renais¬
sance, and even later, an instrument
for the transmission of knowledge and
faith, at least in their Roman and
Catholic forms of expression.
In the 18th century, Rivarol could
hold forth about the "universality of
the French language", a universality
that the 19th century and the first years
of the present century seemed hardly
to contest. Today, the problem of
culture is posed in different terms,

## [Page 9](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/058738engo.pdf#page=9) 0

### 58737: Erasmus, universal thinker of yesterday for today

and a national language often seems
to a people to be one of the most
effective means to assert or defend
its political rights, rights that a more
universal language, practised more
widely throughout the world, would
have a tendency to stifle.
Erasmus wrote, spoke and taught in
Latin. But he also hoped that the
ordinary people like the weaver and
farmer would come to know his trans¬
lation of the New Testament. But this
was obviously only possible through
the medium of a vernacular language
and not Latin.
As to his most celebrated book, In
Praise of Folly, with which he is rather
too readily identified in the public
mind, it was translated into French and
Czech immediately after its publication
In Latin, and since its appearance four
and a half centuries ago it has been
translated into many European and
non-European languages and has
continued to be a source of inspira¬
tion and enlightenment for men and
women everywhere.
Today with the widespread changes
marking modern societies in which we
are increasingly challenging the notion
of culture limited only to certain social
classes or privileged groups, it is com¬
forting to know that the poorest
student in Zagreb or Ankara, Riga or
Jerusalem can now afford a copy of In
Praise of Folly in paperback form and
in his own language.
Surely it is a sign of the vitality
and true universality of our time that
Asian languages such as Japanese
and Malay, or more recently, Hebrew,
are contributing to the widespread
circulation of a work that is so far
removed in spirit and historical back¬
ground from Japanese, Malaysian or
Jewish culture.
The same remark might be made
about the writings which constitute the
bulk of Erasmus's work: his books on
the spiritual and theological problems
of Christianity, his translations of and
commentaries on the Bible and the
Church Fathers.
One cannot deny that until very
recently, and perhaps even today,
Erasmus's interpretations of the New
Testament along with his biting sati¬
rical writings on monastic life and the
not infrequent scandals and abuses
within the Church, gave rise to totally
erroneous and biased conclusions and
made him the unwitting target of
attack particularly on the part of un¬
critical minds, or else made him
appear to be the standard-bearer of
religious sects or groups which he
CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE
ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW ERA. Above, in "Epitaph for the Burgomaster
of Nordhausen, " (a work destroyed during the Second World War), Lucas Cranach
the Younger assembled some of the outstanding figures of the 16th century
humanistic and religious renovation that presaged the Reformation. Among
them are Philip Melanchthon, the German theologian and reformer
(far right); Erasmus (fourth from right); and Martin Luther, leader of the Reformation
in Germany (left foreground). Already before 1530 the chasm was opening
between Luther and Erasmus. Although they had once appeared to have
much in common, their ways now parted and they became irreconcilable enemies.
FROM UTOPIA TO THE SCAFFOLD. During his first visit to England
(1499-1500) Erasmus met Thomas More, lawyer, wit and scholar, who was to
become one of his closest friends, and in whose house he later wrote,
within a matter of days, his witty satire "In Praise of Folly" (1509). Thomas More
too -was the author of a famous satirical work, "Utopia", a commentary
on government and society in an ¡deal state. After enjoying royal favour and
being made Lord Chancellor of England, Thomas More was beheaded in
1535 on the orders of King Henry VIII, for refusing to abjure the
authority of the Pope. The drawing below of Sir Thomas More and his family,
. was made by Holbein in 1529 at the request of More's daughter, Margaret
Roper who presented the work to Erasmus. Thomas More, wearing a chain
of office, is seated in the centre, and his daughter Margaret at far right.

EMBLEM FOR
A HUMANIST
Above, a wood engraving
made about 1533, in
which Holbein depicts
Erasmus with one hand
placed on the head of the
Roman god Terminius.
Erasmus chose as his
emblem this guardian
of boundary stones,
and associated with him
the watchword:
"Think always on death".
In 1520, Erasmus
ordered a silver seal
bearing the image
of Terminius.
He himself made a
little drawing of Terminius

friends' request was
carved on his
tombstone in Basel.
would certainly never have approved
of during his lifetime.
In fact, if these works are read with
no other passion than the love of truth
and within their historical framework,
the reader, be he Christian or non-
Christian (and my remarks are parti¬
cularly addressed to the non-Chris¬
tian reader), will be struck by the
depth and sincerity of his faith, his
fidelity to ancient Church tradition, his
unflagging devotion to the teachings of
Christ, but also by the feeling of
individual responsibility which he
sought to instil in all the Christ¬
ian adepts for whom he had written
his manual of piety (the Echiridion,
referred to earlier). The Greek title of
this work which has the double mean¬
ing of "handbook" as well as "hand
weapon" was certainly chosen by
Erasmus to convey the idea that here
was a portable weapon to protect man
against all temptations.
Ever since his early childhood, Eras¬
mus was steeped in the tradition of
"modern devotion" which was a meta¬
physical synthesis of the wisdom and
science of pagan antiquity and the
teachings of the Gospels, and which
was inspired by the mystical convic¬
tion that there was no separation
between spiritual and physical man.
Erasmus gathered together in this
major work the best of the teachings
of St. Paul which he had also directly
received from his friend Colet at
Oxford and from the Franciscan monk,
Jean Vitrier, whom he often visited at
Saint Omer, in France, and greatly
admired.
It would be a mistake to conclude
from a reading of the twenty-two rules
of this Manual or the treatises on
pure theology that followed it that his
conception of Christianity was mainly
ethical and that the Church hierarchy
or the taking of the sacraments matter¬
ed little to him. But what I particu¬
larly wish to stress within the context
I am writing about, which is to show
the universal scope of his Catholicism
(the words universal and Catholicism
are both synonymous and quite dis¬
tinct), is the absence of dogmatism in
his theological concepts. This is indi¬
rectly demonstrated by the bitter war
of opposition waged against him by an
army of theologians from Louvain,
Paris, Toledo and elsewhere.
Even in the metaphysical debate
about human nature and divine grace
and in his theological quarrel with Lu¬
ther about free will, he never abandon¬
ed his watch-tower regard for the
human person, reaffirming his resolve
to stand halfway between the two
concepts: God is all, man is nothing;
and Man's freedom can conquer
everything.
This "middle course" brought him
the fierce hostility of both camps, at
a moment when the Scholasticism of
Lutherans and Catholics had reached
its most dangerously heated pitch.
But for Erasmus, who considered
charity second only to faith itself as
the foundation stone of Christianity,
and the exercise and promotion of
charity as the chief duty of a Chris¬
tian on earth, the incomprehension of
the Scholastics was of little import
or rather, he could answer their
attacks with an acid pen not always
imbued with Christian charity!
"The basis of our religion," he wrote
in a famous letter to the Archbishop
of Palermo, Jean Carondelet, "is peace
and concord." He wanted such peace
and concord to prevail not only
amongst Christians but between Chris¬
tians and Turks. And he often contrast¬
ed the humane behaviour of the latter
with the outright barbarism shown by
the former in slaughtering each other,
and the hypocritical pretexts under
which they mounted crusades against
the Infidels.
For Erasmus, warrior of the spirit
and fighter for peace, all forms of bar¬
barism and intolerance that set man
and nations against one another were
equally reprehensible and horrible.
In the recent words of Pierre Gros-
claude, he was the forerunner of a
"United Europe" and he would cer¬
tainly have been an ardent advocate
of the reconciliation, if not the fusion,
of all the Churches of Christianity.
The racial and nationalistic fanati¬
cism current today would have shock¬
ed and horrified him. Of this there
can be no doubt. In his writings, he
made this clear again and again in
countless texts, the most famous of
which are The Complaint of Peace
and the adage Dulce Bellum (War is
sweet to those who have not known
it).
In his deeply rooted pacificism he

Despite his frail appearance,
Erasmus was a tireless worker and
a seasoned traveller, accustomed
to long journeys on horseback
in all weathers. He incidently showed
special concern for conditions
conducive to hygiene in an
age when these counted for little.
Here, Holbein has drawn in travelling
attire the man who "wished to be
a citizen of the world, at the service
of all, but allied to none",
as Erasmus himself put it.

### 58737: Erasmus, universal thinker of yesterday for today

ERASMUS (Continued)
'War is sweet to those who have not known it'
was prompted by many motivations,
chiefly due to his nature which made
him recoil both physically and men¬
tally from all forms of violence and
brutality.
His personal situation and his natio¬
nal background also help to explain
this attitude, for he was the political
adviser to Charles the Fifth, beholden
to Francis I of France, enemy of the
warrior Pope Julius II, though opposed
to Louis XII and to the French conquest
of Italy.
But if we examine the arguments
against violence which he himself put
forward with so much forcefulness
and clarity that his sincerity can hardly
be placed in doubt, we find that they
fall into three categories in increas¬
ing order of importance. 1) Nature is
opposed to the terrible slaughters
between men which are without par¬
allel even amongst the most ferocious
of wild beasts. 2) Common sense and
cold calculation of the advantages to
be gained should prevail on any chief
of state who is contemplating war to
change his mind, since there can be
neither victor nor vanquished in a
world of ruins. 3) The teachings of
religion are in direct opposition to war
and all the evils which it brings with it.
While he often appealed to the
Ancients, particularly to Plato, the
decisive argument for him was the fla¬
grant contradiction between God's
Commandments and the precepts of
the Gospel on the one hand, and, on
the other, the behaviour of Princes
who are Christian in name only. And
it is to one such "Most Christian"
Prince, Francis I, that Erasmus address
ed a long exhortation on behalf of
peace in the preface to his Paraphrase
of Saint Mark, published in Basel In
1523:
"...Of all the ills that destroy the life
of man, the most odious and the most
harmful is war. Does it not strike the
most dreadful blow at morality and at
intelligence as well as at men's lives . . .
When it will be necessary to come
before Christ's tribunal, this judge, as
severe towards the meek and the
humble as he is towards the great,
will not demand less strict accounts
from the most powerful Princes of this
world. That is why those who believe
that they do but little harm when they
pillage, destroy, exile, burn, crush and
kill the meek and the humble, call into
question the wisdom of Christ who
shed his precious blood for all who
are enslaved..."
Let me quote, In closing, the pero¬
ration of the sad Complaint of Peace,
dating from 1516, that is to say a
period when a reconciliation between
Charles of Burgundy and Francis I
seemed possible and the spectre of
war seemed to be fading. Who among
us, in this time of the Viet Nam War,
of the Israeli-Arab conflict, of ideolo¬
gical tyrannies, of recent colonialist
oppressions, of racial violence, of
revolutionary or pseudo-revolutionary
movements, of the menace of the
atomic bomb, but also of the Ency¬
clical Pacem in terris and the Inter¬
national Red Cross, does not feel him¬
self to be directly and personally
concerned by these words of the Wise
Man of Rotterdam?
"The majority of the people hate
war and desire peace. A minority,
whose wretched good fortune always
depends on the misery of the people,
wants war: must their inhumanity out¬
weigh the will of so many good
people? If we look at the past, we
will see that never until now has any¬
thing lasting been achieved by treaties
or by family bonds, by force or by
acts of vengeance: there is no surer
refuge against danger than gentle
benevolence. Wars lead to other wars;
revenge provokes revenge; indulgence
generates indulgence; benevolence
calls forth benevolence; and the
highest esteem will be reserved for
those who give up something of their
rights. That which man attains is not
always the result of human effort; but
human undertakings carried out under
the auspices and in the spirit of Christ
will, thanks to his wisdom, flourish. He
will protect and give assistance to
those who favour peace, to those who
will sacrifice most to the common
good, in the knowledge that by this
sacrifice they contribute to their own
felicity.
"Princes will reign with true majesty,
when they govern a happy and vir¬
tuous people, ruling by laws rather
than by arms. Noblemen will be more
worthy; priests will enjoy more quietly
their moments of leisure; the people
will profit from greater tranquillity and
more peaceful abundance."
Doubtless, the tone and the spirit
of this passage do not resemble those
of the Abbé Saint-Pierre or of Kant
in their projects for eternal peace, nor
those of certain modern fighters for
peace. But the man whose constant
Folly speaks: "...To your
health, cheers, live and
drink, O most celebrated
devotees of Folly."
"...in the same way that
Atlas supports the
heavens on his shoulders,
according to the poets."

thoughts and daily activities incite
him to make "war on war" will find
fraternal echoes in reading Erasmus:
pursuing his personal labours In the
specific circumstances of his histor¬
ical time and place, making use of the
means given to him by his own genius,
Erasmus achieved that tangible univer¬
sality which allows for an amicable
exchange of contradictory ideas and
convictions without loss of the diverse
identities which they express.
What we men and people whose
expansion, diversity, behaviour pat¬
terns and perspectives for the future
he could not foresee can learn from
Erasmus, at a distance of five hundred
years, is not that we should try to
achieve an impossible fusion of huma¬
nism and Christianity considered as
absolute and timeless values, but
rather that we should follow the
example of open-mindedness and free¬
dom of thought which characterize his
educational, political and religious
thinking, so as to fashion a humanism
within our own needs and our own
new possibilities in a universe whose
centre of gravity has been displaced,
but whose cohesion is as indis¬
pensable today as it was yesterday.
"The world has its own order,"
wrote Erasmus, "and we should do
well not to disrupt it." This thought
has lost nothing of its pertinence or
Its universality today, like that of
Fichte, another universal thinker, who
declared: "The unique aim of human
existence on earth lies neither in
Heaven nor in Hell, but only In carry¬
ing to Its highest perfection the huma¬
nity which we bear within us." g

ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE... FOR FOLLY
In 1509, Erasmus left Italy and set out for
England. It was while riding through the
Alpine passes, he recounts, that he
conceived the idea for In Praise of Folly,
the satirical masterpiece exposing the
foibles and follies of Man, which became
his most famous, controversial and "mo¬
dern" work. Hans Holbein was only
18 when he made a series of pen draw¬
ings in the margins of a copy of the
original edition. He did so to amuse
Erasmus, but the drawings became fam¬
ous and have since illustrated numerous
editions of the work. Right, Holbein's
drawing for the commentaries of Folly
on the teachers of that time and the sad
plight of their students: "They beat the
little wretches with rods, straps, or a
punishing stick..." Above, a drawing by
Holbein for Erasmus's Adagia, published
at Basel in 1515. With Solomon (top

of antiquity.

### 188339: Mongolia

This year a mission of the United Nations
Development Programme, composed of specialists
from the U.N. and its Specialized Agencies, including
Unesco, went to the Mongolian People's Republic to
discuss with the authorities the expansion of a pro¬
gramme for technological, scientific, educational and
social development. We present below an article on
Mongolia today written specially for the "Unesco
Courier" by two of these specialists. (See page 20

gramme projects now under way).

L,YING in the very heart of
Asia between the Gobi Desert and Lake
Baikal, Mongolia has always seemed a
remote and mysterious land. Even to¬
day most people know little about the
country, its inhabitants and its way of
life.
Few are aware, for instance, that In
size, the Mongolian People's Republic
exceeds the combined areas of France,
Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, and
that its population numbers only one
and a quarter million less than one
person per square kilometre.
Mongolia's wide open spaces remind
one of the old Wild West frontier
country of the United States and the
vast plains of Soviet Kazakhstan.
Among other similarities, the man on
horseback herding cattle ¡s a familiar
sight, and, like Kazakhstan and the
western United States, Mongolia
abounds in mineral resources: coal,
oil, gold, precious and semi-precious
stones and other subsoil riches.
Like the south-western region of the
United States, Mongolia is semi-arid;
but here the parallel ends, since Mon¬
golia is perhaps unique in having a
largely sunny climate with extremely

low temperatures. Minus 35 degrees
Centigrade in winter with sun is not
uncommon and summer temperatures
often rise well above 40 degrees.
Almost everyone, to be sure, has
heard of that famous Mongolian of an¬
cient times, Genghis Khan, and his
hardy followers who swept into China,
Turkestan and southern Russia, and
many people still think of today's Mon¬
golians as a nomadic people placidly
tending their herds. But too few have
heard about the enormous strides Mon¬
golia has taken in industrialization, co¬
operative farming and education. To¬
day, the "land of the nomads" is very
much on the move, and at a pace that
is rapidly transforming the whole struc¬
ture of its economy and social life.
It takes a hardy people to survive
the sharp daily as well as seasonal
variations of temperatures in a climate
such as Mongolia's. The Mongolians
are people to match the climate and
the country. They are a tough breed,
cheerful, hospitable and Industrious.
As horsemen they are outstanding.
Horse racing is Mongolia's national
sport, and even boys 5-12 years old
take part In races that try boy and
beast over 40 kilometres of terrain at
breakneck speeds. When they grow
up, they are thus completely at home
in the saddle. This kinship of man and
horse served the Mongolians well
during the centuries that this once lar¬
gely nomadic people moved with their
flocks of, sheep, cattle, goats and
horses over the vast steppe to find
pasture.
This nomadic existence demanded a
mobile home that would protect the
Mongolian against his exceptionally
variable climate. He found it in his now
traditional Yurta, an igloo-shaped tent,
about 20 feet in diameter, with a trun¬
cated conical roof, out of which rises
the all-important stove pipe, and a door
which is always placed facing south.
Its construction is a marvel of
ingenuity and practicality. Heavy felt
is stretched over a wooden frame
resembling a rose trellis. The entire
structure, trellis, felt and door, Is easily
transported and can be assembled or
taken down in a matter of 30 minutes.
It was the Yurta and the amazing
Mongolian horses that gave Genghis
Khan his mobility and striking power
seven centuries ago.
Like many people whose life de¬
pends largely on the weather, the Mon
golians are prone to talk about it. Each
time they meet, it is customary for
them to spend ten or fifteen minutes
discussing the last rain, its effect upon
the pasture and consequently on the
herds. Cut off from the rain-bearing
winds of the Pacific by its high moun¬
tains, Mongolia has little rain or snow;
its annual average fall of rain and snow
is about 300 mm.
Each season has its greeting and
conversational style related to the
rains of summer, the winds of winter,
the hunting season in autumn and the
beauty of spring. Through all these
conversations runs a common theme:
the effects of the weather on the herds.
To a degree without parallel any¬
where else In the world the Mongolian
economy is dependent upon animals.
Mongolia has 23 million head of cattle
over 20 per head of population. The
Arats, as herdsmen are called, depend
almost entirely on animal products for
their livelihood. Before the fairly recent
introduction of agricultural co-opera¬
tives, there were more than 200,000 no¬
madic families, usually living at a bare
subsistence level off their herds.
Under a feudal system which existed
In Mongolia until 1921, land was held

Centuries of nomadic
life have made the
Mongolians extraordinary
horsemen, who delight
in racing across the
steppes astride fleet Tatar
horses (above). Children

they are old enough
to sit in the saddle (left).

by princes as hereditary property and
the nomad was expected to pay a form
of pasture tax. Needless to say, the
best pasture was reserved for the
herds of the princes, leaving only the
poorer pasture for nomadic families. At
the same time, Lamaism, one form of
Buddhism, was firmly established In
Mongolia as the official religion. By
the beginning of the twentieth century
Mongolia had over 700 monasteries and
100,000 Lamas. Taxation by the
princes and the demands of the Lamas
were heavy burdens for the impoverish¬
ed nomad families,.
Very few Mongolians chose to be
come farmers , because to do so
would have made them serfs to
one of the feudal princes. So the
majority preferred to wander over
the vast steppes with their families,
Yurtas and herds, somehow surviving
under the crushing burden of taxation.
Only in fairly recent times have
farms existed or has animal husbandry
in the modern sense been practised
in Mongolia. The revolution of 1921
deposed the princes and Lamas and
opened up the land to the people.
Since then, freed of excessive taxation,
the Arat has been able to settle the
land.
This has brought a striking transfor¬
mation. From a nation with practically
no farmers and complete dependence
on imports of grain in 1921, Mongolia
today is self-sufficient in food grains
and produces a surplus of wheat.
Much of the credit for this new self-
sufficiency must go to the state farms
and to the cattle raising co-operatives.
More than 60 per cent of Mongolia's
entire manpower is engaged in agricul¬
ture, the main branch of the country's
national economy. Agriculture repre¬
sents about 60 per cent of Mongolia's
Gross National Product and over
80 per cent of its exports. Since

STEPPE TO THE
20TH CENTURY
Mongolia's agriculture is being rapidly modernized through state farms and
nearly 300 co-operative associations, and agriculture accounts for 60 per
cent of the nation's manpower. Yet 260,000 persons or one fifth of the total
population is today concentrated in Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator (above).
The city possesses a large university (4,000 students), colleges and
technical schools, theatre and libraries. Industry, non-existent 50 years ago,
today provides 40 per cent of Mongolia's Gross National Product.

MONGOLIA (Continued from page 17)
Not the backward country of geography books
agriculture will continue to play a
major economic rôle for many years
to come, attention is being focussed
on the improvement of livestock
through better breeding, the pro¬
vision of modern cattle shelters in
winter and the expansion of fodder
production. To help meet the shortage
of farm workers, the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization has started training
programmes at three centres (see
below).
The nomadic way of life has been
replaced by large co-operative asso¬
ciations of many families. These co¬
operatives are an unusual combination
of private ownership and communal
effort. Each member can hold in
private ownership a specified number
of animals. In the average co-opera¬
tive private holdings amount to about
18 per cent.
In 1967 there were 281 co-operatives
for animal husbandry, with an average
of 500 families in each. The co-opera¬
tives vary in size, but most are nearly
300,000 hectares (750,000 acres) in
area, and have between 50 and 70
thousand head of livestock. The dev¬
elopment of co-operatives has made
possible increased productivity of the
herds, better breeding practices and
less exposure for the Individual Arat to
the dangers of nomadic life.
State farms, the equivalent of the
stock raising co-operatives, have in¬
creased tremendously in Mongolia. In
1940 there were only 10 state farms;
today they number 31, with an
average size of about 100,000 hectares
(250,000 acres). But because of
mechanization they employ fewer
families. Ploughing, seeding and har¬
vesting are completely mechanized and
hence require fewer workers. Haymak¬
ing, for example, which normally invol¬
ves much hand labour, is 97 per cent
mechanized on Mongolia's state farms.
Because of Mongolia's sparse pop¬
ulation mechanization of agriculture is
an absolute necessity. The scarcity of
people combined with rapid industrial¬
ization has created a problem which is
probably unique in Asia; more people
are needed to keep Mongolia's
economic boom going.
Living conditions on the co-operat¬
ives and state farms are a vast improve¬
ment on those of the former nomad
families. The housing, medical care,
cultural facilities and social life avail¬
able on the co-operatives and the state
farms, are advantages practically un¬
known to the nomad family.
Small wonder that less than 6 per
cent of Mongolia's agricultural produc¬
tion comes from farmers who have not
yet begun to participate in co-opera¬
tives or states farms. Co-operative
work is a long-standing Mongolian trad¬
ition, expressed by the old saying,
"A great many hands are better than
one giant."
While agriculture is the mainstay of
its economy it would be wrong to think
of Mongolia as only an agrarian state.
About 40 per cent of Mongolia's Gross
National Product comes from industry.
Mongolia's rich natural resources and
agricultural raw materials have made
possible extensive mining and the de¬
velopment of manufacturing industries.
Coal Is the most important mining In¬
dustry (2.5 million tons in 1967) and
oil, iron ore, non-ferrous and rare
metals, construction materials and salt
are also mined. Light industry and food
processing are expanding and employ
about 40 per cent of all industrial work¬
ers. Electric power production has

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has
undertaken a series of projects, financed by its Special Fund,
to contribute to economic and social development in the Mon¬
golian People's Republic. Unesco and other U.N. Special¬
ized Agencies are participating in these projects, which include:
TRAINING ENGINEERS Set up and now operating
under the supervision of Unesco experts, a Polytechnic
Institute was inaugurated in 1968 to train engineers for Mon¬
golia's fast-growing industries. Nearly 1,000 students are
enrolled in its six faculties. Under a Unesco fellowship scheme,
students studying abroad will return as teachers to replace
Unesco instructors. Under a broad plan for educational
expansion, the Polytechnic Institute will give greater emphasis
to research programmes.
TRAINING TECHNICIANS In June 1969, the International
Labour Organization inaugurated a four-year training programme
covering teaching techniques, on-the-job training in factories,
electrical technology, woodworking, refrigeration techniques,
fitting and machine shop operations, mine equipment main¬
tenance, well-drilling, geological drilling, and gem-cutting and
polishing.
HYDROLOGICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES
World Meteorological Organization experts have advised the
Mongolian Government in the setting up of hydrometeorological
stations, and have selected appropriate sites for new hydro-
logical and agrological stations. A network of radio stations
is being built, and a fellowship programme for study abroad
has been organized.
TOP PRIORITY TO LEATHER INDUSTRY Courses and
opportunities for vocational training in animal husbandry have
been developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Training began this year at three centres, each with its own
programme dealing with different climates and types of animal
husbandry.
Specialists sent by the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization have surveyed Mongolia's leather industry. The
government has now given top priority to a proposal to be
examined by the UNDP Governing Council in January 1970
to create a research centre for leather and the leather goods
industry so as to improve production and quality with a view
to increasing exports.
Other projects under consideration include the establishment
of a national computer centre; development of the livestock
and dairy industry, which accounts for half of Mongolia's
Gross National Product, a pilot project to develop vaccine
against Brucellosis, a cattle disease that seriously threatens
Mongolia's livestock, and the creation of a centre for applied
research and experiments for the food processing industry.

by industry and transport.
Just as the co-operatives and state
farms have transformed the lives of
people in the countryside, so indus¬
trialization has changed the life of the
city dweller. Ulan Bator, the capital
(260,000 peopleone fifth of Mongo¬
lia's population), began its industrializa¬
tion process in 1934 with Soviet aid.
(Indeed, much of Mongolia's industrial
equipment thus far has come from
technical aid supplied by the U.S.S.R.)
Since then the city's industrial com¬
plex has grown to include a shoe fac¬
tory, processing plants for food and
hides, a prefabricated building mater¬
ials factory and other industries. In
spite of Mongolia's high percentage of
urban growth (42 per cent of its popu¬
lation live in towns and cities), the
shortage of workers has called for a
high degree of mechanization, and the
use of automation is now being studied.
Ulan Bator's hide processing plant, for
example, is over 70 per cent mechan¬
ized and hand work has been kept to
an absolute minimum.
Ulan Bator, with its impressive mod¬
ern buildings, hotels, theatres, mu¬
seums and its industrial complex, now
has a fast-growing rival in the city of
Darkhan, located 250 kilometres to the
north.
Darkhan is a modern city whose
industrial development will eventually
equal that of Ulan Bator, and whose
present population of 25,000 will rise to
near 200,000. Detailed plans showing
how Darkhan will develop are already
displayed in the Mayor's office.
At the current rate of expansion
Darkhan should reach its full growth
within the next two decades. Thanks
to farsighted planning and imaginative
architectural designs, Darkhan will be¬
come one of Asia's most modern cities.
In the middle of the city an imposing
cultural centre will be built, housing a
theatre and sports facilities. Darkhan
will be well provided with commercial
and administrative buildings and shops,
and around this nucleus, blocks of
apartments, with ample green spaces,
will form the residential areas of
greater Darkhan.
Although Darkhan is still In its in¬
fancy (it was pastureland six years
ago), it already boasts an impressive
industrial complex. Located in its
industrial sector, well separated from
the residential areas, are brick making
and cement works, a prefabricated
building materials factory, a grain elev¬
ator and the largest heating and
power plant In Mongolia. Under con¬
struction is a large hide processing
plant. Like Ulan Bator, Darkhan sees
no limit to its development.
To the visitor from abroad, and most
are misinformed about Mongolia, it
comes as a surprise to see the level of
industrial development at Ulan Bator
and Darkhan, and the degree of me¬
chanization on the state farms and co¬
operatives. Nor does the visitor expect
to find "creaseless" shirts in the shops
of Ulan Bator and Darkhan, to be able
to attend a concert, go to a circus or
listen of jazz. He is prepared for none
of this by what he has read in geo¬
graphy books.
Mongolia is* moving into the modern
age at a rapid pace. Schools filled
with students and the Govern¬
ment's readiness to provide a good
education are positive guarantees for
the future. Mongolia has one univer¬
sity and five colleges, a new polytech¬
nic institute (see p. 20), 19 technical
schools and nearly 500 secondary
schools. It has a school and college
enrolment of 207,000; 9,500 students
attend the university and colleges. In
addition to its Academy of Sciences,
Mongolia has research institutes, labor¬
atories and many public libraries.
At the University of Mongolia, which
has over 4,000 students, on seeing
37 geology graduates receive their
diplomas, one Is stirred by the know¬
ledge that they have a vast and un¬
tapped virgin territory in which to prac¬
tise their new skills and knowledge.

NEW LIGHT
ON THE
EMERGENCE OF CIVILIZATION
IN THE NEAR EAST
Excavations over several years in
the Iranian province of Khuzestan,
bordering on Iraq, have brought to
light the remains of Chogha Mish,
a city more than 5.000 years old.
On this site archaeologists have
found hundreds of clay seal
impressions showing innumerable
animals and scenes from daily life.

Revelations of the 5,000 year old
city of Chogha Mish, Iran
by Helene J. Kantor
and Pinhas P. Delougaz
D,lURING the course of the
current century our historical horizons
have widened immensely. No longer
are the Classical and the Biblical
worlds the primary centres of human¬
istic quest. For all their superb
achievements both have been recog¬
nized as relatively late phases in a
long cultural development in the Near
East, where modern Near Eastern and
Western civilizations have their roots.
Of cardinal importance for the un¬
derstanding of this development are
the earliest manifestations of high
civilization such as the appearance of
complex political states, elaborate
representational art, and above all, of
writing. All the available evidence in¬
dicates that writing was first invented
around the middle of the fourth mil¬
lennium' B.C. in southern Mesopo¬
tamia. Consequently, the period in
Mesopotamian history during which
this and the other fundamental traits
of high civilization first appear has
been named the Protoliterate period.
Archaeological remains dating to
this period have been excavated at a
few sites in southern Iraq, but there
they often occur deep below the sur¬
face and are hard to reach. To fur¬
ther our understanding of this crucial
phase in human development and of
how it came into being it is important
to extend our information beyond the
few individual sites in Mesopotamia.
Among the areas outside Mesopotamia
proper where solutions to numerous
problems connected with the rise of
civilization may be forthcoming the
most promising is Khuzestan, the pro¬
vince of Iran adjacent to southern
Iraq.
In Khuzestan the large mound of
Chogha Mish, silhouetted against the
Zagros Mountains rimming the north¬
ern edge of the Susiana plain bet¬
ween the Ab-i-Dez and Karun rivers,
had many shards of the Protoliterate

excavations.
The ancient skill of butter-making has solved one of the mysteries
of the pictographic writing invented in Mesopotamia some 6,000 years
ago. Until the unearthing of the clay seal design (above) showing
a woman churning butter, no explanation could be given for the
Sumerian pictographic sign GA (left) which means milk. It is now clear
that it showed the shape of the double-necked butter churn. Below,

period on the surface when first exam¬
ined. This fact, in addition to its
strategic location and size, decided
us to investigate it in the autumn of
1961. Three seasons of excavations
(1961-1966) under the auspices of the
Oriental Institute of the University of
Chicago have proven Chogha Mish to
have been indeed a city of the Proto¬
literate period, dating to about the
34th century B.C.
Old as that city was, it was far
from being the beginning of the story
of settlement at Chogha Mish. For
many centuries, even millennia, peo¬
ple had inhabited the very same spot.
Early cultures came and went, each
one leaving its own mark in distinctive
forms of attractive pottery
The earliest stage, one not known
in the area before we discovered it at
Chogha Mish, dated to around the
sixth millennium B.C. It is character¬
ized by a highly burnished pottery
frequently painted with designs sur¬
prisingly elaborate for that remote age.
The pottery of subsequent phases
is decorated with characteristically
closely spaced geometric patterns,
providing the basis for development in
later prehistoric stages when the
repertory is considerably enlarged,
notably with representational designs.
The latest prehistoric stage is well
documented by many examples of pot¬
tery types known from the discoveries
made at Susa many years ago.
During several of the prehistoric
phases the settlement at Chogha Mish
was remarkably large, spreading over
some forty acres. The population
practised agriculture, as indicated by

EMERGENCE OF CIVILIZATION (Continued)

such tools as sickle flints, hoes, and
grinding stones. The finds, especially
the pottery of certain phases, show
similarities to those made in southern
Mesopotamia. However, the people
at Chogha Mish, though not isolated,
possessed their own indigenous cul¬
ture, typically Iranian and linked with
that of south-eastern Iran (plains of
Persepolis and Pasargadae).
Quite different from the earlier cul¬
tures is the Protoliterate civilization
brought by the people who settled on
top of the accumulated ruins of the
prehistoric towns. This civilization is
identical with that of contemporary
lower Mesopotamia. Chogha Mish
thus provides firm evidence that the
Susiana plain was an integral part of
the Protoliterate civilization, not merely
a recipient of some of its cultural
traits.
The work of the three seasons
brought to light various quarters of
the extensive city, from foundations on
the high "acropolis" to the street
drains and walls of the private house
areas on the lower part of the mound.
Although only a small part of the site
could be excavated so far, we have
already gained some insight into the
busy life once led by its citizens.
Masses of pottery of many different
sizes and types, from tiny cosmetic
vessels to immovable pithoi (large stor¬
age jars), reflect the preoccupations
of the people and the varied func¬
tions of different quarters of the city.
Glimpses of religious life are provided
by some ritual objects. For instance,
a pottery vase bears at each
of its twinned spouts representations
in relief of a large snake biting the
throat of a goat (opposite, top of
page), a motive suggesting a conflict
between chthonic (underworld) forces
and the domestic flocks so import¬
ant for human subsistence. Another
ritual vase Is incised all around with
geometric designs and represent¬
ations of paired lions, entwined
snakes, and a man. carrying a large
fish.
Among the numerous and diversi¬
fied finds of the Protoliterate period
perhaps the most significant class, the
one contributing more than any other
to the better understanding of the
Protoliterate period, is that of the
ancient clay cylinder seal impressions,
made by rolling cylinder seals over
soft clay.
These impressions vary from nearly
complete ones on large, conical seal-
ings or on hollow balls to minute frag¬
ments recovered by sifting the exca¬
vation debris. Others are on flattish
"tags", presumably attached by a
cord to packages or bales, and on
tablets with archaic numerals. These
objects are an invaluable source of
information on the economic life of the
time, while their representations con¬
tribute greatly to our knowledge of
Protoliterate art and many other
aspects of the civilization.
T.HE tasks of the preserv¬
ation of these fragments, their attrib¬
ution to individual seals, and the
reconstruction and drawing of the
original designs are among the most
delicate and difficult tasks of our
expedition for they require not only
considerable skill but also a thorough
knowledge of ancient Mesopotamian
art.
The subjects represented on the
hundreds of seal impressions dis¬
covered at Chogha Mish are greatly
varied. They contain animals, hu¬
mans, and monsters engaged in
various activities. Even the simplest
of these designs showing no more than
animals and plants frequently display
the consummate artistic achievement
of Protoliterate glyptic art. Essential
characteristics of animals are render¬
ed with subtle modeling.
Although generally based on visual
reality, the imagination of the artists
was not bound by it. Such unreal
creatures as a double-headed ibex
(photo p. 22) or a lion squatting in
human posture freely mingle with the
world of reality.
Realistically depicted is a very
wide gamut of activities. For exam¬
ple, cattle are guided by men; vessels
of various shapes appear as filling
motives and can be considered those
used by herdsmen and dairymen.
Two tag impressions made by the
same seal show two women. One ¡s
spinning, while the other is rocking a
double-necked churn. The churn pro¬
vides a new link between representa¬
tional art and primitive writing.
The churn's shape is similar to the
pictographic sign GA known to mean
"milk" in Sumerian though the con¬
nexion of that sign with milk remained
incomprehensible until our discovery
of the churning scene (photo p. 23).
Important as these examples of glyp¬
tic are from the point of view of artis¬
tic quality or as documents of contem¬
porary life, they are far surpassed by
others which may justly be considered
among the outstanding earliest docu¬
ments of human achievements of uni¬
versal import.
One example provides the earliest
evidence of music as an organized art
form a musical ensemble which may
be considered an ancestor of the
complex orchestras of later ages
(above left). On several impressions
a large upright harp is clearly recog¬
nizable, with a kneeling musician
behind it.
The entire design of this seal could
be reconstructed from the separate

fragments. Besides the harp and the
harpist, one sees a second person
with his palms outstretched above a
semicircular object; he is beating a
drum. A third musician holds two
horn-shaped objects, which we were
first inclined to interpret as clappers.
However, on one fragment it is quite
clear that the end of one of these
objects reaches to the musician's
mouth and consequently there Is little
doubt that he Is playing a wind in¬
strument, presumably a horn, while
holding another, possibly of a different
pitch.
A fourth person with his hand
against his cheek is in a well-known
attitude of a singer, an attitude which
was commonly shown in much later
Egyptian art and is still practised today
in the Near East. In short, we have
here a representation of an "orches¬
tra" with string, percussion, and wind
instruments, accompanied by or ac¬
companying a singer.
The "orchestra" is only part of the
total scene. The musicians, save for
the drummer, face a man on the right
who is comfortably seated on a
cushion'with an attendant offering him
drink, while food and drink are placed
also on a table in front of him. The
scene represents a banquet complete
with music. Such banquets undoubt¬
edly had religious connotations and
this representation is, moreover, a Pro¬
toliterate antecedent of a well-known
theme of later Mesopotamian art,
which occurs, for example, in glyptic
and relief in the Early Dynastic period
(early third millennium B.C.).
A major class of glyptic at Chogha
Mish has military activities as its sub¬
ject matter. Sealings showing con¬
flict on the battlefield have parallels
from other sites. One impression is
noteworthy for a large figure of an
archer with his equipment rendered in
detail. So far unparalleled at other
Terracotta vessel with twin spouts, discovered at Chogha Mish,
is decorated with a large snake biting a goat by the throat.
The meaning of the decoration is not certain, but it has been
associated with ancient religious rituals.
sites is a scene which shows a group
of men marching in close formation,
suggesting a well-trained and disci¬
plined army unit. Another design,
unfortunately incomplete, seems to
represent a large number of bows,
possibly the contents of an armoury.
A unique representation, which
occurred on a clay ball, depicts a per¬
sonnage well-known on Protoliterate
monuments and variously referred to
as ruler, king, or priest. Here he
appears in a hitherto unknown situa¬
tion; he is seated in a boat, returning
triumphantly from a military expedition.
This is made explicit by his weapon, a
mace, in one hand and the rope with
which two prisoners are tied in front
of him in the other (opposite, top
right).
This ruler is accompanied by a num
ber of attendants, one of whom, at
the stern of the boat, holds an emblem
or standard in the form of a crescent.
The ruler's seat is not an ordinary
stool or throne, but a bull. This and
the standard in the form of a heaven¬
ly body lend religious overtones to the
triumphant return.
Another sealing belonging to the
category of military activities is of
major historical importance. Its de¬
sign has been reconstructed from
several impressions on one clay ball.
It depicts the climax of the siege of
a fortified city with towers at various
levels (drawing below left). On some
of the towers persons, probably
women, lean forward with their hands
raised above their heads in the
universal gesture of despair and

Goats figure largely in the pottery designs
used by the artists of ancient Iran. Vase
(right) decorated with painted ibexes (wild
goats) was unearthed from the site of the
city of Chogha Mish, dating from 3 400 B.C.,
in south-western Iran. As seen on this
vessel and in drawings below, from other
parts of Iran, artists often depicted goats
in stylized forms.

MAN & BEAST
on the ancient
pottery of Iran
A,INCIENT Persian pottery displays a whole pantheon of
animal and human figures. On these pages we present a few of these
motifs, in various forms and designs, unearthed from the sites of ancient
cities in the western part of present-day Iran. They come from Bakun
(south), Susa and Chogha Mish (south-west), Musyan and Giyan
(west), Siyalk (centre), and Hissar (north). "Pottery, and especially
painted pottery, constitutes the principal artistic activity of the village
communities of ancient Iran," writes Professor Louis Vanden Berghe,
of the University of Ghent (Belgium), in a special issue devoted to
the archaeology of Iran in the international quarterly "Archaeologia
Viva" (Vol I, No I, 1968). "No other civilization has produced so many
local styles and schools, with such a wealth of decorative motifs."
The Golden Age of Iranian pottery (4500 - 3000 B.C.) is distinguished
by its expressive animal forms, abstract shapes and lines and finely
balanced designs. The ancient artists painted, impressed or engraved
into their vessels animal forms of every kind. Most often shown are
the untamed creatures of nature, ibex and wild sheep, lions, panthers
and leopards. Bulls and horses appear on many objects. These animals,
wild and domestic, were probably considered symbols and adjuncts
of gods. Originally, vessels were moulded by hand, but a decisive
step forward was made with the invention of the potter's wheel, now
known to have been used in Iran before 3500 B.C. After being burnished
and decorated, pottery was fired in the open air or in a brick kiln, in
which temperatures could reach as high as 1,000 degrees Centigrade.
Drawings, taken from "Archaeologia Viva', were ori¬
ginally published in works by Prof. Louis Vanden
Berghe (Belgium), Prof. Donald E. McCown (U.S.A.),
and Prof. Roman Ghlrshman (France). All documents

surrender. In front of the city two
large figures, the conquerors, appear
to be dispatching the vanquished.
Here, amazingly, is the earliest artis¬
tic expression of that climactic and
poignant moment in warfare, the mo¬
ment of victory ana1 subjugation at the
end of a. siege which was to become
a central motive for pictorial as well
as literary art in later ages. One may
recall the siege scenes of Egyptian
temple walls of the fourteenth and
thirteenth centuries B.C. and those of
Assyrian palaces of the eighth and
seventh centuries B.C., as well as the
passage of the "Iliad" where the Tro¬
jan women bewail the approaching fall
of their city as they watch from the
walls the body of Hector dragged be¬
hind the chariot of Achilles.
While the orchestra and banquet
scene enlarges our horizons with
regard to the cultural achievements
of the Protoliterate period, apparently
within a religious setting, our newly
discovered representations of military
exploits provide new insight into the
political power structure of the Proto¬
literate period.
The complexity and variety of the
military scenes place them in a differ¬
ent order than mere spontaneous
local conflicts. Expeditions by water
and sieges are by nature planned and
organized military undertakings im¬
plying centralized leadership. More¬
over, the siege scene directly attests
not only to a more complicated aspect
of warfare than a conflict on an open
battlefield, but also to the existence of
fortified cities, centres of military
power.
The siege scene leads us to a signi¬
ficant problem of the Protoliterate
period, namely the relative levels of
attainment within and without the orbit
of Protoliterate civilization. Since na¬
turally the siege would have been
engraved by the winning party, one of
two assumptions follows: either there
were already within the same cultural
area rival city states early in the Pro¬
toliterate period or else the popula¬
tions outside the Protoliterate orbit
were in their own way sufficiently
advanced to build fortified towns
which the carriers of the Protoliterate
civilization would attack and sometimes
conquer.
At present there is not enough evi¬
dence for choosing one of these altern¬
atives as the correct one. We hope
that the forthcoming seasons of excav¬
ation at Chogha Mish will cast still
more light on this and many other
aspects of the Protoliterate period,
which was Indeed one of the crucial
stages in the cultural history of
mankind.


### 58740: Men die earlier than women; considerations of a Soviet demographer

Considerations
of a Soviet
demographer
by Boris Urlanis
BORIS URLANIS is one of the Soviet
Union's leading demographers and statis¬
ticians. Professor of demography at the
Institute of Economics, U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences, he has written many books
and studies, and in particular on the
theory of statistics and on the relationship
between war and the population of Europe.
His latest book, "War and Population" , is
shortly to be published in English, French
and Spanish by Progress Publishers,
Moscow.
OMEN are generally re¬
garded as being the "weaker sex",
and in terms of physical strength this
is true. But demography has shown
us that In 'reality it is men who are
the weaker sex.
This weakness is apparent right
from birth. Soviet demographers
have noted, for example, that of the
2,175,000 boys born in the U.S.S.R.
in 1966, 63,000 (29 out of every 1,000)
died during their first year. Of the
2,066,000 girls born the same year,

### 58740: Men die earlier than women; considerations of a Soviet demographer

MEN DIE EARLIER
THAN WOMEN
48,000 (23 out of every 1,000) died
within a year. The difference, as we
see, Is considerable.
Yet the early development of baby
boys differs very little from that of
baby girls, and boys are not the
victims of maternal neglect since
mothers lavish affection on all their
children, regardless of sex.
This being the case, what is the
real reason for the higher death rate
among baby boys? The obvious
explanation would seem to be that
girls are constitutionally stronger than
boys, thanks to the greater biological
resistance of the female organism, a
resistance which has developed over
a period of hundreds of thousands
of years. Nature seems to have
recognized that the lives of women
are more important for the survival
of the human race than those of men.
Without disputing the findings of the
biologist, let us see what we can
learn from the studies of the demo¬
grapher. How do the death rates of
men compare with those of women?
In 1968, the U.S.S.R. Central
Statistical Office published mortality
figures for the Soviet Union classified
by sex and age. These showed that
the death rate of male teen-agers
(15 to 19 age group) Is twice as high
as that of female teen-agers. This
"mortality gap" widens In the higher
age groups. The death rate of men
aged between 25 and 29 is two and
a half times that of women in the same
age group. Thereafter the death rate
for men twice as high as for women
remains constant until extreme old age.
There Is no simple biological
explanation for this "mortality gap",
but there are other causes which we
can identify and study.
A,IS far back as 360 years
ago it was known that six per cent
more boys were born than girls.
Unfortunately, this preponderance of
male births, which might have ensured
the numerical equality of the sexes,
rapidly vanishes during the years of
infancy, childhood and adolescence.
Both sexes are about numerically
equal in the 20 to 24 age group, after
which women begin to move into the
lead, and the difference increases with
age. According to the latest U.S.S.R.
census, women In the 20 to 24 age
group outnumbered men by 230,000,
and in the 25 to 29 age group by
350,000. This difference grows stead¬
ily and rapidly in the older age groups.
But supposing things were different.
It is easy to imagine the tremendous
benefits that would be enjoyed in every
sphere of life if there were as many
adult men as women.
Let us first look at the economic
advantages. Each person can be
considered as a sort of "accumulator"
of resources such as food, upbringing
and education which are provided by
the family and the community. It Is
not difficult to calculate the total of
these "Investments" since we know
the costs of bringing up children and
teen-agers.
Having reckoned up all the money
spent on a person until he begins to
work, one Is tempted to think of him as
"capital" and everything he produces
throughout his working life as the
return on this capital. But as we all
know, a man's life cannot be expressed
in terms of money. Man himself is
not a "capital"; he creates capital by
leaving behind him the fruits material
and spiritual of his life's work.
Since it is during the most pro¬
ductive period of a man's working life
that his death rate rises to two and
a half times that of a woman, it is
easy to imagine the economic loss
suffered by the community.
The higher death rate among men
is also responsible for much disruption
of family life. The death of a husband
creates a terrible gap. If a mother Is
left to bring up her children alone, the
life of everyone in the family suffers.
The life of a widow Is generally
difficult. Her chances of re-marrying
and bringing into the family a step¬
father for her children are slight.
Statistics show that there are many
widows, but few widowers. A man,
however, very often remarries fairly
soon after losing his wife.
Remarriage for a woman in the
U.S.S.R. is difficult for several reasons,
the main one being the dispro¬
portionately lower number of men.
And it is particularly so for women who
are no longer young and have children
to look after. "Men do everything
they can to make sure that there
won't be enough of them to go round,"

### 58740: Men die earlier than women; considerations of a Soviet demographer

MEN DIE EARLIER (Continued)
Five exceptions in the world :
Cambodia, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, Upper Volta
The shortage of men, due to their
higher death rate, has distressing
repercussions on many aspects of life.
It explains why there are hundreds of
thousands of "broken" families and
why countless women are deprived of
the benefits of a normal family life.
One might think of war as the
decisive factor in the high rate of male
mortality, but this is not the case.
Almost all men at present under the
age of 42 In the U.S.S.R. took no part
in the Second World War. Moreover,
the male death rate for the age group
30 to 40 exceeds the female .death
rate by a greater percentage than that
of other age groups. The cause,
therefore, is not war and all its
consequences, but the fact that we
pay considerably less attention to
preserving the health of men than that
of women.
What can be done to "equal the
chances" of longevity? Firstly, we
can see to it that everyone clearly
understands the risks they run through
the abuse of alcohol and tobacco or
the use of drugs. Alcoholism and
drug addiction cause serious losses
to society and the economy, sow
dissension in the home and increase
the number of divorces. Men in
particular are victims of alcoholism,
which undermines their health and
causes many cases of alcohol
poisoning, cirrhosis of the liver and
heart disorders.
s,IMOKING is also a harm¬
ful habit. Yet the consumption of
tobacco is increasing rapidly, espe¬
cially among adolescents. Men gener¬
ally are heavier smokers than women,
and the sale of cigarettes has risen
during the last few years to the point
where an average of almost one
packet per man smoker or not is
smoked every day. Undoubtedly this
increase in smoking is multiplying the
number of deaths caused by lung can¬
cer and other illnesses due to the
consumption of tobacco. A full-scale
campaign against smoking should be
launched without delay. But to be
effective, it will need to do far more
than merely lecture people on "the
harmful effects of tobacco."
In the Soviet Union, the average life
expectancy is 66 for men and 74 for
women. However, throughout the
world the average life span varies
greatly from country to country,
particularly for men. Studies on
longevity based on statistics from
75 countries show that in only five of
them is the average life span greater
for men than women. Four of these
are Asian countries India, Pakistan,
Cambodia and Ceylon and the fifth
is Upper Volta in Africa.
In the remaining 70 countries women
have a greater life span than men.
The extent of this difference is shown
in the following table:
Women live
longer than men

Each year, millions of new vehicles
pour out of the world's automobile and
truck factories. In North America
alone, sales of automobiles will top
the 10 million mark in 1969.
Road accidents, as we know, are
responsible for a high proportion of
all deaths due to accidental causes,
and it is also a fact that most of the
world's road vehicles are driven by
men.
Greater emphasis on safety in car
design steering columns that collapse
on impact, safety belts as standard
fittings, rear head supports, etc.
would help to safeguard millions of
men against the threat of sudden and
premature death during the most active
and productive period of their lives.
In this article I have wished to draw
attention to the problem of lengthening
the life span of men. One often reads
books and articles in which it is said
that people can and should live to
be 100, 120 and even 150. There are
of courses cases of people living to
such a ripe old age, but they are
exceptions to the rule.
So when certain authors proclaim
that man's life span can be almost
doubled, they are really only "building
castles in the air," or inventing their
own fantasies. I make no comment
about science fiction elucubrations
that man will one day live forever.
To return from these fantasies to
the sad realities of the world, one
must realize that the problem of
lengthening man's life span really boils
down to shortening the gap between
the life span of men and women. Of
course, this does not stop us from also
working for a long life span for
everybody, including a longer life span
for women.
But we should face the fact that in
the more developed countries we have
gone almost as far as we can in this
domain with our present knowledge
and techniques.
By saying that the life span of men
and women should be the same, I in
no way wish to diminish the importance
of women. Women, who often carry
the double burden of working all day
and running a home as well, deserve
our admiration, as do men who work
long hours and have many community
and family obligations. Nevertheless,
from the demographical point of view,
men remain "the weaker sex".

### 188340: Three-dimensional history class in Hungary

THREE-DIMENSIONAL
HISTORY CLASS IN HÜNGARY
Above, students at a girls' secondary school in Debrecen (Hungary)
put the finishing touch to a model of the Acropolis. Below left, the
Leaning Tower of Pisa. Below right, visitors examine the temple of
Der El Bahri (Thebes, Egypt) built exactly to scale. The models
stimulate student interest in history and different culture« far more
effectively than textbook illustrations or film slides.
Photo story by Paul Almasy
A pioneer experiment in the use of three-
dimensional visual materials in teaching is being
carried out in a secondary school in Hungary.
John Porcsalmy, a history teacher at the
"Csokonai" girls school in Debrecen, has
created a school museum made up of models
of all types of architecture such as dwelling
places, religious buildings, archaeological sites
and public buildings and monuments, represen¬
tative of various parts of the world and different
periods of civilization. What makes this "school
museum" particularly original is the fact that
it is the pupils themselves, with the help of a
few craftsmen, who make the models. Made
chiefly of wood, plaster and cardboard, the
models range from prehistoric monuments such
as the standing stones of Carnac (France) and
the Cromlech of Stonehenge (U.K.) to the
Egyptian pyramids at Gizeh and the Byzantine
church at Novgorod (U.S.S.R.), and include a
number of Hungary's own monuments. The
school museum has also assembled a collection
of reproductions of ancient clothes, tools and
other objects, copied by students from originals
loaned by museums. According to Mr Porc¬
salmy, a far greater interest is aroused among
students by these models than by the pictures
in text books and the showing of slides. Other
schools in Hungary, inspired by Debrecen's
example, are adopting the same techniques.

### 188339: Mongolia

32
MONGOLIA (Continued from page 21)
Mongolia today is largely a geological
"terra incognita", but if the determina¬
tion of these young men is any Indica¬
tion, it will not be one much longer.
Near Ulan Bator is the Nalaikha
training centre where future technicians
are learning skills that will help make
Mongolia an Industrial country. Here,
young people apply themselves to their
tasks with fervour and enthusiasm,
conscious that they stand on the
threshold of great changes. Just as
Darkhan, symbol of this new frontier
of development, was raised where
nothing stood before, so the students
at Nalaikha are building on virgin soil,
acquiring skills which no one before
them in Mongolia has ever learned.
Each stage of development has Its
own reward. Mongolia's present satis¬
faction comes from making something
new creating a city on the desert¬
ed steppe, as at Darkhan, or discov¬
ering the mineral resources that lie
beneath the soil.
No description of Mongolia would
be complete without some mention of
its striking beauty and its stillness
and tranquillity qualities that are be¬
coming rare In our modern world.
From the vast reaches of the Gobi
desert, to the gentle hills and jagged
mountains of the north, Mongolia is a
land of stillness and beauty. On the
road from Ulan Bator to Darkhan the
fields abound with wild iris as blue as
the Mongolian sky. The odour of new
grass warmed by the spring sun is
like a rare perfume.
Hills and mountains reach as far as
the eye can see, with each succeeding
wave in this great land ocean a differ¬
ent colour. The near hills are freshly
green, the next are tinged with yellow,
and the farthest ones, blue-grey, finally
merge into the delicate purple hue of
the almost invisible mountains. In a
matter of days one becomes detached
from the cares of life and feels a sense
of space and freedom.
All terms of reference about Asia
have to be discarded when consider¬
ing Mongolia. Mongolia is not the
backward country of our childhood
geography books nor is it a teeming
Asian country with the "golden hordes"
so often described by the historian.
It ¡s a vast "frontier land", a modern
nation with enormous potential for
expansion thanks to its abundant natur¬
al resources. And the Mongolian
people, its most valuable resource, are
eager to accept the challenge.

Our global 'greenhouse'
If man continues to generate power at
the present increasing rate, there is a
danger that he will overheat the earth.
This warning is voiced by two Soviet
scientists in the Unesco quarterly Impact
of Science on Society (Vol. XIX, No. 2).
"If power generated increases annually by
10 per cent, in 100 years it... will have an
effect comparable to that of solar radia¬
tion," they state. In another article, a
U.S. scientist says that the burning of
fossil fuels has caused the carbon dioxide
content of the earth's atmosphere to rise
by 15 per cent in the 20th century alone,
creating a "greenhouse effect' that pre¬
vents heat from escaping out to space.

International institute
for literacy techniques
The International Institute for Adult
Literacy Methods, set up in Teheran by
Unesco and the Government of Iran to
provide scientific support for the world's
literacy campaigns, is now in operation.
In the first phase of its activities, it will
develop an extensive documentation and
information service on literacy methods
and materials. In the second phase it
will initiate a broad research programme
on literacy problems (motivation, integra¬
tion of vocational training and literacy,
the rôle of mass media, etc.), and later
it will organize seminars and special
training courses on the methods, media,
materials and techniques of functional
literacy for senior staff of literacy pro¬
grammes.
S.O.S. for Venice
Unesco's Executive Board has renewed
its urgent appeal to member states for
help in safeguarding Venice, after study¬
ing a report by the International Consul¬
tative Committee on Venice (set up by
the Italian Government and Unesco).
The international committee, which met
for the first time last July, emphasized
that the situation in Venice is worsening,
due to fluctuations in the tidal waters
of the lagoon and increasing industrial
pollution. Unesco is preparing to draw
up, in co-operation with the Italian Govern¬
ment, a general plan for the protection
of Venice by November 1970. It is also
helping to compile a complete inventory
of the city's monuments and works of
art, and is drawing up a list of prior¬
ity projects which public and private
organizations could help to carry out.
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
Prize for literacy 1969
This year's Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
Prize for outstanding work in adult liter¬
acy has been awarded to the Cambodian
National Technical Committee for Literacy.
The $5,000 prize, donated by the Shah
of Iran, went to the Cambodian committee
for "impressive efforts and remarkable
results" in a campaign to promote adult
literacy and ensure participation in nation¬
al development, involving a million pupils
taught by volunteers, including Buddhist
monks, soldiers, civil servants and stu¬
dents. The prize was presented at a
ceremony at Unesco's Paris headquarters
on September 8, to mark the third Inter¬
national Literacy Day. Commendations
were awarded to Pastor Charles T. Hein,
a member of the Togolese National Liter¬
acy Committee and to seven institutions:
Summer Institute of Linguistics, Australia;
Bombay Social Education Committee, India;
Bambara Technical Commission, Mali; Ne¬

AIESEC (Association Internationale des
Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et
Commerciales), a non-profit international
association in Geneva, administered by
students, which annually assigns some
5,000 students from 350 universities to
work-training jobs. At the conference,
businessmen, educators, government offi¬

'More than Fair'
"More than Fair", a new television film
produced by Unesco, is a visual document,
with behind-the-scenes glances around the
globe, in which the camera seeks to
illustrate the many problems inherent in
the status of women in the world today.
It underlines the increasing participation
of women in the professions and their
growing responsibilities in economy, poli¬
tics, science and culture, and makes the
point that it is not so much "equality" as
"equity" that is the key to woman's normal
place in society. "More than Fair" is avail¬
able in 16 mm English, French, Russian
and Spanish language versions. For fur¬

Letters to the Editor
'YOUTH 1969'
Sir,
As the spokesman of four young peo¬
ple, aged 18 to 23, may I compliment
you on your scrupulously objective
study of the problems of youth
(April 1969). It shows a real aware¬
ness of these problems and a sense
of urgency that cannot fail to impress
all who read the issue. Thank you for
a stimulating and thoughtful thematic
presentation of the ferment of today's
youth, free from the prejudices that so
often obscure the real issues.
Alain Vincent
Arcueil, France
Sir,
I read with extreme interest your spe¬
cial issue, "Youth 1969". The publica¬
tion effectively opened for careful consi¬
deration the multiple problems and
aspects which must be taken into
account in assessing the need to im¬
prove and revise our social institutions.
I commend you on a perceptive over¬
view of a world-wide issue of profound
importance.
Art Shartsis

Future of Higher Education

Sir,
I found your issue on Youth
most stimulating. As a student affected
by university reforms now taking place
in Switzerland (through a national refer¬
endum and detailed studies of univer¬
sity organization). I was particularly
struck by Marcel Hicter's study. In fact
I have chosen passages from his article
for publication in a student magazine at
the Federal Polytechnical School in Lau¬
sanne. I hope its challenging ideas will
be a new incentive to students who still
remain indiffèrent to these problems.

SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT
OF WORLD'S FISH STOCKS
Sir,
We were very interested in your
January 1969 issue (Can We Keep Our
Planet Habitable?), since the great
majority of the world's fish catch
(50 million tons annually) comes from
natural stocks of sea fish. The conser¬
vation and rational management of
these stocks, and the scientific research
necessary to achieve this, lie at the
heart of much of the work of FAO's
Department of Fisheries.
We would therefore like to point
out errors of fact and concept appear¬
ing in some of the contributions. Thus,
it is not now true whatever the situa¬
tion a decade ago that "whales are
disappearing at a catastrophic rate from
their last refuge, the Antarctic ocean."
The right whales have been protected
for half a century, are increasing, and
have returned to New Zealand waters.
The blue whale, the largest of all living
animals, has been protected in the
Antarctic, and throughout the world, for
several years.
Only for the smaller sei whale are
present catches greater than the ability
of the population to replace itself. The
consequent decline in sei whale stock
cannot be described as catastrophic
and is, if not continued for long, prob¬
ably desirable since the stock is still
large, and any rational exploitation of
such a natural resource demands an
initial moderate decrease in its abun¬
dance.
The fact that in many areas stocks
of fish are being reduced may in itself
not be an indication of over fishing,
but simply a sign that these resources
are now being more fully used in feed¬
ing mankind as is also shown by the
fact that the world fish catch has been
increasing for two decades at some
seven per cent per year. This growth
rate is considerably higher than the
growth of human population, or of pro¬
duction of other major foods.
Unfortunately, it is true that some
fish stocks are being, or have been, too
heavily fished, but active steps are
being taken towards managing most of
these, as a matter of enlightened self
interest by the fishing nations con¬
cerned. Thus the control of the Peru¬
vian anchovy fishery, the world's
biggest single fishery which produces
up to 10 million tons of fish per year,
is not carried out to preserve the
ecological balance for the benefit of
guano production, but done with the
full support, and for the benefit, of
the fish meal industry, in an effort to
ensure that the stock is maintained in
a condition to yield high sustained
catches in future years.
In other cases, groups of countries
are, through specialized regional com¬
missions, several of which are sponsor¬
ed by FAO, seeking, with considerable
success, to strengthen international
measures of fishery regulation. In this
process, a great deal of co-operative
research is carried out on the biology
and dynamics of the resources and on
their environment to provide the requi¬
site basis of fundamental scientific
knowledge.

CRUCIAL QUESTION
Sir,
"We, the peoples of the United Na¬
tions, determined to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war . . .
and to reaffirm faith in fundamental hu¬
man rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person, in the equal rights
of men and women and of nations ilarge
and small ..." So begins the introduc¬
tion to the Charter of the United Nations,
which 127 "peaceful" countries have
ratified.
Today tens of thousands of men,
women and children die of starvation
and undernourishment. Today millions
of human beings see and suffer the
immediate results of the lunacy of war
and violence. Today hundreds of mil
lions of men and women are in bondage
to tyranny and dictatorship. Today
much of mankind lives in a hell on earth,
far removed from the blessings of civi¬
lization, and far away from that heaven
on earth which politicians used to speak
about in 'lyrical terms.
I am young and maybe a bit naïve,
but I know that everybody wants to live
in peace and friendship with his neigh¬
bours. May 1 ask if politicians and
world leaders are joking when they
speak about "saving succeeding genera¬
tions from the scourge of war", and
ratify conventions on human rights?
We, the peoples of the world, want an
answer and we want to see some posi¬
tive results. We are not joking.
Kjell-Arne Johansson
Munkaljungby, Sweden
EVERYONE'S BUSINESS
Sir,
In an otherwise excellent issue on the
protection of nature (January 1969) it is
a pity no reference was made to young
people who are increasingly aware of
the need to safeguard nature, but who
often lack encouragement to do their
part. It would also have been worthwhile
to remind others young and not - so
young who have completely forgotten
what the word Nature signifies, of the
basic principles that govern proper res¬
pect for nature. Possibly you could
do this in a future issue, especially since
1970 has been named International Year
for Nature Conservation by the Council
of Europe.
André Lapp
Strasbourg, France
PROBLEMS OF OUR TIME
Sir,
Reading the "Unesco Courier" during
the past year has given me a better
grasp of today's scientific and cultural
problems. Among many outstanding
issues, I would smqle out "Abuse of
Drugs" (May 1969) and especially
revealing "Human Rights . . . Tomor¬
row" (November 1968). I think many
people would be interested to read more
about the "population explosion", which
has become the subject of world-wide
studies.
R. Gabaidullin
Karaganda, U.S.S.R.
WHO HAS INFLUENCED
US MOST ?
Sir,
Truly, the "Unesco Courier" is a win¬
dow on the world. It points the way
and is a gold-mine of knowledge, for
which I thank you. May I suggest that
everyone who writes a letter to the editor
should add a P.S., giving the name of
the person he or she considers has
most influenced man's way of thinking
founders of religions excepted. My
choice is Charles Darwin.

ERASMUS
universal thinker
of yesterday for today
This small medallion of Erasmus (10 cm. in diameter) is the
work of the great Hans Holbein, portraitist and religious painter
of the German Renaissance. Painted in 1532, when Erasmus was
over 60, it was one of the many portraits of him executed by
Holbein who from his youth had enjoyed the friendship of the
great Dutch humanist. Today, five centuries after the birth of
Erasmus, the modern world can still look to him for guidance in
matters of tolerance, moderation, and a true spirit of universal¬
ity (see article page 4).
