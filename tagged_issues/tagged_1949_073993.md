SUM SUGGESTED FOR 2 YEARS IS FIRST WINTER-
NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR UNDER-DEVELOPED
AREAS. UNESCO SHARE ESTIMATED AT $16, 855, 500
A plan to use more than $85, 000, 000
in two years for technical assis-
tance to under-developed countries
has been outlined in a report
issued by the United Nations at Lake
Success on June 2.
The plan is the United Nations're-
sponse to President Truman's call for a
"bold new programme"to make the
benefits of scientific advances and indus-
trial progress available for the improve-
ment and growth of under-developed
areas.
The 328-page report, issued by Secretary-
General Trygve Lie, is. the cho-operative
product of the Secretariats of the United
Nations and. eight Specialized Agencies,
and is now being submitted by the
Secretary-General to the Economic and
Social Council and by the heads of the
Specialized Agencies to their respective
governing bodies.
[As this issue of the Unesco CourIer
goes to press, the Executive Board off'
Unesco is in full session in Paris to
cons'der the technical aid programme and
the proposals for Unesco's participation
during the co) 7ttnsr years, j-
The estimated cost of the technical
assistance described in the programme is
$35. 862, 576 for the first year and
$50, 079. 807 for the second ear. These
figures are in addition to what govern-
ments of recipient countries are expected
to pay as their part of the cost of the
technical assistance that they receive.
Unesco's share √ç : 1 the programme has
been estimated at $6, 150, 000 for the first
year and $10, 705, 500 for the second year.
The proposed cost of the first two year

In addition, the International Bank for

envisage asking for special funds.
Local Participation
-HE purpose of the programme, theU, N. report states, is to assist
under-developed countries to achieve
for themselves the material and social
benefits of sound, balanced economic
development. Realization of this pro-
gramme will require full use of the
scientific and technical advances which
have already so changed the economics
of more highly developed areas. The
report warns, however, that patterns of
economic development which fit the
economic and social structure of the
technically more advanced countries
cannot be applied without modification
to those which have remained under-
developed.
Furthermore, In every country develop-
ment must be brought about mainly
through the efforts of the local popula-
tion, with the help of domestic resources,
and by means of appropriate changes in
economic and social structure. If economic
development is to achieve its purpose of
increasing the security and welfare of
the great mass of mankind, its benefits
must be widety distributed.
The report notes that the rate of
economic development must be fast
enough not only to keep up with popular
tion growth, but to exceed it by a
substantial margin. The amount of
scientific and technical knowledge avail-
able for this task is constantly increas-
ing. The problem immediately at hand is
to organize this knowledge and direct it
into the channels where it can produce
the speediest and most constructive
results.
The report goes on to say that. while,
in the past, private initiative and capital
have in most countries been the principal
agents for economic development, today
an increased responsibility rests on gov-
ernments of, countries seeking rapid de-
velopment. For each country the first
step in economic development must be a
realistic appraisal of its special condition
and needs.
Nature of the Programme
THE report states that the increasedrole of government initiative and
direction in economic development
suggests that the provisions of large-
scale technical help will usually involve
some sort of inter-governmental arrange-
ments. These arrangements will be either
on a bilateral basis or through interna-
tional organizations.
The report adds that a sound internal-
tional programme must make use of the
experience of many nations with different
social patterns and cultural traditions
and at differeat stages of development.
It lists a certain number of basic requisites
for success of the technical assistance
programme as follows :

For Technical Development

. 1. A practical approach-development
in each country must grow out of that
country's particular needs, desires, and
potentialities.
. 2. Personnel-an adequate supply of
qualified experts.
. 3. Supplies and equipment-adequate
amounts of both.
. 4. Continuity-expanded technical as-
sistance programmes are essentially long-
term undertakings, and need concerted
efforts for many years.
. 5. A favourable environment-under-
developed countries must be willing them-
selves to take vigorous action to establish
the internal condition upon which sound
development depends. The report insists
on this responsibility of, recipient coun-
tries, and adds that obsolete systems of
land tenure as well as traditional methods
of agriculture may have to be modified.
The report recalls that in a resolution
adopted at its Third Session, the General
Assembly of the United Nations laid
down that technical assistance furnished
shall not be a means of foreign eco-
nomic and political interference in the
internal affairs of the country concerned
aad shall not be accompanied by any
consideration of a political nature.
Fields of Work
A balanced programme of economic
Development, according to the
report, can best be achieved on
the basis of a comprehensive develop-
ment plan, but in many countries eco-
nomic development may, at the outset,
have to be limited to a few activities.
U. N. E. S. C. O.
SINCE, it is recognize that increasedeconomic development lends momen-
tum to increased educational opportunity,
Unesco proposes to site technical assis-
tance in the fields which its experience
has already shown under-developed coun-

Help for war-devastated and under-
developed areas. Here, locomotives are

All under-developed countries wish to
expand and diversify their industrial
activities. The adoption of more up-to-
date industrial methods will increase the
output of goods and promote higher
standards of living. Improved agriculture
is essential to produce increased quan-
tities of food, raw materials for industry
and products for export. Transport and
communications must be bettered to
promote the mobility of labour and the
availability of goods, Basic education and
technical training must be coupled with
the development of labour practices suit-
able for a more compJex economy. And
the maintenance of adequate health con-
ditions is essential to progress in any
son ; 1d economic development scheme. In
all these fields technical assistance is an
essential forerunner to economic develop-
ment.
Forms of Technical Aid
THE report describes the wide varietyof forms technical assistance for
economic development may take,
such as : technical advisory services ;
practical demonstrations or modern
techniques ; provision of improved oppor-
tunities for training within the under-
developed countries or abroad ; dissemina-
tion of information.
The report recommends that the ad-
ministrative committee on co-ordination-
composed of the U. N. Secretary-General
and the Executive Heads of the Specializ-
ed Agencies-establish a central clearance
point called the Technical Assistance
Committee (TAC). to be made up of a
representative of each of the organiza-
tions. Organizations would submit their
part of the total programme to their
own governing bodies in the usual way,
for appropriation of funds. Governments
seeking advice or technical assistance
could approach either individual organiza-
tions, or the Secretary of the TAC, who
would turn over the request to the ap-
propriate organization.
In connection with the financing of the
expanded co-operative programme, the
Secretary-General and the Executive
Air Force for Health. In its anti-
malaria drive, WHO uses planes for
spraying unh'atthy swamps to rid
them of disease carrying mosquitoes.
A Co-operative Project
Heads of all the interested Specialized
Agencies agreed that each Specialized
Agency, which considered it necessary,
would establish a special budget for tech-
nical aid for economic development and
would invite its member governments to
make contributions to thi$ budget over
and above their contributions to its nor-
mal budget.
1M"HE second part of the 328-page re-port describes in detail the kinds
of technical assistance which the
United Nations and Specialized Agencies
can make available. From these descrip-
tions a vivid idea can be had of the
almost unlimited range of benefits which
can accrue to the world from a well-
co-ordinated programme of technical as-
sistance, given the. steady and enlightened
co-operation of the advanced countries,
the recipient countries and. the interna-
tional agencies in a sustained effort over
a long period of time.
United Nations
THE U. N. proposes to focus its pom.gramme on fields of activity which
are not, or not yet. assigned to any
Specialized Agency. These include activ-
ities related to manufacturing and ex-
tractive industries, control and utilization
of water resources, inland road, rail and
water transport, as well as certain sectors
of the social field such as housing and
community planning.
An illustration of the tyoe of activity
envisaged is provided by industrial
research in tropical and semi-tropical
countries where there appears to be

the use of new raw materials existing in
these areas for making textile products,

THE kinds of aid which the Interna-tional Labour Organization : 1 proposes
to provide cover the relation of economic
development policies to labour income
and employment, including specifically
such problems as training, migration,
industrial safety, social security and

problems of the indigenous populations
of Latin-America.
F. A. O.
THE Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion proposes to provide aid in the
fields of agriculture, forestry and forest
products, nutrition and food management,
tries are likely to require. These fields
are : education (elementary, adult aid
technical) ; production and use of mate-
rials for education, including mass com-
munication materials ; the technical needs
of the press, radio and film ; training of
teachers and other specialized personnel ;
planning and organizing of scientific
research and training laboratories ; and
protection of national cultures.
Among the many projects being con-
sidered by Unesco is one which recom-
mends the establishment of scientific
laboratories to conduct technical research
on available natural resources, as well
as to use such laboratories as training
centres to educate local personnel in
modern scientific methods.

THE World Health Organization hasdrawn up a programme of work
relating to health demonstration areas,
malaria, maternal and child health, en-
vironmental sanitation, mental health,
venereal diseases, tuberculosis, ublic
health administration, nutrition, cholera.
and other diseases, technical training of
medical personnel, research on anti-
biotics, medical literature, and teaching
equipment. 
11 HE great task of raising the standardof living of the under-developed
countries of the world is a responsi-
bility to which the United Nations and
the Specialized Agencies have already
applied themselves within the limitations
of the resources so far placed at their
disposal for the purpose. What has been
achieved so far has been useful, but falls
far short of the need.
On March 4 of this year, the Eco ; comic
and Social Council, on the initiative of
the United States delegate and in pur-
suance of the Fourth Point of President
Truman's inaugural address, adopted a
resolution requesting the Secretary-
General of U. N. to prepare"a comprehen-
sive plan for a : J. expanded co-operative
programme of technical assistance for eco-
nomic development through the United
Nations and its Specialized Agencies,
paying due attention to questions of
social nature which directly condition
economic development", and to set forth
"methods of financing soch a programme
including special budgets", as well as
"ways of co-ordinating the planning and
execution of the programme".
In response to this resolution, Mr.
Trygve Lie at once entered into direct
consultations with the Executive Heads
and Deputy Heads of the I. L. O., F. A. O.,
Uneseo, I. C. A. O., W. H. O.. I. R. O.. the
International Bank. and the Monetary
Fund.
The report issued as a result of these
discussions stresses that progress in eco-
nomic development must be measured in
decades rather than in years, and that
the technical assistance projects described
in the programme are merely a patter : 1
for future action. The programme does
not claim to provide an overnight solution
for the economic problems of under-
developed countries, but is intended to
help those countries to help themselves
in developing their resources and their
productive capacity. Its success, the
report adds, in the long run will dope : 1d
in large measure upon the support given
to it by the under-developed countries
themselves. Throughout the process, the
domestic contribution by countries receiv-
ing technical assistance will have to be
much larger than any external aid they
may be given, and it will be expected
that these countries will create the con-
ditions under which the technical assis-
tance given can be made effective.

### 73994: Experts review UNESCO Programme in Germany, suggest expansion

Experts Review Unesco Programme
',. In Germany ; Suggest Expansion
POLISH REPRESEIVT ATIVE EXPRESSES RESERV ATIOIVS
AST month, while the Big Four Foreign Ministers were meeting
in the Rose Palace in Paris to discuss the political future of
Germany, anoth r meeting was takin  place only a few streets
away on the educational, cultural and scientific future of Germany.
This second meeting brought together for the first time members
of a committee of experts on Germany called by Dr. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco, to review the work already done
by Unesco in Germany and to submit their recommendations con-
cerning Unesco's future activities in Germany.
The committee formulated a series of recommendations which Dr.
Torres Bodet is submitting in a report to the Unesco Executive Bor<t
for consideration at its meeting this month.
unesco's role as
a liaison agency,
supplying both its
Member States and
Germany with in-
formation on the
present possibilities
of a two-way flow
of cultural contacts
and exchanges, was
emphasized by Dr.
Torres Bodet, when
he addressed the
committee at Unes-
co House on May 27.
"By arousing Ger-
man interest in
the United Nat : ons
and its Specializ-
ed Agencies inside
Germany", said
Dr. Torres Bodet,
"Unesco can ma-
terially contribute
to the guidance of
those minds in Ger-
many who are seek-
many where the weekly radio
programme,"Unesco World Re-
view"has been sent to all radio
stations.
In his report to the Executive
Board on Unesco's present work,
Dr. Torres Bodet states that four
Unesco publications, translated
into German,"which appeared
particularly suitable for w : der
distribution in Gocmany"will
shortly be ready for distribution.
These are :"The Constitution of
Unesco,""Unesco, What it is...",
"Message to Youth,"and"Work
Camps for Peace."At the same
time Unesco has extended into
Germany its activities concerning
teaching about the United
Nations.
Unesco's world-wide studies and
plans for improvement of text-
books and teaching materials are
now being expanded to include
Germany, where new text-books
are prog. ressively being published.
An important effect of this work
has been the dissipation of a wide-
spread misapprehension among
the Germans that the text-book
revision programme was aimed
exclusively at Germany. The
Drawing by Gustave Friese. Reprinted
from German publication"Horizont"
realization that Unesco's plan is
intended to assist all countries to
improve their text-books has help-
ed considerably in the work.
Another Unesco activity has
been the introduction of the in-
ternational survey of the op-
portunities that exist for the ex-
change of persons. Copies of the
Unesco pubhcation"Study Abroad"
which lists international fellow-
ships, scholarships and educa-
tional exchange have already been
sent to higher education institu-
tions in Germany.
Germany is also included in the
"Way of Life"series and the study
of tensions which Unesco its car-
rying out in a number of
countries. These studies are in-
tended to throw light on such
problems as the influences which
may, n the one hand, favour
international understanding, or
conversely, foster aggressive na-
tionalism.
German specialists are now
being invited to attend con-
ferences called by Unesco. Several
German school principals came
to Paris in April to attend a meet-
ing of the heads of international
schools and German experts on
adult education will be present at
the International Conference on
Adult Education which opens in
Denmark this month.
These are some of the activities
which have been carried out by
Unesco in 1949.
While recognizing the Im-
portance and value of this work,
the committee felt that the Ger-
mans themselves should be en-
couraged to write and publish
articles in Germany on questions
concerning Unesco's aims and
work.
In addition to recommending
the introduction of Unesco's Book
Coupon Scheme into Germany, it
considered that the book exchange
programme should be broadened
to enable German institutions to
receive free publications.
An important development in
the increasing of book exchanges
between Germany and other
countries took place on May 1
last, when. as reported in the May
issue of the Courier, the first
book exchange centre for western
Reconstruction from zero.

Unesco Helps Restore
Ex-German Libraries
FORMER German libraries inItaly which were damaged
during the war and later closed
down, are now being restored for
the benefit of students and
scholars, thanks to a recent grant
of 5, 000 dollars provided by
Unesco.
This grant will be used by the
International Union of Institutes
of Archaeology, History and His-
tory of Art, to bring the four
libraries-the Biblioteca Hert-
ziana, the ex-German Archaeolo-
gical Insitute Library and the
the former Prussian Historical
Institute, all in Rome and the ex-
German Art-Historical Institute
Library in Florence-into full
use again.
Today. Unesco has given a total
of 13, 000 dollars to help these in-
stitutions'which will eventually
constitute a valuable aid for 
studies of Mediterranean history,
art and archaeology.
Germany was opened at Bad
Godesberg.
Anothoc of the committee's re-
commendations was that the
details of the Goethe anniversary
celebrations planned in many
parts of the world this year, be
made widely known in Germany,
in order to demonstrate the im-
portance the entire world attaches
to the principles associated with
Goethe's name.
Financial support for Unesco's
activities in Germany from Ger-
man sources was also urged by
the committe in view of the fact
that financial assistance for
Unesco projects in its Member
States comes chieflv from 50urees
swithin those countries.
During the general discussion of
the report and recommendations
of the Committee some reserva-
tions were expressed by M. Victor
Meneel. the Polish representative.
He stated that he endorsed those
recommendations which had been
conceived and which would be
applied in accordance with certain
principles.
Among these principles were
the democratic unity of Germany
and unity and agreement among
the four occupying powers as a
condition essential to peace in
Germany and peace of Europe ;
and priority, in Unesco's work for
countries ravaged by Nazi aggres-
sion was a matter which, in the
case of cultural work in Germany,
required financing by the Ger-
mans thenselves.
The final decision concerning
Unesco's future activities in Ger-
many will lie with Unesco's
General Conference, acting on
the proposals of the Executive
Board.
Another meeting of the German
Experts Committee is scheduled
to be held in Paris just prior to
the opening of Unesco's General
Conference in September.

### 73995: Major campaign to cut frontier barriers to education exchange

As\ MAJOR campaign to re-
A'"duce economic obstacles
to the free flow of in-
formation is now being under-
taken by Unesco. The campaign
is directed against quotas, Cus-
tom* ! duties, currency controls
and other restrictions which
to-day impede the passage across
frontiers of educational, scienti-
fic and cultural materials.
Unesco's objective is to enable
the reader in Rome to purchase

seum in Mexico City to obtain a
painting from Paris, the school.
libraries and scientific laborato-
ries of every country to secure
the equipment they need from
abroad, despite the difficult post-
war economic conditions which
hamper international trade.
This attempt to promote intern-
ational trade in the materials of
education, science and culture
embraces many different points
in the Organization's current pro-
gramme. Greater exchange of
these materials through the
channels of trade can assist less
developed countries to fill their
needs. It can, for example, ease
some of the critical shortages of
mass communications equipment
in certain countries, as revealed in
the 1947-1949 Technical Needs
Surveys undertaken by Unesco. It
can also help schools to rebuild
and restock, and war-devastated
libraries to replenish their shelves.
Most of all. it fosters mutual un-
derstanding by giving people in
each country greater access to the

ideas and attainments of other
countries."
In carrying out this pro-
gramme, Unesco since the be-
ginning of the year has dis-
patched to its Member States
two draft international agree-
ments and a series of ten sugges-
tions for remedial action. It has
placed a far-reaching proposal
before an international tfade
conference and worked out
plans for continuing activity in
conjunction with the competent
economic organizations of the
United Nations. Unesco's Book
Coupon Scheme, extended and
given additional funds, is being
adapted to cover the purchase
of educational films and scienti-
fic equipment, as well as books.
Following is a summary of the
action Unesco is taking In the
economic field.
Annecy Trade Conference
nfX) a 34-nation internationaltrade conference, in progress
at Annecy, Ranee, Unesco has
submitted a proposal that Cus-
toms duties should be reduced or
eliminated on educational, scien-
tific and cultural materials. A list
of materials, ranging from equip-
ment for schools to works of art
and laboratory apparatus, has
been placed before the conference.
After a lively debate, the con-
ference voted to accept the Unesco
proposal for the agenda and,
subsequently, to set up a seven-
nation committee"to examine, in
consultation with the representa-
tives of Unesco. the most practical
means of studying and formulat-
ing solutions of the questions
raLSed."Under the chairmanship
of Belgium, the Committee is
composed of representatives of
France, the United States, United
Kingdom. Brazil, Chile and Co-
lombia.-
This group will report the re-
sults of its investigations and
make recommendations to the
34-nation Tar riff Negotiations
Committee at Annecy. A favour-
able report can result in specific
tariff reductions making it easier
for people in many countries to
ootain the materials they need
from abroad.
Economic Commission
for Europe
pARALLEL with the effort toreduce Customs duties, and
with the same objective, Unesco
is seeking to promote internation-
al trade pacts. Agreement has
been reached with the Seoretariat
of the Economic Commission for
Europe to work jointly for the
inclusion of educational, scientific
and cultural materials in trade
agreements concluded under the
auspices of the ECE.
At the same time, the 14 Euro-
pean Member States of Unesco
have been urged to come to ECE
meetings prepared to negotiate
bilateral or multilateral trade
agreements on specific items of
scientific and mass communica-
tions equipment. The proposal was
accompanied by a detailed list of
such equipment, based on the
production capacities and require-
ments of the countries concerned.

plunged herself. By its presence 
there it will strengthen those
elements inside Germany who are

Dr. Torres Bodet emphasized
that Unesco's programme for 
Germany had not been conceived
as a substitution for the efforts
being made by the occupying
powers, or those efforts of certain
of Germany's neighbour states to
re-establis'1 relations with German
intellectual circles, j

In spite of losses during the second World
War, there were still ninety-three left
in 1947 (r.
Before the arrival of Europeans in
America there were about fifty-million
bison roaming the plains. B :,  1985 the
almost incredible news ! was received
actually leaving bare rock in its place (3).
The first question that faces us today
is Mlether the earth can continue the feed
us. Many peoples, now that the worst
wounds inflicted by the war have been
healed, have admittedly recaptured, more
or less the pre-war rhythm of life. In
the whole of Western Europe for example
- excepting Spain-the food problem is
by no means as acute as it was. But this
tenuous prosperity is a fragile plant,
constantly exposed to the menace of bitter
winds. Throughout the whole of Asia
there are still famines that every year
claim millions of dead. The fact is that
even if there were an equal distribution
of food resources throughout the work.
no one could eat quite as much as he
wished. We do not, of course, want to
achieve equality in misery. On the con-
trary. we want to increase food resources,
to make full use of those that nature
has given us, and to protect their main-
springs, For in certain respects, men are
no longer satisfied with the income they
receive from nature. They consume the
capital, by destroying it. Or again, they
are even unaware of the existence of
some of that income, and do not know
how to use it.
Suggestions and Proposals
Four-hundred and fifty scientists have
sent to the United Nations Conference
for the Conservation and Utilization of
Resources (U. N. S. C. C. U. R.) all kinds of
suggestions and proposals designed to
apply recent discoveries to the exploitation
of these resources.
Thus a Canadian scientist, Mr. Hans
Lundberg, has furnished a report on the
possiblity of conducting mining prospert-
ing by electronic means, from aircraft.
Such a process would result in far more
extensive and complete prospecting, and
would eliminate, especially in the case of
inhabited areas, all the present difficulties

fill the gap, which
its growing every
day, between the
ever increasing pop-
ulation of the
world and its de-
ciiningresources.
The problem, there-
fore, of the protec-
tion, conservation
and utilization of
nature is one with
many facets, and
one which interna-
tonal organiza-
tions, as well as
humble individuals
like shepherds and
ploughmen, must
face.
There JS the problem Of protecting
tropical soils which are being plundered
by over-exp : oitation. There is the task
of convincing the inhabitants of the
Mediterranean area that every year their
goats destroy entire forests. There is the
question of discovering fresh sources of
energy, or of utilizing those that nature
has already given us, such as solar energy
or the tides. There is the necessity of
protecting species that are threatened with
extinction. Whatever the particular prob-
lem involved by the protection of nature
may be-and such problems are legion-
it is of equal concern to manufacturers
and peasants, to scientists and artists.
Two Conferences
Considerable importance, therefore, will
be attached to the conference which 18
to begin on August 17 at Lake Success
under the auspices of llie United Nations.
and at which these problems will be con-
sidered.On August 22 another conference, th ! s
time called by the International Union
for the Protection of Nature and sponsor-
ed by Unesco, will also open at Lake
Success. The International Union
was created under Unesco's aus-
pices at Fontainebleau, near Paris,
last October.
The protection of nature is of
real concern to naturalists, who
wish to preserve intact certain
areas known as"natural reserves"
or"national parks"where they
can study certain animal and
vegetable species in their surround-
dngs and thus prevent their destruc-
tion.
It will be seen that the two Con-
ferences of the he U. P. N. and the
United Nations are concerned with
the same subject-Nature. But the
question is not viewed from exactly
the same aspect. The United Na-
tions Conference will examine the
problems of conservation as applied
to natural resources while the
Unesco-I. U. P. N. Conference will be
concerned more particularly with
questions relating to the protec-
tion of plant and animal species
and soil conservation. But because
of their interrelationship, it was
felt that they should be held
simultaneously, and in the same
place.
One of the different ways of
avoiding the reduction of natural
resources is to teach tile nations

Education and Natu-

partments jointly
requested a number
of experts to pre-
pare reports on par-
ticular facets of the
problem, while a sur-
vey was carried out
by the Departments
on the methods of
teaching conservation
to school children,
adults and the scien-
tific world. At the
same time the Unes-
co Fundamental Edu-
cation Clearing
House decided two
devote an issue of its
periodical"Abstracts
and Bibliography"to
a study of the best
educational works on
conservation.
A few specific
examples, perhaps,
! Will help to highlight
the importance of the
two Conferences.
As a result of heavy losses suffered In
the. war of 1914-1918, the herds of Euro-
pean bison were reduced to a few head
only. The complete disappearance of the
species was avoided just in time by the
creation of the International Society for
the Protection of European Bison. The
Society did a great deal of work and by
1938 the number of the pure species still
remaining was estimated at ninety-six.
To speak only of wind erosion,
130, 000, 000 hectares of land in the
United States have been affected by dust
storms which sweep away the too soil
year after year. One of the great hurri-
canes of 1934 carried off 500, 000, 000 tons
of loose top soil in the states of Nebraska
and Dakota. The soil had been eroded,
torn up and carried away to a depth of
twelve, twenty and twenty-eight inches,
that only five-
hundred were left
in the whole of the
United States. The
disappearance of the
species was once
again avoided, this
time by the creation
of National Parks.
This measure of pro-
tection has proved
effective and to-day
the herds preserved
in these parks have
risen to about six-
thousand head (2).
The s e examples
of destruction are
not confined to
animal and vegeta-
ble species. Other
natural products of
vital importance to
man have been
gravely affected. Soil,
the basic factor in
agriculture, is dis-
appearing through

tural expert from the Belgian Congo
has described the system used by
the Bantus for conserving tropical
forests-a primitive yet particularly
ingenious system, which he suggests

perts in all tropical areas.
The gravest dangers to mankind
arise not so much from the prob-
lems with which it grapples as from
t'house of which we are unaware. A
conference like that of U. N. S. C. C.
U. B. has many benefits to confer
and much information to impart.
It will only succeed fully, however,
when its work produces its effect
not only on scientists and tech-
nicians, but on a wider public.
Unesco's function is indeed to bring

puts them in contact with nature,
to a full realization of their posi-
tion in regard to it, and thus to
make them use it more wisely.

### 74002: The Rebirth of a valley: how the peasants of Marbial helped make the Haiti Pilot Project a success

A Valley
How the Peasants oj Marbial
Helped Make the Haiti
Pilot Pro ject a Success.
HIS is a story of an obscure, mountain-bound region in the
Caribbean Island of Haiti called the Marbial Valley.
In this f rgotten, isolated corner of the New W rld, lying
north of the little village of Jacmel on the southern shore of
the island, there live some 30. 000 peasants of African origin. Afflicted
by tropical rainstorms and ruinous droughts, stricken with disease
and impoverished by land erosion, they tried to scrape together some
semblauce of living-or quietly starved. Not famine-which was Loo
oommon-place-but"extraordinary famine"were the words used by
the people of the valley to mark the periods of targe scale starvation.
The children were pathetically stunted and diseased.
Then, in this region of misery, something happened which gave
the people a new hope in life. A new spirit began to blow through the
Valley when a Unesco team arrived to set up a fundamental education
project to help them overcome their illiteracy, raise their living
standards and agricultural productivity and improve their health.
This story is filled with ups and downs, with moments of deep
dejection and despondency, periods when almost everyone believed
that the project would have to be given up as a failure.
Now, after two years of continuous struggle, the picture has
changed. The Marbial project which might have been called"The
Death of a Haitian Valley", has lived and grown.
The heroes in this story are certainly the peasants of Marbial
themselves, who in the darkest days of the project, demonstrated with
huge picket signs reading"Kebe 1'IneSko to"-which in Creole means
"Support Unesco hard."Another hero iI undoubtedly the social
anthropologist on Unesco's staff in Haiti, Dr. Alfred Metraux, who
though striken by fever and with slender funds at his disposal, refused
to admit defeat and rallied the Marbial peasants to his side.
The Marbial experiment began as a lone Unesco-Haiti venture just
over two years ago. Today it is a joint international undertaking, with
the World Health Organization, the Viking Fund, the Rockefeller
Foundation and other organizations taking part.
The Unesco Courier presents the story 0 (a BaitiaD Va√üq.

The language of the country peasants is

In Port au Prince there are attractive

swimming baths, i large Catholic cathe-
dral and a Presidential palace, all looking
out over a brilliant b1ue in1et of the
Caribbean.
Beyond it on all sides are fine ranges
of mountains. After tropical rains they
are brilliant green with new vegetation.
In the dry season, brown is the predomi-
nant colour, reminiscent of the semi-
desert land of North Africa.
When one gets out of Port au Prince
into the mountains one enters a different
Haiti. Here the peasants live scattered
over the steep mountain sides in their
humble little shacks, each (, De on his own

THE PROBLEMS OF HAITI
lti ERE too ar the real problems ofHaiti : over-population, tropical
disease, deforestation, acute soil
erosion, and illiteracy.
Haiti is the smallest of the Latin-Ame-
rican Republics, with an area of some
ten-thousand square miles, but it has the
highest density of population, calculated
at more than three hundred and seventy-
six per square mile.
A high proportion of the inhabitants is
afflicted by a variety of tropical diseases.
Malaria, topical ulcers, intestinal worms.
and the contagious skin disease known
as yaws, are common afflictions.

The pressure of increasing population
forced the peasant to chop down. the
tropical forest own almost every avaible
patch o. f land in order to grow food. But
even this was no enough to feed his
family. The Haitian farmer courageously
and grimly undertook the cultivation of
slopes so steep that a goat could hardly
climb them. Using the machete and pri-
mitive hoe he scratched the surface of his
fields, often situated on slopes at a sixty
degree angle, where to keep himself from
falling he was forced to attach himself
with a rope ! His efforts, however, were
often condemned to failure. With the first
tropical'rains, th loose top soil was
washed down into the valley and out to
sea.
Haiti, which twas once considered 1ile
richest of the French Colonies, faced
acute and increasing poverty, reflected in
the misery and starvat : on of the peasants.
In addition, over the whole Republic
the rate of illiteracy was over eighty per-
cent. In the present areas it was normally
well over ninety percent. This meant not
only the inability to read and write but
ignorance of basic scientific principles
of agriculture and of the conservation of
resources, and above all, ignorance of ele-
mentacy hygiene.

lr HEBE were the problems which ledm Dumarsais Estime. Haiti's vigorous
and poplar president, to turn to
Unesco and propose that a"Pilot Pro-
ject"in fundamental education be star-
ted in his country.
The site chosen bv the Haitian Govern-
ment for the new'Pilot Project"was the
rural section of Marbial. in the valley of
the Gosseline River in the south of Haiti.
The Gosseline, which rises in the high
mountains of Grows Morne and flows for
some twenty mi ! fs through the rugged
foothills of Marbial, is a mountain torrent
which shrinks to a chain of muddy pools
during the dry season. The population of
the valley has been estimated at about
thirty thousand peasants. living scattered
over the steep mountain slopes in isolated
shacks. Hovewer, this is only a rough
estimate because no census has ever been
taken and no statistics exist. There are
no villages in the Marbial VaUey and its
only town is the little port of Jacmel),
where the Gosseline runs out into the sea.
FRUSTRATION
AND DESPAiR" :"
IU NESCO accepted the Haitian"Pi-lot Project"with enthusiasm. But
this initial enthusiasm was soon
destined to frustration.
First there was a period of misun-
derstanding, due to long-distance corres-
pondence-some of which never arrived.
Then, inaccurate articles appeared in
American and Haitian newspapers, sta-
ting that Unesco was putting two-hundred
thousand dollars into a project of funda-
mental education for the Marbial Valley.
This was more than the total budget
avaible to Unesco for its fundamental
education programme for all its forty
Member States.
Late in 1947, three members of Unesco's
staff visited Haiti and made a brief sur-
vey of the Marbial Valley. What they
found in the valley shocked them deeply.
Unesco had been prepared for"tough
sledding"in meeting the region's educa-
tional problems, but Macbial was obviously
a"pcoblem area"of the worst kind.
The over-population, the tropical di-
ceases, the deforestation and erosion
were so serious that it was patently evi-
dent that any project to improve condi-
tions in the valley implied something
more than education as such. Fighting
tropical diseases and reinstating a decli-
ning agriculture were problems in which
the World Health Organization and the
Food and Agriculture Organization were
competent rather than Unesco.
In November 1947, Unesco's General
representatives of the government. Bad

set to work drafting a programme 0

cussions. This included plans for prima.

ching ; health education and medical
services ; agricultural and veterinar)
education ; community cultural activitie :
based on a rudimentary library, museum11

of small industr : es and rural crafts at
well as the organization of cho-operatives
This programme would be integrate
into an over-all community education
scheme with Unesco working with the
Haitian Government and education au-
thorities. Unesco saw its task as a double
challenge : raising the social and econo-
mic level of the community through edu-
cation and at the same time the training
of Haitian teachers and workers so that
the project might become self-supporting
as rapidly as possible. It was obvious,
however, that this goal would not

### 74003: The Story of the Haiti 'Pilot Project'

To head the Survey Team in Haiti,
Unesco called on Dr. Alfred Metraux, an
American anthropologist of Swiss origin,
who left the United Nations'Department
of Social Affairs to join Unesco.
In April 1948, Dr. M√©tcaux arrived in
Port au Prince, formed his team of field
workers and t to work in Marbial
Valley.
Another eminent anthropologist, Dr.
Melville Herskovits had written a well-
known book entitled"Life in a Haitian
Valley."When Dr. M√©tcaux had been in
the valley a short time he repocted back
to Unesco that his survey might have to
be called"The Death of a Haitian
Valley."
The team was next to despair at the
formidable problems that faced it. Access
jnto the valley was cut off for many days
by tropical storms Only a rough track
ran up the stony bed of the river and it
was often impassible even by jeep. There

was no drinking water, no houses for the
staff except a few bfoken-down. leaky
peasants shacks, with no sanitation what-
ever. And one by one, the members of the
team, including Dr. M√©traux fell victim
two malaria.
It was obvious that these physical
handicaps would have to be overcome
before any programme of education could
be started. It began to look as though
the Pilot Project might die even before
jt could be brought effectively to life.
In July of the same year, Unesco asked
Dr. Frederick Rex, an American funda-
mental education specialist on Unesco's
staff, to go to Haiti. His report confimled
the pessimistic view already expressed by
Dr. Metraux.
Writing to the Unesco Courier, Dr. Rex
sa : d :"What I saw and heard made me
feel that the undertaking was impossible.
The ravages of floods, erosion, imprudent
and excessive cultivation had left but little
earth for the poor peasants of the Mar-
bial Valley to provide their daily bread.
"The rains had failed and some famines
had begun to eat the seed corn that
was all they had to provide the next
year's crops. A few wi ; d mangoes were
often the only food a family could offer
in exchange for a cup of millet or corn.
Seven out of ten people had malaria.
The swolJen stomachs and the spindly
legs of the children spoke of hookworm
and malnutrition. Yaws, with its horrible
disfiguring effects was apparentlv com-
mon".
It looked as though the project in
Marbial Valley might have to be abandon-
ed, or a new site chosen, since it was
no part √êf Unesco's work to carry out a
major re1ief job.
Learning of this possibility of abandon-
ing the project. Dr. Metraux, who had
doggedly carried on his work in spite
of his iHness. dispatched a letter to
Unesco in which he wrote :"We cannot
pull out from Haiti... we cannot abandon
these people. If we do. we shall break
their spirit completely... Whatever has been
done in the field of education will co) Japse.
This will be a complete disaster... The
Unesco Pilot Project is an experience
which is worth all our energy".
They too heart
the rumours that
U n e s c 0 might
abandon- them.
They called emer-
gency meetings of

"Marbial bas become a famous'site.

Last month, the director of rural educa-
tion sent to Marbial twenty-die school

of the children is different..."
On October 30. 1948, Dr. Rex wrote to
Unesco :"The tide of fortune of the
Unesco Pilot Project... seems to have turn-
ed for the better. Before the end of the
year, conditions and facilities will be right
for the establishment of specific educa-
tional activities which may be of great
interest to other fundamental education
schemes facing similar adverse conditions
at the outset... cO ! 1fidence has been estab-
lashed among the peasants of the Marbial
Valley that their miserable prospects of
last summer can be changed by joint and
co-operative efforts..."
U. N. MISSION ARRIVES
lrHAT the Haiti Pilot Project mightbecome more than just a Unesco-
Marbial Valley experiment became
evident as early in July of last year
when President Estim√© appealed to the
United Nations'Department of Economic
Affairs to carry out a full survey of the
economic, agricultural, health and edu-
cational conditions and needs of the
entire Republic. When the United Nations
accepted this proposal, Unesco appointed
Dr. Rex as its representative on the
Mission.
Last October, under the leadership of
the Swedish sociologist, Dr. Ansgar Ro-
senborn, and assisted by experts from
FAO, WHO and the Monetary Fund, the
United Nations Mission of Technical
Assistance to Haiti, began a full-scale
survey of the island. At the request of
Unesco it undertook a special study of
the Marbial Valley.
In its report, the Mission pointed out
that although the difficulties of the
Marbial Valley had not been under estimat-
ed, the efforts of the local peasants had
been so remarkable that the project
should certainty be carried through. The
Mission even went further and recom-
mended that the Marbial project should
be fitted into a wider health and agri-
cultural improvement scheme for the
whole watershed of the Gosseline River,
(of which the Marbial area represents
only the middle part). They proposed
that the health scheme should be based
on the small local hospital at Jacmel,
with a'rural clinic at the Unesco Centre
in Marbial and that the training of
health and agricultural community
workers should be carried out as part
of the fundamental education programme
in Marbial.

PEASANTS SPRING TO
ACTION"
II T was at this point that peasants ofMarbial sprang into action and
practically changed the face of the
volley.
"Koumbites", serve for mutual help in
tasks beyond the capacity of one man
and his family. Despite the fact that
they were starving, they rallied to Dr.
Metraux and Dr. Rex and went to work.
They built the first all-year road to the
town of Jacmel. They sank a well forty feet
from the river bed to get pure drinking
water. They brought in a well-digger from
Port au Prince to dig more welis. The
Marbial market which had been halfway
in the river bed was recontructed on
higher ground with dry gravelled lanes
and little stalls. The donkeys, horses and
animals for sale or slaughter were confin-
ed in a corral along the river front. A
small open-air slaughter house was
constructed of concrete. The co-operatives
painted a big sign in Creole over the
market gate :"Sanitary Market of Mar-
bial constructed by UNESCO".
The peasants, with the aid of a Health
Service technician, drained the swamps,
tracked down breeding grounds of malarial
mosquitoes and sprayed them with D. D. T. A
small dispensary was opened with a doctor
and a local medical assistant for the
free treatment of disease and the distri-
bution of medicines. The dispensary serv-
ed the peasants and their livestock alike.
Twenty-eight young, women learned to
weave native cotton on a hand. : oom, On
their small hand-made looms they learned
to weave sisal and palm fibers for mats
used for ladies'sandals.
An oven was built for the construction
of cups, saucers, plates and bowls.
For the* school children an emergency
feeding programme was begun which gave
a substantial midday meal to four-hun-
dred children weekly.
A community centre was established. A
small vegetable"nursery"was started to
encourage the production of food stuffs
and the improvement of local varieties
of corn, egg-plant and beans.
In September 1948 ten education centres
were teaching old and young in the
Valley to read and write in Creole. Some
of the newly literate even began to study
French. Soon a local newspaper appeared.
. handwritten and illustrated with simple
crayon drawings, through the mitiative
of a few members of the Co-operatives
and was distributed through the Unesco
office staff. Now, the newspaper is actually
being printed. It carries all the local
news of the Va'ley-births, deaths, mar-
riages, letters of complaint to the editor,
and a section on agriculture and health
week. There are still not enough copies
to go around so the school boys and girls
read it aloud their eager parents.

### 74003: The Story of the Haiti 'Pilot Project'

EDUCATION
For HEALTH
The story
OJ the Haiti
'Pilot Project'
Today, too, the eagerness of the Haitian
peasants to provide their children with
an education is such, that they have
actually had to be restrained ! Only last
month. Dr. M√©traux reported that a young
Haitian architect, named Mangones. was
designing a set of new school buildings
in the Haitian tradition. Unesco flew a
number of designs on microfilm to
Mangones, showing tropical schools in
Brazil, Mexico and Africa. But the
enthusiasm to start building immediately
lWas so great among the Marbial people
that it was only with difficulty that the
laying of the foundations could be post-
poned until the final plans had been
accepted !
In addition to this building already
undertaken, plans are being made for
constructing another rural schood and a
training centre for fundamental education
workers. The original school is now
equipped with blackboards, and locally
made benches and tables. Practical cour-
ses are being given in hygiene, agriculture
and stock-raising, basket-making, weaving
and carpentry.
Now that they are getting better food
every day, the change in the children
is striking. The gloom and sadness are
gone and have been replaced by laughter
and eargerness to play. Their games

'OUNESCO'
OR'INESKO' ?
IN its report to President Estim√©. theM United Nations Mission had recom-
mended that the Haitian Gov-
ernment launr ; h an all-out literacy
campaign with the teaching of Creole
and French, and prepare a series of
elementary text-books and readers.
But preparing books and readers in
Haitian Creole poses a knotty problem.
The fact is that Creole, which is a
mixtuce of ancient French and West
African tribal languages has been written
in at least four different ways with
different alphabets. The orthography and
grammar have never been satisfactorily
established. Thia explains why one finds
signs and posters, written in Creole,
which spell Unesco in different ways.
"Ounesco"."Unesco", and even"Inesko"
are thus commonly seen.
With the aid of the Rockefeller Foun-
dation, Unesco obtained the services off.
Dr. Robert Hall, Professor 01 Romance
Languages at Cornell University, and a
Creole linguist. Dr. Hall has just comp : et-
ed an intensive study in Haiti of the
Creole grammar and orthography. The
report on his findings reached Unesco
in Paris early in June. He is now at
work on a standard alphabet and
grammatical system which will be used
by a newly-formed team in Haiti to
prepare basic school books, primers and
refusing material in the local Creole.
The typical young Haitian girl (above left) presents a vivid contrast to woman
of l\larbial (above, centre) whose face is disfigured by th affects of yaws, a
disease rampant in the Valley. The parents of the twin babies (above right)
were paying the local witch doctor to save the life of one of the babies thought
to be growing at the expense of the other whe was dying.
WHEN fundamental education firstcame into being as a part of the
programme of Unesco, it was
agreed that provision should be made
in Pilot Projects for library and museum
services. Haiti, with its vivid traditions
of folk art and visual and aural expres-
sion, was particularly well suited to an
experiment of this kind.
Museums and libraries have recently
developed techniques of direct approach
to ear and eye which are entirely suitable
for fundamental education, using models
and charts to. convey essential ideas to
a largely illiterate community. Use can
also be made of films of static film-
strips, of sound recordings, music, story-
telling, drama groups and specially
prepared exhibitions.
This is an educational technique which
has been successfully developed by popular
museums and libraries in more privileged
countries but has seldom been applied
to illiterate peoples Here, the Haiti Pilot
Project has pioneering work to do.
Last year, Unesco approached the
Rockefeller Foundation for a grant-in-aid
o ! seventy-five hundred dollars to enable
Mademoiselle Yvonne Oddon, an anthro-
pologist and librarian of the Mus√©e de
1'Homme in Paris, to study the cultural
missions and popular museums and libra-
ries in Mexico and the United States
where these techniques were being applied.
Miss Oddon collected information and
sample materials which would help the
field : workers in the Haiti Project to apply
these new museum and library techniques.
She studied methods of preparing film-
strips and educational films, educational
posters, mobile exhibits and trail-side
museums and libraries. Mlle Oddon felt
that no material could be'translated or
copied in Haiti without first being
thoroughly adapted to the local Haitian
requirements, tested in Haitian schools
and adult centres, before being adopted
for general use.
Her idea was to equip the Marbial
Marbial, where she will establish a visual
education museum as part of the funda-
mental education activities in the Pilot
Project. Examples of the exhibits will be
sent to Rio de Janeiro for the Latin-
American Seminar on Literacy Teaching
which will be held from July 27 to
September 6, and some may also be
available in Paris for Unesco's General
Conference in September.
Progress
In the
Valley
The desire for
education in the
Marbial Valley is
s u c h that the
peasants have ac-
tually had to be
restrained.
Even the older
eneration is en-
thusiastic for th :
new educational
opportunities offer-
ed.
The children,

effort to help the peasants to raise their
own economic lever by their own efforts
and with their own resources.
WHO JOINS IN
m) NESCO'S sister Agency, the WorldHealth Organization, has now
agreed to co-operate with the Haiti
Pilot Project and will send in a doctor
and a public health nurse to run the
public health programme for the Valley.
In a letter to Dr. Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, dated June 1, the
Director-General of WHO, Dr. Brock Chis-
holm, writes :"... concerning WHO parti-
cipation in this Project, we are now in
process of recruiting the medical officer...
A tropical nurse to help in the training
of Haitian women in domestic and
midwifery practices is also in process of
recruitement... Budget allotments nave
been made for drugs, medical equipment...
"We are glad to have this opportunity
t share in such a valuable joint Project."
WHO will use the Unesco educational
centre for training medical assistants and
for getting the principles of hygiene
across to the inhabitants. The aim is to
turn the entire Gosseline Valley into a.
"demonstration area"in tropical hygiene
and health education and training. The
educational and training aspects are to
be handled by Unesco while preventive
medicine and tropical hygiene will come
under WHO.
An encouraging example of the Haitians'
. faith in a demonstration cause and remedy
was their reaction to a Walt Disney film
on hookworm. After seeing the film and
realizing why they were suffering from.
hookworm they immediately agreed to
suggestions to build latrines. Now fifty
latrine pits have been sunk and are
regularly supervised by the Koumbite Co-
operative.
But the greatest publ : c health problem
of the Valley is yaws. If it could be acrang-
ed to pump one"shot"of penicillin, which
to-day costs twenty-two cents a dose, into
every local inhabitant of Marbial, all
cases of this hideous disease, and of
other afflictions such as tropical ulcers,
could be wiped out practically over night.
because of chronic matnutrition. have shown a striking
change now that the7 are eating wholesome food.
MIle Oddon, the French museum and
library specialist talking with four
workers of the Community Centre.
If Unesco and WHO could train the
Haitians to use hypodermics and get the
local people to take the injections, the
results would be spectacular and might
give health education Quite a boost in
Haiti.
) f\R Alfred M√©traux, who has directedthe Haitian Pilot Project up until
last month, is about two return to
Europe. He leaves the Marbial experiment
to a new Director of Fundamental Edu-
cation, M. Albert Fernandez Ballesteros,
who has just arrived in Haiti. Widely
experienced in modern educational me-
thods. an architect, designer and painter,
M. Ballesteros has lived and worked for
many years in Africa, Mexico, Columbia
and Jamaica, where he was able to observe
at first hand the difficult life of the
peasants. L1 his native Spain, he has
known long years of experience in organiz-
ing and running co-operative movements.
In a letter dated May 27, and written
to Mr. John Bowers, who has directed
Unesco's Fundamental Education Division
since its creation, and who steadfastly and
courageously maintained his faith in the
Pilot Project, Dr. M√©traux writes :
"... My sojourn in Haiti is coming to an
end. I shall leave Haiti with regret but...
with a good director on the job and
with the support of the Director-General
of Unesco, the Haitian project will not
have to remain the burden and the worry
it has been for more than two years. The
baby will soon walk and will no longer
need a solicitous nursemaid.'
This, then is the story of the re-birth
of a Haitian Valley. Yes, the baby will
soon walk. The Project is scheduled to
last for five years. At the end of the
first, it looked impossible. Now. by the
end of the second year, its achievements
and future possibilities have been drama-
tically recognized. The success is a tribute
to the peasants of the Valley of Marbial.
The project survived because they had
faith in it, because they were not afraid
to prove that faith in their work despite
the scepticism, anguish and set-backs
that might have halted them. A Haitian
Creole proverb says,"Bi√™ s√¢ sue pa dure"
or"What one gets without pain doesn't
last".
In proving their faith, the people of
the Marbial Valley have proved the basic
principle of fundamental education-that
progress must be made not FOR the
people, but BY the people themselves.

children's"rondes"

For the parents,

centres have been
set up in the Valley.
Often these centres
have been tiny huts
made of no more
than banana leaves.
But it was from
these humble buts

later aid in illustrating

went to work on the
project following her
arrival in Haiti last
March. Using a work-
shop lent tun Unesco by
the Art Centre at
Port au Prince, she
prepared an exhibit
including an artistic
chart of Creole phone-
tics. hand-made slides
on mosquitoes and
malaria, a three di-
mensional exhibit on
food. and a diorama on
soil protection.
The exhibit was an
immediate success in
Port au Prince where
such panels and light-

AGRICULTURAL
DEVELOPMENTS
HERE is a joint American andHaitian Food Production Organiza-
tion in Haiti known as SCIPA
(Service coop√©r'ltif inter-american de
production agricole) which is assuming
an important role in the agricultural
development of the Republic. This organ-
ization is supported financially by the
Institute of Inter-American Affairs in
Washington and the Haitian Government
in Port au Prince.
Pending a decision on the recommenda-
tion made by the United Nations Techni-
cal Mission for an agricultural development
plan embracing the entire Gosseline
watershed, SCIPA is carrying on agri-
cultural work in the Marbial VoaI : ey.
Their technicians have helped to get this
year's planting under way. Luckily, the
rains began to fall during the middle of
March. and the peasants are confident
of a fine harvest of beans, corn and
egg-plant.
Already, new seeds have been distribut-
ed in the Valley and the farmers were
so over-joyed to receive them that they
agreed to give two days'free work to
Unesco as a sign of their gratitude.
SCIPA has attached a Haitian agri-
cultural expert to the project and a de-
monstration plot and seed nursery have
also been set up in the Valley.
The plan is not to be a large-scale,
agricultural-engineering scheme, but an

In an introduction to the Report, Dr. Torres Bodet, points out
that it lays stress on Unesco's work for the re-establishment of
international contacts in the fields of education, science and
cultur*.
IN conclusion, he writes,"This is what I personally regard asUnesco's ultimate aim : through education, science and
culture to bring about true fellowship between all peoples of the
world and betwen all men in each eountry.
"Unesco is thus faced with two equally important obligations :
to make each culture understand that it enriches itself by
borrowing from others and repaying them with interest from its
own finest and rarest creations ; and to bridg the wide gulf
betwecn intellectuals and the masses so that a bond of brother-
hood may draw them together for the l : enefit for aU."
The Report and its 15 annexes cover every aspect of the
Organization's work during the past year. financial and adminis-

Recommendations
to Member States
IN a Memorandum to MemberStates early this year, the Di-
rector-General stated the case for
reducing economic barriers to the
international movement of infor-
mat : on materials and put forwaad
ten suggestions. Among these were
that Member States should sim-
plify and centralize their own
import regulations ; release larger
amounts of foreign exchar. ge for
educational purchase ; and ins-
truct their representatives at in-
ternational wade conferences to
urge specially favourable treat-
ment for educational, scientific

"Relaxation of controls for
these materials"the Director-Ge-

### 74007: A French foreign legionnaire and Paris 'dead-end' kids

THE CHILDREN'S VILLAGE WITCH..
It was a hard life and the pay
didn't compare with what they
could have made by petty black
market activities. Some did in
fact give up, but the ones he
finally brought back to Paris
were physically and morally betterthan when they
had left.
French Foreign Legionnaire
And Paris'Dead-End'Kids
III"you travel up the valley
of the Drome, in the moun-
) tt tainous Vercors country of
southeast France, where the
maquis had their strongholds
during the Occupation, you will
come across a l : ttle hamlet call-
ed Vercheny.
About a mile away, up on the
vine-covered hillside are the
ruins of another village, Verche-
ny-Ie-Vieux, abandoned a genera-
tion ago. The roofs have fallen
in, grass g>rows thickly round the
crumbling wal1s and the village
streets are only recognizable as
weedy tracks. Within the former
dwellings themselves, trees have
actually taken root and pushed
their trunks and branches up-
wards through the ceilings and
the roofs.
A few months ago,"Old"Ver-
cheny was a deserted"Ghost-
town". but today, to the noise
of hammering and sawing and
the sound of young voices caised
in song, it is coming back to life.
Led by a 21-year-old ex-Foreign
Legionnaire, a group of Paris
youths are workmg there on what
might be termed"Operation New-
life". Out of its ruins they are
rteating a new community to give
the chance of a new existence to
some of the neglected"dead-end"
children of Paris.
When the work is completed,
the piles of rubble and jagged
wal1s will have been replaced by
new houses, workshops, a school
and a sports ground, forming a
children's community centre
which will provide home life and
educational and apprenticeship
opportunities for children who
were heading for the juvenile
court and the reform school.
The project began three years
ago as an idea in the mind of
Robert Ardouvin, a young French
sex-Legionnaire who is directing
the work at Vercheny. At that
time he was eighteen, practically
penniless and earning hi living by
teaching school and selling news-
papers in the Montmartre quarter.
At his pitch in the Place Pi-
galle he watched life go on around
him and saw children who, in
order to eat, stole or trafficked on
the black market, others whose
home lives were non-existent and
the homeless ones who, after the
last underround train had pass-
ed, lay down to sleep on the steps
of the stations at Anvers, Pigalle
and Barb√®s
He had read that there were
300, 000 French children living in
Robert Ardouvin,
drawn buy one of
his companions,
M. Haffner.
Then for a time
his efforts seem-
ed to lead no-
where. But one
day, Madame
Jean C h a u v e 1,
wife of the then
French Assistant
Secretary of State
for Foreign Af-
fairs, heard what
Robert was trying
to do. Soon after-
wards, an associa-
tion, which they
decided to call
"Friends of the
Children of Pa-
ris", was formed
by Madame Chau-
vel and other pro-

and his team of helpers had made
it habitable at a cost of 75, 000
francs, plus a good deal of sweat
and aching muscles.
It was a great day for him when
the first fifteen children arrived
from Paris at the"White House",
as it was called because of its
clean, newly limed walls. They
were not coming to live in"ideal"
conditions, but it was at least
a great improvement on what they
had left behind
They had to be taught many
simple things-that meals are
eaten off plates and around a
tables, that they must wash them-
selves and brush their teeth daily,
that they must gO to school regu-
larly and do their homework-all
of which they soon accepted as
part of their new life. But, above
all, they were happy and began
to understand what a"home"
really meant.
Watching the members of his
"family"le8l'ning to live together,
Robert was happy, but he still
didn't know how and whece he
could set up the country centre
for them, so that the Montreuil
home could be free to receive
fifteen newcomers.

were aimed at"re-educating"

So, alone, he made up his mind
to help those children who had
not yet appeared before a judge.
He would need, he decided, a
team of helpers, preferably young
men who had learned from exper-
ience the meaning of"conditions

Two months later. helped by
seven other youths, he began to
clear the site for the first house..
He also began digging into the
hillside to catch a spring which
would provide the centre with
water and also help to improve the
supply for Vercheny village.
The villagers have been glad to
help the boys, giving them fruits,
vegetables and cheese. Two farm-
ers have promised to plough up
the land for them.
A few months ago, the rest of
the twenty youngsters from Mon-
treuil went down to join them
and a new group of youngsters has
taken their place. Now that the
fine weather has come. the work
is being pressed ahead with the
assistance of the International
Voluntary Service for Peace which
has sent down teams of work
camp volunteers to give a hand.
Three houses have already been
fully restored-the first units in
what will eventually be a com-
munity of two-hundred young
people.
So, the third part of Robert's
dream is coming true. But he
is looking much further ahead.
While he works at Vercheny, he
is thinking up new projects-an
industrial training centre near a
large town and more ceception
centres, at Marseilles and Lyons.
He's young enough, he feels, to
be able to make long-term plans.

A new

In World
Fc  M r e
JT For 
Publication

() N member 1 last year, a
serious fire destroyed the
libraries of the Univer-
sity of Chile Medical School,
burning about half the 15, 000
volumes in the main library and
most of those in the eight
departmental ones.
Among the books lost in the
firs were many medical period-
icals published in European and
other countries whose replace-
ment, especially those now out of
print.
Now, however, thanks to an
"SOS"published by Unesco in
its"Bulletin for Libraries", thece
is a good chance that libracies in
many parts of the world will be
able to supply Chile Universitv
with many of the missing vo-
lumes.
This example of directing help
where it is most needed is a good
illustration of an important as-
pect of Unesco's work and demons-
trates the useful role which the
"Bulletin for Libracies"has fin-

;'existing Resources
The stocy of the Libraries Bul-
letin began even before the offi-
cial birth of Unesco itself. In
1946, the Preparatory Commis-
sion of Unesco set up a prepara-
tory Libraries Section which start-
ed an extensive survey of world
library needs and resources.
To those carrying out the in-
quiry it soon became obvious that ;
not withstanding the losses caus-
ed by the war, many library

needs could be satisfied
through existing resources
in other countries. The
problem, it seemed, was
mainly one of informing
needy libraries where to look
for donors and of indicating
to libraries with surplus ma-
trial the places where
their help would do the
good.
The purpose of the publi-
cation, it was decided, would
be to publicize the needs,
offers and exchange invita- :
tions of libraries, to give
information on important
bibliog. ra {) hical and reference
works as well as library news of
international interest.
Since the first issue appeared
in April 1947 the"Bulletin"has
been pubLshed regularly. each
month in a bilingual edition
(English-French) and has grown
in size from twenty-fouc to forty
pages. During the same time its
circulation has increased from
4, 500 to 7, 500 copies, which are
sent out free of charge to all
parts of the world. To-day, the
"Bulletin"has established itself at
an integral part of international
library communications.
Why has it proved such a suc-
cessful experiment ? The principal
reason is that it is fining an im-
portant need by acting as a co-
ordinating agency to assist libra-
ries reconstruction and to faci-
1state international library ex-
changes.
Proof of the"Bulletin's"success
has been seen in the hundreds of
letters received by Unesco from
libraries in all parts of the worM,
expressing appreciation for the
help it provides. To cite but one
example, recognition of these ser-
vices was given recently by the
"Schrifttum der Bodenkultur",
organ of the"Hochschule fur Bo-

.'..'U NESCO in Focus"by James L.
t t Henderson,'ecturer at the Uni-
versity of London, is  recent
pamphlet in the Freedom Pamphlets Series
published by the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.
"Unesco in Focus"describes the history
and evaluates the prospects of
success of the UN education-zeal organization dedicated to
"constructing the defenses of
peace in the minds of men".
In a foreword to the pamphlet,
Milton Eisenhower, Chairman
of the U. S. National Commis-
sion for Unesco, terms it a
major contribution to the lite-
rature about Unesco.
"If our world is not to be
the tomb of an atom-wrecked
civilization", declares Mr. Hen-
derson,"a fair share of us
on the globe must achieve
that mutual understanding and
respect by which an interna-
tional society transcending all
national or group differences
can become a reality. Unesco
is the best answer man has
yet devised to this life-and-
death problem".
With a view toward attaining these goals,
Mr. Henderson points out, Unesco has em-
barked upon a bold global program, which calls
among other things for : educational recons-
truction in war-devasted nations ; advancement
of education in areas where it has hitherto
lagged ; promotion of cultural exchange

Even libraries in such war-devas-*

to help those who have suffered

Through its Clearing House fore
Libraries, Unesco has been offer-
ing for free distribution thou-
sands of books and periodicals
and each month the"Bulletin"
lists many of these offers.
In the March issue for instance,
the offers included books on reli-
gion, fiction, various periodicals,
and a large select : on of reprints
from medical periodicals. More of
these medical reprints were out-
fered in the April"Bulletin".
Sophocles and Zenophon
The offers published in the
May issue cover Greek and Latin
text-books which can be obtained
free of charge on application to
Unesco's Clearing House for Li-
braries. These text-books include
works by Home, Plato, Sophocles
and Zenophon in the Greek Sec-
tion and Latin text-books rang-
! ing from elementary grammars to
H. Hardinge's book."JuliUS Cae-
sar, Soldier, Statesman, Emperor."
The May issue also lists ex-
change offers from thirteen coun-
tries. A French oceanographic
station in Indo-China, fore
example, offers to exchange tech-
nical memoranda publications,
but stipulates that it must receive
"really valuable scientific ma-
nuals"in return, as its archives
have been seriously depleted dur-
ing fighting in the area.
Some of the requests and offers
would certainly mean little to the
average reader but they are of
vital importance to libraries and
libranans in many parts of the
world, who are trying to overcome
the effects of the cultural"black-

is still more important they are

Later this year Unesco's Libra-

book in international publication
exchanges, the first of its kind
ever to appear. Listing exchange
offers by subject field, the hand-
book will serve as a useful ref-
erence work for use by libraries
in their search for books.
It is this world-wide network
of library communications which
Unesco is working to maintain
and develop, and in its fight one
of the most vital weapons is the
"Bulletin for Libraries."

### 74011: World 'Cit√© des arts' to be created in heart of Paris

TO BE CREATED
In Heart of Paris
N the seventeenth
century, the part of
Paris liying between
the churohes of
Saint Gervais and
Saint Paul was a
rich and prosperous'
quarter containing
many fine build-
ings. Situated on
the right bank of
the Seine, close to the Islands of La Cite
and Saint Louis where Paris was founded,
it was also the scene of many important
historical events.
But, time and history have changed its
aspect. During the eihteenth and nine-
teenth centuries many of the stately
buildings were transformed into apart-
ment houses and, under a slum clearance
plan put into operation during the Second
World War, dozens of houses were torn
down.
Before the war ended, however, archi-
tects had begun to draw up plans for the
preservation and re-adaptation of the
: remaining buildings for modern needs and
four studios together with flats to which
it may send its artists.
The Cite des Arts will, therefore, go a
long way towards solving the problem
facing many artists from abroad who at
present have great difficulty in finding
accommodations in Paris, owing to the
serious housing shortage.
M. Michel Roux-Spitz, a leading Paris
architect who has drawn up the plans for
the Centre, estimates that be. wees two-
hundred and two-hundred and twenty
studios and workshops, each having its
own apartment of from two to five rooms,
can be provided. The larger apartments
will be for those"students"who decide to
bring their families with them and will
be furnished and decorated in a simple
but attractive way.
The architectural design of the Cit√©
wit harmonize with its seventeenth
oentury surroundings and the construc-
tion will embody as much as possible the
traces of the past-foundations of former
buildings and the moulding and figures
that have been saJva ( ; (ed from them.
As part of the original reconstruction

national students houses. The statutes
of the new centre will be similar to those
of the University City except that it will
welcome both mature artists and art
students
The scheme is being directed by a com-
mittee set UD in France under the patro-
nage of the Academy of Fine Arts and
the City of Paris. Similar committees have
been formed in other parts of the world,
principally in Scandinavian countries,
with the aim of raising cap : tal for the
project which, it is estimated, will cost
about one-thousand million francs.
This sum Is to be split into two-hundred
shares of five million francs each. rep-
resenting the cost of building and fur-

"City Hall".
In this way. a country subscribing

scheme two entire houses of the
Louis XVI period and a third from an
earlier period were taken down stone by
stone, numbered and piled for future use.
Thee three houses will be rebuilt exactly
as they stood two-hundred years ago and
will become the studios and homes of the
artists.
There will, however, be no attempt at
standardization. In following the form of
the original buildings, the architects have
been able to plan varying types of studios.
Generally speaking. sculptors will have
their workshops on the ground floors of
buildings so that blocks of stone and other
heavy working materials can be delivered
to them easily.
Painters, as far as possible, will be
given studios facing the north, on the
first and second floors. Other studios and
workshops are planned for engravers and
architects.
On some of the ground floors is is in-

tended to install book, are and antique
shops to serve the needs of the Cite.
The administrative headquarters of the
Centre will be housed in the histor : c
Hotel d'Aumont, built for the Duke d'Au-
mont by the famous seventeenth century
architects, Le Vau and Fran√ßois Mansart.
At the time of the French Revolution
the house was bought by a contractor
who later sold many of its furnishings,
the paintings on the ceilings and even the
staircases. Finally, it became part of a,
pharmaceutical factory, but in 1936 it
was bought by the City of Paris au-
thorities who wished to preserve and
restore it.
Work has already begun on its restore-
tion and a giant woodeR"umbrella"haS
been built to protect it from further
damage by the weather.
In its completed form the new"Cit, y
Hall"Iwill comprise an exhibition hall for
paintings, engravings and other art works.
an art library, administrative offices und
accommodations for the Director of the
Centre.
The huge cellars with their vaulted
ceilings which were formerly the kitchens,
will become a lounge and concert room.
The whole will constitute a sort of In-
ternational Cultural Centre where artists
from many countries will be able to hold
exhibitions of their work and compare
ideas and techniques.
Eventually it is hoped to extend the
Hotel d'Aumont by adding a new win on
the west side. This did not previously
exist but the architects believe that it
fonned part of the plans of the original
builders, and was never completed be-
cause of insufficient money.
Originally the hotel had its own gar-
dens, but these have long since disap-
pearled. It is intended to lay out new ones
following the lines of the former ones and
to plant trees along each side.
On the south side of the Cite, borderingthe Seine, an entirely new building will
be constructed with a series of archways
allowing an unrestricted view over the
river toward the Isle of Saint Louis and
at the same time enabling the passer-by
to see the gardens of the Cite and the
fa√ßade of the restored Hotel d'Aumont..
This building will contain a restaurant,
lounges, lecture rooms and a number of,
guest rooms, the whole fronted on the
riverside by a long terrace.
The finial form of the Cite will be that
of a hollow square with gardens, squares
and trees in the centre and the studios
and apartments round three sides. Most
of the fourth side will be open to view
from the street, but enclosed by railings..
Completely self-contained, the Cit√© will
have a single entrance on the north side
and will be far enough away from the
main streams of traffic to ensure the
calm and quiet required for creative work.
The construction of the Cite has been
embodied in the general plan for rehabi-.
litating this part of Paris, and has, there-
fore, the support of the Paris City
Council. Recently the Council approved
the granting of a ninety-nine year lease
on th ground for the project, and the
French state Council is drawing up fmd.
approving the statutes.
Promises of financial support have
been obtained from several countries and
it is expected that work on the world's
first international City of Arts will soon
be under way.
