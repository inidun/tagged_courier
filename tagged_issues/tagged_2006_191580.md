T
enriched by several more archeo-
logical properties with the Bistun 
(Islamic Republic of Iran) bas-reliefs. 
Sculpted on an imposing cliff-face, 
the most famous of the bas-reliefs 
was executed in 521 BC at the order 
of the Achaemenid king, Darius I, to 
celebrate his victory against an en-
emy. An inscription in three languag-
es – Elamite, neo-Babylonian and 
old Persian – is engraved along the 
carved panels. It represents the only 
text by an Achaemenid king relating 
to an event that marked his reign. It 
is furthermore thanks to this inscrip-
tion that a British officer in the 19th 
century was able to decipher old 
Persian cuneiform script, in the same 
way that Champollion had solved the 
mystery of hieroglyphics with the Ro-
setta stone. 
Another site singled out: the his-
torical town of Harar, in Ethiopia. 
Perched at an altitude of more than 
1800 metres, it was once the gate-
way to Abyssinia. The fortified wall 
four metres high that still encircles 
the town testifies to the conflicts that 
began in the 16th century between 
the independent Muslim kingdom 
and the Christian emperors holding 
sway over the country. Although tra- 
ders’ caravans from the Abyssinian 
mountains or the Gulf of Aden tra- 
ding posts no longer come as before 
to sell coffee or ivory, Harar remains 
a noisy and vibrant town where com-
merce still holds an important place.
Recent heritage 
is highlighted
Following a noticeable trend in the 
last few years, the List is giving grea- 
ter recognition to recent heritage. An 
example is the Biscay Bridge, in the 
Spanish Basque country. The metal-
lic construction was made to join the 
opposite banks of the Nervión river, 
in Bilbao, without obstructing boat 
navigation. To meet the double chal-
lenge, the engineer Martín Alberto 
de Palacio y Elissague innovated: 
he agave cutters in Jalisco Mexico 
may not hear the news. It will proba-
bly have little impact on the harvest of 
the “piña”, used to make tequila. Yet 
on 12 July, the agave landscape and 
the old Tequila industrial installations 
were inscribed in UNESCO’s World 
Heritage List. 
This Mexican landscape is one 
of the 18 sites proclaimed by the 
World Heritage Committee, in Vilnius 
(Lithuania) from 8 to 16 July. The Con-
vention concerning the protection of 
the world cultural and natural heri-
tage, adopted in 1972 by UNESCO, 
now recognizes 830 properties of 
“outstanding universal value”. Given 
that there are 1500 sites on the waiting 
list, the number of the chosen may 
seem modest. In fact, it shows the 
Committee’s resolution in recent 
years to reduce inflation in the num-
ber of inscriptions.
The latest proclamation also reflects 
the general composition of the List, 
which has included a majority of cul-
tural sites from the beginning. There 
are actually 644 cultural properties 
versus 162 natural and 24 mixed 
(both natural and cultural). 
The lion’s share 
are cultural sites
This year too, the cultural sites 
bagged the lion’s share. The List is

It was in the 19th century too that 
the Mexican valleys of Jalisco saw the 
development of distilleries for making 
Tequila, the incendiary beverage de-
picted by Hollywood. With the selec-
tion of the cultural landscape of the 
Jalisco valleys, the entire kingdom of 
agave is crowned. 
As the first legal instrument to pro-
tect both cultural and natural proper-
ties, the Convention also defends as-
sets such as the Great Barrier Reef 
(Australia) or the Everglades National 
Park (United States). This year, 2 
natural properties were added to the 
List. Among them is the Giant Panda 
reserve in Sichuan, China. The re-
serve is one of the few places in the 
world where these animals, 12 million 
years old, still live in the wild. Their 
situation is most precarious, however, 
with only 1500 individuals remaining 
of this endangered species.

MeMories of Bisotun
ven though decades have passed 
since my first trips to Bisotun, I re-
member each of them most vividly. 
Any archaeologist with a concen-
tration on Achaemenid Iran, and es-
pecially one with an interest in the 
reign of Darius the Great, has as-
suredly paid close attention to the 
texts and relief sculpture that came 
to be carved on the cliff face at Bi-
sotun in commemoration of Darius’ 
rise to power in 522 BC. In my own 
case, I quickly came to regard Biso-
tun as a unique store of knowledge 
to which I would need to return 
again and again.

might well ask how an individual, not 
necessarily known for totally reckless 
behavior, would manage to get him-
self into such a predicament. 
At the time I had managed to bor-
row an unusually long ladder and was 
making my first visit to the high ledge 
that runs along the base of Darius’ ex-
traordinary rock-cut monument. I tried 
to take in as many expected and unex-
pected things as I could. I found that 
Major (later Sir) Henry Rawlinson, the 
first recorded modern visitor to reach 
that narrow ledge, had in fact carved 
his name on its flat surface. 
A second visit to Bisotun, made in 
the company of Professor George 
G. Cameron, served to remind me 
still more vividly of that great site’s 
storied past. It is common knowl-
edge that Rawlinson, first in 1836 
and then again in 1847, made ex-
ceptional efforts to secure reliable 
copies of the various cuneiform 
texts.
A trip with George 
Cameron 
However, Rawlinson himself was 
never able to reach the one “unap-
proachable” overhanging rock on 
which Darius’ Babylonian inscrip-
tion had been placed. Finally, as 
Rawlinson relates, “a wild Kurdish 
boy… volunteered to make the at-
tempt.” Space does not permit a full 
description of the way in which the 
boy drove in one wooden peg on 
one side of the inscription and then 
“used the slight inequalities on the 
bare face of the precipice” to cross 
the rock and drive in a second peg 
from which, with the aid of a rope and 
a short ladder, he created “a swing-
ing seat, like a painter’s cradle.” But 
it was upon this fragile device that 
needed – and, in the early 1950’s, he 
decided to do whatever was neces- 
sary to obtain a state-of-the-art la-
tex impression. By an odd chance I 
can bear witness to certain aspects 
of this “last cuneiform adventure” 
at Bisotun. Towards the end of his 
long life, and some ten years after he 
had succeeded in obtaining his latex 
copies, Professor Cameron decided 
to revisit the Bisotun cliff. He felt the 
need for a younger companion and, 
since he already knew me, he was 
kind enough to ask me to accom-
pany him. 
After we had borrowed a long lad-
der from the oil refinery at nearby 
Kermanshah (now Bakhtaran) and, 
as we took the road back towards 
Bisotun, George Cameron told me 
how, years ago, he, too, had been 
able to find a clever helper of his 
own in a young man from the local 
village who was called Hasan. He 
described how Hasan essentially 
repeated the actions of the Kurd-
ish boy and in this way managed to 
erect a new swinging seat; and then 
he related how he carefully eased 
himself into the seat and duly paint-
ed on the latex solution before he 
waited for it to dry and then, at the 
last, peeled off the precious record. 
Finally, as we pulled up at Bisotun, 
Professor Cameron asked someone 
who was standing at the roadside 
if he could find Hasan and let him 
know that he – Cameron -- had re-
turned. In no time Hasan came in 
view: now a slim, neatly dressed 
man in his forties. Fervent greetings 
were exchanged. Then I looked 
beyond our little group to see an 
unexpected sight. It seemed that 
half the population of the village 
had gathered on the slope below 
us. The word had clearly gone out: 
“Cameron was back!”

at Berkeley (USA).

to certain aspects of this 
‘last cuneiform adventure’ 
at Bisotun.”
the boy, following Rawlinson’s direc-
tions, proceeded to make a paper 
squeeze of the Babylonian text. 
Notwithstanding the essential 
success of this perilous endea- 
vor, George Cameron, who had 
served as the epigraphist on Erich 
Schmidt’s expedition to Persepolis 
in the late 1930’s, was well aware 
that a new record of the hard-to-
reach Babylonian text was greatly

And then, out the corner of my eye, 
I spotted – on the opposite side of 
a fissure of a certain width – what 
looked like a hitherto undetected 
rock-cut fire bowl. I am interested 
in fire altars and fire bowls (two 
frequently encountered material re-
flections of Iran’s ancient Zoroastri-
an identity) and I can only think that 
thoughts of Rawlinson’s intrepid de-
termination to copy each of Darius’ 
trilingual inscriptions somehow 
made me unduly adventurous. At 
all events luck was ultimately with 
me. My eyes cleared. I pulled my-
self up. I confirmed that the putative 
fire bowl was indeed such a feature 
(even if I have no definite answer as 
to why it was placed where it was). 
And then I managed to make my 
way back, this time with a better-
judged jump, to the relative safety 
of the main ledge.

### 191691: A Bridge spanning two worlds

6The UNESCO Courier - July-August 2006
a bridge 
spanning tWo Worlds
           at the end of the 19th century, Martín alberto de palacio y elissague 
                   was given the task of building a bridge over the Nervión, 
    in the Basque country (spain), with one prerequisite: uninterrupted river traffic. 
to meet the challenge, the engineer dreamed up the first metallic bridge with a gondola.
«O  n Bilbao’s ria is the first trans-
porter bridge ever built in the 
world. It is gigantic, splendid and 
made of metal beams like the Eiffel 
tower.” These were the induce-
ments for taking us to Las Arenas 
when we were children, to see the 
Biscay Transporter Bridge, an ar-
chitectural masterpiece combining 
functionality and esthetics. 
As for my grandfather, he would 
explain that when he was a child, 
the place looked like a rubbish 
dump, and the only attraction was 
the bridge. He would also say that 
the bridge united two worlds - the 
right bank, attractive and mani-
cured, country retreat for rich peo-
ple, and the left bank, ugly and ill-
kempt, where the factory workers 
lived. 
The transporter bridge joins the 
two banks of the Nervión at its 
mouth, it is made entirely of iron 
and it is 160 metres long. Resting 
“On Bilbao’s ria is 
the first transporter bridge 
ever built in the world. 
It is gigantic, splendid 
and made of metal beams like 
the Eiffel tower.” 
on four towers 43 metres high, it 
boasts the singularity of incorpo-
rating a suspended “gondola” to 
transport passengers, vehicles 
and merchandise. 
The bridge was thought up more 
than a century ago by the Biscayan 
engineer Martín Alberto de Palacio 
y Elissague. The local authorities 
had assigned him the project of in-
venting a bridge that would make 
it possible to transport people and 
goods while still allowing naviga-
tion on the Nervión, essential for 
the region’s steel industry.
A visionary 
design
Having studied the different op-
tions that existed at the time, both 
in transport mechanisms (rails, 
barges, platforms) and types of 
bridge (lifting, swinging, high-level, 
underground), the engineer came 
up with the design, which he him-
self named the “Palacio Transporter 
Bridge”. He thus succeeded in 
meeting the double challenge put 
to him. 
The work began on 10 April 1890 
and lasted just over two years. The 
main structure was built first, then 
the transport “gondola”, compris-
ing a covered section for first-class 
passengers and an uncovered area 
A gondola is suspended high above passing ships.

for second-class travelers, mer-
chandise and livestock. 
Inaugurated in 1893, the bridge 
was the first in history with such 
characteristics. It gained interna-
tional fame and was soon com-
pared to other iron monuments, 
such as the Eiffel Tower. The en-
gineer Gustave Eiffel was in fact a 
personal friend of Palacio. 
When the Spanish civil war be-
gan in 1936, the Biscay bridge 
became a focal point for General 
Franco’s troops, intent on occu-
pying the Basque country. On 26 
April 1937, the Condor legion, a 
squadron of German planes Hitler 
had sent to Franco’s aid, bombed 
Guernica. Barely two months lat-
er, on 17 June 1937, the Northern 
Army Engineers, a Republican 
battalion defending Biscay, blew 
up the bridge to prevent Franco’s 
troops from crossing over.
Reconstruction
Its reconstruction was completed 
two years later and featured some 
technical improvements, such as 
a suspension system and cross-
bars. The bridge was back in 
working order by 1941. 
It now stands in the midst of a 
natural setting. The blue water, the 
slope of the western bank and the 
groves of trees along the shores 
seem protected by a benevolent 
colossus. 
We have grown – the contrasts be-
tween the two banks and the deca-
dent atmosphere described by my 
grandfather have gradually faded. 
The creation of the Guggenheim 
museum in 1997 modernized 
Bilbao, but the childish glee in-
spired by crossing from one side of 
the river to the other in this urban 
cable-car remains intact. My grand-
father would certainly have been 
touched to see this bridge inscribed 
on the World Heritage List.

### 191692: Harar: the past behind closed doors

8The UNESCO Courier - July-August 2006
P
                       time seems to stand still in the town of Harar (ethiopia), 
                                entrenched behind its encircling wall. 
                                     Yet the market and mosques are pulsing with life.
Harar
the past Behind closed doors
erched at an altitude of more than 
1800 metres, the town is surrounded 
by a fortified wall four metres high, 
cut through by five gates. Inside is a 
maze of 362 alleys bordered by small 
traditional houses, with broken-down 
old cars circulating wearily in their 
midst. Welcome to Harar, located 
more than 500 kilometres east of Ad-
dis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. 
Less known that other towns in 
the country like Aksum, Lalibela or 
Gondar, it is nonetheless “one of 
the rare examples of a still intact 
pre-industrial town,” notes Jara Hailé 
Mariam of the Ethiopian Authority 
for Research and Conservation of 
Cultural Heritage. The proof is in the 
incessant click-clack of old sewing 
machines heard during the day in the 
tailors’ district, and the blazing red of 
the forges gathered together in the 
district alongside the Buda gate.
Ivory and coffee 
trading
At dawn, the call of the muezzins re-
sounds in the town with 82 mosques. 
Not for nothing is Harar considered 
the fourth holiest city of Islam. In the 
16th century, it became the capital 
of an independent Muslim kingdom, 
at the price of merciless struggle 
against the Christian emperors then 
ruling the country. A significant ves-
tige of this period of rebellion is the 
encircling wall or Jugol that still sur-
rounds the city. 
As in the past, the gates are shut at 
nightfall. Each has a name: Choa ber, 
Buda ber, Erer ber, Fellana ber.
A gateway to Ethiopia
Several commodities made Harar 
famous: ivory, leather and particu-
larly coffee.
Traders would come in and out 
of the gates in the days when 
Harar was the point of access to 
Ethiopia, arriving from the Gulf of 
Aden coast. Several commodities 
made Harar famous: ivory, leath-
er and particularly coffee. Trade 
in the precious bean was in fact 
what brought an unusual travel-
ling salesman to the town at the 
end of the 19th century. His name: 
Arthur Rimbaud. The French poet 
began his stay in 1880. It was a 
time when the caravans brought 
merchandise from the Abyssinian

trading posts of the Gulf of Aden. 
When the Addis-Ababa-Djibouti 
railway line was opened at the be-
ginning of the 20th century, it her-
alded the town’s decline. 
Commerce is nonetheless alive 
and well in Harar. At the big Gidir 
Magala market, a bustling crowd 
of Somalian, Amhara and Oromo 
women draped in brightly-coloured 
garb shop for spices, vegetables, 
cotton cloth, grains and medici-
nal herbs. They are also after the 
famous khât leaves, which can 
be ingested as tea or chewed to 
produce a mildly euphoric state. 
Enough to forget that between now 
and nightfall, when the shadows 
of the minarets lengthen in the twi-
light and the gates are closed, hy-
enas will descend from the moun-
tains and encircle the town.

“This sea of agave 
stretches from the slopes 
of the Tequila mountain 
to the deep gorges carved out 
by the Santiago river.”
Asea of blue, the shade of neither 
sky nor water, with a tinge of green 
and grey, colours the austere lands 
of the Jalisco valleys. This sea of aga-
ve stretches from the slopes of the 
Tequila mountain to the deep gorges 
carved out by the Santiago river. 
From the mountain top, the kingdom 
of agave appears in all its immensity. 
The spiny plants shaped like bluish-
green stars trace well-defined lines. 
They form a vast mantle of pointy 
leaves patiently absorbing the rays 
of the sun to transform them first into

### 191702: Tequila-tinted landscape

10The UNESCO Courier - July-August 2006
They say agave is tough, like the 
people who live around it. That it 
takes root in arid lands from which 
it draws life and blooms. It is fibrous 
and resistant. Patient, but also joy-
ful. Its long and robust leaves fan out 
from their spherical stem, which they 
render almost invisible. It is the piña, 
the ball, head or heart of the agave, 
the ground-level tabernacle where 
the plant stores the juice that one day 
will be transformed into tequila.
Long-term  
harvest
You have to wait at least eight years 
for agave to mature. Then comes 
harvest time. The jimador, the per-
son in charge of the harvest, chops 
off the agave leaves one by one to 
clear the heart, which weighs at 
least 20 kilos. 
Patience. You can’t hurry nature. 
Nor the good tequila drinker. He 
knows about the number of years 
agave plants need to mature, the 
experience of the men who cut 
them one by one, the hours if not 
days of roasting, at low tempera-
ture. He knows you have to wait 
until the juice ferments, then put 
the juice through the stills the 
Spanish imported. And after that 
let it rest peacefully, in the dark and 
cool of the casks. 
That is why the good drinker sips te-
quila when he is settled in his equipal, 
large wooden armchair typical of 
the region, in the cool shade of a 
patio or terrace. He drinks it with 
the respect you give to an ances-
tor, and with the gratitude you owe 
to someone who has taught you to 
appreciate waiting. 
Agave is equally generous to chil-
dren and sober people. The piña 
is comprised of segments that are 
easily separated once it is cooked. 
The pieces, which in the heat of the 
oven take on a bright coffee colour, 
make a delicious treat. Along the 
side of the road, on town squares 
and during village fiestas, people 
sell this peculiar delicacy, which 
you chew to extract the very sweet 
juice until you are left with taste-
less fiber, which you then spit out. 
Agave is also a source of honey.
Incendiary spirit
Tequila has acquired a reputation as 
an acrid beverage. The golden age of 
Mexican cinema portrayed it as an in-
cendiary spirit that burned the throats 
of brave Mexican caballeros and in-
cited them to fight. But now finally 
tequila has shed its image as a drink 
reserved for men. It is often enjoyed 
at home with the family as a cocktail. 
Even though it can be mixed with 
sodas, connoisseurs prefer it “dry”, 
which is to say pure. They serve it in 
a caballito, a small glass designed to 
accommodate all the aromas of te-
quila, or else in little earthenware jars. 
An increasing number of women also 
appreciate it. Some mothers even 
dip their finger in tequila and rub 
their children’s gums with it to soothe 
toothache. 
In Mexico, cloudy afternoons that 
inspire contemplation and intimate 
conversation are called tardes te-
quilaras, but any day is good to sip 
this national drink, produced with pa-
tience and wisdom in the magnificent 
blue sweep of the Jalisco fields.

### 191704: Pandas roam free in China

11The UNESCO Courier - July-August 2006
                         Zhang Hemin, director of the Wolong nature reserve, 
                   a major part of the giant panda sanctuaries in sichuan. the sanctuaries, 
          one of the few places in the world where giant pandas still live in the wild, 
                         has just been inscribed on the World Heritage list.
pandas roam free 
in cHina
Interview by Weiny Cauhapé 
Why do you think 
it is important to protect 
the giant panda? 
First of all, because it is en-
dangered. At present China is 
the only country where giant 
pandas continue to live in the 
wild, with a population of only 
1,500 individuals. Beyond that, 
the existence of giant pandas 
is extremely old in the history 
of evolution, going back 12 mil-
lion years. In the middle of the 
Pleistocene, the oldest period 
of the quaternary era, the gi-
ant panda went through a pe-
riod of very rapid development. 
After an evolution of three mil-
lion years as a carnivore, the 
giant panda became a “vege-
tarian” with bamboo as its prin-
cipal food source. Outside of 
China, fossils of great pandas 
were discovered in Burma and 
Vietnam. Unfortunately, the radi-
cal change in climate proved fa-
tal to many families of pandas. 
The survivors fled to the moun-
tains and deep valleys in three 
Chinese provinces, Sichuan, 
Shanxi and Gansu, where they 
still live.
In your opinion, will being 
inscribed on the World Heritage 
List have direct consequences 
for the site? 
Certainly, because for a long time 
now, the giant pandas have been 
located in separate and scattered 
areas, or “islets”, where encounter 
and interaction between different 
groups is difficult. In this context, 
inbreeding is inevitable, which re-
sults in their having reduced ca-
pacity to adapt to environmental 
change, a lower reproductive rate 
and less resistance to disease.

### 191704: Pandas roam free in China

12The UNESCO Courier - July-August 2006
List should allow us to gradually 
extend the giant panda zone to the 
mountains in Minshan, Liangshan, 
Xianglingshan and Qinling, to cre-
ate one single reserve. The giant 
pandas will then have the opportu-
nity to free themselves from these 
“islets” and the environment will be 
greatly improved. 
Aren’t you afraid that it will also 
cause an influx of tourists
to the reserve? 
I think not. In our reserve, an eco-
tourism programme allows us to 
limit the number of visitors. In ad-
dition, the size of the area open to 
visitors represents only 1% of the 
total surface of the reserve. And 
furthermore we are setting up an 
advisory committee of recognized 
experts in environment, tourism 
and land use, which will supervise 
eco-tourism development and con-
servation.
To what extent is the local 
population involved 
in protecting the site? 
The number of inhabitants on the 
reserve at present is 4,500. We 
have carried out an awareness 
campaign. For instance, we hired 
a number of people to participate 
in monitoring patrols and manage-
ment of forest lots. In parallel, we 
have encouraged farmers to prac-
tice off-season market gardening, 
to diversify their source of revenue 
and avert excessive use of moun-
tain resources – cutting down 
trees and hunting wild animals. 
Many trees and animals have been 
saved in this way, and the giant 
pandas’ habitat protected. And we 
have also developed eco-tourism 
in a pilot area. The idea was to 
encourage people who live in the 
mountains to come down into the 
valley to take advantage of tourism 
opportunities. In exchange, they 
pledge to restore their fields to 
their original condition, as natural 
forest or bamboo forest. 
What is your relationship 
to the giant panda? 
I love this animal. I obtained a 
degree in biology, specializing 
in animals, from the University 
of Sichuan in 1983, and my first 
job, for three years, was at a gi-
ant panda observation station. 
In 1987, when I was doing my 
Master’s degree at the University 
of Idaho, I realized that in-depth 
research was being devoted to 
many ordinary species, while 
research on the giant panda, a 
rare and precious species, was 
still in its embryonic stages in 
China. When I returned to China, 
I started research with the goal 
of increasing the reproductive 
rate of giant pandas living in cap-
tivity. The idea was to increase 
the population in groups of wild 
pandas. Some of the pandas we 
raised were released and now 
live in the wild. They seem to be 
living a normal life, but to reach 
any definite conclusion, we need 
a follow-up of careful study in the 
long term.
