Women’s Rights 
and Bioethics
■ The impact of biomedical sciences 
on the status and rights of women is beyond
doubt. It opens up vast prospects for impro-
ving women’s well-being and health.
However, it can also give rise to new forms
of discrimination or constraints. Without
claiming to be exhaustive, this book 
brings together the valuable contribution 
of competent specialists who approach 
the issues from very different angles and 
take into account various socio-economic
and cultural perspectives.
Women, Power 
and the Academy
From Rhetoric to Reality
■ Has gender equality been reached?
Two main topics are examined in this volu-
me: the university as one of the key institu-
tions providing women with the education
and leadership skills necessary
for their advancement, as well as the 
the role of universities in shaping a society’s
cultural fabric, hence, the attitudes towards
women and their place in that society.
Both aspects are analysed on the basis 
of a number of case studies carried out in
Western and non-Western contexts.

◗ Violence
UNESCO’s Director-General Koïchiro
Matsuura described the Taleban’s
blasting of the Buddhas of Bamiyan
as “a crime against culture.” But
alongside this act just about
unmatched by its ostentatious nature,
a steady wave of more clandestine
archaeological plundering is going on,
and it’s robbing us of our universal
heritage. Fortunately, protection,both
at an individual and institutional level,
is gaining ground (focus, pp. 16-37).
Violence is also rife in schools, which
are sometimes the source of the
problem.As a recent international
conference underlined,no continent
or culture is spared by the
phenomenon (pp. 10-13).Our photo
spread this month turns to Liberia, a
country torn by the extreme violence
of civil war, where child soldiers are
trying to put a haunting past behind
them on the playing field (pp. 4-9).
◗ Ethics
The cloning of embryos is sparking a
virulent debate. Should they be
instrumentalized to serve as “spare
parts”for treating disease? And if so,
how will we deal with their
commercialization (pp. 38-40)? Fierce
debate divides North and South over
the environment,with developing
countries arguing that the quest to
protect our resources merely masks a
new form of imperialism (pp. 41-43).
Alain Senderens, one of France’s star
chefs, takes the debate straight to the
palate:in an age when poor diets are
the lot of the greatest number, he
stands by his refined dishes, created
for an elite (pp. 47-51).Havana’s best
cigars might also be for the elite only,
but we travel to the Viñales Valley,
where farmers tend to some of the
world’s finest tobacco leaves
(pp. 14-15).

All that football needs—a ball, a bit of space and children.

### Healing on the playing field
Far from the bright lights of the stadium, people kick
balls around on waste ground, in village squares and on
beaches where rusting warships are relics of a not so
distant past
George Weah has come a long way: from Monrovia, w h e r e
he and his 13 brothers and sisters were brought up by
their grandmother, to the World Player of the Ye a r
award and the big European leagues of Fr a n c e, Italy and
E n g l a n d ,where he has scored 150 goals in more than 300
m a t c h e s. It has been a spectacular journey.As a boy, h e
dreamed of becoming another Pele. N o w, 15 years after
he left his country, thousands of Liberian youngsters
dream of becoming another George Weah.
But it was tough at fir s t .“Every day we’d play from
morning ’til night,” he says.“ We didn’t have a coach, s o
we made it up as we went along, warming up and run-
ning around together. We all chipped in what we could
to buy kit and footballs.”
These days, George has a gold watch and drives a
M e r c e d e s.H e ’s also very generous.More than once,he has
dipped in his pocket to bail out the indebted Liberian foot-
ball federation or pay for equipment.As well as playing,
he is also the national team’s coach and sponsor. H e
knows he is an icon in A f r i c a , but that does not bother him.
“It’s normal for kids to have heroes,” he says.
L i b e r i a ’s passion for football returned only recently.
Until four years ago, the country was engulfed in a mur-
derous civil war—one of Africa’s bloodiest conflicts—
that between 1990 and 1997 killed 150,000 people and
forced nearly half the population either to flee or
become refugees in their own country (see box).
During those years, young Liberians had other
battles to wage, not with footballs but with guns, a v e n-
ging their parents or siblings and fighting as child-sol-
diers. Today, erstwhile factional rivals wear the same
team shirts,are equal before the ball and equally fervent
about the game.Thanks to television, they follow every
detail of championships in Europe and Latin A m e-
r i c a . Everybody knows who Brazilian striker Ronaldo
is and how many goals “Mister George” has scored
for Olympique de Marseilles this season.
Every game involving the national team is a big
e v e n t . Sometimes there are 20,000 more people watching
the match than the Monrovia stadium officially has
room for.“ Women and children come too,” says We a h .
“They make up about half the crowd.” Sometimes the

police have to intervene. But when Liberia wins—and they have,
r e c e n t l y, notched up surprising victories against Nigeria, Ghana and
Sierra Leone—people take to the streets to celebrate and children
wait hours at the players’ entrance in search of autographs.
But Liberians’ love affair with football is not just fan worship.
Everyone plays the game. Far from the bright lights of the stadium
and the world of million-dollar contracts,people kick balls around
on waste ground, in village squares and on beaches where rusting
warships are relics of a not so distant past. Few of these amateurs
have runners or money to buy a decent ball.They just want to play.
In a poor country without jobs or basic facilities, football may
not be the best or only cure but it’s one way forward.Weah fir m l y
believes it can make a difference: “I’m no politician,” he says,
“but when people have problems, even in countries at war, their
quarrels can be solved on the playing fie l d .We ’ve seen that a lot.”
One of football’s countless legends is that years ago, warring
Nigeria and Biafra called a truce one day just so they could see Pele
p l a y.And someone as unconventional as the French writer A l b e r t
C a m u s, who was once goalkeeper for the Algiers University team,
wrote that “everything I know about morality I owe to football.”
We a h , A f r i c a ’s all-time greatest footballer, puts it this way:
“ To achieve something,y o u ’ve got to want it.You mustn’t take drugs
and you’ve got to work hard and concentrate.” Perhaps some of
these children, fans of teams with names like Invincible Eleven and
Young Survivors, have what it takes.But with their youthful energy
and sturdy legs, what they certainly have is a thirst for a better life,
just like the boy from Monrovia who dreamt of being Pele. ■

ÉRIC DEBARBIEUX1
HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN OBSERVATORY
OF VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS

### Violence in schools: a worldwide affair
Violence in schools: a worldw i d
In all countries, schools are magnets for strife in society. Dealing with these tensions
calls for extreme caution, for fear of making matters worse
iolence in schools is a worldwide pro-
blem:it exists in rich and poor countries
a l i k e. I t ’s chiefly a male phenomenon,
hitting a peak when boys turn 16 years
old in some countries and 13 in others.
Experts agree at least on one point:this
violence cannot be pinned to a single
c a u s e. I n s t e a d , they point to complex
patterns linked to family situations, s o c i o -
economic conditions and teaching
methods.
Tackling
segregation
But these are just indicators and do
not justify any deterministic explanations.
When researchers say that 10 to 20 per-
cent of risk factors are linked to single-
parent families, this suggests that 80 to 90
percent of such families are not the source
of any violence.A child from a black slum
area with a teenage mother or a father in
jail will not automatically be violent!
L i k e w i s e, experts say there is a “ h a r d
c o r e ”of violent children—about five per-
cent of the total.But in comparing several
schools in similar problem French neigh-
b o u r h o o d s, I ’ve found that this figure can
vary between one and 11 percent. Th e
school itself can be an aggravating factor,
through high staff turnover or “ g h e t t o
c l a s s e s ” to which poorly-performing stu-
dents are relegated. These “hard core”
groups, then,cannot be deemed “inalte-
r a b l e.” On the contrary, something can
be done about them.

### Blame the system
Blame the system
Violence in schools of Francophone Africa doesn’t come from the pupils, but from
the system itself, says a Burkinabé expert
VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS: A WO R L DWIDE A F FA I R
o rd , I don’t want to go to school any
more.
P l e a s e, I beg you, take me away from
it.”
This “Prayer of a Small Black Child,”
written in the 1950s by the Guadelou-
pean author Guy Ti r o l i e n , remains sadly
relevant in black Africa,where schools
heap violence upon children from day
one.
In Burkina Faso, for example, chil-
dren have to switch from their mother
tongue to a foreign one—Fr e n c h—
without the slightest psychological
a d j u s t m e n t . From October 1 in the year
they turn seven,children are forbidden
from speaking vernacular languages—
such as Mooré, Peuhl or Dioula—a t
s c h o o l .They learn how to read and write
in a foreign tongue, through stories
about French villages with their church
bells and lessons that will teach them
more about Paris than Ouagadougou,
their country’s capital. H u m i l i a t i n g
p u n i s h m e n t , such as being forced to
wear a donkey’s skull around one’s neck
with a sign reading “ D o n k e y, s p e a k
French!”only reinforces the sense that
school is a place rife with conflict.
The school timetable is another
source of stress. The few teachers who
have the intelligence and courage to
allow a break at nine in the morning—
so that children who take animals out to
pasture at 5am can rest and have a
snack—are criticized for not respecting
the official 10:30 pause.
For the African child, society as a
whole—including the village and the
fie l d s, especially during the harvest
season—are invaluable occasions for
socialization and non-formal educa-
tion.But as soon as they enter a class-
r o o m , learning from one’s peers in the
village is over. There is no reward or
value attached to helping one another,
respecting one’s elders or the pride of
belonging to a family or clan for whose
well-being no sacrifice is too great. I n s-
tead the child is encouraged to adopt a
competitive attitude and a brazen indi-
vidualism that leads to de-personali-
zation,sometimes even to alienation.
Passive
resistance
For the moment, we only see school
violence on television. Here in Africa,
the issue is the other way round. Th e
classic school, created by the Fr e n c h
colonial rulers, is an act of violence
against the child, and against Burkinabé
society itself. Our society did not pro-
duce this school: it was imposed on us
with the clear intention of conquering
our people.
Mission accomplished? The classic
school system that has become entren-
ched in Africa has fashioned a new kind
of person, the “ t o w n i e.”This new breed
lives alongside those shaped by tradi-
tional value-systems, those who refuse to
be won over. Schools are the first to

### Blame the system
### Violence in schools: a worldwide affair
blame for this rift. In this conflict bet-
ween two approaches, the traditional
education system still holds sway.
Of course, there are not enough
schools to serve all the
c o u n t r y ’s children.
Nearly two-thirds of
Burkinabé children
have no access to
modern schools and 80
percent of adults can’t
read or write. But even
when children do go to
s c h o o l , passive resis-
tance is apparent, with
some parents in the
north and north-east of
the country pulling
them out. For rural
people, sending a child
to school entails a cul-
tural and economic
sacrifice for the family.
Relevance and
respect
Those chil-
dren who are out of the reach of modern
schools survive by the strength of their
numbers and the traditional structures
that continue to govern all aspects of
most people’s lives in Burkina Faso.
We should not indulge in nostalgia,
but confront the situation head on,
before the violence that schools inflict on
children spurs pupils to resort to vio-
l e n c e.All the seeds of violence are in the
system — discrimination, c o r p o r a l
punishment,humiliation and sexist cli-
chés in textbooks.
Introducing vernacular languages
at school and using them to teach
various subjects is one way forward.
Another is to revise curricula regularly
so that it remains relevant,and to adapt
the school calendar to the needs of
daily life. Why not, for example, plan
holidays to accommodate a child’s
initiation rituals, the passage into adul-
thood? 
The classic school is not the fin a l
w o r d . Alternatives exist. By critically
taking into account, at every level of
s c h o o l i n g, a child’s traditional and family
e d u c a t i o n , we will help to establish a
non-violent school system in Burkina
Faso and elsewhere in Africa. ■
Should they simply be expelled, a s
some advocate? Such a measure would
only make their segregation and sense of
exclusion worse.And they are, after all,
at the root of the whole problem. Th e
solution lies partly in developing custo-
mized projects, but most importantly, in
strengthening economic and social par-
ticipation.
To put an end to school violence, w e
need a well-established state with the
means to compensate for inequalities, a
state that tries to re-establish diversity in
neighbourhoods and schools, one that
does not give up on the notion of justice
for children,as some are demanding.
Passing the torch
We should also try to lift schools out
of their fortresses, so they do not become
the symbol of a society that excludes
p e o p l e.Projects in the Netherlands,B r a z i l
and the United States have shown that
schools can be vibrant places that provide
social,medical and cultural services to a
neighbourhood.
In the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais,
for example, there is a vocational school
where elderly craftsmen teach their skills
to teenagers. Such contact between gene-
rations can offer a very valuable social
e d u c a t i o n .“It takes a village to educate a
c h i l d ,” goes an African proverb. L e t ’s
make an effort to seek out these oppor-
t u n i t i e s, even in the most heartless cities.

### Karate-trained teachers lose a round
Japanese society is facing what you’ve
called an outbreak of “ u n p redictable vio-
l e n c e ” by high school students. Could you
explain?
It started in 1998 when, in the first
incident of its kind since the end of
World War II,a teacher was stabbed to
death by a 14-year-old boy. Then a
schoolboy who belonged to a gang stole
about $200,000 and a 17-year- o l d
hijacked a bus,killing the woman he had
taken hostage.Another youth,who had
been bullied, battered two fellow-pupils
with a baseball bat before going home
and killing his own mother. We had
2 2 incidents like this between 1998
and2000.
How has the public reacted?
With shock and fear. Parents feel
they no longer understand their own
c h i l d r e n . But this isn’t the first time the-
re’s been violence in or around schools.
There was another wave of it in the
1 9 8 0 s, which the government cracked
down on by hiring teachers who were
skilled at karate, judo or kendo.The aim
was to put pressure on unruly pupils,
who mostly operated in gangs, so that
classes could go on in peace.
Did this include using force?
Corporal punishment used to be
common throughout Japanese society.
But after World War II, the government
put an end to it.So offic i a l l y, such punish-
ment is forbidden, but in fact such
methods were used in schools in the
1980s, after children had received war-
nings.
Did it have any effect?
It set up a vicious circle:the repres-
sive atmosphere only increased the
sense of frustration and stress felt by
difficult children, and tension built up.
The repressed feelings exploded with
an ever greater violence, and the state
cracked down again.A l s o, the “ n o r m a l ”
children began to see this strong-fisted
p o l i cy as the example that had to be fol-
lowed.It was strictly applied (with tea-
chers even searching school bags and
confiscating snacks), until it finally
became unbearable. On the surface,
calm has been reestablished. But since
1 9 9 0 ,t h e r e ’s been an increase in physical
and psychological bullying, e s p e c i a l l y
among girls, along with extortion and
truancy.
And all this in an education system that
puts children under great pressure...
The pressure doesn’t come from the
schools, but from the parents. In Japan,
we have no natural resources, so produ-
cing skilled labour is our only source of
w e a l t h . For parents eager to see their
offspring succeed,education is an invest-

Unprecedented violence among young people is sweeping Japan. Some see it as
a reaction to an earlier crackdown, but Yodji Morita, a sociologist from Osaka
City University, criticizes the reliance on force

### Karate-trained teachers lose a round
who had grown up on the streets
returned to school during the transition
to democracy, the snail’s pace of trans-
formation meant that little or nothing
had actually changed in the classroom.
The poor or non-existent facilities, the
under-qualified teachers and the virtual
failure of racial integration stood as
powerful symbols of ongoing marginali-
zation.So it is no surprise that violence
continues. In lieu of the political resis-
tance movement,m a r g i n a l i z e d ,f r u s t r a t e d
youth found an alternative place of
belonging and social cohesion within cri-
minal youth gangs.
These gangs might only form a small
hard core, but they are teaching us a hard
l e s s o n : we must rebuild the social fabric so
decimated by our Apartheid past. S c h o o l s
provide a vital point of access to young
people who are both the primary perpe-
trators and victims of violence today.The
school is also a contested terrain,p r e c i s e l y
because of the fine line separating youth at
risk inside the classroom and those whose
criminality has been consolidated on the
other side of the fence. It is a very fin e
line, drawn in the dusty sand of township
l i f e. Crime prevention strategies frequently
fail to recognize how easily this line may be
crossed.
Our first initiatives began as a trauma
management programme in Soweto
s c h o o l s, helping teachers identify and
assist those children who might,for ins-
tance, be victims of domestic violence.
This did not happen easily:teachers are
often reluctant to take on issues of school
safety and violence prevention. Th e y
have to be empowered through proper
training and know where to refer trou-
bled children. From this narrow focus
on trauma, we have developed a more
all-encompassing strategy to prevent
school violence. One of most important
lessons we have learned is that students
must be listened to: they know exactly
where crimes are taking place within
and outside the school, and often suggest
practical solutions, such as putting up
lighting here or cutting the grass in a
nearby field.
Going beyond security concerns, we
have stressed the community’s role in
reducing violence.We have set up safety
teams involving teachers, s t u d e n t s,
p a r e n t s, civic organizations and other
local actors, and built better relationships
with the local police. We have encou-
raged schools in dangerous areas to link
with one another.At a broader level,we
have spearheaded multimedia projects,
notably several TV drama series on
human rights, racism and violence in
s c h o o l s, which are aired at prime time.
Taking stock of this holistic approach,
the government has recently tuned into
these and other grassroots initiatives to
tackle school crime more effectively.Th e
idea is not to fence off the school,but to
build bridges with communities and
recreate a sense of belonging in society.

### South Africa: beyond exclusion
South A f r i c a : beyond exclusion
During the apartheid era, township schools were sites of violent political
struggle. Today, they are all too often at the mercy of criminal activity. The
answers lie with society as a whole, not just the school
VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS: A WO R L DWIDE A F FA I R
But unlike in many industrialized coun-
tries, family and community ties are still
very strong. Do they help to reduce the
violence?
Compared with other rich countries,
our crime rate is very low, as is school
violence. That’s why the 1998 outbreak
was such a shock. It was seen as a sign of
impending social change. In the past,
you had to be self-effacing and melt into
the group. Modern Japan is becoming
more individualistic.
What can people running the schools do?
Respect the children by giving them
a sense of responsibility. Encourage them
to help each other in new ways. This is
what current educational reforms are
aiming at. ■
Idealt drugs at school,”“Pupil shot for cell
phone,” “Depression might have led to
suicide of 11-year-old boy,” “ S t u d e n t s
seek revenge for teacher killing.”This is
just a sampling of a few recent headlines
in South African newspapers.Youth gangs
are intruding into the schools of vulne-
rable communities, using them as mar-
kets for drugs, a l c o h o l , weapons and
young girls, who are being abducted and
raped.
No effective strategy for preventing
violence in schools can be developed unless
we understand the legacy of apartheid.
Under this regime, young black high school
children were the barometer of systematic
marginalization and powerlessness.
The education system was designed as
a means of colonial control,and delibera-
tely aimed at preparing students to be no
more than “hewers of wood and drawers of
w a t e r ” to service the affluent white-owned
i n d u s t r y.The school was oppressive, but it
also became a site of highly politicized
s t r u g g l e, a vehicle through which young
black people could assert their stake and
role in society. Many youths established
an alternative subculture in which the rites
of passage and means of acquiring status
were often premised on proving them-
selves through direct involvement in vio-
l e n c e. It was noble to be on the wrong side
of illegitimate laws. Violence was socially
approved in the name of liberation: t h e
heroes of the day were young men who
carried guns and fought.
Although many of these youngsters
Students must be
listened to: they know
exactly where crimes
are taking place.

### Lost in the smoke of time
Lost in the smoke
of time
The Viñales Valley, near the western tip of Cuba, is a magical landscape of hills
and caves where life centres on growing tobacco. A Cuban writer recalls
discovering this World Heritage site through books well before setting foot there
n the west side of the Cordillera de Gua-
n i g u a n i c o, at the foot of the Sierra de
los Órganos, lies a region of limestone
outcrops known as m o g o t e s.These huge
round-topped hummocks rising out of
the ground emerged from the sea more
than two million years ago and were
formed during the Jurassic period.
B o r n in the vicissitudes of history,
the land still bears the marks of preci-
pices, chasms and seams carved out by
erosion.
Tobacco grows in the valley—strange
red leaves almost starved by the salty
soil but brought to life by permanent
sunshine.
I always dreamed of the Vi ñ a l e s
Valley but never ventured there. I n
school I could touch the lush tobacco
leaves pictured in textbooks and see the
Tobacco requires careful attention: some say the plants grow best when farmers talk to them.

The Viñales Valley has been
on UNESCO’s World Heritage List
since November 1999 as a cultural
landscape enriched by traditional farm
and village architecture. Old-fashioned
farming methods are still used
in Viñales, notably to grow tobacco. The
local population is an ethnic mix that
illustrates the cultural development of
the Caribbean and Cuba in particular.

### Lost in the smoke of time
caterpillars that live off them, slowly and
avidly taking on the aroma of tobacco
before devouring the plant.My life was
that of the concrete city, though the sen-
sation left by dew on my hand was so
strong that I still recall it as if it were
r e a l . The leaf, bright and green like a
c h i l d , turns a deep toasted brown before
it is smelt, chewed or burnt, becoming
like time itself and ending up, in old age,
as wisps of smoke.
Farmers, most of whom came from
the Canary Islands, arrived around 1800
and began cultivating tobacco across the
r e g i o n , which is commonly known as the
Vuelta Abajo.Two hundred years later,
tobacco is still the lifeblood of the
Viñales Valley, which produces 661,000
quintals of it every year. Only the best
leaves get sent to Havana, where hun-
dreds of workers called torcedores and
a n i l l a d o r e s handroll them into cigars.
Cuba produces 65 million cigars a year,
packed in cedarwood boxes and
exported to the entire world.
Growing tobacco calls for patience.
Some even say that the plant grows
better if you speak to it. Once the
seeds are sown (between October and
D e c e m b e r ) , the moment to reap and
pack is of critical importance,marking all
the difference between acidity, s o u r n e s s
or waste-product.
The valley is like its tobacco—dis-
creet, thrifty and tranquil, stuck in the
same serene pocket of time as its villa-
gers.
People who have never been to the
Viñales Va l l e y, in the Cuban province of
Piñar del Río, should know that it
boasts a unique variety of plant and
animal life, some of it in danger of
extinction, such as the cork palm, the
a g a b e, the macusey hembra, the alli-
gator oak and the dragon tree. Unac-
customed to the ways of civilization
and to music unlike their own songs, t h e
valley’s birds also come in a kaleido-
scope of species, with names as evoca-
tive as the pine-forest grass quit, t h e
mockingbird and the totí.
Exploring caves
to the tune of haunting tales
It was here that the Guanajatabey
Indians built their primitive homes in
caves hollowed out of the limestone
mogotes, where relics of this nomadic
people have been found along with fos-
sils of Pleistocene mammals embedded
in the rock. Deep inside the caves,
albino fish swim and butterfly
bats flit.
Some caverns, such as the
Cueva del Indio, r e d i s c o v e r e d
in 1920, have close to four
kilometres of underground
streams which can be
explored in a small dinghy so
long as you don’t mind liste-
ning to all the scary tales the
peasant guides love to
recount.
As the streams slowly
work through the limestone
and mix with the mogote clay
falling from above, t h e y
become solutions of minerals
and coppery earth, both of
which are then deposited on
the roofs and walls of the
c a v e s, turning the surfaces
ochre milky green,rendering
the scenery all the more mys-
terious.
We are only 150 kilo-
metres from Havana,but mil-
lions of years away.
Where Nature
invites painters
to take place
Returning to Viñales is a
bit like returning to a
m u s e u m .A silence hangs over
i t , a mysterious calm that
dwells in the early morning
m i s t . In Viñales village we visit
a church built in the last century with
sombre pews that have been repaired
countless times. The musty odour
mingles with the smell of warmed-up
food. Heavy rainfall in the wet season
has spoiled the splendid facades of the
h o u s e s, which now look like faded
mosaics.
And Cuban hands, always touching
and caressing things, cherishing the past,
have worn out the fine wooden railings
at the front of the houses.As in every vil-
lage in my country, Viñales also has a
central square—a byword for order amid
confusion.
Four kilometres from the village, on
one side of the Dos Hermanas ( Two Sis-
ters) mogote, stands the Mural of Pre-
h i s t o r y, a impressive 120-metre high
fresco painted by Cuban artist Leovi-
gildo González,disciple of the Mexican
muralist Diego Rivera. Depicted are the
animals and other creatures that lived in
the valley in prehistoric times.
People who have not read the poem
of José Lezama Lima (1912-76), Bajo el
arco de Vi ñ a l e s (Beneath the arch of
Viñales), or have never seen the pain-
tings of Cuban artist Domingo Ramos or
contemplated the Mural of Prehistory,
should know that this valley, which rose
from the bottom of the ocean near the
western tip of the island, is above all a
place of art, a site where Nature pro-
vides the frame and waits for the painter
to be seated.
But how does one take leave of the
valley? Through its cliffs, its hollows?
Through the passage in a mogote and its
columns of gentle stalagmites? Through
the long line of big-belly palm trees with
their fiery plumes lit by summer? Th r o u g h
its chattering streams full of blind fish?
Through the echoes of cockfights left in
an old sugar factory? Or through a cheap
painting on the yellow wall of a restaurant
somewhere in Havana’s tourist district?
Which path home is best? ■

he destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afgha-
nistan has sparked worldwide indignation (pp. 24-25). In
committing this act, the Taleban violated a rule that is
now proving universal, namely that works of the past
belong to all humanity. As such, this heritage must be pro-
tected, first and foremost because it sheds light on our
origins and constitutes the building blocks of our iden-
tities.
For these same reasons, the plundering of tre a s u re s
f rom any civilization, exacerbated by the illicit art market, has become unac-
ceptable. Lyndel Prott, head of UN E S C O’s cultural heritage division, chro n i c l e s
the rise of this awareness (pp. 18-21).
A flurry of initiatives is proof of this new outlook. Mali (pp. 26-27) is stri-
ving to involve villagers in protecting the country’s heritage, just as Per-
uvian archaeologist Walter Alva has successfully done at the Sipán arc h a e o-
logical site (pp. 34-35). In the United States, museums are re t u rn i n g
symbolically charged artefacts to Native Indians, their rightful owners
(pp. 28-29). On the law enfor-
cement front, European police
a re boosting their co-operation
(pp.30-31). Thanks to investi-
gations by the hard-nosed Tu r-
kish journalist Özgen Acar, we
know that works laundered by
m a fia-ridden networks can end
up in some of the world’s most
prestigious museums (pp. 36-
37). In deciding to re t u rn to
Italy three prized arc h a e o-
logical pieces of questionable
p rovenance, the Californ i a -
based Getty Museum stands as
a pioneer (pp. 32-33). Slowly
but surely, big players on the
art scene are changing their
ways.

### A Skewed battle
Everyone in Cambodia is aware that
the country’s national heritage must be
s a f e g u a r d e d . Financial and human
r e s o u r c e s, h o w e v e r, are sorely lacking, a n d
achievements fall far short of intentions.
To date, the greatest progress has been
made in protecting the site of Angkor and
the heritage of Siem Reap province. Since
UNESCO put Angkor on the World Heri-
tage List in 1992 and Cambodia passed a
heritage protection act in 1996, s e v e r a l
steps have been taken.These include divi-
ding the area into five protection zones,
creating a special agency for the protec-
tion of heritage and setting up a govern-
mental authority (Apsara) to manage heri-
tage throughout the province. In theory at
least,we have legal instruments to help us
manage the site.
But we must not delude ourselves. L o o-
ting and pillaging have not been completely
wiped out in the Angkor archaeological
park. In the rest of Siem Reap province,
plundering sometimes takes on dramatic
p r o p o r t i o n s. Public opinion focuses only
on major sites. But how many small brick
and sandstone temples are being damaged
forever!  A case in point is the Roluos
region,15 kilometres from Angkor:all the
“minor”sites have been looted.
Besides vandalism, another kind of
damage is threatening the site’s sacred
value. Recently, UNESCO’s World Heri-
tage Committee sounded the alarm when
karaoke bars were built in an area that
theoretically enjoys the highest degree of
p r o t e c t i o n . This phenomenon is directly
linked to the growing number of visitors,
which is increasing much faster than the
development of tourist infrastructures. N e w
buildings must not only meet visitors’ needs,
but also respect the nature of this site,
where the sacred character of the monu-
ments and village life are one and the same.
And what about the rest of Cambodia,
which is not lucky enough to receive sup-
port, like Angkor, from an international
co-ordination committee (ICC) or benefit
from the same protection measures?  Here
again,attention is focused only on major
s i t e s. But Cambodia is strewn with
archaeological remains, and few have
escaped illegal excavations. I ’ll mention
just one case, the necropolis in the village
of Snay, which was openly and publicly
plundered.
Fine crafts and the know-how they
require are not safe either. There is a thri-
ving market for antique silks, l o o m s,
tobacco-cutting boards, traditional lutes
and old copper utensils. Even more serious
is the fate of manuscripts made of wads of
latania trees, which some antique dealers
cut up to maximize their profits. Antique
ceramics are openly sold in shops in Phnom
Penh and along the Thai border. It is true
that many Cambodian antique dealers sin-
cerely believe that only stone items are
protected by the law.
Does this mean that the royal govern-
ment is looking the other way? Of course
n o t . But Cambodia,which has been devas-
tated by a long period of war and revolu-
tion,needs time to re-establish the rule of
l a w. A n d , without seeming overly pessi-
mistic, it must be acknowledged that the
country has been overwhelmed by the pro-
blem.
In short, there is a long way to go.C a m-
bodia cannot cope with the plundering of its
art and artefacts without international
c o o p e r a t i o n .The problem’s source lies ups-
t r e a m , in the demand from Japan and above
all,western countries. Pieces of Khmer art
taken out of the country illegally have been
known to surface in prestigious museums
around the world. The agreement signed
two years ago by the United States and the
royal government to limit imports of
Khmer art works is important.It is a step
forward that should be emulated by other
countries. ■

### Indiana Jones has no future
“Indiana Jo n e s
has no future ”
Even though the plundering goes on, a collector who purchases a piece
with dubious provenance can no longer live with a clear conscience, says
Lyndel Prott, director of Unesco’s Cultural Heritage Division
1 . THE COST OF LOOT I N G
O
wning stolen works will soon be as
o b j e c t i o n able as wearing fur or smo-
king in public,” the American magazine
Art & Auction wrote recently. Do you
agree?
I t ’s true that the climate is changing. M o r e o v e r, i t ’s
not just a simple matter of saying the right thing.
More and more, looting is seen as morally indefensible.
And yet,the plundering goes on.
Sometimes it’s even getting worse.This is the case
in countries destabilized by war, such as A f g h a n i s t a n ,
of course—where pillaging takes place on a massive
scale in addition to destruction— but also in Cambodia
and Iraq. Bas-reliefs from Sennacherib’s palace in
Nineveh have been turning up in western countries for
several years.
What’s more, looters are acting on a large scale
because of the technical means they’re using.The t o m-
b a r o l i of southern Italy are ransacking archaeological
sites with earth-moving equipment.Treasure hunters
equipped with metal detectors in Icklingham, Great
Britain,have unearthed Roman bronzes, which were
sold to a private collector in the United States. In Cen-
tral A m e r i c a , they have electric generators and circular
saws to steal Mayan stele. In China,underwater sites
off the Xisha islands are attacked with dynamite.
Devastated cemeteries in Jordan, mutilated idols in
Nepal and wrecked Buddhist stupas in Pakistan attest
to the scope of demand in the northern countries.
H ow would you explain the growth of the art
market in the northern countries?
I t ’s a combination of factors. In the United States,
nearly a decade of steady growth has given a new
impetus to speculation on art. F u r t h e r m o r e, m a j o r
museum exhibitions have introduced long-overlooked
cultures to the public: collectors are increasingly
numerous and their interest is diversifying. M o r e
generally, cultural consumption occupies a prepon-
derant place in the economy.
Would you like to see this market regulated?
U N E S C O encourages the movement of art works
provided they have a determined provenance. What
w e ’re fighting against is the illicit trade,which requires
calling certain traditions into question. If you sell a
piece of land or a car, the buyer asks you for a deed or
registration papers. That’s not the case with cultural
property. It’s an exception.
Where does that come from? 
An aura of prestige surrounds the art market,
where people think it would be unseemly to ques-
tion collectors’ integrity. The confidentiality of tran-
sactions is still the rule. For generations up to the
1990s, diplomats acquired and unlawfully exported
important works.That kind of behaviour supposedly
reflected their interest in culture. At the same time,
INTERPOL has told us that operations against drug
t r a f ficking have led to the seizure of several hundred
p a i n t i n g s. In criminal circles, art is a nameless, r e l i a b l e
means of payment which keeps its value over long per-
iods.
Despite all that, you say mentalities are changing.
Up for grabs:in Bogota,a public sale of looted pre-Colombian ceramics.

### Indiana Jones has no future
Today, this reality no longer goes unnoticed.The
media report on looting and illicit trade.And rightly
s o, because these deeds fill us with outrage. A col-
lector who purchases a piece with a questionable pro-
venance can no longer live with a really clear
conscience. What’s more, a series of steps has been
taken to curtail trafficking. Individuals, institutions,
national minorities and States are the driving forces
behind these initiatives. At this level, the main ins-
trument in the fight against looting is the 1970 Conven-
tion drafted by UNESCO(see box).
Is the Convention enough to cope with the pro-
blem? 
It has gone a long way to help change mentalities.
In the early 1970s, museum curators would say,“Our
job consists of putting together the most beautiful
collections possible. UNESCO should be helping us
instead of putting obstacles in our way.” Today, very
few curators see things that way. Most museums have
adopted the code of conduct drafted by the Interna-
tional Council of Museums (I C O M) , which cooperates
closely with U N E S C O.It requires the museum not to
acquire, or display pieces without good provenance.
Sometimes, museums also ask us for information
on the provenance of a certain piece they would like
to acquire. This notably happened when we sent out
s p e c i fic warnings with regard to pieces from Cam-
bodia,Iraq and Afghanistan.
Has public opinion also changed?
Ye s. In the 1980s, the media challenged the
“Indiana Jones”mentality, unscrupulous hunting for
treasures of all kinds, by explaining the problems loo-
ting creates for the countries concerned.At the same
time, non-governmental organizations have decided
to react.I’m especially thinking of the Berne Decla-
ration, a Swiss NGO that manages educational and
economic projects in the southern countries. Th i s
group saw the extent to which looting has become a
cause of cultural alienation for people living in the
countries where it is ongoing.So it published fir s t - h a n d
accounts of the human consequences of cultural heri-
tage loss. In Switzerland, a major art-market country,
a change in attitude has been observed since these
steps were taken.We ’re still in this stage; many coun-
tries are acknowledging that looting is not just some-
body else’s problem.
H ave opinion campaigns linked to the re s t i t u t i o n
of property looted by the Nazis helped raise people’s
awareness?
Ye s,of course. In the 1980s,public opinion realized
1 9 8 1 . S o t h e b y ’s announced the “Sevso tre a s u re” auction.
The value of this Roman silverware service, a prime example
of late Roman style, is put at $10 million. But the Lebanese
export certificates were forgeries, and the tre a s u re was
seized in New York. The investigation laid the blame on
Sotheby’s.
Today, the origins of the Sevso treasure remain unknown.
None of the countries claiming the silver, including Lebanon,
Hungary and Croatia, has been able to prove that it may
have been looted from their territory. The investigation was
abandoned, and the treasure was given back to its English
owner.
1 9 9 0 . During the Biennale des Antiquaires show in Paris,
F rench law enforcement officers seized a painting by the
17th-century Dutch master Franz Hals from the stand of New
York’s Newhouse Galleries. The work came from the outs-
tanding collection formed in the 19th-century by an Alsatian
J e w, Adolphe Schloss. In 1943, the Nazis, assisted by the
French police, seized the collection. Half was recovered in
1945. After that, the Franz Hals work, one of the missing pain-
tings, was sold at auction four times (by both Sotheby’s and
C h r i s t i e ’s) without raising the slightest question about its pro-
venance, even when it was accompanied by the comment,
“Schloss collection, stolen by the Nazis.” Accused of re c e i v i n g
stolen goods, the American gallery owner Adam Williams
must appear in a French court in May 2001: a first in the
trafficking of art works.
2000. In April 2000, the French press revealed that three Nok
s c u l p t u res from looted sites in Nigeria were on display at the
L o u v re ’s new “first arts” museum. Stéphane Martin, the
museum’s director, justifies the 2.5-million-franc ($357,000)
purchase. “We knew perfectly well under what conditions
they had left Nigeria,” he says. “They’re still masterpieces. It’s
better to show them to the public than to leave them in a
c e l l a r.” Martin says that the Louvre and the Nigerian govern-
ment signed an agreement authorizing the purchase. But in
November, Lord Colin Renfrew, director of Cambridge Uni-
versity’s McDonald archaeological institute, accused France
of trafficking. Then, Nigeria’s ambassador to France, Edward
Abiodun Aina, said, “there is no agreement on the acquisition
of these pieces,” clearing the way for a restitution request.

1 . THE COST OF LOOT I N G
the scope of the looting. It resulted from a huge injus-
tice and could no longer go unnoticed.This has worked
in our favour: if art dealers and museums had adopted
the principles set down by the U N E S C O C o n v e n-
t i o n , they never would have reached that point,
because the illegal origin of many of the works
concerned was known. From that point on, if the rules
of restitution must be applied to Europe, they are
good for the rest of the world as well.
Do art dealers agree to these principles? 
Some professionals are changing.In Great Britain,
art dealers have taken part in an interministerial com-
mittee which recommended, after completing its work,
that the United Kingdom join the 1970 Convention.
In Switzerland, the market’s reputation has been
marred by the retention of cultural—or other—pro-
perty looted during the Second World Wa r. Fa c e d
with the rise of public awareness, dealers have seen
where their interests lie.And they don’t rule out that
the country will join the UNESCOConvention.
H i s t o r i c a l l y, the creation of collections responds to
a desire for knowledge of past civilizations. In your
eyes, is this concern still legitimate?
Ye s, but today we have greater respect for cultural
“
The interchange of cultural property among nations incre a s e s
the knowledge of the civilization of Man and enriches the
cultural life of all peoples…” says the preamble of the 1970 Conven-
tion. Advocates of controlling the market are not opposed to the
movement of cultural pro p e r t y. They are against illicit trade, which
involves pieces of undetermined provenance. This crucial point
made, here’s why their adversaries’ arguments do not stand up
upon close examination. 
Only the market gives works value. Without a market, heritage is
neglected. 
Wrong. Many pieces without any commercial value are of primor-
dial interest to archaeologists. For example, simple shipboard s
analyzed via dendrochronology (the study of the growth rings of
t rees), are used to date shipwrecks. More o v e r, fluctuation in sales
prices often bear no relationship to a work’s aesthetic qualities or
historic interest. For example, a price surge sometimes leads to a
spate of forgeries followed by total depreciation. To d a y, the prices
of Daum and Gallé Art Nouveau vases have fallen to an all-time low. 
The defenders of heritage encourage a nationalist reaction against
a more universal conception of culture.
Each country should be entitled to keep a re p resentative ensemble
of its heritage, which is an integral part of its identity. This principle
does not call into question the free movement of works with a
lawful provenance, nor does it violate the universalistic conception
of culture in any way. Furthermore, archaeological looting is a
form of theft, so it is legitimate for countries to combat it: those still
rich with archaeological sites, such as Turkey, Italy and Greece, or
those that have lost almost everything, such as the Samoa islands,
Bangladesh and Mali.
Because of political instability or the corruption of elites, some coun -
tries are incapable of preserving their heritage. The pieces are
better off in the collections of northern countries.  
After a rash of thefts from several museums in Nigeria last year,
Frank Willett, a highly regarded Scottish expert on that country,
urged collectors not to restitute pieces that resurface on the market
and accused the authorities of complicity in the robberies. The
argument is not lacking in merit, but it overlooks an essential part
of the problem. Tr a fficking, and the corruption that it implies,
exists to meet demand. There is a market of course, but what’s most
important, is its tradition of confid e n t i a l i t y, against which the
advocates of control are campaigning. The solution: museums and
private collectors with unscrupulous acquisitions policies could
invest the same sums to fund official archaeological excavations.
For example, the U.S.-based Packard Foundation has earmarked $5
million for archaeological research in Zeugma, Turkey, helping to
p revent the looting that has plagued this great site of Roman
mosaics until now.
What entitles archaeologists to prevent poverty-stricken farmers
from looting their ancestors’ graves if that enables them to feed
their families?
Looting does not feed the looters. Several years ago, an Indian farmer
sold a freshly-exhumed idol to a local middleman for 12 pounds ster-
ling ($7.50). Three years later, the same item was sold at a London auc-
tion for 300 000 pounds sterling ($188,000). On the contrary, maintai-
ning a site constitutes an economic resource for local populations. ■

d i v e r s i t y.Aside from items produced by other cultures,
we’re also interested in their approach,their percep-
tion of the world.The United States, New Zealand and
Au s t r a l i a , which share a colonial past, have ended up
understanding that they must involve ethnic minori-
ties in the management of their collections, by not
exhibiting certain sacred pieces or by respecting cus-
t o m s.Acquisitions linked to colonialism, based on an
aesthetic appreciation, but which ignore the damage,
the uprooting caused to the other culture, are being
questioned.
What can the source countries do to curb traffic-
king? 
Estimates put the share of looted pieces that are
recovered at five to ten percent. Not more. I t ’s obvious

The UN E S C O Convention on “the means of
p rohibiting and preventing the illicit import,
export and transfer of ownership of cultural
property” culminated a long period of rising
awareness. As early as 1921, the Sèvres treaty
was the first attempt to control the movement
of archaeological pieces in the Middle East. 
When many countries around the world
acceded to independence in the 1960s, the
former colonies wanted to obtain the restitu-
tion of their heritage, or at least to stop the loo-
ting. Nigeria, China and Indonesia were very
active. So was Greece, which had undergone
plundering for over a century.
To d a y, the 91 states that are parties to the
Convention agree to oppose the import, export
and transfer of stolen cultural property and
to the principle of their restitution. They also
a g ree to impose rules on museums and dealers
to wipe out trafficking. 
For a long time, the main art-market countries
have expressed their misgivings about the
Convention. Among them, the United States
was the first signatory, but not until 1983. 
A second convention was planned to over-
come their reluctance. The document was
drafted by Unidroit, the International Institute
for the Unification of Private Law, an inde-
pendent intergovernmental organization
whose purpose is to standardize the private law
of states in various fields. When this instru-
ment was finalized in 1995, many countries
complained that it was even more restrictive,
and began taking the necessary steps to sign
the 1970 Convention. 
France ratified the Convention in 1997. Bel-
gium and Switzerland, two of the leading art-
market nations, are among the 13 countries
on the verge of joining. Great Britain and Japan
are reviewing the terms of their ratification. 
The Convention is not re t roactive, so it cannot
be used to settle past disputes, such as the
disagreement between Greece and Great Bri-
tain over the Elgin marbles. To resolve more
recent conflicts, the 1970 Convention has set up
an intergovernmental committee for the re t u rn
of cultural property to its country of origin,
which acts as a mediator. For example, the
that those countries bear the main responsibility for
p r o t e c t i o n . Around the world, we bring countries
together in regional workshops, first of all to help
them set up networks between law enforcement
agents, customs officers and museum curators.When
they don’t work together, their efforts are less effec-
t i v e.We also turn to consultants who help to improve
national laws. And we help these countries draw up
i n v e n t o r i e s. Recently we held a workshop in Vi e t
N a m .The city of Hanoi alone boasts over 700 pagodas
and temples housing thousands of valuable pieces.
Most of them have not been inventoried.A Chinese
expert gave a talk that got the undivided attention of
l i s t e n e r s. Viet Nam is opening up to tourism, h e
e x p l a i n e d . You should adopt methods of control
before it’s too late. China went through the same
experience and, in a few years, looting reached a scale
that nobody could have foretold.
But can looting be stopped? People living in impo-
verished rural areas have an immediate economic
interest in excavating.
Ye s, they do. But once again, the trend can be
reversed. In Peru, for example, where tomb-raiding
was rampant, Walter A l v a ’s initiative has changed
things (see p. 30).He sat down with the Indians and
e x p l a i n e d ,“ These are your ancestors.”We ’re doing all
we can to help raise awareness. As soon as the local
population is convinced of the importance of cultural
heritage, they become a site’s best curators. ■

### Stealing the past from under our feet
Stealing the past fro m
under our feet
Driven by an insatiable demand for artefacts, looters are all too often
beating archaeologists to ancient sites and snatching our only chance
to understand bygone cultures
1 . THE COST OF LOOT I N G
B
ecause archaeologists don’t know where it
l i e s, a major Mayan city in the jungle of
Guatemala has simply been nicknamed
“Site Q.” The site obviously exists, s i n c e
sections of wall carvings from its temple
pyramids have been recognized in private collections
and museums around the world. But such pieces are
not enough to reconstruct a culture. In those that left
no written traces, like the trading society that flo u r i s h e d
in Mali some 1,000 years ago, the loss is all the more
a c u t e, since archaeology offers our only chance to
understand the past (see p. 2 6 ) . According to esti-
m a t e s, nearly half of Mali’s ancient sites have been
looted for their beautiful terracotta statues: history is
literally disappearing from beneath the people’s feet.
Since ancient times, tombs have been robbed
and cultural heritage destroyed by treasure hunters.
In recent decades, however, demand for collectable
and saleable artefacts has become insatiable, a n d
looting of the world’s archaeological record has rea-
ched epidemic proportions. Developments in tech-
nology and communication,combined with sophis-
ticated smuggling networks, have made modern loo-
ting an awesomely efficient,global industry. Whole
sites are destroyed to recover select items that fetch
vast sums in the West,where they may be valued as
objects of art, financial investments or interior design.
But antiquities are worth more than this:when
properly excavated they offer a window on history.
Archaeological sites are a non-renewable resource:
they can only be dug once, and the opportunity must
be wisely used. When an object is looted, i r r e p l a-
ceable details of its provenance (where it was found)
and context (what it was found with) are lost.Such
details are crucial if we are to glean information
about times past. Looters in South America have
described throwing dozens of ancient mummies over
cliffs when cutting them open reveals no silver or
gold.In doing so, they discard important sources of
historical information, like q u i p u, the knotted strings
which the Inca used to record official accounts. M a n y
other materials deemed worthless by looters, such as
bones, broken pottery, perishable organic remains
and the soil itself, offer invaluable clues on entire cul-
In Colombia,students glean clues on their heritage during a visit to the Cucuta archaeological museum.

t u r e s. Constantly improving scientific techniques are
further enhancing our understanding. Analysis of
ancient teeth,for instance, can tell us where indivi-
duals spent their childhood, while other human
remains can reveal the ingredients of their diets.
Shattered skulls can be reconstructed so that we can
look into the faces of our ancestors, while DNA stu-
dies can establish their relationships with each other
and ourselves. Analysis of residues on apparently
unremarkable pots proves what and how people
were cooking, brewing or manufacturing.With access
to undisturbed contexts, archaeologists also gain
insights into broader questions relevant to our past,
such as when humans first settled down to cultivate
the land.Shadows of shard marks have been unco-
vered in carefully excavated soils from very early
contexts, complemented by studies of ancient plant
remains. Such details might also be relevant to our
future:in England,studies of marine remains in the
River Ouse, for instance, have tracked pollution
levels over the past 1,900 years.
When we only have unprovenanced material to
s t u d y, our understanding of ancient peoples is limited
and distorted: P e r u ’s pre-Inca Moche culture is a
case in point. For decades, scholars struggled to com-
prehend this advanced civilization on the basis of
“ a r t ” objects which appeared on the market,
orphaned from their past. Th e n , in 1987, l o o t e r s
broke into a tomb in a massive mud-brick pyramid
at Sipán.Archaeologists were alerted and, for the fir s t
t i m e, were able to examine an undisturbed royal
Moche burial site.This single excavation transformed
our entire understanding of the culture. F u r t h e r-
m o r e, contextual evidence proved that previously
k n o w n , but unprovenanced, objects had been misun-
derstood and could now be re-interpreted, e v e n
identified as fakes.
When looters swipe
an entire site
Similar problems face scholars studying the dis-
tinctive white marble figurines found in bronze age
graves in the Cyclades Islands, Greece. Some 1,600
figurines are known, but only about 150 have a secure
archaeological provenance. Since it is impossible to
date marble by scientific means, experts are unable
to rule out the possibility that a considerable number
may be fakes, produced in the last 30 years to feed
booming demand.This further obscures attempts to
make sense of these extraordinary objects.
It is impossible to tell how much information is
being lost.One study suggests that Italian tombaroli
must loot nine tombs to recover one Apulian vase
(more than 4,000 have surfaced, u n p r o v e n a n c e d ,
since 1980).At Wanborough (England), looters came
at night with metal detectors and trucks and removed
much of the site of a Roman temple—soil and all—
to excavate at their leisure. In some cases, whole cul-
tures are only known to looters.G u a t e m a l a ’s “Site Q”
is one example. S i m i l a r l y,outstanding formative pots
from an unknown culture in the mountainous
Marañon River region of Peru are today offered for
sale in Europe.They are beautiful, but we have no idea
of their true historic signific a n c e,or of the information
lost during their retrieval.Th i s, rather than ownership
issues, is the archaeologists’ main concern.
Attracting tourist dollars
with buried riches
Ownership issues, however, are of prime impor-
tance to governments, most of whom impose some
form of sovereign claim over archaeological material,
making illegal excavation, or removal abroad, a
c r i m e. Many archaeologically rich countries are eco-
nomically poor. Expending valuable resources to
police cultural heritage is impossible, but they often
recognize archaeology, and the understanding of the
past it can provide, as a source of national identity and
pride, as well as a much-needed economic resource.
Lebanon recently inventoried vast numbers of anti-
quities and sites looted during years of civil war,
noting that its rich archaeological heritage is com-
parable to other Arab nations’ oil resources in terms
of potential tourist income.
In rare cases where recently looted material is
r e p a t r i a t e d , authorities are increasingly aware of
the value of returning it to regional museums, pre-
ferably created with local people, for whom looting
is often a way of life and essential source of family
income. At Sipán, for instance, a new museum has
been built quite near the site, which has now become
a tourist attraction (see p. 30). Cafés and souvenir
shops have sprung up. More money is generated in
tourist dollars, for whole communities, than the indi-
vidual looters could have dreamt of. Museums like
this are more than sources of pride and revenue:
they are crucial educational tools for both locals and
t o u r i s t s. At the opening of the European Union-
assisted museum at Cambodia’s Angkor Borei, l o c a l
people reacted with awe, fascination and sometimes
devotion.Younger people said they had never seen
such sculptures (antiquities in war-torn Cambodia
have been thoroughly ransacked in recent years and
local museums are uncommon), nor realized their
town’s importance.
Therein lies our most powerful weapon against
modern looting: increased awareness that people’s
cultural heritage is worth more, in every sense,
than the usually paltry sums it fetches when sold to
local middlemen, or huge amounts it raises in auc-
tion rooms in the West.The monetary value of the
illicit trade in art and antiquities—including other
categories of badly looted material like religious art
( f r e s c o e s, mosaics and icons from orthodox
churches and sacred statues from oriental temples
and shrines),ethnographic and tribal objects, and
fine art—is estimated at billions of dollars. B u t
when an object is looted,almost everyone is poorer
for it. ■

### Afghan heritage: time for exile?
Afghan heritage: 
time for exile?
Despite unanimous indignation, the Taleban destroyed the statues of
Bamiyan. The international community now has the responsibility
to save what it still can
O
n February 26, 2 0 0 1 , Mullah Omar,
t h e Ta l e b a n ’s self-proclaimed emir,
ordered the destruction of all fig u r a t i v e
monuments and art works on A f g h a n
s o i l .This unprecedented step touched
off a unanimous international reaction.
Why such an outcry? Why has it fallen on deaf
ears? If the Taleban regime had helped to ease
the plight of Afghanistan’s people in one area or
a n o t h e r, I think their iconoclastic wrath would not
have sparked such an uproar.Of course,the cultural
vandalism has mobilized public opinion. But in
this specific case, worldwide indignation was fueled
by concern about all the hardships imposed on
the A f g h a n people before crystallizing over the
issue of heritage.
Since the Ta l e b a n ’s 1996 seizure of power in
K a b u l , the regime’s unfathomable scorn for the
Afghan people has taken many shapes. First, dis-
crimination against the Shiite minority.Then requi-
ring women to wear netted chadors and outlawing
school for girls upwards of eight years old. Hun-
dreds of thousands drought-stricken farmers have
been forced to leave their land and homes, while
poppies are grown in the eastern and southern parts
of the country. One single feature sets the destruc-
tion of the heritage apart from such other acts of vio-
l e n c e : this time, the message is addressed to the
international community, and it has been heard.
Investing statues 
with fearful powers
In 1989,a few weeks after Soviet troops pulled
out of A f g h a n i s t a n , a group of Hezb-i-Islami fig h t e r s
ransacked the Buddhist monastery of Hadda in the
eastern part of the country and destroyed its outs-
tanding art works without sparking any interna-
tional reaction.These same fig h t e r s, who have since
joined the Ta l e b a n , laid the groundwork for fur-
ther destruction based on ideological motives.
Mullah Omar’s edict gives a formal under-
pinning to these acts. It demonstrates more than a
theoretical scorn for the culture of other commu-
n i t i e s, especially Buddhist culture: the Ta l e b a n ’s
rejection is so radical that they want to wipe it out
because they still invest the statues with magical,
malevolent and fearful powers.
The earliest depictions of the Buddha occurred
in present-day A f g h a n i s t a n .And since the artists of
the first-to fifth-century Gandhara civilization were
influenced by Hellenistic sculpture, they gave him
the face of A p o l l o. Ja p a n , Sri Lanka,C h i n a ,B u r m a ,
South Korea and Thailand view Afghanistan as the
Athens of Buddhism.
L a t e r,during the 15th century, H e r a t , in western
A f g h a n i s t a n , was the Florence of Muslim painting.
Several centuries earlier,advocates and adversaries
argued over whether Islam permitted the depic-
tion of human figures. The caliphate of Damascus
settled the dispute, forbidding the depiction of God,
but authorizing the portrayal of princes and their
“A crime against culture,” according to  UNESCO’s direc

power.
The miniatures and illuminated manuscripts
that flourished at the court of Herat were heirs to
that tradition and determined the canons of the
genre, which spread from Istanbul to Agra in the
18th century.Most of these masterpieces were taken
to Persia after the kingdom’s annexation in 1510,
while others accompanied Kabul’s Timuride princes,
cousins of the Herat court, when they conquered
India and set up the Moghol dynasty there. Th e
latest figurative illuminated manuscripts kept in a
library north of Kabul were burned after 1996.
Moving this heritage outside its area of origin some-
times has positive effects!
Making inventories of 
plundered collections
In the 20th century, a l l
Muslim countries, w i t h o u t
e x c e p t i o n , like all other
states, adopted the principle
that preserving and en-
hancing archaeological
heritage is vital for building a
modern nation and repre-
sents a base for cultural iden-
t i t y. As all the European
powers did after Po m p e i ’s
discovery in the 18th century,
they turned their backs on
the holy terror that works of
a foreign religious tradition
had inspired until then. The
archaeological past had to
b e preserved as a basis for
k n o w l e d g e, independent of
the religious charge it had ori-
ginally carried.
In 1919, an independent
Afghanistan invited archaeo-
l o g i s t s — first Fr e n c h , then Ita-
l i a n ,R u s s i a n , Ja p a n e s e,A m e-
rican and, more recently,
British and Indian—to undertake excavations,a n d
to train Afghan counterparts in return for agree-
ments on distributing the fin d s. In 1979, the war
put an end to these exchanges. Yet it was not until
after the Soviet withdrawal that the threat to heri-
tage reached an alarming intensity, as I can attest.
In autumn 1994, I walked into a Kabul museum at
the same time as General Massoud’s troops. For two
y e a r s,a faction independent of the central government
had controlled the quarter. The building had been
damaged by rocket fire and the collections plundered
out of sheer greed. Massoud agreed to place a cordon
of troops around the museum and guarantee its pro-
t e c t i o n .Within 24 hours, Carla Grissmann, a member
of Spach (Society for the Protection of the Afghan
Cultural Heritage, based in Peshawar), started an
inventory of the remaining collections.
The same year,Afghan archaeologists told me
they were worried.They said that the Rabbani and
Massoud government in Kabul would soon fall,
and that when Islamic extremists entered the capital,
they might destroy the collections.This emergency
situation prompted Najibullah Po p a l , the museum’s
c u r a t o r, to suggest creating a temporary storehouse
in a distant country. I consulted with diplomatic
representations and organizations for the protection
of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. Unfortunately,
none of them took action.
Foreign invitations
Since then, several projects in the same vein
have seen the light of day. Paul Bucherer-Dietschi,
a Swiss collector of Afghan manuscripts, says that
the Taleban as well as Rabbani asked him to house
what was left of A f g h a n i s t a n ’s heritage in his
museum in Bubendorf (Basel canton).After Mullah
Omar’s fatwâ, the Metropolitan Museum of New
York offered to house the pieces that had been
spared. If the move is still
p o s s i b l e,and whatever the
destination chosen, i t
should occur under the
supervision of a suprana-
tional authority. UN E S C O
would be the most legiti-
mate choice.
During the 1937 siege
of Madrid, S p a i n ’s repu-
blican government asked
Switzerland to give the
Prado collections asylum.
They were not returned to
Spain until after the Second World War. The cir-
cumstances in Afghanistan are different, but the
intensity of the crisis is comparable. That is why
the notion that cultural heritage belongs to all
humanity must replace the idea of national cul-
tural heritage. O t h e r w i s e, we must accept that
A f g h a n i s t a n ’s pre-Islamic and Muslim art will
vanish. ■
From the Taleban’s first threats against part of their country’s heritage,
UNESCO either spearheaded or relayed most of the international initia-
tives to “reverse this move into absurdity undertaken by the authorities
in Kabul,” in the words of Director-General Koïchiro Matsuura.
UN E S C O’s chief dispatched a special envoy in an effort to urge the Ta l e b a n
authorities to reconsider the decision to destroy their country’s pre - I s l a m i c
and Buddhist cultural heritage. He also called an emergency meeting of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference to discuss joint action. While
mobilizing political and religious leaders, UN E S C O also launched an inter-
national petition calling on Afghan officials to halt the destruction and
resume dialogue. The confirmation of the destruction of the Bamiyan sta-
tues—depictions of Buddha that are exceptional for both their size and
age—must not soften international pressure on the Afghan regime. ■

plundering that plagues the country. Everyone has followed the president

T

is no longer looted. Not far from there,
the villagers of Nombori have even
founded their own museum.And they’r e
not alone. In the Mopti region, the inha-
bitants of Fombori have taken the same initiative.
People who could have been tempted by looting to
improve their difficult lot have become curators!
These few startling examples go to show that Mali’s
efforts over the past two decades have paid off, e v e n
though looting is a long way from being wiped out.
The story goes back to the 1970s. Before that,
most of the trade in art works involved wooden
statuettes and masks, which were the only items
with an aesthetic and commercial value in the west.
Then, looting started to grow at a dramatic pace.
M a l i , with Nigeria and Niger,has become one of the
West African countries whose archaeological heri-
tage has been hardest hit by illicit traffic k i n g. A
1989 study by the Bamako Institute of Social
Sciences says that 17 percent of the 834 sites listed
in Mali’s Dogon country have been targets of large-
scale looting, of which two percent have been lost
forever for research.
Ancient cultures shrouded 
in mystery
In the inner Niger delta, hundreds of “ D j e n n é ”
terracotta statuettes,named after a city1 near Je n n é -
Je n o, have been scattered among private collec-
tions and museums around the world.The famous
“Bankoni”statuettes, which are named after a vil-
lage in Bamako’s suburbs, share the same fate.Th e
priceless bronze figurines from the Méma sites, in
the Ségou region,have fared no better.
The genius of Mali’s ancient oral civilizations
was chiefly expressed in statuary, one of our most
precious sources of information about the past. Fo r
example, one of the few statuettes found during a
scientific archaeological excavation of the Jenné-
Jeno site has revealed that earlier inhabitants buried
their dead in large earthenware jars and practised
other animist traditions. But we still know little
about the Bankoni, except that their civilization
flourished in the 14th and 15th centuries. Looters
were the first to discover all these sites.As a result,
the ancient art-producing cultures remain shrouded
in mystery, despite the high number of pieces sold
on the art market.
This market is basically supplied by so-called
antique dealers who in turn are supplied by their
own networks of looters: farmers or organized
g a n g s. The antiques are exported to Fr a n c e, t h e
United States and above all Belgium,a hub of illicit
trade.
Early on,M a l i ’s officials realized how serious the
situation was. Under the impetus of the country’s
current president,Alpha Oumar Konaré (head of

### Mali: when farmers become curators
division from 1976 to 1978, minister of culture from
1978 to 1980),a legal framework was set up allowing
for an effective campaign against looting and traf-
fic k i n g.A series of laws was passed, starting in 1985.
Two years later, Mali ratified the 1970 UN E S C O
Convention (see p. 21).
International co-operation:
the missing link?
The next step lay in raising  public awareness.
Several meetings bringing together 50 to 100
people from all walks of life were held,especially
in areas most beset by the problem. These gathe-
rings provided an opportunity to explain the new
laws and how important archaeological sites are to
our national history and cultural identity. It was not
always easy. The rural population, victims of
repeated droughts since 1974, sometimes turned to
looting as a way to survive and did not always
accept or understand our approach. But we per-
severed.In 1993,we took a new step by setting up
cultural missions in Bandiagara, Djenné and Ti m-
b u k t u . Their purpose: to continue raising  peo-
p l e ’s awareness and encourage them to get
involved in protecting their heritage. Near Djenné
and Te n e n k o u , for example, villagers recently
staged a play and held a temporary exhibition
about heritage. Some have even volunteered with
the police to guard archaeological sites.
In cities, the media helped the campaign along
by running many articles on the subject. During a
1994 exhibition on the “Niger Valleys” held at the
National Museum, many visitors discovered the
extraordinary richness of our archaeological heri-
tage and the dangers that threaten it.Mali has not
hesitated to arrest, prosecute and imprison some
l a w b r e a k e r s, which also sends out a message to our
citizens on how serious the scourge of looting and
trafficking is.
But the nationwide campaign has its limits, so
long as foreign demand remains strong. I n t e r n a-
tional co-operation is a must.In the framework of
the 1970 UN E S C O C o n v e n t i o n , Mali and the United
States signed an agreement in 1997 restricting the
illicit import of the Niger Valley’s archaeological
heritage and of items from the t e l l e m caves of Ban-
d i a g a r a2.This accord is the only one of its kind in all
of Africa.Mali would like to establish bilateral co-
operation with other importer countries, such as
Fr a n c e, which has already joined the UN E S C O
Convention, and Switzerland and Belgium, when
they ratify it.
As far as professional co-operation goes, M a l i
took part in the regional workshops held by the
International Council of Museums (IC O M) in
Arusha in 1993,Bamako in 1994 and Kinshasa in
1 9 9 5 , which brought together museum professio-
n a l s, law enforcement agents and customs offi-
cers. In 1997,we also participated in the interna-
tional workshop in A m s t e r d a m , aimed at
strengthening solidarity between source and
importer countries. The IC O M’s Red List was
drafted during that meeting (see box).
International solidarity is more than critical to
curb illicit trade, develop archaeological research
and set up education programmes.The weakness of
financial and human resources in a country like
o u r s, which is confronted with tremendous chal-
lenges such as poverty,prevent us from implemen-
ting all the programmes necessary to stop the loo-
ting. Rich nations must say no to selfishness. The
heritage of poor countries deserves as much respect
as that of the wealthy ones. The battle is far from
won. ■

The International Council of Museums (IC O M), an NGO with close ties to
UNESCO, has drawn up a Red List featuring eight categories of African
archaeological items which are particulary threatened by looting. These
include Nok terracotta; terracotta and bronzes from Ife; Esie stone statues
(Nigeria); terracotta, bronzes and pottery of the Niger Valley (Mali); ter-
racotta, statuettes, bronzes, potteries and stone statues from the Bura sites
(Niger and Burkina Faso); stone statues from the north of Burkina Faso; ter-
racotta from the north of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire; terracotta and bro n z e s
known as Sao (Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria).
“These objects are among the cultural goods most affected by looting and
theft. . . . An appeal is there f o re being made to museums, auction houses,
art dealers and collectors to stop buying them,” says the organization. The
Red List gives the provenance of items in each category, information on
their physical characteristics as well as the national and intern a t i o n a l
legislation protecting them. ■

### Homecoming for the totem poles
O
n a cold afternoon a little more than a
year ago, members of several T l i n g i t
Indian clans in southeastern A l a s k a
gathered for an emotional ceremony that
few of them had ever dared to imagine.
An intricately carved wooden beaver that plays a cen-
tral role in their history and culture was coming home
after an absence of nearly a century.
This carving once graced the prow of a war canoe
that ferried supplies to these clans in the wake of a
bombardment of their communities by the United
States Navy in 1881.One clan member, acting on his
o w n , later sold it to a travelling collector, and it disap-
peared.
In 1998,a clan elder was visiting a storeroom at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York
w h e n , he later recalled, he heard an “inner voice”
calling him to one shelf.When he
found the shelf, he was astoni-
shed to see the wooden beaver
staring out at him.
Under the provisions of a
sweeping law enacted 10 years
a g o, Tlingit clans asked the
museum to return the carving,
and museum officials complied.
“ The day it came back, t h e
whole village was at the dock,” said Leonard John,a
clan member who helped arrange the return.“ P e o p l e
were crying and weeping. This is not just art to us,”
John continued. “ I t ’s something far deeper, s o m e-
thing with a healing and spiritual aspect. When our
artefacts were scattered across America, they left a
void. We lost our honour and our value system. We
were overwhelmed by social problems like suicide
and alcoholism. Now that they’re coming back, p e o p l e
look at them and feel their honour and their self-res-
pect returning as well.There are still a lot of festering
wounds, but the process of healing has begun.”
The law under which the beaver prow was repa-
triated,the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation A c t , was signed by President George
Bush in November 1990 after years of discussion
among scientists, museum curators and Indian groups.
It seeks to reconcile two profoundly different value
s y s t e m s, one based on the primacy of reason and
science and the other revolving around spiritual and
religious values.
Under the law, every museum and federal agency
that owns Native American artefacts or remains must
compile an inventory of its holdings, identify them by
tribal origin,and notify existing tribes of objects that
appear to come from that tribe’s tradition. U. S.
museums hold the remains of an estimated 500,000
Indians as well as millions of artefacts.Since the repa-
triation law was enacted, according to the National
Park Service, they have returned about 20,000 sets of
human remains and more than 385,000 objects.
Specialists say this number is misleadingly high
because it includes every bead and pottery shard
found in an Indian grave. But among them are also
hundreds of important and beautiful artefacts that
have been prizes in museum col-
lections.
“Some people argue that this
is religion trying to assert itself
over science, but we don’t see it
that way,” said Keith Kintigh,
president of the Society for A m e-
rican A r c h a e o l o g y. “Our posi-
tion is that there are Native
American rights,but that science
and research are also legitimate. They have to be
balanced.That’s exactly what the law tries to do, and
I think it’s been pretty successful.
“Take these beautiful pottery vessels that were
interred with Indians a thousand years ago,” Kintigh
said.“On the one hand,there are people who think
those objects should be underground beside the
people they were buried with. But most museums
with Indian collections display funerary objects.
They’re enormous cultural achievements and have a
lot to tell us. In many cases, t h e y ’ve even been used as
models for the revival and continuation of traditional
artistic styles.”
Since the law was passed, tribal officials have held
countless meetings with curators, who have generally
learned to view objects in their collections in a new
way. Indians have also conceded that it is sometimes
best to leave their artefacts in collections where they

### Homecoming for the totem poles
can be seen and appreciated. In a few cases, they have
allowed museums to keep sacred objects on the condi-
tion that they be handled in special ways. Some must
be kept out of public view, others must only be dis-
played facing in a particular direction, and still others
must be sprinkled regularly with substances like
chopped tobacco or corn pollen.
The Field Museum in Chicago,which has one of the
c o u n t r y ’s richest collections of Indian artefacts, h a s
returned about a dozen in recent years. It is now pre-
paring to repatriate one of its prizes, a towering totem
pole depicting an eagle,a thunderbird and a bear, to the
Cape Fox tribe in A l a s k a .The pole was taken from an
abandoned village in 1899.“It was never the intent of
the legislation to bring in trucks and haul away museum
c o l l e c t i o n s,”said Jonathan Haas, a curator at the Fi e l d
M u s e u m .“It was intended to provide a mechanism for
the return of a very small number of very important
pieces that never should have been taken from their
place of origin in the first place.”
The repatriation process has not proceeded
without problems. Many Indian tribes do not have the
financial resources to organize claims for sacred
o b j e c t s. Others are so preoccupied with protecting
Indian cemeteries that are uncovered during floods or
road-building that they do not have enough energy left
to deal with objects that are safe in museum vaults.
Some objects that tribes would like to claim have
been treated with chemical preservatives, including
a r s e n i c, that make them toxic and unsuitable for cere-
monial use.
Another problem has been raised by some Indian
leaders who maintain that all objects from non-Euro-
pean cultures in North America belong in the hands
of Indians. The 1990 law, h o w e v e r, rejects that so-
called “ p a n - I n d i a n ” a r g u m e n t . It requires that the
claimant tribe prove it is a “lineal descen-
d a n t ” of the tribe from which the artefacts or
remains came.
As a result of this provision,the law has
served some tribes better than others. Sou-
thwestern tribes like the Hopi and Navajo, f o r
e x a m p l e, have maintained cultural continuity
over centuries and therefore have strong
claims to objects in museum collections.
O t h e r s, including many in the eastern U. S.
that were decimated by waves of European
settlement,have more trouble proving their
descent from tribes that existed long ago.
Another major conflict remains over
efforts by some tribes to recover remains that
are many thousands of years old and that
scientists say should be studied for vital clues
about the history of human migration to the
American continent.But many curators have
come to agree that Indians have a right to
recover their sacred artefacts and the bones of
those they can legitimately claim as ancestors.
This kind of change in perception repre-
sents the law’s greatest contribution,accor-
ding to experts like Rick West, a Cheyenne
Indian and curator of the Smithsonian Insti-
t u t e ’s National Museum of the A m e r i c a n
Indian in New York City, widely considered to
be the finest in the world. The museum has
returned about 2,000 objects to Indian tribes
across the U. S. , in Canada and in several Latin
American countries.
“As institutions of culture, museums that
house these materials have a vital interest in
buttressing those cultures and supporting them
into the future,” West said, adding that “this
process has directly benefited museums them-
s e l v e s.Even a collection as great as ours is very spottily
documented,and through this process of repatriation
w e ’ve had people from native communities visiting
our collection who can inevitably tell us a great deal
about objects that are not subject to repatriation.
“ When the law was first enacted in 1990 there was
practically hysteria in some parts of the museum com-
munity about what was going to happen,”West conti-
nued.“Now most of that has faded away. Both sides
have been deliberate and thoughtful, and it has ended
up benefiting both the native and museum communi-
ties.This is not just words. It has real impact.” ■

### For that stolen Vermeer, follow the art squad
E
ach time we’ve found works abroad, w h i c h
number 8,000 so far, international police
cooperation was essential,” says General
Roberto Conforti. To make his point, t h e
head of the c a r a b i n i e r i squad specialized in
protecting artistic heritage tells the story of the Vi r g i n,
painted by Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1479).
In 1995,the painting was stolen from the Pieve
di Calci,a church near Pisa,and vanished into thin
a i r.One day, a detective from Scotland Yard who had
i n filtrated a drug ring thought he’d found a suspect.
He contacted the Italian police, who identified the
suspect as an infamous traffic k e r. His phone was
t a p p e d , and he was arrested in front of a London gal-
lery carrying the painting under his arm.
Conforti follows up with the story of 29 p a i n t i n g s
(including a Perugino) that were stolen in 1987
from the municipal picture gallery in Bettona, a
village near Perugia, in central Italy.The investiga-
tion required the participation of law enforcement
o f ficers from six countries on three continents.Th e
trail led them all the way to Kingston, Ja m a i c a ,
where they arrested a former Jamaican senator,
who was sentenced to two years’ hard labour.The
29 paintings suffered no damage.
On the heels of a Van Gogh
The c a r a b i n i e r i also join investigations initiated
on foreign soil.In 1986, an armoured car was robbed
in Dublin. It was carrying 18 paintings belonging to
an Irish collector, including a Ve r m e e r, a Goya and
a Rubens, with an estimated worth of 50 million
pounds sterling ($33.3 million).“That theft,” says
C o n f o r t i ,“once again led us to drug trafficking and
money-laundering circuits in offshore areas such as
Antigua,in the Caribbean,and the Isle of Man,in
Great Britain.” The Turkish police found one of
the paintings in Istanbul in 1990. Their English
counterparts recovered three others, which had
been moved to London.Four—including the Goya
and the Vermeer —were pawned in return for a
loan to a diamond dealer and deposited in a Luxem-
bourg bank.The c a r a b i n i e r i found them while inves-
tigating a money-laundering scheme. Three pain-
tings, including the Rubens, are still missing.
Set up in 1969, the art trafficking squad is the
oldest of its kind in Europe. Its creation was largely
spurred by the scope of looting in a country with tre-
mendous archaeological and artistic wealth. Th e
carabinieri have recorded over 630,000 thefts in
the past 30 years, and their investigations have

on art trafficking. Its investigators go as far afield as Jamaica to pursue
art traffickers, and serve as a model across Europe

enabled them to find 180,000 art works and 360,000
archaeological objects.“ Forty percent of the stolen
art works are taken from private collections and
c h u r c h e s,” one police officer explains.“In churches,
paintings are not the only items that are stolen.
Objects from mass are very popular. C o u n t e r f e i t e r s
recycle benches, which are then used to stretch the
canvas of fake paintings. Analyzing the wood is
used as proof that it’s several centuries old.”
The art trafficking squad is growing: its 145-
strong force will soon increase to 185, spread out in
11 cities.“ We ’re neither archaeologists, nor art his-
torians. We’ve had just a few months’ training in
those fields,” says Conforti.“We’re senior investi-
g a t o r s, and we consult with the
cultural affairs ministry when
we need an expert opinion.”
The squad manages the
w o r l d ’s biggest Internet-acces-
sible databank: it includes
1,100,000 stolen art works, of
which 300,000 are outside Ita-
ly’s borders.
Over the past few years,
European countries have
joined the international
UN E S C O and UN I D RO I T
c o n v e n t i o n s, making it easier for police to cooperate
with each other across borders. Italy has often been
held up as an example. France has set up a similar,
although smaller structure, while Spain is poised to
follow suit. Before Great Britain joined the 1970
Convention on March 14, 2001,the issue stirred a
national debate, during which Conforti was invited
to explain his point of view before the House of
Lords—a first for an Italian military officer.
I t a l y ’s example is a model beyond the Euro-
pean Union. “We’ve trained a Hungarian team,”
says one law enforcement offic e r. “ The Iranians
and Palestinians have asked if they can take our
courses. In Bangkok recently, the 11th session of
UN E S C O’s Intergovernmental Restitution and
Return Committee adopted our recommendation
to outlaw Internet auction sales of archaeological
pieces.”
Although it is impossible to count the thefts of
archeological pieces from illegal excavations, their
estimated number is falling in Italy because of
better surveillance methods.“Each year,our police
recover 30,000 items, enough to fill a whole
m u s e u m ,” says the same offic e r.
“But elsewhere, the looting is
getting worse. A r c h a e o l o g i c a l
thieves are setting their sights
on Libya, Lebanon and
Cyprus.”
The c a r a b i n i e r i ’s o p e r a t i o n s
sometimes lead to spectacular
successes when it comes to both
Old Master and modern pain-
t i n g s. It took them just one
month to recover two Va n
Gogh paintings (The Gard e n e r
and Woman from Arles) and a Cézanne (Cabanon
de Jourdain, the last work the artist painted before
his death), which were stolen from the national gal-
lery of modern art in Rome. “We’re not always so
s u c c e s s f u l ,”says Conforti.“I won’t be satisfied until
we find Caravaggio’s Nativity, which was stolen in
Palermo in 1969.We don’t believe the painting has
been destroyed,but we fear it’s in the hands of the
mafia.” ■
For a long time, Belgium has had everything it takes to suc-
ceed in the highly lucrative African art trade. Dealers like
the country’s ideal location in the middle of Europe, long-
standing links with Africa, first-rate specialists, smooth-run-
ning distribution channels—and inefficient police controls due
to a legal vacuum.
Nigeria and Mali are unsuccessfully trying to protect their ter-
racotta sculptures, Burkina Faso its stone statuettes, the
people living on the shores of Lake Chad their miniatures.
O d d l y, although it is illegal to export these works fro m
Africa, it is lawful to import them into Belgium, which has no
laws against the practice.
Brussels used to boast about this outstanding situation.
Until very re c e n t l y, speculation on the finest examples of Nok
statuary was in full swing in the city, and well-informed
collectors on a narrow downtown street examined rare
pieces stolen from the Kinshasa Museum after the fall of the
Mobutu regime.
H o w e v e r, a story that never should have affected Belgium sent
shock waves through the little kingdom. In April 2000, the Paris
daily newspaper L i b é r a t i o n disclosed that the new museum
of first arts at the Louvre had acquired two Nok statuettes
f rom Nigeria with an illicit provenance. At first, this was an aff a i r
between France and Africa. But soon it was learned that the sta-
tuettes had transited through Brussels. At the end of the same
y e a r, a report by RT B F, Belgium’s public television network,
showed the workings of the Brussels market, sparking a public
outcry. A senator, François Roelants du Vivier, questioned the
g o v e rnment. After 30 years of indiff e rence, which encouraged
unbridled trade, officials finally decided to ratify the UNESCO
Convention.
In explaining why it had taken so long to do so, the ministry
of foreign affairs pointed to institutional complexities. First,
he explained, the federal system has to decide which autho-
rity has competence in this area. “I wouldn’t say,” the minister
replied to the senator, “that [this wait-and-see attitude] was
the best decision our country ever made.” ■

### The Getty's mea culpa
M
arion Tr u e, the antiquities curator
of the prestigious J. Paul Getty
M u s e u m , was sitting in the
audience of a conference in Vi t e r b o
(Italy) when an Italian local heri-
tage official fired the claim: one of the museum’s
prize pieces, a fifth-century BC drinking cup, h a d
been looted from Cerveteri, in the ancient area of
L a t i u m. Decorated with scenes of the Trojan Wa r,
the cup,known as a ky l i x,bore the signatures of the
potter Euphronios and the painter Onesimos.
That was in 1997.Two years later, on Fe b r u a r y
5,1999, True chaperoned three antiquities, inclu-
ding the kylix, back to Italy. All three had been
stolen and found their way into the Getty’s 50,000-
strong antiquities collection in Malibu, C a l i f o r n i a .
One was purchased in 1982 from a European
dealer who told the Getty it had long been in
England.In fact,it had been published in 1958 as
part of a private collection in Italy. The last, a
youth head, came from the New York collectors
Lawrence and Barbara Fleischman,and had been
taken from an excavation storeroom in Venosa.
Since taking her post at the Getty in 1986,
True has had the unenviable job of dealing with
many controversial purchases made by her pre-
d e c e s s o r s,not to mention the museum’s reputation
of turning a blind eye on the problematic origins
of high-priced antiquities. In 1988,American dealer
Peg Goldberg confidently offered the Getty sixth-
century Byzantine mosaics stolen from the Panagía
Kanakariá church in Cyprus for $20 million.Tr u e
d e c l i n e d ,h o w e v e r,and reported the matter to the
head of Cyprus’ department of antiquities. Th e
mosaics were eventually returned. S t i l l , as recently
as 1994, Boston University’s Murray McClellan
chastized the museum for its “ flagrant disregard”
of the American Association of Museums’ code of
ethics.
One of the most embarrassing legacies of the
G e t t y ’s freewheeling past is the statue of a k o u r o s,
a naked youth, supposedly from the sixth century
B C. It was bought from a Swiss dealer in 1983 for
a reported $7 to $9 million. A letter accompa-
nying it, supposedly written by German scholar
Ernst Langlotz in 1952, placed the statue in a
Swiss collection.This letter is a forgery;it bears a
postal code that came into use only in the 1970s.
In 1990, an art historian compared the Getty’s
k o u r o s to a torso allegedly made in Rome in 1985
by an Italian forger.The Getty acquired the torso,
made its own comparison, and could not decide if
the kouros was genuine or not. To this day, the
enigma continues.
Staying clear of 
costly court cases
With these thorns in its side, the Getty
announced in 1995 that it was turning a new leaf,
“with an interest in channeling our resources in
new directions,” wrote True in a press release.
“ We will be directing energies toward sponso-
ring international conservation, education, and
research projects that will lead to exhibitions and
publications, as well as exchanges and long-term
loans of important works of antiquity from
museums here and abroad.” The Getty also
announced a major shift in its acquisitions policy,
which True described  in The Art Newspaper:
“Now we would only consider buying from an
established collection that is known to the world,
so that we do not have the issue of undocumented
provenance.”

### The Getty's mea culpa
museum with an eye toward the Fleischman col-
lection acquisition? Why not 1970, the date of the
UNESCO Convention, or 1983, the date of the
C o n v e n t i o n ’s implementing legislation in the
United States? True says that no agreement or
understanding existed concerning the eventual
donation of the collection to the Getty. “ Th i s
a c q u i s i t i o n ,” she told The Art Newspaper in 1996,
“is in line with exactly what we said we would
d o.” According to her, the Getty even turned
down some objects the Fleischmans bought after
the 1994-1995 exhibition.
Even if there was no prior agreement, t h i s
acquisition shows the limitations of the Getty’s
new policy. Was the Fleischman collection “esta-
blished” and do the objects from it have a “well-
documented provenance?”The youth’s head that
True escorted back certainly did: the storeroom in
Venosa from which it was stolen. But that may
only be the tip of the iceberg. In a revealing ana-
lysis, researchers from the Cambridge University
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology found
that 92 percent of the catalogue entries had no
fin d s p o t , and 70 percent of the objects had become
publicly known in the exhibition.
Waiting for the 
trickle-down effect
Despite these reservations, the Getty can no
longer be labelled the voracious acquisitor it was
in the past.Moreover, its considerable resources
are to be directed in constructive ways, including
site conservation.Even if it does accept collections
like the Fleischmans’,there is at least a 1995 cut-
off date. Also, True has a track record of co-ope-
rating in repatriation questions.
Has the Getty’s change in attitude caught on in
other American museums? The Metropolitan
Museum in New York has yet to return a hoard of
third-century BC silver vessels despite convincing
evidence they were looted from Morgantina in
S i c i l y. B o s t o n ’s Museum of Fine Arts has rejected
recent claims made in 1998 by Mali for terracotta
sculptures and Guatemala for Mayan vases. M o s t
disappointing was Harvard’s Arthur M. S a c k l e r
M u s e u m ’s acquisition in the mid-1990s of Greek
vase fragments and coins with dubious backgrounds,
despite a 1971 policy that Harvard would no longer
accept such items “by purchase, b e q u e s t , or gift.”
But the picture is not everywhere bleak. I n
late 1998,for example, the Denver Art Museum
voluntarily returned a Maya wooden lintel from
the site of El Zotz in Guatemala. Dated to
ca.AD 550-650, it was stolen between 1966 and
1968 and purchased by the museum in 1973.
“ When we gathered all of the information sur-
rounding the lintel’s acquisition,” said the
m u s e u m ’s director Lewis Sharp,“returning it was
simply the right thing to do.” ■
April 2001 - The UNESCO Courier 33
Was the Getty reacting to a change in tide?
Over the years, organizations such as the A r c h a e o-
logical Institute of America have been unrelenting
in their criticism of the most egregious museums,
collectors and dealers. Public opinion surveys
reveal strong support for protecting cultural heri-
tage worldwide, while active source countries —
including Tu r k e y, I t a l y,Greece and China — have
started pursuing high-profile cases in the U.S. As
a result, museums are thinking twice about acqui-
sitions that may come with costly liabilities.
But according to some observers, the Getty’s
new policy was seriously flawed.As Ricardo Elia
commented in A r ch a e o l o g y,“ The term ‘ w e l l - d o c u-
mented provenance’ refers to an object’s owner-
ship history [more exactly, the history of posses-
sion] and should not be confused with
archaeological ‘ p r o v e n a n c e,’ the findspot of an
object. The Getty’s new policy, in fact, does not
require proof that an object has been removed
from its country of origin through legal means;it
simply requires that an established record of pos-
session be documented before November 1995.
While the policy should prevent the acquisition of
antiquities looted or smuggled after this date, it
allows the museum to acquire pieces that were ille-
gally removed before it.”
The lure of
priceless collections
True’s most controversial moves involve the
Fleischman collection, some 300 Bronze A g e,
G r e e k ,R o m a n , and Etruscan antiquities,valued at
$80 million in 1996.It was exhibited at the Getty
and at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1994 and
1 9 9 5 .Was the November 1995 date chosen by the

UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST

### The Proud descendants of the Lord of Sipán
The proud descendants 
of the L o rd of Sipán
As the current guardian of the tomb of the Lord of Sipán—the biggest
a rchaeological find in Latin America in recent decades—Peruvian arc h a e o l o g i s t
Walter Alva explains how the village of Lambayeque has pro fited from a tre a s u re
m i raculously saved from looters and international smugglers
2 . S AVING OUR T R E A S U R E S
H
ow was the Lord of Sipán discove re d ?
When our team reached the site on
February 25, 1 9 8 7 , it was already being
extensively pillaged by grave-robbers,
who had stripped pieces of gold from
one tomb. Local people had taken control of the
m o n u m e n t , and in the grip of a kind of gold-fever,
were trying to break into other tombs in search of
more precious metals. If we hadn’t done anything,
the site would have very quickly been totally des-
t r o y e d , as has already occurred in many other sites
like Vi c u s, L o m a n e g r a , Frías and the Valley of
Je q u e t e p e q u e.Peru was then in a serious economic
and moral crisis.People thought it was crazy for the
police to protect an archaeological treasure that
they believed was their rightful property.The situa-
tion was very tense, and the only way to save the
monument was either to mount a heavy police
guard or turn it into an archaeological site,which is
what we eventually did.
What financial backing did you have at the
start?
Very little.Three hundred dollars from a local
f o u n d a t i o n , government assistance to hire 20
labourers and,somewhat later, money from a bre-
w e r y. Hiring the labourers not only meant the site
could be cleaned up, but also eased the tension
with local people by giving them work.One grave-
robber died in a clash with police as the monument
was being repossessed.
Was there any help from abroad?
We received aid from the Heinz Foundation
and from National Geographic in mid-1987 when
we were certain that it was a very important find.
The main tomb of the Lord of Sipán contained a
body wrapped in hundreds of copper, gold and
silver objects that were part of the funeral hoard.
But the copper items were disturbingly corroded
and needed urgent restoration. Fortunately the
Roman-Germanic Museum in Mainz (Germany)
offered to restore about 560 pieces and train tech-
nicians to run a small workshop funded by
German aid money which we established in Lam-
bayeque after 1990.
Why was this necessary?
We needed it to restore fresh finds. When we
discovered a new tomb in 1989 belonging to the
Old Lord of Sipán that was just as opulent and
important as the first one, the pieces were res-
tored by Peruvian technicians to exactly the same
effect as the earlier ones had been in Germany.
This laboratory, which has been partly funded
since 1992 by the Spanish government,has also res-
tored artefacts from other digs. Our curators, f o u r
of whom were trained in Madrid,have also taught
Walter Alva:cultivating local pride.

a course in metal conservation to Latin A m e r i c a n
technicians. We have been entirely self-sufficient
since 1998, which goes to show how international
aid creates a lasting momentum.
The United States has managed to re c ove r
and return to Peru various items stolen prev i o u s l y
from a tomb in Sipán. H ow important is that help?
It’s crucial.In 1987,a gang of smugglers tried
to sell one of the ornaments for $1.6 million in a
scandal involving several diplomats. Luckily, the
United States restricted the import of pieces from
the Lord of Sipán’s tomb in 1990.This law could
only be extended once, but after it finally expired
a memorandum of understanding was signed in
1998 covering not only items from Sipán, but also
almost all the Peruvian heritage currently held
in the United States. I think all countries should
have agreements like that: i t ’s the only way to
close ranks against these crimes, which affect so
many countries with an extraordinary past but a
troubled present.I t ’s also a matter of respect. Ju s t
as we respect human rights, self-determination,
sovereignty and the environment, so we should
place the protection of people’s heritage on the
world’s list of priorities.
Has the hostility of the village changed?
A lot. Right from the start we tried hard to
regain their trust.We allowed about 6,000 people
in the region to visit the site, for example. They
could witness the public and national importance
of the dig, which was carried out exclusively by
Peruvians and whose discoveries belonged to the
Peruvian nation—and not to a bunch of grave-
robbers.
Are the local people happy with its effect on
their lives?
Th e r e ’s no way of course that the discovery will
solve the economic crisis,but we have managed to
get the Lambayeque region on the tourist circuit.
Local people are getting their self-respect back and
now feel proud of being descendants of the Moche
c u l t u r e, which has generated such admiration
around the world. National Geographic h a s
devoted reports to the site and foreign television
stations from Japan, Australia,the United States
and Chile have filmed it.There are now colleges,
u n i v e r s i t i e s, restaurants and shops named after
the Lord of Sipán.The name has entered the lan-
guage and enhanced the region’s identity. P e o p l e
have been able to see for themselves the very
positive effects of the discovery and the archaeo-
logical project to save it.
How is work going on the new museum?
It’s more than a museum. We want to make
i t into a centre that can act as a magnet for
c u l t u r a l , tourist and scientific development in the
region.It should be open by the end of this year.
Th e r e ’ll be 3,000 square metres of exhibits, i n c o r-
porating the latest innovations in museum pre-
sentation and situated on seven hectares of land
alongside laboratories and botanical gardens.We
want it to be “the”Peruvian museum of the mil-
lennium. ■
Around a thousand years
before the Incas, between
the first and seventh centuries
A.D., the Moches occupied a
6 0 0 - k i l o m e t re wide band of
desert off the northern coast of
Peru, sandwiched by the Pacific
Ocean and the Andes. Only a
civilization with highly deve-
loped technical re s o u rces could
have survived in one of the
world’s most arid regions. The
Moches achieved this feat by
developing a complex network
of irrigation canals supplying
water to double the amount of land now cultivated in the same valleys.
Divided into small dominions ruled by autocratic lords, the Moches built
giant adobe buildings in the shape of truncated pyramids, the most
outstanding example of which is the 35-metre high Huaca del Sol. They
also engaged in pioneering metal production, particularly with copper,
and established sophisticated textile workshops.The discovery in 1987 of
the tomb close to the town of Sipán belonging to a dignitary in one of
the Moches’ royal families has enabled researchers to learn much more
about a hitherto largely unknown civilization. ■

INTERVIEW BY MICHEL BESSIÈRES
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST

### We have to change the buyer's attitude
“ We have to change the
b u y e r ’s attitude”
Turkish investigative journalist Özgen Acar has spent thirty years trailing
art smugglers. His findings have brought prestigious foreign museums to
court and treasures back home 
2 . S AVING OUR T R E A S U R E S
A
s a journalist,
you have un-
c ove red seve r a l
art smuggling
a f f a i r s. H ow did
you first get involved?
I studied economics and
political science at univer-
s i t y.Archaeology is a hobby.
In July 1970, Peter Hopkirk,
the S u n d ay Ti m e s c o r r e s-
p o n d e n t , came to Tu r k e y. H e
was investigating a lead
about the smuggling of an
important treasure dating
back to the sixth century BC,
from the reign of the last
Lydian king, C r o e s u s. We
worked together on this
i s s u e.The treasure had been
purchased by the New York
Metropolitan Museum of
Art (Met), then hidden in
steel safes in the museum’s
b a s e m e n t . If an internatio-
nally famous institution such
as the Met was working in
tandem with smugglers, this deserved media attention.
As a result,I began more detailed investigations.
The Lydian hoard was returned to Tu r key in 1993.
What took so long? 
Fi r s t , the secrecy surrounding the Met intensi-
fied. Meanwhile, I continued to meet with villagers
and local officials in the region of the former Lydian
k i n g d o m . I didn’t spend 16 years reporting on it, I just
investigated and collected evidence. If I had written
on the topic, the Met would have postponed putting
the treasure on show. But they had to exhibit it sooner
or later because some wealthy people had paid
around $1.7 million between 1966 and 1968 to secure
the purchase of these pieces.The Met finally exhibited
50 of the 350 pieces in the summer of 1984. I saw
them myself and having determined that they mat-
ched my rough descriptions, I continued my investi-
gations until 1986, when I published my findings in the
Turkish newspaper I work for . The Turkish govern-
ment brought a suit against the museum in the New
York Federal Court. Six years later, the Met was
forced to return the treasure.
Your investigations shed light on the inner wor-
kings of a smuggling network.
Four farmers had found the treasure in a tumulus
[a tomb in a mound] in the province of Usak. They
sold it in Izmir to Ali Bayırlar,a prominent smuggler,
who later sold it to the owner of a New York antique
g a l l e r y, John J. K l e j m a n . Learning that these villagers
had made money from the treasure, n e i g h b o u r i n g
villagers decided to try their luck.Around this time,
two tumuli were stripped of their frescoes and these
were also sent to New York.I should stress that I’m
still angry with the curator of the Greek and Roman
D e p a r t m e n t , Dietrich von Bothmer, who bought the
treasure for the Met.But if he hadn’t purchased the
entire collection, it would have proved impossible
to bring the pieces together again.
H ave Western museums and private collectors
generally been as reluctant as the Met to return stolen
artefacts?
In the 1980s, the Antalya police caught a ring of
smugglers. They had dug up a hoard of Greek coins
from the fifth century BC in Elmali.The Elmali hoard
was so important that it was later called the “ Tr e a s u r e
of the Century.”There were 1,900 silver coins missing.
I traced them to Edip Telli and Fuat Üzülmez,two res-
pected art dealers in Munich until my stories broke.
They had links to Nevzat Telli in London, who was
involved in drug and antiquity smuggling beside his
textile business.The police and public prosecutors in
these countries, h o w e v e r, made no arrests, s t a t i n g
that “trading in antiquities was not a crime in their
c o u n t r i e s.” I concluded that the hoard was in the pos-
session of William Koch, one of the wealthiest 400
people in the U.S.Again,legal action went on for 10
Digging for the truth.

years, until Koch, realizing he would lose the case,
returned the hoard to Turkey.
You have wo r ked on many other cases since
then...
Ye s, and I won’t be out of business any time soon.
Tu r k e y ’s heritage is under threat, just as it is in Greece,
Cyprus, Iraq,Syria,Iran,India,Cambodia or China.
There are more ancient Greek cities in Turkey than
in Greece, and more Roman ones than in Rome.Th e
country has 50,000 villages, but 70,000 pre-Islamic
s i t e s. It is very diffic u l t , if not impossible, to assess accu-
rately the monetary value of illegal art trade.A major
cultural foundation in New York calculated that in
1989,Americans spent approximately $5 billion on
works of art the previous year.Two billion dollars of
this was spent on smuggled,stolen or fake works of
a r t .The total value of artefacts smuggled from Tu r k e y
was estimated to run between $300 and 400 million.
Only two or three million, not even one percent,
went to the Turkish looters.
From your ex p e r i e n c e, what are the most effective
ways to prevent smuggling?
First of all, we have to change the buyer’s attitude.
Court cases won by Turkey have discouraged
museums and collectors from buying smuggled works.
They don’t want the inconvenience of a court case,
having their names in the newspapers and loosing
m o n e y. The Met paid $1.7 million for their collec-
tion and Koch $3.5 million for his.They spent at least
twice as much as this on legal expenses. S e c o n d l y,
Turkey should make agreements with museums in the
purchasing countries.“ D o n ’t buy smuggled works—
I’ll send you exhibitions on loan every three or four
y e a r s.”As a matter of fact,Turkey has sent as many as
35 exhibitions abroad in the last 15 years. The third
step is to expose the smuggling mafia with their inter-
national connections, and put them out of business.
Edip Te l l i , for example, has had to quit the smug-
gling business. His brother in London was impri-
soned for heroin smuggling. Several respected anti-
quity dealers in the U. S. lost confidence in their
business partners when they realized that they were,
in fact,dealing with smugglers.
Some of the artefacts you helped return to Tu r key
are Lydian,Greek and Roman.Are they really part
of Turkey’s heritage? 
All those artefacts were made in Anatolia.Does
the Euphronios Vase in the Met belong to the Italians
or the Greeks? It certainly doesn’t belong to the
A m e r i c a n s.The craftsmen who made it were Greek,
but it’s part of Italian history. Instead of thinking
about national ownership,we need to consider owner-
ship and protection in the name of all humanity.A r t e-
facts taken from Troy are now found in 42 different
museums all over the world. I don’t know how many
are held in private collections. How is it possible for
a scholar to travel to all those 42 museums? If they
were exhibited in a museum near the ancient city of
Troy, everyone would benefit from it.
You have also done some work in Cyprus.
I helped to uncover the smuggling of frescoes and
mosaics from Byzantine churches.Once again, t h e y
are the common property of mankind.My articles
about a Turkish smuggler helped the Greek Cypriot
Administration to secure the return of artefacts
from Indianapolis to Southern Cyprus. In London,
I found two Korans that had been stolen from a
Turkish foundation on the Greek island of Rhodes.
They were sent back.I also came across Mycenean
gold treasure in a New York gallery. I talked to
diplomats from the Greek embassy in Washington
and advised them on the best way to secure their
return without incurring legal expenses.
What are you currently investigating?
I ’ve been working on the “ Weary Hercules”
s t a t u e, half of which is in the Antalya Museum
[ Turkey] while the other half is in the hands of private
c o l l e c t o r s. U n f o r t u n a t e l y, Bill Clinton, before lea-
ving offic e, made Ms Shelby Wh i t e, a co-owner of
the statue,a member of the official advisory group on
preventing plundering. I’m also covering the efforts
of Turkish authorities to ensure the return of six gold
pieces from the Croesus treasure, now held by a gal-
lery in France.
Have you ever been threatened?
Ye s, I ’ve received many threats by telephone.
Once they even tried to kidnap me when I was on
summer holiday. I ’ve been thrown out of many
New York galleries because they thought I was an
undercover agent of the Turkish government. I
have also been taken to court on several occasions
in Turkey. ■

### Putting embryos on the assembly line
Putting embryos
on the assembly line
By creating embryos through cloning, we may also find a treasure trove for
treating disease.
But in the rush to profit, we may sell short the very stuff that makes us human,
a sense of dignity.
theoretical speck in a Petri dish has a
veritable mob straining for a better view
across the industrialized world and
beyond:men and women in white coats
and religious robes jostle beside parlia-
mentary lords, scruffy environmentalists
and patients trembling with Parkinson’s
d i s e a s e.The mystery in question is none
other than the human embryo cloned à
la Dolly. The aim is not to produce
people. Through “therapeutic”cloning,
scientists would create  embryos to har-
vest stem cells, which may hold the key
to treating a wide range of disease. But
like most passionate debates, the real
issue—commercialization—sits quietly
in the background of the emotional din.
Human respect
or cellular sludge?
The debate erupted across the indus-
trially advanced world on January 22nd,
when Britain became the first European
country to legalize the creation of cloned
human embryos. Members of the Euro-
pean Parliament almost immediately
expressed their shock and condemned
the decision.Yet in many ways, the new
law is a logical extension of rules dating
back over a decade. Since 1990, U K
researchers could create and use
embryos for limited research purposes,
namely to treat infertility and detect
birth defects. The new law widens the
field of study to include stem cells,w h i c h
experts say could revolutionize medi-
c i n e, offering the possibility of trans-
plants to treat scores of illnesses from
P a r k i n s o n ’s disease to diabetes (see box).
No one has yet applied for a license to
perform such experiments, according to
the Human Fertilisation and Embryo-
logy Au t h o r i t y, which will carefully
screen each request. No other uses of
cloning would be allowed and a new law
has been promised to explicitly ban
reproductive cloning.
As expected,the most rigid opposi-
tion has come from the Catholic Church,
which considers the embryo to be a living
person from the moment of conception.
Cloning aside, even research involving
“spare”embryos (created for infertility
treatments but not used) is condemned
because it is morally wrong to use a
person for the benefit of someone else.
At the opposite end of the spectrum
lie the hardcore utilitarians of science
and business, who are generally astute
enough not to announce their politically
incorrect views: namely that the embryo
is just another batch of cellular sludge
that can and should be used like any
other biological resource in the pursuit
of medical research.
Somewhere between these two poles
lies the famous middle ground, for which
there is no clear road map but a general
p r i n c i p l e : respect for human dignity, a
touchstone of French and European law.
“The very fact of being human automa-
tically entails the right to a certain res-
pect or dignity. It is what separates us
from other animals,” says Noëlle Lenoir,
president of the European Group on
Ethics and justice on the French Consti-
tutional Court.The seeds of this notion
rest in the major monotheistic religions,
says Lenoir, but the principle effectively
took root in international law following
the Second World War and the eugenic
brutality of the Nazis.
Finding biological clues
The embryo is not legally considered
a person but rather “a human being in
the true sense of the word, meaning it
exists and its nature is human,” a c c o r d i n g

### Putting embryos on the assembly line
to Bernard Mathieu, a French professor
at the Sorbonne. This protects the
embryo from being reduced to a com-
mercial resource without intruding upon
a woman’s right to protect her health
and control her fertility. Such an unders-
tanding of human dignity underlies the
decision by many European countries
to strictly limit or prohibit embryo
research in general.
But the UK’s green light to thera-
peutic cloning reflects a very different
interpretation of the same principle,
according to Alastair Campbell, a pro-
fessor and member of the UK expert
committee which recommended that
Parliament approve the research. Th e
traditional categories of vocabulary for
distinguishing between respect for
human life and that of persons are too
c l u m s y, says Campbell. I n s t e a d , he turns
to biology for clues in defining ethical
l i m i t s. B a s i c a l l y, the embryo is treated
with increasing moral seriousness or pro-
tection as it develops.This is why it is for-
bidden to experiment on any embryo—
cloned or not—after 14 days, when the
“primitive streak” or the first signs of
an emerging nervous system appear.
A lurking trade
in stem cells
Dr Donald Bruce of the Church of
Scotland reluctantly agrees that certain
forms of research may be justified on
“spare” embryos. However, the recent
UK decision crosses a major ethical thre-
shold,says the director of the Church’s
Society, Religion and Technology Pro-
ject. “Instead of treating embryos as a
w h o l e,” says Bruce,“we now see them as
a source of parts.” The UK has moved
from a policy of “no and less”—which
only permits the use of embryos when
there are no alternatives for understan-
ding very serious problems—to a “yes,
provided” approach—which opens the
floodgates provided that certain condi-
tions are met.
There is also a practical side to this
ethical dilemma. Imagine that we do
take the cloning route to harvest stem
cells:doctors would require at least one
egg, but probably a dozen or more, to
treat each patient.Hence Bruce’s recom-
mendation that research should  explore
all the options before embarking upon
therapeutic cloning (see box).
Not only is the recent UK decision
too wide for critics, but it could lead to
the slippery slope of reproductive clo-
ning—whereby people are created by
cloning. British law clearly forbids this
scientifically remote possibility, yet the
problem ultimately lies in the globalized
medical community, says Bruce. S e c t s,
businessmen and more recently a group
of maverick scientists have trumpeted
their intentions to clone people, d e s p i t e
the extraordinary risks of deformity.
What will prevent them from setting up
shop in a genetic safe haven, a country
where bioethical legislation doesn’t
apply or exist? 
But in the shadows of these theore-
tical discussions lurks the largest threat:
the future trade in embryos and stem
c e l l s. Every expert cited in this paper,
including Prof. Campbell who supports
the research,has joined a host of others
deeply concerned about commerciali-
zation.In particular, there appear to be
too many loopholes in patent rules,e s p e-
cially in the U.S. but also in Europe and
industrialized countries like Au s t r a l i a ,
Canada and Japan.
Consider the genesis of Dolly the
s h e e p,who was born in 1996 at the Roslin
Institute in Scotland. An A m e r i c a n
c o m p a n y,G e r o n , bought the commercial
arm of the institute and received a license
While it is politically
risky to claim
the embryo itself,
there are plenty
of backdoors to exert
control over it.

“Therapeutic” or adult DNA cloning are just nice
ways of referring to the fabrication of human
embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which
is how that famous sheep Dolly was created. SCNT
involves a few basic steps. First, take a human egg and
remove the nucleus (which contains its DNA or genetic
material) and insert a single healthy cell of a patient.
Then pass an electric current to fuse the two and the
egg acts as if it was fertilized. You now have a tiny ball
of cells which some like to refer to as a pre-embryo. But
this is just another euphemism used to calm public fear.
That little cluster is indeed an embryo and could theo-
retically grow into the patient’s clone if it were implan-
ted into a woman’s uterus and if all went well. Note the
ifs, for as Dolly and her ilk remind us, the chances of
actually producing a healthy human clone are extreme-
ly remote. But this may be beside the point, for the
embryos in question will be destroyed within 14 days,
when the first signs of neural development appear.
Why go to so much trouble? Between the fifth and
seventh day after fertilizaton, a batch of 20 to 30 cells
appear that are worth gold for scientists and patients
suffering from a wide range of degenerative diseases
and conditions. Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) have the
potential to develop into any kind of cell in the human
body. Although there are several kinds and sources of
stem cells—such as those found in the bone marrow of
adults—none so far seem to have the malleability of ES
cells, which can also be kept and grown in laboratories
for long periods of time. The great hope is that resear-
chers will learn to direct ES cells into becoming any part
of the body—cells, tissue or maybe even organs—
required by a patient. For example, someone suffering
from heart disease might be able to “grow” genetically
identical cardiac tissue in a laboratory that could then
be transplanted with little risk of rejection. 
Yet there may be alternative routes to the same goal.
Researchers at PPL Therapeutics, which is part of the
team that produced Dolly, recently announced that
they were able to transform adult skin cells back into
stem cells and then into beating heart cells. This type
of work might initially require embryo research but in
the long term it could offer a way out of cloning. ■

to two UK patents that shocked many in
Europe and the U. S.The first patent basi-
cally covered the cloning technique and
the second the covered “ p r o d u c t s ”of that
p r o c e s s. This can be read to mean that
Geron owns products like cloned human
embryos in the early stage of develop-
ment.
European
doublespeak
Geron then sent a similar set of appli-
cations to the European Patent Office
( E P O ) , which initially approved them
before striking off the right to human
embryos upon a second reading, accor-
ding to Christoph Th e n , a genetic
research expert for Greenpeace Ger-
many. The decision marks a step in the
right direction, says Th e n . But it also
r e flects the split personality of the Euro-
pean Union:while liberalizing trade rules
to compete with the U. S.biotech market,
it tries to squat the moral high ground of
genetic research to serve as a beacon
for the rest of the world.
So we find strong principled state-
ments ringing in the European Parlia-
ment and proud reminders of the
U n i o n ’s Charter, which prohibits
“making the human body and its parts
as such a source of financial gain.”Yet at
the same time, member states are sup-
posed to be integrating a very contro-
versial directive on genetic patenting,
which is meant to balance ethical and
commercial concerns. On the one hand,
“processes for human cloning”are not
considered patentable, nor are “uses of
human embryos for industrial or com-
mercial purposes.”N e v e r t h e l e s s, a com-
pany can control (receive a patent for)
“an element isolated from the human
body or otherwise produced by means
of a technical process.”This is a dazzling
bit of doublespeak, but don’t believe
anyone who tries to tell you exactly
what it means. Instead look to recent
trends in gene patenting for key clues as
to what we might expect in the near
future.
In theory, patents are supposed
t o reward inventions, not just the
discovery of elements already existing
in nature.You can, h o w e v e r, be awarded
a patent for developing a novel use for an
e l e m e n t , like a gene. But look at
t h e human genome—the genetic map
o f o u r species—and you’ll find a trail
of lawyers scurrying for a patent almost
every time a scientist, or rather a com-
p u t e r, suspects a gene may be lurking.
Th e y cannot even fully identify it,
l e t alone understand its function, y e t
theyclaim it as their own. This basically
means that anyone else who looks to use
that gene to develop a new drug or to
treat a related disease must pay for
the view.
This same commercial race is hea-
ding straight for the human embryo via
therapeutic cloning.According to Then
of Greenpeace, the number of patent
applications directed at human embryos
is dramatically increasing.Last year, t w o
biotech companies, from Australia and
the U. S. ,applied for and received a Euro-
pean patent on cloned human and
animal embryos as well as mixed spe-
cies embryos from pigs and humans.B u t
after a major public uproar stoked in
Germany by Greenpeace, the Munich-
based EPO said it was a “mistake” and
the companies admitted they had gone
too far and promised not to include
human embryos in their patents anyw-
here in the world.
While it is politically risky to claim
the embryo itself, there are plenty of
backdoors to exert control over it. A
company may receive broad powers over
simply retrieving embryonic stem cells or
culturing and guiding them in a parti-
cular direction. This is not to suggest
that such feats don’t require ingenuity.
Yet depending upon the scope of the
patent awarded,we could see a re-run of
the same abusive pay-per-view approach
taken with genes.
More than just a sum 
So far only four countries have
implemented the patent directive. Fr a n c e
and Germany have both expressed
opposition and the Netherlands, s u p-
ported by Italy and Norway, has chal-
lenged the directive in Europe’s Court of
Justice. Outside of officialdom, groups
like Greenpeace are turning on the pres-
sure to reopen the negotiations.
This is usually the point where jour-
nalists and experts sign off with a vague
but earnest call for public debate. B u t
the exchange is already underway—in
the media, religious halls, universities and
the corridors of hospitals,where doctors,
patients and the families speak and think
q u i e t l y.This appears to be a step forward,
yet there is a new trend among some
scientists and bioethicists to denigrate
this kind of discussion, especially if it
reaches an emotional timbre. O p p o s i t i o n
is ascribed to “ c o n f u s i o n ” over the issues
and to the damage done by the false but
pervasive belief that “we are the sum of
our genes.”Genes are just molecules and
early embryos are microscopic balls of
cells.Yet they both hold an iconic power
which stems not from confusion, but a
gut instinct to respect human dignity. ■

### Saving the planet: imperialism in a green garb?
Saving the planet:
imperialism in a green garb? 
Developing countries feel that protecting the world’s resources is just another
way for rich nations to retain the upper hand in the international trade game
or nearly a decade, international efforts to
address global environmental concerns
have been frustrated by a deep rift in
perceptions between rich and poor coun-
t r i e s. Economists and environmentalists
in developing nations argue that the
agenda for environmental negotiations
is almost exclusively driven by the North.
Under the pretext of saving the planet,
they say, the industrialized world is wiel-
ding a new brand of dominance, “ e c o -
imperialism.”
Developing countries like India and
China continue to resist global environ-
mental protocols, like the 1989 Montreal
Accord to cut the production of CFC
gases (used for example in refrigerators)
by 50 percent,or the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM), part of the climate
change negotiations initiated under the
1997 Kyoto Protocol.“These are viewed
as instruments to make the Third World
pay for damages caused primarily by the
N o r t h ,” says Indian environmentalist Va n-
dana Shiva.India and China account for
two percent of CFC consumption,while
the United States consumes 29 percent.
“ This ‘eco-imperialism’ undermines
national sovereignty, while generating
new costs for those once marginalized
by colonialism,” claims Shiva.
The spectre of imperialism is likely
to vitiate the next round of climate change
talks in Bonn (Germany) this July, when
p o l i cymakers finalize the terms on which
the CDM will be implemented. N e g o-
tiated by industrialized countries to gain
some flexibility in meeting the emission
reduction targets pledged in Kyoto, few
issues in recent environmental diplomacy
are proving as contentious.
Critics say the mechanism is the latest
in a string of attempts to dominate poor
c o u n t r i e s, which are being virtually
“ b r i b e d ” so that rich nations can continue
business as usual. By financing forestry
schemes and other energy-efficient pro-
j e c t s, industrialized countries could exploit
the mechanism to avoid reducing their
own greenhouse gases. E n v i r o n m e n t a-
lists fear this could turn the Amazon and
other primeval forests into “carbon sinks”
to absorb pollution,but with side effects
which disregard the developmental needs
of southern countries.
Lopsided
negotiations
“ The Northern bias continues to
dominate discussion of the global cli-
matic crisis,” explains Shiva.“The threat
to the atmospheric commons has been
building over centuries,mainly because of
industrial activity in the North. Yet dis-
cussions seem to focus more on develo-
ping countries: the North refuses to
assume extra responsibility for cleaning
up the atmosphere. No wonder the Th i r d
World cries foul when it is asked to share
the costs.”
“ The whole effort to bring about eco-
logical change is very one-sided,” s a y s
Chow Kee, who represents Malaysia at
the climate negotiations.“ The developed
countries don’t want to give up their
extravagant lifestyles, but plan to curtail
our development.”
Beyond negotiations on climate,
efforts to link environmental concerns to
trade are sparking more allegations of
i m p e r i a l i s m .“ There is an attempt by rich
countries to stunt the growth of develo-
ping nations like India,and we are figh-
ting it tooth and nail,” says Pramod
Mahajan, India’s minister for informa-
tion technology. “ They are practising
protectionism under the garb of envi-
ronmental protection.” E c o n o m i s t s
argue that sanctions could spell further
economic marginalization for develo-
ping countries, which often lack the
means to set up expensive quality-
control systems.
The 1989 Basel Convention, for ins-
t a n c e, imposed restrictions on trade in
scrap metals and recyclable materials,
claiming they were hazardous to the envi-
r o n m e n t .Economists say it prohibits poor
countries from competing in the lucra-
tive world market for computer parts,
scrap metals, and recyclable products.

### Saving the planet: imperialism in a green garb?
Other examples of trade restrictions
are cited. In the early 1990s, M a l a y s i a
and Indonesia fought to overturn an eco-
labelling law introduced by Austria osten-
sibly to safeguard the Asian rain forests.
Austria refused to import timber that was
not from sustainably managed forests,
but no such curbs existed for wood from
temperate areas. The protectionist fla-
vour of the measure was overt,and Aus-
tria eventually revoked it.
In other trade-environment disputes
over the last decade, the United States has
been accused of protectionism in ban-
ning the import of Mexican tuna because
dolphins were getting ensnared and killed
in nets meant for the fish. Shrimp from
India, Pakistan, Thailand and Malaysia,
which paid no heed to sea-turtle protec-
tion,were similarly banned in 1996. The
sanctions may have been motivated by a
desire to protect dolphins and turtles,b u t
the poorer countries claimed that they
were a pretext for suppressing competi-
tion in the global fish market.
A green agenda
to stop growth?
Deepak Lal, professor of interna-
tional development studies at the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles, cites
these examples when he describes the
green movement as “the new secular reli-
gion.” He says “green imperialists”are a
new avatar of the “white man’s burden,”
set to impose their values on the world.
According to Lal, rules restricting
trade through the Basel Convention or
attempts to ban genetically modified
foods are designed to exclude poorer
countries from world markets. “I look
upon the green agenda as ultimately
trying to stop growth in the Third Wo r l d .
And that means condemning three-quar-
ters of the world’s population to conti-
nuing poverty.”
Other voices in the South, however,
argue that environmental controls like
the CDM are not all bad. D e v e l o p i n g
countries, say experts, will receive $5 to
$17 billion to fund climate-friendly tech-
nologies. “The CDM gives us an oppor-
tunity to invest in projects that promote
sustainable development.If incidentally
they also reduce emissions, we shouldn’t
quarrel with the fact,” says Dr
R . K . P a c h a u r i , of the Tata Energy
Research Institute, New Delhi.“As sove-
reign nations, we should be confid e n t
about choosing projects, like renewable
energy projects, that we would in any
case want to invest in.”
The rules of the CDM have yet to be
established,and Pachauri urges develo-
ping countries not to squander the chance
to influence their formulation.
But Anil A g a r w a l , director of the
Delhi-based Centre for Science and Envi-
r o n m e n t , insists that the CDM has
neglected the concerns of poor countries.
“ The CDM still begs the long-term ques-
tion about when and how developing
countries will take on commitments of
their own to reduce emissions.”
Not all experts in developing coun-
t r i e s, h o w e v e r, shun global environ-
mental controls. Indian economist and
newspaper editor Swaminathan S.A i y a r
argues that there is “much to be learnt
from the rest of the world.”Like British
colonial rule, which brought with it some
desirable elements like democracy,c i v i l
and gender rights to India,the new cru-
saders could impart useful technologies,
he writes in the Times of India.“ I n s t e a d
of rejecting wholesale what green impe-
rialists say, we need to extract what is
of value, and reject the dross.”
Though the die are loaded against
developing countries during negotiations,
part of the fault lies with them, s a y
e x p e r t s. “ The North is aggressive and
assertive about what it wants, and comes
well-prepared to negotiations,” laments
A g a r w a l .“Developing countries are com-
paratively disorganized and unclear about
their objectives.”
The environment, Pachauri explains,
is a low priority for politicians in develo-
ping countries. Lack of cooperation bet-
ween these nations is another handicap.
A dearth of resources and language bar-
riers come in the way. But as developing
countries know, they will be hardest hit by
global warming. In the end, c o u n s e l s
Agarwal,it is up to them to devise ways
to protect our common future. ■

INTERVIEW BY SHIRAZ SIDHVA
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST

### Getting into the other's shoes
“Getting into the other’s shoes”
Ecuador’s former environment minister Yolanda Kakabadse once said that “my
heart is in conservation, but my head tells me I must be fair to my country.”
Today, as head of the World Conservation Union*, she calls for a better
understanding between North and South
Do you believe that the current enviro n-
mental agenda is increasingly driven by rich
countries?
A majority of industrialized countries
are more active than developing ones in
international debates. For one, they have
the means:it’s so costly to participate that
you often find a huge team of highly tech-
nical people from developed countries and
few representatives from developing ones.
Recent debates on climate change and bio-
diversity have been clear signs that some
countries in the South might not have the
capacity to enter all the technical debates.
Do you believe that countries like Ecuador
are targets of eco-imperialism?
I think the term is overrated. I’m not
sure we’re sending out the right message
with it.There are clearly signs of developed
countries trying to impose on others. But on
the other hand, developing countries have
gained a lot of information about environ-
mental protection over the past decade
through these negotiations. There is
obviously an interest on everyone’s part
to see that the natural resources and the
environment of the planet are dealt with.
And most of these resources are concen-
trated in the tropical areas, where many
developing countries are.
I t ’s not just a North-South issue:s o m e-
times I see signs of  “imperialism” within
our own countries, when a sector or group
tries to impose a management pattern or
policy.
As an activist, you campaigned against
shrimp farming and had to defend that
industry when you were a minister (1998-
2000).How did you reconcile that?
Is it fair to tell Ecuador not to harvest
shrimps—a major export—because the
mangroves are an important eco-system, o r
should the answer be to explore whether it
is possible to harvest shrimps and protect
mangroves at the same time? I’m absolutely
convinced that you can do both,at least in
the case of shrimps. You just move the
shrimp pools a little further back from the
mangroves and achieve the two goals.
Did you actually manage to do that?
We did in some places,but the majority
of the pools had already been built where
the mangroves were. It was not just the
industry that was to blame:it’s only in the
past decade that people in the North and
South have become aware of the impor-
tance of mangrove conservation.
How would you have reacted if other coun-
tries had sought to impose a trade ban on
certain products from Ecuador?
I would be totally against trade sanc-
t i o n s.We destroyed the mangroves without
realizing their value.To come 30 years later
and blame us for doing something wrong is
not the right attitude. Instead we should
come up with a way to stop environmental
damage while enhancing the capacity of a
country like Ecuador to produce goods for
the world market.
Has the relationship between North and
South evolved on environmental issues?
There is a better understanding in the
North that imposing solutions won’t take us
anywhere, that teamwork is essential.The
S o u t h ,m e a n w h i l e, has realized that it does
hold some decision-making power. Deve-
loped countries certainly have a better
appreciation of poor countries’ concerns,
partly because more information is avai-
l a b l e.The building of partnerships between
the two sides has also increased.
Do you believe that conflicting intere s t s
over the conventions currently being for-
mulated can be resolved?
The big challenge is how to strike a
balance between conservation and deve-
lopment—sustainable development.That is
what we must fight for. A l s o, t h e r e ’s no
process in the world that doesn’t involve
c o n fli c t . C o n flicts aren’t necessarily bad,
they arise from differences of opinion based
on different cultures, e x p e c t a t i o n s, b a c k-
grounds, drives and ambitions. We have to
invest in generating the capacity world-
wide to manage these conflicts and unders-
tand each other’s points of view better.
What would you advise both sides to do?
You have to understand the other cul-
t u r e, and both sides must do this by getting
into the other’s shoes, which entails loo-
king at values, needs and conditions within
any culture. That would improve the rela-
tionships of different continents and coun-
tries dramatically. ■

### Africa: the radio scene tells all
A f r i c a :
the radio scene tells all
Radio, the most widely used medium in Africa, can only flourish on democratic
soil, which helps to explain why private stations are thriving in the west and not
in the centre of the continent
had has only six private radio stations,
while Mali boasts 100… What explains
this tremendous disparity? The two coun-
tries are similar on several counts. They
are the same size (a little over 1,200,000
square kilometres), and neither has
access to the sea. Both were French colo-
nies and lived through long years of mili-
tary dictatorship after achieving inde-
pendence in 1960. And last year, t h e y
ranked among the world’s poorest coun-
t r i e s,with a per capita income of $261 for
Mali and $240 for Chad.
“An unfavourable political environ-
ment and socio-cultural factors” s l o w
down the development of radio plura-
lism,says Gilbert Maoundodji,director
of FM Liberté, Chad’s second indepen-
dent radio station, launched last year.
“The people who govern here have not
yet completely assimilated the values of
collective action, f r e e d o m , tolerance and
democracy. That sets up a roadblock to
initiative.”
A country’s political context rubs off
on its airwaves. M a l i , which held free
elections in 1992 and has set up demo-
cratic institutions that function reaso-
nably well, launched its first private radio
station in March 1991. Radio Bamakan
paved the way for a host of others, i n c l u-
ding Radio Liberté, Radio Kay i r a a n d
Klédu FM.
In early 1993, Chad settled for a
parody of a “national conference,” g e n e-
rally intended as a broad policy consul-
t a t i o n . Yet it only strengthened the
power of President Idriss Déby, w h o
took the reins through armed force.As a
r e s u l t , even religious stations found it
d i f ficult to make a breakthrough. Th e
first Catholic station, La Voix du Pay s a n
( “ Voice of the peasants”), started broad-
casting in 1996.The lay station Dja FM
followed suit only three years later.
Other stations, including FM Liberté,
Radio Brakos, and the brand new Duji
Lokar FM (“Morning Star”) came later.
And plans for a private weekly radio
s t a t i o n , L’ O b s e r v a t e u r, are on the verge
of fruition.
Confiscating equipment
“needing repair”
C h a d ’s example is emblematic of
Central Africa as a whole, which seemed
to have a lead over its western neigh-
bours when Africa N°1, the first and only
French-language pan-African radio sta-
t i o n , began broadcasting in Gabon in
1 9 8 0 .But since African states began tur-
ning to democracy in the early 1990s,
West Africa has witnessed an explosion
of independent radio stations: t h e i r
number has soared to over 400.In Cen-
tral A f r i c a ,h o w e v e r, private investment
in broadcasting remains minimal.
Chronic instability has set the region ten
years back.Most countries there, inclu-
ding the Central African Republic and
the Republic of the Congo, are belea-
guered by simmering armed conflicts, if
not all-out war, as in Rwanda, Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
In the eastern part of the DRC, for
e x a m p l e, rebels have confiscated the few
private radio stations that existed before
the August 1998 war. Radio Muunga-
n o ’s transmitter was taken to Uganda
in October 2000 on the pretext that it
needed repairs,and to date has not been
returned.When they don’t control pro-
gramme content, insurgent groups
simply do away with the equipment.Th e
g o v e r n m e n t ’s methods are just as drastic.
In September 2000,Radio Télévision Kin
M a l é b o ( RTKM) was nationalized
outright and three private television net-
works closed down.Only religious radio
stations are allowed to broadcast,as long
as they steer clear of politics.
In countries at peace, such as Equa-
torial Guinea, Gabon and Cameroon,
the brakes on pluralism are often

### Africa: the radio scene tells all
intitutional. Since 1990, when a law on
broadcasting freedom was passed, t h e
Cameroon government has used all
kinds of subterfuge to prevent the emer-
gence of private radio, with the exception
of rural and community stations laun-
ched by UN E S C O or the Intergovern-
mental Francophone Agency.
For example, Radio France Inter-
nationale (RFI), which broadcasts
throughout A f r i c a , could not be received
on FM in Yaoundé until February this
y e a r. “ We had been in contact with
Cameroon since 1992,as part of a coope-
ration agreement to include RFI in the
national radio station’s technical struc-
t u r e,” says Hugues Salord, R F I ’s director
for international affairs. “But we were
unable to clinch the deal until the decree
of April 3, 2 0 0 0 , which benefited not
only RFI, but Africa N°1, the BBC, a n d
other local private radio stations.”
It took ten years for the decree to
be signed, but the obstacles remain. O f fi-
cials have increased administrative com-
plications, imposed very short applica-
tion deadlines (four months) and
demanded exorbitant fees for operating
licenses—$15,400 in a country where a
civil servant’s average monthly salary is
$ 1 2 0 .Most of the proposed projects were
therefore eliminated,and one of the sta-
tions that had operated until then on an
experimental basis, Radio Soleil, had to
stop broadcasting in June 2000.
The art of
bureaucratic subversion
As a free medium which reaches a
wider population than print, p a r t l y
because of broadcasting in local dialects,
partly because of high illiteracy rates,
radio arouses the mistrust and hostility
of political leaders. Hence their inclina-
tion to maintain a government mono-
poly on broadcasting to foil an inde-
pendent media that is often virulent and
close to the opposition. The airwaves
are strategically important for politi-
c i a n s, who will go to great lengths to
control them by any means.For example,
on February 22, 1994, Gabonese army
tanks destroyed the facilities of Radio
L i b e r t é . The government later claimed it
was because the opposition was using
the station as a propaganda mouthpiece! 
“Radio Liberté? It was the devil’s
radio… The army and security services…
destroyed their facilities.We ’ve returned
to the normal game of democracy since,”
wrote Gabon’s president, Omar Bongo,
in his recently published book, B l a n c
comme Nègre.
B o n g o ’s comments illustrate the
demonization of free radio in Central
A f r i c a . The ghost of Rwanda’s R a d i o
Télévision des Mille Collines (RTLM),
which played a key role in mobilizing
the killers who perpetrated the 1994
genocide, still haunts the region.Today,
political leaders disinclined to accept
broadcasting freedom point to it as an
e x a m p l e, conveniently forgetting that
RTLM was initially close to the Kigali
g o v e r n m e n t . The result: as soon as a
radio station strays from the official line,
it is suspected of inciting rebellion or
tribal hatred. Equatorial Guinea has
taken drastic steps to avoid that risk:
not a single private radio station has
been allowed on its soil! 
Besides political factors, the weak-
ness of civil society has clearly helped
slow down the growth of independent
radio in Central A f r i c a . Local NGOs
and grassroots organizations are not
involved enough in national political
d e b a t e. This results in indifference on
the part of donors likely to help set up
radio stations, especially by training staff
and supplying equipment.“I obtained a
frequency last year, but can’t afford to
purchase equipment,” says Begoto
O u l a t a r, director of N’Djamena Bi-
h e b d o, C h a d ’s most famous newspaper,
which is now branching onto the air-
waves.
Economic woes also prevent private
radio from gaining a foothold in central
A f r i c a .Public networks receive the lion’s
share of advertising, the only source of
income for independent radio, w h i c h
cannot count on user fees.To stay out of
t r o u b l e, businesses avoid advertising on
stations with a reputation of being hos-
tile to the government.Take the case of
Gabon’s Radio Soleil, which rose from
the ashes of Radio Liberté and was sus-
pended five times in four years. During
a 1999 Yaoundé conference on pluralist
m e d i a , Makaga Vi r g i n u s, a station repre-
s e n t a t i v e, explained companies’ reluc-
tance to invest on its airwaves:“we were
not subservient enough to the central
g o v e r n m e n t , which has very close ties
to the business world.”
Electronic inroads
to state monopolies
But there are reasons to be opti-
mistic about the future of radio in A f r i c a .
New technology is making equipment
l i g h t e r, smaller and less expensive.
Direct access to information on the
Internet will probably prompt officials to
In Central Africa,independent radio lags ten years behind the western part of the continent.

### Africa: the radio scene tells all
loosen their grip. And there is likely to
be a change of mentality with the slow
but steady influx of foreign radio net-
works such as RFI,the BBC and Voice
of A m e r i c a , which may end up softe-
ning political rigidity.
Local radio stations created by inter-
national and non-governmental organi-
z a t i o n s, such as the Central A f r i c a n
Republic’s Radio Ndeke Luka, (heir to
the United Nations radio in Bangui), o r
Burundi’s RSF-Bonesah FM (founded
by veterans of Radio Umwizero, an ini-
tiative of the Association for Humani-
tarian Action), will also help along the
p r o c e s s.Worldwide groups like the Panos
Institute, the Research and Technology
Exchange Group (Gret), the Hirondelle
Foundation and Search for Common
G r o u n d ,which have contributed to radio
pluralism in West Africa,are beginning
to focus on Central Africa.
The audiovisual landscape is chan-
ging in most countries.A case in point is
Cameroon, where the TV Max private
television network, founded in August
2000, was barely two months old when
the public network adjusted its pro-
grammes to compete! Why don’t pri-
vate radio stations do the same? If the
Unlike neighbouring countries in West Africa, Côte
d ’ I v o i re and Togo have followed the same itinerary as
the nations of Central Africa: a bumpy transition to demo-
c r a c y, a venomous social climate and the lack of political will
to liberalize broadcasting or to apply existing laws.
In 1993, Côte d’Ivoire allocated FM frequencies to just fiv e
radio stations, of which four were foreign (RFI, BBC, Africa
N°1 and N o s t a l g i e) and one was close to the govern m e n t .
Since then, only diocesan radio stations have been allowed
to operate. Licenses have been granted only since 1998 (52
at last count), and under very strict conditions.
They are only allowed to broadcast within a 10-kilometre
radius and cannot air political programmes. Adverti-
sing can only come from local companies. With regula-
tions like these, it is no wonder that private radio is
developing extremely slowly.
In Togo, the law on broadcasting liberalization was ratifie d
on November 30, 1990, but the regulatory body has not
granted a single definitive license. This means that existing
private radio stations are broadcasting illegally. Initiatives
such as Kanal FM, founded in August 1997, and Nana FM,
launched at the big Lomé market in August 1999, are
trying to develop without daring to venture into the are a
of political information. 
Legal vagueness allows To g o ’s government to boast about
so-called radio pluralism while keeping a tight grip on
private stations, to the dismay of the Togolese Organiza-
tion of Independent Radio and Television, which is cam-
paigning for a clarification of the status of private radio sta-
tions in Lomé. ■

### Cooking in a crossfire
Cooking in
a cro s s fire
Alain Senderens, one of
France’s top chefs,
creates dishes for a
cosmopolitan elite, but
worries that the
dwindling of true
homemade cooking is
slowly killing off our
tastebuds
s cuisine becoming globalized,
like everything else?
I t ’s commonplace to say
that we’re living in a multi-
cultural society, in which eve-
rything is interconnected.
Wh a t ’s m o r e, the transportation
revolution is a fact.So globalizing cur-
rents are running through cuisine, just as
they are through all other sectors of
every society. But cooking is not beco-
ming globalized, if by globalization you
mean imposing a single model everyw-
here around the world.
In Antiquity, Pliny the Elder wrote
that Greek gourmets travelled around
the Mediterranean basin to sample the
freshest products at their prime, rather
than have them shipped to Greece. B u t
of course those goods were already tra-
v e l l i n g. To d a y, we get perfectly fresh
produce from Japan and Au s t r a l i a .A n o-
ther example: in New Yo r k ’s Little Italy,
you can find better-quality Italian pro-
ducts than those that are widely avai-
lable in Italy itself. In the United States,
pizza is the best-selling dish.In France,
it’s couscous.
So you’re opening your cuisine up to the
world?
I draw tremendous inspiration from
Asian cuisine. In 1978, I became the
first chef to introduce soy sauce into
gourmet cooking, a n d , by the way, a
food critic ripped me to shreds. In 1978,
I spent two months in China to study
Chinese cuisine: it has some very fine
things but is still highly conservative.
Thai cuisine, on the other hand, i n s p i r e s
me a lot because it’s very hot and spicy.
I’ve just put tempura, a typically Japa-
nese way of preparing fried foods,on my
menu.I would never have done that 10
or 20 years ago. But I’ve concocted my
own version by adding in some curry
A l a in S e n de re n s
Delving into Grandma’s cookbooks can also be a source of inspiration.
* Since 1978,Alain Senderens,6 1 ,has been among the 20 or so great chefs that restaurant
guides rank in cooking’s elite. In 1985,he took over Lucas Carton’s restaurant on the
Place de la Madeleine in Pa r i s, where he honed his specialty,“creative cooking.”T h e
business has 68 full-time employees, including 24 cooks, and serves approximately
60 lunches and slightly more dinners every day, at a price that can easily exceed 1,000
francs ($150) per person.
* Alain Senderens has written many cookbooks, and he is also the author of Proust -
La cuisine retrouvée ( “ P r o u s t , cuisine regained”), published by Chêne, 1 9 9 1 , a
gourmet’s view of the French literary masterpiece.

### Non-article text
“Can a t h re e - s t a r F rench re s t a u rant get away
with serving an American wine?”
THE ARK OF TA S T E
Noah saved animals from the flood on his ark. In 1996, the Italian-based NGO
Slow Food* created the Ark of Taste to “protect the small purveyors of fine
food from the deluge of industrial standardization; to ensure the survival of
endangered animal breeds, cheeses, edible herbs, cereals and fruit; to spread
the teaching of taste…”  There are only around 20 mora romagnola pigs left to
make delicious hams; only a few hectares of Sciacchetrà vines in Liguria that
produce one of Italy’s finest sweet wines. A rich, complex, non-industrial,
unwritten heritage, fashioned over the centuries by traditional know-how, is
becoming extinct. It is infinitely fragile: if a single element —either an ingre-
dient or a technique— in the production cycle is missing, the whole product
disappears.
The Ark of Taste has a committee of journalists, teachers and researchers wor-
king to revive, list and publicize these threatened treasures. The main purpose
is not to lock these riches up in some kind of museum, but to bring them back
to life. “Praesidia” have been set up to revive old trades, and to produce and
market quality products. The end goal: “to protect biodiversity and the right to
taste.” Slow Food includes 92 such groups; the first one outside Italy rescued a
species of Peruvian pig. ■
*Slow food, whose motto is, “For the defence of and the right to pleasure,”
has an Internet site: www.slowfood.com

### Cooking in a crossfire
and serving it with Condrieu, a white
wine from the Rhône valley.
Recently, a quarrel between some great
F rench chefs pitted the advocates of
openness to the world against the defen-
ders of tradition.You were firmly on the
side of the former.
At the time, I made a comparison
with Picasso. Imagine seeing his works
when the debate over them was in full
s w i n g. Some people would have said,
“ h e ’s not a great painter,h e ’s inspired by
African art.”The argument in cooking
is exactly the same.They say all our pro-
ducts and recipes must remain French!
It’s unbelievable!
But how far should cultural mixing go?
I specialize in creating dishes to
marry with my favourite wines. M a n y
vintners outside France are willing to
pay me to put their wine on the menu
and invent a dish to go with it.I haven’t
done that yet for two reasons. Fi r s t , I
h a v e n ’t found any outstanding wines,
such as American ones for example.Yo u
might ask, what makes a great wine?
Th a t ’s a highly subjective notion.Wi n e s
from the New World are very powerful,
very concentrated, and a little heavy,
whereas I like delicate, elegant wines as
feminine as lace, ones that make me
want to have another glass. I wouldn’t
say there aren’t any great wines outside
Fr a n c e, but they’re scarce and certainly
very expensive. S e c o n d ,and this is essen-
t i a l , I’m faced with a dilemma: can a
three-star Fr e n ch restaurant get away
with serving an American wine?
Aren’t the great chefs creating a cuisine
that would satisfy “world taste”? Wo u l d
a Brazilian, an American,a Japanese, an
African and a Frenchman appreciate your
dishes in the same way?
Yes and no. Let’s go back to pain-
t i n g. An enlightened—and wealthy
—art lover travels to all the art capi-
t a l s, opening up to a host of styles.Th a t ’s
what my clientele is like.They are a tiny
minority you meet in very few places.
I believe in gastronomic meridians.
Paris, like New York,Los Angeles and
perhaps London, is exceptional because
its cuisine is universal.Anyone can enjoy
quality dishes from their own culture.
But everywhere else, including in major
French cities, a kind of regional protec-
tionism lives on.
To answer your question, I ’ m
convinced that there are some French
dishes a Korean or a Japanese person
w o u l d n ’t like. Classicism is omnipresent
outside our very tiny minority, because
even when we travel, we yearn for our
roots and want to return to them.Th a t ’s
why there’s no globalization of taste:
i t ’ll take at least a hundred years before
that happens. It’s one of the things that
changes the slowest. And please don’t
talk to me about the wave of McDo-
nald’s: in a capital city like Paris, they
account for less than five percent of the
restaurant trade and people go to them
mainly because that’s all they can afford.
And yet “ t ra d i t i o n a l ” cooking is dying
out.
Ye s, except for a few pockets of
r e s i s t a n c e, w h a t ’s called “ b o u r g e o i s
c u i s i n e ” or “la cuisine du terroir” i s
giving up ground, quite simply because
w o m e n ’s roles are changing in our socie-
ties.When they come home from work
in the evening, they don’t have time to
prepare a veal stew for the family, so
they buy ready-made dishes. Sales of
those kinds of products are soaring by
about 45 percent a year at the super-
market chain I work for. Far, very far
from the cuisine of the great chefs, cui-
sine has gone from the home realm to
industry.That’s a serious problem.
Why?
In the years to come,I’m afraid there
will be a loss of taste. Our generation
had a culinary history, a family cooking.
As children, we already knew some-
thing about cuisine. Today, the overw-
helming majority of the population
doesn’t have that knowledge. They’re
willing, or doomed,to eat anything.
If somebody earns the minimum
w a g e, has one or two children in school,
and has the rent to pay, w h a t ’s left to buy
food? Th e y ’re doomed to the bottom of
the market, to standardized, u n i f o r m
products that marketing people have
designed to be sold in hundreds of mil-
lions of copies, packed with artific i a l
flavours to bring down the price.We’re

### Cooking in a crossfire
entering a period of two-tiered cuisine:
a minority—let’s say 10 percent of the
population—can afford our restaurants
or our creations sold in supermarkets,
and 90 percent can only afford mass-dis-
tributed industrial products.
Wh e reas some time ago, the chicken you
served was the same as what we had
for Sunday dinner.
Earlier, products were not standar-
dized —a lot was left up to chance. But
it’s also true that when people criticize
hormone-fed chickens, they forget that
in years past, many families couldn’t
traditional cuisine anymore, a l t h o u g h
we didn’t have any “political” ulterior
motives.
Did nouvelle cuisine revolutionize the
production of your ingredients?
For us, the simpler the cuisine, the
more exceptional the quality of the
ingredients must be. In the 1970s, w h e n
nouvelle cuisine e m e r g e d , drawing so
much criticism at the time, we went to
see farmers to ask them to supply us
with exceptional products. Thanks to
us, pockets of high-quality production
formed at a time when intensive indus-
trial production was becoming wides-
p r e a d .Well before the outbreak of mad
cow disease, the great chefs saved tra-
ditional products and launched what
later came to be known as organic pro-
duce. We were on the cutting-edge of
ecology without knowing it.The Fr e n c h
researcher Claude Fi s h l e r1 said that
with nouvelle cuisine, people set out in
search of paradise lost, while in tradi-
tional cuisine, they drowned products in
sauces that masked the taste because
they thought they were mightier than
nature.
Could nouvelle cuisine have come about
without technological innovations?
They were also a decisive factor.
They enable our products to arrive
incredibly fresh. And what can I say
about the benefits of these advances on
afford chicken at all.And quantity isn’t
always incompatible with quality: if a
champagne producer invests enough
money, he can put 50 million very good
bottles on the market every year.
Nouvelle cuisine, which emphasized pro-
ducts in their own right,emerged in the
1 9 7 0 s, right after the protest movements
of the 1960s. Do you think there ’s a
connection between the two?
I think the general social climate
has an influence on all of us. I opened
my own restaurant on April 2,1968.In
1 9 6 8 ,I , like other chefs,d i d n ’t want to do
Is a chicken in every pot compatible with quality? Yes, say some.

### Cooking in a crossfire
“F i rst you eat with the e y e, then comes the t o u c h
in your m o u t h, the s m e l l, and lastly the t a s t e”
frozen food! Even fire, with all its sym-
bolism,has changed. For centuries, we
cooked with charcoal, and later, g a s.
Then electricity came along.The fla m e,
the symbol of male sexuality, fell out of
use just when women were asserting
sexual equality.Th a t ’s an extraordinary
p h e n o m e n o n .And today’s vacuum pac-
king could evoke voyages to the stars.
I t ’s enough to turn you into a philo-
sopher.
Once it was said you could judge top
chefs by how well they used leftovers.
To d a y ’s great chefs take pride in ke e-
ping nothing from one meal to the next.
Haven’t they gone from economy to was-
tefulness?
We work mornings for lunch and
afternoons for dinner. We do every-
thing over twice a day, including baking
the bread. We do haute cuisine, l i k e
designers who do haute couture, a n d
God knows there’s plenty of waste in
the latter… Our clientele expects the
best because we’re very expensive, so
we go all out. But 100 years ago, t h e
finest products were for the best houses
only, the average person didn’t eat the
same things.You can outlaw luxury and
Rolls Royces and only make Minis, b u t
is it democratic to bring everybody
down to the same level in society,
without even leaving them the chance
to dream?
So nouvelle cuisine has become a luxury.
There are gastronomic moments,
just as you don’t go to the opera or to a
museum every day, or read a literary
masterpiece every night. In my view
t h e y ’re more powerful than all the
others because haute cuisine includes all
the other arts.A painting appeals to the
sense of sight,music to hearing,a l t h o u g h
the beat may sometimes make you want
to move. In gastronomy, first you eat
with the eye, then comes the sense of
touch in your mouth, the sense of smell
a n d , lastly the sense of taste.The sensa-
tion is all-encompassing.
So cuisine has risen to the rank of the
eighth art?
N o, because it’s always brought
down to a minor art. When I ask intel-
lectuals to explain why, they say that
cuisine is ephemeral, the work is des-
t r o y e d . But today we have recipes so
precise that ingredients are measured to
the last gram. They can be identically
reproduced the same way as a piece of
music on a record.
Another problem is that most people
cannot intellectually analyze cooking
the way they would painting or litera-
ture.They don’t have the vocabulary to
describe what gives them pleasure or
not. Instead, they just settle for saying
“its good”or “it’s not good.” From that
m o m e n t , the product, the wine, the dish,
dies a quiet death,for nothing. There’s
a lack of culinary culture.
You claim the status of an artist, even
going so far as wanting to patent your
recipes.
To me, everything that’s classic
belongs in the public domain.But today
manufacturers make dishes based on
my latest recipes. I don’t think that’s
f a i r.As soon as a journalist has an excel-
lent meal at my restaurant,everybody
tries to copy me without even knowing
how to, and consequently often do a
bad job.Obtaining intellectual property
rights is the necessary condition for
making sure the recipe is correctly
repeated and the dish keeps its origi-

nality.
But a painting or a film can be admired by
millions of people, whereas your dishes
are accessible only to a tiny minority.
Yes and no, because I also carry out
a social mission. The great chefs have
their ready-to-cook meals just as the
great designers have their ready-to-
wear lines. The vacuum-packed meals
that I make for a major distributor are
an example. Of course, they can’t be
compared with what I do in my restau-
r a n t . But on the other hand, it would be
difficult for someone at home to pro-
duce such good value for money,
because they cost between 18 a n d
3 0 French francs ($2.50 and $4.50). I
give the pleasure of taste back to those
who no longer have time to cook.
Do you agree with the saying “you are
what you eat”?
The anthropologist Claude Lévi-
Strauss is even more specific than
G o e t h e, who supposedly coined the
p h r a s e. He asserts that “a society’s cui-
sine subconsciously translates its struc-
t u r e, u n l e s s, without knowing it, it is
resigned to revealing its contradictions.”
My profession and my family culture
make me a man of the past,but I also
try to be part of our times.We’re going
through a transition period, the birth of
a new civilization and the end of the one
that has ruled for 2,000 years. U n f o r t u-
nately, we only have words, ideas and
our past culture, which are insufficient
for imagining the world of tomorrow.
That contrast probably explains why,
like many people today, I’m in an awk-
ward position,especially since, one or
two years ago, a customer told me,
“Monsieur Senderens,when the Romans
started erecting statues of their cooks,
everything started going downhill very
fast for them…” ■
