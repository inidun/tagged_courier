Editorial MISES
How healthy is the world's population today? Has world health improved
as a result of the amazing technical advances of modern medicine and
pharmacology? Are industrialized and developing countries drawing
equal benefit from progress in medical science? Do all peoples attach the
same importance to health problems? Do doctors have the same
perceptions of health and disease as their patients? Some answers to these
and other related questions are suggested by the contributors to this issue
of the Unesco Courier.
While many infectious diseases can now be controlled by
immunization, or have been completely eradicated as in the case of
smallpox, new diseases and pathological conditions have arisen, often
associated with malnutrition and insanitary conditions, as well as with
hitherto unknown viral strains such as the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) , which today represents an unprecedented challenge to
international public health. Even increased life expectancy through
improved health care creates a need for costly treatment of degenerative
conditions.
A pluralistic approach to medicine and appropriate care for the
individual, with consideration given to psychological and social factors as
well as to biological problems, may be the only way ahead for medicine if
everyone is to benefit from its new technology. In China, for example, the
condition of the entire body is taken into account when treating cancer
with a combination of traditional medicine, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy.
The concept of preventive medicine, gaining ground everywhere and
especially in developing countries, is basically linked to local systems of
primary health care, the family and community support, which can take
some of the burden from overstretched medical services , as would a more
rational use of pharmaceutical products.
What does the future hold? Will cures for all human ills eventually be
available, limited only by economic resources? Perhaps, but
breakthroughs in biotechnology, neurology, genetic medicine, research
into new vaccines, advanced therapies such as molecular, micro, or
"spare-part" surgery, and all other aspects of "hi-tech" medicine, are
only part of tomorrow's medicine. Twenty-first century health care
should continue to be based on prevention of disease and on meeting
basic human needs for nutrition, hygiene, shelter and education.

### The Notion of health
The notion of health
by Paul Gigase
AT first sight, the concept of health
seems perfectly straightforward. In
1946, the World Health OrganizaÂ¬
tion (WHO) set forth the following definiÂ¬
tion in the preamble to its Constitution:
"Health is a state of complete physical,
mental and social well-being and not merely
the absence of disease or infirmity."
However, this definition is qualified in the
next paragraph, which speaks of the "highÂ¬
est attainable standard of health" as a funÂ¬
damental human right, thus taking into
account limiting circumstances such as conÂ¬
genital handicap, or the serious conÂ¬
sequences of disease or accident.
The WHO definition reflected a reaction
against the usual view of health as the mere
absence of disease. Nevertheless, it implies
that there is such a thing as a universal, ideal
state of health. Is this really the case? How
is health perceived by sick people, medical
staff and ancillaries, non-professional
health workers and even healers?
A doctor is interested in disease: in other
words, in a deviation from the somatic or
psychic norm, which he or she is able to
bring to light, sometimes without the
patient's knowledge. A doctor will often be
less concerned about the way in which a
patient perceives and interprets his or her
disease, and this attitude is encouraged by
the impressive advances made in medical
technology. However, what is abnormal is
only a deviation from a statistical average,
and the greater the number of parameters
on which the assessment of the state of
health is based, the more chances there are
that subnormal values will emerge, without
necessarily indicating a state of disease.
Moreover, these criteria are not absolute:
malaria, for example, causes an "abnorÂ¬
mal" swelling of the spleen in infected chilÂ¬
dren, which is in fact a sign of the body's
healthy defensive reaction to the disease. In
regions where malaria is endemic, it would
be more alarming to note the absence of any
swelling of the spleen in these children!
When the cause of a disease is well
known, the doctor will attempt either to use
preventive measures or to diagnose the disÂ¬
ease as early as possible, at a time when
treatment will still be effective and will not
leave irreversible after-effects. This is primÂ¬
ary or secondary prevention. Doctors will
accordingly ask their patients to give up
some habits or adopt new ones in other
words, to change their way of life to a cerÂ¬
tain extent, in the knowledge that the effort
required will benefit only some of them, as
in the case of smokers and lung cancer. But
the patient sees in this only a restriction of
his or her immediate well-being for the sake
of a remote and hypothetical improvement
in health.
Sick peoples' perception of their disease
is shaped by the disturbances that it causes
in their everyday well-being. Their percepÂ¬
tion of the disease, their awareness of that
perception and the form that their reaction
takes belong in a particular context and find
expression in behaviour which would be
incomprehensible to any professional who

### The Notion of health
Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharziasls
after its discoverer Theodor Bilharz) is a parasiÂ¬
tic disease which affects about 200 million peoÂ¬
ple in many tropical and subtropical developing
countries. The disease is transmitted via freshÂ¬
water snails which carry and spread the paraÂ¬
site. Blood in the urine, kidney damage, bladder
cancer and liver failure are some effects of the
disease. Today schistosomiasis can be diagÂ¬
nosed using simple, low-cost techniques to
detect parasite eggs in the urine or faeces and
patients can be treated immediately with an
orally taken drug. Left, children with urine samÂ¬
ples line up for testing. Above, health education

ease and discourage them from contaminating
water.
the walls of the bladder; they are acquired,
in tropical regions, through contact with
water polluted by the urine of infected subÂ¬
jects. The more numerous the worms, the
more acute the symptoms of the disease.
The symptoms appear primarily in the form
of haematuria, or the presence of blood in
the urine, which becomes red either perÂ¬
manently, or after physical effort. In a
region where urinary schistosomiasis does
not exist, haematuria is a somewhat rare
and always alarming symptom.
In regions where urinary schistosomiasis
is endemic, on the other hand, most of the
population is infected, and haematuria is
frequent . Schoolchildren particularly
boys, who are more readily allowed by their
parents to bathe and play in water are the
worst affected. As a result, their urine often
becomes red at puberty. Hence the idea,
tenacious in certain ethnic groups, that the
presence of blood in boys' urine is the
equivalent of menstruation in girls, and that
its absence, rather, would be abnormal at
that age.
As the children grow older, their contacts
with' water become fewer; similarly, the
quantity of worms of which they are carriers
diminishes, and so does the haematuria.
They are eventually cured, although some
of them suffer from serious after-effects of
their infection and , if no treatment is given ,
they may die of these much later. No conÂ¬
nection is made between these later deaths
and haematuria in childhood, a fact which
accounts for the off-hand attitude displayed
towards this symptom.
Haematuria in a young person in a region
where urinary schistosomiasis is endemic is
almost certainly due, whatever form it
takes, to infection by flatworms. However,
people may perceive it as several different
disorders, having a variety of causes. In
West Africa, for example, short attacks of
haematuria are often attributed to exhaustÂ¬
ing work or to the consumption of indigestiÂ¬
ble food. Some symptoms may be interÂ¬
preted as signs of a venereal disease caught
by stepping in the urine of an infected perÂ¬
son or animal, or of a liver disease passed on
Malaria is one of the world's most widespread,
devastating diseases. More than half the world's
population lives in endemic areas, and an estiÂ¬
mated 8 to 9 million people die from the disease
every year. Earlier hopes of eradicating malaria
with drugs and insecticides were dashed by the
development and spread of drug-resistant
malaria parasites and of insecticide-resistant
mosquitos carrying the parasites. Now the
emphasis is on control, rather than eradication.
Strong hopes are pinned on new drugs, vaccines
and novel vector control methods. Right,
malaria surveillance workers in India take blood
samples from suspected cases.
failed to take that context into account,
especially since it often happens that no
objective cause is found for the feeling of
being unwell. Awareness of disease is a
function of previous experience, of someÂ¬
thing unusual, of the average standard of
health enjoyed by other people, of the
beliefs and traditions current in the comÂ¬
munity, of the ethnic, religious and ideoÂ¬
logical affinities of the sick person in
short, of a network of cultural factors.
Let us imagine, for example, that I sudÂ¬
denly and unexpectedly find that I have
aged thirty or forty years. At the very least,
I will feel unwell, or even really ill, whereas
my state will seem quite normal to me when
I have reached that age by natural degrees.
Similarly, the side-effects of pregnancy are
much more tolerable as such than if they
were to occur in other circumstances.
Urinary schistosomiasis provides a good
example of the ways in which a disease may
be perceived. This condition is caused by
small flatworms which attach themselves to

### The Notion of health
Still endemic in many tropical countries, mainly
in Africa, Asia and Latin America, leprosy
affects nearly 11 million people. Research into
the causes, treatment and prevention of leprosy
has been slowed down because scientists have
so far been unable to grow in laboratory condiÂ¬
tions the bacillus that causes the disease. The
discovery that the bacillus could be grown in
large numbers in the nine-banded armadillo,
above, was an important step forward in the
study of immunity to leprosy and opened the way
to new developments in the search for a leprosy
vaccine.
River blindness (onchocerciasis) is caused by
minute worms transmitted to humans by small
black flies that breed in fast-flowing water. An
estimated 40 million people are affected,
mainly in Africa. To control river blindness in
West Africa helicopters spray blackfly breeding
sites with larviclde chemicals as part of the
Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) carÂ¬
ried out by WHO. In 1984 OCP launched an
experimental project using satellite tele-
transmissions to determine in advance how
much insecticide must be used at different
points. Transmitters were set up to register the
depth and flow-rates of several rivers. They send
this information via satellite to a receiving staÂ¬
tion where it is processed by computer and given
to the pilots before they take off. Above, a data

either by flies or by a pregnant woman to
her child if she breaks certain taboos. Each
manifestation of the symptom is given a
specific form of traditional treatment.
The importance attached to a health
problem may not be the same for the indiÂ¬
vidual as for the community. The seriousÂ¬
ness of a disease depends on many factors,
such as frequency of occurrence, the numÂ¬
ber of deaths that it causes, the age at which
it is most common, or the temporary or
permanent disability that it may cause. A
disease or disorders which are very wideÂ¬
spread will be felt to be a problem of greater
concern to the individual than a deadly disÂ¬
ease which affects only a small number of
people, even if the latter is, objectively, a
more urgent problem; and preventive meaÂ¬
sures will be more readily accepted in the
former than in the latter case.
So doctors and their patients do not speak
the same language, and this is a fundamenÂ¬
tal cause of the universal malaise in mediÂ¬
cine. The developing countries have opted
resolutely for a policy of primary health
care, in accordance with the recommendaÂ¬
tions of the Alma-Ata Declaration.1 ParÂ¬
ticipation by the population is an essential
part of this grass-roots strategy. The probÂ¬
lem is how to make the best use of limited
resources to meet the needs assessed by
professionals and the demands expressed
by the population. When someone perÂ¬
ceives that he or she has a health problem,
this should, according to the planners' way
of thinking, induce the patient to turn to the
established system for help.
But reactions to discomfort or disease are
not always predictable. The possibilities are
legion: people may have recourse to their
families, friends, hawkers of medicines,
healers, herbalists, fortune-tellers,
charlatans, and so on. Equally numerous
1. In 1977, {he World Health Assembly, the governing
body of WHO, adopted a universal aim: "Health for all
by the year 2000." In 1978, an International Conference
held in Alma-Ata (USSR) declared that Primary Health
Care was the means of achieving that aim. Health care
systems based on urban medical facilities had been
judged disappointing. A new strategy, founded on basic
medical care and health education, and giving priority to
rural areas, was to be followed. Editor.
are the obstacles blocking access to the
health services: distance, financial circumÂ¬
stances, and the social and cultural gap
between those dispensing medical treatÂ¬
ment and those seeking it.
Traditional or popular medicine is more
readily available; it speaks a language comÂ¬
prehensible to patients and follows a logic
that they can understand. So it is hardly
surprising that alternative medicine is so
popular, both in the developing countries
and in the industrialized countries. Patients
are often more satisfied with it than with
conventional medicine, even if objectively
it does not improve their state of health. A
less marked difference in social status, the
emphasis placed on explaining causes and
the way in which these explanations tally
with the patient's own views on the circumÂ¬
stances and mechanisms of his or her disÂ¬
ease are all valid reasons for the popularity
of alternative medicine. The fashion for
diets or other recipes for health, often ill-
judged, which are advocated in the media
by non-specialists, suggests that this
popularity may also spread to preventive
medicine.
It would be wrong to suppose, parÂ¬
ticularly in preventive medicine, that
health at least as long as a person has
it is always at the top of that person's scale
of values. More often, social advantages
and convenience and comfort in everyday
life are put first.
All this points to two conclusions: first,
that it is necessary, before setting up a sysÂ¬
tem of health care, to evaluate all its
aspects, including the way in which its intenÂ¬
ded beneficiaries perceive health and disÂ¬
ease. Secondly, doctors should treat and
prevent disease not only as they see it, but
also as the patient experiences it, which is,
indeed, something that good doctors have
always done.

### Let the days come in'; magic and medicine of the Maya
'Let the days come in'
Magic and medicine
of the Maya
by JesÃºs F. GarcÃ­a Ruiz
THE Maya languages of Mexico and
Guatemala have no specific term to
designate the state of illness. A person
may be in one of two states: s-kaw-al-i:l (kaw
meaning sturdy, strong, whole) or kam-i (kam
meaning inert, dead, not firm). This contrast
between living and dead is the basis of
another series of connotations: a living person
is "someone who has days within him", that is,
there is time ahead to live. A sick person is
"someone who has no days", that is, his or her
days are numbered. The same image
appears in the word for "cure" the Mocho
Indians of Mexico use the expression oksa
c'a'ik, literally "to cause the days to come in".
Moreover, the term used for the concept of
being ill is kamela:! (\.o die): sickness is likened
to death. The same term is used both for the
"disease that is present in the world" the
harm that can produce disease and for the
sick person.
Diseases are divided into two broad cateÂ¬
gories, corresponding to the two natural
components of the Mocho conception of
personality:
1 . Kamela:! smani:l (disease of the body)
This is the kind of disease that affects only
externals, which "lightly touches" the person
but does not "take hold" or "get in". The
Mocho believe that such illnesses as head
colds, muscular pains, cuts and minor skin
eruptions are caused by the fact of "not taking
care of yourself". They are usually local ailÂ¬
ments that clear up quickly. This last point is
important, for a disease of the "body"which
is not serious may become a disease of the
cahci:lwhich is serious if it persists or
becomes chronic.
2. Kamela:! cahciil (disease of the vital
force)
In the Mocho language, cahci.i means the
dim, uncertain light common in foggy weather,
at dusk or at dawn. In reference to a human
being, it describes the vital force that is conÂ¬
tained in the blood and which, during the night,
leaves the body of a sleeping person to
wander in the world of the dead with the other
cahci.i who are still alive.
Diseases affecting the cahc'r.1 are always
regarded as serious; they destroy a person's
physical, psychic and social wholeness.
These are pathological states in which the
disease "gets in" and 'lakes hold", man
ifested in two kinds of symptoms: physical
(tachycardia, diarrhoea, pallor, anorexia) and
psychosomatic (inability to speak, depresÂ¬
sion, nervous troubles, amnesia).
This second category includes diseases
with strong cultural connotations with their
own special pathology, for example:
Siwel (fright), is the syndrome following a
sudden encounter which makes a person
"jump" and produces a state of fear and agitaÂ¬
tion. Such a state may be caused by an animal
(a dog or a snake), a natural phenomenon
(lightning, thunder) or an accident (falling into
a river). The person falls ill because fright
allows part of the cahci.i to escape and "lose
itself", and so he or she gets weaker every
day. Recourse must then be had to the
qamam ("defender"), in order that he may
"put out an appeal" for the cahcr.Ho return and
make the sick person whole again.
Ka:h'i'q (air), which to the Maya is an
separate element charged with positive and
negative forces. The air contains sorcerers'
spells and words which express people's bad
feelings and jealousies. If air that is charged
with negative forces enters the body, it may
cause illness.
Illnesses due to "fright" or the "air" may be
the fault of the gods or of man. Specialist
healers have to decide on the aetiology of the
disease and establish a diagnosis. Diseases
which affect the body alone do not require the
attention of a healer; they can be treated by an
old woman or a poso.m (someone who has a
knowledge of herbs). Diseases of the cahci.i,
on the other hand, are entrusted to a healer,
who acts in various ways:
Among the Mocho divination plays a part in
medical diagnosis. Above, a healer examines
the disposition of seeds to help him diagnose an
illness.
First, as an ico:m (diviner), to determine
the causes of a disease and make a diagÂ¬
nosis, by divination, or by studying the miches
(seeds). He also analyses patients' dreams
and their relationships with other people.
Second, asapo:mo:m (someone able to
offer prayers and incense), he makes offerÂ¬
ings to the gods and helps patients to get rid of
guilt feelings and to regain confidence in
themselves. He understands the use of tradiÂ¬
tional herbal remedies, and if necessary uses
some modern medicines.
Finally, as a qamam (defender), he looks
after his patients and, with a combination of
ritual and traditional phytotherapy, gives them
constant support. In this way he is responsible
for patients' health and for defending them
from a sorcerer's spells or from the "jealousy"
of an "enemy".

### Does wealth equal health?
Does wealth equal health?
by Denis-Clair Lambert
## [Page 9](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/076498engo.pdf#page=9) ðŸ†—
### Does wealth equal health?
An estimated 60 per cent of the world's women
have no adequate medical assistance, either
during pregnancy or in childbirth. Above, tradiÂ¬
tional birth attendants being trained in Ecuador.
Even short training courses can bring a sharp
drop in perinatal mortality.
SINCE the Second World War, proÂ¬
duction in the developing world has
grown at a much faster pace than in
countries which were industrialized long
ago. With an average growth rate of 5 per
cent per annum during the past thirty years,
the developing countries have quadrupled
their output and increased their share of
world production. Over the same period,
they have experienced galloping population
growth, without confirming the Malthusian
hypothesis according to which a growing
population will inevitably get poorer.
The countries whose population has
increased most rapidly (such as Brazil or
Mexico, where it has doubled in twenty-five
years) have achieved much faster economic
growth than those, such as India or ArgenÂ¬
tina, where demographic growth has been
slower. Per capita income has risen by 3.5
per cent a year, and is three times higher
than it was in 1960. And although average
incomes have been declining since 1980 in
regions such as the oil-producing Middle
East, Latin America and Africa south of the
Sahara, they are still rising very steeply in
Asia.
The health situation is also on the whole
encouraging, although the progress
observed must be qualified in two respects.
Firstly, the toll taken by wars and violence
remains concealed and does not appear in
the statistics. Secondly, the accuracy of the
figures depends on the size and modernity
of statistical services, and on the objectivity
of the information provided. Extremely
unsystematic registration of deaths can proÂ¬
duce a false impression of an improvement
in general health. Nevertheless, in the past
three decades, the infant mortality rate has
fallen by 60 per cent it is now half of what
it was in Brazil, one-third in China and one-
tenth in Hong Kong and overall mortality
risk has rarely increased, even in the
poorest countries.
The developing world is by no means
homogeneous. In a survey conducted in
1982 on ninety-nine developing countries,
1 1 the American demographer John Caldwell
Â£ drew attention to the diversity of conditions
in those countries where a steep decline in
mortality rates has been observed. He sinÂ¬
gled out ten factors which he compared with
mortality indicators in order to find out
whether there was any correlation between
them. Whereas the correlation between per
capita income and infant mortality was not
statistically significant, two other factors
appeared to be crucial: education,
especially of girls, and the prevalence of
family planning. Caldwell concluded that
there are two contrasting groups of counÂ¬
tries, which he called "superior health
achievers" and "poor health achievers"
respectively. In each group, there are poor
countries and rich countries. What is the
reason for these divergencies?
The most rapid gains in life expectancy-
appear in regions where average food supÂ¬
plies exceed the minimum norms laid down
by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO). In the past
two decades, the per capita food supply has
increased. This trend is particularly apparÂ¬
ent in Asia, where the benefits of the Green
Revolution (see the Unesco Courier, March
1987) appeared earlier than in Latin AmerÂ¬
ica. In Central America, the Caribbean and
the Andean countries, precarious food sitÂ¬
uations have been to some extent instruÂ¬
mental in maintaining higher death rates.
However, the most densely populated
countries of the region, such as Brazil and
Mexico, have achieved notable improveÂ¬
ments in life expectancy.
Standards of living in countries where
there has been a rapid improvement in the
health situation are twice as high in Latin
America and Southern Europe and four
times higher in Eastern Asia than they were
twenty years ago. The density of medical
and hospital coverage has greatly increased.
The ten or more semi-industrialized counÂ¬
tries in these three regions consume far
more pharmaceutical products than the rest
of the developing world. Immunization, the
availability of antibiotics and access to medÂ¬
ical care all make for efficient treatment and
prevention of disease.
Action to reduce the death rate in a popuÂ¬
lation which is in the early stages of a demoÂ¬
graphic revolution must be taken in the first
few years of life. In this demographic situaÂ¬
tion , where on average 45 per cent of deaths
are of children under the age of five, infant
and juvenile mortality can be reduced withÂ¬
out substantial investment. It is here that
densely populated and easily accessible
areas enjoy a considerable advantage.
Poor islands such as Sri Lanka, and
relatively rich ones such as Trinidad, have
succeeded in less than a generation in
achieving the kind of mortality rates found
in European countries. So have cities such
as Hong Kong and Singapore, where the
male death rate is comparable to that of
Sweden. The excessively high death rates
recorded over very extensive areas, in BraÂ¬
zil or in Mexico, for example, are a result of
imbalances in land-use planning pockets
of poverty in the Brazilian Nordeste, demoÂ¬
graphic vacuums in the interior and inÂ¬
equalities in the density of medical
coverage.
As Caldwell shows, there is a close corÂ¬
relation between female education and famÂ¬
ily planning, and a reduction in the infant
mortality rate. Advances in education and
falling death and birth rates are also associÂ¬
ated with the employment situation. One
out of every two or three adults in the cities
of Latin America and Africa is unemÂ¬
ployed, and it is abundantly clear that
unemployment goes hand in hand with the
disintegration of the family and the preÂ¬
carious living conditions which make for
high rates of mortality and disease.
Health and preventive care policies
The economic and social systems of counÂ¬
tries whose health situation has rapidly
improved are so diverse that few analogies
can be drawn. Wealthy Kuwait has
achieved a very rapid decrease in its morÂ¬
tality rate by deploying substantial medical
resources and providing free health care.
Sri Lanka has won equally impressive
results with a medical coverage density

three times less than that of India where,
incidentally, the province of Kerala has
achieved remarkable improvements which
are not commensurate with its standard of
living, health budget or number of doctors.
In Central America, the health indicators of
Costa Rica have puzzled observers for some
time.
The most spectacular results, however,
are those of East Asian countries. The
American economist Harvey Leibenstein
has suggested that these baffling exceptions
could be interpreted by reference to an
"efficiency factor X" resulting from the
spirit of enterprise and initiative shown by
the people who live in these countries.
More recently, another economist, Thomas
Sowell, has looked closely at international
migrations. The speed of assimilation of disÂ¬
placed Asian communities, for example,
may be due partly to family cohesion,
eagerness to learn and foresight.
It is noteworthy that recourse to social
security or national health services is
relatively low in Eastern Asia. Household
saving rates are high (the average SinÂ¬
gaporean saves more than the average
Swiss). Hygiene, education and general
precautions help to prevent accidents and
illness. Advice about prevention is effective
only if the family unit functions as a prevenÂ¬
tion centre.
"Poor health achievers"
These are countries whose health indicators
are much worse than their economic indicaÂ¬
tors. Some oil-producing countries, for
example, have the same health indicators as
African countries ten or twenty times
poorer than themselves. The same situation
arises in Central and South America,
where, in countries which have shown good
medical results for many years, gains in
health have become minimal. Poor health
achievements are related to factors which
are at variance with those mentioned
above.
If we take infant mortality rates greater
than 100 to 150 per thousand in 1985 (and if
we exclude the wealthy oil-producing counÂ¬
tries), in most cases per capita income has
fallen sharply over the past twenty years. In
Africa, this decline has nearly always been
accompanied by a reduction in food supÂ¬
plies. These very poor countries usually
have only a veneer of industrialization and
an agriculture based on a single crop which
is incapable of producing a surplus. Their
health systems are inevitably restricted by
the scarcity economy. Lack of foreign curÂ¬
rency precludes the purchase of the mediÂ¬
cines and equipment needed to prevent and
cure costly diseases.
The "poor health achievers" are counÂ¬
tries where adult women are practically
excluded from education. Only half as
many women as men are educated in Zaire
and in Mozambique, one-sixth as many in
Afghanistan and Nepal and one-eighteenth
as many in Yemen: this goes some way
towards explaining the difficulty of reducÂ¬
ing infant mortality rates. It is not surprising
that, in the same countries, very high ferÂ¬
tility rates persist and the birth rate has
scarcely changed.
Insofar as high infant mortality rates and
the prevalence of infectious diseases can be
traced back beyond health systems, poor
achievements on the health front cannot be
dissociated from poor economic achieveÂ¬
ment. All too often, primary health care
networks mask an inefficient bureaucracy,
and the bulk of a country's resources is
absorbed by hospitals to the detriment of
rural dispensaries. And it is impossible to
overlook excessive arms spending, debt serÂ¬
vicing, shaky economic policies and the misÂ¬
use of internal and external resources. In an
age of famine and permanent warfare,
authoritarian political and military systems
can hardly be expected to eradicate povÂ¬
erty, hunger, ignorance and disease.
The most precarious states of health in
traditional agrarian societies are often couÂ¬
pled with the absence of modern medicine.
There are no medical supplies, doctors or
hospitals. These health care vacuums still
prevail in vast underpopulated areas, notaÂ¬
bly in Africa. However, it is important not
to underestimate the consequences of the
population shift away from the countryside,
which has sent two-thirds of the population
pouring into the towns in the countries

around the Mediterranean, in Latin AmerÂ¬
ica and in Eastern Asia. Uprooted families
disintegrate in the shanty towns. The causes
of the unduly high death and disease rates
that the West is discovering in new forms of
urban poverty (see the Unesco Courier,
January 1987) inevitably exist in more acute
form in the developing world. But social
groups living in precarious conditions,
whether or not they receive assistance from
the authorities, are improvident and do not
of their own accord adopt the preventive
behaviour patterns which are the most
effective weapon in the war on alcoholism,
drug abuse and sexually transmitted
diseases.
Some countries, following a long ecoÂ¬
nomic decline, are experiencing a gradual
erosion of their former health achieveÂ¬
ments. In Argentina, for example, the denÂ¬
sity of medical coverage today is still twice
that of the Republic of Korea; there are
more hospital beds and life expectancy is
higher. But the infant mortality rate is lower
in the Republic of Korea, and even in Chile
and Costa Rica, than it is in Argentina. And
yet in 1950 the health indicators for ArgenÂ¬
tina were better than those for France,
while male life expectancy in Korea was
comparable to that of Bangladesh today.
New causes of mortality
As infectious diseases and infant mortality
take a diminishing toll, gains in life expecÂ¬
tancy must be obtained by overcoming the
risks that threaten adolescents and adults.
The increase in life expectancy and the
change in the age composition of the
population bring new priorities for health
policy.
Falling death rates are due primarily to
the decrease in infectious diseases.
Attempts to tackle the causes of infant and
juvenile mortality produce appreciable
gains in life expectancy for a relatively small
investment. But once infant mortality has
been lowered by health and nutrition eduÂ¬
cation and by the distribution of vaccines
and antibiotics, health action becomes less
efficient. Gains against mortality now have
to be won in a high risk area.
The primary causes of rising death rates
are road accidents and violence. As in the
old European countries and in North AmerÂ¬
ica, accidental death has become the main
contributor to mortality figures for young
people in the developing world. The cost in
human lives of the increase in road traffic in
the cities of developing countries is seldom
appreciated. There are many serious acciÂ¬
dents, and emergency treatment and afterÂ¬
care facilities are limited. For a young adult
in SÃ¤o Paulo, the probability of dying in a
road accident increased tenfold between
1940 and 1980. The same is true of homiÂ¬
cide. Dependence on alcohol and drugs can
increase these risks.
The second trend in mortality rates is due
to the rise of chronic degenerative diseases.
Today, countries such as Brazil have a small
proportion of elderly people but in the next
generation there will be a rapid increase in
the number of over-sixties. Already, carÂ¬
diovascular diseases and cancer have
become the main causes of mortality. Con-
In co-operation with the World Health OrganizaÂ¬
tion (WHO), Unesco encourages the use of the
media in health and nutrition education.
Spacing births reduces death Illiteracy
Nearly two out of every three illiterate people
are women. Yet an educated woman not only
enjoys better health herselfshe has a positive
influence on the health and well-being of her
entire family.

### Does wealth equal health?
"As In the old European countries and in North
America, accidental death has become the main
contributor to mortality figures for young people
in the developing world. ... There are many
serious accidents, and emergency treatment
and after-care facilities are limited."
sequently, the future increase in life expecÂ¬
tancy will depend on the resources allocated
to treat these costly diseases. When the
human life-span attains and exceeds sevÂ¬
enty years, the survival of cardiac patients,
cancer sufferers, diabetics or kidney
patients cannot be guaranteed without
medicines, specialized services and
qualified doctors.
The crisis in health systems in the West
should be a warning to authorities in other
world regions. The Japanese, for example,
by mobilizing only half the resources
deployed by the North Americans, have
achieved the world's highest life expectancy
and lowest death rate.
Health systems, like political systems,
tend by a process of imitation to reproduce
existing health models. Following the domiÂ¬
nant trend, developing countries have
transposed Soviet, Chinese, North AmerÂ¬
ican or European systems, but these have
seldom proved appropriate to local condiÂ¬
tions. The results are often less encouraging
than they were for the original model.
Recourse to medical solutions is often
premature. It is preferable to do everything
possible to preserve family and community
structures which can provide routine care.
In this way, the very high cost of hospitalizaÂ¬
tion of the mentally ill, children, expectant
mothers, the elderly and invalids can be to
some extent deferred.
Lastly, "hospitalocentrism" is the most
common pitfall for Western systems transÂ¬
posed to other countries. The cost of a hosÂ¬
pital is always underestimated. It tends to
become the pivot of the system and to suck
in all its resources. Today, public health
budgets are frozen, and resources for primÂ¬
ary health care networks in the form of
manpower and funds have been reduced.
In conclusion, it seems that an improveÂ¬
ment in general health is within the reach of
the poorest countries, and more parÂ¬
ticularly the semi-industrialized developing
countries. However, these are transitional
improvements. In order to overcome new
causes of morbidity and mortality, these
countries must in future devote more
money to their health systems. As they
often have to cope with a difficult internaÂ¬
tional climate and continue their economic
development efforts at the same time, a
variety of ways of financing health care
seems the best approach. It is noteworthy
that the most spectacular successes in this
respect, in the industrialized countries of
Eastern Asia, are due to a judicious comÂ¬
bination of public expenditure and private
financing.

### A Chance for every child
A chance
for every
child
by Michel Rey
THE goal of the Expanded
Programme on Immunization
(EPI), launched by the World
Health Organization in 1974, is to ensure
that by 1990 all the world's children are
protected against six killer diseases: meaÂ¬
sles, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis
(whooping cough), tetanus and tuberÂ¬
culosis.
These six target diseases have been given
priority because each year they cause hunÂ¬
dreds of thousands of deaths and tens of
thousands of disabilities. Now they can be
prevented by immunization. In theory meaÂ¬
sles and polio are eradicable, and diphÂ¬
theria and whooping cough can be pracÂ¬
tically eliminated. For the other two
diseases, the aims of EPI are rather difÂ¬
ferent. The Programme gives priority to the
prevention of neonatal tetanus; and conÂ¬
fines itself to tuberculosis in children, of
which the most serious manifestation is
tuberculous meningitis. The BCG antiÂ¬
tuberculosis vaccine1 only protects children

French scientists who produced the first attenuated
tuberculosis vaccine in 1906.

A key factor in the implementation of WHO'S
Expanded Programme on Immunization, which
aims at protecting all children against measles,
polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and
tuberculosis by 1990, is called the "cold chain"
system. The cold chain ensures that vaccines
retain their potency from the time of manufacÂ¬
ture to their use. Although there may be no
visible signs of deterioration, vaccines lose
potency when exposed to heat. To show whether
or not the cold chain has been broken, a special
temperature sensitive chemical monitor has
been designed (above), to be attached to record
cards in the national language of the destination
country. The monitor has four windows, A to D,
and when placed in cold boxes or refrigerators
with the vaccines, it turns blue window by winÂ¬
dow as the temperature rises.
The slogan chosen for World Health Day (7 April)
1987 was "Immunization: a chance for every
child". Below, stamps issued by the United
Nations Postal Administration to highlight

against contamination and cannot change
the epidemiology of the disease, which is
carried and transmitted mainly through
adults.
EPI is implemented in two ways. The
main thrust is the immunization of children
under a year old, who are given the six
vaccines over at least three sessions. The
second line of attack, against neonatal tetÂ¬
anus, is aimed at pregnant women and other
women of childbearing age. Here, immuÂ¬
nization before birth protects the child.
The aims of the Programme are
ambitious. For the moment the chief objecÂ¬
tive is to give all the world's children access
to immunization services. It is accepted that
between now and 1990 it will be difficult to
achieve the 90 per cent level of immunizaÂ¬
tion coverage initially projected for the
group of six vaccines. A 70 to 80 per cent
coverage rate would be satisfactory. For
neonatal tetanus, a more precise objective
has been defined for 1990: reduction of its
incidence to less than one case per thousand
live births in countries which are still
relatively widely affected and to eradicate
the disease entirely in those countries where
it has become a rarity.
EPI can be distinguished from other preÂ¬
ventive medicine campaigns by the signifiÂ¬
cant technological and operational conÂ¬
straints it faces, and by the fact that this
form of prevention is basically managed by
health services, the resources of which are
mobilized at all levels.
The first constraint concerns the supply
of vaccine. Vaccines are increasingly comÂ¬
plex biological products, manufactured
using advanced technology, and they are
still largely made by industrialized counÂ¬
tries. There are many obstacles to local proÂ¬
duction. Even India, a relatively well equipÂ¬
ped country with a vast internal market, has
not yet succeeding in producing all the vacÂ¬
cines it needs for domestic consumption.
The use of low-quality, cheaply produced
vaccines is unacceptable. Such vaccines are
often less efficient, and are also less well
tolerated. They will jeopardize the success
of the Programme by discouraging people
from taking part in it. Much of the vaccine
used by EPI is supplied by internaÂ¬
tional organizations or aid agencies and
must conform with WHO standards.
The preservation of vaccines necessitates
the maintenance of an uninterrupted "cold
chain". In many cases, the absence or
breakdown of this chain has meant the
failure of immunization, especially using
heat-sensitive live vaccine such as
the measles or the oral polio vaccines. A
less temperature-sensitive measles vaccine
has recently been developed, but the cold
chain is still necessary.
Finally, most vaccines are administered
by injection and syringes and needles have
to be very carefully sterilized. It is possible
for tetanus to be transmitted by the injecÂ¬
tion, and today the risks of transmitting
hepatitis B and AIDS by syringes must be
stressed.
How can maximum numbers of the target
populations be reached? Priority has been
given to the integration of immunization
into primary health care. Even if village
health workers cannot give injections or
keep records, they can play a significant
role in informing and mobilizing the popuÂ¬
lation. Obviously this grass-roots participaÂ¬
tion does not exclude action by other
branches of the health services.
If health centres generally bear the main
responsibility for routine immunization, the
lack of such centres in many rural areas
creates the need for small mobile teams to
immunize the people in or near their
homes. Mothers cannot be expected to walk
more than three kilometres from their
homes in order to have their children immuÂ¬
nized. It is admirable enough that they are
willing to make even this effort towards preÂ¬
ventive care. One major problem of immuÂ¬
nization campaigns is opening individual
files on all children from birth onwards, so
as to record the injections they are given,
maintain personal contact with their famÂ¬
ilies and keep track of the negligent.
When immunization by health centres is
not feasible, or when the results are
unsatisfactory, mass campaigns can be
launched, on a local or national scale. This
has been done in Brazil, with the oral polio
vaccine, and in Colombia with the six EPI
vaccines. The advantage of such campaigns,
which can assume the guise of a national
festival, is that they mobilize more of the
population and enable large numbers of
people to be immunized, at least at first.
Their epidemiological effect is more specÂ¬
tacular and for a time they can interrupt the
transmission of certain diseases. But they
are only a means of getting the Programme
under way.
What are the achievements of EPI to
date? The evaluation of immunization
coverage, often effected by poll, shows
great differences between countries (from
less than 10 per cent to over 80 per cent).
This wide range reflects different levels of
social and economic development and
clearly shows that it is easier to achieve a
rapid increase in immunization coverage
where there are well-developed health
infrastructures.
One of the biggest problems is the fall in
family participation between the first and
last immunization session, a rate which can
be as high as 50 per cent. The older the
child, the lower the rate of participation.
The BCG vaccine, which is given earliest,
has been the most successful from this point
of view. It should not be forgotten that in
the United States it took twenty years to
achieve a 95 per cent coverage of measles
immunization, the level at which eradicaÂ¬
tion of the disease can be envisaged.
Efforts are thus being made, in the case of
measles, for example, to immunize nearer
birth. This shortening of the immunization
timetable is also a response to the need to
immunize children as soon as possible' after
birth, before they are exposed to natural
infection.
Another vital factor in the success of the
Programme is continuous health education,
which, if it is to be effective, must take into
account the way in which disease is perÂ¬
ceived in different cultures (see article
page 4). Moreover, as the Programme conÂ¬
tinues and the incidence of the target disÂ¬
eases falls, the people start to be less afraid
of them and lose interest. This is where

education can be effective. Finally, the
major role played by women in the success
of the Programme cannot be over-emphaÂ¬
sized. It is they who have their children
immunized, it is they who must be informed
and won over.
The true effectiveness of EPI is measured
in terms of morbidity2 and mortality.3 These
factors are the most difficult to evaluate at
present due to the lack of reliable epiÂ¬
demiological monitoring. Three indices are
studied: the incidence of paralytic polÂ¬
iomyelitis, death from measles and death
from neonatal tetanus. The regression of
these diseases is notable in most Latin
American countries, and the incidence of
neonatal tetanus has fallen dramatically in
Bangladesh. The results for measles have
on the whole been rather disappointing,
and can be explained by inadequate immuÂ¬
nization coverage, by the impossibility of
administering the measles vaccine to chilÂ¬
dren under six months, and by the difficulty
of preserving the vaccine, which until
recently was very susceptible to heat.
As a result of all the technological and
operational constraints it faces, EPI is
relatively expensive. A full course of immuÂ¬
nization for a child costs from $3 to $50 (the
present average being $10). The cost of the
vaccine itself hardly represents 10 per cent
of this sum, most of the remainder being

ease in a specific locality.

used to cover staff or operational costs.
Many poor countries cannot afford such
expenditure and receive outside aid. The
disadvantage of this is that a situation of
dependence is created.
EPI is nevertheless considered to be one
of the most profitable operations in prevenÂ¬
tive medicine. Its "profitability" is meaÂ¬
sured in human terms (in the sparing of
lives, and in the reduction of suffering and
of disabling after-effects), rather than in
strictly economic terms.
Finally, in addition to the direct advanÂ¬
tages of immunization (reduction of morÂ¬
bidity and mortality from the six target disÂ¬
eases) a number of perhaps even more
important indirect advantages can probably
be added, such as improving the child's
nutritional state, which is greatly affected
by whooping cough and measles. Another
expected advantage is the strengthening of
health services at all levels. EPI is thus
acting as a pacemaker in health care
development.

### Complementary medicine
pluralistic approach to healing
Complementary medicine by Stephen Fulder
COMPLEMENTARY medicine, also
called natural, alternative, tradiÂ¬
tional or unconventional medicine,
encompasses a variety of therapeutic sysÂ¬
tems which are linked by the fact that they
are different from conventional medicine.
The central therapies are acupuncture, chiÂ¬
ropractic, healing, herbalism, homeopathy,
hypnotherapy, therapeutic massage,
naturopathy and osteopathy. Other systems
may be developed in theory and practice
but are not so well known in Western counÂ¬
tries, such as anthroposophical1 or AyurÂ¬
vedic medicine.
In all these cases there is a diagnostic
procedure, a theory to account for the
origin, development and cure of sickness,
an established body of practical knowledge,
and a professional grouping of practiÂ¬
tioners. The theory and practice may be far
removed from that of conventional mediÂ¬
cine for example acupuncture is partly
based on concepts of circulating vital
energy, and of ying/yang. Nevertheless
these therapies can exist in partnership
with, rather than competition with, conÂ¬
ventional medicine. Therefore we prefer
the term "complementary" rather than
"alternative", "natural" or "unconvenÂ¬
tional" medicine.
Despite their diversity, theories of comÂ¬
plementary medicine are united by certain
common features. One important common
element is that they encourage and elicit
self-healing. Homeopathy uses minute
doses of plants that mimic the symptoms of
the disease, while herbalism utilizes large
doses of other plants to undermine the
symptoms. Yet both homeopathic and
herbal remedies are given specifically to
stimulate natural recuperative processes.
Symptoms do not have the same meaning
in complementary medicine as they do in
conventional medicine. They are not conÂ¬
sidered as untoward signs that must be

attacked when they appear, but as guides to
underlying imbalances, vulnerabilities and
idiosyncrasies, and as monitors of progress
towards health. To take one example, a
traditional acupuncturist will examine, with
considerable sensitivity, the skin colour,
voice, tongue, eyes, pains and the flow
characteristics of blood within several
pulses. From these data he reads the inteÂ¬
rior organ dysfunctions of the patient. As he
strives to correct these dysfunctions, he
watches how the signs and symptoms
change as a result of the treatment to make
sure he is on the right track.
The patient is treated as an individual.
There is little interest in statistical or popuÂ¬
lation norms; instead the individual is his or
her own point of reference. A weak pulse
may, for example, be quite normal in one
constitutional type and a sign of sickness in
another. Health is defined as the optimal
function and longevity of the individual. In
addition, since the whole person, rather
than the disease, is the focus of treatment,
there is no practical or philosophical reason
to erect barriers such as that between mind
and body. Lifestyle, cast of mind, mood,
energy, posture or constitution are all as
relevant diagnostically as the physical signs.
Complementary medicine today is the
descendant of traditional and folk mediÂ¬
cine: herbalism descends from shamanism
and folk remedies, chiropractic and
osteopathy from bone setting, homeopathy
from like-cures-like principles, naturopathy
from the Hippocratic tradition.
Curiously, scientific medicine traces its
origins to those same roots, via Galen of
Pergamum in the 2nd century AD.
However, it has diverged over the last 150
years towards a complete, perhaps exaggerÂ¬
ated expression of specificity principles.
That is, ill-health consists of a specific set of
symptoms, defined as a specific disease,
which is cured by the precise treatment for
that condition. This is in marked contrast to
the Hippocratism of complementary and
traditional medicine which regards ill-
health as a vulnerability derived from
imbalances within the individual. Complete
cure is only possible by restoring the equiÂ¬
librium crasis with the help of self-
healing capacities the vix medicatrix
naturae.
The specificity approach achieved comÂ¬
plete dominance during the last century,
after a bitter struggle. The traditionalists
called the new practitioners quacks, and
modern medicine replied by ridiculing the
traditionalists' arcane doctrines and
witches' brews. The outcome was sealed
with the help of new drugs extracted, ironÂ¬
ically, from the plants of the herbalists. The
spectacular results of aspirin, digitalis,
quinine and opium left the traditionalists
with their principles but no patients. The
traditional systems were effectively outÂ¬
lawed all over the modern world. A
resurgence of interest only began in the
1960s, mainly through the realization that
modern medicine bears a heavy cost in
resources and side effects. In addition it
became clear that many chronic conditions
that are related to lifestyle, such as back
pain or atherosclerosis, could yield to comÂ¬
plementary medicine's gentler, more inteÂ¬
grated, approach. .

Moxa, or moxibusticn, is a traditional Chinese
therapy in which small cones of dried plant
material are burned on specific points of the
body (generally the same as those used in acuÂ¬
puncture). The term "moxa" is derived from the
name of the wormwood plant most frequently
used, Artemisia moxa. Right, a Tibetan doctor
applies a variant of moxa treatment in which the
heat is transmitted to the patient's skin by a
needle. The circle ol card is used to collect the
ashes.

practitioners? For ideological reasons?
Because of advertising? Or only as a result
of disappointments elsewhere? A survey
conducted in the Netherlands in 1980 found
that 40 per cent of the patients of compleÂ¬
mentary practitioners sought them as a
result of prior inadequate or unsuccessful
treatment of the same ailment by doctors.
This was confirmed by a government-sponÂ¬
sored study in Australia which showed that
necessity, not belief, brought people to
unorthodox clinics.
Furthermore, complementary medicine
does not fill gaps left by modern medicine.
Several studies have indicated the opposite,
that complementary medicine flourishes in
areas that are especially well served mediÂ¬
cally. This supports the notion that it
provides another alternative in cases where
conventional medicine has failed. The
patients, too, tend to be slightly more eduÂ¬
cated and slightly better off than the
national average.
If that is the case, the kind of health probÂ¬
lems that arrive at the door of the compleÂ¬
mentary practitioner might be expected to
be the failures of conventional medicine, an
indication of the potential partnership
between the conventional and complemenÂ¬
tary systems. The failure areas of conÂ¬
ventional medicine are well known. They
are usually chronic conditions, often musÂ¬
culoskeletal problems connected to lifeÂ¬
style, such as back pain and arthritis,
chronic pain such as migraine or neuralgia,
chronic infections such as bronchitis, ulceri-
tive colitis, urethritis, allergic conditions,
fatigue, insomnia and debility, cardiovascuÂ¬
lar problems and stress-related disorders.
These conditions are generally managed
rather than cured, as in the administration
of cortisone for allergies and painkillers for
back pain.
Evaluative studies on complementary
medicine have shown that it is at least as
successful as conventional medicine in the
short-term treatment of conditions it comÂ¬
monly treats. The few studies on the long-
term management of such conditions usuÂ¬
ally put complementary medicine on top.
Many studies show, for example, that acuÂ¬
puncture or hypnosis are as effective as
painkillers in pain relief and can be more
effective in the long term. A much-disÂ¬
cussed trial conducted in 1980 at the
Glasgow Royal Infirmary (U.K.) reported
that homeopathy is as successful as conÂ¬
ventional drugs in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis.
At the same time, polls of patients have
reported remarkable satisfaction with comÂ¬
plementary medicine. The Netherlands,
Australian and other studies report that
more than 80 per cent of patients would
recommend complementary treatment to
others. Those who were not happy with
their complementary practitioner were
found to be uncured but unharmed, while
those dissatisfied with their doctor were
uncured but not necessarily unharmed.
An incidental boon has been gained from
research into complementary medicine:
new sources of ideas and principles have
emerged. Study of analgesia by acupuncÂ¬
ture, for example, has brought a new under
standing of the mechanisms of pain control.
A number of new drug entities are being
introduced as a result of research into tradiÂ¬
tional folk remedies. Indeed it has been
calculated that if traditional practitioners
are consulted, as opposed to random
screening, the rate of discovery of pharÂ¬
macologically-active ingredients is
increased from much less than 1 per cent to
40 per cent.
The development of complementary
medicine poses questions to government
authorities and the entire medical establishÂ¬
ment. How can traditional acupuncture be
incorporated into a medical insurance
scheme? How can laymen practise
alongside medical professionals? How can
the different medical specialities communiÂ¬
cate with one another when their language,
concepts and practices are so widely difÂ¬
ferent? It is quite clear that if complemenÂ¬
tary medicine is to be absorbed into the
mainstream of medical care some fundaÂ¬
mental reappraisals will be necessary. If it is
not to be so absorbed, complementary medÂ¬
icine will simply continue to receive more
patients from the mainstream.
The major requirement is for education.
If trainee doctors could learn in medical
schools what complementary medicine is,
and what it can do, they would learn how to
co-operate with its practitioners, as in
China and indeed in the USSR where a
restricted form of acupuncture teaching is
available in medical schools. At the same
time practitioners of complementary mediÂ¬
cine should be helped to improve their bioÂ¬
medical knowledge, an area of acknowlÂ¬
edged weakness today.
The wise employment of complementary
medicine would save much unnecessary use
of medical resources and hospital beds. The
preventive approach could be used to catch
conditions before expensive and dangerous
medical intervention was needed. If hyperÂ¬
tension and arteriosclerosis were treated by
diet, herbs and techniques of relaxation,
coronary intensive care units and the heart
surgeons might be put out of business.
A more preventive attitude would be
required throughout the medical establishÂ¬
ment. Medical care would shift away from
technology-intensive centres into the comÂ¬
munity. Treatment would be more personal
as long-term therapeutic relationships
would be built up between patient and
therapist. Medical insurance would be
required to broaden its definitions of treatÂ¬
ment and take a longer-term view. Even the
hospitals would change their character.
Besides providing last-resort care, which
will always be necessary, they could become
teaching centres. As well as teaching docÂ¬
tors, as they do now, there is no reason why
they could not teach patients too.

### Plant therapy in the fight against cancer
Plant therapy
in the fight
against cancer
by Xing Sishao
IN China, many practitioners of traditional
medicine are making a unique contribuÂ¬
tion to the fight against cancer by combinÂ¬
ing their clinical experience with the heritage
of ancient Chinese medicine. One of them is
Professor Duan Fengwu, Chief of the Tumour
Department of the Beijing Guang'anmen HosÂ¬
pital, which is affiliated to the China Academy
of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
Professor Duan has treated about 1 0,000
cancer sufferers since his hospital opened its
Tumour Department in 1962. In China, on
average only 29 per cent of patients with
stomach cancer survive for as long as five
years after treatment with Western medicine,
yet the figure stands at 55.23 per cent in the
cases that he has treated.
According to Professor Duan, treatment of
cancer with traditional Chinese medicines can
be traced back as far as the Yin Dynasty (1 2th
century BC). Ai, the current Chinese name for
cancers, appeared for the first time in two
medical works published in the Sung Dynasty
(960-1279), the Weiji Treasure Book and the
Ren House Directory of Medicine. The latter
includes this description: "Ai rises beneath the
skin and reaches deep in the flesh. When
dissected, it looks like the inside of a karst
grotto; small lumps, some blue, protrude like
outward-thrusting eyeballs and each has a tip
sticking out. Their poisonous roots are buried
deep in the body." As a description of maligÂ¬
nant tumours it is very similar to that of modern
Western medicine.
According to Professor Duan, 200 kinds of
traditional Chinese drugs and medicinal herbs
can be used to treat cancer, about 80 of which
are the most commonly used. "We have studÂ¬
ied some of them in particular," he says, "and
most are effective in checking the growth of
tumours, alleviating clinical symptoms and
stimulating the immune reaction within the
human body, thus extending the life of the
patients.
"Traditional Chinese medicine holds that
though cancer afflicts only a certain part of the
body, it is a disease affecting the whole body.
In treating cancer, therefore, the condition of
the entire body should be taken into considÂ¬
eration and special attention should be paid to
internal factors when analysing the cause of
the disease. The relationship between
strengthening the patient's constitution and
dispelling the invading pathogenic factors
should be handled properly."
In his long career of treating cancer
patients, Professor Duan attaches great
importance to the harmony of yin and yang1 in
regulating xue (blood) and qi (vital energy). By
using traditional drugs and herbs, he seeks a
restoration of balance between yin and yang
in a patient. After his treatment, many patients
have recovered and a number of serious
cases have even lived on for more than ten
years.
Professor Duan says that ginseng, for
example, functions mainly as a tonic for the
vital energy of the body; it can stop prostration
and replenish the body fluid and it has been
effective in dealing with malfunction of body
organs due to deficiency of vital energy.
"However", he added, "ginseng is not
omnipotent. It must not be abused, otherwise
it harms rather than benefits the health. Two
kinds of extracts from ginseng have been
seen to activate the immune reaction in the
human body. They can enhance phaÂ¬
gocytosis2 and stimulate the growth of antiÂ¬
bodies. Some doctors think that these ginÂ¬
seng extracts can directly destroy cancer cells
or reverse their development."
Professor Duan believes that traditional
Chinese medicine, radiotherapy and chemoÂ¬
therapy all have advantages and disadvan-
Above, pharmacists weigh medicinal herbs at
Beijing's Tong Ren Tang drugstore, which has
specialized in traditional Chinese medicine for
over 300 years.
1. Yin and yang: the two fundamental principles or
forces in the universe, ever opposing and complementÂ¬
ing each other an ancient philosophical concept used
in traditional Chinese medicine to refer to various antithÂ¬
eses in anatomy, physiology, pathology, diagnosis and
treatment, e.g. feminine, interior, cold and hypofunction
being yin, while masculine, exterior, heat and hyper-
function are yang.

tages in the fight against cancers.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been
very effective in treating some malignant
tumours by killing the cancer cells or by stuntÂ¬
ing their growth, but their biggest drawback is
the indiscrimination with which they destroy
cells. Some patients die of the complications
caused by such treatment instead of the canÂ¬
cer itself. The advantage of traditional ChiÂ¬
nese drugs and medicinal herbs, on the other
hand, is that they have few adverse side-
effects. They can strengthen the patients'
resistance and immunity and summon the
"vital energy" of the whole body to battle
against the disease.
As Professor Duan says: "We should supÂ¬
plement traditional Chinese medicine with
modern Western medicine. It seems to me
that a combination of these methods may
prove to be the best way to fight cancer. We
are all looking forward to the day when manÂ¬
kind can conquer this fatal disease."

tional Chinese medicine section and associate
senior editorofa Chinesejournal on health. He is
the author of several books, including "Famous
Contemporary Doctors".

A fraction of the pharmaceutical products on the market
would be enough to satisfy human needs

### Overdose
Overdose
Â©
by Georges Peters
The vast range of pharmaceutical products on
sale in many developed and developing counÂ¬
tries is not medically justified and helps to
encourage an excessive demand for drugs which
drains the resources of health services.
APPROXIMATELY 90 per cent of
all drugs produced for human use
are manufactured and delivered in
ready-to-use form by the pharmaceutical
industries. Only in exceptional cases are
drugs concocted by pharmacists or healers.
The developing countries, inhabited by 80
per cent of the world's population, consume
from 15 to 20 per cent of the world's pharÂ¬
maceutical output. Drug consumption is
tending to rise more rapidly in these counÂ¬
tries than in wealthy countries.
On the other hand, the developing world
produces only 10 per cent of all drugs con
sumed, and production is confined to a few
countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Egypt,
India, Mexico and Pakistan. The other
developing countries are obliged to buy all
their drugs from the rich countries and to
spend a substantial portion of their health
budget, or even of their national budget, on
such purchases. Even so, many of them are
still unable to satisfy the most pressing
needs of the majority of their population.
It is thus clear why developing countries
and international organizations should take
an interest in pharmaceutical industries.
These industries developed in the late

### Overdose
nineteenth century, usually as divisions of
chemical-manufacturing firms which were
dissatisfied with their position as suppliers
of cheap ingredients for medicines which
were then sold at high prices by the pharmaÂ¬
cists. In a bid for some of the profits, they
launched specialized pharmaceutical prodÂ¬
ucts under protected brand names. The link
between the manufacture of pharmaceutiÂ¬
cals and the chemical industry is so imporÂ¬
tant economically that nearly all the drug-
manufacturing industries belong to
chemical-industrial complexes. Only these
chemical-pharmaceutical trusts manufacÂ¬
ture drugs from non-medicinal raw mateÂ¬
rials, and they alone are in a position to
develop new drugs.
Pharmaceutical innovation calls for cliniÂ¬
cal and biological research on which the big
manufacturers (which present themselves
as members of a pharmaceutical industry
based pn research) spend an average 9 per
cent of their turnover, approximately 4.5
per cent of the final resale price of their
products. This is less than half the amount
they spend on advertising. Most of the 120
companies which dominate 90 per cent of
the world pharmaceutical market and the 25
multinational corporations which produce
60 per cent of all pharmaceutical products,
belong to this industry. Their average
annual turnover amounts to $750 million.
The manufacture of pharmaceuticals
calls for substantial capital investment.
Because of the automation of manufacturÂ¬
ing processes, the industry creates very few
jobs. Pharmaceutical companies differ from
other businesses primarily in that they manÂ¬
ufacture a product which consumers do not
usually choose themselves but which is
recommended to them directly or indirectly
by a doctor. Moreover, the demand for and
sales of drugs far outstrip needs.
The world market of $200,000 million a
year corresponds to $50 per person per
annum spent on medicines. Less than a
quarter of this amount should suffice to
satisfy all medically justifiable needs. The
remainder is spent in an attempt to treat
symptoms or illnesses which will not resÂ¬
pond to this form of treatment, or to
improve vigour and general health (someÂ¬
thing that no drug will do), or to satisfy a
craving for certain drugs which has been
created by their use in the past. Overcon-
sumption of drugs is particularly wideÂ¬
spread in the affluent countries, where per
capita spending can be as high as $160
per annum (as it is in Switzerland and
France).
All human beings have the same basic
needs with regard to curing or treating an
ailment, relieving a symptom or acquiring
protection against a disease. However, the
drug needs of populations in different
regions of the world can vary, depending on
the incidence of the prevailing diseases. In
developing countries, for example, more
than 30 per cent of deaths are due to infecÂ¬
tious bacterial and viral diseases and to parÂ¬
asitic diseases (which cause 4 per cent of
deaths in the wealthy countries) and could
be avoided by curative drugs. In the rich
countries, more than 60 per cent of deaths
are due to circulatory, respiratory and neuÂ¬
rological diseases and to malignant tumours
(which cause fewer than 30 per cent of
deaths in the developing world): these
patients need symptomatic treatment and
can in some cases be maintained in a satisÂ¬
factory condition by palliatives.
The number of drugs needed to satisfy all
human needs is very small. The Expert
Committees of the World Health OrganizaÂ¬
tion (WHO), which since 1977 have drawn
up and revised the Model List of Essential
Drugs, ' have had the task of selecting drugs
which are necessary and sufficient to treat
95 per cent of all diseases and of all human
symptoms susceptible to treatment by
drugs. The 1985 edition of the Model List
names 379 products containing 262 active
substances (in varying forms: tablets,
drops, capsules, etc.). If the aim were to
satisfy 99 per cent instead of 95 per cent of
all needs, the figure would probably rise to
350 substances in 500 commercial forms.
Yet the number of drugs on sale in the
highly developed countries nearly everyÂ¬
where exceeds 15,000, containing between
700 and 1,100 active substances.
The difference between the number of
drugs and the number of active substances is
so great because most of the former are
simply different forms or fresh combina-

and then obtained them from apothecaries, the
ancestors of today's pharmacists. Above, detail

Drugs in medicine
Different categories of drugs can be disÂ¬
tinguished according to the purpose for
which they are used:
Curative drugs, capable of completely curing
a disease after administration for a specified
time, are basically substances which are toxic
to invading organisms in the body. These are
the antibacterial, antiprotozoan and antiÂ¬
parasitic drugs.
Palliative drugs normalize body functions
during the course of treatment. This category
includes hormone substitutes as well as antiÂ¬
inflammatory, cardiovascular and psychoÂ¬
tropic drugs.
Symptomatic drugs suppress a symptom
(which can be caused by different diseases).
They include the analgesics, antipyretics,
cough suppressors and drugs for diarrhoea.
Prophylactic drugs are in the main vaccines,
but some antibacterials can also be included
in this category.
Diagnostic drugs, such as those used in
radiology, are only used by the doctor.
Placebos. The placebo effect is the positive
therapeutic effect that some patients derive
from a medicament whose active properties
cannot be shown. Placebos constitute a large
proportion of all drugs bought or consumed.

tions clearly quite superfluous of the
same active ingredients. Between 250 and
1,500 pharmacologically active substances
(depending on the country) are equally
superfluous. These are substances of doubtÂ¬
ful therapeutic value, "me-too" drugs,2 new
active agents which are more expensive and
hence more profitable, traditional drugs (of
national, colonial or folk origin) or mediÂ¬
cines sold to treat non-existent diseases
invented by the advertising departments of
pharmaceutical manufacturers.
The only hope of satisfying the drug
needs of the people of the developing world
is to limit supplies to a restricted list of
essential drugs, which could be based on the
WHO Model List. This step would curb the
present ruinous outlay from the poor counÂ¬
tries and also avoid many errors made by
prescribers and consumers, as well as many
side effects, unforeseen incompatibilities
and cases of drug dependence.
In many developing countries with a free
market economy, the "national" list of
essential drugs is enforced only in the
"public sector", where drugs are bought by

the State to be distributed free of charge or
sold to the public. On the other hand, most
of the medicines available on the European
or American markets are distributed in the
"private sector" of developing countries
where drug manufacturers can sell everyÂ¬
thing that has been registered by trie
authorities and that they can get doctors to
prescribe. Whereas the public sector is supÂ¬
posed to cater for the needs of the overÂ¬
whelming majority, private medicine is usuÂ¬
ally accessible only to the well-to-do
inhabitants of towns and cities, who repreÂ¬
sent between 1 and 7 per cent of the populaÂ¬
tion. As most drugs are imported and forÂ¬
eign currency spending is limited, the
private sector prevents adequate supplies
from reaching the majority of the populaÂ¬
tion. Furthermore, sick people who receive
medical treatment from the public sector
will tend to suspect that their government is
depriving them of "good" medicines! Full
benefit can therefore be derived from a
restrictive list of essential drugs only if such
a list applies to the private sector as well as
to the public sector.
In order to avoid many errors arising
from the plethora of trade names, and to
prevent the manufacturers of a brand of
drugs from making big profits out of it long
after it has ceased to be protected by patent,
it is also necessary to enforce the use of
International Nonproprietary Names
(INN), or the generic names of drugs, for
both prescription and selling purposes. All
that needs to be done is to stipulate that the
generic names of the active ingredients of
the drugs should be printed clearly and legiÂ¬
bly on the package of each product, even if a
brand name is shown as well.
Many governments of developing counÂ¬
tries are endeavouring to set up national
pharmaceutical industries in order to
reduce their dependence on the developed
countries. Most of them realize, however,
that the establishment of a pharmaceutical
industry requires heavy capital investment,
that pharmaceutical plants yield returns
only after a relatively long period and that
ultimately they create very few jobs. None
of the developing countries which have
established pharmaceutical industries (with
the possible exception of Brazil and India)
has become truly independent in this field.
The establishment of a national formulation
and packaging industry merely changes the
type of dependence, so that a country
comes to depend on suppliers of chemical

The World Health Organization has drawn up
guidelines for the quality control of pharÂ¬

quality control is carried out by highly speÂ¬

raw materials, and hence on the chemico-
pharmaceutical industries. In the case of
pharmacologically active substances,
monopolies are often more restrictive than
for ready-to-use drugs.
In order to ensure that the population has
an adequate supply of strictly necessary
essential drugs, the developing countries
will be obliged, for years to come, to import
drugs or raw materials. If they are to avoid
crippling expenditure, these countries must
introduce a list of essential drugs and the
use of International Nonproprietary
Names. They will also have to equip themÂ¬
selves with the means of controlling the
quality of imported drugs and endeavour to
buy them as cheaply as possible by, for
example, issuing international invitations to
tender. Finally, they must educate their
populations to use drugs more rationally,
and ensure that those who issue prescripÂ¬
tions only do so when they are fully
informed.
The pharmaceutical industries of the
industrialized countries would be well
advised, in the medium and long term, to
support programmes of action for the introÂ¬
duction and rational use of essential drugs.
Unfortunately, many of them set a priority
on short-term profits and defend the private
sector and protected brand names. These
industries currently make around 8 or 9 per
cent of their turnover in the developing
world. If the developing countries were to
become fully independent, the chemico-
pharmaceutical industrial complexes would
only lose part of this market because they
would continue to supply a proportion of
the raw materials.
The government of a poor country which
is unable to obtain essential drugs on
reasonable terms will have to seek other
solutions. One of these is recourse to tradiÂ¬
tional drugs which call for no expenditure of
foreign currency. These drugs encompass a
vast range of products or plant extracts
whose therapeutic effects have not, as a
rule, been proved, whose composition varÂ¬
ies from place to place and from year to
year, arid whose undesirable effects are still
unknown. Huge investments of capital and
labour are needed to enable a traditional
drug to become one that is medically useful.
If such a movement were to become
widespread, it could mean the end of pharÂ¬
maceutical trading by industrialized counÂ¬
tries in the developing world. UnforÂ¬
tunately, it could also extinguish the hopes
of the populations of developing countries
of receiving the medical care and drugs they
really need.

### A Grand old age
580 million over 60s by the year 2000
A grand old age by Edit Beregi
THE proportion of elderly people in
the population as a whole is signifiÂ¬
cantly growing. Between 1970 and
the year 2000 the number of over-sixties is
expected to rise worldwide from 307 million
to 580 million. This increase presents physiÂ¬
cians, biologists, psychologists, sociologists
and social workers with new problems.
The prime objective of all gerontological
research is to prolong the individual's active
and productive life. During the last decade
our knowledge of the changes wrought by
the ageing process, as well as of the health
problems, social needs, and medical
requirements of the aged has substantially
increased.
Ageing is a slow physiological process.
Studies have shown that most organs of the
body reach their functional peak between
the ages of twenty and twenty-five years,
thereafter remaining on this plateau for a
considerable time. As the years go by, these
functions decline in varying degrees. It has
also been established that up to the age of
seventy the incidence of these changes varÂ¬
ies widely. Many people will retain their full
capacities even to the age of seventy, theii
organs functioning as soundly as those of
people half their age. In other cases, the
decline in the functional efficiency of an
individual's systems may have become so
marked by the age of seventy as to require
him or her to be taken into care.
Reduced functioning of organs lies at the
root of many of the illnesses of the aged. At
the same time, in assessing the different
functions, it must be remembered that a
person's lifestyle can profoundly affect the
performance of his or her organs. Several
studies have shown that an unsuitable diet,
lack of physical exercise, tobacco smoking
and the consumption of alcohol have an
adverse effect on the functioning of some
organs and contribute to the appearance of
diseases associated with old age.
Industrial and technological progress has
brought many benefits but also harmful
effects such as an increase in diseases such
as hypertension and arteriosclerosis, higher
levels of physical and psychological stress
and a greater incidence of disorders of the

### A Grand old age
nervous system. Rapid urbanization has led
to environmental pollution, which in its
turn has brought about an increase in the
number of pulmonary complaints. Thus,
over the last few decades, the type of disÂ¬
eases prevalent among the old has changed.
Whereas at the turn of the century infecÂ¬
tious diseases headed the list, nowadays
chronic conditions have become the chief
problem.
We still do not know how the state of
health and lifestyle of the elderly will
develop in the course of an extended lifeÂ¬
span. Different authors have different
views on the subject. According to some,
people will enjoy good health to the age of
eighty-five, after which the organism is
likely to deteriorate rapidly. In this view,
death will occur from biological ageing
rather than from chronic disease. By con
trast, others foresee a protracted loss of
functions and increasing incapacity, leading
to a marked rise in the number of the chronÂ¬
ically sick. They deem it essential therefore
for medical science to address the problem
of how to improve the last period of life. Yet
others hold that a longer healthy lifespan
can be expected with an extension of the
middle "second age". Studies also find that
seventy-five-year-olds today are healthier
than were their counterparts ten years ago.
This change is the result of preventive meaÂ¬
sures against the usual ailments of the
elderly.
Recent results of research and techÂ¬
nological progress have drawn attention to
many opportunities and tasks involved in
efforts to improve the quality of life of the
elderly.
Pride of place must go to the need for a
change in lifestyle. Adoption of a correct
lifestyle must come, however, at an early
age, for, apart from hereditary factors, the
health of the elderly is largely determined
by their mode of life in younger years. An
incorrect lifestyle can give rise to illness
even in a person's youth, which will then be
carried over into old age.
Modern technology can assist in the early
diagnosis of some diseases and help to
ensure that treatment of a chronic condition
begins in good time. Many diseases can now
be successfully treated in their initial stages,
thereby avoiding subsequent complicaÂ¬
tions. The success of early treatment is
proven by the fact that where screening for
and early treatment of hypertension has
been introduced, the incidence of stroke
and myocardial infarction has significantly
decreased.

### A Grand old age
An 80-year-old Hungarian athlete gives an
impressive demonstration of gymnastics to a
youthful audience.
New ways must be sought of promoting
mental health, and new aids must be
developed to improve mobility and the
functioning of the sense organs in the
elderly. Active life is often impeded in old
age by diseases of the joints, by impaired
hearing and poor eyesight. Provision must
also be made for organ transplantation in
the elderly.
Another crucial task is to find ways of
influencing the changes which accompany
the biological ageing process and of counÂ¬
teracting its effects. Attempts have already
been made to inhibit these changes or to
retard their appearance, but as yet, no defiÂ¬
nite conclusions applicable to human beings
can be made. It remains for future studies to
determine how the results of basic research
might be applied in practice.
In the light of our present knowledge,
preventive care is the only way in which we
can retard biological ageing and the inciÂ¬
dence of the ailments associated with
advanced age, while at the same time ensurÂ¬
ing active and productive old age. The folÂ¬
lowing preventive steps are feasible:
* Early diagnosis of the diseases likely to
occur in the elderly and their timely treatÂ¬
ment. This will ensure that those approachÂ¬
ing old age will do so in good physical and
mental health. Early diagnosis is facilitated
by a number of screening techniques, which
makes them valuable aids in geriatric
medicine.
* Another useful aid in preventive care is
preparation for retirement with a view to
safeguarding the individual's physical and
mental well-being and minimizing the
psychological stress of retirement. Such
preparation should begin around the age of
50 since at that age the personality has not
yet become too rigid.
* The third preventive step is based on
awareness of the importance of a healthy
lifestyle, of a correct diet, of the need for
physical exercise , and the adoption of a senÂ¬
sible life routine in keeping with the state of
retirement. Attention must be paid to the
right amount and right kind of rest to be
incorporated in the day's activities. At the
same time, the importance of the preservaÂ¬
tion of an active mental life through stimuÂ¬
lating pastimes must be kept in mind. GuidÂ¬
ance should be given about relieving elderly
people of physical burdens, while fully preÂ¬
serving those activities which do not impose
a strain on them.
* A novel idea in preventive geriatric mediÂ¬
cine is that of the University of the Third
Age which can make a valuable contribuÂ¬
tion to the promotion of an active life, the
maintenance of alertness and the provision
of useful leisure activities among the
elderly.
Further advances in science and technolÂ¬
ogy, as well as conscious preparation for old
age, give grounds for hope that by the turn
of the millennium the large percentage of
old people in the population will be able to
lead a healthy and active life, their main
concern being how to make the best use of
their new-found years of freedom.

### Tomorrow's medicine

B <%&
In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning,
one of the most refined techniques of medical
investigation, the patient is placed in a powerful
magnetic field that has a profound effect on the
protons (nuclei of hydrogen atoms) in the body.
These protons normally point in random direcÂ¬
tions, but inside the scanner's magnetic field
they align themselves in the direction of the
field's poles. When the scanner excites them
with a radio pulse, it knocks them out of alignÂ¬
ment. Within milliseconds they spiral back into
place, emitting a "signal" which varies accordÂ¬
ing to the composition ol the tissues under
observation. A computer translates the signal
into an image on a video screen. NMR gives an
extremely precise anatomical picture, as in the
high definition image of the brain, above.
IN his laboratory at the HÃ´tel Dieu, a
leading Montreal hospital, a young
Canadian cancer specialist is experiÂ¬
menting with a technique which may be in
everyday use before the year 2000: the locaÂ¬
tion, on a video screen, of the metastases
(secondary or mini-tumours) of a patient
suffering from breast cancer.
The technique owes as much to biology as
it does to video equipment and informatics,
since it uses antibodies specially designed to
identify cancerous cells in a very specific
manner. These "monoclonal" antibodies,
as they are called, are "tagged" with a
radioactive substance. Injected into the
patient, they home in and lock on to the
metastases, however small they may be,
which can then be pin-pointed with the aid
of a special, radioactivity-sensitive camera.
"It is our hope," the Canadian doctor
explains, "that with the help of this techÂ¬
nique we will one day be able to detect
metastases wherever they may be within the
body. Our dream is that we will then be able
to attach a few molecules of an appropriate
medicament to these monoclonal antiÂ¬
bodies which will deposit them directly at
the site of the tumour ..."
In a laboratory at Mama YÃ©mo Hospital,
8,000 kilometres away in Kinshasa, a team
of doctors and researchers working on the
Zaire AIDS Research Project (Projet
SIDA) have taken up another challenge:
they are attempting to perfect a cheap but
reliable test to detect the presence of AIDS
virus antibodies.
The test currently in use costs a minimum
of $3 a time, a "luxury" which no poor
country can afford for a comprehensive
screening programme. The researchers in
Zaire are seeking to develop a test which
would be one hundred times cheaper. This
would make it possible to test all blood
received from blood-donors and thus
ensure the safety of the blood transfusion
service, an essential weapon in the medical

Africa.
Montreal and Kinshasa. Two snapshots
of the medicine of today and two facets of
the medicine of tomorrow one sophistiÂ¬
cated, at the leading edge of progress; the
other, equally fascinating, the medicine of
daily life. Two worlds with but a single purÂ¬
pose to help the sick to the best of the
capabilities of science and technology ...
subject to the constraints of time and place.
Molecular medicine
The monoclonal antibodies of Montreal
and the AIDS virus test of Kinshasa are but
two of the amazing possibilities within the
range of modern medicine. From the 1950s
on, following breakthroughs in biology and
molecular genetics, researchers have conÂ¬
centrated on unravelling the mysteries of
the functioning of the human organism in
ever more minute detail.
From observation of a particular organ
and its function, they have gone on to seek
to understand its internal mechanisms.
They have penetrated deep into the heart of
the cell, analysing the subtle chemistry of
life and decoding the score that governs the
fabulous orchestration of the genes. In so
doing they have discovered dozens of genes
that control the manufacture of the horÂ¬
mones, peptides and proteins that are
essential to the proper functioning of the
human organism . . . and at times are responÂ¬
sible for its malfunctioning. They have
found out how a molecule enters a cell to
feed it , to deliver a message , or to destroy it .
And since the genetic code is universal, as
applicable to a bacterium as to an elephant,
they have also uncovered the secrets of
multitudes of microbes, viruses and other
parasites.
The biology of today will be an important
constituent of the medical science of tomorÂ¬
row. Progress in one leads to advances in
the other. A few years ago, for example,
Canadian researchers discovered a horÂ¬
mone secreted by the heart which plays an
important role in the control of blood presÂ¬
sure. Since then, teams of Japanese, AmerÂ¬
ican, Canadian and European researchers
have been battling fiercely to find applicaÂ¬
tions for this discovery, since the heart horÂ¬
mone, it would seem, may well turn out to
be the model on which all future treatment
of hypertension will be based.
Progress in molecular medicine, as scienÂ¬
tists like to call it, is beginning to make its
influence felt in the field of hereditary
health problems. In some cases, pre-natal
diagnosis can detect an anomaly in the
foetus which would indicate the advisability
of therapeutic abortion. In other cases,
early diagnosis of a problem makes it possiÂ¬
ble, a few days after a birth, to start treat
ment which would be too late if it were left
until symptoms appeared. Finally, a great
leap forward has been achieved with the
arrival of "molecular probes", which will
become widely available during the coming
decade. Using these probes it is now possiÂ¬
ble to detect the presence of defective genes
in parents who, unknown to themselves, are
carriers of the defect. Applied where there
is an exceptionally high risk of hereditary
problems, such probe tests will enable
improved genetic counselling to be given.
This is not all. Genetic medicine has
applications beyond the field of hereditary
illness in the conventional meaning of the
term. The gene involved in cancer of the
retina has recently been identified and
genes thought to be implicated in
Alzheimer's disease and depression have
also been discovered. Many research workÂ¬
ers believe that, in the not too distant
future, the genes involved in such common
illnesses as atherosclerosis, diabetes, some
cancers and certain neurological problems
may also be found.
One day, perhaps, we shall learn how to
heal or replace defective genes. What is
envisaged in the more immediate future is
the emergence of a form of predictive, indiÂ¬
vidualized medicine which will make it posÂ¬
sible to adapt general health advice to meet
the specific needs of each individual , having
regard to his or her susceptibility to, for
example, lung cancer, heart attack, obesity
or depression a kind of preventive mediÂ¬
cine Ã  la carte.
Mapping the human brain
The next decade will witness a surge of
research interest in the brain, which has
already displaced the gene as the new fronÂ¬
tier of medical science. The stock of scienÂ¬
tists with specialist knowledge of the noble
organ is rising on the world "grey matter"
market. Founded in 1971 by 500 North
American researchers, the Society for NeuÂ¬
rosciences now has 10,000 members.
Another sign of the times is that the greatest
research institutions in the United States,
from New York to San Diego, have recently
established centres specializing in brain
research, endowed, moreover, with considÂ¬
erable resources.
The boom in neuroscience is neither forÂ¬
tuitous nor the expression of a sudden fad.
For several years now researchers in this
field have achieved prodigies of pioneering
work. They have discovered the functions
of the different regions of the brain,
described the complex tangle of the neurons
and observed anomalous conditions so as to
learn more about the normal functioning of
the most inaccessible of human organs.
They have discovered substances that regulÂ¬
ate the waking and the sleeping states, manÂ¬
age the emotions, control pain, govern sex
ual desire or the will to power, and cause
anomalies of behaviour, temperament and
memory.
Acquiring mastery of the amazing chemÂ¬
istry of the brain has been, and will continue
even more intensely to be, the priority
objective of the neurosciences. One examÂ¬
ple, by no means the most recent, was the
discovery that Parkinson's disease was due
to a lack of one of these chemical subÂ¬
stances, dopamine. Later it was found that
the condition of sufferers could be alleviÂ¬
ated by the administration of L-dopa (a subÂ¬
stitute for dopamine which has the capacity
to penetrate the barrier which envelops and
carefully guards the brain).
The brain is an electronic as well as a
chemical machine, a super-computer whose
circuitry we are now able to study. A
researcher in Denmark is studying the cereÂ¬
bral activity of individuals undertaking
mental operations. Using apparatus that
can detect the consumption of oxygen
within his subject's brain, he can have the
curious experience of "seeing a brain think"
on a video screen (see back cover).
We are still very far from having peneÂ¬
trated all the secrets of the brain. But things
are already happening. In Sweden, a few
years ago, and more recently in Mexico,
surgeons attempted to restore full function
to the brains of sufferers from Parkinson's
disease. They took cells that produce
dopamine from glands situated in the kidÂ¬
neys of their patients and transplanted them
into their brains. While the results achieved
in Sweden were disappointing, those
obtained in Mexico were very positive. It is
said that the brain, with all its dizzying comÂ¬
plexity, will never be able fully to compreÂ¬
hend itself. It will soon, however, be able to
"repair" itself.
"Pseudo-hormones" and high-tech vaccines
Two other branches of biology, endocrinolÂ¬
ogy (the science of hormones) and immuÂ¬
nology (the science of the immune system),
are experiencing an unprecedented boom.
Stimulated by genetic techniques, aided by
new instruments for the exploration of the
infinitely small, and with the backing of the
pharmaceutical industry which has recogÂ¬
nized their enormous potential, they are
beginning to "deliver the goods".
In universities and private laboratories,
thousands of men and women in white coats
are concocting a profusion of products with
exotic names prostaglandins, neuropepÂ¬
tides, immuno-regulators, anti-carÂ¬
cinogens, monoclonal antibodies. ... Some
of the products, such as interleucines
(regulators of the immune system) and,
above all, interferon, have achieved star
status before even having become mediÂ¬
cines in the strict sense of the word. Sooner
or later, several of these products will be |>

### The Challenge of AIDS
### Tomorrow's medicine
The challenge
of AIDS
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) and all the diseases associated with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infecÂ¬
tion have in the space of a few years become a
matter of great concern to the international
community. The disease has taken on panÂ¬
demic proportions, creating a worldwide
emergency of which public health officials,
doctors, politicians and the public at large
must be made aware.
AIDS was recognized for the first time in
1981. Since then the number of cases has
increased considerably. By the end of June
1987 over 52,600 AIDS cases had been
reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO) by 1 1 8 countries. However, according
to WHO estimates, the number of cases is
higher than 100,000, and worldwide between
5 and 1 0 million persons may now be carriers
of the HIV virus.
"AIDS robs societies mainly of 20 to 49
year-olds, men and women in their most proÂ¬
ductive years. This has potential for economic
and political destabilization in the severely
affected parts of the developing world,"
according to Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of
the WHO Special Programme on AIDS. "To
the loss of human potential must be added the
extraordinary financial burden of an incurable
disease. A problem of this magnitude
demands a global response, in which WHO
has a constitutional responsibility to direct and
co-ordinate the struggle against AIDS."
National AIDS Committees have already
been established in more than 100 countries.
Between January and May 1987, WHO supÂ¬
ported 40 countries, including 25 African
countries, in the development of prevention
and control programmes. By the end of the
year, the WHO Special Programme on AIDS
will be supporting 40 sub-Saharan and a furÂ¬
ther 30 countries in Asia and the Americas.
International collaboration organized by
WHO includes the establishment of banks for
viruses and sera, studies of the epidemiology
of the disease and the different criteria logisÂ¬
tic, technical, economic, social and ethical
which screening programmes must satisfy. A
world summit of health ministers will be held
under WHO auspices in London in January
1 988, as a follow-up to two regional ministerial
meetings in Australia (July) and in the AmerÂ¬
icas (September). Finally, given that
"AIDS thrives not only in the body, but on
human ignorance, fear and resistance to
change", WHO launched a global public infor
mation campaign on 27 May 1 987, with the
message: "AIDS. A worldwide effort will stop
it." This theme and the symbol that illustrates
it (two red hearts that converge in a blue fright
mask) were chosen, said Dr. Mann, to "simulÂ¬
taneously communicate the severity of the
AIDS threat and that a global strategy can
control it". This strategy "is to stop the spread
of AIDS worldwide by striking every way the
virus spreads, in every country, using every
scientific and educational tool available".
Unesco has always actively encouraged
"preventive education" and in this field has
developed programmes designed to elimiÂ¬
nate prejudice and intolerance, to prevent or
contain environmental deterioration, to preÂ¬
vent unplanned fertility, and to combat drug
abuse. A number of these activities have been
carried out in close co-operation with other
United Nations agencies. Unesco is thus well
placed to support WHO'S strategy for AIDS
prevention and control and to mobilize educaÂ¬
tional authorities and teaching personnel.
In December 1986, Unesco was invited by
the International Conference on Education to
prepare "as a matter of urgency and in
co-ordination with other competent bodies in
the United Nations system, a draft emergency
programme of education and information in
schools for AIDS prevention". Accordingly, a
meeting of experts was held at Unesco HeadÂ¬
quarters in Paris from 29 June to 1 July 1 987,
in order to work out the details of a joint
Unesco/WHO plan of action, which will be
submitted to Unesco's General Conference in
October 1987.
? reinforcing the armoury of hospital mediÂ¬
cines and may even be available at the local
pharmacy.
Prostaglandins, for example, are
"pseudo-hormones" derived from fatty
acids. They are to be found almost everyÂ¬
where in the body. They constitute an
already large family including, for examÂ¬
ple, leucotrienes, thromboxane and pros-
tacycline some members of which may
soon become as well known as aspirin.
Their role as medicines is seen as being in
the prevention of heart attacks and the forÂ¬
mation of ulcers, and in the treatment of
inflammation and of asthma.
Interferon, interleucines, prostaglanÂ¬
dins, hormones of the brain and of the heart
are all natural substances that can now be
synthesized in large quantities after gene
cloning. They can even be produced by bacÂ¬
teria that have been genetically re-proÂ¬
grammed. Insulin, interferon and the
growth hormone are already produced
commercially in this way.
The good old vaccines of long standing
will also benefit from the latest genetic techÂ¬
niques. Once its structure is known, an antiÂ¬
gen (the part of a microbe that stimulates
the formation of antibodies) can be proÂ¬
duced artificially by chemical synthesis or
by re-programmed bacteria. Some vacÂ¬
cines, which are manufactured in a rather
crude, empirical fashion, will soon be pro
duced using the most modern techniques,
just as will new vaccines. American
researchers are relying on genetic engineerÂ¬
ing to provide a vaccine against malaria
which they see as the next important breakÂ¬
through in preventive medicine the next,
that is, unless the eagerly awaited vaccine
against AIDS overtakes it to become the
very first great high-technology vaccine in
medical history.
A revolution in medical imaging
The medical science of tomorrow will not,
however, stem solely from biology. ElecÂ¬
tronics, informatics, the science of mateÂ¬
rials and nuclear physics will also have a
large part to play.
Lasers are already making their contribuÂ¬
tion to delicate surgical procedures such as
eye operations, and tomorrow a laser
attached to the end of a flexible wire will be
used to unblock clogged arteries.
Computers, with their artificial intelÂ¬
ligence, are helping doctors to make their
diagnoses and chemists to design molecules
to achieve specific pharmacological effects.
Used in conjunction with video cameras,
axial tomography, magnetic nuclear resoÂ¬
nance and echography, they are making
their contribution to the revolution in mediÂ¬
cal imaging which is making it feasible for

ive" techniques are destined to have
a major effect on medical practice in coming
years, particularly in the field of
diagnosis.
When it is too late to prevent or to heal,
then it is a matter of replacing the affected
part. Already artificial hearts are plugged
in, admittedly without great success. Tiny
miracles of electronic wizardry are
implanted in the inner ear to make the deaf
hear. Knees, ankles, fingers and skull-cases
are rebuilt. Artificial skin and blood,
hydraulically operated walking machines,
motorized arms which respond to the
wearer's nerve impulses, electronic hands
covered with sensitive artificial skin, all
these are already on the test-bench. TomorÂ¬
row, this "spare-part surgery" will be able
to offer artificial replacement muscles,
larynxes, sphincters, nerves, pancreas and
intestines at least to those who can afford
them.

grafting made commonplace, more effecÂ¬
tive artificial organs, all these will be the
stuff of the medical science of tomorrow.
We must not, however, aliow ourselves
to be dazzled by the promise of advanced
technology. Even more than today, mediÂ¬
cal science will have to come to terms with
a new phenomenon the intervention of
ethical considerations. New techniques to
assist human reproduction have already
aroused passionate debate and will confront
society with difficult choices. Science alone
cannot answer the questions raised about
the new techniques for prolonging life and
the counter problem of the right to a digniÂ¬
fied death. The field of action of genetic
engineering will have to be clearly marked
out if we are to avoid , for example , the false
trails of eugenics. The immense cost of such
innovations as the artificial heart will also
pose delicate problems of social justice and
the allocation of medical resources, not
only in those countries where experiments
in this field are being carried out, but
throughout the world.
It is not enough for the medical science of
the future to be merely futurist. It must also
always be concerned with education, preÂ¬
vention, hygiene, the cleansing of the
environment, proper supply of drinking
water and food, adequate housing, the
immunization and schooling of children.
On both sides of the North/South divide,
the primary concern of medical science will
always remain those tasks which, because
they are not spectacular, we tend to think
of as simple or humdrum and yet which
are more difficult by far to carry out than
the cloning of a gene or transplanting of a
heart.
YAN1CK VILLEDIEU, Canadian scientific jourÂ¬
nalist and broadcaster, has written many articles
and reports on different subjects, notably mediÂ¬
cine and health. He has also been involved in
professional and academic meetings and semiÂ¬
nars in the field of public health and medicine.
Among his published works are Demain la santÃ©
(1976; "Health Tomorrow").
It has recently been discovered that the heart is
more than a pump: it is also an endocrine gland
that secretes a hormone which regulates blood
pressure and blood volume. Synthesis of this
hormone, which in the body is stored in granules
around the nuclei of cardiocytes (heart-muscle
cells), could lead to new treatments for hyperÂ¬
tension and other blood-pressure diseases.

There is continual feedback between the cells of
the nervous system (above right, neurons) and
those of the immunological system (below

interactions have been extensively studied by
molecular biology, a field in which Unesco has
for many years encouraged international
co-operation. The International Brain Research
Organization (IBRO), which promotes neuro-
scientific research, was founded under Unesco
auspices in 1960, and in 1962 Unesco was
instrumental in founding the International Cell

Automation and microsurgery
THERE are almost 30 million blind peoÂ¬
ple in the world and nearly 1 ,000 milÂ¬
lion others who have to wear spectaÂ¬
cles. The revolution now under way in the
treatment of such common eye diseases as
cataract, myopia, hyperopia and glaucoma is
associated with achievements in eye microÂ¬
surgery.
The first implantation of an artificial lens in
the eye took place in the late 1 940s, but unforÂ¬
tunately, early implantation attempts proved a
failure, with the result that the technique came
to be regarded as scientifically unsound.
However, research in this direction continued
in the USSR and the technique was not only
"rehabilitated" and perfected, but also came
to be used on a mass scale.
Artificial lens implantation is now one of the
most widespread surgical operations in the
world. There are numerous kinds of artificial
lenses, of which a posterior-chamber lens
implanted In a very narrow space between the
iris and the capsule of the removed lens, has
proved to be most effective. Various models of
this kind of lens have been developed since
1975. The most popular is the posterior-
chamber lens which is fixed directly within the
capsule of the natural lens. As the artificial
lens does not come into contact with any
structure inside the eye, such as the iris, the
patient recovers more quickly. Nearly two milÂ¬
lion posterior-chamber lenses have already
been implanted throughout the world.
However, we are not yet satisfied with the
existing models, of intraocular lenses.
Research is going on to make the artificial lens
lighter and more pliable, and to ensure a perÂ¬
fectly smooth surface. Until recently all lenses
were made of acrylic plastic, the physical and
chemical properties of which did not allow the

production of a light, pliable yet durable artifiÂ¬
cial lens. Then silicones (biologically inert
polymers) were discovered. They meet all the
necessary requirements, since they are elasÂ¬
tic, have a high chemjcal and heat resistance,
and are already widely used in medicine, parÂ¬
ticularly in haematology and cosmetic surÂ¬
gery. The major advantage of a silicone lens is
that patients are no longer faced with postÂ¬
operative complications which can follow the
implantation of a hard acrylic plastic lens.
It is now possible to envisage intraocular
lenses made of liquid silicone, which could be
injected into the lens capsule and polymerized
there without losing their elasticity.
The next step in the intraocular correction of
vision may be an artificial lens equipped with a
solar battery which will provide it with refracÂ¬
tive power, i.e. the ability to accommodate or
adjust its thickness for far or near vision. A
person with such a controllable lens will not
have to wear spectacles at all, whereas today
people with artificial lenses still have to wear
them while working or reading.
Myopia, or nearsightedness, affects some
800 million people. A technique for surgical
correction of myopia has been developed in
the Scientific Research Institute of Eye MicroÂ¬
surgery in Moscow. It consists of cutting a
collagen molecule, which causes it to
regenerate itself, i.e. produce a new molecule

to replace the destroyed one, thus changing
the elastic properties of the cornea. Under
intraocular pressure, the portion of the cornea
at the site of the cut becomes convex and the
central part flattens. As a result, the image is
properly focused on the retina. Using this
method, we correct myopia of -1 to -14
dioptres.1 Twenty-five thousand such operaÂ¬
tions have been performed at our Institute,
and nearly 300,000 throughout the world.
Molecular surgery opens up unprecedented
opportunities for the treatment of other organs
as well.
For several years we have also been sucÂ¬
cessfully treating hyperopia, or farsightedÂ¬
ness, with surgical techniques. Today, we are
able to correct the vision of those wearing-
spectacles of +1 to +8 dioptres.
Contemporary medicine has a great need
for more reliable and efficient methods of
treatment, including the establishment of
large "health factories" specializing in therapy
of major diseases. The introduction of the
industrial principle into health care involves
the division of the process into stages, each of
which is the responsibility of a specialist. This
principle is applied at the Institute, where the
work is distributed among surgical teams in an
operating theatre which we call the "autoÂ¬
mated sight-recovery line" or "clear sight conÂ¬
veyor". As each surgeon finishes part of the
operation, a signal is given and the operating
table smoothly moves to the next surgeon.
It may seem rather inhuman to move a
patient like a component along an assembly
line, but each operation is carried out accordÂ¬
ing to an individual plan prepared after a preÂ¬
liminary check-up. A computer designates the
optimum surgical procedure, predicts the
result of the operation and determines to what
extent the eyesight of each patient can be
improved.
The same surgical team carries out the preÂ¬
liminary check-up, performs the operation and
provides post-operative treatment. Television

monitors transmit each stage of the operation
in colour, which is particularly important for
ophthalmic surgeons. A video camera
attached to the surgical microscope films
everything the surgeon sees and automatÂ¬
ically records the operation.
The number of operative and post-operaÂ¬
tive complications has decreased nearly tenÂ¬
fold using this automated approach, while
each surgeon's productivity has increased
five-fold. Furthermore, the industrial principle,
while ensuring the excellent quality of surgery,
is very economical. Thus resources can be
used to improve the facilities of the complex
and to increase the number of patients
treated.
Future developments in the industrializaÂ¬
tion of medicine include a project for a new
out-patient clinic equipped with a diagnostic
conveyor which would provide maximum
comfort while reducing the time of examinaÂ¬
tion from two days to two hours. A robot which
would be able to treat myopia better than a
surgeon is also at the design stage. But can
the human eye be entrusted to an "uninÂ¬
telligent" robot? Yes, because the freedom of
movement of the human hand is approxÂ¬
imately 1 2Â°, an "excessive" freedom which is
conducive to error. But a robot possessing
only 2Â° or 3Â° of freedom of movement can be
programmed to exercise a predetermined
pressure on the eye and will be able to move
its hand only within accurately verified limits.
Continuous feedback is also possible during
the operation to exclude any unexpected
complications during surgery, for example,
the robot could transmit information on the
thickness of the cornea.
SVYATOSLAV FEDOROV, the founder of
Soviet eye microsurgery research, is Director
General of the Scientific Research Institute of
Eye Microsurgery in Moscow. A corresponding
member of the USSR Academy of Medical SciÂ¬
ences, he is the author ofmore than 300 publicaÂ¬
tions, including "Artificial Lens Implantation"
(1977), and the co-author, with E. Yegorova, of
"Surgical Treatment of Traumatic Cataract"
(1983).

computerized imaging lecnniques are loaay
being widely used in clinical diagnosis and
medical research. Spectacular results,
notably in the study of the brain, have been
produced by introducing radioactive
substances into the body and using radiation
detectors to record their behaviour. By
revealing changes in the pattern of cerebral
blood flow, this technique makes it possible to
watch the brain at work. Images in photo 1
show part of the brain of a person at rest
(above) and reading silently (below). In
photo 2 the subject is resting with eyes closed
(above) and reading aloud (below). Photo 3
shows the brain of an epileptic person during
a seizure (below) and in a seizure-free period
(above).
