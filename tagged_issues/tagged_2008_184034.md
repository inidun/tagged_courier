### Editorial
To mark the recent reinstallation 
of the Aksum Obelisk in its origi-
nal location in northern Ethiopia, the 
UNESCO Courier revisits some of the 
country’s cultural sites. Our travels 
off the beaten path lead us to ano-
ther treasure less obvious, less monu-
mental than the castles of Gondar, 
less visible than the rock-hewn chur-
ches of Lalibela, but just as impres-
sive: Ethiopia’s intangible heritage.
“Tangible cultural heritage can be a 
genuine instrument of reconciliation,” 
declared UNESCO’s Assistant Director-
General for Culture, Françoise Rivière, 
last 4 September, during the inaugu-
ration ceremony of the Aksum Obelisk 
on its original site. The 17 centuries 
old stele, taken to Rome in 1937 by 
Mussolini’s troops and brought back 
to Ethiopia by the Italian government 
is proof of this. Standing 24 metres 
high and weighing 150 tons, it is the 
second largest stele on the Aksum 
World Heritage site, close to the 
border with Eritrea. 
“This is a global first,” said Francesco 
Bandarin, Director of UNESCO’s World 
Heritage Centre. “The reinstallation 
of Stele No. 2, in the framework of 
the 1972 Convention concerning the 
safeguarding of natural and cultural 
world heritage, opens a new chapter 
in history,” he added. “It is a chapter 
that concerns not just Ethiopia but 
all of humanity.” 
“In a certain way, this obelisk is a 
symbol for all of Africa,” said the 
Ethiopian Minister of Culture and 
Tourism, Mohammed Dirir, in the 
interview he gave the UNESCO Courier 
last May. He explained that by trans-
porting the obelisk to Rome, Mussolini 
was taking revenge for the defeat of 
the Italian colonial troops in Adua 
(1896) in northern Ethiopia. “But we 
won’t live in the past,” he main-
tained. “It is the future we must look 
to. We will not forget, but we have 
forgiven.” 
For the last two years, culture and 
tourism have worked hand in hand in 
Ethiopia. Dirir is convinced that his 
country, with its “millennia of his-
tory”, must take advantage of its cul-
ture “to develop responsible tourism”. 
When he states that cultural heritage 
forges the country’s international 
image, he is not thinking only of mon-
uments. He is referring to customs, 
like the coffee ceremony, and to hand-
icraf ts, the livelihood of many 
Ethiopians, particularly women and 
young people. He stresses too the 
notion of “shimgalina”, meaning both 
dialogue and wisdom, as well as 
Ethiopian hospitality and its spirit of 
tolerance.
Showcase projects
True, tangible and intangible herit-
age are inseparable, particularly in 
his country. This is one reason why 
Rivière decided to launch another 
“worksite”, specifically in Lalibela, 
the Ethiopian World Heritage site 
renowned for its monolithic churches 
carved in to the rock. 
“The idea is to carry out projects inte-
grated in world heritage sites,” she 
explains. “These ‘projects’ are 
intended to contribute to economic 
and human development by focusing, 
according to need, on cultural tour-
ism, safeguarding intangible heritage, 
promoting cultural diversity, dialogue, 
languages or cultural industries. We 
will identify one site per region to 
launch these projects. In Africa, it 
will be Lalibela, where UNESCO has 
been present for a long time.” 
The foundations for the new initiative 
are already there: the Organization 
has several conventions at its dis-
posal, including those concerning 
natural and cultural heritage (1972), 
intangible cultural heritage (2003) 
and the diversity of cultural expres-
sions (2005). “By operating in symbi-
osis, these instruments can transform 
culture into a powerful agent for 
development,” says Rivière.  

### Silent giants

Slight , graceful and silent, Aksum 
is like an aristocrat who has come 
down in the world. Pillage, vanda-
lism, arson have dr iven her to 
conceal her remaining treasures in 
different crannies of an old cup-
board. Only the main stelae park 
reigns over the middle of the town, 
testifying to the extent of Aksum’s 
suffering. 
Except for one obelisk tilted like the 
leaning tower of Pisa, none of these 
monoliths with their carved symbols 
remained upright through the ages. 
Even the famous obelisk just rein-
stalled in Aksum after forced exile in 
Italy since 1937 was lying broken in 
five pieces when Mussolini’s troops 
found it (See “The Return of the 
Aksum Obelisk”). But as for most of 
the uncarved stelae, they are still 
sticking straight up towards the sky. 
“That’s why people think the sculpted 
obelisks didn’t fall down by them-
selves, but were toppled by a Jewish 
queen,” says the young historian 
Redae Tesfay. “But in fact for an obe-
lisk to last through time, the portion 
buried underground has to amount to 
10% of its total size. And this rule 
was not respected.” A miscalcula-
SilEnt giantS
Three parks planted with giant stelae, a 
labyrinth of royal tombs, vestiges of the 
Queen of Sheba’s palace, an “Ethiopian 
Rosetta Stone”, the Ark of the Covenant 
containing the ten commandments… an 
incredible treasure, poised between myth 
and history, is hidden in Aksum, where 
the heart of ancient Ethiopia still beats.

tion? Incredible, for people who 
showed such prowess, but apparently 
so. 
As for legend, a queen called Gudit 
(the monstrous) or Esato (the fiery 
one), a historical character from the 
10th century about whom we do not 
know much, is said to have invaded 
Ethiopia in search of the Ark of the 
Covenant, the sacred chest contain-
ing the two tablets inscribed with 
the ten commandments. Furious at 
not finding it, the queen destroyed 
the whole town and put an end to 
the Aksumite kingdom. In memory of 
this unfortunate event, women are 
not allowed into the Maryan Tsyon 
Basilica, which supposedly still 
houses the famous Ark.
The Queen of Sheba, 
mysterious as ever
How did the Ark of the Covenant end 
up in Aksum? Well, it was brought 
from Jerusalem by Menelik, first king 
of Ethiopia, son of a king of Israel 
and Queen Makeda. Some say he was 
the born to King Solomon and the 
Queen of Sheba. About 30 centuries 
ago he founded the Solomonic 
dynasty, of which the last Ethiopian 
Emperor, Haile Selassie, (1892-1974) 
claimed to descend. 
“According to tradition, Menelik hid 
the Ark of the Covenant in his moth-
er’s palace, which is about three kil-
ometers from the centre of Aksum. 
This hiding place was recently dis-
covered by the archeologist Helmut 
Ziegert, from the archeological insti-
tute of the University of Hamburg,” 
explains Fisseha Zibelo, the manager 
of the site of Aksum. The news did 
indeed make headlines last May. 
“The Dongour Palace that you see 
was excavated by the French arche-
ologist Francis Anfray and rebuilt 
between 1966 and 1968. It has 50 
rooms; we don’t know   … Tomb with the false door, Aksum.

which showed they were used for 
local commerce.” Ge’ez, now a liturgi-
cal language, is the ancestor of the 
Amharic language spoken today by 
the majority of Ethiopians. 
Most eloquent of all is certainly the 
local “Rosetta stone,” standing today 
in a small specially designed build-
ing, at the edge of a steep and wind-
ing trail at a distance from central 
Aksum. Found by shepherds in 1982, 
it tells the story in three languages 
– Greek, Ge’ez and Sabean – of the 
Nubian campaign undertaken by 
Ezana, the last pagan ruler and first 
Christian king of Aksum. Converted 
around the mid-4th century, he 
brought the Kingdom to its peak. 
Human interest note: the Ge’ez text 
is engraved on one of the narrow 
faces of this rectangular slab (the 
other was left blank) and the scribe, 
running out of space, continued writ-
ing on the Sabean side, like a school-
boy finishing his sentence in the 
margin when he gets to the bottom 
of the page. 
And thus, from one monument to the 
next, ancient Aksum divulges chap-
ter after chapter of its past, a tapes-
try of legends and history.  
Archeologists found a magnificent 
necropolis under the stelae, but they 
arrived after the looters. The tomb 
with the false door, the tomb with 
the brick arches and the mausoleum, 
majestic and empty, remain mute 
(see box, “The three tombs”). 
Even more enigmatic are the designs 
engraved on the obelisks. Unique in 
the world, these replicas of houses 
with several stories – with door, win-
dows and beams – contain no inscrip-
tions to help scientists penetrate 
their mystery. When not marked with 
a cross, they are capped by a symbol 
representing the sun and the moon. 
According to some historians, this 
pre-Christian symbol could refer to 
the local deity Mahrem, correspond-
ing to Aries the Greek god of war, 
but nothing more is known. 
The old coins are more loquacious. 
They reveal about 20 kings, show the 
different phases of Aksum’s economic 
development and situate in time the 
town’s conversion to Christianity. 
“The gold pieces are marked with 
Greek inscriptions because they were 
used for internat ional trade,” 
recounts Redae, “while the words on 
silver and bronze coins are in Ge’ez, 
… exactly what they were used 
for. It dates back to the 7th century 
but people have always called it ‘the 
Queen of Sheba’s palace’,” Zibelo con-
tinues. “That’s what inspired Helmut 
Ziegert to do more digging, and he 
discovered another palace below the 
one we knew.” Three sections of this 
ancient palace, thought to date back 
to the 10th century B.C., can now be 
v iewed by the public. To the 
untrained eye, the dif ference 
between the ruins from the two 
 periods is imperceptible. 
A small road leading to Gondar (see 
the article “The country of the king 
with the protruding tongue”) sepa-
rates the Dongour palace from one of 
the three stelae parks of Aksum. It is 
a vast field dotted with monoliths 
that are only roughly worked. Most of 
them are several metres high. “The 
blocks of stone were quarried from 
Mount Gobadura,” says Zibelo, point-
ing in the distance to traces in the 
vegetation left by the rollers used to 
transport them. After so many centu-
ries, the grass has not grown back. 
The sight is indeed astonishing: 
thousands of tons of stone took this 
path. It is enough to see the enor-
mous slab in the central park that 
measures about 20 metres by seven. 
Its weight is estimated at 360 tons. 
Next to it, the largest monolith ever 
sculpted by humans lies broken, a 
wounded colossus. The legend that 
angels transpor ted the stones 
becomes almost plausible.
Riddles and 
revelations
Legend easily takes root where his-
tory fails. No date, no name appears 
on these immense chunks of stone.

### Roha the wonderful
6
The village was called Roha, “the 
Wonderful”, back when the very 
pious king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela had 
11 monolithic churches hewn from 
the rock, linked to each other by a 
vertiginous maze of tunnels, their 
walls pierced with cavities, some of 
them with a foot sticking out of 
some saint laid to rest there several 
centuries ago. 
The living and the dead are accus-
tomed to rubbing elbows in this 
place where nothing seems impossi-
ble – not even carving an entire 
church, with portico, naves, vaults, 
upper stories, windows, out of a 
single block of stone. Beta Medhane 
Alem, the largest of the 11 churches 
inscr ibed on the UNESCO World 
Heritage List, rests on 34 pillars 
forming a rectangle 34 metres by 24. 
It is practically the size of Notre 
Dame of Paris! 
As for the double church, Golgotha-
Michael, also called Debre Sinai and 
Golgotha: it offers one of the most 
spectacular views. The king, after 
whom the village is now named, is 
buried there, adjacent to the tomb of 
Adam – ancestor of all humanity, in 
the Biblical tradition. Take one step 
in Lalibela, and you tumble from his-
tory into myth. 
A short distance from this hillside 
nest of churches lies St George, the 
only one with a drainage system and 
probably the most recent of the 
churches hewn on the orders of King 
Lalibela. One can see it from a dis-
tance jutting out of the earth inside 
a huge pit with its roof sculpted with 
interconnected crosses. Standing 
next to it, you feel dwarfed by the 
cross-shaped structure, with its 12 
façades rising 12 metres. Its three 
stories are marked on the outside by 
ledges and windows. “Those at the 
bottom have no windows because 
that’s Noah’s level,” says Muchaw, 
one of the site’s official guides. “It’s 
to prevent flood water coming in,” 
he adds with a smile. 
To reach another group of churches, 
which, from afar, seem to be strad-
dling each other, one must walk by a 
stream called Jordan, which flows 
past another hill crowned by a small 
bell hanging on a dead tree – Mount 
Thabor – and you cross the cave of 
Bethlehem: the Holy Land in 
 miniature ! 
According to one of the many contra-
dictory legends surrounding King 
Lalibela, he founded Roha when he 
returned from exile in Jerusalem and 
intended it to become a new holy 
city in Africa.
Lalibela at Risk
It welcomes some 140,000 pilgrims a 
year, between Christmas and Tikmet 
(Epiphany), says Belete, the most 
popular person around. He heads a 
staff of 20 at the Tourism and Culture 
Office in the village of 12,000 inhabi-
tants, which is located some 600 km 
north of Addis Ababa. For Belete, 
tourism is the wave of the future: 
“Between July 2007 and March 2008, 
more than 8,000 tourists stayed in 
our 12 hotels,” he reports. 
His office, funded by the Amhara 
Regional Council, receives contribu-
tions from the central government 
and from the Authority for Research 
and Conservation of Cultural Heritage 
(ARCCH). Safeguarding projects on 
the Lalibela site are also supported 
by the European Union, UNESCO 
and several NGOs, notably Plan 
International.   …
roha thE WondErful
Perched at an altitude of 2,500 metres in 
the Amhara region, the small village of 
Lalibela has been home to an astonishing 
gem of religious architecture for the last 
eight centuries. Constructed of single 
blocks of stone, the village’s churches were 
added to the World Heritage List in 1978.

Kirstos, as well as a triptych painted 
by the king’s own hand, the priest 
lets me go off alone to explore the 
depths of the cave. As my eyes get 
used to the dark, I spot a grinning 
skeleton, stretched out in a long 
wooden box. Recovering from the 
shock, I see a vast ossuary spread 
out in f ront of me. It could 
easily contain the remains of 
5,740 people. 
What happened in this grotto? From 
what period do these bones really 
date? Answers remain vague. But it 
seems, in Lalibela, just one step is 
enough to take you from imagination 
to reality.  
 nestled there, barely visible. It is 
protected by a newly-constructed 
high wall. 
The inside of the sanctuary is like a 
theatre: daylight only reaches one 
side of the church and a small royal 
palace of brick and earth nearby. 
Splendid liturgical drums are heaped 
on the straw-covered floor. The straw 
is spread over animal skins, under 
which are bones. “The church was 
built on water,” explains the priest, 
lifting the small lid inserted in the 
ground to convince unbelievers. 
Behind the church, the body of its 
architect is laid out on the bare 
ground, wrapped in multicoloured 
sheets, close to the sarcophagus of 
the holy king and the tomb of his 
holy spouse. She bore him no chil-
dren. “Their union was only spirit-
ual,” says the priest, launching into 
an astonishing biography of the king, 
who every day received the visit of 
the archangels Gabriel and Raphael, 
bringing food for the 5,740 pilgrims 
come from the four corners of the 
world to admire his work and his 
wisdom. The precision of the num-
bers is also surprising. 
Having shown me the cross God 
 himself forged and gave to Imrahana 
… While one of UNESCO’s main 
concerns is preventing the churches’ 
deterioration due to infiltration of 
rainwater, Belete’s first preoccupa-
tion is the disadvantaged population 
that lives on the site and is causing 
damage. It is imperative to relocate 
these 270 families as quickly as pos-
sible, he thinks. 
Right now he lacks a specific plan 
and an accurate idea of cost, but he 
is optimistic. For this dynamic young 
leader, the image of a clean and well 
maintained Lalibela is paramount. “I 
spread the word in the village’s five 
schools and it’s working,” he says 
proudly. 
He is equally worried about the con-
dition of 24 churches in the vicinity 
of Lalibela, 14 of which are not part 
of any safeguarding plan. “They 
should all be inscribed on the World 
Heritage List,” he maintains. To con-
vince me, he takes me on a tour. 
One stands out because of its amaz-
ing natural setting. It was built by 
Lalibela’s predecessor King Imrahana 
Kirstos.
The mysteries of 
Imrahana Kirstos
More than 40 minutes’ drive to cover 
the 12 kilometres separating Lalibela 
from a very poor hamlet at the foot 
of a mountain. Then half an hour of 
climbing, on a slope with no visible 
sign of human life… except a group 
of women returning from the market 
on the other side of the mountain. 
Halfway up, we leave the trail and 
suddenly an immense cliff looms 
above us like a thick cloud petrified 
centuries ago. A small church is

then through a village with houses 
scattered around (one of which surely 
belongs to the walking man) and 
finally through a vast wasteland 
dominated by a butte. Here, at an 
altitude of 2,700 m, the contours of 
the two ruins stand out in the vista 
set upon a lush green platform, sur-
rounded by an endless chain of 
mountains. 
Curiosity quickens the pace. In front 
of what was once a lavish royal castle, 
a farmer works his land. The plough, 
pulled by two oxen, moves back and 
forth placidly. Three age periods are 
intertwined in an instant. 
This was the castle of Susenyos, 
Ethiopian Negus who fought fiercely 
to seize the throne in 1607, only 
coming to regret it bitterly, no doubt, 
some 20 years later. “He ended up 
with his tongue hanging down to his 
feet,” says Aseged Tesfaye, a young 
man with a degree in tourism man-
agement, well versed in the official 
and unofficial stories  …

An elongated figure appears against 
the horizon. A man is walking bare-
footed. He would resemble a 
Giacometti sculpture (Swiss), if it 
weren’t for the tree he is carrying 
over his shoulder. Dead and forked, 
the tree’s branches are twisted as if 
they were in pain. Its white trunk 
contrasts sharply against the man’s 
dark skin. The man does not stop to 
catch his breath, moving so quickly 
that one has to run to keep up with 
him. Where is he off to in such a 
hurry, with a tree taller than he? 
We are on the high plateau of Dankez 
in northeast Ethiopia, not far from 
Gondar, the beautiful imperial city 
founded by King Fasilides in 1632. 
Dankez is a three-hour journey from 
Gondar. By car, one sets out over 40 
km of paved road, then 30 km of dirt 
road , followed by 8 km or so of big 
yellow stones. By then, the vehicle 
can only crawl along until finally 
forced to stop near a tree in the 
middle of nowhere. This marks the 
start of a long hike by foot, first 
passing through an immense stretch 
of pasture land with vivid colours, 
thE Country of 
thE King With thE 
Protruding tonguE
The Royal City of Gondar was founded by the 
Ethiopian Negus Fasilides in the 17th century. 
Several of his successors built their palaces 
in the same court, forming a complex of rare 
beauty. The site was inscribed on UNESCO’s 
World Heritage List in 1979. Not far away,  
the ruins of a more ancient castle left in solitude have another story to tell.

much damage as the bombing. We 
had to close it to the public for 11 
years during a new UNESCO restora-
tion. It reopened a little more than 
three years ago. You can imagine the 
deplorable state its ceiling was in 
when you see the Bacaffa palace 
today,” says Getnet, before showing 
me the home of the last king to reign 
in this citadel, from 1721 to 1730.
The palace of the 
beautiful queen
Nicknamed “The Merciless”, Bacaffa 
nonetheless comes off as a bon 
vivant when one sees how much 
space he devoted to his festivities: 
his reception hall is as large as the 
rest of the palace! Bacaffa is remem-
bered mostly because he fell in love 
with a commoner, a young woman he 
supposedly met while traveling 
incognito around his kingdom. As 
Queen Mentaweb (“How beautiful 
you are”), the woman governed the 
country with a firm hand as regent 
w h e n  h e r  h u s b a n d  d i e d . 
Theexceptional beauty of this woman 
can be admired in a mural found in 
the very middle of Lake Tana, the 
largest in Ethiopia (see “The intangi-
ble treasures of Lake Tana”).  … continued on page 15 
“Find a town that begins with the 
word ‘go’. When you find it, you will 
proclaim it the capital of your king-
dom.” After Gojam, Gouzara and 
Gorgora, came Gondar. And Dankez? 
“Dankez is also called Gomenge,” 
declares Aseged, with a triumphant 
smile. 
When Fasilides had his palace built in 
this town protected by a high range 
of mountains, he probably never sus-
pected that eight of his successors 
would reside in the same compound 
for another 100 years. Each added 
his own palace, rivaling the others in 
beauty. “That ’s what makes the 
seven-hectare complex unique in the 
world,” says site specialist Getnet. It 
was added to the World Heritage List 
in 1979. 
After pointing out the Portuguese 
and Indian influences on the archi-
tecture of Fasilides’s palace, Getnet 
explains to me how the building was 
badly damaged by a 1704 earthquake, 
looted by the dervishes of the 
Sudanese Mahdi in the 19th century, 
and bombed by the British in 1941 
because Mussolini’s top army officers 
were headquartered there. “But the 
bad repairs done by the Italians 
during the occupation caused as 
…from the region. “God pun-
ished him for abandoning his faith, 
when for 1,300 years the Ethiopian 
kings had all been orthodox,” he 
continues. 
Aided in his rise to power by the wily 
Pedro Paez, head of the Jesuit mis-
sion implanted in Ethiopia 40 years 
before, Susenyos conver ted to 
Catholicism to gain Portugal’s support 
to fight the Muslims. A century had 
passed by since Ahmad al Ghazi, 
sultan of Harare in the southeast, had 
launched his holy war. The specter of 
the sultan, nicknamed Ahmad Gragne 
– the Left-handed – still haunts hun-

abdicate in favour of his son, 
Fasilides.

### The Intangible treasures of Lake Tana
10
“There are hundred of churches around 
here,” says Wedu, moving his arm to 
trace a wide arc. But all you can see is 
the papyrus reeds at the edge of the 
water and the trees further inland on 
the islands. “Our kings hid a lot of 
their treasure here. Some are also 
buried here. You will see their crowns 
and their crosses, their robes embroi-
dered in gold….” In the most trou-
bled periods of Ethiopian history, 
Lake Tana remained a haven of peace. 
Who indeed would try conquering 
islands which seemed to contain only 
virgin forest? 
A single gateway is visible in the dis-
tance, standing on the water’s edge in 
a majestic natural setting. But once 
past the door, you realize that beauty 
has a price: the Narga Selassie Church, 
dedicated to the Ethiopian queen, 
Mentaweb (see the article “In the 
country of the king with the protrud-
ing tongue”), can only be seen after 
walking a long path flanked by ruins. 
Its conical thatched roof rests on 
29 pillars limited by the external 
ambulatory - kena mahelate - reserved 
for the priests during services. A 
second ser ies of arcades forms 
another circle where the congrega-
tion stands, the men in the northern 
section, the women to the south. The 
sanctuary dominates the centre; its 
walls, richly decorated with paint-
ings, rise all the way to the roof, 
showing nothing of its sacrosanct 
inner space. It shelters, as do all 
Ethiopian churches, a replica of the 
Ark of the Covenant, the chest con-
taining God’s Ten Commandments, 
that Menelik, Ethiopia’s first legen-
dary king, is said to have brought 
back from Jerusalem 3,000 years ago 
(See “The silent giants”).
When images speak 
instead of words
The majority of Lake Tana’s churches 
were built between the 14th and 
18th centuries, following the same 
architectural plan. The three circles 
represent the Holy Tr inity. In 
Ethiopian iconography, it is always 
represented by three identical old 
men “because you cannot differenti-
ate between the Father, the Son and 
the Holy Spirit,”  …
they can be read like a 
book of Ethiopian history.

At dawn, coming up to Dek, the 
largest of the 30-odd islands 
and islets scattered on Lake Tana, a 
swarm of papyrus boats loaded with 
wood, as if conjured up from Egyp-
tian antiquity, is slowly approaching 
us. “It’s Friday, the day of the wood 
market in Bahir Dar,” says the young 
guide, Wedu. “They will have to row 
about eight hours before they get to 
the town.” 
In our little motor boat, we have 
taken scarcely an hour and a half to 
make the same trip in the other 
direction. We have left behind us the 
source of the Blue Nile, which joins 
the White Nile in Khartoum, in Sudan, 
to form the fabulous river that is 
named after the Egyptian god, Hapy. 
We are now sailing in the middle of 
the largest Ethiopian lake. Bahir Da, 
capital of the Amhara Region, forms 
a crescent on much of its bank, oppo-
site of which are strewn the ruins of 
royal palaces. 
thE intangiblE trEaSurES of laKE tana
The country could be 
subject to fire and sword, 
but no invader ever troubled 
the serene peace of Lake 
Tana. For that reason, the 
Ethiopian kings safely hid 
their treasures in churches 
on the lake’s islands. But 
upon careful observation, 
another treasure is revealed 
as one discovers the mural 
paintings in these churches: 
Papyrus boats carrying wood to Bahir Dar market.

### The Intangible treasures of Lake Tana
… the priest explains, going 
on to divulge a few details of eccle-
siastical life. 
“On a normal day, we pray three 
times, morning, noon and evening. 
But on Saturday evening, all the 
clergy assemble, along with the 
righteous people in the village, to 
pray all night. The prayers end on 
Sunday at nine in the morning, after 
which we give the villagers an hour 
of instruction.” 
What kind of isntruction? “We give 
them advice for everyday life, we tell 
them what to do so they will go to 
heaven when they die, we explain 
the differences between the Old and 
the New Testament.” 
The Ethiopian church has the same 
respect for the Old Testament as for 
the Gospels, to the point that Moses 
and Pharaoh are habitually accompa-
nied by Saint Michael and Saint Raphael 
in the sanctuary’s central paintings. On 
the southern face of the same circular 
wall, it is always the Virgin who wel-
comes women worshippers. Facing her, 
the archangel, Michael, holds scales: a 
crowd of small figures standing on one 
tray, a jug of water on the other. The 
Virgin has a finger discreetly placed on 
the second one. 
At their feet, a “comic strip” tells a 
macabre tale. “This one is Balaesam. 
Three devils turned him into a can-
nibal and he ate 78 people,” explains 
Wedu, pointing to the monster 
devouring dismembered bodies. “But 
one day, he met a leper who was suf-
fering terribly from thirst, and he 
gave him water,” the guide contin-
ues, pointing to the images. “When 
Balaesam died, he was supposed to 
go straight to Hell. But when Michael 
weighed his monstrous acts against 
his one act of kindness, Mary remem-
bered her promise of forgiveness and 
made the water weigh more than the 
souls of his victims.”
The Seven Syrian 
Monks
In the churches of Lake Tana, the 
lower register of the sanctuary wall is 
devoted to Ethiopian history. 
Important moments in the lives of 
local kings and saints are portrayed 
in successive images, telling the 
people what they cannot read in the 
many Ethiopian manuscripts written 
on parchment, as these were gener-
ally written in Gu’ez language. The 
language died out in the 14th cen-
tury and today it is used only in 
liturgy. 
At the bottom of the wall, one often 
finds depictions of the Ethiopian 
fathers of Christianity, known as the 
“Seven Saints of Syria” (though his-
torically speaking not all of them 
came from there). These “Saints” are 
credited with building the oldest 
monasteries in the country. One of 
them, called Abba Aragawi, is always 
portrayed with a dragon at his side. 
He is believed to have founded one of 
the strangest monasteries in the 
Amhara region, Debre Damo. At an 
altitude of 3,000 metres, it is perched 
at the top of a 15-metre cliff, forming 
a right angle  … continued on page 18

top part can be found in the court-
yard of the social sciences depart-
ment at the university in Addis 
Ababa. “There are no fewer than 
13 swords engraved on it, which 
means this warrior killed 13 ene-
mies,” the custodian continues.
Another prevalent symbol is an 
African stool. “In fact it’s probably a 
head-rest – a wooden pillow, if you 
like – used by Africans. It symbolizes 
repose,” explains Eshete. He draws 
my attention to the symbol, “∑”, tell-
ing me that it could represent hills, 
or otherwise represent a woman.
If these were indeed warriors, there 
were obviously women in their midst. 
“Therer are 40 stelae in this ceme-
tery. Bodies of people aged 18 to 
30 were found,” explains Senai 
Eshete, the custodian in charge of 
the World Heritage site. “It is likely 
they were warriors, because the 
sword is the most predominant image 
on the stelae.” 
The largest stele, situated at the 
entrance of the site, was five metres 
Two “Ethiopian Amazons” are there 
to prove it. Al l the feminine 
attributes are represented on these 
stelae. 
No one has been to determine with 
any certainty the age of the stelae, 
but the analysis of human remains 
suggests that they are from the 
period between the 10th and 15th 
centuries. The bones and jewels dis-
covered in the tombs have been 
deposited in the Ethiopian National 
Museum, while the small improvised 
museum on the site keeps an 
unsorted collection of ethnographic 
objects.  

Not far from Addis Ababa, 
in the Soddo Region, is a 
field that contains stelae 
found nowhere else in 
the world. A cemetery 
was uncovered, with 
bodies buried in the 
position of prayer. We are 
in the very mysterious 
archeological site of Tiya, 
inscribed on the World 
Heritage List in 1980.

### Saving the Cuban Noticieros
Passionate advocate of the preser-
vation of cinematographic heri-
tage, she launched an ambitious 
project this summer: preserving nearly 
1,500 Cuban short films that recap 
the history of the 20th century. They 
form the substance of her next 
70-minute documentary: A Cuban 
Memory of the World. This significant 
c inematographic collec t ion has 
 submitted its candidacy to UNESCO’s 
Memory of the World Register.
On 1 January 2009, Cuba will mark 
the 50th anniver sar y of i t s 
Revolution. Cinema was a major 
 vehicle for the revolutionary enthu-
siasm of the early years, and films 
were made to proclaim the ideals of 
justice and solidarity. Less than 
three months after the revolution 
the Cuban government founded the 
Instituto cubano del arte e industria 
cinematograficos (Cuban institute of 
cinema art and industry, ICAIC). 
Then, in 1987, Colombian writer 
Gabriel García Márquez (1982 Nobel 
Prize winner) inaugurated the Escuela 
Internacional de Cine y TV (EICTV) 
with Fidel Castro, in San Antonio de 
los Baños, near Havana.   …

Duplication on 35 mm film and 
appropriate storage are the only 
reliable means of preserving our 
audiovisual heritage, according 
to Franco-Brazilian director and 
screen writer Alice de Andrade, 
who is concerned about digital 
materials, formats and equipment 
becoming obsolete. Daughter 
of the famous director Joaquim 
Pedro de Andrade (1932-1988), 
a leader of the Cinema Novo 
movement in Brazil, she recently 
restored 14 of her father’s films. 
The project took four years.

### Saving the Cuban Noticieros

tion digital restoration of his 14 
films turned me into a passionate 
advocate of safeguarding cinemato-
graphic heritage. In the interim, 
economic hardship and the climate of 
the island had combined to let salt-
peter and mould wreak havoc with 
Cubas film collections. Kept in poor 
conditions, they required urgent 
action. 
I then proposed setting up a work-
shop to safeguard this heritage as 
part of EICTV, which had all the 
resources for such a project. Several 
teachers had even participated in the 
production of the now-endangered 
films, and were therefore directly 
concerned by their fate. And the 
school has the infrastructure and 
equipment needed for the analysis of 
film material, a prerequisite for res-
toration: editing and cutting facili-
t ies, a f ilm department, photo 
laboratory, screening rooms and 
sound studio. 
Last summer we put on the first 
Cinematographic Conser vat ion 
Workshop, with the support of the 
International Federation of Film 
Archives of the Ibermedia Programme 
for the development of Spanish-
American audiovisual production, as 
well as Cuba’s National Commission 
for UNESCO. At the same time the 
ICAIC, with the Cuban Film Archives 
and EICTV, launched a safeguarding 
campaign for  the Not ic ie ros 
Latinoamericanos ICAIC.
Noticieros 
Latinoamericanos: 
unique perspective
The Noticieros Latinoamericanos ICAIC 
were weekly news magazines, pre-
senting the latest regional and inter-
national headlines in a direct and 
original style. Between 1960 and 
1990, Cubans were wild about them, 
crowding into the island’s 60 cinema 
theatres to catch the week’s news 
update. Some of the audience would 
even leave af ter the Noticieros 
Latinoamericanos ICAIC, not staying 
to watch the film that followed. 
Armed at first with rudimentary cam-
eras and leftover f ilm reels, the 
ICAIC “image warriors” filmed bomb-
ings, uprisings, revolutions and 
political coups all over the world, as 
well as profiles of great Cuban art-
ists. That was how they learned the 
art of film-making. Increasingly well-
equipped as they went along, they 
ended up as the years passed writing 
the history of the 20th century, from 
a unique perspective. 
Thank s  to  Sant iago Álvarez 
(1919-1998), exuberant and innova-
tive director who embodied the spirit 
of the Noticieros Latinoamericanos 
ICAIC adventure, a number of “icono-
clastic” documentaries   …
…Cuba was still at that time a 
major centre of Latin American film 
production. Coppola, Scorsese, Scola, 
Taviani, Sorín, Jarmush, Tarantino, 
Storaro are only some of the great 
names who taught there. Students 
came from Africa, Asia and Latin 
America: Juan Carlos Cremata, Eryk 
Rocha, Camila Guzmán Urzúa, Tanya 
Hermida, Vicente Ferraz attended the 
“school of the three worlds”, as it 
was called back then. Today it is the 
“school of all the worlds”, open to 
everyone. 
I learned film-making in this melting 
pot of cultures and personalities at a 
time when Cuba was undergoing the 
greatest crisis in its history, just 
after the fall of the socialist block in 
the late 1980s. 
I did not go back to Havana until 16 
years later, for the presentation of 
the entire restored collection of films 
made by my father, the Brazilian 
director Joaquim Pedro de Andrade.

continued from page 9  … It is thought to be the only 
portrait of the queen done in her 
lifetime. 
Mentaweb’s palace in Gondar has 
been transformed today into a cul-
ture and handicrafts centre. Aschalew 
Worku Tassew, chief of the culture 
and tourism department, expresses 
pride: “With the help of the World 
Bank, more than 130 people have 
been trained for different jobs. There 
are now seven handicraft associa-
tions, headed by a federation. They 
have begun to export their products 
to Frankfurt, Germany. This work is 
bringing in average monthly revenues 
of 3,000 birr (about 250 euros) per 
person.” Looking calm and serious, 
Tassew also talks about the numer-
ous restorations completed or under-
way at Gondar. But his expression 
darkens when he mentions Dankez: 
“The condition of the ruins is alarm-
ing. At this rate, the Castle of 
Susenyos will be lost in two years. A 
team of Spanish archeologists 
recently produced a report that can 
be used for future restoration. We 
need international aid.” 
If nothing is done, nature could over-
come stone and erase forever the 
vestiges of a fascinating chapter in 
Ethiopian history. And the verses 
inspired by Gondar in the 1930s, by 
the French writer and ethnologist 
Michel Leiris will echo all the more 
poignantly in the devastated 
landscape: 
“Huts of straw and stones,  
Among ruins falling away in pieces  
For days on end,  
I was in love with an Abyssinian 
woman,  
Bright as straw,  
Cold as stone,  
Her voice, so pure, twisted my arms 
and legs.  
At the sight of her,  
My head cracked,  
And my heart crumbled.  
It too  
Like a ruin.”  
…were produced. Some became 
world-famous: Now!, Hanói, Mardi 13, 
Ciclón, 79 printemps ou Hasta la victo-
ria siempre. In all, 1,493 Noticieros 
Latinoamericanos ICAIC were made 
over 30 years, each about 10 minutes 
long.
Countering  
the irreversible
Our cinematographic safeguarding 
workshop analyzed 33 of these last 
summer. For three weeks in the San 
Antonio de los Baños coconut grove, 
seven eminent international experts 
volunteered their services to develop 
a recovery strategy for the Cuban 
film archives. They trained 35 Latin-
American apprentices, most of them 
Cuban. 
Besides courses in theory, we pre-
pared film material that we sent to 
Mexico for restoration (the ICAIC lab 
is excellent, but out of commission 
since 2005). In only one week, 9 edi-
tions of the Noticieros were dupli-
cated on silver emulsion (35 mm) 
film. We then screened and analyzed 
the restored films. A unified and 
motivated working team was formed 
and I am proud to say, without fear 
of contradiction, that all who par-
ticipated in this adventure will 
remain forever committed to con-
serving moving images. 
It is important to stress that every-
one realized this film collection was 
threatened and on the brink of suf-
fering irreversible damaged. The col-
lection urgently needs to be copied 
onto silver emulsion 35 mm film, still 
the only reliable material for preserv-
ing our audiovisual heritage. The new 
technologies represent considerable 
resources, but are fraught with risk 
– materials, formats and equipment 
are expensive and become rapidly 
obsolete. 
The ICAIC, which has just received 
one million euros from the Junta de 
Andalucía (Spain) to rebuild its film 
storage facilities and fix up its film 
laboratory, was receptive to our 
project. 
Now the Cuban government must 
invest as much energy as it initially 
put into the production of the 
Noticieros into their conservation. It 
took 30 years to create the collec-
tion, and it will take at least 10 to 
save it. 
The ICAIC will again take on its pio-
neering role in global film-making, 
this time through the conservation 
and promotion of its film heritage. 
This article appears in the UNESCO 
Courier this month to mark World 
Day for Audiovisual Heritage on 
27 October.

### Atahualpa Yupanqui: artist of the essential
16
Andrea Cohen, who wrote this tri-
bute to her famous compatriot, 
produced a radio show on him in 2005, 
for France Culture, Radio France’s 
cultural station. 
Atahualpa Yupanqui is undoubtedly 
the most renowned and emblematic 
of Argentinean exiles in Paris. The 
most cryptic too. He did indeed leave 
Argentina, but it remained inside 
him, piercing through each of his 
verses and his tunes. He was the 
embodiment of all that is Andean, 
down to his name. The man whose 
birth 100 years ago we are today 
commemorating was not named 
Atahualpa Yupanqui, but Héctor 
Roberto Chavero. His father came 
from an old Argentinean family, his 
mother was Basque and he was born 
in Buenos Aires province.

“He had a striking look, as they say, an Indian 
look… His hair stayed black until the last 
minute... He had very penetrating eyes, you felt 
naked in front of him… He was very tender…” 
He was born 100 years ago, in Campo de la 
Cruz, in Buenos Aires province. He died in 1992 
in Paris. He was the bard of the dispossessed. 
Lone traveler, he rambled through the Andes on 
the back of a mule, saving Amerindian musical 
treasures from oblivion. Then he travelled 
all over the world with his guitar, acclaimed 
wherever he went. He collected some 12,000 songs. His name is Atahualpa Yupanqui. He 
led an exceptional life during which, to use Andrea Cohen’s phrase, he lived three lives.

### Atahualpa Yupanqui: artist of the essential
“Like mud, I am seen  
And I have the sky within me.  
Like stone, I am felt  
And I am silence  
Nothing more.” 
Angel Parra, another exiled Latin 
American artist, close friend and 
neighbour of Atahualpa, completes 
the portrait. “He had a striking look, 
as they say, an Indian look… His hair 
stayed black until the last minute... 
He had very penetrating eyes, you 
felt naked in front of him….He was 
very tender….” And Parra adds, “He 
was in exile just about everywhere.” 
As for myself, I would like to end this 
tribute by quoting the words of one 
of my favourite songs, Los hermanos, 
which to my mind best sums up 
Atahualpa Yupanqui’s personality: 
“Yo tengo tantos hermanos que no 
los puedo nombrar /Y una hermana 
muy hermosa que se llama libertad.” 
(“I have so many brothers I cannot 
name them and one very beautiful 
sister called freedom.”)   
…the Communist Party, to decide 
to live in exile for the rest of his life. It 
seems he needed distance, isolation or 
silence, to preserve his art.
Atahualpa Yupanqui’s 
three lives
Reading Atahualpa Yupanqui’s biog-
raphy, you see he had several lives. 
In his first life, he wrote poems and 
set them to music, travelled around 
Argentina, lived with farmers and 
collected popular songs, acquiring a 
repertory that was to remain his pri-
mary source of inspiration. 
In his second life, around the late 
1940s, he left for France, lived in 
Paris, met poets and artists who 
were Communists like him: Eluard, 
Aragon, Picasso. It was during this 
time that his talent as a poet and as 
a musician was spotted by Edith Piaf, 
who invited him to perform the 
opening act for her show at the 
Théâtre de l’Athénée. The French 
public was immediately smitten. He 
then began to go on his first tours 
through Eastern Europe. 
Finally, in Atahualpa’s third life, he 
was a singer, poet and composer 
known and recognized the world over. 
He was also adulated in his native 
land, where some of his verses became 
proverbs. Still today, Argentineans say 
«las penas son de nosotros, las vaqui-
tas son ajenas» (“troubles are ours, 
cows belong to others”).
I am nothing more 
than silence
When I did my radio show on 
Atahualpa, I met people who knew 
him and were his friends, the pianist 
Miguel Angel Estrella (note, a UNESCO 
Goodwill Ambassador) recalled during 
our interview on how his friend 
Atahualpa would come and visit him 
in his Paris apartment, stand next to 
the piano and say “Purify my soul, 
Miguel, play me some Bach, play 
some Bach.” 
On a less personal note, I went to 
meet one of his French fans, virtuoso 
organist Louis Thiry, who knew 
Atahualpa Yupanqui only through 
recordings. He declared himself “fas-
cinated by the truth that emanates 
from his music,” and went on to 
explain “the brilliance is hidden, the 
playing remains simple, without pre-
tension or artifice… Both in voice 
and instrument, he goes directly to 
the essence.” 
I also talked to Françoise Thanas, 
one of his long-time Parisian friends 
who translated Atahualpa Yupanqui’s 
poems and wrote a book about him. 
She remembers him as a silent man. 
“Silence, modesty, those are words 
that suit him,” she said, before recit-
ing an excerpt from a poem that 
sounds like a portrait of the artist: 
Atahualpa Yupanqui’s grave in Cerro Colorado cemetery, Córdoba, Argentina.©

has it, the only way to build it, of 
course, was to be carried aloft by a 
dragon. Today, the only way to reach 
it is to climb up by rope, which the 
monks do regularly with remarkable 
ease. Women are banned from climb-
ing the rope, and few men are allowed 
to enter, if they dare to venture up 
there.

of a man standing at his side. “This 
is Yared,” says the guide, Wedu. “He 
was not a good student and was 
thrown out of school. One day when 
he was wandering around he saw an 
insect trying to climb a tree. Six 
times it tried, six times it fell. The 
seventh time it made it. And Yared 
grasped the value of perseverance. 
He went back to school. He was so 
gifted he composed a new form of 
music. It became the music of our 
prayers.” 
Enthralled by the beautiful singing, 
the king is unaware he has planted 
his scepter in the singer’s foot. And 
the singer, swept up in the enthusi-
asm of his own singing, feels no 
pain. In what book could you find a 
better def inition of the art of 
music? 
Just like Queen Mentaweb or Abba 
Aragawi, Yared really existed. He 
lived in the north, in Aksum, which 
was the capital of an immense empire 
when Christianity arrived 1,600 years 
ago. Ever since, his sacred music 
casts a spell over the adamantine 
light of Ethiopian dawn.  
