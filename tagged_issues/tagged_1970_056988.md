Detail of a painting from one of the 469 Buddhist cave chapels hewn from the rock at Tun-huang in the Gobi
Desert of Central Asia. A composition dating from the 7th-8th century T'ang period in China, it depicts a group
of celestial musicians. "The overwhelming impression of T'ang painting at Tun-huang," writes Anil de Silva
in Chinese Landscape Painting in the Caves of Tun-huang (Methuen, London; Crown Publishers,
New York, 1967), "is its strength and powerful vitality. ..In these murals the brush strokes seem charged with
a dynamic life of their own." Founded in the 4th century A.D., the Tun-huang cave complex at one time
numbering over a thousand grottoes became a centre of Buddhist learning in China and the repository of an
unbroken tradition of 1,500 years of Chinese painting. Detail is from a work in the National Palace Museum,
Taipei (Republic of China).

If there is one symbol that typifies Carthage,
it is certainly the so-called "sign of Tanit",
which has received a host of interpretations
down the centuries. Originally, the sign
of Tanit was a trapezium crowned by a
horizontal line with a circle above it.
Later the trapezium became a simple isosceles
triangle. One variant is shown on right.
A crescent moon and sun were often
depicted above it. Tanit was the female
consort of Ba'al Hammon, a leading deity
of ancient Carthage. She was the
goddess of fertility and protector of the dead.
She may also be symbolized on miniature
obelisk (centre photo) of 4th century B.C.
Breasts symbolizing fertility surmount
lunar and solar emblems. Other Tanit
motifs are published on page 40. Right,

demon faces were worn by cult dancers
(see colour photo page 24).

Two thousand years ago the Roman
Senate rang with Marcus Porcius
Cato's fanatical cry " Delenda est
Carthago " (Carthage must be
destroyed). Not long thereafter the
Roman legions sacked the Punic
capital and razed it to the ground.
Today, on the shores of the
Mediterranean, only a few miles from
Tunis, the remains of ancient
Carthage and the lovely Medina of
Tunis itself are threatened by a new
menace : submersion and destruction
in a sea of urban concrete. Unesco
and the Tunisian Government are
facing the challenge and have just
embarked on an ambitious programme
for the safeguard and development
of the Carthage-Tunis region. It
is to the story of Carthage's glorious
past and the cultural legacy that the
Medina represents that this issue of
the " Unesco Courier "is devoted.

N the history of Tunisia
an ancient crossroads of civilizations
in the Mediterranean world Carthage
is one of the peaks rising from a cul¬
tural landscape that stretches back
over several thousand years. Yet we
who live in Carthage have seen the
start and now watch the advance of a
process that threatens to destroy the
city and its site, so that one day
Carthage may be no more than a
memory.
The plight of Carthage is not unique.
In all parts of the world, dozens of
ancient sites and cities seem doomed
to disappear. These irreplaceable
treasures of man's cultural heritage
demand to be reprieved, to be saved
from obliteration by the tentacular
spread of cities and industries.
This is something that all of us must
have realized, whether we have stud¬
ied the problems of urban develop¬
ment or whether one day we simply
noticed that the trees in a familiar
square had been chopped down to
make way for a car park.
The damage we are doing to our
environment has become a world-wide
issue. Each day we read of new
acts of violence against nature, and
everyone who witnesses this continu
ing process of destruction, whether
scientist or layman, feels a sense
of personal injury and loss from these
depredations.
Yet the defacement of sites of natu¬
ral beauty and the blotting out of his¬
torical and archaeological remains
seems to go on unabated, until public
opinion finally comes to accept the
process of deterioration that accompa¬
nies the spread of cities. This passive
resignation leads us to hand over
archaeological sites to be exploited by
the kind of uncontrolled urban develop¬
ment that quickly covers them with a
chaotic sprawl of houses and hotels.
The effects of this destruction are
everywhere apparent, yet public opin¬
ion seems to assent to this urban and
industrial aggression, which ends by
radically modifying man's relationship
to his natural environment and effacing
the vestiges of his historic past.
Today, the city of Carthage and the
surrounding area is reduced to little
more than a handful of scattered ruins,
fast disappearing, and a countryside
marred by unattractive buildings. The
ancient Punic ports still reflect the
grandeur of the Carthage of old, but
future generations may find no trace
of the Punic and Roman towns, buried

as they seem likely to be under the
bricks and mortar of a modern housing
complex.
Not long ago, when the temples of
Abu Simbel in Nubia were threatened
by the waters of the Nile, Unesco's
Director-General, René Maheu, declar¬
ed that it was inconceivable that the
men of today should fail to preserve,
for themselves and for posterity, the
heritage handed down by their ances¬
tors. Unesco launched an international
campaign and Abu Simbel was saved.
But what of Carthage, another trea¬
sure of man's cultural heritage, whose
importance in the history of Tunis and
to our knowledge of the early Medi¬
terranean world is recalled in this
issue of the "Unesco Courier"?
And how is Carthage to be saved?
This is a question which the Tunisian
government and Unesco, co-operating
in the Tunis-Carthage project, are
trying to answer. They have begun
by systematically surveying the pre¬
sent state of sites and monuments
prior to drawing up a plan of restorat¬
ion and conservation.

### 188334: Carthage must not be destroyed
CARTHAGE MUST NOT BE DESTROYED (Continued)
From Tunis to the walls of Carthage
the spectrum of concrete
with the pressures of urban expansion,
the basic problems are identical, and
the methods and scope of conserva¬
tion vary only in relation to the resour¬
ces available.
Damage to the environment seems
most often to result from rapid growth
which state or local authorities have
failed to meet with a coherent policy
of urban planning. Whatever the site,
the same problems arise: a population
explosion that sets off unchecked
urban expansion; the chaotic and
uncontrolled use of land by industry;
the relentless spread of road networks.
There are, of course, other problems
more specific to buildings and monu¬
ments such as stone decay and disea¬
ses of wood aggravated by the
effects of time and weather. But stone
can better withstand the aging pro¬
cess than the lack of planning for its
care, or even worse, laws that pros
cribe any kind of development at all,
good or bad.
Carthage is a typical example. Pho¬
tographs taken at the beginning of
the century show the Punic ports in
unspoilt surroundings flanked by
protective ramparts of land. Today, a
haphazard sprawl of roads and houses
encircles the two basins which form a
site that any promoter or hotel con¬
structor would be eager to convert
into a tourist centre.
It would be absurd to reject outright
any form of tourist development. But
it would be tragic if the remarkable
complex formed by the Punic ports
should end up as a site for tourist res¬
taurants and bungalows, especially
when due to lack of funds, archaeolo¬
gical research on the site is nowhere
near complete.
The remarkable remains of a civili¬
zation which left its imprint on the
soil of Tunisia thousands of years ago
are too important to be merely record¬
ed in books. They should be studied
scientifically and above all protected so
that future generations may continue
the research. For this, a coherent
programme of archaelogical studies is
needed together with regulations for
the work of excavation and an ade¬
quate budget.
But when it comes to deciding which
research methods to use we face a
serious problem. Isolated research,
undertaken without a methodical plan
of campaign, has often led to amateu¬
rish efforts and produced pitiful results.
It is better for a site to remain pro¬
tected by its covering of earth than
for it to undergo piecemeal dissection.
We have the example of Punic and
Roman objects found on sites in Tuni¬
sia. Some, although widely dispersed,
are safely housed in local museums or

### 188334: Carthage must not be destroyed
Right, ruined splendours
of Roman Carthage.
These columns, carvings
and truncated walls are
the remains of a palatial
villa built at the start of
the 3rd century A.D. in the
colony founded by Rome
after its destruction of
Carthage in 146 B.C.
in those of Europe and elsewhere.
But others have passed into the hands
of antique dealers or, worse still, of
traders to whom the tourist, as if guid¬
ed by some sixth sense, goes to buy
his "souvenirs".
In this way, objects of archaeologi¬
cal interest have acquired a commer¬
cial value to the detriment of their
importance as sources for historic and
ethnographic studies. All along the
Tunisian coast, punie stelae, tear-
bottles and Roman pottery can be had
for the asking at a price.
Here we see the failure of an out-
Master shipbuilders, the Carthaginians
were no less skilful port engineers.
To house their vast fleet of merchant
ships and the galleys that protected
them, they built two ports at Carthage.
Their military port still retains its
original circular shape (photo left).
Two hundred and twenty ships could
anchor in its waters. Connecting
it to the outer commercial port
was a narrow channel that could be
blocked by massive chains when
danger threatened. From the island at
the centre, the Carthaginian Admiralty
passed its orders to the ships by
trumpet calls or signals flashed by
mirrors reflecting the sun's rays.
Today, houses of the small town of
Le Kram cover the peninsula that
runs southwards away from the port.
At top right is the Tunis Lake, cut off
from the open sea by a long causeway
that stretches to Tunis (just out of
sight on top right). Air photo (far left)

on which the city was born.
moded archaeological method that has
all the appearance of a treasure hunt,
concerned primarily with the search for
artefacts and often far removed from
any real interest in the ancient city
itself. Once the thesis has been pub¬
lished and the artefacts are stored in
a museum, what does it matter what
happens to the excavation site, left
unprotected and in disorder?
Despoiled of its treasures and aban¬
doned, Carthage is finding it hard to
resist the pressures of urban develop¬
ment. The conflict between the needs
of the archaeological zone and those
of urban space is everywhere apparent.
Not a month goes by without the foun¬
dations of a new building being laid
on an archaeological site that is of
essential interest to the study of the
ancient city.
By the early 1930s, Tunis was begin¬
ning to break out from its city bounda¬
ries. The spread to the coastal area
began, soon to be followed by en¬
croachment on the site of Carthage
itself which became dotted with villas
and bungalows.
It is now clear that the problem of
urban development is even more acute
than that of the archaeological sites,
although the two are closely linked,
and that If the Tunis-Carthage project
is to work effectively, the deterioration
throughout the area has to be studied
and priorities established.
Unless a plan of integrated develop¬
ment is adopted, the present encroach¬
ment on archaeological, historic and
natural sites will result in their total
destruction by about 1985. Carthage,
the Tunis Medina, the picturesque area
of Sidi bou Said and the hills, dunes
and olive groves of the Tunisian coast¬
line will have been irreparably spoilt
by an urban sprawl sparked off by
population pressure.
By 1985, the population of Tunis
will number between 1,600,000 and
2,000,000at least twice the present
figure. By that time, the coastal area
will have become a landscape of brick
and concrete in the midst of which the
archaeological site will occupy a tiny
place devoid of all interest. In that
case it would perhaps be better if it
disappeared completely.
Moreover, the disappearance of the
archaeological zone would have a
serious effect on the Tunis area. Cen¬
tralization would increase to a danger
point whilst the surrounding country
would be defaced by haphazard spread
of new suburbs, and the exhausting
daily round of commuting would be¬
come part of the Tunis way of life.
An archaeological zone or green
space would do much to maintain an
equilibrium in the city and in its envi¬
ronment. The dangers of the megalo¬
polis and the monotony of endless
rows of concrete blocks have been
described too often by town planners
for us to be excused for failing to heed
their warning. Open spaces and
archaeological sites should be preserv¬
ed and harmoniously integrated with
the Tunis urban complex, so as to
bring the values of nature and history
into its daily life.
Integration of the archaeological
zone into the urban area may, at first
sight, seem of secondary importance
to the urgent task of economic de¬
velopment. But the zone constitutes
a powerful tourist attraction and its im¬
provement can be fully justified as a
factor in economic development as
well as on purely cultural grounds.
Indeed, abandon of the Carthage
site would have the effect of hamper¬
ing economic development, since tour¬
ism, which brings the country much
needed foreign currency, would in all
probability decline.
Within this framework of integrated
development, the Tunis-Carthage pro¬
ject proposes a plan for the organi-

zation of the area which takes into
account:
The archaeological and historic
zones (Carthage and the Tunis Me¬
dina),
The hotel development required for
the promotion of cultural tourism,
Population pressure and the irre¬
versible process of rapid urban
expansion.
These three factors are inseparable;
it would be meaningless to tackle one
without the others. If we accept that
saturation of the site is likely to be
reached in 1985, we might just as
well plan for systematically structured
urban unit developments which would
include archaeological sites and open
spaces, both as an aid to economic
development and to give balance to
the area.
The Tunis-Carthage project's fore¬
cast of population distribution in 1985
is:
Tunis 1,300,000 inhabitants,
Northern coastal area220,000,
Southern coastal area 170,000,
a total capacity of 1,690,000 inha¬
bitants in 1985.
In the Tunis urban unit, a policy of
re-vitalization would restore to the
Medina its rightful role as city centre
and focus of activity. The division
between the "colonial town" and the
"Arab quarter" would disappear and
the spread of "shanty-town" dwellings
would be halted and reversed.
In the northern coastal area, the .
development of the archaeological
zone accompanied by controlled and
organized urban growth, could well
have favourable economic results pro¬
vided that the archaeological remains
can be combined with a historical evo¬
cation of Carthage in such a way as
to present a coherent whole.
The southern coastal urban area,
adjoining the industrial zone, would
stretch out towards the magnificent
beaches of Cap Bon, linking Tunis
with the vast tourist facilities the coun¬
try possesses.
In contrast to these natural tourist
attractions, Tunis itself would offer
the visitor cultural interest in an urban
setting.
Cultural resources can be looked
upon as consumer goods or as raw
materials whose development justifies
capital investment. Profits accrue
both directly, in the tourist economy
sector, and indirectly, in the side
effects on urban development.
Thus although the re-establishment
of the Tunis-Carthage heritage of
monuments is intended primarily to
encourage economic development, this
approach is the only one which can
provide an answer to the archaeolo¬
gical problem of saving Carthage and
ensuring continued research on the
Punic and Roman cities.
Even now measures can be taken
to protect the archaeological zone
while waiting for more extensive
research to begin. Some sites can
be classified as temporarily or per¬
manently barred to builders and others
listed as requiring restrictive develop¬
ment. As soon as funds become
available, a systematic, overall plan of
research relating to the various
periods of the city's history would
determine which sites were of real
archaeological value and thus allow
the others to be released for building.
This brief survey gives some idea
of the task facing the international
team of experts and their Tunisian
counterparts who are attempting to
analyse the process of deterioration of
the archaeological site, Carthage, and
the historic town, the Tunis Medina.
Their proposals for Integrated deve¬
lopment can, however, only become a
reality when an international campaign
has provided the funds required for
the work of excavation, conservation
and development.
Unesco's co-operation, at the
request of the Tunisian Government,
will be a decisive' factor in the rescue
of Carthage.

### 56991: Grandeur and decline of the Punic city-state
Grandeur & decline
of the Punic city-state
by Hedi Slim
T
HE rise of Carthage as a
maritime power is the most illustrious
episode of Phoenicia's imperial ven¬
ture in the western Mediterranean.
By the end of the second millenium
B.C., the Phoenicians had already won
a place in history by their invention of
the alphabet and their vigorous promo¬
tion of navigation and international
trade. They then began to explore the
North African coastline, and pressed
on to the heart of the legendary realm
of Tartessos, of fabulous wealth, in
southern Spain. Before long the route
followed by these intrepid explorers
was studded with trading posts.
Utica was the first Phoenician settle¬
ment in Tunisia, founded in 1101 B.C.:
Carthage came into being three
centuries later, in 814 B.C. Its royal
origin, the events that led to its
creation, and the very meaning of its
name (new town or capital) all seemed
to point towards a glorious future.
For many years, it is true, Carthage
acknowledged the prior claims of Tyre
and Utica, only to supplant them when
the time was ripe. It owed its
ascendancy to its own vigorous expan¬
sion, aided by the disasters that rocked
Phoenicia and the East.
Tyre eluded the grasp of Babylon
only to fall under the sway of Persia,
and Carthage then took the place of
its ill-fated parent city as capital of
the empire.
Carthage occupied a privileged
situation at the heart of the Medi¬
terranean world, and had inherited the
Tyrian sea-going and trading traditions,
backed by a vast empire with a chain
of trading posts. It was thus able to

GRANDEUR AND DECLINE (Continued)
A flourishing trade across the Mediterranean

give fresh impetus to Phoenician
expansion in the western Medi¬
terranean, and itself evolved into a
formidable power able to play a
leading part on the political stage, and
even to influence the destiny of the
world.
Carthage's first concern was to
organize the considerable empire
bequeathed to it. It seems to have
had no great difficulty in getting its
leadership accepted by the various
Phoenician cities of the West, which
agreed to surrender a large part of
their sovereignty in return for the
capital's vital protection from the
avaricious designs of its many Medi¬
terranean rivals.
The second step was to enlarge the
bounds of the empire, after consolid¬
ating its position in Sicily.
From Motya, the Carthaginian forces
moved north under the command of
General Malchus to subdue the local
population of Mount Eryx and occupy
the sites of Segesta, Palermo and
Solonto. They reached Himera and
Selinus, on the border of Greek Sicily.
Carthage then turned its attention to
Sardinia, where it obtained a foothold
in the 6th century B.C.; the cities of
Nora Tharros and Caralis formed the
bridgeheads for a victorious expedition
inland. The island still retains many
vestiges of the Punic civilization which
flourished for centuries on its soil.
About the same period, Carthage
set about consolidating its position
farther to the West. Two Phoenician
cities already existed at Lixus in
Morocco and Gadès (now Cadiz) in
Spain; a new colony was established
at Ibiza in the Balearics.
Thus, towards the end of the
6th century B.C., Carthage had suzer¬
ainty over all the Phoenician colonies
in North Africa, from Tripohtania to
the Atlantic, and over sizeable areas
of Sicily, Sardinia, Spain and the
Balearic Isles.
Thanks to its empire, Carthage
became the wealthiest city-state in the
western Mediterranean. A treaty of
alliance with the Etruscans, then a
powerful nation, consolidated its posi¬
tion. When their common enemy the
Greeks came on the scene, the ties
between the two allies were further
strengthened.
The Phocaeans, founders of Massalia
(Marseilles) about 600 B.C., had soon
become a force to be reckoned with;
they had won the goodwill of the
renowned King of Tartessos, lord of
the silver mines, and contemplated
forming another Phocaean colony in
that part of Spain (now Andalusia);
they had also obtained a foothold in
Corsica, and thus constituted a serious
threat to Carthage.
A combined Punic and Etruscan fleet
succeeded in halting the Phocaean
advance after the Battle of Alalia
(Aleria in Corsica) in 535 B.C. The
Greeks were expelled from Corsica
and Spain; only the Gulf of Lions
remained in their possession. From
that time onwards, Carthaginians and
Etruscans were constantly bound by
trade and military treaties to protect
their common interests.
However, the subsequent decline of
Etruria induced Carthage to seek a
closer alliance with Rome, and three
treaties were negotiated, the first
dating back to 509 B.C. Yet even
while the two powers were ostensibly
allies, Carthage distrusted any attempt
by Rome, in any form, to penetrate its
spheres of influence. Coming events
cast their shadows before, and it is
not surprising that later on, the two
powers were to confront each other
in what was perhaps the most ruthless
and bloody struggle of Antiquity.
The first treaty granted the Romans
trading concessions in Sardinia, Sicily
and Africa, but barred their ships from
skirting the traditionally fertile areas
of central and southern Tunisia. In
the second, the Carthaginians imposed
stiffer terms, expressly forbidding the
Romans to land in Sardinia, Africa or
Andalusia, unless compelled to do so
by circumstances beyond their control.
Carthage was thus unsparing in its
military and diplomatic efforts to
consolidate its position and extend the
bounds of its empire.
T
HE rise of Carthage was
next to be challenged by the power
of Greece, which was at its height in
the 5th century B.C. Greece inflicted
a crushing defeat on the Punic forces
in 480 B.C., near Himera in Sicily; this
marked the turning-point of Carthage's
supremacy as a sea power.
The Greeks' mounting domination of
the eastern and western Mediterranean
led to many changes in the Car¬
thaginians' way of life, which was
thenceforth marked by severe austerity.
Archaeologists have been struck by
the scarcity of imported objects such
as Corinthian and Attic pottery and
Egyptian grave furnishings in the tombs
of that period.
At the same time, Carthage's isola¬
tion and depleted trade raised supply
problems for various commodities
which were by no means luxuries. To
solve its difficulties, renew its fighting
forces and be capable of resisting
any attacks from Greece, Carthage
resolved to conquer a hinterland in
North Africa, roughly corresponding to
the present territory of Tunisia.
The conquest, effected at the cost
of bitter fighting with the local
population, turned the Carthaginians
"from Tynans into Africans." At the
same time, it made a considerable
contribution to the Punic economy,
mainly in the shape of a copious agri¬
cultural output, and to the army, which
had a large contingent of tried warriors
at its command.
The conquest also marked the
beginning of a new era for the Tunisia
of Antiquity, which began to enjoy a
bigger share of the benefits of Punic
civilization. The common inheritance
and national identity of present-day
Tunisia are indelibly stamped with the
Carthaginian influence.
The development of Tunisia, the new
markets opened up in the African
continent, the flourishing trade rela¬
tions formed with the eastern states
emerging from Alexander's conquests,
and the dogged will to recovery,
restored Carthage to its former vigour
at the very time when the Greek cities,
weakened by interminable civil strife,
showed signs of irreparable decline.
Carthage seized every opportunity
to retrieve all it had lost in Sicily. In
vain did Agathocles, Tyrant of Syra¬
cuse try to bar the way, though he
invaded North Africa and reached the
ramparts of Carthage; in vain did
Pyrrhus, King of Epirus and champion
of a rapidly waning Western Hellenism,
fly to the help of the Greek cities of
Sicily; the cause was hopeless, and
Carthage succeeded in extending its
influence to practically the whole
island.
With added effort, it could have
dominated the situation well before
the middle of the 3rd century B.C.;
but it dallied too long, and did not
invest Messina until 269 B.C. to find
itself face to face with Rome, now a
great Mediterranean power. The two
giants were soon locked in mortal
combat; the three phases of the

protracted struggle assumed the
dimension of world wars, measured
by the scale of antiquity.
The last phase of Carthage's
development as a Mediterranean
power occurred between the first and
second Punic Wars. After losing the
first war, Carthage was compelled
to withdraw from Sicily completely.
Some germs of weakness were
already sapping its strength; its ruling
caste was often blinkered by self-
interest, and morbidly hostile to true
greatness or reforming zeal.
o
NE Carthaginian general,
Hamilcar Barca, was clear-sighted
enough to detect the causes of his
country's ills, and draw a lesson from
all its recent misfortunes. To him
belongs the credit for the renewed
expansion of the Carthaginian empire
in the Mediterranean. The measures
he adopted were revolutionary by
comparison with the Carthaginians'
conception of their imperial role.
He borrowed his remedies from the
Hellenist kings, who combined regal
power with military authority; but a
monarchy at Carthage was unthinkable.
It was not, therefore, at home that
Hamilcar was to found his kingdom,
but in Spain, where the Phoenicians
and Carthaginians had already made
their fortunes; it was at once far
enough from Rome and Carthage to
allay their suspicions, and wealthy
enough to offset the isolation of the
Punic economy in case of war.
Hamilcar realized that in Spain he
could lay the foundations of a strong
monarchic and military power, while
finding at hand all the economic and
human resources he needed. He
promptly set about the conquest of
the country, and soon subdued a part
of it.
He modelled his approach on such
empire-builders "as Alexander, and
based his rule on military power,
fostering the legend of the inspired
and invincible leader. At the same
time, he enlisted defeated troops
and encouraged mixed marriages to
assimilate the local population.
His successor Hasdrubal followed in
his footsteps, and founded a second
"new capital", Carthagena, which
robbed Carthage of the distinction of
being the one and only "new Tyre";
he built a palace there and assumed
the title of king.
The benefits of the Spanish conquest
were soon felt throughout the Punic
world. In less than twenty years
Hamilcar, Hasdrubal and Hannibal (all
of the Barcid family) had succeeded
in replenishing the coffers and renovat¬
ing the economic and military strength
of Carthage. Vast horizons were
re-opening before the Carthaginian
empire when Rome, fearful of the
inevitable developments that lay ahead,
hastened to declare war on Carthage.
Hannibal's defeat on African soil in
202 B.C. sounded the knell of Carthage
as a Mediterranean power. Thence¬
forth, until its destruction in 146 B.C.,
the unfortunate city could barely claim
a measure of autonomy in the conduct
of its internal affairs.
The chief credit for the long and
successful expansion of the empire
naturally belongs to the Carthaginian
navy, which was heir to the seamanship
of the Phoenicians, and used it to
some purpose.
The Punic fleet consisted of heavy
vessels with rounded hulls, mainly
used as merchant shipping, and long,
narrow, fast galleys, easy to handle
when manoeuvring in face of an
enemy fleet.
Polybius describes these as being
"so constructed as to move in every
direction with the greatest of ease;
their oars were manned by experts . . .
If any of the vessels were hard-pressed
by the enemy, they fell back without
running any risk; it was easy for such
light craft to make for the open sea.
If the enemy advanced in pursuit, they
turned about, hovered around them or
approached them on the flank and
repeatedly rammed them . . ." Galleys
were used for the battle fleet; the
merchant vessels were usually less
manoeuvrable sailing craft.
T.
HE several thousand
vessels of the Carthaginian fleet were
built by skilful and experienced
craftsmen; the dockyards were among
the most celebrated in the ancient
world. The mariners had a profound
knowledge of the sea, and although
the compass was unknown to them,
steered with unerring sureness. In
wartime the State requisitioned mer¬
chant vessels, fully manned, to carry
troops and stores; in peacetime, the
naval vessels protected merchant
convoys from pirates, or guarded the
approaches to Carthage's exclusive
trading areas.
Carthage was heir to a long tradition
of seafaring and exploration. The
Phoenicians had distinguished them¬
selves by sailing round Africa, at the
behest of Nechao Pharaoh of the
26th dynasty. Setting out from the
Red Sea, they negotiated what is now
the Cape of Good Hope, and returned
to Egypt through the Straits of 1 9
Gibraltar (or "Pillars of Hercules"). lu
Little information can be gleaned
from Carthaginian sources except

THE ADVENTURES
OF HANNO
THE NAVIGATOR
Few records of voyages made by Phoenician and Car¬
thaginian navigators have survived. The most famous is
the Odyssey of Hanno the Navigator, King of Carthage,
who sailed beyond the Pillars of Hercules out into the
At/antic and down the west coast of Africa. The
narrative of this epic journey comes from a 3rd century
B.C. Greek translation of the Punic record of Hanno's
voyage engraved in the Temple of Chronos at Carthage.
Pliny's mention of the expedition as belonging to the
period "while the power of Carthage was at its height"
suggests, but does not prove, that it took place in the
5th century B.C. Below we publish the highly readable
adventure story of the Periplus of Hanno, as told by
the ancient navigator himself.
The routes shown on this map are more or less
hypothetical and based on the writings of Antiquity
and archaeological remains.

I HE Carthaginians decided that Hanno should go
past the Pillars of Hercules and found Carthaginian cities.
He set sail with sixty ships carrying thirty thousand men
and women with provisions and other necessities.
After passing the Pillars of Hercules and sailing for two
days beyond them we founded the first city, which was
named Thyrrsaterion. Around it was a large plain.
Next we went on in a westerly direction and arrived at
the Libyan promontory of Soloeis, which is covered with
trees; having set up a shrine to Poseidon, we set sail again
towards the rising sun for half a day, after which we arrived
at a lagoon close to the sea covered with many tall reeds.
Elephants and large numbers of other animals were feeding
on them. Leaving this lagoon and sailing for another day,
we founded the coastal cities named Carian Wall, Gytte,
Acra, Melitta and Arambys.
Leaving this place we arrived at the great river Lixos
which comes from Libya. On the banks nomads, the Lixites,
were feeding their flocks. We stayed for some time with
these people and made friends with them. Upstream from
them lived the unfriendly Ethiopians whose land is full of
wild beasts and broken up by high mountains where they
say the Lixos rises. They also say that about these
mountains dwell the strange-looking Troglodytes. The
Lixites claim that they can run faster than horses.
Taking Lixite interpreters with us we sailed alongside the
desert in a southerly direction for two days, then towards
the rising sun for one more day. We then found at the far
end of an inlet a little island five stades in circumference.
We named it Cerne and left settlers there. Judging by our
journey we reckoned that it must be opposite Carthage,
since we had to sail the same distance from Carthage to the
Pillars of Hercules as from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne.
From there, sailing up a big river named the Chretes, we
arrived at a lake in which there were three islands, all larger
than Cerne. Leaving these islands, we sailed for one day
and came to the end of the ¡ake, which was overshadowed
by high mountains full of savages dressed in animal skins
who threw stones at us and thus prevented us from landing.
From there we entered another river, which was broad and
14
GRANDEUR AND DECLINE (Continued)
about the two coasting voyages carried
out in the 5th century B.C. along the
Atlantic seaboard. An account of the
first voyage, under the command of
Hanno, has been handed down by the
Greeks. Its purpose was twofold:
first, to visit and reinforce the Punic
cities on the Moroccan coast, and
found new colonies; the second stage
appears to have been a voyage of
discovery, far along the shores of
western Africa (see story aoove).
The account of Hanno's voyage is an
endless source of speculation; many
attempts have been made, with little
success, to identify the places des¬
cribed. The most generally accepted
opinion is that the "Chariot of the
Gods" was Mount Cameroun, and that
the farthest point reached lay in the
Gulf of Guinea.
But some historians are inclined to
think the distance covered was much
shorter. The difficulties of identifica¬
tion have also given rise to the
suggestion that Hanno may himself
have enbroidered the truth, to avoid
giving away any precise information
about an itinerary which opened the
road to the gold trade.
Our knowledge of the second
voyage, under the command of Himilco,
is even more uncertain. We only
know that he explored the Atlantic
coast of western Europe in search of
silver and tin, and perhaps went as
far north as the British Isles.
The Carthaginians, those indefatiga¬
ble "sea hauliers", aimed to improve
their trade by these expeditions. They
long enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the
Atlantic traffic, which mainly led them
in two directions: first, to the shores
of tropical Africa and secondly to the
coasts of Europe, especially Brittany,
England and Ireland. Himilco and the
Carthaginian traders pressed on to
these far shores mainly in search of
silver and tin.
Yet Carthage had far more sustained
dealings with the Mediterranean
countries, especially with Greece.
Although trading relations were almost
completely broken off in the 5th

wide, full of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Then we
retraced our journey back to Cerne.
From there we sailed south along a coast entirely
inhabited by Ethiopians, who fled at our approach. Their
language was incomprehensible even to the Lixites, whom
we had with us. On the last day we disembarked by some
high mountains covered with trees with sweet-smelling
multicoloured wood. We sailed round these mountains for
two days and arrived in a huge bay on the other side of
which was a plain; there we saw fires breaking out at
intervals on all sides at night, both great and small.
Having renewed our water supplies, we continued our
voyage along the coast for five days, after which we arrived
at a huge inlet which the interpreters called the Horn of the
West. There was a big island in this gulf and in the island
was a lagoon with another island. Having disembarked
there, we could see nothing but forest by day; but at night
many fires were seen and we heard the sound of flutes
and the beating of drums and tambourines, which made
a great noise. We were struck with terror and our sooth¬
sayers bade us leave the island.
We left in haste and sailed along by a burning land full
of perfumes. Streams of fire rose from it and plunged into
the sea. The land was unapproachable because of the heat.
Terror-stricken, we hastened away. During four days'
sailing we saw at night that the land was covered with fire.
In the middle was a high flame, higher than the others, which
seemed to reach the stars. By day we realised that it was
a very high mountain, named the Chariot of the Gods.
Leaving this place, we sailed along the burning coast for
three days and came to the gulf named the Horn of the
South. At the end of it was an island like the first one,
with a lake in which was another island full of savages.
The greater part of these were women. They had hairy
bodies and the interpreters called them Gorillas.
We pursued some of the males but we could not catch
a single one because they were good climbers and they
defended themselves fiercely. However, we managed to
take three women. They bit and scratched their captors,
whom they did not want to follow. We killed them and
removed the skins to take back to Carthage. We sailed
no further, being short of supplies.
and 4th centuries B.C., they were
resumed more briskly than ever after
Alexander's victorious campaign. This
fact is attested by numerous Alexand¬
rian objects and Rhodian amphorae
found in Punic burial-grounds.
A steady trade was also carried on
with other areas such as Campania,
Etruria, Spain, Sicily, Delos. Carthage
exchanged raw materials, artefacts
and agricultural produce with these
countries.
The prosperity of Carthage mainly
rested on its trade; consequently the
State watched jealously over the
safety of the routes followed by its
ships, and surrounded the itineraries
to certain "trading preserves" with
mystery to confound their rivals.
As we have seen, Carthage some¬
times took diplomatic or military action
to protect the interests of its citizens,
and the Carthaginian seamen went to
great lengths to shake off pursuers,
or scare them off by spreading horrific
rumours about the sea roads leading
to certain areas where trade was in
effect a Punic monopoly.
A striking example of the vigilance
exercised is to be found in an anecdote
recorded in the classics; a Carthagin¬
ian vessel, tracked by Roman rivals
seeking to spy out Carthage's trading
preserves, was grounded by the cap¬
tain without hesitation, as he saw no
other way of shaking off his persistent
followers. In doing so, he lured the
Roman ship on to the sandbank.
Thus, the Carthaginian Empire, with
its many colonies scattered around the
western Mediterranean and on the
shores of the Atlantic, exercised a
strong influence on events in the
ancient world. The Punic cities of
North Africa and elsewhere were
centres of fruitful contact and exchange
with the different Mediterranean
cultures. The Carthaginian merchant,
a familiar figure in towns of the east
and west alike, made his own contri¬
bution to this interchange.
Carthage, the great metropolis of
antiquity, nurtured on Oriental, African
and Mediterranean traditions, was a

powerful civilizing force in the ancient
world. Its contribution, long under¬
estimated, is beginning to be better
appreciated, thanks to the widespread
development of archaeological excava¬
tion and historical research.
In 146 B.C., the Roman general
Scipio Aemilianus, allotted the task of
destroying Carthage, it would appear,
unwillingly, could not restrain his tears.
He recited aloud the well-known lines
of Homer: "A day will come when Ilium,
the sacred city, will perish; when Priam
and the subjects of Priam, skilful in
handling the spear, will perish . . ."
He must have been equally distressed
by the tragic spectacle of the burning
city and by the disappearance of a
great and influential metropolis.
Few vestiges of Carthage escaped
the destructive fury of its enemies.
Today they adorn a peaceful residential
district, greatly appreciated for its
tranquillity and the subtle charm which
surrounds it. The site is one of the
most beautiful in the world, located on
a promontory at the far end of the
Gulf of Tunis, with white houses set
in vast gardens stretching towards
the sea.
At the foot of the promontory are
remnants of the Punic ports with their
two harbours, one enclosing an islet
which seems to have held the Admiralty
buildings. Here one of the greatest
fleets of the ancient world rode at
anchor; here was the starting point
for the intrepid Punic navigators and
empire builders.
The ports are silted up, and now
give only a remote and hazy idea of
their historical importance. If they and
the other remains of Carthage were
worthily restored, this shrine of history
might regain a semblance of its former
glory.

CARTHAGINIAN CIVILIZATION (Continued)
The legendary voyage of Princess Elissa
of diverse origins and civilizations,
with Iberians and with Celts. Its
destruction was not the outcome of a
century-old crusade; it was a purely
political event in which racial or
cultural hatreds played no part.
Contrary to what happened in
16th century Spain, the destruction of
Carthage was not followed by a
systematic uprooting of its civilization;
Punic culture died out slowly and
without violence, merging gradually
with that of Rome.
T

HE very special role that
Carthage was to play had clearly not
been foreseen by its founders. It re¬
sulted from a historical evolution ex¬
tending over at least six centuries in
the course of which the very basis of
the city's existence underwent several
fundamental transformations.
During the first phase, of which
very little is known, Carthage appears
to have been no more than one of
many Phoenician trading-posts scatter¬
ed along the tin route. The invention
of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin,
had forced the men of the second
millenium B.C. to establish trading
links that were astonishingly far-
ranging considering their limited means
of communications.
Copper was to be found in fairly
large quantities in the countries of
western Asia which, with Egypt, were
then the centres of Mediterranean
civilization. But there was virtually
no tin in the countries bordering the
eastern Mediterranean. It was mined
in western and north-western Europe,
in Spain, in Brittany and the British
Isles. In these regions bordering the
Atlantic had grown up the far-famed,
mysterious Megalithic civilization
which maintained trading and even
cultural ties with peoples of the East.
The chief point of contact was
situated in the kingdom of Tartessos,
(present-day Andalusia,) whose mineral
wealth was still a source of wonder to
the Greeks of the 6th century B.C.
There the traders met, some having
come from the north along the coasts,
others having travelled from the
Aegean and from Asia.
At the end of the second millenium
B.C., this trade, long controlled by the
Mycenaeans, was taken over by the
Phoenicians. They began to establish
small trading settlements at their
regular stopping places.
The dates of the establishment of
the chief settlements have been
handed down by tradition.
Surprisingly enough, the most
remote, Gadès, present-day Cadiz,
was reputedly the most ancient, being
founded in about 1200 B.C. Utica, on
the northern coast of. Tunisia near the
mouth of the Medjerda, was a close
contemporary (1178 B.C.), while Car¬
thage appeared later, in 814 B.C.
Unfortunately, these dates have not
been confirmed by modern archaeo¬
logical research. Whereas the objects
discovered on the sites of the Greek
colonies can be dated to about the
time the Greeks were traditionally said
to have established their settlements,
those unearthed at the sites of
Phoenician towns are clearly of a later
origin than the date of founding given
by texts.
At Carthage, for example, leading
specialists have dated the oldest
ceramics found in sanctuaries and
tombs to around 750 B.C. at the ear¬
liest more than sixty years after the
date given by the writers of antiquity
for the arrival in Africa of Dido (the
Phoenician princess Elissa, reputed
founder of Carthage). In the case of
Utica and Gadès the gap is wider
still, amounting to three or four cen¬
turies at least.
This conflict in dates raises a thorny
problem which has long been debated
by archaeologists and to which no
satisfactory solution has as yet been
found. Are the texts incorrect?
Should more exhaustive archaeological
explorations be made? Should the dat¬
ing of the "fossil remains" be
revised? In all honesty it must be
admitted that the issue remains prob¬
lematical.
Fragmentary information has been
handed down by a literary tradition of
dubious worth, in which ancient reli¬
gious myths, rationalized to some
extent, inventions of writers and possi¬
bly a few authentic historical facts are
inextricably entwined. It suggests
that Carthage, unlike other settlements,
was not founded for primarily eco¬
nomic reasons. It appears to have
been established by a banished prin¬
cess as a refuge for political exiles.
But according to the same "Dido
myth", the colonists' resources failed
to match the scale of their ambitions.
Much hard bargaining seems to have
taken place before the Libyans would
concede them sufficient space to
establish the "new town" the
meaning of the Phoenician words
"Qart Hadasht", deformed by the
Romans into "Carthage" and this only
on payment of a tribute.
In fact, the few archaeological re¬
mains recovered from diggings in the
sanctuaries and tombs of the first
Carthage of the 7th and 8th centuries
B.C., give no indication that the settle¬
ment could act as an independent
state, let alone as an imperial power.
Its economy remained dependent
upon the parent city, although beautiful
jewellery and fine ivory carvings bear
witness to a fairly high standard of
living. Geographical factors, however,
gave Carthage greater opportunities
for expansion than the other Phoeni¬
cian colonies. The latter were
generally established on small islands
near the coast or at the extremities of
rocky promontories, sites which gua¬
ranteed their security but not their
livelihood which continued to depend
almost exclusively upon the sea.
Carthage, however, had been built
on the eastern shore of a peninsula
whose "head" embraced an area of
about twenty square kilometres of
small, fertile, well-watered plains on
either side of a curving chain of hills.
Control of the sandy isthmus linking it
to the mainland between the Lake of
Tunis and the Ariana lagoon was all
that was required for full command
over this little, self-sufficient world.
Although no precise date is known,
it seems likely that the Carthaginians
achieved this essential control fairly
quickly, thus acquiring liberty of action
vis-à-vis both the local population and
their parent city.
This explains how Carthage was
able to take over the role played by
Tyre when, weakened by its unending
struggle against the kings of Assyria
and Babylon, it was no longer strong
enough to protect the Phoenicians of
the west effectively against the grow¬
ing pressure of Greek competition,
then making itself felt on all sides.
Tyre itself had taken advantage of
the collapse of Mycenaean power, des¬
troyed around 1200 B.C. by the Dorian
invasion, to build its maritime empire.
But the poets kept alive among the
Greeks, throughout their centuries-
long "Middle Ages", the memory of
the bold maritime exploits of their
heroes.
I
N about 800 B.C., the
Achaeans, the Euboeans, the men of
Rhodes, soon followed by the Corin¬
thians and the lonians of Anatolia, had
undertaken the re-discovery and the
re-occupation of the ports of call once
visited by Ulysses and the Argonauts.
At first they were content to settle on
shores that the Phoenicians had recon¬
noitred without establishing firm
bases: the coasts of Cyrenaica, of
southern Italy and, above all, Sicily.
But large scale emigration soon
caused these colonies to be cramped
for space and newcomers were forced
to move farther and farther on to
the coasts of Gaul, where Marseilles
was founded in 600 B.C., to Catalonia
and farther south on the Spanish coast
towards the kingdom of Tartessos with
its fabulous riches. Friction grew at
all the points of contact between the
Greek and Phoenician possessions
the Gulf of Syrte, western Sicily, Cor¬
sica the Iberian Levant leading to
limited but repeated conflicts.

### 56995: Eight centuries of Carthaginian civilization
This striking bronze bust of Hannibal, the great Carthaginian
general and statesman (247-183 B.C.) was discovered in 1944
in the Roman ruins of Volubilis, north of Meknès, Morocco.
Hannibal's portrait has also come down to us on coins struck between
221 and 219 B.C., and two marble busts of him
have been identified. When the Second Punic War
with Rome broke out in 218 B.C., Hannibal and his army crossed
the Alps and Invaded the Italian peninsula. After winning numerous
victories, he was called home to Carthage where he was finally
defeated by the Roman general Scipio at Zama in 202 B.C.
To hold their own, the Phoenicians
of the west had to unite, to create a
military force and seek alliances with
peoples who, like themselves, were
threatened by Hellenic imperialism.
This involved a complete revision of a
traditional trading policy which, apart
from a few piratical raids, had been
largely pacific. The transformation
was undertaken under the guidance of
the first of the Carthaginian political
leaders of whose personality history
has some notion king Mago, who
reigned from about 550 to 530 B.C.
Mago created an army consisting
essentially of mercenaries the Car¬
thaginians themselves were too few in
number to do more than man an élite
regiment and provide officers backed
up by a large and well-trained fleet.
He set out to gain control of bases at
carefully selected points which would
be entirely dependent, both politically
and militarily, upon Carthage.
One of these bases had long been
established (in 654 B.C. according to
tradition) at Ibiza in the Balearics.
Mago established others, at Motya on
the western tip of Sicily, and espe¬
cially in Sardinia where Phoenician
colonists had gained a foothold as
early as the 9th century B.C.
In the diplomatic field he strengthen¬
ed the existing treaty with the Etrus¬
cans. This people, perhaps originally
from Asia Minor, and at any rate
strongly influenced by oriental trad¬
ition, were themselves disturbed by the
Greek incursion. The first result of
this collaboration between the Etrus¬
cans and the Carthaginians was to
deny the Greeks of Phocaea, in Asia
Minor, a foothold in Corsica.
Mago's actions also had important
repercussions on internal political and
cultural affairs. Very little is known
of the nature of the government of Car¬
thage at this period. The head of state
was a king with essentially religious
powers perhaps, yet among a people
whose gods dominated every aspect
of their lives, these powers were con¬
siderable. But the king had to pay
regard to the aristocracy, and the
assembly of citizens could be called
upon to decide any dispute arising
between these two authorities. Hav¬
ing become the military as well as the
spiritual leader, the king gained in¬
creased power.
Without in principle being hereditary
or even held for life, the kingship was
in practice reserved for the members of
a single family, and during this period
there was no instance of any holder of
the office being deposed during his
lifetime. Mago and his successors had,
in effect, managed to surround their
power with a mystic aura by skilfully
playing upon nationalism and religious
fanaticism.
Carthage had inherited from Tyre a
religion which was a mixture of often
uncivilized and bloody naturalistic rites,
designed to ensure the fruitfulness of
nature, and the highly refined theolo¬
gical speculations of a learned and
intelligent priesthood. The priests

from different towns and temples form¬
ed schools which held widely varying
views as to the powers and the rela¬
tionships between the gods of an ela¬
borate pantheon.
Thus the theologians of Tyre stres¬
sed the importance of the city's patron
god Melqart, a vigorous and much
travelled deity whom the Greeks saw
as the counterpart of Herakles.
Other sects, however, worshipped
transcendental divinities such as El,
the king and father of all gods. The
majority of the priests of Carthage
tended to follow the latter belief.
Although Melqart was honoured in
Dido's city, the god El held pride of
place. In keeping with a custom
common among Semitic peoples, the
god's real name, too charged with
sacred power, was not spoken. In¬
stead the name Ba'al Hammon, mean¬
ing "Lord of the Furnace", was used,
according to an interpretation by the
French scholar James G. Février.
This name recalls that Ba'al Hammon
presided over the sacrifices which have
cloaked the name of Carthage with a
sinister reputation. In his honour
young children, their throats having
probably first been cut, were thrown
into a furnace at the foot of his statue.
The efficacy of a sacrifice being in
direct proportion to the victim's worth,
it is not to be wondered at that all
ancient peoples, from the Greeks and
Romans onwards, should have practis¬
ed human sacrifice.
Indeed, many peoples had a ritual
which consisted in the king, whose
function it was to link the human with
the supernatural world, being put to
death when his powers began to fail
him. In this way this energy could
pass on to a successor.
The Phoenicians in general and the
Carthaginians in particular were not,
therefore, alone in the practice of hu¬
man sacrifice and the immolation of
their kings. But at Carthage these
practices long remained widespread
whereas among other nations, except
among the Gauls who practised human
sacrifice for so long as they remain¬
ed independent, they became rare and
virtually died out. Moreover, the sacri¬
fice of adults was avoided by substitut¬
ing as victims their infant children.
The ashes of the victims were buried
in holy precincts known as tophets,
and stone monuments were erected
commemorating the sacrifice. The dis¬
covery of these tophets at Carthage
itself, in the port area today called Sal¬
ammbô, and in all the other Punic cities
of Africa and Sardinia, leaves no doubt
that such holocausts did take place
and that they continued up to the fall
of Carthage, though towards the end
the priests would sometimes accept
a sacrificial lamb in place of a child.
The Magonid period, which extends
from the middle of the 6th to the be¬
ginning of the 4th century B.C. marks
the apogee of the Ba'al Hammon cult.

HILO of Byblos, a Greek
historian of the 2nd century A.D., tells
us the legend of the first Phoenician
seafarer.
Caught in a forest fire, Usos stripp¬
ed a tree of its branches, straddled
the trunk and pushed off into the sea
to escape the flames. This was the
first Phoenician venture into Mediterra¬
nean waters.
The Iliad, the Odyssey, the Torah,
the Tablets of Ugarit and many other
equally famous writings have pre¬
served for us a record of the Phoen¬
ician navigators, their remarkable
voyages and the riches they gained
from their trading ventures, particularly
in the country known as Tarshish,
located, in all probability, in southern
Spain.
Tarshish, with its plentiful supplies of
copper, silver, lead and tin became the

goal of Phoenician maritime expedi¬
tions from Tyre and Sidon. Describ¬
ing its vast mineral wealth, the Greek
historian Diodorus Siculus writes:
"The country of the Iberians has the
most plentiful and the richest silver
mines that are known. The Iberians
were ignorant of the value of silver,
and the Phoenician traders were able
to buy it in exchange for a very small
quantity of merchandise; they took it to
Greece, Asia and other countries, and
thus amassed great wealth. This
trade, which they plied for many years,
brought them power and enabled them
to establish numerous colonies in
Sicily and the neighbouring islands, in
Libya, Sardinia and Iberia."
On their voyages westward to Tars¬
hish, the Phoenicians became familiar
with the North African coastline. Soon
they set up small trading stations
where their ships could put in to rest
the crews and take on supplies. Car¬
thage was undoubtedly the largest and
most important of these Phoenician
outposts in the west. A legend that
appears to explain the reasons and
events that led to its foundation is
recorded by the writers of Antiquity.
According to this version, Carthage
was founded by Elissa, sister of Pyg¬
malion, King of Tyre, who was married
to Acerbas, the high-priest of Melqart.
Acerbas was murdered by Pygmalion
who coveted his wealth. The grief-
stricken princess decided to flee from
Tyre, and with skill and diplomacy

The finely -engraved decoration on this
sacred razor, with its handle in the form
of the head and neck of a bird,
shows the Egyptian influence that
affected Punic art. The Carthaginians
inherited a long tradition of

and jewellers flourished in Carthage.

succeeded in deceiving her brother
and lulling his suspicions. Accompa¬
nied by a group of Tyrian nobles, she
went to Cyprus where she was wel¬
comed by the high-priest of Jupiter.
She and her followers then sailed for
Africa and disembarked at the site of
the future Carthage.
It would be difficult to accept this as
an authentic record but the facts it
relates fit to some extent into the pic¬
ture of the Phoenician world, and thus
may shed some light on the history of
Carthage and the Carthaginian civili¬
zation.
The date most commonly accepted
for the foundation of Carthage is 814
B.C. But some historians believe that
this is too early: archaeological
remains recovered from excavations at
Carthage do not appear to be older
than the 7th century B.C., which far
from confirms the ancient texts.
Yet can we be sure that we have
reached the oldest level of the city?
Who knows what surprises may await
us during future excavations! Per¬
haps we shall find remains even more
ancient than the terracotta vases
unearthed in the little "Cintas Chapel".
These are in the sub-geometric style
of the Cyclades and cannot be older
than 750 B.C.
T
HE archaeologist, as we
know, needs to be patient, scrupulous
and cautious. The historian, for his
part, should not regard data on far-off
times handed down by tradition as
infallible, nor should he systematically
distrust them. Archaeology often
confirms the writings of the Ancients.
Indeed, in the case of Carthage,
archaeological studies and literary
tradition can perhaps be reconciled.
The Phoenicians, in 814 B.C., may
have founded a small outpost similar
to the many others they established
along both shores of the Mediter¬
ranean, where they replenished their
stores and perhaps traded with the
local population. But their principal
objective seems to have been the
mineral wealth of Tarshish.
In the 8th century B.C., two dangers
threatened the seafarers of Tyre.
This was the period of expanding
Greek colonization in the western
Mediterranean. In 750 B.C. Greek
colonists founded Cumae in the Bay of
Naples, through which was sent the
copper ore from the mines of Etruria
and Campania. Seventeen years later,
the Greeks founded Syracuse. The
Phoenicians must have realized the
danger from these new Greek settle¬
ments which threatened their shipp¬
ing and trade routes. Something had
to be done to check and contain the
Greek expansion.
The second danger to the Phoenician
merchants came from Assyria. The
wealth of the Tyrian cities quickly
roused the greed and envy of the
Assyrian rulers. Assurnasirpal II
(883-856 B.C.) speaks of "the tribute
of the kings of the sea coasts the
country of the Tyrians, the country
of the Sidonians, the country of the
Gibilites. . . and the town of Arvas in
the midst of the sea. . .silver, gold,
lead, bronze, vases of bronze, gar¬
ments of many colours, linen tunics. . .
I received their tribute and they kissed
my feet. . ."
The Assyrian greed was insatiable
and the Phoenicians lived in fear of
seeing their wealth seized by these
powerful and unscrupulous overlords.
A Phoenician colony in the western
Mediterranean, they felt, would check
Greek expansion and also provide
shelter from the Assyrian danger.
Such considerations probably explain
the spectacular rise of the "new town"
in the middle of the eighth century B.C.
At all events, the foundation of
Carthage is an established fact, so let
us see what is known about it by ex¬
amining sources that throw some light
on Carthage, its history and culture.
Firstly, what can we learn from the
writers of Antiquity? The Greeks and
the Romans were both well acquainted
with Carthage and its people. They
met as enemies on the battlefield and
as rival traders in the ports of the
Mediterranean, which has seen the rise
and fall of so many civilizations. It
would take too long to enumerate here
all the classical writers who tell us
about Carthage, but we may quote a
few of them.
There is, for instance, the famous
passage in Herodotus, which describes
the trading ritual used by Carthaginian
merchants seeking gold in Africa.
"The Carthaginians spread out their
merchandise on the beach," writes the
Father of History, "return to their
ships and make smoke to attract the
Negroes. The Negroes come down to
the sea, place their gold beside the
merchandise and withdraw. The Car¬
thaginians then return and if they find
## [Page 31](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/056988engo.pdf#page=31) 0
### 57009: Carthage through the eyes of Greece and Rome
a sufficient quantity of gold, they take
it. If not, they return to their ships
and wait, and in this case the Negroes
add more gold until the traders are
satisfied. They do each other no
wrong: the Carthaginians do not touch
the gold until the quantity seems to
correspond to the value of their wares;
the Negroes do not touch the goods
until the traders have taken the gold."
Another Greek historian, Polybius of
Megalopolis, wrote a great deal about
Carthage. He watched the army of
Scipio destroy the city of Elissa, and
as an observer of the Third Punic
War he had a special interest in the
relations between Rome and Carthage.
Two treaties were signed between
these 0ueens of tne Mediterranean,
and Polybius records their dates and
terms. To the same historian we owe
the story of Hannibal's oath at the
time of his alliance with Philip of
Macedonia.
D
IODORUS SICULUS is an¬
other historian who should be mention¬
ed. He was born in Sicily and de¬
scribes the wars between the Greeks
and the Carthaginians for the conquest
of the island.
From his pen comes an account of
human sacrifices, a practice that was
known among all Canaanites. Caught
unprepared by the invasion and
shattering victories of Agathocles
(310 B.C.), says Diodorus, writing in
the Ist century B.C., "the Carthaginians
hastened to repair their errors and
decreed the public sacrifice of 200
children from noble families. Some
citizens facing accusations voluntarily
offered their own children, numbering
no fewer than 300."
Of the Roman historians, three in
particular come to mind: Livy, who
wrote a vivid account of the Second
Punic War, with a striking pen-portrait
of Hannibal; Sallust, whose "Bellum
Jugurthinum" tells of the Phoenicians
and the Carthaginians; and Justin,
whose story of the fabulous adventure
of the Tyrian princess Elissa has
already been quoted.
Greek and Latin literature thus
abounds in references to Carthage.
But the history of Carthage was not
the primary concern of the classical
authors; they were obliged to deal
with it because it was an integral part
of the events they described, namely
the Greek and Roman wars against
Carthage.
Classical sources thus give us a
portrait of Carthage painted by her
enemies, and what they wrote should
be interpreted with the greatest
caution. This is not to say that we
should be systematically sceptical;
objectivity, in any case, is a very
modern concept for the historian. But
as they failed to understand certain
aspects of Punic civilization, the
ancient historians may give us a
distorted picture.
The ¡deal, of course, would be to
have the viewpoint of the Phoenicians
themselves, but most of Punic
literature Is lost. The Library of Car¬
thage was famous and was referred
to by classical writers, some of whom
appear to have consulted Punic works;
Sallust, Servius and Festus Avenius,
to name three, refer to Punic books
(libri Punici) and the Punic records.
According to Pliny the Elder, the
library was handed over to the Numid-
ian princes and disappeared without
trace. Only fragments of some very
famous Punic writings were saved,
such as the agricultural treatise of
Mago. "Our Senate," says Pliny,
"did him great honour. After the fall
of Carthage, it presented the libraries
of the city to the African princes; but
it decreed that exceptionally the
28 books of Mago would be translated
into Latin, although Cato had already
written a similar treatise. The task was
entrusted to persons familiar with the
Punic tongue, the principal translator
being D. Silanus, of noble birth."
The north African climate is
probably to blame to a large extent
for the disappearance of the Punic
manuscripts; the humidity of Tunisia
does not favour the preservation of
papyrus.
But there is a Semitic source which
can help us to trace some elements
of Punic civilization, namely the Torah.
Carthage was the daughter of Tyre
and Tyre seems to have had a
profound influence on the history and
civilization of the Beni Israel.
The Book of Kings tells us of Hiram,
King of Tyre, and Solomon, son of
David, King of Israel. We read in
Chapter V: "And Hiram king of Tyre
sent his servants unto Solomon; for
he had heard that they had anointed
him king in the room of his father;
for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
Thou knowest how that David my
father could not build an house unto
the name of the Lord his God for the
wars which were about him on every
side, until the Lord put them under
the soles of his feet. But now the Lord
my God hath given me rest on every
side, so that there is neither adversary
nor evil occurrent. And, behold, I

We owe to the Phoenicians, some

revolutionary achievements in the
history of human civilization: the
invention of an alphabet of 22 signs.
Table above shows how 15 Phoenician
alphabetic signs evolved down the

name of the Lord my God. . . Now
therefore command thou that they hew
me cedar trees out of Lebanon. . ."
The Bible contains many references
to Phoenician civilization which un¬
doubtedly help us to penetrate into
the world of Carthage.
But literary sources are quite in¬
adequate to answer all the questions
about Carthage. We have to seek
elsewhere, and turn naturally to the
archaeologists.
At the end of the Third Punic War,
the Roman Senate decreed the des¬
truction of Carthage and the order was
carried out by the army of Scipio
Aemilianus in 146 B.C. After their
pillaging and destruction, the Roman
soldiers ploughed salt into the soil of
Carthage to destroy all fertility and all
growth.
But for the archaeologist a much
greater calamity was the later decision
of the Senate to rebuild. The first
attempt was made in the second
century B.C. when the Senate ratified
the Lex Rubria founding a "colonia
Junonia Carthago", which was to have
6,000 colonists. This was a false
start a year later the Lex Minucia
repealed the previous law as a series
of unfavourable circumstances had
made them drop the project.
Under the Caesars, however par¬
ticularly Augustus a complete Roman
town was built on the site of the
ancient colony of Tyre. This was the
real disaster for Punic archaeology.
Whatever had escaped the ravagers
was demolished by the builders. La¬
bourers, surveyors and architects all
contributed to the final destruction of
the ruins of the great city. Materials
from Punic buildings were used in the
first Roman constructions, which were
to disappear in turn in the fire that
ravaged Carthage in the second
century.
A few fragments survive. . . Excava¬
tions in a villa of the late Roman
period on the road from the sea to
La Malga revealed a fine Punic
inscription unfortunately incomplete.
About one-third is missing, so that it
is difficult to read and understand the
text. But this in no way detracts from
the exceptional value of the find.
These are the sort of difficulties
with which archaeologists have to
contend when seeking Punic remains.
In 1857 Flaubert visited the site,
seeking traces of the principal monu¬
ments palace walls, temples, etc.
but was bitterly disappointed. Other
archaeologists have followed each
other to Carthage and have discovered
very fine Roman monuments but
where is Punic Carthage?
O
N April 7, 1878, Father
Alfred Delattre discovered the necro¬
polis of Carthage. The tombs contain¬
ed rich funerary objects ceramics,
jewels, amulets, masks, etc. In some,
incriptions were found. Historians
stress the inadequacy of such data,
not without reason. "But we must
not claim," writes the French archaeo¬
logist, Stéphane Gsell, "to reconstruct
the economic history [of Carthage]
solely from the pottery buried in these
tombs."
Pottery is nevertheless of great
value, even when reduced to mere
shards, which were ignored in the days
of such 19th century historians as
Ernest Renan. "And yet," writes the
French orientalist, Georges Contenau,
"these humble shards buried in the
ruins often tell us the precise dates
of the monuments where they are
found."
Burial furnishings, of course, bear
witness to belief in life after death.
The Carthaginians, like most ancient
peoples, placed beside the body or
human ashes, ceramics, pitchers,
dishes, bowls, lamps, gems, earrings,
rings, buckles, etc. Women's tombs
often contain necklaces and bronze
mirrors, but unfortunately with no
ornamentation.
Traces of two small chapels have
been found, one at Salammbô and the
other near Amilcar. Although not
extensive, these remains, together
with the plentiful material (stelae, urns,
etc.) found in the sanctuary, give us
some insight into the Carthaginian
religion.
Domestic architecture is less well
known. Some ancient writers speak
of houses with several storeys in the
Punic capital. Recent excavations in
the Byrsa hillside and on the shore
at Gammarth have revealed traces of
Carthaginian dwellings similar to those
we have explored at Kerkouane, the
famous Punic site on the Cap Bon
peninsula.
And so with the aid of these literary,
archaeological and epigraphic sources
the historian seeks to reconstruct the
Carthaginian past.

### 57009: Carthage through the eyes of Greece and Rome
MAGIC SQUARE
Seven times seven motifs figure on this tiny Carthaginian
tablet (4 cm. square) discovered in a tomb, and dating
from the 3-4th century B.C. Made of limestone paste
coated with green enamel, it is divided into
49 squares, with the same motif repeated seven times
on each row. These are (from top): Ptah (Egyptian
artisan god assimilated by Carthage); fish; Bes
(Egyptian god of recreation, wearing a crown of feathers,
also adopted by Carthage); water lily; frog; antelope,
crocodile. Belief in the magic properties of the figure
seven and its absolute multiple symbols of harmony
is affirmed in the religions and theologies of many
ancient peoples. Like the Punic masks, the square
may have served as a talisman or amulet to protect the
dead. A unique relic, it is now in the Carthage museum. 'V*-
TANIT THE MYSTERIOUS
Below, the sanctuary of Tanit (4-5th century B.C.) at
Salammbô, Carthage. The chief female deity of
Carthage, Tanit is sometimes named "Oum" (the mother)
but her origins are mysterious. She did not belong
to the Phoenician pantheon, but may have been an
African deity or foreign goddess assimilated by the
Carthaginians. She became the Punic "Mother-goddess"
"She who gives". The stone carving in the
foreground is a model of a temple, reduced to a
flight of steps leading to an altar. The stele immediately
behind is engraved with the "bottle sign" which
is associated with Tanit. The goddess herself is
always depicted in abstract form (see pages 5 and 40).
Below right, a minor female deity and guardian of the
sanctuary of Tanit, with lion's head and costume
imitating a bird's plumage (1st century B.C.). The deity
figures on Roman coins of the time on which she is
described as "Spirit of the Lands of Africa".

by Georges Fradier
TUNIS-A JEWEL
OF ISLAM
T
VWENTY- EIGHT centuries
of civilization standing layer upon layer
and covering an area of barely
60 square miles: a site Carthage ; a
city Tunis.
Carthage is a name that has fasci¬
nated the great of literature from Vir¬
gil to Flaubert, and which can be con¬
jured up by a few brief images: the
genius of Hannibal with his Numidians
from northern Africa, Jiis Gauls and his
elephants, his "immortal" yet short¬
lived victories. Then the Romans in
Africa; the aging Cato "Delenda est
Carthago" (Carthage must be destroy¬
ed). In 146 B.C. it was well and truly
destroyed, its remains razed to the
ground and its site declared accursed.
But economic necessity, it seems, is
more powerful than a conqueror's cur¬
ses. The Roman colony of Carthago,
founded on the ancient site in 44 B.C.,
took less than a century to become a
large and powerful city of 300,000 in¬
habitants, dealing, like its predecessor,
in oil, wine and purple and importing
Greek statuary.
The new Carthage was built with the
Roman town-planner's geometric pat¬
tern of streets, with aqueducts and
forum, apartment buildings and villas,
and complete with circus, theatre,
odeon, temples and baths the famous
Antonine Baths which were the most
luxurious in the world outside Rome.
This was truly a city to dream of for
the Italian merchants and their Punic
counterparts, for the orators and scho¬
lars, the bishops and generals of the
Roman colony and later for the Van¬
dal chieftains with their own retinues
of orators and bishops; and later still
for the Byzantine admirals.

### 57013: Tunis; a jewel of Islam
TUNIS (Continued)
Birth of a capital
at the Mosque of the Olive Tree
Carthage was a city dreamed over,
renewed and remodelled during the
course of seven centuries. When the
city was captured by Hassan Ibn
Noman in 698 A.D., still arrogant and
still confident in its power, Pompeii by
then had slept so long in its bed of
lava that it had been forgotten.
Carthage, less fortunate than Pom¬
peii, had no volcano to wrap it in a
winding-sheet to await the century of
enlightenment and the scholars and
students of antiquity. Like London,
Treves, Lyon, Nîmes, like Rome it¬
self, it became little more than a
quarry. But the quarrymen who fil¬
ched its stones, unlike those who
demolished the monuments of these
European cities, built nothing upon the
sites of its abandoned temples.
Hassan and his successors used its
stones to build elsewhere as far away
as Kairouan. Not just for one year,
nor even ten, but throughout thirteen
centuries they took pillars and capitals
for the mosques, palaces and souks,
statues to feed the lime-kilns, sarco¬
phagi to pave the streets. None of
this was done maliciously life must
go on, and this is how each wave of
civilization builds upon its predeces¬
sors. However, some monuments
were still standing, at times providing
shelter to enemy forces. In 1270, fol¬
lowing the crusade led by Saint Louis,
the sultan, El Mostaneir, gave the order
to destroy the last remains.
Y

ET the traveller who wand¬
ers along a coast not yet seriously
disfigured, climbs the partly-defaced
hills and threads his way between the
villas and their tiny gardens still
comes face to face with the old
Carthage. For here and there a few
columns still point to the skies, marble
and mosaics peep out from the grass,
and overthrown buildings, whose buri¬
ed walls lie flush to the ground, seem
to thrust upwards, piercing through
sand and rubble, a bleak reminder of
the once orderly plan of the ancient
city.
The hill of Byrsa, on which stood the
fortress-sanctuary, last refuge of the
Punic gods and their defenders, has
never been explored. The bare spa¬
ces, still awaiting excavation, cover
more than 370 hectares (900 acres).
Like a newly deciphered language,
ancient Carthage could be re-discover¬
ed, restored to life, given new mean¬
ing and depth. But first, those who
love Carthage and who are responsible
for the city will need the means and
determination to resist the invasion of
the villa constructors before it is too
late, before the population squeeze and
housing boom have covered every¬
thing with a thick coat of plaster.
They will need the help of administra¬
tive and legal measures no less than
financial resources. But once they have
the legal powers, there is little doubt
that the funds they need will be forth¬
coming.
It may seem strange that an article
dealing with cultural rescue should be
concerned with both an ancient, anni¬
hilated city and a strongly flourishing,
exuberant capital. Carthage finally
perished in giving birth to Tunis, but
the heart of Tunis is threatened by a
superabundance of life. Only cities
whom history has passed by escape
this paradoxical fate. But Tunis sim¬
mers with history in the making. The
administrative, industrial, commercial
and tourist centre of a country of five
million inhabitants, Tunis js
ing a period of great expansion and,
as we say of teenagers, is suffering
from growing pains.
I
IN 1925, Tunis had a popu¬
lation of 186,000in 1966, 470,000.
But for some years now the directors
of the urban development plan have
been aware that it would be pointless
to consider the city alone without plan¬
ning for the surrounding communities
of the residential suburb near the sea.
Four years ago this "Greater Tunis"
had a population of nearly 800,000 and
by the end of the century it is esti¬
mated that it will have risen to two
million.
Yet these figures fail to tell the
whole story. Although they indicate
a rate of growth that to some must
appear colossal, they reveal nothing of
the fundamental aspects of this urban
growth. Yet even a brief outline of
the history of the city provides a
glimpse of these aspects. It gives us
an idea of the pressures and impera¬
tives, the interplay of poverty and
development, the dangers of routine
solutions and the horizons that can be
opened up by clear-sighted decisions.
At the foot of a small hillock, on a
narrow strip of land between a marsh
and the big lake which separates it
from the sea, lay a small village as old
as time. It was this country market¬
place and caravan crossroads that Has¬
san and his successors chose first as
the setting for the Djama Zitouna, or
mosque of the olive-tree, and then as
the site of a town.
From this great house of prayer a
river of brick and stone spread out
to the north, the south, the west and
the south-west, spawning market
streets, great men's houses, hostel-
ries, cisterns, wells, warehouses, work¬
shops, schools, sepulchres, gardens.
Two suburbs, protected by ramparts
linked to the fortress that soon came
to overshadow the great mosque,
offered a welcome to caravans and
farmers.
The domes and square minarets
(later to be replaced by fine octago¬
nal towers) of other mosques reared
their heads to the sky. The bright
terraces of the closely-huddled hou¬
ses looked out to sea or over the
sacred hills, shielding the patios of
these vast, secretive dwellings which,
from century to century, retained the
inward-looking Roman style as adapted
by Moslem Egypt.
The history of Tunis, as one disco¬
vers with relief, is less a saga of gen¬
erals, of messianic dictators, of sheiks,
deys and beys, than a fairy tale for
architects. It is the history of the slow
growth of a hive, the patient multipli¬
cation of honeycomb cells, inter¬
mingled and interdependent like the
cells of a living organism. There were,
of course, enough party rivalries, sie¬
ges, brawls and free-for-alls to satisfy
connoisseurs of old style drama, if
any still exist. But the impression
remains that the real history of Tunis,
of the Medina of Tunis, wisely placed
in the hands of the builders and confin¬
ed to the 760 acres within its walls,
unfolded over eleven hundred years
quite apart from these colourful but
trivial occurrences.
It is true that this capital of theolo¬
gians, jurists, craftsmen and mer¬
chants, peaceful by inclination and by
repute, did not entirely escape the
hand of violence. In about 1050 came
the invasion of the Beni Hilal Bedouins,
let loose, according to the historian Ibn
Khaldoun, like a swarm of voracious

PLEASURES
OF THE CHASE
Hunting is a recurring theme in
Carthaginian mosaics of the Roman
period. In the 2nd century A.D.,
influenced by emperor Hadrian's passion
for hunting wild beasts, the sport
became the favourite pastime of the
Roman aristocracy. Above right,

5th century Carthaginian mosaic. Below

mosaic baptismal font decorated with
hunting scenes. Dedicated to Saint
Cyprian, one of the fathers of the

had been taken up by the Christians
of Carthage.

three centuries later came the occupa¬
tion by the Merinids, another nomadic
tribe, this time from Algeria.
Then, in 1534, followed Khairad-Din
Barbarossa's Turkish soldiers, syste¬
matic pillagers like Charles V's Spa¬
nish soldiery a year later. The end
of the 17th and the beginning of the
18th centuries saw further Algerian
incursions, but these were less serious
and more quickly forgotten.
All in all there was little destruction,
no vengeful sacking, sacrilegious
demolition or fanatical incendiarism.
Warfare, generally the repercussion of
the wars of other nations, periodically
halted, for brief periods, the city's
growth and embellishment. After these
intervals, masons, carpenters, sculp¬
tors,- tilers, plasterers and glass-
blowers resumed their toil.
Almost all their works are there, and
in this town, still shut in by its invisible
walls (the vanished ramparts still leave
their imprint on the boulevards), the
shortest walk becomes an endless pil¬
grimage through street and alley, souk
and cul-de-sac, leading not only to
palaces and places of worship (or even
to mere facades and arches or the
pure volumes of the skyline), but also
to the very vision of their builders who
seem close at hand and ready to wel¬
come the visitor.
Yet if, today, it were suddenly to be
announced that bulldozers were ready
to raze these wonders to the ground,
it would surprise but few; too many
examples can be quoted of European

houses the National Institute of

Arab-Islam Museum. For long merely
a suburb of Carthage, ancient Tunis
became the capital after the Arab
conquest in the 7th century AD. The
old quarter contains a multitude of art
and architectural treasures. From
Babylon the art of faience spread to
Persia and was taken up by the Arabs
who carried it to North Africa and the
West. To this day it provides a vehicle
for some of the most delicate
decorative work in Arab-Islamic art.

cities, once the cradles of art, that are
being openly destroyed at this very
moment by hard-headed building pro¬
moters, deaf to the helpless cry of
"culture", to be replaced by their me¬
diocre modernism.
Indeed, some enthusiasts for Public
Works have already put forward plans
for the disembowelling of Tunis, point¬
ing to the traffic problem, which this
kind of surgery would anyway do little
to solve. The good sense of the
local authorities has restrained them.
However, words such as "pilgrimage",
"visitor", "enclosed city", deliber¬
ately used above, hint at another kind
of danger. Is the Medina of Tunis
then no longer a town like any other?
Is it reserved for the curiosity seek¬
er? What has happened?
In about 1860, the Christian European
merchants, whose "fondouks" (ware¬
houses) had crowded in upon each
other over two centuries in the lower
part of the town near the sea gate,
also called the Porte de France, moved
out and installed their warehouses and
dwellings outside the town walls. They
settled themselves in an agreeable
disorder that was harmless enough,
yet which heralded the great trans¬
formation of Tunis and, it has been
said in moments of pessimism, the end
of eleven centuries of peaceful history.
Twenty years later came the French
Protectorate. But it was not destruc-

The mother goddess Tanit finally displaced Ba'al
Hammon as undisputed head of the Carthaginian
pantheon towards the middle of the 4th century
B.C. On stelae erected in sanctuaries dedi¬
cated to her, two of the signs used to symbo¬
lize the divine presence are the open hand with
outward facing palm (top of photo left), and,
(centre photo) the "sign of the bottle" sur¬
mounted by a crescent with tips turned downwards
(see also page 33). The modern Tunisian orna¬
mental clasp (below) incorporates both the cres¬
cent and the open hand and signifies good luck.
Today in much of the Mediterranean world this
motif is known as "the hand of Fatima" and
demonstrates how ancient magical symbols per¬

tive. On the contrary, the French
were builders and modernistic build¬
ers. Starting with the scattered ware¬
houses beside the Porte, the colonists,
at no great cost but with a certain
pride, built a colonial town conceived
in grandiose style.
Facing away from the old Tunis,
henceforward no more than an Arab
quarter, the straight avenues, the right-
angled streets, the plain chequer-board
of the military camp of the new town
spread out beside the lake. Year by
year new administrative buildings,
banks, houses, shops, apartment
houses, cafés, hotels, theatres and
cinemas were added.
In 1970, the lake is still not entirely
surrounded and the avenues stretch
out to north and south, a skyscraper
has sprung up, new centres are
appearing, smoke rises from a few fac¬
tories and a multi-storey hotel domi¬
nates a cluster of luxurious villas.
The hotel also overlooks, on the
other side, a newly built and regret¬
table shanty-town, but this subtracts
nothing from the charm of Tunis, a
modern "European" city that no one
would wish to find fault with. In fact,
it has a great deal of charm, like 19th
century Milan or the suburbs of Tou¬
louse.
But in thus displacing the administra¬
tive and business centre, in changing
radically the criteria of modern urban
life, in giving a new orientation to its
evolution, the heart of the town has
been unwittingly drained of life.
T
HE Medina held out for
some time. Retaining its intellectual
prestige it remains, indeed, the reli¬
gious centre. But most of its leading
citizens, the descendants of great
families, have left their palaces which
brought life to whole sections of the
town, and have rented them to the
impoverished migrants who come from
the country districts, in an unending
stream, lured by the mirage of the
capital.

influx or about the occasional exploi¬
tation of these landless peasants or
the crowds of unemployed.
Luckily there are others who are
concerned about this trend, who rea¬
lize that the Medina of Tunis is one
of the finest in North Africa which
means one of the finest in the world
and that it provides an example of an
astounding continuity of architectural
development, the unsullied fruit of
eleven hundred years of creation.
Above all, they know that with its
suburbs, despite the defection of some
wealthier citizens, despite abuses and
indifference, it retains a highly original
life, a captivating mixture of tradition
and adaptation to the present age.
Knowing all this, these Tunisians
who are now responsible for their
town have refused to accept the role
of placid defenders of "old stones",
content to restore a few monuments
here and there and to turn a district
or two into museums and empty shells.
This would be a cheap way to appease
their consciences.
They understand clearly that they
will have to take care of the whole

tal as a whole: Tunis and its suburbs.
The dangers which beset the historic
heritage and which are sapping it from
within arise from social and economic,
from human causes which are just the
ones that any urban development pro¬
gramme worthy of the name should
tackle.
If these causes are forgotten, the
Medina, behind its austere facades, will
house nothing but shanties, famous
schools debased, mausoleums trans¬
formed into cattle-sheds, while at the
same time Carthage will be covered
with motorways, with villas for middle-
class executives, with tourist "palaces"
and supermarkets. This would, with¬
out doubt, be the easy solution.
It is a solution that must be rejected.
And perhaps such crimes will never
be committed. In 1969, prompted by
the Association for the Protection of
the Medina and the National Institute
of Archaeology and the Arts, the Tuni¬
sian government launched a pilot pro¬
ject for the safeguarding and restora¬
tion of the country's heritage of monu¬
ments in the Tunis-Carthage region as
part of its plans for economic develop¬
ment, and asked for help from Unesco
under the United Nations Development
Programme. Final approval of the
scheme by the UNDP is expected in
January 1971.
The resources in men and materials
to be deployed would be derisory if
the intention were to excavate the site
of Carthage and to put its ruins on
display in a fitting manner, or to buy
up the palaces in danger in the Medina
and restore their woodwork, marble
and stucco facings.
However, the immediate objective is
less spectacular yet no less ambitious.
A team made up of international
experts and representatives of UNDP
and Unesco, will first study and ana¬
lyse the problems of Tunis and Car¬
thage in economic as much as in
archaeological terms and propose the
best solutions and an order of priority
for the work of restoration.
Under the auspices of an inter-minis¬
terial committee, the team has a pri¬
ority task to provide the Tunisian
authorities with a scientifically based
plan for coherent and co-ordinated
urban development of the region. It is
only within this context that one can
hope, and there is already ground for
hope, that generous international aid
will be forthcoming for the safe¬
guarding and restoration of the mo¬
numents and sites.
A few months ago, a leading town-
planning specialist wrote in a French
newspaper: "Paris is in danger. She
seems to be following a path of self
destruction, destroying those very
facets that give her her character and
value. No one, it seems, is aware of
the danger and nothing is yet being
done to halt the process."
Other newspapers in Europe and
elsewhere could equally bewail the lot
of many other cities. It would indeed
be a great achievement if Tunis, the
capital of a country in which the annual
revenue does not exceed 100 dollars
per head, should give the lead that
reason demands; should give the lead
because its leaders have become
aware in time of the destructive
process of haphazard urban develop¬
ment and because its lovers of history
and archaeology have quickly and
clearly grasped the fact that in
order to safeguard stones one must
first see to the needs of men and
women.

EIGHT CENTURIES OF CARTHAGINIAN CIVILIZATION
(Continued from page 20)
The tophet filled up with monuments
which were miniature reproductions
of some of the buildings (all now
vanished) of .the city as it existed
then small Egyptian-style temples,
chapels rising above a high stairway
before which stood altars on which
perfumes were placed.
The kings set an example of piety,
indeed even of fanaticism. Two of
them, Hamilcar in 480 B.C. and Himil¬
co in 396 B.C. made ritual sacrifices
of themselves to expiate defeats. Dur¬
ing the Sicilian wars, many human
victims, especially prisoners, were
sacrificed to Ba'al Hammon and other
gods. Some of these princes, like
Hannibal, the son of Gisco, who reign¬
ed in 409 B.C., were animated by a
racial and religious hatred of the
Greeks.
But these hard, intolerant men pos
sessed savage energy and were driven
by a patriotic fervour. They made their
country the greatest power in the wes¬
tern Mediterranean and mistress of an
empire as extensive and as rich as
the empire being built at the same time
by Athens in the Aegean.
Fortune did not always favour them.
During an initial phase, between 550
and 480 B.C., Carthage gained mastery
of Sardinia, destroying in the process
the local civilization to which we owe
the nuraghs and some fine small
bronzes (see "Unesco Courier", Sep¬
tember 1966). The Phoenician cities
of Sicily and Spain accepted its hege¬
mony. A Punic colony established
in the Etruscan city of Caere (Cervetri,
60 kilometres north of Rome) and in
the port of Pyrgi played a leading role
in local political affairs. When Rome
freed itself from the Etruscans, in
509 B.C., its first concern was to con
clude a treaty of alliance with Car¬
thage.
In both the east and the west, how¬
ever, the dynamic expansion of Hel¬
lenism was in evidence. At the begin¬
ning of the 5th century the great kings
of Persia, Darius and Xerxes, resolved
to crush it. It is quite probable that
Hamilcar, the Magonid ruler of Car¬
thage, concerted his action with theirs.
But the Persian and Punic armadas
were both annihilated, the latter at
Himera, Sicily, according to tradition
on the same day as the Persian defeat
at Salamis.
Carthage then turned away from the
world and retired within itself for
seventy years but only to renew its
strength by once more altering the
bases of its power. King Hanno the
Great first wrested from the Libyans a
territory vaster than that held by any
other Mediterranean city: the north¬
eastern half of present-day Tunisia as
far as a line drawn from Sfax to Ta-
barga.
This task scarcely completed, he
launched ambitious maritime exped¬
itions to ensure control over the trade
with the far west which had given
birth to Carthage, but whose most
effective guardians until then had been
the Phoenicians of Spain.
While Carthage was growing ever
stronger Greece was being torn by
the Peloponnesian war, and in 409 B.C.
Hanno's successors judged the time
ripe to take revenge for Himera. A
savage lightning attack destroyed Seli-
nonte and Agrigento, but the Punic
offensive ground to a halt before Syra¬
cuse. A bloody and exhausting strug¬
gle ensued with neither side able to
seize a decisive advantage. War-weari¬
ness spread in Carthage and a grow¬
ing faction began to oppose the war
and the dynasty that was conducting it.
In about 370 B.C. this faction finally
wrested control from the last of the
Magonids.
The aristocratic regime that was to
rule Carthage until the end of the first
war against Rome gradually became
established, although not without some
setbacks. The nature of this regime
is known to us thanks to an analysis of
it made by Aristotle in about 330 B.C.
Real power was in the hands of com-

WESTWARD HO! These slender little terracotta figures wearing high peaked bonnets depict
the ancestors of the Carthaginians. Dating from the 12th century B.C.,
the statuettes were unearthed from the ruins of a temple at Byblos,
the chief city of Phoenicia until about 1200 B.C., when its prosperity as a trading
centre declined and passed to the Phoenician port of Tyre.
Thus, at the time when a. sculptor of Byblos was modelling these figures
of his contemporaries, the navigators of Tyre were setting out westwards
to explore the whole of the Mediterranean as far as the Iberian
peninsula and the western tip of North Africa.
mittees of nobles and above all lay
with the notorious Tribunal of the One
Hundred and Four which mercilessly
eliminated anyone suspected of wish¬
ing to re-establish personal rule as
well as those accused of treachery or
incompetence.
So close were the links between re¬
ligion and royalty that the revolution
was inevitably accompanied by reli¬
gious reform. From the end of the 5th
century a hitherto obscure goddess
began to appear at the side of Ba'al
Hammon. She was to become the
"Lady of Carthage" and even took pre¬
cedence over her fellow deity. Tanit
reigned over the heavens and espe¬
cially over the moon. She granted the
gift of fertility and watched over the
sleep of the dead. Less cruel than
Ba'al Hammon, she may be likened to
the Greek Hera or the Roman Juno.
One of the reasons for her climb
to ascendancy was undoubtedly the
desire of many Carthaginians to bring
their religion more into line with those
practised in Sicily and southern Italy
where Mother Goddesses played an
important role. In 396 B.C. they even
introduced officially into Carthage the
Greek corn goddesses Demeter and
Kore, who in their mysteries taught
their worshippers how to avoid the
snares of the next world.
The decorations found on the stelae
in the tophet give some idea of the
intensity and complexity of religious
activity in Carthage during the 4th
century B.C. The most frequently re¬
curring symbols, such as the "sign of
Tanit", a triangle surmounted by a bar
and a circle, express with geometric
austerity the ineffable power of the
divinity.
Carthage reached the height of its
prosperity around the year 300 B.C.
Greek influence was on the decline in
Sicily and Italy. In the east, Alexan¬
der's successors, who had planned to
add all Africa to his empire, wasted
their energies by quarrelling among
themselves.
The Carthaginians managed to esta¬
blish friendly relations with one of the
Diadochi (the generals who succeeded
Alexander) the Lagide dynasty which
ruled in Egypt and in old Phoenicia,
now almost completely hellenized.
Whilst retaining their own language
and culture, they readily accepted the
new thought and art forms born of
the marriage of Greek culture and the
old civilizations of the Nile, of Syria
and Asia Minor, and propagated them
in the west.
Meanwhile, during the second half
of the 4th century B.C., Italy had wit¬
nessed an extraordinary political de¬
velopment. Within a few decades, a

### 56995: Eight centuries of Carthaginian civilization
CARTHAGINIAN CIVILIZATION (Continued)
The death of two cities
city hitherto of scant importance, back¬
ward in its economic and cultural life,
had subjugated both the ancient civiliz¬
ed peoples of Etruria, Campania and
Graecia Magna and the half-savage
tribes of the Apennines.
The Punic government had not con¬
sidered that the sudden rise of Rome
constituted a danger; nor can it be
accused of lack of foresight. The new
agricultural and military state had no
apparent reason to quarrel with the
great trading and maritime republic
with which, indeed, it was linked by
a long tradition of friendship sanction¬
ed by many treaties.
But the Italian confederation includ¬
ed associates, more advanced than
Rome itself, who sought compensation
for the restriction of their indepen¬
dence in the profits their trade and
industry might gain from their asso¬
ciation with the most redoubtable
military power of the age.
These were the Campanians whose
chief city was Capua. They belonged
to the Osean nation, related to the
Latins, a few of whose tribes had tried
to infiltrate into Sicily as far back as
the 4th century. B.C.
The Campanians had inveigled some
of the more adventurous of the Roman
senatorial families, such as the Claudii,
into joining them in their enterprise.
This Romano-Campanian party sided
with a band of Campanian pillagers
who had treacherously seized Messina
and whom the Greeks and Cartha¬
ginians sought by common consent to
neutralize. It was thus that, in 264 B.C.,
a few intriguers and the interplay of
somewhat shady interests sparked off
a conflict which was to decide the fate
of the entire Mediterranean and bring
Carthage to ruin.
T
44
HE war, which like the Ro¬
mans, we term the First Punic War,
was to show that the Punic oligarchy,
similar in many respects to the parlia¬
mentary regimes of the 19th century,
was incapable of sustaining a long
struggle.
During the very first years the Ro¬
man legions easily proved themselves
superior to the Carthaginian merce¬
naries by conquering almost all of
Sicily. The Roman fleet also soon
showed itself to be a match for its
rival. At first sight this appears aston¬
ishing; but although the Romans had
no naval tradition, they had at their
disposal the shipyards and the sea¬
men of the Greek cities in Italy.
However, the Campanian Regulus'
attempt to gain a foothold in Africa
ended in complete disaster and most
of the Punic strongholds held out, even
in Sicily. What really decided the
defeat of Carthage after more than
twenty years of war (241 B.C.) was
the breakdown of its economy, the
timidity of its diplomacy and the im¬
potence of a command paralyzed by
the terror that the One Hundred and
Four held for the generals.
The ruling class was responsible
and it paid dearly for its errors. It
was nearly swept away by a social
revolution led by the under-paid de¬
mobilized mercenaries who carried
with them the Libyan peasant prole¬
tariat, for long ruthlessly exploited by
the great landowners.
The republic owed its salvation to
Hamilcar Barca, a young general who
had distinguished himself as a com¬
mando leader during the war in Sicily.
But he had no intention of restoring a
regime which he rightly held respon¬
sible for the defeat. Instead, Hamilcar
built, up an independent power in
Spain, sufficiently far away as not to
be hampered, at least in the early sta¬
ges, by the surveillance of the Roman
Senate.
When he perished in 228 B.C., he
left his son-in-law Hasdrubal and his
sons a kingdom of which the Barcids
became the sovereigns, a treasury
supplied by the inexhaustible mines of
the sierras and a seasoned army ent¬
irely loyal to its leaders.
Hannibal, who was to inherit these
resources less than ten years later,
after the murder of his brother-in-law,
had perfected his father's plan which
really aimed at taking revenge on
Rome.
He was extremely well informed
about internal politics in Italy. He
knew that the Greeks and Campa¬
nians, after benefiting handsomely
from the victory that had opened up
for them the markets of the entire
western Mediterranean, were becom¬
ing apprehensive about Latium's eco¬
nomic progress and the greed of
Roman businessmen. They would
gladly have withdrawn from the part¬
nership if they had been able to do so
without risk. Their defection would
deprive Rome of its naval strength and
render it powerless outside Italy.
The legions had to be neutralized if
this defection was to be brought
about. This Hannibal proposed to do
by using the formidable manpower
resources of the Celtic world as a
battering ram. Every part of the plan
fitted logically into place, including the
seemingly romantic escapade that was
to lead the young Barcid with his
Spanish-African army and his elephants
through the Pyrenees, across the
Rhone and beyond the Alps (219 B.C.).
Why the great plan failed after
coming so close to realization within
a bare three years cannot be explained
here. After his victory at Cannae,
Capua opened its gates to him (216
B.C.), but the Italian confederation held
together. Meanwhile Spain, which had
been quickly conquered by the Bar¬
cids, fell just as quickly into the
hands of the Scipios.
Perhaps the situation could have
been saved with the assistance of the
Greeks if the kings of Macedonia and
Syria had been more far-seeing and
decisive. Once these opportunities
were missed the outcome was inevit¬
able Rome's patient re-conquest of
Italy, Scipio's successful landing in
Africa, and Carthage compelled to
accept the victor's terms after the
battle of Zama (202 B.C.).
Contrary to what is often believed,
these terms were relatively mild.
Scipio and the majority of the Senate
wanted to confine Carthage to Africa
and to make it, once and for all, sub¬
ject to Rome; they did not want to
destroy Carthage. It was not until
about 170 B.C. that Cato and his party
managed to impose the idea that the
destruction of Carthage was essential
to Roman policy.
ANY explanations for this
sudden change of attitude have been
advanced. In my opinion it was due
to the internal political situation in
Carthage. Ever since Hamilcar Barca
had restored power to the people, the
city had moved steadily towards a
more and more progressive form of
democracy.
Hannibal himself had contributed to
this evolution when, after Zama, he
attempted to govern his country for a
while. But at this stage in its history,
Rome could not tolerate the emergence
anywhere of popular regimes capable
of disturbing the very harsh social
system which, directly or indirectly,
produced enormous profits for its
ruling classes. The Senate destroyed
Corinth and Carthage in the same year
(146 B.C.) because they had become
hotbeds of revolution.
Such is the picture that we have of
the often obscure and sometimes
paradoxical destiny of this Asiatic city
clinging to the shores of Africa. So
much tenacity, such extraordinary
capacity for adaptation; were they
expended for nothing? It could easily
be shown that Carthage, whose
language and civilization did not finally
die out until the 4th century A.D.,
continued to play an important role in
the Roman empire that destroyed it.
Its heritage has been passed on
elsewhere too to the Berbers who
had been pupils as well as subjects
and, through them, some part has
doubtless been handed down to
present-day Tunisia, now more than
ever confirmed in its role as bridge
between the Moslem east and the
Christian west.

### 57017: Jean Perrin, a pioneer of modern physics
T
JEAN
PERRIN
A PIONEER
OF MODERN
PHYSICS
by Pierre Auger
PIERRE AUGER is head of the permanent com¬
mittee for the creation of an International Scien¬
tific Foundation. The committee is being set up
with Unesco's assistance. A leading French
physicist, he was formerly Director-General of
the European Space Research Organization,
which he helped to set up, and President of the
International Computation Centre, Rome. From
1948 to 1959 Professor Auger was Director of
Unesco's Department of Natural Sciences.
Among his books is an important work published
by Unesco, "Current Trends in Scientific
Research" (3rd edition, Unesco, Paris, 331-,
$6.75, hard cover).
HE final years of the 19th century and the
first decades of the 20th were marked by tremendous advances of know¬
ledge in the world of physics. Radioactivity, the electron, energy quanta,
relativity and the atomic nucleus came upon the scene, in turn opening
up new areas of science each of which alone could have constituted a
new and distinct discipline.
Jean Perrin, the French physicist whose centenary is being commemo¬
rated this year, played a leading role in this remarkable development.
It was Perrin who, at the turn of the century, demonstrated the particle
nature of cathode rays, identifying them as the elementary carriers of
the negative charge, in other words, as the electrons that have revolu¬
tionized all branches of industry and communications.
This discovery was remarkable for two reasons; it was made by a young,
twenty-five year old scientist, who had just completed his university
studies; it settled a debate that had divided the great physicists of the
day for over ten years.
The demonstration of the particle nature of electricity, "the atoms of
the electric charge", led Jean Perrin to undertake an even more extensive
investigation, this time a study of the atoms constituting all matter.
Prior to Perrin's work physicists spoke of the atomic hypothesis and the
kinetic theory of gases; after it there remained no doubt as to the real
existence of atoms, so convincing was his demonstration.
He started from the notion, held by Boltzmann, Maxwell and Van der
Waals, that all individual particles of matter contained in a fluid must be
subject to the same laws of energy, whether they be atoms, molecules or
grains of emulsion. It was merely a question of a change of scale, but
the kinetic energies would be the same and consequently the same laws
of motion would hold good.
One particular case was that of the Brownian movement which can be
detected even with a student's microscope when observing mushroom
spores floating in water. By a vast change of scale, amounting to a
factor of sixty million, it was possible to compare the distribution of
emulsion grains over a height of a tenth of a millimetre with that of mole¬
cules of air up to an altitude of six "kilometres.
Measurements with the microscope thus made possible the calculation
of the number of molecules contained in a litre of air. In fact, what
Jean Perrin was thus to measure directly for the first time was what we
now know as Avogadro's number the number of molecules in a gramme-
molecule (for example, two grammes of hydrogen) and which has a
value of approximately six hundred thousand million million million.
Perrin turned his attention to the investigation of several other atomic
and molecular phenomena, demonstrating, for example, the existence of
layers a single molecule thick in the thin films of soap bubbles and
surface coatings on water. He published numerous papers on fluores¬
cence, surface electrification and colloids in which he repeatedly demon¬
strated his powerful imaginative capacity and his great talent as an expe¬
rimenter.
His ideas were often much ahead of his time he proposed a planetary
model of the atom as early as 1901 and, in 1921, he postulated that the
energy of the stars resulted from thermonuclear reaction.
Endowed with great personal magnetism, he was able, as professor and
laboratory director, to inspire many students to take up research careers.
Jean Perrin's brilliant scientific work earned him the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1926, but it was not his only claim to the recognition of those
concerned with pushing back the frontiers of knowledge. His vigorous
and skilful campaign led to the creation before the Second World War of
the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique which was to
serve as a model for other countries. He was also responsible for the
foundation of the Palais de la Découverte in Paris, which has become an
effective centre for the popularization of science.
Believing that science was the result of contributions from all sources,
and therefore the common property of mankind, he strove throughout his
life, with truly democratic purpose, to make science accessible to all and
to promote its advancement for the .good of all.

Germán help
for Borobudur
The Federal Republic of Germany is to
contribute over half a million dollars
towards the restoration of the 1,100 year
old Buddhist temple of Borobudur in Indo¬
nesia. This represents the first gift in a
plan for the restoration and tourist deve¬
lopment of the site with Unesco's help.
Total cost is estimated at 5.5 million dol¬
lars for restoration and between 2 and
3 million dollars for the development of the
site, of which Indonesia will provide
1 million dollars.

to Maria Montessori
Unesco recently commemorated the
centenary of the birth of Maria Montessori,
the distinguished Italian educator. During
.a ceremony at Unesco headquarters on
October 30, M. Atilio Dell'Oro Maini, Presi¬
dent of Unesco's General Conference, then
meeting in Paris, and other speakers paid
tribute to the work of Maria Montessori
whose teaching methods and materials have
been incorporated into many modern edu¬

problem for the researchers is to assemble
a representative control group of children
who have seen little television.

1,000 Unesco fellowships
awarded annually
Well over 1,000 men and women every
year travel abroad under a Unesco fellow¬
ship scheme for raising educational stan¬
dards, spreading specialized skills and pro¬
moting understanding of other cultures.
The fellowships cover training in education,
science, the social sciences, culture, the
creative arts and communications. In
1970 nearly a quarter of the participants
have been women. Some 12,000 fellow¬
ships have been awarded since the scheme
began in 1948.
Antidote to heat pollution
Heat pollution of lakes and rivers by
water released from electric power plants
could be eliminated by air-cooling systems
utilizing large fans blowing over finned
tubes to replace conventional water cool¬
ing towers. This design change, says Pro¬
fessor J.T. Davies of Birmingham University,
in a recent report on trends in engineering
research prepared for Unesco, would also
free electric power plants from their present
dependence on large supplies of water.

SPLENDOURS OF TUNIS
Wâàm
The Medina of Tunis with its mos¬
ques, markets, inns and dwellings is
a treasure house of Islamic art and
architecture encompassing a period
of more than 11 centuries. Unesco
and the Tunisian Government are
embarking on a vast programme for
the preservation of the Medina and
its development as a major cultural
resource for Tunisia. (See pages 4
and 35). This minaret crowns the
17th-century Yussef Dey mosque.
