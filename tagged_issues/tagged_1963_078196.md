### 50548: Uncharted lands; neglected masterpieces in the world of translations

UNCHARTED LANDS
Neglected masterpieces in the world of translations
by Roger Caillois
he world grows smaller every day and whether
we like It or not, each of us Increasingly feels
his country Is a mere province on the planet, its history a.
sequence of local episodes not necessarily coinciding with
the history of the world. Naturally, the ties which bind
us to our cultural background remain strong. We may
even continue to think of this culture as universal and
world-embracing. But we know it can only lay claim to
such resounding titles in so far as it has drawn upon all
the world had to offer and If it gathered this nourishment
in almost every corner of the globe.
Nowadays, too, there are powerful travel stimulants:
business, holidays, politics and science. An increasing
army of globetrotters moves more frequently, more easily
and ever further afield. Its members bring back from
countries they have traversed an irresistible desire to know
more about things they have only glimpsed in passing, the
kind of nostalgic longing fed by images of history,
customs, literature and arts in lands only . half-
apprehended.
Even the stay-at-homes, rooted in their familiar haunts,
find delivered to their door, by the magic carpets of press,
the radio and television, all the colour, sound and scents
distilled from the bustle and riches of far-off lands, a
heady foretaste of all kinds of stimulants for the mind.
Once aroused, their curiosity soon demands some less
superficial, less fleeting acquaintance with these fabulous
travellers' tales, and a chance to enjoy them more directly.
For painting, sculpture, music, this need can be satisfied
without much difficulty. A recording, a reproduction in
colour, a copy or a model, all carry with them an essential
message whose meaning is clear anywhere. Museums and
albums offer an easily accessible panorama of the things
that are best in world art. A library of records, carefully
chosen, provides its owner in a very small compass with
the most significant examples of music composed in the
most divergent modes.
Writing, by contrast, does not enjoy these
migratory qualities of easy and direct trans¬
mission. Mere mechanical reproduction can never convey
the beauty of works in which language is both the
substance and the vehicle. Words are not like colours,
forms and sounds, which are self-evident and accessible
to every eye and every ear (though there are excellent
eyes blind to painting and keen ears closed to music).
No innate Intellectual intuition transmits thought and
poetry automatically to the mind. Their vehicle is
language, and language implies translation, if words are
not to remain, as the old tag rather harshly puts it,
"dead letters."
There is no question here of using recordings, photo¬
graphs, castings, mechanical reproductions, as with the
dance and music, frescoes and bas-reliefs. Translation,
that thankless, complex and elusive task. Is inescapable.
Every language is a cipher, a secret tongue, to be decoded
and made plain, to be transposed from its author's terms
into those of his audience.
This audience, potentially, is the literate public in a
world itself employing several hundred languages;, in
other words, several hundred different cipher-systems.
These ciphers, moreover, these codes and catalogues of
4 signs, are each the fruit of an infinitely long birth; they
have evolved in different climates, in contact with
different flora and fauna, influenced by different condi
tions and techniques; they express a multitude of cultures
and conflicting customs.
Inevitably, they are not simply interchangeable. White,
to take only one small instance, may be a symbol of purity
In one society, of mourning in another. The Eastern
author, to suggest an atmosphere of grief, describes his
heroine as "clad from head to foot in white." The rigid
translator, denying himself the least deviation from literal
exactness, unhelpfully renders sorrow as innocence.
Christian missionaries, charged with teaching the
Gospels and interpreting the Bible to the most diverse
peoples, know the difficulties of explaining, to societies
innocent of money, private property and interest rates,
the parable of the servants who invested their talents
and the other who buried his, or of bringing home the
parable of the tares and the wheat to men who live in
deserts, laboriously watering and desperately sheltering
from sun and wind their least blade of grass.
et here it is only the meaning that has to be
explained. What happens when, as in poetry,
the potency of writing lies in its harmony or powers of
evocation, in the alignment of syllables or flow or vowels,
in alliteration or inner resonance? The original language
may dispose of articles, verbs, inflexions and syntactical
subtleties unknown in the tongue of the translator.
What paraphrase can be proposed that does not risk
weakening not only the structure of the language, but the
implicit and all the more exacting movement of its
thought and feeling?
Such reflexions seem to suggest that translations can
never hope -to be more than approximate renderings. But
first they must actually exist. In point of fact, they are
rare, at best scanty, and glaringly inadequate.
If we set out to compile an atlas of translations in which
each map represented a country or at least a language
and we shaded in each map according to the extent to
which works written or published in each have been
translated into other languages, the results would astonish
us. The chief cause of our surprise would be the large
number of white spaces and lightly-shaded ones indicat¬
ing, on this world cultural map, literatures which are
completely unknown or nearly so. Just as olden-time car¬
tographers, at a loss to explain unknown terrains, wrote
on their maps "Here be lions," so, vast tracts to-day could
be labelled with "Here be masterpieces." Masterpieces,
beyond doubt, abound; but unknown and inaccessible.
Even when, as is sometimes the case, a fair number of
translations of these literatures exist, their presentation
more often than not is such as to render them of little
interest to the average reader. They set him down in a
civilization of which he knows virtually nothing, where all
is unfamiliar. Customs are disconcerting, emotions alien
and strangely expressed. The touch-stones of beauty,
emotion, persuasion and communication are all quite
foreign to him. Their most subtle poems dwindle into
flat banality. All their allusions are meaningless. The
reader brave enough to launch himself into this unknown
country is baffled, by inexplicable simplicities, by unintelli¬
gible words of wisdom, a seeming monotony or incoherence
which dismay instead of delighting; presently he feels he
is simply forging fruitlessly through impassable jungles
or over implacably empty deserts.
Yet palliatives can be imagined which, by taking
account of these obstacles, can stave off this kind of

SAINT JEROME, who was
born in Dalmatia about
331 A.D. and died In
Bethlehem in 420 A.D.
is regarded as the patron
saint of translators. After
being a student of theology,
he lived for three years
as an anchorite hermit in
the desert wastes of Chalcis
in Asia Minor where, it is
told, he tamed a lion. He
later settled in a monastery
in Bethlehem where he
translated the Old Testa¬
ment directly from the He¬
brew with the aid of Jewish
scholars. This Latin trans¬
lation of the Scriptures
became the Vulgate or autho¬
rized version. Saint Jerome
has been depicted by many
painters down the ages.
Shown here is the cele¬
brated work of El Greco.

discouragement. Only a few will be mentioned here.
They in no way supplant the unabridged integral texts
required by scholars, but they might often serve to reassure
a hesitant public.
For example, in the case of exceptionally long works,
such as the Indian epics and the great Chinese,noveis,
selected extracts could profitably offer the most character¬
istic and most memorable passages.
Then there are the works really difficult of access, such
as the mystic poems of Persia or the ceremonial "No"
theatre of Japan, fruits of an intricate refinement and
complex convention, or the enigmatic tragedy of Sev¬
enteenth century France; typical extracts from these,
presented with commentaries that situate the work in its
historic and cultural context, ought to be able to commun¬
icate the aesthetic, philosophical or moral Inspiration
behind writing which at first sight says nothing to or
frightens off the uninitiated reader.
Similarly, a style which flourished at a given moment
and in a particular civilization should be capable of
illustration in a relatively small compass by skilful antho¬
logies, filling in the outlines of its evolution, summarizing
the most meaningful contribution of a school, and assem¬
bling the best examples of a significant style.
Lastly, around the figures of great men founders of
religions or of empires, great monarchs, Inspired reformers,
bold explorers it should be possible to gather a body of
anecdotes drawn from traditional records, which could
instruct and explain at the same time as entertaining.
Certainly the problem here is delicate: a question or
beguiling without betraying, of pleasing without im¬
poverishing the original.
The root causes of the present situation are abiding.
Indeed inherent in the nature of things. The task of
redressing them is immense, demanding continuous
extension and continuous perfecting. The challenge, for
the moment, is to contrive to vary the menu and maintain
the appetite of a public already disposed to partake of
the feast. One could wager that the scarcely-tapped
resources of world literature will be exhausted more
rapidly than the curiosity of enthusiasts of masterpieces
silted over by the centuries or introduced from the anti¬
podes. But as a start,. they have to be translated.
The Ideal Universal Museum requires only wall-space:
photography can do the rest. But the Ideal Universal
Library needs more than shelves and even printing- 5
presses. It demands Interpreters; In other words, a
human labour of learning and of love.

### 62429: The Continuing barrier: translation and East-West communications

THE CONTINUING BARRIER
TRANSLATION & EAST-WEST COMMUNICATIONS
he regular appearance of the Index Transla¬
tionum and Its constantly increasing size has
been one of the encouraging signs of the growth of
collaboration between nations, and it is with considerable
interest that one looks into its well-printed pages and
studies the evidence of the cumulative dissemination of
ideas by means of the more or less prompt translation of
the world's literature.
The 1962 volumethe thirteenth in the present series-
lists some thirty-two thousand translations published in
fifty-eight countries In 1960, Including a few Issued in
earlier years, and one Is Impressed by the efficiency of the
co-operating national organizations that have contributed
the detailed entries. One is also moved that world-famous
names throughout the whole period from Aeschylus to
Tolstoy and beyond are represented by a score or more of
translations in a single year.
A note of caution, however, begins to sound as one exa¬
mines the pages more closely and, in doing so, I have
myself returned to an article ("Translations as a Factor
of East-West Communications," Unesco Bulletin for Li¬
braries, Vol. XI, 5-6, May-June 1957; The Unesco Courier,
April 1958), which I wrote five years ago, with the idea of
ascertaining what progress, If any, had been made in
this field toward the improvement of East-West communi¬
cations. In that article I gave a statistical analysis
which showed only too clearly that at that time East and
West were for the most part Ignoring the intellectual and
cultural riches of the other.
It is true that the Index Translationum of those days
did not receive the support, it does today and that its
contents were therefore far from comprehensive.
Nevertheless, it was manifest that a more complete record
would hardly have revealed a more encouraging picture.
Today the Index Translationum is still far from complete
some fifty countries are outside its list of contributors.
But even with the information at present available certain
trends are apparent and it is possible to estimate to a
fair degree the amount of communication between East
and West and what the future is likely to produce In this
respect.
Figures given In the tables printed here are,
at first glance, a distinct improvement on those
given five years ago. One's immediate reaction Is to say
that progress, however slow, is being made and that
natural growth Is to be preferred to any artificial
stimulus. As Arthur Waley says: "What matters is that
a translator should have been excited by the work he
translates, should be haunted day and night by the
feeling that he must put it into his own language, and
should be in a state of restlessness and fret till he has
done so." Thus, perhaps, the present haphazard system,
given time, will produce a vast range of translations of
permanent value.
This, however, would be too facile an attitude and one
which a closer examination of the findings does not
6 support. A scrutiny of the figures In these tables in fact
suggests that the attitude In the field of translation, both
from East to West and from West to East, is mostly
lackadaisical, and that there is need for some positive
action to overcome this present state of lethargy, which
otherwise may continue for some time to come.
A look at the first table on page 8, showing the transla¬
tions from Western languages published in Asia, reveals
that the origin of most works translated lies In four
countries only. The translations from the rest are
negligible and often relate merely to "obvious" transla¬
tions of books written about the countries into whose
languages they have been translated. Thus the East
continues to know little or nothing of the classical and
modern writers of Scandinavia, Italy, and the Spanish-
speaking world, to name only three of the great language
groups.
What Is still more distressing is that no effort
has been made to translate the best of recent
scientific or technical works from these countries: in fact,
only Egypt, Japan and Korea have any large number of
translations of such works; the remaining countries have
mostly limited their translations to the humanities. Nor
does this mean that what was translated was necessarily
of solid worth: subtract the light fiction and the purely
sensational, and there is left a residue of some well-known
classics and a pitiful handful of modern works of merit.

### 62435: UNESCO's annual translations' guide

JUST PUBLISHED
A look through the pages of the re¬
cently published Volume XIV of
"Index Translationum", the latest
edition of Unesco's annual international
bibliography of translations (*), confirms
some of the world's regular translation
patterns and also reveals some surprising
new trends in 1961 the period covered
by this volume.
In the first category we find that the
Bible still retained its place as the world's
most translated work in 1961 with 246
translations (258 in 1960) while Lenin was
still the world's most translated author
(185 compared with 240).
In the cases of some other authors there
have been some surprising fluctuations
from one year to the next. Tagore, for
example, was translated 101 times (30 in
1960) though this increase is easily ex¬
plained by the fact that 1961 was the
centenary of Tagore's birth and the anni¬
versary was celebrated in different coun¬
tries by the publication of translations,
poems, essays and other works.
Conversely there have been some sharp
reductions for authors in the top bracket
of translation lists: Shakespeare, 98 (134
in 1960); Jules Verne, 88 (122); Dostoiev¬
sky, 79 (79); Tolstoy, 115 (122); Chekov,

Collison
Throughout the Far East
the wisdom of the classics
is preserved not only in
books but also as an element
of art, decoration and archi¬
tecture. When a famous
saying is written down by
an expert calligrapher, like
the Japanese one shown
here, It becomes a work
that can be appreciated
aesthetically in both the
Occident and the Orient.
But it is obvious that intel¬
lectual appreciation of the
great classics of the East
can only be brought to the
West through translations.

66 (108). Even so, these names remain
high up in the list. The reduction can
probably be explained by the fact that
works by these writers are by now more
or less universally known.
In other cases there have been increas¬
es. Translations of Mark Twain rose to
72 and those of the children's friend, Hans
Anderson, to 53. Authors of ancient times
who have maintained their position include
Aristotle (23) and Euripides (19). The
great 19th century novelists continue
their world-wide travels Balzac 61 trans¬
lations, Dickens, 58 while among the
modern authors, Simenon has 68 transla¬
tions, followed by Hemingway (65), Sho-
lokov (54) and Steinbeck (48). Jean-Paul
Sartre is also among the authors whose
works have crossed most frontiers during
1961: 42 translations compared with 19
in 1960. Graham Greene increased his
total from 58 to 60. Playwrights too have
been on the move: 11 translations for
Ionesco, 13 for Durrenmatt. Works of
philosophy translated included nine by
Father Teilhard de Chardin.
This latest "Index Translationum" (the
14th edition published by Unesco) listing
32.931 titles translated in 1961 in 77 coun¬
tries (31,230 in 1960) is a unique publica
tion revised and compiled each year
thanks to collaboration' between libraries
and bibliographical organizations through¬
out the world.
Information given for each work in¬
cludes the name of the author, the title of
the translation, the name of the translator,
the place of publication, the price in the
currency of the country of publication, the
original language in which the work was
written and its original title.
Titles of the translations, given by coun¬
try, are indexed under: General Works;
Philosophy; Religion and Theology; Law,
Social Sciences and Education; Philology
and Linguistics; Natural and Exact Scien¬
ces; Applied Sciences; Arts, Games and
Sports; Literature; History, Biography and
Geography.
History, Biography and Geography is
the only section in which there has been
a decrease compared with the previous
year (2,729 compared with 2,818). Great¬
est increase is found in the literature sec¬
tion: 511 translations more than in 1960
(despite a drop of 412 in the U.S.S.R.
2,479 against 2,891 in 1960). This de¬
crease is, however, more than compen¬
sated for by a general increase in this
category of translations found in Germany,
Austria, Bulgaria, France (1,042 compar¬
ed with 844), India, Iran and several other
countries.
In this astonishing switch from one lan¬
guage to another, Balzac turns up in Slo¬
vene, Oscar Wilde in Georgian, Shakes¬
peare in Chuvash, Thomas Mann in Lat¬
vian, Galsworthy in Esthonian, Pirandello
in Turkish, Garcia Lorca in Czech, Beau-
delaire in Swedish, Madame de Sévigné
in English, Edgar Allen Poe in Rumanian,
Conan Doyle in Arabic, Walter Scott in
Hindustani, Xenophon in Hebrew, Musa-
raki in French and Emily Bronte in Japan¬
ese.
Though literary works account for most
titles listed in "Index Translationum", some
countries have given preference to other
kinds of works. In the United Kingdom,
for example, out of 717 published trans¬
lations (411 in 1960), there were 211
works in theology and religion (an in¬
crease of 25).

### 62429: The Continuing barrier: translation and East-West communications

THE BARRIER (Cont'd)
A literary scandal translating from translations
The effort in translation is in fact less impressive than
would at first appear.
Another disturbing feature of these figures, as shown
In the second table on this page, Is the number of the
translations which have reached the East by way of a
second language usually English (1). Since most are
pure literature this feature is especially important, for
translation is not a very satisfactory re-export. As
Professor L.W. Tancock has said: "No literary work is
tasteless, like a glass of distilled water; it has its peculiar
aroma, or consistency or texture, which the translator
must try to transmit."
The translation of a translation Is thus- in danger of
being unpalatable If not positively misleading. Whether
one can safely draw the conclusion that the East is suffer¬
ing from a dearth of linguists, or whether as Is far more
likely one can assume that most available linguists are
more profitably employed (in a material sense) in other
pursuits, the fact is that the average reader in the East
has no access to the majority of French, German and
Russian works except through the intervention of English
translators, and practically none at all to works in other
Western languages (1).
T the risk of seeming to utter an endless
L-Jeremlad, I must also point out that even the
total figures are misleading, since India's bibliography
(the most substantial of all Asian bibliographies) is
Inflated by the need for providing translations of the same
book into three of four different languages in an effort
to overcome the formidable language-barriers of the sub¬
continent.
It is also interesting to see how closely the pattern of
translation follows the historical background of an Indivi¬
dual country, reflecting perhaps the continuance of an
educational policy which, originally introduced from the
West, has remained as part of the life of the people today.
(1) Editor's note. This situation is even more acute than the
author assumes, since it is not always possible for the editor of
Index Translationum to indicate with certainly in every case that
translations were made from the original text. It is further¬
more of interest to observe that in several countries, particularly
in those such as India, the UJSJ5.R. and others with more than
one widely spoken language, the use of a single language as a
pivot for further translations is, for practical reasons, a matter
of policy.
Thus, Indonesian translations are drawn mainly from
works in English or Dutch; Pakistan, Iran and Egypt show
particular preference for English books, and Viet-Nam for
both English and French.
How soon can one hope that each nation will venture
beyond its present cultural background in search of
horizons beyond? In this connexion, it is notable how
remarkably little each Asian country is translating of the
works of other Asian countries, in spite of the fact that
the language barriers in the East are quite as great as
those between East and West.
While the position in the East is alleviated to a
certain extent by the fact that English is
widely read and therefore access to much Western
literature Is greater than these figures would suggest, the
West Is not so fortunate. Few people in the
West know any Eastern language, and the majority of
those who do are language specialists.
Figures given in the table on page 9, showing the
Eastern literature translated Into Western languages, are
therefore the more Incomprehensible. The figures them¬
selves are disappointing: when the semi-religious classics,
the folklore, the political and philosophical works have
been subtracted, there is no reason for the West to be
proud of the residue. Moreover, very few scientific or
technical works have been translated, as though the West
were ignoring as It most certainly cannot afford to do
the developments In these fields in Asia.
The West is in fact in danger of being more ignorant
of Eastern literature than the East of Western literature,
and with far less excuse.
A further and most unexpected sidelight is that the
West seems to be almost universally ignorant of Chinese.
Of the 181 translations of Chinese works listed, no less
than 90 per cent were made through the medium of
another Western language usually English of Russian.
The situation is unfortunately only too clear: commercial
considerations are often paramount. If the publisher is
convinced that there is a ready market for any particular
item, the necessary funds are soon available; witness
Norway's translation of no less than fourteen of the
Nancy Drew series of detective stories in two years (entries
nos. 16379 to 16392), to select only one of the many such
examples.

It is always a temptation to draw too many conclusions
from statistics, and perhaps it would be wise to limit
oneself to the reflection that the Index Translationum
continues to confirm that contact in this field between
East and West Is haphazard, capricious and dependent
on highly irrelevant factors.
There is no villain in the piece: publishers must balance
their budgets, translators must find work that keeps them
alive, and a nation cannot demand what it does not even
know it is missing. But should such a situation be allow¬
ed to continue, and is there not a case for international
action?
At first sight the problem seems insoluble, but is it
really so? If a work Is made available in English, French,
Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese, It becomes accessi¬
ble to most of the peoples of the world. That Is, six lan¬
guages will reach the great majority of the world's reading
population, and through them an individual work will
reach their fellow men by means of local translations
as happens now In India, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia.
IIn spite of the world's vast output of books each
year how many of these are of outstanding
merit? Probably no single country could seriously name
more than a hundred in its own language, and in many
cases the number would be very much smaller. Would it
not be possible to make a world effort to ensure that, by
co-operative action between publishers and governments,
the best of each nation's current works are made
available in each of the six languages?
It Is true that Arthur Waley is doubtful of the wisdom
of sponsored translation programmes, but there is surely
a case for setting up an international translators' school,
on the lines of the Interpreters' School at Geneva, to
provide the necessary training for this work. In which
event the methods of the great Chinese translator Lin
Shu (1852-1924) might well be used by the students as a
means of combining oral and reading skills.
And, finally, would It not be a good Idea to give special
place to the translation of practical books, where niceties
of style and problems of politics and ideologies did not
arise, so that the whole world might share In the scientific
and technical advances now being made?
The enormous gaps In the translation of the literature
of the past would still remain to be filled as a retrospective
effort, but the modest step made In concentrating on
contemporary works might well stimulate some attempts
In this direction as well. The translations, when complet¬
ed, could be offered to publishers In the same way as
original works are submitted: only In cases of failure to
achieve publication by this means should it be necessary
to seek other ways of making the material available.
Perhaps there are other and better methods of overcom¬
ing the continuing barriers between East and West In the
world of literature, but one thing is certain: the present
position is unsatisfactory, and every means should be used
to examine the problem thoroughly and decide upon an
effective and speedy line of action before it is too late.

### 62437: Ishi, the last of the Yanas; a primitive Indian between two worlds

ISHI THE LAST OF
by Alfred Metraux
A wild man at the
limit of exhaustion
and fear. This was
how the last survivor
of the Yahi Indians
appeared to the peo¬
ple of a small Cali¬
fornia town who saw
him for the first
time on the morning
of August 29, 1911.
His hair was burned
off close to his head
as a sign of mourn¬
ing according to the
Indian custom and he
was naked except for
a ragged scrap of
ancient canvas which
he wore around his
shoulders. He was
later given the name
Ishihis own Yahi
Indian word for
manby Professor
Alfred Kroeber, the
American ethnologist.
tVER since the 16th Century, "noble savages"
with their unsophisticated common sense and
carefree simplicity of nature have charmed and
fascinated Europeans and Inspired philosophers and
poets to sing their praises. Montaigne has recounted
his conversations with three Tuplnamba Indians from
Brazil, in whose remarks he found much wisdom. London
society In the seventeenth century became wildly
enthusiastic over a Tahitian named Omal. And, in
addition to these real-life persons, there have been many
fictitious "noble savages" of literature who showed up
"civilized" man and whose qualities were a living
reproach to the corrupt society of their day.
Mrs. Alfred L. Kroeber, the widow of the famous
American anthropologist, has just written an admirable
book (1). about another "noble savage," the Indian, Ishi,
whose memory was still very much alive some twenty
years ago in the University of California. People who had
known Ishi spoke of him to me with affection and respect,
and this book helps us to understand why they were so
deeply moved.
The "noble savages" mentioned in literature readily
accepted to visit the white man's world and were
Introduced to It under the protection of explorers or of
kindly travellers. Ishi, the last of them, made a
lonely and painful entry Into our civilization.
One night In the summer of 1911, a butcher In a small
town in California was woken up by the furious barking
of his dogs. He went outside and found near his house
a "wild man" leaning against a wall, quite clearly in the
last stages of exhaustion. The sheriff was called, and
after handcuffing the strange creature, he took him off
to the county gaol where, as an extra precaution, he
locked him up in the cell reserved for dangerous lunatics.
In California, where the original masters of the soil had
been forgotten after having been wiped out, the discovery
of a naked savage was greeted by the newspapers as an
extraordinary event. Prison turned, out to be a refuge for
Ishi, protecting him from the indiscreet curiosity of the
crowds who came to stare at this survivor from prehistory.
It is curious to note that Ishi did not retain any
unpleasant memories of his first contact with white men.
The prison had impressed him as a fine house and he was
grateful for the food he had been given and the way in
which he had been treated. Ishi had, in fact, been
expecting to be killed. He could not imagine any other
fate at the hands of the white men who had massacred
his own people.
The strange capture of a naked Indian in a small
California town was the last episode in a drama which
had begun half a century before. California, rich in
edible plants, had once been the home of one of the
densest Indian populations in Northern America. The
annexing of this territory by the United States, and the
Gold Rush, brought thousands of Immigrants from Europe
swarming into these happier climes.
Of the many trails opened up by the white men's
wagons, there was one which led through the wooded
valleys inhabited by the small tribe of the Yahi, belonging
to the Yana group. There were some two or three
hundred members of the tribe, and they put up a fierce
resistance to the invaders.' They fought with the courage
of despair, for what could they possibly do against these
hordes of well-armed men who felt nothing but contempt
for the natives? Towards 1872, when Ishi must have been
about ten years old, the Yahls had been virtually wiped off
the ethnical map of America. There was barely a
handful of them left.

versity of California Press, 1961 ($ 5,95).
he remnants of the Yahi tribe preferred a
wandering life In the forests of the Cali-
fornlan mountains to the advantages of submission.
Hidden in the canyons, their few families constituted
"the smallest free nation in the world, which by an
unexampled fortitude and stubbornness of character
succeeded in holding out against the tide of civilization
twenty-five years longer even than Geronimo's famous
band of Apaches and for almost thirty-five years after the
Sioux and their allies defeated Custer." During this
period, the Yahi became something of a mythical people.
The settlers who had taken over their territory had heard
about them, but never saw anything of them save,
perhaps, a wisp of smoke from one of their fires rising
above the trees.
It Is difficult to imagine the existence of a dozen Indians
who have chosen to live like hunted animals rather than
give themselves up to subjection. They- were forever on

BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
Ishi as he was in 1914. Tne man from the Stone Age was only able to make a slow adaptation to

the move, taking the utmost precautions to- conceal every
trace of their passage and living only on the animals they
managed to kill or the fruit and herbs they gathered.
Gradually, fatigue, age and Illness took their toll of the
fugitives. By 1906, Ishi, his aged mother, his sister and
an old man were the only survivors of the tribe.
One day, a group of surveyors took their camp by
surprise. They found Ishi's mother who, being paralysed,
had been unable to flee. The white men were, cruel
enough to carry off the food and the few objects she had
without leaving anything in return. Ishi's sister and
the old man never come back. His mother died a few
days later. Ishi was alone. For five years he lived a
solitary life in the forests of his territory. When he was
discovered on the outskirts of one of the white men's
villages, he had made up his mind to return to the com¬
munity of men, even though they might be his worst
enemies.
Professor Kroeber had made a life study of the Call-
fornian Indians, and his attention was attracted by the
newspaper reports of the capture of a "wild man." He
telegraphed the sheriff, asking him to receive his col¬
league, Professor Waterman. The latter went to the
prison equipped with vocabularies of the Indian
languages of the Callfornlan district, and read lists of
these words to Ishi. He listened patiently, but his face did
not betray the slightest sign of comprehension.
Waterman was beginning to be discouraged and was
about to give up his attempt to communicate with the
"savage" when he pronounced the word "slwlnl," at the
same time touching the wood of the bed on which the
Indian was sitting. Ishi's face suddenly lit up. He re¬
peated the word. The two men, realizing the Importance
of the Incident, went on striking the wood as hard as
they could, shouting "Slwini! Slwlnl!" The mystery had,
to some extent, been solved. The "wild man" had been
Identified as being a member of the Yahi tribe, for a long
time considered extinct. Ishi was no longer a prisoner
of his language. He could now communicate, after a
fashion, with a white man. He was no longer alone, and
his "hunted animal" look disappeared.
What was to be done with this "savage" who could
no longer be kept in goal? The sheriff consented to his
prisoner's transfer to the University of California. By

### 62437: Ishi, the last of the Yanas; a primitive Indian between two worlds

ISHI (Cont'd;
'I have been alone for such a long time'
agreeing to look after Ishi, the professors of this Uni¬
versity were taking on a difficult task. Ishi had come out
of the prehistoric past. He seemed to be just over fifty
years old. Would he be able to adapt himself to the
Industrial civilization of the twentieth century? He was
the last survivor of the Stone Age in the United States.
Late in life, he would have to advance, not through
hundreds, but through thousands of years.
His first ordeal was the train. During his nomadic life*
Ishi had seen this puffing monster from the distance and
his mother had told him that it was a demon with a black
face. Now he must not only approach it, but give himself
up to it. With true Indian courage, Ishi betrayed no fear,
and without hesitation climbed up into his compartment.
During the whole of the trip, he remained absolutely
impassive and did not look at anybody.
12
here were other wonders in store for him at
San Francisco the ferry, the trams, and later,
the cinema and aeroplanes. He showed no emotion or
fear when confronted with these novelties. The strict
Indian etiquette which he Invariably observed, forbade
him to do so. Later, when he was able to communicate
with his friends, he told them of his impressions.
The height of the buildings in San Francisco did not
surprise him at all. They were smaller than the cliffs in
his own country. He was only slightly surprised by aero¬
planes, and their flight seemed to him to be much less
controlled than that of the eagles in his mountains. Of
all the white man's inventions, it was the tramcars,
with their noise and their swift gliding motion, which
struck him as being worthy of admiration. He soon got
to know how to use them, distinguishing them by their
letters and their numbers.
He quickly adapted himself to the white man's way of
living. Shortly after his arrival at San Francisco, he
was invited to lunch. His remarkable powers of obser¬
vation and his sense of etiquette prevented him from
making any mistakes. He was appointed janitorial
assistant at the Museum and was paid by cheque every
month. To cash his cheques, he had to learn how to
endorse them; he did so very quickly.
On being questioned about his knowledge of arithmetic,
he said he could not count beyond ten. Kroeber was very
surprised, therefore, to see Ishi one day arranging the
silver dollars he had saved in equal piles, and being able
to tell him exactly how many coins there were over
eighty in all. Like many "primitives," Ishi found it
pointless to reel off the names of figures without
associating them with particular objects.
Like all "primitives" who have lived in our towns, Ishi
was disconcerted by the number of people who lived
there. When he saw the San Francisco crowds for the
first time, he kept on saying "Many white men! Many
white men!" In this his attitude was in no way different
from that of an Indian Chief from Brazil whom I knew

and who, on his return from Rio de Janeiro, said, "There
are more white people than ants we are done for!"
Faithful to the customs of his tribe, Ishi refused to
reveal his name. To those whose were impolite enough
to ask him what it was, he would reply, "I have been
alone for such a long time that I have forgotten." It
was Kroeber who gave him the name of "Ishi" which in
Yana means "man," since he had to have some form of
legal status.
Ishi's discovery of modern civilization might easily have
been no more than a casual news item, simply showing
that a man from prehistory could adapt himself to the
modern world within a few months. His stay among men
of the twentieth century was, in fact, of primordial
Interest to science.
H e was sole heir to the language, the traditions
I and the history of a human society which had
disappeared forever. Either out of natural kindness, or
gratitude, or even perhaps because he realized that he
was helping to perpetuate the memory of his people, Ishi
tried, as far as he could, to pass on his knowledge to the
ethnographers and linguists who questioned him. He took
particular pleasure in teaching his friends the techniques
from prehistory which had made it possible for him and
his people to survive for so many years.
Before an admiring public, he used to carve flint arrow¬
heads, make fire from two pieces of wood, and make bows
and arrows in the way that had been handed down from
his ancestors. His greatest exploit was the expedition on
which he took his friends through the valleys In which
he had lived with the last of the Yahi and where he had
eventually spent a number of years wandering on his
own. His former enemies, the farmers, gave him a
hearty welcome, and Ishi felt rather ashamed of having
raided their barns in the past. This Journey under
Ishi's guidance gave his companions Insight into the
misery and pleasures of the rough existence led by pre¬
historic Indians.
It was a unique experience for the ethnologists, and
they learnt to see nature through the eyes of a Neolithic
hunter. As Ishi went further and further Into the woods
which he knew so well, old memories came surging up
into his mind. He described to his companions many
Incidents from his youth In the very places In which
they had occurred.
But gradually, the pleasure of finding himself back In
his familiar surroundings gave way to a strange Impa¬
tience to be gone. No doubt the terrible experiences of
the bad days had come crowding In on the happy memo¬
ries of his youth. It was with an eager step that he
climbed up Into the train which was to carry him away
from the lands of his ancestors.
Ishi had an iron constitution, but he had not been
Immunized against the white man's Illnesses, and In
particular, against what, for him, was the most deadly of
these tuberculosis. In spite of the best medical care, it
proved impossible to rid him of the devastating effects of
disease which he contracted during the fourth year of
his stay among the white people. When his friends judged
that his end was near, respecting the Indian tradition
according to which a man should die in his own house,
they had him taken to the Ethnological Museum, his
"home."
Ishi died stoically, without a word of complaint, like the
members of his race. His friends, the ethnologists, felt
that It was their duty to deal with his body as his family
would have done, and accordingly burnt it, together with
his bow. his arrows and his shells. Inscribed on the urn 13
which contains his ashes are the words: "Ishi, the last
Yana Indian. 1916."

### 62622: A Lost civilization emerges from the past; the enigma of the Hittites

he story of the Hittites is a new chapter in the
_ history of the Ancient World. It Is the story
of a people living twenty centuries before the Christian
era who were only recently "discovered" by scholars after
nearly a century of detective work excavation, research
and subtle reasoning.
One hundred years ago the very existence of the Hit¬
tites was little more than a vague surmise. Only during
the past few decades have they emerged from the sha¬
dows. Only since then has their history been recon¬
structed from the records they themselves inscribed and
the meaning of their religion and beliefs been revealed
through painstaking studies of their rock-hewn sculpture.
The wondrous civilizations of the pre-classical Orient
were at least known to the Greeks, both through tradi¬
tional accounts and actual contacts.
But an impenetrable curtain of oblivion had fallen over
ancient Anatolia from the day when the last independent
Anatolian tribes were crushed and then absorbed, first
into the Assyrian and later into the Persian Empire.
We know that in one of his texts Homer makes passing
reference to the people of Ketelol and this we now pre¬
sume to be an allusion to the Hittites, disguised under a
Hellenic label. But the fact is of little value, for the
poet has no precise information to give us nor can he
situate this people within the immensity of Anatolia.
Herodotus, our eloquent informant on the lands and
peoples of the eastern Mediterranean, speaks of the fore¬
bears of classical Lydia and mingles with authentic names
others of far-off dynasties. Among them we find a cer¬
tain Mursilis, a Hittite King who has since become a fami-
lar figure to historians. But of what value is such infor¬
mation more often fable than fact?
Close to ancient Izmir (the Turkish seaport of Smyrna),
however, there are two rock-hewn monuments carved out
by the Hittites. These were known to the Greeks but
were wrongly interpreted by them. The monument at
Karabel, depicting a prince and bearing hieroglyphic ins¬
criptions, was attributed to an entirely fictitious journey
there of the Pharoah Sesostris. The othererroneously
Identified as a NIobe overcome with griefIn reality
marked a sacred spring and was cut Into the side of
Mount Sipylos (today called Manlssa Dagh). Alongside
it, the Hittite writing forming the name of the dedicator
can still be made out.
Deeper in Anatolia, were the mysterious Pontus moun¬
tains which, the Greeks believed, were the home of the
Amazons, those redoutable female warriors who, legend
told, fought on the side of the Trojans and were defeated
after violent struggles by Achilles who slew their queen,
Penthesllela.
The story of the Amazons Is still a complete mystery.
Were they a purely mythical people or an exaggerated
description of some matriarchal society? Some authors
maintain that the legend originated with a false Interpre¬
tation of figures found at Yazlllkaya, near to Bogazkoy
(site of the capital of the Hittite Empire). But it Is a far
cry from the procession of divinities at Yazlllkaya to the
fury of Penthesllela.
It was the Chalybes who, in the mists of Antiquity In
Armenia, were said to have first discovered the secrets of
Iron-working. They in fact gave their name to the Greek
word for steel. Here one discerns a glimmer of historical
truth. Throughout the second millennium B.C., the Hit¬
tites were considered by the peoples of other Eastern
countries as the masters of metal-working who forged
first-quality Iron.
But as the centuries passed, iron-working secrets were
divulged and became known to other peoples. The Hittite
tribes degenerated to a barbarian way of life and when the
military campaigns of Cyrus the Younger brought Xeno-
phon and 10,000 followers into this region at the end of
the 4th century B.C., they found only an unfriendly and
wary people, given to pillage and looting, and living In
hovels of dried earth.
The Hittites are mentioned by name several times In the ,,_
Bible from the Patriarchal period down to the time of '^

### 62622: A Lost civilization emerges from the past; the enigma of the Hittites

THE HITTITES (Cont'd)
Revealing letters in a Pharaoh's archives
the Exile. But these are the Hittites of Syria, all that
remained of the states created by the great kings on the
Euphrates and the Orontes rivers at the time of their
expansion towards the south. These peoples were partly
Semitized and partly Hurrlan. In other words they
belonged to a diverse and lateral branch of the Anatolian
family.
Viewed in the new historical perspective which the most
recent deciphering of texts has opened up, the Hittites of
the Old Testament are in reality Neo-Hittites. Contem¬
poraries of the Assyrians, the Phoenicians and the
Hebrews, they can in no way be said to represent the true
Hittite civilization which flowered between the 19th and
13th centuries B.C. and "which must be sought out in
Central Anatolia.
The "re-discovery" of this people and its civilization
was almost an accident and came about through the
chance and haphazard movement of travel and explora¬
tion. Between 1750 and 1900 many travellers related their
discoveries of monuments bearing inscriptions In an un¬
known writing composed of pictures similar to that of
the Egyptians. These inscriptions were given the name
"hieroglyphics" and, as it later proved, rightly so, for
it has since become certain that the invention of this
writing the work of the Hittites themselves took place
in religious sanctuaries and that it was designed to meet
the needs of religion.
But the meaning of the Hittite hieroglyphs was for long
to remain a mystery. All the efforts to decipher them

HISTORY WRITTEN IN STONE. A feature of the Hittite
religion was the major role played by open-air sanctuaries, the
most celebrated being Yazilikaya close to the former Hittite
capital of Hattusas (the present-day Turkish Village of Boghaz-
koy). From studies of the rock-cut reliefs and inscribed hiero¬
glyphs at Yazilikaya, scholars have been slowly reconstructing
the story of the Hittite people. Left, procession of figures wear¬
ing long pointed caps and carrying scimitars on their shoulders.

failed because scholars were faced by two simultaneous
obstacles: an unknown language In an unknown form of
writing. It was only when another kind of writing,
cuneiform, had been deciphered that it became passible
to tackle the hieroglyphs with the aid of the few existing
bl-llngual texts and also by searching for the keys to the
Hittite language through a careful analysis of monuments.
Begun with some success about 1930 by several scholars
working Independently, this task Is still unfinished. It
was, however, made easier and was stimulated by the dis¬
covery of a Hittite city at Karatepe In 1947. The bilin¬
gual Phoenlcian-Hittltc texts uncovered here Immediately
confirmed the accuracy of earlier work while enabling
minor errors to be corrected. In addition these finds
gave a new impulsion to the work.
The results of the work of deciphering that Is going on
have proved somewhat disappointing to many historians
because the texts have not turned out to be the full and
detailed accounts for which they were hoping. Usually,
the inscriptions arc of local significance, relating events
of limited, personal Interest the dedication of a tem¬
ple, of the construction of a palace, for example. The
numerous Hittite seals generally bear only the signatures
of princes and officials.
I T was not possible to fit the Hittites Into a
I given historical time and space on the basis
of the facts gleaned from the hieroglyphic-Inscribed
monuments. This Information was revealed to the Orien¬
talists In the second half of the 19th century by an
Indirect source.
One of the first important Egyptian texts to be deci¬
phered the Pentaour poem described the Syrian expe¬
dition of Rameses II which ended In the battle of Kadcsh
and the subsequent Egyptlan-IIlttlte peace treaty. This
document at once proved that one of the great Illttlte
kings, Hattuslls III, who concluded the peace treaty with
the Pharoah, reigned at the end of the 14th century B.C.
Parallel to this discovery, the annals of the Assyrians
told the story of the western campaigns of this Mesopo-
tamlan Empire, of Its dealings and quarrels with the
"People of Hattl", and of the later progressive absorp¬
tion of the Neo-Hlttltesthe biblical Sons of Heth. It
soon became clear that the cultural and political heart¬
land of the Hittite people had been In Central Anatolia
and not, as previously supposed, In northern Syria.
The discovery of the Egyptian diplomatic archives at
Tell el Amarna, on the Nile, added what was needed to
complete the previous fragmentary Information. Written
In the cuneiform script of the Babylonian language, they
contained the correspondence which had passed between
the Pharoah (Amcnophis IV) and the minor Syrian and
Palestinian rulers. The Hittites arc mentioned many
times In this correspondence. They appear as enemies
from the north, exerting an ever-growing pressure on the
tiny Semitic kingdoms of the Middle Euphrates and
Orontes.
Thanks to these dated texts, the Hittites now entered
world history and were allotted a place in Its chronology.
One of these letters from Amarna written from an
Anatolian principality, was Inscribed In a new language
the language of the Hittites. At last the scholars were
approaching their goal: a knowledge of the Hittites based
on documents actually written by this people.
All our present knowledge of the Hittite civilization has
been obtained from the royal archives of Hattusas, the
former capital of the empire. Its site near the present-
day Turkish village of Bogazkoy, about 100 miles east of
Ankara, had for many years past attracted travellers,
intrigued by the imposing ruins and rock-cut monuments.
Excavations began there in 1905 under the German
archaeologist, Hugo Winkler. Like much similar work
that was done at that time It was somewhat lacking in
order and method. But to seekers upon whom fortune
smiles all can be forgiven. In the course of several
expeditions thousands of cuneiform clay tablets were 17

In the late summer of 1945, a group of Turkish archaeologists, hunting for traces of
ancient Anatolian civilizations, uncovered the remains of a former Hittite city at Kara-
tepe, on a towering ridge known as the Black Mountain. Subsequent expeditions have
unearthed many statues (above) and reliefs. Among the innumerable inscriptions
brought to light the most significant were bilingual Phoenician texts and Hittite hiero¬
glyphs. These corresponding inscriptions enabled hieroglypic Hittite the unr.-
nown language of an unknown people written in an unknown script to be read.

THE HITTITES (Cont'd)
Unknown languages in a borrowed script
Former Hittite centres in what is now Turkey and northern
Syria. After the collapse of the great Hittite Empire about
1200 B.C. its cultural traditions continued to thrive in
provincial cities for another seven centuries when the last
Hittite city states were absorbed by the Assyrian Empire.
recovered and sent off to the museums of Istanbul and
Berlin.
Interrupted by the First World War, this research was
re-started in earnest at Bogazhoy in 1931 this time care¬
fully and methodically under the direction of a young
German archaeologist Kurt Bittel. These excavations
went on right up to the outbreak of the Second World
War and led to the uncovering of the whole of the Acro¬
polis where the royal library of the Hittite kings (13th
century B.C.) was brought to light. Hundreds of other
tablets found during these expeditions are now conserved
in the Ankara Hittite Museum.
The writing on these clay tablets is a well known ver¬
sion of the classical Babylonian cuneiform, the same one
that has been discovered in all the ancient western sites:
at Amarna, at Tell Atchana, near to Antioch, and above
all, at Ugarit.
This writing is comprehensible to any competent Assy-
riologist, but in this case it had been used to record seve¬
ral languages a fact which immediately created serious
problems for the researchers. At Bogazhoy at least seven
languages figure among the texts of the archives, and by
far the most numerous were those in "Hittite", the offi¬
cial language of the empire.
Fortunately, many international documents (diplomatic
treaties, for example) in Babylonian along with items of
traditional literature originating from Mesopotamia were
also recovered. The meanings of these texts were easily
accessible to Assyriologists and almost immediately
revealed the general outlines of Hittite history.
But the rest of the tablets the major partpresented
Innumerable enigmas which seriously challenged the
shrewdness and skill of scholars. They were required to
decipher from a known writing, languages which were
completely unknown and about whose links no sure
theory could be advanced. The situation was in many
ways comparable to that of contemporary Etruscan stu¬
dies, except for the advantage offered by the existence of
several bilingual texts.
It was a Czech scholar, Friedrich Hrozny who decided
to use a completely unbiased approach and to tackle the
problem of deciphering the texts analytically, working
directly from the evidence even if this should mean a
contradiction of all established views.
After the discovery of some obvious equivalents had
revealed to him the meaning of two or three simple phra¬
ses, he became convinced that the Hittite language
belonged, by the general form of its grammar and part
of its vocabulary to the great Indo-European family of
languages (Indo-Iranian, Greek, Latin, Germanic, Slav,
Celtic, etc.). Ignoring the scepticism of linguists, he went
ahead and translated at his first attempt, and in
masterly fashion, the Code and large sections of the royal
records. Thanks to Hrozny, a new branch of Orientalism
was created.
We can now understand why, through force of circums¬
tances, the archaeological science of Hittitology remained
split into two parallel disciplines for an entire generation.
They were not the same men who deciphered the Hittite
cuneiform writing at Bogazkoy and the Hittite hierogly¬
phic writing in Syria.
These two series of documents correspond to two widely
differing dialects. The "classical" Hittite of the cunei¬
form tablets disappeared without trace after the destruc¬
tion of the Hittite capital around 1200 B.C. The
"Luvian" language of the hieroglyphs, however, continued
to be spoken in the southern part of Asia Minor between
1200 and 500 B.C., surviving in the Lycian language of the
Greek era (in the south west of Anatolia).
An important task awaits the new generation of Hittlto-
loglsts. It is to assemble these individual and dispersed
fragments of knowledge, to complete the publication of
many new texts and to persevere with the deciphering
of the most ancient hieroglyphic monuments whose
riddles still remain unsolved.
Emmanuel Laroche is professor of linguistics at the University
of Strasbourg and a research director at the Ecole Pratique des
Hautes Etudes in Paris. Editor of the Revue Hittite et Asia-
nique, he is the author of works on the Hittites and of many
articles on the languages and civilizations of Asia Minor.

GASTRONOMY FOR THE BOLD
by Ritchie Calder
I N a Congo market, street vendors were selling
' fat, black, hairy, wriggling caterpillars, four
Inches long. These were not live" bait for anglers but food
for human consumption. One shuddered and thought of
the dreadful privations which could reduce people to such
straits. But this .was not the Hunger" Belt of the Congo
and those caterpillars were not starvation rations but, for
Africans, delicacies like shrimps, escargots, or frogs' legs.
In a Bornean longhouse, among the treetops of the jun¬
gle, I had three helpings of a succulent, communal dish.
Some of the ingredients were obvious the saffron rice,
the bits of chicken, the herbs and the peppers, but there
were tasty bits which were unfamiliar. After enjoying the
meal I asked the headman what those were. When he
told me I sneaked down the ladder and was sick in the
undergrowth. The *'tasty bits" were slugs like those
which I had been pulling off my back in the jungle. If
I had not asked, my stomach would not have revolted but
Imagination baulked at self-cannibalism!
In West Africa, ambitious attempts to set up poultry
farms have been expensive failures, because of the local
micro-organisms. In any event, the feast day delicacy
of the local Africans Is not the Christmas or Thanksgiving
turkey but the giant snail. This represents about half-a-
pound of nutriment and Is as appetising as the Callfornlan
mollusc, abalone, an expensive dish on the American
menus.
In the Arabian deserts, the wandering bedouins eat fried
locusts. The locust has been the plague of settled cultiva¬
tions since Biblical times. The insect Is Just a winged
stomach and consumes its own weight of growing crops
In a day. Since a swarm of locusts can weigh thousands
of tons this consumption is devastating.
But desert wanderers do not concern themselves about
what happens to crops hundreds of miles away. To them,
a locust is human food. So much so, that when locust 21

control officers went into the Empty Quarter of Arabia to
stop the locusts before they took off to wreak destruction
In the Soviet Union, Iran, Pakistan and the Middle East,
they had to take sacks of Maria Theresa dollars. They
had to have those coins of 200 years ago fresh-minted as
the only currency the desert tribes would recognize. They
had to bribe them to allow the killing of the locusts.
In Scotland, when I was young, we youngsters used to
sneak Into the back streets to buy and to eat hunks of
seaweed, which to us was as desirable as the candy floss
of a more affluent generation. We had to do it furtively
because It was vulgar, but years later I paid a dollar in a
luxury restaurant for a dish which was only a fancy ver¬
sion of that self-same seaweed.
hose are examples of what is really meant by
saying "One man's meat Is another man's
poison." In rare cases the expression may be true; there
are food allergies by which otherwise innocent edibles like
strawberries, or eggs, or chocolates can have serious and
even fatal effects on some individuals. Mostly, however,
our likes and dislikes are dictated by habits or by Imagi¬
nation (or the lack of it) or by taboos and our reactions
are not biochemical but psychological like my slug-
sickness in Borneo.
They are none the less real because of that. Even in a
famine, religious vegetarians will die rather than eat meat,
as also will rice-eaters rather than eat wheat. A world-
eminent free-thinklng professor, a long way removed from
the sacred sanitary laws of the Leviticus, can never force
himself to eat ham or pork; his stomach refuses to break
the rules of his upbringing.
One of the most appetising and worthwhile fish Is
mackerel but the fishermen of my part of the world who
catch mackerels and sell them will never eat them
because (quite untruly) they are supposed to feed on the
corpses of seamen. In Thailand, pretty well off for food,
mothers harm themselves, their unborn infants and their
suckling children by barring a whole range of fruits and
vegetables because they are fetish symbols but no part
of their Buddhist religion.
Another food-discriminator is snobbery. No one will eat
something called "dog-fish" (Squalus acanthias) but call
It "rock-salmon" on the menu and everyone is happy.
None of us would really enjoy the notion of eating
reptiles but the great feature of the Lord Mayor of
London's banquet is real turtle soup and a turtle is, of
course, a reptile. Similarly, we recoil from an egg which
is "off" but when we have a Chinese meal we will eat
addled turtle eggs and "bird's-nest soup," which is bird-
spittle mucilage (and perfectly good protein) secreted
from the salivary glands of swifts. Kangaroo-tails are
served in the British House of Lords. Crocodile-tails are
delicacies to Africans, just as the palms of the polar bear
paws are to the Eskimos. Sharks fins are shipped to the
Chinese but the food-thrifty Japanese eat shark-meat and
get rich vitamins from the sharks' liver.
When oysters in the days of Charles Dickens, were the
food of the poor of London, the rich did not eat them.
Now the rich eat them and the poor cannot afford them.
In expensive Western stores, one can buy bottled ants and
silkworm conserves made of the cocoons, once the silk
has been unwrapped.
One can buy jars of manna, from the Biblical wilderness.
It may not be the manna of the Exodus but It is the
saccharin excretion of an aphis which drinks the dew on
the tamarisks of the Sinai and the Negev. The excretion
dries like sugary snowflakes and drifts over the desert.
Where and when food is abundant, taste can afford to
be selective. In the land of Feast and Famine, among the
Eskimos, if the caribou-kill is high, they will feast off the
tongues and throw the meat to dogs. Come the famine,
and they will ration the offal and split the bone for the
marrow. In Wyoming, they boast "We cut out the steak
and throw away the steer." In Britain, unwanted milk
Is poured into disused coalmines.

FAO - Eric Schwab WHAT'S ON THE MENU? Food habits and the nutritive value of the vast variety of foods on the world's
menu are nowadays carefully studied in research institutes. Below, foodstuffs from all over the world, col¬
lected for testing in a British research institute. Changing diet habits are reflected (above) In fish pond
development schemes to provide more proteins for people of Indonesia. Working towards a more rational
use of world food resources, a joint Food and Agriculture-World Health Organization commission Is now
compiling a Codex Alimentäres, a collection of international food standards to help harmonize the existing ones.
But there is another kind of waste: Where people like
things (giant snails for Instance) which seem a bit
eccentric why should we try to Impose conventional foods
upon them? These may be the new foods. With all his
science, modern man has not been very enterprising.
Practically every food animal we know was domesticated
in prehistoric times. Of course, we have Improved the
breeds and the yields until a farm-animal has become an
agrofactory but we have not much extended the range.
Why not domesticate the sea-cow, the manatee or its
kin, the dugong? The manatee Is a substantial creature In
terms of sea-cow sirloins, because It can grow as much as
25 feet in length. It Is oceanic but It favours estuaries
and might be coaxed or adapted to the freshwater environ¬
ment of the great rivers. It has one especial virtue. It
Is the one creature, It seems, which Is prepared to feed
off the water hyacinth. If this seems to put It In the cate¬
gory of the famous Ferdinand, the Bull, which preferred
flowers to fighting, It should be explained that the wild
hyacinth, with its delicate blue blossom bobbing on the
waters, Is no choice bouquet. This Is one of the world's
scourges.
In the South American rivers where the water hyacinth
belongs, It is quite well-behaved, but when it has been
introduced by design (how nice to have it In our pool!)
or by accident (in ship's bilges) into Africa or Asia it has
become a plague. It chokes the great rivers, blocking the
channels, and smothering dams. It cannot be got rid of
by weedkillers because they would imperil the fish or the
useful plant life. It has to be cut and dredged out by
physical effort. But the manatee loves It and could pro¬
cess the pest Into excellent meat and oil.

### 62645: How you can help the fight against hunger

HOW YOU CAN HELP THE FIGHT AGA
NEXT month a "World Freedom from
Hunger Week" will mark the mid¬
point of the "Freedom from Hunger
Campaign" (1960-65) led by the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
with the support of the United Nations
and its Specialized Agencies. The pur¬
pose of this world-wide campaign is, in
the words of Dr. B. R. Sen, Director-
General of FAO, "to inform and educate
the public about the challenge which
faces mankind and to act as a forum
where the aspects of hunger, poverty
and economic stagnation can be discuss¬
ed and remedies found, and as a base
and a starting point for action projects
to solve these problems."
"World Freedom from Hunger Week"
centering on the equinoctial date of
Thursday, March 21, symbol of spring
and sowing in the Northern Hemisphere
and of harvesting and thanksgiving in the
Southern will be a major opportunity
for public participation in the Campaign.
While the Campaign covers every
possible approach to the problem of
hunger (see the special July-August 1962
issue of The Unesco Courier) action
is chiefly concentrated in four areas:
information and education, fund-raising,
research programmes and action projects.
To help the Campaign, Unesco is
carrying out a broad educational and
information programme which has two
goals:
1 In the more fortunate countries to
bring about a basic understanding of the
problem of hunger and what can be
done about it.
' In the less developed countries, to
give the people knowledge that will
enable them to increase food production,
improve diets and in general achieve a
higher standard of living.
The Freedom from Hunger Campaign
has also become a natural addition to
Unesco's Gift Coupon Programme
which, in the past ten years, has combin¬
ed education and exchange of information
among peoples around the world with
fund-raising that has made possible the
purchase of more than one million dollars
for educational and scientific equipment.
UNESCO is now inviting individual
people and organizations in some 18
donor countries (see box page 25) to
contribute directly to action projects
which enable people of other countries
to improve food production. Unesco
Gift Coupons can be used to buy equip¬
ment and supplies for virtually any type
of activity under the Freedom from
Hunger Campaign. The following,
however, are the main projects:
WATER SUPPLY EQUIPMENT: In¬
expensive well-digging equipment, wind¬
lasses and buckets can spell the
difference between a good living and
mere subsistence in many cases where
water lies only a few feet underground.
fARM TOOLS: In vast, underdeveloped
regions the only farm tool known is the
short-handled hoe. A small investment
can provide breaking ploughs, spades,
forks, shovels and rakes, with a resulting
boost to -agricultural production.
BETTER SEED: The saying, "Good seed
doesn't cost it pays", reflects the fact
that the use of better seed varieties is
a cheap and effective way of increasing
productivity.
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENS:
Purchase of tools and seeds at small
cost, matched by local labour produces
extra food supplies and guides young
people and families to better diets.
NUTRITION AND HOMECRAFT CEN¬
TRES: Poor diet is often caused as much
by ignorance as by poverty. For teaching
families to make better use of their
resources, the purchase of kitchen equip¬
ment and training aids can pay large
dividends.
MOBILE VETERINARY LABORATORIES:
These have vital roles in identifying and
controlling costly livestock diseases and
serving as instruction centres.
POULTRY RAISING: In many areas
shortage of proteins can be best met by
increasing egg and poultry production.
Unesco Gift Coupons can provide the
necessary equipment.
FISH PONDS AND FISHING EQUIP¬
MENT: An important source of protein
food, fish ponds can often be operated
simultaneously with some other type of
food production.
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION: Books,
supplies and equipment are needed to
help transmit knowledge from one gener-

Then there is the hippopotamus. We call it "the river
horse" but it is a pachydermatous, non-ruminating,
artlodactyl ungulate in other words, underneath the two-

tons of excellent pig-meat. A rasher of hippo would
provide a meal for a family.
If you can't lick 'em, join 'em! If you cannot domes¬
ticate wild animals, conserve them. That is a good thing
in itself because the world Is in danger of losing its noble
animals by stupid destruction. But conservation has other
commendations. Protected animals multiply beyond the
resources of their natural habitat, and in the interests of
their kind, they have to be culled selectively killed, just
as the sensible cutting of trees improves a forest. In
Africa, this would preserve the species for posterity and
protein for the people.
24 Conservation as against domestication has other values.
The increase of flocks and herds on savannah ranges (as
in East Africa) can destroy the herbiage and start erosion
into desert. Cattle and sheep are grazers; they eat only
from the ground but they crop everything close. Nature
has budgeted more intelligently. There are the rooting
animals, like the warthog, which get their food below the
surface and the many types of deer and antelopes which
graze but are non-competitive in the types of plants they
eat. There are the browsing animals which dine off
shrubs and bushes and there are the giraffes and elephants
which can help themselves from the trees. It is self-
service on four floors! No biotechnical efficiency-expert
could improve on that.
Where we have been least effective in our harvesting
of food Is in terms of the sea. Seven-tenths of our planet
is covered by oceans. Davy Jones' Locker is a vast food-
hamper. The nutrient material produced annually by the
sea amounts to one hundred billion tons of which only
thirty million tons, the world over, are recovered as edible
fish. This contrasts with the billion tons of vegetable

the effects of the Campaign.
Like other Unesco Gift Coupon
projects, the one designed to support
the Freedom from Hunger Campaign
stresses direct "people-to-people" relation¬
ships. Both to donors and beneficiaries,
the contacts through Unesco Gift Cou¬
pons have brought new knowledge and
real friendship for the people of other
nations.
Three years ago the students at The
Queen Elizabeth School for Girls near
London raised £400 for Unesco Gift

Jericho, afterwards raising another £300
to bring a teacher to England for addition¬
al training.
Recently the girls of the same school
became the first group in the world to
contribute to the Unesco Gift Coupon
Programme for the Freedom from Hunger
Campaign. The Gift Coupons they bought
have been sent to schools in Burma to
buy seeds, fertilizer and garden tools.
Writing to Unesco, these English girls
recalled the friendships they had made
with Arab refugee children and added:
"We now look forward to doing the
same thing in Burma and we are glad to
take part in the Freedom from Hunger
Campaign. We much enjoy our own
gardens here in England, and we like to
think that others will learn to use their
land more creatively and to enjoy more
fully its products and their riches."

THE HIDDEN FACE OF THE CINEMA Pt
AN AUDIENCE
OF 12,000,000,000
by Paul Léglise
The article below is the third in a series describing lesser-
known aspects of the cinema industry and based on a
world-wide survey by Paul Léglise. In previous articles
the author analyzedthe complex operations of production
and distribution. Here he discusses the problems of film
presentation, the impact of an ever-expanding television
industry on films, and the important roles played by
film libraries and film clubs in the world of the cinema.
DRIVE-IN CINEMAS. There are no parking prob¬
lems for these cinema-goers in the United States.
They take their cars right inside a huge open-air
enclosure, a "drive-In" cinema, and watch the show
projected on a vast screen without having to leave
their vehicles. There are over 5,000 U. S. "drive-
ins" and the vogue is spreading to other countries.
We-have followed the path of films from the
production studios through the channels of
distribution and now find them in the hands of the
exhibitors who will present them to the public a vast
public, the 12,000 million people who pay for admission
to cinemas each year.
Leaving aside, for the moment, the audiences at
specialized film shows, let us take a closer look at the
normal, commercial cinemas. The figures are striking.
Europe tops the list (1960 figures) with 110,000 cinemas
and 35 million seats. Then comes America with 40,000
cinemas and 14 million seats, followed by Asia with 20,000
cinemas and eight million seats. Africa has 3,000 cinemas
and two million seats. World box-office receipts in 1960
totalled 3,000 million dollars.
These totals are certainly Impressive and yet a definite
drop in cinema attendance has been observed. There is
no need to look far for one of the major causes of this
drain on the cinema public. It is the result of the vast
expansion of television. However, when a certain level of
saturation has been reached the situation should become
stabilized, if this has not already become apparent in
some countries.
Even so. this declining spiral cannot be ignored. It has
been particularly obvious In the United Kingdom where
over a five year period box-office receipts dropped by one
halffrom £1,182 million in 1955 to £580 million in 1960.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the number of
spectators fell from 817 million in 1956 to 620 million in
1960 with a 15% reduction In receipts. Similar trends
were observed in Belgium (from 110 million spectators
in 1955 to 90 million in 1960), the Netherlands (from 70
26 million in 1956 to 55 million in 1960), Austria (from 122
to 110 million) and In Canada (from receipts of 160 million
dollars In 1953 to 60 million in 1959).
In France it looked at one time as though this decline
might halt and the situation become stabilized. In 1959
there were 354 million spectators and receipts of 595
million new francs; in 1960, 354 million spectators,
representing 662 million new francs. The following year,
however, there was a' decline 326 million spectators and
receipts of 644 million new francs which thus extended
the downward trend noted since 1957 and amounting to a
drop of 85 million spectators.
The United States (where television developed earlier
and on a larger scale than elsewhere) experienced a
decrease in film-going up to 1957, since when a proportion
of the lost ground is apparently being recovered: from
2,000 million spectators (1957) to 2,228 million (1960) with
receipts rising from $1,110 million dollars to $1,370 million.
This world-wide evolution and fluctuation in film-going
is not only due to the growth of television, but to many
other factors whose detailed analysis is the province of
economic and sociological studies. In particular a
comparison between these statistics and the pyramid of
age-groups in each country would provide interesting and
revealing conclusions.
Nevertheless the decisive effect of the cinema-television
rivalry is clearly apparent. Yet the evolution favourable
to the cinema in the United States shows us that by
adapting cinematographic art and industry to the new
economic conditions created by this competition, by
emphasizing the advantages of the large (cinema) screen
over the small (TV) screen, the cinema can manage to
keep its public until a period of more constructive co¬
operation comes in sight.
Screens are being blown up in size, the format of films
themselves Is being increased from 35 mm. to 70 mm. so
as to improve the technical quality of the image, stere-
phonic sound fills cinemas from all sides. We are today

close to the cinematographic visions of Aldous Huxley,
and Abel Gance, the French pioneer of filming techniques
Is now revealed as a true prophet of the seventh art thirty
years ahead of his time.
To overcome the present crisis the cinema must change
radically, break with routine and present its spectacles
in new ways. Some idea of what is already being done can
be gathered from a U.S. Trade Department report. This
reveals that In the U.S.A. films were screened In 12,300
cinemas in 1961 and also in 5,000 "drive-Ins": open-air
cinemas where the film is projected on a vast screen
watched by patrons sitting in their cars.
Drive-ins account for 25% of total cinema receipts in
the United States. In Canada, while the number of
ordinary 35 mm. cinemas declined in one year from 1,451
to 1,383 (at the end of 1961), drive-ins increased by four
and numbered 236 at the same date.
Among other film projection innovations, a striking
advance was made by "Cinerama" which operated In 30
cinemas In the United States and in 24 abroad by the
end of 1961 and which planned to have a total of 60
cinemas so equipped in the United States and 40 abroad
by the end of 1962. The Soviet "Kinopanorama" is acquir¬
ing new cinemas and is also extending abroad, and in
Czechoslovakia, "Polyecran" has begun to develop.
Because of these new forms of film presentation we
have to be extra cautious when dealing with statistics,
especially when compiling lists of cinemas which do not
have either the same capacity or the same number of
programmes. There is no common measure between
"Theatroramas," drive-ins and country cinemas. Even
the ordinary cinema cannot be calculated In district units.
Even in countries which are clnematographically well-
equipped the distribution and screening of films raises
many serious problems. When we learn that since 1929
money spent on entertainment only accounts for 2% of
consumer Income In the United States wc may well wonder
what new and greater difficulties we can expect to find
In countries now In the throes of development.
Unesco has undertaken a large-scale survey of the
present state of Information media In the underdeveloped
countries. What do we understand by "underdeveloped?"
According to a United Nations definition, a country Is
underdeveloped when the average per-caplta Income Is
less than 300 dollars per year.
In 1961, Unesco submitted a report to the Human Rights
Commission and the Economic and Social Council of the
United Nations (See The Unesco Courier, June 1902) on
the problems Involved In granting technical assistance to
underdeveloped countries to help them expand their in¬
formation media (press, radio, cinema and television). In
addition, regional meetings on the same problems have
already been held In Bangkok (I960) for South East Asia,
at Santiago, Chile (1961) for Latin America and In ParLs
(1962) for Africa.
The basic goal for all these countries In the field of
Information Is to make sure that for every 100 Inhabitants
there are at least ten copies of dally papers, five radio
sets, two cinema seats and two television sets. The fact
that 70% of the world's population does not have access
to even this strict minimum of Information resources
bring the Immensity of the task Into true perspective.
Even so, these criteria are somewhat summary and only
partially convey the facts of the problem. They fall to
take Into account, for example, the situation with regard
to population distribution and do not reveal the possibili¬
ties opened up by the travelling cinema thanks to
specially-equipped trucks. They do make possible,
however, a tentative approach to the problem.

CINEMA (Cont'd)
Ingmar Bergman
first 'discovered' by
a film club in Uruguay
27 Asian countries had a total of 7,673 cinemas (equipped
for 16 mm. or 35 mm. screening) with a total seating
capacity of just over 5,200,000 (.7% per inhabitant). The
average annual cinema attendance per inhabitant was 2,8
times. In Latin America the picture was brighter with
12,847 cinemas having a capacity of seven million seats
(3.5% per inhabitant). Annual attendance here was 4.9
times per inhabitant. In the African countries covered
by the survey there were 2,400 cinemas with 1,300,000 seats
(0.5% per Inhabitant) and the average annual attendance
was less than once In most countries).
Thanks to Unesco's studies and surveys, the U.N. Eco¬
nomic and Social Council will be able to draw up a balance
sheet of the material, financial and professional needs as
well as the resources available to meet them. The aim is
to launch a development programme under which the
advice of specialists will be made available, scholarships
granted, seminars arranged and equipment and installa¬
tions supplied where they are most needed.
Let us turn for a moment to the type of pro¬
gramme offered In the commercial cinemas.
Generally It is made up of a feature-length film, a short
and a newsreel. Short films and newsreels are sometimes
a compulsory part of the programme. In Brazil, for
example, a decree dating from 1946 makes the inclusion
of a newsreel and. a documentary or other short film
obligatory.
In India, every cinema is obliged, under the terms of
Its licence to operate, to Include in each programme up
to 2,000 feet of film, approved by the Films Advisory
Board as documentary, scientific or cultural films or as
dealing with matters of current interest. Thus, 50% of
all Indian cinemas receive a documentary each week on
the basis of a rental not exceeding 1% of average net
receipts, and the other 50% a newsreel on the samé terms.
Elsewhere, such films are sometimes provided free of
charge. Some cinemas offer a complete programme of
newsreels and shorts, as for example, the "Cinébrefs" in
Switzerland, or solely of shorts, as in some Czechoslovak
cinemas.
While short films are generally obtained through the
normal distributors, the newsreel circuits are mostly
Independent. The production firm Itself distributes films
of 10-12 minutes average duration. In most cases there
is a weekly edition but the rate of issue .may be less
frequent. Copies of newsreels are only used for from
four to six weeks and this necessitates a large number of
copies and a very rapid amortization.
In the field of the specialist cinema there has been a
great expansion of "re-run" programmes composed of film
"classics." And alongside this movement another trend
is currently taking shape the growth of art or experi¬
mental cinemas. The programmes offered by these
cinemas Include recent films of the kind that is not expect¬
ed to meet with a large commecial success if exploited
through normal channels. Foreign films are shown in the
original version with subtitles.
The managers of such cinemas belong to an Interna¬
tional Federation of Art and Experimental Cinemas which
already has members In many countries including Austria,
Belgium, France, the German Federal Republic, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom. The existence of 80 cinemas of this kind in
the German Federal Republic, 50 in France and 20 or so
in Japan all point to the significance of this movement
which is becoming a real force internationally.
In France the movement has already received official
recognition through a law which enables cinemas to seek
classification within an "art and experimental" category
30 on the basis of their having projected films meeting speci¬
fic criteria for over one year. Films covered by this law
Include those of obviously high quality, but which have

not met with the success they deserve, research films,
films showing life in countries whose films are rarely
distributed In France and programmes entirely devoted to
short films. Cinemas recognized under this law enjoy tax
concessions and are released from some of the regulations
that normally apply to cinemas in France.
Another form of specialized commercial exhibiting is
the recreational cinema for young people. These pro¬
grammes are not presented In special cinemas but are
merely shows suited to or reserved for young people.
Programmes classed as suitable for juvenile audiences are,
in fact, ordinary programmes open to anyone. However,
some countries have decided on various measures to en¬
courage the showing of these types of films: tax
concessions (Finland, the German Federal Republic, Gua¬
temala, Norway, Denmark, India) or bonuses to the
exhibitor (Italy, Argentine).
So far we have been considering the 12,000 million
spectators who make up the cinema industry's normal
clientele. There is also another film public whose numbers
can never be calculated, even approximatively. A vigo¬
rous and ever-expanding sector which caters to a variety
of tastes, it comprises first and foremost the film clubs.
These film clubs show and discuss films which stand out
in the history of the cinema or more recent productions
which have not met with success on the normal cinema
circuits. They help to establish cinematographic values
and to clarify and formulate the doctrines of a continually-
evolving cinema. It was, for example, the Ciné-Club del
Uruguay, which first "discovered" the artistic skill of
Ingmar Bergman through the screening of his film,
"Sommarlek."
The history of these clubs goes back to about 1920.
Since then they have spread throughout the world in
France under the influence of Louis Delluc, just as in
Brazil where, as long ago as 1917, a group of young people
gathered under the guidance of the critic Pedro Lima, and
the historian Adhemar Gonzaga. Today they are grouped
in an International Film Club Federation which includes
representatives from countries in every continent.
There are also many cultural associations, often peri-
school and post school, which attempt to satisfy the
demands of a public eager to learn more about the cinema
as a form of artistic expression. Within this category we
find a wide variety of film presentations of a basically

processes. An example of the second kind is shown
here, taken from a microcinematographic film made by
H. A. Traber of Zurich. These photos illustrate several
phases in the development of the egg cell of an Alpine

of one week they reveal how the newly-fertilized egg (1)

educational type. In the Soviet Union, for example,
documentary and popular science films are screened free
in clubs and cultural centres, In factory workshops during
work-breaks, in schools, public places and parks, and even
in the courtyards of residential buildings. It has been
estimated that as many as 300,000 people benefit from
such sessions every day.
In Japan, about 100 private firms distribute films of this
kind as also do two national film libraries which between
them dispose of 10,000 prints. In addition 642 regional or
local film libraries have 33,000 copies available for distribu¬
tion. In 1958, 24,000 projectors for 16 mm. sound films
were being used to screen educational films.
When we add to these figures others relating to the
activities of 5,000 film libraries in the U.S. which distribute
films for the 600,000 projectors owned by film clubs, univer¬
sities and the huge range of associations In this country,
we get some idea of the immensity of the world public
which sees film shows in the non-commercial sector.
I N this field of the cinema a major place Is filled
I by educational films. These have their place In
a wider context of audio-visual media used in education.
Films are used to make a specific contribution and
cannot always replace wall-charts, filmstrlps or school
television.
In Italy, for example, 8,000 projectors for 16 mm. films
are available In the schools and thus create a potential
audience of six million students. To supply this nation¬
wide network, ten thousand copies comprising one
thousand film titles are in circulation under the co-ordina¬
tion of the "National Centre for Audio-Visual Aids" which
operates through 92 provincial film libraries.
Another rapidly expanding area of distribution Is that
of the Industrial film. Where formerly these films were
simply loaned by the firms that had ordered them, there
is now a well-organized network of screenings for a large
public Interested in such questions.
Scientific and art films nowadays constitute other major
specialized distribution networks. In Brussels, an Inter¬
national scientific film library has been set up, and It was
also in Brussels, in July 1958, that a symposium of mu
seum, film and TV specialists arranged by Unesco, empha¬
sized the need: "to encourage museums at a certain level
to equip themselves with projection rooms for 35 mm.
sound films and museums at all levels to acquire 16 mm.
sound projection equipment." Films should unquestion¬
ably become an Instrument at the service of museums,
both for documentation and analysis.
So far we have dealt with the planning of a film. Its
actual production and subsequent distribution. What
happens to a film when it has done the job for which it
was designed? What happens to It when It has earned
the expected financial return and covered production
costs?
Generally speaking film rights run for seven to ten years
with the possibility of renewal. Sometimes when a film
has won great commercial success, another producer may
purchase the rights for the purpose of a re-make of the
same story. In this case, copies of the old film are
destroyed.
Copies of a film are also destroyed when its exhibiting
life comes to an end. The chances are that the negatives
will be allowed to deteriorate. Sometimes a film has a
recognized artistic value and thus Is considered to be of
historic Interest. In this case the rights are renewed and
the film is "revived" In re-run cinemas or film clubs.
This raises another problem. How to preserve copies
of the best films and, whenever possible, the basic elements
needed to print new copies? Newsreel companies are.
fortunately, scrupulously careful In maintaining their
archives and these constitute an invaluable historical
record of events both great and small. Other films are
generally conserved In depository film libraries which are
the real "museums" ot the film world. More often than
not these are the creation of pioneers to whom future
generations will be grateful.
National authorities should take a greater interest in
this problem and. as In the case of books, they should
require duty copies of films to be deposited. Unesco and
the International Film and Television Council are working
Jointly on this question, for which rapid and effective
solutions should be found.
Museums, libraries and other repositories have been 31
given an honoured status in the modern world. Film
archives deserve a place of equal Importance.

### 62630: Gastronomy for the bold

GASTRONOMY FOR THE BOLD (Cont'd from page 25)
Food from unsuspected sources
produce, and one hundred million tons of animal protein,
farmed from the land surface.
Since the early Chinese, and through the mediaeval
monasteries with their carp ponds, we have had inland
fish farms (still not enough) but as far as the sea is
concerned we are still at the Cave Man stage of hunting
our sea-food. We have not domesticated the sea creatures
nor husbanded nor harvested the sea-pastures.
The Idea of sea-ranching"The Riders of the Purple
Kelp"Is not in the least absurd. We could herd the sea-
creatures. (We might even train the intelligent dolphins
to be the collie-dogs of the oceans.) Sir Allster Hardy,
the distinguished marine biologist, once conjured up, in
a scientific assembly, the vision of frogmen "riding the
fences" of the sea-ranches, driving submarine tractors,
harrowing the starfish (which are the marine pests, eating
four times as much food as the edible fish) and ploughing
up the bottom of the sea.
B;[tjt one does not need to be that fanciful. The
'herding could be done by electrical devices.
The harrowing could be done by mechanical drags which
would comb out the starfish and recover them as poultry-
food.
The ocean floor could be ploughed by remote-controlled
tractors. Why plough? Because the bottom of the sea is a
great compost heap. It contains stagnant nutrients in
abundance so much so that the idea of artificial fertilizers
for the sea, which has engaged a lot of thought, is
redundantAll that is needed is to stir the nutrients so
that they circulate in the layers where grow the submarine
vegetation and the plankton which are the diet of the
edible fish.
This would encourage sea-pastures for other purposes
as well. The Japanese, Industriously searching for
means of feeding their multiplying population, have
already discovered uses for some 10,000 different kinds of
seaweed. Some of it is used as fertilizers for land crops,
producing food at one remove, but many of them have
been processed for direct human consumption. They can
be attractively packaged (like breakfast cereals) and if one
does not mind "corn-flakes" coloured green with a flavour
of iodine, or black "potato crisps" with the salt built-in,
substitutes from seaweed are palatable and nutritious.
We could have sea-farming in fiords and enclosed sea-
basins. The trouble is that one cannot clip the wings of
fish as one clips the wings of poultry to prevent them from
migrating but it should be possible to fence some of those
Inlets. Just as a single wire with a harmless charge of
electricity will discourage land animals from straying, an
electric current beamed across the exit would discourage
the fish from leaving. They would remain to multiply and
grow.
There are also floating pastures of minute plant-
plankton and swarms of animal-plankton. So far we have
found no effective way of harvesting this suspended
vegetation and animal material. We might, however, study
the whale which swims along gobbling plankton, squeezing
out water and converting the material into 70 tons of
meat, bone and blubber. Perhaps we could devise a
mechanical, atom-propelled "whale" as our combine
harvester of the sea!
N ow we come back to likes and dislikes: Who
would choose to eat plankton? But we can
give all such things, whether the wasted sustenance of
the sea or the waste proteins of the land, a gastronomical
anonymity. When we eat meringues and some kinds of
ice-cream, we never recognise them as algenates, extract-
32 ed from seaweed. Fish-fingers beautifully packaged out
of the deep-freeze may be fish from which one would
recoil if one saw it on a fishmongers' slab.
Deep-seated objections, like religious taboos, are more
difficult to overcome. The Indians who prefer a vege¬
tarian diet would be better off with meat-protein but there
is no need to offend their religious convictions nor to
convert them to meat. At the Food Research Institute at
Mysore, they have produced a multi-purpose food. Ten
teaspoonfuls has the nutritive value of one quarter of a
pound of meat, a baked potato, a dish of lentils and a
glass of milk, all added together.
It is made from indigenous products peanut flour,
Bengal gram, calcium and vitamins. It is cheap and it
can be added to the chapatis, the curries, or any of the
habitual diets. Similarly they have produced "tapioca-
macaronL" This uses cassava, a root easily grown but

of poor nutritive value but It can be combined with
25% wheat semolina, and 15% groundnut flour, with
fortification of calcium and vitamin. It can (as a pasta)
be made into any shape, including that of rice-grains; it
is much more nutritious than rice and it can be cooked in
seven minutes an important point because village cook¬
ing means burning cow-dung.
Recently Dr. Melvin Calvin was awarded the Nobel Prize
for having, with the help of radioactive tracers, worked
out the complete cycle by which the growing-plant takes
the energy from the sun, the elements from the air and
the minerals from the soil and converts them into the
sugars and starches of our basic foodstuffs. He has given
us the flow-sheet of a chemical process which we could
reproduce in chemical engineering.
Work is also going on, notably in the U.S.S.R. on the
further stages by which the plants produce the proteins
necessary for the repair and growth of the human tissues.
Foreseeably, we could start with the elements themselves,
cut out the intermediates, of the soil, the plants and the
animals which eat them in order to feed us, and make
our food as a druggist compounds a prescription.
It really is not necessary. We have the know-how of
growing more, and using better, the crops and animals so
that hungry people could be fed. We have the science.
What we need is the imagination and the intention.

### IGNORE

Letters to the Editor
SPECIAL ISSUES
VS. VARIED ONES
Sir,
In a recent issue (Sept. 1962) you
asked for readers' views on your new
editorial policy of publishing a greater
variety of articles. I feel that there
are already enough "digest" type of
publications which offer short and
unrelated articles, and that your former
policy was the right one. An issue of
your magazine presenting several
articles on the same theme has a
far greater informative value than a
constellation of articles on different
subjects.
Jean-Marc Tapernoux
Berne, Switzerland
Sir,
I do not agree with issues wholly
devoted to one theme since it tends
to leave one confused after reading
approximately 40 pages of "meaty"
material. A scholastic teenager does
not always have the time to sit and
read the magazine from cover to
cover. Therefore it is far better from
his or her point of view to read one
article of, say, ten pages, put the
magazine down and later pick it up
to read another article of similar
length. In this way a balanced know¬
ledge is gained on different subjects.
David H. Sharpless
Leatherhead, Surrey, England
Sir,
We find special issues far more
interesting because (1) there are
already enough magazines with a
multi-subject policy; the effect is to
distract one's attention until finally
one remembers very little of their
contents. (2) a special issue is an
easily accessible source of information
on a specific subject.
Mr. and Mrs. R. Talmon
Gagny, France
Sir,
I do not like the whole journal
being given over to one item since
this on occasion means when the
subject is of no interest to me that
the -whole issue is wasted. If,
however, there are subsidiary articles
it is seldom that there is nothing of
interest to me.

MORE & BIGGER NUMBERS
Sir,
As The Unesco Courier increases
the appetite of the reader by its every
issue, I would like to see the volume
or/and the number of issues increased
to quench the ever-rising voracious
appetite for knowledge.
S. Shiva Ramu

Ed. note : Unfortunately, budget¬
ary considerations make it impossible
for The Unesco Courier to increase
the number of its pages or/and the
number of issues per year.
PHILOSOPHER & EDUCATOR
Sir,
All your readers must be pleased
to note the importance you attach to
the rejuvenation of education as shown
by the opportunities you have given
them to discover the work accom¬
plished in this field by Tagore and
Geheeb. Some, however, must have
wondered why the new educational
method of Rudolf Steiner has not been
described, or even mentioned, even
though many Rudolf Steiner schools
exist today in Europe. America and
even in South Africa. No less surpris¬
ing is the fact that no mention was
made of the Rudolf Stcincr centenary
when this was celebrated in 1961
(Tagore's centenary year, too).
I should like to point out that the
new method of education is inspired
by the need to renew educational
"thinking" through recourse to the
universal well springs. You quote
Goethe quite readily and the work
of Rudolf Steiner is a continuation
of his ideas.
Many of your readers seem to be
searching for a great figure to point
out the road to them in these difficult
times. They should become acquaint¬
ed with the profound work of Rudolf
Steiner.

born in 1861 and died in 1925. His
works are concerned with an explana¬

nature of man. He also wrote many
works on Goethe.
A WORK MISNAMED
Sir,
May I call your attention to a
translator's error in your September
1962 number. In Karl Ruhrberg's
informative article on Gerhard
Hauptmann, the translation of "Der
Ketzer von Soana" is given as "The
Criminal of Soana." The correct
English title of the story is "The
Heretic of Soana." The translator
was ltayard Quincy Morgan. 1 pub¬
lished it, as indeed I did the large
body of Hauplmann's novels and
dramas, in English.

FIGARO
A BARROW BOYS' FAVOURITE
Sir.
In your biased and superficial
account of "Society Calls the Tunc"
in your November 1962 issue, you
state that "The abstract and 'learned'
classical music of two centuries ago
was written for the pleasure and
appreciation of a cultured minority
audience."
Has I'cter Lengycl never heard of
"Die Zauberflotc", a singspicl
composed for a working class
audience in 1791 by W.A. Mozart?
Again, docs he not know that every
barrow-boy in Prague used to whistle
airs from "Lc Nozzc di Figaro" by
the same great composer when it
was first performed in the Bohemian
capital?
There is a current fashion which
suggests that all eighteenth-century
art was "capitalist"; "rococco";
"flirtatious"; "trite". These epithets
arc applied only by those who do
not appreciate in the slightest degree
the folk traditions that were so strong
in the art of the time, e.g. Vier-
zchuheiligcn. Wits, Zauberflotc and
others, to quote both architectural
and musical examples.
It is the earnest and humourless
young men of today who do not
feel or appreciate the ecstasies the
geniuses of two centuries ago produc¬
ed. An appreciation for humanity
and above all, humour, would be
invaluable to the pretentious ideo¬
logists who denounce baroque civiliz¬
ation so often today.

FREEDOM FROM HUNGER
Sir,
Your special double issue on
"Freedom from Hunger" (July/
August 1962) is a tremendous job,
and you should be both congratu¬
lated and thanked for it. It says most
effectively what needs saying right
now about the problem

organizations, including issues dating back
to the days of the League of Nations in
1922, has been opened in Geneva by the
European Office of the United Nations.
AFRICAN WOMEN IN UZBEKISTAN:
Women from 17 countries and terri¬
tories in Africa working in the field of
adult education recently went to Uzbekistan
in the U.S.S.R. to study methods of literacy
teaching used there and the organization
of education for women. Only a few
generations ago women went veiled, were
generally illiterate, and lacked social and
political rights in Uzbekistan.
HOME FOR CHILDREN'S ART: A
permanent exhibition of children's
art the first of its kind in Europe is
being opened in Torun, Poland. It will
include 1,600 paintings illustrating the
theme "My Country" which were entered
for an international children's art contest
organized by the Polish National Com¬
mission for Unesco.

lished by the International Theatre Ins¬
titute with Unesco's assistance, recently

lass, a former slave and an outstanding
leader of the movement for the abolition
of slavery, as a national shrine in Washing¬
ton, D.C has now been given presidential
recognition. President Kennedy has signed
a bill making the Douglass home a part of
the park system in the National Capital of
the United States. An article on Frederick
Douglass and an account of the campaign
to restore and preserve his former home
were published in the February 1962 issue
of The Unesco Courier.
¥T NESCO'S
*J BOARD:

Unesco's newly-reconstitut¬
ed Executive Board which supervises the
execution of the Organization's programme
recently held its first meeting in Paris. Its
members, now increased from 24 to 30,

men elected were Mr. Albert Rakoto-Ratsi-
mamanga of Madagascar, Mr. S. M. Sharif
of Pakistan, Mr. Stefan Wierblowski of
Poland and Dr. Silvio Zavala of Mexico.
RADAR FOR THE BLIND: An ins¬
trument that works by radar and
warns a blind person of obstacles in his
path has been invented in the United
States. Supersonic vibrations reflected by
an object are transmitted as sound signals
through earphones to the user. Engineers
are now working to reduce the size and
weight of the device, so as to make it more
portable.
SCHOOL OF LAW FOR LEOPOLD-
VILLE: A National School of Law and
Administration is being built in Leopoldville
helped by contributions from the United
Nations and the Ford Foundation. Con¬
struction work should be completed by
April, but teaching has already started in
temporary buildings.
These two posters won prizes in
last year's Unesco-sponsored
international poster contest. A
design (top) by Andranik Grigo-
rian, architecture student at the
University of Teheran, portrays
a tree of life against a blue
background with small coloured
plaques representing the brother¬
hood of peoples. The stylized
figures in poster by Warsaw artist
Stanislaw Zagorski illustrate the
phrase, "All human beings are
born free and equal...", taken,
from Article I of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
