Carved in 1953 by a Balinese sculptor, this powerful sandalwood statuette seems
to portray a man lost in deep prayer, or nursing an inner anguish, or covering
his face in shame. Whatever the artist's intention, the pure lines and burning
intensity of this work are quite remarkable. The form and movement bring to
mind the famous miniatures of Japan known as "netsuke" (pronounced "netske").

CHILD-WORKERS
This young garagehand is one of the
40 million children under the age of
fourteen, throughout the world, who
are obliged to go out to work from
a pitifully early age. This staggering
figure is clear evidence that child lab¬
our is by no means a thing of the
past and gives food for thought at
a time when the world is celebrating
the 25th anniversary of the Universal

### EDITORIAL

25th anniversary
of the Universal
Declaration
of Human Rights
On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the adoption,
on December 10, 1948, of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, Unesco is to publish a 100-page booklet by
Pierre Juvigny and Marie-Pierre Herzog entitled Unesco and
Human RightsSuccess, Obstacles, Hope. This study will review
Unesco's action in the field of human rights during the past
quarter of a century and examine new questions raised by the
evolution of the contemporary world which Unesco will have to
face if it is to remain true to its mission "to contribute to peace
and security" and "to further universal respect of justice",
the essence of which is respect for human rights. One section
of this booklet will be devoted to Unesco's efforts to combat
racism and other attacks on human dignity. Another section
will describe Unesco's achievements in areas involving the right
to education, to science, to culture and to information. The
article below is excerpted from the introduction and other
chapters of the forthcoming Unesco study.

UNESCO AND THE STRUGGLE

as defined in the Universal Declaration
of 1948, which inspire the whole of
Unesco's work, and give it its mean¬
ing..." ("In the Minds of Men Unesco
1946-1971"). In order to understand
this fundamental orientation it is
necessary to look back into the past.

the historical sources, one finds that
since 1919, international life and the
way in which international institutions
are envisaged fall into two distinct
periods. The first has been marked
by an effort to institutionalize inter¬
national relations in order to avoid
new conflicts on a scale comparable
to that of the First World War.
This was what the League of
Nations, established in January 1920,
tried to achieve. But the essential
purpose of the League of Nations
was to regulate relationships between
States, with a view, as the French
jurist Georges Scelle put it, to "reduc¬
ing the frequency of wars".
However, the interests of individuals
or groups were not outside the pur¬
view of the Covenant of the League
of Nations; indeed, the League did
make a contribution to the protection
of minorities. The series of treaties
concluded after the First World War
contained recognition of the rights,
including the cultural rights, of ethnic,
religious or linguistic minorities.
In many cases such minorities
found themselves within states whose
frontiers had been redrawn by these
treaties. The League of Nations was
competent to consider petitions from
individuals or from minority groups
that believed their rights were being
infringed.
Furthermore, the Covenant of the
League of Nations, by setting up the
mandate system (conferring power
upon a State to govern other territo¬
ries), imposed certain obligations on
the mandatory powers including some
relating to economic, social and cultu¬
ral rights.
Some degree of international control
was exercised over these States in
the form of questionnaires, reports,
freedom to submit petitions, debates
in the Assembly of the League of
Nations and even the possibility for
a third-party State to bring a manda¬
tory State before the Permanent Court
of International Justice at The Hague.
This legal power held by the
League of Nations, incomplete as it
may have been in the field of human
rights, was by no means insignificant,
for it was also instrumental in promot¬
ing the protection of women and
children, in the fight against slavery
and the traffic in human beings.
Moreover, the International Labour
Organization, set up by the 1919

### 51822: 40 million child-workers in the world today, the scourge of child labour: a blot on the conscience of the developed and developing countries

Incredible as it may seem, there are still over 40 million
children aged under fourteen throughout the world working
in factories, on farms and plantations, in small-scale indus¬
tries, handicraft workshops, hotels, restaurants, shops, as
street traders, etc. This is Just one of the surprising facts
to be found in the special report below based on (1) an
International Labour Office study, "Minimum Age for Admis¬
sion to Employment", published last year, and (2) a Unesco
study "Rights and Responsibilities of Youth".
6
OUNG adults, particularly
those under twenty, make up a con¬
siderable proportion of the labour force
throughout the world. In countries
where industry is expanding rapidly
and there is considerable progress in
education this proportion has shown a
marked and continuing decline.
In the developing countries, the per¬
centage of young people under twenty
in the working population, although
difficult to assess, remains high. The
fundamental causes of this phenome¬
non lie in the economic backwardness
of these countries, closely linked to
the colonial domination experienced by
the majority of them, the persistence
of obsolete social and economic struc
tures, the drastic falling off in school
attendance rates after the age of
eleven and, lastly, the population explo¬
sion which has resulted in an increased
proportion of young people up to
50 per cent and sometimes even more
in the total population.
One of the most important problems
arising from the employment of young
people is child labour work by chil¬
dren under fourteen to fifteen years of
age.
Under the influence of international
standards and minimum-age laws and
the pressure of economic and social
transformations, child labour in the
classic sense of mass exploitation of
children in mines and factories has
become an evil of the past. Yet, while
its nature and dimensions may have
changed, child labour itself remains
widespread and persistent.
Some idea of just how widespread
it is may be gained from the fact that
the number of children aged fourteen
or under working in the world was
thought to number more than 40 mil¬
lion in 1970.
More than 90 per cent of these
children were in the developing regions
of the world. In those regions working
children numbered 41,125,000 (or 5.1
per cent of all the children aged up
to fourteen) in 1960 and 39,975,000 (or
4 per cent) in 1970. In the industrial¬
ized regions, by contrast, the figures
.were 4,085,000 (1.4 per cent), and
3,343,000 (1.1 per cent).
Child labour is a very broad term
and does not have the same character¬
istics everywhere. The formal status
of the working child (that is, whether
he is a full-fledged employed person
as opposed to something like an
informal trainee or an unofficial helper
to an adult worker or an unpaid family
worker or an "adopted child"), the
nature, intensity and regularity of the
work, the hours of work and other

40 MILLION
CHILD-WORKERS
IN THE WORLD
TODAY
The scourge of child labour
- a blot on the conscience
of the developed
and developing countries
conditions of employment and the
effect of work upon schooling, are as
important as numbers in judging the
seriousness of the problem.
Child labour is least apparent in
large-scale, reasonably modern indus¬
try; more so in small, marginal fac¬
tories; very common in small-scale and
cottage industries, handicraft "work¬
shops, industrial home work, small
retail shops, hotels, restaurants, ser¬
vices, street trades and domestic ser¬
vice; and most prevalent by far in
agriculture.
Child labour in factories has not,
of course, altogether disappeared.
Appreciable numbers of children
clearly below the legal minimum age
are still employed in small, marginal
factories that rely on keeping wages
low. Such factories are most numerous
in Asia and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, in Latin America and the Middle
East, but they also exist in parts of
southern Europe and even in depressed
areas of more industrialized regions.
From the examples which recur in all
these regions, they seem to be particu¬
larly concentrated in certain industries:
textiles, clothing manufacture, food
processing and canning.
A striking illustration of the abuses
which occasionally arise in factories of
this kind was provided by a survey
made in one area of Thailand in 1965
covering a limited number of factories
employing ten or more workers.
The factories were engaged in manu¬
facturing or packaging such things as
bottles, cigarettes, textiles, sweets,
biscuits and seafood. Children, espe¬
cially girls, were found to constitute a
large part of the work force. Many of
them between ten and fifteen years
old, and some as young as six, were
working eight to fourteen hours a day,
seven days a week, for derisory wages
in overcrowded, poorly-lit, badly-venti¬
lated and insanitary premises.
Whole family groups were often at
work, with a parent or other older
relative alone receiving payment for
the entire group. In a cigarette factory
children were being hired as "assist¬
ants" by adult workers who gave them
only a fraction of what they had
actually earned, or paid them piece
rates. It was normal for periods of
lay-off to alternate with periods of
heavy overtime (worked at ordinary
rates).
Another survey, made two years
later and limited to textile factories and
workshops in part of the same area,
revealed similar conditions and also
showed that nearly half of the working
children under sixteen years of age
had never been to school.
The work done by children in fac¬
tories is generally relatively light but
they are often given tasks presenting
clear risks to their safety and health.
Numerous instances have been
observed in various countries of the
employment of children in dangerous
occupations, including the manufacture
of fireworks, glass-blowing, carrying
pieces of incandescent glass, the use
of toxic materials in dye houses, work
involving exposure to dust and lint in
textile mills and to extremes of heat
and cold in the manufacture of confec¬
tionery, work in foundries and, in all
sorts of factories, work near furnaces
and unguarded machinery. Even if
such practices are becoming less com¬
mon, they are still very disquieting.
Industrial work other than in fac¬
tories is a common activity among
children throughout Africa, Asia, Latin
America and the Middle East where
many small workshops, cottage indus¬
tries and handicraft undertakings em¬
ploying children are to be found.
Moreover, many children in parts
of both northern and southern Europe
as well as in these regions are known
to perform industrial work at home.
The jobs they perform include weaving,
spinning, sewing, embroidery, metal-
work, leather work, woodwork, making
pottery and carpets, clothing, shoes,
toys, buttons, baskets, fireworks, etc.
To a large extent, of course, these
are family undertakings in which the
children are working and learning a
traditional family trade under their
parents. But this is not the case as
often as it may seem. In one part of
Iran, for example, the labour inspection

CHILD-WORKERS (Continued)
service regards all handicraft work¬
shops as family undertakings and
therefore outside the scope of most
labour legislation even though, in fact,
many of the children working in them
are wage-earners employed by persons
other than their parents.
Child workers in certain countries
are also frequently represented as
apprentices or learners, and many of
them undoubtedly are in a sense, but
the training they get is often minimal,
the work strenuous, the treatment that
of servants and the pay far below
standard. Lighting, ventilation and
sanitary conditions in such workplaces
are generally poor. Safety precautions
are negligible and children can be seen
operating bellows, wielding acetylene
torches, using cutting or piercing tools,
working near furnaces and performing
other hazardous tasks.
Children are often brought to the
workshop by their parents or other
adults sometimes presumed to be their
parents; they work as "helpers" under
the responsibility of those adults and
are paid by them rather than by the
proprietor.
Thus, a recent inquiry in India found
that it was usual for weavers in both
handloom and powerloom establish¬
ments to be assisted by school-age
children, who were not regarded as
employees and whose wages, such as
they were, were paid only by the
weavers themselves. Arrangements,
such as these were found to be com¬
mon in carpet-weaving and brocade
work.
The hand-made carpet industry is a
large-scale and well-known employer
of child labour in other countries as
well, and the employment of children
in it often follows much the same
pattern.
In Iran, for example, carpets are
customarily made by women with the
assistance of girls, often but not
always their own daughters and often
extremely young. In government-
owned workshops, the legal minimum
age of twelve is observed and reason¬
able standards of wages, hours and
physical working conditions are main¬
tained. But the bulk of production
comes from small, private workshops
and especially, home work. Conditions
in such workshops are generally
extremely poor and the employment of
very young girls below the age of
twelve is normal.
Home work is an even greater prob¬
lem in Iran. The work is handed out
to women by middlemen who have
none of the responsibilities of em¬
ployers and is performed at home by
the women with their daughters or girls

The scourge of child labour remains a
world-wide problem today, affecting devel¬
oped and developing countries alike.
Obliged to work for a living in agricul¬
ture, industry, handicraft workshops, etc.,
millions of children are deprived of their
right to education. Above left, shoe-

### 51822: 40 million child-workers in the world today, the scourge of child labour: a blot on the conscience of the developed and developing countries

CHILD-WORKERS (Continued)
Under guise of 'adoption', young girls sold into domestic service
from other families. The girls are often
practically infants and their employ¬
ment and conditions of work are sub¬
ject to no controls. Similar practices
are found in many countries in handi¬
craft work.
Finally, many children are employed
in the building industry throughout
most of Asia, Latin America and the
Middle East, and also, recently, in parts
of southern Europe where large-scale
building has been intense. Older boys
below the legal minimum age seem to
be widely employed on building sites
in these areas as casual, unregistered
labourers to clear debris, carry equip¬
ment and do other odd jobs at low
wages; such jobs often involve serious
risks of accident and injury.
I
10
I N non-industrial employ¬
ment, very many children in all regions
of the world work in small shops, res¬
taurants, hotels, street trades and
various service occupations. In most
cities and towns in Africa, Asia, Latin
America and the Middle East, children
are commonly employed as waiters and
busboys in cafés and restaurants,
maids in hotels, sweepers, shop clerks,
garage assistants, barber-shop assis¬
tants, errand boys, shoe-shine boys,
automobile guards, street vendors and,
of course, beggars.
The street trades, in particular, are
certainly the most visible forms of child
labour and, for obvious reasons,
among the most difficult to control.
The children engaged in them are often
very young, homeless and grossly
exploited by adults.
The street trades are sometimes dis¬
missed as light, harmless occupations
that keep children busy and out of
trouble. In fact they prejudice the
safety, health, moral welfare and social
development of children whose uncon¬
trolled wanderings in the streets for
long hours, until late at night, con¬
stantly expose them not only to bad
weather, dirt, fumes and traffic but also
to the most sordid aspects of city life.
Domestic service is another largely
uncontrolled and widespread occupa¬
tion for children. In countries where
servants are normally found in all
reasonably well-off households, many
of them are bound to be children. This
is very often the case in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and the Middle East.
Recent studies by the International
Labour Organization tend to confirm
that in various countries substantial
numbers of children aged under four
teen are working as domestic servants
(often, it should be said, quite legally,
since the minimum age for domestic
service is sometimes twelve or thirteen
and sometimes no minimum is pre¬
scribed).
In some countries it is common for
very young children mainly girls in
Central America, the Middle East and
some parts of Asia to be brought to
cities from rural areas by their parents,
or purported parents, and virtually sold
into domestic service. The children are
usually unpaid and the practice is often
described, euphemistically, as "adop¬
tion". It is generally rationalized by
the argument that these children enjoy
much better conditions than in their
previous homes. While this may often
be true, there is always a potential
danger of overwork, neglect, mistreat¬
ment and exploitation.
This problem has from time to time
been drawn to public attention in
various countries, but the efforts that
have been made to control it through
laws and regulations, such as the legal
requirement to register domestic ser¬
vants now in force in some parts of
Sri Lanka (Ceylon), have had little
success.
Non-industrial child labour is also
a problem in southern Europe. Chil¬
dren below the legal minimum age are
employed fairly widely in shops, cafés
and restaurants and to a much lesser
extent in markets and street trades.
Employment is often combined with
school attendance, or at least school
enrolment, and provides a supplement
to family income.
In the more developed countries
also this problem sometimes arises,
but again it is of a different nature. In
most such countries children below the
basic minimum age can be legally
employed subject to certain safeguards
(the work must be limited to specified
activities, it must not be carried on
early in the morning or at night or
during school hours, the hours of work
must not exceed a specified maximum,
the children must not be under a speci¬
fied lower age limit, etc.). Failure to
observe these safeguards is probably
the most common problem.
The question has received consider¬
able attention over the past year in the
United Kingdom, where the regulation
of the employment of children aged
between thirteen and fifteen in non-
industrial activities is in large measure
a matter for local bylaws. Children
were reported to have been employed
in prohibited activities, particularly
during weekends and school holidays,
and, more frequently, at prohibited
times (such as delivering newspapers
or milk over one hour before school
started) or for excessively long hours.
Many instances of illegal employ¬
ment came to light only when teachers
inquired into the reasons why some
children had no time to do their home
work or could not stay for after-school
activities or were too tired to concen¬
trate on their school work or fell
asleep in class.
In the developed countries difficul¬
ties of a new and more specialized
kind occasionally appear. For instance,
in the application of safeguards for
child performers, problems have arisen
with television publicity films.
The head of a prominent children's
model agency in the United Kingdom
recently pointed out that children are
sometimes asked for during school
hours and that they can be called to
the studio early in the morning, only
to spend the whole day getting bored
and tired while waiting to be employed.
HE sector in which the bulk
of the children in every region are
employed is, of course, agriculture.
Traditionally, children begin at an early
age to do some work on the land being
cultivated by their parents: this is no
less true of Europe and North America
than of the countries of Asia, Africa
and Latin America. Minor farming jobs,
the care of animals and a certain
amount of field work are performed by
young children almost everywhere.
In the traditional, mainly subsistence
sector of agriculture in the developing
countries, the direct regulation of the
employment of children is generally
not practicable. Until primary educ¬
ation becomes universally available
and until it becomes possible for most
families to dispense with the work of
their children on farms, there is little
chance that child labour by unpaid
family workers will be reduced to any
significant extent.
Employment in commercially oriented
agriculture is a different matter. While
children are far less extensively em¬
ployed in commercial agriculture than
in unpaid family work, they do engage
in it to an appreciable extent in most
developing countries.
On plantations it often takes the form
of work as part of a family group: the
parents do the main field work and the
children either assist them (in plucking
tea leaves, picking coffee beans or
collecting latex) or do secondary jobs

### 51822: 40 million child-workers in the world today, the scourge of child labour: a blot on the conscience of the developed and developing countries

such as weeding, spreading fertilizer
or caring for plants.
This is a fairly common pattern in
some Asian countries, including India
and Pakistan; it is also found, but to
a much lesser extent, in certain African
countries, especially at harvest time.
Most countries have at least some
legislation regulating the minimum age
for employment, but it is usually not
very effective. Even where the legis¬
lation is fairly well enforced, as on the
tea and rubber estates in Sri Lanka
(Ceylon), appreciable numbers of chil¬
dren work unofficially helping their
parents in weeding or other tasks.
The use of piece rates or contracts
specifying quotas tends to encourage
the unofficial employment of children
by parents on plantations. As a rule,
light work by children under certain
conditions is legally permitted, and to
some extent child labour is, in prac¬
tice, limited to such work.
It is by no means uncommon, how¬
ever, for children to do full-scale agri¬
cultural work, including such heavy
jobs as ploughing. In Brazil, the plant¬
ing of cotton, rice and sugar-cane and
the harvesting of coffee and cocoa are
frequently done by both children and
adults.
Child labour in agriculture is by no
means confined to the developing
countries. In southern Europe children
are widely employed as farmhands or
in caring for animals and are usually
paid very low wages sometimes in the
form of food and lodging. Many of
these children have left school at an
early age or attend irregularly.
In northern Europe such employment
is less widespread and more subordi¬
nated to schooling, but it does exist.
There are several countries in which
employment in .agriculture is not sub¬
ject to a minimum age as long as work
is not performed during school hours;
children often start work, either on
their family farms or on other local
farms, early in the morning before
school, put in additional work after
school and work long hours during
vacations.
In the United States interest in the
conditions of migratory labour has
brought to light over the past few years
a considerable amount of disquieting
information on the employment of chil¬
dren in agriculture generally.
Until 1966, the U.S. federal Fair
Labor Standards Act contained no
provisions regulating child labour in
agriculture outside school hours and
even now does so only for hazardous
occupations; moreover, few State laws
contain such provisions. Thus, chil¬
dren of any age can work legally in
agriculture at certain times in most
States. Many children do in fact have
such jobs and a large proportion are
migratory workers. In 1967 about
309,000 children under fourteen years
did some farm work for wages; about
38,000 of them were migratory.
According to several studies carried
out in the U.S.A. in the mid-1960s,
many migratory children worked prac¬
tically full time, but in recent years
there seems to have been an appre¬
ciable decline in the illegal employment
of children in agriculture.
'VER the past 55 years the
International Labour Conference has
adopted ten Conventions dealing with
the minimum age for employment.
The first of these, the Minimum Age
(Industry) Convention fixed this age,
in 1919, at fourteen. It was partially
revised in 1937 when the minimum age
for employment in industry was raised
to fifteen.
Among countries which have raised
the minimum age to sixteen i.e. a
higher level than the standards set in
these two Conventions are Australia,
Bulgaria, the U.S.S.R., the United Sta¬
tes (under federal legislation and under
the legislation of twenty States), and
in principle, Japan and Singapore.
In Europe, the minimum age for
employment in industry is fifteen in
Czechoslovakia, Italy, Netherlands (for
girls), Norway, Sweden and Yugosla¬
via; in Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Hungary, Malta, Netherlands (for boys)
and Romania, it is fourteen. In Hun¬
gary and Romania work during school
attendance hours is forbidden for chil¬
dren who have not completed the com¬
pulsory schooling period.
In the United States the age limit is
fifteen in one State (Texas) and four¬
teen in 28 States and the District of
Columbia.
Jamaica has raised the minimum age
to fifteen. In Barbados, Chile, Colum¬
bia, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, the
age is fourteen.
In Asia and the Pacific a minimum
age of fifteen has been established in
certain States in Australia, in India (for
mining and transport), and New Zea¬
land. In certain other parts of Austra¬
lia, in India (work in factories), Pakis¬
tan (mining and transport), Thailand
and the Republic of Viet-Nam, the age
is fourteen.
In Africa a minimum age of fifteen
has been laid down in Ghana, Mauri¬
tius, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. In
Algeria, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and
Upper Volta, it is fourteen.
In a few countries the minimum age
is still below that established by the
two conventions. In Costa Rica, the
Arab Republic of Egypt, Iran, Pakistan
(work in factories) and Turkey, it is
fixed at twelve years of age.
Another important convention deal¬
ing with the age of admission of
children to agricultural work, was
adopted in 1921.
Under this convention children under
fourteen years of age may only work
in any public or private agricultural
undertaking outside the hours fixed for
school attendance. Such work shall
not be such as to prejudice their atten¬
dance at school.
It is clear that legislation on juvenile
labour in agriculture is less strict and
more limited in scope than that con¬
cerning employment in industry or at
sea. Fewer countries have established
a minimum age in this sector, and the
age is often fixed at fairly low levels.
Furthermore, family undertakings are
often excluded from the relevant provi¬
sions and light work is frequently
authorized.
LS a final comment concerning
children employed in agriculture, it is
worth emphasizing that, contrary to
traditional ideas on the healthful nature
of farm work, modern agriculture expo¬
ses workers to at least as much phy¬
sical risk as most other sectors.
This is not only .a matter of heat,
sun, dust and insects or the strains
caused by stooping and lifting: the
increasing mechanization of agriculture
has made it an especially hazardous
occupation. The dangers created by
the use of power-driven machinery,
such as harvesters, threshers, reapers,
tractors, are obviously all the greater
for children and young persons.
Some countries, like the United Sta¬
tes, have made special efforts both to
prevent the employment of children in
dangerous agricultural work and to
train young persons in handling machi¬
nery safely.
In the United States, agriculture is
classified after mining and construc¬
tion as the third most hazardous occu¬
pation. In the state of New York alone,
official satisfies indicate that during the
period 1949-67, forty-seven children
aged between five and fourteen years 1 1
old died as a result of occupational
accidents: forty-two of these were in
agriculture.

### 51825: Science, society and racism: the unequal development of people of different races is a product of history not of nature

by
Grigory Glezerman
Science
Society
and
The unequal development of people
of different races is a product
of history not of nature
12
lACE and racial oppression
belong to entirely different categories:
the origin of race is in nature; that
of racial oppression is social. Ideo¬
logists of racism tend in one way or
another to deny this distinction and
elevate racial inequality to the rank of
natural law. Anthropology, historical
sciences and sociology refute anti-
scientific notions of this kind.
Natural distinctions among people
do not in themselves give rise to
social distinctions and it is only in
certain social conditions that they may
be connected with social inequality.
Neither colour of skin nor structure
of hair nor any other characteristics
of race can ' possibly account for
unequal levels of social, economic or
cultural development of people be¬
longing to different races. This
inequality is a product of history, not
of nature.
In this connexion it is important
to define correctly the relationship
between biological and social factors.
One cannot deny the influence of bio¬
logical factors on social life. No
doubt, there are biological relations
between human beings united in a
society (like those connected with
the reproduction of mankind, for
example), but it is not these relations
that determine the structure of society
and its forms. Man's relationship
with nature is different from that of an
animal. Man produces the means of
his existence, and this fact alone
makes it inadmissible to extend the
application of laws valid for animal
life to human society.
An outstanding Russian scientist,
GRIGORY GLEZERMAN, Professor at the
Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences, is a leading Soviet philosopher
and sociologist and has several times been
awarded the U.S.S.R. State Prize for his
work in these fields. Professor Glezerman
was a member of the committee of experts
which met at Unesco headquarters in Paris
in 1972 to study problems of racism. The
article published here is based largely on
the paper he presented at this meeting. He
is the author of a number of books including
"Historical Materialism and the Development
of Socialist Society' which has been publish¬
ed in English, French and German editions.
Kliment A. Timiriazev, who was a
follower of Darwin, once aptly ob¬
served: "the doctrine of struggle for
existence stops short at the threshold
of the history of culture. All reason¬
able, cultural activity of man is nothing
but struggle against the struggle for
existence."
Society develops in accordance
with its own social laws and therefore
the influence of biological factors is
always refracted through the prism of
social relations. Moreover, biological
relations themselves change under the
impact of and depending on social
relations.
Anthropologists have convincingly
demonstrated that race distinctions
concern only minor characteristics and
do not allow any sharply marked bor¬
derlines to be drawn between the
different groups of mankind. Some
scientists estimate that only one per
cent of the total number of genes are
responsible for transmitting charac¬
teristics that distinguish one race from
another. And those genes are res¬
ponsible only for such superficial
features as colour of skin and the like.
There was a time when these
features did play a part in man's
adaptation to natural conditions but
never did they determine the course
of history. Moreover, even their rôle
in the process of adaptation to
geographical environment gradually
lost its significance, as man changed
nature by his activity and at the same
time changed his own way of life (in
terms of urbanization, for example).
Furthermore, in the course of
history changing social conditions
have been exerting an ever increasing
influence on the biological aspect of
the development of races. The sizes
of race populations, their migration,
the process of mixing and so on
depend mainly on the conditions of
social life. This manifests itself,
among other things, in the fact that
there are no "pure" races now.
In spite of the obstacles created by
racial segregation in a number of
countries the process of mixing goes
on steadily. A leading Soviet authority
on genetics, Nicolai P. Dubinin, estim¬
ates that "on the whole, one may
assume that now about half of the
world population are the product of
race mixing... The year 1492, when
Colombus discovered America, was
the starting point of the present round
of the ever expanding genetic process
of pooling human heredity within a
single gigantic population."
HIISTORY has shown the fu¬
tility of attempts to regard the destinies
of peoples, their potential abilities and
patterns of behaviours as dependent
on racial peculiarities. First of all, it
should be noted that the main biolo¬
gical features of man which were the
prerequisites for the emergence and
development of his social life the
upright position of the body that freed
his hands in the process of moving
about, thus enabling him to work, the
structure of his skeleton, the develop¬
ment of the brain, etc. are common
to all human races. Therefore they
unite, rather than divide mankind.
The different destinies of peoples
in history are accounted for not by
their biological features but by ma¬
terial conditions of life, by their
historical circumstances. Many scien¬
tists, including the British archaeo¬
logist Gordon Child (in "Progress and
Archaeology") feel that the social
development of peoples is not iden¬
tical with their biological development.
Since man of the present type
appeared it has proceeded without
significant changes having taken place
in the structure of his body, and the
rate of this development is not
determined by biological factors.
The difficulties involved in defining
the notion of race have prompted
some scientists to propose that this
notion should be given up altogether,
and replaced by that of ethnic groups.
The absence of sharp borderlines,
however, does not mean that races

EIKE HABERLAND is a professor of ethnology
and Director of the Frobenius Institute at
the Goethe University of Frankfurt (Fed Rep.
of Germany). The author of a number of
ethnological and anthropological studies on
Africa and Oceania, he has carried out sev¬

### 51827: Leo Frobenius, the man who explored Africa's soul: a great German humanist, free of prejudice, who proved that wherever men live there is civilization

During a lifetime of tireless research, Leo Fro¬
benius (seen, left, at work at a camp-site in the
Sahara) made a series of twelve great ex¬
peditions to Africa (see map below) from which
he brought back an immense wealth of infor¬
mation about the previously unsuspected cultural
treasures and ancient civilizations of the conti¬
nent. He was one of the first to make known
the importance and splendours of the Zimbabwe
civilization in southern Rhodesia. In this region
he discovered a number of magnificent rock
paintings of which this seated dignitary (right)
is one of the most famous examples (see also
next pages and back cover).
& ¡m
really nobody's disciple as far as
science was concerned. He served
his apprenticeship at various museums
and universities although as he
himself put it his real teachers were
the original sources.
His doctoral thesis on the origins
of African culture was rejected by a
German faculty, and he turned his
back on the universities for good.
From then on, he went his own way
It is true that, as an older man, he
received an honorary professorship
from the University of Frankfurt, but
he never held public lectures, although
the number of those who call
themselves his pupils is considerable.
His achievements are all the more
impressive when we consider that he
was not only a scientific genius, but
also a gifted administrator. His entire
life-work, his research institute with
its many collaborators, his numerous
research expeditions, his extensive
scientific archives were supported for
the greater part of his life with money
he raised himself.
A series of twelve great expeditions,
beginning in 1904 and ending in 1935,
shortly before his death, took him to
the Congo and the Kasai, to West
Africa which he covered in two trips
of almost four years' duration, to
Morocco, Algiers, Libya, and into the
deserts and mountains of the central
Sahara, to Egypt, to the Sudan, to the
shores of the Red Sea and to South
Africa. He also took an extended
trip to India. Thus many years of his
life were spent in the bush, in the
savanna and the tropical forest.
Those travels and the numerous
books he wrote about them in a highly
memorable style established his fame.
At that time, Frobenius was quite
properly called the true scientific
discoverer of African culture, for he
never returned from his expeditions
without material of immense value to
science.
H
MS reputation as an active
researcher was equally undisputed
among the general public and among
ethnologists. He was the daring
revolutionary in many fields, attacking
unsolved problems and making entirely
new discoveries.
Consider Zimbabwe (Rhodesia)
whose culture he brilliantly explained
from the traditions of the wise men and
priests still living in 1930. Consider Ife
in Nigeria where his excavations
brought entirely novel aspects of Afri¬
can art to light
Frobenius had a genius for dis¬
covery. From every journey he
brought back things previously un¬
known whether objects or traditions,
myths or historical reports. He
showed quite remarkable intuition in
discovering things which others, who
had been longer in the country than
he had, passed by unnoticed.
In Nigeria, for example, a man from
Ife told him that "in my country
everyone who lived in olden times is
a big stone." What no one had
believed possible was shown to be
true Frobenius went to Ife and there,
despite opposition from the Yorubas
and the British colonial authorities,
excavated marvellous pieces of terra
cotta and bronze heads. In so
doing he not only founded African
archaeology but revolutionized the
picture of African art which had
prevailed in Europe till that time, by
demonstrating what consummate works
Africa was able to produce.
His writings about these journeys
are today counted among the standard
works of African literature. The most
important are: a comprehensive twelve-
volume collection of African myths,
fairy tales and folk tales; his three
volumes "And Africa Spoke" (in which
he laid down the results of his travels

in western and central Sudan); "Dying
Africa" in which he describes the
gradual decline of the high traditional
culture; "Erythrea" describing the
Zimbabwe culture; "Paideuma" in
which he sets down his credo as a
philosopher of culture; and finally his
powerful summary the "History of
African Culture".
Yet Leo Frobenius shares the fate
of many other important men: often
mentioned, seldom quoted, and even
more rarely read. Most of his books
some were published in the first
quarter of this century have not been
re-issued. Few of them have been
translated into English (1).
(1) A selection, in English, of the works of
Frobenius, 'Leo Frobenius 1873-1973, An
Anthology", edited by Eike Haberland and
with a foreword by Leopold Sedar Senghor,
has just been published by Franz Steiner
Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many. Other important works of Frobenius
translated into English include: 'The Child¬
hood of Man', Meridian Books Inc., New
York, 1960; "The Voice of Africa", Benjamin
Blom, New York, 1968.
Few anthropologists during his time,
or indeed before or after him, have
devoted their lives with so much pas¬
sion to uncovering the secrets of inter-
cultural influences and relations. Only
the immediate experience of the living
customs of the African, only close,
even intimate, contact with African
people made it possible for him to
achieve such perfection in his work.
Frobenius was a tireless worker
as is proved not only by his numerous
publications, but also by the treasures

.
PAINSTAKING GENIUS Frobenius recorded every aspect of African cultures with the same
painstaking precision. His personal archives contained some 250,000 notes on African art,
history, traditions and folklore. He made vivid reproductions of African paintings, such as this
splendid rock painting from Rhodesia (left), and meticulous plans and drawings of dwellings, fur¬
niture, carvings and decorative designs such as this embroidery from Nigeria (below).
he left behind in his archives, most of
them in his own hand, comprising
250,000 excerpts, pictures and maps in
which he systematically catalogued all
the most important facts from the
literature of his day on Africa.
Frobenius' lifework was crowned
officially when the city of Frankfurt
took over the sponsorship of the
African Institute which, up to then, he
had supported by his own efforts, and
appointed him a Director of the
Ethnological Museum of the same city.
Frobenius could now work more
freely, and devoted the last years of
his life principally to training his
students to succeed him in his work.
He sent them, under his own super¬
vision, on several great expeditions,
the finest fruits of which were the
copying and recording of the Arabian
and the Sahara rock pictures.
Although constantly attacked by the
Nazis, the Institute which later bore his
name, survived the bad years following
his death at Biganzalo, Italy, on
August 9, 1938, up to 1945. Today it
is continuing his work as a centre of
African research in the Fed. Rep. of
Germany.
The vast collection of the Africa
Archive, in which Frobenius recorded
all aspects of African cultures
with great meticulousness whether it
concerned sample calabashes or the
distribution of certain types of beds or
pile dwellings provided the basis of

recognition of the historical back-

FROBENIUS (Continued)
ground of African cultures and the
notion of culture as an independent
entity.
Frobenius was the first to try to
shed some light on the apparent
darkness of African history and to put
the African cultures drawn up by him
into historical perspective. With the
help of a cartographic method which
he developed himself he attempted in
his immense work, the "Atlas Afri-
canus", to locate the most important
elements of African cultures and thus
to determine their scope and extent.
He identified an old original Negro
peasant culture which he called
"Ethiopian", the cattle breeding
peoples of East Africa and the various
forms of the state systems and
theocratic kingships which play such
a significant part in recent African
history.
On the other hand he strove to see
the- individual cultures he discovered
not simply as a conglomeration of
various elements, but rather as living
organisms whose various forms of
expression were meaningfully related.
The doctrine of the Gestalt of
cultures from which the expression
"culture morphology" derives culmi¬
nates in the philosophical principle of
paideuma which might be best
translated as the "soul" or "spirit"
of a culture which uses man as an
outlet for its expression.
It "takes possession" of man, man
is "possessed" emotionally involved.
As paideuma is a living being, a culture
has its youth, its zenith, its decay and
death. For Frobenius the study of
African history meant the study of
the great African cultures and the
various stages of their development.
'OPIES made by Frobenius
of the great rock pictures were epoch-
making in the development of African
cultural history. The rock pictures
particularly those in the Sahara region
and in southern Africa were barely
known before Frobenius investigated
them. He surveyed them with
scientific accuracy, made copies of
them and added as many more new
discoveries to what was already known.
For this purpose he trained an entire
generation of artists who accompanied
him in his expeditions and after the
middle 1930's went on expeditions of
their own to make a record of the
treasures of south-west European and
African rock paintings and engravings.
In view of the unexpected wealth
and the stylistic range of his
discoveries, Frobenius hoped that
more extensive surveys would bring
to light enough new pictures of
significance to fill an enormous
"picture book" illustrating the history
of pre-literate cultures.
This hope was not fulfilled. Today
some of the dates given to rock
paintings by Frobenius are rejected,
although for lack of archaeological
evidence there has been no success in
dating them correctly.
Be that as it may, Frobenius holds
the honour of having recognized that
many rock pictures belonged to an
earlier epoch of mankind, when the
inhabitants of Europe as well as Africa
were still hunters. They made pictures
of the things that formed the centre
of their lives and thoughts: the
animals they hunted.
Animals were not simply prey and a
source of food. They lived with man
in symbiotic union. They were central
to the culture. Men were to use
Frobenius' expression "possessed",
emotionally involved, with the animals'
existence.
This was expressed in many rock
pictures, which go beyond mere
naturalistic reproduction of animals.
They show beings with human bodies
and animal heads or with masks.
A climax is reached in the picture of
a demonic elephant which, through the
power of its artistic sensitivity, has
lost none of its strong impact for us
today.
HE rock pictures in the
Sahara took on new meaning when
Frobenius compared them with those
of South Africa some of which had
been made in recent times by hunters,
the Bushmen, before their old culture
collapsed and disappeared leaving few
traces. Here again, we find the over¬
powering profusion of animal pictures
of the highest degree of artistic per¬
fection, here again the same demonic
beings.
On many of his trips around Africa
Frobenius collected information on the
remnants of an old hunting culture
which must have formerly covered
the whole of Africa before it was
supplanted by younger and more
vigorous cultures.
Furthermore, Frobenius found won¬
derful rock paintings in the vicinity
of Zimbabwe which really give the
impression of being illustrations of
history. In the centre there is the
constantly recurring figure of the
theocratic king. Particularly expressive
are the pictures depicting his burial in
the centre of a naturalistically depicted
landscape with its characteristic rocks.
Frobenius had a singular affection
for what he called "Ethiopian culture"
(the reference is to Homer's "irre¬
proachable Ethiopia" and has no
connexion with the country of that
name). It is the culture of the true
Negro that left its imprint on the whole
African continent south of the Sahara.
He said of it: "I was often asked
what occupation best expressed the

essence of Africa. In my opinion the
essence of Africa is best reflected in
the peasantry with its indomitable
spirit. It decides the fate of continents.
Don't be deceived by the glamour of
large cities, the power of kings and
nobles, artists and craftsmen which
push the peasantry into the back¬
ground."
Since Frobenius, a great deal has
been written about the African
peasantry, but seldom has it been
described with such warm sympathy.
Frobenius has described the cosmic
dualism which is the great universal
law governing the peasant's existence:
the interaction of the maternal,
receptive, life-giving, nourishing earth
and the paternal heaven procreating,
fertilizing the earth with rain.
He has lauded the peasants' industry
and described how sowing and
harvesting are carried out as a sacred
ritual, a religious ceremony reflecting
a consciousness of the miracle of
Nature, the eternal cycle of life and
death, growth and decay.
No other culture, he maintains, has
the strength and genuine religious
fervour to equal that of African
peasant culture. With great admir¬
ation he describes the clay fortresses
built by the peasants and the patriar¬
chal family and clan within its
protecting walls.
M ROBENIUS, in his impress¬
ive style, liked to speak of the "glory
of the Sudan", when he referred to the
African state with monarch, cities,
highly developed crafts and art. To
him we owe impressive reports of the
high culture which prevailed in the
cities and the courts he himelf visited
both in western and southern Africa.
He also pointed out the numerous
similarities in the structure of these
states, which not only had a common
basic principle namely the divine
ruler as the symbol of the state, the
people and the culture but a great
many other common elements as well,
so that there can be no doubt as to
their historical relationship.
Frobenius not only made a record
of the history, traditions and folk tales
of the Sudanese city culture and
published them in many books. We
also owe to him and his assistants
the rich collection of reproductions of
its architecture and the artistic
creations of its craftsmen (embroidery,
leather-work, metalwork, pottery and
wrought ironwork).
Long before archaeologists proved
that contacts had existed between
Africa and its northern and eastern
neighbours, Frobenius had already
pointed out cultural relationships. For
him African high culture was not an
isolated phenomenon developing inde-
pently of the rest of the world. It had
close and fruitful contact with the old
cultures of the Mediterranean and the
Near East. Africa responded to these
inspirations and created its own
distinctive African high culture.
"It was Leo Frobenius who gave us
back our dignity", declared Leopold
Sédar Senghor, distinguished African
poet and writer, and president of the
Republic of Senegal since 1960.
"To the first pioneers of négritude,
Leo Frobenius was more than a
teacher whose ideas deserved con¬
sideration. He became for them an
effective and driving force in the
discovery, awakening and streng¬
thening of the energies lying dormant
in black men. Frobenius spoke to us
of the one problem which had become
our cause: the nature, the value and
the destiny of African culture."
All the cultures of the earth are now
considered to be of equal value. They
are only different, with differing lines
of thought. Frobenius would say: they
have another paideuma, another
culture soul. But this implies no
value judgment. Frobenius was thus
far ahead of other historians who, in
their works, deal with the so-called
"primitives" only in passing.
Leo Frobenius not only recognized
the historic values of all the cultures
of this earth, he also tried to follow the
actual course of their development,
regardless of the lack of written
sources. It does not matter that today
many of his historical reconstructions
require revision. Every great man is
a child of his times.
We should remember how little
source material he had at his disposal ,
he had collected most of it himself
during his travels. We must also
consider that he had absolutely no
technical aids, such as archaeologists
have today, to help him date his
material.
This fate he shares with many
other great pioneers. Nevertheless,
his insight remains the foundation
for the study of African cultural
history. Only subtle intuition and
tremendous industry the two charac¬
teristics of genius made possible his
vast life work, which we cannot help
but admire.
We see him not only as the founder
of African cultural history, but also as
a great humanist, free of prejudice,
who proved that wherever men live,
there is civilization. We also recognize
in him a bold spirit with the courage to
be independent of current official
policy, at a time when racial madness
had reached its peak, with the courage
to say in public that race had nothing
to do with culture.
What he said prophetically in 1921
has now become a commonplace for
us today, namely "that human culture
must be seen and understood in its
entirety as one organic whole from its
earliest origins". For this he deserves
our gratitude.
Leo Frobenius was quick to realize
how Important the Sahara rock
paintings and carvings were to the
understanding of the history of
ancient Africa. From Morocco to
Libya he discovered and copied
hundreds of these carvings and, in
1925, in collaboration with the
Spanish archaeologist Hugo Ober-
maier, he published his reproductions
in an analytical study entitled
"Hadjra Maktuba" (from Arabic
meaning "written on stone"). The
figures above were found at Taghit QQ
and Mou'l Maktuba, not far from £y
Bechar in the Sahara.

### 51828: Why marriage age, 16, civil majority, 18, voting age, 21?

WHY
9 marriage age 16
civil majority 18
voting age 21
by Titos Patrikios
I N all countries, parents are
under a legal obligation to feed,
support and bring up their children
and also usually to meet the cost of
the children's education.
But the present trend is to extend
parental responsibilities to include
medical care, education beyond the
elementary level (as stipulated by law
in several States of the United States
of America), or even vocational training
(in Romania, the Code of the Family
stipulates that the parents shall bring
up the child and make provision for
health and physical development,
education, schooling and vocational
training).
These facts emerge from a Unesco
inquiry covering 45 countries (1) the
results of which were published re¬
cently in the Unesco booklet "Rights
and Responslbilites of Youth".
The duty of supporting the child
devolves upon the father and mother,
and also upon the grandparents.
There are some countries such as the
United States, Bulgaria and Turkey,
where this obligation exists between
brothers and sisters, while in Japan
the Family Court may, in special
circumstances, impose such duties
upon relatives of the third degree.
In countries such as Pakistan and
Liberia, the obligation devolves upon
the "family" in a broad sense.
As a general rule, these parental
responsibilities, together with the

TITOS PATRIKIOS, of Greece, Is a sociologist
and jurist and former director of a programme
of research in Greece on juvenile delinquency
and on economic and social development.
He has been a Unesco consultant on prob¬
lems of youth and education since 1968 and
from 1972 has been particularly concerned
with the prevention of drug abuse among
young people by educational means. He Is
the author of the Unesco study "Rights and
Responsibilities of Youth' (No. 6 in the series
Educational Studies and Documents, 1972),
prepared with the collaboration of the World
Assembly of Youth and the World Federation
of Democratic Youth. It Is on this study that
the article we publish here is based.
corollary rights of the children, cease
to exist when the young people come
of age. However, such responsi¬
bilities and rights expire in some
countries before the children come of
age and in others after.
In the United States the law of
certain States stipulates that, if a minor
of sixteen starts to work and earns
enough to keep himself, his father is
no longer obliged to support him. In
Australia too, parents are released
from their obligation to provide for
their children when the latter reach
the age of sixteen (Queensland,
Australian Capital Territory).
In Laos, on the other hand, the
parents' obligation lasts until the
children can earn their own living, but
if a child is later without a job and
cannot find one, the parents are again
obliged to provide support.
Discrimination between illegitimate and
legitimate children. In most countries
children born out of wedlock do not
have the same rights as legitimate
children despite the trend in favour
of greater equality between them.
As a rule, it is only when they have
been legitimized that children born out
of wedlock have the same rights and
obligations as the legitimate children
of the marriage. If they have merely
been recognized by the father, they
are entitled to be fed and brought up
at their father's expense, but they
cannot claim the same rights as
legitimate children, particularly in
matters of inheritance.
But in certain cases they may apply
to the putative father for maintenance
and education allowances. In Belgium
illegitimate children can exercise this
right up to the age of eighteen, in
Finland up to seventeen and in Guyana
up to sixteen.
A significant step towards the elim¬
ination of discrimination between
legitimate and illegitimate children was
taken in New Zealand with the Status
of Children Act of 1969, which provides
that "for all the purposes of the law
of New Zealand the relationship
between every person and his father
and mother shall be determined
irrespective of whether the father and
mother are or have been married to
each other."
Diminution of paternal authority. The
social functions performed by the
family, while still very important, are
undergoing radical changes as a result
of the economic, social and cultural
transformation which is taking place
in all parts of the world, especially in
the most highly developed countries.
Paternal authority, which is the basis
of a number of parental rights and
corollary responsibilities of children,
is being undermined, reduced and
weakened. However, the current
change in paternal authority (which
of course varies considerably from
country to country) can be seen in the
new parent-child relationship rather
than in new legislation.
Nevertheless, one finds a growing
number of countries now adopting
legislation recognizing, to some extent,
the weakening of paternal authority.
Responsibilities of society and rights
of children. It is now recognized in
all countries that it is the parents
alone who can ensure children and
adolescents the rights they are entitled
to within the family. This is particu¬
larly true for health matters and
physical and mental training. Although
this responsibility mainly concerns
parents, it is to an increasing extent
being assumed by society as a whole.
In the Declaration of the Rights of
the Child, unanimously adopted on
November 20, 1959 by the General
Assembly of the United Nations,
parents and all citizens, local and
national authorities were called upon
to recognize the rights set forth in
that Declaration and to seek, pro¬
gressively, to make them a reality
through legislative and other measures.
Under the principles set out in this
Declaration, "the child shall enjoy
special protection, and shall be given

AGE LADDER OF RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS
This comparative table, drawn up by the "Unesco Courier", shows the legal minimum age established in
48 countries for marriage, civil majority (generally defined as the age at which parental authority ceases),
criminal responsibility and the right to vote. Where the minimum age for marriage given is lower than the
age of civil majority, this means that parents consent to the marriage is still required. It will be noted that
there is still often a discrepancy between the minimum voting age and the age of criminal responsibility,
that is to say the age at which, in criminal proceedings, young people are considered as adults.

Children, the Declaration adds,
should also enjoy the benefits of
social security, adequate nutrition,
housing, recreation and medical ser¬
vices. Special protection should also
be provided for the child's mother,
"including adequate pre-natal and
post-natal care." The child who is
physically, mentally or socially handi¬
capped should be given the special
treatment, education and care required.
The Declaration proclaims that
children need love and understanding
for the full and harmonious develop¬
ment of their personalities and should,
wherever possible, grow up in the care
of their parents. It also declares that

maintenance of children of large
families is desirable.

twenty-one. This has now been
lowered by law in quite a number of
countries to twenty or even eighteen
years of age. Furthermore, the
inquiry carried out by Unesco has
revealed the interesting fact that the
legislation of all the countries studied
sets even lower minimum ages at which
young people have the right to perform
certain acts independently.
Minimum age for marriage. In nearly
all the countries studied, young people
may marry before attaining the age of
majority generally twenty-one. But
in the Socialist countries the minimum
age for marriage coincides as a rule
with the age of majority, which is fixed
at eighteen. In Chile, too, the two ages
coincide at twenty-one, while in Den¬
mark the minimum age for marriage is
the same as the age of majority
(twenty) but this only applies to boys.
Generally speaking, the minimum age
for marriage is lower for girls than
for boys. In some countries young
people can get married even before
reaching the minimum legal age if
special permission is obtained from
the judicial or administrative auth¬
orities. Such permission, which is
usually granted in grave circumstances,
especially in the event of pregnancy,
can be requested by young people of
either sex (in Denmark, the Nether¬
lands, Czechoslovakia, U.S.A., etc.) or
by girls only (in Romania, Singapore,
Laos, etc.).
The minimum legal age of marriage
for boys and girls in different countries
is given in the table on page 26.
Parent's consent. Young people may
not marry before attaining their
majority without the consent of their
father and mother or of the person
exercising parental authority.
In Belgium young people who have
attained their majority, are required,
up to the age of twenty-five, to consult
their father and mother before getting
married.
In Monaco, young people who have
attained their majority are required,
up to the age of thirty, to produce
evidence of their parent's consent.
These requirements are pure for¬
malities, but it is noteworthy that they
have not yet been abrogated
In Algeria, under Islamic law, women
may not make the decision to marry
of their own accord, even after they
have attained their majority.

### 51828: Why marriage age, 16, civil majority, 18, voting age, 21?

Early in 1973, just before the Irish general elections and at a time when the minimum
voting age in Ireland had just been lowered from 21 to 18, the students of Marion College,
Dublin, held their own mock elections complete with candidates, canvassers, political pam¬
phlets and rallies. Candidates were permitted to visit classes (left) to explain their platforms
and electioneering continued long after school hours (right). Student-officials supervised
polling (below) and candidates were elected under the proportional representation system
in force in Ireland. On one point the vote was unanimous everyone learned a great
deal about elections and throughly enjoyed themselves in the process.
By contrast, in the socialist countries,
where the minimum legal age of
marriage is the same as the age of
majority, the parent's consent is no
longer required.
In the United States, girls in most
States and boys in nine States
may marry without their parent's
consent upon reaching an age usually
eighteen lower than the age of
majority.
Emancipation by marriage. In most
countries where young people may
marry before attaining their majority,
minors achieve legal independence on
marriage. They then cease to be
subject to parental authority and enjoy
certain legal rights (Belgium and Italy)
or even the same as they would obtain
on attaining their majority (Finland,
Costa Rica, Guyana, New Zealand,
Japan, Singapore, Ghana). In the
United States, marriage does not
confer legal independence upon minors
except in four States.
Age of majority. The legal definition
of the age of majority varies little
from one country to another: it is the
age at which parental authority ceases
to be operative, and young people are
recognized as capable of carrying out
all acts of civil life on their own. In
most countries, this age is twenty-one.
As pointed out earlier, young people
in most highly developed countries
have already in many instances broken
away from parental authority practi¬
cally if not legally long before they
come of age.
On the other hand, in certain
countries where old traditions remain
in force, where the patriarchal family
pattern dominates and the father's
authority is still very strong, young
people often find that in practice their
legal incapacity extends well beyond
the age at which they attain their
majority in law.
Analysis of the legislation of the
countries studied, shows, however,
that although the age of majority is
still twenty-one in most of these
countries, there is an increasingly
pronounced trend towards a lowering
of this age. In a large number of
countries, and particularly in the
Socialist countries, it is already
eighteen, while in others, such as the
Scandinavian countries, it is twenty
(see table page 26).
We have a typical example of the
trend towards a lower age of majority
and the curtailment of parental auth¬
ority, which is evident in the de¬
veloping countries, in the reply to the
Unesco questionnaire supplied by the
Ministry of Education of Sierra Leone
(March 4, 1970):
"Up to about 20 years ago, young
people had very little say in the choice
of education, profession and disposal
of their leisure. The dictates of their
parents were regarded as final. Any
objection to these was regarded by
society as deviating from the norm.
The age of maturity then was much
higher than today (say between 25 and
30 years).
"But with the infiltration of western
custom and the increase and availab¬
ility of visual aids in the form of
cinemas, books, etc., young people
became mature much earlier and
assumed responsibility for their way
of living, around the age of 21. This
too, had taken a different trend in
society which had accepted this
change. Parents are aware of it and
this is gradually being reflected in
the relationship with young people."
Right to vote. In most of the
countries studied in the Unesco survey

### 51828: Why marriage age, 16, civil majority, 18, voting age, 21?

WHY ? (Continued)
The three-pronged advance
towards an extension of the rights of youth
the age of political majority is still
twenty-one (Belgium, Italy, Malta,
Monaco, Turkey, Colombia, Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago, India, the Ivory
Coast, Mauritius, Liberia, Nigeria and
Sierra Leone, etc.). It is higher in
Italy for Senate elections, for which
the right to vote is not granted until
twenty-five. On the other hand, in
Belgium, the right to vote in local
elections is granted at eighteen.
In view of the earlier maturity
of young people today and their
increasing involvement in all fields of
social activity, this age limit seems
rather high and is one of the obstacles
to active participation by young people
in political, or at least parliamentary
affairs, and to their standing for
parliament. It is highly significant that
the age at which young persons are
considered responsible for their
criminal acts, liable for military ser¬
vice, or old enough to start work is
usually lower than the legal voting age.
The lowering, of the age of political
majority to eighteen is in fact a
common objective of many youth
movements and youth organizations
which have been campaigning in this
direction in several parts of the world
for some time.
Legislative reforms recently intro¬
duced to this effect in several
countries have gone some way towards
meeting these demands. Thus, the
voting age was lowered to twenty in
Norway in 1967, New Zealand in 1969,
and in Denmark in 1971; to nineteen
in Sweden in 1969; and to eighteen
in the United States in 1971. The right
to vote at eighteen has been
recognized in an amendment to the
United States Constitution which
applies to all elections, federal, state
or local. The age of political majority
in the United Kingdom has been
dropped to eighteen since 1970.
It is worth noting that surveys
conducted in certain countries of
western Europe, such as Belgium and
Norway, which are included in the
present study, indicate that in the
eighteen-to-twenty age group those
expressing themselves in favour of
lowering the age of political majority
to eighteen are still in the minority.
Some political youth organizations
would seem not to attach importance
to lowering this age limit, since they
look on it as little more than a formal
gesture which would not, in the
absence of other measures, enable
young people to play a larger or more
effective part in political life.
In the Socialist countries, the age
of political majority has in recent years
been lowered to eighteen.
Criminal law. In most countries
youngsters who break the law are
tried by special juvenile courts or, as
in the case of the Scandinavian
countries and Romania, by other
bodies which are even less formal and
in which there is a greater degree of
public participation.
Juvenile courts and other competent
bodies follow a procedure that is
relatively free of judicial formalities
and as a general rule they apply
protective, preventive and re-edu¬
cational measures, according to the

IN MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES
EDUCATION STILL NOT COMPULSORY
In 42 countries and territories (1), most of them in Africa. Asia
and Oceania, education is not yet compulsory in law. Almost
all of them are developing countries without the resources to
provide schooling for all their school-age children. In many
other countries too, where education is legally compulsory,
lack of money and a sufficient number of teachers means that
the law is far from being fully applied. It is in these countries
that the minimum school-leaving age is the lowest. In the
developed countries, however, the general trend is towards
an extension of the period of compulsory education.
(1) According to information supplied by the various countries for the compila¬
tion of the 1972 Unesco Statistical Yearbook, these countries are: The Afars and
Issas (French territory of), Bangladesh, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei, Burma, Burundi,
Cameroon. Dahomey, Ethiopia, Gambia, Hong Kong. Indonesia. Ivory Coast.
Kenya. Lebanon. Lesotho. Malawi, Malaysia (West), Maldive Islands, Mauritius.

age of the minor, his or her character
and the seriousness of the offence
committed.
Above a certain age, prison sen¬
tences, usually light ones, or other
forms of restriction of liberty can be
imposed on minors who have com¬
mitted serious offences. This age, the
severity of the sentences permitted
and the re-educational measures
applied vary from country to country.
In most countries, minors below the
age of eighteen are not liable to capital
punishment. In Japan this age limit
is twenty, in Nigeria it is seventeen
and in Singapore sixteen.
In most countries the special treat¬
ment reserved for young offenders
continues up to the age of eighteen.
From this age onwards the young are
considered, from the penal point of
view, as adults and are subject to
normal jurisdiction, receiving the same
treatment as adults.
A comparison of these age limits
with those given in the table on
page 26 brings out clearly that in many
countries a gap still exists between
the age at which civil and political
rights are acquired (21) and the age
at which young people are considered
to be adults for the purposes of
criminal law (18) and are therefore
subject to the same penalties as adults.
Conclusion. The Unesco study dem¬
onstrates clearly that there is an
increasingly strong movement in the
world today towards the recognition,
extension and consolidation of the
rights of the young.
Within this general movement, there
are, roughly, speaking, three trends.
The first trend shows changes in two
directions: on the one hand a lowering
of the age at which young people are
considered adult in respect of civil
responsibility, and on the other hand
a raising of the age limit up to which
young people continue to benefit from
certain rights and protective measures.
The most typical example of the first
case is the lowering of the age of
majority and of the right to vote which
some countries admittedly only a few
so far have Introduced.
As to the second case, we may
point to the raising of the age levels
up to which young people receive
special social benefits or are granted
special treatment in penal matters, the
longer duration of studies and the
granting of material aid up to an
increasingly high age level, the raising
of the minimum age of employment,
and of the age limits up to which
young workers enjoy special protec¬
tion in regard to working conditions.
The second trend is the trend
towards recognition of certain rights

MILITARY
AND
CONSCIENTIOUS
OBJECTION
Military service is generally considered by the
State as an honourable duty required of all
citizens. Some countries in which military
service is compulsory recognize conscientious
objection, but this is true of very few of the
45 countries (see note page 24) studied in the
Unesco inquiry on the "Rights and Responsi¬
bilities of Youth". In Denmark, Finland, Norway
and Sweden, young men opposed to the principle
of military service on serious moral or philo¬
sophical grounds may, subject to various condi¬
tions, do some form of civilian service instead.
In the United States, conscientious objection is
recognized solely on grounds of religious belief.
Conscientious objectors are assigned to civilian
work or enrolled in non-combatant branches
of the armed forces. In Australia and New
Zealand, conscientious objectors may be exemp¬
ted from military service or assigned to non-
combatant duties. In other countries, such as
Belgium, France and Italy, young people who
have not claimed the status of conscientious
objector may be allowed to do civilian service
on technical co-operation projects in developing
countries. Right, a young Swede reads "A
manual for those opposed to military service".
which affect young people in parti¬
cular, without being directly dependent
on age.
Examples include the measures
adopted in some countries for the
democratization of higher education,
attempts, still limited, to obtain par¬
ticipation by pupils and students in
the running of educational establish¬
ments; recognition, in some cases, of
time spent by young workers in
vocational training as normal working
time; and the recognition in a few
countries of the right of conscientious
objection.
The third trend is the considerable
effort being made by all countries to
set up, strengthen or reform the many
institutions and services which are
helping to enforce the rights of the
young as laid down in existing legis¬
lation.
This movement is not, of course,
uniform in all countries and throughout
the world, but if we study the results
produced so far by this movement, we
have to recognize that most of what
are called "the rights of youth" consist
in most cases of measures of pro¬
tection, welfare and training which, in
aim to integratethe final analysis,
youth into society.
Seen in this light, the responsi¬
bilities of young people, instead of
meaning an opportunity for the young
to take the initiative in actions which
concern them directly and which
ultimately concern society as a whole,
seem more like obligations imposed
on them by adult society, more like
an obligation to receive education
devised essentially by adults or not
to receive it at all if they belong to
under-privileged groups; the obli¬
gation to go to work, often at a very
early age (see article page 6) and
under harsh conditions or, conversely,
to be the first to be fired; the obli¬
gation, finally, to respect a world
order established independently of
them and from which they feel
themselves increasingly alienated.
Without seeking to minimize the
considerable progress accomplished
in many countries in promoting the
rights of young people, it nevertheless
cannot be denied that this progress
has not resulted in any world-wide
change in the social and legal status
of youth.
The many attempts made to improve
youth participation in schools and
other institutions raised great hopes.
But we must recognize that to the
extent that participation remains lim¬
ited and fails to give youth the
possibility of taking part in fundamental
decisions, or is incomplete, in that it
does not allow young people to
develop their activities in all social
fields, it is increasingly rejected by
youth in many countries.
The need to promote the rights and
responsibilities of young people is now
generally recognized and the efforts
made in this direction are producing
more and more positive results, but
young people are still unable to assert
their rights in an independent and
comprehensive manner, or to assume
real responsibility.
It is clear today that a real possi¬
bility of achieving this transformation
in the status of youth does exist; and
it is towards this goal that efforts are
being made by the most progressive
elements among youth and by those
adults who have realized that this
transformation will have an emanci¬
pating effect on the whole of society.

do not really exist. As for ethnic
groups (tribes, peoples, nations), it
should be pointed out that by their
nature they differ from races above
all in that they are historically evolving
forms of the human community.
Mankind as we know it today con¬
sists of some 2,000 different nations,
peoples and tribes a reflection of the
different development stages of the
different parts of mankind, some of
which stayed longer at the stage of
comparatively small tribes while others
advanced further and formed the big
nations of today.
The way nations were formed in¬
volved the unification of different lands
inhabited by kindred tribes and peoples
and the formation of a common na¬
tional territory. It Involved the emer¬
gence of an economic community
founded, above all, on the formation
of a single national market, the emer¬
gence of a national language and
some common features of mental
make-up expressed in specific forms
of culture and so on.
All these ingredients of a nation
evolved historically, though not quite
simultaneously. They were first fused
into a single alloy in a definite epoch
of history, that of the decay of feu¬
dalism and the emergence of capi¬
talism. Thus, both historically and
from the point of view of their social
content, the development of tribes,
peoples and nations is a process
entirely different from that of the
formation of races.
'OME scientists consider
culture to be the basic attribute of race.
This is based on the notion that
evolution, continuity and stability of a
culture are rooted in the genetic
heredity of a race. Notions of this
kind, however, are entirely fallacious.
True, the inheriting of a culture, the
preservation of its specific charaeter,
of cultural traditions, are of great
importance for the development of
peoples, for awakening their sense of
dignity. But the mechanism of conti¬
nuity in history is quite different from
that of genetic heredity.
In the organic world the accumulation
and transmission of information from
one generation to another take place
mainly through the mechanism of
heredity, which underlies the innate
instincts, and, among higher animals,
also by transmitting the acquired
habits from parents to their offspring.
In social life, a fact of tremendous
importance is that each generation
inherits the means of production
created by the previous generations.
This also applies to social experience
which is embodied in language,
thought, culture and tradition.
Whereas biological transmission of
characteristics is confined to the stock
of information accumulated in the
genetic code, the inheriting of social
experience has no limits. Culture,
understood in its most general sense,
is an embodiment of this experience,
the totality of material and spiritual
values created in the course of human
history.
Since culture and the way it is
inherited are not connected with the
mechanism of genetic heredity, it is
evident that neither have they any
organic connexion with race, specific
features of the latter being transmitted
in a genetic way. Culture, with its
uniqueness, is not connected with race,
but with ethnic communities of
different kinds: tribes, peoples, nations.
Races, however they may be defined
(Mongoloid, Negroid, or Caucasoid,
etc.) have no common culture shared
by all the peoples that may be classi¬
fied as belonging to the same race.
Negroes in the United States, for
instance, have a certain stock of
cultural traditions and particular fea¬
tures inherited from African Negroes,
but their culture is to a much greater
extent connected with the conditions
of their present life.
Peoples of Europe that may be
referred to as belonging to the
Caucasoid race possess different
national cultures. The community of
cultures that exists among West
European peoples stems from its
social content, not from a racial
community of white peoples.
Cultural development is sometimes
associated with psychological qualities
of one kind or another, with intelli¬
gence, for example, which, in the
opinion of ideologists of racism, is
dependent on race. Some writers on
this subject, while formally acknow¬
ledging equality among races, attempt
to connect certain features of national
psychology, or even psycho-patho¬
logical complexes, with race. As a
result, whether intentionally or not,
they attribute mental inferiority to
certain peoples, thus subscribing in
fact to racist conclusions.
Repeated attempts to establish links
between race and intelligence exper¬
imentally by means of tests have failed
to provide convincing evidence of
connexions between the two.
The method of testing has itself
proved to be open to doubt. It is
impossible to evaluate test scores
without taking account of factors which
do not depend on race, such as the
social environment of those tested,
their income, educational level and
experience, degree of proficiency in
the language of the test papers,
cultural traditions and customs and
so on.
Comparison of scores made by
people who are in more or less similar
social conditions refutes the myth of
innate superiority or inferiority of one
race or another, as Otto Klineberg,
a leading world authority on race
relations, pointed out in "Race and
I.Q." (Unesco Courier, November 1971).
However, the decisive refutation of
racism is to be found not in psycho¬
logical tests but in the historical
experience of peoples that have rid
themselves of racial or national
oppression. Accelerated development
by these peoples, their ability to
overtake, in their cultural development,
more advanced peoples, the rapid
growth of educational standards and
of the number of specialists, all
provide a convincing rebuttal of the
reactionary conjectures of racists.
II N the struggle for liberation
the oppressed races and nations of
the Third World defend their rights
and dignity. Their national awakening
not infrequently manifests itself in
ideas of nationalism which are put
forward in opposition to the nationalism
of the dominant races or nations.
Nationalism of this kind is of some
significance for progressive develop¬
ment. It contributes to the unification
of the various democratic forces which
are able to wage the struggle for
national liberation.
Among the fighters against racial
and national oppression there are
those who put forward racism of the
oppressed as a counterbalance to the
racism of the oppressors. But the
outstanding Negro leader, Martin
Luther King, stressed that the way to
equality is not through separatism but
through integration which would
exclude judging the merits of people
by the colour of their skin.
A radical solution for racial and
national problems can be achieved not
by opposing peoples one against
another or dividing them, but by
uniting their progressive forces. This
view is shared by Shery Taki, a
delegate from Tanzania to an inter¬
national scientific conference on
racism, held in Moscow in December
1971, who rejected the idea that
"white" supremacy must be opposed
by "black" supremacy.
Comparing the status of the black
population in Cuba where it is a
minority with its status in Haiti where
it is the majority, he emphasized that
it was a mistake for coloured people
to aim at creating states with exclus¬
ively coloured governments, unless
social conditions are taken into
account in setting this aim.
"No doubt", he said, "we see the
tremendous difference between the
violence of the oppressors and the
violence of those who defend them¬
selves. The problem, however, cannot
be solved in this way. A search for
a solution to the race problem that fails
to take account of social conditions
is a road without end..."

HUMAN RIGHTS
AND THE
POSTAGE STAMP
On these two pages we present a selection of the
many postage stamps on human rights themes issued
over the years in all parts of the world.
"A little bit of paper... covered at the back with
a glutinous wash which might, by applying a little
moisture, attach to the back of the letter" was
how English civil servant Rowland Hill described
his scheme for a form of postage prepayment
which was to lead to the issue on May 1,
1840, of the world's first adhesive postage stamp,
the famous "penny black".
Since then the right to issue these "little bits
of paper" has been considered one of the symbols
of sovereignty and has remained a jealously guard¬
ed prerogative of government.
So it was a historic occasion when, on October
24, 1951, the United Nations Postal Administration
(U.N.P.A.), established with the approval of the
Universal Postal Union, became the first non-
national body officially authorized to issue its own
postage stamps.
These stamps, whose face value was expressed
in U.S. dollars, were placed on sale at the United
Nations Post Office at U.N. headquarters in New
York. On October 4, 1969, a second United Na¬
tions Post Office came into operation at the Palais
des Nations in Geneva at which United Nations
stamps in Swiss denominations were put on sale.
Despite the fact that since the creation of the
U.N. P.A. 103 million covers have been franked
with United Nations stamps, it is no part of the
U.N.P.A.'s purpose to set up as a rival to existing
national postal authorities. Its aim is to make the
ideals and activities of the United Nations and its
Agencies more widely known throughout the world.
For this the carefully selected designs that figure
on U.N. stamps are a perfect vehicle, using as
they do an easily understood international symbol¬
ism that transcends language barriers.
Among the many themes that have been illus¬
trated on United Nations stamps are: Human
Rights, the Fight against Racial Discrimination,
the World Refugee problem and, to mark the 25th
anniversary of the United Nations, Peace, Progress
and Justice.
Unesco, which was itself the subject of a 1955
U.N. stamp issue, does not issue its own stamps.
However, it runs a philatelic service which sells
U.N. stamps and encourages its Member States
to issue their own stamps to illustrate human

UNESCO AND THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
(Continued from page 4)
the League of Nations, not only played
a major rôle in laying down and pro¬
tecting workers' rights, but also pio¬
neered a number of new and dynamic
legal and political concepts in the
field of social rights.
The same period saw the estab¬
lishment of the International Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation. But as
Gian Franco Pompei, former chairman
of the Unesco Executive Board, writes
in "In the Minds of Men", although
the Institute "is sometimes thought of
as the embryo of Unesco, (it) was
very different from Unesco in Its non-
govermental structure and its aims."
Thus, between 1919 and 1939,
human rights made their first tenta¬
tive appearance on the international
scene in a manner which was prag¬
matic, fragmentary, unco-ordinated and
fortuituous... one might almost say by
stealth; however, as this sort of
tachiste picture of human rights took
shape, the background remained domi¬
nated by the cold marble figures of
sovereign States.
icase ¡n point an isolated
incident but highly revealing ocurred
in Geneva "when a German citizen of
Upper Silesia complained to the Coun¬
cil of the League of Nations concern¬
ing the violation by Hitler's régime
of the German-Polish Treaty, signed
in 1922 under the auspices of the
League of Nations, guaranteeing the
rights of minorities within those
territories.
"Discussion in the Assembly, ini¬
tially restricted to the matter of 'mino¬
rities', was extended to a wider field
of reference, that of human rights not
expressly covered by the Covenant
of the League of Nations.
"The delegates of Member States,
who were determined to fulfil their
social and humanitarian obligations
but, at the same time, were anxious
to avoid a break with Hitler's Germany,
which had remained a member of the
League of Nations, adopted a draft
resolution, couched in very moderate
terms, which merely invited the gov¬
ernments concerned, to respect human
rights even if they were not mention¬
ed in a treaty.
"But this was to no avail. Goebbels
adamantly insisted that: 'Every man
is master in his own house. The
sovereignty of the Reich precludes
any form of interference in its internal
affairs. The way in which it treats
its citizens is its own concern.'
"A few days after this vote, on
October 21, 1933, Germany announc¬
ed its withdrawal from the Conference
for Reduction and Limitation of Arma¬
ments and from the League. Thus, the
break occurred principally over the
problem of human rights.
"In the ensuing tragedy, one of
the crucial points at issue was whether
human beings, who in the eyes of
international law, might as individuals
be considered the injured or the guilty
party, should not be recognized as
persons in international law subject
to the obligations that this status
implies while, at the same time, having
a legal right to the protection and the
guarantees afforded by the law of
nations. " (René Cassin, "La Décla¬
ration Universelle et la Mise en
des Droits de l'Homme", in Académie
Internationale de La Haye, Recueil des
Cours, 1951).
At the height of the Second World
War and at a time when men and
women in the countries of the free
world were engaged in a heroic
struggle against totalitarianism, certain
pioneering minds conceived the idea
of a world which would not be govern¬
ed exclusively by sovereign States
for the sole purpose of furthering
their own material interests.
As early as 1941, a speech by
Franklin D. Roosevelt had given pro¬
minence to the equality of economic,
social and cultural rights on the one
hand, and of civil and political liberties
on the other, by giving the same
emphasis to freedom from "fear and
want" as to traditional fundamental
freedoms, such as freedom of speech
and expression and freedom of wor¬
ship.
Similarly, the Declaration of the
26 United Nations of January 1, 1942
was a big stride forward in the inter¬
nationalization of human rights: not
only did these nations proclaim the
necessity of protecting and respecting
human rights within "their own terri¬
tory" but also in the territory "of
other countries". This was an implicit
affirmation of a real measure of inter¬
national supervision in the field of
human rights.
The march of history continued:
in November 1942, in a London batter¬
ed by air raids, the President of the
Board of Education of England and
Wales, Richard A. Butler, invited his
colleagues from the allied govern¬
ments in exile to lay the foundations
of an international organization for
education.
In April 1944, the Conference of
Allied Ministers of Education, at which
the United States was represented by
Senator James W. Fulbright, drafted a
project for such an organization. On
June 28, 1945, the Charter of the
United Nations was adopted and the
United Nations came into existence.
On November 20, 1946, the first
session of Unesco opened with a
membership of 34 States which adopt¬
ed a budget of $6,950,000.
The Charter of the United Nations
had brought about a veritable political
and juridical revolution: it gave as
much weight to respect for human
rights and to international co-operation
in the economic, social, intellectual
and humanitarian fields as to the main¬
tenance of peace and security or,
rather, it regarded these two aspects
as inseparable. (Until then only the
preamble to the statutes of the
International Labour Organization had
adopted a similar position, as early as
1919, concerning working conditions.)
The Constitution of Unesco, which
shared the same general aims, was
clearly explicit in linking the consoli¬
dation of peace and the efforts made
by individual States in areas which
had never previously been considered
indispensable to the achievement of
such a goal: "a peace based exclusi¬
vely on the political and economic
arrangements of governments would
not be a peace which could secure
the unanimous, lasting and sincere
support of the peoples of the world;
... peace must therefore be founded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind."
To this end, in the words of the
Constitution, "full and equal oppor¬
tunities for education for all, ... the
unrestricted pursuit of objective truth,
and... the free exchange of ideas and
knowledge" as well as the fight
against prejudice, particularly racial
prejudice, became "weapons" which
were to prevent the recurrence of
war, and also indispensable means
towards the establishment of a true
international community.
ARALLEL with the creation
of Unesco, and as part of the same
general inspiration, other U.N. Speciali¬
zed Agencies appeared, such as the
World Health Organization and the
Food and Agriculture Organization,
while the Economic and Social Council,
established by the Charter of the
United Nations, was to co-ordinate
and to promote the execution of this
great enterprise.
As this undertaking rested largely
on the hopes which had been pinned
on the development of human rights
through international co-operation, it
is understandable in retrospect, that
the same impetus that had brought
the United Nations together, and that OC
had strongly influenced the distribution ÜÜ
of tasks within the newly created
system, should have resulted in a U.N.

decision to proceed without delay to
a Declaration of Human Rights.
It was fully appreciated that the
¡deals professed In the various pream¬
bles were In need of clearer formu¬
lation in order to ensure that they
had the greatest possible intellectual
impact and practical effect.
On December 10, 1948 the General
Assembly of the United Nations pro¬
claimed the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
It Is true that the Declaration was
not binding and that, in the main, it
is not recognized by national legal
systems as having the same standing
as national law. It is also true that
the work of the United Nations and
of the Specialized Agencies may be
considered, to a large extent, as a
gradual process designed to enlist
the co-operation of States themselves
in transcending their inherent limita¬
tions and circumventing the legal and
political obstacle created by the prin¬
ciple of non-interference in internal
affairs.
In any event, the Declaration had
a considerable impact on governments
and on public opinion and has never
ceased to be a source of support and
guidance for all mankind, voicing its
hopes and aspirations.

HAT is Unesco's rôle as
regards Articles 26 (The Right to Edu¬
cation), 27 (The Right to participate in
Cultural Life) and 19 (The Right to
Freedom of Opinion and Expression)
of the Universal Declaration, which
concern Unesco directly, as well as
Articles 1, 2 and 7 which emphatically
proclaim the equality of all men
"without distinction of any kind, such
as race, colour, sex, language, religion,
political... opinion" and also the over¬
riding principle of non-discrimination?
A brief account of this rôle is given
below, and a more detailed account
appears in the book, "In the Minds
of Men", published by Unesco on the
occasion of its twenty-fifth anniver¬
sary (1). The reader who examines
the texts of this book and thinks
about the activities described in them
in relation to the principles set out
in Unesco's Constitution and in the
Universal Declaration, will be astound¬
ed by the magnitude of the fields
covered in which Unesco has endeav¬
oured to be true to its ideal.
The right to education, for instance,
involves many different things: non¬
discrimination, respect for the rights
of minorities, equality of opportunity,
special assistance for the least favour¬
ed members of the community, adult
education, life-long education, and the
essential quality of education capable,

rities.
by its aims, methods and content, of
ensuring the development of the indi¬
vidual within his own group, his
country and the world community.
But it also involves education for
Palestine refugees, educational assis¬
tance to African refugees, the struggle
for what are regarded as merely
"normal" rights such as the right to
attend school, in situations of crisis,
political upheaval and extreme poverty,
situations which Unesco has a duty to
face. The reader will also note that
as soon as a decisive move is made
in a new direction it is necessary to
go further, and at a faster pace.
Thus, the first two Unesco decla¬
rations on the racial question, publish¬
ed in 1950 and 1951, which marked a
significant advance by emphasizing
that the biological differentiation of
races was without foundation, had to
be supplemented by further statements
in 1964 and 1967 because biological
considerations were no longer ade¬
quate and because racial conflicts
were coming to be recognized as the
result of a combination of complex
social and economic factors.
Work is now in progress on a new
draft declaration on race which is due
to be submitted to Unesco's General
Conference in 1974 in order to extend
still further the detailed analysis of one
of the most formidable scourges of
the modern world.
There are many other fascinating
developments, along similar lines,
which could be described. When an
activity is well launched it contains
the seeds of its own development.
This has been the case with the Uni¬
versal Copyright Convention, revised
in 1971 to broaden its field of appli¬
cation for the benefit of developing
countries, and also with the pro¬
tection of man's cultural heritage,
including the magnificent achieve¬
ments of the campaigns to save the
monuments of Nubia and Venice, a
programme which now extends not
only to monuments but also to sites,
historic city areas and landscapes.
It may be asked whether such wide-
ranging activities are justified. Would
it not have been preferable to concen¬
trate the slender financial resources
available on one or two objectives?
The very absurdity of the question
affords sufficient reply.
How can one opt for culture in
isolation from education, or for commu¬
nication in isolation from science?
What significance would all these
undertakings have were it not for the
struggle against racism? How can one
conceive of the development of all
these rights if one does not see them
as a coherent whole, civil and political
rights on the one hand, social and
economic rights on the other? Lastly,
how can one isolate the sum total
of rights, and the duties which they
imply, from their context the building
of peace?
But if one adopts this point of view
which necessarily involves a moral
commitment in relation not only to the
past and the present but also to the
future, one becomes aware of fresh
difficulties ¡n the way of the interna¬
tionalization of human rights.
Such difficulties are numerous and
complex: the confused aspirations and
needs of all kinds that are to be found
in every human being; the clash
between individual liberties and the
requirements of States; the gap in
pace and level of development bet¬
ween industrialized and developing
countries; the conflict between cultu¬
res, systems of values, and modes of
life brought about by upheavals due
to movements of economy and of
trade, by the increased flow of commu¬
nications and by the faster pace of
scientific discoveries and technolo¬
gical development; and lastly the
difficulties experienced in placing Inter¬
national life on a firm and harmonious
footing owing to our universal igno¬
rance, in our rapidly changing world,
of what should be the nature of the
man of the future.
ERHAPS, it may be said,
the task is impossible and we should
settle for piecemeal, bilateral, regional
or even world-wide agreements based
on a pragmatic approach with the limit¬
ed aim of settling problems on a day-
to-day basis.
This is not the view which we take
at Unesco: for us, the Universal is
a reality and a declaration of rights
which is described as "Universal" is a
necessity close to the hearts of all
men. One has only to re-read the
selection of texts prepared under the
direction of Jeanne Hersch for the
20th anniversary of the Declaration
("The Birthright of Man", see page 39).
It will be seen to what extent these
rights, which may seem to us, in
moments of discouragement, abstract
or Utopian, are the deliberate express¬
ion of aspirations which in different
cultures, civilizations, religions and
creeds have survived the vicissitudes
of history, giving a specific form to
those realities we call respect for the
individual, freedoms, national identity
and independence, brotherhood.
Unesco is shortly to publish a
booklet entitled "Unesco and Human
Rights Success, Obstacles, Hope".
Let us hope that it will give to those
who fight for human rights a clear
view of the difficulties which stand
in the way of progress, and that it
will reveal the tremendous forces
engaged in this combat through the
insight it affords into the rôle that can
be played in this respect by a United
Nations agency with weighty respon¬
sibilities in this field.

New Unesco
human rights unit
A special unit to co-ordinate Unesco's
work for human rights and the promotion
of peace has been set up at Unesco
headquarters in Paris. Its programme
includes participation in the Decade for
Action to Combat Racism, a proposed
international declaration on race, a peace
forum, and studies on violence, the
resolution of conflicts and the world role
of international organizations. It will be
associated with such activities as the
struggle against discrimination in education,
education for international co-operation and
peace, human aspects of scientific progress,
access to cultural life, codes of conduct
for the mass media, etc.
Borobodur rescue bid
With the inauguration of preliminary
works on the site by President Suharto,
of Indonesia, on August 10, Unesco's
campaign to save the ancient Buddhist
sanctuary of Borobodur took an important
step forward. Meeting in Paris a few days
earlier, Unesco's Executive Committee for
Borobodur noted that contributions totalling
two million dollars towards restoration costs
had already been pledged and urged an
intensification of fund-raising efforts.
Unesco inquiry
on women's opportunities
Unesco is carrying out an on-the-spot
inquiry into the educational facilities and
jobs open to women in five countries
(Argentina, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Sierra
Leone and Sri Lanka) to find out what
barriers to the advancement of women
actually exist. Reports are being compiled
on occupations in which trained women
cannot find openings, jobs which women
normally do at a level lower than their
training fits them for, and on any
regulations limiting women's access to
technical or vocational training. Researchers
are also looking at the opportunities for
secondary and higher education for women
and girls aged from 15 to 24 and at both
men's and women's attitudes towards
women's education.
Tanzania's textbook
revolution
Tanzania has been rethinking and revamp¬
ing its educational system so as to make
primary education, in the words of the coun¬
try's president, Julius Nyerere, "a prepa¬
ration for life rather than simply for secon¬
dary school á complete education in
itself". New textbooks have been written
by Tanzanian specialists in their own lan¬
guage, Kiswahili, and teachers are being
re-trained for the new courses.
Music of the centuries
The article "Music of the Centuries"
which appeared in the June 1973 issue of
the Unesco Courier was attributed to Pro¬
fessor Maurice Freedman. This text will
form part of a section of a chapter on
Social and Cultural Anthropology by Pro¬
fessor Freedman to be published in 1973-
1974 by Mouton/Unesco in Part II of "Main
Trends of Research in the Social and
Human Sciences".
Professor Freedman asks us to make
clear that the above section on music was
based upon a special report prepared by
Professor Bruno Nettl of the University of
Illinois, U.S.A.
In the introduction to the chapter on
Anthropology Professor Freedman under¬
lines the fact that a large number of world
authorities in various fields of anthropology
collaborated with him in the preparation of
that chapter, which in effect is a notable
effort of international scholarship "resting
upon the labours of scholars in many parts
of the world."
The Editors regret that this information
did not accompany the article published in
our June issue.
U.N. operation
against drug addiction
Specialists from the World Health Orga¬
nization, the International Labour Organi¬
zation and thé United Nations are to help
fight the problem of drug addiction in
Thailand. The 5-year treatment and rehabi¬
litation programme to help the country's
estimated 400,000 drug addicts is the first
of its kind ever launched by U.N. specia¬
lized agencies.
Unesco films
for world TV
A new series of 15-minute colour films
for TV is being produced by Unesco's
Radio and Visual Information Division. The
films, scheduled for release later this year
and early in 1974, deal with population
problems of S.E. Asia, the historic route
in Ethiopia, saving the sea and the world's
cultural heritage. New co-productions
include a film on literacy in Tanzania (with
Swedish TV), on training and technology
(with Algerian TV), and Islamic influences
in Spanish culture (with Spanish TV).
New rabies vaccine
A new simple rabies vaccine being
developed in France and the U.S.A. may
soon replace the painful and sometimes
hazardous 21-day series of Injections with
which over a million potential rabies
victims are treated each year, according to
a report of the World Health Organization
Committee on Rabies (Technical Report
Series No. 523).
Flashes...
Gambia became Unesco's 131st member
state on August 1.
On December 10, 1973 25th anniver¬
sary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the U.N. General Assembly will
launch a Decade of Struggle Against
Racism and Racial Discrimination.
During the past ten years 300 industrial
plants that polluted Moscow's air have been
relocated or rebuilt and equipped with air-
treatment equipment.
Well over 10 million persons suffer from
leprosy, according to the World Health
Organization: 3,868,000 in Africa, 385,000 in
America, 6,475,000 in Asia, 52,000 in Europe
and 33,000 in Oceania.
40 per cent of Iceland's 200,000 popu¬

Letters to the Editor
THE GREAT
COPERNICUS
Sir,
Thank you for the lovely issue on the
great Copernicus (April 1973). The
articles and illustrations are expertly
chosen, but an article in the issue about
present-day achievements in astronomy
would have made the greatness of the
outstanding Polish scientist shine even
brighter.
I read the children's supplement to
my seven-year-old boy, but I cannot
say it fully conveys the grandeur of the
achievement of Copernicus in all its
complexity. I wonder whether this new
feature is going to be repeated in
future. I am all for it but I hope you are
not going to make the "Courier", which
is so keenly read by adults, a children's
publication.
. Readers may be interested to know
that the Soviet Union issued a special
commemorative medal for the Coper¬
nicus anniversary. The 60 mm. medal
(above) was struck at the Moscow Mint.
Alexander Arutchev,
Moscow, U.S.S.R.
THEO-LOGIC UNLOGIC
Sir,
Reactions of theologians (Pasteur
Claude Giraud, Friar Jean Oger, in your
letters column of June 1973) to Jean-
Claude Pecker's admirable "Copernicus
for Children" (April 1973 issue) were
as confused as other policies of orga¬
nized religion. If men who subdue the
earth by fire, plague, deceit and pollu¬
tion really are considered the " centre
of the world", not scientists but theolo¬
gians should be "embarrassed".
Theologians instituted the stake, in¬
quisition, crusades (including children's
crusades), holy wars, pogroms and
racist persecution. Theologians used or
tolerated horror weapons and torture
chambers. They implored the blessings
of God on instruments of death instead
of proclaiming excommunication upon
all who indulge in killing. Still today
they can't quite recognize that some¬
thing terrible has happened to men, a
slowly accelerating insanity of total des¬
truction. Such men are not the master-
work of creation. They claim in vain
dominion over all things alive.
Neither the scope of men's language
nor the size of their brain
are superior (for instance) to the six
times larger brain of tortoises and dol¬
phins and their extraordinary communi¬
cation systems (Lily). A built-in, instant
memory bank in gray whales is far
above anything man-made computers
could accomplish. Even in art and de¬
corative beauty the Australian Bower-
birds are hardly to be matched.
Senses, navigational, electronic and so¬
nar skills, instinct and reason of animals
are often incomparable.
Man-built machines faster than sound,
bombs to annihilate multitudes with one
strike, soaring skyscraper heaps, an
amok-running technocracy are rather
doubtful achievements. Just this con¬
centration of power and people might
cause men's tragic sickness of violence
(Montague) which now threatens the
whole planet.
Theologians should admit that their
tolerated, so called civilized society and
not primitive "savages" is the curse
of this earth. The recently discovered
gentle Tassadehs of the Philippines, or
some Indian tribes still escaping "civi¬
lization" deep in the jungles of the
Amazon could prove that men are able
to live in harmony with themselves,
nature and God.
Herbert Rona
Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.
SCIENCE FOR YOUNG READERS
Sir,
What a happy surprise to find an
attractive supplement for children in
your Copernicus anniversary issue.
I recall an earlier feature for young
readers, "Sophie and Bruno in the Land
of the Atom", published in your July-
August 1968 issue on Peaceful Use of
the Atom.
Though it may not be possible for
Unesco to publish a magazine designed
exclusively for world youth, I hope the
"Courier" will continue to produce simi¬
lar supplements on the major themes it
presents.
They would help to open a dialogue
between educators (teachers and pa¬
rents) and children and would encourage
youngsters to take an interest in today's
global problems.
Cristobal Suria Sorni
Valencia, Spain
We hope our reader enjoys the 8-page
section for youngsters in our August-
September 1973 issue, "Unlocking
the Secret of Tomorrow's Weather"
Editor.
IN THE CLOUDS ?
Sir,
The letter from Dr. Hildensheimer and
her 311 co-signatories (January 1973),
describing your issue on the origins of
man (August-September 1972) as a one¬
sided version of the question, might
well have been written in the Middle
Ages.
The "Unesco Courier" rightly gave
a straightforward presentation of scien¬
tific findings, tracing the emergence of
man from the forerunners of Homo
habilis down to Homo sapiens.
I wonder how much longer the minds
of some will be clouded by non-scien-
tific theories.
Guillermo Duran Duran
Girador, Colombia
20TH CENTURY MALADY
Sir,
Your issue on the abuse of drugs
(May 1973) leads one to reflect deeply
on our present century on which the
misuse of drugs and its dangers have
left their mark.
Most of the articles deal with efforts
to meet this problem through educatio¬
nal programmes in hygiene, biology,
chemistry, etc. and the pros and cons
of such education. But the fact remains
that we still face an alarming situation.
The "Unesco Courier" deserves
praise for its campaign on behalf of
mental health.
Manuel Grien do Campo
La Coruna, Spain
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
Sir,
I find your June 1973 issue "Music of
the Centuries" fascinating. Such pro¬
found studies of the musical cultures
of different nations are sources of
invaluable information in particular for
teachers and students of musical
culture.
How lovely are the photos : Indians
of the Maquiritare tribe listening to
the music of Mozart, Beethoven and
Ravel moved to ecstasy! And the
musicians of Africa, Tibet, Central Asia
and "The Angel of the Maracas"...
I feel, reading this article and looking
at the pictures, a reader himself can
be lifted to ecstasyl
Emerging from a national source the
inspired musical genius when full-grown
expands into the universal pool of
music. Music is the universal language
for the heart!
Linda Spacele-Jung,
New York, U.S.A.
HANDS OFF
FIVE-FINGERS MOUNTAIN
Sir,
Here in Cyprus a small but dedicated
group of individuals are fighting the
environment battle. They are striving to
preserve the beauty of the island by
fighting off the invaders and the destro¬
yers of the natural beauty of Cyprus.
One of these fighters is Dr. Dimitri
Souliotis, an eminent Cypriot radiologist,
who has been striving with many sup¬
porters to stop the issuing of permits to
commercial enterprises which by quar¬
rying and taking away the whole side
of a mountain are leaving scars for all
to see and deplore. This is happening
to one of the most beautiful sites of the
Kyrenia range of mountains in the north
of the island : the Pentadaktylos or Five
Fingers Mountain, so called because its
shape recalls a human hand.
I enclose photographs which show
only too clearly how man is wantonly
destroying the beauty of nature. (Be¬
low, the huge hole gouged from the
mountain by quarrying operations).

### IGNORE

The man who explored Africa's soul
The famous German anthropologist and explorer Leo Frobenius, the 100th anni¬
versary of whose birth is being celebrated this year, travelled the length and
breadth of Africa studying the ways and customs of its different peoples with
a love and understanding seldom if ever equalled (see article page 14). This rock
painting from a royal tomb, discovered by Frobenius in Rhodesia, depicts a dead
king wrapped in a cowhide shroud, one of the many forms of ancient royal burial.
