() N behalf of Unesco, I should like to join in wel-I coming the United Nations General Assembly to
Paris, the city in which Unesco has now lived and
worked for nearly two years, the capital of a country
which has played a leading role in the work of the
Ur. ited Nations and its Specialized Agencies.
We in Unesco are working to build a foundation for
peace through education, science and culture, and
through the great media of press, radio and film. This
is a long-term process which takes time and patience.
The United Nations'work at the General Assembly its
more immediate and pressing, for it will govern the
relations of the nations in the coming months and years.
Because of this, it is upon the results of these delibera-
tion.  that our own hopes for tomorrow must depend.
W are confident that the presence of so many leaders
and statesmen here in Paris during the next three months
will act as a lively stimulus to us in Unesco. Weare
all looking to the same common goal : a world society
in 1which men can live together in peace and under-
standing.Julian HUXLEY.

### 73830: University problems viewed at Utrecht Congress

University Problems Viewed
At Utrecht Congress
g
6 (i'lrJlE first proud duty of a university is to be the guardian
and trustee of the great intellectual and cultural heritage
of mankind... To the inheritance we have received we
also must add our humble portion. And this we can no longer do 10
cloistered isolation... It falls to us to strive for cultural continuity
in a world of rapid change.'
A view of Unesco House, in
Paris, where the extraordin-
ary session of General ! Con.
ference will convene on
September 15.
Last month, Mr. for L. Evans,
Vice Chancellor of the University
of Wales, spoke these words and
voiced the feeling of nearly two
hundred university leaders from
32 countries who gathered to-
gether at Utrecht, Netherlands,
from August 2-13 to discuss the
common problems of universities
all over the world.
The conference, called by Unes-
co in collaboration with the
Netherlands Government, studied
a wide range of pressing prob-
lems in the field of higher edu-
cation ranging from new demands
of inoceased enrolment and me-
thods of selecting students to
questions of finance and the role
of the university in international
understanding,
Among the problems which
aroused perhaps the greatest con-
troversy, was the question : Who
is entitled to higher education ?
Delegates from the United States
and some of the British Domin-
ions favoured the"open door"
policy of education for the many
while English and other European
representatives tended toward a
policy of restricted enrolment and
a rigid selection of students.

### 73832: Scientists create World Mental Health Federation

Scientists Create World
Mental Health Federation
EN and women everywhere, profoundly disturbed by word-
f (r\'I. wide confusion and conflict, are asking :"Can the catastrophe
of a third world war be averted ?""Can the peoples of then
world learn to co-operate for the good of all ?""On what basis is
there hope for enduring peace ?"
To consider these problems and
to study means towards their so-
lutions, some 2, 000 psychologists,
psychiatrists and sociologists
from 54 nations met during
August at the International Con-
gress on Mental Hygiene. The
delegates formed a World Federa-
tion for Mental Health which will
co-operate closely with Unesco
and the WHO.
Held in the London Central
Hall, August 11-21, the congress
had for its theme :"Mental Health
and World Citizenship". There
was wide agreement among the
delegates that a sense of inter-
national citizenship need not
conflict wl'h but rather embraces
traditional loyalties to the family,
the community and the nations
"which alone are no longer suf-
ficient for the protection of the
inter-dependent peoples of the
world".
The congress was preceded
by an International Preparatory
Commission which met from July
2-f, to August 8 to study the re-
ports prepared during the past
year by nearly 5, 000 men and
women of varying professions.
The Preparatory Commission has
issued a 40-page statement, based
in part on these reports, which
(WM submitted for consideration
and discussion to the congress.

A N extraordinary session of the Unesco General Conference is meeting in Paris on September 15th- to consider where and when its regular Third Session, which was orig ally pla ned to meet in
Beirut, Lebanon, in October, should be convened.
This special session was made necessary by the disturbed situation in the Middle East which may,
require the postponement of the Third Session or its meeting in another part of the world.
The conference will discuss a report by the Executive Board on the Third Session and
will examme the possionity ol
calling the next session in Geneva.
or Paris, should it prove impos-
sible to meet in Beirut.
At its ninth session early this
month, the Executive Board re-
commended that the General
Conference's Third Session be
held in Beirut in November, un-
less political or military develop-
ments in the Middle East make
this impossible.
The extraordinarv session will
be under the chairmanship of the
Head of the Mexican Delegation
and will meet in the main confer-
ence hall at Unesco House. The
discussions are scheduled to last
several days, but the work is
expected to be completed before
the opening of the United Na-
tions General Assembly in Paris
on September 21st.
The Conference will discuss the
date and venue of the Fourth
Session and a temporary modifi-
cation of the rules of procedure
to make it possible to give effect
to the decisions of the extra-
ordinary session.
During the meeting of the
Executive Board, a telegram kvas
received from Dr. Charles Malik,
Lebanese delegate to the Econo-
mic and Social Council of the
UN, reiterating his Government's
request that the Third Session of
the Conference be held as plann-
ed in Beirut.
Beirut Recommended
After a three-day discussion of
the problems connected with the
Third Session, the Executive
Board unanimously passed the
following resolution :
"Considering, on the one hand,
the decision of the Second Session
of the General Conference fixing
the place of the Third Session...
at Beirut and, on the other hand,
the political situation in the Near
East,
"Decides :
"1.-To submit to the extra-
ordinary session of the General
Conference in Paris on September
15, a complete report on the
question, to which report the
Director-General shall attach any
necessary information relating to
the organization of the Confer-
ence.
"II.-To recommend to the ex-
traordinary session of the Gen-
eral Conference the following two
solutions listed in order of prefer-

" (1) The maintenance of the
decision of the Mexico Confer-

Delegates to the congress in-
dicated almost unanimous sup-
port for the statement prepared
by the I. P. C. and the document
will probably be made available
to the public in the near future.
Unesco was represented on the
Preparatory Commission by Dr.
Otto Klineberg, Director of the
"Tension Project"and former
professor of Psychology at Colum-
bia University, New York.
Unesco also assisted the work
of the Preparatory Commission by
a grant of $10, 000, and the Con-
gress by another grant of $5. 000
to enable delegates from war-
devastated Member States. to
attend the meetings. Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General, Dr.
Arvid Brodersen, Acting Head of
the Social Sciences Department
and Dr. Klineberg addressed the
congress for the Organization.
Dr. Brodersen stressed the in-
terest of Unesco in the work of
the congress, declaring :"Mental
health, when conceived in its
broad terms, becomes a problem
of human relations, of interna-
tional relations, of community
living, of world citizenship,
"This very concept is basic to
the whole philosophy of Unesco
- and is, indeed, implied in the
first sentence of its constitution."

### 73833: Stix Pix Biz Nix

"STIX PIX BIZ NIX"Microfilm Readers
GSTIX PIX BIZ NIX."These are"English"words.
They are an authentic quo-
tation from a United States
periodical called Variety, a trade
journal of the 5tage, screen and
radio profession. Par from being
a joke or a misprint, these four
words constitute an important
piece of factual information.
Upon reading them, an American
actor, film producer, theatrical
agent or critic, a film distributor
or cinema usher, takes notice of
the fact that receipts from sales
cf tickets of admission to motion
picture showings in provlllcial
theatres are extremely poor. The
uninitiated reader, however, is
only mystified by such pro-
fessional jargon.
Now, let us compare these four
words with the following state-
ment :"Stimulation, through
mass communications media of
the free flow of information con-
cerning themes of the Unesco
fields of interests."This is also
a piece of factual information,
which is more or less unintelligi-
ble to a layman. It is a Unesco
phrase which describes a task
and invites specialists to convert
this curtain of words into deeds.
It is then the job of the Mass
Communications Projects Divi-
sion to translate Unesco pro-
fessional jargon into plain lan-
guage.
As soon as iWe"translators"of
the Projects Division settled
down to work last June, we
realized that our aim must be
to arouse interest, gain confi-
dence and secure co-operation
and understanding from mass
communication creative agents,
which translated reads : Befriend
people who write and edit news-
papers,, who broadcast radio pro-
grammes and who make films.
We found it extremely dangerous
to throw at them our own ver-
sion of"Stix Pix Biz Nix."
Writers and editors, broadcasters
and film-makers are busy people.
They are busy looking for good
stories. They are in search of
sharp, striking colourful facts.
They want drama anà"human
interest."Qu : te naturally they
get very irritated when con-
fronted with obscure abstrac-
tions. 
Yet we believe, that interna-
tional co-operation in the fields
of education, science and culture
is one of the best stories in the
world. We believe that the ex-
change of cultural influences and
the sharing of human progress
is full of sharp, striking, colour-
ful facts. We believe that the
incessant struggle for peace is
the greatest drama ever played.
As for"human interest", who
dares to doubt that peace has
Number One priority ?
Haw them should we convince
the hard-working and hardboiled
press, radio and film people in
the four corners of the world, of
the validity of these Unesco
beliefs ? Simply by supplying
them with down-to-earth facts,
and perhaps, at the same time,
by giving them a helping hand.
Why not attempt, while calling
their attention to world co-opera-
tion, to offer them a tool of
their trade-a practical little gift,
a token of our appreciation for
their difficult and responsibility-
laden craft.
Of course,, we are in no posi-
tion to build a colossal printing
press for them, or a powerful
wireless transmitter, nor can we
dedicate the world's largest and
best equipped film studio.
Couldn't we supply them, at
least, with a memento, a solve-'
nir, an object of daily usefulness,
like an address book or a desk
calendar ?
This is how the project of
Calendar of World Affairs was
conceived. By Christmas, 1949, ;
Unesco intends to present press,
radio and film specialists of the
world with a year-book of down-
to-earth facts concerning the i
"human interest"story Number.
I, the story of mankind's effort
to achieve peace and happiness.
i
The book is to be divided into
two main sections. The first'
will list all events of interna-
tional co-operation in the fields it
of education, science and culture,
scheduled for the comming year ; I
such as congresses, conventions,
conferences, seminars, exhibits
and festivals aimed at further-
ing understanding among nations
and advancement of human wel-
fare. Periodical appendices to this
section may be published in the
course of the year.
The second section will be a
comprehensive calendar of the
past. Internationally selected
entries will trace day by day an-
niversaries of Rreat and small

deeds, of famous and less famous
heroes, of recognized and for-
gotten milestones of Man's road
to freedom, wisdom and brother-
hood. Turning points in the lives
of great nations will be recalled,
side by side with humble gestures
of small communities and hi-
therto anonymous prophets.
Thus in 1950, the calendar will
remember that 2. 200 years ago,
Asoka, the bloody coaqueror of
India became an ardent apostle
of peace. It will recall that 19
centuries ago, Aerataos of Cap-
padocia, discovered the impor-
tance or a milk diet for the
treatment of certain diseases.
Jean de Rotrou will share the
role of the year's heroes with
Thomas Masaryk, with Goethe,
and France's Lous IX. The 350th
anniversary of Giordano Bruno's
death at the stake will be
pointed out as one of the black
days of the year, for the calen-
dar proposes to also record some
of the grim crossroads at which
the world took a step backwards.
The first meteorological bulletin
will be given due credit, and the
first day of spring will be dedi-
cated to the anonymous inventor
of the plough.
The calendar should by no
means be visualized as an ency-
clopaedia of science, education
and culture. Our conception is
rather one of a colourful alma-
nac, a prayer-book for a three
hundred and sixty-five day
memorial service to the great and
the humble whose universe we
have inherited.
It is to be hoped that the
Calendar of World Affairs, as a
handbook for men and women, of
goodwill, will be a manifesto
in plain language of Mass Com-
munications'Faith in the uni-
versal appeal of Unesco's news
material-news material of high
topical value springing from
sources'of tomorrow as well as
from an ageless yesterday.

### 73834: Book Coupon Scheme experiment under way

Book Coupon Scheme
Experiment, Under Way
THE airplane and the rad ; ohave reduced physical fron-
tiers to little more than lines on
a map And yet, many barriers
still exist which prevent people
in one country from exchanging
ideas, information or materials
with their fellow citizens in other
nations. Unesco has been attempt-
ing to remove or lower some
of these barriers by encouraging
the exchange of fellowships, the
creation of an international ins-
titute of the press and informa-
tion, promoting the improvement
of international copyright sys-
tems and facilitating the move-
ment of books and periodicals
between nations.
Even before the war many
countries found it difficult to
acquire books or magazines from
abroad. Today this problem pre-
sents even vaster difficulties. In
an even greater number of count-
ries, currency restrictions limit
severely or prevent completely
payments across national fron-
tiers. They constitute a formi-
dable barrier to the internation-
al exchange of publications
which is essential if mutual
understanding is to be m81l1-
tained.
An individual who wishes to
order a book from a foreign
publisher often finds that he
must pay in"hard"currency
- which he does not possess and
cannot obtain-because he lives
in a"soft"currency country. The
problem is the same all over the
world not only for the individual
but for institutions as well.
In an effort to overcome this
difficulty, Unesco has conceived
the idea of creating a"Book
Ooupon"which would make for-
eign purchases easier. The Book
Coupon Scheme has been devel-
oped into a practical plan and
Unesco is now almost ready to
put this plan into operation on
an experimental basin.
What is Unesco's Book Coupon
Scheme and how will it work ?
Simply defined. the Coupon
Scheme is a means of facilitating
By
Dr. J. ZUCKERMAN
Head, Unesco Clearing House
for Publications.
the purchase of educational,
scientific aid cultural publica-
tions in foreign countries by the
use of a special coupon backed
by"hard"currency. It is
designed principally, to help
"soft"currency countries to
obtain publications from"hard"
currency areas.
The scheme requires a"hard"
currency backing or reserve to
enable the agency issuing the
book coupons (in the experimen-
tal period this will be Unesco) to
sell them against"soft"curren-
cies. These currencies will tnen
be redeemable by the isSuing
agency in"hard"currency.
During the experimental per-
iod (which will not exceed one
year), Unesco will make avail-
able for the introduction of the
Book Coupon Scheme a"hard"
currency reserve of $100, 000. In
view of this limited amount, the
number of countries participat-
ing in the experiment will have
to be limited to nO more than
five or six.
Book coupons will be sold in
denomination of 25 cents, $1. 00,
$3. 00 and $10. 00 and national
distributing agencies will be se
up in each participating count-
ry. All the buyer of books
in a participating country will
have to do is purchase book
coupons from his national dis-
tributing agency by paying for
them in his national currency.
The purchaser will use the
book coupons in the same way
he would a cheque, i. e. either
send it directly to a bookseller
abroad, if he knows the price of
the publication he desires, or
make preliminary enq\liries re-
garding the cost and then send
the coupons. It is also foreseen
that books may be ordered
through local booksellers. The
coupons will be used to pay for
foreign books, periodical sub-
scriptions, or even single issues
of magazines, reprints etc.
Booksellers authorized to par-
ticipate in the Book Coupon
Scheme will accept coupons
received from abroad. During the
experimental period, however,
the number of authorized book-
sellers in each participating
country will be limited to three
or four. Coupons will be pre-
sented to Unesco at regular
Intervals for reimbursement. A
small discount, agreed upon by
participating booksellers, will be
deducted from the face value ðf
the coupons by Unesco to cover
the overhead expenses of thE
scheme.

TWO APPROACHES TO UNITY
Orient-Occident Cultural
Co-operation Stressed
THEOPHILE GAUTIER said inhis preface to Mile de Mau-
pin,"I know that there are some
who prefer mills to churches, and
bread for the body to that for the
soul. To such I have nothing to
say. They deserve to be eco-
nomi5ts in this world and also in
the next."Since Gautier wrote
this, the professors of the hu-
manities, particularly the behav-
iourists, have chosen apparently
to march in the direction of the
economists, and a publicist now-
adays feels a little apologetic
and ashamed of himself if he
cannot give the percentage of
export of Abyssinian cotton in
1948. as compared with
that in 1938. Since good
things need always to be
said again and again,
today we can improve
upon Théophile Gau-
tier'sstatementandsa. y,
"They deserve to be
professors in this life
and the ! if" hpr"", ftpr"
AS uaULler says In me same
context,"Society is suffering ; tit
is a prey to a great internal
anguish."This is as true today
as a hundred years ago ; only the
symptoms of the malaise have
a hundred years to develop and
become apparent even to the
most unthinking men. The ang-
uish behind Europe and Asia
today is a spiritual anguish as
much as it is an economic
anguish.
'The Ants Will'
The inadequacy of current
world political concepts to deal
with the world political realities
has become more apparent ;
hence the hard pessimism of the
poets and the frantic efforts of
the politicians to provide for us
a sound basis for peace. In the
World War I, we hoped to make
the world safe for democracy ; in
the postwar world today, we have
to lower our target-we'll be
quite happy if we can have a
world safe for homo sapiens.
In a debate over the air last
year with Dr. Shapley on the
twentieth-century civilization, I
urged the immediate importance
of adequate planning for peace
and asked him what was the
value or developing cancer
research to save the patients if
in the next war, both the doc-
tors, nurses and the cancer
patients were killed outright by
an atom bomb, and who world
survive ? Dr. Shapley curtly
replied that the ants would.
What comforting thought for
man. who in Victorian times was
sMB the"crown of the crea-
t1oD".
Security
The most horrible word that
bas silently crept into current use
today is the ! World"security".
Every day we are talking about
security. We are talking about
security because we haven't got
it the victorious no more than
the vanquished. We are talking
about security as a man suffering
from stomach ulcer likes to talk
about his stomach. But if there
is no security, it is because the
accepted ideas of our age, the
current coins of our thinking, are
inadequate or outdated by the
march of economic-political
events, because"society is prey
to an internal anguish". In other
words, there must be a recon-
St : ruct1on on the level of ideas,
and we must think fast.
That there is an upheaval of
idea* in present-day Europe is
axiomatic. That there is an
equal upheaval of ideas in Asia
Js perhaps less appreciated.
Nascent nationalism and the des-
truction of the spiritual founda-
tions of eastern cultures create
a chaos in the realm of ideas and

East and West shall meet and
respect each other only as man
to man But a qualification is
necessary : they can meet and
understand and respect each
other, not as one soldier to
another, as Kipling childishly
implies, but as a man of ideas to
another-not as fighters, but,
reluctantly I must use the word,
as philosophers.
It is quite apparent that the
East needs the West and the
West needs the East, each in its
groping toward a more satisfac-
tory design for liying, and in
humility and mutual respect we
shall meet. This is quite apparent
to everybody except the sub-
scribers to Kipling's cocky"civiliz-
ing mission"theory (of which
MussolLni was one) and the
theory of"Give everybody a
quart of milk a day and that is
that".
A synthesis for a culture of a
richer and better-balanced type
is lying somewhere, ready to be
worked out by the mind of man,
a synthesis of the materialistic
and the idealistic concept of
life, of science and mysticism, of
greater importance being laid on
the cultural values and less em-
phasis being laid on the economic
values.
All Asiatic philosophies are
monistic and idealistic, and to-
day our traditional concepts of
matter and the nineteenth-
century mechanistic physics have
undergone a vast revolution that
the layman hardly realizes.
The duty of philosophy today
is no less than the rediscovery
of the concept of man. Thinkers
and scholars like Professor Hock-
ing of Harvard and Professor
Northrop of Yale have occupied
themselves with such diggings

After all, a contact of

Unesco Exhibit Opens
in Paris September 15
II N an effort to convey a
M graphic over-alt picture of
how Unesco operates, what
Its aims are, what it has already
been able to do and the things
it hopes to do in the near future,
the Bureau of Public Information
is preparing a special exhibit in
the Main Hall of Unesco House,
scheduled to open on September
15.
The exhibit, prepared to coin-
cide with the opening of the Ex-
traordinary Session of Unesco's
General Conference and the UN
General Assembly, will show resi-
dents and visitors in Paris how
Unesco, as a Specialized Agency,
fits into the family of the United
Nations system working for the
cause of peace.
The exhibit will be divided into
eight huge, colourful panels sur-
rounded by many smaller ones
grouped in a semi-circle around
the main lobby of the former
Hotel Majestic (now Unesco
House). A central, introductory
panel will outline Unesco's reta-
tionship with the parent body at
Lake Success and the relation
between Unesco and the other
Specialized Agencies of UN.
The Second Session of the
Unesco General Conference in
Mexico City approved a pro.
gramme for 1948 grouped under
six main headings : Reconstruc-
tion, Communication, Education,
Cultural Interchange, Human
and Social Relations and Natural
Sciences. The Unesco exhibit, by
the use of maps, charts, photo-
graphs and drawings will depict
"Unesco in Action"in these
fields throughout the world.
Unesco believe for example that
its most urgent single task is to
help overcome the crucial situa-
tion in the fields of science, edu-
cation and the arts throughout
the war-devastated regions of
Europe and Asia. One of the exhi-
bit panels by the use of image
and word, will emphasize this
problem.
Adjoining panels will trace
Unesco's work with Children'
Villagers, and Youth Camps, the
Organization's co-operation with
the Temporary Educational Coun-
cll for Educational Reconstruc.
tion (T. I. C. E. R.), tending to de-
monstrate how Unesco is stimu-
lating and co-ordinating volun-
tary efforts for reconstruction.
The remaining panels will
present similar pictorial treat.
Ment of the other aspects of
Unesco's work, explaining educa-
tional seminars in Great Britain,
the U. S. and Czechoslovakia, the
International Theatre Institute,
the Book Coupon Scheme, the
Hylean Amazon Institute, the
Field Science Co-operation Offices
in Latin America, Egypt, India,
China, etc.
Conceived as  permanent part
of Unesco House, the exhibit will
be open to the publle after
September 1i..

### 73836: Pragmatic viewpoints on human rights

Pragmatic Viewpoint
On Human Rights
PROFESSOR lUARIT AIN S1\ YS
CONFLICTING IDEOLOGIES NO OBSTACLE
THE drawing up of- *-an International
Declaration of H'. 1-
man Rights is
present one of tL
most difficult task
in the hands of the
United Nations, and
one must not expect
too much of it, states
M. Jacques Maritain,
distinguished philo-
sopher and French
Ambassador to the
Holy See.
M. Maritain, how-
ever, adds, wit h
guarded optimism, !
that"If we adopt a
practical viewpoint
and concern ourselves
no longer with seek- !
ing the basis and
philosophic signifi- !
cance of Human
Rights, but only with
their statement and
enumeration, agree-
ment on the funda-
mental rights of the
individual is pos-
sible".
M. Maritain ex-
presses these views
in an introduction to
a collection of the
mu. s1i : : >lgUIllCi : tUI" a. t : xa. : s rect=IVtXl
from ! world thinkers in the
course of a survey by Unesco on
the philosophic bases of Human
Rights. The book will soon be
published in English and French
editions.
In this introduction, M. Mari-
tain analyses the various aspects
of the problem and reviews the
chances of reaching tangible
results.
The chief obstacle to agreement
on an international declaration
of Human Rights, he says, is the
existence of many schools of
thought,"each of which brings
its particular view and justifica-
tion of individual rights, leaning
in various degrees towards the
classical or the revolutionary in-
terpretation".
How, M. Maritain asks, can we
imagine an agreement of minds
between men who are gathered
together precisely in order to ac-
complish a common intellectual
task... and who not only belong
to different cultures and civiliza-
tions, but are of antagonistic spi-
ritual associations and schools of
thought ?"
The writer provides the answer
by explaining that agreement is
possible if it is"given a pragmatic
rather than theoretical approach...
to make practical conclusions ac-
ceptable to both parties as points
of convergence in practice, how-
ever opposed the theoretic view-
points.
"Where it is a question of ra-
tional interpretation and justifi-
cation, of speculation or theory,
the problem of Human Rights
involves the whole structure of
moral and metaphysical (or anti-
metaphysical) convictions held
by each of us. So long as minds
are united in faith or philosophy,
there will be mutual conflicts
between interpretations and jus-
tifications.
"Is it, therefore, surprising, M.
Maritain further asks, that, while
all... systems quarrel over the
whys and wherefores, yet in their
practical conclusions they pres-
cribe rules of behaviour identical
for a given age and culture ?"
Two Antagonistic Groups
M. Maritain then deals with
Human Rights from the point of
view of philosophic doctrine.
"Men, he says. are today divided...
into two antagonistic groups :
those who, to a greater or lesser
extent, explicitly accept, and
those who, to a greater or lesser
extent, explicitly reject Natural
Law as the basis of those rights.
"In the eyea of the first, the
requirements of his being endow
Jacques MARITAIN.
man with certain fundamental
and inalienable rights antecedent
in nature and superior to society,
and are the source whence social
life itself, originates and develops,
with the duties and rights which
that implies.
"For the second school, man's
rights are relative to the histo-
rical developments of society and
are themselves constantly varia-
ble and in a state of flux ; they
are a product of society itself as
it advances with the forward
march of history."
Such an ideological contrast
is irreducible and no theoretical
reconciliation is possible, but 1f
we follow a practical viewpoint,
Professor Maritain goes on,", ewe
have before Us an entirely differ-
ent picture, where no theoretical
simplification is any more in
question ; then not only is agree-
ment possible between the mem-
bers of opposing philosophic
schools, but it must be said
plainly that the operative factors
are... less the schools of philo-
sophy than currents or
thoughts..."
Collective Intelligence
The writer then emphasize
that"admission of a particular
category of rights is not the ex-
clusive posscssior of any school
of thought and the gain of col-
lective intelligence under the in-
fluence of its several cross-
ourrents go far beyond the dispu-
stations of the schools". And, in
practice, everyone sees that these
rights, being human, are subject,
like every other human thing, to
modification and limitation.
Professor Maritain illustrates
his view by giving the following
example :"If a criminal, he says.
can justly be condemned to lose
his life, it is because he has, by
his crime, deprived himself, not
of his right to existence, but
rather of the possibility of
demanding that right with jus-
tice : morally, he has cut himself
off from membership of the human
community, as far as concerns
the use of the fundamental and
'inalienable'right which the
penalty imposed prevents his
exercising."
It is entirely normal, the
French philosopher thinks, that
the various aCknowledged rights
of the individual should be mut-
ually limitative and in particular
that economic and social rights.
"the rights of man as a social
animal, cannot take their place
in human history without some
restriction upon the freedom and
rights of man as an individu'tl",

recent co-ordination meeting in Geneva.
Educators Study U. N.y
For C ! assroom TeachingEo C
lrHElate Frar. klin D. Roo-
sevelt used to say thatH there could never be peace
on earth until all nations
of the world became"Good
Neighbours."The United Na-
tions was created in the hope of
achieving the world good neigh-
bourliness w h i c h Roosevelt
sought, by bringing peoples and
countries closer together and re-
ducing the differences which
keep them apart. But the success
of the United Nations depends,
essentially, on the''measure of
support and understanding that
the citizens of the world give it.
For nearly two years, in 1947
and 1948. Unesco made world-
wide surveys of teaching about
the U. N. and its Specialized
Agencies in elemertary and se-
condary schools. From the in-
formation obtained, it was dis-
covered that teaching on this
subject was scattered both in
intensity ap. d geographically, and
that entire areas of the world
had not yet begun to give ins-
truction on the U. N.
To help remedy this situation,
Unesco and the United Nations
joined forces this summer in
sponsoring a six-week's Seminar
at Adelphi College, near the U. N.
headquarters at Lake Success,
under the direction of the dis-
tinguished Chinese scholar, Dr.
Y. R. Chao, professor at the Uni-
versity of California. Fifty-two
educators from 28 countries there
gained a deeper insight and
understanding of the work of the
United Nations and its Special-
ized Agencies. Participants ex-
plored the best methods of
presenting the U. N. system to
children and young people up to
the age of 18. They examined
and criticized existing materials
for such teaching purposes, and
prepared new materials for the
schools of their own countries.
At the close of that period.
this heterogeneous group rep-
resenting many cultures had
rapidly developed into an inter-
national community imbued with
understanding, mutual respect
and co-operation.
Practical cl. alJSroom
materials
One of the most tangible
results of the 1948 Seminar is a
series of practical classroom
materials on the U. N. and its
Specialized agencies, prepared by
the participants. These mate-
rials, which were produced in
several languages, cover a wide
variety of topics and included
filmstrips. recordings, pamphlets
and study guides.
Recordings, for example ;' were
made in English on the Securitv
Council and the Palestine ques-
tion and on the World Health
Organization in Egypt and is the
Philippines. A radio script was
written for young children in
Norwegian and in English on the
Food and Agricultural Organiza-
tion. The programme also in-
clu<led a visit to Lake Success
and the International Control of
Atomic Energy.
A novel on U. N. for young
children was begun in Norwegian
and a study guide for teachers
on Unesco. was also started in
German. Several papers were
prepared as general outline for
Ministries of Education or for
United Nations officials. Among
these were memoranda prepared
for Pakistan, Chile, Uruguay and
Canada on Teaching about the
United Nations and a paper on
presenting the U. N. in the Arab
World.
More Effective Teaching
Participants also drafted a
plan. for making teaching about
the U. N. and its Agencies more
effective. This stressed the pre-
paration of materials on U. N.
activities in language other than
English and French, the encou-
ragement of regional and na-
tional seminars and the joint
U. N.-Unesco sponsorship of 10-
day conferences in international
centers.
Members of the Seminar made
a special trip to Hyde Park,
where Mrs. Roosevelt spoke to
them informally on the work of
the Come ; scion on Human-
Rights.
After their return to their
home countries, the Seminar par-
ticipants will undoubtedly be-
come leaders in the interpreta-
tion of the United Nations and
its Specialized agencies to chil-
dren, young people and adults in
schools around the world.

To Lower News Barriers
"'''IRA T happens to a foreign
W correspondent's news dis-
patch when he steps into
a cable office to send a story to
his newspaper or news agency at
home ? Does a censor's blue pen-
cil blot out the passages that are
considered unfavourable ? Does
the dispatch lie around the cable
office for hours unsent, while his-
tory rushes past ?
And what went into the making
of the story ? Was the corres-

where he wished to gather infor-
mation ? Did government officials
talk to him freely or was he
limited to a government approved
press release ? Finally, when he
sat down at a type, writ. er to com-
pose his story, to tell to the peo-
ple of his country what happened
that day in this foreign land, did
he have to choose his words care-
fully, lest tomorrow he be sum-
moned before an official and
given a curt notification of expul-
sion ?
These are questions which are
a common concern of Unesco and
the United Nations. Free flow of
information, not alone that con-
tained in newspapers, but in ra-
dio broadcasts, newsreels and
magazines as well, is a primary
objective on which the two inter-
national organizations have
worked out close and effective
liaison.
The Initial Move
The initial move was taken by
the United Nations General As-
sembly, when, at its First Session.
it instructed the Economic am
Social Council to convene a
World Conference to study"the
rights, obligations and practices
included in the concept of
freedom of information". Imme-
diately afterwards, the First
General-Conference of Unesco, in
December 1946, delegated to ttM
Department of Mass Communi-
cations of Unesco the task of
joint action with the United Na-
tions in this field.
Geneva Conference
To lay the ground for the
Un : ted Nations Conference on
Freedom of Information, the Eco-
nomic and Social Council set up
under the Commission, on Human
Rights a Sub-Commission on
Freedom of Information and the
Press. Unesco sent a member
of its Secretariat to. the Human
Rights Division, and for five
months at Lake Success the two
secretariats worked together in
preparation for the forthcoming
word conference.
The Conference was held in
Geneva from 23rd March to 21st
April 1948 and was attended by
delegates from 54 nations, in-
cluding 30 Member States of
Unesco. Seven members of the
Unesco Secretariat, including the
Director-General, were present
during the Conference.
The Unesco representatives
went to Geneva under broad in-
structions from the 1947 General
Conference of the Organization
"to promote the principles stated
in Unesco's Constitution and the
policies adopted by the General
Conference". Dr. Huxley, in a
speech at the opening session of
the First Commission, went to the
heart of what proved to be the
major issue confronting the Con-
ference. He called for real and
concrete freedom of information,
but stressed that such freedom
imposed commensurate responsi-
bilities of truth and the main-
tenance of peace. ;
In line with Dr. Huxley's em-
phasis on the practical aspects
of keeping the people informed,
Unesco's contribution to the con-
ference was in proposing ways in
which to enlarge the facilities for
disseminating information. Unesco
submitted eight working docu-
ments, on the basis of which the

EMBRACES F) W
By Walter M 
U nesco DE
DirectorGE
One hears a great deal in UnitedNations circles these days about
the need for co-ordination.
Indeed, it would seem sometimes that
co-ordination is expected to provide the
answer to all our difficult international
problems.
w n. y is tn. ere this preoccupatton wztn. co-ordination ?
The reason is that there are so many separate units in
the structure of international co-operation. First of all,
there are the fifty-eight sovereign member states of the
United Nations. ese are the primary units of co-ope-
ration. Then there are the Assembly 0/the United
Nations, the Economic and Social Council, the Security
Council, the Trusteeship Council, and the United Nations
Secretariat. Finally there are the eleven Specialized
Agencies, each with its different set of ember states,
its supreme legistalive body, and its own secretariat.
The work of all these public institutions requires co-
ordination, to achieve peace and to promote the com-
mon welfare. It is a. pluralistic structure ; there is no
single body with full and final authority.
Since the United Nations Agencies are agents or their
various member states, the first step toward co-ordina-
tion would seem to be the co-"Ordination at a national
level of national policies, vis-a-vis the varous United
Nations Agencies to which each Member State belonu. ..
If this were fully accomplished, even despite the dif-
ferences in national memberships of the Specialized
Agencies, the principal remaining task would be the
resolution of differing national policies in the United
Nations Agencies.
The Charter of the United Nations recognized, 8. 1
course, that complete co-ordination in this way would
be difficult of achievement. In any case, these would
still be required as a means of ensuring a United Nation
approach to the host of international economic ana
social problems.
The Economic and Social Council was created with
special functions in this respect. But in addition, since
it had been decided to set up Specialized Agencies for
operations in the various economic and social fields, the
Economic and Social Council was given also the task
of co-ordinating the work of these Agencies. The pro-
gress of the Council in carrying out these responsibilities
was discussed during its last session at Geneva in July
and August, and will be reported to the current United
Nations Assembly.

### 73838: World body strives to lower news barriers

Conference adopted a number of
resolutions.
One resolution commended
Unesco for its investigation of the
technical needs in press, radio
and films in war-devastated count-
ries. It urged the Economic and
Social Council to instruct the Spe-
cialized Agencies"to assist Unesco
in its task of reducing the inequa-
lities in information facilities
caused by the devastations due to
war, or other handicaps."
A parallel resolution adopted by
the Conference highlighted the
acute need for newsprint in cer-
tain war-devastated countries, as
established by the Unesco inquiry.
This resolution endorsed a Unesco
plan for providing emergency aid
in newsprint for France, the Ne-
therlands and China, and asked
that similar aid be extended to
other countries where a shortage
of newsprint was depriving the
people of adequate information
through their press.
A similarly realistic approach
motivated Unesco's introduction
of a motion designed to bring
more information into homes and
schools everywhere by reducing to
a minimum the C06t of owning a
radio receiving set.
Unesco's project for establishing
an International Institute of Press
and Information was also ap-
proved by the conference and a
resolution requested the Economic
and Social Council to place its
influence behind the implementa-
tion of the plan.
To the General Assembly
In addition to these and other
resolutions, the United Nations
Conference on Freedom of Infor-
mation adopted three draft con-
ventions. Two of them were de-
signed to promote a free flow of
informat : on. The third proposed
a procedure for publicizing a gov-.
ernment's answer to information
it deemed false.
The Economic and Social Coun-
cil, meeting in Geneva in August
1948, passed on these proposals
with slight amendments to the
Third Session of the United Na-
tions General Assembly, opening
in Paris on 21st September 1948.

U NE of the areas in. whichagencies of the United Na-
tions are developing co-or-
dination is in the field of inter-
national fellowships and technical
training.
Unesco, from its inception, has
stimulated international educar
tional exchange through its clear-
ing-house activities on interna-
tional fellowship schemes and its
programme of Unesco and Unesco-
sponsored fellowships in educa-
tional, scientific and cultural sub-
jects (1). The International Chit-
dren's Emergency Fund has insti-
tuted programmes in Child Wel-
fare and pediatrics. The Food
and Agriculture Organization has
recently instituted a small pro-
gramme of fellowships for agri-
cultural experts. The Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far
East, while not operating a direct
programme, has been instructed
to develop international industrial
training within its region. The
International Labour Office is
interested in the promotion of
vocational training on the inter-
national level.
These programmes and inter-
ests, representing as they do
various fields of study and inves-
tigation, involve many common
problems of administration and
co-ordination. To develop more
uniform procedures, to avoid over-
lapping in planning, to develop
ways of mutual assistance in ad-

### 73839: UNESCO-UN: teamwork embraces five continents

I TEAMWORK--
E CONTINENTS
u C LAVES Meanwhile, very substantial progress
It. has been made by the Secretariats to-
ward èo-ordinating the execution of the
programmes adopted by their various
'General Agencies. Some illustrations in fields in
which Unesco is involved are presented
on this page. There are others, such as
the promotion of fundamental education (UN, WHO,
FAO and the rationalisation of scientific abstracting
(WHO) in which Unesco has also worked closely mitt
other United Nations Agencies.
Collaboration among all the Specialized Agencies under
the leadership of the United Nations has resulted in
real progress toward developing a strong and efficient
international civil service in all the Agencies ; in
estab, ishing comparable budgetary and financial prac-
tices ; in co-ordinating publications, information and
statistical programmes ; in planning for regional offièes
and in the co-ordination of conference calendars.
The progress made in thus pulling together for opera-
tional purposes the otherwise essentially independent
units has been due to painstaking and almost daily
consultation among the staffs concerned. Important, of
course, have been the formal agreements negotiated
among the United Nations and Specialized Agencies, the
periodic reviews by the Economic and Social Council
and by the Assembly's Advisory Committee on Adminis-
trative ond Budgetary questions.
But the first requisite of co-ordination has been the
development of work habits in the several secretariats,
to ensure that United Nations problems are, in fact,
approached, with the full resources of all the United
Nations Agencies and not only those of any single one.
The procresx'made to date relates largely to eo-ordf-
nating work plans under programmes and policies
adopted by the separate Agencies. A real gap in the
United Nations process still exists, therefore, in the
absence, so far, of adequately co-ordinated programme
and policy planning before each of the legislative bodies
of the Agencies concerned determine the programme four
their respective secretariats.
Here lies an important field of activity for the Econo-
mic and Social Council, aided by the principal adminis-
trative officers of the Agencies. Not until more substan-
tial progress is made at this points can we hope to
harness the full resources of the Specialized Agencies
and the United Nations for the attainment of the ends
set forth in their various harters.
() all the Specialized Agen-cies of the United Nations,
none is more essentially
concerned than Unesco with the
maintenance and development of
human rights. The very terms of
Unesco's Constitution impose on
the Organizaion the duty or
fighting against the agents of dis-
cord and war through education,
science and culture and modern
means of communication. The
Organization's final aim is to
help maintain peace and human
happiness.
Now what can threaten human
rights more directly than war and
warlike tendencies ? Or, on the
other hand, what can be a
stronger force for peace than the
unhampered development of
every nation a. nd every man ?
The maintenance or peace and
the advancement of human
happiness are therefore two tasks
indissolubly linked, always to be
considered together ; they are in
fact two aspects of the same
ideal-the attainment of human
rights.
Economic and Social
Council Recommendation
It was this idea which, on the
proposal of the Commission on
Human Rights, brought forth the
Economic and Social Council's
recommendation that Unesco
should co-operate in its work for
the promotion of justice and
peace. The chief ways in which
Unesco can further the work of
the Economic and Social Council
are :. the working out by expert

Philosophk
ElIquirie...."
With this in mind, Unesco has
included in its programme, since
the first months of i. its existence,
a philosophic enquiry regarding
the bases of human rights. Since
the classic declaration of the 18th
century was issued the material
and political conditions of human
life have been fundamentally
transformed ; philosophical con-
cepts and political ideologies have
also completely changed. But no
attempt has so for been made to
reach agreement on t ! the basic
human rights by seeking the
opinion of the most enlightened
citizens of alJ countries. What
are the prospects for man in so-
ciety ? What dangers jeopardize
the attainment of his most
elementary rights ? What part
should be played by society and
the State ? What relationship
exists between the old acknow-
ledged rights, which were chiefly
civil and political, and the newly
claimed rights, which are econo-
mic and social ? How do the right
to education, cultural rights, the
right to free expression of thought
and the right to adequate infor-
mation fit in with the other
rights ? And, to go deeper,, what is
individual man, what is his place
in his own particular community
and in the world community.
Such are the essential questions
which arise and they can well be
described as philosophic ques-
tions.
Unesco wished to consult the
most enlightened minds in all
countries on these vital problems.
More than 250 outstanding per-
sons, including not only philo-
sophers and moralists but also
artists, scientists"sociologists and
men of action, were invited to
send replies to these questions to
the Secretariat. The National
Commissions for Unesco have
been associated in this extensive
undertaking. On the basis of some
seventy replies received from
widely differing areas of the
world, a Committee of Experts,
including representatives of the
chief philosophic tendencies, and
more especially of political philo-
jtophy, ha drawn up positive con-
clusions.
At the same time, Unesco offer-
ed the results of this enquiry to
the United Nations in connexion
with the drafting of the world

on Human Rights, Unesco, which,
as a Specialized Agency, had been
consulted on the draft charter on
human rights, was able to trans-
mit to the United Nations the
conclusions of this enquiry. At
the request of the Information
Department of the United Na-
tions, it also provided the UN
Bulletin with some of the essays
which had been sent by corres-
pondents. The United Nations
were thus able to publish the
texts specially. written for Unes-', O

ritain, E. H. Carr, Quincy Wright,

The Most Representative
- c'Mind. <,
Thus, by *cal : ing upon some of
the most enlightened and repre-
sentative minds in the world, by
striving to overcome the doctrinal
conflicts of the day in order to
reach the common core of
humanism, the more or less
obscure realization of which
animated the Allies in the com-
mOn war against fascism in all
its forms, and by trying to per-
ceive that deep harmony of ideals
which the various political philo-
sophies suggest that mankind
would reach by seemingly con-
tradictory ways and means, Unes-
co has found in the domain of
human rights in collaboration
with UN another opportunity of
carrying out its action for the
promotion of international un-
derstanding and human happi-
ness.
By publishing a volume con-
taining substantial extracts from
the replies received on the philo-
sophic problem of human rights,
Unesco. will help to sharpen and
inform the already considerable
interest taken by the public in the
difficult and vital questions which
the United Nations are required
to solve today, as ; well as to pre-
pare the way for the new world
of tomorrow.

in New York and began the tre-
mendous job of clearihg the
selected si'e-these and other
stories are vividly fold in films
prepared by the United Nations
Film Board.
The U. N. Film Board is com-
posed of members of the Secre-
tariats of the United Nations
and the Specialized Agencies
concerned with the use of films
and all visual media including
filmstrips, still photographs and
posters. It is composed of fOUl
Charter Members : the UN De-
partment of Public Information
(DPI). Uneseo. FAO and ILO.
In addition other Specialized
Agencies collaborate in the work
of the Board. They include
WHO, IRO. International Civil
Aviation Organization. Interna-
tional Monetary Fund, Interna-
tional Trae Organization and
the International Bank. for Re-

construction and Development.
The Board coordinates the
film activities of the Members
and directs and stimulates the
production, distribution, and use
of films serving the purposes
and policies of the United Na-
tions and the Specialized Ages-
cies.
In this way the specialized
knowledge and services of each
of the Members is mae avail-
able to all, and subjects coming
within the field of interest of
sevecal Members are dealt with
efficiently. The detailed work of
the Board is handled by an
Executive Office consisting of
the film staff of the U. N. Dept.
of Public Information in New
York, headed by M. Jean Be-
noit-Levy and the staff of the
Mass Communications Dept. of
Unesco in Paris, headed by
Mr. William Farm.
The success of the Board's
international production program-
me was recently demonstrated
by the award of an"Oscar"of
the U. S. Motion Picture Aca-
demy to one of its documentary
films. Entitled"First Steps"the
10-minute documentary tells of
the rehabilitation of crippled
children.
Among other films already
produced under the direction of
the U. N. Dept. of Public Infor-
mation are-"The People's
Charter","Searchlight on the
Nations","Maps We Live By".
"Clearing the Way", and three
films produced in India ftf the
Social Affairs Department of
the U. N. entitled,"Mother",
"Child", and"Oommunity".
Other films are being pro-
duced by film companies in
France, Belgium. Czechoslovakia,
Poland. Netherlands, Sweden,
U. K. and the U. S. A. The subjects
include the fight against illite-
racy, juvenile delinquency, ligh-
thouses, and timber. In addition
to these films for which the
United Nations itself provides
the producion money, the Board
is sponsoring the production of
a number of films independently
financed by film companies.
The Board is also organizing
an information service on films
and filmstrips serving the pur-
poses of its Members. In this
field Unesco has compiled draft
international lists of films and
filmstrips on the following sub-
jects : International Understand-
ing and Co-operation. Fundamen-
tal Education (including elemen-
tary hygiene, public health, and
agriculture), the Arts, and the
Popularization of Science.
These lists have been sent
through the Member Statee to
film specialists throughout the
world for amplification and
amendment. The lists when re-
vised and edited will be made
available to producers, distribu-
tors, and users of educational
films in all countries.
Typical of the Board's activi-
ties is a task recently undertaken
jointly by U. N. Dept. of Infor-
mation and the Mass Communi-
cations Dept. of Unesco for the
Committee which is preparing
for the 1949 United Nations
Scientific Conference on the
Conservation and Utilisation of
Resources (UNSCCUR). A list
has been made of existing films
on the subjects to be dealt with
by the Conference and a report
prepared on films which are
urgently needed to present to
the peoples of the world the
world resources problems which
the Conference will discuss.
The final stage of the work
will be to persuade national film
production agencies in various
countries to produce the films
which are needed, as a contribu-
tion to understanding between
peoples and the common welfare
of all peoples. ?,.

Unesco-sponsored summer school
September 2-28, to study the edu-
cational role of public libraries
and to develop means of fur-
thering international understand-
ing through such institutions.
The summer school, first of
its kind on an international scale
is being co-sponsored by the
International Federation of Li-

fessional library groups in the
United Kingdom.
Director of the four-week sum-

Public Libraries in Manchester.
Some fifty working librarians,
more than half of them from

making the public library a more
effective educational medium and
for developing its role in better-

### 73830: University problems viewed at Utrecht Congress

(Continued from Page 1.)
Pointing out that the U. S. pol-
icy is to provide higher educa-
tion to as many people as pos-
sible rather than to a select few,
Dr. Thomas R. McConneII, of the
University of Michigan (U. S. As,
declared :
"In England, less than 2 % of
university-age young people at-
tended the universities there in
1947, whereas about 15 % of the
18-21 year age group attended
institutions of higher learning in
the United states."Dr. McConnell
cited President Truman's Commis-
sion on Higher Education Report
which recommends a university
enrolment of double the present
2, 300, 000 students by 1960.
Professor Georges Scelle of the
Faculty of Law, University of
Paris, on the other hand, express-
ed the view that higher educa-
tion"is the culture of an é1ite
... the aim of the university is
to be the genesis of thought for
the elite."
"We see a danger", he added,
"in an inflation of diplomas
which might deprive them of all
their value, Or even [in] an in-
flation of the number of students.
The result would be not the
selection of an elite, but a system
of"mass education", which is in-
consistent with the very notion
of higher education."
Professor Jan B. Kozak, of
Charles (Caroline) University,
Prague, regretted the overcrowd-
ing in schools and universities in
his address to the delegates, and
cited cases of lecturers speaking,
in some instances, to as many as
1, 000 students at once. He stress-
ed the problem of training of
younger people for academic
careers.
"Any hep from international
organizations", he said,"will be
keenly appreciated ; it will consti-
tute one of the best investments
ever made."He asked Unesco to
make this need widely known, and
recalled the disruptiort in educa-
tion caused by German occupa-
tion forces in Czechoslovakia.
The same story of overcrowded
universities, lack of teachers,
destroyed or outmoded education-
al equipment was told by repre-
sentatives of many countries in
their reports on the conditions of
higher education in their native
lands. For the most part, institu-
tions were eagerly seeking to over-
come these deficiencies and meet
the needs of expanding enrol-
ment.
As Dr. Matta Akrawi, Chief of
the Division of Higher Educa-
tion, Iraq, pointed out :"The
great influx of students into
institutions of higher learning
and their insistent demands for
admission in even larger num-
bers... is a phenomenon here
to stay in most countries, as deep
social forces are at work, and the
sooner the universities face this
situation squarely the better."
The conference recognized that
the role of the university was, to
a large degree, determined by the
attitude of each nation. But it
urged that"universities should
consider afresh the part they must
play in economic and social edu-
cation... that many students
capable of higher education still
lack the opportunity of achieving
It.. then no university can af-
ford to neglect the moral and
aesthetic development of its stu-
dents and special emphasis must
be laid on the importance of com-
munity life... that much greater
effort should be expended than
at present on research in the
social sciences and creative work
in the humanities... and that
the university has a wide social
responsibility to the nation and
beyond the nation to humanity at
large."
The conference frankly recog-
nized that an increasing propor-
tion of support for higher educa-
tion would come from public
sources, but stated,"There is in
general little apprehension of the
development of sinister aspects of
state aid. The danger is always
there but it is latent rather than
actual."
A specific programme of activ-
ities leading to the acceptance
by the university of greater res-
ponsibility for the development of
international understanding was
recommended. Perhaps the most
immediately significant is the..,. J",-e ( ; Ul11HlC : : tllua vlUli VU v
universities accept aaccept a
responsibility for train-
ing persons for employ-
ment in positions in-
volving contacts with
peoples of other gov-
ernments or nations.
The conference was
unanimous in its re-
commendations that
international co-opera-
tion among universities 
is desirable and ne-
cessary. In fact, it
initiated the first steps
essential to provide the i'
necessary machinery'
for such co-opera-
tion. ;
It set up an Interim \
Committee of ten mem-
berg (nominating nine) I
to draw up a proposed
constitution, for an in- !
temational association, t
of universities. The Committee'
will also administer an Inter-
national Universities Bureau to
be created immediately and plan
for another world conference'
of universities sometime after
August, 1950.
The Bureau will serve as a
world university information off-
ice supplying educational leaders
and students with vital data on
school statistics, encourage the
exchange of students and faculty
through distributing information
about summer courses and travel
tours, availability of scholar-
ships and staff vacancies. By pro-
viding up-to-date information one
university equipment, the Bureau
will also act as an important cen-'
tre for improving the distribution
and exchange of laboratory ma-
terials, books and other technical'
equipment for university study
and research.
Dr. Francis J. Brown, Unesco
programme specialist in higher
education, who played a leading
role in the preparatory work of
the conference and acted as its
Secretary-General, recently rev :
marked : I
"The universities of the world
stand in a unique position. There
is a universality of intellectual life
which over-rides barriers of poli-
tical or otha-differences... t
is earnestly hoped that the Uni-
versities Conference at Utrecht,
made a significant contribution to
the mutual understanding of the
universities of the world and,
hence, to world peace."

### 73836: Pragmatic viewpoints on human rights

TWO APPROACHES
TO UNITY.
Maritain
(Continued from Page 3.)
Consequently, M. Maritain
strongly urges the establishment
of a scale of values, for"all
depends on the ultimate value
whereon those rights depend and
in terms in which they are ire-
tegrated by mutual limitations. It
is in terms of the scale of values
which is thus acknowledged that
the means are established where-
by... Human Rights, economic and
social, as well as individual, shall
impinge on. life".
M. Maritain thinks that by
following this line of thought, the
extent and limits of the practical
agreement of Human Rights...
would become clear. The agree-
ment on that subject must, there-
fore, also cover the scale of
values.
The Function of Language
While expressing doubts as to
the success of such an enterprise,
M. Maritain lavs considerable
stress on the function of language
which, he says, has been 80 much
perverted and the truest words
so pressed into the service of lies,
that even. the noblest and most
solemn declaration could not suf-
fice to restore to the peoples faith
in Human Rights. That is where
the scale of values plays its big
part.
For, if peoples were to agree on
the means of securing effective
respect for Human Rights, they
would have to have in common,
however, at least some"philo-
sophy of life".
In conclusion, wending some-
thing better, M. Maritain says
that"a declaration of Human
Rights agreed by the nations
! Would be a great thing in itself,
a word of promise for the down-
cast and oppressed throughout all
lands, the beginning of the chang-
es which the world requires, the
first condition precedent for the
later drafting of a universal
charter of civilized life".

### 73835: Orient - Occident cultural co-operation stressed

Dr. LII YUTAII
. (Continued from Page 3..)
On the other hand, the West
must teach the East the dignity of
the individual and other demo-
cratic concepts. Or if the West
is losing confidence in its own
doctrine of individualistic so-
ciety (as Dr. Benes said,"The
theory of liberal society has been
theoretically and pratically over-
thrown"), the East, from its own
perspective, may say to the West,
"You fools, vou are thrawing
away the best thing ; you have
got. You may have to throw
some forms of it away practically
and develop modifications. But if
you throw away theoretically the
basic theory that the state exists
for the individual and not the
individual for the state, ihen
you are done for."

ents and publishers for refer-
ence. Ultimately it may beco-
me the most important and

The first step is the prepara-
tion of comprehensive catalogues

periods of art. By this it is hoped
to encourage reproductions of the
highest quality and to increase
their availability to educational

the world.
As the number of great works
Of art is limited and because of
the impossibility of transporting
the world's art treasures from
country to country, city to city
and town to town to enable them
to be seen by people everywhere,
It is believed that the circulation
of first-class reproductions is the
only means'of familiarizing the
great majority of people with the
World's art heritage.
Three Phases of part
The vast scope of the scheme
; concerning the preparation and
publication of catalogues makes
It necessary to assemble the
material by sections. After con-
aultation with experts of the
International Council of Museums
it was decided to concentrate
during 1948 mainly on three par-
ticular phases of art : Modern
painting from 1860 to the pres-
ent ; Italian Renaissance painting ;
Persian art.
Approximately 200 publishers
and makers of colour reproduc-
tions throughout the world have
already been approached with a
request to furnish Unesco with
the information necessary to
draw up complete and detailed
vista in these three categories.
To date more than 500 samples
Of colour reproductions have been
received for inclusion in the
Unesco archives, and more than
'1, 000 detailed entries selected and
Þ1ade in the draft catalogue.
This work has been carried
on with the co-operation of
ICOM experts, and further va-
luable assistance was obtained
from them when a representative
group met in Unesco House on
iuly 7 and 8.
It is anticipated that the cata-
logues covering the first two
groups will be published before
the close of the year and another
covering Persian Art will be
available early in 1949.
In 1949 the publication will
be undertaken of catalogues

chosen for 1948.

### 73845: Education in colonies poses UNESCO problem

Education in Colonies
Poses Unesco Problem
NON-SELF-GOVERNING Terri-tories (NSGTs) is the offi-
cial designation which, in the
Charter of the United Nations, is
given to the dependent territories
usually known as colonies. Al-
though all colonies are NCGTs,
those former German and Jap-
anese colonies, called mandated
territories after the first World
War, and now administered by
different powers under the
Trusteeship System, are called
Trust Territories.
According to Chapters XI and
XII of the Charter of the United
Nations, the Administering Pow-
ers of NSGTs and Trust Terri-
tories"recoRnize the principle
that the interests of the inhabi-
tants of these territories are
paramount", and undertake,
among other things,"to promote
to the utmost... the well-being of
the inhabitants of these terri-
tories, to develoD self-govern-
ment", and"to encourage re-
search".
Although most of the NSGTs
problems are common to other
under-developed territories or
even to the whole world, there
is no doubt that political disabi-
lity resultant from economic sub-
ordination and cultural infer-
iority gives a special character to
the former. This is SO much so
that one of the major sections of
the United Naticns Secretariat is
the Department of Trusteeship
and Information NSGTs. But,
because most NSGTs are among
the less developed areas of the
world, they are of special interest
to Unesco, for education, science
and cultural develooment is in-
dispensable to their. wen-being
and progress towards self-govern-
ment.
History shows that it was not
by peaceful means that most of
the colonial territories which in
the past became independent
countries reached self-government.
But there are instances in which
the metropolitain country, recog-
sizing. the cultural advancement.
social progress and economic de-
velopment of a Colony, has given
It self-government. Such is the
case of the British Dominions
and some other overseas terri-
tories. This should be the rule,
and if it has not always been so,
there is no reason why in the
future the evolution towards self-
government should not always be
peaceful and in mutual agree-
ment.
Now, the peoples of NSGTs will
never be capable of the self-
government which the adminis-
tering powers themselves under-
took to promote, if their edu-
cation and culture does not reach
a proper level. As''Uneseo's role
is to help implement the princi-
ples of the United Nations in the
fields of education, science and'
culture", it is obvious that it can
powerfully contribute to the solu-
tion of the major problem of
NSGTs. This is a case in which
Unesco can help to solve a dell-
cate and difficult political prob-
lem which on no small scale af-
feces international understanding.
The Trusteeship Council
(Chapter XII of the Charter),
the Special Committee on Infor-
mation under Article 73 e (Chap-
ter XI) of the Charter, and the
Department of Trusteeship and
Information from NSGTs, are the
United Nations'organs which are
concerned with NSGTs. The im-
portance of collaboration,. with
these organs has been recognized
in the Agreement between Unesco
and the United Nations, Articles
IX and X of which establish that
the former will assist and co-
operate with the latter to the
greatest extent poosible"with
regard to matters affecting the
well-being and development of
the peoples of NSGTs".
Therefore, Unesco has been
represented at the meetings of the
Trusteeship Council and the
Special Committee on NSGTs,
and close liaison has been es-
blished with the Department of
Trusteeship and NSGTs. At the
aame time, a Resolution adopted
by the Second General Confer-
ence recommended that"due at-
tention should be paid to promot-
ing, through the appropriate
channels, the objectives and pro-
gramme of Unesco in Trust and
Non-Self-Governing Territories".
It is in the all-important field
01 Fundamental Education that
Unesco's action in NSGTs has, so
for, been more noticeable. The
Pilot Project in Nyasaland and
the participation in the Tangan-
yika Agricultural Development
Scheme are the first steps in
Unesco's Fundamental Education
work in NSGTs.
The experience thus gained and
the development of the Clearing
House on Problems of Funda-
mental Education will be of im-
By
Armando CORTESAO,
Head Non-Self-Governing
Territories Division, Bureau
oj External Relations,
portance to NSGTs in general.
In addition to such questions as
technical education ad voca-
tional training, which may be
included in Fundamental Educa-
tion, the problem of higher educa-
tion is of primary importance for
dependent territories the develop-
ment of which aims at self-gov-
ernment.
The colonial problem being
essentially one of cultural change,
the question of Anthropology
ethnology, sociology and cul-
tures has been kept well in mind.
Thus, the International African
Institute kvas invited to present,
and has already presented, a
report concerning pla7s for
research to be undertaken on the
native cultures of Africa in order
to further the purpose of Unesco.
At the same time, fostered by
Unesco, the International Con-
gress of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences created last
August an International Union
of Anthropology and Ethnology
. which, in collaboration with
Unesco, may undertake imports : lot
work in NSGTs.
Many other Unesco activities.
such as those of the Field Science
Cooperation Offices, Mass Com-
munication (Press, Film and Ra-
dio), Museums, Libraries, Interna-
tional Clearing House for Public-
tions and for Arts and Letters,
and Relations between Cultures,
have a great interest for NSGTs.
Both the Trusteeship Council
and the Special Committee on
NSGTs have already asked for
assistance from and close collab-
oration : with Unesco. It is likely
that Unesco's next General Con-
ference will take these requests
into consideration, and that,
within its possibilities of budget
and person : 1el, Increasing atren-
tion will be paid to NSGTs.
The discussion of NSGTs prob-
lems during the meetings of
several organs of the United Na-
tions has shown only too well
that much International misun-
derstanding and distrust exists
in this field, with serious political
implications. Though the role of
Unesco is not to solve political
problems immediately, it can, in
this case as in many others, help
considerable towards their settle-
ment.

(Continued from Page 1.)
The Congress, under the chair-
manship of Dr. John R. Rees, war-
time psychiatrist-in-chief of. the
British Army. heard a broad
range of recommendations of
ways whereby specialists in men-
tal health could contribute
towards building a One World
outlook among all peoples.
Dr. Oarl Binger, Associate Pro-
fessor of Clinical Psychiatry at
oernell University, keynoted the
gravity of the discussions when
he urged"unle. : ; s war is prevent-
ed, there will not be any world
to be citizens in...
"We must... persuade states-
men and politicians to give us a
hearing and to act on our find-
ings. They would not think of
trying to wage wars without the
help of scientists-physical, me-
dical and even, now, social and
psychological-but they manage
to get into wars which these
same scientists might enable them
to prevent.
"We must abandon the role of
isolated esoterics. We must speak
a language that others can undec-
stand. If we do, they will hear
us. We must join them in all
humility and dedicate ourselves
to the needs of mankind, with
respect and reverence for the
rights of common men and
women, for to-day only a citizen
of the world can be a true
scientist."
The statement prepared by the
International Preparatory Com-
mission and adopted by the con-
gress may be summarized as
follows :
Perhaps the most important
contribution of the soeial sciences
in their joint approach to the
urgent problems facing mankind
is the recognition of the plasticity
of human behaviour and social
institutions and of the resistance
of each to change. Principles of
mental health cannot be success-
fully furthered in any society un-
less there is progressive accep-
tance of the concept of world citi-
zenship. World citizenship can be
widely extended among all peo-
ples through the applications of
the principles of mental health.
The concept of world citizenship
implies loyalty to the whole of
mankind.
Programmes for social change
to be effective require the joint
efforts of psychiatrists and social
scientists working in co-operation
with statesmen, administrators
and others in positions of respon-
sibility.
The statement also includes an
outline of acceptable principles,
practices and professional ethics
for those working in the field of
mental health and human rela-
tions, and closes with recom-
mendations addressed tø the
United Nations, Unesco, WHO, to
the newly formed World Fedora-
tion for Mental Health, to other
non-governmental international
organizations and to national and
local organizations concerned
with the betterment of mental
health and human relations.
steps are to be taken, it is ex-
pected, to co-ordinate the acti-
vities of Unesco and WHO with

cipated that this body will serve
as a consultative group for Unesco
on. all problems affecting mental
health.

the war, but the writer believ-
es it must run into the tens
of millions.
"It is worth noting that
while the number of such
unfortunate t : children is enor-
mous, the number of those
privileged to receive such as-
sistance and education has
been comparatively small. The
latter could be counted by
hundreds of thousands at
most. The great majority of
war-handicapped children
who lived through those long
years of struggle received no
attention from any kind of
educational institution at all.
"Most of the orphanages
were very poorly equipped,
both materially and spiritu-
ally... the housing situation
was desperate... clothing and
food were scarce... there were
no reference books or text-
books ; even paper was hard to
find... but the most serious
lack was in the proper kind
of teachers.
"A few far-sighted non-go-
vernmental organizations be-
gan to do something to help
these children as soon as the
war started. Among them may
be mentioned the National
Child Welfare Association, of
China... the National Associa-
tion for Refugee Children...
the China Wartime Child Re-
lief Association...
"It has been a privilege to
hear the lectures and discus-
sions (at the Children'., Vil-
lage Conference) by specialists
on different phases of prob-
lems in connection with the
educating of such children. It
seems to me that although
they are different in race and
colour, they are handicapped
by the same war and their
problems are more or less the
same all over the world.
"The problems it seems to
me most urgently in need of
solution are these : education-
art and vocational guidance
for older children, nutrition
for younger as well as for
older children, and last, but
not least, the restoring of
love and sympathy in the
hearts of all these children
so they may lead a normal
and useful life, and contri-
bute their part towards the
future peace of the world."

### 73847: Brazil sets up Folklore Institute

Brazil ! ! Sets Up
.
Folklore Institute
BRAZIL is a vast nation rich in folklore traditions, popular legends, folktales, folkpoetry and folk music. In recent generations, much research work has been carried
out on Brazilian folklore by foreign and native specialists. Until now, however, these
studies have remained to a large extent scattered throughout Brazil and different ports of
the world.
With a view to developing further study and research in folklore within, the country
and to strengthen links between Brazilian folklorists and those in other lands, the Brizilian
National Commission for Unesco (IBECC) has recently set up a National Folklore Com-
omission, with headquarters in Rio de Janeiro.
One of the most important aspects in the Commission's programme will toe the
development of a system of exchange of information and works on folklore between the
various parts of Brazil as well as between this South American nation and other countries.
A special committee has been appointed to see to the speedy execution of this scheme.
The Commission will also prepare a Bibliographical Bulletin, and special documents
on Brazilian folklore, draw up a complete list of national folklore experts, encourage the
reprinting of classical worKS III
the subject with added notes and
commentaries, and make efforts
to bring about a standardized
terminology in Brazilian folklore.
By organizing folklore courses,
lectures and festival, the Com-
mission houses to stimulate in-
terest both abroad and in Brazil.
Prominent figures in the fields
of folklore, anthropology and so-
ciology and many Brazilian au-
thorns and artists are members of
the organization. Its members
represent official institutions such
as the University of Brazil, Na-
tional and Historical Museums,
the Conservatoire, the National
Educational Film Bureau, the
Service for the Protection of the
Indians. Many private associa-
tions have also joined the Com-
mission and include the Brazilian
Society of Anthropology and
Ethnography and the Folklore
Research Centre of the National
School of Music.
Dr. Levi Carneiro, President of
IBECC, is head of the Commis-
sion and Renato Almeida, noted
folklorist, is secretary-general.
Correspondents have already
been appointed in Portugal. Great
Britain, Italy, France and Mexico.
The-establishment of the
Brazilian Folklore Commission
marks an important stage in the
carrying out of a vast programme
of international cultural co-
operation which will undoubtedly
increase in importance as its work
develops and becomes more *wide-
ly known throughout the world.

### 73848: Is Amazon legend just a myth?

The name alone shows how
Greek mythology was carried to
the New World. It was borne to
the banks of the Maranon by
Orellana's men, the first to
follow the river downstream
from the Colombian Cordillera..
The legend runs that there
was a battle on the banks of the
Nhamunda between the Span-
iards and a band of women
warriors. After long enquiries to
trace the Amazons glimpsed in
that nightmare skirmish, the
captain's men came on the cycle
of Amazon legends born of the
myth of Jurupary, the son of the
Sun. It was said he expelled
from his kingdom in the High
Sierra certain rebel women who
had revolted, not only against
the men, but against the king-
dom's laws.
These women were supposed to
have lived a nomadic life and
finally to have settled near the
! Nhamunda on the shores of the
lake known as the Mirror of the
Moon. There they used to dive
for muirakitans, talismans form-
ed on the greenish clay at the
bottom of the lake.
But when all is said and done,
it may well be that the Greek
myth of the Amazons is the ori-
kin of the story of the Ikamia-
bas. When the pioneers set out
in search of the fierce women
who met Orellana's men in
battle, they had to learn a
smattering of the local tongue to
make contact with the people.
Hence, in all probability, the
coming of the name"Ikamia-
bas,"the manless, or alterna-
tively the lawless, women, the
latter meaning being connected
with the legend of Jurupary.
In any case, even if the In-
dian tribes in the Amazon Basin
were originally matriarchal, it is
not there that we must look for
the origin of the Ikamiabas
myth. More probably the legend
of the Amazons was brought to
the Indians by the people who
came from the"Brave New
World,"thirsting for wealth and
adventure.

. Book. Coupon Scheme
(Continued from Page 2.)
Prom the point of view of gov-
ernments of participating count-
ries, it should be emphasized
that the Book Coupon Scheme
will not take the book trade out
of the general line of foreign
exchange control since the
governments concerned will be
left with the requisite powers
of control insofar as selection of
distributing agency, booksellers
authorized to accept book cou-
pons and total amounts of book
coupons are concerned.
The scheme will nevertheless
considerably reduce the number
of bureaucratic impediments
which very often make it dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to make
payments abroad-particularly
whexe small sums are involved.
Although in principle the book
coupons are intended to serve
the needs of both institutions and
individuals, the distributing
agency may. during the experi-
mental period when only a very
limited amount of book coupons
can be put at the disposal of
each participating country, have
to make the allocation of book
coupons on a priority basis. Thus
the needs of educational, scien-
tific and cultural institutions
serving a multitude of people
can receive first consideration.

### 73834: Book Coupon Scheme experiment under way

It is expected that during the
experimental period the. following
countries will participate either
as purchasers of book coupons
or as suppliers of books : China,
Czechoslovakia, France, India.
U. K. and U. S. A. In addition, a
certain number of book coupons
will be distributed free in the
following countries : Austria, Chi-
na, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hun-
gary, Italy, the Philippines and
Poland. The money for this free
distribution will be provided by
Unesco's 1948 funds for educa-
tional reconstruction. Thus a
considerable number of Member
States will, in one form'or
another, participate in the plan
and be able to decide on
the merits or disadvantages of
the project and determine whe-
ther it should be continued on a
permanent basis.
It should be pointed out, finally.
that during the experimental
period, Unesco will accept pay-
ment from the distribution agen-
cies for the book coupons in one
of the three Unesco currencies,
i. e. French francs or pounds
sterling or U. S. dollars.
The way the Book Coupon
scheme will work may be sum-
marized, therefore, i five prin-
cipal steps :
 Unesco issues Book Coupon to
national distributing agency.
No payment made.
. National distributing agency
sells coupons to individual
or institution for local cur-
rency.
. National distributing agency
transfers equivalent of local
currency to Unesco in either
francs, sterling or dollars.
. Individual purchaser of cou-
pOns uses them as a cheque
to pay for books bought
abroad.
. Bookseller receiving coupons
presents them to Unesco and
is paid in his national cur-
rtency, minus discount to
Unesco for upkeep of scheme.

the continent either directly or
through other Specialized Agen-
cies of the United Nations.
The Latin American Scientific
Conference stems from a resolu-
tion adopted last year at the Se-
cond Session of the Uneseo Gene-
ral Conference in Mexico City
which recognized the need for
developing scientific institutions
in Latin America and stimulating
the interchange of information
between this area and the refit
of the world.
Obstacles to Progress
"The difficulties faced by Latin
American men of science at the
present time because of the lack
of equipment and information",
Dr Carneiro has pointed out.
"are a serious obstacle to scien
tific advancement in our count-
ries. The Unesco Scientific Con-
ference in Uruguay may well be
the turning point for Latin Ame-
rican scientists".
Scheduled to be held from
September 6 to 10, the conference
will study positive means to
broaden scientific studies through
university scholarships and post-
graduate research work, the organ-
i : : action of scientific"symposia"
and closer co-operation with
international scientific bodies.
Delegates will also examine spew
cific problems facing Latin Ame-
rican scientists in the different
branches of their work, co-ope-
ration between specialized labor-
atories such as marine biology,
astronomy, etc., and ways by
which Unesco can aid in thes «
fields.
The work of Unesco's Field
Science-Co-operation Office estab-
lished in Latin America will be
discussed with emphasis on
liaison methods, the radius of
the FSCO'S influence, relations
with the Hylean Amazon Insti-
tute and suggestions regarding
the office's future activities.
Delegations are submitting a
report on the scientific develop-
ment of their respective countries
which are to serve as a basis
for the discussions during the
conference. Spanish and Portu-
guese will be the working lang-
uages.
Unesco has extended invita-
tions to FAO, WHO, ILO, the
International Meteorological Of-
fice, the International Civil Avia-
tion Organization, Rockefeller
Institute, Carnegie Institute, Pan-
American Union, Inter-American
Institute of Agricultural Science
and the Smithsonian Institute to
send observers to the conference.
