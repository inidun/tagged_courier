The legendary patience of Russia’s
m i n e rs came to an end last Ja n u a ry
when they suddenly revolted at
Ku z n e t s k aya and nearby places in the pine-
forests of the Siberian taiga. For five day s ,
in the half-light of the winter, the manager
of the local coal mine was held hostage by
a group of miners dri ven to desperat i o n .
Helped by their wives and children, t h e y
kept him prisoner in his office by
b a rricading the door with tables and
c h a i rs. They had not been paid for three
ye a rs , they said. They had no ru n n i n g
wat e r , no telephones.Their children could
no longer go to school, which was fif t e e n
kilometres away.
Their remote village, l o c ated in the
Kuzbass region, the heart of Russia’s coal
i n d u s t ry, is a Soviet-style mining settlement
like many others in the country ’s coalfie l d s.
The privileged status that all manual
workers, especially miners, enjoyed in the
Soviet Union was in fact only relative and
partial.They may have been paid twice as
much as teachers or doctors but they were
often housed in insanitary wooden shacks,
usually consisting of a single room and a
tiny kitchen.
These hovels are still there, r ows of
them along muddy tracks which are either
frozen or dusty according to the season.

### 114139: Russia's angry miners
Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have been sacked
over the past seven years and the other half are
struggling to make ends meet because they are
being paid months, even years late. Their anger
exploded last January
‘Kidnapping the mine
manager in January got us
nowhere. We’re the real
hostages here, the miners
and their families’
They date back to the time of the gulags,
when mines were dug by pri s o n e rs in
remote Arctic regions without any regard
for profit a b i l i t y.When the market economy
a rri ve d , keeping them going became a
tricky afair.
Many miners still live in such barrack
blocks because almost no new low - c o s t
housing has been built since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.But the end of the old
S oviet empire has had plenty of other
c o n s e q u e n c e s. In Siberi a , safety conditions
in the mines quickly deteri o r ated as
equipment wore out.The huge expanses of
cheap housing which began to replace the
old mining villages in the 1950s are no
longer maintained.

But in Siberia, kitchen gardens cannot

pittance of a pension they still receive on a
more regular basis. But this is not enough,
and so families go into debt.This situation
is widespread in Russia. It affects not only

The miners also survive by stealing, by

Unpalatable options
In 1996, the World Bank made an initial loan of $500 million for the reconversion of Russia’s coal mines,
which were considered uneconomic. Some of this money was hijacked by real or bogus middlemen.B e f o r e
making a second loan of $800 million, the bank is demanding that half the 200 mines still operating be shut
down and that all state subsidies be abolished by the year 2000.The subsidies are used to pay around 17%
of the miners’ wages, the rest coming from the mining companies, which have been partly privatized since
last year.
R e t raining the dismissed miners is very difficult. In the Tula Basin, for example, only 1,700 of the
20,000 miners dismissed there a few years ago have found new jobs. Russian coal production has slumped,
from 400 million tonnes in 1980 to 240 million tonnes in 1997. n
take no more of this. They were tired of
l i ving off their wits,while the mine manager
was living high off the hog. He had moved to
a new area outside the village, w h e r e
mansions have been built behind high wa l l s.
In the We s t , mine closures in the past
few decades have been isolated dramas,
resisted by groups of wo r k e rs. In Russia,
such closures are happening at a time when
the country itself is breaking up and
p l u n ging into a crisis whose outcome is
u n c e rt a i n .The first seven ye a rs of transition
from communism to capitalism have ended
in fa i l u r e . The fate of the miners is no
longer a major factor in the tragedy being
e x p e rienced by the vast majority of people,
including the middle class which was just
s t a rting to emerge, and the intellectuals,
who are having a hard time playing their
role as observe rs and chroniclers of this
tormented society.
Half of Russia’s 900,000 miners have
been sacked since 1991. Only very few of
them have managed to find other wo r k .
More dismissals are expected during the
next few months,along with the sacking of
other wo r k e rs traditionally less we l l -
organized,in Russia as elsewhere,than the
m i n e rs. But most Russian trade unions
h ave been discredited by their past
c o l l a b o r ation either with the communist
authorities,or with the present regime.So
they cannot mobilize large numbers of
people to support the miners, workers and
o t h e rs who continue to toil without pay for
months or even years.
In Ku z n e t s k aya ,M a ria Pe t r ovna is bitter.
“Kidnapping the mine manager in Ja n u a ry
got us now h e r e .We ’re the real hostages here,
the miners and their fa m i l i e s.We ’ ve got too
m a ny thieves and scoundrels.”
All the miners in Russia have come to
the same conclusion, whether they live in
the Kuzbass regi o n , in the Far East, i n
R o s t ov-on-Don or in Vo r k u t a , a b ove the
Arctic Circle. E ve ry w h e r e , each day is
pretty much like living in hell. n

November 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 9
n
UN E S C O's activities are based on the conviction that it is possible to influence the
c o u rse of world events and that tomorr ow ’s world is being constructed today. And the
structure will be all the more solid if it rests on clear ethical principles and a sharp
awareness of the gap between what exists and what should exist.
The future of humankind is threatened by real dangers. In too many parts of the
wo r l d , human dignity is still being abused by war and by exclusion of the most vulnerable
and needy. Inequality and poverty are growing.The walls of urban segregation are rising.
The education of women is being forgotten.And people’s violence towards each other is
matched by the violence they inflict on nature,thereby jeopardizing their own future.
Lack of foresight and the race for quick profit have led to intensive exploitation of
natural resources, ecological disasters, ever more serious problems of water supply and
desertification as well as pollution of every kind.Who can say for sure if scientific and
technological progress will bring more solutions than new perils?
The rapid gr owth of biotechnology and the possibilities of human genetic engi n e e ri n g
are even leading people to reconsider the ve ry definition of what constitutes a human
b e i n g .We risk being enslaved by our own inventions and becoming pri s o n e rs in a maze of
our own creation unless we are very vigilant and take a clear ethical stand.
We should all be concerned about what lies ahead.The future must not be left to the
r avages of blind and cynical forces. Ethical deficits seem to me to be more serious in the long
t e rm than budget defic i t s.The ethics of the future is sustained by the belief that there is no
contradiction between solidarity with the present generation and solidarity with future
g e n e r at i o n s.Both embody the same rejection of exclusion and injustice, the same reminder
of the bond that unites all people on eart h .This ethics does not make vain prescriptions for
a future which never arri ve s. It starts here and now, with care for others and the
d e t e rm i n ation to pass on to future generations a heritage which is not irr e t ri e vably damaged.
One sometimes hears it said that “the future is too complicated and too uncertain,so
let’s make the best of the present”.My answer is that it is too easy to wait for problems to
a rise before tackling them and to take action only in emergencies. Such short - s i g h t e d
reasoning leaves only the choice of yielding or adapting to eve n t s. If we are not to be at their
m e r cy, if we are to regain control of our own future, if we are to escape routine and
obsolescence, we must start thinking again in the long term by looking as far ahead as
possible and anticipating developments.
Only by adopting this kind of pers p e c t i ve can we counter uncertainty about the future and
c r e ate room for action now.And it is action we need.A n t i c i p ating means fighting apat hy and
i n d i f f e r e n c e , awakening people’s consciences,opening their eyes to tomorr ow ’s dangers and
r e a d j u s t i n g, if need be, t o d ay ’s decisions. Foresight is the basis of effective action.
Foresight calls for two qualities: comprehension and imagi n at i o n . C o m p r e h e n s i o n
because the future does not come out of the blue. It leads back to earlier states of awa r e n e s s ,
to rules or an absence of rules whose reasons must be unders t o o d .The effort of linking the
present and the future in this way will unite the world and turn it into a whole,producing
the overall grasp which is precisely the meaning of the verb “to comprehend.”This effort
would remain an abstract one if it was not enriched and illuminated by imagi n at i o n .
Thinking about the twe n t y - first century means dreaming, c o n j u ring up models which
are perhaps contradictory, i m a gining new worlds and utopias. A l l owing ours e l ves to
u n d e rstand reality and to imagine the possible, to achieve the possible and to attempt the
impossible. n

The fate of the unparalleled concentration of nuclear material on Russia’s
Kola peninsula is alarming neighbouring Scandinavian countries
n
The strike only lasted an hour, but it wa s
enough to set alarm bells ri n ging in
M o s c ow. Organized by Russia’s nuclear
defence wo r k e rs in September this ye a r , i t
caused such concern in Moscow that despite
the severe financial crisis the gove rn m e n t
allotted about $16 million for the defence
e m p l oyees who had not been paid for
m o n t h s.E ven the latest deal gave the wo r k e rs
only half of the wages owed to them by the
g ove rn m e n t .‘‘ People are really hungry. H ow
can you ask them to look after our securi t y ? ’’
said Yu ry Bers e nye v, a scientist from the
closed nuclear city Snezhinsk, in an interv i e w
to a local daily.
Corroding equipment
and dissatisfied servicemen
The Russian Union of Nuclear Industry
Wo r k e rs says that hungry nuclear wo r k e rs
and lack of funding could lead to seri o u s
trouble in the Russian nuclear sector,
including defence establishments.In addition
to corroding submari n e s ,d i s s at i s fied military
p e rsonnel now add more complications for
the Russian authori t i e s. In September this
year a disgruntled armed conscript killed
eight of his fellow servicemen and threat e n e d
to blow up the Akula-class submarine at the
Skalisty naval base in the Kola peninsula.
Finally he killed himself in the torp e d o
c o m p a rt m e n t . Though Russian officials
assured that the sailor could not have
damaged the torp e d o e s ,a ny explosion in the
c o m p a rtment was strong enough to damage
the submari n e ’s single nuclear reactor.T h i s
incident alarmed Norwe gian officials, as it
happened just 120 km from the border in the
c o u n t ry ’s nort h .The unstable situation in the
Russian nuclear sector has aggr avated the
wo rries of the neighbouring Scandinav i a n
n ations who will be the first to be affected in
case of a nuclear disaster in Russia’s nort h -
we s t .
The gr avest environmental hazard in the
Arctic Circle stems from  nuclear activity on
the Russian side,especially in and around the
n o rt h e rn Kola peninsula. N owhere else on
e a rth is there such a concentration of civilian
and naval nuclear reactors.According to the
Ya b l o k ov report1, an official Russian
d o c u m e n t , there were a total of 270 nuclear
r e a c t o rs in Murmansk and A r k h a n g e l s k
counties in 1990. Nuclear activity in and
around the Kola peninsula includes powe r
p l a n t s , nuclear submari n e s , huge piles of
nuclear waste and the effects of nuclear tests
conducted by the former Soviet Union.
Russia’s immediate neighbour Finland
is the only European Union country to
share a 1,200-kilometre border with Russia
and faces constant environmental threat s
from the former superp owe r. F i n l a n d ’s
Arctic Circle would be the first and worst
hit region in the event of a Russian
environmental disaster.With memories of
C h e rnobyl still haunting them, the Finns
are constantly monitoring air, water, soil,
plants and meat to make sure nothing is
amiss on the Russian side.
Despite the presence of so many old-
fashioned nuclear reactors and unprotected
piles of nuclear waste so close to the border,
K ristina Rissanen, head of the Regi o n a l
L a b o r at o ry of the Finnish Centre for
Radiation and Nuclear Safety (CRNS),in
R ova n i e m i , t ries to keep a sense of
p e rs p e c t i ve . ‘‘The radiation levels across
the border at present are not alarm i n g .
M o r e over the Russians in recent ye a rs have
s t a rted showing a more open approach, a n d
that itself is a positive factor.’’
R i s s a n e n ’s laborat o ry, eighteen metres
u n d e r gr o u n d , is designed to withstand a
nuclear holocaust.The enthusiastic team of
chemists in CRNS analyse hundreds of
samples eve ry day, from reindeer meat to
i n d u s t rial products. K ristina makes frequent
t rips to nort h we s t e rn Russia on joint
expeditions to find out the fate of submerged
nuclear reactors and the operat i o n a l
r e a c t o rs.
The Ya b l o k ov report noted that only 15
per cent of the dry-docked submarines had
been properly decommissioned by the
r e m oval of reactor fuels and the reactor
s e c t i o n . A state of the Arctic Env i r o n m e n t
Report2 says that along with nuclear waste,
the Soviet Union dumped six nuclear
s u b m a rine reactors and a shielding
assembly from an icebreaker reactor,
containing spent fuel, b e t ween the ye a rs
1959 and 1991.
Expeditions
in the Barents Sea
R i s s a n e n , whose team often searches
the Barents Sea for the nuclear reactors
from sunken Russian nuclear submarines,
takes a different view. ‘‘There is no doubt
m a ny of the submerged reactors could pose
a serious threat to the environment of the
Arctic region in the future. I am more
wo rried about the Kola nuclear power plant
than those reactors lying under the sea.T h e
nuclear reactors in Kola are very old and
similar to Chernobyl-type reactors.’’

We s t e rn nuclear experts who have

the Russian Fe d e r ation today still do not
meet modern standards. To complicat e
matters,the enterprises are subordinate to
m a ny different authori t i e s , federal and

complex.The amount of waste and spent
fuel greatly exceeds the capacity of storage
and reprocessing.Most importantly, there
is no money to fully maintain, restore or
replace equipment and facilities for

Despite pressure from Scandinav i a n
and other European countries it is not
realistic to expect the Russians to wholly
abandon their nuclear energy projects,
which are badly required for the powe r -
s t a rved nort h west region of the country.
Irrespective of advances in other forms of
e l e c t ricity generat i o n , Russia will probably
continue to use and develop nuclear
technology because of its huge
i n f r a s t ructure and enormous manpowe r.
R u s s i a , in this regard, needs help from
Western countries to find a solution to the

Though Norway has taken the lead in
co-operating with the Russians in working

blocks rapid progress in co-operat i o n .

‘‘Though the Norwegian side is willing

The floods that ravaged the Chang
Jiang (Ya n g t z e - K i a n g, literally the
“Long River”) basin this year were the
most serious since 1954, and flooding in
n o rtheast China was the wo rst in recorded
h i s t o ry.
H owe ve r , compared to the situation in
1 9 5 4 , the volume of water in this ye a r ’s
Yangtze flooding “ was not ve ry gr e at ” ,
s ays Lu Qinkan, a former official in
C h i n a ’s Ministry of Water Resources who
has been monitoring the ri ver since the
1 9 4 0 s. And yet the damage is more
s e ri o u s. A t m o s p h e ric physicist Ta o
S h i ya n , a member of the Chinese
A c a d e my of Sciences, concludes that
u n favourable we ather conditions “ we r e
not fully responsible” for a disaster which,
according to official sources, c l a i m e d
more than 3,000 lives between June and
August this ye a r , affected 223 million
p e rsons and almost a quarter of the
c o u n t ry ’s arable land, d e s t r oyed nearly
five million dwe l l i n g s , and caused damage
costing 166 billion yuan (around $21
b i l l i o n ) .
A hefty price tag
for neglect
How could such catastrophic flooding
have occurred? Lu attributes the problem
to the ri ve r ’s inability to release its
flo o d water efficiently. “The key factor in
controlling the Ya n g t z e ’s floods is ove r a l l
planning for storage and above all for
discharge of flo o d wat e rs ,” he say s. “ L a i d
d own in the 1950s, it remains a good
p rinciple today. U n f o rt u n ately the balance
has always been skewed in favour of storage
behind dams.” Now many sections of the
dikes and embankments which total 3,570
km in length along the lower and middle
reaches of the Yangtze and “are essential to
enchance the river’s capacity to discharge
flo o d wat e r ” are badly in need of repair.T h i s
s u m m e r , s e e p a g e , c r a c k s , and collapses
occurred at thousands of points, showing
that the dikes were weak.
G i ven the length and width of the
Ya n g t z e , Lu explains, if the height of the
dikes was raised by an average of one metre,

### 114142: The River's revenge
The river’s
Heavy rainfall led to this year’s flooding in
China, but years of human error turned it into
a national catastrophe
an additional 7,500 cubic metres of water
could be discharged per second (20 billion
cubic metres per month). However, a ten-
year plan drawn up in 1980 to heighten and
reinforce the Ya n g t z e ’s dikes has never been
fully carried out, Lu adds. If it had, “ t h i s
ye a r ’s disaster would have been
considerably alleviated.”
The water authorities explain that the
delay is due to shortage of funds.Whereas
4.8 billion yuan ($1.6 billion at the then
rate) were needed to finance 34 projects in
1 9 8 0 , only 399 million yuan had been
i nvested by 1987, and only 12 projects had
been launched. One exception is Jiangxi
p r ov i n c e , the final stage of the ri ve r ’s cours e
before it enters the East China Sea.
A u t h o rities there have spent around 7
billion yuan on flood defence work since
the early 1990s,about one seventh of it on
dikes along the Yangtze.
But the price of neglect elsewhere has
been high. Damage caused by Ya n g t z e
flooding in 1995, 1996 and this year has
cost at least 200 billion yuan ($25 billion).
This sum represents nearly 40 times the
budget for the 1980 plan and amounts to
two-thirds of the total investment needed
for the controve rsial Three Gorges Dam
p r o j e c t . M a ny engi n e e rs believe that this
d a m , when completed, could help tame the
Yangtze flo o d s , but others , including Lu,
are sceptical. As an adviser to the expert
panel on flood control during the feasibility
study carried out in the 1980s, he maintains
that the dam’s flood control capacity “will
only be limited”.
L o c ated near Y i c h a n g, where the
Yangtze emerges from narr ow gorges
before entering its flatter middle reaches,
the dam may help to control upstream
flo o d s. But this ye a r ’s deadly floods we r e
d ow n s t r e a m ,p a rticularly in Jiangxi, H u n a n
and Hubei provinces.
With a total storage capacity of 39.3
billion cubic metres, the Three Gorges
R e s e rvoir will have a flood control capacity
of 22.2 billion cubic metres, Lu say s , a
figure “ t h at is far exceeded by the ri ve r ’s
gross flood vo l u m e .” He maintains that the
Three Gorges Dam attracts massive 
i nvestment at the expense of basic local
flood defence wo r k . Lu Ya o ru , a

Two cheers for
industry
European industry’s contribution to climate
change by producing acid ra i n , eating away at
the ozone layer and polluting water has decreased
since 1995,according to a recent survey carried
out by the European Environment Agency (EEA).
“In Western Europe,environmental objectives are
becoming integrated into industrial decision-
m a k i n g , resulting in falling total industrial
emissions to air and wa t e r,” a report on the survey
says.
H o w e v e r, there are two bits of bad news. F i r s t ,
this attitude is as yet “not common in Eastern
E u r o p e ” , and second, small and medium-sized
firms are far less green-oriented than bigger ones
and are reluctant to take “effective environmental
m e a s u r e s ” .
If industry could do more, the three other “ ke y
s e c t o ral driving forces” affecting Europe’s
e n v i r o n m e n t — t ra n s p o r t , energy and
agriculture—also still have some way to go.
Transport of goods by road has increased by 54
per cent since 1980 and car-borne passenger
t ransport by 46 per cent since 1985. R o a d
congestion and atmospheric and noise pollution
are getting worse. And the future looks bleak
because of the huge influence of political habit,
which encourages the growth of infrastructures
and the decline of public in favour of priva t e
transport.
In agriculture, the use of non-organic fertilizers
and pesticides has levelled off, but wa t e r
consumption continues to increase while rivers are
threatened by excessive plant growth
( e u t r o p h i c a t i o n ) . “Environmental considera t i o n s
are still only a small part” of the European Union’s
Common A g r i c u l t u ral Po l i c y, the report says.
Europe also has little to boast about when it
comes to energy consumption.This has fallen by
23 per cent in the former communist countries
since 1990 because of the economic crisis there.
But emission of pollutants is expected to rise
quickly when economic recovery takes place.
Western Europe is only increasing its energy
efficiency by about one per cent a year, while its
gross domestic product (GDP) is growing by
between 2 and 3 per cent.
It is hard to see how the European Union
countries will be able to meet their commitment
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent
by the year 2010. n

capacity to discharge flo o d wat e r.
Hundreds of
lost lakes
In fa c t , s ays Yu Xiaogan, a senior
geographer with the Chinese Academy of
S c i e n c e s , the ri ver bed in a number of
stretches has already risen by 5 to 14 metres
a b ove surrounding field levels as a result of
s e d i m e n t at i o n . “In those sections the
Yangtze has already become a hangi n g
ri ve r ,” he say s. “And that is ve ry
dangerous.”
He believes that misuse of ri ve rside land
and adjoining lakes have also aggr avat e d
the problem. As a result of populat i o n
p r e s s u r e , the surface areas of Dongting and
Boyang lakes, two of the major detention
basins for Yangtze flo o d s , h ave shrunk by
46 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in
the past forty years.Their storage capacity
has decreased from more than 30 billion to
around 17 billion cubic metres. H u b e i ,
once known as “the province of a thousand
lakes”, had 1,066 lakes in the late 1950s.
N ow there are only 182. C o n s e q u e n t l y,
floodwaters that might have been stored in
lakes are now inundating cities,towns and
fields that occupy dried out land.Whereas
the region had 100,000 inhabitants in
More than 200 million Chinese were affected by this year’s floods.
1 9 5 4 , 20,000 of whom had to move out
when danger threat e n e d , t o d ay there are
half a million, 330,000 of whom have to be
removed when the waters rise.
D e f o r e s t ation and land erosion in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze have also
a g gr avated the flo o d s. B e t ween 1977 and
1 9 9 7 , according to the Nat i o n a l
E nvironmental Protection A g e n cy, 1 4
million cubic metres of wood we r e
d e s t r oyed annually in southwest China.
B e t ween 1957 and 1997, the area scarr e d
by soil erosion in the Yangtze basin
expanded from 363,800 to 569,700 square
k i l o m e t r e s , or from 20.2 per cent to 31.5
per cent of the basin’s area. “ Falling on
thick forest, 50 mm of rainfall wo n ’t have
a ny bad effect because all of it is absorbed,”
s ays Jin Jianming, an adviser to the
N ational Environmental Protection
A g e n cy. “But on exposed gr o u n d , just 30
mm of rainfall will run off and cause
flo o d s.”
“ N at u r e ’s revenge on China’s neglect
of ecology over the years”, is Yu Xiaogan’s
verdict on this ye a r ’s flo o d s. “ We used to
consider ourselves ‘masters of nature’and
t ried to conquer it,” s ays Liu Shukun, a
hy d r o l o gist with the Ministry of Wat e r
Resources.“Now we must learn to respect
nature like a good host.” n

Efforts to provide them with vocational training, formally or 
on the job, are yielding modest but promising results
n
In a poor area of Nairobi, under a
blazing sun, fif t e e n - year-old Reuben
is making wooden stools. He and two
f e l l ow apprentices have chosen to learn
c a rp e n t ry.
“I really like this way of learning by
working,” he says,“but I’d also like to get
some training at a school so I can get a
diploma.”
When he ended his formal educat i o n
by dropping out of primary school,he had
obtained no cert i fic ate or technical
q u a l i fic ations—a common situation in a
c o u n t ry where most young people leave
school at primary level without being able
to get a job afterwards.
N e a r b y, amid the din of hammers ,
young metalwo r k e rs are busy recy c l i n g

S wa h i l i . So are the girls who are mainly
apprenticed into two trades, h a i r d r e s s i n g
and dressmaking.
Despite sat i s fa c t o ry results, M i l l i c e n t
had to break off her education duri n g
s e c o n d a ry school when her parents, w h o
had little money, decided that her brother
should be the one to be educat e d . But they
offered to send her to a Catholic missionary
school which taught girls dressmaking. S h e
did not complete the course there either,
once again for lack of money. “However I
did learn how to make simple clothes for
women and children,” she said,“ but I really
wanted to complete the training so I could
be fully qualified.”
So she went off to Nairobi and with
help from her uncle found an
apprenticeship in a dressmaking shop.
T h e r e , she worked alongside other gi r l s ,
some of whom had not been able to fin i s h
their schooling because of unwa n t e d
p r e g n a n c i e s. This problem affects nearly
10,000 Kenyan girls eve ry ye a r , r e d u c i n g

Apprenticeships

John was born in Mathare,a poor part
of Nairobi. He was brought up by a mother
who was unable to provide for the family.
When he was eight years old,he became a
“parking boy ” , or street child. A f t e r
spending three ye a rs at a community centre
which cares for such children,he returned
to wandering the streets of the capital and
was eventually arrested by the police, who
threw him in jail for a few we e k s. “ T h e y
‘I really like this way of learning by working,
but I’d also like to get some training at a school so 
I can get a diploma’

were taken in by the Undugu Society,” a
C atholic organization which looks after

craftsmen who gi ve them a technical
training paid for by the Society.“I saw kids
l e a rn to be carp e n t e rs that way, so I decided
to do that too,” said Jo h n , who was then
apprenticed to a woodworker.
“This kind of rehabilitation aims to help
young people do productive work by
placing them in a workshop run by a
craftsman respected for his ability to train
p e o p l e ,” said a teacher at the Undugu
Society. Social workers advise the children
on the choice of a trade and visit them each
week in their workshops to see how they
are getting on and to organize on a step-

Qualified 
but jobless
Despite the gove rn m e n t ’s efforts to
encourage technical educat i o n , the netwo r k
of some 2,000 public and pri vate vo c at i o n a l
training centres absorbs little more than
one per cent of the school-age population.
These institutions attract young people
with a good school record whose poorly-
e d u c ated parents have the means to pay the
fees. But the centres have serious financial
p r o b l e m s , despite the support of
development aid organizations.
Some centres, like the “ yo u t h
polytechnics”, do not always have enough
funds to equip their workshops and raise
cash from the local community and from
selling items made by the yo u n g
apprentices. All the same, the apprentices
manage to acquire some qualific at i o n s , bu t
m a ny surveys show that in spite of their
technical education only a few of them fin d
a job when they leave.Good qualifications
seem to be less important than knowing the
right person when looking for a job
commensurate with the training they have
received.
In recent ye a rs , vo c ational training
centres have been criticized because of their
high running costs, the relat i vely few places
available in them and the lack of results as
regards placing apprentices in jobs.
In view of this problem and a situation
in which more than half the country ’s
children drop out of school eve ry year after

h ave begun to reform the educat i o n a l
system (see box ) . The length of pri m a ry
schooling has been extended from seve n
ye a rs to eight and now includes some
technical education.The goal is to give the
children some practical skills so they can
m ove on to some kind of training or
professional activity in the jua kali sector.
At the same time, the government has
launched a major initiative to support and
boost the prestige of these kinds of jobs. It

Schools and
sponsors for
Cambodia’s
children
T e n - y e a r-old Chev lives in Mondulkiri province,
in the highlands of southeastern Cambodia,
and belongs to the Phnong ethnic minority. H e
and his family are a long way from the regional
capital,Sem Monorum,and for six months of the
year he cannot get to school because bad weather
makes the roads impassable.
The provincial governor has appealed for help
to the Association for Sponsoring Cambodian
Children (ASPECA), a French non-governmental
organization set up in 1991 which runs sixty
centres around the country housing more than
5,000 orphans or street children. The governor’s
request comes because of the very difficult living
conditions in this remote and sparsely-populated
region.
ASPECA does two things. It builds schools in
the countryside and has put up a reception centre
in Sem Monorum for orphans. It also arranges the
sponsoring of the very poorest children.
Chev is “looked after”by a woman living in
France who has agreed to pay for his food, h e a l t h
care, school fees and clothing for as long as he
needs. He writes regular letters to her promising
to make good use of his opportunities and to work
hard.
Most of the 4,200 sponsors are men and
women in Western Europe and Canada.ASPECA
has already built a dozen traditional wooden
houses with thatched roofs in Sem Monorum to
house the children who live furthest away from
school.
Last February, UNESCO signed a co-operation
agreement with A S P E C A . Under it, the children
have received basic school materials and schools
have been equipped with libra r i e s.The initiative is

is estimated that the sector can prov i d e
about 90,000 professional jobs for yo u n g
people each year. After receiving technical
t r a i n i n g, youths in Nairobi no longer
s y s t e m atically look for white-collar jobs
when they leave school.
Abdi is an apprentice in a garage,
l e a rning about electricity and mechanics.
“My parents are fa rm e rs in Eldoret and
they couldn’t afford to pay for me to go to
school,” he says. “So I came to Nairobi to
live with my uncle who introduced me to
the owner of this garage.” Abdi intends to
get solid qualifications so he can go on to a
polytechnic and get a diploma and then a
job “in a big garage.”
Reuben too hopes he wo n ’t always be a
jua kali, making stools: “I’m too young to
work,” he says. “After my apprenticeship, I
want to take courses at a technical school so
I can eventually set up my own carpentry
business.” He would then,in turn,take on
his own apprentices, children forced, l i k e
him,to drop out of school. n
equipped schools offer little choice of cours e s
and that the pupils are divided up according to
social ori gins and gender.The methods of the
teachers have also not changed despite the
r e f o rm s , because of their slender knowledge of
the specialist subjects.
The new educational system is presently
coming in for a lot of cri t i c i s m . T h e
complaints include the hastiness of the
r e f o rms—less than a third of the schools have
wo r k s h o p s — overloaded courses and poor
c a l c u l ation of costs, especially for fa m i l i e s
which are sometimes forced to sell seve r a l
head of cattle to pay for a child’s schooling.
The schools ask parents to supply their
children with all the mat e rials they need to
make the craft items. So education is far from
being free and equal. S t ate schools, e s p e c i a l l y
s e c o n d a ry schools, sometimes demand
r e gi s t r ation fees which are double or eve n
treble the amount set by the ministry of
e d u c at i o n . So good students from poor
families sometimes cannot sign on at the best
schools, while those from wealthier families
but with only average results can.
This double standard is the main cri t i c i s m
of the new educational system.The result is
t h at many pupils and their parents are now
waiting for a reform of the reforms. A . R.n
n The Kenyan gove rnment began an
e d u c ational reform programme in 1985
which substantially altered syllabus content
and educational stru c t u r e s , putting more
emphasis on pre-vo c ational training that
would be useful to pupils as soon as they
finished their schooling.The programme aims
to adapt the educational system to the
c o u n t ry ’s needs, reduce inequalities by
building new schools in poorer regions and,
especially, to solve the problem of those who
find themselves looking for a job without any
vocational training.
Such schooling must instil techniques and
k n owledge which will be useful for the
c o u n t ry ’s development and prepare yo u n g
people to hone their skills in vo c at i o n a l
training institutes or set themselves up as
craftspeople.
Te c h n i c a l , fa rming and artistic subjects
h ave been added to the pri m a ry school
curriculum, which was previously limited to
subjects like English, m at h e m atics and
h i s t o ry. An arts and crafts course teaches
d e s i g n , p a i n t i n g, d e c o r at i o n , p o t t e ry and
working with leat h e r , wood and metal. I t
enables those who drop out of school early to
make use of these practical skills in their
c o m m u n i t i e s , producing tables, c h a i rs ,
baskets and kitchen utensils.
For the past three ye a rs ,s u rveys have been

Immigrants
on the borderline
Mobility is a key feature of
today’s world . . . mobility of
capital, goods, images,
sounds . . . and people.
International migrations
have never taken place to
such a massive extent—on a
scale that is even higher
between countries of the
South than between South
and North. But while
numbers seem to be growing
inexorably, more and more
obstacles are being put in
place to keep them down.
And while the motives for
migration continue to be
poverty, oppression and war,
receiving countries are
offering a cooler welcome to
immigrant workers. Frontiers
are closing, police
intervention is being
stepped up. One often-heard
argument for this is that
there are fewer and fewer
jobs. The fact is, however,
that immigration gives rise
to many prejudices because
of a reflex that is as perverse
as it is ancient: fear of
change fuels a search for
scapegoats, and immigrants,
the “foreigners” on the
doorstep, are tailor-made for
this role because of their
“difference” and their
vulnerability.
Statistics on immigration quoted in
this dossier in some cases vary widely
from article to article, reflecting the
different sources used by
contributors.

M y t h s and re a l i t i e s
Demetrios G. Papademetriou*
n
The complex effects of intern ational migr at i o n
t o d ay touch the lives of more people and loom
politically and economically larger in more
c o u n t ries and more world regions than ever before.
The phenomenon’s causes, h owe ve r ,h ave remained
largely the same: economic and personal insecuri t y,
i n t o l e r a n c e , economic and political exclusion,
o p p r e s s i o n , va rious forms of chaos and cat a s t r o p h e ,
conflict and war.
Most of these conditions, h owe ve r , are typically
not sufficient to start or suddenly expand a
migr ation flow to a substantial degr e e . For that to
h a p p e n , c e rtain preconditions must already be in
p l a c e . Most notable among them are the pre-
existence of a long-term political and economic
r e l at i o n s h i p ; the presence of an anchor ethnic
community in the country of destination that can
a d vo c ate the admission of an immigrant group and
assist with its transport ation and integr at i o n ; a
loosely regulated labour market that values and
can absorb newcomers effective l y ; and an ove r a l l
philosophical opposition to the circumstances
m i grants are attempting to leave by key
constituencies in the prospective destinat i o n
country.
Moving towards
control and exclusion
These preconditions have become easier to
meet over the last two decades, and as a result
i n t e rn ational migr at i o n ’s reach is now global.
H e n c e , it is more important than ever to take stock
of its dimensions and signific a n c e , p a rt i c u l a r l y
because interest and reliance on it by the South are
intensifying while responses to it by the Nort h
(increasingly geared toward control and exclusion)
are converging more than ever before.
The unive rs a l i z ation of intern ational migr at i o n
and the realization that most forms of it are highly
likely to continue and expand require that we
understand it better than we do now.This need is
also urgent because the North is in the throes of a
fundamental intellectual reappraisal of the value of
most migr at i o n . I propose that we think of
international migration as a system,rather than as
a series of events. Doing so allows the analysis to
encompass migr ation processes regardless of the
causes and characteristics of a specific flow, o f
whether it is organized or spontaneous,
“ p e rm a n e n t ” or “ t e m p o r a ry ” , legally sanctioned
or “ i rr e g u l a r.” It also allows the analyst to move
b e yond the dichotomies that classify states as either
“ s e n d i n g ” or “ r e c e i v i n g ” , reasons for leaving as
either to improve one’s economic circumstances or
to protect oneself from pers e c u t i o n , and people
who move as either permanent settlers or
temporary residents.
A two-way system
of arrivals and departures
To d ay, most states simultaneously send and
r e c e i ve immigr a n t s. S i m i l a r l y, most people move
for complex combinations of economic, s o c i a l ,
cultural and political reasons.The ideal cat e g o ri e s
on which legal classifications of prospective
i m m i grants are based are increasingly unable to
a c c o m m o d ate this complex mix of motive s. T h e
resulting confusion makes the fit between theory
and reality tenuous and undermines popular
s u p p o rt for a country ’s entire admissions system.
F u rt h e rm o r e , “ p e rm a n e n t ” i m m i grants often
m ove to yet another destination or return to their
homes (as many as half the members of most
i m m i grant groups that came to the United Stat e s
in the first half of the twentieth century had
r e t u rned to their homes by the 1950s). F i n a l l y,
large proportions of “ t e m p o r a ry ” m i grants stay
abroad for long periods of time with or without
the authori z ation to do so, or conve rt to perm a n e n t
s t at u s.
U n d e rstanding intern ational migr ation properly
is important for another reason.The quality (and
effectiveness) of policies cannot be better than the
analysis that helps policy makers understand an

issue and supports the response. Hence, it should
be no surp rise when a poorly-conceived policy fa i l s
to “solve” the problem. And when politics enters
the mix, the prescription may be even further off the
mark.
The following example demonstrates both
points vividly. When the United States either
m i s u n d e rstands or disregards the motivations of
m a ny irregular Mexican migrants—who may prefer
to have a “sojourner”relationship to the US—and
ignores the social and economic fundamentals that
make such workers attractive to US employers,its
policy responses of tighter border controls and the
e q u i vocal prohibition of unauthorized employ m e n t
will not address effectively the complex challenge of
irregular migration from Mexico. In fact,the most
predictable consequences of such policies are as
f o l l ow s : a) that they would turn short - t e rm
migrants into long-term immigrants; b) that they
would fuel the gr owth of increasingly fraudulent
documents and organized trafficking industri e s ;
and c) that they would undermine the quality of
working conditions for a l l wo r k e rs active in the
same sectors as irregular wo r k e rs (whose
increasingly tenuous status makes them accept
virtually any conditions of work).This is precisely
what has happened.
If the scope of the issue is so broad and the
politics surrounding it so complex—a n d
deteriorating—wh at about migr at i o n ’s magnitude?
Roughly 120 million persons may live outside their
c o u n t ries of ori gi n . Most of them enter other
s t at e s , especially those in the Nort h , through highly
r e g u l ated channels. Excluding refugees, who at any
point comprise about 20 per cent of that total,
family reunific ation migrants and legal temporary
wo r k e rs are the two largest components of the total
n u m b e r.
It is important to note that total immigr at i o n
has gr own at an evo l u t i o n a ry, r ather than
r e vo l u t i o n a ry rate and that the magnitude of some
of its components (such as legal temporary
wo r k e rs) has in fact decreased over the last decade
or so.W h at has increased (way out of proport i o n
with the evidence) is the popular impression that
the North is in a state of siege by the citizens of
the South.
About three out of five intern ational immigr a n t s
are found in the Nort h .The overwhelming majori t y

of them have gotten there through legal channels or
otherwise hold legal stat u s e s. M a ny of the rest are in
the North at the implicit “ i nv i t at i o n ” of some of
the receiving societies’ most powerful sectors (such
as employers) and with at least some forbearance
from the authori t i e s. And even those in irr e g u l a r
s i t u ations tend to be among the most energetic and
motivated young persons the South has available,
that is, persons who are least likely to be a burden
to the receiving society.
All world regions now have significant numbers
of foreign-born persons in their midst, but ori gi n s
and density va ry widely both within and across
r e gi o n s. Oceania is the most “ i m m i gr a n t - d e n s e ”
r e gi o n , with about five million foreign-born pers o n s
(about one in five pers o n s.) Next in immigr a n t
density is the area in the A m e ricas occupied by
Canada and the United Stat e s , with about one
i m m i grant in nine or ten persons (including
i rr e g u l a rs ) .
Perhaps surprisingly for many Europeans, the
European Union (EU)-c u m-Switzerland now have
a foreign-born population whose size is comparable
to that of US/Canada, although the larger
population of those 16 countries makes them less
immigrant-dense as a whole—about one in eleven
or twelve persons (including irregulars,again).
Inconvenient
truths
I m m i gr ation to the remaining two world regi o n s
is overwhelmingly i n t ra- r e gi o n a l . Asia has about
one third or more of all intern ational migr a n t s.
While the most immigrant-dense part of Asia by
far is the Middle East, we s t e rn and parts of
s o u t h e rn Asia are teeming with refugees while south
and southeast Asia are heavily engaged in most
forms of international migration.
F i n a l l y, A f ri c a , with about 10 per cent of all
international migrants,may be the region with the
greatest fluctuations in the size of that population.

socially undesirable jobs. Nor is the North likely to
find the political courage either to compel its un-

s u rrender these jobs to the South. As a result, i t
might be better for the North to acknowledge that

members who are eager to use such jobs as entry
points to the Nort h ’s economies and as access

Low wages,
big transfers
Although they usually earn low wa g e s, c o l l e c t i v e l y
i m m i g rants manage to send substantial sums of money
to their countries of origin. In fact, these countries genera l l y
receive more money from their citizens working abroad
than they do in official development assistance (ODA).
Since the early 1990s, i m m i g rants have been sending
about $70 billion a year to their countries of origin by official
c h a n n e l s, according to the International Monetary Fund,
whereas official development assistance in 1996, f o r
e x a m p l e, amounted to an estimated $58 billion. If it is
calculated that each migrant helps five or six people at
h o m e, between 200 and 240 million people around the
world depend on the support of friends or family members
working abroad.
According to the Organization for Economic Co-
o p e ration and Development (OECD), i m m i g ra n t s ’
remittances represent an important source of foreign
exchange for many developing countries. In Egypt, f o r
e x a m p l e, financial transfers were the leading source of
external revenue in the 1980s, bringing in as much money
as tourism receipts and tolls paid on the Suez Canal. I n
Tu n i s i a , they now represent about five per cent of gross
domestic product,50 per cent of payments to service the
national debt and 10 per cent of the balance of payments.
In Ye m e n , official transfers from migrants amount to 150 per
cent of export revenue, while the sums sent to Haiti account
for six per cent of gross national product.
It is important to bear in mind that these calculations
are based on official transactions—money sent through
banks or post offices, as well as “ i n s t i t u t i o n a l ” t ra n s f e r s
l i ke retirement benefits sent to immigrants’ home countries
through governmental agreements. It is extremely difficult
to make an accurate assessment of amounts sent through
informal networks.
I m m i g rants also invest considerable sums on making
purchases abroad and then sending them by various means
to their countries of origin. These “exports”, ranging from
photocopy and fax machines bought to set up a business, t o
antibiotics and clothing—may equal or even surpass
financial tra n s f e r s.M i g rants often also bring back from host
countries managerial or technical skills,whose value is more
difficult to calculate,along with new perspectives on issues
like education and democracy, particularly with regard to
women’s rights and status. nYour country is

The ve ry word “ h o s t i n g ” is ambiguous when
applied to immigr a n t s , so many and va ried are
the ways of devising, practising and approaching
the operation it purp o rts to descri b e . A ve ry wide
range of situations and behaviour exists in the space
between the formal opening of borders to foreigners
and offering them a warm welcome, between official
speeches and the attitude of the bu r e a u c r at at the

broadest sense of the term — t h at is, c o u n t ries that

The most obvious yardstick is numbers.This means
either the annual number of legal entries into a country
or the number of immigrants who have been there for
some time. By this cri t e ri o n , t wo countries stand out.
F i rst is the United States (720,000 entries in 1995,bu t

### 114147: Who goes where?
24 The UNESCO Courier - November 1998
Blood and fears
One major problem facing long-term immigrants is that of acquiring the nationality of the
country to which they emigrate and all the rights deriving from that status. W h e n
governments decide whether or not to grant such people citizenship, they apply two doctrines
which have their origin in Roman law, one based on place of birth,the other on descent.
The first,known by its Latin name jus soli (literally “right of the soil”) is applied by countries
that are traditionally favourable to immigration.They regard all people born on their territory as
c i t i z e n s, whatever their parents’ nationality. This model, of which Sweden, the United States,
Canada and France are examples, is based on the conviction that cultural diversity is not an
obstacle to integration.
The second model, which goes by the name of jus sanguinis, or “blood right”, g ra n t s
nationality in accordance with the principle of descent.A child of immigrants who is born in the
country where his or her parents live does not enjoy the new nationality but has to take their
nationality. This principle binds the family to its country of origin and seeks to maintain this link
from one generation to the next. The blood right principle operates in Japan,for example, and is
also applied by countries which have traditionally sent large numbers of people abroad,wish to
avoid a sharp drop in population and,in some cases, want to make it easier for people to return.
The two principles are not mutually exclusive. For example, a country trying to restrict the
i n flow of immigrants will endeavour to set aside jus soli in favour of jus sanguinis and thus deter
i m m i g rants from gaining the impression that, on arriving in the country, they are automatically
g u a ranteed nationality both for themselves and for their descendants. Obviously care has to be
t a ken when such changes in direction are made, because enjoyment of a country’s nationality
clearly offers political, economic and social adva n t a g e s, and attempts to restrict them may
trigger protest. n
rich countries where immigrants are actually in the
m a j o ri t y — Q atar (63.7%), Ku wait (71.6%) and the
United Arab Emirates (90.1% in 1990).The fig u r e s
for Saudi A r a b i a ,B a h r e i n ,O m a n ,B runei and Libya
ranged from 25% to 35% in 1990.
A second group of countries with a high
p r o p o rtion of immigrants consists of ve ry small
c o u n t ri e s , mainly Caribbean or Pa c i fic islands or
small states which often have some special stat u s ,
such as being a tax have n .They include Luxe m b o u r g
(37.8% foreigners ) , Macao (44.7%) and Monaco
( 6 7 % ) .
A third category comprises very large but still
s p a rsely populated “new countri e s ” , such as
Canada and Australia (16% to 22%). O t h e r
possible members of this cat e g o ry are the countri e s
of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
A fourth group is made up of We s t e rn industri a l
democracies where the proportion of immigrants
(much lower than generally supposed) is between
three and 10%.This includes most member states
of the European Union (those mentioned above
plus A u s t ria and Belgi u m : 9 % , and Sweden and
The Netherlands: 5 % ) . The United States could
also be added to this gr o u p. S w i t z e r l a n d , w i t h
18.9% in 1995, stands out here, but its geogr a p h i c a l
position, history and fiscal policy perhaps suggest
that it should belong to the second group.
The existence of a tradition of receiving
i m m i grants creates another set of cat e g o ri e s , w i t h
i m p o rtant implications for demogr a p hy (age
s t ru c t u r e ,f e rtility rat e ) ,a d m i n i s t r at i ve and legal stat u s
and economic, social and cultural integr at i o n .The list
includes countries with both long-established and
more recent pro-immigr ation policies, but also those
s t ates which have changed their policies in the past
few ye a rs.
In the developed wo r l d , only a few countri e s
have had pro-immigration policies for more than a
c e n t u ry now. They are Germ a ny, F r a n c e ,
Switzerland and the so-called “ n e w ” c o u n t ri e s
“ s e t t l e d ” by Europeans—countries such as
A u s t r a l i a , C a n a d a , New Zealand and the United
States.
But some countries in the South have we l l -
established pro-immigr ation policies too.
Merchants and workers from India have long been
received by the Sultanate of Oman, and people of
the Sahel by Côte d’Ivoire.For the last century or
more all Asian countries have taken in Chinese and
Indian immigr a n t s. On the other hand, there are
the new host countries which have in many cases
been surp rised and alarmed to find themselves a
magnet for immigration. Spain, Greece and Italy, as
well as the oil states of the Gulf, the Republic of Korea
and Thailand are undergoing this new experi e n c e ,
which partly explains why they find it hard to decide
where they stand on this issue.
“ O l d ” i m m i gr ation countries which are today
grappling with serious development problems have
virtually shut the door on immigrants. They include
B r a z i l , which has taken in several million from all ove r
the wo r l d , and A r g e n t i n a . Both of these countries eve n
b e c a m e , in the 1980s, notable sources of emigr ation to
the United States or Europe.
Why do countries receive immigrants? This is one
of the key questions which determines the attitude of
governments and one of the things dividing them—at
least in theory, since daily reality is much less clear
c u t . A d ve rtising immigr ation policies is not really a
g ove rnment pri o ri t y, and in the major immigr at i o n
countries the job of receiving immigrants takes many
different forms and involves complex and sometimes
contradictory alliances.
H owe ve r , three kinds of countries can be
identified—those which mainly see immigrants as an
extra or major source of labour, those which openly or
implicitly allow immigrants to stay permanently, and
those which take in immigrants for mainly
humanitarian reasons.
The first group is easily the biggest:South Africa,
the Gulf stat e s , G a b o n , the emerging economies of
Asia and Japan until the recent financial crisis and
most of We s t e rn Europe until the first oil cri s i s , i n
1973-75.
The second group contains the “ o l d ”i m m i gr at i o n
c o u n t ries listed earlier, plus Israel, for which the arri va l
of immigrants (in the sense understood by the Israelis)
or the return of people who had left is of the greatest
strategic importance. In this group, in contrast to the

Immigrants on the borderline
first one,the place of immigrants in the society, their
legal status and their acquisition of nationality are
issues of central importance and have gi ven rise to
extensive legislation.
The countries acting for humanitarian reasons have
a greed to open their borders to large numbers of
refugees who have been forced to leave their ow n
c o u n t ry either by a natural disaster or more often
because of wa r. More than a million Mozambicans
caught up in a civil war and plagued with famine found
refuge in neighbouring Malaw i , one of the wo r l d ’s
poorest countri e s , b e t ween 1975 and 1992.There are
still five million Afghans in Pakistan and Iran. A n d
despite the present closing of most borders , m a ny
c o u n t ries have fulfilled this humanitarian role one way
or another at some time in their recent history.
A cold
reception
As for the yardstick of quality, the handling of
i m m i gr ation and treatment of immigrants are extremely
s e n s i t i ve mat t e rs.They can be measured against the
words of the Bible: “I was a stranger and you took me
i n .”These words ring in the moral conscience of many
c o u n t ries both North and South,but they do not seem
to be really understood and put into practice.Few stat e s ,
including some of the major receiving countri e s ,h ave
r at i fied the intern ational conventions dealing with the
t r e atment of immigr a n t s.
Without knowing the exact legal situation of
i m m i grants in eve ry country,we can still draw a rough
picture of how things are.A first group contains those
c o u n t ries which say openly that they we l c o m e
i m m i grants and back up this commitment with a
sizeable arr ay of laws and other measures to fa c i l i t at e
the long-term or permanent settlement of new arri va l s.
These are A u s t r a l i a , Canada and Swe d e n . In some
way s , Israel belongs to this group too, but it chooses
i m m i grants on a religious or cultural basis.
A second group consists of those countries which
in practice receive immigrants but where the reception
is tempered by frequent displays of mistrust or

d i s c ri m i n at i o n , especially towards the most recent
a rri va l s.This happens in most immigr ation countri e s
in the We s t .Their geographical position, and ve ry
often their colonial past, the attraction of their
economic and cultural vitality and the power of their
m e d i a , the quality of their social and educat i o n a l
systems—all these fa c t o rs draw to them the migr a n t s
of an increasingly nomadic and interconnected
p l a n e t .
But such a trend causes confusion and sparks
resistance by a section of society. Most countri e s
do not want to admit, much less adve rt i s e , t h e i r
openness to immigr at i o n , so in practice they find it
very difficult to come up with clear and coherent
policies where immigr ation and integr ation are
concerned.So their laws on the matter are wobbly
and sometimes contradictory.
Subject to the whims
of the authorities
A foreigner who arri ves legally often gets
gr e e t e d , in effect, with folded arm s. H owe ve r ,e ve n
though immigrants may not find themselves in the
El Dorado or paradise they dreamed of, they do
get some social and legal protection which enables
them to plan a future for themselves and their
c h i l d r e n . The situation of illegal immigrants is
much tougher however.
Immigrants in the main receiving countries of
the South (Afri c a , A s i a , the Caribbean and the
Gulf) experience even more precarious conditions.
Their status is uncert a i n , they are totally dependent
on their employers and are subject to the whims of
the authorities and the absence of legal recourse.
This often results in large-scale summary
d e p o rt ations of undocumented aliens.Those in this
third group are much more vulnerable because of
the economic crisis,especially in Africa and Asia.
This world ove rv i e w, inevitably a schematic one,
passes no judgment on the validity of this or that
country’s policies, each one of which may have its
own rationale and justific at i o n . But it shows the
ve ry wide va riety of situations immigrants fin d
themselves in and also the broad range of attitudes
of those receiving them.
As globalization of movement and trade

which fa c i l i t ate intern ational mobility, and with the
a rri val in a gr owing number of countries of new and

of how to “ welcome the stranger”, which has so many
i m p l i c ations and such symbolic meaning, h a s
become more urgent than eve r. n

No major industrialized country can in good faith
d e ny the contri bution of immigrant labour to its
prosperity, not even “impenetrable” Japan with its
some 300,000 clandestine workers. Hardly any of their
construction projects could have materialized without
i m m i grant labour. N e ve rt h e l e s s , despite today ’s fast pace
of globalizat i o n , increasing migr ation movements and
the accelerating tendency towards cosmopolitan
s o c i e t i e s , i m m i grant wo r k e rs are still perpetual and
universal scapegoats, no more shielded in this respect
than their predecessors a century ago.
The intensity of exploitation and rejection may have
diminished in certain countri e s , but as always the
i m m i grant worker is only admitted to so-called “ h o s t
c o u n t ri e s ” in order to satisfy labour demand and lat e r
d i s c a r d e d , ve ry often like a paper handkerchief which has
s e rved its purp o s e .E ven people of immigrant ori gin may
take part in this rejection; those who have once been
exploited can themselves become formidable exploiters.
The human reality of immigr ation continues to be
n e g l e c t e d . The migrant worker is seen as nothing more
than “human capital”, and more as “ c a p i t a l ” t h a n
“ h u m a n ” .This is so both in developing countri e s ,l a r g e l y
because of the present economic cri s i s , and in the
i n d u s t rialized countri e s , including former sending
c o u n t ri e s , because of the upsurge of nat i o n a l i s m .
Since the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia began
in mid-1997, Thailand has expelled some 250,000
i m m i grant wo r k e rs , South Korea has “ l e n i e n t l y ”a l l owe d
50,000 illegal immigrants to leave the country instead of
fining or imprisoning them, and Malaysia has already
deported some 50,000 Indonesian workers, granting a
t wo-month amnesty as from 1 September 1998 for
illegal workers to leave the country voluntarily or face
s a n c t i o n s. These numbers do not include those who
m i gr ated intern a l l y, from the rural areas to the cities,
and have now been forced to return to their villages.
Vulnerable and ‘different’, immigrants are easy targets when their host
countries experience hard times
I m m i grant wo r k e rs in A f rica have not been
spared.One of the more recent examples is that of
South A f ri c a , which after having succeeded in
putting an end to the apartheid regime,intensified
its fight against clandestine immigrants whose
labour was no longer required.Between 1992 and
1 9 9 5 , South A f rica expelled almost 400,000
A f rican wo r k e rs , mainly Mozambicans whose
government had played such an active role against
apartheid.(See pages 28-29).
Contributing more
than they receive
In industrialized countri e s , g l o b a l i z ation has
p r ovo k e d , inter alia, the development of
nationalism, supported largely by those who have
become margi n a l i z e d , unable to keep up with
increasing competitive n e s s. Faced with an
increasing mass of discontented citizens, p o l i t i c i a n s
in search of electoral themes choose the easy way
out. It is more difficult to get across to the public
c o m p l i c ated explanations of economic theory,
global trade and financial markets than it is to to
attack new arri va l s , d e p riving them of access to
social security programmes so that “savings” thus
made may be used to aid the poor nat i o n a l s.
M e a n w h i l e , in all the industrialized countri e s ,
i m m i gr a n t s ’ c o n t ri butions to social protection
systems are higher than the benefits they receive.
Once considered to be the exclusive capital of
the far ri g h t , the use of immigrants as scapegoats is
n ow tempting other parties across the spectru m ,
from the right to the left. The United Stat e s , t h e

Xenophobic voices
‘Our people first!” (Belgium),“Out with the filth!” (Austria),“Hungarians are like Aids!”
(Romania),“France for the French!”(France).
With only slight variations, all far right-wing political parties hammer away with the same
s l o g a n : expel immigrants and everything will be better. The message, which has the merit of
simplicity, have proved attractive to many. Such ideas have contaminated a sizeable number of
voters in A u s t r i a ,I t a l y, Fra n c e, the Flemish part of Belgium,Denmark and the Czech Republic, w h e r e
nationalist parties are doing better and better at the polls. At recent elections, they have been
getting between 10 and 20 per cent of the vote, often entering government,at least at the local
level.They are also gaining ground in the former communist countries, including what was once
East Germany. For the moment,however, they have made no headway in Spain or the United
Kingdom.
Europe may be the world’s current stronghold of the organized far right,but sadly—as the
case of Australia shows—it has no monopoly on xenophobic ideologies. Racist ideas seem to be
among the world’s most widely-shared,manifesting themselves in a multitude of ways.
In the United States, which has taken in more than 55 million immigrants since 1820,there
is a growing number of organizations which, l i ke the Ku Klux Klan, campaign for white supremacy;
nearly 150 of them are thought to exist today. And the mainstream Republican Party sometimes
takes an anti-immigrant line worthy of some nationalist parties in Europe. An example was Bob
Dole’s presidential campaign in California in 1996.
Elsewhere in the world—in some African and Asian countries, for example—governments
have no problem adopting extreme right-wing policies, deporting thousands of people at times
of economic crisis. M e a n w h i l e, it is a remarkable fact that three Latin American countries—Pe r u ,
Ecuador and Argentina—have in recent years elected presidents of immigrant origin. n

Immigrants on the borderline
i m m i gr ation located in the A s i a - Pa c i fic regi o n ,w h e r e
the immigrant scapegoat is designated by his or her
colour and ethnicity. Pauline Hanson’s anti-
i m m i grant party does not point the finger at
European immigr a n t s , mostly of modest
b a c k gr o u n d ,but rather at Asians who have generally
poured substantial investment into the country and
at A b o ri gines whose ancestors lived in Australia we l l
before the arri val of immigrant settlers , i n c l u d i n g
the ancestors of Ms Hanson’s support e rs. (See art i c l e
page 33). H owe ve r , the target may not only not be a
f o r e i g n e r , but be of the same “ c o l o u r ” and “ e t h n i c
gr o u p ” as his or her at t a c k e rs : in June 1989 a
s o u t h e rn Italian was beaten to death in Verona by a
group of nort h e rn e rs. Ve ry often, in A f rica for
e x a m p l e , there is nothing physical or cultural to
distinguish an attacked immigrant from his or her
at t a c k e rs.
The mechanism is immutable and implacable:
a culpri t — e ven an imagi n a ry one—for the
difficulties afflicting a country must always be
found.When there is no foreigner to fit the bill,the
mechanism acts against those who are considered
different (see the history of Jewish communities)
or vulnerable (wo m e n ) . But immigrants are easy
targets because they are particularly vulnerable as
well as being “ d i f f e r e n t ” . They are generally not
a l l owed to vo t e . In developing countri e s , s h i f t i n g
the blame on immigrants is easy because of the
weakness or absence of democratic institutions to
uphold their rights. In industrialized countries it is
no more difficult to incite public opinion against
i m m i grants by invoking the right of freedom of
e x p r e s s i o n , despite the fact that exercise of this ri g h t
may jeopardize their fundamental rights.
Steps towards progress in the social field and
in fundamental and legal rights of immigrants now
seem to have come to a halt, and the timid
achievements realized so far are threatened.After
ten ye a rs of arduous negotiations within the United
Nations,its General Assembly finally approved on
18 December 1990 the new Intern at i o n a l
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
M i grant Wo r k e rs and Members of their Fa m i l i e s
(Resolution 45/158). This is the firs t - e ve r
i n t e rn ational instrument with a broad definition of
the rights of migrant wo r k e rs which offers some
means to ensure compliance with the provisions by
contracting states.
Twenty states must ratify the convention before it
can come into force. Almost eight ye a rs lat e r , o n l y

A return ticket
for the baker
A we l l - k n own cartoon shows a Frenchman who
accused foreign workers of “stealing the bread”of
French people and was unable to buy bread one
m o rning because his baker, of immigrant ori gi n ,
had returned to his home country. This once
actually happened in the French city of
Montbéliard.
In 1979-1980,about 35 per cent of the foreign
wo r k e rs living in Montbéliard’s twe n t y - t h r e e
s atellite tow n s , affected by the declining automobile
industry, accepted the French Government’s offer
of a “ r e t u rn premium”. N owhere else in France
was the acceptance rate so high and the
consequences were disastrous: schools had to close
d own because of insufficient pupils, and many
s h o p s , restaurants and other businesses had to stop
trading for lack of clients. This example clearly
s h ows that foreign wo r k e rs are not merely prov i d e rs
of labour. They and their familities are also
indispensable components of the society in which
they live and have their own role to play. n

The Gulf: a private contract
When a businessman in the Gulf wants some workers or a family wants a maid,the routine
is always the same. One of the many specialized agencies with contacts in countries of
emigration will organize everything in exchange for a commission.The agency will interview the
c a n d i d a t e s, have them sign a contract whose terms have been agreed with their future employer,
obtain all the necessary documents from the country of origin and the country they are going to,
and make all the travel arrangements.
Since the employer has advanced the entire cost of bringing the immigrant worker to the Gulf,
he wants to be sure of recuperating his investment.So as soon as new employees arrive, they
usually hand over their passport to their employer. This means they can neither return home
before the end of their contract nor legally get a job with another employer who might offer better
pay or conditions.
This sums up the agreement between employer and immigrant worke r. Its terms and how it is
respected are a private matter and the two sides are clearly not on an equal footing.The international
press has often reported on abuses of this dependence.
The percentage of immigrant workers in the total population is also the highest in the world
in the Gulf—at least 60 per cent everywhere and as much as 90 per cent in the United Arab
Emirates. The first wave of immigrants consisted mainly of other Arabs—Egyptians, Lebanese,
Palestinians and Yemenis—who worked as civil servants, especially in the education and health
sectors.
With the oil boom in the 1970s,a second wave of immigrants—legal and illegal—came from A s i a
and to a lesser extent from North A f r i c a . Much less qualifie d , they mostly became domestic serva n t s,
small traders and unskilled or partly skilled worke r s.
The original inhabitants of the Gulf were meanwhile gaining educational qualifications and
pushing for jobs to go with their new status. The collapse in oil prices hit the private sector and
government jobs very hard, and some of the region’s security services saw the situation as a
time tomb. So the Gulf states began to fill jobs with their own citizens and to “ r e g u l a t e ”
immigration.
This affected first the illegal immigrants, who had been tolerated until then.Now they were
either given legal documents or expelled.The data on this are both fragmentary and contested.
Official sources say 160,000 foreign workers have left the Gulf states since 1996,but observers
put the figure as high as half a million.
Some 24,000 officially left Oman between January and April this year. Qatar reports a little over
14,000 “regularizations”and nearly 4,000 repatriations over nine months. Neighbouring Saudi
A rabia announced last July that it had deported more than 800,000 illegal immigrants since
October 1997,most of whom had slipped into the country at the time of the annual pilgrimage
to Mecca. n

The derogat o ry term m a k we r e k we r e—a cru d e
o n o m atopoeic imitation of how foreigners speak—
is used to describe foreigners as “those we don’t
u n d e rs t a n d ” , and newspapers abound with the fie ry
r h e t o ric of xe n o p h o b e s. “These people carry
diseases which they spread around and they infect
u s ,” said a young shop-owner in A l e x a n d r a
township, a poor area near Johannesburg. Others
complain that “They take our jobs”and “are willing
to work for less than us.” The xenophobia has
become so dangerous that some describe it as an
epidemic which has become endemic.
Yet studies show that many foreigners are here on
legal visitors ’ p e rm i t s , o t h e rs are employing South
A f ricans in street and formal businesses and most
d o n ’t want to make this country their perm a n e n t
h o m e . Still the myths pers i s t . A local survey found
t h at about four in five respondents thought the South
A f rican gove rnment is too soft on foreigners. S o u t h
A f ri c a ’s different ethnic groups were at one in their
belief that gove rnment should batten down the
h atches and get tough with foreigners.
A conundrum for government
This populist push is fueling gove rnment action.
M a ny immigrants try to enter the country illegally
through the vast Kruger National Park in the nort h .
In the past six ye a rs , an army unit which only polices
illegal immigrants has caught 17,000 people trying to
enter the country. Most are from South Africa’s
n e i g h b o u ring stat e s ,although the statistics show that
Ta i wa n e s e , Pakistani and Eastern Europeans have
also been arr e s t e d . Existing immigr ation laws have
c riminalized between two and five million people
thought to be living in the country illegally.
South A f rican Home A f fa i rs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is responsible for
m i gr at i o n ,would like to receive a much gr e ater slice
of the nat i o n ’s budget for policing the borders , and is
on record as saying that the country is at risk from
f o r e i g n e rs who run criminal syndicat e s ,p r o s t i t u t i o n
rings and deal in contraband. But his policy papers
h ave been fine tuned and written in the know l e d g e
t h at South A f rica cannot win a place in the global
e c o n o my by adhering to the “ f o rtress South A f ri c a ”
school of migr ation policy. In fa c t , establishing a new
m i gr ation policy for the country presents
g ove rnment with a conundru m : the middle path lies
somewhere between open borders and “ f o rt r e s s
South A f ri c a ” and defining that path is still ve ry
much a work in progr e s s.
The gove rnment is looking toward a special
arrangement with the other countries in southern
A f rica and moving eventually toward open borders.
But this is a long way off. A 1995 draft agreement
to throw open borders was gi ven the thumbs-dow n
by gove rn m e n t . I n s t e a d , a more cautious ve rs i o n
a d vo c ating a phased instead of a big bang approach
was written in 1997.
In the meantime,the migrant and the train are
still indivisible. Except that now the trains are used
to deport illegal immigrants out of South A f ri c a .
They shunt the desperate and the destitute back to
their home countries in dingy carriages, dumping
them like unwanted surplus at the borders from
whence they came.
South A f rica has a new refugee policy in line
with United Nations standards; its migr at i o n
policies for citizens from the rest of the world will
move increasingly toward letting in only those the
country needs. It is suffering a brain drain with the
loss of key skills like those of doctors , d e n t i s t s ,
engineers and information technology specialists.
New policies will seek to create instead a brain gain
by “headhunting”talent to come to South Africa.
In the meantime, the tide of xenophobia is
swelling. It is a violent tide but one which appears
impotent in the face of the thousands of new
residents (legal and illegal) who arrive here every
day.They have turned the country into a veritable
salad of nat i o n a l i t i e s. Together with older
immigrant communities, they ensure that this is a
world in one country. n

n
A few months ago Italy’s Minister of the
Interior, Giorgio Napolitano, told parliament
t h at “Italy has a vo c ation as a country of
immigration.”This is an ironic twist of history. For
over a century Italians emigr ated on a massive scale,
but during the last twenty years the situation has
been reversed as hundreds of thousands of people
have come to Italy in search of a job and a new life.
They started to arri ve in the early 1980s.
Women came from Eri t r e a , where a war was on,
and Cape Ve r d e , looking for work as domestic
servants. Then the smiling faces of North African
café wa i t e rs and cooks began to appear in cities like
Rome and Milan. Egyptian wo r k e rs could be
spotted in the foundries of Emilia Romagna. I n
1 9 8 6 , when the Italian parliament passed for the
first time a law protecting the rights of wo r k e rs from
outside the European Community, the number of
these wo r k e rs was put at 500,000, out of a total
population of 57 million Italians.
The arri val of these newcomers signaled the
s t a rt of a new trend in a country which had,
r e gional disparities notwithstanding, b e c o m e
prosperous. In the mid-1970s,the other European
n ations closed their doors to immigr at i o n ,w h e r e a s
Italy adopted no specific measures to regulate a
phenomenon that was still new. The country also
looked with a different eye at its inform a l
“ u n d e r gr o u n d ”e c o n o my in which family members
sometimes employed one another, t a xes we r e
avoided and black market labour was often used.
Immigrant workers—flexible and easily-exploited
labour—found a place in that market.They wo r k e d
in homes, r e s t a u r a n t s ,s t o r e s ,s e rv i c e s ,c o n s t ru c t i o n ,
fa rming and, little by little, small- and medium-
sized companies.
I m m i gr ation became a socially recognized
p h e n o m e n o n . At the same time it stirr e d
c o n t r ove rsy and in some cases triggered xe n o p h o b i c
r e a c t i o n s. On the one hand, a s s o c i ations were set up
to defend immigr a n t s ’ ri g h t s ; on the other, t h e r e
were outbu rsts of racism, as in 1989 when a gang of
young delinquents near Naples murdered an
A f rican fa rm labourer.The killing galvanized public
opinion and the gove rnment decided to draft a new
bill concerning immigr at i o n , the status of foreigners
and their social ri g h t s.The bill became law in 1990
and enabled some 200,000 foreigners to obtain
residence permits.
A country to which
people come
Italy now has around one million officially
r e gistered immigrant wo r k e rs.A gove rnment report
published in June 1998 put the number of
undocumented aliens at between 200,000 and
300,000.The immigrants hail from an increasing
number and va riety of places, including the
M e d i t e rranean basin, China and the Indian sub-
c o n t i n e n t . In decreasing order, the largest
communities are from Morocco, the Philippines,
Tunisia, the People’s Republic of China, Senegal,
S ri Lanka, Po l a n d , Romania and other Ea s t
European countri e s. Recent ye a rs have seen an
increase in the number of undocumented aliens
from the former Yu g o s l avia and A l b a n i a , a direct
consequence of war and unrest in the Balkans.T h e
r e p o rt also says that “some communities have
stabilized considerably”, citing the gr owing number
of children and the increasing rate of family re-
unification.
Italy is still adapting to its new situation as a
c o u n t ry to which people come rather than leave .
For ye a rs informal networks made up of the foreign
communities themselves, private support groups,
o r g a n i z ations and a few local authorities organized
the reception of immigrants. Today the initiatives
they launched are often being taken up by
g ove rnment agencies. In the field of health care, f o r
example,a new figure has emerged—the “cultural

C a l i f o rn i a : land of Hollywo o d , Silicon Va l l e y,
Disneyland and movie stars—this has been the
popular conception of the names and symbols
a s s o c i ated with the US’s largest state for the better
p a rt of this century.Yet there is another Californ i a
which co-exists alongside this glamorous and
popular image. Cities like Monterey Pa r k ,
Huntington Park and areas like East Los Angeles are
the new ports of entry for immigrants from Mexico,
Central A m e ri c a ,Asia and the rest of the wo r l d .T h i s
less glamorous aspect of California is not as we l l
k n ow n . N o n e t h e l e s s , the ways in which Californ i a
adapts and adjusts to being the first home of new
i m m i grants will be critical in the twe n t y - first century
for the stat e ’s future,and perhaps for the future of the
United Stat e s. Most notably,C a l i f o rnia will gi ve the
c o u n t ry a glimpse of the future as it moves from a bi-
racial (black/white) understanding of minority issues
to a multi-cultural pers p e c t i ve that encompasses
predominantly Latinos as well as Asian A m e ri c a n s
and A f rican A m e ri c a n s.
H i s t o ri c a l l y, the United States has defin e d
m i n o rity group concerns in terms of a black and
white dynamic. Yet in California the black
community is actually the smallest of the minority
populations. Latinos and Asians,both native-born
and immigr a n t , are the largest minorities in the
s t at e . And this trend will continue. The Lat i n o
p o p u l at i o n1 in California is gr owing ten times as
fast as the A f rican A m e rican community and twice
as fast as the Asian American community.
Consider these additional fa c t s. C a l i f o rn i a ,w i t h
27 million inhabitants, is the USA’s most populous
s t ate and has the wo r l d ’s seventh largest economy.I t
is also a state with incredible ethnic dive rs i t y : in 1990
there were over six million foreign-born immigr a n t s
living there. The number of Mexican immigr a n t s
living in Los Angeles County could make it the third
largest Mexican metropolitan area outside of
M e x i c o. M o r e ove r , there are over half a million
S a l va d o rians and Guatemalans also living in
s o u t h e rn Californ i a . According to the US Census,
there are also over two million immigrants from
Asian countries living in the stat e , the largest of them,
the Chinese and Korean, n u m b e ring over 200,000

language television stat i o n s. One Spanish language

than any English language television stat i o n .T h e
e n t r e p r e n e u rial vitality of California is constantly
e n riched thanks to a blend of Asian capital and the
large Latin A m e rican labour force.
Yet the presence and magnitude of such a large
i m m i grant population has created a backlash
among native California voters,most of whom are
neither of Latin A m e rican nor Asian descent. I n
the 1990s, C a l i f o rnia has had statewide votes on
i n i t i at i ves that would deny schooling and other
social services to children of undocumented
i m m i gr a n t s. Most recently, the state passed an
initiative that would eliminate bilingual education
for immigrant children.
The basis for these initiat i ves has been largely
d ri ven by the negat i ve stereotypes surr o u n d i n g
i m m i grants from Mexico and Central A m e ri c a .
According to these stereotypes,Mexican and Central
A m e rican immigrants are predominantly illegal, d o
not fully part i c i p ate in the labour force and are not
adapting to A m e rican culture by not learning English.
The facts present a different picture. A c c o r d i n g
to the US Immigr ation and Nat u r a l i z ation Serv i c e ,
immigrants from Latin America have constituted
over 30 per cent of the entire number of immigr a n t s
to the United States in the past three decades.The
p ri m a ry destination of these legal immigrants from
Mexico and Central A m e rica  has been Californ i a .
For example, close to 50 per cent of all Mexican
i m m i grants list California as their destinat i o n .
When one looks at the percentage of immigrants
p a rt i c i p ating in the labour force, the facts also
contradict the stereotypes. Mexican and Central
A m e rican immigrants have labour force
p a rt i c i p ation (62 per cent) that equals, if not

e x c e e d s ,t h at of the white non-Hispanic labour force
and far exceeds that of native African Americans. A
number of other facts help explain the Lat i n o
immigrant community in California.
Firstly, it is a complex community. The city of
Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spain. Some
L at i n o s , albeit a small minority in Californ i a , c a n
trace their ancestry in the United States back over
many generations. Most of California’s Latinos are
recent immigrants,however. Over half of the state’s
Latino adult population is foreign-born.
S e c o n d l y, L atino communities are composed of
both nat i ve - b o rn and immigr a n t s , but outside
o b s e rve rs tend to confuse the two gr o u p s.
S p e c i fic a l l y, outside observe rs look at an ethnic
e n c l ave like East Los Angeles and see a profusion
of both written and spoken Spanish. Some conclude
from their observations that Latino immigr a n t s
don’t want to learn English.Again,the facts show a
different picture.The English language acquisition
r ate among Hispanic immigrants is roughly the same
as those of other US immigrant gr o u p s. A m o n g
Mexican Americans born in the United States, 94
per cent are English profic i e n t ; amongst the foreign-
b o rn only 51 per cent are English profic i e n t . In fa c t ,
one out of eve ry three Latino immigrants is
monolingual in English.
Putting down
roots
The explanation for this is simple. M a ny legal
i m m i grants come to the US as children, a n d
although they speak Spanish in the home, they speak
English in school and at wo r k .As time goes on, t h e y
gradually lose profic i e n cy in their nat i ve language
and come to rely on their acquired language. T h e
other two-thirds of the immigrants list their language
proficiencies in the following ways: one-third were
monolingual in Spanish and one-third we r e
b i l i n g u a l . By the third generat i o n , H i s p a n i c
immigrants are overwhelmingly fluent in English.
Outsiders often tend to think that Mexican and
Central A m e rican immigrants are only interested in
s aving enough money to go back home. Once again,
the facts dispute this popular perception.When legal
immigrants were asked in a national survey if they
planned to stay in the US, an overwhelming nine
out of ten said ye s ; 98 per cent of Latino immigr a n t s
feel life is better in the US than it is back in their
home country.4 Of cours e , some do return home;
some also send back money orders to their relat i ve s.
But as time goes by, the roots become deeper,their
attachments more firm . In short , they follow the
same patterns as earlier European immigrants.
The future of Mexican, Central American and
other Latin Americans in California is clear. Given
their numbers, and the larger family sizes of Latin
i m m i gr a n t s , this population will continue to increase
dramatically. One generation from now, in the year
2020, there will be as many Californians of Latino
descent (25 million) as there are Latinos living in
the entire US at present. C a l i f o rn i a ’s future is
i n e x t ricably linked with that of its large Lat i n o

Immigrants on the borderline
n
Zero immigr ation—the call of Pa u l i n e
H a n s o n ’s One Nation party—is threat e n i n g
the dreams of thousands of potential settlers
to Australia, a country that once opened its arms
wide to people seeking a new way of life.
The threat took shape with Hanson’s message
t h at “ We are in danger of being swamped by A s i a n s ” ,
d e l i vered in her maiden speech to A u s t r a l i a ’s Fe d e r a l
Parliament two ye a rs ago. Since then it has escalat e d
to the point where the party she leads won a quart e r
of the votes in a recent state election and threat e n s
the strongholds of the existing part i e s.
Australia has been proud of its populat i o n
d i ve rsity over the last 25 ye a rs since it changed its
r e s t ri c t i ve immigr ation policy (the White A u s t r a l i a
p o l i cy) to one that is non-discri m i n at o ry. T h e
c o u n t ry now draws on people from 150 countri e s
as settlers.
Subject to a yearly quota, the policy allow s
a nyone from any country to apply to migr at e
regardless of their ethnic ori gi n , s e x , colour or
r e l i gi o n .Whether or not an applicant is accepted as
a settler depends on a points score that takes into
account English language ability, skills and fa m i l y
links and support .
Today about one in four Australians was born
overseas.About five per cent of them were born in
Asian countri e s , 6.2 per cent in the United
K i n g d o m , 6.8 per cent elsewhere in Europe and
1.2 per cent in the Middle East and North Africa.
Since the Second World War a total of 5.6
million people have migrated to Australia. Under
p r e vailing policies migr ation is projected to help
increase A u s t r a l i a ’s population from the present
18.5 million to 23 million in 50 years time.
The gove rnment has responded to the One
N ation Pa rty with a major national campaign to sell
its immigr ation policy.The Minister for Immigr at i o n
and Ethnic A f fa i rs , Philip Ruddock, has travelled the
n ation making it clear there is “no place for racism in
A u s t r a l i a ” .The question, he say s , is “not how do we
stop migr at i o n ,but how do we manage it to gain the
best outcomes for A u s t r a l i a .”
Opposition to Pauline Hanson’s policies has
been loud and vocal, and community support for
m i gr ation dive rsity has come strongly from dive rs e
and influential sources. A joint statement by the
e m p l oye r , l a b o u r , r e l i gious and social we l fa r e
groups spelt it out: “ We Australians should be
proud of the way in which migrants have
t r a n s f o rm e d ,s t r e n g t h e n e d , and enriched our nat i o n
economically, socially and culturally.”
The One Nation party draws on the gr ow i n g
resentment of some Australians who see newcomers
taking “ t h e i r ” jobs in a contracting workforce in an
e c o n o my increasingly affected by the Asian dow n t u rn ,
taking “ t h e i r ” places at the ove r c r owded unive rs i t i e s
and defrauding the gove rnment benefits system.
Environmental groups and the political parties
t h at represent them are also calling for reduced
immigration.They want Australia to determine its
“ c a rrying capacity”—just how many people the
c o u n t ry can continue to sustain without furt h e r
polluting its land, b e a c h e s , ri ve rs and wat e r way s
and endangering its rare plants, birds and animals.
In response to some of these criticisms the
g ove rnment has begun to tighten up the conditions
under which migr ation applicants will be successful by
a l l o c ating 50 per cent of places to skilled people, a n d
by clamping down on those who ove rs t ay their visas,
work illegally and exploit the appeal procedures to
prolong their illegal residence or abuse the we l fa r e
s y s t e m .
The chairman of the Fe d e r ation of Ethnic
A f fa i rs Council of A u s t r a l i a , Randolph A lw i s , i s
c ritical of the gove rn m e n t ’s “ p a n d e ring to extreme
e l e m e n t s ” in A u s t r a l i a . By accenting skills and
English language ability, Australia is in effect
applying indirect discri m i n at i o n , he say s ,t h e r e b y
excluding highly desirable migr a n t s. Some of
A u s t r a l i a ’s business leaders of today arri ved in
Australia without a word of English, he points out.
“There are a lot of cases of highly skilled people,
who because of systemic prejudices, are unable to
get jobs straight away.They are going through a lot
of hardships because, under government policies,
they get no social benefits for two years,” he says.
“Other countries are paying a lot of attention to
our immigr ation policy,”he wa rn s.“ People who have
a choice, who have the skill and knowledge will

### 114153: Immigration policy in a global economy
34 The UNESCO Courier - November 1998
I m m i g ration policy in
n
I m m i gr ation is increasingly seen in terms of threat s.
The prevalent image of this threat in the deve l o p e d
c o u n t ries of the North is one of mass invasion by
hundreds of millions of poor from around the wo r l d .T h e
overarching response in these countries is to militari z e
their borders and to maximize policing inside them.
I m m i gr ation thus becomes suffused in a mentality of
n ational cri s i s , and unilateral sovereign action emerges as
the only effective response.
This is of course not the first time in the history of
the twentieth century that immigr ation has been
p o rt r ayed as threatening and that there has been a
clamour for strong unilateral state action. But today
the context has radically changed. S t ates have been
forced by major economic trends to approach more
and more matters multilaterally. Unilateral strongman
tactics in military operations are less acceptable in
i n t e rn ational fora and are generally seen as less effective
than multilateral approaches. For the first time
i n n ovations in intern ational law have subjected nat i o n a l
states to supranational authorities.
The context is also radically different when it comes
to the use of policing as a key approach to more effective
immigrant regulation. Today far more civil rights
instruments are available to judges and there is a
gr owing trend towards the constitutionalizing of civil
rights in both the United States and in Europe.T h e r e
are also far more human rights instruments ava i l a b l e
to judges and they are much more likely to be used
than was the case even ten ye a rs ago.
Fi n a l l y,there is a sharpening sense of the concept
of civil society. S t r at e gic sectors of the citizenry,
especially in the United Stat e s , h ave asserted their
right to criticize and even take to court va ri o u s
g ove rnment agencies, most particularly police
a g e n c i e s.These conditions contrast sharply with the
call for stronger police action vis à vis immigr a n t s.
When the object of stronger police action is a broad
s p e c t rum of people—immigrant wo m e n , men and
children—sooner or later it will get caught in the
expanding web of civil and human ri g h t s , it will violat e
those ri g hts and interfere with the functioning of civil
s o c i e t y.
In the United Stat e s , for example, t h e
I m m i gr ation and Nat u r a l i z ation Service (INS) can
n ow excercise its police authority on individuals
Economic globalization may encourage—or even force—the states of the North
to get together and frame enlightened multilateral immigration policies

If my son decided to go write the gr e at A m e ri c a n

could well be one of the suspects, because I know
he would not be carrying his US passport with him.
M a ny of these INS actions can escape accountability
in front of a judge if the persecuted are merely
suspected of being undocumented. Sooner or lat e r
stronger policing and the weakening of judicial
review of such police actions will interfere with the
a s p i r ation towards the rule of law that is such a deep

Defending
the rule of law
Acting on immigr ation as if it were a national cri s i s
is today both unsustainable and undesirable for stat e s
under the rule of law. P r e c a rious and partial as the
concept of the rule of law may be, and imperfect as its
i m p l e m e n t ation is, it is nonetheless an impressive tool
in the struggle for a better and more democrat i c
s o c i e t y. A s p i r ation to it strongly conditions political
and civic order in the highly developed countri e s.T h e
rule of law in good part means the right of citizens to
be free from abuses by the state and is not enhanced

by the expanded use of policing as an instrument to
maintain control over immigr at i o n .
Since it is likely that cross-border migr ation will
continue as the world becomes increasingly
g l o b a l i z e d , it is urgent that we rethink and innovat e
on the policy front.As we develop the cross-border
integration of markets for goods and services, for
capital, for information, and for communications,
I would argue that the flow of people will continue
a p a c e .This will be especially the case among the top
l e vel professionals whose mobility is an essential
part of the integration of markets,and among low-
wage wo r k e rs for whom cross-border mobility is
often the only option.
The powerful actors in the new economic order,
such as global corp o r ations and global markets
often more powerful than many a government,are
already hard at work setting up, albeit a mostly
p ri vat e , system of rule that protects the rights of
these actors no matter what country they choose for
their operat i o n s. And stat e s , m a ny enorm o u s l y
r e l u c t a n t ,h ave joined in the multiplying multilat e r a l
e f f o rts that the new economic order demands. M o r e
and more of them have relinquished capacities and
c o m p e t e n c e s , and even bits and pieces of their
s ove r e i g n t y, in the name of a more effective
m u l t i l ateral economic order.They have done so not
only de fa c t o, in some low - l e ve l ,c l o s e - t o - t h e - gr o u n d
o p e r ational sense, but also de jure through the
f o rm a li z ation of these changes in national and
international law.Yet in the realm of immigration
p o l i cy we see the continuat i o n , and eve n
s t r e n g t h e n i n g, of unilateral state action, t h e
i nvo c ation of absolute and undiminished stat e
sovereignty.
This raises several questions concerning the
v i a b i l i t y, e f f e c t i veness and desirability of such a
f r a m e work for policy. Can such an immigr at i o n
r e gime be viable when most other cross-border
flows are increasingly centred in multilat e r a l i s m
and diminished state sovereignty? Even if it is viable
is it the most effective way of proceeding? Similarly
with the expansion of a policing approach. Is it
viable or effective in the context of a strengthening
civil society and human rights? When it comes to
d e s i r a b i l i t y, the issues around immigr ation are
probably more ambiguous than in the case of trade
and capital flow s , and become entangled in a va ri e t y
of well-founded rationales along with ill-guided
political passions.
I believe that multilateralism is a better way to
proceed in a broad range of mat t e rs , i n c l u d i n g
i m m i gr at i o n , because it is essential to creat e — a n d
i nvent—policies that have receiving and sending
c o u n t ries working together. I also consider the
expansion of policing undesirable and not the way for
enlightened societies to proceed.W h at e ver the control
a c h i e ve d , the trade-offs are too costly both for the
i m m i grants themselves but also especially for the
receiving societies in terms of violations of civil and
human rights and the threats to the fa b ric of civil

R e g u l ation is necessary but achieving it does
not necessitate militarizing borders and maximizing
i n t e rnal policing.W hy? Because of a combination of
three fa c t o rs. F i rs t , far from being a mass inva s i o n ,
im m i gr ation is pat t e rned and bounded in time and
s p a c e . S e c o n d , n ational states are acquiring gr e at e r
competence in multilateral management because of
economic globalization and hence may be more
competent to develop multilateral co-operat i o n
mechanisms with sending countri e s. T h i r d , a g a i n
because of economic globalization national states have
had to learn to accommodate a gr owing number of
conditions and norms coming from intern ational fora.
This combination of fa c t o rs signals the possibility of
new approaches to regulating immigr at i o n .
The key to a more enlightened and less crisis-
o riented approach is the fact that migr ations are
p at t e rn e d . The evidence about intern at i o n a l
m i gr ations in the United Stat e s , in We s t e rn Europe
and in Japan shows that intern ational migr at i o n s
are patterned,bounded in scale and duration,and
conditioned by other processes.They are not simply
an indiscri m i n ate flow from pove rty to prosperity as
is suggested by the imagery of “mass invasions”.If
poverty were enough to produce emigration,then
the developed countries would indeed be
threatened with massive invasions. But it is only a
very tiny fraction of all the poor who emigrate and
they do so from ve ry specific areas and towa r d s
equally specific destinations.
F u rt h e rm o r e ,most migr ations end.They do not
go on for centuri e s. Fifty ye a rs seems to be a fa i r l y
l e n g t hy duration for most cross-border migr ations in
the United States and We s t e rn Europe—that is to
s ay, s p e c i fic migr ation processes of a gi ven nat i o n a l i t y
group to a particular locat i o n .I n d e e d ,t wenty ye a rs
is probably more common in Europe. One of the
reasons for this is that such migr ations tend to be
embedded in the cycles and phases of the receiving
a r e a s.D r a m atic examples of this include the migr at i o n s
of hundreds of thousands of Italian and Spanish wo r k e rs
to nort h e rn Europe that were in full swing in the 1960s
and basically ended in the 1970s.To d ay, when Italians
and Spaniards are free to move within Europe, there is
almost no new migr at i o n . T h at particular phase of
labour migr at i o n , embedded as it was in the post-wa r
r e c o n s t ruction of Europe and then in the expansion of
the 1960s, came to an end when these conditions no
longer held, and Spain and Italy became prosperous.
If intern ational migr ations are conditioned,p at t e rn e d
and bounded processes, the policy response need not be
c o n fined to maximizing border control. We can move
away from a mentality of national crisis to one of
m a n a g e m e n t .This may be a good time for such a change.
There is some consensus about the existence of a
widening gap between immigr ation policy intent and
i m m i gr ation reality in the major developed receiving
c o u n t ri e s.An important nine-country study published in
1 9 9 41 found that the gap between the goals of nat i o n a l
i m m i gr ation policy (law s ,r e g u l at i o n s ,e xe c u t i ve actions,
e t c.) and the actual results is wide and gr owing wider in
all major industrialized countri e s. It also found that
i m m i gr ation officials in all nine countries were less
c o n fident about the effectiveness of policy than their
p r e d e c e s s o rs fifteen ye a rs before.

m at t e r. C e rtainly the implementation of a new
economic order required an enormous amount of
problem solving and innovat i o n . It is not evident to me
t h at the last round of negotiations on the General
A greement on Ta riffs and Trade (GAT T ) , the so-called
U ru g u ay Round, was any less complex than
i m m i gr ation regulat i o n . It took ye a rs of wo r k , but it got
d o n e . I am convinced that we need a radical rethinking
of key aspects of the regulation of immigr ation and an
e n o rmous amount of innovation if we are to have a
more effective and enlightened set of immigr at i o n
p o l i c i e s. Some of this work is under way in the
European Union,which has seen considerable and at
times radical innovations in the last ten years on the
subject of immigration.
F i n a l l y, there is now a so-called “ c o n c e rt e d
c o n s e n s u s ” among a gr owing number of nat i o n a l
s t ates around the shared objective of furt h e ri n g
economic globalization and the major policy
o ri e n t ations that come with it—deregulat i o n ,
p ri vat i z at i o n , a n t i - i n flation policies, and foreign-
exchange parity with the leading curr e n c i e s.These are
all fundamental conditions for the implementation of
global capital markets. Along with the World Tr a d e
O r g a n i z ation and the environmental agenda, they have
forced states to develop new competences to act
m u l t i l at e r a l l y. They may suggest that national stat e s
can be led—or forced—to adopt a more international
u n d e rstanding of subjects such as immigr ation that
used to be regarded in purely domestic terms. n

Israeli Galil and the We s t e rn made M-16.
The Kalashnikov family counts about 70
million guns, most of which are still in

From Yemen to Sri Lanka,the world is
awash in small arms and light we a p o n s
which are generally defined as those that
can be carried by an individual or fired by
a small crew. Small arms range from
revolvers to sub-machine guns while light
weapons include small mort a rs ,h a n d - h e l d

of anti-tank and aircraft missiles.

Along the Namibia-Angola border, he has

treaties concerning nuclear, chemical and
conventional weapons,they have not even
a greed on intern ational standards for
classifying or regi s t e ring small arms and
light weapons, let alone a UN convention
c o n c e rning their transfer. And ye t , they are
the pri m a ry or sole tools of violence in
v i rtually all the armed conflicts curr e n t l y
dealt with by the United Nat i o n s ,
according to Jayantha Dhanapala, U N
Under Secretary General for
D i s a rm a m e n t . O ver 90 per cent of the
victims of small arms are civilians, w i t h
women and children accounting for 80 per
cent of casualties.
H owe ve r , the political tides may be
c h a n gi n g . An intern ational campaign is
n ow underway with non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGOs) of all stripes and
c o l o u rs — d i s a rmament and gun control
groups along with development and human
rights associations in the North and
S o u t h — building common ground with the
a c t i ve support of gove rnments like Mali,
C a n a d a , N o r way and Ja p a n . B u oyed by
success in banning landmines, they are
setting their sights on small arms and light
we a p o n s , despite the major differences
b e t ween them.The networks for producing
and procuring light weapons are far more
d i ve rse and widespread than that for
landmines. Small arms, unlike the mines,
are also culturally embedded in many
s o c i e t i e s. Uprooting the my riad of gun
cultures will take far more than a
c o nvention regulating their manufa c t u r e ,
use or export.
But before dismissing the campaign as
just another liberal wave of good intentions,
there seems to be growing interest on the
part of some major political powers which
just happen to be major arms suppliers.
While developing countries have borne the
b runt of the casualties, European and
N o rth A m e rican countries are now
increasingly concerned as these we a p o n s
fuel the fires of ethnic and intra-stat e
c o n flicts raging in their backya r d s ,
particularly in the Balkans.
“ We are suddenly finding the doors
widening from all kinds of governments,”
says Geraldine O’Callaghan of the British
A m e rican Security Inform ation Council
( B A S I C ) , an independent research
o r g a n i z at i o n . “The interest is also linked to
the fact that these weapons don’t have the
same dollar value as the big ticket items like
jets and tanks. Light weapons initiat i ve s
take attention away from the big weapons
i n d u s t ry.” O’Callaghan also points to the
links between guns, d rugs and organized
c ri m e , which rank high on domestic
a g e n d a s. By focusing on efforts to curb this
illicit trade, governments can score points
with voters.
E s t i m ates of the black market are
s k e t c hy at best. I n t e rn ational trade in small
arms reportedly runs at between three and
five billion dollars a ye a r. According to a
UN study, the black market amounts to
about 40 per cent of the legal trade,
although some experts maintain that it
could equal or surpass it.And even less is
known about the “grey market” of covert
sales between gove rnments and to non-
state actors.
The National Rifle Association’s
political clout
Despite the lack of data, the past year
has seen a wave of initiat i ves to curb the
illicit trade.The Organization of American
S t ates (OAS) brokered a conve n t i o n
outlining practical measures to notably
strengthen import / e x p o rt controls and
increase inform ation exchange betwe e n
s t at e s. In short , s t ates agreed that guns
would be marked with the time and place of
m a n u facture along with the name of the
i m p o rter should they cross a border.
Mexico turned the screws on the United
S t ates gove rn m e n t , for whom any t h i n g
resembling gun control is taboo given the
political weight of the National Rifle
A s s o c i ation (NRA), a UN accredited NGO
which ferociously defends the individual’s
right to bear we a p o n s. The Mexicans
maintained that it was impossible to stop
drugs streaming north so long as US guns
inundated states south of the border.
Looking to the OAS convention as a
m o d e l , the UN Economic and Social
Council is now working to incorp o r at e
similar measures in the form of a “ F i r e a rm s
P r o t o c o l ” which would fall within the
Tr a n s n ational Organized Cri m e
C o nve n t i o n . The proposed protocol wo n
the official support of the G-8 (Group of
Eight Industrialized States) during a
meeting in A p ril 1998. And just a month
l at e r , foreign ministers of the European
Union signed an ethical code of conduct
essentially calling on states to refrain from
t r a n s f e rring weapons to conflict zones or
states likely to use them to commit serious
human rights abu s e s.While a step forwa r d ,
there are serious loopholes, notably in the
lack of provisions for parliamentary or
public scrutiny over arms exports.
With the possible exception of the EU
c o d e , these initiat i ves represent a law
enforcement approach, the success of
which depends on gove rnments adopting
and enforcing strict legal controls on
weapons licenses. For some expert s , i t
marks an important shift away from the
traditional view in which guns are seen as a
commodity to be traded like any other
which exonerates the suppliers from
responsibility over their end use.
“The focus on the illicit trade is
basically an uncontroversial way of getting
into the debate surrounding light
we a p o n s ,” s ays Elizabeth Clegg of
S a f e r wo r l d , an NGO. “While states like the
United States have traditionally blocked
a ny moves to restrict the production and
sale of light weapons because there could
be domestic implications,they could have
little to say on attempts to curb illicit
transactions.
“ H owe ve r , this approach does not
address the problem of all the arm s
manufactured legally but which have gone
through several chains of supply and are
n ow in the grey and black market,” s ay s
Clegg.
“ I t ’s dangerous,” s ays Joost Hilterm a n n

Asia’s booming
sex business
The sex industry is assuming massive
proportions in Southeast A s i a .The fin d i n g s
of a study carried out by the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) in four countries of
the region (Indonesia, P h i l i p p i n e s, M a l a y s i a
and Thailand) speak for themselves:
prostitution is generating millions of dollars,
currently amounting to between 2 per cent and
14 per cent of gross national product (GNP).
The ILO study, entitled The Sex Sector: The
economic and social bases of prostitution in
Southeast Asia, states that “although the exact
number of working prostitutes in these
countries is impossible to calculate due to the
illegal or clandestine nature of the work,
anywhere between 0.25 per cent and 1.5 per
cent of the total female population are
engaged in prostitution”.Even more serious,
the industry also includes thousands of
c h i l d r e n , who are forced to prostitute
themselves and are victims of threats or
v i o l e n c e, “which always leave them with a
series of after-effects”.
In 1993, an estimate for Thailand spoke
of between 30,000 and 50,000 child
prostitutes while, in the case of the Philippines,
the ILO states that “a 1997 report put the
number of child victims of prostitution at
7 5 , 0 0 0 ” . It stresses that “ I n t e r n a t i o n a l
conventions all treat child prostitution as an
unacceptable form of child labour:the goal is
its total elimination”—and,at the same time,
also the elimination of adult prostitution.
In practical terms, responsible tra v e l l e r s
can contribute to a campaign known as “End
Child Prostitution in Asian To u r i s m ” ( E C PAT )
which is being conducted by a number of non-
governmental organizations, by reporting to
the police on any suspicious activities at the
places they visit and in their own countries
when they return home. n

m u s t .You cannot get rid of the illegal trade
without monitoring the legal trade.And to
do that, you need to focus on government
p o l i cy,” s ays Hilterm a n n , who points to
such classic tactics by which governments
sell to second parties which then transfer
the weapons to a third stat e , possibly in
d e fiance of a UN embargo, or to a non-
state actor.
Distinguishing between the legal and
illegal trade has proven to be a political
m i n e fie l d .A l a rms began ri n ging in  A u g u s t
when Canada’s Foreign Minister Lloy d
A x wo rt hy, a key player in the campaign
after his involvement in brokering the ban
on landmines, began asking foreign
m i n i s t e rs to consider a global convention to
prohibit the transfer of military -
s p e c i fic ation small arms and light we a p o n s
to non-state actors. According to a
discussion paper by the Canadian foreign
m i n i s t ry, “these non-state actors are
va riously term e d : t e rr o ri s t s , g a n g s t e rs ,
b a n d i t s , wa r l o r d s , hooligans and
n a r c o t r a f f i c k e rs.” While recognizing that
the proposed convention “ would deny arm s
to non-state actors opposing repressive

“This is a ve ry controve rsial issue,
especially in the South,” s ays A l e j a n d r o
Bendaña of the Center for Intern at i o n a l
Studies in Managua, N i c a r a g u a . “ T h i s
proposal would have banned gi v i n g
weapons to the A f rican National Congr e s s
d u ring apartheid or to any other liberat i o n
m ove m e n t .”
Mr A x wo rt hy seems to have taken a
step back from his proposal. D u ring a
September meeting at the UN on the subject,
he highlighted the links between the legal and
illegal trade in supporting the idea of a UN
conference on the subject, possibly in the ye a r
2000.
Confusion of the issues is expected given
the complicated nature of the subject and the
d i ve rsity of the actors invo l ve d . In pri vat e
c o nve rs at i o n s , l aw enforcement officials
express concern , for example, in dealings with
some disarmament and gun-control groups.
By openly calling for changes to domestic gun
laws, these groups may be offering the NRA
the political ammunition needed to drag the
US administration away from the negotiat i n g
t a b l e . As NRA spokesperson Tom Mason
e x p l a i n s , “ we are like an 800-pound gori l l a
sitting on the US administration.”
Other experts are concerned that in try i n g
to convince the public, p a rticularly in the
N o rt h , t h at disarmament is possible, t h e r e
will be a hasty rush to set up gun buy-back
projects and strat e gies concerning gun
t a g gi n g, for example, without the technical
e x p e rtise required. And gi ven the politics
i nvo l ve d , mistakes can prove costly—which
raises the question of the campaign’s fin a n c e s.
“The funds should not be diverted from
d e velopment bu d g e t s ,” s ays Bendaña, “ n o r
should they be diluted by going towa r d s
television commercials in the North and
professional lobbying. C o u n t ries just coming
out of conflicts need demilitarizing—not just
taking away mines but depolarizing divisions
within society. This is ve ry delicat e . . . . We
s h o u l d n ’t build up expectations about the
possible political success of this campaign.
C o nventions wo n ’t eliminate the demand for
guns or the roots of violence because the
economic violence will continue. . . . This is
just one step in a long process.” n

### 114155: Africa's video alternative
Movie-makers in English-speaking Africa who cannot afford
to produce classic celluloid films are winning popular acclaim
with low-cost video productions
Africa’s video  a
n
In the Third World and among urban
ghetto dwe l l e rs in advanced countri e s ,
some technological inventions are used
in ways that were never imagined or
intended by their ori gi n at o rs. They open
up new areas of endeavour that can be
independently pursued by the
underprivileged.To take one example,the
availability of low-cost samplers and four-
track sound recording equipment has
t riggered a formidable explosion of ghetto-
based rap music in the United States by
making it possible for relat i ve l y
u n s o p h i s t i c ated young people with ve ry
little money to record high-quality music
tracks in their own homes.
In the same ve i n , the emergence and
p r o l i f e r ation of inexpensive VHS video tape
r e c o r d e rs have led to the gr owth of video-
based movie production in several A f ri c a n
c o u n t ri e s , especially Nigeria and Ghana.To
u n d e rstand the importance of this
p h e n o m e n o n , it must be borne in mind that
film production in most A f rican countri e s
o ri gi n ated pri m a rily as a result of extern a l
a s s i s t a n c e , r ather than truly indigenous
e f f o rt s. It was essentially because of the
availability of technical and fin a n c i a l
assistance from the French Co-operat i o n
M i n i s t ry that countries of francophone
A f rica such as Senegal and Burkina Fa s o
made considerable progress in fil m
p r o d u c t i o n .
Prohibitive
production costs
In the English-speaking countri e s ,on the
other hand,where assistance of this kind wa s
not readily ava i l a b l e , film production
generally lagged behind in the absence of
meaningful cultural policies designed to
s u p p o rt indigenous fil m - m a k e rs. N o n -
subsidized film production was possible for
a time in the 1970s and 1980s because the
e c o n o my was bu oyant enough to recoup the
high costs of using rented equipment from
ove rseas and paying for processing and
p rinting in European laborat o ri e s.
In the late 1980s, the local economy
v i rtually collapsed, robbing the middle
classes and the population at large of the
means to pay consistently for leisure
e n t e rt a i n m e n t .The cost of film production
became prohibitive .E ven a low - budget fil m
costing only $50,000 could not pay for itself
on the local market. As a result no one
ventured into film production. Hence the
drought of Nigerian-made fil m s , a
seemingly incomprehensible paradox in
view of the growing number of films made
in relat i vely small and economically less
well endowed countries of francophone
Africa.
Another major obstacle to fil m
production in most African countries has
been that there are no true television
Video film production in Ghana has become an industry.

s t at i o n s. In most cases, A f rican television
s t ations are shells which serve as relay posts
for films produced elsewhere. They have
little or no production capability, and have
no funds with which to purchase or co-
produce feature films or television series.
Story-telling
with panache
H owe ve r , the proliferation of V H S
video tape recorders in pri vate homes in
c o u n t ries like Nigeria and Ghana has
c r e ated a radically new situation which has
led to the emergence of a legion of
independent indigenous movie directors
and television producers. They have
emerged because of their ability to solve
t wo key problems: firs t , p e g ging mov i e
production costs at a level that can be easily
r e c overed on the local market, and second,
c r e ating distri bution mechanisms that
bypass the lack of indigenous television
s t ations and the limitations of a feeble
network of cinema houses.
Most of these productions are low -
budget films which are shot principally in
U - m atic or even VHS form at , although a few
are shot on Betacam or on the new
g e n e r ation of consumer-level digi t a l
c a m e r a s.The technical quality is often below
p a r , because most of the production staff,
especially the directors of photogr a p hy,
generally lack formal training. H owe ve r ,
w h at these productions lack in technical
quality and finesse they make up for in
astonishingly colourful story-telling and
popular appeal.As a result of successful mass
marketing techniques reminiscent of the
early days of Hollywo o d , N i g e ria has been
i n u n d ated with these productions.
According to the Nigerian Film Censors h i p
B o a r d , no fewer than 858 full-length video
films were released between December 1994
and May 1998.
Because this production is entirely
m a r k e t - d ri ve n , the films are closer to the
tastes of A f rican audiences than the va s t
m a j o rity of foreign-assisted films made in
francophone A f rican countri e s.The reasons
for this are clear: Who pays the piper calls

42 The UNESCO Courier - November 1998
Romance
African style
‘And then they got married and lived
happily ever after and were blessed
with lots of children. . . .” What could be
more universal than the denouement of
romantic novels, tales of love and luxury,
passionate affairs between tough guys and
tender women leading up to the inevitable
happy ending.
One need only browse through the
book section of any supermarket in the
Western world to get an idea of the fic t i o n a l
settings favoured by successful exponents
of this kind of literature such as Barbara
Cartland and the Spanish writer Corín
Te l l a d o :tropical para d i s e s,Alpine ski resorts,
Loire valley châteaux,mansions in European
principalities and beaches in California.
But in Adores, a series of novels with
an African background which has recently
been launched by the Côte d’Ivoire
publishing house Nouvelles Editions
Ivoiriennes (NEI), the characters eat manioc
or fried banana instead of caviar, d r i n k
ginger juice instead of champagne, a n d
instead of waltzing throw themselves into
the m a p o u k a, a dance that is all the rage in
Abidjan.
Series editor Méliane Boguifo, who is
also an official with the Côte d’Ivoire
ministry of education, explains that “ t h e
idea came from the observation that the
women of our country and African women
in general adore love stories from the We s t
and are as partial to them in book form as
in the cinema.We are now giving them an
opportunity to recognize themselves in an
African setting.”
Six books have been published so far,
including such evocative titles as C o e u r s
piégés ( “ Trapped Hearts”), C a c h e - c a c h e
d’amour (“Hide-and-Seek Love”) and U n
bonheur inattendu ( “ U n e x p e c t e d
H a p p i n e s s ” ) . As a result of several book-
signing sessions and a promotional
campaign on television and radio and in
the press, 36,000 copies were sold in two
months in Côte d’Ivoire and neighbouring
countries like Senegal and Benin.P u b l i s h e d
in French, the novels in the Adores series
cost 1,500 CFA francs ($2.5) at newsstands
and in bookshops. Their authors are well-
known writers who prefer to use
p s e u d o n y m s, or law and literature students
such as Guet Lydie and Koné Fibla. If the
example catches on in Asia,Latin America
and elsewhere, Barbara Cartland will have
to look to her laurels. n
the tune.
The content and style of foreign-assisted
films are often dictated by We s t e rn mov i e
c ritics or civil servants in the French Co-
o p e r ation Ministry.The success of the fil m s
depends on the reception they receive in
f e s t i vals and art house circuits in Europe,
r ather than on their popularity with A f ri c a n
a u d i e n c e s.The contents and style of video
m ov i e s , on the other hand, are necessari l y
dependent on mass audience tastes in A f ri c a
and are totally unsuitable for film festiva l s
and art house audiences. H o p e f u l l y,
h owe ve r , there will be a meeting point some
d ay between the need for quality and depth
and the quest for mass market appeal.
With the gr owing development of
d i gital television technology and the
concomitant fall in costs, it will soon be
possible for A f rican video products to be
remastered on 16 mm or 35 mm without
gr e at loss of quality and so become
available for cinema distribution. Meanwhile,
the availability of video projectors is begi n n i n g
to make possible a new type of distribution in
relatively small viewing centres.These movies
are also remarkably popular with Nigeri a n s
and Ghanaians in Europe and the United
S t at e s , suggesting that in the not-too-distant
future a market might emerge for distribution
by cable or satellite to these expat ri at e
communities.
There can be no doubt that video mov i e
production in countries like Nigeria and
Ghana represents an A f rican response 
to today ’s inform ation jungle. It is the response
of people who have chosen to car ve out their
own path,rather than wait for the ambiguous
b e n e fits of travelling along glistening
information highways in a manner scripted by
the powerful forces that currently dominat e
the world political and economic scene. n
n Attempts to describe today ’s global
c o m m u n i c ations landscape often
include glib references to inform at i o n
h i g h ways along which all humanity is
supposed to trave l , f o l l owing in the
footprints of the technologically advanced
n at i o n s. Time and again we are told that
the future lies in advanced technology per
s e , and not in the content of the products of
communication.
According to this viewpoint, everyone
should hook up to the Internet without
d e l ay and be inundated with messages
e m a n ating from web sites in the wo r l d ’s
major nations. It is also thought unseemly
for a country to try to protect its airspace
from being bombarded by sat e l l i t e
television broadcasts from powe r f u l
t r a n s n ational commercial conglomerat e s
and state-funded television concerns in
p a rts of the world that share the same basic
cultural,political and economic outlook.
Some A f rican gove rnments have been
unwise enough to sign agreements allow i n g
foreign state-funded radios to broadcast on
FM in their countri e s , thus unwittingly
c r e ating unfair competition for their ow n
local radio stat i o n s. S i m i l a r l y, most T h i r d
World television stations believe they are making
good use of the inform ation highway by accepting
v i rtually free satellite news coverage transmitted
worldwide by powerful ove rseas broadcasters.
Since they do not own satellites themselves and
often lack the financial means to send television
crews to cover events even in neighbouri n g
c o u n t ri e s , the exe c u t i ves of these television
s t ations are often only too willing to overlook the
political and cultural implications of continuously
relying on ove rseas sources. It may well be that
by agreeing to travel along the inform at i o n
h i g h way in a manner scripted in advance by
o t h e rs ,Third World decision-makers are exposing
the citizens of their countries to a new and
insidious form of colonizat i o n . From this
p e rs p e c t i ve , gifts of free television progr a m m e s
h ave a heavy cost.
The key to Third World participation in the
so-called inform ation highway lies in making
i m a gi n at i ve use of new forms of technology that
fall within their reach for the express goal of
s e rving their interests and needs. Against this
b a c k gr o u n d , the rapid gr owth of indigenous
m ovie production on video tape over the past
few years in a number of African countries may
be a step in the right direction. O. B.n

If you have a friend in Sydney,
Jo h a n n e s burg or Beijing and you have n ’t
spoken to them for a while, you will soon
h ave to think of a better excuse than “it costs
too much”. P rices of intern ational telephone
calls are plummeting. Before long, making a
call to the other side of the planet will cost as
much as it currently costs to call yo u r
n e i g h b o u r.
We are moving towards a distanceless,
borderless world where you will be able to
call anyo n e , almost anywhere for a few cents
or pennies. “The death of distance as a
d e t e rminant of the cost of communicat i n g
will probably be the single most import a n t
force shaping society in the first half of the
next century,” argues The Economist
m a g a z i n e .
There is a problem, t h o u g h . Amidst the
excitement and glamour generated by the
prospects of cheap calls, mobile phones and
the Intern e t , a quiet, poorly understood bu t
increasingly desperate struggle is being wa g e d
by some countries to adapt to the new
r e a l i t i e s.The process of change threatens to
c ripple the economies of these countri e s ,
mainly the poorest on the planet. T h e i r
problem is made wo rse by the fact that this
issue is mired in the tedious technicalities of
h ow telephone calls are charged and
accounted for.
When poverty
pays dividends
One reason why intern ational calls have
been so expensive is that many countri e s
h ave traditionally charged high prices for
completing the calls. Make a call from
Washington to Ja m a i c a , for example, a n d
the A m e rican telephone company has to
pay the telephone company in Jamaica to
connect the call,and that cost is passed on
to the person making the call.The system
which defines how much each company
pays each other company is known as the
international accounting rate system. It is
the result of bilateral agreements which
determine the price of the connexion and
the amount (usually 50 per cent of this
p rice) that a telephone company in country
X pays to its opposite number in country Y
for connecting the call (the settlement rat e ) .
In an ideal wo r l d , e ve ry country wo u l d
o ri gi n ate as many telephone calls as it
r e c e i ve s. H owe ve r , we live in an unequal
world and because most of their citizens are
poorer and have less developed telephone
s y s t e m s , nearly all developing countri e s
r e c e i ve more calls than they ori gi n at e .
Perhaps uniquely, in this instance pove rt y
p ay s. Most developing countries receive
much more money from intern at i o n a l
t e l ephone traffic than they pay out.

under the accounting rate system.”
M a ny developing countries have used the
system to charge high prices for completing
calls, arguing that they need the foreign
exchange to develop their own domestic
telephone systems.But now a combination of
technology, power politics and the harsh
competitive disciplines ushered in by the
global liberalized telecommunications
market place is likely to lead to a sudden and
potentially catastrophic fall in these reve n u e s ,
with unknown consequences for some
d e veloping economies and possibly for some
richer countries as we l l .
“If we don’t succeed in reaching an
a greement [on intern ational accounting
r at e s ] , in the next few ye a rs we will see
chaos and anarchy in telecommunications
and many people in the deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries will suffer tremendously,” a r g u e s
Pekka Tarjanne.“And so will customers in
the developed world.”
But the poorest countries are likely to
suffer most.“The least developed countri e s
and other low-income small economies with,
s ay, less than one million inhabitants, a r e
likely to be hardest hit,” by reform of the
system according to the Intern at i o n a l
Te l e c o m m u n i c ation Union. Ja m a i c a , f o r
example earns around $150 million a ye a r
from intern at i o n a l telephone calls.
“Reduction in . . . r ates will reduce this
i n flow, affecting the country ’s foreign
exchange and balance of trade,” s ays Cezley
Sampson of the Mona Institute of Business
Studies at the Unive rsity of the West Indies.
It will also lead to a wo rse telephone serv i c e
in the country, according to Ja m a i c a n
Ambassador A n t h o ny Hill. “ Too rapid a
reduction in settlement rates will lead to
substantial increases in local telephone
charges leading to significant serv i c e
d i s c o n n e c t i o n s ,” he say s.
W hy is the system falling apart? A major
reason is technology.The technical costs of
i n t e rn ational telecommunications are
p l u m m e t i n g .A single pair of optical fib r e s ,
each the thickness of a human hair, c a n
n ow carry all of North A m e ri c a ’s long
distance communications traffic. T h e
capacity of networks built with these fibres
is ten times that of networks built just a few
ye a rs ago. T h at means much lowe r
o p e r ating costs for companies—and thus
the opportunity to charge much lowe r
prices.
Te c h n o l o gical costs have fallen so
m u c h , according to the ITU, t h at “the cost
of an intern ational link is effectively close to
zero, [and] it could almost be dismissed as
h aving no bearing on the cost of an
i n t e rn ational call.” But while the cost of
calls placed through satellites or undersea
cables has been falling by as much as 30
per cent per year since the early 1990s,
according to the ITU, i n t e rn at i o n a l
accounting rates have been falling by only 9
per cent.
Technology is not the only fa c t o r ,
h owe ve r. Most people complain that
i n t e rn ational telephone calls still cost too
m u c h — but intern ational conglomerates and
m u l t i n ationals don’t just complain, t h e y
d e m a n d .Te l e c o m m u n i c ations is at the heart
of the modern global economy with tri l l i o n s
of dollars being traded over telephone wires
each ye a r , and the pressures to force pri c e s
d own are immense. This is a key reason
behind the increasing liberalization of
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations—and with it intense
competition between telephone companies.
Opening markets
to competition
In Fe b ru a ry this ye a r , 72 countri e s ,w h i c h
b e t ween them control 93 per cent of global
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations traffic, began to
implement a World Trade Organizat i o n

c o m p e t i t i o n . This has led to an orgy of
m e r g e rs between giant telecommunicat i o n s
c o m p a n i e s.With countries now opening their

impossible for developing countries to
continue to charge the prices they wa n t .
One country, h owe ve r , has decided that
it can wait no longer for reform .The United
S t ates is the big loser under the old
system—its companies run a deficit of
almost $6 billion a year in accounting rate
p ay m e n t s. The US has thus decided to
introduce its own pricing system which will
only allow US companies to pay companies
in other countries ve ry reduced prices to
complete intern ational calls.“[The existing
system] is an ancient, o u t m o d e d , p r o -

have fallen by 54.4% since 1993.
The decline in these countries contra s t s
with the vitality of daily newspapers in some
Southern countries where, d e s p i t e
c e n s o r s h i p, economic crisis and problems
of getting raw materials, sales have risen
over the same five-year period. Sales in
India have gone up by 47.2% and in Brazil
by 9%.
Other sources confirm the trend. Th e
latest UNESCO figures show that the
p e n e t ration of the daily press has increased
in almost every African country in this
p e r i o d . In A l g e r i a , the number of daily
papers available per 1,000 inhabitants rose
from 115 to 122 copies, in Nigeria from
1,700 to 1,950,in Côte d’Ivoire from 90 to
128 and in Ghana from 200 to 310.
Various surveys, including one by the
American firm Market Fa c t s, attribute the
drop in sales to the growth of the Internet,
but its direct impact has not yet been
demonstrated.The WNA says, for example,
that in the United Kingdom,the Internet is
more an extra than a replacement for the
written press.The same goes for the United
S t a t e s, where regular readers of on-line
news also consult other sources, such as
n e w s p a p e r s, radio and television, t o
supplement their information.
The main concern of editors right now
is how to attract young readers, who are
more drawn to a mouse and a screen than
to the printed word. n

has made a special study for the ITU on the
impact of accounting rate reductions on
C o l o m b i a . “Accounting rates set at the FCC
benchmarks would have ve ry severe negat i ve
impact on the Colombian telecommunicat i o n s
sector—in fact Colombian operat o rs would lose
money on eve ry call,” he say s.The FCC disagr e e s
with his analysis.
Some have even accused the US of a new form
of colonialism in its accounting rate policy.
“ H i s t o ri c a l l y, the US has refused to be regulat e d
by the ITU and when not able to get its own way
within the ITU has resorted to intern at i o n a l i z i n g
its own domestic law,” s ays Professor Jill Hills of
the Intern ational Institute of Telecoms Regulat o rs
in London.“The FCC’s threat to withdraw from
the ITU’s system of accounting rates follows this
t r a d i t i o n ,” she argues.
H owe ve r , it is widely accepted that the
c u rrent system needs radical reform . In 1992,
for example, the ITU adopted a resolution
calling for settlement payments to reflect the real
costs of completing calls.
The technological and economic changes
sweeping the telecommunications industry offer
huge new opportunities for many developing
c o u n t ries to “ l e a p f r o g ” the older industrial powe rs.
Instead of having to invest billions in digging
trenches to bu ry cables, as the industrial powe rs
have done, liberalization can potentially help
mobilize massive foreign investment to create
n at i o n - w i d e ,s t ate of the art ,d i gital networks based
on mobile telecommunications and optic fib r e s.
The bottom line, though,is that at a critical
moment in their economic development, some
of the world’s poorest countries find themselves
with a huge economic handicap in the
telecommunications race. If nothing is done to
help them, this handicap could last for a
generation. n

M i ra Nair:
46 The UNESCO Courier - November 1998
T A L K I N G  T O …
One of India’s most celebrated and controversial
film-makers is driven by an obsession with creative
freedom
You were born in India, studied in the
United States and now live in South Africa.
Where is home?
I left India when I was eighteen ye a rs
old and then divided my time between the
United States and India for about ten ye a rs
before meeting my husband in Kampala,
Uganda, during the shooting of Mississippi
Masala. Now we have been living in South
Africa for the last two years. I travel a lot
due to professional reasons but I make my
home where the family is, where my
husband and child are.
Why did you decide to go into cinema?
Your films seem fired by a strong sense of
social justice.
I was not one of those people who knew
they would be making films from the age of
eight. I fell into cinema, and then became
possessed by it. I started as an actor,
committed to fairly radical experi m e n t a l
t h e at r e , street protest theatre and relat e d
t h i n g s. I was also a good student, a n d
suffered under the illusion I might have
become an academic. I received a full
s c h o l a rship to study at Harvard Unive rs i t y
when I was eighteen and went to purs u e
my interest in theat r e . But once there, I felt
the theatre at the unive rsity was too
conventional, too staid,compared to what
I had done in India. I also grew impatient
with the lack of control one has an actor.
Actors are always at the mercy of directors
and their vision of the wo r l d . I wanted to be
the one in control—telling the story,
controling the light, the gesture and the
frame. Creative freedom is imperative for
me.
Making independent films is an
o b s e s s i ve task—having an idea, w riting the
s c ri p t , finding fin a n c e , c a s t i n g, s h o o t i n g
and editing. Then comes the big stru g g l e
to make sure the film is distri bu t e d
throughout the wo r l d . All of this could
easily take one or two ye a rs. In order to live
with a project eve ry day for two ye a rs I have
to be obsessed by it.I can only make films
about subjects that get under my skin and
make my heart beat faster. I am not in the
business of producing films which offer a
pleasant way of filling a Sunday afternoon.
T h at is for others to do, and I don’t dismiss
i t . But I am attracted to ideas that will
provoke people and make them look at the
world a little differently—stories that come
from my part of the world.
I do have a pri vate agenda, I suppose, t o
resist the cultural imperialism of
H o l l y wood by putting people like ours e l ve s
on screen. It is an enormous validation to
see people on screen who look like us in
India or elsewhere in the South. We must
tell our own stori e s , because nobody else
is going to do it for us. I must say I enjoy the
responsibility of exploring and portraying
these stories through fil m - m a k i n g .After all,
fil m , unlike academia, reaches millions.
This is another dimension of my wo r k
which I really enjoy—the ability to reach
so many people. Yet at the same time, I
d o n ’t forget or underestimate the individual
viewer in the audience.
Why focus on communities and individuals
living in exile and what have you learned
about cultural identity and racism? Why do
Indian communities in exile, for example,
feel the need to keep to the fringes of
society?
I seem to be getting some sort of
reputation for making films about exile. I
d i d n ’t choose this, it chose me. D i s t a n c e
from a community is something which used
to confuse me but now I use it as a tool for
my films.
I suppose I understand that state of
b e i n g, and know what it feels like to look
outside a motel window in Mississippi and
see my garden in Kampala. You can fin d
yo u rself on the other side of the world and
yet still find a reminder or link to home.Ye t
I don’t suffer from nostalgia or
h o m e s i c k n e s s. I think of myself as someone
with a huge appetite for the world and as a
gr e at lover of people. I find this gr e at
commonality between people.Yet ignorance
and fear—the two hallmarks of racism—
blind us to it.
W h at was especially moving about
being in Mississippi to shoot my film was
t h at I found black families—with their
closeness and church and singing and
b a r b e c u e s — were actually so much like the
Indian families that seemed so remove d
from that community even though they
l i ved just across the highway. The Indian
community was doing the same things,
believing in similar values to those of the
black community.Yet the Indians imagi n e d
the blacks to be not quite as human or the
same as them.
Indian communities living abroad form
their own circle, perhaps to maintain a
c e rtain cultural and sometimes religi o u s
p u ri t y. In the process, they become more
frozen in their “ I n d i a n n e s s ” than those
living in India. By doing so, they also
s y s t e m atically exclude themselves from
i n t e gr ation with the local communities.
When I went to Kampala to make
Mississippi Masala, some Indians we r e
s u rp rised to see that I am not as “ I n d i a n ”a s
they expected.
Your films explore paradoxes by 
showing how, for example, the slave
becomes the master. Wh e re does this
insight come from? Do you draw on your
observation skills as a documentary 
fil m - m a ker or on your intuition?
I have an eye and ear for paradox.That
is life.The grey area where no one person is
less or more virtuous than the other. Fo r
me the truth is far more interesting, fa r
more strange,than fiction.
This is where cultural specificity comes
i n . You do extensive research about a
theme, feel it and then create a story that
I can only make films
about subjects that get
under my skin and make my
heart beat faster

could become unive rs a l . Ty r a n ny is the
absence of complexity, as Gide said. A n d
complexity is interesting to explore in film
instead of constantly looking for the lowe s t
common denominat o r. I believe in
i n t u i t i o n . I follow my intuition absolutely in
finding and developing stories to tell. For
m e , there are subjects which just seem
obvious to explore. For example, I once
made a documentary called Children of
Desired Sex, an Indian euphemism for
people wanting only male children, t h e
desired sex. The documentary set out to
explore how amniocentesis,the procedure
i nvented to test the genetic balance of a
c h i l d , was being abused in a horri fic
manner in India as a test for women to
ascertain the sex of their unborn child. If
the foetus was female,they would abort.
Mississippi Masala: an Indian family migrates to the United States.
The censorship problems
aside, I do believe that
women film-makers have
access to some people and
subjects which men do not
But finding a subject is not enough.T h e
trick is to create a work situation in which
intuition is allowed to reign.
Many people who spend years abroad
benefit from a certain distance when
returning to their countries of origin.
They are able to critically observe their
native societies, without necessarily
passing judgment. Perhaps this distance
helps to explain the clarity in films like
Salaam Bombay! Yet it may also bring you
opposition. How do you respond to
accusations that you are trying to sell
India’s poverty? 
I choose subjects which touch me. I am
not the first one to be accused of selling
I n d i a ’s pove rt y. The gove rnment accused
e ven the renowned film-maker Sat yajit Ray
of the same thing. After seeing S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! I don’t think anybody can say that
it is a film that gr atuitously shows the
depression and misery in India.The mov i e
c e l e b r ates the surv i val of the human being in
the face of all the odds. In day to day life, a n
individual does not notice such things.A l s o,
m a ny of us in our lives—instead of coping
with the inequities of existence here—
become blind and numb.Yet looking away
from reality does not make it disappear.
The same thing happened with K a m a
S u t ra. I didn’t hide sexuality behind veils or
d a n c e s. Indian commercial films are alway s
filled with sexual innuendoes and obscene
songs about “ w h at is under the blouse”. I n
fa c t , sexuality in Indian cinema is cloaked
in rape and violence. In my fil m , I wa s n ’t
t rying to shock but tell the story straight,
without hiding behind illusions or pretence.
The irony is that we come from a culture
which had regarded love and sexuality as a
link to the divine. It was an art to be learn e d
and yet to be treated as a matter of fa c t .
Do you think Kama Sutra generated
even more controversy because
it was made by a woman? What
possibilities or pitfalls face a female 
film-maker?
Films port r aying sexual subjects are
bound to attract problems with the censors.
But you cannot imagine the troubles that lie
in wait if a woman director attempts to
focus on them. Before making the fil m ,
e ve ryone told me that I would have
problems but I never imagined that I wo u l d
be dragged through the courts for almost
two years! After going through all kinds of
legal battles with the Indian censors h i p
board and gove rn m e n t , I knew that the
attacks were particularly vehement because
I am a woman.
The censorship problems aside, I do
b e l i e ve that women fil m - m a k e rs have
access to some people and subjects which
men do not. For example while making my
film India Cabaret which dealt with the live s
of female stripteasers in Bombay, I could
enter their lives in a rather comprehensive
way. I even managed to visit the houses of
the men who frequented these cabaret
joints and talk to their wives.
Kama Sutra felt like an experiment. Was it
an attempt to shift from being a
documentary film-maker to being an art
film-maker?
While I was working in documentary I

T A L K I N G  T O …
The ‘tough sister’
nMira Nair took the film world by storm
with her first feat u r e , Salaam Bombay !, i n
1 9 8 8 . Coming from a country which
produces more feature films than any other,
she proved that even art movies can be
commercially successful. Her film career,
which started in 1979, has brought her
global accolades and at the same time fie r c e
criticism at home.
The youngest of the three children of a
civil serva n t , Nair was born in 1957 in the
city of Bhubaneshwar in eastern India.
Although watching movies at the local
cinema was one of her early interests she wa s
p a rticularly captivated by theat r e , which she
studied (along with sociology) at the
U n i ve rsity of Delhi. In Delhi she became
i nvo l ved in political street theatre and
p e r f o rmed for three ye a rs in an amat e u r
drama company before setting out for the
United States on a fellowship in 1976 to
study drama.
Disillusioned with the conservat i ve
theatre programme at Harvard University,
she was soon drawn to documentary film-
m a k i n g . Her decision gave her the
o p p o rtunity to work with three leading
fil m - m a k e rs , Alfred Guzzeti, R i c h a r d
Leacock and  D. A .Pe n n e b a k e r. S e ven ye a rs
after gr a d u ating she had made four
documentaries exploring ‘‘the culture and
traditions of India and their impact on the
lives of ordinary people.’’
G r e atest recognition came with S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! a film which, she say s , ‘‘ p o rt r aye d
the reality of children who are denied a
c h i l d h o o d , children who surv i ve on the
streets with resilience, h u m o u r , fla m b oya n c e
and dignity.’’ Before shooting, Nair and her
s c ri p t w ri t e r , Sooni Ta r a p o r e va l a , a college
f riend and a nat i ve of Bombay, conducted a
three-month workshop with 30 street
c h i l d r e n , all of whom then performed in the
f e ature fil m . Salaam Bombay! won 23
i n t e rn ational awards including the Caméra
d’Or and the Prix du Public at the 1989
Cannes Film Fe s t i va l . In the same year it
r e c e i ved an A c a d e my award nomination as
Best Foreign Language Film. Nair is proud
of it. ‘‘Especially for our children and for
I n d i a , since it’s the first nomination we ’ ve
had since 1957, the year I was born .’’
The “ Kuskoo Didi” (tough sister), a s
the street children called her, made sure
they get long-term benefit from S a l a a m
B o m b ay ! She put the bulk of their salaries in
a bank account,and with some of the fil m ’s
profits she and her colleagues established
“Salaam Balak Tru s t ” , a non-profit
o r g a n i z ation that provides homeless
children with educat i o n a l , medical and
vocational services.
After making Kama Sutra :A Tale of Love
( 1 9 9 7 ) , she battled with the Indian censors
for eighteen months before it could be
released and shown in cinema halls across
the country. ‘‘The censor board wanted to
cut out eve rything vaguely sexual, cut it
beyond recognition.I had to go all the way
to the Supreme Court of India to release
my film.’’
Nair now lives in Cape Town (South
A f rica) with her husband Mahmood
M a m d a n i , a political scientist, and their
young son Zohran. Her interest in the
themes of identity, culture and exile
c o n t i n u e s. Faithful to her own pers o n a l
tradition she is currently preparing for yet
another trans-continental move. n

Filmography 
Nair’s key productions:
My Own Country (1998): The story of an
Ethiopian-born Indian doctor treating A i d s
and HIV patients in eastern Tennessee in the
mid-1980s comes to realize that the
epidemic is a spiritual as well as a medical
emergency.
Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love ( 1 9 9 7 ) : A
sumptuous exploration of the friendship and
r i valry between a princess and her serva n t
in a 16th-century Indian court.Both use the
teachings of the Kama Sutra, an ancient
treatise on love and sexuality, as weapons
in their complex relations and the men in
their lives.
The Perez Family (1995):Romantic tragi-
comedy about the Mariel boat people who
left Cuba for Miami,USA,in 1980.
The Day the Mercedes became a Hat
( 1 9 9 3 ) : Short video made in South Africa and
inspired by the assassination of Chris Hani,
leader of the South African Communist Pa r t y.
Mississippi Masala ( 1 9 9 0 ) : Story of an
Indian family expelled from Uganda in 1972
under Idi Amin before managing a motel in
small-town Mississippi, U S A .C u l t u ral worlds
collide when the daughter falls in love with
a black man.
Salaam Bombay! ( 1 9 8 8 ) : The director’s
first feature film is also her most famous.
Detailing the lives of Bombay’s street
children,the film was shot on location with
only a handful of professional actors. Most of
the characters were portrayed by children
living on the streets, including Chaipu who
played the lead.
Documentaries include:
Children of a Desired Sex ( 1 9 8 7 ) :
explores the conflicts facing pregnant
women who decide to undergo abortions
after learning that they bear female foetuses.
India Cabaret ( 1 9 8 5 ) : a portra yal of the
lives of female strippers in a seedy Bombay
nightclub.
So Far From India (1982): examines the
s e p a ration between an Indian newspaper
seller living in New York City and his wife
and child who live in India.
Jama Masjid Street Journal ( 1 9 7 9 ) :
N a i r ’s first film was part of her student thesis
project and draws on her personal
experience of exploring life within a
t raditional Muslim community in Old Delhi
from the perspective of a Western-educated
Indian woman.
often became impatient when I had to wa i t
for something to happen and then not
h aving it happen like I hoped it wo u l d . I
wanted to have a lot more control ove r
gesture and drama. So I shifted to feature
films.The challenge in a feature film is to
capture the sense of the instantaneous
moment of a documentary. D o c u m e n t a ri e s
h ave a certain edge as events seem to unroll
before the camera. This is difficult to
convey in the controlled environment of a
feature film.
My gr e atest challenge in Kama Sutra
was to be faithful to myself and to make a
film about strong women who are not afraid
to celebrate their sexuality and have found a
way to love fully. Another challenge was to
c r e ate a world that felt real. Not to creat e
one mired in exotica and anthropology, bu t
one that felt so local that it became unive rs a l .
I wanted to address the lack of
u n d e rstanding or thought about what is
genuinely Eros and how we should be
prepared to handle Love . I think I succeeded
in showing how Eros perm e ates eve ry d ay
l i f e .
The film is not targeted at any
p a rticular audience. I t ’s for the wo r l d .
Perhaps this ambitious goal proved to be a
problem for me, but it was a good lesson.
Although I achieved what I wanted to in
the visual and sensual qualities of K a m a
Sutra,I felt that the story suffered.
Film-making is a journ e y, like any other
work of art.You make films and hope that
the end product is what you wa n t e d .
Sometimes you achieve that and sometimes
you end up with something different.
How did Indian women viewers respond to
Kama Sutra?
When the movie was released in India
last year I made contractual obligat i o n s
with the distributors that there should be
m atinee screenings thrice a week for
women only. In Indian cinemas, 90 per cent
of the audience are men. I did not want my
female audience to be harassed or
i n t i m i d ated by men’s presence, so I insisted
on these all-women screenings. It made
women feel safer and made it easier to see
my message.
It is a myth that Indian women do not
want to know about intimate love. In fact,
the film was a gr e at hit and wo m e n
frequented the theatres all over the country.
It was among the top three commercially
successful movies in India last year.
How do you find finance in a developing
country where there is hardly any support
for art movies?
I am lucky that my films actually make
money for those who invest in them. For me the
most important thing is to have complete
independence while making a mov i e .Yet it is
ve ry difficult to find finance for my kind of wo r k
in India. T h at ’s why I rely on a mix of
i n t e rn ational distri bu t o rs , mostly from Ja p a n ,
Europe and some in India. I don’t take the whole
sum from one person or company because that
would invo l ve a lot of constraints and
d e p e n d e n c e . I would have to make a mov i e
according to the needs and interests of the
financier instead of making a film that is mine. I
think you have much more freedom with $6
million raised independently than $50 million
from a single studio.
Do you consider film-making to be a cultural
industry or an art form justifying and requiring
state support?
As an art form , films do need support . Fo r
e x a m p l e , it would not have been possible for me
to make my first feature film without support
from India’s National Film Deve l o p m e n t
C o rp o r at i o n .We get to see lots of good mov i e s
from Australia where the state supports the
i n d u s t ry. Ideally speaking, a movie should be able
to support itself,but I still believe in some form of
assistance or subsidies, especially for first fil m s.
India produces the largest number of commercial
films in the world, with 
its own version of Hollywood referred 
to as Bollywood (Bombay). Yet the 
country fails to produce good art film directors.
Why? 
I wo u l d n ’t say that Indian directors lack
talent. It is simply that they lack opportunities.
Basically you have to struggle for yo u rself to fin d
finance for your movies in India. Unless the
financier is sure about making profit s , he will
not support the project. Second, there is a big
problem in distri buting fil m s. I know many cases
where movies are made but never seen because
there aren’t any distri bu t o rs for art fil m s. I t ’s not
t h at Indian audiences aren’t interested in seeing
independent films.The problem lies in the lack
of theatres committed to showing them.
What next?
I am now working on a movie called B o m b ay
2 0 0 0, which I suppose I could call my firs t
B o l l y wood fil m , but on my own term s. I t ’s about
a city going global, about the relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween a mother and daughter and an
A m e rican hustler who enters their live s. T h e
mother was a legendary film actress in the old
B o l l y wood and now dubs Bay watch [an
American television series] into Hindi.And her
daughter is a starlet in current super-slick
Bollywood films. n

before seen in human history,and what e ve r
the C o u ri e r can contri bute to progress in

2 No more change,
please
The C o u ri e r has been a gr e at help to me and
my students . . . I suggest that the magazine
should not change its present content and
presentation, because it has a universal
approach enabling it to handle topics in a
wide range of fields in a clear and simple way,
backed up by photos and facts and fig u r e s.

2 From words to action
In my country it is not easy to get hold of
the UN E S C O C o u ri e r, and consequently I
hand on my copies to my local library.
I would like to suggest that you launch
a feature cove ring UN E S C O’s work and way s
in which people can take part in it. . . . I
think it is essential for young people to be
involved in the Organization’s work.

2 What’s in a name?
When I received the new C o u ri e r I didn’t
notice any radical change.The only thing
t h at surp rised me at first is that the order of
words in the title has changed. Instead of
The UN E S C O C o u ri e r it seems to have
become UNESCO, the Courier.
Kheïra Brahim

2 Recycled paper
I like the new form at of the UN E S C O
Courier.The magazine is very informative.
Since UN E S C O is focused on env i r o n m e n t a l
i s s u e s , do you use recycled paper to
produce the magazine?

In spite of the high cost and inferior
quality of printing on recycled paper, we
hope to be using it as soon as possible.
