Poverty, sickness and ignorance-three of humanity's afflictions which a universal respect for Human Rights
would help to mitigate-are eloquently portrayed in this charcoal sketch by Helen Lempriere, the Austraiian artist.
A CHILD'S GUIDE TO HUMAN
RIGHTS
Dorothy Canfield Fisher, the well-
known American writer, recently
undertook what she called"an alarm-
tingly important task"-that of
putting the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights into words that a child
can understand and remember
The result is a profusely illustrated
160-page book, whose title, A fair
world for all., is in itself an admirable
summing up of the Declaration. To
produce this work, Mrs. Fisher studied
all the official records of the United
Nations on the Declaration. Then,
for her young readers, she wrote these
words :
"It was as though all the delegates
to the United Nations stood up and
called to the enormous crowd of
human beings all around the globe :
'Everyone, no matter what race, come
on out into your fair share of freedom,
as big a share as anybody. It doesn't
make any difference what colour you
are... Women, too, have the right to
be as free as any grown-up'".
Article 5 of the Declaration (No one
shall be subjected to torture or to

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment

by infiicting great pain on them or

Article 17 (everyone has the right
to own property alone as well as in

twist that will appeal to every child :
"At school there are things that you

push a schoolmate out of the swing, if
you never give him a chance to
throw his ball on the playground,
you're taking away from him some-
thing he has as much right to as to

Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.

### 71149: The Road to universal human rights

COURIER
THE ROAD
NOVEMBER 1952. Pe3
TO UNIVERSAL
HUMAN RIGHTS
By Alexandre Leventis
o many people, the four years since December 10,
1948, when the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights'was adopted and proclaimed by the General
Assembly of the United Nations, seem too short a
period to judge its full significance. Yet, even the
opening words of the Declaration, recognizing
"the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable
rights of at), members of the human family"leave
no doubt as to its capital importance.
Those who today enjoy the fundamental rights
of equality and freedom tend to regard this prin-11_-__1_____1 11."'-mL__-----_. t. L-. J ! _--_. L 1...-.. 1. 1-. 1. 1...-
ciple as a perfectly natural thing. They are apt to forget both the
recent lessons of history and the examples of past centuries, during
which men fought to win recognition of this principle, and resisted
the tyranny and oppression responsible for individual and collective
crimes against humanity.
The modern conception of Human Rights is the fruit of a long
evolution in human customs, outlook and la\v which finally broke
down outmoded doctrines of absolutism and feudalism. Yet the idea
itself is by no means new. If we look back over the centuries, we find
it set forth in the texts of constitutions, expouaded in the speeches of
politicians, expressed in the'wisdom of Hindu and Chinese philosophy,
and recorded in the writings of religious leaders.
One of the greatest of ancient historians, Thucydides, has re-
corded for posterity the famous oration of Pericles, in which the atter
expounded the conception of Human Rights in the Athenian demo-
cracy :"Its administration favours the many, instead of the few ; that
is why it is called a democracy. The laws afford equal justice to all
in their private differences. Advancement falls to reputation for capa-
city, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit.
Poverty does not bar the way ; if a man is able to serve the tate, he
is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition."
In particular, Thucydides quotes an admirable maxim :"Freedom
is identical witch happiness, courage identical'with freedom :'
Such Human Rights principles'are expressed in Roman philo-
sophy which, despite the acceptance of slavery, can record Seneca's
Homo res sacra homini (Man is sacred to man). They are also to be
found in the spiritual'theories of Buddhism, the political wisdom of
the disciples of Confucius, the Islamic precept pf human brotherhood,
the ethics of Judaism, the equalitarianism of Christianity, quotations
from the writer of the Reformation and the 17th century, and in the
clarion call of the 18th century, with its humanitarian philosophy and
optimism which engendered a po'werful upsurge of international
progress and freedom.
Human Rights have been included in the charters and consti-
tutions which, in the various countries where they were promulgated,
won for men some of the rights that are now proclaimed in the Uni-
versal Declaration of 1948. Among the oldest of these documents is
the Magna Carta of 1215, but the ones which exerted the most wide-
spread influence were the French Declaration of the Rights of Man
and Citizen, promulgated in 1789, and America's Declaration of Inde-
pendance and Bills of Rights, which preceded it by several years.
Yet, none of these declarations was expressing new ideas. As
the historian Georges Jellinek has remarked,"The number of new
political ideas is very small ; most of them can be trac'ed back, at least
in essence, to the most ancient formulae of public law. This, however,
is not true of political institutions,'which are perpetually changing."
But both the French and American Revolution elaborated new
conceptions of public law, and left a profound mark on all political
changes which came in their train.'
In the American declarations, however, the rights defined were
not traditional and historical. Instead, they were abstract and rooted
in human psychology. Their wording was drawn from the voca-
bulary of the humanitarian philosophy of the age :"inalienable rights",
"pursuit of happiness","resistance to oppression."
Inspired by the doctrines of the Church, the theories of Locke, the
works of Rousseau, natural law and the Cohtrat Social, the American
Bills of Rights,'were, like the French Declaration, the product of the
intellectual climate of the 18th century, which was essentially inter-
national in character.
It is interesting to recall that the authors of the French Declaration
of the Rights of Man readily admitted that their text'was based on
the American models. The Archbishop of Bordeaux, Comte Jerome-
Marie Champion de Cice, declared in 1789 :
"It was fitting that it should be to our soil that this noble idea.
conceived in another hemisphere, should first be transplanted. We
contributed towards the events whereby North America'won her
freedom. America in her turn shows us the principles whereon to
base the preservation of our own."
Nevertheless, the French declaration of the Rights of Man and of
the Citizen cannot be regarded as a free translation of the American
ones, but an interpretation of them ; and it was this declaration drafted
in French-a universal language of the i8th century-that let loose
the humanitarian wave which swept across Europe, then to Latin-
America and finally around the world. Everywhere the French text
was imitated, consulted, adopted.
The Declaration of 1789 is not, however, a unique example of the
irresistible spread of humanitarian ideas. There was, for instance,
the Constitution of Cadiz, which, until 1830, was the prototype of
liberal constitutions in southern Europe. From then until the end of
the 19th century, the Belgian constitution of 1831 served as a model
and an example in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Naples, Rome, Piedmont,
Rumania, Serbia, Bulgaria and Egypt.
If, after the efforts of ancient days and the achievements of more
modern times, the struggles of the 19th and 20th centuries did not
bring new rights, they did at least usher in new hopes : protection of
the family and of children, equality of the sexes, the assurance of rest
and leisure, and a standard of living adequate to health and well-
being. Alongside the traditional freedoms has appeared the concep-
tion of economic and social rights, some of which have already become
realities.
But despite the humanitarian character of the many declarations,
charters and constitutions, and their broad framework which has made
possible their adoption without major modification in many countries,
they retain an undeniably national quality. In this they differ from
the Universal Declaration of 1948, which, for the first time, brought the
fight for Human Rights on an international basis.
The Universal Declaration applies to all human beings"without
distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property or other
status."It is not designed to protect any one individual or group, any
one nation or group of nations, but fixes a common standard of
achievement for all peoples.
The Universal Declaration, which is the result of two years of
laborious study and discussion, could hardly be described as a spon-
taneous event. It is expressive of our time, for it voices the revolt of
mankind's conscience against bal'bnl'ous acts committed during a world
war which brought suffering and oppression to many peoples.
Recognition of the difficulties encountered in reaching agreement
on the terms of the Declaration can only help to enhance its value. For
this was no document blithely adopted in a surge of blind enthusiasm,
but a charter, each of whose words was carefully weighed. To reach
agreement on matters involving material interests alone is often difficult
enough, yet how much more so when it is a question of principles !
A witty reference to such difficulties is made by Jacques Maritain
in his introduction to a Unesco collection of essays on Human Rights.
"It is related", he writes,"that at one of the meetings of a Unesco
National Commission,'where Human Rights were being discussed,
someone expressed astonishment that certain champions of violently
opposed ideologies had agreed on a list of those rights.'Yes,'they said,
'we agree about the rights, but on condition that no one asks us'why'.
That'why'is where the argument begins.'"
But, as Richard McKeon has pointed out in the same collection :
"The fundamental problem is not found in compiling a list of Human
Rights ; the declarations of Human Rights that have been prepared by
committees and groups who have undertaken a study of the problem
and the declarations that have been submitted to the Commission on
Human Rights are surprisingly similar.
"The differences are found rather in what is meant by these rights,
and these differences of meanings depend on divergent basic assump-
tions, which in turn lend plausibility to, and are justified by, contradic-
tory interpretations of the economic and social situation."
Those who, on the basis of some of the things happening in the
world today, attack the Universal Declaration, by declaring that it is
no more than a pious hope, commit a grave injustice and mistake. The
Declaration was never conceived as a code which would abrogate,
modify or replace the laws of each country. In its preamble, without
any ambiguity, It lays down standards which will be
applied once new measures have been adopted on a
national or international basis.
tonhnucd
on next page.
There was nothing surprising about this, for, as Joseph Barnave,
a member of the Constituent Assembly, had said :"The Declaration of
Rights must be simple and comprehensible to all ; it must become our
national catechism."
Just before the final text ways adopted,"a remarkable, almost
inconceivable, situation arose,"the historian Alphonse Aulard tells us.
"The'1, 200 deputies, who had been unable, while working indi-
vidualfy or in small groups, to arrive at any brief or clear formulae,
succeeded in the tumult of public discussion in elaborating a concise
and inspiring text.
"The Declaration of Rights was completed'within a single week
by dint of improvized oral amendments. It was as though the entire
nation, spontaneously imposing its will, was dictating to its repre-
sentatives the words of the Declaration."
It is not straying from the subject of Human Rights to recall that
a year later this Constituent Assembly promulgated the famous decree
which represents the first constitutional renunciation of aggressive
war."The French nation undertakes never to embark on any war
for conquest, and never to employ force against the freedom of any
people."
Underlying this was the conception of the"just war,"which was
taken up by the United Nations as the basis of collective security.

In other words, it cannot make its full impact
until its principles have been embodied in a
covenant under which nations will undertake
formally to apply Human Rights, and after
arrangements have been made for the United
Nations to supervise and, if necessary, to
impose, the application of these rights.
This was emphasized by Professor Boris
Mirkine-Guetzevitch", when he wrote :"'It is
important not to underestimate the opposition,
caution and hostility which new principles of
freedom and Human Rights almost always
encounter. Human Rights cannot be imposed
all at once-years, sometimes several decades,
must elapse before the principles proclaimed
can be embodied in constitutional texts. Nor
does the mere fact that Human Rights have
been proclaimed and inscribed in constitutions
mean that they will automatically be observed."
In the four years which have passed since
the adoption of the 1948 Declaration, men have
still fought one another, and all mankind has
lived in the shadow of war, and the fear of
very real threats to freedom. Yet, while
admitting a decline of Human Rights, there is
certainly no reason for despair and apathy.
On the contrary, the moment to proclaim
fundamental freedoms with renewed vigour is
when they are most gravely threatened. It is
because these freedoms are denied to millions
of human beings that they must be defended
and extended.
The greatest enemy of Human Rights is
man himself. Those who live under a tyranny
can do no more than give vent to their despair,
while those who enjoy these rights are perhaps
over-inclined to take them for granted-like
someone who recently declared :"Human
Rights are so much a part and parcel of our
lives that we find it difficult to imagine that
they could not exist !"
Yet it is not because all men are not yet
ready to offer each other the hand of
friendship that no hands should be out-
stretched.
"In the midst of all our miseries and all
the injustices committed or suffered, we must
have faith in human nature,"Jean Jaures
wrote in his Address to Youth."He who has
lost the sense of grandeur and infinite poten-
tialities of mankind is self-condemned never
to understand his fellow men.
"Such faith is neither stupid nor super-
ficial. It is fully a'ware of all the vices,
crimes, errors, prejudices and egoisms-the
egoism of individuals, the egoism of castes,
the egoism of parties and the egoism of
classes, which hamper progress and frequently
turn the river of life into a muddy, troubled
torrent. And it is aware that the forces of
good, of wisdom and light and justice need the
help of time, and that the night of slavery and
ignorance cannot be dispersed by a sudden
flash of light, but only by a long series of
flickering dawns."
Unesco is working to end this"night of
slavery and ignorance."Its programme con-
stitutes in itself a roll-call of the fundamental
rights of man, and its work is aimed at their
realization.
Unesco's programme of fundamental
education aims to help the people of under-
developed countries to raise their standards
of living and to solve their economic and
social problems. It is also \working to bring
about the universal application of free and
compulsory primary education. It is fostering
the access of women to education, the freedom
of artists, the free flow of cultural material.
In fact, every aspect of Unesco's programme
is linked'with one or other of the rights pro-
claimed in the Universal Declaration.
It is Unesco's effort in favour of Human
Rights, in close co-operation with the other
Specialized Agencies of the United Nations,
that forms the theme of this issue of the
Courier.
THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION
I
The flags of many countries
flank the main entrance to
Unesco's Patzcuaro centre.
"I M  G I. N Et you're in a
car hurrying
along the
magnificent road
which rolls north-
westwardly from
Mexico City over
mountain ranges,
through pine forests
which remind you
of Switzertand,
one-street villages of
mudbrick houses with
wide shadowed eaves,
dusty streets where
pigs and fowl wander.... 0
donkeys amble along under enormous loads
"Men in wide-brimmed straw hats are squatting in
doorways, women in colourful scarves are chatting in
groups, and over all 011 intense magical light-pours out of
a hot blue sky.
"We have three companions, all Latin American, two
men and a girl. The girl, called Conchita, s ! im, dark-
haired and vivacious, is from Ecuador. One man, Jose, is
a Mexican, a health expert. The other, Alfredo, an agri-
cultural student, comes from Guatemo) a.
"They are all young and high-spirited, and as we drive
along they occasionally break into song-for preference,
one caNed'La Pacanda,'which is named after an island
in Lake P6tzcuaro."
In these words, Leonard Cottrell, a B. B. C. features pro-
ducer who was invited by Unesco to visit its Fundamental
Education Centre in Pdtzcuoro, describes his arrival at
this small Mexican town.
Conchita, José and Alfredo are students at this inter-
national centre, which also has people from Peru, Uruguay,
EI Satvador, Haiti-in fact, from no fewer than 16 Latin
American countries. They have all come to PátzcuarcÍ to
study Fundamental Education methods, so that when they
return to their own countries they can train other special-
ists in this work.
The first people Cottrell saw in Pátzcuaro were three
boys, in black jackets with silver braid, who came over
to their car and, accompanied by a guitar, song"Flor de
orquida,"0 love song whose title means'''little orchid
flower."
"they made the guitars themselves,"Alfredo explained.
"The Taroscans are wonderful instrument makers, and in
fact, an amazing people."
Cottrell's reaction to this remark rather surprised his
companions. *'As they seem happy enough, why have you
people got to spoil it all by educating them ?", he asked.
"We're not educating them in the sense that you mean
- academically,"Alfredo said."The only way to under-
stand is for you to come out to the villages with us."
Leonard Cottrell had heard about Fundamental Educa-
tion, the main aim of which is to help people to under-
stand the problems that affect them directly and then
give them the means of solving these problems through
their own efforts.
It is an emergency method brought out by Unesco to
give the millions of people who live in under--developed
parts of the world the minimum of instruction which they
need to improve their living conditions, their health, and
their social and economic life.alfred, Conchita and José had explained that the
students at the Centre used the Torascans as 'subjects"
in their experiments. The Torascans, who formed the
majority of the population of the region, were beset by a
number of related problems-malnutrition, poor soil,
disease and illiteracy. The Centre's activities fit into a
Mexican Government campaign to raise living standards
around Lake Pdtzcuaro.
The director of the Centre, in explaining to Cottrell that
the training given at the Centre (which is called CREFAL
- initials for Centro Regional de Educacián Fundamental
para America Latin) stressed the fact that it was useless
teaching people to read and write unless they had the
incentive to learn and use this knowledge.
That was why the students-like Conchita, José and
Alfredo-in addition to following the theoretical and
practical courses given by the specialists at the Centre,
also went out into the Tarascan villages to teach not only
the ABC and writing, but also things that affected every-
day life-which are all the more urgent for men whose
living conditions must be improved.
It was in Nocutzapo, one of the many fishing villages on
the side of Lake Patzcuoro, that Cottrell had his next
lesson in Fundamental Education. His three companions
brought him to the end of a narrow alley, where two
young girls were pulling up earthenware jars filled with
water, while nearby some villagers were building a stone
tank. José explained :
"You know, it's so difficult to explain to these people
the relationship between disease and the causes of
disease. In your own country, any child knows that
diseases are spread by germs. That's not because you're
more intelligent than these people-don't run away with
that idea. You're taught it at school. You read books
and see films.

work forms part of a colleetion of studies by

; col COURIER NOVEMBER 1952. page 5
MEANS THE RIGHT TO BETTER LIVING
Under a blazing sun on the shores of Lake Patzcuaro, the villagers load up stones destined for a new road which they themselves have decided to build.
"But how can you expect someone who is illiterate, who
has never been outside his village, to realize that the
thing which kills his wife or child is the water he drinks ?
"That's why we've convinced the people of Nocutzapo
that, if they have pure water, they're not likely to get
typhoid or dysentery. So they've given their time and
their labour to build the cistern. They're going to buy an
electric pump-with their own money, mind you-to
bring the water into the cistern. Then we'll install a
filter, and for the first time Nocutzapo will have a pure
water supply."
Then it was Alfredo's turn to give Cottrell a lesson
- this time on the agricultural side of the students'task.
As they went to a village up in the hills, Alfredo
explained :
"You see, the emphasis in this work is always on
self-help. If you try to impose new techniques on these
people, you get nowhere. They simply watch you and
then forget all about it. But if you give them a personal
incentive to learn the techniques for themselves, then your
lessons are more likely to stick.
"It's like the story of the pigs. I went to a place called
San Gregorio, where nearly all the pigs were dying of
cholera. Well, the answer was simple : inocu) ation. But
we were a bit too'hasty.
"Without first of all explaining what we wanted to do,
we just arrived with our serum and hypodermics and set
to work. When we arrived at the village, we went
straight to the house of the village leader, whom we'd met
before, and as he wasn't in sight, we didn't wait, but
set to work on one of his sows.
"Suddenly he appeared.'What's happening ?' he said.
'What's that you've got in your hand ?'
.,'It's only a hypodermic syringe,') answered.
'There's no harm in it.'
"'Let me look !'
"'tt's quite harmless. You see this bottle ? Inside
it there's a medicine. You know when you wife was ill
the doctor gave her medicine out of a bottle'.
"'Yes, but that medicine was red. This has no
colour.'
"'But that doesn't matter. This instrument is made ta
give medicine to your sow. Only, instead of making her
drink it, we inject it into her blood, like this : And I
started to demonstrate.
"'Stop,'he shouted.
..'I tell you it's good medicine : I answered.'Your
pigs are all dying of cholera. This will save them.'
"'Stop,) te)) you,'he repeated. And villagers who
had come on the scene started shouting'Get out !',
'They're foreigners'''Throw them out !'"
"Finally, the village leader said :'You are strangers
here. We don't know you, and we don't like you. We
don't need foreigners to show us our business. Now, get
out !'"..
And Alfredo learned his lesson. It was no good
trying to move too quickly. First you had to gain the
confidence of the people and get to know and like them,
and then you reach the stage when they trust you, which
they will after a time.
In this case, one of the CREFAL professors, who knew
the village leader, later went to have a chat with him.
Then the leader invited Alfredo and his party bock, and
they could not have been more friendly. The party injected
the pigs, and showed the farmers how to use the
instrument. And nowadays they buy their own anti-
cholera serum, and do the injections themselves-with
excellent results. At present they lose perhaps one pig
out of ten, compared with nine out of ten before.
Many other aspects of Fundamental Education were
shown to Cottrell : how the peasants were taught to graft
on trees, to work their fields better, to make straw hats ;
how to teach housewives to produce more nourishing and
healthy meals, as well as showing them how to sew.
"And,"Conchita told hi-n,"t don't hear the phrase'This
is my fate, this is how I was born, and this is how I
shot ! die'any more."
During his final talk with the director of the Centre,
Leonard Cottrell heard a band playing"Pátzcuaro", an
old song in which the Tarascans praise Don Vasco, a priest
who helped them centuries ago. Now a new verse praises
CREFAL and Unesco.
.'y ou could hardly have a better indication of the
success of our scheme than this,"the director pointed
out to Cottrell.."After all, the best judges of the success
of Fundamental Education are the people themselves. The
verse you have just heard goes like this :'At Patzcuaro,
we even have CREFAL, the home of Unesco, which is of
great importance to our country !'".
The first class at the Unesco Centre at Pátzcuaro will
graduate in a few weeks. It was inaugurated in May 1951
with an enrolment of 52 students from nine Latin-Ame-
rican countries. This year, the number of students
attending the courses will be doubled.
Pátzcuaro is only the first of a network of Fundamental
Education centres which Unesco, with the aid of the other
Specialized Agencies of the United Nations, proposes to
set up in the areas which need them most : Africa, Asia,
Latin America, the Middle East. The next one will be at
Sirs-el-Layan, in Egypt. In the same way as the Mexican
Government has furnished the installations and ground
for the Pátzcuoro Centre, as well as given financial aid,
so the Egyptian Government will provide similar facilities
otSirs-et-Layan.
The completion of Unesco's Fundamental Education plan
will take several years. This is inevitable in view of the
enormous task that has to be faced. Such a task seems
even more urgent at a time when the anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is
being celebrated.
In this connection, the words used last year by
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of Unesco, are
still applicable today. In a foreword too booklet
describing Unesco's projected network of Fundamental
Education Centres he wrote :
"If we want to live in a united world, we cannot allow
this most. unjust of 011 frontiers to go on existing-the
frontier that divides those who can read from those who
cannot. We have terrible memories of the concentration
camps, but we some-
times forget that,
without prisons or
barbed wire, more
than 1, 200, 000, 000
men and women live
in the imptacobte,
invisible. inner dun-
geon of ignorance.
We propagate the
text of the Univer-
sal Declaration of
Human Rights, but
how can we pre-
sume to call it
'universal'when we
know that not one
man in two can
so much as read
it !"

### 71151: The Freedom of the artist and his duty to mankind

Page 6. NOVEMBER 1952
UNESCO
THE FREEDOM OF THE ARTIST AND
HIS DUTY TO MANKIND
ARTISTS always dislike a lack of precision. The artist
has to take hold of an idea and translate it into some-
thing concrete-a picture, a statue, a symphony or a
poem.
Those who met in Venice at the end of September for the
International Conference of Artists (organized under Unesco
auspices) displayed this characteristic of their calling when
they discussed the problems of freedom for a whole week,
without for a moment dwelling on theoretical considerations
regarding the concepts of freedom or rights.
There were nearly 300 of them from 44 countries. The
questions they asked and to which they sought to give
unanimous answers were :
What are the requirements for free creative work ?
What conditions make it possible, and what is the price
that may possibly have to be paid for them ?
How can the real message of a work of art be brought
home to men and women ?
How can the integrity of a work be defended against the
enemies of art, who are usually the enemies of freedom
as well ?
How, finally, can artists p) ay a usefu) part in Unesco's
work to secure these ends ?
These are practical questions, questions whose solution
involves technical considerations and sometimes economics.
The painter knows that he may work as he pleases-provided
he has enough to live on. But he wishes his painting to
live for others and, if possible, for all the world. So do the
sculptors and the architects.
All three dream of working together and welding their
various arts into that unity which gave the world the Greek
temple, the mediaeval church and the Renaissance palace.
After long years apart, they desire not merely association
but union, and recognize that union is impossible without State
support, public understanding and the international patronage
of cultural organizations.
At Venice, they studied ways in which such help might be
provided, and laid the foundations for their own collabora-
tion.
Once their personal independence is safeguarded, nothing
counts for so much with the dramatist and the writer as the
freedom of the theatre and the freedom of the printed word.
The problems which then arise seem rather far removed
from the literary sphere, since they relate to subsidies, mono-
polies, the quota system, taxes, charges, and all the intricacies
of copyright.
Writers are generally held to be individualists, but the ideas
expressed by those at this conference gave no evidence of
selfish interests. They were more concerned with the position
of literature and the drama than with the personal status of
the novelist, poet or dramatist ; they were trying to discover
the best ways of maintaining and increasing the influence of
their art in contemporary society.
The composers were working along the same lines. The
only effective method of establishing music as a force (in a
world which seldom recognizes a masterpiece until it is at
least a century old), seemed to them to be education. They
are anxious to introduce musical education at least for children
and young peoples, if not for the public in general.
by Georges Fradier
For the circulation and wider performance of their works,
for the protection of their personal interests, composers rely
on such organizations as the International Music Council and
Unesco ; long-term collaboration is the only real means of
dealing adequately with such problems.
vastly, there were representatives of the film industry in
Venice, glad, as they said, of this"official recognition of the
film as a form of art."They also wasted no time over
definitions or artistic criteria.
If films or to take their place as a genuine form of art,
the film industry, even more than architecture and the drama,
stands in need of sound finance and, of course, sound policy.
The discussions among its representatives at the conference
dealt mainly with the questions of assistance from the public
authorities, the reduction of taxes and duties, and State
subsidies.
But what of independence ? If all artists in their separate
spheres look to the public authorities for tax exemptions, help
and subsidies, what becomes of the independence which they
are usually so swift to defend ?
Not for one moment during the conference did they seek
to conceal this apparent contradiction. In their view, a
world without art is unthinkable, so that it seems perfectly
natural to them that the public authorities should give help
to art, to which they themselves have devoted their fives.
If it is suggested that the authorities in question might regard
such help as a pretext for control or direction, the artist will
ask :"own what, grounds ? I am not asking for charity ; I
claim your help in the name of freedom itself."
The Venice conference therefore called on all States to
"deist from imposing censorship in any form upon the products
of the mind, to refrain from restricting freedom or compro-
mising the position of the creative artist, and to recognize no
obstacles to the free movement of works of art."
There was no talk of rights for artists as the privilege of
a chosen few. On the contrary, it was the Declaration of
Human Rights which seemed to be naturally and necessarily
invoked. Roberto Rossellini sought to relate the aspirations
and claims of the film industry to the principle of the
right to participate in cultural life.
At the end of its last meeting, the Conference adopted
enthusiastically a resolution, submitted on behalf of the Italian
and French delegations by Guido Piovene and Jules Remains,
which declared :"Respect for the dignity of the individual
is the prerequisite for any form of creative activity... These
fundamental requirements are of universe) application and are
part of the body of Human Rights, which it is the duty of
artists to help in safeguarding..."
It was clearly in order to provide that help that the Venice
Conference sought ways in which artists could be associated
with Unesco's work. The eagerness of artists to work with
this Organization was fu)) y demonstrated-first of all, by the
number of people of outstanding prestige who had accepted
Unesco's invitation. More clearly every day, however, the
conference showed its confidence in Unesco and in the Organi-
zation's influence and impartiality.
A whole series of resolutions dealing with sociological, legal
and educational problems, and with the life of the arts, are
addressed directly to Unesco, soliciting the Organization's
services and offering to share its responsibilities. One of the
most important decisions from this point of view was that to
establish an International Association for the Plastic Arts,
which is to form another link in the chain of international co-
operating bodies, and which Unesco is to sponsor and organize
in the first stage of its devetopment*.
In short, the Conference showed clearly the readiness of
artists to collaborate with an Organization, one of whose main
aims is to uphold the right of every man and woman to a
share in cultural life.
This right is commonly regarded as a remote ideal. But
it is obvious that such an ideal can have no more fervent
champions than those who are not merely the representa-
times, but the artisans of culture, and in whose hands its deve-
lopment lies.
Referring to what he calls"combination workshops", Le
Corbusier spoke of the need for combining"all the arts which
express man's emotions-music, drama, the ballet, literature
and... the fi) m-at) the embodiments of a poetry which is
indeed the very essence of man's reason for lying."
The rights of the artist are thus seen to be not merely one
facet of Human Rights, but their very symbol, if not, indeed,
the fundamental condition for all other rights.
In the words of Thornton Wilder, the Venice conference
re-affirmed"two principles which the world is in constant
danger of forgetting : that the artist, through his creation,
has been at all times a force that draws men together, and
reminds them that the things which men have in common
are greater than the things that separate them, and that the
work of the artist is the clearest example of the operation
of freedom in the human spirit."
Thus the conference came back, as it closed, to the ques-
tion of freedom, after long and detailed discussions of the
practical conditions for the freedoms of every day.
At the inaugural session in the Doges'Palace, Unesco's
Director-General had also spoken of this problem and had
drawn attention to the heavy obligations which must always
go with freedom."There are two ways in which the artist can
be stove", said M. Torres Bodet,"the first is if he is obliged
to bow to orders outside his art ; the second is to imagine that
he is free in proportion as he rejects the rules which are the
strength of all art..."
Thornton Wilder, in his closing remarks, echoed these
words :"Freedom presents itself to an artist, not as a void,
but as a severe summons. Of all men, artists and men of
religion have the clearest vision of what freedom is ; and we
live in fear lest we abuse it."
* The original members of this Association are all
the painters. sculptors and engravers who were pre-
sent at the Venice conference. From among them, an
Executive Council was elected with the following offi-
cers,'president, Gino Severini (Italy), vice-president,
Anàré Lhote (France), secretary-srenera, Berto Lar-

--
Nothing is more significant of the
fragmentary character of our civiliza-
tion than the separation of the arts.
And, if a unity could be achieved
- say in the building of a new town-
and planners, architects, sculptors,
painters and all other types of artists
could work together from the begin-
ning, that unity would be artificial,
because it was imposed on a group. of
individuals, and not spontaneously
generated by a way of life.
Poetry, like art, cannot be JUdged
by criteria of practical usefulness ; but
its freedom conditions all freedom.
To imagine it could be divorced from
art would be an absurd denial of the
autonomy of the human being, a denial
of the age-old aspirations of mankind,
- a denial of man, for it would
amount to denying his claim to im-
mortality. For the arts are the sole
expression of the breath of humanity,
'rom which stems a duty of the State.
The number of concerts given
increases day by day, but the number
of works performed diminishes year by
year. This applies equally to the
innumerable recitals given by pianists,
who confine themselves strictly to the
three accepted composers. The public
should be led to take the same interest
in new aspects of music as in litera-
ture, drama, films and painting. And
music should be defended against the
exploitation of virtuosity in every form.
The writer's duty, though not easy to
fulfil, is perfectly simple to state :
to preserve his integrity. To do this,
he must be honest with himself and
with others. He must unhesitatingly
reject any interference with his
literary and artistic ideals. He must
ignore threats and promises like.
In these circumstances he should
soon come ta realize that he must
be at the service of truth, and o'
truth atone.
The theatre's spiritual aid is
9reot) y needed by a suffering
humanity. That is why the
theatre must receive gov-

rather than federal agencies. And it must be free
of political control. The theatre as a form of art
sheds a light that governments should keep burning
so that, at every pause of his journey, man might
look at himself, and by what he sees, be encouraged
to continue to his destiny.
The painter with a genuine
love of his art is a king in his
own right-however diminutive
his kingdom, however small his
stature. This is true royalty, and cannot be wrested
from you (the artist). You need never abdicate the
throne that you won without yiotence, and you will
leave a happier memory than many a crowned
monarch, for people will understand your work and
they will feel its message-perhaps until the end
of all time.
It is technically feasible to

however, is being done. Why ? Briefly, because the
pace of social readjustment in the modern world is
still teisurety. It has never speeded up to the
quicker beat of the process of swift transition
initiated by the Industrial Revolution, when the
traditional craft techniques of manufacture yielded
to the industrial technique of mass production.

### 71221: Women's access to education

COURIER NOVEMBER 1952. Page 7
WOMEN'S
ACCESS TO
EDUCATION
by Jacques Guérif
THE proclamation that"everyone has the
t right to education"qualified by the
words"without distinction of sex..."
made by the United Nations General
Assembly when it adopted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, marked
a world-wide condemnation of prejudices that
have existed throughout history against giving
women equal educational opportunities with
men.
Until recent times, all countries applied quite
different systems of education for men and for
women. It required all of Plato's audacity for
him to give women in his Republic an identical
role with men, and to institute the idea of
co-education.
Manuscripts and chronicles of the Middle
Ages and of the Renaissance, it is true, speak
of the considerable role played by capable,
courageous and enlightened women in political
life and in art and literature, but these
remarkable women did not stop most men
expressing the view, as did Moliere's Chrysale,
that"It is not right, and for many reasons, that
a women should study and know so many
things."
Even philosophers and educators took a
long time to abandon the accepted ideas of
their times. François Fenelon, author of a
Treatise on the Education of Girls, a work
considered very advanced in his day, declared :
"Keep young women within bounds. Teach
them that their sex should regard science with
a modesty almost as delicate as that which
inspires a horror of vice."And even Jean-
Jacques Rousseau declared that"the virtue of
women is conditioned by their ignorance-and
docility."
It was not until the French Revolution that a
radical change of attitude was observed. At
that time Condorcet wrote :"Women are, like
men, reasonable beings, capable of making an
intelligent contribution to the betterment of
society and mankind.
"So far from hindering them in their role as
wife and mother, a good intellectual training
will make them more able in this respect-more
capable of maintaining in their husbands, and
fostering among their children, a love of truth
and devotion to the public weal."These views,
at that time purely abstract and doctrinal, were
a forecast of future evolution.
A century later, with the progress of
democratic ideas and also as a consequence of
great economic changes, this evolution began to
take shape. Feminist activities were organized.
Between 1875 and 1880, the fight to extend
educational opportunities to women started to
show results in the United States, England,
Germany and France, with the setting up of
schools which were soon to receive official
approval.
Primary and secondary education was opened
to women in countries with more liberal ideas
(but with modifications and limitations of
curricula which often kept their education quite
different from that given to boys). It was not
long, however, before women, who had until
now been refused admission to universities,
won their right to higher education.
The two world wars and their concomitant
loss of human life, plus the economic and social
upheavals that have come about since the
beginning of the 20th century have helped to
accentuate this evolution. Women showed
themselves to be perfectly capable of replacing
men in many types of industrial work.
New conditions of life led to greater numbers
of women than ever seeking paid jobs, either
in factories or in shops, or in the liberal and
administrative professions. Long and complete
studies and professional training became indis-
'Oensable to them in their new positions.
This is the state of affairs in the more
progressive countries. But how about the less
developed ones, which are now striving to make
up for lost time ? There it is generally realized
that, without the support of women, there can
be no victory in the fight which these various
countries are conducting against poverty and
ignorance.
But here the problem is a double one, for
the education of young women must go hand-
in-hand with the task of giving adults an
elementary knowledge of hygiene, child-care,
domestic economy, rural and industrial work.
New conditions of life have led more and more women to enter professions and take on jobs tradition-
ally reserved for men. But women are still frequently handicapped in their careers by discrimination.
Events which have changed the face of the
world have also brought womén face-to-face
with situations which are entirely new to them
and to which they must now adapt themselves.
This adaptation, in other words, has become a
matter of practical necessity which has left
questions of principles behind it.
It is not enough to recognize the need for
women's right to education ; it is also necessary
to. decide what measures must be taken to
ensure their access to it. The difficulties of a
pedagogical order which today prevent compul-
sory schooling from becoming universal-
insufficient schools and shortage of teachers-
are often serious, but are not factors which
seem to affect girls any more than they do boys,
except where the shortage of girls'schools is
more pronounced than those for boys in places
where the separation of the sexes is rigorously
applied, even in elementary schooling.
The basic reasons for the inequality of the
sexes in the matter of schooling, and the early
termination of study by girls, are due partly to
the financial position of parents, and partly to
the customs of countries and to popular opinion
which may be more or less favourable to the
emancipation of women and their participation
in certain fields of activity which have for long
been regarded as the exclusive province of men.
The reasons, then, are economic and social-
two factors which work together and which
cannot easily be dissociated.
Obviously, going to a professional or other
training college often entails heavy expense for
the maintenance of the student, perhaps in a
city a long way from his parents'home. When
the parents have not enough money to enable
all their children to do this, the girls find
themselves at a disadvantage with the boys,
who usually get priority.
Even when this choice has not to be made,
girls still tend to prefer a training that is
shorter and less costly, such as for a commercial
career. Also the parents are sometimes more
willing to make sacrifices to ensure their sons'
education because the possibilities open to
women are more limited than those for men,
despite the fact that the knowledge required
and certificates bestowed on both are exactly
the same.
Again, women often abandon their careers
after marriage, and therefore people usually
think it is not worthwhile to give them a long
and costly professional training which they
will not use to earn a living.
An important indication of the willingness of
governments to give practical effect to the
principle of equal educational opportunities for
women as proclaimed in the Universal Decla-
ration was given by the recent International
Conference on Public Education, held in
Geneva. Here 102 educators representing
51 countries chose this subject as their main
discussion theme. Emphasizing that the solu-
tions envisaged must be adapted to local
conditions in each country, they suggested some
steps that could be taken to overcome existing
prejudices and obstacles.
They declared that, in the drawing up of
plans for making education free and obligatory,
the provision of facilities for girls must be
treated with exactly the same priority as those
for boys. The same needs must be kept
in mind when it is intended to build or open
new schools and to employ more teachers.
Even taking into account the special course
which prepares girls for their role in the family
and in the community, length of compulsory
education should be the same for both sexes.
Similar qualifications should mean similar
degrees and positions. Young women should
have the same advantages as young men in the
way of scholarships and allowances, so that
they, too, can complete their studies without
facing extra difficulties on the secondary,
professional, technical and higher educational
levels.
In spite of the problems that arise in
connection with the free access of women to
all levels of instruction, as well as giving them
full civic and social responsibilities, there is no
basic difference between the aims of education
for women and of education for men. Each
must become capable of thinking for himself
or herself, of understanding the modern world
'as well as his or her own heritage of culture,
and of taking part actively in the life of his
or her country while remembering the role it
must play in the family of nations.

### 71222: Human rights on the screen

Monsieur Pascal, the teacher in"Ecole Buissonnière", give
AFTER being a cinema critic inMontevideo for nearly 15
years, and before that a
cinema fan for almost as long, I
went to London in the middle of
the last war. Soon my interest in
moving pictures dropped to an
unforeseen extent.
The events of everyday life in a
struggling city became to me
actually far more absorbing than
the screen exploits I used to
admire in the provincial peace of
my childhood and early. youth.
Even the magic of some well-
remembered lyrical film'would
appear quite thin when compared
to the poetic stature people around
me seemed to acquire under the
ever-present impact of death.
Mine was not an individual
experience. It happened to millions
of people during the last ten or 15
years. Eventually its consequences
were to provoke a crisis in the
cinema industry, faced nowadays
with dwindling box-Office receipts
all over the world. The factory of
wonders seems to have lost its old
appeal, or at least to have let life
supersede it.
For, along with all its horrors,
wonders never ceased to crop up
during the last war, and have never
ceased since. The greatest feats of
the war are still too preposterous
to be re-created before the Klieg
lights. In the imagination of
millions of people, the miracles of
antibiotics, rocket weapons, jet
planes and of atomic developments
have become a challenge to the
tired wonders of life in Technicolor.
New elements are added to this
challenge every day. The future is
charged with suspense. On the
purely mechanical side, science
fiction on the screen has not dealt
even adequately with the exciting
prospect that space ships and
interplanetary trips offer to pro-
ducers.
What kind of super-wonder could
the cinema invent now to compete
with contemporary events and
exert once again the hypnotic
attraction it once had for the
masses ? The answer to this ques-
tion was clear enough in 1940, when
John Ford made The Grapes of
Wrath and presented man as a
fully-sledged creature that we could
recognize and feel identified with,
and not just a figment of the
screenwriter's imagination.
More than ever man, amidst the
magnificent nightmare of his
present life, now needs to know
himself, to look into himself. The
screen can help him to do this with
a strength and urgency no other
art could equal.
It is now some 30 years since the
documentary cinema, under the
banner of Flaherty, began to pave
the way for the introduction of
man in films-absurd as this word
"'introduction"may sound to some
people. But Flaherty looked for
real and vivid media quite exotic
to most of us ; the snows of the
frozen North, the stony fields of
Aran, the Indian jungle, the
swamps of Louisiana.
Another school of documentary
films flourished in England during
the war, depicting Britain under
the stress of battle-still a fa-
bulous adventure from the stand-
point of ordinary life, for all the
exacting organization, social as
well as technical, that went into it.
In many post-war feature films a
superficial preoccupation with the
documentary had led directors to
give us real locations-although
very rarely real characters or reac-
tions.
Thus, apart from a few out-
standing exceptions, the docu-
mentary at its best has beeh
a lesson-vital, perceptive and
poetic, as well as informative-on
the unusual and extraordinary,
either in background or way of life.
What we apparently needed,
though, was to go back to the
ordinary and extract from it new
sources of enjoyment and of confid-
ence in mankind. The.'neo-
realistic"film, as critics called it
from the start, sprang from this
necessity. It concerned itself with
an interpretation of the individual
called, in a revolting cliché,"the
common man"-the Western com-
mon man and his circumstance,
spiritual as well as geographical
and social.
As in a few memorable aims of
the"silent"era, man became in
this type of film no longer a pretext
to serve the mechanics of fiction,
but the central element, the very
soul of the work. The difference
between the present and the past
is that in silent films, with their
star system, man invariably turned
into an archetype. Chaplin gave
us his romantic tramp ; Fairbanks
his Quixote in plus-fours.
Only a score of films in post-war
years have really succeeded in
making heroes of each one of us-
with all our defects, hopes and
anxieties. Most of these films have
met with universal success. In
depicting man and his present, as
well as his eternal, plight with
nobility they have invariably struck
the note of Human Rights, as
defined in the United Nations
Universal Declaration.
This is a curious and generally
unnoticed fact, and a most en-
couraging one. Yet facts must
needs be illustrated with examples.
Here are some, chosen at random.
The Italian, De Sica, one of the
creators of the'''neo-realistic''
school, dealt with the rights to
work and to an adequate standard
of living in Bicycle Thieves, and
with the child's right to education
and welfare in the unforgettable
Sciuscia-a theme Bunuel was
going to enlarge upon in Los
olvidados.
The racial side of Human Rights
was the particular province of a
host of brilliant Hollywood direct-
ors-Elia Kazan, de Rochemont,
Clarence Brown-in a series of
films on the Negro which went
from the slightly conventional to
the absolute genuine in spirit. A
poignant British work, Cry, the
Beloved Country, adapted from
the novel of the same name, has
recently been added to the list.
The right to protection of the
moral and material interests re-
sulting from a scientific production
was at the core of that brilliant
satire, The Man in the White Suit,
although this film does not entire-
ly belong in the new movement.
A minor, sincere work of Bernard
Miles, Chance of a Lifetime, treated
the collective rights of workers and
the right to own property"in
association with others". In Jus-
tice est fate, another film which
enters into a more conventional
category, Cayatte dealt with the
right to the law's protection.
Now the main preoccupation of
the producers and directors of
these films was not to illustrate
certain aspects of the Human
Rights enumerated in the Universal
Declaration. But it is symptomatic
of the vital importance these rights
have on the lives of us all that,
implicitly or explicitly, they are
present in such significant works
of the contemporary cinema.
Nor is this likely to be a mere
coincidence during a passing trend.
Television will eventually devise a
new type of factual film with a
direct appeal to its living-room
audiences. This low-budgeted,
quickly-made film will have to
depend on some special intimate
quality communicable to the half-
dozen people who form the average
TV audience.
It is quite probable that modern
man, with his problems, his rights,
and all that forms the complicated
texture of our lives, will be the
main theme of that special form
of drama.
The sooner studio executives
realize there is a new glamour on
the way-a glamour that is cheaper
but, except for men of great
artistic integrity, far more elusive
than the one they imposed on the
public for so long-the better for
the education of the masses, to
say nothing of the film makers'
threatened finances.
As it changes its mood and
content, the cinema cannot but
help the implementation of Human
Rights. The prospect before us is,
in this respect, quite stimulating.

y,"Broken Barrier"presents a magnificent documentary record of New Zealand life.
M f PASCAL was a young man who,after passing out of a French*"*'* Teacher 'Training College in
July 1914, was immediately mobilized into
the Army.
The day he should have been taking
his first class, he was fighting in the
Battle of the Marne, and during the next
four years his only pupils were the men
he commanded.
He was wounded, spent a long time in
hospital and finally came back into
civilian life with a desire"finally to do my
job as a school teacher, to work for a
better way of things and to start every-
thing afresh with children, for they
are a beginning in themselves."
The film Ecole Buissonnière tells what
happens to M. Pascal after he is sent to
a village named Salezes, in the moun-
tainous part of Provence. The villagers
are friendly but rather suspicious of the
"new methods"which the teacher be-
lieves will help to make him liked and
understood by the children, and which
also will help to develop their qualities
and youthful intelligence.
Pascal's ideas are very different from
those of the former village teacher
whose guiding principles might well be
summed up as : order, punishments,
discipline, texts learned by heart and
arms folded in class.
The new master soon wins over the
children to his ways, but a section of the
village remains hostile, as does one of the
boys, Albert, the dunce who has already
failed three times to obtain his general
certificate of education.
But there are certain extenuating
circumstances in Albert's case. People in
the village say of him :"Oh ! he's the
son of a man who never came to much,
and who was killed in the war."
To such people Pascal retorts :"He's
the son of a hero."Finally, with much
difficulty, the teacher wins Albert over
to his side.
But resistance to the'''now methods"
increases and the threat that he will be
sent elsewhere if he persists, drives the
teacher to make a risky wager. Offering
to let all his eligible pupils, including
Albert, sit for the general education cer-
tificate examination, Pascal says that if
one of them fails he will ask for his own
transfer to another school.
Albert is, of course, the shakiest of the
candidates. Though he has made some
progress since his previous examination
failures, he is still weak on history and
he can remember neither the date of the
Battle of Agincourt nor when Louis XIV
died.
In geography he is even wider of the
mark. When the examiner asks him the
specious question :"What is the name of
the mountain which separates France
from England ?" he replies"Waterloo."
But he does know, however, that
"every Frenchman has the right to speak,
write and print freely."As the examiner
shows surprise that he is so well versed
in this particular subject, Albert tells
him :"That is in the Declaration of the
Rights of Man."
On this question, Albert's knowledge
seems inexhaustible."The Rights of
Man", he says,"also means women's
rights, and those of children too. Of
course, I've only just found out about
this. Before, all I heard about were my
duties. Nobody ever mentioned rights."
Unfortunately, Albert is stumped when
the examiner asks him the date of the
Declaration of the Rights of Man and is
Bnce more thrown on the defensive.
"I'm trying to talk to you with my
heart more than with memory", he says.
"I've remembered everything I've un-
derstood. I didn't know the date of
the Battle of Agincourt, but I do know
what Human Rights are :'All human
beings are born free and equal in dignity
and rights... everyone is free to hold
opinions without interference.'"
Finally, Albert's eloquence on the-
subject of Human Rights wins the day.
He and all the other boys from the
village school pass the examination, thus.
winning a victory for Pascal's ideas.
Jean-Paul Le Chanois, who wrote the
scenario and dialogue for the film, tells
a moving little story about the shooting
of this particular scene in the studios at
Nice. The boy who was playing the role
of Albert found the texts from the De-
claration of the Rights of Man difficult
to enunciate, and it was only when the
examination scene was being shot for
the third time that the boy said his lines
perfectly.
While this was going on a remarkable
atmosphere reigned through'out the
studio. The studio technicians, carpent-
ers, electricians and others who normally
go about their business without paying
too much attention to what is happening
on the set, stopped to listen and watch.
As the shout of"cut"brought the
shooting to a close, the chief electrician
turned to Le Chanois and said :"I was
sure he wouldn't make a mistake that
time... I was saying the words along with
him."
When the film was completed, all those
who had shared in its production
- workers, technicians and actors-
attended the traditional dinner to
celebrate the occasion. But this time
those present did not sing the songs
which usually conclude the dinner.
Instead, recalling the scene in the film,
they got up, one after the other, to
expound the rights proclaimed in 1789 in
France's Declaration of the Rights of
Man..
Breaking down race barriers
B ROKEN BARRIER", a dramatic fea-ture film made by Roger Mirams,
a New Zealand film producer,
deals with the subject of racial relations
between Maoris and Europeans, and pre-
sents a striking example of how Article 2
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (Everyone is entitled to all the
rights and freedoms... without distinction
of any kind... such as race, colour...) is
applied in New Zealand.
Full legal and political equality for the
Maoris has existed in New Zealand for
many years, and is taken for granted.
They elect their own members of par-
liament, every profession is open to
them and they have achieved distinction
in'all fields.
Yet though the film indicates clearly
enough the very harmonious race rela-
tions between Maoris and Europeans, a
certain amount of prejudice and colour
consciousness does exist at the level of
personal and social relationships, such
as those brought about by intermarriage
between Maoris and Europeans.
Broken Barrier tells a simple, ro-
mantic story of a young Maori girl, the
daughter of a well-to-do farming family,
who meets a European, a journalist
whose parents are conservative middle
class people. When the young couple
decide to marry, they meet opposition
from their parents.
The success of the film, which is
showing in crowded cinemas in New
Zealand, demonstrates that this parti-
cular problem, though some people
discuss it less openly than others, does
still exist.
Some of the actors are professional or
semi-professional players, but most of
those who appear were recruited on the
spot. The film story is told against a
wide background of contemporary New
Zealand life.
From scenes filmed on the coast and
on a large Maori sheep and cattle farm.
the story moves to Wellington, the ca-
pital city and then to Rotorua, a regior
much visited by tourists. The camera
goes into Maori and European homes,
hospitals and country schools, so that
while telling a story of conflict caused by
colour, it also presents a fine docu-
mentary record of New Zealand.
The idea for making Broken Barrier
came from a former member of the Film
Division of Unesco, Mr. Gordon Mirams,
who was in Paris in 1948 when the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
was adopted there by the United Na-
tions General Assembly.
On his return to New Zealand, where
he. is now Chief Government Censor and
Registrar of Films, Mr. Mirams suggested
to his brother, Roger, that he should
make a film illustrating Article 2 of the
Universal Declaration.
Roger Mirams, working with another
young New Zealander, John O'Shea, who
became co-producer, director and script-
writer, carried out the venture. The
musical score by Sydney John Kay, an
Australian composer, is largely based on-
traditional Maori folk melodies.
Those who see this film when it is
shown in other countries will agree with
the mother of the young Maori girl when
she says..."There will be difficulties... but
we have all come a long way."She is
speaking not only for the young couple
who have decided to go ahead and marry,
but also for the people of New Zealand
as a whole and for all the peoples of the
world to whom the Universal Declaration
is addressed.

### 71224: The Right to understand

Page 10. NOVEMBER 1952
THE RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND
ONE human instinct that sets man apart
from most beasts is curiosity. And the
one inborn trait of mankind, shared by
all peoples at all times, is intelligence.
The use of his intelligence to satisfy his
curiosity has brought man understanding of
the world he lives in. In such measure as
he understands nature, he has created civiliza-
tion and enriched his life.
Indeed, those human cultures that have
most encouraged unlimited curiosity and
have best organized their intelligence for
exercizing it are the ones that have profited
most in wealth and health, in power and
leisure and, as a result during the past
century, in economic and political advantage
over other cultures. It has been the reward
of understanding the material world.
But the right to understanding is not a
special privilege. In a de-
mocratic world it must be as
universal as is the instinct of
curiosity. It is covered by Article
27 of the Declaration of Human
Rights in the words :"Everyone
has the right freely to parti-
cipate in the cultural life of the
community, to enjoy the arts
and to share in scientific
achievement and its benefits."
To participate fully in modern
life and to share in its achieve-
ments is impossible without
understanding the physical
world, the nature of life and
the behaviour of people. And
the key to understanding is as
universal among men as hunger
itself : it is the hunger of the
mind, curiosity.
Every infant satisfies this
instinct by the use of all his
senses. He sees and observes,
he listens, he touches and feels,
he tastes and tries to eal
whatever is within his reach.
Later he explores the room and
the house, reaching for every-
thing, tearing and pounding to
find out what things are made
of.
When he learns to speak he
asks questions endlessly. It is a
wonderful world, so full of
mysteries, yet satisfying if he
feeds his mind as well as his
body. He has all the joy of an
explorer. He is a born scientist
and uses the direct method of
research.
It does not always last. Some
children, with minds not so
hungry, are easily satisfied.,... I,., I.
They lose interest in what is over the hill or
across the seas, what makes plants grow and
machines work, or why people act as they do.
But'most children lose their curiosity more
gradually by a kind of second-hand satisfac-
tion when they begin to learn from books or
from their teachers. Then the answers
come easily and it is not hard to believe what
one reads or is told.
This is the only practical way to learn the
accumulated wisdom of the ages. It would
be impossible to rediscover everything for
one's self. In fact, human progress depends
entirely on the fact that each generation can
learn from the one before and go on from
there.
Yet it is dangerous too, because there re-
mains so much that no one knows, and
because much of our supposed knowledge is
not true. Once evervone knew that the earth
was flat and that man cannot fly. Both
were wrong, of course. And so too, much
that is taught today is almost certainly
untrue.
That is the danger of having one's innate
curiosity satisfied by the authority of others.
It is the danger of accepting half-knowledge
and tradition and prejudice instead of proof.
It is the danger of accepting knowledge
instead of understanding.
The only protection against this danger is
to keep alive the instinct of curiosity, which
by Dr Gerald Wendt
will for ever ask :"How do you know ?-
What is the proof ?-Can we make a test
that will show whether you are right or
wrong ?" From such questions modern
science has learned the truth. They were
asked by Copernicus and Newton, Columbus
and Pasteur, Lavoisier and Einstein. Like all
great scientists, they were men of undying
curiosity and so created our modern age.
They lived in a culture where curiosity was
encouraged. On the other hand, the cultures
that depended on memorizing from books and
lectures, that depended wholly on believing
what the, wise men said, that discouraged
curiosity and experimenting, are the cultures
in which science has been foreign and
development in modern terms has been slow.
The right to participate in modern culture
and to share in the achievements of modern
The key to understanding is as universal among men as hunger itself ; it is hunger
of the mind-curiosity. Humanity can solve its problems if curiosity is not hampered.
it every year with the assurance that they
will be repaid many times over by the new
understanding of nature that the researches
will bring and the new power and wealth
that will result.
But, quite naturally, great researches and
discoveries also bring great new problems.
They are not always in the physical world.
Indeed, more and more they raise problems in
human life and in social institutions.
The development of atomic energy is il
striking example. The conquest of disease
has increased the number of persons living
on the earth and has brought, or will yet
bring, enormous problems in how to provide
them all with food. Quick transportation and
instant communication have made the world
so small that we are all neighbours and what
happens across the seas concerns us all.
Starvation, disease and ignor-
ance in any part of the world
are a challenge to every nation,
no matter how prosperous.
Three specialized agencies of
the United Nations-FAO,
WHO and Unesco-have been
created to deal with them.
They all face problems that go
far beyond physical knowledge.
Yet they are confident that
research can find the answers.
Those who know science only
as a source of material wealth
and physical power often fear it
because of the human and
social problems that it creates.
But all who have lived with
science and worked in it know
that the secret of its succes is
the research method, that cheer-
ful and confident attitude
towards all problems, the ability
to fiind the facts and face them
too, the habit of doubting and
questioning and testing all
human knowledge, no matter
how ancient and how well-
established.
Those who have worked in
research are not dismayed by
the new social problems. They
expect them, indeed they wel-
come them and are sure they too
can be evolved.
It is true, however, that this is
much easier to do in the phy-
sical and natural sciences than
it is in human affairs. New
knowledge about the stars and
the rocks is easy to accept. But
in human and social affairs,
where there have been no Scion-
tific answers, men have long
had their opinions which by now are firmly
established,'whether right or wrong. It
takes courage to question them and even
more to accept new understanding.
For instance, it has been said that the
human being is born aggressive, that
hostility is innate, and that even war is
natural. But modern research has proved
that children are naturallv friendly and so-
cial, and that aggressive behaviour is acquir-
ed or learned during the frustrations of a bad
environment.
It is human to be peaceful, not hostile.
This is a little hard for most people to believe,
because they have already learned the oppo-
site, and must first unlearn the untruth.
So also rye !"search has shown that all human
races are alike in inborn traits and abilities.
Humanity will solve the intimate questions
of human life and the vital problems of
getting along together in groups and in
nations, if the instinct of curiosity is not
hampered and if every resource of intelli-
gence is applied with the same skill and
strategy that have enabled science to under-
stand the physical world.
In the small crowded world of today, ana
with vast powers for both good and evil in
our hands, it is essential that we learn to
understand all men and all nations. The
right to understand is one of the basic Human
Rights.
science is the right to understanding, and this
is based on the right to unlimited curiosity.
It is the natural birthright of every child,
everywhere on earth. It is a right that wise
parents, teachers and governments will
maintain and encourage.
If there is no limit to curiosity, is there then
no end to questions and problems ? Since
the universe is infinite there can be no end.
Beyond every mountain there is another to
be explored. When the whole earth has been
mapped we have neighbouring planets to
explore.
Every research question answered brings
more questions to answer. Beyond the solar
system are the stars, beyond them the ga-
laxies, beyond them whole universes of
unknown stars. Within each object are the
molecules, then, farther in, the atoms, and
within them electrons and protons. Either
outward or inward investigation finds new
facts but also new mysteries. There is no
end.
All this is readily admitted with respect to
the physical and material world. The me-
thod of exploration has been refined to a very
successful strategy and technique of research,
often called the"scientific method"because it
has been successful in providing the sure
knowledge that is called science.
It has been so fabulouslv successful that
thousands of millions of dollars are spent on

### 71255: Human rights in the classroom

>URIERNESCC
A new generation hears about its rights-and duties. The teacher has not only a good opportunity, but also a great responsibility for helping the child towards a
knowledge of Human Rights, and an understanding of what they mean in the practical term of daily life. But such instruction is still lackina in man v !' : hnnl..
HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CLASSROOM
I THE children in the elementary class were
having their daily period of news report-. ing. One of the girls read ut a news aper
item which said that the president of their
country was planning to make a visit abroad.
"Yes !", commented one of the children,"he
always goes on trips and spends a lot of govern-
ment money."
"If you were president,"said the teacher,
"would you spend the government's money in
this way ?"
From this moment on it was a verbal free-for-
all, with every child offering his or her opinion.
Finally, the teacher interrupted.
"I am not sure whether the president is right
or not,"she said,"but I am sure that ours is a
great form of government. And do you know
why ? What we are doing and saying here could
never happen in some other countries. If it
were, We might all go to gaol."
As all the children looked incredulous, the
teacher continued :"You see, in some countries
it is a crime to talk against the government or
persons in authority. In a democratic one like
ours, you are free to criticize. You will not go
to gaol for it.
"This freedom is one of the Human Rights.
You are free to receive or give ideas in any way.
This Human Right is called freedom of speech.
Do you have this freedom ?"
"Yes !" chorused the children.
"Then,"asked the teacher,"can you give me
an example ?"
"Well,"said one child,"in one of the daily
papers, there is a column entitled.'We, The
People'. My father said that you can write to
that column and complain about anything."
Another said,.'In a radio programme, I heard
the announcer criticize the mayor of the city."
"Do you like our form of government ?" asked
the teacher.
The unanimous reply put the finishing touch to
this lesson.
What went on in this particular classroom was
just one example of the many methods teachers
employ to bring home to their classes the
meaning of Human Rights. For it is first of all
in school that a systematic approach can be made
to teaching about Human Rights.
From the time a ; child begins his education
until he finishes it as an adolescent or a young
adult, it is the teacher who has a good oppor-
tunity and great responsibility for helping
him towards a knowledge of Human Rights, and
an understanding of what they mean in the
practical terms of daily life.
Of course, the work of spreading knowledge of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
throughout the world cannot be left to schools
alone. All men and women should know and
understand it in order to exercise their rights and
to assume the responsibilities which they imply.
Since 1948, when the Declaration was adopted,
the United Nations has made every effort to
disseminate this knowledge as widely as possible.
But if teaching about rights began with young
people, the results would be far more effective and
lasting, and it is in this connection that education
has a vital role to play. It can give to the indi-
vidual not only the knowledge, but also the atti-
tudes and social values which are indispensable
to an understanding of, and respect for, Human
Rights. But, unfortunately, school programmes
in many places have not yet been altered to make
room for Human Rights teaching.
It is obvious that the development of teaching
about Human Rights is greatly aided in countries
where tolerance and mutual respect between
different nationalities and beliefs is stressed. It
has also been helped in some countries by the
inclusion in civic or history textbooks of facts
about the main international organizations that
have been set up since the war.
Teachers'organizations have stressed the need
for the existence and activities of such organi-
zations to be made more widely known in
schools. They have suggested that one reason
for lack of knowledge is that organizations are
more often than not referred to by their initials
only-which convey nothing to children-and to
the fact that, with some exceptions, children have
no contact with them. Most of them also agree
that the text of the Universal Declaration is
above the heads of children in their charge.
The subject of Human Rights is complex and
controversial. Teaching about them is an inno-
vation for many systems of education. Thus,
before such teaching can be carried out effectively
on a world scale, there are many problems to be
solved.
It was to help in the solution of these problems
that Unesco recently organized a Seminar on
Education for Living in a World Community, with
special reference to the principles of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, at Woudschoten,
Zeist, in Holland.
One of the fundamental objectives of Unesco's
programme is to make Human Rights principles
more widely known and observed. Since the
proclamation of the Universal Declaration,
Unesco has undertaken many activities aimed at
the dissemination and implementation of its
principles, and it is even true to say that all
Unesco's work serves this purpose directly or
indirectly.
Among the most effective of Unesco's educa-
tional methods are international seminars-
meetings attended by specialists and teachers
selected by the governments of Member States.
Those participating make a practical study of
given problems, pool their experience and
compare their ideas, seek the most effective
methods, and prepare materials appropriate for
the techniques thus evolved.
The seminar at Woudschoten was not the first
organized by Unesco for the study of education
for living in a world community. The 63 edu-
cators who met in Holland under the leadership
of Dr. C. E. Beeby, Director of Education for New
Zealand, benefitted by the experience gained at
earlier seminars organized in France, Czecho-
slovakia, England, the United States of America,
Canada and Belgium since 1947.
No general doctrine relative to teaching about
Human Rights has come out of these meetings,
but they have produced a number of principles
and techniques which can help to form the basis
for such a doctrine.
Here are some of the conclusions reached by
the teachers and educators meeting at Woud-
schoten :
To the question : Is it possible effectively to
educate children under 12 in the spirit and prin-
ciples of the Universal Declaration ?, the answer
of the seminar group concerned was"Yes-
providing that a number of special factors are
borne in mind."
During this first stage of schooling, the child
is still too immature for abstract thought, and for
this reason no direct or systematic teaching about
the text of the Universal Declaration should be
attempted.UoVVç, u.. J.. 1JVt ; u..
Certain activities, however, can
be used to develop attitudes and
habits consonant with the prin-
ciples of Human Rights. On the

TEACHING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
(Continued from previous page)
basis of these, an intellectual understanding of
the Universal Declaration can be established later
in the educational process.
For instance, certain free activities can be
introduced into the school programmes which
will enable the teacher to discover the child's
individual personality. He can be given certain
responsible jobs, such as helping to keep the lib-
rary neat, and even join in social services which
extend beyond the school itself, including assist-
anCe to old people and invalids, and to needy
schools. Debating clubs and teamwork projects
can also be organized.
Members of the seminar group dealing with
the education of ahildren aged from 12 to 15 years
emphasized that the text of the Universal De-
claration is, because of its legal and abstract
character, still beyond the intellectual grasp of
children of these ages. They felt that what was
needed was a version reducing the Declaration to
its essentials, and revolving around four main
concepts : freedom, equality and justice, fra-
ternity and solidarity, and duty to the community.
These ideas, which are familiar to children, pro-
vide a firm basis for teaching about Human
Rights.
It is the teacher's task to prepare the child to
exercise, demand and deserve Human Rights. To
exercise Human Rights is, first, to understand
their meaning, and second, to apply the principles
of Human Rights to daily living. To demand
them is to work with faith and courage for the
realization of the ideals of the Universal Decla-
ration in national and international life. To
deserve Human Rights is to carry out the duties----'I----------'_. !'. LJ---'l....' ! _"L..-----and responsibilities which corres-
pond with them.
For the achievement of these
purposes, the teacher must arouse
in his pupils an active sympathy
for the principles of Human
Rights. This does not mean that
children should be subjected to a
campaign of blind propaganda ; on
the contrary, the true situation of
Human Rights in the world today
must be made clear to them.
For example, the great difference
between a statement of principles,
such as the Universal Declaration,
and a binding treaty, such as the
projected U. N. Covenant on
. Human Rights should be explained,
and pupils must be made conscious
of the fact that rights can be lost
unless they are defended whenever
and wherever necessary. The
teacher should show that it has
always been necessary to defend
Human Rights.
Most courses of study in the tra-
ditional school curriculum provide
-----. L..-' :"" :'-- --... 11____1__' : --. L'L.-
opportunities for developing the concept of
Human Rights in the minds of the pupils. For
example, in geography, lessons about the living
conditions of people in under-developed countries
give the teacher a chance to stress the needs and
rights of those handicapped by want, ignorance
or disease.
In history, the story of slavery will naturally
direct the attention of the class to the principle
that no person should be held in servitude. In
literature, the lives and works of writers who
have fought for Human Rights offer rich
resources.
When it came to considering how Human
Rights can contribute to better international
understanding, the group started off by reviewing
some of the objectives of education for living in a
world community. To be a good citizen of a
nation where Human Rights are respected was
to be a citizen of the world community, they
declared.
The schools must contribute to the develop-
ment of free, independent personalities (which
were nevertheless capable of self-discipline for
the good of the community). Teachers must
train future citizens who would defend and work
for Human Rights in international as well as
national life.
The third seminar group, which was concerned
with education for young people aged between
15 and 18, began its work by considering the
environment in which youth lives in different
parts of the world. Folk and social traditions,
family customs, religion, philosophy and the
political and economic organization of life in
various countries were studied, each member
contributing information about his own nation.
One of the educational methods most appro-
priate to children in their teens, they declar-
ed, is group discussion. It is largely by this that
the pupils begin to formulate and to make precise
the nature of the problems which face them, to
sift and evaluate their experiences, and to think
creatively. In group discussion they acquire
habits of mutual respect, tolerance, intellectual
integrity and co-operation.
Members of the Unesco Seminar on Education for Living in a World Community
were received by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands at her Soestdijk residence.
Photo shows Queen Juliana (centre) with, on her right, M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General, and, on her left, Dr Beeby, who headed the seminar.
Even very young children can be shown their rights
and responsibilities. At the school where this
photo was taken, the children have already begun
to develop the fundamental civic qualities-respect
for the rights of others, a sense of solidarity, disci-
pline and responsibility, as well as a sinking of
individual interests for the sake of the general good.
Another most instructive and convincing
method is experimentation. One conclusive
example of this was provided by a social studies
class (ages about 16-17) which was engaged in a
study of democracy and dictatorship. A number
of students expressed dissatisfaction with
democracy because of its alleged inefficiency.
Dictatorship was more efficient, they said, in
getting things done. They suggested that more
dictation by the teacher and less student parti-
cipation might be desirable in their own class.
The teacher proposed that the class be operated
as a dictatorship for two weeks. At the end of
this time, the students were to choose which
method they preferred for the rest of the year.
The students accepted the proposal eagerly,
and the teacher did his part in thorough-going
fashion. He strictly proscribed all class activities.
He acted as sole judge of all debatable ques-
tions. He even appointed two students to serve
as.'secret police"and to report to him daily on
the private actions of their classmates. Each
class period opened with the teacher's reading of
these reports.
Most of the students were ready to end the
experiment at the end of the first week, but the
"teacher-dictator"was unyielding. At the end
of two weeks, the class voted unanimously to
return to its accustomed democratic procedures.
But not all aspects of Human Rights teaching
can or should be based on group activity. The
pupil is not only a member of a community, but
also an individual in his own right, and he must
be given the opportunity to develop his own
personality fully and freely. For example, in the
cultivation of taste in art, music and poetry, the
pupil should be allowed to pursue his own
interests and to express himself creatively
without being subject to group pressures or
evaluations. There are times, too, when the ado-
lescent needs to work alone at a given problem.
But there are many activities which may pro-
vide experience of co-operation with others, such
as debates, panel discussions, the commemoration
Through group discussions children acquire habits
of mutual respect, tolerance, and co-operation-all
valuable assets to aid their understanding and
daily observation of the principles of Human Rights.
Many activities which involve
co-operation between home,
school and community can be
organized. In some schools, youth
councils have been formed to de-
termine the extent to which
Human Rights are enjoyed by all
who live in the community.
The role of the teacher In these
experiences is highly important.
He can join with the group in
planning and executing activities,
and should demonstrate through
his own personality and behaviour
the meaning of respect for Human
Rights.
Also it was felt pupils in the
15-18 age group could study the
text of the Declaration with profit.
They should be made thoroughly
familiar with its special, political,
and philosophical implication.
Whether this study should form
part of the civics, his. tory or social
sciences course was a matter for
those responsible for planning
curricula.
.. .. L- <In--------L1-. __-------.....But in the 15 to 18 age group there are many
who are not continuing with their schooling for
economic or other reasons. However, they too
need to be given opportunities to learn about the
Universal Declaration. The way to solve this
problem was to rely on youth organizations and
other voluntary agencies. Where such agencies
do not exist, the educational authorities should
assume responsibiilty.
A survey carried out in 13 countries by an
international federation of teachers'associations
. showed that, generally speaking, both the autho-
rities and the teachers are sympathetic towards
teaching about Human Rights. But in some
places there is still much to be done to remove an
all-too-frequent apathy or passive tolerance.
Teachers in one country reported :"We receive
neither encouragement nor discouragement from
the authorities or the children's families. What
We do meet is passive resistance, reinforced by a
superficial scepticism. Those who express it
point to existing situations in the world which
counter the Declaration's egalitarian theories".
Those in another country declared :"Teachers
here just cannot forget that many of their pupils
lead lives of terrible hardship, and that it is
difficult to teach respect for Human Rights to
children whose most elementary rights are not
respected."
Practical solutions have been suggested by
the Secretary-General of an international fede-
ration of teachers'associations, who declared :
"We have to win the support of the teachers,
first by giving them information, and then by
giving them help. Most teachers regard the task
as impossible, do not know where to begin, and
give up the attempt. They need to be provided
not only with literature on the subject, but also
with teaching aids suitable for young children.
"The task will take some time, and should be
undertaken jointly by the teachers'associations
and the teachers'training colleges. The respon-
sible authorities should be persuaded to give
encouragement, assistance, and, if necessary,
official instruction."

### 71257: The Universal Declaration and the average man

COURIER NOVEMBER 1952. Page 13
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION AND
THE AVERAGE MAN
Have you heard about the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights ?
Are there any rights which, in your
opinion, everyone should have, no matter
what his race, religion or country ?
Should education be made available to
everyone ?
Do you think the State should szWsidize
or maintain theatres arad museums ?
ONE Sunday morning this year, inter-
viewers went into the homes of
some 500 people in Cambridge
(England) and asked these questions and
some 20 similar ones. At about the same
time, in Upsala (Sweden) and Grenoble
(France), other interviewers were carrying
out the same sort of inquiry.
Putting these questions to representative
sections of chosen communities in three
countries was the first step in a Unesco-
sponsored survey, whose object was to
find out what people know about the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
what they think about its principles,
whether they believe these can be applied
in everyday life and, finally, whether the
methods used to make known the Decla-
ration are effective.
Polls of this type, often associated with
the name Gallup, have now become well-
known. More than one government has
used this barometer of public opinion to
measure its popularity and to estimate
likely reactions to measures it proposes to
take. Unesco decided to employ the
method so as to clarify one of its
important tasks-that of making the
Declaration widely known and understood.
The countries in which the polls were
carried out are in a part of the world
where traditions and cultures are espe-
cially favourable to a knowledge and
practice of these rights. In turn, each
of the towns selected can be said to
represent a typical cross-section of its own
country. Furthermore all the towns have
several common characteristics. They are
of average size, have some industry and
trade, attract tourists and possess univer-
sities which enjoy international reputations
and are attended by many foreign
students.
After the first poll was taken, a Human
Rights publicity campaign was launched.
This laid special emphasis on those rights
which are most closely linked with
Unesco's activities : freedom of opinion
and of expression and the rights to educa-
tion and culture The campaign lasted
several weeks and used a variety of media :
press, films, radio, posters, public
meetings, lessons in the schools and
lectures. Then, to measure the effects of
the campaign, a second poll, again
covering 500 people, was taken.
From an interrogation of 500 people
in their homes, it is possible to get a
good idea of the opinions of an entire
town, providing a representative group
has been chosen. This requires a selec-
tion from the points of view of age, sex,
marital status, profession and living
standards which will present a cross-
section of the community.
The professional public survey experts
who conducted the poll, assisted by teams
of volunteers, went straight to the point
of the enquiry, without mentioning
Unesco, the sponsoring body. A frank
conversation lasting for about half-an-hour
was generally sufficient to cover all the
items in the questionnaire which formed
the basis for the interview.
by Maxime C/ouzet
Opinions were obtained from a variety
of sources, which included housewives,
university professors, industrialists, civil
servants, workers and shopkeepers.
During both polls, a total of 3, 000
interviews took place in the three
countries. From the information thus
obtained it is possible, without going into
the details of the experts'analysis, to
draw several significant conclusions.
Generally speaking, the opinions
showed a lively and varied awareness, and
gave a clear indication of the relative
importance that is attached by different
people to one or other of the rights and
freedoms.
One of the first questions asked was
"When you hear the expression'Human
Rights', are there any rights you think of
first ?" Answers received during the first
poll are given below by percentages in
table A. (Certain people gave more than
one reply.)
Was it indifference that caused a large
number of people to give no answer to
this questions-43 per cent in Cambridge
and 40 per cent in Upsala ? Apparently
not, judging by later questions. Many
people may have been nonplussed by the
rather abstract phrasing of this question
at the start of an unexpected interro-
gation. The much lower percentage in
Grenoble, 14, was probably due to the fact
, could provide the means to ensure this
Opinion was 70 per cent affirmative in
Cambridge, 97 per cent in Upsala and
91 per cent in Grenoble that compulsory
elementary edncation should be introduced
among all peoples and races. To the
questions :"Do you think the authorities
should or should not subsidize certain
theatres, set up and maintain museums
and public libraries, look after historic
buildings and monuments and provide
recreation for workers ?" the affirmative
reply varied between 70 and 90 per cent,
and never dropped below 60 per cent.
As this showed, public interest is far
from being confined to the traditional
freedoms. It is greatly stimulated by the
economic and social rights which include
the right to education, to share in the
cultural life of the community, the right
to work, to social security and to a proper
standard of living.
The significant replies produced by the
poll would therefore seem to justify the
realistic attitude of the authors of the
Universal Declaration for their decision
to give a place in the document to these
"new"rights, and thus meet the aspi-
rations of modern man.
Another noteworthy result was the reac-
tion to the question :"'Are you mainly
satisfied or dissatisfied with the progress
made by the United Nations in the
that people. an this city are more familiar
with the conception of Human Rights and
with the expression itself, for it was here
that the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of
Man and of the Citizen had its origin.
The positive replies were on the whole
centralized on the three rights and free-
doms quoted in the first Table, which were
regarded as fundamental. These three
rights were also prominent in the replies
to the following question :"Is there any
right or freedom so indispensable that not
even Parliament should have the power
to abolish it ?"
When questions were put on precise
aspects of Human Rights, the picture
changed considerably. In both Grenoble
and Cambridge, 95 per cent of the people
thought that all clever children should
be able to get higher education, even if
their parents could not afford to pay.
Similarly, 90 per cent in Cambridge and
92 per cent in Grenoble thought the State
world ?" In Cambridge, 45 per cent were
satisfied and 32 per cent were not. The
percentages-in Upsala and Grenoble were
29 and 16, and 49 and 29 respectively.
Some of the results obtained through
the survey were deceptive ones. Probably
the most striking are indicated in Table
B above, which represent public reaction
to three principles.
These three questions were put in
quick succession so that the answers
came spontaneously, without people realiz-
ing the conclusions that could be drawn
by taking their replies literally. If they
are willing to admit theoretically the
equality of all men they are less ready
to accept all its practical consequences
when these come up against certain
fundamental attitudes or deeply ingrained
prejudices.
And while 77 per cent of those
questioned in Cambridge, 94 per cent of
those in Upsala and 74 per cent of those
in Grenoble recognized the same rights
for coloured people as they do for white,
there is a minority who, while conceding
the equality of rights, nevertheless retains
its prejudice concerning the racial super-
iority of the white peoples.
From the answers to three other
questions it would also appear that many
people are quick to demand freedom of
expression for themselves, but are not
always willing to concede it to others.
The interviewers began by asking :"Is
there any kind of opinions or prejudice
which makes you really furious, angry
or depressed ?" Then they asked :"What
steps do you think should be taken against
people who openly speak in favour of
opinions which you regard as really
inhuman ?"
There were 23 per cent in Cambridge,
37 per cent in Upsala and five per cent in
Grenoble who wanted to take measures
to render such people harmless, while,
the rest suggested either counter-pro-
paganda or doing nothing at all. But the
number of prohibitionists rose steeply
when the case of these undesirable
opinions being spread by the printed word
and through organized groups was put to
them.
As the report on the Cambridge survey
declares :"There is, therefore, a sizeable
minority of the public who would support
vigorous action against unpalatable views,
and tolerance does not have much
practical meaning for them."
The same questions as those already
described were put less than two months
later, under the same conditions, to see
what changes of opinions had resulted
through the publicity campaign. In some
ways, definite progress had been made.
The number of people who knew of the
existence of the Universal Declaration-
already fairly large at the first poll-
went up 11 per cent in Cambridge, five
per cent in Upsala and 15 per cent in
Grenoble. The proportion of favourable
replies on, for instance, the efforts made
for peace by the United Nations had
increased.
Another noticeable aspect, was the
change of opinion which brought people
ever from opposition to indecision after
some reflection on their previous ideas.
The view that there is too much
free, room found fewer supporters at the
second poll. And if the campaign did not
produce a marked effect on the most
firmly-held prejudices, it was encouraging
to see that the greatest influence was
made on young people aged between
16 and 24.
All in all, the results obtained were
satisfactory, bearing in mind the short
duration of the information campaign
and the limited resources possessed by the
United Nations Associations, which carried
them out.
Results from polls such as this give
practical guidance for the future to
organizations and individuals who, in the
fields of information and education, are
leading the fight to make the principles
of Human Rights a reality throughout the
world..
. :..
The survey described above was carried
out for Unesco by the British Institute of
Public Opinion, the Swedish Gallup
Institute, and the French Institute of
Public Opinion. The last.-named is to
undertake a collation of the results
obtained in the three countries.

### 71260: Helping nations to provide education for all; a world-wide task for UNESCO

### 71258: The Vitality of the Universal Declaration

Page 14. NOVEMBER 1952
THE VITALITY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
THROUGHOUT the long process of drafting, the. Universa)Declaration was a controyersial document, sharply
challenged in its general concept and textual details.
But the four years since its solemn adoption (without a single
dissentient vote) by a plenary session of the U. N. General
Assembly have obscured its controyersial character. Yet, in
effect, the controversy is still with us, albeit on a different
plane, the challenge today being no longer to the contents
of the Declamation, but to its value.
The United Nations is criticized for having spent so much
time and energy on a document which has no legally binding
force and has failed to redeem the high promises held out
by the Charter of the United Nations for the protection of the
individual through effective international machinery.
This line of criticism rests mainly on the grounds that, in the
drafting of those additional instruments which are designed
to lend legal force to the principles of the Declaration, very
real difficulties have been encountered. As a result, despite
continuing efforts, the rhythm of our progress towards a
genuine International Bill of Rights is still slow and uncertain.
The difficutties, which ore both political and technical, are
undeniable. The question is : do they reflect adyersely on
the conception and utility of the Universa) Declaration itself ?
In attempting to answer that question, we must first bear
in mind that the revolution intended by the Charter was,
by its nature, a long-term aHair. In its final implications,
that revolution aimed at a new type of relationship between
the individual and the State, between the individual and
international society, and between international society and
its component units.
We have never been entitled to hope that, even if condi-
tions had been normal (which they were not), these bold
initiatives could be accomplished within the short period that
has elapsed since the ratification of the Charter.
QECONDLY, the Universal Declaration was never meant tobring about, by itself, a spectacular improvement. It was
meant to turn the Charter into a more effective instrument
in the service of humanity. By the Charter, every State
which had joined the United Nations was pledged to promote,
by joint and separate action, universal respect for Human
Rights, and their observance ; but no State was pledged to
regard as"Human'Rights"any particular group of rights
other than that which it may already have recognized in its
own laws.
A wide gap was left open for the individual interpretation,
by each State, of its obligations. The Universal Declara-
tion was designed to narrow that gap by supplying a common
standard on which all national definitions of Human Rights
were gradually to converge.
Thirdly, in o matter so essentially political as the status of
by Dr. Andrew Martin
Lecturer on international affairs
at Ruskin Cohere, Oxford.
Human Rights, purely legol arguments are by no means
conclusive. As a matter of strict low, no State is, as yet,
under compulsion to adapt its national laws to the common
standards established by the Universal Declaration, even
though there is considerable force in the argument that no
Member of the United Nations is entitled to change its
existing laws in a manner that would amount to retrogression
from that standard.
A LL students of politics will agree that the conduct ofGovernments is not prompted solely by the pressure of
their obligations under international law ; likewise, the vitality
of the Declaration cannot be measured solely in terms of its
legally compulsive force. Its impact depends, first and
foremost, on its success in creating an effective demand for
the grant and observance of the rights that it proclaims.
Given an articulate demand, purposefully maintained in
each country by a growing number of individuals and groups,
and given unfailing support from the appropriate organs of
the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, the Declare-
tion is capable of exerting a vital influence on the legislative
and administrative programme of Governments.
It would have been wholly unreasonable to hope, particu-
larly in countries where political conditions are not favourable
to the rapid penetration of new political conceptions into the
consciousness of the masses, that so short a time as four
years would bring forth a pressing and articulate demand for
the Declaration being translated into actual governmental
programmes. And yet, even though the demand may not yet
be measurable everywhere, we are entitled to assume that it
is in the making.
The United Nations and Unesco have mobilized truly
impressive resources to assure that the Universal Declaration
should reach every stratum of human society, even in the
remotest parts of the globe. In this effort, they have
received generous assistance from many Governments and non-
governmental agencies, including a large number of trade
unions and religious organizations and the wide network of
United Nations Associations. The volume of evidence
showing the effect of these labours presents a more and
more encouraging picture every year.
The impetus of the campaign is immensely strengthened
by the activities of those organs of the United Nations which,
in their day-to-day work, have occasion to deal with concrete
problems affecting Human Rights. Their attitude may be
summed up in one sentence : they tend to treat the Universal
Declaration as a standard of conduct which is applicable here
and now, without waiting for the adoption of additional
international instruments.
That goes, in the first ploce, for the General Assembly
which, when confronted with actuoJ complaints relating to the
observance of Human Rights-for example, the treatment
of national minorities, the protection of immigrating tobour
from discriminatory practices, the rights of women to marry
foreign nationals and join them abroad-has time and again
inyoked the proyisions of the Universal Declaration in support
of recommendations calling for the liberalization of national
laws and practices.
Within their own respectiye spheres, the Economic and
Social Council and the Trusteeship Council have followed a
similar policy on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from the
principle of equal pay for equal work, the nationality of
married women and the prohibition of all forms of forced
labour, to the free flow of information through all frontiers
and the abolition of corporal punishment in trust territories.
The importance of this attitude adopted by organs of the
United Nations cannot be exaggerated. Their tendency to
treat the Universal Declaration as authoritative, regardless of
its lack of formally binding force, giyes a strong incentiye
to Governments to adopt a correspondingly positiye attitude.
Since 1948, new constitutions have been enacted in a
number of countries, notably in Indonesia, Costa Rico, Syria,
EI Salyador and Haiti ; on all these enactments the Decla-
ration has exerted an unmistakable influence, in some cases
to the point where the wording of the Declaration was
reproduced verbatim.
In other countries, including France, Western Germany and
Canada, the principles of the Declaration are clearly
reflected in certain new laws dealing with fair employment
practices, the status of displaced persons and other subjects.
A LL these examples point to the conclusion that, even duringthe first four years since its adoption, the Universal
Declaration has proved its worth as a potent ferment which
has a stimulating effect on the vitality of the body politic
into which it has been introduced. And yet, its beneficent
effect cannot be assessed solely in terms of achievements
in a positive direction.
We must not forget that, throughout the world, these past
four years have been a period of tension, danger and fear,
such as in the past almost invariably resulted in the severe
curtailment of fundamental freedoms.
If, during the past four years, we have been spared any
such distressing experience on a scale comparable with the
past, if, regardless of a mounting tension, we have been able
to maintain and in many instances to increase our standards
of political freedam and social justice, that is in no small
measure due to the impact of the Universal Declaration on
the minds of Governments and the governed.
A world-wide task for Unesco
HELPING NATIONS TO PROVIDE
EDUCATION FOR ALL
ONE half of mankind is still illite-rats. About the same proport on
of children of school age are
without schooling. Opportunities for
secondary and vocational education
are still limited in most countries.
These are the hard facts of the
world's educational situation. To claim
that they are at the root of all the
world's ills would be an exaggeration.
But what is true is that ignorance re-
sults in poverty, and poverty goes
hand-in-hand with disease.
To attack the inter-linked problems
of ignorance, poverty and sickness by
helping the people of underdeveloped
countries to improve their standards
of living is a task which Unesco has
undertaken in its pioneering work to
develop and extend Fundamental Edu-
cation for illiterate adults and children.
But the continuous tide of children
who grow up to be illiterate adults,
thus creating the need for Fundament-
al Education, can only be checked by
the provision of a regular school edu-
cation for all children in all countries.
It is this gross inequality in educa-
tional provisions throughout the
world which inspired Article 26 of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights."Everyone has the right to
education. Education shall be free, at
least in the elementary stages. Ele-
mentary education shall be compul-
sory".
One of Unesco's first acts in its pro-
gramme to promote free and compul-
sory education was to assist the Inter-
national Bureau of Education to carry
out an inquiry into this question in all
parts of the world. At the same time,
it made several national studies of its
own on compulsory education.
Three of these studies dealt with
countries where compulsory education
has been applied for some time : Eng-
land, France and Australia. The
other three had to do with countries
in various stages of applying compul-
sory education : Ecuador, Iraq and
Thailand. In addition, general studies
were written on the problem of rais-
ing the school leaving age, and on
child labour in relation to compulsory
education.
The immediately useful purpose of
these studies and reports was to assist
the International Conference on Public
Education, which chose free and com-
pulsory education as its main topic of
discussion when it met in Geneva last
year. Recommendations made by this
conference emphasized the importance
of long-term State planning of
compulsory education schemes.
The Conference also recommended
that the possibilities of obtaining in-
ternational aid be explored. To help
improve the attendance of poor
children called for such social welfare
measures as school meals, the pro-
vision of clothing and family allow-
ances.
It is not difficult to reach general
agreement on the advisability of tak-
ing such measures as these. And, in
fact, those States who are in the
advance guard of compulsory edu-
cation need little or no help and
advice in this fields.
But this is not the case of the"'less
advanced countries, which are still in
the majority, and which have not
yet established effective compulsory
education systems. These States,
while anxious to do so, are unable to
apply such measures in the immediate
future, because of lack of technical
knowledge or because of social or poli-
tical obstacles, but above all because
of the lack of financial and economic
resources.
They therefore tend to think of
compulsory education as a vague aim
to be realized in the very distant
future, and often take a kind of fatal-
istic view of the problem.
One of Unescos roles is to convince
these States that, if the full application
of free and compulsory education looks
distant, it can be brought nearer by
a more active policy of extending pri-
mary education and by better manage-
ment of resources, and that compul-
sory education schemes are best
formulated with other schemes for the
eccnomic development of the country.
It can offer technical assistance for
the planning and execution of such
schemes and, in some respects, its
campaign must take the form of a
crusade is which Member States and
educators are roused to a sense of
urgency, as well as to a realization of
the feasibility of compulsory education.
No such crusade, however, can be
effective unless it is based on a sound*
foundation of existing facts, and
unless steps are taken to ensure ade-
quate planning in this field. To ensure
this, Unesco makes use of four me-
thods : the preparation of studies and
publications about problems of free and
compulsory education, the holding of
regional conferences, the sending out
of missions or individual experts, and
the granting of fellowships and of
scholarships.
For example, Unesco has been pre-
paring for the Conference on Compul-
sory Education in South-East Asia and
the Pacific, which will be held in
Bombay next month. Thirteen Mem-
ber States have been invited to it-
Afghanistan, Australia, Cambodia, Cey-
lon, India, Indonesia, Laos, New Zea-
land, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand,
Union of Burma and Vietnam. One
non-Member State, Nepal, has been
asked to send an observer. Member
States responsible for the administra-
tion of territories in this region who
have also been invited are France, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
the United States.
One of the main questions to be
examined at this Conference will be
the preparation of compulsory educ-
ation curricula.
It has been shown that"academic"
curricula in primary schools have an
adverse effect on school attendance in
many countries. Parents, especially
poor parents in outlying districts, who
are in need of the labour of their
children, tend to think of most of
school instruction as a luxury, having
little to do with their everyday pro-
blems. They therefore withdraw their
children from school or do not send
them at all.
The technical and material needs of
countries in South-East Asia and the
Pacific will be examined as will the
questions of the status and training
of teachers. Countries will be asked :
"What programmes do you have, and
how can Unesco help you to achieve
them ?"Emphasis will be laid on the
need for the drawing up of schemes
of compulsory education even though
they may not be fully effective for
some time.
By such activities as these, Unesco
is giving international educational
assistance to those countries that re-
quest it in order to turn the principle
of education for all into a reality.

### 71259: The Right to information

OURIER NOVEMBER 1952. Page t5
THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION
ONE of man's most cherished rights is to be able to hold opinionsand to express them. Yet this right which, in the words of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, includes
"freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive
and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers"is far from generally enjoyed in the world
today.
In the present state of international affairs, political differences
are raising serious barriers to the realization of this right. There
are, however, broad areas of human need and activity outside the
directly political sphere in which much can be done to lessen
impediments to freedom of information.
It is here that Unesco has been active in trying to remove the
obstacles which hinder the passage across frontiers of books,
newspapers, press despatches and, in general, knowledge and ideas.
One of Unesco's major initiatives was the Agreement on the
Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials which
recently came into force.
Another was the Universal Copyright Convention, signed by
the representatives of 35 nations in Geneva last September. This
agreement supplements international copyTig-ht law, broadening
and strengthening the scope of existing bilateral and multilateral
instruments already in effect.'
Unesco has also been striving to relieve the crisis arising from
the shortage and maldistribution of newsprint and of paper for
books and publications. One of its proposals, calling for the
lowering of postal rates on newspapers and publications, was
adopted by the Universal Postal Convention last May.
In another field, Unesco has been working to promote the free
movement of persons engaged in educational, scientific and cultural
activities. It has called on governments to assist this movement
by reducing transport costs, passport and frontier formalities and
has urged the granting of fellowships and travel grants, particularly
for students, teachers and scientists.
To illustrate some of the obstacles which are still raised against
the right to information we present on this page two pictographs.
The first shows the unequal distribution throughout the world of
radio sets, cinema seats and daily newspapers ; the other indicates
the customs duties which hinder the free flow of information
across frontiers.
Press, Film, Radio
Pictograph shows the number of copies of daily newspapers, the
number of radio sets and the number of cinema seats that are
available to every 100 people in the different parts of the world.
Customs duties
Black bands symbolize frontiers. The
smaller the openings in them, the more
difficult it is (because of duties) to pass
books, radio set and newsreels into the
44 countries represented in the pictograph.
The figure immediately underneath the
openings indicates the number of coun-
tries in each group. The word"free"ap-
pears over countries which allow in books
or newsreels without demanding duty.

### IGNORE

During the last few years the peoples of
South-East Asia have been courageously
and successfully tackling tremendous eco-
nomic and social problems which, in many
cases, their new-found political independence
has thrust upon them. It is true that famines
and epidemics have not been banished from
this part of the world, nor has there been a
sweeping decrease in illiterary. But every
day some progress is made towards the
achievement of better standards of living-
that is to say, towards a realization of the
principles proclaimed in the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights. Infant mortality,
rates, once so high, are now decreasing
steadily, thanks to measures taken by govern-
ments aided by the Specialized Agencies of
the United Nations. It is to be hoped that
one day this young Hindu can truly say :
"I was born in the century of Human Rights."
