Nostalgia for nature
A nostalgia for placid pools and wild foliage haunts the landscapes of Henri Rousseau (1844-1910)
called the douanier, from his profession of customs official. He painted this work, "In the Forest"
(Zurich Museum, Switzerland) in 1886. That year, Rousseau, a self-taught, "week-end" painter
exhibited his works for the first time at the Paris Salon des Indépendants. Within a few years,
poets and painters were hailing the primitive yet modern qualities of Rousseau's painting.

Noise is one of the scourges of the
modern world, an unwanted product of
our technological civilization increasingly
polluting our daily life. To the din that
assails us in streets, offices and facto¬
ries and even our homes, a new noise
will soon be added: the reverberating
boom of supersonic jet airliners. We
are paying, in nervous strain, noise-
induced deafness and other physical
and mental ills, the price of faster
transport and an "easier" life. Yet ways
can be found to halt the noise invasion
and mitigate its harmful effects.

OISE has always been
with us, but never has it been so
obvious, so intense, so varied and so
pervasive as it is today.
Modern life has been made easier
by numerous technological innova¬
tions, but some of the side-effects
make progress as a whole seem prob¬
lematical and indeed, in some res¬
pects more like regression. In addition
to the serious problems of air pollution
and water pollution we now have to
contend with "noise pollution" in many
forms.
Unlike the lucky few who can spend
their lives far from the clamour of
our technological age, most people, at
least in industrial areas, are obliged
to live and work under conditions in
which noise often attains an alarming
level. In the home, children are unable
to sleep or are suddenly aroused by
the roar of a passing aircraft or the
din of a noisily revving automobile.
Older people also suffer from these
disturbances. Deprived of a proper
night's sleep in a well-ventilated room,
many people are unable to recuperate
the physical and mental energy they
have used up at work and will need
again next day. They try to shut out

noise by keeping windows closed or
wearing ear plugs. And even then they
cannot be sure of sleeping undis¬
turbed.
Next morning they have to face
another day of hard work, often in
noisy surroundings, which means that
more nervous energy is burned up in
resisting the stress of no se, instead
of being used productively.
Insufficient rest and relaxation inevi¬
tably reduce efficiency. Noise, in fact,
causes an incalculable loss of nervous
energy to the detriment of the health
and well-being of the individual and
ultimately to the detriment of the
national economy as a whole.
Although these facts have been
confirmed by studies and research in
Switzerland and many other countries,
a few people still maintain that until
noise "has turned a grey mouse into
a white one", all that has been affirm¬
ed about the effects of noise is merely
theoretical and therefore inconclusive.
Such persons are merely side-track¬
ing the problem. It is just as though
the painstaking research on noise that
has been going on over the past ten
years, leading in each case to iden¬
tical conclusions, has been a complete
waste of time.
Yet anyone who observes present-
day conditions of life not only in our
cities, but increasingly in the country¬
side too, can see for himself the direct
and indirect effects of incessant noise
on modern man: nervous troubles,
reduced powers of concentration, in¬
efficient work, increasing absenteeism,
among others.
These few examples give us a
general idea of the present state of
affairs. How did we come to be in
such a situation? Primarily because
social and legal measures were not
taken to prevent it, and for the failure
to act in time the public authorities
bear the major responsibility. For far
too long the spread of noise was
accepted as a natural process, as a
price to be paid for our technological
progress. Law, justice and public
authorities all capitulated to techno¬
logy.
In such a situation the average per¬
son tended to feel, and to become,
helpless. The first wave of protests
gave way to resignation. People
shrugged their shoulders and said
"There's nothing we can do about it".
But just over ten years ago orga¬
nizations were set up in a number of
European countries to wage campaigns
against the spread of noise. These
bodies, whose organizers were often
eminent doctors, jurists, engineers and
specialists in acoustics, decided to
unite their action and in 1959 formed
the International Association Against
Noise. The Association has so far
held four important congresses on
noise abatement (Zurich, 1960; Salz¬
burg, 1962; Paris, 1964; Baden-Baden,

The growing anti-noise movement
1966) and will hold its fifth congress
in London early next year.
It is all very well to set up orga¬
nizations and hold congresses and
meetings in different countries but
what practical results have been
achieved by all this? Here are a few
examples:
By stimulating new activities, meet¬
ings and congresses have given an
impetus to basic research and have
promoted progress, often of outstand¬
ing value. But it obviously takes more
than a few years to eliminate even
the major part of all the noise
that has been accumulated by the
unbridled expansion of technology
over several decades. Achievements
during the past ten years in acoustics,
sound-proofing techniques and the
introduction of anti-noise regulations
have nevertheless been remarkable.
Each of the congresses of
the International Association Against
Noise has enabled over 500 specialists
to exchange ideas, pool their expe¬
rience and establish fruitful contacts
on both the personal and scientific
levels.
Since its foundation and especially
on the occasion of its four congresses
the Association has established con¬
tacts with major international organiza¬
tions, including the United Nations
Office in Geneva, the World Health
Organization, the Council of Europe,
the European Conference of Ministers
of Transport and the International
Organizations for Standardization. It
also works closely with other organi¬
zations concerned with anti-noise cam-

On a scale graduated in decibels, this
"noise barometer" in a street in Zurich
(Switzerland) shows passers-by how much
noise nearby traffic is making. The decibel
is a unit used to measure different inten¬
sities of sound and is calculated from the
level at which sound becomes audible to
the human ear. But neither the subjective
impression of noise perceived by the ear
nor the degree of disturbance it causes
can be measured with precision on the
decibel scale. The 50-decibel change of
intensity between the noise of people
conversing and the rustling of leaves (see
scale, left) is far less noticeable than the
50-decibel gap between the same conversa¬
tion and the noise of a jet engine. High
frequency (high-pitched) sounds grate on
the ear more than those with a low pitch.
paigns, and its specialists are fre¬
quently consulted on major problems
and decisions in the field of noise
abatement.
Since its directorate has always
comprised a physician, an engineer, a
specialist in acoustics and two jurists,
the International Association is in a
position to give prompt and authori¬
tative opinions on questions of inter¬
national scope within its field.
If the problem of noise is to be
resolved several factors will have to
be kept constantly in mind:
Although the campaign against
noise is a global problem, its starting
point must be the individual. An
individual effort to overcome egotism
is a prerequisite of any collective anti-
noise campaign. Anyone unable to
make this effort of self-restraint and
incapable of recognizing the real
meaning of technical creativity, is
already a victim of the technological
era along with its unwanted products:
noise and the pollution of air and
water.
Noise and reflection are mutually
exclusive. Noise is an obstacle to
brainwork and can easily disrupt a
vital train of thought.
It would be wrong to blame techno¬
logy for all the noise, past and
present, that has afflicted man. Tech¬
nology as such is neither good nor
bad. It is the men behind it who
are responsible for noise, and it is
for them to seek the remedies. As
Professor Günther Lehmann, President
of the International Association Against
Noise has said, "Noise is not a mea¬
sure of the progress of technology,
but a sign of regression".
When it comes to doing something
practical about excessive noise, it is
clear that most people are unwilling
to take the initiative. Noise can be
tackled with some hope of success
only with the backing of public opinion
and proper laws and regulations.
Law-making is therefore a vital factor
in anti-noise campaigns.
But laws are effective only when
they are rigorously enforced. And
public interest in anti-noise campaigns
usually needs arousing, since many
people, even the well-educated, fail to
realize the harm that permanent and
excessive noise can do to the human
organism.
To stimulate this interest, effective
public information campaigns are
needed, based on the authoritative
scientific data collected in the past
ten years by national and international
bodies, whose members include many
distinguished specialists.

### 8893: Down with decibels

Sound echos down a narrow
street as youngsters speed along
on motorized bicycles. A sign of
youthful high spirits, perhaps, but
disturbing for the neighbourhood.
According to some studies,
one reason why teen-agers enjoy
making so much noise with
motorscooters and similar
vehicles is that it gives them
a feeling of power.
One example is the report submitted
to the Swiss Government in 1963 by
specialists in the Swiss Federal Anti-
Noise Commission. Its conclusions,
by the way, agree with those present¬
ed to the U.K. Parliamant the same
year by the British Committee on the
Problem of Noise.
The Swiss Anti-Noise Commission is
composed of 52 specialists and its
studies and research are carried out
by five sub-commissions dealing with
basic medical, acoustic and technical
questions; road, rail, sea and river
traffic; aircraft noise; noise in industry,
building construction, homes etc; and
legal questions.
Their work has enabled encouraging
progress to be made in Switzerland.
Public indifference to the increase of
noise is gradually disappearing. More
vigorous legal and administrative ac¬
tion is being taken against persons
failing to comply with noise regula¬
tions. An official research, testing and
advisory centre (the Acoustics and
Anti-Noise Division of the Federal
Materials Testing Institute, af Düben¬
dorf, near Zurich) has been set up.
The "maximum noise level" scales
established by the Swiss Anti-Noise
Commission have also been of great
value (see below)-
Figures are given in decibels (dB,
the measurement unit for noise). A
level of 80-85 dB is what is normally
expected from the continuous noise in
a busy main street of a large city.
These maximum noise levels have
been accepted by the Swiss courts.

Like those already in force for auto¬
mobiles in many countries, the Swiss
maximum noise levels are easier to
enforce nowadays thanks to technical
advances in noise prevention during
the past ten years.
In building construction, for example,
relatively silent machines have taken
over the job of foundation digging
from the far noiser pile-divers, electro¬
mechanical drills replace the clattering
compressed-air variety and special
screens now absorb the din of com¬
pressors.
Automobile noises can be reduced
by the more effective exhaust mufflers
now available and also by non-slam
doors and boot lids.
Much can be done to reduce the din
of aircraft. Already some have been
fitted with silencers and further im¬
provement has come from the installa¬
tion at airports of acoustic check posts
and sound-proofed hangars for testing

flying regulations has also played its
part.
Sound absorbing materials, drapes,
curtains and carpets which deaden
noise, quieter air-conditioners, venti¬
lators and other household appliances,
and sound-insulated ceilings, walls,
doors and windows all help to make
the home a quieter and more restful
place.
Combating noise is above all a
question of showing consideration for
others and of the right kind of
upbringing. It thus has to begin in
the home as part of the education of
children and adolescents.
To sum up, it seems certain that our
present understanding of the problem
of noise coupled with our technical
knowledge and resources now give
us the means to bar the way to distur¬
bances from noise. But those who
undertake this task will need great
courage and determination, since many
people still fail to recognize the real
importance of anti-noise campaigns,
especially those who rate technical
progress higher than ethical values.
A current example of this attitude
is the effort now being made by the
aeronautical industry to pursuade us
that we shall enjoy the din of
supersonic airliners. Public relations
machinery and techniques are working
on an unsuspecting public with the
slogan "learn to live with the boom".
But booms and bangs are incompatible
with daily life. Anyone who cannot
see this is gambling with nature,
instead of living in harmony with it.

THE ARCHITECTS
OF SILENCE
by Constantin Sframentov
In the construction of many modern buildings, too little attention
is paid to the problem of excluding city noises and those that echo
from floor to floor within the building. Yet effective sound-proofing
techniques exist and in many countries organizations have been
set up to encourage their use and improve their efficiency. It
is up to town planners, architects, local authorities and city
dwellers to insist on the use of proper sound proofing so as to
make the home a peaceful refuge from the rush, bustle
and noise of modern life.

O we need absolute si¬
lence? Those who have ever remained
for any time in a sound-proof chamber
know what a horrifying experience it
is. Absolute silence is contrary to
nature, an artificial creation of our
century. All of us at one time or
another have described a particularly
intense silence as "terrifying".
It is easy to imagine how dangerous
a completely silent car would be. It
would cause far more serious trouble
than the disturbing throb of its engine,
which our ear associates spontane¬
ously with the approach of danger.
Surprisingly then, noise has the dual
character of being both harmful and
useful.
When they produced that noisy
plaything, the automobile, for man's
gratification, Daimler and Benz cer¬
tainly never suspected that their gift
was to be, in a sense, the Trojan horse
of our civilization. We are now paying
a high price for the satisfaction of
having faster ways of transport: we
have to live constantly with the infer¬
nal din of motor traffic. Once again,
as so often happens, man is the victim
of progress, the slave of his own
invention.
So harmful is noise that it can some¬
times kill. The hooting of a car sym¬
bolizes this mortal danger. The noise
made by a motor horn two yards away
is estimated at 95-100 phons. It has
been established that man's visual
reaction drops by 25% when the noise
level rises to 90 phons. The possible
consequences of this need no ela¬
boration.
What, in fact, we are combating is
not so much noise as such (in acous¬
tics, all sounds are termed noise) as
its dual character. We are trying to
abolish noises that are harmful to
human beings, but not to get rid of all
noises, since this would deprive man
of a vital source of information. Radio,
CONSTANTIN STRAMENTOV of the
U.S.S.R. is an architect specializing In town
planning. He has written many studies on
urban development, particularly on arrange¬
ments for road traffic and the control of
noise in cities.

Absolute silence is no more welcome than uproar.
Anyone shut inside the sound-proof chamber
of an acoustics laboratory (below) quickly becomes
disturbed by slight sounds such as the beating
of his heart and pulse, his breathing and even
the movement of his eyelashes. These normally
imperceptible noises are heard with an intensity
that would» produce serious psychological effects
on anyone who stayed in the chamber for long.

ARCHITECTS OF SILENCE (Continued)
Using noise
to cancel

10
for instance, is a useful noise, while
music is simply a pleasant one.
In this article we shall often use the
word "phon" so it would perhaps be
as well to explain briefly what is meant
by the measurement of sound.
The physical unit for measuring the
intensity of sound is the decibel. But
the number of decibels does not give
us a precise idea of the receptivity of
the human ear. So we also have to
use a physiological unit, corresponding
to the subjective .perception of sound
by the average human ear. This unit
is the "phon".
The phon is the smallest variation
of sound perceptible to the human ear.
And the range of audible sounds bet¬
ween the threshold of audibility and
the point at which sound causes pain
is generally estimated as 120 phons.
The twentieth century has been
marked by the relentless invasion of
noise into everyday life. Yet no city
deserves to be called "modern" so
long as the sleep of its citizens is dis¬
turbed by the rumble of passing trucks.
In the daytime conditions are different
and the infernal roar of thousands of
automobiles crowding our streets and
highways scarcely bothers us at all.
It has become so familiar that it
seems to be merely a drone in the
background, especially since the in¬
crease in noise from1 year to year has
been fairly slow, as though to give us
time to become accustomed to it.
But now, in the 1960s, it has attained a
level of 80 phons on our main
thoroughfares. Here, to give a better
idea of what this represents, are some
figures for other sounds:
rustling grass ..	 10 phons
noise inside a light
vehicle 	 35-55 phons
normal noise inside a
house 	 40-50 phons
a moving tram 	 70 phons
motor cycle with silen¬
cer 	, 90 phons
pneumatic hammer at a
distance of 30 feet. . 100 phons
To take an extreme example, there
is the sad story of the metal pail which
was left by mistake inside a room used
for testing jet engines. Within a cer¬
tain time it had completely disintegrat¬
ed due to the sound vibrations set up
by the roaring engines.
Another point to remember is that
N
the range of sounds perceptible to the
human ear is relatively limited. On
either side of this spectrum are infra¬
sounds and ultra-sounds that we do
not perceive. And tests have shown
that inaudible noise, like an invisible
enemy, is even more deadly than the
noise we hear. However, enemy No. 1
is still the noise within the 0 to
120 phon spectrum.
James Watt (1736-1819) the British
engineer, once rightly remarked that
to uneducated persons noise is sug¬
gestive of power. A machine which
operates silently or without vibration is
obviously far less impressive than a
noisy one.
Some people still imagine that the
more noise there is, the more work is
being done. But tests made in post
offices, for instance, showed that when
noise increased from 75 to 95 deci¬
bels, productivity immediately dropped
Photo © Omnia, Bern
by 25 per cent, and mistakes made in
sorting mail increased four-fold.
Acousticians then placed sound-dead¬
ening screens between the employees,
reducing noise by between four and
five decibels, and even this small
reduction raised productivity by 5 per
cent. When noise was further reduc¬
ed by between 10 and 15 decibels,
productivity rose by 18 per cent.
The familiar exclamation, "Don't
make a noise", or "Quiet please" can
be translated into scientific terminology
as follows: "My work demands great
concentration and I must therefore pre¬
serve the connective functions of my
cerebral cortex. I cannot afford to
weaken the inhibitory processes and I
have to preserve the working capacity
of my nervous system."
Research of various kinds as well
as statistics show the harm caused by
noise as:

and mishaps at work

responsible for hearing losses of

inimical to working efficiency
The campaign against noise cannot
be waged in isolation. The biggest
source of noise is transport (at least
in towns) and town-planners and
acousticians everywhere are confront¬
ed with more or less the same prob¬
lems.
In the Soviet Union the anti-noise
campaign is being promoted on three
fronts:
in hygiene and public health, through
studies of industrial working condi¬
tions, research into the effects of
noise on human beings and the
enforcement of noise control mea¬
sures;
in architectural planning, through the
use of more rational layouts for
towns and built-up areas, and
building and architectural studies,
including research into new methods
of sound-proofing houses;
in technology, through the develop¬
ment of new muffling techniques
and the manufacture of more effi¬
cient sound-proofing materials.
In modern industrial planning, in
metallurgy for instance, noise levels
often influence the design of a factory,
the various departments being arrang¬
ed according to the intensity of noise
they are likely to produce. The noiser
the workshop, the more massive the
noise insulating walls around it and the
more complex the screening devices.
In some cases operations are super¬
vised from observation posts. Other
arrangements to reduce the effects of
noise include remote-control posts,
closed-circuit television and special
rest rooms for workers.
Rolling mills are always controlled
from completely sound-proof cabins.
Workshops for assembling and testing
engines, where the noise cannot be
stifled at source, are isolated by heavy
screens and test benches are operated
automatically by remote control.
In the U.S.S.R. action has been
taken against abusive noise on a broad
administrative front. Regulations forbid
the use of certain vehicles on specified
routes and of noisy vehicles at night.
In August 1956 the use of motor horns
was made illegal in Moscow and the
noise level in the streets immediately
dropped by eight to ten phons. Since
then the steady increase in traffic has
to some extent cancelled out the bene¬
ficial effects of this regulation.
In our age of specialization, a new
technician has appeared in the field
of town planning and construction: the
expert who deals with the practical
problems of acoustics. Architects,
builders and acousticians now co¬
operate in planning how best to use
our urban living space.
To reconcile all the factors involved
is not easy. Controversies arise
between constructors and acousticians
on the one hand and automobile
industry engineers on the other. It has
also been found that modern architec¬
ture does not always satisfy the needs
of acoustics. The vast, flat surfaces of
modern buildings, it appears, are
acoustically less suitable for cities
than the tortuous carved stone of
"Baroque" architecture which diverts
noise and rapidly reduces its intensity.
Squares are usually thought to be
the noisiest places in a town, yet
tests show surprisingly that they are
less noisy than streets. City streets
may be likened to canals, with houses
acting as walls, between which all
sounds continue to reverberate until
they finally die out. In squares the
extra space helps to disperse the
sound waves which are also absorbed
by trees and gardens.
Ideally, noise should be eliminated

at its source, but this is not yet practic¬
able, so for the moment efforts are
made to localize it by every means.
A miniature town, for testing tech¬
niques designed to eliminate the
scourge of modern city noise, has
been built on the banks of the Volga
River. The sources of urban noise
re-created in this artificial city provide
researchers with reliable data on
which to work and conditions in which
the vulnerable points can be identified.
Town planning in the Soviet Union
complies strictly with the principle of
separating industrial and residential
areas, and in this way city dwellers are
spared the harassment of excessive
noise.
Satellite towns without factories
have also been built and town planning
methods devised to reduce the vol¬
ume of noise, particularly by adapting
the design of main streets to the needs
of the buildings flanking them.
Reconstruction and renovation of
cities offer opportunities for eliminating
or reducing many sources of noise.
Green spaces and protective screens
are incorporated in street designs so
as to surround buildings with a "wall
of silence".
Such solutions, with the exception
of the planting of trees, can hardly be
said to improve the appearance of a
town. The acoustician, working in this
case not with the architect but in oppo¬
sition to him, conceals the buildings
behind a screen. So what is there left
for the architect to do except to seal
the windows hermetically and use
thicker panes. And that implies the
installation of air-conditioning itself
a source of noise.
So the answer is to reach a compro¬
mise. The appearance of a town
cannot be sacrificed to meet the
demands of acoustics, yet acoustics
must be taken into account for the
sake of the health and tranquility of the
inhabitants.
Some people are always hopeful
that a scientific innovation will come
along to solve the problem. Physicists,
for instance, propose using one evil to
suppress another. As an antidote to
noise they suggest using electronic
apparatus whose loud speakers would
emit sound waves with oscillations of
the same amplitude as that of the
unwanted noise, but in inverse phase.
The resulting interference, they say,
would wipe out the noise.
Whatever methods are used, the
"music" of town noises has to be re¬
written completely and rendered, if not
truly harmonious, at least acceptable
to the human ear.
With supersonic commercial airliners
designed for speeds up to 1,800 m.p.h.
(2.7 times the speed of sound) now

construction, the day is not far off
when millions of people will be
faced with the problem of sonic
booms. This striking photo was taken

panied by disaster. A noisy bearing
or a shrieking cutting tool signaled
mechanical failure in the factory. The
piercing shout of a fellow worker was
a prime factor in preservation of life
on a construction job.
Historically, noise has been a ser¬
vant to man. But in the last quarter
century, noise has fallen from a posi¬
tion of usefulness to one of nuisance.
Modern technology has furnished its
own fanfare an ever-increasing din
that disturbs our sleep, interrupts our
conversation, creates anxiety and
annoyance, and sometimes damages
hearing.
Advancing civilizations will create
more noise, not less. Of that, we are
certain. In all probability, the noise
level will grow not only in urban cen
tres, but, with increasing population
and the proliferation of machines, noise
will invade the few remaining havens
of silence in' the world. A century
from now, when a man wants to escape
to a quiet spot, there may be no place
left to go.
We probably could not reverse the
trend, even if we tried; so we must
view the problem not as one of elimi¬
nating noise, but rather of controlling
it. Science alone is not the answer.
Our most troublesome noise problems
carry price tags; economic considera¬
tions must be weighed against people's
desire for culture and "the good life."

balance is struck in the political arena.

TRAFFIC NOISE (Continued)
One truck twice as noisy as a steady flow of cars
system, with maintaining a reasonable
tax rate, and with guarding the nation's
position in the marketplace of the
world. The science, economics, and
politics of several of our most impor¬
tant noise problems are the subjects of
this paper.
Sensational stories of the effects of
loud noises on the well-being of man
are often printed in the popular press.
The noises of daily life have been
blamed for increases in the divorce
rate, social conflict, indigestion, inab¬
ility to perform tasks with the limbs,
or eyes, nervous breakdowns, high
blood pressure, heart failure, and even
insanity.
Most of these allegations are the
products of vivid imaginations. Of
course, one cannot rule out the pos¬
sibility that a few people are par¬
ticularly sensitive to noise, just as
some are allergic to nuts, eggs, or
ordinary dust. But controlled social
observations have indicated that the
most important biological effects o>
loud noises are: hearing impairment,
interference with speech communica¬
tion; interference by distraction with
mental or skill work; interference with
sleep; and a feeling of general an¬
noyance.
&

lURVEYS conducted in Cen¬
tral London, near London airport, and
in several American cities both near
and far from military air bases have re¬
vealed some interesting statistics. Of
the thousands of people interviewed,
about one-fourth of those present in
any stratum of noise intensity seem
to be unperturbed by their noise envi¬
ronment.
These people apparently could and
often do live happily next to elevated
train routes, trucking routes, aircraft
flight paths, or other very noisy acti¬
vities. About a tenth of those inter¬
viewed seem to be disturbed by most
any audible noise not of their own
-making, regardless of level. These
same people were dissatisfied with
many other things in their environment.
It appears that fear of safety for
children near traffic routes and fear of
air crashes increases people's sensi¬
tivity to these respective types of
noise. Personal differences owing to
age, sex, income, education, occupa¬
tion, and so forth, do not seem to be
very significant. Of those in areas
with a specific loud noise, about one-
third said that they tend to get used
to the noise, while about one-fourth
said they are bothered more by the
noise as time goes on.
Carefully controlled tests performed
in laboratories and with pilots of air¬
craft indicate that noise alone does not
affect people's ability to reason, to do
mathematical exercises, or to control
flight (using flight trainers, with and
without loud cockpit noise.)
Nevertheless, we should not dismiss
annoyance as a figment of the imagi¬
nation. Some physiologists assert that
annoyance should be considered as a
biological protective mechanism, induc¬
ing man to avoid noise and to seek
recovery processes. The biological
meaning of annoyance may be compa¬
rable to other feelings of discomfort
like fatigue, hunger, cold or warm sen¬
sations.
The clip-clop of horses and the
rumbling of carriages in an earlier day
were quiet enough to be romantic.
Traffic noise was no real problem so
long as people were forced to content
themselves with these slow means of
transportation.
Today's urban noise is largely the
result of people's insatiable desire to
reach distant places ever more rapidly
and comfortably. As we have deve¬
loped faster ways to transport our¬
selves and our commercial goods, we
have created a noise nuisance that is
becoming increasingly difficult to live
with.
Cars, buses, trains, trucks, and air¬
planes are a necessary part of our
lives. It does not follow, however, that
all the noise created by these machines
must also be a part.
Which noises are the most trouble¬
some to the inhabitants of a city? The
1,400 people interviewed in a British
survey were asked, among other
things in a questionnaire, "If you could
change just one of the many things
you don't like about living around here,
which would you choose?" They res¬
ponded as follows:
Noise was mentioned as often as
slums, dirt, smoke, public facilities,
transport, government, and the
amount of traffic.
About one-third of the total samp¬
ling specifically mentioned motor-
vehicle traffic noise as one of its
major irritants.
Four to seven times as many people
were disturbed by the noise of road
traffic as by the noise of aircraft,
trains, or industry.
Traffic noise appeared to be as im¬
portant an annoyance as all other
noises together, including the noi¬
ses of aircraft, trains, industry, con
struction and demolition, domestic
appliances, neighbours, children,
radio and television, bells, alarms,
and pets.
People tolerate greater intensities
of continuous noise than they do of
intermittent noise. Also they tol¬
erate higher (but less-frequent)
levels of noise from aircraft than
lower (but nearly continuous) levels
of noise from automobiles.
Similar surveys of occupants of
apartment buildings in Rotterdam and
The Hague, Netherlands, revealed that
25 per cent were annoyed by traffic
sounds; 12 per cent by children play¬
ing; and 10 per cent by doors slam¬
ming. There is, of course, a close rela¬
tion between annoyance and the loca¬
tion of the building. The Netherlands
survey also indicated that:
Noise nuisance is greatest in homes
where children must study in the
evenings or where adults read ex¬
tensively or engage in self-educa¬
tion.
Noise nuisance decreases with in¬
crease in family size and increases
as the children grow older.
Based on these fairly representative
surveys, it is abundantly clear that a
city's first efforts to produce quieter
living must be directed at reducing
noise from traffic.
T
HE steady flow of pass¬
enger-car traffic alone would not
necessarily be irritating. Many new
cars are equipped with good exhaust
silencers and quiet tyre treads. Cities
and highway builders have it in their
power to choose quiet road surfaces.
The real trouble lies with trucks, buses,
motorcycles, and sports cars. The
average truck at 60 miles per hour is
about twice as noisy as a steady
stream of automobile traffic. Further,
truck noise is more irritating than this
difference indicates because trucks
pass less often and the loud burst of
noise that results is distracting and
annoying. The same holds for sports
cars, motorcycles, and buses.
Many old cars are more noisy than
new ones, usually due to deteriora¬
tion of exhaust mufflers. Lack of
shielding of engine noise and inade¬
quate mufflers are common on trucks
of all ages.
The British Government is consider¬
ing a law that would require all new
passenger cars and trucks to have
noise levels lower than 85 dBA.

against the lower tones in a noise,
much as a person does when judging
the "noisiness" of a sound). Motor¬
cycles and other mechanically propell¬
ed two-wheeled vehicles would be
limited to levels below 90 dBA.
The acoustical test for British auto¬
mobiles requires measurement of the
noise at a point 25 ft from the centre¬
line of the lane in which the vehicle
travels for three different operating
conditions:
constant speed of 30 mph in top
gear;
starting from a steady speed of
30 mph and (beginning 32 ft before
passing the test microphone) accel¬
erating as rapidly as possible over a
distance of 65 ft; and
maintaining a constant speed of
30 mph at full throttle with brakes
applied. The highest noise level
obtained under these three condi¬
tions of test is used to rate the
vehicle.
The State of California has proposed
legislation which would prohibit noise
levels in excess of 82 dBA, for passen¬
ger cars, and 92 dBA, for heavy trucks
and for trucks and buses at posted
highway speeds or the maximum speed
of the vehicle.
In France, maximum permissible
noise levels, determined under the
British test regime, are 83 dBA for
passenger cars and small trucks,
86 dBA for motorcycles, and 90 dBA
for large trucks and buses.
In Switzerland, maximum permissible
noise levels, measured laterally in an
open field at a distance of seven metres
with full engine power, are 80 dBA for
passenger cars, 85 dBA for two-stroke
motorcycles and 90 dBA for 4-stroke
motorcycles, large trucks, and buses.
Hit-or-miss municipal and state laws
designed to control the noise of sur¬
face transportation generally are not
effective. Trucking today is largely
between countries or states. The in¬
creased costs of providing and main¬
taining adequate mufflers and engine
covers are such that compliance with
noise laws will be assured only if they
are international (in Europe) or national
(in large countries such as Brazil,
U.S.S.R., or U.S.A.) and apply to all
vehicles.
Traffic noise, serious as it may be,
disturbs only a relatively narrow strip
of property on either side of the right-
of-way. To those who complain of the
nuisance, there is a reasonable reply.

TRAFFIC NOISE (Continued)

acres. The increasing popularity of
helicopters promises to pose new prob¬
lems. Heliports, uniformly distributed
throughout a city, would affect all resi¬
dents.
With the advent of supersonic air¬
craft, nobody in a nation can be sure
of freedom from sonic booms. A
nation could, of course, refuse super¬
sonic aircraft entrance into its air
space, and restrict the operations of
high-powered and, hence, noisy air¬
craft to isolated areas. But this is
hardly a practical solution for nations
ever more dependent on large aircraft
for commerce, travel, and defence.
We must search for other answers.
How much aircraft noise is too
much? Attempts have been made on
a number of occasions, in the Federal
Republic of Germany, the Netherlands
England and the United States, to de¬
termine a relation between PNdB
(adjusted for the number of flights per
day) and the "annoyance" of aircraft
noise as judged by residents under
flight paths near airports. (PNdB is the
perceived-noise-level in decibels, which
takes into account the individual judg¬
ment of the loudness of different types
of noises.)
It appears that there is a significant
degree of dissatisfaction with aircraft
noise whenever the average value of
the maximums of the flyover noise
exceeds about 115 PNdB (assuming
20 to 40 flyovers each day during day¬
time hours).
The British Ministry of Aviation has
specified maximum permissible noise
levels in the main built-up areas
around the London airport for jet air¬
craft on takeoff, as follows: for hours
between 7 a.m. and 11 pm, 110 PNdB;
after 11 p.m., 102 PNdB.
At the Kennedy Airport in New
York, the Port of New York Authority
has specified a maximum permissible
figure for jet takeoffs over neighbour¬
hoods of 112 PNdB. At night, jet
takeoffs are generally permitted only
from runways that lead over water.
The airports of Paris are also discus¬
sing similar restrictions. No restric¬
tions are made on landing noise at
London's or New York's airports.
Factors other than noisiness (in
PNdB) enter into the annoyance creat¬
ed by aircraft operations. Among the
more important are the average dura¬
tion of the noise of single flyovers, the
number of flyovers per day, and the
time of day in which they occur. It
appears from judgment tests that
doubling the duration of noise asso¬
ciated with each flyover or doubling

### 9901: Street and air traffic noise pollution, and what we can do about it

above the wings to reduce the roar
the number of flyovers each day is
equivalent to a three to four PNdB
increase in the level of a single flyover.
People are more sensitive to aircraft
noise during the late evening or night,
partly because the ambient noise is
lower and partly because people are
trying to sleep. Some studies have
indicated that noise levels between
10 p.m. and 1 a.m. must be 10 or
more PNdB lower than those between
7 a.m. and 10 p.m. if people are to
judge the noise situation as being
about equal.
If the land around an airport were
strictly zoned to prevent residential
construction, the aircraft-noise problem
would be much less significant. But
around existing airports, zoning against
housing generally cannot be used as
a substitute for the needed exercise of
the power of condemnation and the
ensuing obligation to pay for whatever
is expropriated.
Unfortunately, private airport owners
possess grossly inadequate resources
to pay the price of expropriation and,
in the past, municipalities generally
encountered public objection to prohi¬
bition of residential construction, even
near airports.
T
HE citizens of some count¬
ries are demanding that their parlia¬
ments should pass legislation requir¬
ing all aircraft to produce lower noise
levels in neighbourhoods. However, a
law that would specify lower maximum
acceptable levels to be met by all
operating aircraft will do little imme¬
diate good, since most of today's air¬
craft cannot meet a substantially lower
noise requirement.
Noise limitations must first be im¬
posed on new aircraft entering the air¬
lines' inventories. Then attrition and
the retro-fitting of silencers to existing
aircraft, where feasible, become practi¬
cal avenues toward quieter flight.
U.S. Federal requirements on accep¬
table noise levels before certification
of new aircraft are the existing legal
means available to accomplish this re¬
sult. Without such regulation, com¬
petitive pressures in both the manu¬
facturing and operating industries will
maintain the same lack of concern
about noise as that which now exists
for noise from trucks.
Primarily as the result of regulations
by the airports of England, France, Aus¬
tralia, Denmark and U.S.A. and, in turn,
airline purchase specifications, manu¬
facturers have fitted silencing devices
to the exhaust ports of most turbojet
engines. These silencers reduce take¬
off noise to some extent.
The newer bypass (turbofan) engines
provide considerably higher thrusts
without a proportional increase in
noise. Unfortunately, silencers on their
exhausts do little additional good. For
new aircraft, manufacturers are study¬
ing ways to mount the engine nacelles
above the wings so as to shield neigh¬
bourhoods from much of the engine
noise.
Aircraft are also noisy on approach
to landing both because of the whine
of the engine-intake compressors and
because most pilots believe it is safer
to land at a low glide angle while using
appreciable engine powers. To achieve
a large angle of the glide path at
which an airplane approaches the run¬
way 6° to 8° instead of 3° the air¬
line pilots say that better instrumenta¬
tion (perhaps computer control of
landings), better engine response, and
better airplane-handling qualities would
all have to be provided in the air¬
craft.
At least one country is experiment¬
ing with regulations that require jet
aircraft to climb as rapidly as possible
to an altitude of about 1,500 ft and
then to cut back engine power in
order to reduce noise until the aircraft
reaches an altitude of 3,000 ft. To
avoid flying directly over houses at
low altitudes, the aircraft must also
turn after takeoff and until it has
gained considerable altitude follow a
river or a highway.
The means seem available for appre¬
ciable control of in-flight aircraft noise.
Included are: refinement of aircraft
design so they can climb and land at
steeper angles, embodiment of better
noise-control features in engines,
nacelles and wings, and introduction
of sophisticated operating procedures.
But until regulations spell out maxi¬
mum-permissible noise levels appro¬
priate to differently zoned urban areas
and certificate new aircraft only if they
can meet these requirements, it is not
likely that the upward trend of aircraft
noise levels will be arrested.
Many people are apprehensive of
the noisiness of the next generation of
aircraft, known as the supersonic trans¬
port, or for short, the SST. Any air¬
plane traveling faster than the speed
of sound produces pressure, or shock,
waves around the nose and around
each protruding part of the airplane.
These waves are analogous to those
on either side of the bow of a rapidly
moving ship.
Shock waves form a cone that encir¬
cles and fellows the aircraft and inter¬
sects with the earth. As the line of
intersection with the earth advances
with the movement of the airplane,
people living within the width of the
intersecting path usually hear two
closely-spaced explosive sounds,
known as the "sonic boom". Typically
when first experiencing the sonic boom
residents are startled and frightened.
Their reactions are caused in part
because the boom occurs without any
prior warning and in part because the
individual is conditioned to associate
loud explosive-like sounds with pos¬
sible damage to his home, orto his per¬
son. He may imagine that something
has exploded nearby or a vehicle has
struck his dwelling. Or, he may fear
that repeated booms will crack plaster,
loosen fixtures, and weaken the struc¬
ture of his house.
EASURED outdoors, a typ¬
ical sonic boom from a high-flying
aircraft is a pressure wave that sud¬
denly increases above normal atmo¬
spheric pressure by 0.5 to 2 pounds
per square foot, then decreases some¬
what more slowly to below normal
atmospheric pressure by about the
same amount, and finally jumps back
to atmospheric pressure. The result
is an N-shaped pressure wave less
than half a second long. The lateral
spread of the boom becomes greater
as the altitude of the airplane incre¬
ases, although the intensity of the
boom decreases.
The American Government has vigo¬
rously pursued investigations of the
effects of sonic booms on people and
structures. One of these investiga¬
tions was carried out over the Oklaho¬
ma City area from February to July
1964. During this period, the popula¬
tion was subjected, during daytimes
only, to a total of 1,250 sonic booms.
The average intensities of the booms
were 1.13 pounds per square foot (psf)
during the first 11 weeks, 1.23 psf
during the next eight weeks, and
1.60 psf during the final seven weeks
of the programme.
From complaints received and inter¬
views of the residents, it was found
that the sonic boom was, in some mea¬
sure, a disturbing influence in the lives
of most of those people living within
eight miles to either side of a line
directly below the flight path.
At the end of six months, about one- 1 "7
fourth of the people interviewed said 1 I
that they felt that they could not learn

A sonic boom from an aircraft
"breaking the sound barrier"
may startle us, but it is still
a relatively rare disturbance.
However, the prospect of regular
supersonic flights sometime in
the 1970s is already creating
concern. Some aeronautical
specialists, including Bo
Lundberg, Director-General of
Sweden's Aeronautical Research
Institute, maintain that the
shock waves set up by planes
flying at from 1 ,500 to 1 ,800 m.p.h.
will hit the ground in every spot
within a "boom carpet" 50 to
80 miles wide along the entire
flight path. Plotted on map
(left) are "boom carpets" that
might be "unrolled" over
Western Europe unless
restrictions were imposed.
Sonic boom disturbances, say
other specialists, can be kept to
a minimum providing sonic
speeds are maintained until
aircraft are clear of certain
areas. Drawing (right) shows

at the 1.6 psf level. At some lower
pressure level, as yet to be more defi¬
nitely determined, very few people
should be annoyed.
The most significant result from the
Oklahoma tests was that many resi¬
dents believed their homes were being
damaged by the sonic booms, although
continuous observation of a number of
houses showed no damage. In other
parts of the country, near military
bases where supersonic military air¬
craft are regularly flown, large areas of
houses have been subjected to sonic
booms, many greater than 2.0 psf. The

sons in those areas has been small.
Nevertheless, over 40 % of those
interviewed in Oklahoma City felt that
their homes had been damaged. This
result suggests that belief in alleged
damage to property increases annoy¬
ance and complaints. It also suggests
that people might be less concerned
with sonic booms if it were clearly
demonstrated that SST noise levels at
or below those specified by the gov¬
ernment would not damage struc¬
tures.
There is no question about the
future of supersonic transport aircraft
the French-British SST will enter ser¬
vice soon. Sonic booms are unavoid¬
able, but it seems that overpressures
should be held within limits that will
not disturb people greatly or harm prop¬
erty. It seems mandatory that accep¬
table boom levels be established inter¬
nationally and that SST operations
afterwards be policed to assure com¬
pliance with the regulations.
People in modern societies must
adapt in some measure to the noises
of modern civilization. The extent to
which adaptation is necessary is
largely a matter of economics and con¬
venience. At moderate cost and some
loss of convenience, the hearing of
workers can be protected. Noise
created inside office buildings and
dwellings can be reduced to accept¬
able levels by proper use of materials
and structures for noise control. The
noise of transportation can be made
less annoying by suitable designs of
vehicles, by requiring noise limits for
new vehicles, by legislation and enfor¬
cement of noise codes, by operating
vehicles properly, by zoning and con¬
demnation of residential areas near air¬
ports and superhighways. In the worst
cases, we may have to resort to seal¬
ed, fully climatized housing.

Motorcycle engines are powerful, compact and noisy, even though, their
exhaust pipes are fitted with silencers (left of photo). Though these have
little effect on the power output of the engine, some motorcyclists
modify them and thereby reduce their efficiency as noise mufflers.

### 11868: Cordoba (Argentina) takes noise pollution abatement by the horns

CORDOBA (ARGENTINA)
TAKES NOISE ABATEMENT
BY THE HORNS
by G. L. Fuchs
H.iirthWVW
IHE city of Cordoba in
Argentina, where I live, has over
600,000 inhabitantsand some 50,000
motorcycles and motorscooters.
Cordoba's municipal regulations on
noise were introduced many years ago
and had long been ineffective. Yet
nothing was being done to bring them
up to date. This fact, coupled with
an explosive growth and the wave of
industrialization which began in the
1940s, had given Cordoba one of the
highest noise levels of any city in
Argentina. This applied not only .to
downtown Cordoba, with its constant
roar of traffic, but also to residential
areas among which industrial plants
and shops of all kinds had been ins¬
talled.
In 1960 we started our first noise
abatement campaign, sponsored joint¬
ly by the municipal authorities, the Uni¬
versity of Cordoba and a number of
private organizations. A noise sympo¬
sium was held and it was decided
to ask the International Association
Against Noise to assist Argentina in
setting up a National League Against
Noise.
An official "Silence Week" followed
the symposium and did much to arouse
public interest in the need for noise
control. It also brought some relief
G. L. FUCHS, an Argentine engineer, is
professor of acoustics and director of the
acoustics research centre at the University
of Cordoba (Argentina). This article is
taken from the paper presented by Pro¬
fessor Fuchs to the Congress of the Inter¬
national Association Against Noise, in- 1966,
at Baden-Baden (Federal Republic of Ger¬
many).
As a rapidly
developing centre
of commerce and
industry, Cordoba
won the unenviable
reputation of being
one of the noisiest
cities in Argentina.
In the past seven
years, however, the
city authorities and
the University of
Cordoba have been
campaigning against
the noise nuisance,
launching educational
programmes and
tightening up local
anti-noise regulations.
Right, a street in the
centre of Cordoba.
through the temporary suppression of
automobile horns and loudspeaker
advertising. But the improvement was
short lived because of the lack of
inspectors and the inadequacy of
Cordoba's noise regulations.
In 1964 we set up Argentina's first
Noise Abatement Council (Consejo
Permanente de Lucho contra el Ruido)
following which Argentina was admitted
to the International Association Against
Noise the same year.
I would like now to outline our case
history that might assist other towns
and countries in a similar situation.
Firstly, our new anti-noise municipal
regulation distinguishes between "un¬
necessary" and "excessive" noise. It
classifies over 15 unnecessary noises
which can be penalized without re¬
course to noise level measurement or
analysis.

Since the application of the anti-
noise law we have classified as un¬
necessary noises all public address
systems that can be heard outside
enclosed premises, including music,
publicity and speeches.
The second category (excessive
noise) covers those that even when
justified may exceed limits that affect
the well being and tranquility of our
citizens. For the first time in our
legislation, we have established noise
levels based on European criteria: av¬
erage levels for day-time (6 a.m. to
10 p.m.) and night-time (10 p.m. to
6 a.m.), as well as infrequent peak
levels (up to six hours) and frequent
peaks (more than six hours) which are
allowed in each case.
Since we have not been able to
make a noise survey of the city nor to
delineate appropriate zones, we have

CORDOBA (Continued)
One motorcycle for every 12 persons

had to ciassify environments in the
following categories: hospitals and
similar Institutions; residential sections,
schools and small shops; downtown
business areas and multi-storied build¬
ings; industrial areas and main roads
or freeways.
It has been something of a prob¬
lem1 to classify the appropriate environ¬
ment in each case. But some difficul¬
ties notwithstanding, the system works
well and has led to few controversies.
"Critical" areas for hospitals and con¬
valescent homes have been established
and circles of 200 metres diameter
drawn around these institutions. The
law has been modified to exclude all
noisy industries such as metal works
and factories from these areas. Exist¬
ing industries of this type have been
invited to find new locations.
We realize that to obtain more pre¬
cise data we shall have to carry out a
noise survey of Cordoba City. But so
far we have found that our noise level
readings correspond closely to sub¬
jective complaints on noise, and that
the public is satisfied in places where
the established levels are not
exceeded.
Vehicle noise limits have been based
on the results of experiments in other
countries, chiefly Switzerland.
A team of five men trained in our
laboratory checks noisy vehicles on
main thoroughfares. These inspectors
are not yet equipped to measure noise
levels but their estimates of abusive
noises have been highly accurate (an
error of one per cent or less was
noted in the first year, when 3,000
noise offenders were fined). When
offenders contest noise estimates,
they must report immediately to the
noise laboratory for an official test.
OTORCYCLES are our
greatest problem. There is one mo¬
torcycle or motorscooter for every
12 persons in our city and these vehi¬
cles are usually driven at high speeds.
Some motorcycles have silencers of
poor quality, and our laboratory is
studying how to improve the efficiency
of silencers on models manufactured in
Argentina. In our view, the ¡deal sys¬
tem of control would be an obligatory
test of motorcycle silencers once a
year when driving licences are
renewed.
Horns and silencers fitted on cars
and motorcycles do not come under
municipal jurisdiction and so we need
a national law to exercise a control on
their manufacture. The same applies
to noise checks on Argentina's inter-
provincial highways. And for a more
effective restraint of noise offenders,
co-ordination between municipal autho¬
rities is needed within each province.
An important feature of Cordoba's
Noise Abatement Council is that its
function is not only to advise on noise
reduction, but also to decide on the
application of penalties for noise
offences.
L
IABILITY for an infringe¬
ment of noise regulations covers not
only those directly responsible, but
anyone associated with the offence.
Penalties include fines, temporary or
permanent cancellation of driving li¬
cences and the closing (temporarily or
permanently) of shops, clubs and other
businesses.
In Cordoba, we have studied some
of the psychological aspects of noise
offences. Why, for example, do
drivers, and especially motorcyclists,
remove or modify the mufflers on their
vehicles? Is it because a personality
defect makes them enjoy excessive
noise? Or does the noisy urban envi¬
ronment give them a kind of "thirst
for noise?"
In our survey of this problem we
have questioned offenders, but it is
still too early to venture an expla¬
nation on the basis of solid statistical
data. In the case of motorcyclists
the most common one in our exper¬
ience we have reason to believe
that one motivation for having a noisy
machine is the fear of being run into
by automobiles. It has been noticed
for instance that drivers of well-
muffled motorcycles and scooters tend
to "toot" excessively, whereas riders
of noisy machines seldom use their
horns.
Another of our findings is that well
educated people (scientists, scholars,
artists and members of the liberal
professions) are far more susceptible
to the noise of traffic than relatively
uneducated people.
Noise is a social problem and its
solution calls for intensive campaigns
to alert the public to the need for
action. Rapid industrial development
has made it an especially urgent prob¬
lem in Argentina. That is why we
are endeavouring to set up a League
Against Noise to deal with the ques¬
tion on a national scale and with
greater resources.

ECHOES
FROM
OUR NOISY

New techniques to reduce the noise
of building construction have recently
been introduced. But little has been done
to muffle the demolition operations that
often precede work on a new building.
Here, rubble from old buildings thunders
to the ground under the impact of
sledge-hammers and bulldozers. People
in nearby apartments try to live with

Dogs, cats and flying bats.
Many animals have far more per¬
ceptive hearing than man. Dogs have
a remarkable "auditory memory" and
can recognize a change of even an
eighth of a tone in a signal taught them
weeks earlier. Canine noise recepti¬
vity extends two octaves above that
of a human being (a cat's only one
octave). As they fly, bats give a
continuous cry so high pitched as to
be inaudible to man. When these
supersonic waves strike obstacles in
the path of the bat they echo back
to its sensitive ears and enable it to
take avoiding action. With this remark¬
able "radar" apparatus bats can fly
in pitch darkness without danger of
collisions. Experiments reveal that
salt water fish hear only deep-toned
sounds whereas fresh water fish hear
high-pitched ones.
A noise 'cure' good
for everyone
The growth of motor transport in
the past 20 years has led many coun¬
tries to revise their traffic codes
sometimes in the face of public opin¬
ion. The decision to forbid the use
of motor horns in Paris was one such
controversial move, and motorists in
particular predicted that street acci¬
dents would increase. In practice the
measure was remarkably successful.
With a show of self-restraint that
surprised the Parisians themselves the
honking and blaring of horns was stil¬
led from one day to the next. Paris
now wonders how it ever managed to
endure such a futile and nerve-racking
din.

International agreement on noise
levels for new vehicles and a pro¬
gramme for reducing such levels
would be a step forward in the cam¬
paign against traffic noise, says a
report by the Council of Europe. The
car industry would have an incentive to
seek greater improvements in the re¬
duction of vehicle noise. So far, notes
the report, the industry has devoted
much attention to acoustic performance
such as mechanical and body noise,
whereas silencers for successive
models with increased engine perfor¬
mance are designed so as to avoid a
large power loss. "Though efforts
are directed to perfecting more effi¬
cient silencers." says the report, "mo¬
torcycle manufacturers find that the
greater demand is not for the more
silent types."
Noise a killer
Laboratory experiments have dem¬
onstrated that sound with an intensity
of 150 to 160 decibels is fatal to
certain animals. The animals suffered
from burns, spasms and paralysis
before dying. Recent ecological stud¬
ies have shown that rats exposed
to loud noise exhibit a marked decline
in the pregnancy rate.

'White noise' or
'acoustical perfume'
The humming of air conditioners and
the throbbing roar of "heat pumps",
whose large fans fill houses and
apartment buildings with heated air in
winter and cooled air in summer have
created two new forms of 'noise pollu¬
tion'. Ironically, however unwanted
the sounds these machines make, the
hiss of air inside a conditioned build¬
ing is a useful sound. Sound en¬
gineers call it "white noise" or "acous¬
tical perfume" and they use it widely,
especially in offices, to blanket dis¬
tracting sounds that spring out of
silence into disturbing acoustical relief.

How to build quietly

Peoples of the Ancient World were intrigued by the intelligence

and use the echos from them as a kind of radar guidance device.

explosions, and also kept flying debris
safely within a confined area. All the
joints on the 14,000 tons of steel in the
frame were welded silently to eliminate
the hideous, shattering racket of con¬
ventional riveting or bolting.
Deafness
an occupational hazard
Industrial deafness caused by noise
exposure is not a new occupational
disease. It first appeared with the
( advent of steam power and the steam
boiler. It affected workers who made
riveted boilers in such numbers that it
was termed "boilermakers' disease".
The hazard of damaged hearing due to
noise is now recognized as a disabling
possibility in almost all industries and
trades. In U.S.A. it is estimated that
approximately 1,000,000 workers have
serious hearing loss due to high noise
levels in their places of work. The
potential cost to U.S. industry through
compensation for hearing loss due to
this cause is estimated at $500 million,
based on the assumption that only ten
per cent of the 4,500,000 persons who
work in areas of intense noise will
develop and file claims for compen¬
sation.

Measurement of noise levels in a
test apartment in a large U.S. city
showed that the kitchen is the noisest
room (generating 100 decibels or
more) when a fan, dishwasher and
garbage disposal machine are all going

to be a satisfactory 50 decibels.

Silent power
The British Hospital Authorities use
more than 650 battery-powered electric
vehicles within hospital grounds. Their
first requirement is for a quiet running
vehicle which will not create a noise
problem for patients. Comparative
tests taken at normal town speed bet¬
ween commercial electric vehicles and
similar capacity petrol and diesel
trucks showed the following results:
Diesel: 81 decibels; petrol: 80 deci¬
bels; electric: 60 decibels (a figure
lower than for most private cars).
A little energy
can make a lot of noise
The noise of a crowd in a sports
stadium would scarcely boil a saucepan
of water, reports a conference on
"The Control of Noise" organized by
Britain's National Physical Laboratory.
Other facts from the report: The noise
of a 200,000 h.p. jet engine would
produce about 20 h.p. One 10,000th
part of the energy of this jet engine
escapes as noise. To reduce the noise
to a comfortable level, the engine
would have to be modified so that
only one part in a million of its energy
escapes as noise. To reduce it to
inaudibility, escaping energy would
have to be reduced to one part in ten
million.
A far 'buzzier' place
Even without supersonic aircraft, the
sky of the future will be a far busier
and noiser place than it is today. In
the U.S.A. alone, the 90,000 privately
owned planes of today will have
increased to 150,000 by 1975, and the
112 U.S. airports now equipped for
jets will number 300 within four years.
Electronic 'ears'
aid the deaf
Deaf people have benefitted im¬
mensely from this century's progress
in science and technology. Since 1876,
when Alexander Graham Bell's in¬
vention of the telephone was inspired
by his work with devices for the deaf,
increasingly effective hearing aids
have helped to consign the ear
trumpet to the rubbish heap. Elec¬
tronics and miniaturization (thanks to
the transistor) have given deaf people
better and more inconspicuous hear¬
ing aids (worn behind the ears or
hidden in spectacles). Improved med¬
ical equipment has brought better
understanding and diagnosis of hear¬
ing defects and in many cases modern
surgical skills can restore certain
kinds of faulty hearing to an almost
normal level.

it causes has driven people to seek solutions.

NOISE AND HEALTH
Studies have shown that continued exposure to noise not only
causes damage to the ear, but can have other harmful effects
by Günther Lehmann
P

AST generations realized
that noise could be disturbing, and
even in the days of Antiquity there
were regulations for the abatement of
noise in town and homes. Though
we have no precise information on the
intensity of noise in, say, a Roman
city, we may be sure that the farther
back we go in history, the more noise
was restricted to certain places; it
was caused by men and animals and
to only a limited extent by machines
nowadays the worst offenders in pro¬
ducing a disagreeable din.
Volume of noise depends on density
of population and on people's activities
and behaviour. It would be a mistake
to regard the present increase in noise
as an inevitable result of the expan¬
sion of technology. The aim of techno¬
logical development should be to
serve man, to make his life more
agreeable and enrich it. So logically,
technical progress should lead to less
noise, not more.
Whether a sound strikes the ear as
an annoying or irritating noise does
not depend merely on its intensity;
very loud music may still be beautiful
whereas even minute scratching
sounds can be a disturbing noise.
What makes a sound a noise is a
GÜNTHER LEHMANN Is director of the
Max Planck Institute for Occupational Phy¬
siology at Dortmund (Federal Republic of
Germany) and president of the International
Association Against Noise. Professeur Leh¬
mann is a leading authority on the effects
which noise can have on the human
organism, and is widely known for his
studies and research in this field.
matter of psychology rather than
acoustics.
A sound which we associate with
something pleasurable is far less likely
to be considered as a noise than one
with unwelcome connotations. We al¬
ways tend to underrate the noise of our
own car, for example, and the children
next door always seem to make more
noise than our own. So whether a
sound is regarded as a noise and how
noisy it is depends also on who causes
the noise and his relationship with
the person who hears it.
A sudden, very loud noise, such as
gunfire, lasting only fractions of a sec¬
ond, may damage a person's hearing
mechanism and produce a lasting loss
of hearing or partial deafness. But
exposure to noise levels quite common
in industry and indeed characteristic
of certain branches of heavy industry
such as forging and metal cutting
leads, progressively, to "perceptive
deafness," depending in each case on
the intensity of the noise and duration
of exposure. Once a hearing defect of
this kind has set in, nothing can be
done. Protective devices can help
to postpone it and to slow down its
development, but once the damage is
done, it is irreparable.
The danger of noise-induced dam¬
age to hearing exists when noise
exceeds a certain level over that of
the normal auditory threshold. In
assessing noise, the fact that its inten¬
sity diminishes in relation to the dis¬
tance of the hearer from its source
has to be taken into account. And the
higher the sound frequencies, the
greater the reduction.
The strain of operating a noisy
machine shows in the expression
of this metal worker (right).
A noise level of 95 "phons"
(an intensity common in certain
industries) can lead to progressive
deafness. Noise above this level
(produced by engine test benches
or pneumatic drills) can damage
the hearing mechanism and
even lead to complete deafness.
In addition to a protective helmet
and transparent mask, drill
operator (above) wears ear mufflers
to deaden the din from his machine.
High sound frequencies, moreover,
are more disagreable to the ear than
low ones. Sounds produced by cer¬
tain aircraft (those with turbo-prop en¬
gines for instance) comprise many high
frequency tones and therefore grate
on the ear. As distance increases, the
high-frequency sounds rapidly fade
whereas the deeper tones die away
slowly.
The ability to hear high tones gra¬
dually wanes as people grow older.
This is a physiological effect of aging
which starts at about 45 and is often
not noticed for a long time, since high
frequencies are seldom heard in daily

THE DANGER
OF SOUNDS
WE CANNOT
HEAR
Infra-sound has a pitch or frequency
of below 30 cycles per second and is
thus inaudible to the human ear. It can
nevertheless harm the human orga¬
nism. It is blamed for feelings of mal¬
aise and discomfort sometimes ex¬
perienced by airplane passengers. But
studies and measurements suggest
that infra-sound from aircraft cannot
cause physical injuries to people living
near airports. Exploration of the world
of infra-sound has onlyjust begun. The
French National Centre for Scientific
Research has set up a special infra¬
soundresearch laboratory in Marseilles
(where photos on these pages were
taken). The laboratory investigates the
the risks associated with infra-sound,
its connexion with certain illnesses for
example, and studies what practical
uses may eventually be made of it.

MAMMOTH ORGAN PIPE. To study
the effect of infra-sound at ultra-low
frequencies (3è cycles per second)
on the human organism, French
scientists have built an enormous
"organ pipe", 24 metres (78 feet)
long. Infra-sound is inaudible to the
ear but produces a fluttering
sensation which results in other
sounds being heard in a distorted
way. Industrial cities abound in
infra-sound, generated by many
kinds of machines and motors that
turn at a slow rate. Even infra-sound
of weak intensity can penetrate houses
and become the unsuspected cause
of such ills as dizziness and fatigue.

walls, partitions and similar obstacles,
normal sound-proofing techniques are
completely ineffective.
SEEN BUT NOT HEARD. Right,
specialists experiment with an
infra-sound detector. The inaudible
infra-sound is shown visuaHy on an
oscilloscope. The threshold of hearing
of the average person (about
30 cycles per second) varies from
one person to another. The human
voice, from deep bass to soprano
tones, ranges from 80 to 4,000
cycles per- second.

NOISE AND HEALTH (Continued from page 26)


### 13261: Noise and health: studies have shown that continued exposure to noise pollution not only causes damage to the ear, but can have other harmful effects

Noise does not make the heart grow fonder
life. Noise-induced hearing defects
differ from those due to ageing in that
initially they are felt mostly on far
lower frequencies. By testing hearing
in the various frequency ranges it is
thus possible to decide whether a
hearing defect is due to noise or to
ageing.
In almost all countries partial deaf¬
ness due to noise is now recognized
as an occupational disease and its
victims receive financial compensation
based on the extent of loss of hearing,
with a maximum award for complete
deafness.
Workers in the noisiest industries
should obviously wear devices to pro¬
tect their hearing. Unfortunately, it is
not always easy to pursuade them to
use these ear plugs or ear-muffs al¬
though they are neither uncomfortable
nor inconvenient to wear. Apparently,
the threat of a gradual onset of noise-
induced deafness is not enough to
encourage everyone to make use of
personal protective devices.
s,
30
'UCH appliances do not of
course give complete protection from
noise, since sounds are transmitted to
the middle ear not only through the air
canal of the outer ear, but also through
the bone of the skull, which continues
to transmit noise when the passage
through the outer ear is blocked.
Even so, covering the outer ear
greatly attenuates the intensity of loud
sounds reaching the ear drum. In
other words noise is reduced to a level
at which it is no longer dangerous.
Many small easy-to-wear ear pro¬
tectors have been developed in recent
years. But, if bone-conducted noise
is also to be blocked out, which is
only necessary in the case of excep¬
tionally loud noises, then some form
of protection for the whole skull
rubber caps and helmets, for instan¬
ce is required. Such caps are used
by workers checking and testing
aircraft engines.
The range of hearing of the human
ear is usually between 30 and 20,000
cycles per second. But only the
hearing of children can reach the
20,000 cycles level. In early adult age,
the threshold of hearing drops below
20,000 cycles, and for the aged the
level is considerably lower. At 30 cy¬
cles, most people hear a tone not as
a single regular sound, but as a series
of separate beats.
In reality, comparatively few people
are exposed to the danger of noise-
induced deafness. Noise that has in
vaded every sphere of daily life may
be unpleasant and irritating the roar
of traffic, for instance, or the clamour
of a number of people talking loudly
or shouting at the same time but
this is not likely to cause damage to
hearing. Yet that does not mean those
who have to listen to such noises be¬
come indifferent to them or that the
problem is no concern of ours.
When, regretfully, we compare the
proliferating noises of the modern
world with the peace and quiet that
once existed in some places, what we
are really complaining about is the
stress and nervous strain created by
all the noise that assails our ears.
What threatens us is not the like¬
lihood of auditory troubles or loss of
hearing, but an incessant disturbance
which, under certain conditions, creates
an intolerable strain. And the amount
of the strain depends not only on the
intensity and duration of the noise,
but also, and to a large extent, on
the source of the noise and what it
signifies to the person on the receiv¬
ing end.
Many cases have been noted of per¬
sons becoming "acclimatized" to cer¬
tain kinds of continuous or frequently
repeated noise This is especially
true of those willing to accept the
noise because it is linked with some
activity in which they are interested or
which is useful or profitable to them
But such cases are relatively few.
More often, especially when no par¬
ticular interest in the source of the
noise is present, the human response
is quite the reverse, producing reac¬
tions of excitability and annoyance.
These are directed not only against
noise itself but are spread over a whole
range of sensory impressions.
Typically, people exposed to noise
of this kind easily become irritable
and unsociable. Studies show that
workers in noisy jobs tend to be more
quarrelsome at work and away from
it (at home, for example) than those
doing equivalent jobs, but who are not
Auditory nerve
INTERNAL EAR
The ear has three parts: the outer, middle and inner ear. The outer ear collects
sounds and transmits them down the auditory canal to a taut, thin membrane, the
ear-drum. The middle ear, which transmits and identifies sound vibrations, is an
air filled cavity bridged by three little bones, named the hammer, anvil and stirrup
because of their shape. The hammer, attached to the ear-drum, vibrates with It
and works with the anvil as a bent lever to vibrate the stirrup. Damage to any
of these three bones can cause deafness since vibrations no longer reach the
hearing part of the inner ear, the cochlea, or organ of Corti, whose job it is lo
transform vibrations into nerve impulses. These impulses are carrried down the
auditory nerve to the brain and there interpreted as sounds. The perceptivity of
the ear may be lowered by auditory fatigue (a temporary loss of hearing) or by
increasing age (usually around 40). It can also be impaired by damage due to
noise or disease which can result in partial or total deafness.

### 13261: Noise and health: studies have shown that continued exposure to noise pollution not only causes damage to the ear, but can have other harmful effects

subject to similar noise stresses.
Noise thus has a disturbing effect on
social life even within the family
where in most cases the father alone
is exposed to noise during the day.
Scientific tests relating to the im¬
pact of noise on human beings help
to explain these psychological reac¬
tions. They reveal that changes in
the circulation of the blood and in
the action of the heart take place when
a person is exposed to a certain
intensity of noise. Even snatches of
loud conversation are enough to affect
the nervous system and thereby pro¬
voke constrictions in a large part of
the blood circulation system. These
effects are maintained as along as the
noise continues, but quickly subside
when the noise ceases.
IMPAIRED circulation caus¬
ed by the effects of noise is often
revealed by skin pallor. The greater
the noise and the longer it lasts, the
more slowly this reaction diminishes
after the noise is removed. Workers in
a boiler factory, for instance, thus
suffer from a constantly impaired cir¬
culation in the epidermis.
Glands and other organs subject to
nervous stimulation are similarly affect¬
ed. Changes occur, for example, in
the secretion and composition of the
gastric juices and this may eventually
be harmful. Effects of this kind have
been observed in workers in the iron
and steel industries. But if the noise
is removed the effects disappear
sooner or later without apparently
causing any long-term damage.
Occupational deafness of the kind
found in industry sets in comparative¬
ly slowly. It may be many years be¬
fore the defect becomes bad enough
to worry the person concerned and
still longer before it is acute enough
to cause a person real embarrassment
in communicating with others. But
in both cases it is vitally important that
steps be taken to control the genesis
and the development of hearing de¬
fects.
Medical examinations of workers ex¬
posed to high noise levels are now
made regularly in all countries so that
anyone whose hearing has become
affected can be transferred to a quieter
job before the defect becomes a
serious handicap. A psychologically
interesting point about this is that
workers are opposed to job transfers
because of fear of being downgraded
or perhaps earning less. No worker
being examined ever feigns to be
hard of hearing, but on the contrary
denies or tries to conceal any defects
in his hearing.
In the office, as in the factory, prolonged exposure to noise causes fatigue,
absent-mindedness and mental strain. Noise has been blamed for over
50 per cent of errors in typing. Before 1939, says a World Health Organization
report, office noise was costing U.S. business two million dollars a day
through inefficient work. The cost today is $4 million. In office above,
glass partitions isolate each worker from noise and clatter made by colleagues.

From the Unesco New:

Kalinga Prize for
French astronomer-author
Professor Paul Couderc, French astron¬
omer and author of some 20 popular
scientific books has been selected as the
fifteenth winner of the international Kalinga
Prize for the Popularization of Science.
A former secretary-general of the French
National Committee for Astronomy, Pro¬
fessor Couderc was responsible for install¬
ing the platenarium in the Paris scientific
museum, "Le Palais de la Découverte".
His popular scientific books, which have
been widely translated, include an explan¬
ation of the theory of relativity, which sold
nearly 100,000 copies. The Kalinga Prize
is awarded annually, by international jury
appointed by Unesco.
U.N. Development projects
in 113 countries
During 1967-68, more than 6,000 special¬
ists will be taking part in technical assis¬
tance projects financed by the U.N.
Development Programme and carried out in
co-operation with U.N. Specialized Agencies
in 113 countries. Grants for training and
study will be given to more than 8,000
people in these countries.
Trailing the locust
Special surveys of potential breeding
areas of the desert locust in Iran and
Afghanistan began recently. The work is
being paid for by the U.N. Development
Programme which has already financed
similar surveys in Africa and Saudi Arabia.
India is now reported to be virtually free
of locusts, but single insects are still found
in possible breeding places, and if not
rapidly detected the desert locusts can
multiply into a plague.
Sweden's switch from left
to right-hand driving
Elaborate road safety plans are being
made in Sweden for the planned change¬
over from left to right-hand driving which
becomes effective at 5 a.m. on September
3, 1967. Just before the change-over,
severely reduced speed limits will be put
into effect, and all but emergency vehicles
will be banned from the highways for four
hours before and one hour after the change¬
over.
Problems of oil pollution
on the seas
The Council of the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organization, meeting
in London to consider problems of marine
pollution by oil, has recommended a
number of studies to prevent similar
accidents to the one which recently caused
large areas of the English Channel and
French and British beaches to be polluted
with oil. One will concern the establish¬
ment of mandatory sea lanes for tankers
and similar vessels and another will look
into the possibility of equipping these ships
with special navigational aids. Research
will also be stepped up on the prevention
of pollution by mechanical and scientific
means.
Teachers give up their
holiday to teach
As in previous years, a number of British
teachers and lecturers will give up their
summer vacation this year to run staff
refresher courses for teachers in develop¬
ing countries. In 1967, 150 will leave for
15 countries where some 2,000 local
teachers are expected to benefit from
refresher courses.
Will man make the weather?
Methods of large-scale weather modi¬
fication such as the diversion of warm
ocean currents, destruction of the Arctic
snow cover, and damming of the Bering
Straits will be possible within about 20
years, according to Evgeny Fedorov, Di¬
rector of the Hydro-Meteorological Institute
of the Soviet Union. Addressing delegates
to the recent Fifth World Meteorological
Congress, meeting in Geneva, he said that
man already exerts considerable influence
on the composition of the atmosphere.
The lower atmosphere is being heated
through combustion products and industrial
pollution, and moisture circulation is being
changed by land improvement and other
surface changes.
Natural encyclopaedia
The Forestry Service of the Harz Moun¬
tains, in conjunction with teachers at Sieber
(Federal Republic of Germany), has created
a "forest encyclopaedia". Over a distance
of 2 1/2 miles, signs identify the various
species of trees and explain their life
cycle. Other signs give facts about birds.
An "ornithological clock" indicates the hour
at which they wake redstart: 4.40 a.m.;
cuckoo: 4.30 a.m.; blackbird: 4.40 a.m.
and so on.
Subsoil satellite
An orbiting geological laboratory is being
planned in the United States. One hundred
miles (160 kilometres) out in space, it will
measure heat radiations and magnetic
properties of the land below so as to help
locate the natural resources of the world.
Similar techniques might be used to make
a geological chart of the moon and planets.
Sunlight telephone
Transistorized solar radio-telephones for
the use of motorists have been set up in
Ghana on the road from Accra to Tema.
The sun's rays are collected through a
panel of photo-electric cells mounted on a
mast, and the current produced Is suffi¬
cient to keep a battery charged. Five
such radio-telephones can operate on
1 watt, and the equipment is inexpensive.
Gas cutlets
Two British scientists have perfected a
method of extracting protein from natural
gas. The protein is derived from methane
and takes the form of a white, flakey
substance. Ten tons of protein could be
obtained from 56,000 cubic metres
(353,000 cubic feet) but the cost is very
high. Efforts to produce synthetic protein
from oil have been under way in France
for some years.
A watch on air pollution
Creation of a network of air pollution
control stations in Western Europe was
proposed by a recent international confer¬
ence in Stockholm sponsored by the
Swedish Pomittee for Air Purification. The
stations would study soot and sulphur
dioxide content in the air the most
common industrial pollution the spread of
air pollution over unpopulated areas and the
long-term changes in Europe's atmosphere
due to rapidly increasing industrialization.
r*r- INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATIONS
A multicoloured fireworks display is depicted on this
"Independence" stamp issued by the U.N. Postal Admin¬
istration to pay tribute to the 55 countries which have
achieved independence since the United Nations was
founded in 1945. The United Nations has played a
significant role in this progress and its membership
has increased nearly two-fold as a result, today totalling
122 countries. As agent in France of the U.N. Postal
Administration, Unesco's Philatelic Service stocks all
U.N. stamps and first day covers currently on sale.

INTERNATIONAL
TROPHY FOR
SPORTSMANSHIP
The annual Pierre de Cou-
bertin International Fair Play
Trophy (for 1966) was pre¬
sented to wrestler Stevan
Horvat of Yugoslavia by
Mr René Maheu, Director-
General of Unesco, on April
18, at a ceremony in Unesco
House, Paris. Horvat (left)
received the award for his
sportsmanship during the world champion¬
ships in Greco-Roman wrestling at Toledo,
Ohio (U.S.A.) in June 1966, when he
appealed against measures which would
have hindered the chances of his
opponents. The measures were not taken
and Horvat had thus to face his strongest
competitors. Despite this he went on to
win. The International Committee of Fair
Play Trophies also awarded a diploma of
honour to an American sailing team for
their sportsmanship during the international
challenge round of catamarans at Thorpe
Bay, Great Britain in September 1966.
The American crew agreed» to allow their
British competitors to make certain repairs
to their boat, although the interpretation of
the ruling was questionable. This gesture
enabled the British team to win the finals.
Averting nuclear accidents
A system for the protection of nuclear
centres in the event of seismic disturbances
has been devised in Japan. Should a re¬
actor be put out of order by an earthquake,
the control devices might become incapable
of stopping the chain reaction by absorb¬
ing the neutrons. In the new Tokai Mura
atomic centre, the reactor has been fitted
with hoppers containing four million balls
made of steel mixed with boron and
measuring 2 mm in diameter. Three seis¬
mographs continuously record the vibrations
of the soil and should these reach a
certain intensity, they release the balls into
the heart of the reactor, thereby ensuring
that the neutrons are absorbed and that
the reactor comes to a stop.
Electronic library service
at computer speeds
The first system of automated document¬
ation for nuclear science and technology
has come into service at the Euratom In¬
formation and Documentation Centre in
Brussels. This service enables over
400,000 books, reports and articles to be
found in the "twinkling of a computer's
eye" and made available to researchers
and manufacturers. Each year at least
100,000 new documents will be added to this
computerized library.
African wildlife charter
A convention designed to save African
wildlife threatened with extinction has been
proposed by a meeting of African countries
at Fort-Lamy, Chad, organized by the Food
and Agriculture Organization. It was drawn
up by delegates from 20 countries and
several international organizations, includ¬
ing Unesco. When adopted it will give
complete or partial protection to more than
100 species, ranging from lion to wart-hog,
giraffe to crocodile, many of which are al¬
ready endangered by indiscriminate hunting
or by destruction of their natural habitats.
Other proposals to protect wildlife include
stricter control of the sale of trophies in
which a flourishing black market exists.
Ratification of these proposals and of the
convention itself will be considered by an
international African conference to be called
by the Food and Agriculture Organization
early next year.
'The World of Music'
The first issue of "The World of Music"',
a magazine published by the International
Music Council and Unesco, has just appear¬
ed. This tri-lingual quarterly (English,
French and German) aims to give readers
an overall view of the different conceptions
of musical language and to contribute to a
better understanding of musical values.
Eminent music critics, musicologists and
composers have contributed to the first
issue, which has articles on "Total Theatre",
"Improvisation in Indian Music" and "Unesco
and Music". "The World of Music" is edited
in collaboration with the International Ins¬
titute for Comparative Music. For Great
Britain and the Commonwealth, subscriptions
should be sent to Bärenreiter Ltd., 32/4

Great modern sculptors
"Rodin" is the latest in a series of
monographs on the great sculptors of
modern times published in English and French
language editions by Arted, Editions d'Art
(6, avenue du Coq, Parish). Prepared by
Professor lonel Jianou and Cécile Gold-
scheider, Curator of the Rodin Museum in
Paris, the monograph presents a compre¬
hensive study of Rodin's life and work,
including a chronology, a list of exhibitions,
a bibliography and commentaries. The
Rodin monograph has 208 pages and 90
photographs and costs 75 F. Previous
volumes in the series were devoted to
Brancusi, Zadkine and Bourdelle.

Letters to the Editor
34
DON'T CHANGE YOUR POLICY
Sir,
You have been printing so many
letters asking you to change your
editorial policy, that I feel constrained
to write.
Other publications cater for different
parts of the community, but there is
no other magazine quite like the
Unesco Courier do not change it at
all; it caters for the intelligent of all
ages. It makes people aware of the
world, it makes one feel a citizen of
the world. My sister Is 12 years old;
she reads those articles that catch her
eye, and I see from your "Letters to
the Editor" column that your oldest
readers live in old-age homes.
The Unesco Courier can change
one's whole outlook on what one
should be doing with one's life. Its
influence is immense and I expect
diverse: but let me illustrate with my
own experience.
I have been getting the Courier
since 1964 and in 1966 its influence
had worked on me to such an extent
that I threw aside those qualifications
I had gained in four years at university
and started studying sociology and
subjects as background to sociology.
My expectation now is that I might
make a small contribution to the
science which will make a large
contribution to men's happiness; but
my hope (note sociological distinction
between expectations and aspirations),
my hope is that 1 might make a
contribution to peace research itself.
Whenever I see suggestions to make
the Unesco Courier "better" for a
special interest group I am horrified.
It should appeal to everybody, and
its present policy of making people
aware of what is going on in the
world today, and what has gone on in
the past seems, to me, ideal.
Perhaps I am biased because its
influence has been so great in my
life, but if it could influence me to
that extent, perhaps it also influences
others.

TALLEST TELEVISION TOWER
Sir,
In your issue of November 1966
(page 33) I read that the Moscow
Television Tower, when completed in
the autumn of 1967, will be the highest
edifice in the world, 520 metres or
1,700 feet in height.
Actually, however, there are several
taller television towers in the United
States. They include KTHI-TV, in
Fargo, North Dakota (2,069 feet);
KSLA-TV, Shreveport, Louisiana
(1,791); WRBL-TV, Columbus, Georgia
and WBIR-TV, Knoxville, Tennessee
(1,749 feet), according to "Television
Factbook", n° 36, 1966.
It may be that the Soviet statement
pertains to a self-supporting tower:
the tallest self-supporting tower in the
Western Hemisphere is that of WITI-
TV, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which
is 1,078 feet high.

ART AND LIFE AS ONE
Sir,
At all times art stands for the
dignity, the interest and the horizon
of life. I disagree with readers (April
1967 issue) who ask you to devote
less place to it in the Unesco Courier.
In my view, your remarkable magazine
never neglects the other aspects of
its far-reaching aims and purposes.
Madeleine Louis Cazamian

HUNGRY, BUT NOT FOR ART
Sir,
I' agree with readers who say you
publish too much on art (April 1967).
The articles which interest me most
are those that present the major
problems of our time and explain what
is being done to improve living
conditions in the developing countries.
What is the use of talking about art to
the two thousand million people (out
of a world population of 3,000 million),
who are starving?

CULTURE HAS NO FRONTIERS
Sir,
I have just seen your January 1967
issue. Nothing could have been more
graphic than your presentation of the
havoc wrought by the floods to these
art treasures in Italy. One feels
distressed at the thought of the
uncontrolled forces of nature letting
themselves loose on these master¬
pieces. I do hope that your appeal
will succeed and whatever could
possibly be done to restore these
paintings, manuscripts and statues
will be done.
I think that Unesco's role in
preserving the great Egyptian monu¬
ments and now the campaign to save
these Italian treasures is doing much
to bring the world closer together.
Which shows what culture can do to
remove the national barkers which
politics is trying all the time to
build up.

ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST
Sir,

quality of the colour pages in your
April 1967 issue. There is however
an error in the caption at the bottom
of page 23: "Far left, John the Baptist,

ETHICS IN THE MASS MEDIA
Sir,
"The Intruders" by René Maheu, an
article which takes a look at ethics
in the mass media (February 1967),
deserves the widest and most attentive
study.
All the technological and cultural
revolutions in the world will never
change the fact that the flowering and
durability of a civilization depends
above all on the moral and spiritual
worth of the individual. The individual
is the cell of the social tissue and
if this cell becomes weak or diseased,
the tissue as a whole will perish
sooner or later.
The "manipulators of news and
information", whose possibilities of
action have increased out of all
proportion to the audience they now
reach, have a major responsibility
in keeping the "individual social cell"
in good health.
If they themselves are unable to
draw up a Code of Honour, it is the
imperative duty of the authorities to
provide them with one in a legal form
that could be recognized by the courts.

FIRE, AZOROASTRIAN SYMBOL
Sir,
Your article about Iran (December
1966) refers to the "Zoroastrian fire
worshippers". The Zoroastrians do not
worship fire. They worship Ahura
Mazda who is the Great God. The fire
is an element very much respected by
the Zoroastrians because it lights the
darkness and destroys evil. Fire is
to the Zoroastrians as the cross
is to the Christians, a symbol. Calling
the Zoroastrians fire worshippers is
like calling the Christians cross
worshippers, an unfair and untrue
interpretation of the religion.
