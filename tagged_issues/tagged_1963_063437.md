SKOPLJE, JULY 26, 1963. On this day in the early
morning a violent earthquake rocked the sleeping
Yugoslav city of Skoplje and in a matter of seconds
felled 85% of its buildings. Over 1,000 people
died in the ruins. To protect people and property
from similar disasters, engineers and scientists
in many lands are working to design buildings
that will resist major earth tremors. See page 31.

ENTS DRIFTING ?

CRUST. The crust of the earth,
sometimes called the sial, varies
considerably in thickness. At the
ocean bottom it can be as little as
5 kms. whereas on the continents
its depth can vary between 30 and
70 kms. Projects to drill through the
crust to obtain samples of the
mantle below are now under way.
MOHO. (Mohorovicic disconti¬
nuity) the boundary zone between
the earth's crust and its mantle.
MANTLE. Also known as the sima,
it stretches from the earth's crust
to the outer core. Believed to be
solid but slightly plastic (and white
hot) and formed of different and
denser rocks than the crust. Man¬
tle's density increases with depth.
OUTER CORE. Thought to be a
mass of white hot liquid iron. Its
liquid form is suggested by the fact
that transverse earthquake waves
are unable to travel through it.
INNER CORE. It has been suggested
that within liquid outer core there
may be a solid central inner core.
Was the Pacific Ocean formed by
the separation of the Moon
from the Earth? Was there a flood or

is there a lost land of Atlantis beneath
the sea? Have continents moved about
and was the Atlantic Ocean formed
by their separation ? Can the earth
be shaken by any cataclysms greater
than we know?
These are sensible questions which many people have
asked, and which they will continue to ask until they
get a unanimous and clear answer. Unfortunately that ls
not yet possible. "We do not know all about the earth.
Its deep Interior cannot be penetrated and can only be
explored by Indirect means. Good records are not old.

different aspects to emphasize and so reach durèrent
conclusions (1).
Since the time of the ancient Greek observations In
Egypt, scientists have surveyed the shape of the earth
and have agreed that It ls nearly round, but other scien¬
tists who have considered Its history have not been able
to make such precise observations and they arc not agreed
upon an interpretation. Like artists, looking at the same
things, they see different pictures. One, like Vermeer,
sees a still and photographic image of the earth. Another,
like a Van Gogh, sees a swirling, active planet. Yet
another, like a Picasso, thinks that the continents have
been displaced; that Greenland was once the head of
Europe; that Africa and South America arc twins which
have been torn apart to form the South Atlantic Ocean.
The different ideas held about the earth can best be
emphasized by a historical treatment to show how fresh
evidence has changed men's views.
From the early maps of travellers and navigators, from
observations upon soils and rocks by farmers and builders
and from studies of terrain by soldiers the sciences of
astronomy, geology, and geography have gradually
emerged.
Today the shape of the globe and the topography of
many countries and the age and variety of rocks all over
the continents and islands are known. There remain
gaps to fill, but by far the largest concern the floors of
the oceans and the whole interior of the earth. Indeed
virtually nothing was known about these major parts of
the earth until this century, when complicated physical
instruments began to be developed, which could examine
hidden places by indirect means, as an X-ray camera
explores the vital organs of a human being. This indirect
study of the earth is the new science of geophysics.

### Are the continents drifting?
DRIFTING CONTINENTS (Cont'd)
The earth-a soft-boiled egg
One of the earliest things discovered about the earth's
interior was that it must be very hot. This was a simple
deduction by miners who found that the rocks got
approximately one degree hotter for every 50 metres they
dug down into the earth. Thus below a depth of a few
tens of kilometres, the whole interior is believed to be
white hot and only the pressure of its own weight keeps
much of the earth from melting. Miners also saw that
the strata in mountains had been crumpled and when
Kelvin and Helmholtz pointed out that the earth must
be radiating its heat and cooling, it seemed obvious to
all that the earth must be contracting. This was held
to be the force which crumpled strata and uplifted
mountains.
This view is the great classical contraction theory of
the earth. It is like a photograph. No motion of conti¬
nents has blurred the picture. The image of the earth's
history ls fixed and sharp. This view is still held by
many, but a great uncertainty was introduced by the
discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by the French scientist
Becquerel. Radioactive elements produce heat. No one
can measure the small but significant quantities of ura¬
nium and thorium in the earth, hence no one can tell
whether the earth is cooling or heating and whether the
earth is contracting. This now seems doubtful.
It took some time after the discovery of radioactivity
for all the implications to be assessed, but gradually some
men Including A. Holmes of Great Britain and D'.T.
Griggs of the United States came to believe that the earth
was producing more heat than it could lose by radiation.
They suggested that not only was the earth not contract¬
ing, but that the white-hot mantle probably had convec¬
tion-currents in it like those which rise and sink in a
saucepan heated on a stove.
F.A. Vening Meinesz of Holland added fresh evidence
from studies of gravity to support the idea that mountains
might be formed by the movement of such currents. This
picture of currents in the earth is like a painting by his
compatriot Van Gogh, for according to it the earth should
give the appearance of fluidity and flow.
This theory of convection currents has been particularly
favoured by physicists many of whom find it theoretically
satisfying, but since physicists do not In general know
much geology their articles have generally dealt with
idealized cases and until very recently this theory has not
been fitted to the earth's existing pattern of mountains
and rocks.
Nother theory advanced Independently as an
»alternative to the contraction hypothesis was
that of continental drift. To understand this it is essen¬
tial to record another great advance made in 1909 by the
Yugoslav seismologist A. Mohorovicic. He showed that
some earthquake waves are reflected within the earth
from the base of a thin outer crust. Other scientists soon
found a second reflecting horizon and divided the earth
into an interior core surrounded by two outer layers.
We thus know that a section through the earth has a
similar arrangement to the interior of an egg that has
been boiled for about three minutes. The egg has a thin
and brittle shell to which the crust of the earth corres¬
ponds. The white of the boiled egg, which is also solid,
and somewhat plastic, may be compared to the mantle of
the earth. The mantle is also solid (and white hot) . Just
as the white of the egg is formed of different material
than the shell, so is the mantle of the earth formed of
different and denser rocks than the crust.
At the centre of the earth is a liquid core, probably of
white-hot iron, which can be compared with the liquid
yolk of the boiled egg.
To a Danish woman scientist, the distinguished seismo¬
logist, Dr. E. Lehmann, belongs the credit for a further
refinement, the suggestion that within the liquid core, in
the very middle of the earth there may be a small solid
centre.
Since Mohorovicic's discovery, hundreds of determina¬
tions especially made by the United States over the
oceans and by the U.S.S.R. on land have shown that under
the oceans the crust of the earth is about 5 kilometres
thick and is either made of basalt lava or the altered
and hydrated top of the mantle. Under the continents, on
the other hand, the crust is from 30 kilometres thick under
the plains to as much as 70 kilometres under mountains,
and it is made of granitic rocks overlain by sedimentary
strata.
Scientists are so sure of this that the Mohole project
has been started in an attempt to drill holes through the
crust where it is thinnest so as to obtain samples of the
material of the mantle below. This work must be done
at sea, where the crust is thin (see page 18). The name
Mohole is of course a tribute to Mohorovicic who first

WANDERING AUSTRALIA. Recent studies of
magnetism in rocks have opened up new fields for
discussion of the idea that continents may have moved
great distances during the earth's history. Professor
S.K. Runcorn, a specialist In palaeomagnetlsm, has
seen evidence of continental drift in the changes
found in the direction of the magnetism of the earth's
rocks. An example of this is seen In the various posi¬
tions of Australia relative to the pole, plotted by Prof.
Runcorn. According to this diagram, beginning in
the Pre-Cambrian period (over 600 million years ago),
the continent set off from position (1) on a journey
through geological time. It sometimes approached
and sometimes receded from the pole at various times
before finally reaching its present-day position (13).

ALFRED WEGENER
From " Continental Drift "
edited by S.K. Runcorn.
© 1962 by Academic Press Inc.
When in 1912 the German meteorologist
Alfred Wegener formulated his theory
of continental drift the notion was
pooh-poohed by most scientists. Today,
however, a growing number are less
sure the principle was wrong. Wegener,
like many persons before him (including
Bacon) was struck by the fact that the
hump of South America fitted the
coastline of Africa, and pointed to an
amazing number of affinities of fossils, rocks and structures on
opposite sides of the Atlantic as evidence of his theory. He believed
that all the continents were once joined together in one super-
continent which later fragmented until they formed our present
land masses. Maps, above, first appeared in Wegener's "The Origin
of Continents and Oceans". (Present coastlines are shown and
lighter shading indicates former shallow seas.) In 1937 one of
Wegener's followers, the South African geologist A. L. Du Toit
suggested that there had been two primordial continents, a northern
Laurasia (Europe, Asia and North America) and a southern Gond-
wanaland (South America, Africa, Antarctica, plus India and Aus¬
tralia) separated by a seaway (Tethys). He made the detailed
jigsaw-puzzle analysis of the ancient rock structures of the African
and South American shorelines, shown in the map on right.

### Are the continents drifting?
DRIFTING CONTINENTS (Cont'd)
Memories of a great flood
demonstrated that the earth had a crust to drill through.'
Unlike the shell of an egg, which is uniform, the crust
of the earth has two great divisions, continents which are
thick and light and ocean floors which are thinner and
denser. Both rest upon the mantle of still heavier rocks
and can be even considered to float upon it.
The concept that continents form dry land because they
are lighter and float higher than the ocean floors is a
strange one, but . it ls easier to comprehend when one
realizes that only the crust of the earth is chilled and
brittle, while the whole interior is a white hot ball, capa¬
ble of slow, plastic creep.
Indeed in Scandinavia and in Canada there is very
convincing evidence that the crust really does float and
that its level has risen and fallen in response to varying
loads upon it. The loads which provided these tests were
Ice-sheets, about two miles thick which covered most of
Scandinavia and Canada, as Greenland and Antarctica
are covered today. The old moraines, disturbed soil,
transported boulders and scratched bedrock show where
these ice sheets lay until they melted rather quickly due
to a sudden warming of the climate about 10,000 years
ago.
This removal of the loads which had been depressing the
g land allowed it to rise or float very slowly upwards and
many beaches, formed at sea level, but now raised as
much as several hundreds of metres above It record the
steady elevation of the land where It had formerly been
depressed. The maximum rate of rise of the land is about
one centimetre a year in northern Finland.
Incidentally the melting of such enormous volumes of
ice affected sea level all over the world. The addition of
so much melt-water raised sea level by about 50 metres
in places which had not been glaciated and must have
flooded many coastal settlements. It seems probable that
memories and traditions of this great flood have been
handed down to us. This Inundation is a possible source
of the story of Atlantis, which the movement of continents
could not possibly provide, because human history and
existence are so young compared with major geological
events.
When the capacity of the earth to flow and move up
and down in a vertical direction had been demonstrated,
one can understand the great significance of the sugges¬
tion made in 1912 by the German meteorologist, Alfred
Wegener, that if the land could slowly move up and down
that it might also be able to move sideways at a similar
rate of a centimetre or a few centimetres a year.
He suggested that, if this happened, the parallelism of
the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean could be explained.
For, at that rate, Europe and North America could have
moved apart in a few hundred million years. The earth
is so old that there is time, even at such a slow rate for
oceans to have been opened and closed, perhaps not just
once, but several times.

### Are the continents drifting?
T^ggey«gr«g5SCTffg^ *K¡*m~*m¿i»*>nxs*.ji\*esm
The world's mightiest mountain range is a continuous sub¬
marine ridge with a rift along its top running (map left) down
the North and South Atlantic Oceans, then across the Indian
Ocean and, south of Australia, across the Pacific to the west
coast of Mexico. It is hundreds of kilometres wide and several
kilometres high and its rocks are unusually hot and volcanic.
A branch of the Indian Ocean ridge has invaded Africa along
the Great Rift Valley which cleaves the high plateaux of East
Africa. Some scientists have concluded that the mid-ocean
ridges mark the places where present continents split opart
and see the Rift Valley in East Africa as an early stage in tho
development of a new ocean and the beginning of the frog-
mentation of Africa. Profiles below show the close similarity
of the rifted ridge in Africa and three ocean ridges including (4)
the Atlantic Ridge. Locations of profiles are shown on left.

Some scientists immediately opposed his Ideas and many
do so still. Others supported it from the beginning, in
particular geologists in India, Africa and Australia, who
had already noticed many striking similarities between the
fossils and strata of their continents. But they could only
study the land surface and for many years the propo¬
nents of drift could neither explain what caused conti¬
nents to move, nor could they see the ocean floor where
the evidence of rifting and the passage of continents
should lie. This was a great weakness.
This idea of moving continents about did not appeal to
most believers in a fixed and contracting earth. They
were like admirers of Vermeer who have been shown their
first Picasso. They did not like it and they said that
continental drift Was non-representational, which is a
much more derogatory epithet when applied in science
than it is in art.
Yet another hypothesis is that the continents have
been growing. It was first advanced by geologists who
noticed that mountain ranges are often peripheral to
continents. They suggested that successive ranges had
been added without any motion of the continents. The
work of Italian, Japanese and German scientists upon
volcanoes and more recently investigations in Hawaii have
shown that lava probably rises from depths of the order
of 100 kilometres and that It may accumulate as additions
to the crust.
Hess at Princeton and Dietz and Menard in California
have discussed how these additions might be converted to
continental foundations. Modern geochemistry, which
was founded by such Russian scientists as Vernadsky,
Fersman and Vinogadov and by Goldschmldt of Norway,
has been used to support the idea of growth as have
isotopic studies in Great Britain, Switzerland, Canada and
in Massachusetts. These include the discovery that the
shields of old rocks In the heart of continents are zoned
with a tendency for the older rocks to He towards the
centres.
In recapitulation we can thus see that the early concept
of a rigid earth, with permanent continents and ocean
basins, in which mountains were built as a consequence
of cooling and contraction, while still considered valid by
some has increasingly been replaced by three new
hypotheses, each of which is incomplete by Itself.
These new theories are the physical theory of convec¬
tion currents, which still requires to be related to geo¬
logical observations ; the geological theory of continental
drift which needs a physical explanation of why conti¬
nents are considered to move and what force can exist
to move them ; and the geochemical Idea of growth of
continents, which does nothing to explain whether
continents are fixed or moving.
The rest of this article will be devoted to a summary of
some of the discoveries of the last few years. These
provide a suggestion that it may be possible to integrate
all three of the more recent theories into a more satis¬
factory replacement for the now generally out-moded
contractive theory of the earth's behaviour.
One of the great new discoveries has been largely due g
to the French scientists Chevallier and Thellier, although

### Are the continents drifting?
DRIFTING CONTINENTS (Cont'd)
STAGNA
I ! -.
From '" Scientific American ", April 1963
20,000 leagues of mountains under the sea
it has been followed up in Britain and Australia. This
is that when rocks are formed, whether by sedimentation
or by the cooling of lavas, they are likely to have locked
into them a record of the prevailing direction of mag¬
netization.
This depends upon the latitude in which they lay. In
older rocks this ls found in general to be different from
their present latitude. The progressive nature of the
change observed in rocks of several ages collected from
the same region suggests that several continents have
been systematically moving. In particular Africa, India,
Australia and South America seem to have been moving
northward. Here is evidence favouring continental drift.
Modern exploration of the sea-floors has provided two
other important pieces of evidence to help to solve the
riddle. On the floor of the Pacific Ocean several great
fractures represented by cliffs up to 3 kilometres high and
as much as 3,000 kilometres long have been discovered,
Comparisons of the two sides of these scarps have
suggested horizontal displacements along them of as much
as 1,400 kilometres. Such motions are the largest known
and begin to approach those required for continental
drift.
In 1956 M. Ewing and B. C. Heezen of Columbia Uni¬
versity, New York, made a most remarkable discovery.
They suggested that a number of great ridges known to
exist on the floors of the oceans were continuous and
formed a single mountain chain right down the middle
of the North and South Atlantic Oceans, thence south of
Africa across the Indian Ocean and south of Australia
across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Mexico.

| pon this great mid-ocean ridge lie many active
or recently active volcanic islands, including
Iceland, the Azores, Ascension, Tristan de Cunha, Kergue-
len, and Easter Island. This submarine ridge is the
greatest mountain system in the world, for it extends for
the best part of 20,000 leagues under the sea; it is every¬
where hundreds of kilometres wide; and it is several kilo¬
metres high.
The properties of this ridge are even more remarkable.
Its rocks are unusually hot and volcanic. In the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans it lies very precisely in the middle of
the Oceans, half way between adjacent continents. It
seems to be in the process of being torn apart, in contrast
to the better-known young mountains on land which have
been compressed.
There are thus two great mountain systems on earth,
complementary to one another. The mid-ocean system
has just been described. The continental system which
was first recognized by E. Suess, an Austrian, consists of
two belts, one around the borders of the Pacific Ocean and
the other across Eurasia. The first consists of the Andes,
and Cordilleran mountains and the island areas of the
Aleutians and East Asia through Kamtchatka, Japan,
the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and small islands
to New Zealand. The other belt consists of the Alpine
and Himalayan mountains extending from Spain all the
way across the Mediterranean and Southern Asia to join
the first belt in Indonesia.
When we consider the concept of convection
currents in the light of these discoveries, it
seems possible to believe that the upward currents might
be rising beneath the mid-ocean ridges and sinking
beneath the better known belts of continental mountains
and island areas.
According to this view the heat, the volcanoes and the
tension which marks the mid-ocean system derive from
hot currents that rise to feed volcanoes and separate to
tear the brittle crust apart while the characteristics of
the continental mountains are a result of the flowing
together of the same currents to produce compression.
Their descent sucks down the great deep trenches of the
ocean all of which lie close to chains of Islands, off
Kamchatka, Japan, the Philippines, the West Indies and
elsewhere. The crust and upper mantle , are cold and
brittle and earthquakes occur when it is broken due to
flow beneath.
An important contribution to this theory is Hess's
suggestion that whereas the continents are true rafts of
lighter material, the oceanic crust is only altered mantle
top which on being dragged down reverts to unaltered
mantle again.
This concept provides a geographical and a geological
setting that was lacking in earlier discussions of convec¬
tion. There is even some evidence that the direction of
flow is recorded in ridges or stream lines on the ocean
floors.
Unfortunately, although we may believe that we can
map the direction of flow, we cannot yet measure it
directly. It is thought to be only about three centimetres

### Are the continents drifting?
One of the more challenging and controversial ideas recently
advanced is that continents have moved to their present positions
under the impulsion of convection currents welling up from deep
in the earth's mantle. The same process has also been said to
have created the world's mighty mid-ocean submarine ridge and
has formed mountain ranges and earthquake belts. Drawing, left,
illustrates this theory. On right currents move up in area of mid-
ocean ridge, feeding presently-active volcanoes (Tristan da
Cunha, Iceland, Azores, etc.). Inactive volcanic cones which
have been moved sideways by flow of convection currents form
lateral ridges. Continent, on left, has been pushed along to point
where convection current sinks towards earth's centre. Since
continents are lighter than the mantle material of the ocean floor,
they are not sucked down into the deep oceanic trench created
by the current, but pile up to form mountains. Earthquake zone is
created (crosses) when cold and brittle crust and upper mantle is
broken because of flow movements of convection current beneath.
Such are the complications of silicate chcmLstry that
each melting leads to the separation and eruption of rocks
more siliceous and also less dense than their parents.
Basalt ls lighter and more siliceous than the mantle ; the
new volcanoes such as those of the Andes, Italy, Japan,
Indonesia and of the continental margins arc In general
yet more siliceous than basalt.
These rocks are eroded again, some to be carried back
to the ocean trenches where they can again be dragged
down and remelted, others are laid down as stratified
sediments, others again are recrystalllzed Into continental
basements. As the complex process continued soils
developed and the home of man was prepared for him.
The age of the earth is perhaps four or five thousand
million years. The record of the first third of that history
has been lost, but the rocks preserve the rest and now that
we can Indirectly explore the earth's interior and Its ocean
floors we are approaching the time when we will have a
satisfactory and agreed theory with which to unravel that
history. In the meantime it ls only fair to say that the
scientists are still arguing one with another as they
struggle to solve these problems.
a year and this small change cannot be measured across
the width of an ocean.
If we accept this concept it also can provide the
mechanism which was missing in early statements about
continental drift: one must suppose that the currents have
carried the continents like rafts away from the mid-ocean
ridges equally on either side until they have become
stranded at the edge of down currents.
The Americas and East Asia, are pushing against the
downflow around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, while
India, Arabia and Africa are thrust against Eurasia over
another downward flow. The current has been carrying
these continents and also Australia northwards, which
agrees with the observations on remanent magnetism.
The periodicity of mountain-building can also be
understood. This periodicity is shown by the fact that in
Europe the Alpine chains have replaced the formerly
active mountain chains of Scandinavia, of the Urals and
of Scotland while in North America the Rockies have
taken the place of the once great and active Appalachian
Mountains.
If drift has been going on It has not occurred just once
but by changing patterns of convection currents within
the white-hot, solid but slightly plastic mantle, like
currents boiling in a pan, but on a infinitely greater and
slower scale.
Each different pattern has produced a different moun¬
tain chain, first one added on one side of a continent, then
one on another. Elsewhere, when a new rising current
has started, continents have by the same process been
torn apart, as Is happening, or so it appears, in the Red
Sea, and in the rift valleys of Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
Burundi, Congo and Tanganyika today.
We have spoken of the growth of continents.
That they do grow is a view more widely held
than that they move. From what do they grow? The first
rock produced by partial melting in the earth is basalt
which flows so abundantly to the surface in Iceland, in
Hawaii and has done so in the past in the Deccan of India
and in the Parana basin and Patagonia of South America.
The basalt, erupted on the sea floor, is eventually carried
by convection currents Into the ocean deeps where it is
inexorably dragged down by the same currents to be
melted and to rise again.
H ere the progress being made In those attempts
I has been reviewed. There ls not yet general
agreement, but an agreed solution seems to be In sight.
Perhaps there is enough agreement to offer answers to the
Initial questions which we raised. Most workers agree
that although the Earth and the Moon may have been
formed together, that so many changes have occurred on
earth and that the properties of the moon differ so much
from those of the earth's surface, it is most improbable
that the Pacific Ocean basin has anything to do with the
moon.
If Atlantis was lost beneath the sea it probably ls a
memory of a great flood which occurred due to the melting
of North America and Scandinavia Ice-sheets 10,000 years
ago. In any case it has nothing to do with the major
events of geological history which occurred long before
mankind had appeared on earth.
It Is quite possible, and becoming more probable all
the time as new evidence pours In, that continents have
moved apart and that the Atlantic Ocean is a result of
the separation of Europe from North America, and of
Africa for South America. Not all scientists agree to this
yet, and once one accepts that the continents can move
there are an Infinite number of ways in which they might
have done so.
The rapid rate of exploration of the ocean floors and of
geophysical discovery should soon lead to a firm decision.
This Is badly needed, for until it Ls settled whether conti¬
nents have moved, and if so by what paths, no complete
answers are possible to the major problems of geology,
of geophysics, of past climates and of evolution itself.
We are sure that In all the vast record of the rocks, there
ls no evidence of immense earth-shaking convulsions. The
earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic outbursts that man
has experienced are terrible enough, but their effects are
local. We believe that the earth has developed in gradual
majesty by the slow operation of the same processes that
we see in action about us today. The earth ls stable and
our home ls a safe one.

ER MANTLE PROJECT
by Vladimir V. Beloussov
I n many respects we know more about distant
space than we do about what ls going on
under our feet. The deepest shaft so far sunk anywhere
in the world ls little more than seven kilometres In length
a mere pln-prlck compared to the earth's radius which
ls about 6,370 kilometres.
Even the vast research programme of the recent Inter¬
national Geophysical Year (1), during which thousands
of scientists from all countries Joined forces in studies
designed to reveal the secrets of our planet, was mainly
concerned with the study of physical phenomena taking
place above the solid crust of the earth in the oceans,
in the lower layers of the atmosphere, In the upper atmo¬
sphere and In clrcum-terrestial space.
The International Geophysical Year marked an epoch
in the history of the study of our planet. A completely
new picture of the life of the oceans was obtained:
currents were found at great depths, thus exploding the
old theory that waters lying immediately above the ocean
bed are stagnant; new mountains, mountain ranges and
depressions at the bottom of the ocean were mapped;
huge deposits of minerals were found scattered on the
sea bed in petrified form.
The study of glaciers enabled scientists to estimate the
volume of ice in the world and to show that the quantity
ls diminishing. Antarctica was "rediscovered," for more
was learned about it during the I.G.Y. than in all the
time that has elapsed since men first reached this ley
continent.
The I.G.Y. produced other results. It gave rise to new
forms of co-operation between scientists and provided an
inspiring example of the way In which International
collaboration can be developed in this domain. But its
results came almost entirely from observations made on
land, in the waters and In the air. The I.G.Y. paid little
attention to the interior of the planet.
It is true that some information about great depths,
even to the very centre of the earth, has been obtained
by geophysical means. But this is indirect information.
The data obtained tell us something of the physical
properties of the material of which the earth is made,
but reveal nothing of its chemical composition or of its
crystal and mineraloglcal structure.
The most widely used geophysical method ls selsmo-
graphy. Elastic seismic waves from earthquakes or man-
made explosions are studied during their passage through
the inner layers of the earth, and from their behaviour
scientists are able to determine some of the physical pro¬
perties of the matter they penetrate. Our conception of
the internal structure of the earth has been built up
mainly from the valuable information so acquired.
If to this we add our Ideas about the distribution of
pressure and temperature Inside the earth, we build up
quite a good picture of the material contained In the
inner parts of our globe. At best, however, these are
only assumptions and several different yet equally plau¬
sible deductions may be made from the same data. Even
today, scientists are not in agreement about the com¬
position of those layers of the earth's crust that cannot

### The Upper Mantle Project: world scientists join in a great venture
UPPER MANTLE PROJECT (Cont'd)
The unknown beneath us
be reached by drilling to say nothing of the deeper parts
of the planet.
There ls still considerable controversy regarding the
processes going on Inside the earth, processes that cause
the slow or rapid movements of the crust and the rise of
molten magma towards the surface; this magma either
remains below the surface as a solid body or breaks out
through the mouths of volcanic craters.
It may be asked whether It really ls Important for us
to know what the earth ls made of at great depths and
what processes are going on Inside it? There can only
be one answer to this question Yes! The theoretical pro¬
blems concerning the composition and structure of our
planet and the processes taking place inside it are of the
greatest importance. We live on earth, and no matter
how far away future cosmonauts may venture, they will
eventually return to this planet which will continue to be
man's real home. It would be strange if we had no urge
to know what our own house is made of or were satisfied
to make only chance guesses at what is hidden in its
distant storehouses and even in those quite close to us.
The problem also has a practical significance that
becomes all the greater as time goes on.
Modern technology, all modern civilization, in fact,
depends on mineral resources, because technology and
civilization itself are based on the use of metals dug out
of the earth in the form of ores. The raw materials for
our power supplies coal, oil, gas and atomic raw mate¬
rials are also extracted from the earth. Lastly, building
materials, too, come from the earth.
14
s technology develops man requires more and
^more mineral wealth, but the minerals are be¬
coming harder to find. Man began to use stone to fashion
his first instruments axes, hammers, scrapers, knives by
picking up what was lying on the surface and adapting it
to his needs by chipping, shaping and grinding.
The first ores for smelting were obtained from places on
or near the surface. As time went by surface supplies
became exhausted and man had to delve deeper and
deeper into the earth to find the minerals he needed. Thus
mines have reached depths of over three kilometres and
wells have been sunk to a depth of over seven kilometres.
As the most accessible resources run out, the prospecting
of mineral deposits at greater depths becomes increasingly
difficult. When geologists prospected for deposits lying at
depths of a few dozen or a few hundred metres, they often
found clues to their presence on the surface.
A spring containing iron pyrites, for example, might
indicate a deposit of ore some distance down. But when
deposits lie at a depth of several kilometres It is no use
counting on such tell-tale signs. These "blind" deposits
are completely hidden inside the earth and give no indica¬
tions of their existence on the surface. What is the geo¬
logist to do under these circumstances?
It is here that the theory of scientific forecasting comes
into the picture. It should be possible to forecast which
minerals we may expect to find in the depths of the earth
and where they lie. The theory must be based on a
correct conception of the conditions under which various
minerals are formed. Many minerals, metal ores, for
example, result from processes taking place in molten
magma. They are crystallized either directly out of the
magma, or out of the hot aqueous solutions or vapours
that rise from the magma as it solidifies inside the earth.
Movements of the earth's crust have a tremendous effect
on the formation and accumulation of minerals. Such
movements lead to the appearance of crevices in the crust,
vapours and solutions rise up through these cracks and
deposit metal ores on their walls in the form of minerals.
HOW TO BEND

zontal layers, these

its crust). In labora¬
tory experiments

The movement of the crust also leads to the bending of
its layers and the formation of domes and undulating
folds. Dome-shaped folds, or bulges, offer favourable
places for the accumulation of such light minerals as oil
and combustible gas.
From this it follows that to evolve a theory capable of
giving an accurate forecast of which minerals we may
hope to find and where they are to be sought, we must
understand the causes of the formation and movements
of the molten magma, the causes of the movements of
the earth's crust and also the natural laws governing
these movements.
The movements of the crust are called tectonic move¬
ments: they take the form of the slow rising and sinking
of the earth's surface, the crushing of the strata into
folds, the formation of crevasses, and, lastly, earthquakes.
Incidentally, an explanation of the causes of tectonic
movements and the laws governing them, is also necessary
for the elaboration of methods forecasting the probable
times and sites of future earthquakes.
The causes of magmatic phenomena and tectonic move¬
ments are buried deep down inside the earth; a thorough
study of those depths must therefore be made for practical
as well as theoretical reasons. We now know that the
main causes of the formation and rise of magma and of
all tectonic movements are to be found below the crust, In
the layer of the earth known as the mantle; the mantle
stretches all the way from the crust to the earth's core,
which lies at a depth of 2,900 kilometres from the surface.
It is only the upper part of the mantle, to a depth of
about a thousand kilometres, that is active.
This outer mantle is today believed to be the place where
## [Page 15](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/063437engo.pdf#page=15) 🆗
### The Upper Mantle Project: world scientists join in a great venture
magma originates and from where it rises to the surface;
here, too, the movement of matter and changes in its
volume begin and these processes are reflected on the sur¬
face as movements and deformations of the crust.
The need for further investigation led to the elabora¬
tion, in 1960, of an international research project; the
plan has been given the name of the "Upper Mantle and
its Effect on the Development of the Earth's Crust," or,
more briefly, the Upper Mantle Project. The scheme has
attracted the attention of scientists all over the world and
many countries have announced their readiness to parti¬
cipate.
The general purpose of the project is to extend as far
as possible our knowledge of the composition of the crust
and upper mantle and of the processes taking place in
them. The "heart" of the project is the combination of
the methods employed by all branches of science that
study the earth geophysics, geology, geochemistry and
geodesy.
At one time, geology was the only science that studied
the interior of the earth, its structure and development.
Owing to the limitations of its methods, geology was
unable to "see" more than a few kilometres into the
earth, and then only on dry land. In the present century
two new branches of science, geophysics and geochemistry,
have emerged; they study the deep regions of the globe
that geological methods are unable to reach.
As we have seen, the data provided by these sciences
are indirect, whereas geology provides direct information
about the upper layers of the earth's crust. Unfortunately,
geologists, geochemists and geophysicists have been, and
still are, working independently of each other, but if they
are to solve the problem of the nature and causes of
magmatic and tectonic phenomena they must combine
their efforts in joint studies.
Geology cannot carry out the task alone because Infor¬
mation on the outer mantle, where the causes of mag¬
matic and tectonic phenomena are to be found, can be
obtained only from geophysical and geochemlcal data.
Geophysics and geochemistry are also unable to carry out
the work alone because account must be taken of the way
magmatic and tectonic processes are reflected on the sur¬
face and also of their history throughout geological time.
Geodesic measurements are also important for the study
of contemporary movements of the earth's crust.
The general problem set for the Upper Mantle Project
must be solved by comparing the surface structure and
development of the earth's crust with the structure of the
lower layers of the crust and the upper mantle. The sur¬
face of the earth's crust is divided Into numerous areas
differing in structure or in history. These are usually
called tectonic areas, and the concrete task of the project
is a comparative study of their structure in depth.
Examples of these areas on the continents are the folds
of various ages, stable platforms, crystalline shields, and
so on, and In the ocean, abyssal valleys, very deep, narrow
trenches, submarine mountain ranges, etc. The continents
and the oceans are themselves the biggest tectonic divi¬
sions.
Geology, mainly the branch known as geotectonlcs, has *5
shown us that individual tectonic areas reflect different

UPPER MANTLE PROJECT (Cont'd)
The deep roots of the earth's crust
stages in the development of the earth's crust. At some
time in the past the entire crust was extremely mobile.
Folds were formed, mountains took shape, and magmatic
processes were very active.
Later, in a period separated from us by some 1,500 mil¬
lion years, stable areas, or platforms, began to make their
appearance while the crust surrounding them continued
in a state of turbulence. The platforms gradually in¬
creased in area and the moving strips between them grew
narrower.
Then, In the last period of geological time, about twenty
million years ago, the platforms came to cover the con¬
tinents almost completely and a new form of activity
began: mountains appeared on the platforms as secon¬
dary formations. Thus the highest mountains now in
existence, such as the Tien Shan, the Pamirs, the moun¬
tains of Tibet and still others, came into being. From
this we see that the stage of secondary mountain forma¬
tion followed the platform stage and the latter came after
the stage of the great mobility of the earth's crust.
IIt is important to bear in mind that the earth's
crust is not developing evenly; some areas go
through their development rapidly, others lag behind.
For this reason tectonic areas belonging to different stages
of development exist side by side and we are able to
observe them simultaneously.
This is an advantage to us; it enables us to get a picture
of the deep-lying structures under each tectonic area and
to determine the way in which its structure changes with
time. We have only to compare the structure in depth of
those areas belonging to early stages with those that
belong to later stages to be able to get some idea of the
nature of the processes taking place at great depths.
So far we actually know very little about the structure
of the earth's crust and of the upper mantle, but the
little we know allows us to make some interesting
assumptions.
It has long been known from seismographic data that
the earth's crust has a different structure under the
continents and under the oceans. It is thicker under the
continents (averaging 35 kilometres and increasing under
the mountain ranges to as much as 70 kilometres). Under
the oceans, the crust is no more than five or six kilometres
thick.
The crust under the continents consists of several strata,
of which the most important are the upper, or "granite"
and the lower, or "basalt" strata. The upper stratum,
according to geological data, has a thickness ranging from
ten to twenty kilometres and ls actually composed of
granite or similar rocks.
Nothing whatever is known of the composition of the
so-called "basalt" stratum. It has been given that name
because elastic seismic waves penetrate it at the same
speed as they penetrate basalt, a volcanic rock rich in
magnesium and iron.
Under the oceans, there is no granite stratum at all and
the crust there consists only of a basalt stratum (not
counting, of course, the seabed deposits). In this case it
ls extremely likely that the stratum actually consists of
basalt, because the numerous volcanoes on the ocean bed
and on oceanic islands erupt only basalt lava. The oceanic
crust, too, is thicker under the mountains and thinner
under the plains.
The earth's crust is bounded below by what ls known as
the Mohorovicic Discontinuity, named after the Serbian
scientist who discovered it. In passing this divide the
1fi velocity of seismic waves undergoes a sharp change.
Above the divide the velocity is lower; after passing the
divide it is noticeably higher. The earth's mantle begins
at the divide, and the first thousand kilometres of it
constitute the upper mantle. We do not know what the
upper mantle is made of, but there is no doubt that it is
solid matter and that it is heavier than the materials
which make up the earth's core. It contains a larger com¬
ponent of magnesium and iron than the "basalt" stratum.
Until quite recently it was believed that although the
crust changes In structure and thickness from one tec¬
tonic area to another, the mantle is everywhere identical.
It has now been established that this is not so. The first
discovery was the difference in the structure of the upper
mantle under the continents and oceans.
In both cases the mantle contains a stratum that is
somewhat softer than the strata above and below it ; in
this stratum the velocity of seismic waves is slightly lower
than in the other strata. This soft stratum is called the
asthenosphere. It seems to be of great importance, since
molten magma is born there and it is the site of those
movements of matter and changes In its volume that
affect the surface in the form of tectonic movements.
It was then discovered that this asthenosphere ls thicker
under the oceans than it Is under the continents (300 kilo¬
metres as compared to 150 kilometres). Furthermore it is
now known that the mantle also differs in structure under
tectonic areas of smaller size than continents and oceans
under folds and platforms of different ages, under big
plateaux and depressions, under strings of islands and
submarine mountain ranges, etc. This shows that the
surface structure of the earth's crust has Its "roots" at
the very greatest depth, at least some hundreds of kilo¬
metres, and that the development of the crust is intim¬
ately connected with that of the outer mantle.
This knowledge has compelled us to reject all the tec¬
tonic hypotheses that assume independent development of
the crust and the outer mantle and the absence of any
connexion between them. One of these, the hypothesis of
shifting continents, was proposed by the German geo¬
physicist, Alfred Wegener, at a time when very little
information of the earth's interior was available.
We cannot today admit the possibility of parts
of the continental crust moving across the
surface of the mantle. We see that the causes of move¬
ments of the crust, of the rising and sinking of parts of
it, are to be found in the outer mantle ; if the crust moved
independently of the mantle, the rising and sinking areas
would move across the surface of the continents. Such
areas, however, remain fixed in one place for a very long
time.
The area known as the Baltic Shield, for instance, has
been slowly rising for something 'Hike 600 million years.
If we accept the hypothesis of the horizontal shifting of
continents, we must also assume that the crust under
them moves together with the mantle. In other words, we
must assume that It Is not a thin crust some thirty or
forty kilometres thick that moves, but a tremendous mass
with a thickness of a thousand kilometres, which is
obviously impossible.
Another important discovery that has been made is
that the earth's crust can In the course of time not only
become thicker, but also thinner. It is now known that
the rising areas of the crust are thicker and the sinking
areas thinner. Geological history, however, tells us that
many of the areas that are at present sinking, formerly
rose. This must mean that the crust under them was
formerly thicker.
This discovery is Important because it has led scientists
to the unanimous conclusion that the crust is made of
lighter materials than the mantle, and that the lighter
materials were gradually exuded out of the mantle in a

### The Upper Mantle Project: world scientists join in a great venture
molten state and floated towards the surface. This melting
is due to the heat generated by the disintegration of radio¬
active elements.
Today there is every reason to attach great importance
to the melting process in the development of the earth.
It may even be basic, it may be the primary cause of all
magmatic and tectonic phenomena. It might seem that
the process could develop only in one direction and that
the crust must, as time goes on, become ever thicker.
Actually the matter is more complicated than this ;
parallel to the direct process, which makes the crust
thicker, there is the reverse process, the destruction or
reduction of the crust that is probably due to the melting
of its lower strata caused by increases in temperature in
the mantle.
If the first point of view is correct we shall have to
regard the basalt crust of the oceans as the older, and
as having been formed when the flow of molten matter
from the mantle was still going on. In this case the con¬
tinental crust must be younger, since Its formation
required the flow of greater quantities of light molten
matter from the mantle.
If this Is true, more and more new continents should be
rising out of the oceans and their area should be cons¬
tantly increasing. If the reverse process is taking place
and the crust is becoming thinner, some continents should
collapse and become ocean beds. A number of facts point
to this conversion of continents into oceans as a dominant
tendency in the last geological period.
Research foreseen as part of the Upper Mantle Project
should provide answers to these and many similar ques¬
tions concerning the magmatic and tectonic life of the
earth's crust.
One interesting problem is that of the folding of rocks.
OUR RESTLESS EARTH. In an average year there are
about 20 major earthquakes and hundreds of thousands
of minor tremors, most of them passing unnoticed.
Fissure shown here was caused in a few seconds by an
earthquake which struck Mongolia on December 4, 1957.
Official Soviet photo
For a long time It was believed that folding ls due to the
contraction of the earth's surface and the reduction of
the volume of the earth. Opinions on this question have
now changed. The cooling and contraction of the earth
are impossible, primarily because radioactive elements
Inside the earth are constantly producing so much heat
that it Is more likely that the earth is gradually becoming
warmer and not cooler.
It ls probable that the primary cause of the folds ls the
vertical movement of Individual masses, separated from
each other by cracks that penetrate the entire crust and
enter the mantle. These masses move up and down like
piano keys. The folds are formed by layers of the rising
masses slowly slipping on to lower surroundings under
their own weight.
In general, there Is every reason to believe that vertical
movement, the rising and sinking of different areas, has
the greatest significance In the life of the earth's crust.
These movements are going on constantly. In the past
they produced countless changes In the configuration of
land and sea, they made mountains and caused de¬
pressions to form. Today these movements can be
observed by geodesic methods; the usual rate of movement
is a few millimetres a year, rarely as much as one or two
centimetres.'
he comparative study of the various tectonic
areas in accordance with the Upper Mantle
Project must be carried on Jointly by geophysical, geoche-
mical and geological methods, all of which must serve to
complement each other. Since not all types of tectonic
areas are to be found in any one country, not even in
countries as big as the U.S.S.R. or the U.S.A., it ls im¬
portant that the work should cover, as far as possible, the
entire surface of the earth.
Great hopes are being placed in ultra-deep drilling.
Two projects exist. The American project ls to drill
through the thin crust under the ocean floor, enter the
upper mantle with the drill head and establish the com¬
position and properties of the mantle. This project has
been launched by a test drilling in the Pacific Ocean off
the shore of Southern California.
The Soviet project Is to drill through the continental
crust for the purpose of studying the structure of the gra¬
nite layer and, as far as possible, also the "basalt" layer
of the earth's crust. It ls not improbable that on some
offshore island, where the crust ls thinner at the Junction
of ocean and continent, the drills may reach the upper
mantle. It is estimated that the first Soviet wells to be
sunk will be from twelve to fifteen kilometres deep.
Thus these two projects, the American and the Soviet,
will complement each other ; they are an excellent
demonstration of the advantage to be gained from Inter¬
national scientific co-operation.
Geologists, geophyslclsts and geochemlsts expect a great
deal from the Upper Mantle Project. A few years of spe¬
cialized study will bring our knowledge of the Interior of
the earth up to a completely new level. We shall learn
what matter lies in the depths and how It behaves, and
then the period of vague guesses and weakly-grounded
hypotheses and fantasies (of which the sciences studying
the earth have had far too many) will give place to a
new period of precise knowledge.
At the same time the practical possibility of using the
wealth hidden in the bowels of the earth, both mineral
and energy resources, will be greatly enhanced. It is well
within the bounds of possibility that each deep well bored
into the earth will itself serve as a source of underground
heat energy since it must pass through temperature belts
of 300° to 400» C.

### The Hidden world of volcanoes
THE HI 111 WORLD
OF VOLCANOES
by Haroun Tazieff
WE still commonly hear it said that volcanic
upheavals are far less violent today than they
were in earlier geological periods, that they are mere pin¬
pricks on the earth's skin, trivial by comparison with the
mighty terrestial convulsions during which great ranges
of twisted mountains like the Alps or Himalayas emerged
from the depths of the vast oceanic abysses.
There is no doubt that during some periods in the
earth's history volcanoes were more numerous and more
violent than in the present brief moment of our planet's
existence; but there have also been many other epochs in
which volcanic disturbances were even milder than they
are nowadays. It would, in fact, be a serious mistake to
accept the "official" figure of between 650 and 700 vol¬
canoes considered as currently active; this is a very
restricted figure which applies solely to volcanic craters
that have erupted during recorded history.
Two factors in the calculation completely falsify it. The
first ls the concept of recorded history itself: it amounts
to two or three thousand years in the tiny areas of the
old scientific civilizations of the Mediterranean and the
Far East, four or five centuries in Latin America and Indo¬
nesia, two for most of the Pacific, Kamchatka and the
Aleutians and only one for Central Africano more than
the twinkling of an eye when compared to the immense
duration of the geological ages!
The lives of volcanoes, however, are measured on a geo¬
logical time scale. How many of the so-called extinct vol¬
canoes throughout the world are merely dormant, sunk
in sleep during which physico-chemical processes take
place that will lead to new eruptions? There are perhaps
hundreds, even thousands of such cases; at least as many,
and probably more than those so far counted.
The second reason for this error in calculation is our
ignorance about what goes on over the major part of the
earth's surface in the depths of the oceans. Only now is
some light being shed on its mysteries.
he odds against a submarine eruption being
detected are several thousand to one. First of
all the ocean is deserted to a degree forgotten by people
who never travel over it and who only think of it in terms
of atlases and maps. To detect the relatively rare sub¬
marine eruptions that are visible on the surface a boat
or aircraft would have to be passing directly or almost
directly above the eruption at the very moment (often no
more than that), when it occurred. Finally, as most
undersea eruptions occur at depths of several thousand
yards any discharge of vapours is impossible because even
6,000 feet down, the hydrostatic pressure is greater than
the critical pressure of the water.
Thus, the eruption cannot be an explosive one, and the
molten lava spreads quietly over the marine depths in
the same way as a sill Is created between two strata within
the earth's crust, but in this case between land and sea.
The first gases which escape from the magma dissolve in
the water on account of the high hydrostatic pressure.
on This also prevents the gases from making a vesicular form
of lava which, reaching the surface as light pumice stones
would otherwise reveal what was happening In the depths.
But a study of ancient geological deposits provides clear
evidence that huge quantities of lava pour out in the
ocean deeps and on the sides of the géosynclinals in which
the mountains have their origin. Moreover, the great
submarine range which wanders for thousands of miles
in the middle of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, the
South Seas and the eastern Pacific, is most probably made
up entirely of lava which has accumulated to form a
thickness of thousands of metres enough to make even
the Himalayas feel small!
Current volcanic activity has thus built up gigantic
mountains, the most awe-inspiring being the Mauna Loa
in Hawaii rising to a height of 30,000 feet between its base
submerged 16,000 feet below sea-level and its crater at
an altitude of 14,000 feet.
olcanic activity has likewise poured out thou¬
sands of cubic miles of lava in the form of
basaltic or ignimbritic (1) "beds" spread over enormous
surfaces; It has emitted and is still emitting colossal
quantities of water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide
and other volatile components without which the com¬
position of sea water and of the atmosphere would be
utterly different.
It is not only the composition, moreover, but in all
likelihood the very existence of the oceans which is due
to volcanic activity since this extracts gases from the mag¬
ma a process undoubtedly responsible for the existence
of surface water and hence of life itself.
There is a third aspect which to peoples who inhabit the
unstable regions of our planet is of even greater impor¬
tance: the danger from volcanoes themselves.
Great volcanic catastrophes in which thousands of peo¬
ple are killed are relatively uncommon one, two or per¬
haps three in a century, as far as we know and also
allowing for the extreme shortness of recorded history;
but disasters involving hundreds of victims are quite
frequent.
In 1815, Tambora in the Indonesian island of Sumbawa
was decapitated by a series of tremendous explosions
which were heard 1,100 miles away; blocks of stone weigh¬
ing several pounds were hurled for distances of over
25 miles; the mountain's height was reduced by 3,000 feet;
300 miles away, the island of Madura was plunged into
complete darkness for three days, so thick and dense was
the colossal canopy of ash which covered this part of the
world ; some 92,000 human beings and millions of domestic
and wild animals died during this catastrophe.
Sixty-eight years later, In the same region, Krakatoa
caused the death of more than 36,000 people; three-quar¬
ters of the island of Rakata with an area of 12 square miles
(1) The problem of ignimbrites and ignimbrites them¬
selves were only recently discovered. The term was created
in 1932 by the New Zealand geologist Marshall from
"ignis," fire, and "imber," rain, to signify the way in
which highly silicic volcanic rocks are deposited over tre¬
mendous areas.

### The Hidden world of volcanoes
E, Aubert de la Rue BORN IN A CORNFIELD. The volcano Paracutin was born with dramatic suddenness in 1943
in a Mexican cornfield. Beginning as a tiny crack in the ground, it spewed forth cinders, ash,
lava and rock, growing 50 feet within 24 hours and reaching 1,000 feet within six months.
and an altitude of some 2,600 feet was shattered by explo¬
sions heard as far as Singapore and Australia, 2,500 miles
away; pumice and ash were hurled to a height of over
120,000 feet; then enormous subsidences occurred in the
subterranean hollow left by the eruption of cubic miles of
lava; this subsidence created a submarine caldera, a caul¬
dron-like cavity nearly four and a half miles wide, and
provoked tsunamis, incorrectly called tidal waves, which,
after devastating the coasts of the Sunda Straits, crossed
the Pacific and were felt as far away as Chile.
The 20th century was only two years old when the
Mt. Pelée disaster occurred, wiping out the town of
St. Pierre de la Martinique and its 28,000 inhabitants.
This eruption provided the scientific world with a new
phenomenon which the French mineralogist, Alfred
Lacroix, the first to study it, baptized "the fiery cloud."
This consists of a deadly combination of drops of molten
lava, ash, sand and rocks of all sizes suspended in gases
with a temperature of a thousand degrees. The explosion
which frees this cloud generally goes sideways rather than
upwards; it bursts through the weakest point In the side
of a dome of highly viscous lava which the pressure of the
gases forces slowly out.
Shooting out obliquely, the explosion then hurls its pul¬
verised lava, rock and fiery vapour In a specific direction.
The cloud rushes onwards, hurtles down slopes at speeds
which may range from 50 miles per hour to over 180, leaps
over natural obstacles such as ridges and sheer ravines
which may be In its path and spreads death and destruc¬
tion up to a distance of five or even ten miles (St. Pierre
was five miles from Mt. Pelée; Merapl on the island of
Java frequently causes deaths among the people living as
far as five miles away in the valleys round Its base).

have caused scores and possibly hundreds of thousands of
deaths if it had been situated in a more densely populated
country. Fortunately there were neither deaths nor
destruction since this volcano, Mt. Bezimiannyi (The
Nameless Mountain), is in a desert area of the Kamchatka
Peninsula.
The awakening of Mt. Bezimiannyi came with a violence
proportionate to the length of its sleep. Figures provided
by the Soviet volcanist, G.S. Gorshkov, who observed the
eruption from the Klioutchi Observatory, give some Idea
of its cataclysmic power: energy unleashed: 2.2 x IO25
ergs; energy released by the most violent single explosion
of March 30, 1956: 4 x IO23 ergs (40 million kw.-hours) ;
volume of rock ejected by the explosion: 1 cubic kilometre
(enough to bury Paris under a layer 50 feet thick) ; weight
of debris ejected: 2,400 million tons; initial velocity of
ejectments: between 1,650 and 1,970 feet per second
(1,100 to 1,200 miles per hour) ; initial pressure: 3,000 atmo¬
spheres; altitude reached by the eruptive cloud: 150,000
feet.
By good fortune, the other great eruption of this cen¬
tury, the Katmai eruption of 1912, also occurred in a
deserted region in the massive Aleutian volcanic range
which extends onto the American continent via the Alaska
peninsula. Its consequences were formidable: Mt. Katmai
was completely decapitated and a caldera three miles in
diameter appeared in place of the summit. Through frac¬
tures running right down to the mountain's north base,
a fantastic quantity (12-15 cubic kilometres) of pumice
was ejected. Powdered by the pressure of its own gases,
it spread like a fiery cloud, filling a valley 12 miles long
and three miles wide, thereby creating the ignimbrite of
the famous Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. Finally, an
entirely new volcano, emerged and was named Nova
Rupta.

### The Hidden world of volcanoes
As in the case of all such major upheavals, the explo¬
sions were heard over great distances, sometimes as far
as 600 miles off; ash covered many hundreds of square
miles, plunging the village of Kodiak, 100 miles away, into
darkness at noon. Even more extraordinary was the fact
that tectonic earthquakes accompanied the eruption and
were recorded by seismographs throughout the Northern
Hemisphere. This was the first and only recorded eruption
which produced ignimbrites.
The study of volcanic phenomena is rarely easy. Every¬
thing seems to conspire against those who seek to pene¬
trate the mysteries. The terrain is always difficult and
sometimes completely inaccessible. There is danger which
ls sometimes obvious and formidable and sometimes all
the greater for being concealed. It is quite impossible to
probe the depths of the volcano to find out what is
happening inside. Finally, the complexity of the volcanic
activities, intermingling in time and space, demands the
simultaneous presence of specialists from all the scientific
fields concerned in the investigation.
The time has passed when a single man such as Pliny
the Naturalist, or investigators like Hamilton, Spallanzanl;
Perret or Lacroix, could individually harvest enough facts
from their observations of an eruption to advance the sum
of human knowledge. Nowadays when the recording of
volcanic phenomena in ever more accurate figures is
increasingly important, the work of studying active vol¬
canoes has become essentially a team operation.
And merely to assemble a fully-representative group of
specialists on or near a volcano in eruption Is already
itself a difficult undertaking, for except In Japan there
are very few experts In vulcanology, and they are scattered
throughout the world, each In hLs own institute or uni¬
versity.
To attempt to bring enough of them together, rapidly
enough and at short notice, in response to the whim of
a volcano situated in some remote spot ls an almost hope¬
less task. It is for this reason that only very few eruptions
have so far been observed with all the resources now
available for taking the measure of all the multiple
aspects of volcanic activity.
That the dangers are in no way imaginary ls proved by
the disappearance of twelve Japanese experts and twenty
sailors who set out to investigate the submarine volcano
of Myojln Syo during its eruption In 1952. After many
days of fruitless searching, all that was found of the océa¬
nographie ship (hundreds of miles to the southwest where
they had been carried by the currents) were scraps of
planking, some wooden objects and a buoy riddled with
pieces of pumice-stone of obviously very viscous lava.
So far, it is only in Japan that eruptions have been
studied by adequately-representative scientific teams. In
other countries, problems of a practical kind (warnings
against catastrophes, for example) are either relatively
unimportant (in Italy, U.S.S.R., U.S.A., New Zealand, and
certain Australian territories) or, where more acute

### The Hidden world of volcanoes
VOLCANOES (Cont'd)
Exploring a lake of molten lava
problems exist, the official attitude towards scientific
research is unfortunately one of indifference.
Scientists can already forecast volcanic eruptions and
will probably soon be able to predict their violence and
hence the danger they present. But this is only possible
in the case of volcanoes which, constantly observed and
meticulously studied, thus become thoroughly familiar
to the specialists responsible for forecasting disturbances
likely to endanger the surrounding population.
In the few places around the world where there are pro¬
perly equipped and efficiently staffed vulcanological obser¬
vatories, it is now almost Impossible for an eruption to
take people by surprise.
But apart from these places Asama-Yama,
' Aso-San and Sakurajlma in Japan. Kilauea
in Hawaii, Klioutchevskof in Kamchatka. Vesuvius and
shortly, no doubt, Etna In Italy nowhere else today are
volcanoes kept under even the minimum supervision
required to prevent catastrophes. Java, where the pre¬
war vulcanological service has remained intact, still lacks
highly specialized teams, and a country which is in such
danger from upheavals In one or another of Its dozens
of formidable mountains of fire needs more than the
services of a few competent geophysicists. Much the same
applies to the Philippines, the Lesser Sundas, the Antilles
and to all the volcanic countries of Latin America.
Apart from Japan, it is in those regions where volcanic
activity ls either limited or utterly non-existent that,
paradoxically enough, most of the world's volcanlsts are
found today. And, it is equally paradoxical that in
Western Europe, it ls Belgium, a non-volcanic country,
that has revived its vigorous pre-war research into active
volcanoes.
It should be explained that the Impetus for this de¬
velopment came from the former Belgian Congo where, in
an area hardly more than ten miles by twelve, to the
north of Lake Kivu, there are eight large volcanoes, some
of them particularly violent. Eruptions are relatively fre¬
quent (ten In the course of half a century). However, by
far the most interesting feature of this region is the deep
Nlragongo crater, which posseses the only lake of perma¬
nently molten lava existing anywhere in the world.
Lakes of molten basalt quite often develop during the
eruption of a group of volcanoes but access to the area is
often subject to the same dangers that are found in active
craters. A permanent lake, however, provides an Ideal
subject for those probing the mysteries of volcanic acti¬
vity: there ls practically no danger and the basic matter
of the volcanic action molten lava and the gases It
emits Is abundant if not readily accessible.
By managing to descend the 650 foot wall of the large
caved-in crater of Nlragongo which had discouraged ear¬
lier attempts at exploration, I had the good fortune to
discover the existence of this lake, the only one of its
kind in the world today. This was In 1948, after which
ten years went by before it was possible to overcome the
opposition of the Chairman of the Belgian Congo National
Parks to any form of vulcanological research on Nlra¬
gongo.
It was only In 1958 that the first reconnaissance and
systematic expedition could be organized. The following
«J year a larger and more comprehensive expedition was sent,
in which Belgians, French and one Japanese scientist took
part.
The approach to the Nlragongo lava lake is much more
difficult than was the case with Kilauea in Hawaii whose
"fount of fire of Halemaumau" was rightly renowned
throughout the world during the century preceding its
disappearance in 1924. Unlike the case of Hawaii where
it was possible to drive up by car to the very edge of the
lake, the approach to Niragongo involves climbing a
mountain almost 12,000 feet high, first following elephant
tracks through the virgin forest and then clambering over
the hard dark lava which crowns this powerful cone,
abruptly truncated by the 3,600-foot wide crater.
Then comes the descent of the crater. Nearly 650 feet
of steep and dangerously unstable wall divides the crest
from the vast ring-shaped terrace which stretches out
horizontally from the foot of the wall.
This terrace surrounds the central well which is some
1,500 feet across. To reach this point, a vertical wall
nearly 600 feet high must be passed*. The treacherously
insecure rock which forms this wall would make it an
excessively hazardous obstacle even for experienced moun¬
tain-climbers.
Accordingly, we had a light cave-explorer's winch built,
and, suspended at the end of a thin steel cable attached
to this winch, each of us descended in turn like a spider
at the end of a strand of web, until we reached a second
ring-shaped terrace only a few dozen yards across.
A tent was pitched there and for a month this was our
advanced camp. Beyond this, a steep ledge measuring a
good twenty yards was surmounted by means of duralumin
ladders and we then made our way through a chaos of
huge fallen boulders until we reached the opening of the
narrow platform which, more than 1300 feet below the
crest of the crater, encircles the vast lake Itself.
Over the last ten years or so, the lake has shrunk
appreciably, from some 320,000 square feet to roughly
140,000. Even so, it remains one of nature's most extra¬
ordinary spectacles. The great stretch of molten rock ls
sometimes calm, covered with a strange skin as plastic and
shining as satin, then sometimes breaks out in currents,
purple whirlpools and incandescent "fountains" scatter¬
ing viscous magma over the steep banks on which we
would stand in a wonder born of delight and awe which
was felt even by the most matter-of-fact members of the
team.
H ere, cherry-coloured stalactites hung from the
I vaulted ceilings of fantastic fiery grottoes in
which torrents of lava, suddenly quickening their pace,
would be swallowed up; a rhythmical swell, like a recur¬
ring fever would sometimes seize the heavy liquid mass;
there were sluggish orange-coloured surges In the more
peaceful parts, and strange galleons of black rock on a
sea of dark fire; there was a roaring, a rumbling, and
sulphurous smells. All this helped to create around us a
closed universe which was miraculous and almost
terrifying.
In six weeks, this awe-inspiring, ever-changing splen¬
dour never once wearied or bored us. Nor, fortunately, did
It distract us from our Immense programme of work. Day
and night for weeks on end, each specialist carried out his
observations, made his measurements, analyses and
recordings. The results of the seismology, the spectrogra¬
ph^ of the volcanic flames, the terrestrial magnetism, the
gravimetry, the chemical composition of the gases, the
mineralogy of the lava, the analyses of the sublimates,
and the photogrammetry would probably not mean much

to anyone except a volcanist, but the figure for the heat
radiated by this infernal bath930,000 K.W.speaks for
itself.
It is far easier to reach the Italian volcanoes of Etna
and Stromboli because they are situated in a country
with a highly developed technology. But the final
approach to the burning lava and the vents in order to
collect samples of gases unmixed with pure air is, surpris¬
ingly enough, a much more hazardous operation than is
the case at the spectacular Nlragongo lake.
But the regular explosive activity of Etna and Stromboli
offers experts in the seismology of volcanoes a promising
field for exploration. The original team has expanded
since 1958 and is now made up of Italians, Frenchmen and
Belgians. Soon English scientists will be joining it and
later on, specialists from Finland, Hungary and elsewhere.
The primary aim of this physically fatiguing and often
baffling research, Is to understand the hows and whys
of volcanic activity. For these powerful terrestrial pheno¬
mena are far more vast and much more important than
the superficial movement of lava, however spectacular
and even deadly this may be.
As Alfred Rittmann, one of the outstanding volcanists
of our century, so aptly put it, "volcanic activity is a
process at work both within and below the earth's crust,
a process in which the liberation of gases from the crude
magma plays a rôle of primary importance In the history
of our planet's development" (1).
Rittmann drew up a vast synthesis in which he showed
how the earth has evolved from the original solar matter,
how the granitic continents were formed, how the pri¬
mitive atmosphere and ancestral oceans were created
all through the liberation of gases, the differentiations, the
movements involved in or caused by the magma. He
showed how the upsetting of balances, balances of tempe¬
rature, balances of weight, physical or chemical balances,
have throughout the four thousand million years and
more of the earth's existence caused, as they still do,
massive shifts within that magma, currents which mix it
in an attempt to restore the upset balance and thereby
exercise their colossal power on the crust of the earth.
It is in this way that the deep oceanic deeps are formed,
folds in the thin crust of basalt which forms the ocean
beds; sometimes these deeps develop Into géosynclinals
in which sediment brought by the rivers from the neigh¬
bouring continent accumulate to a depth of thousands
upon thousands of yards. And It ls from these géosyncli¬
nals, after a complex process of evolution lasting millions
of years, that the great mountain rangesAlps, Andes and
Himalayas emerge.
The whole of this vast orogenlc process ls due to the
movements of the magma, the same movements which,
when they break through the earth's crust at the points
of extreme pressure, allow the magma to rise and to burst
forth at the surface, thereby causing volcanic activities
in the narrow sense of the term.
It Is In this way that we must consider volcanic activity
if we genuinely seek to understand Its significance: as a
cosmic phenomenon which shapes the face and the
depths of the earth and in which eruptions arc no more
than a superficial aspect.
This fascinating side to volcanic research may strike
some people as somewhat irrelevant and even excessively
speculative; yet it ls an essential Ingredient for progress
in the two utilitarian aspects of vulcanology: the fore¬
casting of dangerous eruptions and the harnessing of the
formidable power of volcanoes.
As already pointed out, we may be able to foresee the
imminence of an eruption empirically but we cannot yet
predict either its violence or its duration, and without
these factors we cannot decide on the urgency and the
extent of the precautions to be taken. We shall, however,
attain a sufficient degree of accuracy when the true
mechanism of the phenomena is known, at least to a
greater degree than is achieved by the rough hypotheses
now employed.
Similarly, it ls through fundamental knowledge that we
will be able to develop and certainly In a very spectacular
fashion the exploitation of géothermie energy. Today
this new source of power has only begun to be tapped,
although already It has given magnificent returns, at Lar-
darello in Texas and at Wairakei in New Zealand.
Tomorrow, California and Kamchatka will benefit from
the millions of kilowatts recovered from those so abun¬
dantly provided by volcanoes. And this Inexhaustible
source of cheap power will assuredly be one of the most
productive throughout the world of the future.

300,000 EARTH
by E. M. Fournier d'Albe

fisiTORS to a famous selsmological observatory
in Australia are sometimes told a strange and
sad story:
Some years after the end of the First World War, an
eminent Japanese scientist was visiting Australia and
was taken to see this observatory. The director received
him with due ceremony, and then led him down to the
underground vaults where, in the darkness, the seismo¬
graphs were keeping their constant watch. The director
switched on the light in the vault. In those days, the
recordings were made mechanically, by thin steel pens
on smoked paper; (now It is more common to record on
photographic paper by means of a light beam reflected
from a galvanometer, and the vault has to be kept in
permanent darkness).
The visitor from Japan could see three instruments,
each one standing on a concrete pillar about a metre
high. In a corner, a large clock was ticking in a compli¬
cated manner. The director showed him that in each
Instrument there was a heavy weight suspended on
strong springs; this weight, by its inertia, would set the
pen of the instrument moving whenever the slight tre¬
mors from a distant earthquake reached the observatory.
In one of the seismographs, the weight was suspended
in such a way that it could move vertically up and down;
in the other two, it could only move horizontally, in the
East-West direction in one instrument and in the North-
South direction in the other.
The visitor was examining the latter, when quite
suddenly the pen began to swing slowly from side to side,
leaving a wavy trace on the black surface of the record¬
ing paper, where before there had been only a series of
straight lines.
"That's a bit of luck," said the director, "It's working
specially for you. It Isn't often one sees an earthquake
actually being recorded."
The pens of all three instruments were now moving,
but the movement on the North-South instrument was
slightly greater than that on the East-West one.
"These are the compression waves, or P-waves for
short," said the director. "If you would like to wait a
few minutes, we shall perhaps see the arrival of the
S-waves the transverse, or shear, waves. Then we shall
have an idea of how far away this earthquake has
occurred."
A few minutes later, the director exclaimed "Here
they come!" The visitor could hardly see any difference
in the movement of the pens, but the director pointed
out to him that now the movement on the East-West
instrument was greater than that on the North-South
one.
"It's quite a long way off, probably to the north of us,"
said the director. "But it's a big one! Let's go up to
the office. I'll look up the travel-time tables and give you
a rough estimate of the distance. You see, the P-waves
travel faster than the S-waves, so that the time-lag in
the arrival of the latter gives an indication of how far
away the earthquake is. But I can only give you a rough
estimate, of course. To locate an earthquake accurately,
one has to combine the readings of a large number of
observatories."
It did not take the director long to work out the dis¬
tance: "About 10,000 kilometres, I should think. That
probably means Japan or the Aleutians."
In fact, It was Japan, for this tremor was recorded on
September 1, 1923, the date of the Great Kanto Earth-

quake which ravaged Tokio. It was not until later that
the director learned that five members of his visitor's
family had been killed in this earthquake.
It has been estimated that over 300,000 earthquakes
occur each year, but relatively few are strong enough to
be felt by the population in general. Nevertheless, since
the beginning of this century earthquakes have, on an
average, killed over 15,000 persons and caused hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of damage each year. Some
countries such as China and Japan, Chile and Peru, Italy,
Greece, Turkey and Iran, have suffered far more heavily
than others.
In fact, earthquakes tend to occur repeatedly in certain
well-defined zones stretching around the world. The
first of these Is the Circum-Pacific zone, which extends
all round the shores of the Pacific Ocean from Chile to
New Zealand. The second is the Mediterranean-Alpine
zone, which stretches from Morocco in the West, through
the Mediterranean and along the mountain chains of the
Caucasus, the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram and the
Himalaya into China, Burma and Indonesia.
In order to see how the geography of earthquakes has
been discovered, we must go back to the seismological
observatories and find out what happens to the data
recorded by the instruments there.
There are now over four hundred observatories
installed in different parts of the world, many with
instruments far exceeding in sensitivity those which the
visitor from Japan saw in 1923. But, however sensitive
the instruments employed, it is still impossible for one
single observatory to locate an earthquake. In order to
do this, the data from many observatories have to be
collected and analyzed together. This is done at two
national and two International centres.
When an earthquake occurs, observatories which
have recorded it send immediately, by telegram
or airmail, their readings of the P and S-wave arrival times
to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in Wash¬
ington, or to the Institute of Earth Sciences in Moscow,
or to both. These centres then make what is called a preli¬
minary determination of the earthquake epicentre (that
is to say, the point on the earth's surface vertically above
the focus of the earthquake, which may have occurred
tens or even hundreds of kilometres below the surface.)
With this preliminary determination to help them, the
staff at each observatory examine their records again
and make a more complete analysis of them for inclu¬
sion in the observatory bulletin which is usually published
once a month. This bulletin is sent to other observa¬
tories, in exchange for theirs, but It also goes to two
International centres: the Bureau Central International
de Séismologie in Strasbourg (France) ; and the office
of the "International Seismological Summary" in -Kew
(England).
The first of these centres makes an accurate determi¬
nation of the earthquake epicentre and depth, using the
data from as many observatories as possible. Nowadays,
this Bureau's Annual Bulletin runs to over 2,000 pages
and may contain data on over 60,000 earthquakes
recorded each year (of course, only a few of these are
strong enough to be felt or to cause damage.) The
International Seismological- Summary makes a more
detailed analysis of certain selected earthquakes, and the
results of its work are used mainly in research on the
interior of the earth.
From the study of this immense volume of data, the
pattern of distribution of earthquakes over the earth has
now emerged quite clearly, and some insight has been
gained into their causes which are probably linked with
28 the slow convective movement of material in the earth's
mantle. From the practical point of view, even more
interesting results come from the study of the distri-

bution of earthquakes within certain limited regions,
such as Southern Europe, Central Asia or California.
When the selsmicity and the geology of a region are
studied together, there sometimes emerges a detailed
pattern of earthquake activity which is not only of scien¬
tific interest, because of the Üght it sheds on the mecha¬
nisms involved, but is also of great practical value,
because it permits a delimitation of the zones in which
earthquakes are liable to occur. Sometimes, a few kilo¬
metres or tens of kilometres will make an appreciable
difference to the maximum intensity of earthquakes that
can be expected.
This knowledge ls extremely useful, and it may even
in some cases determine the choice of site for a dam, a
power station, a factory, or a new town. More often,
however, . other factors have overriding importance and
building must go ahead in certain places regardless of
the earthquake danger. This is where the specialist in
earthquake engineering comes in.
The 1923 earthquake in Tokyo, with which we began
this article, is famous for the fact that a number of large
buildings, which by rights should surely have been des¬
troyed, actually withstood the shock and suffered very
little damage. They survived because they had in fact
been designed to do so, but this was the first time that
a public demonstration had been given so clearly that-

To a brilliant Chinese mathema¬
tician, astronomer and geogra¬
pher, named Chang Heng (A.D.
78 to A.D. 139) goes the credit
for producing the ancestor of
all seismographs. His "earth¬
quake weathercock" (left) was
fitted in an ornamented bronze
vessel. Inside (reconstruction,
top right) was a kind of pendu¬
lum connected to eight mobile
arms. At the end of each arm a
crank operated the jaws of a
dragon head. Earthquake shocks
vibrated the mechanism and caus¬
ed the dragon's jaws facing the
direction of the shock to open,
dropping a ball into the mouth
of one of eight toads placed
around the instrument. Other
seismographic instruments were
used in China in the 6th century
and in Persia in the 13th, but the
first modern seismograph, was
only set up in 1703 by the French
scientist, Jean de Hautefeuille.

China" by Prof. Joseph Needham, ' Cam¬
bridge University Press.
buildings, if properly designed and constructed, need not
necessarily collapse and kill their occupants during a
severe earthquake.
Since 1923, research in the design of earthquake-resis¬
tant construction has made further progress, particu¬
larly in Japan and the United States. The general prin¬
ciples behind successful design appear to be firstly, to
hold the building together as a single structural unit, and
secondly, to design it in such a way that its natural
frequency of vibration does not correspond to the fre¬
quencies of the earthquake waves. Different building
materials demand different techniques, but it is probably
now true to say, in general, that if people are killed in
earthquakes it ls not by the earthquakes themselves but
rather by inadequate building.
"Everybody talks about the weather," said Mark Twain,
"but nobody does anything about it." In one sense,
there is not much one can do about earthquakes: there
is certainly no means of stopping them. However, a lot
ls being done to make them less dangerous. Although we
are still very far from being able to forecast when
earthquakes will occur, the patient accumulation of
observations is making it possible to define more accura¬
tely the zones where the danger exists. Within these
zones, the risk to human life and property can be greatly
reduced by the proper application to the design and
construction of buildings of principles which are already
well established.
So long as people still die in earthquakes, research and
education in seismology and earthquake engineering must
continue with all speed. The network of seismological
observatories must be Improved, the accurate mapping of
earthquake danger zones must be extended to cover the
whole world, adequate design and construction of build¬
ings must be ensured and young scientists and engineers
must be trained to become specialists In these subjects.
Seismology ls, par excellence, an international science,
for earthquakes are no respecters of national boundaries.
The saving of human life ls everyone's concern. These
are two reasons why Unesco has become Involved In seis¬
mology. Its Job is not only to make easier the collabo¬
ration of scientists and engineers from different coun¬
tries, but also to speed the flow of knowledge and skills
from the great research centres to those people, In all
countries, who have the responsibility for putting this
knowledge to good effect.
dr. E. M. FOURMER d'albe is programme specialist in seismo¬
logy and geophysics for Unesco's Department of Natural Sciences.
He has carried out long-term missions for Unesco in Mexico and oq
in Pakistan, where he helped to set up a geophysical observatory
in the earthquake-prone region of Quetta.

### 300,000 earthquakes a year
EMERGENCY QUAKE SERVICE
Unesco plans to set up a 24-hour seven-day-a-week earthquake service at
its headquarters in Paris which will be able to call upon experienced seismo¬
logists and earthquake engineers to arrive on the site of major earthquakes as
quickly as feasible anywhere in the world and wherever possible at least within
72 hours of their occurence. Special arrangements are being made with the
leading seismological centres in the U.S.S.R., U.S.A. and other countries to
inform the Unesco Earthquake Service of all major quakes.
Is is important that seismologists and earthquake engineers arrive on the
spot as soon as possible after a big shock. At the request of the respective
Governments, Unesco sent experts to Iran, Libia and Yugoslavia very soon
after the recent earthquakes in those countries to make on-the-spot studies
and to advise local authorities on protection measures to be taken against
possible future earth tremors.

Years of disaster
During the first quarter of the 20th
century, half a million people were
killed by five major earthquakes San
Francisco (1906),' Messina (1908),
Arezzano (1915), Kansu (1920) and
Tokyo (1923). In the next twenty-five
years, records kept by the Interna¬
tional Bureau of Seismology at Stras¬
bourg showed that on an average
14,000 people were killed annually.
Peak years were 1927 (76,615 deaths),
1932 (78,202) and 1939 (61,082).
China is the country which has suffer¬
ed most from earthquakes. It expe¬
riences shocks of great intensity in
areas especially prone to landslides.
World-wide survey
The study of earthquakes a field
in which progress depends on interna¬
tional co-operation is a major feature
of Unesco's science programme today.
A broad picture of the present
status of seismology in different coun¬
tries has been obtained through a
series of Seismological Survey Mis¬
sions sent out between June 1961 and
May 1963 by Unesco in consultation
with the International Union of Geo¬
desy and Geophysics, and personally
led by the president of the Interna¬
tional Union, Professor V.V. Beloussov
or by Prof. J. P. Rothé, Secretary-
General of The International Seis¬
mological Association. The first of
the missions visited 15 countries
in South-East Asia, the second
toured seismic regions of Latin
America, the third went to countries
of the Mediterranean and Middle East
regions and the fourth made stud¬
ies in Africa. The aim of these
missions was to examine the state of
seismological and geophysical obser¬
vatory networks, the progress made
in locating and mapping seismic zones,
the application of special regulations
concerning earthquake-resistant de¬
sign for buildings and, finally, the
resources available for training specia¬
lists in seismology, seismo-geology
and earthquake engineering. Next
year Unesco will convene an intergov¬
ernmental meeting to study the gene¬
ral ' development of seismology and
earthquake engineering.
Volcanoes to watch
Following a series of eruptions by
Mount Agung on the island of Bali
early this year, when 1 ,460 people
were killed and 53,700 hectares of
paddy fields devastated, Unesco sent
a team of experts to the island. These
experts have recommended that a per¬
manent vulcanological observatory be
set up on Mount Agung and ultra¬
sensitive seismic recording instru
ments installed to keep watch over
this earthquake-prone area. Similar
observatories are needed to keep an
eye (and an ear) on the rest of Indo¬
nesia's 127 active volcanoes.
More seismologists
A map of the epicentres of the
main earthquakes shows that the most
severely-stricken regions are very
often in territories now in the throes
of economic development. Large
scale engineering works are being
undertaken, factories are being built
and cities. are expanding. All this
progress may be wiped out in a few
minutes if construction sites are badly
chosen or if proper measures of pro¬
tection are not taken in advance. Yet
these are the countries with the few¬
est specialists in seismic matters.
The United Nations Special Fund,
acting through Unesco, has offered
67 fellowships for study at the Inter¬
national Institute of Seismology and
Earthquake Engineering set up with
Unesco's help last year in Tokyo.
The right materials
Certain building materials lend
themselves better than others for
earthquake-resisting construction. It
has been shown that masonry walls
reinforced with concrete slabs, rein¬
forced concrete frames and steel
frames are most likely to resist earth¬
quakes. However more research is
needed into possible uses of local
materials (wood, bricks, mud walls,
etc.). Poor construction (excessively
heavy roofs, facades not anchored to
the foundations, weak timbers) is often
the real reason a building collapses.
Price of security
Contrary to popular belief, the
design and construction of earthquake-
resisting buildings (except very tall
ones) are easily met at relatively little
extra cost. But it is wiser to eliminate
parapets, cornices, balconies and
similar decorative elements which are
often responsible for casualties. To
make the tall buildings in business
sections of large cities earthquake
resistant does involve additional cost,
but this is relatively small in relation
of the total cost of construction, and
the protection and security obtained.
Measuring from space
Earth satellites in orbit, already
used to study the shape of the planet,
make it possible to measure great
distances with a hitherto unattain¬
able accuracy. Scientists now hope
that it will thus be possible to obtain
confirmation or invalidation of the
theory of continental drift (see page 7).

### Wanted: more quake-proof buildings
MORE QUAKE-PROOF BUILDINGS
i n 1906, more than half a century ago, a young
Japanese building engineer visited San Fran¬
cisco in the wake of the disastrous earthquake that had
wrought havoc in the city. He was deeply impressed by a
reinforced concrete structure he saw standing among a
charred stretch of ruined brick buildings. It was un¬
scathed either by the earthquake or by fire. Reinforced
concrete buildings were becoming popular In Europe and
the United States, but in Japan, only one building using
this modern technique had been completed in the pre¬
vious year.
Firmly convinced that this was the best antlseismic
construction, the Japanese engineer, Riki Sano, returned
home and devoted himself to developing the construction
of reinforced concrete buildings in Japan and the study
of earthquake-proof structures. Sano thus laid the foun¬
dations for the study of earthquake engineering in Japan.
Sano's work was continued and further developed by
his pupil, Tachu Naito. An interesting tale explains how
Naito came to develop his own theory of earthquake-proof
construction. While visiting the United States to study
reinforced concrete buildings, he one day had his suitcase
smashed when it was thrown rather violently from a
train to a station platform. Naito bought a new suitcase
with partitions in it. When he saw that his new bag
withstood many severe shocks yet still retained its ori¬
ginal shape, he hit upon the Idea of designing a building
as "a box partitioned with several floor slabs and wall
slabs." On the basis of this idea, Naito developed a
theory of earthquake-proof construction and designed a
number of buildings applying this technique.
It was after these buildings were completed that the
Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 struck the Tokyo area.
Some 250,000 houses were destroyed, about 450,000 houses
burned down and approximately 140,000 lives were lost.
While the violent earthquake felled or severely damaged
most of the multi-story buildings In the city all of Nalto's
constructions survived the tremor undamaged, thus pro¬
ving the validity of his theory. Together with Nalto's
buildings, the Imperial Hotel, a lower, three-story struc¬
ture, designed by the famous American architect Frank
Lloyd Wright withstood the harsh trial of nature, and
won world wide attention.
This disastrous earthquake greatly stimulated Japanese
construction engineers in the study of earthquake-proof
structures. They were given more opportunity to experi¬
ment and improve their theories and antlseismic engi¬
neering techniques when a number of big tremors hit
other parts of Japan following the Kanto Earthquake.
These studies bore fruits in the form of steel reinforced
concrete construction (a structure with a steel frame in
the core and reinforced concrete enveloping it) which ls
almost without exception applied to the construction of
buildings higher than five stories in Japan today.
Thus Japan's earthquake-proof constructions have
developed from the costly lessons of natural disasters and
the theories arising from these experiences. How¬
ever, other new theories of earthquake-proof cons¬
truction were being developed using an entirely different
process. For this, we must turn to the United States.
In California, the major earthquake zone of the United
States, seismological observations grew in scale beginning
around 1925. The Long Beach (California) earthquake of
1933 which claimed 140 lives provided a major stimulus
to the research of earthquake-proof structures. One of the
positive outcomes of the studies stimulated by the earth¬
quake was the development of a strong-motion seismo-

graph designed to record the tremors of big earthquakes.
Work on this strong-motion seismograph observation is
still being continued today. Records taken in this way
have greatly contributed to the advancement of earth¬
quake-proof engineering research.
Actually, it had been Impossible until recently to com¬
pute the behaviour of a building being shaken by the
irregular vibration of the earth caused by an earthquake.
Earthquake engineers were compelled to calculate by
shifting the irregular earthquake waves into regular ones
but the results obtained by this process were unreliable.
However, in 1950, G.W. Housner of the California Techno¬
logical Institute succeeded in determining how a building
reacts to earthquake waves, by feeding actual records of
a major earthquake and the theoretical model of a build¬
ing into an analog computer which was developed during
the last war. This epochal development marked a major
breakthrough in earthquake-proof engineering research
and opened up a new field.
Recovering from the damages of war, Japanese scientists
designed and constructed strong-motion seismographs on
their own, and installed 120 of them in various parts of
Japan by 1960. Electronic computors too came into gra¬
dual use, and the antlseismic designing of buildings,
hitherto developed in Japan on the basis of experience,
is now being tested in the light of this new technique born
of a modern scientific calculating machine. Ironically,
however, since the strong-motion seismographs have been
installed in Japan, the country has not been hit by a
major earthquake although many disastrous ones have
occurred in other countries.
These new developments in earthquake-proof engineer¬
ing have taken place not only in the United States and
Japan but also in other earthquake-prone countries,
especially in the Soviet Union. As an outcome of advanced
earthquake engineering, a trend toward relaxing the
height limit imposed on buildings is being observed today
in most countries that are liable to earth tremors.
One building which has provided an invaluable stimulus
in the development of earthquake-proof engineering is the
40-story Latino Americana building in Mexico City which
was unharmed in the earthquake of 1957.
A great problem facing earthquake engineers today ls
that while multi-story buildings are being made more and
more earthquake-proof, residential houses have remained
as vulnerable to earthquakes as they were years ago. Still
fresh in our minds is the violent tremor west of Teheran,
Iran, which destroyed 3,000 houses and took 13,000 lives
in September 1962, and the even more recent disaster at
Skoplje in Yugoslavia where 85% of the buildings were
destroyed by a severe shock on July 26 this year.
Generally speaking, residential houses in these earth¬
quake countries have no resistance whatsoever against the
earthquakes because they are usually made of brick or
adobe (sun burned clay). If a violent earthquake hits a
heavily populated city in Southeast Asia where the houses
are made of wood, a disaster similar to the 1923 Kanto
Earthquake may be repeated.
Studies of ways to make wooden and brick buildings
earthquake-proof have advanced- most In Japan because
of her repeated history of earthquake-fire calamities.
Research on the development of earthquake-proof, fire¬
proof and inexpensive constructions has progressed ra¬
pidly since the end of the last war. Most impressive is
the big quake-generating machine used in the Building
Research Institute of the Japanese Government to test the
seismic resistance of buildings of two to three-story con¬
crete-block structures or prefabricated reinforced con¬
crete buildings.
No less useful is a large quake-generating table recently
developed at the same institute for antlseismic tests. This
table is unique in that it can give both horizontal and
vertical vibrations simultaneously. Similar vibration-
generators have been set up by other research organiza¬
tions in Japan, the United States, Italy, India and other
countries recently and are used to test the seismic resis¬
tance of arch dams and other structures as well as
buildings.
There are moves in many countries to make residential
houses as well as high buildings earthquake-proof. But
mainly for economic reasons many of the lands where
earthquakes occur most frequently have made little pro¬
gress in this direction. In addition, these countries have
very few seismologists and earthquake engineers and basic
observation of earthquakes has yet to be done.
In an attempt to remedy this situation, Unesco has estab¬
lished the International Institute of Seismology and
Earthquake Engineering in Tokyo, expanding a pro¬
gramme started by the Japanese Government a few years
ago. With the assistance of the United Nations Special
Fund, a project has been to invite trainees from earth¬
quake-prone countries to conduct joint research with
specialists from all over the world.
It is hoped that this international project will hasten
the day when people of all countries threatened by earth¬
quakes are protected against these natural calamities.

Letters to the Editor
HEBREW TRANSLATIONS
Sir,
In The Unesco Courier (Feb. 1963)
you published a very interesting article
by Robert Collison: "The Continuing
Barrier: Translations and East-West
Communications." I think that the
analysis of the Index Translationum
from the point of view of East-West
cultural communications is most
valuable, and its results deserve close
attention by Unesco as well as the
countries concerned.
However, I was somewhat surprised
that Israel and the Hebrew language
are not included in this article, in
spite of the fact that our country
is classified by Unesco as Asian. We
contribute regularly to the Index
Translationum and a breakdown of
the items we delivered to volumes
13 and 14 can be seen in the
table below.
You will note that the number
of translations into Hebrew is
considerable in comparison with the
numbers you give in Table 1 of the
above article. Of course, these
translations are destined primarily
for readers in Israel. The biblio¬
graphical journal, Kirjath Sepher,
published by the Jewish National and
University Library pays special
attention to all the translations into
Hebrew.
It would be interesting for your
readers to know that since the
beginning of 1962 there exists an
institute for the translation of Hebrew
literature into other languages, for
the special purpose Mr. Collison
mentions in his article, i.e. to
acquaint other countries and peoples
with Hebrew literature in various
subjects.

SELECTED SCIENCE FICTION
Sir,
I very much enjoyed and strongly
support the views of Arthur C. Clarke
as expressed in his article "In Defense
of Science Fiction" (November 1962).
I feel however that he, and you,
missed an opportunity to promote
much greater acceptance of these
views when he wrote "Many... point
out that 90% of science fiction is
rubbish..." and failed to give us a
much wider reading list from the
healthy 10%.
Could we have a few more titles
please?
Harry Wilkinson,
Cooksville, Ont Canada
Ed. note : Arthur Clarke writes :
"My statement that 90% of science
fiction is rubbish, is intended as a
compliment to science fiction, because
probably 95% of general fiction is
rubbish I
For me to draw up a reading list
is liable to get me in hot water with
my fellow practitioners. I would,
therefore recommend anyone interested
in the field to first get hold of King-
sley Amis' book of criticism, "New
Maps of Hell." This gives a very
amusing survey of the field and lists
most of the worthwhile recent books.
Four outstanding volumes which
should be fairly easily obtainable are
"A Canticle for Leibowitz" by W.
Miller "A Century of Science Fiction"
edited by D. Knight, "A Case of
Conscience" by J. Blish, and "The
Space Merchants" by F. Pohl and C.
Kornbluth. I would abo recommend
any anthologies edited by G. Conklin,
F. Pohl, D. Knight, A. Boucher, and
J. Merrill.
I would stress again that this list
excludes much of the best work of the
current writers. However, some of
this is so advanced that to recommend
it would be like offering James
Joyce to a beginner in English.
Afz/c/i good work appears in the
leading science fiction magazines,
viz. "The Magazine of Fantasy"
and "Science Fiction," "Galaxy,"
"Analog" (U.S.) and "New Worlds"
(U.K.). Several of these have foreign
language editions which publish
stories by local writers. The French
fiction is a notable example.
HELPING SKOPLJE RISE AGAIN
Sir,
The terrible earthquake which
recently struck the "capital of Mace¬
donia is not only a great ordeal for
the Yugoslav people; it is a tragedy
which has aroused the sympathy of
the entire world. Assistance has been
sent from all parts and there is no
doubt that the city will rise again.
It has been announced that the
Yugoslav Government has decided to
rebuild Skoplje on a new site. It
seems to me that all the Member
States of the United Nations should
share in planning this new city and
that each one should undertake to
construct one of its streets. A city
built in this way would be a magnifi¬
cent monument, commemorating the
victory of life over death and the soli¬
darity of mankind.
Would you please bring this sug¬
gestion to the attention of those res¬
ponsible for seeing that Skoplje rises
again from out of its ruins.

USE NATURE'S WEAPONS
Sir,
In the highly developed countries,
contagious diseases have been replaced
by "diseases of civilization" due to
the denaturalized foodstuffs which peo¬
ple eat today. Why cannot wc make
greater use of biological methods in
the battle against parasites instead of
chemical substances which not only
threaten human health, but also cause
great ravages among insectivores, espe¬
cially birds? In Switzerland, two doc¬
tors have set up a foundation with the
aim of substituting efficient natural
weapons for the chemicals now used
to excess in agriculture. The use of
the red ant in the fight against the
bistrychides (bugs which damage trees)
is one example of this use of natural
weapons.

however, is meeting a serious obstacle in
teacher shortages and 63 countries admitted
having to hire insufficiently qualified
teachers.
KARIBA FISHING FLEETS: The
building of the Kariba Dam to con¬
tain the waters of the Zambezi River on
the borders of Northern and Southern
Rhodesia has created the world's largest
artificial lake, covering 3,500 square miles.
This vast inland sheet of water is destined
to become the centre of a fishing industry.
Its waters have been stocked with new
fish, four ports are to be built as well as
a fish processing factory, and eventually
the annual fish harvest is expected to reach
14,000 tons.
rT<HIRSTY INDUSTRIES: Out of every
100 gallons of water used in Western
Europe only a few are used for drinking
purposes. Factories in Belgium and Lor¬
raine have reached a point where they use
the same water five or six times over.
Problems raised by this "industrial" water
shortage will be studied during the Inter¬
national Hydrological Decade which
Unesco is now preparing. Data collected
will help countries to make the best use
of their hydraulic resources.
COPYRIGHT IN AFRICA: A meeting
to discuss copyright problems in
Africa was held recently in Brazzaville
under Unesco sponsorship. Its aim was
to help African Member and Associate
Member States of Unesco to work out
the main lines of protective legislation
covering the works of writers, composers
and artists in their territories.
mTEW EYE ON THE SKY: To keep a
star or planet under continuous
observation, astronomers pass it from one
observatory to another around the world
like relay runners passing on a baton. One
of the gaps in the astronomer's chain is in
Siberia. To close this gap, the Astro¬
nomical Council of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences is to build a major multi-purpose
observatory in Novosibirsk with departments
of astrometry, astrophysics, stellar astro¬
nomy, solar physics, radio-astronomy and
planet astronomy.

RESCUING THE TEMPLES OF ABU SIMBEL
EFFORTS to rescue the Nubian Temples of Abu Simbel from being submerged
under the waters of the Aswan Dam have now reached a decisive stage.
The United Arab Republic has adopted a plan to cut up the temples and re-erect
them on the hill above their present site and the United States Government has
announced that it is ready to ask Congress to appropriate one-third of the cost
of this major engineering feat. If the U.S. offer is finally confirmed the saving
of Abu Simbel appears virtually assured.
The result of studies by a Swedish firm of consulting engineers, carried
out at the request of the U.A.R., the new plan will cost $36 million. The U.S.
contribution would be added to pledges by 43 Unesco Member States now
amounting to $7,700,000, and the U.A.R., which will contribute $11,500,000 to the
operation, has announced that it will sign contracts for the work as soon as the
international aid total reaches $20,500,000.
In dealing with 300,000 tons of fragile Nubian sandstone, engineers will use
every technical means to avoid damage to the temples. No explosives can be
used to remove the massive overburden of rock above the temples. Inside, a
steel scaffolding will take new stresses and strains caused when the rock is
removed. Facades, ceilings and walls will be cut into slabs whose shape will
be determined by natural cracks and weaknesses in the stone. It is not expected
that the gigantic jig-saw puzzle of fitting Abu Simbel together again on its new
hillside site will be completed before 1969.
AZTEC TOWN UNEARTHED: A team
of French archselogists has discovered
an Aztec town covering an area of nearly
four square miles in the state of San-Luis
Potosi, about 500 miles north of Mexico
City. Thirty-four pyramids dedicated to
Aztec divinities show that the town was
an important religious centre.
News Flashes. . .
l| The existence of an undersea "river"
running eastwards along the Equator and
flowing counter to the surface waters of
the tropical Atlantic has been confirmed
by an international fleet in a research pro¬
gramme organized by the Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission, a body
set up under Unesco's science programme.
More than one thousand million trees
have been planted in Norway in the past
18 years. As an investment for future
economic prosperity, Norway's Ministry of
Agriculture aims to step up planting by
at least 150 million trees annually during
the next decade.
¡H School enrolments in the United States
rose from over 30 million to over 46 million
during the period 1952-62, while college
and university enrolment increased from
2,302,000 to 4,600,000. During the same
period educational expenditure rose from
$11,300,000,000 to $27,500,000,000.
H The Russian Federation's Society for the
Protection of Nature now has 6,700,000
members in 50,000 local organizations.
Today 200,000 schoolchildren are members
of the "Green Patrols" which help to protect
trees and shrubs in towns and villages.
STAMPS SUPPORT CAMPAIGN
FOR NUBIA'S MONUMENTS
Many Unesco Member States have
issued or are proposing to issue
stamps in support of the international
campaign to save temples and monu¬
ments in Egypt and the Sudan which
are threatened by the construction of
the future Aswan Dam. Morocco has
recently issued three stamps which
show two of the colossi at Abu
Simbel, a temple at Philae and a
sculptured image of the goddess Isis
(above) from the temple at Kalabsha.
As agent in France of the U.N. Postal
Administration, Unesco's Philatelic Ser¬
vice stocks all U.N. stamps and
first-day covers currently on sale as
well as many stamps issued by Unesco
Member States to commemorate impor¬
tant events in the history of Unesco
and the U.N. For prices and details

HISTORY IN ROCK
Locked away in the rocky layers of the
earth 's crust are petrified vestiges of
once-living things dating from different
epochs of our planet's history. From
such animal and vegetal fossils scientists
have reconstructed major geological
events and climatic changes that extend
over millions of years, vistas and land¬
scapes that disappeared eons ago. The
delicately-veined leaf, slender branch and
life-like fish shown here were found near
Verona in northern Italy. They date back
some SO million years, long before the
dawn of mankind. In that age the climate
of much of the world was a tropical
one and northern Italy was covered
by a calm sea studded with coral atolls.
