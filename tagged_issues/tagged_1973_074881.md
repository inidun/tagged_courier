the museum was transferred to Paris ten years later. Today it boasts a world-renowned col¬

Burma and India), outstanding examples of graeco-buddhist art from Pakistan and Afghanistan,
works of artist-monks from Tibet and art treasures from China, Japan and Korea. Moderniza¬

THREE FACES OF ART TODAY
Cubism, dadaism, surrealism and other
forms of modern art "exploded" reality
and experimented with its component
parts. A similar, but of course in no
way identical, phenomenon may be
occurring today when artists (such as
Salvador Dali and others) take famous
masterpieces of the past and transform,
distort and "toy and tamper" with them.
Many people are naturally shocked by
this "sacrilege". The Polish artist Ro¬
man Cieslewicz, whose work is repro¬
duced on our cover, while adopting the
same "sacrilegious" approach, sees
"art attacked by modern techniques and
the creative machine", hence he shows
Mona Lisa shedding a tear of blood.
The tear in the eye of La Gioconda is
echoed in the drop of blood on the
rose thorn in our back-cover illustration.

his issue is devoted to three studies on
trends in concepts of art in the world today.
Examined separately are the arts in the Western
countries, the arts in the Socialist countries and
the arts in the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
The articles in this issue are based on a chapter
on the study of artistic and literary expression to be
published in a forthcoming Unesco book which
forms part of a monumental survey on the Main
Trends of Research in the Social and Human
Sciences undertaken by Unesco.
Initiated in 1963, this long-term inquiry of world¬
wide scope has been carried out by Unesco in two
successive stages. The first part was completed
in 1970 with the publication of an 800-page volume
entitled Main Trends of Research in the Social
and Human Sciences, Part I: Social Sciences
(Co-edition Unesco- Mouton, The Hague, 1970).
The volume for Part II, dealing with social anthro¬
pology, archaeology, history, artistic and literary
expression, the legal sciences, and philosophy, is
now in preparation and is scheduled for publication
(precise date to be announced) in English and
French editions.
Each of the chapters of Part II is the result of a
broad collective effort carried out on an internat¬
ional scale under the direction of an editor-author
aided by associate editors from different regions
of the world.
The eminent specialists thus responsible for the
various chapters are : for social and cultural anthro¬
pology. Prof. Maurice Freedman, Oxford; for
archaeology and prehistory. Prof. Sigfried J. De
Laet, Ghent; for history. Prof. Geoffrey Barra-
clough, Oxford ; for aesthetics and the sciences of
art. Prof. Mikel Dufrenne, Paris; for legal sciences.
Prof. Viktor Knapp, Prague; and for philosophy.
Prof. Paul Ricoeur, Paris. To each chapter is appen¬
ded an extensive international bibliography.
The texts presented in this issue have been
abridged and condensed from the study directed
by Mikel Dufrenne, professor of philosophy at the
University of Paris. They are concerned essentially
with the evolution of art in our time, with the
meaning that artistic and literary expression has
for modern man and the functions assigned to art
in present-day societies.
One conclusion that emerges from this brilliant
analysis is that the study of art, no matter how rig¬
orously "scientific" its methods, cannot be sepa¬
rated from the art of its time or from contemporary
life in the various communities and cultures at
a given moment in history.
Artistic creation, general (if not always conscious)
attitudes toward art, and the systematic study of
art itself (including of course the art of former
epochs and former civilizations, etc.) are con¬
stantly affecting one another. Perhaps one could
say that within each culture at a given stage of its
historical evolution, and in the light of every signi¬
ficant philosophy or ideology, the same basic
inspiration is at work at all three levels.
It is in this perspective that Professor Dufrenne
examines the changes that are taking place in
the world of art in "Western countries", as well
as their deep sources of inspiration. Bêla Köpeczi,
Secretary-General of the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences, discusses art in the Socialist countries,
its foundations, motivations and evolution within
the framework of the Socialist concept of a new
society. In the third article of this issue, Mikel

Three faces of art today
Dufrenne analyses the avant-garde and traditional
concepts of art and literature in Asia, Africa and
Latin America, on the basis of first-hand contri¬
butions received by Unesco. Professor Dufrenne
shows how a highly original approach to art and
creativity is developing in these countries, while
drawing upon the acquisitions of Western scientific
thinking.
Here it is worth noting that the topics presented
in this issue should of course be considered in the
light of the broader study of research trends to
which this picture of artistic evolution is an intro¬
duction. Mikel Dufrenne and his team clearly show
in their full report that the study of art and litera¬
ture, while acknowledging that it is deeply rooted
in the lives of individuals and communities, is
continually striving for more systematic and rigor¬
ous objectivity.
Based as it is nowadays on a wealth of data
pertaining to all the cultures of the globe, and
seeking to understand the artistic creations of all
cultures according to their own spirit and to
promote their diffusion, the study of art today
aims toward a universality that at the same time
recognizes and respects the diversities and richness
of all human expression.
In this sense, the inquiry into current trends of
research on artistic and literary expressions pro¬
vides a particularly meaningful introduction to the
evolution and problems of the human sciences
generally which Unesco has sought to present in
the Second Part of this vast research project.

A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE in the very concept of art spans these two pictures. Below left,
"The Banker and his Wife" by the 16th century Flemish artist Quentin Massys (or Matsys).
With its precise details and true-to-life portraiture, this graceful composition is a marriage of
colour and poetry. Above, a framed blank canvas hung in a recent exhibition. Visitors were
invited to draw whatever they wanted on the canvas, the idea being that the blank space is
an inducement to dream, phantasy and invention. If art is not dead, it has changed its face.

ART IN THE WEST
A continuous, search for new frontiers
by Mikel Dufrenne
MIKEL DUFRENNE, professor of philosophy
at the University of Paris (Nanterre), is known
for his writing and research in aesthetics and
linguistics. Among his works published in
English translation are "Language and Philo¬
sophy" (Indiana University Press, 1963) and
"The Notion of the a Priori" (Northwestern
University Press, 1966). His 2-volume "Phé¬
noménologie de l'Expérience Esthétique"
(Presses Universitaires de France, 1967) will
shortly be published in English by North¬
western University Press.
NE hundred and fifty years
ago Hegel announced that art was
dying. And perhaps art is in fact
dead. Perhaps that which we call art
today is another art, designed for other
purposes and endowed with another
meaning.
Traditional art was neither self-
conscious nor institutionalized. It was
entangled with scholarship, religion
and social life. It offered the imme¬
diate expression immediately ac¬
cepted and understood of a culture
which was experienced as a whole by
the totality of the people. Given over
to divine worship, it celebrated the
sacred element which pervaded the
whole life of the community, uniting
it and making it meaningful.
This embodiment of art an art
which did not regard itself as such,
which is only recognized by us now
finds expression chiefly in archaic
societies. It gradually lost its charac¬
teristic features when culture divided
itself into various institutions and

WESTERN ART (Continued)
Technology invades the arts

society broke up into classes, violently
opposed in various degrees.
It won its autonomy when the total¬
ity of which it was unwittingly the
soul disintegrated. Then were the
words "art" and "artist" invented, and
art became reflected through the
artist and affirmed itself as art, refus¬
ing to serve any cause except its
own. It is easy to see what art lost
when it won its autonomy.
In the first place art ceased to be
sacred: "it lost its mythical and ritual
force", as the Italian writer Gillo
Dorfles expresses it in his study on
this subject. There are no more
summits or ecstatic moments to which
it might give access. Our heroes
champions or stars no longer in
the main belong to the world of art.
Our myths are caricatures of real
myths, placed at the service of adver¬
tising or propaganda. When the viewer
or the listener becomes a consumer,
when broadcast music becomes the
background for prosaic activities, when
the open space before a church
becomes a parking area, listening and
viewing are deprived of any ritual
character.
Next, art became depersonalized:
it too seems to be prey to the curse of
alienation brought upon man by
technological civilization. When a
work passed through the hands of a
single artisan, that artisan felt that he
was an instrument of the culture that
inspired him. Art was truly "popular".
By participating in the festivity or the
particular event, both the individual
and the creative artist had an oppor¬
tunity of self-expression.
Today the very meaning of the
term "popular art" has been debased:
it no longer designates art of the
people for the people, but one or the
other either art of the people, that is,
"a certain type of spontaneous handi¬
craft", as opposed to genuine art, that
of artists, or else art for the people,
more frequently called art for the
masses and to some extent tied up
with the mass media.
For the very concept of the people
has given way to that .of the mass.
Three forms of culture are readily
distinguishable " high-brow, middle¬
brow and low-brow" and mass
culture is referred to as "mid-cult".
With this middle culture, just as
people are reduced to mass, art is
reduced to pastime. The "art con¬
sumer" is alienated thereby, but the
creative artist, who was still able to
assert his individuality in collective" art
movements, may very well be obliterat¬
ed by impersonal forms of art such as
those produced by the mass media.
In the eyes of a public accustomed
to mass-produced films and television
serials, the identity of the author has
lost practically all significance. While
we know a book by its author, we
know a film or a stage performance
by the most outstanding name, the
easiest to identify. It may be that of
an actor; more often than not it is
merely that of the leading rôle; some¬
times it is that of the organizer or
compère of the programme. In this
way the individuality of the created
work is called in question, as is its
uniqueness.
HlOWEVER, this picture of
the death of art is too gloomy. Let us
not succumb too readily to nostalgia
for the past, unless it gives rise to a
new art, which would not be just a
revival of the old.
"I think "l can say", writes Gillo
Dorfles, "that the loss of the mythical,
ritual and poetic character of art was
a necessary stage, enabling art to
acquire a new technological dimension
specific to our own civilization. But
I also think that in the next stage man
will be in a position to draw on mythi¬
cal and poetic elements for new artis¬
tic purposes... and that creative art
will no longer be deprived of the irra¬
tional fantastic."
Even now a "genuine popular art"
might be able to tap new sources of
meaning and poetry. Not the "degen¬
erate art of the mid-cult", but graphic
art and industrial design: arts which
are perhaps both by the people and
for the people, if it is true that there
is in them "a common ground where
actual participation of the masses is
united with a kind of spontaneous
germination of the products of these
arts". Pop art seems to have realized
this inasmuch as it recognizes the
provoking and yet de-mystifying effects
of the products of the consumer
society which it has taken over.
By breaking its connexions with reli¬
gious, ethical or social values, art has
gained the power to express a deeper,
more fundamental relation, which one
might venture to call pre-cultural or
pre-historical, of man with the world.
In this sensé art today has a function
and force which make it irreplaceable.
Let us look a little more closely,
however, at the position accorded to
art by a technological civilization.
Paradoxically, the most striking phe¬
nomenon, which we shall therefore
mention first, is related not to creative
activity but to the distribution of works
of art although it is true that the
means of reproduction, through a form
of feed-back, end by affecting pro¬
duction itself.
We are familiar with the new means
of presentation, reproduction and dis¬
tribution made available to art by
modern technology: the extension of
transport facilities both for the public
and for the works of art sometimes
entire travelling exhibitions the devel¬
opment of art books, photography,
diapositives and the film, in turn re¬
produced ad infinitum by popular
newspapers and television.
These means, obviously bound up
with the commercialization of art, make
the works available to a vast public.
By these means art is spread all over
the world and this fact cannot be over¬
emphasized. What we are concerned
with here, however,. is the consequen¬
ces of this world-wide diffusion of art.
Firstly, some of these means of dis¬
tribution those which are properly

Bathrooms
and

Modern artists In search of
new forms of expression
often reject traditional ma¬
terials and techniques. The
Dancers, below left, are by
George Segal, an American
artist who gave up paint¬
ing for the sculpture of
plaster figures cast in sec¬
tions on living models and
then assembled and re¬
worked. During the past
15 years he has been
seeking to capture ges¬
tures and attitudes seen in
commonplace surroundings
(buses, elevators, laundro¬
mats, restaurants or bath¬
rooms). In Segal's "real-
life" situations the assem¬
bled "environments" are
authentic and each of his
ghostly-white human fig¬
ures, enigmatic and anony¬
mous, are nevertheless in¬
dividually distinctive works.
Right, "Eggs of Neo-fos-
sils" by Rodolfo Krasno,
of Argentina, who designs
his "sculpture-objects" for
display with music and

called the mass media themselves
give rise to new arts. Even if we have
difficulty in believing with McLuhan
that the medium is the message, it is
an incontrovertible fact that new me¬
dia give rise to new messages, those
put out by the "information arts". The
television film, for instance, becomes
a particular genre within the art of film.
Similarly, "... one believes that re¬
cording methods serve above all to
conserve, to imprint, to perpetuate
high fidelity", writes Pierre Schaeffer.
"The real importance of electro-acous¬
tics is that it permits one to make
sounds or again to fix natural sounds,
to repeat them, to perpetuate and to
transform them".
Secondly, as a result of technolo¬
gical resources, the public has adopted
a new approach to the arts, or, one
may say, the works have acquired a
new presence, considerably magnified.
It Is a twofold phenomenon: either we
move ourselves, thanks to ever-
increasing travel facilities, or the works
are brought to us, either directly as
live music over the air, or as art works
in exhibitions travelling across conti¬
nents, or by means of reproductions.
It has often been said of repro¬
ductions that they are untrue to the
originals. Malraux showed however,
that they also reveal unnoticed aspects
for example, details or new angles
to the extent that they constitute new
aesthetic objects.
"Reproduction", writes the Swiss
museologist René Berger, "is no
longer simply.... a phenomenon of
repetition, as the belief would have it,
which draws its tenets from etymology
or habit; it corresponds to a group of
numerous and complex operations
which make it a production...
"Thus, to take a single example, is
born the 'multiple' of which the impor¬
tance is, not only that it does not refer
to an original but also that it abolishes
the very idea that such an original can
exist, each example including, in its
singularity, a reference to the other
examples, uniqueness and multiplicity
ceasing to oppose each other."
HE new approach imposed
by the multiplication of information,
means that the public itself is multiply¬
ing fast, and can no longer exercise its
sovereign judgement based on immu¬
table criteria such as those tradi¬
tionally taught. Even judgement be¬
comes experimental and it can only be
based on studies which are also mul¬
tiple.
Another implication of the massive
dissemination of art may be expressed
by the question: when art is distri¬
buted all over the world does it
become international? Must one con¬
clude that art can only be handled and
exported when it has ceased to be
rooted in a local culture and a tradi¬
tion? Art is international in the same
way as science, but while it is concei¬
vable that there are no such things
as Kansas mathematics or Soviet
biology, can we so readily accept that
Polynesian fetishes or Spanish baro¬
que no longer exist? Do we not know
that poetry is in fact untranslatable?
In this sense certain nationalistic
reactions are legitimate and seem to
serve the cause of art, provided of
course that the particular they exalt is
capable of being raised to the univer¬
sal. As Marx has already said, the
miracle of Greek statues is that they
speak a language we still understand.
International art is an art which has
internationalized itself, but one would
have to distinguish between two modes
of internationalization. One is the
expansion of technical processes and
economic constraints: for example,
multi-storey buildings have spread like
a disease all over the world, but so
also has a certain art of information.
The other may arise through the pres¬
tige of a certain style, which is then
truly a style. Now this style origi¬
nated somewhere and it has not

CONTACT, MOVEMENT & LIGHT
How to incorporate the movement of life into works
of art is a challenge that 20th century kinetic art has
tried to meet in different ways: by mechanical, optical
and scientific techniques, direct use of moving light
and even electronic devices (see also pages 18-19).
Below, Soto's "Penetrable", so named because the
spectator can physically penetrate the work. It is
now located on the terrace at the Museum of Modern
Art in Paris. According to Soto (born in Venezuela
in 1923) "art is the material representation of the
immaterial" (la connaissance sensible de l'immatériel).
"We artists", he says, "are astounding the world of
science by our discoveries". With his "Penetrable"
he rejects the old idea that viewer and work of art
must stand apart. Constructed of wood, metal and

disowned its origins. Nevertheless it
has also been capable of receiving and
assimilating the messages of other
cultures, as for example in Picasso's
Negro masks and Olivier Messiaen's
Hindu rhythmic patterns.
This world-wide spread of art also
implies the universalization of taste.
Works of art do not lose their meaning
or their power to inspire other works
when they go abroad, any more than
the ancient works did when they left
their own times. The gradual evolu¬
tion or metamorphosis of meaning
does not entail loss of meaning: a
Negro mask has a new magic when it
becomes an aesthetic object in an
ethnological museum, in the same way
as a Greek or Khmer temple deprived
of its original setting and ceremonial,
reduced to an illustration in an art
book.
Art when exported or reproduced is
not completely uprooted; through it
the public, and artists in the first place,
establish roots in remote worlds. This
does not mean that we become
Negroes at the sight of Negro art, any
more than the proletariat becomes
bourgeois by contact with an art which
was previously the prerogative and
expression of the dominant class.
Discovering a new world does not
mean inhabiting it but widening one's
horizon and perhaps, for the artist, a
prospect of new adventures.
Let us see what this vaster if not
unanimous world has to offer today
in terms of artistic production. First,
new means. We are well aware that
the gradual evolution of the arts is
governed as much by changes in tech¬
niques as by the mysterious mutations
in Weltanschauung or "world view".
This change is multiplied and hastened
by industrial civilization. Its impact
on art is such that a certain form of
music can be called electronic, while
architecture, painting and the film
bring to mind innumerable examples.
Two consequences of this develop¬
ment of techniques should, however,
be noted. The first is that the relation
of art to technique is not unilateral:
technology does not offer art now,
more economic or more effective
means. It creates new ends or, if one
prefers, new styles.
For example, the standardization and
pre-fabrication of architectural ele¬
ments may suggest a new conception
of homes, or groups of buildings.
Similarly the technique of animated
cartoons may suggest a new concep¬
tion of the art of photography.
Then again the technical object may
have recourse to aesthetics. This
brings in the whole problem of design,
of the henceforth deliberate and no
longer spontaneous cultivation of the
aesthetic element in everyday objects;
at the same time we witness the mean¬
ing taken on by poetry when it be¬
comes part of the world's prose.
In the second place, this is also a

rope, the "Penetrable" displays Its amazingly rich
variations as soon as one enters it, as the child here
on his bicycle.
Left, "Two Figures VIII", kinetic painting by Frank
J. Malina, the noted American artist-scientist. His
works suggest the revolution of heavenly bodies or
artificial satellites in outer space. Malina uses electric
light and in certain cases moving discs to animate
his compositions.
Right, a different approach to movement in art,
"Square Tops" by Weng-Ying Tsai (born in China in
1928). Trained in traditional Chinese art and later as
an engineer, he took up kinetic art in 1963. The metal
stems composing this work undulate to the sound of
the human voice and seem to be "listening" to the
spectator. Electronic devices make them sensitive
to light and noise, inciting them to move.
problem for the artist: What concep¬
tion is he going to have of his activity,
or of his vocation, when he associates
with an engineer or himself becomes
a technician? What kind of initiative
can he take, or what control can he
claim over his work, or his part of the
work, when he has recourse to a
computer?
Does he want to be ousted like a
musical performer condemned to
unemployment because of concrete
music? Certainly not; but it is not
easy to analyse the ruses invented by
the conscious mind (or indeed by the
unconscious) when creation is left to
mechanical devices or when it relies
on chance, where once it invoked ins¬
piration. Perhaps in this familiarity
with the technical device, a new men¬
tality is developing which makes the
artist akin to the engineer as much as
to the odd-job man.
It may also happen, however, that
the artist reacts with some violence
to the invasion of our lives by techno¬
logy, that he turns technology against
itself by parodying it, or that he pro¬
motes an aesthetic of the waste pro¬
duct with the dustbins of our civili¬
zation. Everything depends on the
way in which he regards this civiliza¬
tion at least in Western societies.
At all events we must admit that our
civilization offers art not only new
media but also new fields opened
up by these same media, moreover,
and assured of a new audience.
An allusion has already been made
to the demand of industry, which is
considerable today, and in which Dor¬
fles sees the promise of a new pop¬
ular art. One might also refer to the
advertising arts brought into being by
a competitive economy, or the propa¬
ganda arts exercised under authori¬
tarian regimes.
Is it enough to say that advertising
or propaganda have made use of pre¬
existing arts without converting them?
By no means: this is no more the case
than it was for architecture to go on
decorating skysprapers with Corinthian
pillars or Gothic gargoyles. On the
contrary, new art forms or new styles
were invented which in turn influenced
the traditional forms.
There is also scope for art in the
environment itself, and the public took
up this idea before town-planning was
even thought of. In fact the dream
of metamorphosing our surroundings,
at least our urban surroundings, into
a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk or perma¬
nent-opera is not new, but it is perhaps
today that the means appear to be
within our reach, even if this is not
clearly realized.
What constraints are imposed on
the artist by reason of these new
powers? He claimed his indepen¬
dence at the same time as the speci¬
ficity of art. What economic and so¬
cial status does he possess in a capi¬
talist society?

WESTERN ART (Continued)
Conformity and artistic freedom
Let us first consider the economic
status of art. Despite official commis¬
sions or subsidies, art is essentially
a private business, subject to the laws
of competition. Its commercialization
involves the works themselves, their
sale, their execution, their perfor¬
mance, or their distribution.
Masterpieces consecrated by time
are sound investments which give lus¬
tre to museums, the new sites of
pilgrimage. Even with the more re¬
cent works, however, the market re¬
mains steady once an artist has
acquired a certain reputation among
the connoisseurs. When a new name
or a new school comes up, it does
not banish the others, except perhaps
after many years. Speculation is
confined in practice to unknown artists
or outsiders, of whom the vast maj¬
ority never manage to make a name
for themselves, or a living except by
expedients.
As for the film industry, while it pro¬
vides a living for large numbers of
workers, it only enriches a few stars
and of necessity there are not very
many well-known film directors. Nor
should it be forgotten that there are
probably just as many amateur cam¬
eramen as there are amateur painters
or unpublished novelists.
II T is not, however, this
anonymous multitude which assures
art's economic vitality; it is rather the
prestige of those who are talked about
and who have their followers clients
who are not only collectors, for even in
wealthy countries where a degree of
luxury is within everybody's reach,
this clientele is restricted. Neverthe¬
less, just as there exists a mass of
unknown producers, there is in all de¬
veloped societies an anonymous mass
of consumers all those who attend
museums, read art books, go to the
theatre or the cinema and listen to
recordings.
Even if art does not penetrate the
world's prose to the point of metamor¬
phosing it as the prophets of anti-art or
non-art would have it, art infiltrates
the leisure activities of the masses.
Even if it is not a people's art, it has
been brought to the people, just as
it has spread all over the world.
The ever-increasing place which
art occupies in our daily lives has
attracted the attention of the State,
which is tempted to press it into the
service of ideologies or politics and
to keep a constant check on it.
Hence the question: to what extent
is the artist free or does he feel free
vis-à-vis the State? The standards
and checks officially imposed on him
are a measure of this freedom.. Cen
sorship exists everywhere, but it does
not have the same force and the same
functions everywhere. One may think
that the artist is less free in coun¬
tries where there is a State religion
or a State aesthetic, that he is freer in
countries where the State merely has
interests and does not have doctrines
or recommend a style.
Things are not so simple, however,
for we must be careful to distinguish
between being free, feeling free and
wanting to be free. An artist who
conforms to standards and accepts
supervision may feel free (without
therefore resembling Spinoza's wea¬
ther vane). The artist who identified
himself with his city and with his cul¬
ture did not even ask himself whether
he was free. Similarly, in some coun¬
tries, artists who are particularly sen¬
sitive to social problems see themsel¬
ves as defenders of the policy pursued
by the State, and even prophets of
the future which the State has in view,
to the point of censoring themselves.
On the other hand, in a country
where censorship is mild, an artist may
be affected by all manner of insidious
constraints imposed by the world
around him and feel alienated to the
point of despair or revolt.
If there is any criterion of an artist's
freedom at a time like our own, when
freedom is a subjective requirement, it
must be sought in the vitality and
quality of his art, and perhaps too
in its liberating power.
The inhumanity of our civilization is
due in the first place to the fact that
civilization, when it becomes universal,
crushes all the distinctive and mean¬
ingful landmarks which were familiar
ground. Instead of being lived natu¬
rally as a tradition, it ceases to be a
comfortable suit of clothes made to
measure and becomes a uniform,
mass-produced by the workings of im¬
personal laws, imposed on everyone.
Furthermore, this world turned up¬
side down by the technological revolu¬
tion and by social revolutions is full
of doubts and contradictions: it is a
torn world of which no one feels a citi¬
zen, for nationalism has not disarmed.
The system of production and con¬
sumption, which might tend to unify it,
actually accentuates the scandalous
inequality of development and the con¬
trast between wealth and poverty, bet¬
ween waste and famine.
Within each society also, the gap is
widening between those institutions
which are on the move and those which
are stagnating. Then again our world
is oppressive or hostile. It turns
against the individual. It is not sur¬
prising that certain philosophies assert
that man is dying: he is being enslav¬
ed by material or intellectual systems.
It is no longer merely the Church or the
State which thinks for him and forces
him to accept its reasons; it is reason
itself, in the hands of all those who
have the monopoly of discourse.
Can the artist be said at least to
feel sustained by a public with which
he has bonds and to which he is res¬
ponsible? In his approach to the world
does the artist experience loneliness
or does he feel given away to others,
to a public, or even to a people? Then
again, in his production, is he affected
by public demand or does he follow
only his own impulses or a certain
logic in the gradual unfolding of
a style?
The answer to these questions
should of course take into account not
only the artist's personality and the
rôle he assigns himself, but also his¬
torical situations, social regimes and
systems of art production.
\J all events, whether or
not they are supported by a public,
most artists, at least in the Western
countries, do not usually react to the
world around them without unease or
rebelliousness. Their works bear
testimony- to this. When creative art
is not an escape for them, as specu¬
lative thought or erudition are for
others, it is an opportunity for decrying
everything that mystifies, oppresses or
alienates the individual including
sometimes the very idea of creative art.
For artists have also lost their nai¬
vete: in the past they were able to
identify themselves with the city or the
prince who embodied it; at the dawn of
history they could be the artisans of an
immemorial culture and celebrate a
world in which everything had mean¬
ing. Today this is no longer possible:
what was formerly spontaneous con¬
sent would be complicity. They cannot
help but be accomplices, and know it,
when in order to live, and also to gain
a hearing, they must take their place
in the commercial circuit.
If they do this, can they at least
claim their freedom? Yes, but they may
be drawn back into the net. Every
society has its safety valves to pre¬
vent explosions. Bourgeois society has
its enfants terribles, monstres sacrés
or maudits, which do no one any harm.
Protest is emasculated once it be¬
comes a fashion, pending its inclusion
in histories of art.
Conversely, in countries which dis¬
trust it, it is taken more seriously when
it does occur. The aesthetic charac¬
ter of innovations, in particular, is more
attentively studied and appreciated.
In countries which find protest div¬
erting, the game may become danger- u *
rous for the ruling class at the stage 1 1
when art finds a wider audience, even
among those who are ruled. It may
then produce unforeseen effects and

WESTERN ART (Continued)
Shock treatment to 'free7 the public
instead of being a safety-valve become
a detonator.
Wherever he is free, the artist
reacts by impassioned research and
absorbed interest. The first explana¬
tion which comes to mind is of course
the great variety of means made av¬
ailable to him by industrial civilization
and also the demands it makes on
him. Research is then truly technical,
as it always has been. No trade can
be plied, even in eventless societies,
without thought being given to the
skills involved and without invention
being called into play.
B
12
'UT this frenzied research
is partly accounted for by commer¬
cialization and competition. In a madly
competitive market, setting sound in¬
vestments apart, only the latest fashion
sells wells the product which is most
blatantly advertized or shocks the
public. This is a sufficient explana¬
tion for those who are put off by nov¬
elty and who are apt to decry it as im¬
posture. It is not sufficient for those
who want to understand.
Actually this research is stimulated
by ceaseless thought that may go so
far as to negate art and, first of all,
the artist. Pondering on his status,
the artist today seems to be retracing
the path followed from Cennini to
Vasari, from the state of craftsman to
that of artist.
The artist contests his own status
even more radically when he contests
the very idea of art. Not that he ne¬
cessarily abandons the quest, as Rim¬
baud or Marcel Duchamp did; but he
assigns another object to it than the
beautiful, and he pursues it elsewhere.
No doubt any creation is a transgres¬
sion, any invention is a challenge to
tradition.
Today, however, the transgression
takes on violent forms: it exalts
anti-art, art in the making or
spontaneous art, and it is not easy to
discern the artist's motives and inten¬
tions. It certainly displays a degree of
aggressiveness, but against what?
First, against traditional values: putting
a moustache on the Mona Lisa, pervert¬
ing music by adding noise to it, paint¬
ing by affixing objects normally cast
away and choreography by introducing
everyday gestures, are all ways of re¬
jecting the seemly by declaring it con¬
ventional.
They are ways of profaning beauty
because it is oppressive once defini¬
tions or models of it are imposed, be¬
cause it goes hand in hand with other
values now suspect as a result of their
manner of establishment or their ante¬
cedents (even the defining of beauty
was once the privilege of a social
class), perhaps also because this offi¬
cially-accepted beauty has masked or
excluded other forms of beauty.
Aggressiveness is then turned
against the object, not just against the
aesthetic product, as when some pain¬
ters slash their canvases, but against
the prosaic objects depicted in dis¬
torted form and devoid of practical
significance in surrealist works. It may
also be turned against the beholder,
who may be given a bottle-rack to con¬
template or a problematical assem¬
blage of morphemes to read. Is this
not mocking his lack of sophistica¬
tion?
Refusal of values and of the works
in which they are invested, refusal of
the world we know, controlled and po¬
liced, refusal of a public which can be
domesticated at pleasure: we have the
impression that the artist wants to play
and appeals to us to play with him.
This has often been said and there
are countless studies on art and play.
Today, "happenings", Cesar's com¬
pressions of automobile parts, Tin-
guely's machines, Cage's music, and
kinetic works, invite us to take part in
a game. We know that the game can
be serious because of the motivations
it stirs up, the commitment it presup¬
poses and the effects it produces.
Such is art: when it claims to be play
it most urgently needs to be taken
seriously.
We believe that contemporary art,
is a liberation movement, sparked off
in the first place by the repressive and
inhuman character of our civilization
and later by the weight of all that
artifice has added to nature.
HERE are three aspects to
this liberation movement.
First, the world must be liberated by
being peopled with new, startling ob¬
jects which are not a comforting re¬
hash of the already-known. Lifting an
everyday object from its normal sett¬
ing ¡s making of it not so much an aes¬
thetic object as an unwonted object.
It is also a way of taking us out of our
usual setting, of surprising us into lett¬
ing go of the object, inviting us to do
justice to it at last perhaps because
previously undiscovered beauty has
been brought to light. Why not?
Could not even our civilization be
rehabilitated in this way? By con¬
structing a caricature of a machine,
Tinguely gives the machine over to
nature, and perhaps to poetry. In the
works where Rauschenberg accumula¬
tes the obsessive symbols of the Am¬
erican way of life is there not tender¬
ness as well as irony? At all events it
is in this manner that poetry sets words
free, by lifting them out of prosaic
syntagmas, and that Cage's music sets
sound free.
But are we not then invited to take
part in a game of fools? Are we not
abandoning solid ground for the de¬
lights of the imagination? While we
think we are changing the world, have
we not merely changed our outlook
on it?
Before answering this question we
must admit that contemporary art, in¬
stead of merely taking its audience to
witness, provokes it and makes it take
sides more imperiously than ever. It
wants to free its audience as well as
the art object, even if this demands
shock treatment. How? In the first
place, by enabling it to discover new
horizons, freeing it from the bonds of
tradition and prejudice, inveighing
against the values which enslave it.
If the traditionalists accuse art of
mystifying the public, it is precisely
because it is endeavouring to demys¬
tify it to the point of "deculturing"
it, if we can use the word. Today's
works do not claim supremacy or
deference. They treat the beholder
as a friend. What they ask of him is
that he should associate himself with
the creation as an actor, as does a
performer, as does the rambler who
experiences the architecture of a town,
as does an audience when it joins in
the singing of a chorus.
If such works sometimes appear
precarious or roughly-assembled, it is
in order that the partner can finish
them. Execute, finish these words
have a double meaning: this
is the risk run by contemporary
art, the risk of dying in order to
become something else and also in or¬
der that the public may live.
According to Dubuffet, the sin of
culture is that it holds that a work of
art is something to contemplate in¬
stead of something to experience or
to make. Art only frees us if it is our
own, and the mission that certain ar¬
tists have assigned to themselves is to
appeal to our creativeness, not so
much by giving us a model to imitate,
as a master does to a disciple, as by
giving us an example of freedom to be
lived.
The ruse of culture is that the most
provocative work is soon commer¬
cialized, the gesture of revolt institu¬
tionalized, the appeal ignored. At least
the artist was able to free himself. For
this is what he is seeking in the third
place, sometimes alone, without re¬
cruiting companions to share his ad¬
venture, without claiming that his free¬
dom calls for that of others.
Freeing himself always means ex¬
pressing himself, but it does not mean
making a confession or an exhibition.
More deeply it means coming out of
himself and getting rid of the self.
He must gamble to lose himself, and
his authenticity is proportionate to his
abnegation. Hence these strange, in-

New Realism:
more real than the real thing
New Realism is an art movement that began in the U.S. in the
1960s and now has a number of adepts in Western Europe.
Sometimes termed "photographic art", it aims to recreate real
things with more realism and detail than the original.
Thus, "Artist Seated" (left) by Duane Hanson of the U.S.A. Is not
a real live person but a super-realist sculpture made out of
painted plastic, polyester and fibreglass. Only the clothes,
glasses and chair are authentic.
The painting of the giant tyre (above) is by a young Swiss
artist, Peter Stämpfli. Though he has reproduced each element of
the tyre tread, Stämpfli does not wish to be taken for a Realist
artist: since 1969 he has painted nothing but oversize motor tyres,
measuring as much as 6 metres (as in photo). Blown up to this
size, the tread pattern takes on an abstract graphic form.
scrutable, anonymous works produced
by automatic writing, gestural painting
and aleatory music. (In other words,
works freed from pre-established
signs, habits and constraints.)
This world which the artist inhabits
and which he opens up to us, is it not
a hallucinatory world, a refuge from
harsh realities? When we think that
we are freeing ourselves and freeing
the world, are we not exchanging the
real for the unreal, thought for reverie,
freedom for caprice? Is not art a
mirage and a luxury?
Here certain artists throw light on
the subject by invoking something that
goes beyond the real and all contem¬
porary art is surrealistic in some way.
Their works do not set the imaginary
against the real: they disclose a being
in the state of nature, not torn by this
opposition because the subject has
not yet broken away from the object
in order to domesticate it by means of
concepts or tools.
Then the world is what we dream,
but our dreams reflect the world: the
world dreams with us and it is the
world's dreams which art records until
science rejects them.
While in the socialist countries cer¬
tain forms of contemporary art are de¬
cried as symptoms of decadence, in
the Western countries themselves
these productions are not always sym¬
pathetically received. Evidence of
this is provided not only by the public
which continues to frequent museums
of classical art, but also by many cri¬
tics or specialists in aesthetics. We
said at the outset that the old always
continues to exist alongside the new.
We must not forget this as we empha¬
size the new in an attempt to deter¬
mine its true place and to under¬
stand it. '

2a ART IN THE
" SOCIALIST
COUNTRIES
The many facets of Realism
by Bêla Köpeczi
'EVELOPMENT presents
certain common features in all types
of countries, but the situation of liter¬
ature and art assumes special charac¬
teristics in the Socialist countries.
The changes that have occurred in
means of presentation, reproduction
and dissemination influence art and its
function in these countries as else¬
where, but do not necessarily lead
to the same results as in capitalist
society.
The radical changes that have affect¬
ed the economic, social, political and
cultural structure play a decisive part
from the standpoints of the develop¬
ment of artistic and literary production,
the education of the public and the
use of the mass media.
In the Socialist countries art has its
place in that great undertaking that
Lenin called a cultural revolution, the
characteristics of which are as follows:
extinction of the cultural monopoly of
the former ruling classes; raising of
the cultural level of the worker and
peasant masses; creation of a new
intelligentsia; support from the State
for the development of the sciences
and the arts; conscious activity of the

Communist Party and of the Socialist
State, aimed at achieving these objec¬
tives. This programme implies the
existence of an art which appeals to
the broad masses and the democratiz¬
ation of its dissemination.
Under these conditions, a work of
art cannot be regarded as an article
of trade even if, in the present stage
of evolution, it does retain some of
the characteristics that this term
implies.
Guided by the principle of the
educational rôle of art, socialist cultu¬
ral policy endeavours to disseminate
and to make accessible, through the
grant of considerable subsidies, the
loftiest values of past and present.
This conception of culture can lead to
an over-simplified didacticism but,
even in that case, it is hardly possible
to deny the advantages offered by
selection based on value judgements.
The results obtained at the level of
the dissemination of classical literature
and art are undeniable; in this con¬
nexion there has been much talk of a
"conservative" policy, but we con¬
sider, on the contrary, that the "rebirth
of the classics" has led to a raising
of cultural standards and to the human
enrichment of the broad masses.
The difficulties of choice arise espe¬
cially in connexion with current pro¬
duction, where the demands of politics,
aesthetic concepts or simple ques¬
tions of taste may lead to erroneous
judgements.
Thus products of varying rigidity,
insignificance or bad taste can be
disseminated, especially in the field of
light entertainment, where we find
certain features of a "consumer cul¬
ture" inherited from the past or import¬
ed or imitated from Western Europe.
Whereas in Western Europe the
artist, even if he regards himself as
"committed", frequently lives on the
fringe of society, in the Socialist coun¬
tries he takes part in the life of the
community. The commitment of so¬
cialist writers and artists does not
mean in any way that they are obliged
to take a stand on matters of current
political interest, and it does not
necessarily involve the production of
illustrative works, as certain opponents
would have it.
Nevertheless, if one approves of
the aims of socialism one cannot
adopt the same opposing attitude
which, within a society dominated by
capitalism, would stem from one's atti¬
tude as an opponent of that particular
social order. The commitment of the
socialist artist is no more than a cons¬
cious identification with the cause of
the working class, and this stance
implies the creation of an art that is
democratic and humanistic in char¬
acter.
That being said, it must nevertheless
be recognized that this new attitude
of the intellectual in the community is
not easily achieved, for it is subject

to the misunderstandings of politics as
well as to those of the artist, and it is
often at the mercy of conflicts of an
objective nature that arise between
these two spheres of human activity.
Moreover, it does not necessarily
follow that an artist living in a Socialist
country is a Marxist: the problems that
we have touched on naturally assume
a different light for those who are not
Marxist, and the nature of the con¬
tradictions that these artists have to
contend with is also different.
It is primarily by their creative activ¬
ity that the writer and the artist take
part in the building of the new society.
In this task they are assisted by the
State, which places orders through the
intermediary of the cultural institutions,
establishments or factories and which,
through the same network of organiz¬
ations, undertakes to disseminate their
works.
Government bodies promulgate laws
aimed at ensuring effective protection
of the authors' rights, thus enabling
a considerable body of writers and
artists to live solely from their profes¬
sion. The State subsidizes artists'
funds which pay out advances and
grants to their members, deal with
problems of social security, maintain
homes for rest and creative work and
in some countries they may even have
their own publishing houses, sales net¬
works and so forth.

NDER the influence of
social reality and Marxist theory vari¬
ous literary and artistic trends of a
socialist character have come to light
during the past hundred years. Some
consider as "socialistically realistic"
only those works which extend the
classical tradition, whereas others refer
only to tendencies originating in the
avant-garde of the beginning of the
century.
Looking beyond this quarrel bet¬
ween schools, we believe that it is the
co-existence of these movements
which, from the beginning, has char¬
acterized the evolution of the new art.
The novels of Gorky, Alexis Tolstoy or
Sholokhov, the theatrical schools of
Stanislavsky, the paintings of Deineka,
Sarian or Favorsky, the statues of
Mukhina, the symphonies of Shosta¬
kovich and the ballets of Prokofiev
prove that it has been possible to
keep faith with a certain realistic trad¬
ition of the nineteenth century and to
achieve undeniable successes.
The poems of Mayakovsky, the films
of Eisenstein and the theatrical innov¬
ations of Meyerhold, to mention only
these, are there to show that the
movement which borrowed from futur¬
ism, expressionism or constructivism
was also capable of creating durable
works.
We find the same tendencies, with
national variants, among the other
peoples of the Soviet Union, in the
other Socialist countries of Central
Europe, Asia and America, and in the
works of Marxist writers and artists
in non-Socialist countries.
In some countries, such as France
(Aragon, Eluard) or Czechoslovakia
(V. Nezval), it is the avant-garde that
has been predominant; in others (as
in the case of the German writers
Bertold Brecht, Johannes Becher and
Anna Seghers) we observe the co¬
existence of several trends; in some
others we note an early attempt at
synthesis (as in the poetry of the
Hungarian, Attila Jozsef).
While admitting the importance of
tradition in the formation of the new
art, it should not be forgotten that its
representatives are seeking to assert
not only continuity but, above all, dis¬
continuity in the evolution of art. The
socialist artist is searching for novelty
in themes and forms and, at the
present stage, we are witnessing
experimentation in every sector of art
and literature.
In a note on literary and artistic
developments in the Soviet Union,
Mikhail Alpatov describes the present
situation in these words :
"It was towards the end of the
1950s that a new wave of artistic
research began to develop, especially
among the younger generation of
artists and poets. They were beginning
again to show an interest in the post-
impressionists and to rehabilitate the
Russian art of the beginning of the
century. Attempts were being made to
link up with folklore traditions and
those of ancient Russia.
"It cannot be said that all these
searchings have been crowned with
success. There always remains a dan¬
ger of eclecticism. By imitating fine

today finds different approaches to
art. In most of these countries
Socialist Realism is the accepted
artistic method that presupposes
that art should depict historically
concrete though changing reality.
Art in Socialist Realism is consi¬
dered as having primarily an edu¬
cative role to broaden the cultural
horizons of the people and Instil
in them feelings of humanity and
internationalism.
In certain Socialist countries, in
addition to Socialist Realism, there
are other methods of art which can
be said to approach artistic research
in Western countries.
Some examples are shown on
these two pages and the front cover
(Poland), the back cover (Cuba), as
well as pages 21 and 23. Here
we reproduce works by artists of
the U.S.S.R.: Left, "Young Girl with
a Little House" by Alexander Tys-
chler (1962); below, "Clown" by
Aleksei Anikeenok (1965); right, "The
Sumgait Synthetic Rubber Factory"

examples one risks losing one's
originality and one's national char¬
acter. 'But however that may be, the
faults of the preceding stage are
disappearing in every realm of art and
above all in architecture and in the
decorative arts."
Let us add that in the other Socialist
countries we are witnessing a return
to certain manifestations of the avant-
garde in the 1920s and an increase
in the interest aroused by current
literary and artistic trends in Western
Europe.
True innovation, however, resides
not in the search for new forms, but
above all in the search for a new
content. During revolutionary periods
socialist art has presented man in his
struggle to bring about a radical
change in society.
Today, at least in some Socialist
countries, the forms of the combat
have changed: writers and artists are
seeking to define the characteristics
of socialist personality in conditions
of peaceful construction. What is on
the agenda is the expression of a
real humanism one that takes into
account the individual and is opposed
to .alienation, depersonalization and
nihilism.
As to their basic aims, art and
cultural policy in the Socialist coun¬
tries are determined by Marxist phil¬
osophy. The two basic ideas that
govern Marxist doctrine in this matter
can be summarized as follows: art is
a reflection of reality and, accord¬
ingly, a means of knowledge; sec¬
ondly, art has a social function, name¬
ly, it must help to change the world.
These basic notions have been inter¬
preted in very many different ways
under the influence of social, political
and cultural development. For an

Science and technology today hold a growing fascination for many modern
artists ; the achievements of science provide a new source of artistic inspiration;
technological advances have made available to the artist a wide range of new
materials and working techniques (see photos and captions pages 8-9). On
this double page we present a few works by artists from different parts of the
world produced with the aid of electronic computers.

UNITED STATES. Right, a work by A. Michael Noll, an American
research engineer who became involved in computer art by accident
when his microfilm plotter went wrong and produced an unusual
linear design. Later he took part in the first computer art exhibition,
in New York in 1965. In this work Noll programmed the computer
to repeat the same curve 90 times; the resulting composition
bears many similarities to certain Op Art or serial art creations.

to paper of the oscillations of two pendulums. It took several years of research before he was able
to control his "ornamentograph" (the name he has given to his apparatus) and select the forms and
shapes he wanted to produce. Radovic has succeeded in arriving at a mathematical formula which
expresses the virtually limitless pattern variations that the ornamentograph can produce.

### 50654: Art in the Socialist countries: the many facets of realism

SOCIALIST ART (Continued)
Where content is more important than form
understanding of the present debates
we have to go back to the sources
and compare what they convey to us
with the different interpretations that
have appeared over more than a
century.
According to the Marxist view the
various forms of social conscience are
the reflections of objective reality, of
which the knowledge, understanding
and change are the aims of all human
activity. Reflection does not mean
photographic reproduction, but rather
the building of a model serving to
bring out by strictly artistic means
the essence of human phenomena.
The founders of Marxism consider
that in literature as in art it is realism
that corresponds to their philosophical
view. "Realism", writes Engels, "sup¬
poses, in my view, in addition to accur¬
acy of detail, the exact representation
of typical characteristics In typical cir¬
cumstances."
Realism of this kind is not one
artistic tendency among others it is
considered as a method that makes
it possible to understand the complex
relationships that lie behind changing
reality.
I
20
I T is thus that tho problem
of the method leads to the theory of
reflection. This conception was appli¬
ed by critics and historians of art and
literature in the Soviet Union in the
1920s and in particular by Anatoli Luna-
charsky.
In the application of the theory of
reflection to the realm of art the
philosophy of György Lukacs is par¬
ticularly notable on account of its
content and of the widespread interest
that it has evoked. In Lukacs' phil¬
osophy the influence of Hegel's
aesthetics matches in addition that of
the ideas of Marx and Lenin on liter¬
ature. According to this theory artistic
mimesis consists in an "imitation" of
reality, made possible by a subjectivity
pushed to its extreme, which brings
into relief the essential moments of
the phenomena from the point of view
of the evolution of mankind.
Lukacs distinguishes between artis¬
tic and scientific knowledge. The aim
of science is to present a reality
independent of the knowing subject,
whereas art achieves unity of the sub¬
ject and of the object, which ensures
its specificity.
The work of art produces an affec¬
tive and mental shock that Lukacs
taking the old term used by Aristotle
and reinterpreting it in his own way
calls catharsis. Catharsis enables
man to go beyond the stage of indiv¬
iduality to reach that of the generic,
that is to say, to identify himself as
an individual with the cause of man¬
kind.
In the 1930s, writers and theorists
discussed the correctness of this
philosophy. Bertold Brecht among
others took the Hungarian philosopher
to task for the over-passive character
of his theory of reflection. For the
great German playwright, "Realistic
art is an art of combat. It combats
false conceptions of reality and im¬
pulses that go against the real interests
of mankind."
Although the majority of Marxist
thinkers accept the theory of reflec¬
tion, the aesthetic and historic aspects
of the problem continue to be discus¬
sed. The representatives of the "great
realism", while combating, and cor¬
rectly so, sectarianism, set up as an
¡deal the works of the classical writers
of the nineteenth century and of their
followers, the works of, say, Balzac,
Tolstoy or Thomas Mann.
The thesis that contrasts this real¬
istic art with anti-realistic art a label
under which it was intended to include
not only bourgeois decadent art, but
also innovating trends of the revol¬
utionary avant-garde (German expres¬
sionists, Russian futurists, surrealists
of central Europe, and the like)
implied an unduly simplified vision of
the true historical process.
At the present time there are various
contending philosophies, varying from
the theory of realism considered as a
general trend, illustrated by the works
of the great classics, to the theory of
"Réalisme sans rivages" ("unbounded
realism"), which is meant to include
all the trends of the twentieth century
and any work of value. This discus¬
sion touches on the very foundations
of the theory of reflection, since some
theorists contrast with it, in one way
or another, myth, activity and subject¬
ivity.
Marxist aesthetics postulates the
primacy of the content, while declar¬
ing its dialectical unity with form.
Here content and form should be
taken to mean two aspects of the
work of art that cannot exist indep¬
endently of each other: the content is
the reflection of the essential relation¬
ships inherent in a subject; form is, in
the last analysis, the image that
expresses these relationships and
ensures communication between the
creator and the receiver.
Generally, a distinction is made
between the inner and the outer form.
In the novel, for example, the inner
form is made up of the characters and
composition, the external form is
reduced to technique. Marxist aesthe¬
tics gave little attention to analysis
of questions of form, which has cer¬
tainly harmed its development and
suggested the idea that it is only
concerned with the content of works
of art, especially their political or
ideological content.
In The German Ideology, Marx and
Engels already stated that "it is not
consciousness that determines life,
but life that determines conscious¬
ness."
One of the forms of this conscious¬
ness is the aesthetic form which is
linked by a series of transitions to the
material basis. "Whether an individual
like Raphael", write Marx and Engels,
"is able to develop his talent depends
entirely on the demand, which in turn
depends on the division of labour and
the consequent conditions of men's
education."
The demand therefore depends on
the division of labour, i.e., on the
separation of the various activities that
lead to one another, a separation which
gives rise to the birth of classes and
social strata. This means that in defin¬
ing the demand Marx and Engels
attribute an important rôle to the
cultural situation of each society and
of each class or stratum of this
society.
ARXIST aesthetics recog¬
nizes that the relations between the
artist's class affiliations, his vision of
the world and his creative activity are
very complex.
Writing about Balzac, Engels already
underlined the contradictions that may
exist in this connexion: "The fact that
Balzac was forced to go against his
own class sympathies and political
prejudices, that he saw the inevit¬
ability of the end of his beloved arist¬
ocrats and that he described them as
not deserving any better fate; the fact
that he saw the true men of the future
only where they were to be found at
the time (i.e. among the Republicans
of the Cloître Saint-Merri, 5-6 June
1832), that I regard as one of the
greatest triumphs of realism and one
of the most striking characteristics of
Balzac in his later years."
With regard to Leo Tolstoy, Lenin
detects similar contradictions, but he
does not explain them solely by the
writer's individual vision of the world.
"The contradictions in Tolstoy's
views", he writes, "are not those of
his strictly personal thinking; they are
the reflection of the social conditions
and influences, of the historic tradi¬
tions complex and contradictory to

The explosion
of Spring

"The world batters, rends apart and re-fashions us; I felt that this process could be expressed
In a collage", declared the Czech artist Jiri Kolar, creator of this "sprung" or "exploded"
version of Botticelli's "Primavera". Kolar's technique consists in cutting an original work in
vertical (as here) or horizontal strips or in squares and reconstituting it on a vaster scale
with a multiple mirror-image effect Kolar's collages have earned him the Prize of the Säo
Paulo Biennale and were exhibited at the 1969 Salon de Mai and at Galerie La Hune in Paris.
the highest degree that determined
the psychology of the different classes
and different strata of Russian society
at the time following the reform but
preceding the revolution."
While stressing the determining rôle
of society, Marx did not deny the
relative autonomy of art in relation to
economic and social developments.
In his Contribution to the Critique of
Political Economy we read: "In the
case of art we know that specific
periods when art has flourished are
in no way related to the general devel¬
opment of society nor, consequently,
to the material basis or, in a way, the
framework of its organization."
And Marx wonders without, how¬
ever, giving us any answer about the
causes of the survival of the great
artistic moments of antiquity; "The
difficulty does not consist in under¬
standing that Greek art and the epic
are linked to certain forms of social
development. The difficulty consists
in understanding that they can still
cause us aesthetic enjoyment and are
considered in some respect as a norm
and as inimitable models."
In taking this standpoint Marx draws
our attention to the dialectics of the
relationship existing between the evol¬
ution of art and the evolution of
society; he warns us in advance
against any attempt to reduce these
complex relations to a simple autom¬
atism.
Inspired by the general lessons of
Marxism and by the ideas of the
Russian democratic critics, such as
Belinsky, Chernyshevsky and Dobrol-
jubov, and of French positivists such
as Hippolyte Taine, G.V. Plekhanov
attempted to prove, in a logical step-
by-step manner and with the aid of
concrete analyses of certain works
and certain trends in French and Rus¬
sian literature, that "any ideology
including art and what is called belles-
lettres expresses the tendencies and
inspiration of a given society, or, in
the case of a society divided into clas¬
ses, of a given social class."
This conception, which disregards
Marx's warnings, profoundly influenc¬
ed Marxist aesthetics for quite a long
time and gave rise to a school of
vulgar sociologism. The sociologists
who adhered to it established too
direct a link between the artist's class
affiliations and his work, and above
all they stressed the political and
ideological importance of literature
and art.

### 50654: Art in the Socialist countries: the many facets of realism

SOCIALIST ART (Continued)
Ideology and the creative artist
22
Invoking the radical change in
society the representatives of the
organization Proletarskaja Kultura
("Prolet Kult"), as also those of revol¬
utionary futurism, rejected the heritage
of the past and advocated the need
to create an absolutely new art, a pro¬
letarian art.
"As regards the questions posed by
culture, we are immediate socialists",
declare the proponents of Proletkult,
" we declare that the proletariat must
forthwith and without delay create in
its image socialist forms of thinking,
feeling and living." The futurist
Mayokovsky did not say anything
different, even if he contested the Pro-
letkult thesis whereby proletarian cult¬
ure can be created only by writers and
artists with a working-class back¬
ground.
In 1923, Mayakovsky declared that
it was necessary to "combat the
application of the working methods of
the dead to modern art." And in 1928
he attacked the worshippers of the
past who "under the pretext of educ¬
ation take us in the cemeteries to the
tombs of the classics."
IhENIN attacked this idea
vehemently, defending the principle of
continuity in the realm of culture and
rejecting the utopianism and illusionism
of the "leftists".
"Marxism", he states, "has acquir¬
ed world-wide historic importance as
an ideology of the revolutionary pro¬
letariat due to the fact that, far from
rejecting the most precious conquests
of the bourgeois era, it has on the
contrary assimilated by transformation
everything precious in the develop¬
ment of human thinking and culture
over a period of more than 2,000
years.
"Only subsequent work on this
basis and in this direction, animated
by the practical experience of dicta¬
torship of the proletariat, which is the
final struggle against all forms of
exploitation, can be recognized as
constituting the development of a
truly proletarian culture."
He was thus defending the funda¬
mental positions of Socialist cultural
policy, but abstained from intervening
in aesthetic matters. In conformity
with the standpoints of the central
committee of the Communist Party of
the U.S.S.R., Lunacharsky, who for
a long time was in charge of Soviet
cultural policy, favoured in the twen¬
ties the development of, and compet¬
ition between, the various movements.
The defence of the heritage of the
past was a just cause; dogmatic
policy, however, made use of it in
order to condemn avant-garde trends,
even revolutionary ones, thereby
limiting freedom of creation.
It was with a party resolution of 1932
that the struggle against leftist ten¬
dencies and against avant-garde trends
began. The proposed aim was to
organize single associations of writers
and artists, instead of having extrem¬
ely restive small-size movements, and
to promote a drawing together of
creators considered as "fellow travel¬
lers". In the beginning, this change
seemed likely to favour cultural devel¬
opment. Later it was realized that
unity meant uniformization in the ser¬
vice of a dogmatic policy.
Marxist theory, at the present time,
lays stress on continuity, but assigns
a more important rôle to innovation.
According to Marxist aesthetics, a
work of art is not solely an instrument
of knowledge (some critics of Marx¬
ism are wrong when they criticize
those writers for maintaining such a
view): it serves, in a complex way, the
conscious awakening of man and there¬
by influences his activity. Within the
workers' movement there was very
early evidence of a utilitarian trend
that wanted to attribute to literature
and art a direct educational rôle, above
all in political matters.'
While defending the reason for the
existence of "political" genres, Marx
and Engels rejected any kind of over-
didactic conception of art. "In my
view", Engels writes, "a novel that is
socialist in character, perfectly fulfils
its mission when, through the faithful
depiction of real relationships, it des¬
troys conventional illusions as to the
nature of these relations, shakes the
optimism of the bourgeois world and
forces people to doubt the lastingness
of the existing order, even if the
author does not directly indicate any
solution and even if, as the case may
be, he does not ostensibly take any
side."
In 1905, in an article entitled "The
Organization of the Party and the
Literature of the Party", Lenin defined
the function of socialist literature in
the following terms: "Literature should
become part of the general cause of
the proletariat, a small cog and a small
screw in the great social democratic
machinery, one and indivisible, set
going by the whole of the conscious
avant-garde of the entire working
class. Literature must become an
integral part of the organized, meth¬
odical and unified work of the Social
Democratic Party."
Much has been said about the
meaning that Lenin attributed to "the
party spirit", i.e., Marxist commitment
in the realm of art. There are some
(including Lukacs) who claim that this
article relates solely to the press
and that it has nothing to do with
literature proper; others insist that this
theory should be applied literally in
every situation.
It is certain that Lenin, in 1905, had
in mind socialist literature in general,
including belles-lettres.
After the October Revolution, the
party spirit meant for him the accep¬
tance of Marxist ideology and service
in the cause of the proletariat; but he
no longer insisted that all creators
should belong to the Party and he no
longer demanded, as he did in 1905,
that literature should be rigorously
subordinate to the demands of the
current political struggle.
The relationship between literature,
art and politics is therefore complex
and cannot be examined solely on a
theoretical plane. At any rate, both
on the aesthetic plane as in the realm
of the cultural policy of Marxism, there
are a great many contending stand¬
points. Some insist on the autonomy
of literature and art in relation to poli¬
tics, while others remain faithful to
utilitarianism and even to the dogma¬
tism of the past, two extremes rejec¬
ted by the majority of theoreticians.
Serving the cause of the prolet¬
ariat by artistic means signifies addres¬
sing oneself to the great mass of the
population and contributing to its
conscious awakening. This require¬
ment must have as a consequence the
birth of a literature and of an art of a
democratic or popular character.
B"UT how can this objective
be attained? After the discussions
of the 1920s, dogmatic cultural policy
imposed a certain cultural model, the
formation of which was also linked
with the social and cultural realities
of the Soviet Union, and later of the
other socialist countries. The chan¬
ges that took place after 1956 (with
the 20th Congress of the Communist
Party, three years after the death of
Stalin) made possible a more refined
view of the public and of the "folk"
character of literature.
In the theoretical discussions of the
1920s the different trends in socialist
literature and art including the avant-
garde hailed realism as their auth¬
ority. People spoke of a proletarian
realism, a dialectical realism, a roman¬
tic realism, etc. Finally, the expres¬
sion socialist realism was adopted at
the First Congress of the Writers of
the Soviet Union in 1934.
Socialist realism as an artistic
method regards as its aim the reflection
of the essential part of reality in a
historically concrete way. It implies
on the part of the artist adherence to
a materialist and dialectical concep¬
tion of the world and the undertaking

Wood carvings by Hunga¬
rian shepherds, decorative
spiced loaves prepared for
village fêtes, characters
from popular folk tales, all
these provide a well of
inspiration for Hungarian
artist Mihàly Schéner. In
his arrestingly original
works Schéner weds folk¬
lore to pop art, as in his

cotta sculpture of a hand,

flowers and with three of

zar, Melchior and Gaspard.
to serve the cause of the proletariat
and of socialism.
Socialist realism, illustrated by a.
considerable number of works of val¬
ue, is an artistic phenomenon and not
a figment of the mind nor the object
of a simple political directive, as some
people think. It is true that dogmatic
policy deformed this theory and that,
by its "aesthetic norms", it helped to
reinforce academic and schematic ten¬
dencies.
The ravages that were thus caused
were serious but the theory of socialist
realism is beginning to benefit from
the lessons of this evolution, as well
as from those of the development of
twentieth century literature and art.
The literary and artistic trends, the
aesthetic debates and the attitudes
adopted in cultural policy have given
rise during this half century, within the
socialist world and primarily in the
U.S.S.R., to an abundant theoretical
literature that is very badly known in
general and specially in Western
Europe.
During a certain period writings
stamped with the mark of dogmatism
received fairly wide circulation; for
some time now we have been witness¬
ing in Western Europe a renaissance
of the so-called Russian formalist
school, confrontations with the works
of Lukacs or Brecht, etc.; the other
aspects of this activity seem, however,
to be overlooked.
At the present time, thanks to the
social, cultural. and, in particular, artis¬
tic development, we are witnessing a
flourishing of a great many movements
and the development of very open
discussions between their spokesmen
in the various Socialist countries,
where the lessons of the past inter¬
national and national have their place
alongside the emerging forms of new
trends in literature and art.

N the developing countries
culture is being challenged. The basic
influence affecting all reflection on art
is, in fact, the confrontation of cultures
between the West and everything that
is not Western.
This confrontation has been a
particularly bitter experience not only
in the former colonies which have had
to fight for their independence and
which have not yet eliminated the
after-effects of a traumatic encounter,
but also in those countries whose
dynamic relationship with the West
assumes the aspect of peaceful
competition. How, in such countries,
are the cultures in this confrontation
regarded?
The national culture, first of all, is no
longer experienced, as it might have
been, in a kind of happy innocence.
Because it has been threatened, dis¬
qualified, often half destroyed, it is
henceforth thought out and desired as
the instrument of an intransigent and
impassioned self-assertion.
If we consider this culture as a value,
the West may, all unwittingly, have
contributed to it, not simply because
it has illustrated the value of its
own culture, but because after the
devaluing of the indigenous culture
by its conquerors, missionaries and
teachers it has, through its artists
and scholars, succeeded in revaluing it.
When Picasso becomes an enthusiast
for negro art, when ethnological
museums accommodate it and ethno¬
logists pore over it, the African
rediscovers his art. He sees it with
a stranger's eyes but not as a museum
exhibit regarded with lukewarm interest
or requiring, if it is to be understood,
a special effort of adjustment: he sees
it as his own art and that is what he
wants it to be.
This is a point on which all con¬
tributors agree: awareness of art is
linked to what Mulk Raj Anand, the
Indian writer, calls "the search for
national identity".
This search assumes a scientific
form in countries which are adequately
equipped for this purpose, as in India
where, says Mulk Raj Anand, "the
most enlightened students have been
concerned to relate the art expression
of the past and the present to the
practice of the arts. This has entailed
detailed studies of the archaeological,
anthropological, sociological and formal
aspects of our understanding within
the context of art expression. Most
of these studies are devoted to the
search for national identity."
(Among such studies from India are
"The Significance of Indian Art" by
Aurobindo (1951); "Arts and Man"
by Bardekar (1960); "Comparative
Aesthetics" by Pamday (1957); "Rabin-
dranath Tagore on Art and Aesthetics",
an anthology edited by P. Neogy
(1961), and a major study by Mulk Raj
Anand, "The Birth of Lalit Kala", due
to appear shortly in Unesco's new
international review, "Cultures").
Even when this identity is not
defined by scientific methods it is no
less passionately asserted. Thus
Leopoldo Zea the Mexican philosopher
and Carlos and Magis, the Argentine
writer, refer to the "search for Latin-
American genius and for its ability to
express itself" in Latin America at
the beginning of the century. The
Togolese sociologist, Ferdinand Agblé-
magnon reminds us of the reception
that the theme of négritude developed
by Senghor, Césaire and Sartre has
found in Africa. And Ali El-Rai, the
Egyptian writer, alludes to the literary
forms that "particularly suit the
aspiring Arab soul"
This unanimous assertion of a dis¬
tinctive spiritual identity is sometimes
all the more intransigent because it is
difficult to visualize it clearly and its
reality is clouded by ambiguity. Do
the roots of the South American
peoples lie in Europe or in America?
At the dawn of the twentieth century,
according to Zea and Magis, they
"demanded a return to that reality
which was previously regarded as
an obstacle: the particular Creole
synthesis (the indigenous basis re¬
modelled by the Iberian peoples)".
Furthermore, national identity cannot
be asserted pacifically it can only
define itself by opposition by opposi¬
tion to the western culture which
always risks alienating it, since it feels
challenged and menaced in its depths.
In regard to art the menace is even
more distinct, since art is more closely
integrated with daily life. This is cer¬
tainly so in respect of archaic cultu¬
res and is, in any case, exemplified
by Black Africa.
This "mixing" of art and life is very
well described by Ferdinand Agbléma-
gnon:
"It is not solely in grandiose events
or exceptional circumstances that ar¬
tistic expression in Black Africa is pro¬
duced or becomes apparent. It lies
in the rhythm of daily life, in the desire
to maintain a constant relationship
between the cosmic and the real, be¬
tween the exceptional and the banal,
and the art expressed in everyday ob¬
jects is the most pertinent and strik¬
ing illustration of this.
"We see, in objects of common
use ranging from chairs to scales
for weighing gold a series of signs
and geometrical figures which, apart
from their scriptural value, represent
a geometrical and architectural expres¬
sion sought solely for artistic pur¬
poses. To lose the secret of these
seemingly modest sources of expres¬
sion would be deliberate estrange¬
ment from the great traditional schools
of apprenticeship in artistic expres¬
sion."
HERE is a danger of this
secret becoming lost as soon as the
West stamps a new pattern on every¬
day life. What has a particularly cor¬
rupting effect on the genuineness of
art is its commercialization or, we may
venture to say, its prostitution. Mulk
Raj Anand has noted this clearly in
respect of India:
"But, whereas in the days of the
village republic, the craftsman was an
integral part of society, paid for and

Tradition is married to new art techniques in this fingerprint painting by Malwankar, an Indian artist who
depicts figures, elephants and flying steeds in a manner all his own. These figures are from his cartoon
film "Swayamvar", based on the ancient custom of a Rajput princess selecting a husband by garlanding
the prince of her choice. Malwankar rose from desperate poverty to a successful career as an artist.
Through his fingerprint painting he evokes the delicate stylized figures of Rajasthani and Mughal miniatures.

recognized for his service for the
community, the artist today is not pro¬
ducing material goods of a specific
marketable value but cultural goods of
which the value has yet to be recog¬
nized...
"Therefore the artist turns to film
poster work or commercial design for
a living, or he paints pretty pictures
with plenty of local colour in them
which may appeal to a certain kind
of foreign tourist or procure him a
patron among the diplomats; or he
paints decorative pictures for the
more sophisticated drawing rooms of
the big cities.
"There are a very few artists who
are immune to these peculiar social
conditions and who seek to answer
the challenge of their vision."
Thus national culture feels itself
threatened, even when it is marked out
for a new life which will only really
be its own if it accepts the challenge
that the West has issued.
How, in turn, is western culture
seen? The attitude it produces is bas¬
ically ambivalent. This culture is seen
first of all as something foreign: it is
the "other", and this "otherness" is
even more keenly felt since the
"other" has too often imposed him¬
self by force. But this culture is also
regarded as possessing prestige it
is allied to the spectacular advance of
technology, and neither the distrust nor
the resentment that it may arouse can
hide the fact of its vitality and power
of expansion from shrewd eyes.
What is more, it appears as an in¬
evitable line of advance; just as, in the
developing countries, the economy
must assume the harness of indus¬
trialization, so the black Orpheus must,
as Sartre has stressed, sing in French
if his voice is to carry across fron¬
tiers.
But the voice Is then no longer en¬
tirely his own: "Africans", observes
Ferdinand Agblémagnon, "including
grammarians, admit the impossibility
of translating certain emotions for
which words exist in the vernacular
language of their village... The privi¬
leged persons who succeed in a
complete break-through of the lan¬
guage barrier are few and far be¬
tween."
This culture, furthermore, is not sim¬
ply the "other", it is also the enemy.
Must we allow ourselves, then, to be
haunted and fascinated by it? It some¬
times happens, in fact, that its pres¬
tige is denied and its purpose de¬
nounced, mainly by Marxist militants in
the Third World.
In regard to this confrontation of cul¬
tures three solutions are proposed and
three attitudes adopted.
The first and the most passive, if
one may say so, consists in accepting
or even sanctioning a division which
tends to impose itself naturally. "No
developing country can escape a cul¬
tural "dichotomy", says Shu ich I
Kato, who describes the situation as
exemplified by Japan at the beginning
of the century:
"After the Meiji Reform (1868),
Japan adopted western political insti¬
tutions (parliamentary monarchy), re¬
taining however the traditional author¬
itarian values of military dictatorship.
Western technology was systematic¬
ally introduced and heavy industries
developed in urban areas without
modification of rural life (e.g. the con¬
tinuation of the exploitation of tenants
by landowners), without much change
in the production of a large part of
consumer goods (e.g. food consump¬
tion and clothing).
"Around the turn of this cen¬
tury, the educated Japanese, living
in the rapidly growing cities, worked
during the daytime in the westernized
industrial and governmental offices
and went home to spend the evening
in the traditional way: wearing the
kimono, sitting on a mat, eating rice.
Efficiency in western technology dur¬
ing the day and a delicate aesthetic
life of traditional values in the evening:
indeed a precarious balance for a
person.
"Accordingly, the architecture in
Tokyo of that time was divided into
two categories: all public buildings,
such as government offices, banks,
railway stations, schools, and large de¬
partment stores, were constructed in
the "western style" with bricks, stone,
concrete and steel, while practically
all living quarters were houses built
of wood in the traditional 'Japanese
style'.
"This split was also evident in the
cultural and educational facilities. The
National Academy of Music was com¬
posed of two separate departments
which were totally independent of one
another: one strictly for traditional
music and the other for western
music.
"The same was true of the National
Academy of Arts: a department for
"Japanese painting" and another for
"western painting". As a matter of
fact the Japanese painter of the time
was obliged to specialize either in
working in Indian ink and the tradi¬
tional water-colours or with oil on
canvas.
"Also in the theatre one either spe¬
cialized in the traditional Kabuki, Nô
and Kyôgen or in the 'New Theatre'.
The masses were rarely attracted by
the Kabuki, while the young intellec¬
tuals of Tokyo were witnessing per¬
formances of Shakespeare, Chekhov
and a few Japanese plays written in
the 'western' style. Except for rare ins¬
tances, actors of the Kabuki never per¬
formed in the 'New Theatre" and,
accordingly, actors of the "New Thea¬
tre' did not play in the Kabuki."
This situation, which was that of
Japan yesterday, prevails today in
countries which, simultaneously with
the achievement of independence,
have set about the process of moder¬
nization. But, because it is artificial
and difficult to tolerate, it will not last
any longer than it has in Japan. One
cannot exist for long on two levels,
torn between a native ego and a wes¬
tern super-ego.
As, in particular, this dual system
has repercussions on social stratifica¬
tion, it is also unacceptable. Partici¬
pation in western culture is the privi¬
lege on an élite, while the people re¬
main necessarily faithful to tradition;
and this élite because it is sensitive
to this fact and feels itself to be res¬
ponsible experiences a feeling of
guilt and a sense of treachery: can one
deny one's people and one's past?

catalytic
agent
"I sometimes compare tradition
to a chemical reaction", said the
famous Japanese architect Kenzo
Tange in an interview with the
"Unesco Courler" (Sept.-Oct.
1968). "It should act like a cata¬
lytic agent to create something
new, but the traditional form or
Inspiration should not be visible
in the finished product" Below
left, a garden created four cen¬
turies ago by the poet Sô-ami
at the Daisenin monastery, Kyoto,
where monks still rake the gra¬
vel beds in accordance with
a strictly established tradition.
Right, the elegant strength and
soaring lines of a modern build¬
ing conceived by Kenzo Tange.
And so, says Ferdinand Agbléma¬
gnon, "black French-speaking writers,
whether literally exiles or exiles on
the spot, regard themselves as out
off from the masses and from tradi¬
tional society. They have a sense of
guilt at living within another culture
and no longer feel exactly like their
illiterate brothers who are still in the
village; this mass becomes, for them,
the symbol of traditional society."
And he adds: "This new African lit¬
erature asks itself if it is only of signi¬
ficance in Paris, London or Washing¬
ton. It deplores being completely un¬
known in Africa itself. Does the artist
really achieve his goal when the peo
ple for whom the work is intended are
unaware of its very existence?"
For an artist, furthermore, playing
the western game does not mean that
he is sure of winning. Zea and Magis
have seen this quite clearly in Latin
America during the second half of the
nineteenth century:
"In Mexico, Chile and more espe¬
cially Argentina, leaders of the liter¬
ary and artistic movement sought inte¬
gration with European culture beyond
the Pyrenees, but this integration en¬
countered particular obstacles, due to
the circumstances in which the Latin
American peoples were living and the
deep imprint of the culture in which
they had been brought up.
For this reason the tendency for cul¬
ture to become the privilege of the
minority was, unfortunately, to grow
more marked while, at the same time,
the past inspired only a feeling of
aversion because of its symbolic iden¬
tification with the colony in the sense
of a synthesis of structures imposed
by the mother-cities of the Peninsula.
As a substitute for this past an
attempt was made to model trends of
thought, as well as literature and art,
on the pattern of trans-Pyrenean Eur¬
ope. But this substitution failed to
solve the problem, for the results of
this adherence so-called integration

with the western world were regard¬
ed by the European artists themselves
as poor imitations of their own creative
works. And indeed they were right,
because the Latin American artists
did no more than reproduce the same
themes and use a similar technique;
these themes were in fact completely
alien to their world, the world of the
artists who sought to absorb them."
There is, then, a second solution
which, although finding supporters
everywhere, will also be seen to be
impracticable. This is the defence
and illustration of the indigenous cul¬
ture against western temptations and
its glorification or even resurrection
where, in countries which have ex¬
perienced colonial rule, it has been
at least partially destroyed.
This project implies the return of the
creative artist to his people and almost
always his political commitment to the
struggle of the people, in which the
stake is often both independence and
socialism. In the words of Ferdinand
Agblémagnon:
"This commitment has differing de- .
grees and depths according to authors.
There is the commitment of the artist
in regard to everyday life which
means accepting the lot of the writer
or artist today.
"Then there is the personal, political
commitment. Following this trend of
thought, we can set side by side men
who, both in origin and destiny, are
extremely different: we think of Frantz
Fanon who became the protagonist and
the hero of the Algerian revolution;
Stefan Alexis, killed during the internal
struggle in Haiti; Christopher Okigbo,
the Nigerian poet, assassinated during
Islamic heritage of calligraphy
The search for new art forms linking past with present has, over
the past decade, been the driving force behind a school of young
artists in Teheran. The young Iranian painter Zenderoudi, seen
above in his studio, draws inspiration for his paintings from the
masterpieces of calligraphy that form the central core of Iranian,
and indeed all Islamic, artistic tradition.

and racial antagonisms are the major themes of the Moroccan
artist Farid Belkahia. Right, "Reflection", a painting produced
by Belkahia in 1961. While still a young teacher in a town of
south Morocco (he later became director of the School of Fine
Arts of Casablanca), his highly personal, clear-cut style soon
made him famous far beyond the frontiers of his native country.

the Nigerian war; Leopold Sédar Sen-
ghor, the poet-president who is ever
mindful of his political commitments
when he tries to reconcile his theory
of négritude with his country's imper¬
atives of economic development;
Mario De Andrade, head of a revolu¬
tionary party engaged in the struggle
for the liberation of Angola: Jomo
Kenyatta, who was a prisoner under
the colonial régime, and so on."
Commitment in aesthetic terms
the terms which concern us here
may also be total. It is accepted
today, or has been in the past, by a
proportion of the nation's intelligent¬
sia. In India, for example: "Some
part of it consciously fought back the
alien culture in defence of chauvinist
nationalism and tried deliberately to
revive the ancient ('spiritual') tradition
of culture and its artistic expressions
as against the 'material' forms of the
West," writes Mulk Raj Anand.
In Morocco, the appeal for a return
to the wellsprings is expressed in po¬
lemical terms by Allai al-Fassi, whose
words Zaghoul Morsy reproduces: "I
address my appeal to the writers of
this country, who spend their time ana¬
lysing aspects of human problems in
the light of foreign creative works... I
address my appeal to research
workers so that they may study our Is¬
lamic society, its civilization, thought,
philosophy and literature and no longer
follow the path of what they learned
at their French lycée... I am not for¬
getting those who sing of the achieve¬
ments of the socialists and others, and
of the sacrifices of Guevara and Lu¬
mumba... I ask them to glorify our
national struggle and Moroccan, Arab
and Moslem sacrifices."
In Black Africa we are aware of the
reception that the theme of négritude
has obtained sometimes expressed
in violent terms since it represents,
says Ferdinand Agblémagnon, "a kind
of cry for liberation."
He adds, however: "For some time
Blacks and non-Blacks have been ask¬
ing themselves about the value and
ambiguity of this theme and we have
heard a kind of anti-négritude theory
put forward." Why this change of
opinion?
The reason lies in the fact that the
search for one's identity cannot be
reduced to the glorification of the an¬
cestral past. It must look towards the
future and have due regard for the
sense of history. Marxist thinkers,
even if anxious to safeguard national
identity, refuse to adopt any line that
runs counter to internationalism. Non-
Marxist thinkers, such as Laroui in
Morocco, are just as sensitive to the
demands of historical circumstances,
the study of which argues against any
idea of Utopia.
The reality of the West is a fact
which cannot be ignored: "Whether
we try to refute it, liberate ourselves
from it or assent to it", says Zaghoul
Morsy in his comments on Laroui, "the
West is here with us as a prime fact,
and ignorance or imperfect knowledge

BY AND FOR AFRICANS OF TODAY. Far from remaining contentedly imprisoned in
the splendours of the past, African art, in all its 'forms, is branching out along a multi¬
tude of bold new paths. Examples of this new burgeoning are : above, "Racing Horses",
a linocut on rice paper by the 24 year old Kenyan artist Hezbon Owiti, and, below, a
colour-wash by the famous painter Iba N'Diaye of Senegal. Both as a teacher of art
and handicrafts and as a painter himself, Iba N'Diaye is involved in a constant struggle
against the facile perpetuation of a servile "primitivism" in art. What is needed,
he says, is "authentic African painting, by Africans of today, for- Africans of today".

of it has a nullifying effect on all
serious reflection and genuinely
artistic expression."
Furthermore, the future of the non-
Western countries lies along the path
of Westernization. To reject western
culture en bloc is to reject develop¬
ment of science and technology as
well; and what country can expand
today without industrialization? If it
accepts this industrialization while re¬
solved to maintain the purity of its
traditions, will it not lapse into the
dichotomy described by Kato?
The sole alternative to intolerable
duality is synthesis, and it is towards
a solution of this kind that national
ideologies are heading today, in full
awareness, moreover, that it is easier
to label it than to define and intro¬
duce it. Synthesis is, however, the
very word that Mulk Raj Anand uses:
"The study of important problems in
relation to artistic expression in tradi¬
tional societies, which have received
the impact of modern industrial cultu¬
res, can only be fruitful if we consider
the clash between traditionalism and
modernity as part of a new emergent
synthesis rather than as research into
two fundamentally opposed attitudes
of East and West, which have nothing
to do with each other."
In the case of India, Mulk Raj Anand
observes:
"After half a century of affirmation
of a false myth and the revival of
ancient and medieval Hindu culture,
on the parallels of a political myth, the
intelligentsia has recently begun to
awaken to the fact that new industrial
civilization, which it has accepted on
the social plan, must be absorbed."
He adds:
"And yet very few members of the
top hierarchy wish to confront the
contemporary human situation openly
because the problems of technology
versus human survival in the West
have made a good many ideologies
of the West, from Schopenhauer and
Max Muller to the Neo-Yogis, con¬
sider Indian mysticism to be the
answer to everything."
This illustrates the phenomenon to
which we have already drawn atten¬
tion, namely that it is sometimes west¬
ern thinking that reveals the indi¬
genous culture to itself and gives it
value. But it still remains for the indi¬
genous culture itself to achieve the
synthesis of the East and the West.
Mulk Raj Anand draws our attention
to the fact that:
"India has made a distinctive contri-

sion, the dance-drama, the acceptance
of a certain aspect of European
choreography has made various new
contributions possible from Mrinalini

Kutty, Parvati Kumar, Shanti Bhardan
and Maya Rao."
Another key-word that we find in
all writers is the "universal". To
overcome antagonism or contradiction
is to promote the universal. But we
must realize that this process cannot
be achieved without sacrifices. Shui-
chi Kato is very alive to this:
"With the changing of values, the
divorce from tradition has become a
serious problem. Gone are the days
when people differentiated between
western ability and the Japanese soul.
Western ability has become Japanese
ability. The dichotomy has disap¬

What's the score in the new music?
These are not works of modern gra¬
phic art, but musical scores by avant
garde composers, reproduced here
for the first time. Above, a thirty-
second extract from an unaccompanied
choral work, "Lux Lucet in Tenebris"
("and the light shineth in the dark¬
ness"), by the young Uruguayan com¬
poser Sergio Cervetti. The new nota¬
tion enables the composer to indicate
various intricate African or Balinese
modulations, etc., and to signal to
the performers changes of tone, rhyth¬
mic pace and volume. Right, an
extract from "Sonancias", a score for
piano and percussion instruments by
the Brazilian composer Marios Nobre.
The multiple key indications at the
left make the score easier to read.
The notations for percussion Instru¬
ments differ from those used In classic -

nancias" took place in Munich, Fed.

### 50655: Avant-garde and tradition in Asia, Africa & Latin America

ASIA, AFRICA, LAT. AMERICA (Continued)
Universality, keyword for the future
is an international phenomenon: Chris¬
tians too find their Christian soul
only on Sunday. The problem for
Meiji Japan was the dichotomy of the
culture; the problem for Japan today,
especially for artists and writers, is one
of regaining national identity."
Thus Kato demonstrates, not without
a hint of mockery, that sacrifices are
reciprocal in its modernization, pro¬
viding the example of industrialization,
the West itself has not remained un¬
changed. The advice to the develop¬
ing countries reads thus: to follow the
West is not Westernization but rather
"planetarization". And it is in this way
that what Hegel termed the "concrete
universal" can come to pass.
B
32
'UT not enough attention
is paid to this demand for universality.
Kato warns us about this again: if an
attempt is made, in order to save
national character, to reduce the syn¬
thesis to a more or less illegitimate
compromise, beware of monsters!
"In the 1930s, simultaneously with
the rising of nationalism, politically-
inspired architects who had already
mastered the construction techniques,
started designing buildings with the
conscious purpose of emphasizing the
Japanese national character... The
conscious search for national identity
in architecture in the Japan of the
1930s resulted in the production of
architectural monsters."
From which he concludes:
"There is no other way out of this
technological age. Those who con¬
tinue to speak a local dialect will fall
into regionalism. Nationalism as a
major motivation of artistic creation
will produce only monsters."
Does this mean, however, that the
sacrifice of a particular identity must
be pursued until its complete disap¬
pearance? By no means, and Kato
helps us again to understand this:
"Contemporary architects are no
longer striving for emphasis of Japa¬
nese character but are simply trying
to solve problems within the frame¬
work of the international architectural
grammar of the post-Bauhaus era. Yet
often enough there appears something
in their works which could be called
a sensibility of Japanese perception:
sense of colour, of form, of surface,
of line.
This Japanese character of architec¬
ture when it appears does so in res¬
ponse to the influence of the climate,
natural surroundings and the tempera¬
ment of the designer and not as some¬
thing conceived as the target of crea¬
tion. If the works of Kenzo Tange
are Japanese, they are so only in the
same sense that the works of Le Cor-
busier are French."
Hence his final remarks:
"The search for national identity
should not be a conscious motivation
for artistic creation. National identity
is something which results through the
unconscious tradition in the artist from
his search for the art beyond national
borders."
Art in every country is driven by a
great number of currents. Two exam¬
ples will suffice. Mulk Raj Anand has
identified five such currents in India:
"The phenomenon we see, and which
has been termed mutation of artistic
expression, displays several remark¬
able eccentricities
The search for influence from the
more fashionable styles of Paris, Lon¬
don, New York and Rome.
The research into the academic
realism of the West, borrowed by the
artists of the late nineteenth century.
The persistence of the revivalists of
the early twentieth century who had
sought to achieve spirituality in art by
borrowing the romantic forms of sixth
century Ajanta and Bagh Buddhist art
but within the framework of the seven¬
teenth century Mughal miniature.
The return to naive and primitive
expression as a more dynamic form
of revival.
The search for a synthesis between
the relevant inheritance of myth, love,
nature and human conflict in new con¬
temporary human forms, this itself
forming an inner content and thus ex¬
ploding into a new expression. This
becomes fused into the search for
personal authenticity."
In Egypt, Ali El-Rai distinguishes, for
his part, three schools of poetry:
"Today, the literary scene in Egypt
presents all three schools: the tradi¬
tionalist, represented by older poets
such as 'Aziz Abaza and 'AM Al-Guindi;
the romantic, by Mahmoud Hasan
Isma'il and Saleh Gawdat among
others; while a varying blend of social
realism and modernistic trends charac¬
terizes such younger poets as 'Abdel
Mu'ti Higazi, 'Afeefi Matar and Kamel
Ayyoub, to mention a few names.
"With varying intentions, forms and
techniques, we may safely conclude
that all the above-mentioned trends
concur in attempting to realize what
AI-'Aqqad and Al-Mazini stated (half
a century ago) as their goal: the crea¬
tion of a literature that is Arabic in
language (we may now add: and tra¬
dition), Egyptian in character, and uni¬
versal in appeal."
Furthermore, emerging everywhere
in this diversity, we find a subject of
major concern reflected in the ap¬
proach of creative artists: as AM El-Rai
has pointed out and as Ferdinand
Agblémagnon states in regard to Afri
can literature, art is, everywhere, "the
search for self and for genres". Agblé¬
magnon adds: "The search for self
arises inasmuch as it is necessary to
rediscover the ancient personality that
will provide the prop for the emergence
and full blossoming of the new; a
search, likewise, for genres and styles,
because the new language has not
been totally mastered."
It is not surprising that it is to
literature that this reflection refers. In
the practice of the non-Western coun¬
tries everywhere, literature is the pre¬
ferred medium, no doubt because it
facilitates expression of the ideology
underlying creative work.
Furthermore, even within literature
one genre seems, in turn, to have a
privileged place both because it at¬
tracts a really popular audience and
because it enables traditional themes
to be transposed into a modern form
the theatre. AM El-Rai notes: "Drama
in Egypt presents an even clearer case
than that of the novel of the way a
new form is transplanted into a coun¬
try's rich soil to become, before long,
a natural product of the land."
HIS is corroborated by
Agblémagnon: "We believe that the
new African literature and the new
African art will owe much to the thea¬
tre and it would seem that this genre
has a considerable contribution to
offer. We find in it all the elements
usually grouped in the traditional story
which is a continuous way of inter¬
preting and acting out life. We are
thus not at all surprised to see that
the African language theatre is winn¬
ing over a public whose existence was
unsuspected."
But this obviously does not mean
that other arts, such as architecture
in Japan or painting in Mexico, are not
displaying remarkable vitality. Indeed,
the quotations which we are using
testify that art and literature are every¬
where very much alive. The fact that
they may hold aloof from tradition or
become temporal rather than sacred,
as Mulk Raj Anand says, does not
weaken their vigour.
The western-inspired status that the
artist has acquired, coupled with the
individualization of aesthetic experien¬
ce, is giving art a new stimulus and
what Mulk Raj Anand has to say in
regard to India is no doubt applicable
to a number of countries: "The reali¬
zation by the individual of his potential
in the autonomous arts has introduced
a completely new factor of struggle
into a society through and within which
the fine arts had previously been part
of ritual."

Unesco honours
Byelorussian poets
Unesco, last November, marked the
90th anniversaries of the birth of two great
Byelorussian poets, Yanka Kupala and
Yakub Kolas, at a ceremony In Paris
attended by Mr. René Maheu, Director-
General of Unesco, and Mr. Piotr Abrassi-
mov, Soviet ambassador to France. Bet¬
ween them Kupala and Kolas were largely
responsible for the revival of Byelorussian
literature. The Government of Byelorussia
has erected a memorial in Minsk, capital
of the Republic, and has issued two com¬
memorative medallions in their honour, and
is publishing new editions of their complete
works.
Meteorology centenary
The centenary of the creation of the
International Meteorological Organization is
being celebrated this year by the World
Meteorological Organization under the title
"IMO-WMO Centenary". Set up in 1951
jes a U.N. Specialized Agency, WMO took
over the functions of IMO, which was
founded after the First International Meteo¬
rological Congress in Vienna, in 1873.
Between them, the two organizations have
worked for 100 years to encourage the
development and application of meteorology
as a science and to promote international
collaboration in meteorology.
'Firdausi' awards
by Iran and U.S.S.R.
Iran and the U.S.S.R. have jointly created
a number of prizes for outstanding works
in science, -literature and art which contri¬
bute to friendship and mutual understanding
between the two countries. The awards
are named after Abdul Kasim Firdausi, the
renowned 10th century poet of Tajiko-
Persian origin and author of the Persian
epic "Shah-nama" (see "Unesco Courier",
October 1971). The prizes will be awarded
every two years to two Soviet and two
Iranian citizens.
Link for a world
science data system
Unesco and France have set up an inter¬
national register of scientific periodicals,
yearbooks and other serial publications.
Named the International Serials Data
System, it is housed at the Bibliothèque
Nationale in Paris, and forms part of
Unisist, Unesco's world science information
system. It will help researchers to locate
data on serial publications more speedily
and will set up a network between libra¬
ries, publishers and international organi¬
zations.
Aid for Venice
Britain's "Venice in Peril Fund" is paying
for the restoration of two famous monu¬
ments in Venice: Sansovino's Loggetta
(the loggia at the base of the Campanile
in St Mark's Square) and the church of
San Nicolo del Mendicoli. Another recent
contribution to the Unesco-sponsored inter¬
national campaign to save Venice is a fund-
raising exhibition of original prints contri¬
buted by 123 Italian artists, held in Várese,
northern Italy.
Philae hieroglyphics
to be recorded
An Austrian Egyptologist, Professor Erich
Winter, is to record and prepare for
publication the more than 500,000 hiero¬
glyphic inscriptions on the temples of
Philae on the Nile. The work has been
commissioned by the Austrian Government
as a contribution to the Unesco-sponsored
international campaign to preserve the
monuments of Philae, the island inundated
when the Aswan dam project raised the
level of the Nile. The buildings are to be
dismantled and re-assembled on the nearby
island of Agilkia.
Flashes
A new micro-filming device developed

the Unesco-aided Tokyo Book Development
Centre.
Asia's population in 2000 A.D. is expect¬
ed to top 3,500 million (total world popula¬

BEAUTY IIM BOOKS
Sir,
Congratulations on your admirable
number dealing with the Art of the
Book and new discoveries of ancient
treasures in China (December 1972). It
was of outstanding interest, a pleasure
to read and a joy to behold.

ADVENTURE IN MUSIC
Sir,
I read with interest your photo report,
"Art from the Sound of Music" (Nov¬
ember 1972). This method of using
sound as stimulation for visual creation
is far from new I practised it with
emotionally maladjusted children during
the last war. There was one difference
in method. Music was played while
the children painted, and the piece
repeated as seemed desirable during
the time they were occupied.
Results were remarkable in terms of
colour and rhythm. But most of all to
be noted was a greater sense of orga¬
nization and control which certainly
emerged.
Since that time I have prompted stu¬
dents doing teaching practice with me
to use the same idea. It would appear
to produce good, lively, adventurous
results.

ITALY'S 'WORKING CLASS'
STUDENTS
Sir,
Among the extracts from the book,
"Letter to a Teacher", published in
your June 1972 issue, a passage refer¬
ring to Italian university students (pages
15-16) states:
"Selection reaches its goal. 'Daddy's
boys' constitute 86.5 per cent of the
university student body; labourers' sons,
13.5 per cent. Of those who get a
degree, 91.9 per cent are young gen¬
tlemen and 8.1 per cent are from
working-class families (Italian Statistical
Yearbook 1963, tables 113-14)."
As this refers to figures from surveys
carried out by Italy's Istituto Centrale
di Statlstica I have to point out that the
statements made are incorrect, being
based on misinterpretation and misrep¬
resentation of the data in the relevant
tables for the 1960/61 academic year.
In the statistics on first-year univer¬
sity students, the author of "Letter to
a Teacher" has taken into account, as
far as the social and economic class
of fathers are concerned, only sons
of "lavoratori dipendenti", blue-collar
wage-earners (6,301) and unpaid family
workers (150), totalling 6,451 and
accounting for 13.5 per cent of the total
(47,802). He has deduced from this
that sons of working-class fathers
account for only 13.5 per cent while
the rest (85.5 per cent) are "daddy's
boys".
Apart from the unflattering implica¬
tions of the words "daddy's boys"
whether in Italy or elsewhere the
conclusion is basically false since the
term working-class must be taken to
include not only wage-earners but also
the self-employed, such as craftsmen,
shopkeepers, owner and tenant-farmers
and so on, whose sons at university
number 12,292 and make up 25.7 per
cent of the total. In other words the
percentage of students coming from
working-class families (wage-earners
and self-employed) in 1960/61 was 39.2
per cent.
Even this figure must be regarded as
an underestimate since the working-
class should also include certain cate¬
gories of white-collar workers who
statistically fall into the executives and
white-collar workers group. Similar
considerations apply to graduates.
From these facts and in view of the
changes that have taken place since
1960, it is reasonable to assume that
Italian university students from working-
class families now account for about
half the total. This has been confirmed
by a special survey of first-year uni¬
versity students, also carried out by
the Istituto Centrale di Statistica. This
survey shows that in 1967/68 47.3 per
cent of first-year students belonged to
working-class families (self-employed,
wage-earners and unpaid family workers
combined).
These comments should correct any
wrong impression your readers may
have gained regarding the university
student situation in Italy.

IDEALS AND PRIORITIES
Sir,
I read with great interest but also
with some feeling of displeasure your
articles on the philosophy of Aurobindo
and the cultural city of Auroville (Oct¬
ober 1972).
The efforts for internationalization
and the spread of culture connected
with Auroville are commendable; so is
the design and architecture of the
majestic "Sphere of Unity".
But how much will all this cost? The
"Unesco Courier" frequently reminds
us about the problem of world hunger,
and when I think about the people of
India and the problems many of them
have to even subsist, I cannot help
feeling exasperated by this grandiose
extravagance.
I also wonder how many Indians will
benefit from the cultural influence of
Auroville when for many the major pre¬
occupation is where the next bowl of
rice is coming from.

ANIMALS IN PERIL
Sir,
As an international organization con¬
cerned with the protection of nature
against the growing dangers of pollu¬
tion, could not Unesco launch a
campaign to promote action for the
safeguard of animals and against their
systematic extermination. There are
many associations for the protection of
animals which would join in such a
concerted effort, and numerous news¬
papers have recently added their voices
to warn against the increasing threat
to animal life.
Despite the opening of parks and
reserves, the protection of animals is
still largely theoretical and certainly
ineffective in Western Europe as in
other parts of the world.

PEACE IN THE MINDS OF MEN...
Sir,
Looking over "A 21 -Point Program¬
me for a Global Strategy in Edu¬
cation" (your November 1972 issue), I
found many references to what can be
subsumed under the category of know¬
ledge and skills, but not a word about
attitudes.
I wish to challenge the educators of
the world with the question, "Know¬
ledge and skill for what?" Does not
the great danger of annihilation of the
human race from war come from the
highly literate nations with their formid¬
able technology of weapons, including
guided (or misguided) missiles? Is there
not a need for better character rather
than for more knowledge and skill?
Should we not set our sights on such
goals as world-mindedness and world
brotherhood and loyalty to humanity?
Has Unesco forgotten the slogan of
its founders "Since wars begin in the
minds of men, it is in the minds of
men that the defences of peace must
be constructed." Surely this is a
matter not oniy for education but for
science and culture as well. If we do
not know how to develop attitudes and
understanding for peace let us direct
our scientific resources in that direction.

FROZEN ASSETS
Sir,
Why not take eggs and sperm of
animals and freeze it so that, if a spe¬
cies becomes extinct, it can be brought
back to life again when we have obtain¬
ed an ecological balance?

Wetherby, U.K.
UNJUST COMMENTS 7
Sir,
As a teacher I was struck by the
extremely critical assertions in your
issue devoted to failure in school and
** the social background of students
(June 1972). Today's teaching system
is far from perfect and calls for chan¬
ges and adjustments to meet the needs
of the modern world. But this is no
reason for openly condemning the
teaching establishment as a whole
which, after all, has helped to make
us what we are. These accusations
of incompetence and partiality are by
no means fully justified, but the fact
that they are publicized by an organi¬
zation which claims to be objective
gives them all the more force.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT

THE ROSE IS THE MESSAGE
A graphic example of today's hard-hitting Cuban revolutionary poster art which
has developed since 1959. Many of Cuba's leading painters and graphic artists now
devote their talents to poster designing. This poster of a rose, a thorn, a drop of blood
is the work of a young Cuban artist, Alfredo Rostgaard, and was produced for the
Havana " Festival of Protest Songs " in 1967. It was originally made by the artist
in bright and vigorous colours. Here it has been interpreted in duotone.
