The angel of Nagasaki
This stone carving of an angel is from the Japanese city of Nagasaki, which was
destroyed by an atomic bomb on 9 August 1945. It originally formed part of the façade
of the Roman Catholic church of Urakami, above which the bomb exploded. In 1976 the
angel was presented to Unesco by the city of Nagasaki and is today preserved, as a
symbol of mankind's desire for world peace, in the Japanese garden at Unesco's Paris
Headquarters.

This issue of the Unesco Courier goes to press
at a time when the arms race continues to
gather momentum like a juggernaut, engulfing
in a seemingly bottomless pit resources that
are desperately needed for social and
economic development. It is largely devoted to
an examination of the disarmament issue in
relation to development and the establishment
of a new international economic order; to a
review of the human and material resources to¬
day being used for military purposes; and to a
survey of the problems involved in converting
these resources to the production of goods and
services that can contribute to development
the beating of swords into plowshares that is
symbolized by our cover. Contents of our next
issue will include articles on the city of Kiev,
which is this year celebrating the 1,500th an¬
niversary of its foundation; on the life and
work of the great Irish novelist James Joyce;
and on the flowering of Arabic poetry in
Muslim Spain. The theme for May will be
Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution.

### 48176: A World of justice, peace and progress

A WORLD OF JUSTICE
PEACE AND PROGRESS
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
Director General of Unesco
HE effort to build a world of justice, peace and progress for all
peoples is hindered by the proliferation of ever more
sophisticated means of mass destruction. The consequences
of this situation are alarming for two reasons. First, the threat
of an unprecedented hecatomb hangs over the entire world
and, as atomic radiation knows no frontiers, there is not a
single country or people today that is secure from the effects
of a major nuclear conflict.
Secondly, the vast human and material resources allocated to arms in¬
dustries and military research and development are thereby denied to those
who are engaged in the world struggle against the poverty which afflicts so
many people. The talents and energies of 500,000 engineers and research
workers are being used to perfect the technology of death and thousands of
millions of dollars are invested every year for that purpose. A mere fraction
of these intellectual, financial and technological means; if used judiciously,
would suffice to reverse the present trends and make it possible to start
reducing the gap between industrialized nations and developing nations, as
well as between privileged groups and underprivileged groups within each
nation. This might even alter the physiognomy of our planet.
The choice before us is therefore crystal clear. Either we carry on the arms
race with all its attendant injustices, and this perpetuates egoistic attitudes
and contributes, in its turn, to increasing the causes of conflict and the risk
of conflagration, or the nations of the world unite, placing their awareness
of a shared future above their short-term ambitions and individual interests.
The tremendous scientific and technological potential of the world could
then be used more often to serve peaceful ends, promote the common
welfare of mankind and help to forge relations based on justice and a sense
of solidarity.
It is with this end in view that Unesco, true to the mission of the United
Nations system, is expanding its activities in all spheres of intellectual effort.
Its Constitution proclaims that "since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in
the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed". The
Organization is accordingly doing all in its power to help to prepare the way
for disarmament in people's minds, to bring about a gradual change in men¬
tal attitudes so that more thought is given to the pursuit of peace.

### IGNORE

In this issue of the Unesco Courier we
present long extracts from an important
new report of the Secretary-General of
the United Nations entitled "Study on
the Relationship between Disarmament
and Development". The report,
prepared by 27 governmental experts
from the different world regions,
originated in a request to the Secretary-
General by the General Assembly at its
Tenth Special Session in June 1978. It
represents a major attempt by the inter¬
national community to investigate the
proposition that a balanced and
generally accepted pattern of global
economic and social development is in¬
extricably related to disarmament. With
the present issue we complete a three-
part examination of problems related to
disarmament: our April 1979 number
drew attention to the growing momen¬
tum of the arms race, and in September
1980 we traced the emergence of
education in favour of disarmament as a
distinct field of study.

DISARMAMENT
AND DEVELOPMENT
The greatest challenge
of the century
MANKIND is at present facing the
greatest challenge of the century.
The level and speed of the arms
race are bound to increase the danger of
war. The outbreak of a nuclear war would
jeopardize the very existence of all mankind.
During this decade peoples will be con¬
fronted with new technological, economic
and social challenges that will be made far
more complex if the arms race continues
unabated. In the context of halting and
reversing this race, it is also imperative to
find solutions to the problems impeding the
technological, economic and social develop¬
ment of the developing countries. Addi¬
tional human, material and financial
resources are needed to solve the problems
in such fields as raw materials, energy, food
production and environmental protection.
The challenges of the 1980s urgently call for
real and effective disarmament measures in
the interests of mankind.
The phenomena described by the terms
disarmament and development are widely^

### 48177: Disarmament and development; the greatest challenge of the century

"Disarmament is the process of
reduction in the size of and
expenditures on armed forces, the
destruction or dismantling of weapons,
whether deployed or stockpiled, the
progressive elimination of the capacity
to produce new weapons and the
release and integration into civilian life
of military personnel. The ultimate
objective is general and complete
disarmament under effective
international control."
in general terms but'it is worth¬
while to be somewhat more specific. Disar¬
mament is the process of reduction in the
size of and expenditures on armed forces;
the destruction or dismantling of weapons,
whether deployed or stockpiled, the pro¬
gressive elimination of the capacity to pro¬
duce new weapons and the release and in¬
tegration into civilian life of military person¬
nel. The ultimate objective is general and
complete disarmament under effective inter¬
national control.
The intervening process must be
characterized by balanced reductions that
ensure undiminished security for all States
and provide for the adequate verification of
compliance with agreed-upon reductions.
There is a clear place in this process for arms
limitation agreements that genuinely restrain
the quantitative growth and qualitative
refinement of arsenals, particularly as such
agreements would be invaluable as
confidence-building measures and serve as
stepping stones to actual reductions.
Similarly, in addition to a global process
of disarmament there is scope for unilateral
initiatives at the national level and for
regional arrangements, although there will
be distinct limits beyond which initiatives gt
these lower levels could not proceed. While
it is difficult to predict the course that a
disarmament process would follow, it is
clear that, particularly in the initial stages,
the reductions agreed upon will be modest
and that ample time will be allowed to-
achieve them.
Development, in its broadest sense, refers
to social and economic changes in society
leading to improvement in the quality of life
for all. At the most fundamental level, it
means providing for every person the basic
material requirements for a productive and
dignified existence. Economic growth, that
is, the expansion of output, is a prerequisite
for sustained development but development
cannot be reduced to economic growth.
Development also means that everyone
should have the opportunity to participate

DISARMAMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
"...Everyone should have the opportunity to participate
fully in the economic and social process and to share in its
benefits."	
fully in the economic and social process and
to share in its benefits.
If the global development effort is to be
morally and politically sustainable, it must
endeavour to provide for a pattern of
economic growth that would significantly
diminish within a reasonable time the
prevailing disparities between States in the
quality of life. It should also be
demonstrably compatible with long-term
resource availabilities and environmental
constraints, insofar as it is possible to deter¬
mine these limits.
Now one of the more attractive traits of
the human character is the deep-seated
sense of unease felt by those who are pros¬
perous when confronted by those who are
not just less prosperous but quite simply
poor.
It is true that history is overwhelmingly
the record of the rich endeavouring to sus¬
tain a state of ignorance, of insulating
themselves from the fact of poverty, but
this, clearly, is an expression of the moral
dilemma posed by inequality. At the interna¬
tional level, revolutionary developments in
transportation and cbmmunication have
made the world a very small place. The gap
between rich and poor nations has become
steadily more apparent and, therefore, more
difficult to ignore or deny. In a remarkably
swift reversal of political climate, the issue
of greater equality between the peoples of
various nations has been widely proclaimed
as the principal moral imperative of our time.
To its credit, the international community
has already taken an important step toward
confronting the problem of international co¬
operation for mutual benefit and the dif¬
ficulties and potential opportunities that this
problem presents. The sixth special session
of the United Nations General Assembly in
April-May 1974 adopted the Declaration and
the Programme of Action on the New Inter¬
national Economic Order.
The Programme was designed to lead to
the establishment of an international
economic order that would redress existing
injustices and thus help to correct ine¬
qualities and bring about a marked reduction
in the gap in standards of living between
developed and developing countries. Other
important steps that built on this initiative in¬
clude the Charter of Economic Rights and
Duties of States, the seventh special session
of the General Assembly devoted to
development and international economic co¬
operation and the International Develop¬
ment Strategy for the Third United Nations
Development Decade.
There were, and remain, significant dif¬
ferences among Member States on whether
the new order would require a radical
transformation or merely the reform of the
existing one, on the policy measures needed
to bring about the described changes and on
how rapidly it would be feasible to proceed.
Nevertheless, the Declaration and the
Programme of Action were adopted by con¬
sensus, reflecting the growing awareness on
all sides that the interests of the developing
countries and developed countries could no
longer be isolated from each other. The
prosperity of the international community
as a whole depends upon the prosperity of
its constituent parts. The necessity was
recognized of eliminating the widening gap
between the developed and the developing
countries and of ensuring steadily ac¬
celerating economic and social development
in peace and justice for present and future
generations.
This challenge to inequality gathered
force as the process of decolonization swell¬
ed the ranks of independent developing
countries and as the majority of these coun¬
tries felt increasingly frustrated in their
development efforts. Sustained achieve¬
ment of growth targets set in the Interna¬
tional Development Strategy for the Second
United Nations Development Decade prov¬
ed impossible for most countries. Their
terms of trade continued to move adversely,
agricultural production remained uncertain,
the trade deficits of developing countries in
manufactured goods grew rapidly, and of-;^
ficial development assistance, on the whole,
remained well below the target of 0.7 per
cent of the GNP of donor countries.
The share of developing countries in
world exports of manufactured goods was
increasing very slowly but this expansion
was distributed very unequally. Indeed, by
1977, just eight countries and territories
(Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and
Taiwan) accounted for almost 75 per cent of
the total exports of manufactured goods by
the developing countries.
Moreover, whether a developing country
pursued industrialization through a policy of
import-substitution or export promotion, the
almost universal experience was the creation
of industrial enclaves employing a small frac¬
tion of the work-force in relative prosperity.
Large segments of the population, often the
majority, neither participated in nor bene¬
fited from economic growth.
The World Bank estimates that, for the
developing countries as a whole, the ex-

has been that approximately 75 per
cent of the increase in aggregate income ac¬
crues to the top 40 per cent of income reci¬
pients. The ranks of the unemployed and
the underemployed and those living in ab¬
solute poverty have swelled inexorably.
These frustrations were compounded by
the evidence that, within the existing inter¬
national economic order, no plausible pro¬
jections of the rate of economic growth in
the developing countries would have any
appreciable impact on the gap in per capita
income.
In 1975, average per'capita income in the
developing countries was just one twelfth of
that in the developed economies. The
developing countries, however, are a quite
heterogeneous group, even excluding the
oil-exporting countries. In 1975, the gap in
per capita income ranged from a massive
40:1 for the very low income countries of
Asia and Africa to a little over 5:1 for the
Latin American and Caribbean countries.
According to the World Bank, even quite
optimistic projections of economic perfor¬
mance until 1990 would not diminish the
overall gap in per capita income. A narrow¬
ing of the gap in some countries, particularly
in East Asia and the Pacific, would be offset
by widening differential in the countries of
Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin
America.
In the initial statement on the establish¬
ment of the new international economic
order, considerable emphasis was placed on
stabilizing and increasing the level of export
earnings in developing countries. For raw
materials and primary commodities, the
principal measures suggested were price-
stabilization funds, buffer stocks and a form
of indexation.to the prices of manufactured
goods imported from the developed coun¬
tries. For the manufactured exports of
developing countries, stress was placed on
preferential access to markets in developed
countries.
Industrialization of the developing coun¬
tries was recognized as a necessary and vital
component of the new international
economic order and developed countries
and multinational institutions were en¬
couraged to adopt policies to accelerate the
transfer of labour-intensive, raw-material
processing and export-oriented production
to the developing countries. At the Second
General Conference of the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) held in Peru in March 1975, it was
8
declared that the target should be to in¬
crease the share of the developing countries
in world industrial production to at least
25 per cent by the year 2000 from the then
prevailing figure of about 7 per cent.
The proposal for a new international
economic order also addressed the question
of the transfer of technology. Technological
developments have made and will certainly
continue to make very significant contribu¬
tions to economic growth in all countries.
However, modern industrial technology is
concentrated almost exclusively in the in¬
dustrialized and developed countries.
Developing countries have not only
become greatly dependent on the flow of
technology, capital goods and technical ser¬
vices from the developed countries, but the
gap between the two groups in indigenous
technological capability has tended to
become increasingly accentuated. This state
of affairs has tended inevitably to produce a
pattern of technological development and a
consequent industrial structure that closely
follows that of the industrialized countries.
However, there are growing misgivings in
developing countries, including those that
have been most successful in industrializing,
as to whether this pattern of development is
really suited to meet their particular socio¬
economic needs. Accordingly, the pro¬
posals in the new international economic
order on this issue stress the need for
developing countries to have continued ac¬
cess to modern technology on improved
terms, to have this technology adapted to
their specific economic, social and
ecological conditions, and for measures to
expand their research and development
capabilities, particularly by means of greater
assistance from the developed nations.
On a closely-related theme, the proposal
for a new international economic order sug¬
gested that all efforts should be made to for¬
mulate, adopt and implement an interna¬
tional code of conduct for transnational cor¬
porations to ensure that the activities of
these corporations conform to national
development plans and to encourage them
to contribute to the new international
economic order by transferring technology
and managerial skills to developing coun¬
tries on favourable terms and to reinvest
rather than repatriate profits. Also of
significance in this overall context is the
work on an international code of transfer of
technology carried out in the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD).
The developing countries sought a larger
and more effective voice in international
financial forums, particularly the Interna¬
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank. Inflation in the developed countries
increased the import bill for developing
countries and eroded the real value of their
currency reserves. The general instability of
the international monetary system since
1971, particularly the uncertainty of ex¬
change rates, frequently had an adverse ef¬
fect on the value of commodity exports from
developing countries.
The developing world also felt excluded
from the decision-making circles that deter¬
mined the quantity, rate of growth and ac¬
cessibility of international liquidity. For ex¬
ample, of the $ 9,300 million created in the
form of special drawing rights in IMF bet¬
ween 1970 and 1974, only 25 per cent or
$2,300 million was granted to the develop¬
ing countries.
Finally, the developing countries argued
the need for a more conciliatory attitude in
the developed countries regarding the
repayment and servicing of external debt.
A combination of circumstances in the
1970s large increases in the price of oil,
stagnating markets in the developed coun¬
tries for exports from the Third World
and inadequate official development
assistance led to a disturbingly fast rate of
increase in the external indebtedness of
many developing countries. By 1977, nearly
12 per cent of the export earnings of theiV
"Inflation in the developed countries has increased the
import bill for developing countries and eroded the real
value of their currency reserves. The general instability of
the international monetary system has frequently had an
adverse effect on the value of commodity exports from
developing countries. The developing world has also felt
excluded from the decision-making circles."

world was absorbed in servicing
external debt.
To address these several concerns, the
developing countries demanded full and ef¬
fective participation in all phases of
decision-making for the formulation of
an equitable and durable international
monetary system. Despite a generally
austere global economic climate over the
past decade, a number of steps have been
taken in many areas. In the crucial area of in¬
ternational trade, efforts have been made to
reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade and
to extend the general system of preferences.
In 1979, agreement was reached to establish
the Common Fund.
Furthermore, developing countries have
secured increased IMF quotas and improved
arrangements for debt relief. In the field of
food and agriculture, the International Fund
for Agricultural Development was establish¬
ed in 1974 to foster the objective of greater
food security in the developing countries.
Food aid has also been expanded in the con¬
text of the Food Aid Convention and an In¬
ternational Emergency Food Reserve has
been established with a target as yet
unmet of 500,000 tons of cereals.
In 1980, an Interim Fund for Science and
Technology for Development was establish¬
ed, and the General Assembly initiated a
programme of study to investigate ap¬
propriate longer-term arrangements. Finally,
mention should be made of the negotiations
in the Third United Nations Conference on
the Law of the Sea, where the principle has
been accepted that the resources of the
oceans and of the sea-bed are part of the
"common heritage" of mankind.
While these and other measures that have
not been mentioned are important begin-
ings, overall progress towards laying the
foundations of a new international
economic order has been slow. The goals
and objectives of the Second Development
Decade remain largely unfulfilled and the
necessarily ambitious targets for the Third
United Nations Development Decade are in¬
dicative of the magnitude of the task ahead.
Primary responsibility for development
rests with the developing countries
themselves, but the targets for the Third
Development Decade and the longer-range
objective of significantly reducing the gap in
standards of living are quite unfeasible
without the strong assistance and co¬
operation ,of the developed countries.
Similarly, the deepening of co-operation and
the expansion of economic relations among
developing countries, both bilaterally and
multilaterally, will play an important role in
bridging this gap.
The call for a new international economic
order was in every sense a historic initiative.
It both reflected and took advantage of the
fact of interdependence to articulate the
reforms and changes needed to permit the
developing countries to become full and
constructive participants in the global
economic system on an accelerated basis. It
was, in effect, a plan of action for the co¬
operative management of interdependence,
albeit for an extended interim period, for
the particular benefit of the developing
countries.
Since 1974, it has become progressively
more apparent that a comprehensive assault
on underdevelopment is strongly in the self-
interest of the industrialized countries. Since
the new international economic order was
couched in the context of economic rela¬
tions among all groups of States, the
phenomena of interdependence and the ex¬
pansion of economic co-operation based on
mutual interest now embrace international
economic relations as a whole.
Altogether, sustainable global develop¬
ment is heavily dependent on what has been
termed the co-operative management of in¬
terdependence in its political, economic and
physical dimensions. It only remains to ask
whether such a perspective will emerge and
endure if the arms race continues unabated.
And the answer, surely, is no. Indeed, the
political climate accompanying the arms
race would appear to be the very antithesis
of a genuine and enduring spirit of co¬
operation and mutual accommodation.
The co-operative management of in¬
terdependence may be eminently sensible,
perhaps even necessary, for the realization
of global economic and social aspirations
but such a prospect must be regarded as
rather unrealistic as long as the arms race
continues.
THE
SINEWS

WAR
In the following section we
take a look at current use, for
military purposes, of labour
(including the scientific com¬
munity), industrial capacity,
raw materials and land. We
also examine two other
dimensions of the military
scene: military research and
development, and military ex¬
penditures.

MANPOWER
50 million people employed in
meeting the demand
for military goods and services
TENS of millions of persons around the
world are engaged in military activi¬
ties, whether as soldiers, sailors, air¬
men, bureaucrats, scientists, engineers or
general workers. It has been estimated that
over 100 million people are affected, directly
or indirectly, by the $500 thousand million
that the world now devotes to military
preparations. It has not been possible to
substantiate this figure, but the estimates
derived below suggest that roughly 50 mil¬
lion people are employed in meeting the de¬
mand for military goods and services, either
directly or indirectly.
Even this latter figure covers categories of
labour that differ in the manner and the
degree to which they depend on military
outlays. For our purposes it is useful to
distinguish between five categories of
demand for labour that can be said to
be generated or supported by military
expenditures:
a) The labour force, including uniformed
military personnel, engaged directly by
defence ministries to render services or to
provide goods and services that are ex¬
clusively military in character, that is, goods
and services that for all practical purposes
have no civilian utility whatever;
b) The labour force engaged in supplying
intermediate goods and services to the con¬
cerns engaged in meeting the direct demand
from ministries of defence for finished and
specialized military goods and services. This
indirect employment supported by military
expenditures relates to employment by sub¬
contractors, by firms supplying the subcon¬
tractors and so on. There will clearly be at
this level a lingering degree of specialization
for military work, but this would diminish
sharply as one moved down the manufac¬
turing chain;

and services that are little different
from those of the civilian market;
d) The labour force engaged in supplying
intermediate goods to the concerns under
(c), that is, a second category of labour
services supported indirectly by military
expenditures;
e) The labour force stemming from the
multiplier concept, which is quite distinct
from the other four categories. All expen¬
diture, including military expenditure, is sub¬
ject to a multiplier effect that permeates
throughout the economy. If, say, the
multiplier in a particular country is estimated
to be two, expenditure of $10 thousand
million will ultimately result in a total incre¬
ment in effective demand of $20 thousand
million.
Provided the economy is not already at
full employment, this means that, in addi¬
tion to the workers directly or indirectly in¬
volved in the provision of defence goods
and services, more jobs will be created as
the defence expenditure ripples through the
economy. Unlike the other categories of
defence-related employment referred to
above, however, these jobs cannot be said
to be "absorbed" by the defence sector.
The labour force directly engaged in ac¬
tivities that have no civilian economic utility
(category [a] above) includes the regular
armed forces and those paramilitary forces
that have similar functions and capabilities,
civilians employed in defence ministries,
scientists and engineers engaged in military
research and development and the workers
in industry directly engaged in the produc¬
tion of weapons and other specialized
military hardware.
At the present time, the world's regular
armed forces total some 25 million persons.
This figure has risen steadily over the past
twenty years, with net stability among the
developed countries accompanied by in¬
creases in many developing countries. The
global figure in 1980 was more than 10 per
cent larger than in 1970 and nearly 30 per
cent larger than in 1960. The countries of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO)
account for slightly over 40 per cent of the
total, China for about 17 per cent and the
developing countries of Asia, Africa and
Latin America for about 38 per cent.
Although it cannot be documented
statistically, it is important to observe that
the range of skills and experience in the
regular armed forces is very wide. A
disproportionately large fraction would con¬
sist of able-bodied young men with, at best,
a high-school education and possessed only
of basic skills in the handling of infantry
weapons. At the same time, however, there
12
would be significant numbers running into
millions world wide of mechanics, techni¬
cians, engineers, pilots and those with ex¬
perience in organization and management.
Indeed, the military's rising demand for skill¬
ed personnel of all kinds is a universally
observed phenomenon.
Paramilitary forces are forces whose func¬
tions and duties fall somewhere between the
civilian police and the regular armed forces.
The number of persons in paramilitary
forces with functions and capabilities in
terms of training, organization and
equipment that approximate to those of
the regular armed forces is estimated by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies
to be roughly 10 million world wide.
By and large, expenditures for para¬
military forces are not included in reported
military budgets. They remain relevant in the
present context because it is reasonable to
assume that an international climate that
made possible the implementation of disar¬
mament measures would also permit reduc¬
tions in paramilitary forces. Indeed, disarma¬
ment measures may require such reduc¬
tions.
The data available on civilians employed in
defence departments are far from complete,
but a very rough global estimate can be con¬
structed as follows. In 1975, nine coun¬
tries Canada, the Federal
Republic of Germany, France, Japan, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the
United States of America, and the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics employed some
2.5 million civilians in their respective
defence departments.
These nine countries accounted for two
thirds of world military expenditure, so that,
assuming a linear relationship and making a
small upward adjustment for the subsequent
growth in the size and cost of the world's
armed forces, it can be estimated that ap¬
proximately four million civilians are current¬
ly employed in defence departments world
wide.
The scientists and engineers engaged in
military research and development (R and D)
are of particular importance both in militan/
terms and in terms of economic and social
consequences. This subject is discussed
more fully below, and here it may simply be
noted that, world wide, an estimated
500,000 scientists and engineers are engag¬
ed in research and development for military
purposes.
Thus far we have identified 39.5 million
persons directly engaged in purely military
activities, but the statement that this work¬
force is totally unproductive from the civilian
standpoint must be qualified somewhat.
The armed forces are frequently called upon
for disaster relief operations, for example. In
many countries the armed forces also
engage in certain civilian activities. Similarly,
a fraction of military R and D is basic
research with potential civilian utility, pro¬
vided, of course, the work is not classified
as secret. Similarly, there is always the
possibility that specialized military research
and development may yield some civilian
spin-offs. However, these qualifications do
not alter the general significance of the fact
that important human resources are being
used for military purposes.
The final body of labour relevant to
category (a), workers directly engaged in
the production of weapons and other
specialized military equipment, is perhaps
the most difficult of all to estimate reliably.
Most of the available information on
defence-related employment does not clear¬
ly distinguish between direct and indirect
employment nor between specialized and
non-specialized output. On balance it would
seem that direct industrial employment
associated with the supply of specialized
military equipment world wide is about four
million.
The global estimate of the labour force
directly employed by the military for the sup¬
ply of goods and services of a specialized
character including services provided by
uniformed military personnel is therefore
about 43.5 million. This is the size of the
labour force that has to be redeployed to
economically productive work and is of im¬
mediate concern in the context of disarma¬
ment and the associated requirements for
conversion.
To this figure must be added the number
of workers in the other four categories of
defence-related employment mentioned
above. With regard to direct employment
associated with military purchases of civilian
goods and services, the data for the United
Kingdom show this to be about 50 per cent
of the direct employment from specialized
demand. Crudely extrapolating this relation¬
ship suggests a global figure of about two
million.
Industrial employment sustained indirect¬
ly by military purchases is probably 50 to 100
per cent as large as direct employment. Tak¬
ing a crude estimate of six million for total
direct industrial employment world wide it
follows that there are an additional three to
six million industrial jobs indirectly sup¬
ported by military expenditure. It should be
stressed again that the output associated
with this indirect employment will
predominantly be directed, in the event of
disarmament, toward civilian markets that
would be expanding under the impetus of
compensatory programmes.

### 48180: Military industrial production; a hundred billion dollar bill

MODERN military establishments
place procurement demands on a
wide range of industrial enter¬
prises. In some cases, these enterprises exist
solely to satisfy military demand forging
tank turrets or manufacturing artillery shells,
for example. In other cases, the industry
may supply both military and civilian
customers with quite similar products
although the military variant will often
reflect more stringent requirements as
regards quality, precision and reliability.
The military establishment also pur¬
chases a wide range of products that are
identical to those sold to civilian custo¬
mers vehicles and office equip¬
ment are examples here. In addition, of
course, all these suppliers of finished in¬
dustrial goods to the military place demands
on the suppliers of components down to the
suppliers of basic products such as
aluminium, steel and plastic.
To estimate the magnitude of global
military industrial production is no simple
task. A logical starting point is the budget
category "procurement" which is broken
out in the official statistics of most of the
major arms-producing countries. In the ma¬
jor Western arms-producing countries the
share of procurement in the military budget
falls in the range of 13 to 22 per cent.
These data, however, tend to refer to pur¬
chases of major equipment and considerably
understate the value of manufacturing out¬
put generated by military demand. The ma¬
jor omissions would appear to be production
to meet export orders, components and
spare parts and the wide variety of industrial
products that are used or consumed by the
military but are otherwise indistinguishable
from civil products. In the United States, for
Photomontages © Peter Kennard, London
example, the amounts for procurement in
the military budget for 1975 and 1976 were
$15,200 million and $16,000 million respec¬
tively, while shipments of defence products
by manufacturing industry in those years
amounted to $29,210 million and $34,000
million respectively.
For the years 1976-1977, it is possible to
document an estimate of $95,500 million for
military industrial production in the United
States of America, the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, France, the United
Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Italy, and seven smaller Western European
countries.
It is difficult to assess by how much this
figure should be inflated to yield a global
estimate. On the one hand, many countries
with substantial local defence production
are omitted, including China, Japan,
Czechoslovakia, Israel, India and Brazil. On
the other hand, the figure cited would, on
the whole, include production for export,
and the four major Powers covered by the
estimates account for the lion's share of the
international trade in arms. In other words,
to take, say, a 20 per cent share of the com¬
bined military expenditure of the rest of the
world as an estimate of military industrial
production may imply considerable double
counting.
Nevertheless, an estimate of $105,000
million for global military industrial produc¬
tion in 1976-1977 would appear quite plausi¬
ble, indeed, conservative. If one takes the
Stockholm International Peace Research In¬
stitute (SIPRI) and the United States Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA)
estimates of China's military expen¬
diture $35 thousand million to $40 thou¬
sand million in 1976 the military industrial
production in that country alone would
bring the global estimate close to $105,000
million. And there are many other countries
known to have a significant military in¬
dustrial capacity.
The estimate of $105,000 million
represents 30 per cent of world military ex¬
penditure in. 1976. This is plausible as a
global figure, bearing in mind that military
industrial production is a much broader ac¬
tivity than the procurement of major
weapons. However, to reflect the in¬
completeness of the data and the contradic¬
tory influences to which the estimaie is sub¬
ject, it would seem sensible to use a range of
28 to 32 per cent of world military expen¬
diture as an estimate of the value of in¬
dustrial production given over to military
use.
These estimates reflect the fact that the
overwhelming bulk of military industrial pro¬
duction is undertaken by the industrialized
countries. Industrial production for military
purposes in developing countries (excluding
China) would amount to less than 5 per cent
of the world total even though these coun¬
tries account for nearly one half of uniform¬
ed military personnel and about 16 per cent
of the world military expenditure. This ap¬
proximate share for the developing coun¬
tries is supported by ACDA, which
estimated the value of arms and military
equipment produced in these countries in
1979 at more than $5 thousand million. The
developing countries that have made the
most significant investment in defence in¬
dustries include Brazil, India, Israel, North
Korea, South Africa and South Korea.
Many other countries are making smaller but
determined efforts in this field.

### 48181: Raw materials: global military consumption of aluminium, copper, nickel and platinum is greater than overall demand for these minerals in Africa, Asia and Latin America combined

3
RAW MATERIALS
Global military consumption of
aluminium, copper, nickel and
platinum is greater than overall
demand for these minerals in Africa,
Asia and Latin America combined
ONE of the most striking develop¬
ments of the 1970s was the emer¬
gence of serious concern over the
availability of adequate supplies of oil and
minerals, that is non-renewable raw
materials for the support of human life and -
modern industry. Concern over supply has
come to rival the traditional focus on effec¬
tive demand as the key factor constraining
growth.
For the immediate future, the problem is
seen in terms of security of access to sup¬
plies of raw materials, not the exhaustion of
supplies pe/- se. All calculations and projec¬
tions indicate that there are ample materials
available in the earth's crust to meet the
world's needs for nearly every material
through the end of this century.
On the other hand, the end of this century
is less than twenty years away, so that real
natural scarcities are not such a distant
prospect unless one is prepared to assume
that timely discoveries of major new
reserves will be made, and that these
resources can be exploited technically and
economically.
There is considerable geographic concen¬
tration of the world's reserves of oil and
minerals: for more than a dozen industrially
important minerals the share of the three
largest reserve countries exceeds 50 per
cent. The significance of this becomes ap¬
parent when it is coupled with the fact that
the consumption of minerals is even more
highly concentrated geographically: the in¬
dustrialized market economies essentially
North America, Western Europe and
Japan consume more than two thirds of
the annual production of the nine leading
minerals. Consumption in the industrialized
Socialist countries is in the range of 20 to 25
per cent of the world total for most minerals.
The developing countries of Africa, Latin
America and Asia (including China) used
only 7 per cent of the world's aluminium
production in the period 1971-1975, 9 per
cent of the copper and 12 per cent of the
iron ore.
16
The major consuming nations have, as a
result, experienced a significant decline in
the degree of self-sufficiency in minerals.
The United States, for example, in 1950,
relied on imports for more than 50 per cent
of its requirements for just four industrially
important minerals: by 1976 the list had
grown to twenty-three minerals. Indeed, for
at least twelve minerals, United States
dependence on imports currently exceeds 80
per cent. Import dependence is even more
acute in the European Economic Communi¬
ty and in Japan, where imports provide 75
per cent or more of such critical minerals as
iron ore, nickel, copper, bauxite, chromium,
asbestos, manganese, cobalt, zinc, lead and
silver.
The anxiety over growing dependence on
imported minerals stems primarily from the
impact that a disruption of supplies would
have on the general economic health of the
consuming nation. Another major concern,
however, is the effects of this situation on a
nation's ability to wage war. There are
several dimensions to this issue, including
such negative ones as the increasingly ex¬
plicit consideration being given in recent
years to the possibility of the use of force as
a means of preserving access to needed raw
materials. The particular concern here,
however, is the magnitude of the consump¬
tion of energy and minerals for military
purposes.
The scale of global military activities sug¬
gests strongly that consumption for these
purposes is not trivial. At the same time, the
stress placed on the achievement of costly
qualitative improvements in weaponry since
the Second World War would mean that
this consumption has not increased com-
mensurately with global military expen¬
diture. Similarly, the spectacular rise in the
unit cost of weapons due to their complexity
and sophistication has contributed to a
gradual decline in the number produced.
It can also be inferred from the emphasis
on qualitative advances that the relative im
portance of iron and steel in military con¬
sumption has declined while that of
aluminium, titanium and other relatively
exotic minerals has increased. For example,
approximately 20 to 25 per cent of the
weight of current sophisticated combat air¬
craft is made up of titanium compared to 8
to 10 per cent for the models produced in
the 1950s. This metal is also beginning to be
used for the hulls of certain types of sub¬
marines. Similarly, aluminium has come into
extensive use in the superstructure of
modern naval vessels.
As a final example, the materials required
to build and deploy the 200 land-based
mobile, intercontinental ballistic missiles in¬
clude an estimated 10,000 tons of
aluminium, 2,500 tons of chromium, 150
tons of titanium, 24 tons of beryllium,
890,000 tons of steel and 2.4 million tons of
cement.
The table opposite shows our estimates of
the global consumption for military pur¬
poses of selected minerals. In order to con¬
vey some impression of the orders of
magnitude involved it can be pointed out
that, in the case of aluminium, copper,
nickel and platinum, estimated global con¬
sumption for military purposes is greater
than the demand for these minerals for all
purposes in Africa, Asia (including China)
and Latin America combined.
The final issue that warrants mention is
the consumption of petroleum for military
purposes. Petroleum is much more impor¬
tant for the military sector than for the
economy as a whole, its share being more
than three fourths of total military energy
consumption. Including indirect consump¬
tion, that is, including petroleum consumed
in the production of military goods and ser¬
vices, this has been estimated at 5 to 6 per
cent of total global consumption. Once
again the absolute magnitude involved is
very significant: 5 per cent of global
petroleum consumption is more than that
accounted for by France and close to one
half of the consumption in all the developing
countries combined (excluding China).

### 48182: Consequences of the use of nuclear weapons

CONSEQUENC
OF NUCLEA
ON 7-8 October 1981, under the chairmanship
of Professor Carlos Chagas, President of the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences, at the head¬
quarters of the Academy (Casina Pius IV, Vatican
City), a group of fourteen specialized scientists
from various parts of the world* assembled to ex¬
amine the problem of the consequences of the
use of nuclear weapons on the survival and health
of humanity.
Although most of these consequences would
appear obvious, it seems that they are not ade¬
quately appreciated. The conditions of life follow¬
ing a nuclear attack would be so severe that the
only hope for humanity is prevention of any form
of nuclear war. Universal dissemination and ac¬
ceptance of this knowledge would make it ap¬
parent that nuclear weapons must not be used at
all in warfare and that their number should be pro¬
gressively reduced in a balanced way.
The above-mentioned group discussed and
unanimously approved a number of fundamental
points, which have been further developed in the
following statement.
Recent talk about winning or even surviving a nuclear war
must reflect a failure to appreciate a medical reality: any
nuclear war would inevitably cause death, disease and suf¬
fering of pandemic proportions and without the possibility
of effective medical intervention. That reality leads to the
same conclusion physicians have reached for life-
threatening epidemics throughout history: prevention is
essential for control.
In contrast to widespread belief, much is known about the
catastrophe that would follow the use of nuclear weapons.
Much is known too about the limitations of medical
assistance. If this knowledge is presented to people and
their leaders everywhere, it might help interrupt the nuclear
arms race. This in turn would help prevent what could be the
last epidemic our civilization will know.
The devastation wrought by an atomic weapon on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki provides direct evidence of the
consequences of nuclear warfare, but there are many
theoretical appraisals on which we may also draw. Two
years ago, an assessment undertaken by a responsible of¬
ficial agency described the effect of nuclear attacks on cities
of about two million inhabitants. If a one-million-ton nuclear
weapon (the Hiroshima bomb approximated 15,000 tons of
explosive power) exploded in the central area of such cities,
it would result, as calculated, in 180 km2 of property destruc¬
tion, 250,000 fatalities and 500,000 severely injured. These
would include blast injuries, such as fractures and severe
lacerations of soft tissues, thermal injuries such as surface
burns, retinal burns and respiratory tract damage and radia¬
tion injuries, both acute radiation syndrome and delayed
effects.
Even under optimal conditions, care of such casualties
would present a medical task of unimaginable magnitude.
'Carlos Chagas, Rio de Janeiro; E. Amaldi, Rome; N. Bochkov, Moscow;
L. Caldas, Rio de Janeiro; H. Hiatt, Boston; R. Latarjet, Paris; A. Leaf,
Boston; J. Lejeune, Paris; L. Leprince-Ringuet, Paris; G.B. Marini-Bettolo,
Rome; C. Pavan, Sâo Paulo; A. Rich, Cambridge, Mass.; A. Serra, Rome;
V. Weisskopf, Cambridge, Mass.
The study projected that if 18,000 hospital beds were
available in and around one of these cities, no more than
5,000 would remain relatively undamaged. These would ac¬
commodate only 1 per cent of the human beings injured, but
it must be stressed that in any case no one could deliver the
medical service required by even a few of the severely burn¬
ed, the crushed and the radiated victims.
The hopelessness of the medical task is readily apparent if
we consider what is required for the care of the severely in¬
jured patients. We shall cite one case history, that of a
severely burned twenty-year-old man who was taken to the
burn unit of a Boston Hospital after an automobile accident
in which the gasoline tank had exploded. During his
hospitalization he received 140 litres of fresh-frozen plasma,
147 litres of fresh-frozen red blood cells, 180 millilitres of
platelets and 180 millilitres of albumin. He underwent six
operative procedures during which wounds involving 85 per
cent of his body surface were closed with various types of
grafts, including artificial skin. Throughout his hospitaliza¬
tion, he required mechanical ventilation. Despite these and
many other heroic measures, which stretched the resources
of one of the world's most comprehensive institutions, he
died on his thirty-third hospital day. His injuries were likened,
by the doctor who supervised his care to those described for

many of the victims of Hiroshima. Had twenty score of such
patients been presented at the same time to all of Boston's
hospitals the medical capabilities of the city would have
been overwhelmed. Now, consider the situation if, along
with the injuries to many thousands of people, most of the
medical emergency facilities had been destroyed.
A Japanese physician. Professor M. Ichimaru, published
an eyewitness account of the effects of the Nagasaki bomb.
He reported: "I tried to go to my medical school in Urakami
which was 500 meters from the hypocentre. I met many
people coming back from Urakami. Their clothes were in
rags and shreds of skin hung from their bodies. They looked
like ghosts with vacant stares. The next day I was able to
enter Urakami on foot and all that I knew had disappeared.
Only the concrete and iron skeletons of the buildings re¬
mained. There were dead bodies everywhere. On each street
corner, we had tubs of water used for putting out fires after
air raids. In one of these small tubs, scarcely large enough
for one person, was the body of a desperate man who
sought cool water. There was foam coming from his mouth,
but he was not alive. I cannot get rid of the sounds of the
crying women in the destroyed fields. As I got nearer to the
school there were black, charred bodies with the white
edges of bones showing in the arms and legs. When I arrived
some were still alive. They were unable to move their
bodies. The strongest were so weak that they were slumped
over on the ground. I talked with them and they thought
that they would be O. K. but all of them would eventually die
within two weeks. I cannot forget the way their eyes looked
at me and their voices spoke to me forever..."
It should be noted that the bomb dropped on Nagasaki
had a power of about 20,000 tons of TNT, not much larger
than the so-called "tactical bombs" designed for battlefield
use.
But even these grim pictures are inadequate to describe
the human disaster that would result from an attack on a
country by today's stockpiles of nuclear weapons, which
contain thousands of bombs with the force of one million
tons of TNT or greater.
The suffering of the surviving population would be
without parallel. There would be complete interruption of
communications, of food supplies and of water. Help would
be given only at the risk of mortal danger from radiation for
those venturing outside buildings in the first days. The social
disruption following such an attack would be unimaginable.
The exposure to large doses of radiation would lower im¬
munity to bacteria and viruses and could, therefore, open
the way for widespread infection. Radiation would cause ir¬
reversible brain damage and mental deficiency in many of
the exposed in utero. It would greatly increase the incidence
of many forms of cancer in survivors. Genetic damage
would be passed on to future generations, should there be
any.
In addition, large areas of soil and forests as well as
livestock, would be contaminated reducing food resources.
Many other harmful biological and even geophysical effects
would be likely, but we do not have enough knowledge to
predict with confidence what they would be.
Even a nuclear attack directed only at military facilities
would be devastating to the country as a whole. This is
because military facilities are widespread rather than con¬
centrated at only a few points. Thus, many nuclear weapons
would be exploded. Furthermore, the spread of radiation
due to the natural winds and atmospheric mixing would kill
vast numbers of people and contaminate large areas. The
medical facilities of any nation would be inadequate to care
for the survivors. An objective examination of the medical
situation that would follow a nuclear war leads to but one
conclusion: prevention is our only recourse.
The consequences of nuclear war are not, of course, only
medical in nature. But those that are compel us to pay heed
to the inescapable lesson of contemporary medicine: where
treatment of a given disease is ineffective or where costs are
insupportable, attention must be turned to prevention. Both
conditions apply to the effects of nuclear war. Treatment
would be virtually impossible and the costs would be stag¬
gering. Can any stronger argument be marshalled for a
preventive strategy?
Prevention of any disease requires an effective prescrip¬
tion. We recognize that such a prescription must both pre¬
vent nuclear war and safeguard security. Our knowledge
and credentials as scientists and physicians do not, of
course, permit us to discuss security issues with expertise.
However, if political and military leaders have based their
strategic planning on mistaken assumptions concerning the
medical aspects of nuclear war, we feel that we do have a
responsibility. We must inform them and people everywhere
of the full clinical picture that would follow a nuclear attack
and of the impotence of the medical community to offer a
meaningful response. If we remain silent, we risk betraying
ourselves and our civilization. ES

LAND
An estimated 500,000 square
kilometres used for military purposes
"Prevailing military trends suggest
that, in the aggregate, military demand
for land will continue to grow."
THE available data on the land area
used for military purposes is far too
sketchy to permit a reliable global
estimate to be made. What is almost certain,
and unsurprising, is that from the global
perspective the military use of land is quite
small, less than half of one per cent of the
total and perhaps as low as one third of one
per cent. Having said this, however, it does
not follow that the military use of land is
without consequence.
In absolute terms, the military sector still
occupies much land: countries with a land
area in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of the
world total include France, Morocco,
Paraguay, Sweden and Thailand. Moreover,
there are vast areas of land in the world that
are of no more interest to the military than to
other land-users. In other words, despite its
small relative demand, the military can and
often does compete directly with civilian
demands be they urban, industrial,
agricultural, recreational or based on en¬
vironmental concerns.
20
Military requirements for land have risen
steadily over the course of this century ow¬
ing to the increase in the size of standing
armed forces and, more particularly, the
rapid pace of technological advances in
weaponry. As armed forces became pro¬
gressively more mechanized and as the
range and speed of weapons increased, so
did the land area required for purposes of
training and manoeuvres.
For example, exercises involving a full ar¬
moured division are considered by the
United States Army to require an area of at
least 235 square kilometres with up to 664
square kilometres being desirable for max¬
imum benefit. Air Forces require much
larger areas still, owing to the high speed of
modern combat aircraft and the con¬
siderable range capabilities of air-to-surface
munitions.
Finally, of course, the areas used to test
nuclear weapons cannot be too large. One
could add here that, owing to considera¬
tions both of safety and security, military
land requirements usually tend to be deter¬
mined quite liberally.
Prevailing military trends suggest that, in
the aggregate, military demand for land will
continue to grow. Many countries in all
parts of the world are increasing the size of
their armed forces. Similarly, the number of
countries operating battle tanks, modern
combat aircraft and missiles of all varieties is
growing continuously. So too is the number
of countries setting out to manufacture and,
in some cases, to design and develop
modern weaponry.
All of these trends imply growing land re¬
quirements for training, maneuvres and
weapon-testing. Furthermore, as the ac¬
curacy of offensive weapons improves,
there is greater incentive to give deployed
weapons greater mobility, and to set aside
larger areas of land for them to manoeuvre
in. The deployment mode currently under
consideration in the United States for the
MX system involves an area of nearly 15,600
square kilometres. The Soviet Union already

### 48183: Land: an estimated 500,000 square kilometres used for military purposes

has land-mobile intermediate-range nuclear
missile systems that presumably have com¬
parable designated areas that are off-limits
to civilians.
On the whole, the economic significance
of the diversion of land to military use is con¬
siderably higher than the fraction of the total
land used for this purpose might suggest.
The amount of land in the world is nearly
constant, but demand is growing relent¬
lessly on every front: croplands, grazing
lands, forests, urbanization and ground
transportation networks..
The amount of arable land in the world
has in fact been increased by some 15 per
cent over the past thirty years. It is
reasonable to assume, however, that this
has been accomplished to some extent at
the expense of grazing land and forests and,
to the degree that this is the case, it is not a
viable alternative in the long run. Moreover,
it is also the case that large areas of produc¬
tive land are lost each year for such reasons
as over-exploitation, desertification and
salination. The restoration of these areas is a
costly and time-consuming process.
In other words, the context in which the
military use of land must be considered is
one that recognizes that such use is totally
unproductive and that it is frequently com¬
petitive with intensifying demands from the
civilian sector. Perhaps the most disturbing
aspect of the military use of land for future
civilian use is that the land is seriously
degraded, often for an extended period. In
some cases, such as nuclear-weapon-test
areas particularly, of course, the areas
where atmospheric tests have been con¬
ducted land will be totally unfit for
civilian use for an indefinite period.
Moreover, the effects of atmospheric
nuclear tests cannot be contained within the
designated test area. Even with
underground testing, accidents and
miscalculations have occurred and have
resulted in adverse effects beyond the test
area. Training areas that see the large-scale
use of tracked armoured vehicles become

quite vulnerable to erosion through the
destruction of vegetation and loosening of
the topsoil. Artillery and bombing ranges are
transformed into a mosaic of craters that are
difficult to fill and remain unproductive for
years, even if this happens owing to the
absence of the fertile layer of topsoil. If the
craters remain, they impede the use of
agricultural machinery. Unexplored muni¬
tions constitute another long-term hazard.
Actual warfare, of course, results in all these
effects on a hugely magnified scale.

### 48185: Research and development; twenty per cent of the world's scientists and engineers were engaged in military work during the 1970s

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT
Twenty per cent of the world's
scientists and engineers were
engaged in military work during
the 1970s
ONE of the most conspicuous features
of the military scene since the
Second World War has been the
extraordinarily rapid rate of change in
weapons technology.
For the past thirty years, new and improv¬
ed weapons have emerged at an un¬
manageably rapid rate, compounding suspi¬
cions and uncertainties and creating in
States, particularly the major Powers, a
degree of preoccupation with military mat¬
ters that is probably unprecedented. All too
often technology has raced ahead of
strategy and tactics. Similarly, the tech¬
nological arms race has complicated the
process of political assessment and efforts
to control the race through negotiation.
In virtually all categories of major
weapons a completely new model comes
along every five to eight years, with an in¬
tervening period characterized by the con¬
tinuous refinement and modification of the
earlier model (or models). Moreover, the
range of types of weapons in which this pro¬
cess occurs has expanded continuously as
technological developments have made con¬
ceptually new weapons possible or permit¬
ted greater functional specialization. SIPRI
estimates of the research and development
input per unit of output in the military and
civilian sectors in the United States of
America, the United Kingdom and the
Federal Republic of Germnay, suggest that,
at present, the average military product is
some twenty times as research-intensive as
the average civil product.
These indications of the relative intensity
of the military research and development ef¬
fort are fully borne out by what is known or
can reasonably be surmised about the global
magnitude of this effort. Global expen¬
ditures on militan/ research and develop¬
ment in 1980 were of the approximate order
of $35,000 million or approximately one
quarter of the estimated $150,000 million ex¬
pended for all research and development.
Twenty years earlier, in 1960, global
military research and development
amounted to about $13,000 million but ac¬
counted for a significantly larger fraction of
all research and development. This can be
deduced from the fact that six coun¬
tries United States, the Soviet Union,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan,
France and the United Kingdom ac¬
counted for about 85 per cent of the world's
research and development, and in five of
these (all except the Soviet Union), it is
known that the military share in total
22
research and development was significantly
higher in 1960 than it is today.
Military research and development expen¬
diture is even more highly concentrated than
total research and development; just two
countries, the United States and the Soviet
Union, account for a similar share of military
research and development. Adding France
and Britain would push this fraction above
90 per cent.
Information on the number of scientists
and engineers in military research and
development is even more sketchy than the
financial data. The most recent survey of
global research and development suggest
that 2,279,000 scientists and engineers were
thus employed in 1973. The best known
estimate of the number engaged in military
research and development is the SIPRI
figure of 400,000 for the early 1970s. More
recently it has been suggested that over
500,000 scientists and engineers are engag¬
ed in military research and development. In
other words, approximately 20 per cent of
the world's qualified scientists and
engineers were engaged in military work
during the 1970s. As with expenditure, this
share would have been significantly higher
during the 1960s and perhaps even higher
still during the latter part of the 1950s.
It should be recalled that a 1972 United
Nations study. Disarmament and Develop¬
ment, gives the share of military research
and development as 40 per cent of expen¬
ditures ($25 thousand million out of $60
thousand million). As this figure, or even
higher figures, are widely quoted in the
public debate, it might be useful to stress
that the most recent estimates point to a
share of resources used for military research
and development of the order of 20 to 25
per cent as regards both manpower and
expenditure.
Even so the absolute magnitude of expen¬
ditures for military research and develop¬
ment is extremely large and it remains by far
the largest single objective of scientific in¬
quiry and technological development.
If a more accurate accounting were possi¬
ble, the figures presented above would
almost certainly appear conservative. For
example, much of the expenditure on space
activities in the United States and the Soviet
Union has direct or strongly indirect military
utility and is undoubtedly undertaken
primarily for this purpose. More than
$10,000 million is spent on "non-military"
space activities each year by these countries
and others.
It is important to view military research
and development with some perspective.
The stock of knowledge at any given point
in time is the direct result of the research
and development effort over the preceding
decades and, indirectly, of this effort over
the preceding centuries. It is likely that the
present stock of useful knowledge is much
less than it might have been had we not pur¬
sued the arms race so enthusiastically.
It is true that several technological
developments of major significance for
civilian life were brought to fruition at an
early date because of their perceived military
utility. This does not mean, of course, that
progress in these spheres would have been
slower in the absence of military research
and development. It is possible that without
the latter the requisite advances in the
economic and social spheres could have
been achieved more efficiently. An assess¬
ment of how far the development of the
stock of really useful knowledge has been
promoted or held back by the carrying-out
of military research and development would
require a special study, the conclusions of
which would rest more on hypotheses than
empirical evidence.
. It has been suggested that military
demands have been largely responsible for
the rapid increase in the resources devoted
to research and development generally so
that even the magnitude of the civilian ef¬
forts might be jeopardized by a process of
disarmament and the reduction of tensions.
This view might have some validity if the
economic and social state of the world was
robust and no significant future problems
could be identified, but it couid hardly be
said that there is now a shortage of possible
civilian projects on which defence R and D
scientists could be re-employed.
On a more positive note, it must be
acknowledged that the military pioneered
and perfected the systems approach on
research and development. This has im¬
parted a degree of predictability to
the accomplishment of scientific and
technological advances unknown before the
Second World War.
For these various reasons, we can state
with some confidence that the stock of
useful knowledge and technology in the
year 2000 will be immeasurably enlarged if
we succeed in diverting to civilian ends a
considerable fraction of the funds and man¬
power now programmed to work in the
military field.

MILITARY EXPENDITURES
In 1980, 110 dollars for every man,
woman and child on earth
WORLD military expenditure in 1980,
at current prices, amounted to
$500,000 million or approximately
$110 for every man, woman and child on
earth. Per capita military expenditure in the
developed countries taken as a group is an
order of magnitude higher than that in the
developing countries but, because the
disparities in overall income per capita are
even greater, the real burden of these
expenditures is heavier in developing
countries.
The global military effort represents about
6 per cent of global output, roughly the
same fraction as accounted for by the 340
million people living in Latin America or the
1,300 million people living in Africa and
South Asia.
Global public expenditure for education
has only recently overtaken military expen¬
diture, although if the developing countries
alone are considered the latter is still
predominant. Global public expenditure on
health remains considerably below military
expenditure and, again, the asymmetry is
particularly marked in the developing coun¬
tries as a group. The global arms bill is
roughly equivalent to the value of gross fix¬
ed capital formation in all developing coun¬
tries combined. If one combines regular and
paramilitary forces, there are still far more
people wearing military uniforms world wide
than there are teachers.
Military objectives remain by far the most
important single purpose of the world's
research and development effort, eclipsing,
for example, energy, health, pollution con¬
trol and agriculture combined. Indeed, it ap¬
pears that global military research and
development is at least six times as great as
all research and development performed in
the developing countries.
World military expenditure over the post¬
war, period has moved up in spasms follow¬
ed by a period of relative stability on a new
and higher plateau. In the past, each up¬
ward surge was closely associated with a
war or a major international crisis or the
perception of a serious asymmetry in
strategic nuclear capabilities. The present
upward trend is not associated with a
specific event. Rather, it appears to reflect a
widespread perception that circumstances
in general justify a gradual but sustained in¬
crease in military efforts. In this sense, the
latest upswing may prove more difficult to
reverse since there is no major war that can
be brought to an end, no single crisis that
can be defused and no particular gap in
relative capabilities that can be bridged.
The distribution of global military expen¬
diture remains very uneven although some
notable changes have occurred over the^

wars over the past decade and an intensify¬
ing confrontation between the Black African
States and South Africa. While these
various qualifications are important, the
central fact remains that the distribution of
world military expenditure has been chang¬
ing in a quite systematic manner over the
past twenty-five years. In all the major
regions of the world, the average rate of
growth of military expenditure has at least
equalled, and, in most cases exceeded, that
of NATO and WTO combined.
Bearing in mind that governments in all
countries (particularly, perhaps, developing
countries), bear a major responsibility for
providing the basic prerequisites for
economic activity, these percentages are
significantly large. By 1977, the situation
had improved markedly compared to 1968,
but it is worth pointing out that the effects
of relatively greater diversion of government
resources to the military in the past are still
being felt today, in terms of education,
health, housing, transportation networks
and so on.

SWORDS
INTO PLOWSHARES
On the key issue of employment
virtually all possible alternatives
to military expenditure will result
in as many, if not more,
jobs being created
THE terms conversion and redeploy¬
ment describe the process of change
whereby real human and material
resources shift from the production of one
set of goods and services to the production
of another.
The specific concern here is the shift of
resources from the production of com¬
modities and services for military purposes
to goods and services that can contribute to
economic and social development. More
particularly, we are concerned with con¬
version and redeployment of the resources
involved in the production of commodities
used or consumed by the military and which
have little or no civilian utility.
A significant part of military demand is
directed at goods and services that are
essentially identical to those consumed in
the civilian sector. In this case, thé problem
is the relatively minor one of ensuring that
civilian demand fills the gap left by cutbacks
in military spending.
This is not the case with nuclear and
chemical weapons, combat aircraft,
missiles, warships, tanks and so on. The
resources involved in producing these items
are likely, in varying degrees, to be unsuited
for the production of civilian goods, so that
explicit consideration must be given to the
ways in which their capabilities can be
altered to permit* the smoothest possible
transition to the production of socially useful
goods and services.
Conversion and redeployment are not
associated exclusively with disarmament.
Any form of economic and social develop¬
ment represents a continuous process of
conversion. Particularly in modern industrial
economies, the factors of production must
respond continuously to the development of
new products and the phasing-out of old
ones and to the introduction of new produc¬
tion techniques. Indeed, the pace of
technological change and the extraordinary
mobility of capital in recent decades have led
most countries to undertake measures to
facilitate necessary changes in the structure
of industry and to adopt legislation to pro-
26
vide some protection for workers affected
by such changes.
The point to be stressed is that modern in¬
dustrial economies including, in particular,
the economies with the largest military
establishments, have a considerable inbuilt
capacity to convert resources from one ac¬
tivity to another. Furthermore, any process
of conversion and redeployment associated
with disarmament measures, if developed in
the context of even more far-reaching struc¬
tural adjustments and modifications of na¬
tional economies and of the international
economic system, could be productively in¬
tegrated into these wider changes.
Setting the problems of conversion in a
wider perspective, it is important to bear in
mind that the process of disarmament is
almost certain to be quite gradual. In other
words it is not at all realistic to portray the
conversion problem as involving, in a single
step, the need to replace $500 thousand
million of demand or absorb tens of millions
of persons into the civilian work-force.
In practical terms, the scale of the conver¬
sion problem stemming from disarmament
measures will be orders of magnitude
smaller than this at any given point in the
process. Indeed, it is far more likely that the
rate of disarmament agreed upon will lag
behind conversion capabilities or, to state
the matter less pessimistically, there should
be no difficulty in gearing the rate of disar¬
mament to the rate at which the resources
involved can move smoothly to alternative
activities.
Most general investigations of the conver¬
sion issue take as their starting-point the ex¬
traordinary success of demobilization
following the Second World War.
In the United States between 1945 and
1948, some ten million persons were releas¬
ed from the armed forces and the defence
budget declined by nearly $40 thousand
million. Similarly, defence-related employ¬
ment in industry fell from over twelve million
persons in 1945 to less than one million in
1946.
In the United Kingdom, seven million per¬
sons were demobilized within sixteen
months to the end of the war. In neither
country, however, did unemployment in the
immediate post-war years exceed 4 per cent.
The experience in the Soviet Union was
similarly positive.
It is true, of course, that the particular cir¬
cumstances prevailing at the end of the war
contributed enormously to the success of
the conversion effort. In the Soviet Union
and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom,
the rebuilding of war-damaged towns and
industries provided a major outlet for the
production capacities released by
demobilization. In the United States and
also in the United Kingdom, a surge in con¬
sumer demand produced by years of
relative deprivation and accumulated sav¬
ings a major role in sustaining ag¬
gregate demand.
From the industrial standpoint, another
important consideration is that for most
plants and factories the problem was that of
reconverting to the civilian products produc¬
ed before the war. While these conditions
undoubtedly facilitated post-war conver¬
sion, the fact remains that an enormous
economic adjustment was accomplished far
more smoothly than most experts had con¬
sidered possible. Of particular importance in
this regard is that the anticipation of major
problems led to detailed planning of the
measures needed to accomplish the transi- .
tion from war to peace. This process began
well before the end of the war and is con- .
sidered by some to have made a major con¬
tribution to the success of the conversion
process.
In the Soviet Union, the first post-war
economic plan appeared within six months
of the termination of hostilities. And in the
United States, the Government was ready
with an array of . remedies including
graduated demobilization, specific incen¬
tives for the mass production of consumer
durables, low interest rates to encourage
spending and generous adult education
programmes.

! As regards the overall feasibility of con¬
verting resources from the production of
military goods to civilian goods, the ex¬
perience immediately following the Second
World War is clearly very encouraging.
Moreover, the manner in which the conver¬
sion was accomplished merits a more detail¬
ed reassessment than has been made to
date.
It does not follow, however, that States
with large armed forces and significant
military industries can afford to adopt a
sanguine attitude toward the conversion
problems that arms control and disarma¬
ment measures will raise. The characteristics
of the military sector have changed pro¬
foundly since 1945. Military technology, and
therefore military industry, have diverged
quite sharply from civilian technology and
industry. The major military powers have
significant human and material resources
more or less exclusively specialized in fulfill¬
ing military requirements and which have
never been deployed in the civilian field.
Bearing these considerations in mind, one
can attempt to list the characteristics of
defence industries from the standpoint of
the problems that they would encounter if
conversion to non-military production
became necessary. As regards labour, the
emphasis on quality and performance in
specialized branches of the military sector
has led to the acquisition of skills and, more
particularly, to the adoption of attitudes
toward design and production that would be
out of place in most commercial fields where
high production rates and increased efficien¬
cy compete with quality as goals. This ap¬
plies especially to the scientific and
engineering labour that constitute a large
fraction of the military industrial work-force.
The skills required of the management
personnel of military industrial enterprises
are also unique to this field. On the one
hand, few if any production activities in the
commercial field rival the military sector in
terms of the technical complexity of the pro¬
duct and the number of suppliers of parts
and components involved. The experience
that the prime military contractors have ac¬
cumulated in systems management is one of
the main reasons why Governments in the
major Western arms-producing countries
are so reluctant to see any of these concerns
go under. On the other hand, dealing with
the Government as a buyer is a unique
challenge in marketing, requires the adop¬
tion of special accounting procedures and
conforming in general with government
regulations.
Secondly, much of the capital equipment
used in some branches of defence produc¬
tion is highly specialized and lacks the flex¬
ibility for application to civilian output. In
sharp contrast to the Second World War,
when civilian industry undertook to produce
war material and then reconverted to pro¬
duction for the commercial market, the pre
sent situation is the product of a thirty-year
period during which military and civil
technologies evolved partly on separate and
divergent paths. A proportion of military in¬
dustrial production takes place in facilities
that are used exclusively for this purpose.
Apart from the fact that a massive and
sustained military R and D effort has yielded
military industrial capacities that operate on
a technological plateau considerably higher
than the bulk of civilian industry, extremely
demanding (or just different) military stan¬
dards and specifications and the desire to
have capacity available for mobilization also
contribute to the separation of military from
civilian industry. One of the more con¬
spicuous results of this is that the defence
industry tends to have much excess capacity
ranging, in the United States, from over 90
per cent in the munitions industry to bet¬
ween 30 per cent and 50 per cent in most
other branches.
Several other features of the defence in¬
dustry tend to make the companies or enter¬
prises involved apprehensive about disarma¬
ment measures and the prospect of having
to convert to civilian production. For
example, most defence-work is paid for on a
continuous basis providing a very favourable
cash-flow situation, particularly for finan¬
cially weak companies. Similarly, companies
accustomed to performing low-risk military
R and D will be understandably nervous at
the prospect of committing their own
resources to the development and produc¬
tion of commodities for the uncertain and
competitive civilian market.
These concerns will be amplified by the
fact that companies specializing in military
work will have legitimate fears regarding
their competitiveness in the civilian sphere
owing to large overhead costs because the
work-force is dominated by managerial,
scientific and engineering personnel and
because they lack skill or experience in the
marketing of civil products. Furthermore,
given the financial magnitude of military
contracts and the long periods involved in
development and production, the major
contractors will, at any given point, have a
substantial backlog of military work for both
national and foreign military forces to com¬
plicate the process of conversion to non-
military work.
Finally, there ¡s"me question of profit. The
evidence here is inconclusive: depending on
how the rate of profit is computed, whether
this is done for large or small defence con¬
tractors and for prime contractors or sub¬
contractors, it is possible to show that the
rate of profit in military industry is both high
and low compared to civilian industry.
On the other hand, once a military con¬
tract has been secured the rate of profit is at
least fairly certain owing to cost-plus pric¬
ing. Moreover, the magnitude of the profit
that can be earned on a single military con¬
tract is often very large indeed and this can
serve important corporate objectives even if
the rate of profit is relatively low. It can also
be mentioned that, at least in the United
States, foreign militan/ sales are significantly
more profitable than domestic sales.
It is clear that these various characteristics
will be present to varying degrees depending
on where military industry is located. Pro¬
fits, for example, are not a significant force
in the Soviet Union, motivating industrial
concerns to enter or to remain in the military
sector. Similarly, the managers of Soviet
military industrial enterprises will not be con¬
cerned at their lack of experience in
marketing civil productions, since this func¬
tion would be performed by the central plan¬
ning authorities. On the other hand, the
evidence suggests that, owing to the high
priority accorded to defence, managerial
personnel in the Soviet military industrial
sector are relatively insulated from the
foremost managerial problem in the rest of
the economy, namely, securing the supply
of needed personnel and materials.
As regards the retraining of labour, it is
often assumed that the workers engaged in
the development and production of modern
sophisticated weapon systems possess
uniquely specialized qualifications and skills.
In fact, the professional skills needed in this
field are linked in most cases with produc¬
tion techniques that are identical or com¬
parable with those for civil products. Some
reorientation and retraining may be required
for certain specialized occupations and
skills, particularly in respect of R and D
personnel.
Informed judgement in the Soviet Union
suggests that retraining for a period of up to
one year for scientists and up to two years
for certain engineers is needed for a suc¬
cessful transition to civilian work. An addi¬
tional problem is that a significant part of the
stock of knowledge possessed by scientists
and engineers in certain specialized
branches of the military sector is classified
and would be wasted unless restrictions on
its use were lifted.
The conversion of uniformed military per¬
sonnel is a separate problem, both quan¬
titatively and qualitatively. Since the global
figure for personnel in the armed forces is at
least twenty-five million, even agreement on
modest force-level reductions could involve
the demobilization of millions of persons.
Furthermore, since the civilian economy, to
a reasonable approximation, already pro¬
vides for the consumption needs of military
personnel, their demobilization will con¬
stitute an addition to the labour market.
Reference has been made above to the
wide variety and growing level of skills re¬
quired of military personnel. In broad terms,
this will clearly ease the transition to civilian
work, but the available evidence suggests
that significant problems can still be an¬
ticipated. In the late 1960s, it was estimated
that 80 per cent of the military jobs held by
enlisted men in the United States armed
forces corresponded to only about 10 per
cent of those held by male civilian workers.
This fact, of course, suggests that voca¬
tional and educational training prior to

demobilization will play a major role in eas¬
ing the transition. Similarly, it will obviously
be advantageous to ensure at least an ap¬
proximate correspondence between the
skills acquired before demobilization and
employment opportunities in the civilian
economy. And since the latter will be in¬
fluenced by the conversion strategies im¬
plemented in the military industrial sector, it
will be necessary to co-ordinate and in¬
tegrate the conversion measures adopted in
the various parts of the military sector.
Specialized capital equipment presents
less of a problem. Where such equipment is
owned by private concerns a variety of in¬
direct measures can be adopted to make it
attractive for them to divest themselves of
this equipment and by the State quite direct
measures can be used.
Since it is quite unrealistic, at least for an
extended interim period, to expect States to
totally demolish their military industrial
capabilities, it would be highly desirable to
reduce the gap between military and civilian
industrial requirements. If military and civil
production took place side by side at the
plant level, all dimensions of the conversion
problem would be minimized. To ac¬
complish this, it would be necessary to curb
the military appetite for performance and
technological excellence which, in itself,
would make an enormous contribution to
slowing down the arms race and facilitate
the achievement of arms control and disar¬
mament measures.
Primary responsibility for conversion, in
an overall sense, will inevitably fall on central
governments. This follows from the nature
of the relationship between the Government
and the military sector and is particularly
true with regard to initiating prepara¬
tions for a conversion process. The Govern¬
ment should take the lead, but the process

nature and probable magnitude of the ad¬
justment problems and devising measures

"Modern industrial economies, including in particular the
economies with the largest military establishments, have a
considerable inbuilt capacity to convert resources from
one activity to another."
and arrangements to overcome them would
be a joint endeavour with industry, trade
unions and officials in the most military-
dependent regions and communities.
Governments in all countries can be
broadly confident at least over the medium
and long terms in their capacity to play a
major role in maintaining the general level of
economic activity in the event of significant
reductions in military expenditure. On the
key issue of employment, there is, as we
have seen, persuasive evidence that virtually
all possible alternatives to military expen¬
diture and production will result in at least as
many and, in most cases, more jobs being
created. In planned economies, of course,
the government has direct and comprehen¬
sive authority to accomplish this, and in
market economies there exists a diversified
arsenal of fiscal and monetary measures to
complement the market system.
In all cases, however, the Government
must carefully dovetail disarmament with
the time required to accomplish the conver¬
sion of the resources thus released so as not
to overtax adjustment capabilities. The basic
considerations determining the transition
period are identifying new markets, develop¬
ing new products, retooling to produce
them and retraining management and pro¬
duction workers.
In market economy countries, an addi¬
tional important consideration will be the
timing of compensatory fiscal and monetary
policies to ensure that the stimulating ef¬
fects coincide with military cutbacks. While
the mix of compensatory programmes is of
little consequence in the long run, it is very
important in the short run owing to the vary¬
ing time lags associated with different
measures. For example, increases in non-
military government spending will have
direct and immediate effects while the full
effects of a tax cut will not be felt for several
years.
It is a widely held belief that the oppor¬
tunity to apply science and technology more
directly and systematically to economic and
social problems is the most significant divi¬
dend that disarmament would bring. A na¬
tion's military, scientific and technical
resources comprise manpower (scientists,
engineers, technicians and technical
management), facilities and equipment, and
scientific and technical information. Each of
these components requires separate atten¬
tion for conversion purposes.
The formulation of a national science
policy that reflects economic and social
priorities both domestically and interna¬
tionally would be extremely useful in order
to give direction and focus to the conversion
effort. The specific requirements for adap¬
ting personnel in military R and D will vary
considerably among and within the different
categories of personnel involved. Determin¬
ing the probable requirements for retraining,
re-education and redeployment will require
detailed knowledge of the composition of
the military R and D community. Thought
must be given to how and where retraining
and re-education is to be done and who
would pay for it.

SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES
As regards facilities and equipment, it
would be necessary to compile a detailed na¬
tional inventory as a basis on which to
assess its adaptability to civilian R and D.
Similarly, the stock of military, scientific and
technical information can be declassified
and systematically canvassed for possible
civilian applications. An important com¬
plementary measure would be to encourage
civilian industry to be more receptive to R
and D. This could boost productivity and
also generate a demand for management
personnel with knowledge and experience in
the effective use of R and D resources, that
is, the type of management personnel
employed in disproportionately large
numbers in the defence industry.
The ambition and the need to make
science and technology more responsive to
economic and social requirements will not
be realized in a straightforward fashion. It is
true that such sectors as civil aerospace,
research into alternative sources of energy,
further development of nuclear energy
technologies so as' to make them safer for
civilian use, or the design of remotely-
controlled underwater devices for the ex¬
traction of raw materials are similar to the
highly specialized technologies in some
areas of the armaments sector.
On the other hand, such issues as coping
with pollution, improving the effectiveness
and availability of education and increasing
agricultural productivity in the developing
countries are enormously different from and
far more complex than the technical
problems confronted in transporting a man
to the moon or delivering a nuclear war¬
head accurately to a target 8,000 kilometres
away.
It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that
we are still quite ignorant as to how to apply
R and D resources to such problems.
Developing new methods, techniques and
approaches for effectively applying scientific
and technical resources to the resolution of
economic and social problems will require a
great deal of thought and experiment.
The general approach to conversion
outlined with regard to military R and D can
also be applied to military industry. The first
order of business is to determine as ac¬
curately as possible which industries in
which locations depend to a significant
degree on military demand, the
characteristics of the work-force involved
and the type of plant and equipment used.
Where plant, equipment and man¬
power by implication, the pro¬
duct not unduly specialized for military
purposes, the Government can determine
whether general compensatory monetary
and fiscal policy, together with market
forces, will suffice to maintain demand and
employment or whether more specific
measures would be desirable. Input-output
models can be employed to anticipate the
extent to which the pattern of demand
associated with compensatory policies
might differ from that associated with
military outlays. Where the mismatch is
significant, more industry-specific measures
could be prepared for possible implementa¬
tion.
At the other extreme represented by the
munition plans and the prime military con¬
tractors in aerospace, electronics and ship¬
building problems are rather for¬
midable. The Government, in conjunction
with management and unions in the in¬
dustry, must determine what alternative
uses for these resources are feasible and
desirable, with the feasible alternatives
clearly more important in the short run.
Once these strategic judgements have been
"It is a widely held belief that the
opportunity to apply science and
technology more directly and
systematically to economic and social
problems is the most significant
dividend that disarmament would bring.

### 48187: Swords into plowshares; on the key issue of employment virtually all possible alternatives to military expenditure will result in as many, if not more jobs being created

made, the requirements for retraining, re¬
education and redeployment can be gauged
and programmes developed to satisfy them.
Similarly, the data base and a broad strategy
for the alternative use of military industrial
resources are essential elements for deter¬
mining the nature, extent and duration of
specific measures tax concessions, invest¬
ment incentives and the like needed to ac¬
complish the transition.
At least in market economies, the State
would not have to concern itself with speci¬
fying alternative products in any detail or
determining how they will be manufactured.
Nor should it attempt to do so. Its role
should be to guide and facilitate conversion
and to alleviate the hardships imposed on
the manpower resources displaced in the
process.
Nevertheless, to perform this role effec¬
tively the State must be well informed of the
difficulties associated with developing and
producing a new product and the time re¬
quired to accomplish it. Similarly, it must be
prepared to eliminate any unreasonable bar¬
riers to entry to the civilian markets that the
former suppliers of military equipment hope
to penetrate. It should be stressed again,
however, that this central dimension of the
conversion issue the resources directly
employed in meeting the military demand for
specialized goods and services is not over¬
whelmingly large even in the most heavily
armed States. Moreover, a process of disar¬
mament will be gradual rather than abrupt
and this will further diminish the magnitude
of the problem at any particular time.
One question that will have to be con¬
sidered with particular care is whether the
prime military contractors can convert to
civilian production and still retain broadly
the same structure. It was pointed out
above that these concerns have developed
unique capabilities in scientific and systems
management, that their work-force is
markedly top heavy with scientists,
engineers and technical management per¬
sonnel and that their marketing skills are
oriented exclusively toward government
procurement.
Some analysts feel that conversion to
civilian production will probably require that
these large-scale units be broken up.
Others, however, while granting the need
to change habits and attitudes acquired in
the military environment, argue that many
important requirements in the civilian arena
closely resemble large military projects in
terms of scientific and technical input and
requirements for strong capabilities in
systems management. Examples here would
include new sources of energy, exploiting
the resources of the ocean, environmental
protection and new systems for major cities
in such areas as transportation and sanita¬
tion.
A particularly interesting aspect of con¬
version is that related to the resources now
devoted to the development and production
of chemical warfare agents. Efforts are now
being made to permit negotiations' to begin
on a convention that would prohibit the
development, production, deployment and
stockpiling of chemical weapons and the
secure destruction of such stockpiles.
A recent study by the Stockholm Interna¬
tional Peace Research Institute concluded
that conversion was technically feasible and
would involve little or no disturbance for the
work-force involved. On the one .hand, it is
considered technically feasible to break
down stockpiled chemical warfare agents in¬
to their base materials and intermediate pro¬
ducts and apply these to products useable
for civilian purposes. Moreover, this process
requires the same specially skilled scientific
and technical personnel as are needed for
the production of chemical warfare agents.
On the other hand, it is quite feasible to pro¬
duce commercial products such as
pesticides, plasticizers and fire retardants in
plants producing chemical warfare agents.
Ironically, the very ease of conversion is a
serious drawback in this case because it
would be relatively easy to rededicate the
facility to agent production. Unless there
were to be a breakthrough on the question
of on-site inspection, verification of com¬
pliance with a chemical warfare convention
would probably require that the facilities be
shut down and broken up.
Given the almost universal judgement
that, with appropriate preparation and plan¬
ning, the transitional problems associated
with conversion can be readily accom¬
modated and bearing in mind that disarma¬
ment will almost certainly be a selective and
gradual process, it should be apparent that
the industrialized countries, including, in
particular, the major military powers, do not
lack important civilian uses for the resources
now dedicated to the military.

SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES
It will be recalled that the developing
countries still account for only about 16 per
cent of global military expenditure and that
this sum is heavily concentrated in a relative¬
ly small number of countries, particularly
those in the Middle East region. With a few
important exceptions, R and D for military
purposes ¡s_ negligible. The production and
assembly of major weapons is considerably
more widespread but, again, the scale of the
effort is significant in only a few countries.
By and large, the labour employed in the
militan/ sector will not be exclusively
specialized in military work, and technology
in military industry will not be so far remov¬
ed from civilian industrial technology. It is
true that industry in the developing coun¬
tries is generally narrowly based and less
dynamic than in developed countries so that
the inherent capacity for adjustment and
conversion is lower. On the whole,
however, the problems associated with con¬
version would seem to be relatively small in
all but a few developing countries and the
benefits from disarmament easier to realize.
The military expenditures of the develop¬
ing countries, which stood at some $73,000
million in 1980, are by no means inconse¬
quential. Moreover, the alternative uses to
which these resources might be applied are
particularly compelling so that, as in the in¬
dustrialized countries, governments will
have to consider very carefully how the op¬
portunities opened up by disarmament
measures can be exploited to alleviate the
burden of the most urgent economic and
social problems and to help set the economy
on a sounder and more independent
footing.
In many developing countries, substantial
disarmament would significantly ease
prevailing financial constraints on the im¬
plementation of development plans. The
reduction in the import of arms and spare
parts and of capital goods and intermediate
products for local military production would
release foreign exchange to alleviate bottle-
If the nations were to place "their
awareness of a shared future above
their short-term ambitions and
individual interests, the tremendous
scientific and technological potential
of the world could then be used more
often to serve peaceful ends, promote
the common welfare of mankind and
help to forge relations based on justice
and a sense of solidarity."
necks in the programmes for industrializa¬
tion and the expansion of agricultural pro¬
duction. The armed forces, the military
bureaucracy^and personnel in defence in¬
dustries would provide a pool from which to
reduce shortages of various types of skilled
labour and of managerial personnel.
Moreover, the diversion to the military of
able-bodied, educated and skilled man¬
power from schools, universities and
technical institutions could be minimized.
Reducing the incidence of hunger and
malnutrition will clearly be a priority claim
on the resources released by disarmament
measures both in the short term and the
longer term. Education and health are two
more areas which require vast resources
even to make basic services and amenities
available to all.
Under present conditions, many develop¬
ing countries are projected to become more
dependent on impoited food over the next
two decades. This is a serious hazard, both
because the global balance between supply
and demand could easily become delicate
and because the real cost of food will almost
certainly increase substantially so that major
food import requirements will constitute an
even heavier drain on foreign exchange
reserves and, indirectly, on the capacity to
sustain growth.
There are a variety of research and
development challenges in this field: the
development of high-yielding varieties of
staple food for the diverse soil and climatic
conditions found in developing countries,
pest control, methods of food storage and
processing suited to local conditions; water
management and irrigation technologies;
and tools and equipment that use local raw
materials, can be produced domestically
with low acquisition, operating and
maintenance costs.
Recent advances in molecular biology
hold particular promise for food-deficit
developing countries. It is now considered
possible to produce protein from bacteria
and algae far more quickly and at con¬
siderably less cost than from animal and
agricultural sources. It remains to translate
this knowledge into facilities and processes
suitable for application in developing coun¬
tries. A recent investigation concluded that
"... advances in enzyme engineering,
microbial genetics and fermentation
technology... point at new approaches to
the development of small-scale processes
that could form a logical take-off point for
industrialization."
Two other areas in which the needs of the
developing countries are very great and
which offer considerable potential for the
conversion of military R and D resources are
health and education. For a variety of
reasons, including, until recently, preparing
for the possible use of biological weapons in
warfare, the military in the industrialized
countries have paid a great deal of attention
to infectious diseases, food hygiene and the
management of water and waste under field
conditions. The knowledge acquired and the
preventive capabilities developed have
potentially great applications in improving
health conditions in developing countries.
It has also been suggested that military
capabilities in the biological sciences could
be readily applied to the fight against infec¬
tious diseases, particularly those in
childhood, with military skills in organization
and logistic planning providing essential
backup to ensure the systematic and effec¬
tive implementation of remedies. As men¬
tioned previously, modern communication
technologies and new media techniques of¬
fer great potential for making educational
facilities more generally available in develop¬
ing countries. The practical application of
these skills appears to be a fruitful alter¬
native use for the engineering and systems
management capabilities of the military sec¬
tor in the industrialized countries.
In any list of alternative uses for military
capabilities mention should also be made of
the vast quantities of resources needed to
alleviate suffering and to help in reconstruc¬
tion as a result of the more or less predic¬
table cycle of natural disasters. The world¬
wide refugee problem also calls for vast
quantities of resources if the refugees' basic
requirements for survival are to be met.
These are two areas in which the interna¬
tional community has shown intself in re¬
cent times to be willing to assume a collec¬
tive responsibility.
A structural transformation such as the
conversion to civilian activities of the
resources now employed for military pur¬
poses will be much easier to accomplish in a
dynamic economic environment.
The existence of broad agreement on
where the solution lies is a far cry from the
elaboration and implementation of a
strategy to achieve that solution. The
Declaration and the Programme of Action
for a New International Economic Order
adopted in 1974 and their subsequent
elaboration at the seventh special session of
the United Nations General Assembly and in
the International Development Strategy for
the Third United Nations Development
Decade form the most comprehensive plan
of action that exists at present.
The implementation of this strategy with
deliberate speed is a vast undertaking, with
commensurately massive requirements for
resources and far-reaching implications for
the structure and pattern of global economic
activity. When new economic and social
programmes requiring resources valued at
several hundreds of billions of dollars are at
stake, the resource constraints imposed by
the arms race become apparent. It is even
legitimate to wonder whether the adoption
of such a bold and enlightened perspective
is at all possible if international relations
continue to be dominated by an arms race
mentality.

Tribute
to Paulo E. de
Berredo Carneiro
Paulo E. de Berredo Carneiro, Ambassador of Brazil and a
member of Unesco's Executive Board, died in his native city
of Rio de Janeiro on 17 February 1982 at the age of 80. Ever
since 1945, when he was Brazil's representative on the
Unesco Preparatory Commission in London, he was closely
associated with the Organization's most notable activities. He
was chairman of the Executive Committee of the International
Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, and for many
years directed the work of the international commission set
up by Unesco to prepare the multi-volume History of
Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Development. He was per¬
manent delegate to Unesco for close on 20 years.
A man of science as well as a man of culture, philosopher
and historian, a university teacher in Brazil and France, Paulo
E. de Berredo Carneiro was a humanist who remained faithful
to the culture of Latin America but also understood and
championed all the values of the contemporary world, follow¬
ing their evolution with unceasing vigilance.
The philosopher who wrote Towards a New Humanism,
published in 1970, was also a man of action. He contributed
to the creation of a number of research institutions, notably
the Brazilian Centre for Physical Research and the Brazilian
Association of Education, expressing his belief in the associa¬
tion of science and education as the mainspring of culture. He
firmly believed that a life devoted to the service of the interna¬
tional community was one dedicated to the highest ideals,
and unfailingly affirmed his faith in tolerance, respect for
others, and human dignity.
Cold from the sun
A method of harnessing solar power deve¬
loped for the US space programme is to be
field tested on a large scale in 13 countries to
determine its effectiveness in fuelling refri¬
gerators for vaccine storage and ice-making.
The trial, which is backed by the World
Health Organization and financed by the US
Government, will begin this spring. The
refrigerators to be tested use electricity
generated by photovoltaic panels exposed
to the sun.
The Unesco Courier
in Bulgarian
We are happy to announce to our
readers the launching of a Bulgarian
language edition of the Unesco Courier.
The Bulgarian edition, the first issue of
which appeared in January 1982, is
published in Sofia; its managing editor is
Dimitar Gradev. This brings the total
number of language editions of the
Unesco Courier to 26, not counting the
quarterly selection in Braille which is
published in English, French and
Spanish.
The growing scourge of TB
A century after the German physician
Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis
bacillus the number of TB cases in the world
is still increasing, although the means exist
to eliminate the disease as a major health
problem by the year 2000. The Director-
General of the World Health Organization,
Dr. Halfdan Mahler, writes in the current
issue of World Health, the Organization's
magazine, that "In the majority of devel¬
oping countries there has been little or no
improvement in the epidemiological situa¬
tion. Between 4 and 5 million highly infec¬
tious cases emerge each year, and TB brings
death to at least 3 million persons annually."
Death of Luther H. Evans,
former Unesco
Director-General
Mr. Luther H. Evans, Unesco's Director-
General from 1953 to 1958, died on 22
December in San Antonio, Texas. Born in
1902, he was Librarian of the United States
Congress from 1945 to 1953, and served as
adviser to the US delegation to the London
conference in November 1945 at which
representatives of 44 nations signed the
Unesco constitution. In 1947 Mr. Evans
became a member of the US National Com¬
mission for Unesco, and its chairman in
1952. He played a particularly active role in
the preparation of the draft Universal Copy¬
right Convention, heading the US delega¬
tion to the Geneva conference in 1952 which
culminated in the signing of the convention.
In a telegram to Mrs. Luther Evans,
Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, Director-
General of Unesco, expressed his sorrow at
the death of his predecessor which had
"deeply grieved all his former colleagues in
the Secretariat which owes much to his wise
leadership and to his exemplary commit¬
ment to the ideals of the Organization."
