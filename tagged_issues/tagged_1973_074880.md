Lady of Baza
Dating back some 2,400 years, this statue (detail of a figure seated on a winged throne)
was unearthed from an ancient burial ground at Baza (hence its name "Lady of Baza")
in Granada (Spain), and may have served as a funerary urn. Spanish archaeologists have
uncovered striking pieces of Iberian monumental carving with a distinctive " oriental "
style, including statues of priestesses, the famous " Lady of Elche ", found on a site
120 miles from Baza (see " Unesco Courier", December 1970) sphinxes, lions, bulls and
horsemen. The statue is now in the Museo Arqueológico Nacional, Madrid.

SCIENCE AND MYTH
In science fiction we can accept the
fantastic and extraordinary because we
know they are not true. But in recent
years there has been so much talk in
the press, on TV. and elsewhere of
robots that "think", computers that have
"nervous breakdowns" or "flying sau¬
cers" manned by creatures from outer
space that such myths are being taken
for scientific fact Science populariza¬
tion today therefore has an important
role to play toward a better under¬
standing of science as distinct from
the myths.

### 50640: Science and myth

SCIENCE AND MYTH
by
Pierre Auger
Talk of machines that "think", computers
having "nervous breakdowns" "flying
saucers" is creating a new kind of myth
hiding behind the cloak of science.
Here a leading French scientist discusses
modern myths in relation to a true
understanding and popularization of science.
_ O the sensational progress
of science and of physics and biology
In particular what Is generally called
the general public reacts in three
different ways.
Some admire and even wax enthus¬
iastic about the daring exploits of
astro-physics and molecular biology.
Without being really able to add to
their own knowledge, they sense the
grandeur of this amazing adventure
of the human mind.
Others are struck, above all, by the
technical achievements which follow
in the wake of scientific progress, such
as communications satellites, super¬
sonic flight, and exploration of the
moon and of the ocean floor. The
power of man equals, and in certain
fields surpasses, that of the gods of
antiquity.
There ¡s a third attitude, however,
which is wholly compounded of the
anxiety and distrust inspired by
scientific progress and at the same
time perhaps even primarily by the
attendant technical progress. Where
are we heading with these machines
and computers? Can we be sure that
these atomic, space and genetic
adventures are not going to end in
disaster?
Thus, if the writer on scientific sub¬
jects is to cater for every category of
reader, he must not take the easy
path and be content with tending and
feeding the sacred fire of the first
group we have described, and with
providing fresh grounds for the enthus¬
iasm of the second group. He must
take care to reassure the third group,
4
PIERRE AUGER, is a leading French physicist
and former Director-General of the European
Space Research Organization (ESRO) which
he helped to set up. He was head of
Unesco's Department of Natural Sciences
from 1948 to 1959 and is the author of
"Current Trends in Scientific Research", a
comprehensive survey of world scientific and
technological research published by Unesco
in 1961, 3rd edition 1963 (see also article
page 1 1).
and this he must do by re-establishing
the truth, not the truth pure and simple,
for the truth is complex and often
abstract, but the naked truth by
which I mean stripped of the fantastic
trappings with which it is all too often
embellished by publicists I dare not
call them writers who are either naive
and ill-informed themselves or else
unscrupulous popularity-hunters.
There is no denying that this is a
very difficult task. It is even regarded
as an impossible one by some people
of sound judgement who see the
attempts of science writers to acquaint
the general public with certain fields
of knowledge as leading simply to the
creation of a new kind of mythology.
I can be quite frank here and admit
that they are often right. This is certainly
one of the main rocks on which the
efforts of those known as popular
science writers come to grief. It is a
rock never struck by the writers of
those works of fiction in scientific garb
which fill library-shelves labelled
"science-fiction". Here, the creation
of myths is the avowed aim.
A word of warning however. It is
essential that the mythical nature of
such books be clearly indicated so
that there is no mistake about what
is being offered for public consumption.
There has been too much talk of
machines that think, computers that
get nervous breakdowns and flying
saucers with little green men from
outer space. From all this there
seems to have been born a kind of
myth which people, are beginning to
take as scientific fact.
But let us look at what the popular
science writer can do to communicate
knowledge instead of new myths. First
of all, what distinguishes a scientific
theory from a myth?
Here I am using the word myth to
signify an explanation or theory of
natural or human phenomena and
events, like those handed down by
tradition in ancient times and those
still transmitted in this way by so-called
uncivilized peoples following the
thought processes of "the savage
mind" described by Claude Lévi-
Strauss.
These myths make use of figures
with human characteristics and animals
gifted with supernatural powers, but
they also present abstract forces such
as Fate or mana, particularly those
secreted in certain objects.
The expression "scientific theory"
is also used to signify explanations of
natural and, if need be, human
phenomena, and although these explan¬
ations do not make use of human
figures or animals, they nevertheless
attribute specific properties to certain
objects which secrete forces and are
capable of generating phenomena and
bringing about events.
Examples of such objects are
magnetized or electrically charged
bodies, and radioactive or fissile subs¬
tances. The analogy is so strong as
to cause confusion in some cases and
myths then grow up around machines,
magnets, high-tension cables and
ships. A good example is the cargo-
cult that grew up around the steamers
bringing wealth to the islands of the
Pacific.
I shall be told that the educated
public of the developed countries will
not fall a prey to such confusion. But
it is precisely on this point that I would
be tempted to share if only very
partially the pessimistic opinion I
mentioned earlier.
Are we quite sure, in fact, that the
information given by the popular
science writers is always properly
understood in the scientific sense?
Is there not a tendency among the
general public, or a large section of
it, simply to trust the presumably
competent dispensers of information
and to be content with metaphors and
rather vague analogies.
To give an example, it is said quite
commonly that space engineers have
managed to put a satellite in orbit, or

are used in infra-red lasers and experiments are being made on their use in earth-satellite, satellite-satellite space

### 50640: Science and myth

The legend of the magnetic mountain Magnetism was such a mysterious phenomenon that It gave
rise to a whole mythology among the Ancients. The
geographer Ptolemy wrote that, near present-day Borneo,
there existed mountains "of such great powers of attraction
that ships are built with wooden pegs, lest the iron nails
should be drawn from the timbers" with disastrous results
(left). The legend of the magnetic mountain was repeated In
"A Thousand and One Nights" and was accepted as true
until early In the 17th century when men such as William
Gilbert, "the Galileo of magnetism", laid the foundations of
modern theories. Below, the lines of force in a magnetic
field as drawn by James Clerk Maxwell In 1865. Iron filings
attracted by a magnet (right) form patterns which enable us
to "see" the magnetic field. Curious patterns can be built
up in this way in photo right one can imagine the head of
an otter or a beaver and some contemporary artists make
use of the properties of magnets in works of kinetic art.

SCIENCE AND MYTH (Continued)
that it has gone off its trajectory and
fallen into the sea. In this case, it
seems clear that the orbit and the
trajectory are thought of as abstract
objects which the satellite may follow
or leave just as a train does the track,
or a car the road. This is under¬
standable since we model our con¬
ceptions on familiar facts and events.
Unfortunately, the model in this case
is a bad one and leads to false ideas
about space mechanics. It is perhaps
appropriate to use the term myth, in
this instance, by comparison with
those myths about the planets or the
sun in which the heavenly body
followed real paths laid down by the
gods.
We have another example in radio¬
activity and radium. A veritable myth
had grown up around these glamorous
words, and every mineral water and
even some beauty creams used to
boast of being radioactive, for this was
a guarantee of efficacy. We have
recently witnessed a spectacular
reversal of the myth, since radioactivity
is now considered dangerous because
of fallout and the labels on the
mineral water bottles and jars of
beauty cream have been surreptitiously
brought up to date.
What has to be done, people will
say, is to give more detailed informa¬
tion, explain the laws of celestial
mechanics, and throw light on the real
nature of radioactivity, striking the
balance between its benefits, as in the
treatment of cancer, and its dangers.
They are right of course, and this is
what many serious popular science
writers are doing, backing up the very
effective and, it must be said, even
essential efforts being made at all
levels of the education system.
Only piecemeal improvements will
be made in this way, however, when
the subjects being dealt with are
particularly in the news. A more
general strategy must be adopted if
we are not to rest content with small
tactical victories.
In this connexion, I would like to
make a suggestion based on the
concept of a "model". A model, which
is basically nothing more than the
concrete representation of an abstract
theory, is a tool for thought and even
for discovery which is very useful
both in making scientific progress and
in giving an account of such progress,
scientists being no different from other
men in the way they think. To make
myself clearr I shall draw a parallel
' *. . ,'*
Photo Bibliothèque de Genève
between myths and models, and first
of all, I shall recall a few facts from
the history of science.
Scientists usually take pride in
presenting their results In the most
perfect and most elegant form, without
giving any idea of the gropings, the
false starts, and the hard intellectual
and experimental work which led up
to them.
It is understandable that they should
wish not to overburden their writing
with details which have ceased to be
of current interest. On the other hand,
how worthwhile it would be to follow
step-by-step the thought and the
labour of this or that great discoverer
in his exploration of new scientific
fields.
In the few cases where this has
been possible thanks to an auto¬
biography or a series of published
papers, it has made an exciting and
instructive study. We can see the
part played by models and preliminary
plans which are like scaffolding to be
removed when the building has been
completed.
These models are often concrete
ones, sometimes visualized as im¬
provised mechanisms. This was so

in the case of James Clerk Maxwell,
for example, who had experimented
with models of rollers centred on the
lines of magnetic force and represent¬
ing the movements of electricity.
Once his equations had been estab¬
lished, all the apparatus was discarded
and the equations are now elegant,
perfect and abstract. They are
also completely incomprehensible to
anyone who has not undergone a
lengthy initiation.
Many models remain very useful,
however, even when the knowledge
they represent has been outdated by
more general theories. Bohr's planet¬
ary model of the atom, for example,
still serves quite adequately to inter¬
pret many properties of the atom and
the molecule. It has the further
advantage of being sufficiently visual
to be easily accepted by non-
specialists.
The even older model of the elastic
atoms of the kinetic theory of gases
continues to be employed. A great
English scientist admitted that he still
used it to help him think out his ideas.
"When I think of the thermic agitation
of the atoms of a gas", he said, "I
cannot help seeing little red and white
balls knocking against each other."
Of course he knew very well that the
model was inadequate.
This is the heart of the matter and
one of the big differences between
models and myths. The model is
partial, incomplete and provisional,
constructed to be useful for a time
(sometimes a very long time!) and then
superseded. The myth, on the other
hand, is total and definitive from the
outset and in this draws close to belief.
We shall find other characteristics
which carry it at the same time farther
away from scientific theory.
But do not theories themselves run
the risk of changing into myths if they
are treated too much as if they were
absolutes? We have the old example
of phlogiston which gave metals their
sheen and hardness and which
resisted the theory of oxidation so
stubbornly.
Are we not also justified in saying
that absolute time has become a myth
still perpetuated by many educated
people although it is nothing more
than a model which is very adequate
on most occasions but must yield to
the four-dimensional universe of
Minkowski and Einstein.
There is an obvious defence against
myths: it is built into the scientific
method itself which considers theories
good as long as they account for
phenomena in the best possible way
and especially when they represent a
minimum number of arbitrary rules and
parameters for a maximum number of
facts explained. In the realm of myths,
on the other hand, there is one myth
for each fact or occurrence to be
explained, just as the ancient Romans
had a different god for each of life's
events, no matter how insignificant.
Here we come to the most sensitive
point the one which Is the chief
worry, not to say nightmare, of the
modern lovers of myth the touchstone
of experiment. A theory, however fine
it may be, gives way when confronted
with a contradictory fact established
by experiment. A myth does not give
way but argues, evades and finds
often purely verbal loopholes.
This is true of the myth of the waves
which are emitted by thinking minds
the thought waves in telepathy the
fluids or waves operative in water-
divining, "second sight", extra-sensory
perception, and so on. Experimental
demonstrations to the contrary have

no effect on myths and this is an
excellent way of distinguishing them.
This is not to say that theories
must be immediately confirmed by
experiment if they are to be consider¬
ed scientifically respectable. Experi¬
mental confirmation might not come
for some time. Researchers will
devote all the more effort to this task
if the theory has internal logic, is
linked with other scientific fields, and
synthesizes numerous facts already
known, all these being the character¬
istics of a good theory.
One example is Pauli's hypothesis
of the existence of the neutrino, a
particle having no mass, no magnetic
field, no electric charge and hardly
any effect in its passage through
matter but which made it possible to
restore to their place under the general
laws of the conservation of energy and
the quantity of movement, absolutely
sure experiments lying apparently
outside their scope.
"The neutrino is a myth", said some
physicists. Experiments have never¬
theless shown that it exists, and it
plays a fundamental role in nuclear
physics. Two or three other hypo¬
theses of this kind are currently being
tested, namely the quark, the parton
and the intermediate boson. They
are good hypotheses which are
awaiting the verdict of experiments.
They are not myths.
If we wish to explain this to a wide
public which is so often impressed by
the romantic aspect of the myths we
spoke about earlier, and also of the
myths concerned with vitalism, vital
force and vital impulse, we must lay
stress on the quantitative, measurable
and calculable aspects of correct
theories, as opposed to the resolutely
and purely qualitative character of
myths.
The rotational force of spiritualists'
turning tables has never been mea¬
sured nor the speed of propagation of
telepathic waves and for very good
reasons. Calculations of the neutri¬
no's precise energy and velocity (that
of light) were made even before it was
found and they proved to be correct.
The case of the neutrino is obvi¬
ously a perfect example. There is no
reason, however, why the serious
popular science writer should penalize
himself by disregarding the fact that
all classes of readers are attracted
by accounts sometimes full of the
unexpected and even of a kind of
romanticism of the great scientific
discoveries and movements, of the
opening up of the great avenues of
science.
Several books could be quoted
which tell of adventures in connexion
with the life of a scientist or the
development of a school or laboratory,
and which are full of memorable
anecdotes, some of which have a
genuine scientific interest since the
real life situations they describe show
how scientific thought develops.
What a lot there is to learn from
books like these, either for young
people attracted towards science or
even for the general reader seeking
a better understanding not only of the
findings of research but also of "how
it was done" and how such discov¬
eries are made.
Books like these bring out the rôle
of scientific information, in other
words, of knowledge of what has
already been done, the rôle of the
imagination which makes it possible
to get out of the rut and discover
new paths, and the rôle of chance
or of luck, as some would say a
rôle which has often been grossly
exaggerated by sensation-mongering
commentators, and "forgotten" by
those who have benefited from it.
They are wrong, anyway, for there
is nothing more superbly human than
the power of the mind to launch a new
train of thought from facts or remarks
which will be overlooked by people
who are incapable of wonder. The
classic examples are Henri Becque-
rel's discovery of radioactivity, the
result of choosing a uranium oxide salt
as a fluorescent substance, and Don¬
ald Glaser's bubble chamber inspired
by a glass of beer.
The "personalized" history of scien¬
ce can also be a way of admitting the
general public into the laboratory and
showing the amount of work, thought,
experimental skill and, finally, patience

It was not until the time of
Benjamin Franklin (and his
Russian contemporary Mikhail

phenomenon was linked with
the new discoveries being
made about electricity. In
1752, Franklin conducted his
famous experiment of flying

adopted magazine format. Gerard Piel, its

Science in 1962.

that underlies great discoveries and
breakthroughs. Pasteur defined genius
as endless patience and Newton said
that he had discovered the law of
gravity by thinking about it.
I believe that a great effort must be
made to bring people who have never
been inside a research institute to
appreciate the true value of the work
done by all those research workers
whose names will never get Into the
headlines but who make a vitally
important contribution to scientific pro¬
gress.
The danger of presenting the daily
life of research workers in this way
particularly on television lies perhaps
in the contrast with the descriptions
given in science fiction, which, need¬
less to say, depict only dramatic
situations.
There is a risk of taking the poetry
out of science or at least out of
research thus serving the cause of
those who place in opposition the
famous "two cultures" of Lord Snow
(1). To my mind, the remedy lies in
the fullest possible integration of all
the activities of the human mind and,
I should like to add, good taste and
sensitivity.
(I) In his book "The Two Cultures", Lord
Snow compares humanistic and scientific
cultures through interviews with engineers,
scientists and men of letters which he uses
to show the cleavage between them.
Who is going to write the "Works
and Days" of the scientific research
worker? Possibly this is asking too
much, but it is certainly worthwhile to
describe the aspects of science's
current values which have a high
intellectual and even artistic quality.
One of the characteristics of Scien¬
ce with a capital S which has
become more and more obvious over
the last fifty years is its unity. The
general public must realize that in
science there no longer exists a juxta¬
position of subjects classified accord¬
ing to the order introduced by Auguste
Comte or following a less strictly
linear order, but instead an immense
network of facts and theories forming
a pattern from which there emerges
the outline of a veritable structure
encompassing the whole of nature,
from the universe to living beings.
This structure cannot be understood
unless it is analysed down to the
components of matter and energy, for
it is at the level of atoms and mol¬
ecules that physics, chemistry and
biology meet. We must penetrate as
far as the nucleus of the atom and
its constituent elements in order to
add astronomy and cosmology to the
other sciences.
Mathematics, of course, are every¬
where and our world is indeed the one
which Pythagoras had imagined. "All
things are numbers", he said, but what
would he have thought of the vast
field now covered by numbers?
Beginning with the simplest, there
is the number 2, following unity and
introducing diversity; it might be said
to be the atom of diversity from which
it is possible to build up the most
extreme complexities, just as all the
matter of the universe can be derived
from the hydrogen atom and the neu¬
tron.
Then there are the quantum numbers
which are small integral numbersor
half-integral or even third-integral num¬
bers, at the extreme limit while at the
other end of the scale of complexities,
the chains of macromolecules of
chromosomes offer possibilities of
combinations numbering thousands of
millions. Here, too, the structure is
simple, however, because we need
only four symbols to write the great
book of the anatomy and physiology
of Manl Mathematicians will say that
two would be enough, but the chains
would then be much longer and
perhaps too long to remain stable.
Here, then, are two of the great
ideas which are shaping the future
development of science: the quest
for a structural unity which is no
longer just an intellectual need but is
gradually becoming discernible and
definable and the quest for a complex¬
ity which underlies the extreme variety

THE TIME-SPACE
CLOCK
Einstein's theory of relativity completely changed man's notions of space and time. Einstein
himself wrote, "There are only local times. On earth, for example, everyone is catapulted
through space at the same velocity the velocity of the earth. Thus all the clocks on earth
run on equally, and record "earth" time. For a body In motion like the earth, this Is its
own time... Now when two events take place far away from each other spatially, enormous
periods of time are involved. It is no longer possible to say which event took place first
and which second. Depending on the velocity of the observer vis-à-vis the event, either
answer might be made; and either would be true for a given case."

SCIENCE AND MYTH (Continued)
of beings (or objects) and phenomena
in the universe.
The first trend has often been called
reductionism, and it cannot be denied
that it has been dazzlingly successful,
although, it has not led to the discovery
of unity in some areas of research,
even when followed by geniuses like
Einstein. There are still four forces
which cannot be expressed in terms
of each other and these are the Strong
Nuclear force, the Weak Interaction,
Electromagnetism and the Force of
Gravitation. Nevertheless fresh hopes
are raised every day.
The second line of research has
recently been extremely successful in
the field of biology with genetics and
molecular biology, and is gaining
ground each day. It holds out the
hope that we may come to understand
the mechanisms of cellular differentia¬
tion, immunity, and perhaps cancer.
The small and, especially, the very
big molecules forming the links of the
chains of these systems of reaction,
catalysis, energy exchange, electrons
and protons, are more and more fre¬
quently the subject of scientific trea
tises and articles. They represent a
world which is enclosed within the
living world but Is generally imper¬
ceptible.
In fact, until the end of the last
century it was virtually only in hand¬
ling plants that this arsenal of complex
and active substances, which compos¬
ed the pharmacopoeia of antiquity and
were also the preserve of the cook,
dyer and perfumer, had been recog¬
nized and used. Today, as well as
these essences and alkaloids, there is
a growing list of the proteins compris¬
ing the various enzymes and co¬
enzymes found in this protoplasm
which used to be compared to a drop
of egg-white!
To bring the non-scientific public to
appreciate the value of such research
work, we must, of course, highlight
the two characteristics of science:
knowledge and utility. There must be
a better understanding of the world
around us, and thus a link-up with the
intellectual mission of humanism. Peo¬
ple must also learn how this know¬
ledge -is used in technical applications
and 'inventions calculated to improve
man's lot, so that science is seen in
its social rôle. This rôle is not a
straightforward one, as the current
problems of industrialization show, but
knowledge ¡s a prerequisite.
This brings us back to the origin
of the three attitudes which we
mentioned at the beginning: the beau¬
ty, utility and dangers of science. We
have to sail a stormy sea, guided by
the stars, taking advantage of favour¬
able currents and avoiding reefs.
This is possible only if the crews,
ratings as well as captains, retain
confidence in themselves, their reason
and their vigilance and, like latter-day
Ulysses, allow themselves to be led
astray neither by the siren voices of
all the mythologies nor by the risk
of avoiding the Charybdis of Herme-
tism and the ivory tower only to
founder on the Scylla of defoliations
and nuclear explosions.
I am not a believer in the religious
sense of the word, but I nevertheless
think, like the Church, that the greatest
sin is despair, and for Man to despair
of science and knowledge would be to
despair of himself. '

T has become fashionable
to decry science or, at least, those
unfortunate aberrations of technology
that masquerade as science. From his
rôle as a latter-day folk hero, the

supposed to have existed before the
Ecological Fall.
In this often-justified furore over
what science and technology have
done to us, we tend to forget what
the scientist is doing for us. And he
had better go on doing it. It is only a
privileged minority that can pretend to
shunt him aside. The rest of the world
needs him more than ever. Wherever
men suffer from a lack of the essen¬
tials rather than a surfeit of the super¬
fluous, science and its applications
have an honourable part to play in
human affairs.
Such was the tone of a rather un¬
usual ceremony held In November last
year in Paris. Shortly after the close
of the 17th Session of the Unesco
General Conference, two prizes were
awarded by Mr. René Maheu, Unesco's
Director-General, in one of the halls
that had just been vacated by the con¬
ference delegates.
On the rostrum were the three award
winners, an Austrian, a Soviet citizen,

SCIENCE IS GOOD FOR YOU (Continued)
with long careers behind them and
they shared an optimistic view of the
functions and the future of science.
Dr. Viktor Kovda, corresponding mem¬
ber of the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R., and Mr. Wolfgang Kühnelt
from Austria divided the Unesco
Science Prize, each receiving $2,000.
At the same ceremony, Dr. Pierre
Auger was given the Kalinga Prize for
the Popularization of Science, amount¬
ing to 1,000 pounds sterling.
The Unesco Science Prize is award¬
ed every two years for achievements
of specific value to developing coun¬
tries. In the past, it has gone to
scientists and engineers responsible
for better ways of desalting water and
growing food.
Mr. Kühnelt accepted his share of
the prize in the name of the Austrian
group who developed the so-called
LD Steel Production Process, a new
and cheaper way to make steel, more
than twenty years ago. Others in the
group cited by the award were Dr. Her¬
bert Trenkler, Dr. Hubert Hauttmann,
Dr. Rudolf Rinesch, Mr. Fritz Klepp,
Mr. Kurt Rösner, Mr. Otwin Cuscoleca,
Mr. Felix Grohs and the late Dr. Theo¬
dor Suess.
Of the three prize winners at the
Unesco ceremony, Mr. Kühnelt was
the only representative of industry.
Early in his professional life, he had
been an assistant lecturer in an Aus¬
trian university. But he preferred the
action of a steel mill to the groves of
Academe, and now, on the verge of
retirement, he is deputy manager of
operations of the Oesterreichisch-
Alpine Montangesellschaft plant at its
Vienna headquarters.
Mr. Kühnelt recalled how, in 1949,
Austria was in somewhat the position
of a developing nation during the
lean postwar years. Steel production
was low, only a million tons a year,
and it had to be raised.
But the country was short of scrap
metal, that essential ingredient in the
manufacture of steel. Mr. Kühnelt and
his colleagues experimented with a
different approach. Instead of blowing
air through a molten bath of iron from
the sides and below, they sent pure
oxygen down onto the surface of their
crucible.
It wasn't a new idea to blow oxygen
instead of air. Sir Henry Bessemer,
the English inventor and engineer had
patented it a hundred years ago, but
steelmakers believed that the use of
pure oxygen would lead to brittleness
in steel.
The Austrians were not convinced;
they found a way to use the oxygen to
get rid of the impurities in pig iron
and, at the same time, keep it out of
the steel. The method was developed
at the plant at Donawitz and also at the
Voest works at Linz, hence its name:
the LD process.
HE LD process went
around the world. In 1952 and 1953,
the first LD plants opened in Austria;
by 1954 the process was being used
in Canada. It was ideal for countries
with a small demand for steel. An
LD plant could be profitable producing
only 500,000 tons a year, as compared
to two million tons a year for traditional
processes. For once, technological
progress did not automatically imply
bigness.
Developing countries beat a path
to the Austrians" door. Steel men came
from India, Peru, Brazil and Tunisia to
learn the process, Austrians went to
their countries to teach it.
In Tunisia and Peru, the LD process
has been combined with continuous
casting: that is, the molten steel
comes out of the crucible and is cast
directly into slabs or billets instead of

ingots. The advantage is considerable
from the viewpoint of cost. Ingots
must go through a blooming mill, slabs
or billets are already in a more usable
form. Small countries with small
budgets need to invest less money in
rolling mills.
Speaking in the name of the Aus¬
trian steel men who made their first
tests with a two-ton crucible (the big¬
gest LD crucible now in use holds
400 metric tons), Mr. Kühnelt let figures
do most of the talking. Austrian steel
production has gone up from one to
four million tons. In 1954, total world
steel production amounted to 223 mill¬
ion tons; seventeen years later in
1971, the LD process was accounting
for 250 million tons, or 41 per cent of
world steel output that year.
The LD process was born out of
economic necessity. Equally practical
considerations led to the research that
also brought the Unesco Science Prize
to Dr. Viktor Kovda. A former head
of the Science Department at Unesco,
he is now director of the Institute of
Agrochemistry and Soil Science of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and he
holds the chair of soil science at Lo-
monosov State University in Moscow.
Of particular relevance to the dev¬
eloping world has been in research on
the "salting" of soil through faulty irri¬
gation methods and on ways to reclaim
it while, at the same time, using
brackish water for growing crops.
"R. Kovda too can recall
how his research started. In 1936 and
1937, he was carrying out field studies
on Uzbehistan's biggest cotton farm,
Pakhta Aral ("Cotton Island"), where
10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) were
under cultivation on the "Hungry
Steppe". At that time it was thought
that water containing more than one
gramme of dissolved mineral salts per
litre (seawater has an average of 35
grammes) was unsuitable for irrigation.
Dr. Kovda wanted to find optimal
conditions for growing high-quality
cotton. To his surprise, tests showed
that the best cotton was not produced
with water of low or no salinity. In¬
stead, it flourished with a soil-water
solution of as much as 5 to 6 gram¬
mes of salt per litre. Even when irri¬
gated with water twice as brackish,
the cotton could still survive.
In the Fergana Valley, that Dr. Kov¬
da likes to refer to as the "paradise of
Uzbekistan", the old farmers knew
they could irrigate with brackish
water. It meant growing salt-resis¬
tant crops and irrigating more fre-

FISH
OR FOWL,
OR BOTH?
A shoal of fish imperceptibly becomes a flock of birds in this 1938 print by Maurits Cornelis Escher, a
Netherlands engraver, whose drawings and prints have been widely reproduced in scientific books and
articles (See "Bookshelf, page 33). The design was used by Ivan Rosenqvist, a Norwegian geologist, to
demonstrate the particular characteristics of two substances: clay and water. The centre line of the print
represents the meeting point between particles of clay (birds) and molecules of water (fish). The further the
birds (clay particles) move upwards from the centre the more freely they fly. As the fish (water molecules)
recede from the clay particles they too can move more easily.
quently on well-drained land so that
the salts could be flushed out of the
soil. All this information was interest¬
ing but mainly academic because, in
those days, the U.S.S.R. had an ade¬
quate supply of low-salinity river
water.
Then, in 1957, Dr. Kovda was sent
by his government as an expert to
the Arab Republic of Egypt. There, he
saw water as a truly scarce asset.
Underground water with 5 to 7 gram¬
mes of salt per litre usually consid¬
ered a lethal dose for soil was being
used to irrigate oases that had remain¬
ed productive for two or three millen¬
nia.
The following year, he joined Unesco
and visited Tunisia where the same
problem existed. Food had to be
grown but only brackish water was
available to grow it. With the sup¬
port of President Habib Bourguiba of
Tunisia, he proposed that an experi¬
mental station be set up in the country
to test irrigation methods.
That was a decade ago. Today the
work done in Tunisia under the United
Nations Development Programme has
shown how the great underground sea

of brackish water lying below the arid
lands of North Africa can be used to
support crops and trees where only
rocks and sand existed before. The
lessons of Tunisia can be applied else¬
where in the developing world.
Dr. Kovda has organized the prep¬
aration by Unesco and the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization of an In¬
ternational Source Book on Irrigation
and Drainage of Arid Lands ("Irriga¬
tion, Drainage and Salinity", to appear
shortly). He himself is the author of
some 350 scientific works, including
ten books and he is now active in
Unesco's Man and Biosphere pro¬
gramme.
Yet one might say that this all began
some fifty-odd years ago when a small
boy read the adventure stories of
Jules Verne, Mayne Reid and James
Fenimore Cooper. Young Viktor Kov¬
da wanted to be an explorer. He and
his brother built a boat and roamed
the rivers around their home just as
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn did
in the books of another of his fav¬
ourite authors, Mark Twain.
When he entered the University of
Krasnodar in 1927, it was a time of
scientific growth in his country. He
was enamoured of science, but he
clung to his first love of exploration.
Soil science allowed him to be true to
both. Even as a student he carried
out soil surveys in the field. His pro¬
fessors had taught him the romance of
the earth.
Almost fifty years later, the romance
Is still there. When Dr. Kovda accept¬
ed the Unesco Science Prize, he spoke
of our mother earth and how she can
punish us severely with drought,
floods, earthquakes, volcanic erup¬
tions. We dare not sit back and merely
contemplate nature, he said. "Only if
we change nature with care will she
bear fruit and we need not preserve
her virginity for future generations."
But mother earth is 5,000 million
years old, said Dr. Kovda, and she
has not had an easy life. We must
rejuvenate her. Twenty per cent of the
earth's land surface is absolute des¬
ert and 40 per cent is arid or semi-
arid. If this land could be brought
into production by irrigation, it would
yield food... but not only food.
Photosynthesis would be taking
place over a vast area that is now
sterile. Plants would be using the
energy of sunlight to manufacture
carbohydrates, taking up carbon
dioxide in the process and releasing
oxygen.
Dr. Kovda reminded his audience
that certain industrial areas already
show an oxygen deficiency, produc
ing less than they consume. And we
all know by now that the proportion of
carbon dioxide in the earth's atmo¬
sphere is steadily rising as the result
of our holocaust of coal and oil, the
fossil fuels. In other words, Dr. Kovda
has proposed that we organize a
cycling of oxygen and carbon dioxide
by putting a plant cover over the
desert.
It is precisely the function of the
scientist to think along such bold new
lines when confronted by apparently
insoluble problems. Dr Kovda's hope¬
ful assessment of the contribution that
science can make to the future of the
planet was shared, in the main, by the
third speaker on the rostrum at Unesco
House.
At seventy-three, Dr. Pierre Auger
is the oldest of the award winners,
but he is a remarkably young man in
spirit. This is probably because he
has led a series of lives, first a twenty-
year career in the laboratory as a
cosmic-ray physicist, then an almost
equally long "life" as director of
higher education in France after World
War II, head of science at Unesco, and
director-general of the European Space
Research Organization. And now, in
an extremely active retirement, he is
continuing his work as a popularizer
of science, writing articles and making
radio broadcasts to answer the quest¬
ions of a worried public.
Dr. Auger did not grow up in the

tan, Dr. Viktor Kovda, winner of
Unesco's Science Prize, noted how
farmers used brackish water to irri¬
gate their land. Later, in southern
Tunisia, he proposed the use of
similar methods. Since then a U.N.
research programme has shown how
the great underground sea of
brackish water below North Africa's
arid lands can be used to grow
crops and trees a lesson that can
be applied elswhere in the develop¬
ing world.
SPARKING A STEEL
REVOLUTION
For developing a revolutionary new pro¬
cess of steel production a group of nine
Austrian researchers was awarded the
Unesco Science Prize in November 1972.
Photo shows one phase of this production
technique the LD process in which pure
oxygen is blown onto the surface of the
crucible. The LD process, a cheaper and
more efficient way to make steel, is now
used in all parts of the world.

countryside as young Victor Kovda
had done. His father was a professor
of chemistry at the Sorbonne; his
home was steeped in science. The
Augers decided to give their son more
than an ordinary education in science.
With several other Sorbonne scien¬
tists, they formed a "community" to
teach science to each others' children.
Jacques Hadamard, a great French
mathematician, taught Pierre Auger
mathematics and geology. His father
had given him chemistry and his own
interests had led him to enter the
Ecole Normale In Paris as a biology
student at the age of nineteen. There,
he came under the influence of Jean
Perrin and his son. The elder Perrin
later won a Nobel Prize in physics
while Francis, his son, became the
head of the atomic energy establish¬
ment in France. Pierre Auger was
converted to physics, but he already
had an interdisciplinary view of the
sciences that has never left him.
This made it all the easier for him
to project science beyond the bounds
of his profession and bring it within the
grasp of the general public. "The
public has a false idea of science", he
has said. "It sees dangers where none
exist; it does not see them where they
are really present. Atomic energy is
feared but it can be controlled. There
is much less concern over the demo¬
graphic explosion yet, so far, we do
not know how to control it."
While carrying on his scientific
work, Dr. Auger wrote and broadcast
regularly for the public. He had over
300 articles published in Lectures pour
Tous, a large-circulation French maga¬
zine, and he helped bring science into
the programmes of the French Radio
and Television Service. It was for this
aspect of his career that he was
awarded the Kalinga Prize for the
Popularization of Science, founded in
1951 by an Indian industrialist, Mr. Bi-
joyanand Patnaik, and administered by
Unesco.
When he accepted the prize at
Unesco House, Dr. Auger discussed
the responsibilities of the scientific
popularizer and, at the same time, the
attitude of the general public towards
science (see article page 4.) Some
members of the public are enthusiastic
about the intellectual adventure of
basic science, others want to hear of
the feats of technology, but there is a
third category that looks upon science
with anxiety. The first two require
mainly food for thought, said Dr. Auger,
but the third should be given the
unvarnished truth without dramatic
trappings.
What the popularizer must do at
all costs Is to transmit knowledge
rather than create myths. Dr. Auger
made a case for the humility of science
that seeks truth by building a theory
or model, then testing it by experi¬
ment. The mythmaker, on the con¬
trary, explains events by bestowing
superhuman virtues upon objects. The
test of a scientific theory is its uni¬
versality, but this does not concern
the mythmaker who can invent a new
explanation for every new event just
as the Romans had a god for every
phenomenon.
Dr. Auger observed that all bar¬
riers between disciplines are now
down just as they were in that scien¬
tific "community" of his childhood.
The unity of structure of the universe
is becoming apparent, we can under¬
stand the stars only if we can under¬
stand the atom and nuclear energy.
Even science and art are drawing
closer. The hope of science lies in
this universality.

### 50642: The Enigma of the Thracians; tomb discoveries on the plains of Bulgaria shed new light on a civilization of hunters and goldsmiths dating back 3,000 years

by Magdalina Stancheva
HE Thracians and their
culture pose one of the most fascinat¬
ing enigmas in the early history of
Europe. Today their ancient territories
lie within the frontiers of Bulgaria,
Greece and Turkey-in-Europe; and
though the Thracians bequeathed their
cultural heritage to Europe, they were
bound to Asia by strong and abiding
links.
Mention of the Thracians may bring
to mind the name of Spartacus, who
led a great slave uprising against
ancient Rome, or passages from
Homer's Iliad. It may also conjure up
an image of gold treasures or of a
region in south-eastern Europe.
As early as the 13th century B.C.
the Thracians crossed the narrow strip
of water separating them from Asia
Minor and indisputable traces of their
presence have been found in the
earliest archaeological layers at the
MAGDALINA STANCHEVA Is one of the
leading archaeologists and philologists of
Bulgaria. Head of the Archaeological Depart¬
ment of the Historical Museum in Sofia
for the past twenty years, she has carried
out Investigations at all the major archaeo¬
logical sites in her country. For her pioneer
work on Serdica (the ancient name for Sofia)
she was recently awarded the Sofia Prize.
site of Troy. In this way they occupied
areas of contact between the two
continents and remained open to in¬
fluences from both East and West.
Answers to some of the mysteries
surrounding the Thracians are today
being found in the burial and settlement
mounds that dot the Bulgarian land¬
scape. Archaeologists excavating the
many cultural layers of the settlement
mounds have uncovered strata dating
back to the Neolithic and Bronze Ages
and found apparent evidence of links
with Thracian and pre-Thracian tribes.
Much painstaking work remains to be
done, however, before it is possible
to determine the date from which the
inhabitants of these settlements can
be considered with certainty as Thra¬
cians.
Altogether, over 15,000 mounds have
been charted and listed by Bulgarian
archaeologists and are now protected
by law as important cultural relics.
What do they hide? Some may be
princely tombs rich with priceless ves¬
sels and jewellery; others may be
soldiers' graves, containing merely an
urn full of ashes and a bent iron spear.
There is work enough for generations
of archaeologists.
But it is not always the biggest
mound that conceals the most valu¬
able treasure. Two years ago, during
the construction of a canal near Sofia,
the scoop of a mechanical shovel bit
deep into a slight rise in the ground
and brought up in its load of earth a
clay urn, a copper cauldron and a huge
gold bowl. With its exquisite shape
and ornamental flutes and spirals, the
gold bowl, dating back to just over
one thousand years B.C., was clearly
the work of a skilled goldsmith.
Prior to this discovery the only
known gold vessels from this period
of Thracian history were those found
near the village of Vulchitrun, in north¬
ern Bulgaria, and known as "The Vul¬
chitrun Treasure". More than 14 kilo¬
grammes of gold had gone into the
making of these vessels of various
shapes and sizes, which it seems were
intended for ritual use, possibly in
connexion with sun-worship.
From about 500 B.C. the Thracian
principalities flourished, and many of
the Thracian tribes united to form the
powerful kingdom of Odrysae. They
traded with Greece and with the Greek
colonies established along the shores
of the Aegean and the Black Sea.
Greek influence made itself felt among
the ruling classes. But it was a two-
way traffic and Thracian culture in turn
left its imprint on the arts and crafts
and even the cultural life of the Greeks.
One example of this was the spread
of the cult of the god Dionysius which
was rooted in Thracian religion. Ano¬
ther is the tragic story of the legendary
Thracian poet and musician, Orpheus, ^
which became a familiar theme in 1 /
Greek and Roman poetry. ' '

of the fabulous beasts that decorate
silver-gilt plaques, dating back to the
4th century B.C., found at the vil¬
lage of Letnitsa, northern Bulgaria.
Other plaques bear scenes of every¬
day life. Measuring between 4 and
8 cm., each plaque has a ring on the
back by which it was attached to
the straps of a horse's harness.
OLDEST BULGARIAN
GOLD TREASURE
Dating back to before 2000 B.C., the oldest
gold treasure yet found in Bulgaria consists
of a cache of 44 rings found at Khotnitsa,
Tirnovo district. Archaeologists are puzzled
by these curious objects, made of solid gold
and polished on one side only. Some
consider them to be idols, the two smaller
holes representing the eyes and the larger,
central hole the mouth; others think that they
were ornamental medallions suspended by
thongs threaded through the smaller holes.
LIBATION BOWL
One of the finest items in the treasure trove discovered at Panagyu-
rishté, 70 km. south-east of Sofia, is this 4th-3rd century B.C. gold
libation bowl. Detail left shows the outside of the bowl richly
decorated with three concentric circles of negro heads and a circle
of acorns. These motifs are repeated on the inside of the bowl. Photo
below shows complete bowl (measuring 3.5 cm. high by 25 cm. across)
which was fashioned by craftsmen of Lampsakos, one of the Greek
colonies that flourished on the coast of the Sea of Marmara.

### 50642: The Enigma of the Thracians; tomb discoveries on the plains of Bulgaria shed new light on a civilization of hunters and goldsmiths dating back 3,000 years

ENIGMA OF THE THRACIANS (Continued)
20
Odrysae, named after its ruler Seu-
thes, was built on the model of the
Greek towns In the valley of the river
Tundja. Here, where the king's palace
was built, archaeologists found .an
inscription in Greek giving the name
of the town, among the ruins that had
lain undisturbed for centuries beneath
the soil of the Valley of the Roses.
Two other magnificent examples of
Thracian art were also discovered in
the Valley of the Roses: the Panagyu-
rishté treasure and the Kazanluk tomb,
burial place of a Thracian chieftain.
The Kazanluk tomb is a small build¬
ing with a narrow passage and a round
chamber covered with a cone-shaped
dome (see "Unesco Courier", June
1968). The walls are covered with
some of the most perfect paintings in
Europe, the finest to come down to us
from the fourth century B.C.
In the centre is depicted the classical
scene of a funeral feast with the chief¬
tain and his wife seated at a well-laden
table. The wife has placed her hand
in that of the Thracian prince, her head
is bent, her exquisite face expresses
grief at the parting. Around them are
servants bringing gifts, and leading
the dead chieftain's favourite horses.
The atmosphere of solemnity is soften¬
ed by these touches of intimacy.
Up above, in the dome, four-in-hand
chariots are being raced.
The paintings reveal the hand of a
highly trained and skilful artist, pos¬
sibly a Greek, but the spirit and the
content of the scenes depict Thracian
customs and the life of a princely
Thracian home.
The set of gold wine vessels, or
rhyta, found near Panagyurishté is
another example of the penetration of
Greek art. The rhyta are made in a
variety of forms: the heads of women
or animals, amphoras with mythologi¬
cal scenes, the forequarters of a goat.
The flat cup (Phiale) Is ornamented
with concentric circles of small negro
heads in relief (see photo page 19).
This exquisite work was made in
the city of Lampsakos on the coast
of Asia Minor.
Many other masterpieces have been
unearthed in recent years and named
from the places where they were
found: the Loukovit, Letnitsa, Vratsa
and Stara Zagora treasures. Gold or
silver, they were almost all made by
Thracian goldsmiths.
Many of the objects found in tombs
were made to ornament the trappings
of horses, for Thracian funeral cus¬
toms included the burial of the dead
man's horse in the same mound. A
Thracian warrior's proudest posses¬
sions were his horse and the arms he
bore, and their decorations were true
works of art.
Figures of animals usually formed
part of the decoration. Skilful styli-
zation transformed their strained and
contorted bodies into intricate entwined
ornaments extraordinary combina¬
tions of four-footed animals, birds and
reptiles.
This art, which was possibly alien
and incomprehensible to the Greeks,
was the product of centuries of dev¬
elopment, during which its forms attain¬
ed a remarkable degree of stylization,
without, however, losing their initial
traits. Some researchers have re¬
cently looked for the sources of this
art in pre-Achaemenid Iran, where new
finds from Luristan show interesting
similarities with those of Bulgaria.
Man, the warrior and mounted hun¬
ter, is the main subject of the decor¬
ative plaques found near the village
of Letnitsa. In contrast to the animal
forms, the human figures appear
rather stiff and clumsy. The engraver
shows little concern for proportion, but
carefully records details of the chain-
mail and weapons, and notably the
face, which is large and expressive.
Human and horses' heads, unconnec¬
ted with the rest of the composition,
are boldly placed in the spaces around
the figures.
HE variety and abundance
of finds in the tombs is linked with the
Thracian attitude towards death. The
Greek historian, Herodotus, (5th cen¬
tury B.C.) described the Thracian cus¬
tom of lamenting over a new-born
baby, but of bidding farewell to the
dead with feasting and merrymaking.
This attitude to life and death must
have expressed the hardships of
everyday life, which led the Thracians
to the ritual rejection of life and to
the concept of death as a deliverance.
Having become a deeply-rooted tra¬
dition, this attitude accounts for the
extraordinary magnificence of the
funerals of the rich. No less than five
richly adorned chariots together with
the horses required by the ritual were
found buried near the tomb of their
master in a mound not far from the
town of Stara Zagora.
In the early years of our era the
A lovely example of Thra¬
cian art, this 16 cm. high,
stylized stag of the 7th
century B.C. was found at
Sevlievo (Bulgaria). The
points of the antlers are
carved in the form of
birds' heads.
hand of Roman rule was laid heavily on
this martial and freedom-loving people.
The prolonged resistance to Roman
conquest was marked by acts of des¬
perate courage, which we learn about
from Roman authors. Far from his
native land (today in south-western Bul¬
garia) Spartacus the Thracian became
the leader of the greatest rebellion of
slaves in history.
But in time many Thracians joined
the Roman army and administration,
while the nobles preserved their pri¬
vileges and their estates, as inscrip¬
tions on the Thracian villa-castle near
Stara Zagora and burial finds of the
Roman period affirm.
Yet the spirit of Thracian culture
survived, and although luxurious tem¬
ples to the gods of the Graeco-Roman
Pantheon were built, shrines of Heros,
the Horseman, the beloved and most
honoured Thracian deity, are still found
scattered over the Thracian lands.
Like his worshippers, Heros was a
hunter and warrior. He is associated
with the powers of life as well as the
underworld and he was the god of both
fertility and death. Bendis, the forest
huntress, who is identified with Arte¬
mis-Diana, the huntress, is Heros'
feminine incarnation.
In the following centuries the Thra¬
cians had to endure the invasions of
the Goths, the Visigoths and the Huns.
They withdrew many times to the hills
and again returned to the ravaged
plains, into which, in the sixth century,
the Slavs gradually penetrated and
settled. They were the last wave of
the Great Migration of the Peoples.
The surviving Thracians merged into
the new ethnic community formed here
by the Slavs and the Proto-Bulgarians.
Today, after 1,300 years, a distant
echo of the Thracian past is still heard
in Bulgarian folklore, in those special
features which distinguish it from the
folklore of the other Slav peoples, and
which are rooted in the ancient history
of present-day Bulgaria.

GUNNAR NAESSELUND is Director of Unes¬
co's Department of Free Flow of Information
and Development of Communication. Before
joining Unesco he was Managing Director and
Editor in Chief of "Ritzaus Bureau", the
Danish national news agency. He has been
deputy chairman of the International Press
Telecommunications Council and was formerly
a lecturer at the school of journalism at

HE satellite broadcasts of
tomorrow became the focus of the
debate on communications at Unesco's
seventeenth General Conference in
Paris in October-November 1972, al¬
most ten years to the day after the
first authorization given by the Gen¬
eral Conference to the Director-Gen¬
eral to undertake studies of the conse¬
quences which new techniques of
communication by artificial satellites
might have on the achievement of
Unesco's objectives.
A series of studies, meetings and
negotiations culminated in a "Declara¬
tion of Guiding Principles on the Use
of Satellite Broadcasting for the Free
Flow of Information, the Spread of
Education and Greater Cultural Ex¬
change", setting out in a Preamble and
eleven Articles principles for guidance
of member states in the use and dev¬
elopment of this new technology.
The guidelines were finally adopted
at the General Conference by a large
majority, but the debates as well
as the voting figures revealed a
conflict of views which will not be
easily reconciled.

A declaration of 11 'guiding principles'

The use of Outer Space being governed by international law, the development of satellite broad¬
casting shall be guided by the principles and rules of international law, in particular the Charter
of the United Nations and the Outer Space Treaty.
Satellite broadcasting shall respect the sovereignty and equality of all States.
Satellite broadcasting shall be apolitical and conducted with due regard for the rights of indivi¬
dual persons and non-governmental entities, as recognized by States and international law.
The benefits of satellite broadcasting should be available to all countries without discrimination
and regardless of their degree of development.
The use of satellites for broadcasting should be based on international co-operation, world¬
wide and regional, intergovernmental and professional.
Satellite broadcasting provides a new means of disseminating knowledge and promoting better
understanding among peoples.
The fulfilment of these potentialities requires that account be taken of the needs and rights of
audiences, as well as the objectives of peace, friendship and co-operation between peoples,
and of economic, social and cultural progress.
The objective of satellite broadcasting for the free flow of information is to ensure the widest
possible dissemination, among the peoples of the world, of news of all countries, developed
and developing alike.
Satellite broadcasting, making possible instantaneous world-wide dissemination of news,
requires that every effort be made to ensure the factual accuracy of the information reaching
the public. News broadcasts shall identify the body which assumes responsibility for the news
programme as a whole, attributing where appropriate particular news items to their source.
The objectives of satellite broadcasting for the spread of education are to accelerate the expan¬
sion of education, extend educational opportunities, improve the content of school curricula.

within the U.N. family to deal with
these questions. On the one hand
are the fears of developing and other
nations of being exposed to unwanted
programmes, over which they have no
control. On the other are the obvious
benefits which individual countries
could gain from having access to
programmes, which would promote the
exchange of ideas and knowledge.
All these issues are Interrelated and,
in part, contradictory, which in itself
explains the complexity of the problem
and the conflicts which emerged during
the General Conference debate.
Broadcasting satellites are a new
generation of communication satellites,
which will make it possible to transmit
television programmes directly to com¬
munity or home receivers equipped
with adaptors and special antennae.
One such installation constructed in
the United States, will be used experi¬
mentally to pick up full colour tele¬
vision programmes from the NASA
experimental satellite ATS-F, which is
expected to be launched early in 1974.
The cost of these units will be about
two thousand dollars each, for an
order of 300 one for each of the
sites selected for the experiment.
Manufacture In large quantities may
halve the price. Later on the same
satellite may be used for similar pur¬
poses over India for a one-year experi¬
ment in about five thousand villages.
The United Nations Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is
the focal point within the U.N. family
for co-ordination of the U.N. activities
in this sphere and has been kept
informed throughout of progress in the
preparation of the Unesco Declara¬
tion, but has not yet been able to
comment. It is expected to do so soon
when two of its organs may have the
text of the Declaration on their agenda.
Meantime, arising from a sugges¬
tion by the Soviet Union, the U.N.
General Assembly has requested its
Outer Space Committee to elaborate
principles for the use of satellites
for direct television broadcasting, with
a view to concluding an international
agreement.
A number of member states at the
Unesco General Conference consid¬
ered that no final decision should be
taken on the presented text until the
views of the United Nations had been
heard. Others remarked that there
was not much point in placing before
the U.N. Committee a text which had.
not been endorsed and therefore did
not represent a political reality.
A number of industrially developed
countries, including the United States,
Australia, Canada and the Fed. Rep.
of Germany, directed their interven¬
tions in the first place, towards a de¬
ferment of any conclusive Unesco
action. Others, grouping France, East¬
ern Europe and developing countries,
wanted the text adopted forthwith, and
won by a majority of 55 in favour, 7
against, with 22 abstentions.
The United States and others oppos¬
ed the Declaration also on the grounds
that any attempt to regulate by inter¬
national principles the use of outer
space for direct broadcasts was a
violation of the principle of freedom of
information, and thereby also of
Unesco's own statutes and goals.
Some referred to their national con¬
stitutions, which expressly forbade
measures restricting freedom of ex¬
pression.
The fear of the unknown and the
uncertainty surrounding a new power¬
ful technology at the service of the
few prevailed in the debate. These

further the training of educators, assist in the struggle against illiteracy, and help ensure
life-long education.
Each country has the right to decide on the content of the educational programmes broadcast
by satellite to its people and, in cases where such programmes are produced in co-operation
with other countries, to take part in their planning and production, on a free and equal footing.

The objective of satellite broadcasting for the promotion of cultural exchange is to foster
greater contact and mutual understanding between peoples by permitting audiences to enjoy,
on an unprecedented scale, programmes on each other's social and cultural life including
artistic performances and sporting and other events.
Cultural programmes, while promoting the enrichment of all cultures, should respect the
distinctive character, the value and the dignity of each, and the right of «11 countries and peoples
to preserve their cultures as part of the common heritage of mankind.
Broadcasters and their national, regional and international associations should be encouraged
to co-operate in the production and exchange of programmes and in all other aspects of satellite
broadcasting including the training of technical and programme personnel.
In order to further the objectives set out in the preceding articles, it is necessary that States,
taking into account the principle of freedom of information, reach or promote prior agreements
concerning direct satellite broadcasting to the population of countries other than the country
of origin of the transmission.
With respect to commercial advertising, its transmission shall be subject to specific agreement
between the originating and receiving countries.
In the preparation of programmes for direct broadcasting to other countries, account shall be
taken of differences in the national laws of the countries of reception.
The principles of this Declaration shall be applied with due regard for human rights and funda
mental freedoms.
considerations were met by the princi¬
pal Articles of the Declaration recog¬
nizing that development of satellite
broadcasting shall be guided by the
principles and rules of international
law, in particular the Charter of the
United Nations and the Outer Space
Treaty; that it shall respect the sov¬
ereignty and equality of all States; and
that States shall reach or promote
prior agreements concerning direct
satellite broadcasting to the popula¬
tion of countries other than the coun¬
try of origin of the transmission. This,
of course, would include transmissions
of commercial advertising.
There is no doubt that many States
could reach mutual agreements on the
content of satellite programmes in the
fields of education, science, culture
and information, dealt with in the
Declaration. There would, however,
be other cases where such agreement
could not be reached and where plans
for satellite transmissions would have
to be abandoned or revised consid¬
erably to avoid breach of the Declara¬
tion.
Those who would disregard such
considerations would expose them¬
selves to accusations of violating inter
nationally recognized principles, even
though the Unesco Declaration is not
a binding legal instrument.
Unlike short wave radio broadcasts
across frontiers, TV transmissions via
broadcast satellite will be extremely
difficult to jam. The recognition that
this situation is made possible expli¬
citly by the use of outer space which
is declared to be governed by inter¬
national law is seen by some as a
justification for the demand for prior
consent.
The Declaration, it should be noted,
does not attempt to embrace tradi¬
tional use of radio waves nor does it
touch the point-to-point communica¬
tions that are carried over the INTEL¬
SAT systems or similar future satel¬
lite systems serviced by large ground
stations, over which governments nor¬
mally will have full control.
Two viewpoints are at loggerheads.
One holds that there is an infringement
of the right of the individual to have
access to information regardless of
frontiers, and the other, that there is a
violation of the rights of sovereign and
independent states to decide for them¬
selves what programmes their people
should be exposed to.
There are also those who, while
supporting in principle the right of the
individual to have access to informa¬
tion regardless of frontiers, maintain
that so long as broadcasting by satel¬
lite remains a monopoly of a few
countries this right is meaningless and
even prejudicial to countries without
access to satellites.
The Unesco Declaration attempted
to establish a balance between con¬
flicting views while formulating princi¬
ples which would be meaningful and
internationally accepted. As the Gen¬
eral Conference debate showed, how¬
ever, full consensus was not achieved.
Meanwhile, the technology is mov¬
ing forward rapidly. The newly launch¬
ed Canadian satellite AN1K is trans¬
mitting colour television signals which
may be picked up in the United States,
without hindrance, as well as in Can¬
ada, by means of specially construct¬
ed antannae much less expensive than
the large ground stations previously
used. Direct broadcast satellites are
already being manufactured.
The world of tomorrow is upon us,
and mankind will face it once more in
dilemma, with a mixture of anxiety and
hope.

II N the countries of the
Third World there is, strictly speaking,
no tension between traditional culture
and technology. In Africa, for instance,
technology is integrated with culture.
In "La Civilisation Africaine d'Hier

and sociologist, Joseph Ki-Zerbo, of
the Upper Volta, describes traditional
black African society as follows:
"It was a perpetually inventive
society. Technically and economically,
each family, each village, each tribal

positive equilibrium with nature. No

of cultivation, the extremely varied

devised, even if they were administered
with a wealth of magic ritual."
Tension does however exist, and Is
to be found among an Intellectual élite
and all those with some education
who have acquired a scientific back¬
ground, whatever the level, while still
living in a non-scientific society; for
example, one finds not only people
with little education, but also the well-
educated, consulting the local mara¬
bout or wise man.
The origin of this tension seems
to lie in the juxtaposition of cultures,
which is apparent at all levels of daily
life: ploughing is done to the sound
of a transistor, and the use of charcoal
as a fuel is contemporary with the use
of the motorcar.
This produces a disequilibrium which
appears from school onwards. The
African child studying scales in his
physics class has never seen scales,
unlike the European child who sees
them every day.
The upshot of this disequilibrium is
that in the countries of the Third World
science has a twofold nature.
On the one hand, in everyday
practice, science Is not backed up by
theory, with the result that real use

cannot be made of it. In his book
"L'Afrique Noire est Mal Partie" (Black
Africa Is Off to a Bad Start) the French
agronomist René Dumont provides an
excellent example of this when criticiz¬
ing the premature use of tractors in
cases where farming has no need of
modern techniques. The employment
of tractors would not only be inefficient
but would exhaust soils to which they
are not adapted. Technical means
are only efficient when they form an
integral part of a fully worked out
technology.
On the other hand, theories are not
sufficiently tested in practice; where
such practice exists, it is only in
laboratories or in a vacuum, cut off
from everyday life. Inevitably, science
seems incomprehensible.
To the extent that it is on the fringe
of the development of productivity the
Third World appears to be bypassed
by scientific developments. Today,
science and technology are as it were
"parachuted" into these countries; and
this being so, it is very unlikely that
they can help to develop a productive
system of which they are not them¬
selves the product.
In that case, if science is to put itself
genuinely above all, effectively in
the service of the human community,
and if it is to promote a dialogue
between cultures, how can it be
integrated with them, or how can
culture be adapted to science?
The most urgent problem is that of
assistance, primarily technical, to the
Third World countries. It seems that
there are two possible solutions, the
first of which would be to adapt
technology to the development of
productivity. Emphasis should be laid
on the development of rural production,
which should of course become in¬
creasingly industrial, but a start should
be made on the workshop level
in order to ensure a type of
industrial development appropriate to
the country.
Africa, therefore, must in large
measure go through the stages through
which Europe has already passed. Yet
a "rapid" solution could also be
visualized which would consist of
introducing the most modern machinery
together with foreign technicians who
would train national technicians to take
over as soon as possible.
Each of these solutions has its
advantages and disadvantages. In the
first case it could be maintained that
the more gradual the initiation the
more effective it is likely to be. But
has Africa the time to spare for this
kind of initiation if she is to progress?
Is the centuries-long development of
techniques that Europe experienced
really indispensable?
The second solution, that of rapid
modernization, would place Africa four¬
square in the twentieth century. Here
one might quote the recent examples
of Japan and China. Yet the history
of technology in Africa should not be
underrated: we need only think of the
technical mastery required to work
brass by the lost wax process.
The disadvantage of pressing on
rapidly is perhaps the very real danger
of not being able to keep -up with
technology, since techniques and their
tools must correspond with needs.
As far as the training of the
individual technician "at the machine"
is concerned, does this really provide
the necessary instruction to enable
him to transfer later to other,
more sophisticated types of machine?

### 50644: Africa in the stress of technology

LIFE CYCLE OF A VILLAGE
In the heart of rural Niger, an Instructor
at a special course on agricultural economy
explains to villagers the economic cycle
on which their daily work is based. The
village is represented at the centre of the
drawing on the blackboard (see detail
left); to the left of the blackboard are
shown the fruits of the earth grain and
vegetables; flocks of sheep and goats;
skins and tanned leather; food and millet
stocks. Surplus production is converted
into money with which to acquire (right)
foodstuffs and animal stock that cannot
be produced locally.
Everything hinges on the way such
instruction is given.
If it is only a matter of learning
a number of specific movements
necessary to work the machine or to
repair it if need be, the most that
is being achieved is the production
of good operatives for particular
machines. But one does not have to
go to university to have a well thought
out training. On the spot training can
include teaching in the wider under¬
standing of mechanical processes.
At a broader level the problem is
perhaps more difficult to resolve. To
what extent does the latest equipment
effectively meet a country's needs?
What use, for example, is a computer
in an African bank? There is the
double risk of costly under-utilization
of the computer and of causing
unemployment. As far as possible
the unemployment which, in Europe,
followed each step forward In
mechanization should be avoided.
This is a problem of both policy and
planning.
Immediate effective modernization is
never modernization at all costs, but
the result of prospecting both the
market and the needs of the individual
country.
It is a mistake to imagine that there
is a simple solution. To take the
example of rural schools: the education
they provide, which aims at keeping
the child in contact with his farming
environment and at turning him into a
farm worker who knows his job, is in
itself excellent. Yet only too often
rural schools are a failure because
those who have been trained in
them by instructors who have not
themselves assimilated the cultivation
techniques taught go back to their
traditional village cycle of cultivation,
where they find themselves completely
isolated.
Not only are they unable to make
others benefit from the skills they have
acquired, but they forget these skills
themselves. The general education
they have received makes them drift
to the towns, since their schooling has
not changed their situation in the
village.
It ¡s not possible to produce effective
results operating on too small a scale
or with makeshift resources. Simil¬
arly, the introduction of the most
modern methods Is not In itself enough.
For example, in Upper Volta, In the
Sahelian region, near Markoye, a very
modern cattle farm was established as
an experiment, with carefully selected
and supervised stock and suitably
prepared fenced-in pasture land. Yet
this experiment in rational, intensive
stock farming seems to have been a
complete failure. The reason was that
it antagonized the local people. They
were deprived of pastureland and
wells which were reserved for the
experiment, did not benefit from the
services of the farm veterinary sur¬
geons, and were unable to understand
what the experiment was about.
The first thing to be done, therefore,
is to estimate needs on a national level
and sometimes for several countries
at once. For example, a computer
which is uneconomic at national level
may be worthwhile at the multi-national
level. A highly sophisticated textile
production line, a modern distribution
network, a fruit marketing or stock-
breeding system, the construction of
roads, river control all these major
undertakings sometimes break down
on a national scale for lack of skilled
personnel, while throwing people out

AMERICANS
READ MORE BOOKS
THAN EUROPEANS
A German specialist debunks two fallacies:
1) Americans rarely ever read
2) The books they do read are of lower quality
by Heinz Steinberg
'OCIOLOGISTS, psycholo¬
gists and economists have done a
great deal of research into book read¬
ing, borrowing and buying habits in
European countries and in the United
States, but so far no systematic com¬
parison has been made between the
pattern in Western Europe and that
in America.
Where researchers have ventured
to compare the two, they have usually
expressed opinions based at the best
on largely random observation and
more often on preconceived ideas
that take root and reappear even in
scientific conclusions.
In an otherwise useful analysis of
the book market in the Federal Repub¬
lic of Germany, published in 1968, a
German demographic -institute repro¬
duced the figures of an American opi¬
nion research institute unchecked and
concluded that "Americans very sel¬
dom pick up a book". This assertion,
of course, is completely unfounded.
By checking statistics, the German
institute could have found out that
people In the United States buy twice
as many and borrow three times as
many books, per inhabitant, as people
in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Not only the Germans but Euro¬
peans In general, priding themselves
on their culture, find it difficult to
believe what is nevertheless an indis¬
putable fact that in the U.S.A. books
have a greater distribution in relation
to population than in Europe.
Before looking at the evidence for
this, let us deal with the objection

of Germany, is Director of Further Education

tures on the sociology of books at the Free
University of West Berlin.
another product of the European pre¬
occupation with Culture that Amer¬
icans may indeed buy more books,
but the books are of lower quality
another unfounded argument.
Obviously a great quantity of light
reading matter including detective
stories is sold in the U.S.A. as else¬
where, but in practically every case
where large numbers of books are on
sale or on loan, one also finds
"serious" reading matter, works by
Shakespeare or Thomas Mann for
example, and, above all, non-fiction
ranging from gardening primers to
dictionaries.
On my last trip to America, in Madi¬
son, the capital of Wisconsin, I came
across a drugstore at a considerable
distance from the University where a
copy of Plato's Symposium was dis¬
played alongside a tablet of soap, and
in an area of Washington largely oc¬
cupied by Negroes I found practically
the whole production range of a Lon¬
don fine art publisher at much reduc¬
ed prices, including some excellently
illustrated works on the collections of
Spanish museums.
In particular the American output of
paperbacks is far greater than that of
Western Europe. The total member¬
ship of book societies must also be
considerably higher in the U.S.A., in
relation to population, than in most
European countries. Moreover, Amer¬
ican book societies can provide a
much more specialized service. One
can join a book club, for instance, in
order to buy nothing but sports lit¬
erature.
Another point to note is that book
societies in Europe differ considerably
in their function from country to coun¬
try. French book societies generally
attract custom by high-quality binding
whereas the large-membership German
societies are noted for their low prices
which have enabled them to sell to
a section of the middle-class public
that normally buys few books, and to
some extent to a public on the skilled
worker level as well.
The reason for the high book output
in the U.S.A. is obvious to anyone
travelling through North America. In
the New York subway a European is
struck by the large number of people
reading books, although one reason
for this may be the difficulty of open¬
ing up a newspaper during the
business rush hour. A book can be
easily held in the hand and slipped
back into one's pocket.
In the town centre of Minneapolis,
in Minnesota, I spent hours watching
customers in a large bookshop and
time and time again saw people car¬
rying five or six volumes to the
cashier and these people obviously
came from varied classes, including
those which are rarely found in a book¬
shop in Europe.
This, In fact, seems to be the core
of the difference between Europe and
America. In Europe, at any rate in
western and southern Europe, Includ¬
ing the Federal Republic of Germany,
to some extent, and also in Great
Britain and Scandinavia, books are
associated in the mind of the public
with that section of the population
which regards itself as "cultured".
In North America it is difficult to
detect any relationship of this kind.
For Americans a book is something
to be used, valued for its utility, re:
gardless of social standing, until it can
be dispensed with. To quote Robert
Escarpit's helpful classification, books
fall into three categories of descend¬
ing importance: first, the "functional
book", secondly the "literary book"
and thirdly the "book as an object"

wwiertq éJf* *'&[
But in Europe books have always
been surrounded by an aura that does
not seem to have paled, and this aura
significantly increases the prestige of
persons who read, or who are reputed
to read books.
It would be an exaggeration to say
that cultured Europeans still carry the
book status symbol before them like
the fathers of the church pictured in
the magnificent mosaics in the Basi¬
lica di Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna
(Italy), but to the extent that books
are status symbols for the "cultured",
their use by the "uncultured" is im¬
peded.
This psychological barrier has set
a limit to the growth of book reading
in Europe and people who can
read do not necessarily read books.
Manual workers in particular are sub¬
consciously "afraid" to venture into
a bookshop or a library.
In America, unsaddled by such trad¬
itions, the book reading habit has dev¬
eloped more easily with the spread
of literacy, beyond the limitations of
class and race. People read not so
much for the sake of the cultural value
of reading to which so much impor¬
tance is attached elsewhere, but be¬
cause they have discovered the plain
usefulness of reading or wish simply
to enjoy the pleasure that it gives.
This is more fertile ground for the
growth of book reading than any
cultural formulas. Anyone who wants
to help countries to develop with the
aid of books should reflect on this and
refrain from talk of cultural improve¬
ment.
Because of the basic situation just
described, America is better at adver¬
tising books. Admittedly, this has led
to the questionable importance of the
best-seller system, but its main mani-

promoted by the public authorities in
a way which has no parallel in Wes¬

AMERICANS READ MORE BOOKS (Continued)
but certainly not in the form of a paper¬
back for the customers of an airport
kiosk and they have never become
long-sellers, still being ordered 20
years after the event.
It is practically inconceivable that a
Ministry in the Federal Republic of
Germany, and particularly the Ministry
for Agriculture, would sponsor a con¬
ference on reading. Why should this
be so? The answer is that although
discussion of books is traditional in
Europe, it never escapes from the
cultural area and too little thought is
given to the interaction between book
and reader.
But it must also be acknowledged
in making a comparison, that the book-
buyer in America faces disadvantages
other than those experienced in
Europe. Large and obviously well-run
bookshops exist in American cities,
often with considerably bigger stocks
than, for example, French booksellers
In similar sized towns. But they and
often the chain stores too are not
generally prepared to put books on
order. The usual reply to an enquiry
for a book that is out of stock is a
sympathetic shrug of the shoulders.
There are a few firms which specia¬
lize in ordering books and they gen¬
erally supply through the post against
telephoned orders, which is practically
equivalent to buying blindfold, whereas
traditionally a European bookseller is
quite prepared to order books without
obligation.
Another unfavourable aspect of the
American book market surfaces when
a book has been struck off the pub¬
lisher's list. The only answer is a
good secondhand bookseller, of which
there are very few. In any case the
price rockets and if no new edition is
in sight and a reprint is regarded as
unprofitable, the price of a book in
considerable demand may reach astro¬
nomic heights. Often the only solu¬
tion is to make a photocopy of the
whole book in one of the libraries, an
expensive process apart from the prob¬
lem of copyright.
Although in per capita terms con¬
siderably more copies of books are
printed and sold in the United States
than in Europe (leaving aside the
number of titles for which the compa¬
rison is different), anyone looking for
a specific book may often feel let
down by the American book trade.
The libraries however are prepared
to obtain any book, and a European
finds himself singing, with few reser¬
ves, the praises of American libraries,
except, perhaps, in some respects, for
the largest of them all, the Library of
Congress.
This world-famous library has indi¬
vidual works of unique rarity and col¬
lections which are astonishingly com¬
prehensive. In its bibliographic work
alone its services are irreplaceable.
But Its great size is obviously a han¬
dicap. The operation of a library run¬
ning to tens of millions of volumes
in overcrowded old-style buildings is
difficult to organize satisfactorily and
the time taken to obtain a single book
recalls the operations of the big old
European libraries rather than modern
American methods.
More modern libraries, however,
offer more than just the benefits of
technological innovation; their oper¬
ating systems have generally been so
well thought-out that a user accus¬
tomed to libraries in Europe has the
feeling of being transported into a
book paradise.
The Joseph Regenstein Library,
for example, on the campus of the
University of Chicago, has been built
to house 3è million volumes although
it serves only the humanities and the
social sciences, and within a year of
its opening, already had 2 million
volumes each directly available and
easy to find from early morning until
late at night.
Even the stock of foreign-language
reference books is larger than that in
many university libraries in the coun¬
tries where these languages are
spoken. There is no congestion since
space is provided for 2,900 readers,
half in comfortable cubicles and the
rest in partitioned conference rooms.
Europe's culture pessimists tend to
complain that books are threatened
by electronics and yet American ex¬
perience in no way justifies such fears.
On the contrary, data processing with
high-speed printout is often used in
the service of books and seems to
have the effect of reinforcing the de¬
mand for them.
In scientific information an increas¬
ingly important part is being played
by literature which is not sold through
the book trade, such as duplicated
conference papers, lectures, type¬
written reports on the results of indus¬
trial research and individual articles
in journals. America has already man¬
aged to bring this great flow of paper
under control by a combination of
computer and microfilm.
All the user has to do is to thumb
through the catalogues, but once he
has found the reference he "types"
this in himself on a keyboard and
above it, on a television screen,
appears an abstract of about eight
lines. It is then easy to decide whe¬
ther to borrow or buy the publication.
This can be in the form of micro¬
film costing a few cents and whose use
Latest profile of world translations

World figures for translations are still rising 41,322 works
appeared in translation in 73 countries during 1970 compared
with 38,172 in 65 countries in 1969 according to the most recent
issue of "Index Translationum", Unesco's annual bibliography of
translations (1).
For the first time in many years the U.S.S.R. does not lead the
field for the number of works translated. The Federal Republic
of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, are now in
first place with a combined total of 5,932 translations, followed
by the U.S.S.R. with 3,580. Spain, whose translations rose from
2,737 to 2,944 remains in third place.
Up to fourth place (from sixth in 1969) goes the United States
with 2,569 compared with 2,059, overtaking Japan, still lying fifth
with 2,069 (a drop of 98). France comes sixth with 1,918, then
come the Netherlands with 1,651, Italy with 1,587 (compared with
2,483 in 1969 when the country was fourth), Sweden with 1,539 and
Czechoslovakia with 1,440.
Translations of the Bible continue to rise: 223 in 1970 compared
with 202 in 1969 and 187 in 1968.
Lenin is still the most translated author and the celebration
of his centenary in 1970 more than doubled the number of his
works translated (448 against 202). After Lenin comes Shakespeare
(141), Jules Verne (128), Georges Simenon (119), and Enid Blyton
(108).
Among the leaders figure both classical authors and thriller-
writers. Agatha Christie with 95 is followed by Dostoievsky
(78), Dickens (77), Balzac (75), Mark Twain (71), Hemingway (68),
Pearl Buck (65) and Steinbeck (61). Behind Hans Christian
Andersen and R.L. Stevenson with 56 and 55 comes a mixed
field of James Hadley Chase (53), Dumas père (51), Hugo (47),
de Maupassant and Somerset Maugham (46), the Grimm Brothers
(43), Goethe (37), Stendhal (33), the Brontes (31), André Maurois
(30), Faulkner (29), Daniel Defoe (25) Desmond Morris and Ian
Fleming (24), Thomas Mann (20), François Mauriac (18), Kafka (17),
Simone de Beauvoir (12) and Miguel Asturias (12).
Among the Ancients, Plato and Homer tie with 48 each, ahead
of Cicero (34), Aristotle (30) and Sophocles (30).
Writers who have won the Nobel Prize for Literature stand
high: Beckett has been translated 53 times, Alberto Moravia 50,
Sartre 42, Camus 40 and Solzhenitsyn 35 times.

need will continue to grow because

the apparently competing media of
television, film cassettes and video
recordings tend to stimulate book-
reading rather than the reverse.
For America the growth in the public
libraries is of greater quantitative
significance and more important in
cultural policy terms than the very
impressive development of the scien¬
tific libraries. These public libraries,
more numerous every year, offer ser¬
vices beyond comparison with those
of public libraries in Western Europe
where imperfect user guidance is
generally typified by the limited timé
for which they are open.
Countless new buildings, even in
small townships, and whole fleets of
mobile libraries for people living in
the country, drive the statistics of
American book stocks and borrowings
higher and higher. The example of a
small and externally unattractive
branch (though the aesthetic charm of
American public library architecture
cannot be denied) in a nevertheless
Well-to-do Washington suburb made
the most lasting impression on me.
Seeing a brand new set of the Ency¬
clopaedia Britannica I told the libra¬
rian how pleasant it was to find such
an expensive reference work in so
small a library. But in the library store
there was a second copy. Readers
had occasionally asked to be allowed
to borrow one of the volumes In order
to study a major article quietly at
home, but the complete Encyclopaedia
always had to be available for refer¬
ence, explained the librarian.
She then drew my attention to
another recent acquisition, an Italian
dictionary. "There are many Italian
families living here", she said. "The
children, particularly, are always bor¬
rowing books but their parents, whose
English is not so good, also want to
know many things which are not in our
dictionaries, and they are naturally
happy to have memories revived in
their mother tongue."
When she was talking I was remin¬
ded of the Italian immigrants back in
my country. Would they receive this
sort of attention in a public library?
Hardly, since German libraries, in spite
of many extensions, are unable by and
large to meet the needs of the people
as a whole to anything like the same
extent as American public libraries.
Even if the librarian in Europe were
to acknowledge a democratic duty to
serve minorities as well, he would find
it difficult to obtain enough funds from
the authorities responsible for his
library when resources are not even
sufficient for the needs of the majority.
America, then, may well serve as a
model to Europeans in the field of pub¬
lic libraries. English and Scandina¬
vian libraries have for a long time
successfully followed the American
example. Other countries should do
the same.
This is the only effective way to
repair the harmful effects of a tradi¬
tion which, by placing books on a
pedestal, has in fact withheld them
from those who need them most.

AFRICA IN THE STRESS OF TECHNOLOGY (Continued from page 27)
32
of work. But they are possible on an
international scale.
But the problem then arises in ano¬
ther connexion at the political level.
No African country singly is in a posi¬
tion to master and make effective use
of modern technology and technolo¬
gical achievements. It is thus neces¬
sary to reach multinational agreements
and to synchronize planning estimates,
at least by economic groupings.
Unity is essential, if compensatory
arrangements are to be possible bet¬
ween different African countries: surely
Africa cannot reject an enlarged
market, of the kind that developed
countries such as those of Europe are
obliged to form?
"TILL at the political level,
and related to this problem, is the
choice of methods for industrialization.
Industrialization may start with foreign
and private resources, or alternatively
be national, either private or state-
financed. It is for Africa to choose,
but with the proviso that different
economic and political choices should
not prevent the unity required for
planning on an international scale.
Problems of planning and policy
involve obtaining the maximum return
from technical assistance. While tech¬
nical assistance is seen as the first
method of enlisting science in the
service of the human community, the
second method, every bit as vital, is
education.
Even more than in Europe, it is
necessary in Africa for science and
culture to go hand in hand. European
thought is in essence technical, even
where it has forgotten its origins.
Bergson said that intelligence fabri¬
cates concepts as it fabricates tools:
and surely concepts are nothing else
than intellectual tools.
The European child is born and
brought up in technological surround¬
ings, with increasingly technical toys,
such as the transistor radio set he can
assemble himself, walkie-talkies, and
sophisticated moon rocket models.
Such an ambiance does not exist
in Black Africa; yet the African way
of thought is of a basically practical
nature, whether in religion, dancing or
morals. African culture is something
which is experienced and practised in
depth.
Science, which is well thought out
methods put into practice, can make
use of this practical culture to banish
both misery and ignorance, and to
open up new creative possibilities to
culture. This calls for action on two
fronts, both in and out of school. In
school, the introduction to technology
should be fairly extensive, and here
particularly, manual and intellectual
work should go hand in hand.
A type of education must be devised
which is based on current practice,
and theory must be taught on the basis
of such practice. This, of course,
calls for a complete revolution in
education; but such a revolution is
possible.
The revolution in education also
means that wherever possible, the
most modern methods and techniques
should be used. In certain African
countries educational television makes
up for the shortage of teachers and
provides schooling for children who
would otherwise never go to school.
But an effort should also be made
outside schools, and here experiments,
such as literacy campaigns, have
already been attempted. But too often
such attempts have been "sketchy".
Literacy teaching should not consist
merely of teaching people to read and
write and of giving a few words of
advice to mothers. Shock tactics
should be adopted and real people's
universities should be created along¬
side the traditional universities which
all too often are cut off from the life
of the country.
ODAY reading and writing
are of secondary importance and brief
instruction in these techniques is in¬
effective and soon forgotten. It is
much more important to listen. More
and more news is transmitted by radio
which is now universally available.
Why not make full use of the radio?
Our epoch seems everywhere to be
one of word and image and in this
it resembles traditional African civili¬
zation. This is a line of approach that
should be exploited to the full.
Radio will provide the spoken word.
Existing practical information pro¬
grammes should be developed into a
real "flood" of technological broad¬
casting. This means that at the same
time, there should be adult education
evening classes in the countryside and
the towns, in order to apply the spoken
word in practice. A start should
always be made on what is useful in
everyday life: there should be broad¬
cast courses on child care, how to
mend a plough, how to look after a
bicycle or a motor-cycle.
Whenever possible the spoken word
should be backed up by the image, but,
quite apart from considerations of the
technical difficulties of television and
its cost, it must be handled with care.
It must not be forgotten that few
African peasants know how to "inter¬
pret" a photograph and a great deal
of training in the comprehension of the
image will be required. Television is
so costly that it must not fail to achieve
its objective.
IIN the final analysis, the
tension between science and culture
seems not so much an irreducible
antagonism as a stage in the develop¬
ment of all societies. The integration
of science with culture leads inevitably
to a cultural upheaval, affecting all
cultures. It is in this way that culture
can lead up to a dialogue, and act
as a binding force: science, even when
"exported", is never exported culture;
science and technology can be made
universal, and put into effect by all
men.
But there is still tension in this act
of communication, arising from the fact
that the vehicle of science is culture,
which is never universal. There Is no
such thing as "imperialist", or
"communist" or ideological science;
but ideologies for scientific develop¬
ment do exist, and are inevitable.
When assimilating science, culture
confers on it a particular significance.
That is why we prefer the expression
"adjusting culture to science", i.e.
developing society in one and the same
technological and cultural movement,
and giving that movement its ultimate
direction.
Faith in science is the same as faith
in man. If scientific development is
truly bound up with the development
of productive forces, both accompany¬
ing such development and acting as
a stimulus, the inevitable result will
be a major change in traditional
cultures, in the same way as cultural
change takes place at present in all
societies.
We are no more able to interpret
the significance of this change than
we are able to interpret the signific¬
ance of history. But like history, it
will be the work of men, and it is to
be hoped that men will realize what
kind of science they are producing,
that is to say the kind of society they
are thereby constructing.

What the world
sees on T.V.
A quarter of the world's television au¬
dience spends half its viewing time watch¬
ing programmes imported from other coun¬
tries, reports the latest edition of the Unes¬
co Statistical Yearbook (*). An analysis of
T.V. programme hours in 80 countries
reveals that 20 of them transmit nationally
produced material for only half or less
than half of the time. This indispensable
reference book also presents vital statistics
on world film production and cinema-going,
radio, the press, book production, education
and research and development expenditure.

Smallpox target zero
World cases of smallpox have dropped
from 2.5 million in 42 countries to 200,000
in 16 countries since the World Health
Organization launched its global eradication
campaign five years ago. Improved vacci¬
nation devices the jet injector and the
forked needle, with which a single health
worker can vaccinate from 1 ,000 to 1 ,500
persons a day have helped to achieve this
result.
Erasmus prize for Jean Piaget
The "Erasmus Prize" for 1972, awarded
by the Netherlands "Praemium Erasmla-
num" Foundation, goes to the world-
famous Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget.
The citation accompanying the award pays
tribute to Jean Piaget's work in the disco¬
very and analysis of the structures of the
child's thought and his influence on the
development of child psychology and edu¬
cation.
Woman of Changsa
The perfectly-preserved, 2,100-year-old
body of a middle-aged woman has just
been discovered in a Western Han Dynasty
tomb unearthed by Chinese archaeologists
near Changsa, the capital of Hunan Pro¬
vince, central China. The body was lying
in a silk-decorated wooden inner coffin
housed inside two other wooden coffins.
The tomb itself was surrounded by a 40 cm.
thick layer of charcoal which in turn was
sealed by a layer of sticky white clay
which kept out moisture and prevented
decay. More than 1,000 objects were plac¬
ed between the outermost and the inner
coffins, including silk fabrics, lacquerware,
bamboo and wooden utensils, pottery, grain
and specially made funerary objects. The
find is of the greatest value to the study
of Chinese history, culture, handicraft,
agriculture and medicine of the Han period.
Scientific thought
in the 20th century
The ideas, methods and procedures un¬
derlying many of the extraordinary scientific
discoveries and developments of the 20th
century are explained by 12 eminent
scientists in a book just published by
Unesco. Contributors to this collection of
authoritative studies include such famous
names as Jean Piaget, Abdus Salam, Satosi
Watanabe, Nicolai Vorobyev and Stafford
Beer. Entitled "Scientific Thought: some
underlying concepts, methods and proce¬
dures", the book is published by Unesco's
Division of Philosophy in co-edition with
Mouton (Paris, The Hague). See "Book¬
shelf".
Unesco clubs in Mexico
Mexico now has some 40 Friends of
Unesco Clubs, most of them in secondary
schools, and three out-of-school clubs, one
for deaf and dumb children, another at a
night school for young workers and a third
for students preparing for university. Club
activities are co-ordinated by the Mexican
National Commission for Unesco which
has just published the first issue of a
liaison bulletin for Clubs containing a brief
history of Unesco and a description of
its aims.
Science and Africa
an 'Impact' inquiry
What does the impact of modern techno¬
logy mean to Black Africa? This important
question will be examined in the April-June
1973 issue of Unesco's lively quarterly
"Impact of Science on Society" (Vol. 23,
No. 2). Thomas Odhiambo (Kenya) dis¬
cusses "Science and African Needs", Jimoh

Letters to the Editor
WORLD'S BEST 100 BOOKS
Sir,
I read with great pleasure your Jan¬
uary 1972 issue on International Book
Year. I believe that Unesco is going
to compile a symbolic set of the world's
best 100 books. I strongly suggest
that this set should include a work by
Dostoyevsky whose literary heroes and
images, whatever their psychological
complexity, serve as universal vehicles
of humanism and man's hopes. I am
sure my suggestion will find support
among many of your readers.

TOO GREAT
A LIBERTY
Sir,
I would like to assu¬
re your Hungarian artist
who looked at Inter¬
national Book Year in
your October 1972
issue that a Canadian
artist would not have
drawn a picture of the
Kremlin with books stuck on the roof
and labelled it "Eastern Europe"!
Perhaps, however, it was just an IBM
executive typewriter at Unesco which
automatically substituted the word
"North" for "United States of" in the
caption under the rather lifeless Statue
of Liberty as the "Unesco Courier" was
going to press. U.S. of A. typewriters
are quite extraordinary machines these
days.
Timothy E. Reld
Ontario, Canada
No It was no "executive typewriter"
at Unesco that substituted 'North Amer¬
ica" for "U.S.A." The captions came
with the original Hungarian drawings.
Editor.
CHEMICO-GASTROIMOMY
Sir,
We all know that we have reached
the point in this fairly advanced techno¬
logical society of ours where everything
we consume food, air, water is pollu¬
ted with one or other chemical additive.
It is only natural that the layman should
begin to wonder what effect this accu¬
mulation of unnatural materials in the
human body will have upon the future
of mankind. I am very glad to see
that the "Unesco Courier" has made
itself a forum for discussion of these
important questions.
In the debate on the harmlessness
or danger of pesticides or chemical fer¬
tilizers it is, however, surprising to see
the problems stated in such a restrict¬
ed and one-sided manner by Dr. Nor¬
man Borlaug in his article "In Defence
of DDT and other Pesticides" ("Unesco
Courier", February 1972).
Your readers might be interested to
reflect on this "Danish Menu", publish¬
ed in the magazine "Noah" under the
heading "Some information about the
earth on which we live":
Breakfast: white bread (with ben-
zoylperoxide and brómate); butter (resi¬
due of pesticides and antibiotics); egg
(mercury and lindane); jam (colorants,
bemoacid, flavouring matters min.
50 % sugar); soft cheese (emulsifying
agents and perborate).
Lunch: rye bread (propione acid);
margarine (colorants, antioxidants and
preservatives); marinated herring (hexa-
methylene tetramine). Danish salami
(nitrite); carrots (faste of kerosine,
endrin and aldrin); salt (anticaking
agents); fizzy lemonade (beefs, color¬
ants and flavouring matters); salad of
mayonnaise (colorants, bacteria, emul¬
sifying agents, antioxidants, flavouring
matters and remnants of wrapping).
Dinner: cured saddle of pork (poly¬
phosphate, nitrite, residue of antibiotics
and pesticides); tinned potatoes (sul¬
phite); wine (sulphur dioxide); oranges
(diphenyl or orthophenylphenol).
TV-tea: biscuits (bleaching agents,
colorants and flavouring matters); tea
(colorants).

TEACHING : MOT JUST
ANOTHER JOB
Many thanks to Unesco for the
remarkable inquiry into the educational
"handicap race" to which the "Unesco
Courier" devoted its June 1972 issue.
As you pointed out, family background
is of vital importance according to
the values and ideals of the family, so
the child will be more or less receptive
to culture.
But the teacher also has a great
influence on the child's success or
failure in school. Not only must the
teacher believe in culture, he must
proclaim his faith and fire his pupils
with his own fervour. A teacher without
faith in his vocation may stifle many
young minds for ever. Teaching is
much more than just another job

ON WINGS OF SONG
Sir,
I have been a "Unesco Courier"
reader for over 15 years, but have never
come across articles on singing or
great world singers. I hope that you
will publish an issue devoted to the
role of singing in cultural development.
Your April 1972 issue published a
letter from a reader in the Federal
Republic of Germany, on a pressing
question the uncritical acceptance by
modern culture of the mediocracy. I
fully agree with him that nowadays
"singers with no voice, mouthing
meaningless lyrics, receive the adulation
due to the trained singer of real talent".
An economist by profession, I am
very grateful to one of Moscow's even¬
ing musical schools for adults for open¬
ing to me a boundless world of beauty.
A.I. Popov

AT GRASS ROOTS LEVEL
Sir,
Last July I attended a conference at
Unesco's Paris Headquarters as a
member of a British youth organization
called "Community Service for the
Young European". We heard speakers
talking on Unesco's main concerns and
aims. I was so impressed and stimulat¬
ed by what I heard and saw, and by
the discussions I had with some of
these speakers, that I want to try and
stimulate interest and concern for the
United Nations and the activities of its
various branches, particularly Unesco,
In the University here at Bangor where
I am studying.
If the U.N. aims at an ¡deal of uniting
all people of all nations, then the basis
of interest and activity should be
stimulated at grass roots level. It is
because ordinary people think of the
U.N. and its branches as an inter¬
governmental talk-shop instead of an
international work-shop, that it does
not achieve more and have greater
influence. And I firmly believe that the
mightiest of organizations must have
direct communication with the humblest,
least immediately significant strata of
mankind, to be successful.
I am an insignificant, uninfluential,
penniless and naively idealistic student,
but I want to make a positive, practical
contribution.
Martin Fairbairn
Bangor, North Wales
END OF ART ECLIPSE 7
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" report on new
concepts of education ¡n the November
1972* issue Is, to me, like the sun
appearing after the long eclipse over
the darkened world of education.
I began attending school at the age
of five, and because it was natural for
me to write with my left hand I was
punished and forced to use my right.
I was ridiculed and looked upon as
some kind of freak and the psycho¬
logical effects were severe.
It is only natural then that I should
be especially aware of the magnificent
advances being made In the education
of humanity, mainly as a result of the
co-ordinating efforts of Unesco. The
tragedy is that so few people in North
America are aware of the tremendous
work being done by Unesco.
The effort to eradicate illiteracy sur¬
passes William Wilberforce's lifelong
effort to abolish slavery. Think of it:
a civilization ruled by intellect and not
by armaments. May I wish you success
in your important task.
Robert Donaldson

IN DEFENCE OF PARIS
Sir,
Like all Parisians, and indeed most
French people and visitors to France,
I am profoundly disturbed at the sight
of the modern tower blocks at La
Défense which have destroyed one of
the finest views in the world, along the
broad avenue leading westwards from
the Arc de Triomphe. As they stand,
these towers will cause great harm to
French prestige and to the tourist
industry.

'MAIDEN' Vs. 'ELEPHANT'
This mask from Nigeria is a striking example of traditional art of Black Africa. It rep¬
resents the "Maiden Spirit", symbolizing good, gentleness and beauty and is used in a
ritual dance-drama in opposition to the "Elephant Spirit", representing force and violence.
The mask is now in the Nigerian Museum, in Lagos, Nigeria. The problems of tradi¬
tional Black African culture today in the face of science and modern technology
are discussed in an article on page 24 by Dr. Ali Lankoandé, Professor of Physics at
Ouagadougou, Capital Of Upper Volta. Photo Peccinotti © Mobil. Nigeria
