### 68081: The International Year of Peace

The International Year
of Peace
FORTY years ago, the Second World War came to an end. That
terrible conflict which, for the first time in the history of mankind,
had affected every continent, caused immeasurable destruction and
led to the death or mutilation of tens of millions of persons, ended in Asia
with an event which was in itself an unprecedented warning: the explosion
of the two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
It was immediately clear that the effects of the new weapons could extend
far beyond the field of hostilities themselves and that civilians as well as
military, women and children as well as combattants, would not be spared.
It was in this climate that the United Nations system was created and that
the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization was adopted in London on 16 November 1945.
Unesco was assigned the task of contributing to the establishment of
international peace and the common prosperity of humanity through
co-operation between the nations in the fields of intellectual life. In Léon
Blum's fine words , it was called upon to become the "moral and intellectual
conscience of humanity."
The task was all the more important since the Second World War had
been far more ideological in character than its predecessor. As Unesco's
Constitution states, it had been made possible by "the denial of the
democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men,
and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of
the doctrine of the inequality of men and races".
Accordingly, one of the fundamental tasks assigned to Unesco was to
"develop and to increase the means of communication between... peoples
and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a
truer and more perfect knowledge of each other's lives".
As well as its immediate goals reconciling states of mind that the war
had brought into conflict Unesco was pledged to call into being a veritable
"intellectual and moral solidarity", on a planetary scale, with the aim of
providing a lasting foundation for peace.
In the last four decades, Unesco has striven unremittingly to achieve this
goal. It is largely due to its efforts, and to those of all the organizations
belonging to the United Nations system, that humanity has in many fields
made real progress along the path to solidarity, mutual respect and
understanding.
This is why it is essential, on the occasion of the International Year of
Peace, that intellectuals from all over the world creators and researchers,
writers and artists, scientists and educators should co-operate more fully
with the aim of achieving a clearer perception of international problems
and of thereby helping to encourage all that may lead to a freer and more
peaceful future, in a world of greater solidarity and justice.

### 68083: UNESCO's General Conference

Unesco's General Conference
by Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
THE 23rd Session of Unesco's General Conference, which
met in Sofia from 8 October to 8 November 1 985, was
attended by 154 delegations from Member States, in¬
cluding 98 ministers and 47 persons of ministerial rank. Also
represented were 8 United Nations bodies, 21 international
governmental organizations and 80 non-governmental orga¬
nizations^ a total of almost 1 ,900 participants.
During the Session, notable for intensive and purposeful
activity taking place in a spirit of dialogue and mutual compre¬
hension, the General Conference accomplished the unpre¬
cedented task of approving a programme and budget subject to
a priority system by virtue of which three-quarters of scheduled
activities have been accorded first priority, whilst the remainder
have had to be accorded second priority owing to lack of
financial provision. The budgetary ceiling, defined on these
bases, was unanimously adopted by the States present.
The General Conference also enabled a consensus to be
reached in all the fields of Unesco's activities, notably in those
which, while considered extremely important by the internation¬
al community, had until then aroused certain reservations on
the part of some Member States.
All the major programmes are now the subject of unanimous
agreement, including Major Programme I (Reflection on World
Problems and Future-Oriented Studies), Major Programme III
(Communication in the Service of Man), Major Programme VIII
(Principles, Methods and Strategies of Action for Develop¬
ment), Major Programme XII (The Elimination of Prejudice,
Intolerance, Racism and Apartheid), and Major Programme
XIII (Peace, International Understanding, Human Rights and
the Rights of Peoples).
But Unesco must in the coming years not only continue the
main thrust of its action in all its fields of competence; it must
also break new ground in several increasingly important areas.
Thus the General Conference .decided to draw up as part of
the next Medium-Term Plan, a plan of action to help Member
States to eradicate illiteracy between now and the year 2000.
Agreement was reached on the main lines of a programme for
World Culture Decade.
The General Conference also decided to create an inter¬
governmental programme in informatics, to launch a major new
regional project on the rational use and conservation of water
resources in rural Asia and in the Pacific, and to prepare a
special aid programme for Africa in the fields of scientific and
technological research and of research and development.
The attachment of Member States, and of their educational,
scientific and cultural communities, to multilateral co-operation
was forcefully reaffirmed. Unesco's specific vocation cover¬
ing all aspects of intellectual co-operation was given particu¬
lar endorsement by the Conference. And this vocation was
outstandingly illustrated by the essential role played in the work
of the specialized commissions by experts from different de¬
legations who found constructive and mutually satisfactory
solutions to all the questions they examined.
Finally, the participating delegations emphasized the import¬
ance that should be attached to the preparation of the third
Medium-Term Plan, which will cover the first half of the last
decade of the second millennium. In this perspective, they
stressed the urgent need to engage in fundamental reflection
and, with this in mind, to increase the involvement of the
international intellectual community in all the Organization's
activities.
The results obtained at the Sofia Conference, thanks to
efforts made by all concerned, revealed the great vitality of
Unesco. In spite of the extent of the difficulties which the
Organization must face, the General Conference took up the
challenge and showed itself equal to the situation. It further
enriched the content of a consensus which is one of the golden
rules of international co-operation. And it vigorously expressed
the determination voiced by virtually all Unesco's Member
States to envisage a future in which the Organization's achieve¬
ments will be maintained and its prospects will be renewed.

"The essential nature of the role of the poet and the writerwhich is to communi¬

A library of world classics
by Edouard J. Maunick
AMONG Unesco's fourteen Major Programmes there
is one that affects each one of us in both the most
humdrum aspects of our daily lives and in the most
private recesses of our being. Culture and the Future, as this
programme is called, encompasses every facet of culture and
our cultural heritage, of creation and creativity, and of the
concept today more relevant than ever before of cultural
identity and cultural interrelationships.
The Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar once said that
"what we call culture is basically nothing other than the
presence and the exercise of our identity in all its power".
This presence is rooted in history, knowledge of which is the
point of departure for any consideration of identity. "Know
thyself" remains the golden rule and it is only through
history, through the examination of our roots, that we can
reach down into the depths of our being and discover the
fundaments of our existence in the world.
The subsequent "exercise" or assumption of our identity ^

^ involves the evaluation and re-evaluation of each of those
elements which we recognize as component parts of our
culture. Among those components we could list, our pur¬
pose here is to examine more closely the literary element and
to list and describe what Unesco has achieved in this field
since 1948 through the Unesco Collection of Representative
Works.
This project, whose purpose is to make available in trans¬
lation in two international languages, English and French,
the masterpieces ofworld literature, is a godsend to those for
whom reading is a passion; and for those for whom reading is
a lively interest, what a tempting display it offers of books
whose quality and content can open up hitherto unsuspected
horizons.
There is, however, far more to the Unesco Collection of
Representative Works than these few introductory remarks
suggest. The Collection is central to Unesco's action in
favour of the strengthening of cultural identity and inter-
cultural relations. For there can be no doubt that the peoples
of the world long to reach out beyond the events of their
history of yesterday and today and to discover, behind their
ways and customs, their traditions, beliefs and values, some¬
thing that will better confirm their existence in the world and
consolidate their place in the universal concert.
This should not, however, be taken as indicating a hanker¬
ing after the past, or a rejection of the present and of what
the outside world has to offer. On the contrary, every human
group needs to seek out its roots the better to understand and
to come to terms with the changing contemporary world and
to accept with open arms the riches that stem from rela¬
tionships and exchanges with others. Yet these activities, of
cardinal importance as they are, cannot bear fruit in a
context of conflict. Only peaceful contact between cultures
equally confident of their worth and importance can be
mutually enriching. At a time in history when the atomic
menace hangs over us all and when we run the terrible risk of
seeing the age-old heritage built up by human genius dis¬
appear for ever, this is the objective that Unesco is working
constantly to achieve.
Among the accumulated riches of the past, to which the
present is continuously adding, must be counted the diffe¬
rent literatures from every corner of the globe, an ever-

^ growing treasure that defies quantification. It includes oral
and written literatures covering a broad spectrum: narratives
of all kinds, poems, novels, plays, short stories and other
forms of expression that are often difficult to categorize.
The essential nature of the role of the poet and the
writer which is to communicate and in so doing to bring us
all closer together can never be over-emphasized. The
Unesco Collection of Representative Works is the focal
point at which their works converge so that, after trans¬
lation, they can be made available to the widest possible
audience. For the Collection is not confined to the trans¬
lation, as mentioned above, of originals into English and
French; it also handles translation from one less widely
known language into another. Looking at random through
the catalogue of the Collection we find listed, for example,
translations of the Upanishads (1) from Sanskrit into Ger¬
man, of the writings of the Japanese Yasunari Kawabata (2)
into Indonesian, of the Pakistani poet Ahmed Faïz ^3) from
Urdu into Hungarian and Aristotle's The Constitution of
Athens (4) into Arabic.
One of the objectives of the Collection is to offer the
widest possible range both of works and of languages. At
present it comprises nearly 900 titles from over sixty-five
different literatures and representing around fifty Oriental
languages, twenty European languages as well as a number
of African and Oceanian literatures and languages.
Clearly, the choice of works to appear in the Collection is a
delicate matter. Some literatures have a centuries-old tradi¬
tion, whilst others have emerged only comparatively recent¬
ly. Even if we limit ourselves to listing the works of fun¬
damental value that the countries of the world have to offer,
we are faced with an impressive total of varied titles from
which at times it seems virtually impossible to make a
selection. A number of principles on the basis of which a
choice could be made had to be adopted and rigorously
respected, leaving, nevertheless, a small margin of liberty to
allow for exceptional cases. Generally speaking, new ver¬
sions of translations already published are not undertaken
and it is rare for a budding, little-known contemporary
author with only a small output to his name to be considered
for inclusion. This is because the Collection aims to offer a
representative sample of .works the quality and content of
which meet a number of readily understandable criteria.
Nevertheless, the Collection can claim to have made some
astonishing revelations. Among the authors it has published
in translation are a number who were later to receive the
high distinction of being awarded the Nobel Prize for Liter¬
ature, including the Greek poet George Seferis (5), the
Japanese novelist Yasunari Kawabata (6% and the Spanish
poet Vicente Aleixandre (7).
In practical terms the selection procedure operates as
follows. First of all, the National Commissions for Unesco
established by Member States suggest lists of works which
they consider to be representative of the values of their
cultures. Internationally renowned cultural organizations,
such as the PEN Federation and the International Council
for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies are also called upon
for advice in the establishment of these lists. In addition,
suggestions are received from publishers who are willing to
undertake the translation of particular works which they
consider worthy of a place in the Collection.
Collaboration between publishers and Unesco is of prime
importance. Although, in most cases, it bears the costs of
translation, Unesco is not, strictly speaking, a publisher in
the usual sense, and without this collaboration would find it
difficult to achieve its publishing objectives. Moreover, col¬
laboration of this kind is not easy to establish involving as it
does the publication of works from literatures whose type,
style, form of expression and content are unusual if not
entirely unknown to the English- and French-speaking
public.
Two years ago, it was agreed that Unesco's name should
appear alongside that of its publisher partner on the cover of
each volume published. Previously, with the exception of the
Connaissance de l'Orient series, published by Gallimard
under the direction of Professor Etiemble (see article oppo¬
site page), Unesco's financial and technical contribution had
been indicated only by a brief formula of association printed
on the back of the title page.
Year after year, new publishers come to swell the ranks of
those who have for long collaborated in producing the
Collection. New projects are born and must be fostered,
mobilizing goodwill wherever it can be found. Each new
work added to the catalogue brings its reward the satisfac¬
tion of knowing that a wider public will have a greater
opportunity to read what the "other" has written, to discover
that "other" through the pages of a book, to get closer to
him, to know him better, even to become his friend. Each
project that succeeds such as the recent creation of a new,
Gallimard-Unesco paperback series of reprinted titles from
the Connaissance de l'Orient series is one step further
towards encounter and dialogue.
International, multilingual, and pluricultural, the Unesco
Collection of Representative Works is, in effect, a library of
libraries. Yet it has another distinguishing feature a special
concern for poetry. As everyone is aware, poetry is in¬
creasingly becoming the poor relation of the publishing
world. With the aim of redressing the balance the Collection
has given pride of place to poetry. It includes over a hundred
anthologies and selections of diverse and varied inspiration.
These include: classical Chinese poetry (8); Persian poetry of
the eleventh to the twentieth century (9); the Thai popular
poem The Woman, the Hero and the Villain (10); the poems
of the Honduran poet Roberto Sosa (11); the selected poems
of Octavio Paz ( ^ ; Words ofParadise (Poetry ofPapua New
Guinea) (13); The Life and Songs of the Yoga Brug-pa Kun-
legs le Yogin ^14), translated from Tibetan; Three Contem¬
porary Japanese Poets: Anzai Hitoshi, Shiraishi Kazuko,
Tanikawa Shuntaro (15); Bengali mystic poems ^16); the
poems of the Aztecs ^17); The Beautiful Scarecrow, poetry
for children by the Bulgarian Leda Mileva (18); works of the
Finnish poet Markku Lahtela (19); an Anthology ofAncient
Nordic Poetry (from the Beginnings up to the Middle
Ages) (20)- Vita Nova (21), by Dante Alighieri; the
Lusiadas <-2T>, by the Portuguese national poet Luis de
Camoes; an anthology of Arabic poetry (23:); a selection of
Korean poetry (24) (translated into both English and
French); Volumes III, IV, V and VI of Half a Century of
Poetry, (25) an anthology of poetic creation from 1900 to
1950, published in collaboration with La Maison du Poète,
Belgium, comprising a selection from the works of 300 poets
from over 150 countries.
This introduction to the Unesco Collection of Representa¬
tive Works would not be complete without grateful mention
of the special financial contributions made by Japan, the
Republic of Korea and the Gulbenkian Foundation to the
Collection's translation programme, and of Unesco's fruitful
collaboration with the International Federation of Trans¬
lators and the International Association of Literary Critics.
Translation, of course, is the cornerstone of all the activi¬
ties described above and its vital role can, perhaps, best be
summed up by quoting these words by Jean Cocteau: "It is
supremely difficult to achieve mutual understanding on our
earth, where languages erect insurmountable barriers be¬
tween works. Translation is something more than a mar¬
riage. It should be a love-match."
EDOUARD J. MAUNICK, Mauritian poet, is chief of the section for the
dissemination of cultures at Unesco and director of the Unesco Collection
of Representative Works. He is the author of several books of poetry
including Ensoleillé Vif (preface by LS. Senghor; Apollinaire Prize, 1976),
En Mémoire du Mémorable (1979) and Désert-Archipel, followed by Can¬
tate Païenne pour Jésus-Fleuve (1983).

### 68100: Knowledge of the Orient': an imaginative publishing project in partnership with UNESCO

'Knowledge of the Orient'
An imaginative publishing project
in partnership with Unesco
by Etiemble
IT is a Saturday towards the end of
November 1985 and my desk is lit¬
tered with a dozen or so press cut¬
tings. All of them, without exception, en¬
thuse about the publication, at last, of the
first six re-issues of the Connaissance de
l'Orient ("Knowledge of the Orient")
Series, agreeably presented at a price
affordable by the interested but less well-
off readers often the most zealous in
their thirst for knowledge. Indian,
Chinese and Japanese authors are rep¬
resented in this first batch of re-issues, to
be followed next Spring by an equally
rich, successful and well-produced batch
of masterpieces.
So this seems an appropriate moment
for me to recount how and why I was led,
inexorably, to launch this Series, which
has received the generous support of
Unesco, and why I should never have
been able to guide it, successfully I hope,
without the vigilant backing of this often
misjudged organization.
No sooner had I arrived in Paris, in
1927, to enter the hypokhâgne (the pre¬
paratory class for those wishing to enter
the prestigious Ecole Normale Supér¬
ieure) of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, than I
began to spend the greater part of my
leisure hours in bookshops which, in

Considered to be one of the masters of
Japanese prose, lhara Saikaku (1647-
1693) was the creator of the realistic story
in Japan. Several of his works have been
translated into French and English in the
Unesco Collection. Above, illustration
from a French version of Koshoku Gonin
(1689), published in the Connaissance de

those happy times, allowed students with
open minds but empty pockets to browse
at will through the books that interested
them. I divided my time between three
such understanding bookshops, reading
twenty pages in one, thirty in another and
ten in the third, and buying, each time
that this was possible, one of those
books I had already read but which I
wanted to keep for my future library.
As you can imagine, young provincial
as I then was, guided, or rather mis¬
guided until then by two schoolmasters
whose religious fanaticism limited their
literary repertoire to Bossuet, Pascal and
Thomas Aquinas, I threw myself into the
reading of the Manu-smrti (the Sanskrit
code of law), the Life of the Buddha and
Soulié de Morant's two-volume study on
Confucius.
Subsequently, when this young pro¬
vincial, newly-arrived at the Rue d'Ulm
(the site of the Ecole Normale Supér¬
ieure), was asked by the director of liter¬
ary studies, Monsieur Célestin Bougie,
for which higher degree he intended to
study, he. replied: "Philosophy". To the
further astonishment of Monsieur Boug¬
ie, the impudent young man added:
"This, of course, means that I shall enroll
immediately at the School of Oriental
Languages and for all the classes of ad¬
vanced Chinese studies, since it seems
to me to be unthinkable to aspire to a
higher degree in philosophy which cov¬
ers only European philosophy.
Moreover, the better to understand the
relationship between moral philosophy
and law I shall also enroll at the Faculty of
Law."
Considering me to be unbalanced,
Monsieur Bougie promptly enrolled me
for a grammar degree, saying: "The
Textes Sacrés et Textes Profanes de l'An¬
cienne Egypte, Des Pharaons et des
Hommes ("Sacred and Profane Texts of
Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs and Men") was
published in 1984 in the Connaissance de
l'Orient series (see article) and the Unesco
Collection of Representative Works. This
anthology of texts, many previously un¬
published, sheds much light on ancient
Egyptian society and ways of living. Left,
weighing the heart ofa corpse, an illustra¬
tion from the Book of the Dead, one of the
major works of Egyptian literature and of
the world literary heritage.

^ grammar candidates are mediocre and
you might manage to get your degree; I
wouldn't give much for your chances in
philosophy, if you are hoping to cope not
only with the Asian philosophies but with
law, including Roman law which also
forms part of the degree course!"
I am glad now that I was thrown thus
unceremoniously into the deep end of
grammar. I revelled in the study of the
comparative grammar of the Indo-Euro¬
pean languages, which gave me a taste
for many different literatures. As the
years passed I became infatuated with
Japan, and, in 1934, as a New Year's
Day present, I treated myself to a copy of
the Haikai (short poems) of Kikaku.
In 1943, after a period spent in the
United States with the Navajo and Hopi
Indians, at a time when Rommel and his
Afrika Korps were in retreat towards
Libya, I was invited to Alexandria by that
great Egyptian man of letters Taha Hus¬
sein to head the first Department of
French and Latin at the university of
which he was the Rector. A month in
Martinique and Guadeloupe was fol¬
lowed by a long voyage under the con¬
stant menace of Nazi submarines, then
three months in Algeria waiting for the
aeroplane that would, finally, wing me to
the Valley of the Nile. Then followed Lux¬
or, Karnak and, later, Lebanon.
On the ship which was carrying me to
my new post at the leisurely pace im¬
posed by the convoy system, I spent my
time making my first incursions into Ara¬
bic. I was fascinated by Taha Hussein, as
well as by Tawfiq Al-Hakim, Bishr Faris
and Hussein Fawzi. In particular, Taha
Hussein revealed to me Ibn Khaldun, the
true father of sociology.
Some years later I began working with
the French publishers Gallimard on the

to the modern conception of the dissemi¬

CARPENTER Shih went to Ch'i and, when he got to
Crooked Shaft, he saw a serrate oak standing by the
village shrine. It was broad enough to shelter several
thousand oxen and measured a hundred spans around,
towering above the hills. The lowest branches were eighty
feet from the ground, and a dozen or so of them could have
been made into boats. There were so many sightseers that
the place looked like a fair, but the carpenter didn't even
glance around and went on his way without stopping. His
apprentice stood staring for a long time and then ran after
Carpenter Shih and said, "Since I first took up my ax and
followed you, Master, I have never seen timber as beautiful
as this. But you don't even bother to look, and go right on
without stopping. Why is that?"
"Forget it say no more!" said the carpenter. "It's a
worthless tree! Make boats out of it and they'd sink; make
coffins and they'd rot in no time; make vessels and they'd
break at once. Use it for doors and it would sweat sap like
pine; use it for posts and the worms would eat them up. It's
not a timber tree there's nothing it can be used for. That's
how it got to be that old!"
After Carpenter Shih had returned home, the oak tree
appeared to him in a dream and said, "What are you
comparing me with? Are you comparing me with those
useful trees? The cherry apple, the pear, the orange, the
citron, the rest of those fructiferous trees and shrubs as
soon as their fruit is ripe, they are torn apart and subjected to
abuse. Their big limbs are broken off, their little limbs are
yanked around. Their utility makes life miserable for them,
and so they don't get to finish out the years Heaven gave
them, but are cut off in mid-journey. They bring it on
themselves the pulling and tearing of the common mob.
And it's the same way with all other things.
"As for me, I've been trying a long time to be of no use,
and though I almost died, I've finally got it. This is of great
use to me. If I had been of some use, would I ever have
grown this large? Moreover you and I are both of us things.
What's the point of this things condemning things? You, a
worthless man about to die how do you know I'm a worth¬
less tree?"
When Carpenter Shih woke up, he reported his dream.
His apprentice said, "If it's so intent on being of no use,
what's it doing there at the village shrine?"
"Shhh! Say no more! It's only resting there. If we carp and
criticize, it will merely conclude that we don't understand it.
Even if it weren't at the shrine, do you suppose it would be
cut down? It protects itself in a different way from ordinary
people. If you try to judge it by conventional standards,
you'llbewayoff!"

compatriots, rather than waste their time
on fashionable trifles, to read master¬
pieces of the highest civilizations, pre¬
sented in all their most diverse forms:
from India, Sukasaptati (Les Contes du
Perroquet) and Shrikanto; from China,
works of Chuang-tzu (see extract p. 11)
and Lieh-tzu(1), as well as Récits d'une

Clochard ("Wanderings of a Tramp") Liu
Ngo's masterpiece, not forgetting, of
course, Le Rêve dans le Pavillon Rouge
("The Dream of the Red Chamber") by
Cao Xueqin.
One problem, however, still preoccu¬
pied me. To fulfil my own dearest wishes
and those of Unesco, those volumes now
sold out in their original, highly-priced
printing would have to be re-issued in a
fine new Series which would be cheaper
but even more attractive than the Folio
paperback edition, since it would be a
matter of reprinting masterpieces chosen
from among masterpieces.
When Moenis Taha Hussein, the man
responsible for the Series at Unesco (it
was his father who had introduced me to
the writings of Ibn Khaldûn, Al-Ma'arri,
Al-Mutanabbi and others), reached the
age of retirement, I discussed the situa¬
tion with his successor and was happily
surprised to learn that he had already
persuaded Antoine Gallimard to reprint,
in an attractive new series (format,
covers, paper, inks all play their part)
those titles that are out of print but which
cannot, at present, be reprinted in the
original series, but which in this way will
be ensured a wider dissemination.
Now, it is precisely the aim of Unesco
and of myself to offer to cultures perhaps
a little too closed in on themselves the
keys to such works as the Vedic
Hymns{2), the Secret Traditions of the
A/o(3), by Zeami, the Pillow-Book of Sei
Shonagon (see extract page 14), the
Vetala-pancavimsatikaw, Chuang-tzu's
Complete Works, and the marvelous
Song of the Road (5), on which Satyajit
Ray based his film Pather Panchali,
which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1956, the year in which I
launched the Series for the benefit of the
French-reading world.
To be honest, when people ask me:
"What do you consider to be your
greatest achievement?", I reply: "The
garden which, with my wife Jeannine, I
designed, planted and have maintained
since 1953; and since 1956, the Con¬
naissance de /'Or/enfSeries." B

### 68102: The Originality of Japanese literature

The originality of Japanese
literature
Awhole series of paradoxes has
given Japanese literature a
unique place in the history of
world culture. But its distinctiveness does
not isolate it: we need only consider Lady
Murasaki's The Tale of Genji,w which
dates from the beginning of the eleventh
century and which is a delight to read, not
only for specialists in classical Japanese
literature or even just for lovers of things
Japanese, but also for all who are in¬
terested in the structure of the novel, and,
more generally, in psychological rela¬
tionships as these can be depicted by a
novelist.
The Tale ofGenji, which is surprisingly
modern in its style of narration, has two
altogether remarkable features. Firstly,
although it appeared at the dawn of writ¬
ten Japanese culture, it is a novel;
secondly, its author is a woman. These
two characteristics in themselves reveal
the amazing originality of Japanese liter¬
ature: it starts with the genre which, in all
other cultures, is a late development,
and, moreover, women are not only im¬
mediately accepted in literature, but are
in the vanguard. This novel was pre¬
ceded by collections of poetry, historical
and mythological chronicles and folk
tales, but there is no comparable exam¬
ple of such an early emergence of the
novel genre in literary history.
The "court diaries" of the Heian period
(794-1185) herald or echo this
achievement, in which another special
feature should be noted: the drifting of
the story between poetry and prose, with
many waka (poems of thirty-one sylla¬
bles) breaking up the steady pace of the
narrative. Although classical Japanese

Botchan, published in the Unesco Collec¬

presents difficulties for twentieth-century
Japanese readers, and although these
diaries require translation into modern
parlance, it is astonishing how close this
world of "court ladies" seems to us. Why
do we recognize ourselves in Izumi Shiki-
bu, in Michitsuna's mother and in Sei
Shonagon? Why do the notions of the
ephemeral, the world's inconstancy, and
nostalgic longing still touch a nerve in us?
These earliest introspective narratives,
in their sumptuous setting and in the
hierarchical world of the court, also
speak with a personal voice that is
timeless.
The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon
(c.966-early eleventh century; see ex¬
tract overleaf) or, later, in the Kamakura
period (1 185-1333), the Hôjôki, still have
a sort of transparency and self-evidence
that enable their authors to show us
ourselves whether the character is an
abandoned woman or a hermit lost in the
mountains. This intimacy, which spans

### 68102: The Originality of Japanese literature

The Tale of the Lady Ochikubo (Ochikubo-
monogatari), Is one of the earliest novels
of the Heian period (794-1185), the golden
age of Japanese literature. Written by an
anonymous 10th-century author, the
novel Is a precursor of the Cinderella
story. Above, cover illustration of an

the centuries, will continue to be found in
the most modern works of literature. The
introspective novels of the early twen¬
tieth century, despite major historical and
linguistic upheavals, undoubtedly bear
witness to that rare homogeneity. We
read the masterpieces of Natsumé Sôse-
ki (1867-1 91 6)(2) or Nagai Kafû (1879-
1959)<3) as a natural continuation of
those which went before. Moreover,
these two authors, like the later Tanizaki
Junichiro (1 886-1 965)(4) are constantly
inquiring into their relations with the past,
not because of a backward-looking or
traditionalist frame of mind, which would
threaten to cast a blight of sterility on their
writing, but out of a desire to discover the
roots of their unity of inspiration.
Post-war writers such as Abe Kôbô(5)
have, indeed, invented a new language
that they use to express the rich patterns
of historical change; but I do not believe
that there will ever be a renunciation of
the past, since the seeds of modernity
were already there in the early writings,
irrespective of the genre to which they
belonged.
From whatever angle we approach
Japanese literature, and whichever
genre we find immediately attractive,
whether No plays orjôruri, haiku or waka,
tales or religious writings, adventure stor¬
ies or chronicles of war, and whichever
literary personality we find fascinating,
Basho(6) or Saikaku(7), Dôgen or
Zeami(8), one thing is certain: no choice
is ever exclusive for those who are in¬
terested in this literature, and the "narrow
road" of the poet leads leads through a
thousand years of wonders.
RENE DE CECCATTY, French novelist and
translator, is literary advisor to the Paris pub¬
lishing house of Gallimard and a contributor to
many literary magazines. He has edited an

Japanese into French.


### 68121: Winds

Winds
by Sei Shonagon
A stormy wind. At dawn, when one is lying in bed with
the lattices and panelled doors wide open, the wind
suddenly blows into the room and stings one's face
most delightful.
A cold, wintry wind.
In the Third Month the moist, gentle wind that blows in
the evenings moves me greatly.
Also moving is the cool, rainy wind in the Eighth and
Ninth Months. Streaks of rain are blown violently from the
side, and I enjoy watching people cover their stiff robes of
unlined silk with the padded coats that they put away after
the summer rains. In this season they would like to dispense
even with their unlined robes, which have become quite
sweltering; instead they are caught off guard by the sudden
change in weather and have to dress still more warmly than
before.
Towards the end of the Ninth Month and the beginning of
the Tenth the sky is clouded over, there is a strong wind , and
the yellow leaves fall gently to the ground, especially from
the cherry trees and the elms. All this produces a most
pleasant sense of melancholy. In the Tenth Month I love
gardens that are full of trees.
On the day after a fierce autumn wind everything moves
one deeply. The garden is in a pitiful state with all the
bamboo and lattice fence knocked over and lying next to
each other on the ground. It is bad enough if the branches of
one of the great trees have been broken by the wind; but it is
a really painful surprise to find that the tree itself has fallen
down and is now lying flat over the bush-clover and the
valerians. As one sits in one's room looking out, the wind, as
though on purpose, gently blows the leaves one by one
through the chinks of the lattice-window, and one finds it
hard to believe that this is the same wind which yesterday
raged so violently.
On one such morning I caught sight of a woman creeping
out from the main hall and emerging a few feet on to the
veranda. I could see that she was a natural beauty. Over a
dress of dull purple she wore an unlined robe of tawny cloth
and a formal robe of some light material. The noise of the
wind must have kept her awake during the night and she had
just got up after sleeping late. Now she knelt on the veranda
and looked into her mirror. With her long hair being blown
about and gently puffed up by the wind, she was a truly
splendid sight. As she gazed at the scene of desolation in the
garden, a girl of about seventeen not a small girl, but still
not big enough to be called grown-up joined her on the
veranda. She wore a night-dress of light violet and over that a
faded blue robe of stiff silk, which was badly coming apart at
the seams and wet from the rain. Her hair, which was cut
evenly at the ends like miscanthus in a field, reached all the
way down to her feet, falling on to the veranda beyond the
bottom of her robe. Looking at her from the side, I could
make out the scarlet of her trouser-skirt, the only bright
touch in her costume.
In the garden a group of maids and young girls were
collecting the flowers and plants that the wind had torn up by
the roots and were propping up some that were less
damaged. Several women were gathered in front of me by
the blind, and I enjoyed seeing how envious they looked as
they watched the young people outside and wished that they
might join them.

### 68103: African voices

African voices
by Sophie Bessis
SINCE it was supposed to have no
history and, apart from a few in¬
teresting customs, scarcely any
civilization, Africa was long thought to
have no literature. But through contact
with "the white man's school" a number
of writers emerged during this century
and gradually imposed themselves. This
movement may perhaps be said to have
begun with Batouala, the "negro novel"
by the West Indian René Maran who won
the Goncourt Prize in 1921. It continued
with Leopold Sédar Senghor and Ama¬
dou Hampâté Bâ and expanded with the
coming of age of the post-independence
generations, leading to a flowering of
talent in poetry and the novel in the pre¬
sent decade. The existence in Africa of a

plentiful and varied literature in which
there is no lack of talent is now beyond
dispute.
While African literature was gaining its
letters of nobility and a degree of interna¬
tional recognition, its range was also
widening with the realization that the writ¬
ten word was not the only medium for
works of literature. Initially thanks to the
perseverance of a few, and later because
of a growing awareness of its extraordin¬
ary richness, oral literature began to be
collected, recorded in writing and in
some cases translated into major world
languages. Thus, entire civilizations with
their creation myths and epics made their
entry into world literature, from which
they had previously been excluded be-

cause of their oral form and because the
languages to which they belonged were
not widely known. The time will soon
come if it has not arrived already
when a person cannot claim to be culti¬
vated unless he or she is familiar with the
epics of the Mandingo or the Mvet.
In this context, the Unesco Collection
of Representative Works is playing a role
which it intends to develop further. In the
first place, an incomparable information
network enables it to identify from among
recently discovered epic and mythologic¬
al tales as well as from contemporary
writings those works which deserve to be
included in the world pantheon of liter¬
ature. Even more important, it can trans¬
mit them beyond the relatively limited
readerships of local languages by having
them translated into major world lan¬
guages.
Several translations have already
been produced, and French-speaking
readers now have access to the sacred
texts of Black Africa'1 >, accounts of their
African travels by a number of Mediterra¬
nean writers and, more recently, to the
Song of Lawino by the Ugandan poet
Okot P'Bitek (see extract below), which
has been translated from Acholi. For En¬
glish-speaking readers there is a series
of the great Zulu epics collected by Maz-
isi Kunene(2), as well as anthologies of
African prose and poetry(3). The Fan-
tang, a mystical poem of the Peul
shepherds and a masterpiece of the oral
tradition, and the Samba Gueladiegni,
translated from Wolof, will also soon be
available in French.
It is to be hoped that Unesco as it has
already done for other works will pro¬
duce translations of certain works from
their national languages into other, not
necessarily international, languages. By
doing so it would fulfil one of its purposes,
that of widening contacts between diffe¬
rent cultures.

### 68124: The Song of Lawino

The Song ofLawino by okot p'Bitek
My husband read much, with the Whites,
He has read everything, in depth,
He is as learned as the Whites,
But reading
has done for him.
It has cut him off from his people,
He is like a trunk
Without roots.
He runs down everything Acholi,
He says
That the customs of the Blacks
Are black
Because his eyes have burst,
And he wears black glasses,
And at his house
It is as black as in a forest!
My husband's house
Is a forest of books!
Some of them are immense,
As big as
Tido trees.
There are old ones
Whose bark is falling off,
And which smell strong,
There are thin, soft ones,
And others whose backs
Are as hard as the rocky trunk of the Poi tree.
Some are green,
Some are blood red,
Others black and oily,
With spines that shine
Like the poisonous ororo snake
Coiled at the top of a tree.
Some have pictures on their backs,
Dead faces of men and women who look like sorcerers,
Unshaven, proud, pot-bellied men,
Or hollow-cheeked, sullen and vengeful-looking,
Pictures of men and women
Long dead.
My husband's desk is covered
With a frightening pile of papers.
They look like the giant climbing plants of the forest
Or the Kituba tree
That smothers other trees to death.
Some stand on end,
Others lie on their backs.
They are all mixed together
Like the legs of young people
Dancing the orak,
Or the feet of planks
In a goggo fence.
They are jumbled together
Like the legs of giant climbing plants
In the impenetrable forest.
My husband's house
Is an immense forest of books.
It is dark, everything is sodden.
A hot, thick, poisoned vapour
Rises from the ground
And mixes with the penetrating damp of the air
And the raindrops gathered on the leaves.
You smother
If you stay there long.
It ruins your nose and your tongue,
So that you can no longer
Savour the refreshing odour of sesame oil
Or the taste of malakwang.

Acholi into French by Frank and Henriette Gauduchon and pub¬

Tradition and experiment
in Arabic letters
by Abdellatif Laabi
THE world audience reached by
Arab literature has not always
been commensurate with the im¬
portance and originality of an ancient
literary tradition that is still very much
alive.
This literature is still widely regarded
as a domain for scholars and those who
are, for a variety of reasons, "lovers" of
. "-
the Arab world. In other words, although
it is acknowledged to have a prestigious
past, it is not so often recognized as
forming part of the contemporary literary
scene.
The Unesco Programme for the Trans¬
lation of Literary Works can make a big
contribution to re-establishing the dia¬
logue. Making national literatures known ^

Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) was one of the
greatestphilosophers of Islam. Convinced
that it was impossible to achieve certainty
by reason alone, he wrote a celebrated
treatise, Tahafut al-falasifa (The Incoher¬
ence of the Philosophers), to refute the
certainties of the philosophers ofhis time.
His work was in its turn attacked by Ibn
Rushd (Averroës) in his Tahafut al-tahafut
(The Incoherence of the Incoherence),
which has been translated Into English in
the Unesco Collection (1954). Several of
Al-Ghazali's works have been published in
the Collection in English, French and Spa¬
nish, including the mystical autobiogra¬
phy he wrote shortly before his death,
Erreur et Délivrance ("Error and Deliver¬
ance") published in French in 1959.
Above, the first page of a 13th-century
Persian manuscript ofa workbyAl-Ghaza¬
li, "The Way to Happiness", which illus¬
trated a posterdesignedbyAli Sarmadi for
a Round Table devoted to Al-Ghazali held
under Unesco auspices in Paris on 9 and
10 December 1985.
^ in major world languages is perhaps one
of the soundest ways of building bridges
between different cultural regions and
communicating specific visions of the
world to humanity as a whole.
In quantitative terms at least, Unesco's
achievements with regard to Arab
thought and literature are somewhat
modest. Some forty works have been
translated from Arabic into English,
French, German and Spanish, since the
programme was launched in the early
1950s.
But this effort has been concentrated
on the great masterpieces of Arab liter¬
ature, and it has speeded up consider¬
ably since the late 1970s.
Although initially priority was given to
the classical heritage and to its undis¬
puted masterpieces, modern and even
avant-garde literature has since been in¬
cluded. Thus the catalogue of the Un¬
esco Collection of Representative Works
enables the interested reader to travel
widely in the realms of Arab literature.
First, a tour in the strict geographical
sense, with the "Travels of Ibn
Batutah" (1) and "The Configuration of
the Earth" by Ibn Hauqal (2). These
travellers' accounts are far from being of
merely technical interest. In the Arab tra¬
dition, they are part of a special literary
genre, the Rihla (itinerary or journey) in
which the explorer also displays his liter¬
ary, historical and philosophical culture.
Next, a historical tour with Ibn Khal-
dûn's Muqaddimah ("Discourse on the
History of the Universe") (3). This is an
essential work whose contribution to
contemporary historical and sociological
thought on both sides of the Mediterra¬
nean has not yet been exhausted.
Thanks to the Muqadimmah, a work of
universal scope, a breakthrough was
made in the Arab and Maghreb context in
reinterpreting history with the aid of an
appropriate methodology.
A tour in the realm of pure thought with
the philosophical works of AI Farabi (4),
Ibn Rushd (Averroës) (5), Ibn Sina
(Avicenna) <6) and Al-Ghazali <7)think¬
ers nourished on Greek philosophy,
synthesists who transformed the so-
called age of the "Arab miracle" into an
era of light which continued to shine until
the time of the Western Renaissance.
And finally, in the strictly literary field, in
the works of the classical period, the
most outstanding of which is undoubted¬
ly "The Book of Misers" by AI Gahiz (8).
The Arab La Bruyère, although even
more witty, this man of encyclopaedic
culture died under an avalanche of the
books that packed his library. It was
through AI Gahiz that Arab prose re¬
ceived its letters of nobility no mean
achievement in view of the prestige and
supremacy of poetry in Arab literature,
from its origins until our own day. The
Maqamat ("Assemblies") of Al-Hariri (9),
which have been translated into German,
played a comparable role. They include
elements of the novel form which were
highly appreciated during the classical
period but which are not exploited to any
great extent by contemporary Arab
writers.
But however great its prestige, this
classical literature should not eclipse
twentieth-century Arab literature. New
literary genres have been developed,
especially in the novel, but poetry has
also evolved, gradually breaking away
from the constraints imposed by the rigid
forms of the qacida (poem).
It is perhaps in the Arab novel, which is
no more than fifty years old, that the signs
Taha Hussein (1889-1973) was one of the
leading figures of the modern movement
in Egyptian literature. The author of
poems, short stories and many essays on
political and social themes, he wrote an
autobiographyAl-Ayyam (Eng. trans., part
i, An Egyptian Childhood, 1932, andpart ii,
The Stream of Days, 1943) which was the
first contemporary Arabic literary work to
win acclaim in the West. Throughout his
life he sought to reconcile the exigencies
of classical Arabic literature and Western
cultural values. Extracts from his writings
have been published in the Unesco Collec¬
tion in French under the title Au-delà du Nil
(1977, "Beyond the Nile"). Above, photo
portrait of Taha Hussein appeared on the
cover of Mudhakkirat, a volume of
memoirs he published In 1967.
of change are most evident. For the Arab
writer, the novel is still an unexplored
continent and one would like to see Un¬
esco extend its efforts beyond the trans¬
lation of a handful of works by Tawfiq al
Hakim <10), Yusuf ldris(11) and Taha
Hussein (12). The works of such writers
as Najib Mahfuz and Tayeb Salih fully
deserve to be as well known as those, for
example, of the great Latin American
novelists.
There is a similar gap where pre-lsla-
mic and classical Arabic poetry is concer¬
ned. But the special attention given to
modern poetry, with translations of the
works of Adonis (13), Badr Shaker As-
Sayyab <14) and Mahmud Darwish (15), is
a cause for satisfaction. These count
amongst the founders of a school of Ara¬
bic poetry that is rooted in the heritage
but is also open to contemporary poetical
experiment.
ABDELLATIF LAABI is a Moroccan poet who
has translated many literary works from Arabic
into French, mainly for Unesco. He is the author
of a novel, Le Chemin des Ordalies (1982),
volumes of poetry including Le Règne de la
Barbarie (1980) and Sous la Bâillon, le Poème
(1981), and collections of essays, the most re¬
cent being La Brûlure de l'Interrogatoire (1985).

### 68125: The Citadel of Aleppo

The citadel ofAleppo
by Ibn Batutah
FROM Sermin we proceeded to Haleb (Aleppo), a
large city and splendid metropolis. This is how
Abulhossein the son of Jobeir described it: This city is
of enormous worth and its fame will last forever. Kings have
often sought to possess it and men have been impressed by its
importance. What a number of battles it has provoked, and
what a quantity of shining words have been unsheathed for
it! Its fortress is renowned for its power and its height is
clearly to be seen. No one dared attack it because of its
strength, or if they did they did not conquer it. The sides are
of freestone and its proportions are full of symmetry. It has
outlasted the days and the years and has seen nobles and
beggars carried to their last resting-places. Where are the
Hamdanite princes and their poets now? They are no more,
and only the buildings remain. Oh wonderful city! It en¬
dures, but its owners have passed on. They have perished but
its hour has not come. It was sought for after them and taken
without great difficulty. It was coveted and won at the
smallest cost. Such is this city of Aleppo. How many of its
kings has it not changed into a past tense (expression bor¬
rowed from grammar) and how many vicissitudes has it not
defied because of its position! Its name was made in the
feminine gender, it was adorned with the finery of a chaste
virgin, it succumbed to the victor as others have done. It
shone like a young bride after the sword (seif) of its dynasty,
Ibn Hamdan (a reference to Prince Seif eddaoulah). Alas! its
youth will pass, it will be no longer desired, only a short while
and it will be destroyed.
The fortress of Aleppo is called Ashshahba (the grey one).
Within it there are two wells from which water gushes, and
there is no fear of thirst there. The castle is surrounded by
two walls, there is a great moat from which water rises, and
its wall has many towers standing close together. This for¬
tress encloses marvellous chambers pierced with windows.
All the towers are occupied and in this fortified castle food is
not impaired by the passage of time.
There is a sanctuary which is visited by many people, and it
is said that Abraham prayed there to God. This fortress
resembles the one called Rahbet (square of) Malik Ibn
Thaouk, near the Euphrates, between Syria and Iraq. When
the Tartar tyrant Kazan marched against the city of Aleppo,
he besieged this fortress for many days. Then, frustrated in
his desire to take it, he withdrew.
Ibn Jozay says: Alkhalidy, the poet of Seif eddaoulah,
writes as follows about this fortress -
With its high belfry and invincible flanks, it is a vast, grim
place which rises up against him who would take it.
The atmosphere spreads a layer ofcloud over this place and
adorns the castle with a necklace of brilliant stars.
When lightning flashes in the night this fortress appears
through its interstices, shining like the constellation of the
Virgo through the openings in the clouds.
How many armies has this castle not destroyed and how
many conquerors has it not put to flight!
The same poet also speaks of the castle in the following
admirable verses:
It is a citadel whose base embraces the springs ofwater, and
its summit is higher than Orion's Belt.
It knows no rain, because for it the clouds are a ground,
whose sides are trodden by its cattle.
When the cloud has given water in abundance, he who lives
in the fortress uses all the water in his tanks before its summits
are moistened.
Its belvedere would be counted amongst the stars of the
heavens if it passed through their orbits.
The cunning of this fortress has repulsed the tricks of its
enemies and the evils it caused were greater than theirs.
Here is what Jemal eddin Ali, the son of Abulmansur, has
to say about this castle:
Because of its enormous height and the point which its
summit attains, this castle nearly stops the celestial sphere that
turns around the earth.
Its inhabitants have gone to the Milky Way as to a watering-
place and their horses have nibbled the stars as though grazing
on flowering plants.
The vicissitudes of time turn from it in fear, and for this
castle there is no change. ,
Extract from The Travels of Ibn Batutah, the French translation of
which, by C. Defremey and B.R. Sanguinetti (1854), was reissued,
with a preface by Vincent Monteil, in the Unesco Collection in 1 979.

### 68105: Northern lights: the writers of Scandinavia

Northern lights :
the writers of Scandinavia
by Jean-Clarence Lambert
Above, jacket Illustration orThe Bleaching
Yard (Bleikeplassen) a work by the Norwe¬
gian novelist Tarjei Vesaas (1897-1970) in
which the hero is driven by obscure inner
forces to commit irreparable acts. In addi¬
tion to this translation published in 1981,
two other novels by Vesaas have been
published in the Collection in English: The
Ice Palace (ls-slottet) and Spring Night.
One of the author's finest novels, Fuglane
(1957) appeared in the Collection in French
in 1975 under the title Les Oiseaux ("The
Birds").
Right, King Olaf triumphs over the Ogress
of the Seas, cover illustration of La Cloche
d'Islande. This French version of the novel
Islandsklukkan (1943) by Halldor Laxness
(Nobel Prize for Literature 1955) was pub¬
lished in the Unesco Collection in 1979. It
forms part of a trilogy set in the 17th cen¬
tury when Iceland was under Danish
domination and, in a style close to that of
the ancient sagas, evokes the coming of
independence.
SCANDINAVIAN literature is both
little-known and misunderstood. It
was written in minor languages
and for long it was read only by a handful
of specialists.
It was not until the second half of the
nineteenth century with the arrival of the
Ibsen/Strindberg generation that Scan¬
dinavian literature came to the forefront
of the European literary scene. Transla¬
tions of their works into the major lan¬
guages proliferated, although, as was
only to be expected, the selection of
works translated was haphazard. Many
inexplicable gaps remain which must at
all costs be filled.
A great deal more has still to be done.
Little Iceland has an impressive literature
dating back to the Middle- Ages. After a
period of decline starting in the fifteenth
century it has experienced a miraculous
renaissance in the twentieth century.
Norwegian literature, which dates back a
mere two centuries, nevertheless burst
upon the world with an immediate, strik¬
ing impact. Danish and Swedish litera¬
ture goes back a century further and
indeed includes a number of even older
works of considerable importance,
although these were mainly written in
Latin. The literature of Finland, which is
written in both Swedish and Finnish,
dates from the Romantic period. Here we
have five different literatures which
together form an imposing new mountain
range in the literary landscape. The more
we explore it the more we become aware
of its density, its complexity and its rich
originality.

### 68105: Northern lights: the writers of Scandinavia

The volumes published in translation
with the aid of Unesco seem to me, for
the most part, to be fitting staging-points
in this journey of exploration. The Un¬
esco Collection would, perhaps, benefit
from a more clearly mapped out route
which would make it possible to establish
the links between the various works that
have been translated. Among the works
translated into French one would like to
see Renauld-Krantz's invaluable Antho¬
logie de la Poésie Nordique Ancienne
("Anthology of Ancient Nordic Poetry",
Paris, 1 964) and my own Anthologie de
la Poésie Suédoise ("Anthology of
Swedish Poetry", Paris, 1971), which
head the list, followed up by translations
of anthologies of Danish and Finnish
poetry, since, at least until recent times,
poetry has been the most important com¬
ponent in Nordic literature.
Although Iceland has been relatively
well represented in the Collection, espe¬
cially as far as translations into English
are concerned, a major effort is still
needed with regard to Danish literature. It
is high time the world had access to Saxo
Grammaticus (c.1150-c.1206), the Dan
ish historian in whose Gesta Danorum
Shakespeare may well have found the
model for Hamlet, to Nikolai Frederik
Grundtvig (1783-1872), the architect of
the Scandinavian identity, to Johannes
V. Jensen (1873-1950; Nobel Prize for
literature, 1944), to the metaphysical
poet Paul La Cour (1902-1956), and to
Ole Sarvig (1921-1981), not to mention
living poets.
As far as Norwegian literature is con¬
cerned, we should be able to become
better acquainted with the majestic writ¬
ings of such men as Knut Hamsun (1 859-
1952; Nobel Prize 1920) and Hans Ernst
Kinck (1865-1926) through translations,
if not of their complete works, at least of
wide selections of them. The works of the
Swedish writer August Strindberg have
now been translated into French and
their translation into German will shortly
be completed. (Since Sweden is the
most powerful of the Scandinavian coun¬
tries, publishers' interest is more easily
attracted to Swedish writers).
Unesco should promote the translation
of writers who seem to have been left on
the sidelines, such as Carl Michael Bell
man, the great poet of European Rococo,
or Romantics such as Erik John Stagne-
lius (1783-1823) and Carl Jonas Love
Almquist (1793-1866), equals in genius
and in misfortune to the great German
writers. Coming closer to the present
day, an effort is needed to draw attention
to the universality of Gunnar Ekelöf
(1 907-1 968). With regard to Finland, new
translations are needed of the Kalevala
(See Unesco Courier, August 1985) and
of Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Finally, it is to
be hoped that there will be new editions
of certain works with which the Collection
was begun and which remain essential.
JEAN-CLARENCE LAMBERT is a French poet
and specialist in the literature of northern
Europe, on which he has written a number of
essays, as well as editing an anthology of Swed¬
ish poetry (Anthologie de la Poésie Suédoise des
Origines à Nos Jours, co-published with Unesco,
1971). With Roger Caillois, a former director of
the Unesco Programme for the Translation of
Literary Works, he produced another anthology
ofpoetry Trésor de la Poésie Universelle (1958).
He is also the author of La Poésie Pour Quoi
Faire? (1978) and a collection ofpoems Le Noir
et l'Azur (1980).


### 68126: The Farewell

The farewell
by Par Lagerkvist
THEY came to the lake and crossed the narrow railway
line that ran along the shore. At that late hour there
were no trains. Just as at a level crossing the railway
lines seem to vanish on either side into the distance, so
everything appeared deserted. A lone track-watchman
wended his way home in the gathering darkness, while in the
distance could be heard the sound of a track maintenance
trolley receding into the forest.
The road had become muddy at the edge of the lake and
the girl's rubber boots sank into the slime. They had to take
to the bank, walking side by side, her delicate hand in his. He
was aware of her warmth, of her breathing. They walked on
in a long silence. Could he be in love with her?
A long line of wagons came towards them pulled by tired
horses with drooping heads. The men on the wagons seemed
to be asleep. They were travelling herring-vendors, come
from the coast some eleven miles away, on their way to
tomorrow's market. With their victuals in baskets and bot¬
tles of spirits beside them, they slept, the moonlight glinting
on the silvery scales on the loads of fish behind them.
It was late time to go home. But they halted for a
moment to look at the lake. Suddenly all was light. The
moonlight enveloped her, lighting up her face and her entire
body. Once again she was bathed in a halo of light and the
worn material of her cloak seemed to glow just as it had
before, during the meeting. Everywhere that the light
touched her it unveiled some facet of her.
He looked at her as though he were in love with her. She
radiated an aura of absolute purity. Her pale features
seemed not to be of this world; but there was no ecstatic
transfiguration, no exaltation of passion, no rapture. They
were at peace, nothing more.
She gave the impression that there was nothing animal in
her. Why?
He sensed suddenly, obscurely, that there was something
hopeless in this purity, this goodness, in the light that
surrounded her, something that he seemed to recognize.
Yes, she reminded him of something he had encountered
before.
What was so terrifying about such people was that quality
they had which conjured up the image of perfection, which
seemed to want to impose its own certainty, its total serenity.
Once one discovered it, everything seemed even more
bleak. Suddenly a warmth was revealed that life could not
offer, yet which rendered life itself even more difficult to
bear.
How long had they been there? It was time to go.
They hastened back towards the town. Anders felt an urge
to escape from her, to blaspheme, to deny his beliefs, to
destroy something within her. But they continued in silence.
The roads were deserted. He accompanied her as far as
the forge, to which was attached an annexe, a hovel in which
she lived. He felt a wave of nausea at finding himself near the
wall behind which they had bellowed and brayed. They
parted. She entered the ramshackle building as if it were a
house fit for humans to live in.
When he reached home he had an overwhelming feeling of
relief.
So ended his early youth. Nothing was left but lies,
confusion, disintegration.

SINCE the conquistadors did not
come with their wives but with
slaves, triple miscegenation must
have begun on the day the first Spa¬
niards landed in America. The Portu¬
guese arrived soon afterwards. Both
empires imposed their language and
their religion, superimposing them on
those of the indigenous population. Col¬
umbus discovered the marvels he had
wanted to discover: the estuary of one of
the rivers of paradise, Amazons, men

in the conquest of Mexico with Cortes,
describes what he has seen as "like the
tales of enchantment in the book Amadis
of Gaul". (More than four centuries later,
Alejo Carpentier, "having fallen under
the spell of the land of Haiti" and "seen
the magic signs on the red roads of the
Central Plateau", found himself "im¬
pelled to bring the marvels of reality clos¬
er to the wearying task of striving to con
jure up the marvellous".) The Discoverer
and the chroniclers of the Indies were
also poets: they had to invent words for
things they had never seen, and to find
ways of spelling such words as cacique,
hamaca, guayaba and pina. And whether

with the "noble savage" hopefully sought

some "unwritten stories", from "the

the age of twenty". In his Comentarios

### 68106: Latin America: a world apart

The "Apostle ofAmerican Independence",
the Cuban José Marti (1853-1895), above,
is one of thegreat figures ofLatin America.
He is the author of a vast body of work
ranging from political essays (such as the
still topical Nuestra América ("Our Amer¬
ica"), to portraits ofLatin American heroes
and poets, criticism of art and literature,
popularpoems such as those in his collec¬
tion Versos Sencillos, and a children's
magazine, La Edad de Oro, entirely written
by him "so that children can learn how
people lived in the past and how they live
today in America and elsewhere in the
world". A selection ofhis works published
in the Collection in French (Pages
Choisies,) gives a good idea of Marti's ver¬
satility.
and Yaya Garcia, he broke with the
naturalism that was emerging in Europe
(which would find its finest heir in the
stories of Horacio Quiroga (6)) and with
romanticism that was dying in America.
And although the vision of the poets was
still a romantic one, José Hernández suc¬
ceeded, in Martín Fierro, in writing an
epic about a gaucho in the language of
the people.
At the beginning of the twentieth cen¬
tury, the great José Martí <7) established
the ethnic and cultural boundaries of our
mixed-race America, distinguishing it
from what had tended to be a mere geo¬
graphical concept. Looking back with an
all-encompassing sweep of vision, he
observed that the "discovery" was a "de¬
vastating civilization, two words which, in
their opposition to each other, constitute
a process". And another, parallel pro¬
cess was under way: the American's
search for himself, his questioning about
his destiny, his doubts about his defini¬
tion. José Enrique Rodó (8) found in
Arielrespectfully disagreeing with
Shakespeare the symbol of the Latin
spirit, which unites Hispano-America
with France and reconciles it with Spain.
In his biography of Facundo Quiroga,
Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (9) ex¬
pounded a whole programme: civilization
or barbarism, with the city pitted against
the country; the Seis Ensayos en Busca
de Nuestra Expresión, by Pedro Henrí-
quez Ureña, and the Siete Ensayos de
Interpretación de la Realidad Peruana,
by José Carlos Mariátegui, are searching
investigations of the American identity
and attempts to structure its destiny.
Even today, in some Latin American
countries, writing is an activity of the pri¬
vileged, of those who have been able to
learn to read, of those who have time to
think. The novelist, brought up in the city,
is astonished to discover the virgin forest,
plains, rivers and mountains and to see
men as the victims of nature. After pic¬
turesque romanticizing of the Creole,
and paternalistic accounts of local cus¬
toms and manners, realism (with La
Vorágine by José Eustacio Rivera, Don
Segundo Sombra by Ricardo Güiraldes,
Doña Barbara by Rómulo Gallegos) took
root so firmly in America that for a time it
was regarded as the only indigenous
literary "monoculture". But, given the un-
marvellous aspects of the Latin Amer¬
ican situation poverty, lice and the
lash to take the sordid realities of ev¬
eryday life as a literary theme was consi¬
dered intolerable, not only by official cul¬
ture but also by the authorities: Jorge
Icaza was labelled unpatriotic for his
Huasipungo, and Alcides Arguedas (10)
was called an enemy of his country for
Pueblo Enfermo. Judging them from the
point of view of the modern novel, Carlos
Fuentes has said: "... closer to geogra¬
phy than to literature, the Latin American
novel has been written by men who seem
to have been following the tradition of the
great sixteenth-century explorers". To
which one might reply that from within
literature, some of the best Latin Amer¬
ican novelists of the mid-twentieth cen¬
tury have drawn their literary material
from geography, in the tradition of the
explorers, and from history, in the tradi¬
tion of the chroniclers: in them Asturias
discovered "magical realism"; then
came Rulfo, Carpentier, García Már¬
quez, Roa Bastos. (Onetti and Cortázar
prefer to venture into the nooks and cran¬
nies of the city and its people).

A 3-part anthology of letters, speeches
and proclamations by Simón Bolívar the
Liberator (1783-1830), above, has been
published in the Unesco Collection in
French. It contains texts such as the
Angostura speech and the famous Letter
from Jamaica which reveal Bolivar's love
of liberty and the literary style of a man
who was said to "wield the pen as well as
he did the sword".
The Brazilians were perhaps the first to
proclaim the independence of the lan¬
guage: Graciliano Ramos <11) "reduced
expression to ellipsis, to minimal, almost
monosyllabic sentences, adjusting the
form to reflect minimum levels of survi¬
val"; Mario de Andrade had recourse to
verbal delirium when, in Macunaima (12),
he created a myth in search of its con¬
tinental definition, an Odyssey of the rain
forest; Joao Guimaraes Rosa(13)
violated the Portuguese of polite society
and even the syntax of the people of
Minas Gerais, especially in his Gran Ser-
tón: Veredas, "the most ambitious liter¬
ary adventure since Joyce's Ulysses".
With Rubén Darío (14) poetry begins to
display its prowess. Describing himself
as "a Chorotega Indian with the hands of
a marquis", he shook all poetry in Span¬
ish to its foundations, and established
modernity, if only for a time. Later César
Vallejo, almost an Indian, set fire to the
language and broke it up into particles of
suffering; Vicente Huidrobo took the lan¬
guage itself as the theme of his poetry;
with Pablo Neruda language and poetry
are born again, transformed; Nicolás
Guillen introduces Afro-Cuban reso¬
nances into the purest Castilian Spanish.
Jorge Luis Borges brings "a new way of
understanding the written word". So in
the mid-twentieth century the leading
figure in literature is not nature but lan¬
guage, and reality again spills over into
the world of the imagination. I

"America is the country of the future,"
wrote Hegel. "In times to come, its histor¬
ical importance will be made plain,
perhaps in the struggle between North
and South America.... but philosophers
do not make prophecies." Latin Amer¬
ican culture has achieved continental
stature; it forms a clearly defined, seam¬
less whole. We have moved from a litera¬
ture of experience to a literature of
thought, and both are the outcome of a
culture which is not a finished product but
is still in the process of becoming, watch¬
ing itself grow in its own mirror.

### 68128: Gauderios'

'Gauderios'
by Concolorcorvo
THESE are youths born in Montevideo and the neigh¬
bouring districts. With ragged underclothes and
worse outer garments, they try to cover themselves
with one or two ponchos, from which, along with the sad¬
dlecloth of their horses, they make a bed, with the saddle
serving as a pillow. To the accompaniment of a guitar, which
they learn to play very badly, they sing, out of tune, many
ballads which they ruin, and many which they get out of their
own heads, usually treating of love. They wander over the
countryside at their will, and to the great pleasure of the
semi-civilized settlers, they eat at the latter's expense and
spend entire weeks stretched out on a hide, singing and
playing. If they lose a horse or it is stolen from them, another
is given to them, or they take one from the open country,
lassoing it with a very long rope which they call a rosario.
They also carry another, with two balls at its ends, the size of
those with which pool is played, often made of stone covered
with leather, so that the horse becomes entangled in them
just as it does in another which they call ramales, having
three balls, with which the horses are frequently injured and
of no further use; but they consider their usefulness very
lightly, as do the owners.
Frequently four or five, and sometimes more, of these
men get together under pretext of going to the country to
amuse themselves, taking no provisions for their sustenance
other than a lasso , bolas , and a knife . One day they will agree
to eat the rump of a cow or a calf; they lasso it, throw it down,
and with its four feet securely tied, they pull from it, almost
alive, the entire rear quarter with its hide, and making a few
punctures in the side of the meat, they roast it badly and
devour it half raw without any condiment except a little salt,
if by chance they are carrying some. Other times they kill a
cow or a calf merely to eat the matambre, the meat between
the ribs and the skin. Sometimes they kill only to eat the
tongue which they roast in embers. Another time they may
take a fancy to the caracuces, the bones containing the
marrow, which they turn over and over with a small stick,
and they feast upon that delightful substance; but the
greatest monstrosity is to see them kill a cow, extract the
tripe and all the fat which they pile together in the belly, and
with merely a live coal or a piece of dry cow dung they set fire
to that fat; as soon as it begins to burn and the fire spreads to
the fat meat and bones, it produces an extraordinary illumi¬
nation, and then they close up the belly again, allowing the
animal to breath fire through its mouth and nostrils, leaving
it all night or a considerable part of the day so that it will be
well roasted. In the morning or in the afternoon, the gauder¬
ios gather around it, and with his knife each cuts off the piece
which suits him and eats it unaccompanied by bread or any
other seasoning; when their appetites are satisfied, they
abandon the rest, with the exception of a few who take a
piece back to their rustic paramours.
And now let the London newsvendor try to amaze us by
recounting the size of the pieces of beef which are put on the
tables of state in that capital. There the largest is 200 pounds,
on which 200 milords dine, while here 500 pounds are served
up for seven or eight gauderios who occasionally invite the
owner of the cow or heifer, and consider themselves well
served. So much for the gauderios, for I see that my travelers
desire to leave for Buenos Aires.

### 68107: From the heart of Eastern Europe

From the heart of Eastern Europe
by Edgar Reichman
THE history of the peoples of East¬
ern Europe has been marked by
terrifying upheavals, not least of
which were the after-effects of the great
migrations. The Lay of Igor's Campaign,
a monumental work acknowledged by all
the great Slav literatures, dates back to
the twelfth century. In the sixteenth cen¬
tury Jan Kochanowski laid the founda¬
tions of a humanist Polish culture. Two
centuries later, the Moldavian Prince
Cantemir recounted the rise and decline
of the Ottoman empire. And yet, in the
age of Villon, Cervantes and
Shakespeare, published literature was
rare, largely comprising sacred writings
in Slavonic, folk-tales and historical
chronicles, the work of printers scattered
from the Balkans to the Urals. At this
period, the rich and original Slav culture
was essentially oral.
With the advent of the nineteenth cen¬
tury, the extension of the Gutenberg
galaxy fostered the emergence of nation¬
al feeling, from Sofia to Prague and War¬
saw, from Budapest to Kiev. The militant
Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz opposed
both Tsarist absolutism and Austrian au¬
thority. Sandor Petofi(1), also a poet,
gave vehement expression to the aspira¬
tions of the Magyars. In Transylvania, the
movement known as the Transylvanian
school stressed the Latin origin of the
Romanian language and people, while
on the other side of the Carpathians,
Mihail Eminescu(2) shaped the language
into the form it has today. The work of the
Ukrainian Taras Shevchenko(3), a freed
serf who was to die for his struggle
against serfdom, marks the beginnings
of a literature that is, unfortunately, still
little known. In Shalom Aleichem(4), the
Jews also found their bard, who restored
the beauty of Yiddish, later enhanced by
Isaac Bashevis Singer. It is to these au¬
thors belonging to languages and litera¬
tures which are not widely known and to
which we owe such writers as Capek,
Andric(5), Ady(6) and Arghezi, that the
publishing effort of the Unesco Collection
of Representative Works is devoted.
Consequently it should come as no sur¬
prise that such great giants of world liter-

ature as Gogol, Chekhov, Tolstoy, Dos¬
toievsky, Esenin, Pushkin, Mayakovsky,
Musil, Kafka, and Canetti are not on the
list.
Then came the twentieth century. In
October 1917 the guns of the battleship
Aurora, anchored off Petrograd, hailed
the birth of a new world. Weeds were
ineluctably spreading in the ruins of the
Dual Monarchy and of the empire of the
autocratic Tsars. Hungarians and Roma¬
nians, Czechs and Slovaks, Slovenes,
Serbo-Croats and Bulgarians had long
been writing in their national languages,
thereby enriching the heritage of
humanity(7). Today as in the past they
express their rejection of tyranny and the
arbitrary, hatred of war, attachment to
Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725),
knownas "the Father ofGeorgia", devoted
his life to letters, politics and religion. One
of his major achievements was the com¬
pilation of a dictionary of the Georgian
language. In addition to many religious
writings, he left a remarkable account of a
"Journey in Europe" which he made on a
diplomatic mission to the courts of Louis
XIV of France and Pope Clement XI and
which was the firstpiece of travel writing in
Georgian literature. The culmination ofhis
literary career was "The Truth of Lying", a
collection of stories, parables, fables,
maxims and riddles which is one of the
great works of Georgian prose. Left, illus¬
tration from the French translation, pub¬
lished in the Collection in 1984 under the
title Vérité du Mensonge.
Journalist and novelist, the Polish writer
Boleslaw Prus (pseudonym ofAleksander
Glowacki, 1847-1912) wrote novels and
short stories remarkable for their graphic
depiction ofsocial conditions. A 3-volume
French version of Lalka (1890; "The Doll"),
considered to be his masterpiece, has
been published in the Unesco Collection
as La Poupée (1962, 1963, 1964). The
novel, set in Warsaw, gives a picture of the
whole of Polish society in the second half
of the 19th century. Written with a wealth of
observation and humour, it is the finest
Polish novel ofmanners of its time. Right,

man will no longer be a savage slaught¬

Jalali meets his master
<D
L avid, after your father died I would not let his fiery
horse out of the stable for fear Misra Melik would
know about it and want him for himself. We have
been feeding and watering him from the roof. I don't dare go
near that horse. If you can lead him out of the stable, Jalali is
yours. "
David entered the secret stable through a little inside door
no one had opened for twenty years. He had his father's
armour on him and the horse smelled him with tears in his
eyes, taking him for Meherr. David caressed his mane,
stroked his neck and back, and the horse kept nuzzling him.
David led him out of the stable. The horse kicked, with fiery
sparks blazing out from his hooves, when he saw it wasn't
Meherr. The horse spoke by God's order:
"Earthborn, what do you want to do with me?"
"I want to ride you to war," David said.
"Ride me? I will take you up to the clouds and burn you to
ashes against the sun."
"I can ride under your belly."
"I will smash you to pieces against rocks and trees. I will
hurl you against the winds. Throw you into bottomless seas.
My name is Colt Jalali. If I just breathe on you you will be
blown off like so much dust, you earthborn fool."
David said: "I can ride on your back, under your belly, on
your right side, your left side. I can hang on to your tail. I can
even ride in your mouth if I want to."
"Some rider," Jalali said. "From now on you are my
master and I am your horse."
David kissed him on the head and said:
"You had no master, I am your master
No one to groom you, to hold your halter
No one to feed you, to give you water
To look after you, Ó Colt Jalali."
(...) "Uncle Ohan, give me his silver saddle with the gold
stirrups."
Ohan brought him the silver saddle with the gold stirrups
and watched him saddle the horse, thinking to himself:
"When Meherr mounted him Jalali reared up on his hind
legs. If he will do that with David, I will let him go fight Misra
Melik." All four feet of the horse were off the ground when
David seized the silver saddle and put his feet in the gold
stirrups. He rode up and down a few times and had Barav
also enjoy a ride with him. Jalali had found his new master.

"Allen & Unwin have had a long and
fruitful association with Unesco book pro¬

project for a multi-volumed History of
Mankind that would break the old tradi¬
tion of viewing world history from a purely
national standpoint. We were delighted
to be chosen as the English publisher,
though we hardly anticipated that it would
take over twenty years to come to com¬
pletion. But meanwhile, particularly
throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the

Works was establishing itself another
global project that helped to bring great
works from minority languages before a
larger, English language audience. Many
publishers participated in this continuing

have appeared on our list. It is invidious
to single out individual titles, but I am
particularly fond of Premchand's The Gift
of a Cow, Arberry's vivid translations of
the Persian Tales from the Masnavi, the
Armenian classic Daredevils ofSassoun,
and the elegant anthology of Bengali
poetry that Deban Bhattacharya trans¬
lated under the title The Mirror of the Sky.
"And although nowadays on a more
modest level, the series continues and
serves the world community well. Our
most recent additions to the Unesco trea¬
sure house have been a first ever transla¬
tion of the old Catalan classic Curial and
Guelfa, and a new translation of the more
recent Czech author Karel Capek's mor¬
dant satire War with the Newts. "

Photographed at Saigon (today Ho Chi
Minh-Ville) in 1963, this elderly Viet¬
namese writing Chinese characters (be¬
low) could be taken to symbolize the his¬
tory of the poetic tradition in Vietnam, as
revealed in Anthologie de la Poésie Vietna¬
mienne, a collection of Vietnamese poetry
published in the Collection in French in
1981. Han, or classical Chinese, was once
the language of culture in Vietnam, and
imposed formal rigour on scholarly poet¬
ry. Butaround the end ofthe 18th centurya
synthesis took place between scholarly
poetry and the ancient tradition ofpopular
poetry, giving birth to the modern Viet¬
namese language.

"After saluting the Buddha, the Law and
the Noble Assembly, I shall now expound
this abridged account of the Three
Worlds".
These are the opening lines of "The Three
Worlds", a 14th-century work which has
been called the first systematic treatise on
Buddhist cosmogony. Translated from
Thai into French, it was published In the
Collection in 1973. Above, head of a Bud¬
dha in the royal palace, Bangkok.
We regret that limitations of space made it
impossible for us to give more co-publishers an
opportunity to express their opinion about the
Unesco Collection.
3*£*£.
Le Vent du Nord-Est ("The North-East
Wind") is the first modern Malaysian novel
to be published In the Collection in French
(1982). An outstanding example of a
flourishing popular literature, it describes
the daily life of Saleh, a fisherman on the
east coast of the Malaypeninsula which is
periodically ravaged by the north-east
monsoon. Above cover illustration, de¬
picting fishing boats on a heavy sea.
"In our opinion the Unesco Collection of
Representative Works, several of which
have been published by us, is of capital
importance in promoting knowledge of
literatures that are unjustly ignored and
neglected. The dictates of the market
take no account of certain cultural
aspects which are sometimes of great
importance but do not correspond to the
taste of the moment.
"In the field of culture there are the
strong and the weak, the powerful and
the obscure. It is to the credit of the
Unesco Collection that it takes no
account of such considerations, which
have to do with ideology and business,
but tries to establish some kind of justice
in the appreciation of those works of the
past that form part of our heritage. Con¬
sequently we cannot but approve of the
creation and development of this Collec¬
tion and, within the means at our disposal
and true to our convictions, contribute to
its success."

Drawing, right by Georgina Beier is an

an anthology of the poetry of Papua New
Guinea published in English in the Oce¬
anian Series of the Unesco Collection of
Representative Works.
" 'A region and an international organiza¬
tion. The world literary heritage.' These
are the key words behind a decentralized
publishing undertaking which, in the
space of a few years, enabled us to cre¬
ate a catalogue in sixteen linguistic fields
with almost 200 titles, four of which were
proposed and supported by Unesco: Le
Vent du Nord-est (Malaysia); Le Temps
et l'Eau (Iceland); Le GrandAppareillage
(Greece), and Lillelord (Norway). And
since they are four masterpieces, that is
no small achievement. We are proud of
these four, but we are no less proud of
the others, those which could have, or
perhaps should have, had their place in
the Unesco Collection of Representative
Works. We hope with all our heart for a
big expansion of this Collection."
Actes Sud publishers
Arles, France
"Thanks to Unesco, Aubier have been
able to publish works by two relatively
unknown figures of world literature
Halldor Laxness of Iceland and Countess
Leonora Christina of Denmark. Souve¬
nirs de Misère, which we are now pub¬
lishing, is the portrait of a remarkable
woman, a king's daughter who, in the
seventeenth century, began by making
history before becoming its witness and
relating with what talent! her twenty
years of captivity in the sinister Blue Tow¬
er of Copenhagen Castle. May we add
that these books would never have seen
the light without the enthusiasm, pa¬
tience and talent of their remarkable
translators, to whom our thanks are due.
"These are two examples among
many others, which show that the Un¬
esco Collection of Representative Works
meets an essential need. It may be the
only Collection that establishes a real link
between different cultures."

### 68109: 1986: Year of Peace, 1

1 986 Year of Peace / 1
1986 has been proclaimed the Interna¬
tional Year of Peace by the United
Nations. A Unesco-sponsored interna¬
tional symposium entitled "Philosophical
reflection on the Foundations of Peace in
the Present World Situation" was held at
Unesco's Paris Headquarters from 3 to 6
December 1 985. It was attended by inde¬
pendent specialists in a number of disci¬
plines, from all the world's geocultural
regions, and by representatives of other
United Nations agencies, trades unions
and other non-governmental organiza¬
tions.
At the outset it was pointed out that a
review of world events showed the un-
tenability of the claim that the world has
enjoyed a period of peace since the
Second World War came to an end and
certain countries came to possess nuc¬
lear weapons. It is true that the balance of
terror causes peace to prevail between
States situated, for the most part, in the
northern hemisphere. But never before
has war embroiled so many States in the
southern hemisphere, in many of which,
for the last decade or so, famine has
claimed an average of 60 million lives
annually.
Thus it seems that peace is not coter¬
minous with the absence of war in va¬
rious parts of the world: true peace can
only be indivisible. Given the destructive
power of nuclear weapons, which now
makes it possible to annihilate the whole
of humanity, the notion of universal
peace is no longer an ideal but a condi¬
tion for the survival of the human species.
Participants in the symposium also in¬
sisted on the fact that between the state
of peace, with the serenity that accompa-
In each issue published during
1986, proclaimed International Year
of Peace by the United Nations, the
Unesco Courier will report on diffe¬
rent events being held international¬
ly in connection with this event.
The first text in the series appears
below.
m)
nies it, and the state of war, synonymous
with death, there is an intermediate stage
in which humanity merely achieves
physical survival, a situation that should
not be confused with the true contours of
peace. Man, in his physical and spiritual
totality, is and must remain at the heart of
any conception of authentic world peace.
This should not be forgotten at a time
when the development of the neutron
bomb perversely makes it possible to
save material goods while destroying
people.
What ethical attitudes are necessary
and what specific steps should be taken
for the patient construction of such a
peace? In any design for peace, setting
aside questions of disarmament and
armament, the participants thought that
the material crisis (famine, unem¬
ployment, debt) could eventually be sur¬
mounted. It is the spiritual crisis, with its
attendant intolerance, racism, and con¬
flicts of values, that divides the world
today. Any ethical vision of peace or any
action to promote peace must lead ulti¬
mately to the total liberty of man by gra¬
dually breaking down the barriers of indi¬
vidual and collective intolerance. If this
liberty, from an ethical point of view,
essentially belongs to every person, it is
also a responsibility for every State. Con¬
sequently there must be a constant
search for a simultaneous and reciprocal
balance between human rights, for each
individual, and the rights of peoples, for
all nations; for a balance between the
material and spiritual needs of all men;
between economic and technological de¬
velopment on the one hand and cultural
and political development on the other;
between being and possessing.
It was unanimously felt that the
achievement of an indivisible peace in
spirit and in practice will mean demilitar¬
izing our cultures, both individual and
collective, our conflictual visions of
healthy opposition and difference, our
manichean judgments, our knowledge
which is partial in both senses of the
word.
All the participants also emphasized
the central role incumbent on the orga¬
nizations of the United Nations system in
this search for a world equilibrium and a
lasting peace.
