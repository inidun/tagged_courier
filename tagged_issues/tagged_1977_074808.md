The Mayan civilization of Central America, which endured over a thousand years until the Spanish
conquest of the 16th century A. D., produced an abundance of extraordinary art, which survives at
such famous sites as Chichén Itzá (Mexico), Peten (Guatemala) and Copan (Honduras). Shown here
is a detail of a statue from Copan, an outstanding example of classical Mayan art (8th century A. D.)
depicting a serenely impassive priest or chief. The figure's sumptuous clothing is elaborately deco-
ratecTtwth motifs foreshadowing the exuberance of later Hispano-Mexican baroque art.

The oceans contain a fabulous store of
wealth in the form of fisheries, oil,
natural gas and rare minerals. To chart
these vast resources and tap them fully
to meet man's needs, scientists must
study all aspects of the "watery
continent" which covers over 70 per cent
of the earth's surface. This issue of
the Unesco Courier is devoted to the
development of international
co-operation, both in oceanography and
in the search for a new international
law of the sea which, as part of a new
world economic order, would help to give
all countries access to the ocean's
resources. Cover shows two luminous
"hatchet fish" which live in perpetual
darkness 1,000 metres below the
ocean surface.

of the sea
by
Maria Eduarda
Goncalves
MARIA EDUARDA GONCALVES, Portu¬
guese jurist, is a member of the Portuguese
delegation at the Third United Nations Confe¬
rence on the Law of the Sea. A staff member
of the department of international relations
and co-operation at the State Secretariat for
Fisheries, Lisbon, she is the author of many
studies on the law of the sea and the protect¬
ion of the environment.
FOR centuries the oceans were
regarded as "belonging to no
one" (res nullius) and as sub¬
ject to the principle of the freedom of
the seas enunciated in 1609 by an
exponent of international law, the
celebrated Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius.
The eventual result was that they
were taken over, exploited and divid¬
ed up by the then powerful mari¬
time nations which set about build¬
ing navies for the discovery and
appropriation of "new worlds" and
unknown seas.
With the passage of time, and
primarily for reasons of defence.
national custom and practice found
formal expression in the rule that a
coastal state had sovereign rights up
to a distance of three miles from its
shores, the maximum range of a
ball fired from a cannon of that
period. Beyond that limit the prin¬
ciple of freedom of the seas applied.
More recently, the long-accepted
idea that the seas are an inexhaus¬
tible source of living resources
and a suitable receptacle for all the
waste and rubbish dumped into
them has been challenged. Some
developing countries have taken
unilateral action to extend their

H
zones of sovereignty to the 200-
mile limit so as to exploit and pro¬
tect their own fishing stocks. Other,
industrially developed, countries
have extended their jurisdiction to
the continental shelf in the hope of
exploiting its mineral resources.
The United Nations organized two
Conferences on the Law of the
Seaone in 1958 and the other in
1960at which the main concern
was to establish limits for the terri¬
torial sea and to lay down prin¬
ciples for the conservation of the
seas and their biological resources,
in addition to discussing more tra
ditional problems relating to ship¬
ping and communications.
But the seas continued to be seen >
as a potential source of exploitable
wealth, providing they are properly
managed. Recent investigations of
the sea-bed beyond the zones of
national jurisdiction and at great
depths have resulted in the discovery
of mineral resources such as nodules
of manganese and have led indus¬
trially developed countries to create
new technologies for exploiting them.
It was with that specific prospect
ahead that in 1967 Malta's repre
sentative at the United Nations Gen¬
eral Assembly proposed that imme¬
diate steps be taken to regulate the
use of sea-bed mineral resources and
ensure that they were exploited for
peaceful purposes and for the benefit
of all mankind.
It was feared that with the aid of
technological progress, the indus¬
trially developed nations, enjoying
strategic superiority, would scramble
for resources of this kind located
beyond the limits of national juris¬
diction and use them for their own



exclusive benefit, and to the detri- 1
ment of the developing countries. I

### 46508: Who owns the oceans? The United Nations and the international community in search of a new law of the sea

> The Third United Nations Con¬
ference on the Law of the Sea began
in 1974. It largely stemmed from
the need to fill gaps in existing inter¬
national legislation which did not
cover these new uses of the sea.
However, by this time many new
States which had played no part in
the formulation of traditional mari¬
time law had achieved independence.
They had also become aware of the
importance of their offshore resources
for providing food supplies and as
a means of economic and social
development.
Growing attention was also being
paid to problems of protecting the
sea's living resources and the ma¬
rine environment and of defending
national sovereignty. All these fac¬
tors led the U.N. Member States to
agree on the need for negotiations to
create a legal framework for dealing
with such questions and to ensure
that the uses of the oceans should
not become a constant source of
tension and conflict but develop
harmoniously in a climate of mutual
respect.
One of the major themes under
discussion is the prospection and
utilization of the minerals of the sea¬
bed beyond the area of national
jurisdiction. The international com¬
munity now accepts that these re¬
sources are part of the common heri¬
tage of mankind and should there¬
fore not be appropriated by only
those countries which have the im¬
mediate capacity to extract them.
They should be administered by an
international authority, still to be set
up, in which all States would be
represented on an equal footing.
The proposed International Sea-
Bed Authority would be a revolu¬
tionary innovation within the United
Nations family. It would be gov¬
erned by the new concepts under¬
lying international relations: the
exploitation of the area beyond na¬
tional jurisdiction should be for peace¬
ful purposes only, and the benefits
shared equitably among all States,
with particular emphasis on the needs
of the developing countries.
However, the industrially-dev¬
eloped countries have reservations
about some of these proposals: in
the last few years multinational com¬
panies have made massive invest¬
ments in perfecting technologies for
exploiting the sea-bed nodules as a
major source of manganese, copper,
nickel, cobalt and other minerals.
On another important questionthe
adoption of a 200-mile economic
zonethere is more or less general
agreement. In this zone coastal
States would have various powers
including exclusive jurisdiction over
living resources, with the right to
determine the size of the total allow¬
able catch and the unused surplus
that could be granted to another
state by inter-party agreement.
The 200-mile limit would be a
step towards better redistribution of
the uses of the living resources of the
sea, by restricting the major sea
powershitherto guilty of over-fishing
many speciesin their access to the
coastal waters of other states.
Contrary to what has happened up
to now, coastal States would at last
have control over the resources of
their offshore waters in a 200-mile
zoneand this, for the developing
countries, is a matter of fundamental
importance.
In fact, with this extension of na¬
tional jurisdiction, one-third of the
oceans will cease to be considered as
the high seas (subject to the principle
of "freedom of the seas") and will
come under the coastal States' juris¬
diction.
The international and regional
fishing organizations to which inter¬
ested States belong, and which are
responsible for managing the re¬
sources of specific areas, will con¬
tinue to play a big role in promoting
scientific co-operation, collecting and
distributing information and also in
developing technical assistance to
enable coastal States to make full
use of the resources in their zones.
This co-operation is particularly
necessary since some migratory spe¬
cies such as tunny move over a wide
range through the economic zones of
several States.
Agreement on these issues will
only be possible if other States are
given certain vital guarantees such as
freedom of navigation, overflight and
under-water cable-laying for commu¬
nication, as long as these guarantees
in no way prevent the coastal States
SIX MILLION TONS OF MINERALS A YEAR
Vast areas of the ocean are strewn with nodules like those shown
above, containing minerals such as manganese, iron, copper and
nickel. As much as 6 million tons of nodules may accumulate
annually in this way in the Pacific Ocean alone. To exploit the
world's several billion tons of ocean bed nodules with their mineral
wealth new techniques are currently being developed. Left,
scientists examine samples of ocean sediments. Nodules can be
seen embedded on a "core" raised from the sea bed at a depth of
4,000 m. in the Madagascar Basin (Indian Ocean) during a French
océanographie expedition in May 1976.

### 46508: Who owns the oceans? The United Nations and the international community in search of a new law of the sea

In 1974, world fish
production exceeded
60 million tons.
About 90 per cent of
the catch came from
areas of the "High
Seas" which may
one day become
"economic zones"
under the exclusive
jurisdiction of coastal
States. For many
countries fishing is a
major food resource.
Among them is Sri
Lanka whose fishing
fleet numbers the

from exercising their new rights.
This new legal order of the seas
would be part and parcel of the effort
to establish a New International
Economic Order based on internatio¬
nal co-operation and mutual respect
and designed to reduce the present
inequalities between developing coun¬
tries and those of the industrialized
world.
In seeking to include the law of the
sea in the New International Econo¬
mic Order," the Third Conference came
up against another major issue in
addition to the question of giving
priority to the developing countries.
This was the problem of landlocked
countries and those which are at a
disadvantage because of the small-
ness of their coastline.
These countries are struggling to
achieve recognition of special rights
giving them access to the economic
zones of coastal States in their re¬
gion, as well as the right to exploit
under favourable conditions the re¬
sources of these zones, or at least
to have preferential access to the
unused surpluses of coastal States.
As for the protection of the ma¬
rine environment, especially against
pollution, the extension of the juris¬
diction of the coastal States to 200
miles makes it necessary to redefine
their competence in this field and
harmonize their control standards
with those adopted regionally or
internationally.
The aim is to prevent pollution
caused by oil tankers and other ves¬
sels or due to operations involving
the discharge of pollutants, and to
prevent or reduce damage to health
and to living resources, and at least
ensure that accidents in one area
do not have repercussions in other
parts of the ocean.
The developing coastal States also
seek recognition of the right to
control océanographie research by
ships and organizations from other
countries in their coastal waters and
to have such research placed under
their jurisdiction. They are also
demanding that their consent should
be required in cases where the re¬
sults of this research have a direct
impact on their own marine resources,
or are aimed at practical applications.
It is claimed that the coastal States
should thus have the right to take part
in formulating research programmes
and to participate in their execution,
and have access to the results and
their analysis.

However, the major powers still
champion the principle of complete
freedom of (non-applied) research,
and view control by the coastal
States as a threat to science and
the acquisition of new knowledge.
It is clear that regional and global
bodies such as the Intergovernmental
Océanographie Commission could
play an important role in promoting
agreement between the countries
concerned.
Generally speaking, the developing
countries hope to benefit from the
new regime for the oceans as a
means of hastening their economic
and social development. However, ¡
they are hampered by the lack ofw
adequate infrastructures, of scientific F

, and technical knowledge and a shor¬
tage of capital, to say nothing of the
limits imposed by the huge cost of
the technologies developed in the
industrialized countries.
The costs are particularly prohibi¬
tive when it comes to exploiting min¬
eral resources, whereas the technolo¬
gies needed for exploiting living
resources are within the reach of
many coastal countries.
These points have been intensively
discussed by the U.N. Conference
and there is every reason to believe
that the future Convention on the
Law of the Sea will cover them by
adopting principles which encourage
the transfer of technology, although
the industrialized countries are mak¬
ing a stand in favour of what they
regard as fair payment for patents
and equipment.
As can be anticipated in matters
of such complexity in which such im¬
portant interests are at stake, one
can expect divergences regarding in¬
terpretation and even disputes regard¬
ing application of the future regime
of the oceans.
The final agreement on these ques¬
tions will thus depend on compro¬
mise and the setting up of internatio¬
nal machinery for forestalling or sett¬
ling any disputes that may arise.
Two recent international disputes
from which useful lessons can be
drawn are the "cod war" between
Iceland and the United Kingdom and
the tension between Greece and
Turkey over the delimitation of zones
of jurisdiction in which mineral re¬
sources are thought to exist.
It is essential to settle such dis¬
putes by peaceful means in the spirit
of the United Nations Charter, if mu¬
tual co-operation and understanding
in the international community are
not to be impaired and the solution
of practical problems posed by the
exploitation of the sea is not to be
jeopardized.
Thus the Conference has studied
the various mechanisms that States
could use to solve these problems,
including such traditional ones as
arbitration and the International
Court of Justice at The Hague, as
well as new ones such as the Law
of the Sea Tribunal (still to be set up)
in which the developing countries
would be well represented.
Delay in drawing up the Conven¬
tion would undoubtedly lead many
States to establish unilaterally their
own laws on the exploitation of the
sea's resources. Various countries
have indeed recently extended their
areas of national jurisdiction and
transformed them into exclusive eco¬
nomic zones.
Conversely, there is the risk that
big multinational companies would
not wait for the end of the negotia¬
tions and would instead press for
immediate exploitation of the sea¬
bed without limits or conditions and
for the sole benefit of those who
have least need of these resources.
Photo © Parimage. Pans
A situation of that kind could well
generate tensions and aggravate
disputes within the international
community.
In practice, the process of creating
a new law of the sea is already und¬
erway. It is to be hoped that it will
be influenced by the concepts of a
New Economic Order and will be prov¬
ided with institutions that guarantee
its application for the benefit of the
international community as a whole
and Jaking also into account legiti¬
mate national interests.

### 46511: Oceanography and the law of the sea

by Mario Ruivo
OCEANOGRAPHY
AND THE LAW OF
THE great ocean expedition of
the British corvette, H. M. S.
"Challenger" (1872-1876) was
a landmark in the development of the
marine sciences. It was the first
océanographie venture organized on
a world scale to learn more about the
oceanstheir depths, waters and
living things.
Such knowledge was not only seen
as important in itself. The need for
making practical use of it was also
recognized. And océanographie re¬
search was made easier by the prin¬
ciple of freedom of the seas, allowing
scientific observations and activities
to be freely carried out.
The growing interest in the seas
led to the creation of marine labora¬
tories specializing in areas of parti¬
cular scientific interest without any
restriction on the part of local autho¬
rities. Scientists from many coun¬
tries, including those without a sea¬
board were thus able to conduct
research in coastal waters that were
subject to national sovereignty.
Among such laboratories were the
Russian Zoological Station (1884) set
up at Villefranche-sur-mer (France),
and the Naples Zoological Station
(1872) founded by F. A. Dohrn and
other German scholars for Mediter¬
ranean studies. These institutions
were the precursors of forms of
extended co-operation which were to
develop almost a century later under
the auspices of international bodies,
but this time with stricter national
limitations.
The beginning of the 20th century
saw the birth of the first organization
for inter-governmental co-operation
in this field, with the creation in 1 902
of the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea, founded by
the countries of Northern Europe.
Its aim was the promotion of exchange
of information and ideas concerning

tuations, and other questions affec¬

and more efficient exploitation and
the co-ordination of océanographie
research.
At that time the only restrictions
on ships taking part in océanographie
expeditions were those resulting from
the three-mile limit of territorial
waters. International collaboration
was increasing, especially between
the institutions of the developed
countries of the northern hemisphere.
But this process was interrupted by
the Second World War.
The immediate post-war period and
On 30 December 1872,

the 1950s were marked by a revival
of the peaceful uses of the oceans,
initially by the maritime powers and
then, progressively, by a growing
number of developing countries,
which saw the exploitation of marine
resources as an aid to economic and
social development. In this context,
the problems and conflicts resulting
from intensive exploitation were
becoming more acute.
They became even more serious
when they ceased to be local ones
(as in the case of the overfishing of
a species in a specific area) and
instead had regional or even global
repercussions (coastal pollution resul¬
ting from accidents to oil tankers at

sea and consequent damage to living
resources and tourism). Thus new
hazards were created and the need
arose to adopt international standards
and laws to meet the new situations
and take account of the world com¬
munity's growing involvement.
To protect their resources, some
Latin American States, headed by
Peru, have formulated the concept of
"patrimonial sea" as a zone of sov¬
ereignty extending 200 miles from
the coast.
The United States with its advan¬
ced technology extended, through
President Truman's Proclamation of
1945, its jurisdiction over natural
resources of the sea-bed and its
subsoil up to its continental shelf.
In general, this period was marked
by an extraordinary development of
scientific research stimulated by
concern for a better knowledge of
the sea, and by the practical need
to collect data for developing new
technologies, for the rational exploi¬
tation of marine resources and mea¬
sures for protecting and conserving
the marine environment.
The post-war period has thusbeen
marked by a spectacular revival of
collaboration between scientists and
institutions, especially those of the in¬
dustrially developed countries. These
activities, in which a growing number
of developing countries are beginning
to participate, may cover an entire
region (International Indian Ocean
Expedition) or focus on specific
themes (productivity, evaluation of
resources, pollution, etc.)
The application of marine sciences
for peaceful purposesand, behind
the scenesfor military and security
purposesis intensifying and be¬
coming increasingly complex. Océa¬
nographie research is tending to
become multidisciplinar/. By the
end of the 1960s it had come to
be regarded as an integral part of
any programme of economic deve¬
lopment.
The establishment of the United
Nations (in 1945) and its Specialized
Agencies, some of which are exclusi¬
vely or partially concerned with ocea¬
nography (U. N. Food and Agriculture
Organization, World Meteorological
Organization, Intergovernmental Ma¬

ing economic, social and cultural pro¬

In this context, Unesco has played a
major part in promoting marine
sciences and training scientific and
technical staff.
During the past two decades many
newly-independent nations have join¬
ed the ranks of the developing
countries. Increasingly aware of the
factors uniting them and of the ine¬
qualities separating them from the
industrially developed countries, they
began to organize themselves to
defend their interests in matters rela¬
ting to scientific research, including
oceanography.
With more intensive use of the
seas, contradictions arose between
maritime practice and traditional ma¬
ritime law. The first and second
United Nations Conferences on the
Law of the Sea, in 1958 and 1960,
were thus convened with a view to
working out a regime better suited
to the realities of that time.
The four Conventions resulting
from these Conferences contained
provisions for the regulation of scien¬
tific research. They maintained the
principle of freedom of the seas
except in the case of prospection of
the continental shelf. They also
contained provisions under which
coastal States should not normally
withhold their consent to a request
from a qualified institution to conduct
purely scientific research on the conti¬
nental shelf as long as they were
allowed to participate in the research
if they so wished. If the principle of
a 12-mile maximum territorial sea
limit were adopted restrictions on
research would . be correspondingly
greater.
However, many of the newly inde¬
pendent countries held that the Con¬
ventions reflected the interests of the
big maritime powers and did not feel
bound by them, either because they
had not shared in framing them or
because they did not consider that
their interests were properly pro¬
tected.
The promotion of economic growth
in the developing countries calls for
a tremendous effort to exploit natural
resources, including those of thek
oceans. This in turn demands in- F

y vestment, scientific research, coupled
with appropriate technology and the
training of enough local scientists
and technicians.
Recently co-operation in océano¬
graphie research, although still do¬
minated by the industrialized coun¬
tries, has been increasingly shared
in by institutions and scientists of
all continents. This trend has been
helped by the creation of new inter¬
national organizations, in particular
Unesco's Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission, one of whose
functions is "to promote the scien¬
tific investigation of the oceans with
a view to learning more about their
resources through the concerted ac¬
tions of Member States."
Initially established in 1960, it
came to be regarded by 1970 as a
specialized body serving other U. N.
Agencies with responsibility for the
investigation, use and management
of the seas.
Science policies of developing
countries depend on the training of
specialized local staff through natio¬
nal efforts and also with bilateral
and multilateral aid. This will be¬
come an important factor in their
assessment of the implications of
océanographie research, with criti¬
cism already being voiced over the
differentiation being made between
"pure" and "applied" science and
regarding scientific dependence on
other countries, which is viewed as
contrary to national interests.
At the Third Conference on the
Law of the Sea criticisms were level¬
led against the regulations governing
océanographie research (see page 4).
Among other causes of growing con¬
cern were the activities of long¬
distance fishing fleets, with the
threat of over-fishing and depletion
of resources, the problem of marine
pollution, and the extraction of oil,
natural gas and other non-biological
resources at ever greater depths.
A further reason for disquiet is the
knowledge that valuable mineral re¬
sources (such as manganese nodules)
exist on the ocean floor, as revealed
by the océanographie expeditions of
the research institutes of the major
countries, and the economic viabi¬
lity of exploiting them in the near
future.
This explains why, at the start of
the Third Conference on the Law of
the Sea in 1974, there was a clash
between two opposing viewpoints on
océanographie research : one prima¬
rily reflecting the developing coun¬
tries' position, and the other that of
the major powers and other indus¬
trialized countries.
Most of the developing countries
refuse to make a distinction between
"pure" and "applied" science, affir¬
ming that there can be no divorce
between the acquisition of know¬
ledge and its application. They
point out that in some cases know¬
ledge may be directed towards non-
peaceful ends and in others, directly
or indirectly lead to an overexploi-
tation of resources. Hence the
possibility of potential security risks
to the coastal countries and of
threats to their economic interests
if a 200-mile exclusive economic zone
is adopted.
These countries are firmly convin¬
ced of the need to protect their inte¬
rests and to consolidate their rights
on the Continental Shelf, already
embodied in the 1958 Convention
on this question. They are calling
for the adoption of regulations gua¬
ranteeing that coastal States are
informed in advance of research pro;
jects proposed by other States in
order to be able to comment on them
and also to control and benefit from
the knowledge and information deriv¬
ed from those activities.
Developing countries favour regu¬
lations which require the prior con¬
sent of coastal States for océanogra¬
phie research by other countries or
institutions. Industrially developed
countries, however, argue for com¬
plete freedom of research.
These countries consider their vital
interests, including questions of de¬
fence (though this is not said in so
many words) are at stake, as well
as global economic considerations.
In this contention they are backed
up by their own scientists who main¬
tain that the unravelling of some of
the remaining mysteries of the seas

OCEAN SIMULATOR
Despite recent advances in knowledge and equipment, underwater exploration
has still many major physiological and technological obstacles to tackle. To
study these problems scientists use a variety of devices capable of reproducing
in the laboratory the conditions found at various depths. Below left, water filled
"ocean simulator" chamber at the Institute for Environmental Medicine of the
University of Pennsylvania (U. S. A.). The diver is dismantling an oil wellhead
in conditions simulating a depth of almost 500 metresthe first experiment of
work at this depth ever made. Below, 16th-century Indian painting showing

The Macedonian monarch (4th century B.C.) is said to have tried his hand
at underwater exploration.
and also the solution of practical
problems stemming from the growing
use of the oceans and their resources,
depend on complete freedom of the
sea.
There is, however, a growing trend
towards the possibility of a compro¬
mise solution. The regime of consent
should include provisions meeting
some of the developing countries'
demands. Such arrangements could
include the adapting of oceanography
programmes to meet local require¬
ments and could provide for local
scientists to be on board during
research expeditions. This would
be a form of co-operation and tech¬
nology transfer, as well as a gua¬
rantee against possible abuses.
On the other hand, there are other
trends running counter to the indus¬
trially developed countries' views and
favouring the enlargement of the
areas of exception to the regime of
consent.
The experience gained during the
past few years by international and
regional organizations concerned with
marine sciences could help to solve
some of these problems, thanks to
new forms of scientific co-operation
devised to fit in with the future law
of the ocean.
Under this new regime, internatio¬
nal organizations such as the Inter¬
governmental Océanographie Com¬
mission, among others, would be
able to set up machinery for negotia¬
ting joint research programmes for
maintaining essential services inclu¬
ding documentation centres and data
banks, and for facilitating technology
transfers and mutual assistance.
This approach would lead to active
participation by all States, and parti¬
cularly those directly concerned in
a given case, whatever their level of
development. Steps could be taken
to guarantee the national interests
involvedthose of the coastal States
and those of the States carrying out
researchas well a§ the interests of
the world community.
Countries and scientists will need
to adjust themselves to new rules of
procedure for océanographie research
based on negotiation and the spirit
of compromise. These rules will
require a more rational and systema¬
tic use of international co-operation
machinery within the United Nations
and its agencies, either in their exis¬
ting form or in a form still to be
created.

### 46512: UNESCO and the oceans

The sea's rhythms have left
their imprint on coastal sands
and mollusc shell alike.
The text below outlines some
of Unesco's major activities
and achievements in oceano¬
graphy during the past two de¬
cades. It presents passages
from a background paper to
the six-year plan of action
(1977-1982) approved by Unes¬
co's 19th General Conference,
meeting in Nairobi (Kenya) in
October-November 1976 (see
page 34).
OVER the past two decades,
vitally important advances
have been made in our know¬
ledge of the marine environment.
These advances relate first to the
actual description of this environment.
They further concern such subjects as
the revolutionary concepts of "global
plate tectonics" and their conse¬
quences for our knowledge of the sea
floor, recognition of the phenomenon
of ocean turbulence, the study of the
interrelated dynamics of the oceans
and the atmosphere, of the chemistry,
of sea water, of the marine food
chain and the effects of the glacial
lowering of sea level.
Mapping of the sea, its properties,
its organisms and its floor has been a
major scientific objective of Unesco
Member States. Through interna¬
tional co-operation under Unesco's In¬
tergovernmental Océanographie Com-'
mission (IOC), this objective has
been successful on a global scale.
Maps (such as the General Bathy¬
métrie Chart of the Oceans) and
atlases now faithfully depict such
features as bottom topography, the
magnetic and gravity fields, oceanic
currents and water masses.
They also show distributions of
sediments, important marine orga¬
nisms, seawater salinity, temperature,
density, and numerous other physical
and chemical aspects.
The concepts of "global plate tec¬
tonics" now recognize that the earth's
surface is made up of seven huge and
several smaller slowly-moving plates.
On one side, these. plates form at the
central rifts of oceanic rises, through
volcanic action, while on the far end,
at the oceanic trenches, they slowly
sink back into the earth's mantle.
Similar phenomena on land are conti¬
nental break-up and collision, with
attendant earthquakes and volcanoes.
This discovery has opened the way



UNESCO AND
to major advances in petroleum explo¬
ration and in ore formation theories.
Key components of the concept were
developed during the first co-operative
action of the IOC Member States,
the very successful International
Indian Ocean Expedition (1959-
1965), organized through the Océa¬
nographie Commission and the Scien¬
tific Committee on Oceanic Research.
The scientific impact of the Indian
Ocean Expedition is shown by eight
volumes of collected scientific reprints
and thirteen large atlases which have
since appeared. The expedition also
had a lasting beneficial effect in
strengthening the marine sciences
in some Member States of the region.
A deep-drilling programme has
extensively sampled the sediments
and volcanic basement of all the
world's oceans except the Arctic
Ocean (see article page 30). Unesco
and its Océanographie Commission
have been involved in directly related
activities such as organizing general
investigations and supporting sym¬
posia at quadri-annual océanographie
congresses, and the publication of
charts.
The deep-sea drilling programme
has made major contributions to the
advance of oceanography. It has
confirmed the plate tectonic theory
by finding that the earth's volcanic
basement gets older as its distance
from the mid-ocean rift increases and
that the ocean floor is spreading.
The programme has also reconstructed
the location of rifts and continents
through time and shown major and
violent changes in the ocean's circu¬
lation.
It has revealed major changes in
the salinity of the oceans with the
possibility that the ocean may even
have dried up in places.

THE OCEANS
Finally the deep-sea drilling pro¬
gramme has discovered vast depo¬
sits of salt, demonstrated the distri¬
bution of manganese nodules and
shown indications of petroleum and
ores.
Recognition that the ocean is
highly turbulent on all scales and at
all depths represents another impor¬
tant scientific advance. For instance,
surface and near-surface currents
have been shown to be highly dyna¬
mic, meandering in space and tran¬
sient in time, besides giving rise to
large offshoot eddies (see article
page 24). Furthermore, fast deep
currents hug the western borders of
deep basins; these currents have had
profound effects on the sea floor by
moving bottom sediments.
A co-operative investigation of the
mighty Kuroshio Current in the north¬
west Pacific has been impressively
successful in determining the current's
dynamics. The Indian Ocean Expe¬
dition showed that the equatorial
undercurrent varied with the mon¬
soon season. The Atlantic tropical
experiment examined the current
structure of the deep ocean. The
Mid-Ocean Dynamic Experiment ex¬
amined a single giant deepwater
eddy.
A major international scientific ef¬
fort by Member States, working
through the Océanographie Commis¬
sion in co-operation with the World
Meteorological Organization, is now
studying the ways in which the oceans
and the atmosphere interact, as
well as long-term changes in climate.
Such studies should allow more re¬
liable prediction of the weather, both
short-term and seasonal.
Studies of the chemistry of sea
water, marine sediments and marine
organisms through co-operative in¬
vestigations have traced the path
ways of various chemical compounds
through the water and through living
organisms, not only for the major
constituents such as sodium, calcium,
chloride and carbonate, but also for
trace elements such as mercury, fluo¬
rine, the rare earths and various radio¬
active elements. This has laid a firm
base for the study and control of
marine pollution, a field in which
Unesco and its Océanographie Com¬
mission have been active.
The nations of the world are co¬
operating in observation and in rapid
data exchange, through the Integrated
Global Ocean Station System which
aims to provide immediate access by
Member States to ocean temperature
and certain oil pollution data. A
global plan for the investigation of
marine pollution guides the Océano¬
graphie Commission's pollution
studies. A major effort in collabo¬
ration with the U. N. Environment
Programme and the U. N. Food and
Agriculture Organization is designed
to bring Mediterranean pollution
under control.
Studies on marine food chains,
nutrients and species identification
have provided major advances in eco¬
logical knowledge. This knowledge,
together with fishery statistics, has
allowed nations to co-operate effecti¬
vely and realistically in regional and
global management of marine fish¬
eries, thus providing an effective link
between the scientific activities of
Unesco and the fisheries activities of
FAO.
Nearshore, some equally striking
scientific advances have been made.
Much more is now understood about
the effects of the glacial lowering of
sea-level (some 200 metres), about
complex marine ecological systems
such as coral reefs, seaweed and
plankton communities, and about
nearshore marine geological pro¬
cesses and currents, etc. These
advances form a sound basis for the
management of man's coastal acti¬
vities by individual Member States.
Unesco and its Intergovernmental
Océanographie Commission have con¬
tributed to many of these interna¬
tional achievements, acting as a
catalyst or as a link in the chain of
international research.

THE
NEW WAVE
IN
OCEANOGRAPHY
scientists from 50 countries
chart the latest discoveries
in marine research
In 1960 Unesco created the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission (IOC) to promote international co-operation
in océanographie research. Today the Commission has
91 Member States and has launched major programmes
such as the International Decade of Ocean Exploration
(1971-1980). Above, the German (Dem. Rep.) ocean

and meteorological data.

OCEANOGRAPHY, once so
hypothetical a science that it
was almost an art, has now
reached the point where it can track
the movement of a continent over
1 00 million years or the migration of a
single flatfish over the continental
shelf. It can measure the state of
the sea with satellites looking down
from outer space or beams of sound
focussed up from remote depths.
It^has turned man's image of the
ocean topsy-turvy, transforming the
stately waltz of currents into a
variable pattern of eddies which pro¬
mises, however, to produce a truer
picture of how the seas function.
Yet with all these new accomplish¬
ments to their credit, the marine
sciences are now considered by some
to be in the gravest of dangers as the
politicization of the oceans proceeds
apace.
Such are the main impressions
DAN BEHRMAN, a Unesco science writer
well known to Unesco Courier readers, is the
author of The New World of the Oceans
(Little, Brown and Co., Boston, U.S.A.).
His latest book. Solar Energy, the Awakening
Science, was published in 1976 by Little,
Brown and Co.
conveyed by the Joint Océanographie
Assembly, held in September 1976
in Edinburgh (U. K.) with 700 scien¬
tists from some fifty countries in
attendance. Organized by six major
scientific associations and Britain's
Royal Society, it also received support
from the Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization, the Intergovernmental Océa¬
nographie Commission, Unesco and
the World Meteorological Organiza¬
tion.
In some respects, the Edinburgh
Assemblythe fourth of its kindwas
more subdued than its predecessors.
Much conjecture has been removed
from oceanography with the mopping-
up of the scientific controversy that
used to rage over "continental drift".
Only ten years ago, marine geologists
were still going at each other hammer
and tongs over the question of
whether or not the continents had
been pushed apart during geological
time by the sea floor spreading out
from mid-ocean ridges (1 ).
Everyone now agrees that this is
precisely what happened to give
birth to the present map of the earth,
its surface divided into great inter¬
locking plates grinding together where
their edges converge in zones of high

(Unesco Courier, October 1963).
Drifting"
seismic activity. At Edinburgh, geo¬
logists were able to apply the theory
of the moving continents to recons¬
truct the oceans of the past or to
indicate places where mineral re¬
sources may have developed.
The worldwide economic slowdown
of recent years has acted as a brake
on oceanography, a form of environ¬
mental research probably second only
to space exploration in cost. The
operation of a large research vessel
runs to thousands of dollars a day; the
figure can be doubled in some cases
if a submersible is involved.
But the biggest cloud of all is uncer¬
tainty over the way that marine
research will be carried out in the
future. The United Nations Confer¬
ence on the Law of the Sea has yet
to agree on the rules under which
oceanographers will operate in the
coastal waters where they do most of
their work.
In a public lecture that he gave in
Edinburgh in connexion with the
assembly, Dr. Roger Revelle, former
director of Scripps Institution of Ocea¬
nography, in La Jolla, California, and
later Professor of Population Policy
at Harvard University, saw in certain
tendencies at the Conference on the
Law of the Sea "an especially terri¬
fying threat" to océanographie
research.'

They imply, in his opinion, the pla¬
cing of limitations on coastal research
in economic zones extending 200
miles or more offshore. "Fish cur¬
rents and geological phenomena do
not understand economic zones,"
Dr. Revelle said, "but most geological
and geophysical phenomena occur
within two to three hundred miles
offshore.
"If the present tendency at the
Conference on the Law of the Sea
continues, it will likely be the death
of the ocean sciences as we have
known them for the last 25 or 30
years." Dr. Revelle thought they
would have to take on a new form
which would investigate special phe¬
nomena instead of seeking "a real
understanding of the oceans."
Dr. Revelle made a point of punc¬
turing certain widely-held illusions
about the role that the oceans are
likely to play in the future of man.
The sea will not be a source of fresh
water to make deserts bloom. Costs
of desalinating seawater are from ten
to sixty times higher than what far¬
mers pay for irrigation water.
However, seawater itself could be
used for the purpose. "Marine
grasses know how to live in salt water
thanks to a piece of DNA. It may be
possible to tear this gene out of salt
marsh plants and put it into corn.
wheat, rice or potatoes so that they
will grow in salt water."
Nor is the sea likely to feed the
world. The annual marine fish catch
runs around 60 million tons and,
Dr. Revelle said, it is not likely to
amount to more than 100 million
tons. This represents 20 million
tons of protein, as against the 100
million tons that would be needed
every year by a world population of
6,500 million at the end of the cen¬
tury. In terms of calories, he said,
the sea could only supply five per cent
of world needs.
He regarded the space that the sea
will be able to offer as a resource for
the future. Floating structures built
on deep spar buoys remain almost
motionless in the ocean. They
could be used to house activities that
are not wanted on shore, such as
nuclear power plants or industries
carrying a threat of pollution. "Solar
energy will need space, too," he said.
"One could imagine great fields of
solar power generators at sea."
Dr. Revelle took up the part that the
sea might play in future climatológ¬
ica! change. During the industrial era,
we have burned the equivalent of
100 million years of solar energy
stored in coal, oil and natural gasthe
fossil fuels. A large part of the
carbon dioxide released during this
process has been taken up by the
ocean but its capacity is not infinite.
"If we double the present amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
only one-third will be absorbed into
the ocean."
This could lead to an intensifica¬
tion of the so-called greenhouse
effect in which excess carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere acts to trap the
heat the earth receives from the sun,
inhibiting its radiation back into space.
Terrestrial temperatures could build
up to the point where the Antarctic
and Greenland ice caps would melt,
raising sea level by several hundred
feet, with obvious consequences.
Other scientists at the Edinburgh
Assembly brought up this possibility
which had been discounted in recent
years as an apparent worldwide
cooling trend set in. One of them.
Dr. Wallace S. Broecker of the
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observa¬
tory in Palisades, N.Y., has postulated
that we may be on the brink of a
several-decades-long period of rapid
warming.
Examination of an ice core taken in
Greenland, which has enabled scien¬
tists to read past changes in tempera¬
ture, indicates that the present
cooling is one of a series of natural
fluctuations. Thus it may have ser¬
ved to mask the effect of the release

The strange and beautiful forms we
present on this double page spread are
the remains (except for those in photo 2)
of some of the countless tiny marine
organismsplants, animals and inter¬
mediate specieswhich when they die
"rain" gently to the sea bed. Forming
sediments covering millions of square
miles, these "skeletons" help oceanogra-
phers and undersea oil prospectors to
date the formation of the ocean floor.
Scientists are intensively studying some
of these microscopic creatures, the fora-
minifera (photos 1 and 2), notably their
reproductive mechanisms. Photo 2 is an
extremely rare document showing the
mating of two foraminifera, each mea¬
suring less than half a millimetre. Pretty
cluster of "powder puffs" (3) consists of
fragments of a tiny chalk algae. It was
found in the Indian Ocean at a depth of
2,000 metres, like this sea-bed sample
(5) showing the tightly packed mass of
chalky plates constituting the sediment.
The largest, hat-shaped specimen mea¬
sures only two hundredths of a milli¬
metre. The bristling perforated "skeleton"
of another minute creature, the radiola-
rian (6) came from the same waters.
Photo 4 shows two fossilized algae: the
circular specimen nestling against the
"mushroom stalk" enabled scientists to
date the sediment where it was found as
less than 250,000 years old.

of carbon dioxide (C02). The ice
core indicates that the drop in temp¬
erature may end during the next
decade and then the greenhouse
effect would serve to accelerate a
natural upturn.
"The major point of the argu¬
ment," Dr. Broecker has written, "is
that over the past 30 years the warm¬
ing trend due to C02 has been more
than countered by a natural cooling.
This compensation cannot long con¬
tinue both because of the rapid
growth of the C02 effect and because
the natural cooling will almost cer¬
tainly soon bottom out. We may be
in for a climatic surprise. The onset
of the era of C02-induced warming
may be much more dramatic than in
the absence of natural climatic
variations."
Another of man's effects on the
ocean came up at Edinburgh with a
report on the long-term pollutant
effects of DDT and PCBs (polychlori-
nated biphenyls). It was found off
southern California that while the
amounts of these substances dumped
into the ocean had been cut almost
tenfold, their levels in the muscle
tissue of Dover sole caught in off¬
shore waters had not decreased at all.
Researchers could only conclude
that marine sediments are acting as
reservoirs for these pollutants.
Disposal far out at sea may not be
an answer, either. Experiments
made at the Woods Hole Océanogra¬
phie Institution in Massachusetts
indicate that phytoplankton (that is,
marine plant life) in estuaries stands
up much better under physical
stress, such as exposure to toxic
compounds in the water, than species
living in the more stable conditions of
the open ocean.
THEbehaviouroftheopen ocean
on a large scale is undergoing
a serious reappraisal by phy¬
sical oceanographers. Dr. Walter H.
Munk, director of the Institute of Geo¬
physics and Planetary Physics at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
pointed out that oceanographers had
hitherto charted the oceans in terms
of current systems and thought they
merely needed to keep filling in their
charts with more and more tempera¬
ture and salinity measurements.
It turns out that these current sys¬
tems represent only one per cent of
the kinetic energy of the oceans.
The other 99 per cent is contained in
the exceptions to the rule, the eddies
that break off from the major currents
and move through the oceans the way
storms move through the atmosphere
(See article page 24).
Improved observations from artifi¬
cial satellites could help keep track
of oceanic circulations and Dr. John
Apel of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, in the
U. S., told of several promising dev
elopments. In particular, satellites
should be able to measure sea surface
temperatures with an accuracy of
1.5 °C, halving their present margin
of error and providing a valuable tool
for spotting the eddies and rings that
the Gulf Stream generates.
Like other océanographie tech¬
niques, the satellites are becoming
more and more finely tuned. At first,
they were good for not much more
than scanning the surface of the
ocean; now they can see fifty or
sixty metres down, enabling them to
do some rough charting of the bottom.
As pollution monitors, they are in
a class by themselves. Dr. Apel
displayed slides showing how acid
dumping off New York City stains the
sea as if it were being dyed with a
marbled effect on the surface nearby,
an indication of light oily cover.
Another spacecraft can measure wind
speeds virtually on a global scale.
Abreakthrough of much greater
proportions has been achieved
in the study of the oceans of
the past. The Deep Sea Drilling Pro¬
ject, managed by Scripps for the Na¬
tional Science Foundation in the
United States, has punched more
than 400 holes into the sea floor with
its drilling ship, the Glomar Challenger
article page 30).
The cores that the drilling project
has brought up can be dated with
uncanny precision by correlating them
with reversals in the earth's magnetic
field registered by the spreading
sea floor acting like a tape recorder.
Changes in the minute fossil animal
life contained in the cores indicate
rises or drops in the temperature of
the sea that could occur with the
end or the beginning of an ice age.
Drilling in the Antarctic Ocean, as
described by Dr. James P. Kennettof
the University of Rhode Island, indi¬
cates that glaciers appeared on Antarc¬
tica 38 million years ago when
Australia had drifted away, opening
up the southern ocean with its in¬
tense round-the-world circulation
braked by no intervening land mass.
Other researchers working on the
North Atlantic have been able to
trace the movements of the Polar
Frontwhere cold Arctic and warm
Atlantic waters meetover a period
of 65,000 years. As Dr. William F.
Piuddiman of the City University of
New York, remarked, the position of
the Polar Front is one of the funda¬
mental controls of the earth's heat
budget. It acts as a gate that either
channels or bars the northwards
transport of energy by the ocean.
This quest through the past has
its relevance in present-day investi¬
gations of how changes in the earth's
climate appear. There are imme¬
diate economic applications as well.
Dr. John G. Sclater, of the Massa¬
chusetts Institute of Technology, ob
served that it is easier to look for oil
off the shores of Africa if one knows
exactly how that coast was once
joined to the Americas where petro¬
leum-bearing formations have been
extensively charted.
Dr. K. 0. Emery of Woods Hole
Océanographie Institution talked of
some of these economic implications.
Virtually all the oceanic resources
now being exploited are on the conti¬
nental shelf. Oil and gas lead with
a value in 1975 of $44,000 million,
followed by fishing with $ 15,000 mil¬
lion; sand and gravel for construction
purposes $400 million and mining of
placer deposits, mainly tin, titanium
and zircon, and magnetite $ 40 mil¬
lion. The future might see more
attention paid to deeper waters on the
continental margin.
Dr. Emery spoke of that process by
which new sea floor is formed, rising
from the earth's mantle through the
mid-ocean ridges. Seawater in¬
filtrating this molten material is bound
to pick up heavy metals and eject
them, an event that had apparently
occurred in the middle of the Red Sea
where mineral bearing sediments es¬
timated to be worth billions of dollars
have been found.
FAMOUS, the survey of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge conducted by French
and American oceanographers (see
article page 30) was able to pick up a
geological sample only two metres
from the vent of such a hydrothermal
source.
Analysis of the sample showed that
it consisted of iron, pure manganese
and silicate left by the shells of small
animals. Ten metres from the vent,
the composition of the bottom mat¬
erial had already changed. French
scientists estimate the age of the
sample at 47,000 years, but its first
layer of consolidated sediment
1.1 millimetres thick was only 50
years old.
SO far, no metal-rich sediment
beds similar to those of the
Red Sea have been found near
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Emery ad¬
vised geologists to look instead for
areas where spreading ended millions
of years ago after material first welled
up from the mantle, leaving plumes
such as the famed diamond pipes of
South Africa. Lines of plumes might
now be buried under sediments along
continental margins and prospection
there could be more fruitful than
around the mid-ocean ridges.
There is not too much hope of
finding oil where great plates converge
because they grind up and wipe
away the ocean's sediments. But
areas where plates diverge offer the
possibility that a large amount of
sedimentsand oilmay have accu¬
mulated along the sides of continental
margins at depths much greater than
those now being worked by the
offshore oil industry.

### 46514: The New wave in oceanography; scientists from 50 countries chart the latest discoveries in marine research

Dr. Emery pointed out that the
Deep Sea Drilling Project avoids such
areas out of fear of finding oil. What
is needed is a bigger ship with valves
and blowout control" equipment to
handle an oil strike without creating
an almost insoluble pollution problem.
The Assembly heard several reports
of possible new sources of marine
wealth. Dr. George P. Woollard of
the Institute of Geophysics at the Uni¬
versity of Hawaii, told of recent
research in the Bauer Basin 4,000
metres down and more than 2,000
miles off the coast of South America
between two major sea floor features,
the Galapagos Rise and the East Paci¬
fic Rise.
HERE scientists found a 20-metre
thickness of metal-bearing se¬
diments on the bottom con¬
taining copper, nickel, zinc and iron
in amounts "several orders of magni¬
tude larger than in the Red Sea".
Woollard estimates that there are
a trillion dollars of gold down in the
Bauer Basin and that is the rarest of
the metals in its sediments. The
catch is that all this treasure is not
only 2,000 fathoms deep but spread
over an area measuring 600 by
1,000 nautical miles.
Prospection for manganese nodules
is much further advanced. Deposits
in the Pacific Ocean were investigated
early in January 1976 by a research
vessel, the Valdivia, for the Federal
Institute for Geosciences and Natu¬
ral Resources in the Federal Republic
of Germany. Dr. H. Gundlach repor¬
ted that nodule samples were found
to be inhabited by large bacteria and
this has led German scientists to
conclude that the start of the process
of the formation of the nodules is
microbiological.
One should not jump to conclusions
about skyhigh returns from the bot¬
tom of the sea. An economic ana¬
lysis by another scientist from the
German Federal Republic, Dr. F. Neu-
weiler, concluded that deepsea mi¬
ning of manganese nodules is not
economic at present mineral prices.
This may change as land reserves are
depleted and ecological factors come
into play when new deposits are
sought, but the political and legal
problems of marine mining are
equally large.
Dr. Neuweiler estimated that a
plant processing three million tons a
year of manganese nodules would
need 80,000 square kilometres of
seabed to be assured of a twenty-
year supply of raw materials. Des¬
pite all these obstacles, he noted
that three firms are already testing
methods of mining nodules.
One should not lose one's sense of
proportion in discussing deep-sea
mineral deposits. Copper and nickel
are the two most valuable metals
present in the 18 trillion tons of
manganese nodules on the ocean
floor. Dr. Emery reminds us that
total world production of these two
metals in 1 975 amounted to $ 1 0,000
million. If the ocean were to take
10 per cent of the market, this would
run to only $ 1 ,000 million, a fraction
of the revenue represented by fishing,
that most traditional of all ways of
working the sea.
Here, oceanographers at Edinburgh
were cautious in evaluating the
future. Notwithstanding improve¬
ments in fish-finding gear and the
launching of more efficient vessels,
catches do not rise accordingly.
They follow a bell curve, climbing
steeply at first when a new fishery
expands, then falling.
The literature is littered with
accounts of vanished fisheries. A
typical case is that of the West
Greenland cod reported by two
Danish researchers, F. Hermann and
Sr. Aa. Horsted. In 1962, 451,000
tons were caught; in 1975, 46,000.
Heavy fishing takes some of the
blame but environmental changes
are held to be mainly responsible.
Water temperatures rose off West
Greenland in the 1920s and 1930s,
then suddenly dropped to their pre¬
vious levels.
ON E apparent exception has been
the North Sea. Dr. Gotthilf
Hempel of the Institute for
Marine Sciences at Kiel in the Federal
Republic of Germany showed how
fish catches there, after running bet¬
ween one million and 1 .5 million tons
since the start of the century, shot up
during the 1960s to reach 3.7 million
tons in 1974. Species like the herr¬
ing and the mackerel are on the wane
while new industrial fisheries have
sprung up, their catches destined
for conversion into animal feed
instead of direct human consumption.
There was a good deal of discussion
as to whether heavy waste discharges
by countries bordering the North Sea
are fertilizing its waters and thereby
maintaining increased fish popula¬
tions but no satisfactory answers
have been found.
Arthur J. Lee of the Fisheries Lab¬
oratory at Lowestoft, in the U.K.,
thought that some of man's acti¬
vities in the North Sea might
threaten its fish population in the
future. "Cod, haddock, whiting and
sprat all spawn in the centre of the
North Sea where oil is produced. No
one has calculated the possible
damage to a year class that would
be caused by an oil spill and the use
of dispersants."
Some highly sophisticated tech¬
niques have been developed to
explain the movements of fish.
F. R. Harden Jones of the- Fisheries
Laboratory at Lowestoft has been
studying the migration of commercial
species from the viewpoint of the
fish itself whose aim in life is to find
food without burning up too much
energy in the process. Herring
will migrate 1,600 kilometres in the
North Sea and 3,000 in the Atlantic;
the corresponding figures for cod are
1,300 and 2,600 kilometres.
TO track a moving fish, the
Lowestoft laboratory devised
an acoustic tag about the size
of one's little finger and weighing only
1.5 grammes in water. They attach
their tag to a plaice and throw the
fish overboard, following it aboard
a ship equipped with a high-resolu¬
tion sonar that can locate it to
within one or two metres in depth.
In one experiment, they tailed a
plaice for twenty-six hours on a
southward course from Lowestoft
and learned how the fish gets the
most ground speed over the bottom
for the least swimming effort. It
simply swam with the tide and then,
during slack water, dropped to the
bottom.
Harden Jones believes that the
fish used the tide as its clock, not
the sun. Near the end of a six-
hour tidal period, it would drop to
the bottom then come up again
when it sensed that the water was
still moving the way it wanted to go.
With regions like the North Sea at
the limit of their yields, fishermen
are constantly seeking new seas to
conquer. But some cold polar water
was dashed on the often-expressed
hope that the Antarctic Ocean can
meet the protein demand of an ever-
multiplying world population by
Dr. Sayed Z. El-Sayed, of Texas
A & M University, a leading autho¬
rity on the Antarctic.
The primary productivity of the
Antarcticthat is, the rate at which
photosynthesis is carried out by the
phytoplanktonhas been found to
run as high as 3.62 grammes of car¬
bon per square metre per day west
of the Antarctic Peninsula, a figure
comparable to the major highly pro¬
ductive areas of the world ocean,
such as the Peruvian coast where
the anchovies swarm in the world's
largest fishery.
But the average value for the
Antarctic Ocean as a whole is only
134 grammes of carbon per square
metre per day, a figure more or less
comparable to primary productivity
in the Gulf of Mexico and the Carib¬
bean Seahardly major productive
regions.
Dr. El-Sayed found several factors
to explain this sharp downward revi¬
sion. It was previously thought that
some species of plant plankton
could achieve rich growth in waters
as cold as -1 .5°C. Recent research,
however, indicates that low tempe¬
ratures will inhibit growth of even
the phytoplankton species adapted
to the Antarctic.
There is a physical explanation as
well. Antarctic water varies little in
temperature from top to bottom

^and, consequently, the ocean is not
"stratified" in layers of different
temperatures. So the water mixes
easily in depth, carrying the phyto¬
plankton below the sunlit and hence
more productive zone of the ocean.
Nevertheless, Dr. El-Sayed believes
that this rate of primary productivity
is high enough to support the
animal population of Antarctica
which requires some 200 million
tons of food, mostly krill, every
year. Because of this relative sim¬
plicity is, heavy dependence
on a single species, krillthe An¬
tarctic ecosystem is more vulnerable
than those of other oceans. "We
need to intensify our research effort
and to gain a deeper understanding
of the Antarctic ecosystem before
exploiting its resources," Dr. El-
Sayed said.
That is no easy matter in the
Antarctic or any other ocean where
nothing holds still to be studied.
Dr. John H. Steele of the Marine
Laboratory at Aberdeen, in the U.K.,
summed up the problem: phyto¬
plankton live from one to ten days
and move from one to ten kilometres
during this period; Zooplankton (the
small animals that graze on the phyto¬
plankton) live one hundred days and
drift one hundred kilometres during
their lifetimes; fish are around for
years and cover thousands of kilo¬
metres.
Biologists have tried to sample an
area of 100 square kilometres for
100 days, but 20 ships were needed.
It is much cheaper and convenient to
work with captive oceans, enclosures
of sea water where at least vertical
movements of the plankton can be
studied at something like their true
scale without any outside interference.
Several approaches were described
at Edinburgh: plastic bags can be
placed in the sea to isolate anywhere
from six to 2,000 cubic metres of
water, giving the researcher a control¬
led environment; a tower tank can be
erected on dry land and filled with
seawater as has been done at Scripps
and at Dalhousie University at Halifax
in Canada; bell jars can be placed on
the sea floor to set off a few square
metres so that the growth of bottom
organisms may be watched; or, as the
Belgians have done at Ostend, a huge
artificial lagoon covering 86 hectares
and originally built as a reservoir for
flushing harbour channels is used to
study the life cycle of oysters.
On the Pacific coast in an inlet
near Vancouver Island Canadian
researchers have used bags holding
some 2,000 tons of water to run
Controlled Ecosystems Pollution Exp¬
eriments, adding minute quantities
of copper, mercury and various types
of petroleum to see their effect
on marine life (see article page 28).
Imagination is in demand in ocea¬
nography for new ways must always
be sought to look at the sea. "Look"
is a manner of speaking; seawater is
almost impenetrable to light and even
the laser cannot carry more than a
few hundred metres.
Sound is a different matter. Acad¬
emician L. M. Brekhovskikh from the
U.S.S.R. talked to the Assembly
about acoustic sensing of what
occurs in the ocean. Here is a ver¬
satile tool. A sound wave with a
frequency of 100,000 herz (that is,
cycles per second) will carry only
200 metres, but sound at a frequency
of 1 00 herz can be detected 1 00 kilo¬
metres away. This property, as we
have seen, has been used to follow
floats measuring the movement of
currents in the deep oceans.
Academician Brekhovskikh sug¬
gested listening to the ocean itself.
"One can detect many things. One
can hear surface waves, turbulence,
the waves of remote storms, and
seismic activity on the bottom."
He made a strong case for acoustic
sensing. "We have entered an era in
which we need more information
about the ocean. We get 1,000
times less from the ocean than we do
from the atmosphere. We cannot
learn much when we work in contact
with surface water masses. We
must use remote sensing and acou¬
stics gives us this possibility. "
Prof. John Isaacs of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography brought
up an unexpected topic: salinity po¬
wer. As is well known and as
Dr. Revelle recalled, it takes a great
deal of energy to desalinate water.
Energy therefore should be released
by salinationthat is, when a river
meets an ocean. Prof. Isaacs turned
to his Edinburgh audience: "Who
could consider that the River Tweed
flowing smoothly into the sea repre¬
sents as much energy as if it were
poised 700 feet above sea level ?"
Research on salinity power was
described by Dr. Sidney Loeb of the
Research and Development Authority
at the Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev in Israel. If one places a
semi-permeable membrane between
fresh and salt water, osmosis will
drive the fresh water into the salt
water. The energy obtained is repre¬
sented by the osmotic pressure"an
osmotic waterfall". Dr. Loeb called it.
It amounts to 1 5 atmospheres, not
at all negligible, but a tenth of what
could be obtained if seawater were
combined with brine such as, for
example, the waters of the Dead Sea.
The catch lies in the cost of the mem¬
branes which drive the price of
osmotic power up four times as high
as the rate for a kilowatt-hour of
electricity in the United States.
Dr. Loeb spoke of another approach,
a "dialytic battery", a reversal of the
technique of electrodialysis in which
a current is used to desalinate sea
water. "The costs of the dialytic
battery are much higher now, but the
future looks much more promising.
We should be able to reduce the cost
of membranes by a factor of ten while
doubling membrane life."
Dr. Isaacs called salinity power an
"immense, hidden and almost invi¬
sible source of energy", equal to that
represented by the difference in tem¬
perature between the surface and the
deep in tropical Oceans. While effi¬
ciency is low, only 3 per cent at pre¬
sent, this did not worry him. "If
we got only one hundredth of one
per cent for a little village at the
mouth of the Ganges River, this
would be appreciable."
Summing up the subject, which
had been presented for the first time
to an international océanographie
assembly, he declared: "It epitomizes
the large class of surprises the ocean
will ever hold for its students."

THE TRAGEDY OF LEVIATHAN
All species of "great" whalesthe leviathans of
the oceanare threatened with extinction because
of intensive whaling. The International Whaling
Commission was established in 1946 to protect
whales from overexploitation. It fixes annual catch
quotas and has prohibited the hunting of some
species such as the humpback whale (photo left)
since 1963 and the blue whale since .1965.
Howeverrno measurable increase in~thë"numbers of
even these "protected" species has occurred since.
Clusters of tiny creatures in photo below are white
whales basking in the sea off Somerset Island
(Canada). One of the smaller species the white
whale is exceptional in not being currently in
danger of extinction. This remarkable photo
was taken from 300 metres above the sea with
a special "water penetration film".
Dr. Roger S. Payne of the Institute for Research
in Animal Behaviour, New York, recently discovered
that whales "sing", producing repeated sequences
of strange, ethereal sounds. Opposite page,

### 46515: Hidden dynamos of Neptune's powerhouse; eddies in mid-ocean may generate far more power than major currents like the Gulf Stream

HIDDEN DYNAMOS
OF NEPTUNE'S
POWERHOUSE
eddies in mid ocean may generate far more
power than major currents like the Gulf Stream
by Konstantin N. Fedorov
ONE of the most important
developments in modern ocea¬
nography is the study of the
many ways in which the ocean trans¬
forms its energy. This research has
recently been given new impetus by
the remarkable discovery that a tre¬
mendous amount of the energy in
the oceans comes from mid-ocean
eddies that break off from the major
currents.
How does the ocean work? Solar
energy is constantly being pumped
into the ocean, which swallows it up,
stores it away and then redistributes
it as it circulates over the globe. And
this indeed is how the ocean "works".
The energy supplied by the Sun,
either directly or through the atmo¬
spheric movements which we call
winds, keeps the ocean permanently
moving. The best known of the
ocean's movements are the currents
and waves; these were the elements
most familiar to every seafarer from
the earliest days of human history.
Scientists of the past have tried to
trace, describe and chart the ocean
currents, hoping that one day the
picture would be complete and would
greatly facilitate navigation and wea¬
ther forecasting.
But it was not plain sailing. The
currents proved to be capricious
creatures, and displayed- not only
seasonal or tidal variations which
were relatively easy to track and to
predict, but many others, which

for Ocean Research (SCOR) of the Interna¬
tional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) is a
well-known Soviet oceanographer. Director

the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, he is the .

governmental Océanographie Commission.

were as unexpected as they were
unpredictable.
A wide spectrum of variability was
soon discovered, and this did not fit
any traditional concept of yesterday's
"DC-oceanography", as it was descri¬
bed at the 1976 Joint Océanographie
Assembly in Edinburgh by Prof. Walter
Munk, the well-known American geo-
physicist (see article page 16).
But even "AC-oceanography"
would not be an appropriate descrip¬
tion of the approach to adopt, since
the variability involved is in fact far
more complicated than the harmoni¬
cally oscillating voltage of a domestic
electrical plug.
This variability puzzled oceanogra¬
phers for many years. The changes
affected not only currents but temp¬
erature, salinity, sound velocity, and
many other physical features of the
ocean environment. Why was Nature
so fickle ?
The scientists decided to go to sea
themselves and measure all these
parameters over as long a period as
possible in one and the same spot,
in order to see how long it would
take to determine mean or average
values which would not change
however many times they repeated
the same series of measurements.
The pioneering work by the scien¬
tific team under Prof. V. B. Stockmann
of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences,
which began as long ago as 1956
on the Black Sea, was continued in
1958 in the North Atlantic" and in
1967 in the Indian Ocean, but it was
only in 1970, when a large-scale
multi-ship and multi-buoy experiment
was mounted by the U.S.S.R. in the
tropical northeastern Atlantic, that
their efforts were successful.
This experiment was called "POLY-
GON-70" after the Russian word
which means "proving ground", and
oceanographers from the U.S.A.,
the Federal Republic of Germany,
the German Democratic Republic and
Canada joined the Soviet scientists
for a time on the research vessel
Akademik Kurchatov.
The experiment lasted for almost
seven months, and observations
revealed something new and totally
unexpected for many, suspected
by some, but definitely never seen
before by anyone. The widely spread
"net" of surface-floats fitted with
current meters in fact "caught" a
gigantic eddy, and registered data
which made it possible to plot the
course of what seemed to be an
uncommon type of ocean movement.
The eddy was elliptical in shape;
it measured about 400 km along its
longer axis, and drifted slowly west¬
ward at a speed of 4-6 centimetres
per second. Water inside the eddy
was swirling in a clockwise direction
at speeds of up to 50 cm/sec. A few
years earlier, in 1957 and 1959-60,
American and British scientists using
neutral buoyancy floats, invented
by a British oceanographer, John
Swallow, from the research vessel
Aries in the Atlantic Ocean had disco¬



vered unusual variations in currents |
deep below the surface. In the light I

### 46515: Hidden dynamos of Neptune's powerhouse; eddies in mid-ocean may generate far more power than major currents like the Gulf Stream

of Polygon's findings, their discovery
took on a new meaning.
Gradually the scientists came to
understand that the kinetic energy of
an eddy may greatly exceed the kin¬
etic energy of the general current.
This state of affairs was quite new to
the oceanographers, although it was
by no means unfamiliar to meteoro¬
logists, who were accustomed to the
strong and variable winds of cyclonic
and anticyclonic disturbances con¬
tained within relatively slow-moving
westerly airstreams over a wide span
of moderate latitudes.
The discovery posed a thousand
new questions to the scientists.
Where did the ocean eddies get their
energy? Did they feed on the mean
flow, profiting from its variability?
Or were they, on the contrary, sup¬
plying energy to the mean flow ? If
so, were they themselves the product
of atmospheric disturbances? Were
the mountains at the bottom of the
sea somehow responsible for their
birth? Hew many eddies were there
in the ocean?
To answer these and many other
questions, a new expedition, called
MODE-1 (Mid-Ocean Dynamic Expe¬
riment), was organized in 1973, this
time by American scientists, with
colleagues from the U.S.S.R., the
United Kingdom and France. Avery
complex network of instruments was
deployed for a period of several
months in the area of the western
Atlantic known as the Sargasso Sea.
As a result, more eddies were spotted
and described, and a vast number of
measurements were taken to obtain
data concerning their dynamics.
One of the most remarkable techni¬
cal achievements of the Mode-1
experiment was the wide use of the
so-called SOFAR (Sound Fixing and
Ranging) floatsfreely drifting deep
water acoustic devices which could
be tracked by shorebased stations
with a high degree of accuracy at
distances of thousands of sea miles.
Twenty such SOFAR floats were
released at a depth of 1,500 m. and
many of them were still being tracked
late in 1975.
With the development of remote-
sensing techniques and of high reso¬
lution infra-red radiometers in parti¬
cular, it has become possible to
observe the variability and tempera¬
ture of ocean currents from earth
satellites. The most striking pictures
obtained in this way are those which
show the "banks" of the Gulf Stream
and the eddies, or "rings", produced
in the course of its slow meanderings.
From the data provided by Polygon,
Mode and other observations a new
picture was emerging of an ocean
more or less densely packed with
eddies measuring between 100 km.
and 200 km. in diameter, and all
moving slowly in a westerly direction.
Why is it so important to know
about these eddies ? Why are whole
fleets of océanographie vessels, valu
able scientific instruments and hun¬
dreds of scientists and technicians
now being mobilized in this investiga¬
tion? Here we come back once again
to our original question, how does the
ocean work? It is precisely because
the ocean's "work" affects our every¬
day life so much that we cannot
afford to ignore the niceties of its
behaviour.
What interests us most of all is
the process of heat exchange. It is
commonly believed that the atmo¬
sphere "drives" the ocean, and al¬
though this is indeed true in many
respects, the feedback from the ocean
into the atmosphere is in some cases
so strong that it determines to a
great extent the weather and climate
over vast areas of dry land.
Consider for a moment that the
mass of the ocean is approximately
300 times greater than that of the
atmosphere over the same surface
area. It follows, with the difference
in heat capacities taken into account,
that the heat stored by the entire
atmosphere is equivalent to the heat'
contained in just the top three metres
of water in the ocean.
The transfer of heat from one place
to another by ocean currents is a
complicated enough matter. But
suppose the eddies also take part
in the process, as in fact they do !
If we have not yet even learned to
predict the transfer of heat by ocean
currents, how can we begin to predict
the heat effect of ocean eddies ?
One way in which scientists are
trying to improve their forecasting
capacities is by constructing mathe¬
matical models of general ocean
circulation so that computers can be
set to work in resolving the hydro-
dynamic and thermodynamic equa¬
tions which describe the conservation
of energy momentum and heat in the
ocean.
Theoreticians have already been
able to model the oceanic eddy field
with the aid of powerful computers,
and new models of general circula¬
tion are also being developed which
include the movements of eddies.
Lessons from the distant geological
past of our planet can also help
in the development of forecasting
methods. As the Assembly in Edin¬
burgh pointed out, paleo-oceanogra-
phythe science of the ancient ocean
one of the most fascinating and
dynamically developing branches of
modern marine science.
By combining evidence from geo¬
logy, geomorphology, sedimentology,
micropaleontology, modern plate tec¬
tonics, marine physics, chemistry,,
biology and biochemistry, scientists
are now able to reconstruct reliable
pictures of the World Ocean as it
was during different stages of the
creation of the earth.
These pictures show us that its
general circulation was very different
from what we see today, and that
the patterns changed with the climate

PERIODICALLY, the hue and cry
is raised that a sea is dead or
an ocean is dying. And, just
as often, authorities reply that there
is really nothing to worry about as
long as a few precautions are taken.
The fuss usually starts with a sud¬
den event like an oil spill, a tainted
fish catch or an accident in a chemi¬
cal plant, then dies away just as
quickly when the mess is cleaned up
so that we may go on doing things
more or less the same way.
But where does the truth lie ?
Who is right, the prophets of doom
or the voices that soothe? What
exactly are the dangers of marine
pollution ? How can we detect them
in time to protect ourselves and our
seas?
Such questions were part of the
brief given Dr. Edward D. Goldberg of
Scripps Institution of Oceanography
at La Jolla, California, one of the
world's foremost marine chemists,
when he set out to prepare a preli¬
minary report on "The Health of the
Oceans", which has just been pub¬
lished by Unesco, in Paris, on behalf
of its Intergovernmental Océanogra¬
phie Commission.
What Dr. Goldberg stresses is not
so much the soiled beach or the lit¬
tered bay but much more subtle
effects. "Some of today's concerns
will be tomorrow's irrelevancies," he
writes. "It is probable that the
petroleum supplies of the world will
be exhausted before effective mea¬
sures to substantially reduce leaks
to the oceans are instituted. In the
future, the rising costs of heavy
metals will cause greater re-use and
less loss to the environment than is
now being experienced...
"On the other hand, the long resi¬
dence times of chemicals in the open
ocean may lead to the formation of a
toxic broth through the slow accu¬
mulation of man's wastes. There is
taking place today in the deep waters
of the open oceans a gradual but
continuous build-up of synthetic che¬
micals containing chlorine, and some¬
times fluorine, atoms, the so-called
halocarbons. Initially entering the
coastal ocean through sewer outfalls
and the surface waters of the open
ocean via the atmosphere as gases,
they are transferred by physical and
biological processes to the deep
ocean in less than a decade.
"Some of these chemicals are
known to interfere with metabolic
processes of living organisms. The
heavier compounds like DDT or the
polychlorinated biphenyls (the PCBs)
affect the calcium metabolism of
marine birds with the result that their
eggs have thin shells.
"Other chemicals such as the chlo-
rofluorocarbons, which are used as
aerosol propellants, may interfere
with the fermentation of micro-orga¬
nisms. As a possible consequence,
the breakdown of organic matter in
the normal biochemical cycles would
be inhibited. In addition, man's use
of fermentation, such as in sewage-
digestion systems and in the produc¬
tion of wines and beers, could be
affected adversely.
"Our concern is the haunting pos¬
sibility that levels of a toxic material
can rise so high that exposure of
organisms to such material in the
open ocean, as well as in the coas¬
tal ocean, may result in widespread
mortality or disease.
"For today there is no turning
back. The great volume of the open
ocean makes removal of a toxic subs¬
tance, identified by a catastrophic
event, an endeavour beyond man¬
kind's capabilities with" the techno¬
logies of today or of the foreseeable
future...
"The slow but continuous altera¬
tion of the open-ocean waters can
offer future generations the legacy of
a poisonous ocean. Today, we are
adding annually millions of tons of
synthetic compounds, such as halo-
genated hydrocarbons, to the ocean
system. If these substances mix
with the deep ocean, they will be
transferred within a decade to zones
below the mixed layer, where they
may remain for thousands of years...
At what level might they irreversibly
damage the ecosystem ?"
Dr. Goldberg remarks that surveil¬
lance of the state of the ocean's
health to ward off such a disaster is
beyond the economic and scientific ^
resources of any single nation. The r

getting under way. This time, it is
a Soviet-American venture called
POLYMODE (a marriage of Polygon
and Mode), designed to provide us
with more information about ocean
eddies and their role in the ocean's
internal dynamics. Various elements
of the experiment will cover most of
the western Atlantic, while in parts
of the eastern Atlantic scientists from
the United Kingdom, France and the
Federal Republic of Germany are
setting up their own observation
networks.
One of Polymode's tasks will be
to find out how uniformly eddy energy
is distributed over the ocean. There
is already evidence that in . some
parts of the ocean eddies appear
more frequently and contain more
energy than in others.
Polymode will operate throughout
1977 and 1978. Will it dispel the
mystery of ocean eddies once and
for all ? Certainly not, but the co¬
operation of scientists from different
countries will continue, and this is
one of the most hopeful signs of the
times we live in. The ocean's store¬
house must be opened for all mankind.

problem is ocean-sized, yet there are
less than a dozen laboratories in the
world capable of measuring DDT or
petroleum components in sea water.
The number of laboratories analy¬
sing concentrations of elements such
as plutonium, is about the same and,
states Dr. Goldberg, the development
of nuclear-power plants in coastal
areas raises the possibility of a large
number of small leaks of waste mate¬
rials over long periods which can
eventually produce a dangerously
radioactive ocean.
Old approaches have been found
wanting. The first measurements of
DDT in the atmosphere were a thou¬
sand times too low because only its
particulate forms were being analy¬
sed. We now know that it moves
about the surface of the earth mainly
in the vapour state.
The general assumption that petro¬
leum is entirely biodegradable and
that bacteria in the sea are prima¬
rily responsible for its decomposition
does not seem to be entirely true.
What occurs in the laboratory does
not necessarily happen at sea.
What we can say at present is that
marine micro-organisms are capable
of degrading some components of
oils, but that the rates of decomposi¬
tion in the natural situation are poorly
known," Dr. Goldberg states.
In a tragi-comic vein are his des¬
criptions of litter in the sea. On one
60-mile stretch of beach near Am-
chitka, Alaska, certainly no densely-
populated hive, 24,000 plastic items
have been counted.
A survey of 12.5 square kilometres
of the surface of the central North
Pacific in 1973 revealed six plastic
bottles, twenty-two plastic fragments,
twelve glass fishing floats, four glass
bottles, rope, an old balloon, finished
wood, a shoebrush, a rubber sandal,
a coffee can and three paper items.
Clearly, a warning system is need¬
ed. Dr. Goldberg has proposed a
one-year baseline-sampling program¬
me as a starting point. It would
mean collecting and analysing one
thousand samples from the atmos¬
phere, the ocean currents, marine
organisms, rivers and continental
shelf areas, rain, glaciers and deepsea
sediments.
Since this would be admittedly
costly, he suggests as a first step a
"mussel/barnacle watch" concentra¬
ting on species known to concentrate
pollutants. It would analyse 100
samples annually for petroleum hydro¬
carbons, artificial radionuclides, chlo¬
rinated hydrocarbons and heavy
metals"those substances that have
been shown to jeopardize life pro¬
cesses in the ocean."
Dr. Goldberg thinks that the entire
programme could be underwritten for
less than $ 300,000. If he is right,
one can only ask not when the
"mussel/barnacle watch" will begin
but why it was not started long ago.

THE International Decade of
Ocean Exploration is one of
many océanographie program¬
mes sponsored by Unesco. Its pur¬
pose is to gain a fuller understanding
of the world's oceans through scien¬
tific research projects. These pro¬
jects are in some cases largely
geological or physical, while in other
cases they seek to better understand
the biology of the sea, including
man's impact on fisheries.
One of the International Decade
projects is the Controlled Ecosystem
Pollution Experiment (CEPEX). This
project is largely financed by the
United States National Science
Foundation, and the principal coun¬
tries involved are U.S.A., U.K. and
Canada.

### 46517: Test tubes in the sea

The purpose of CEPEX is to study
the low level, long-term effects of
pollutants on the marine environ¬
ment. For some time it has been
possible for the chemists to show
that minute traces of potentially harm¬
ful substances such as copper, lead,
pesticides and hydrocarbons, have
been accumulating in the ocean.
What we don't know is whether very
small amounts of these substances
are harmful to marine life.
Firstly, it would be impossible to
test all the organisms in the sea in
order to determine if they reacted to
these low levels of pollutants; and
secondly, the long-term effects of
such slow accumulations of subs¬
tances may not be apparent until .
much later, perhaps by the year 2000,
when it might be too late to do any¬
thing about it.
In order to approach this very diffi¬
cult problem of understanding low
level, chronic effects of pollutants in
the sea, the CEPEX scientists decided
that they had to isolate large bodies
of water in which they could study
the whole biology of any particular
sea area. A similar approach is
These 30-metre-high plastic
tubes (above), submerged
containers each holding over
2,000 tons of sea water,
are floating laboratories in
which scientists are studying
the long-term biological
effects of pollutants.

these giant test tubes in
Saanich Inlet, a fjord on
Canada's Pacific Coast.

afloat can be seen.
used by terrestrial ecologists when
they fence off a piece of land to
study it in isolation from other effects.
However, the problem for the ocea-
nographer is that you can't just "fence
off" sea water; finding a container
for large amounts of sea water so
that the sea water inside will remain
a natural environment is a very diffi¬
cult problem. The solution was
found, however, in the form of a
familiar shape to most scientists
the test tube.
The only difference was that the
CEPEX test tubes had to be large
enough to support a whole life sys¬
tem from sunlight to fish; at the same
time the materials had to be strong
enough to withstand ocean waves,
clear enough to permit sunlight to
enter and, above all, made from
non-toxic material since it was the
scientists' aim to add small amounts
of toxic substances to these contai¬
ners in order to understand their
effect on the biology of the oceans.
The test tubes which were made
are capable of holding over 2000 tons
of sea water and they are designed to
float in the sea, thus minimizing struc¬
tural costs as well as replicating as
nearly as possible the natural ocean
environment.
The major site location for these
test tubes is at Saanich Inleta fjord
on the coast of British Columbia,
Canada. Similar structures are being
used by scientists in Loch Ewe, Scot¬
land and in Kieler Bucht, Fed. Rep. of
Germany. At present scientists are
using three of these large test tubes
and six smaller ones in their experi¬
ments.
The results which are being ob¬
tained through CEPEX are quite ex¬
tensive and space would not permit
coverage of this entire programme
here. However, one of the more far-
reaching discoveries concerns the
structure of food chains in the sea
and their possible alteration either by
man or by natural events. In this
respect it has been known for some
time that . the sea may sometimes
produce large numbers of different
kinds of jellyfish (ctenophores and
medusae) and that commercial fish
also fluctuate in their abundance.
A hypothesis now advanced as a
result of work in CEPEX is that there
may be some connexion between
these two events. By studying the
microscopic animals (the Zooplank¬
ton) which in turn feed both .the jelly¬
fish and the young commercial fish,
it has been found that two separate
pathways exist which may either
favour jellyfish production or commer¬
cial fish production.
Stated very simply, it is postulated
that the production of very small
plant cells (flagellates) may lead to
the production of small Zooplankton
and these favour the growth of jelly¬
fish; in contrast the production of
large plant cells (mostly diatoms)
leads to the production of large zoo-
plankton and these animals favour
the growth of young fish.
Obviously from the point of com¬
mercial fisheries it would be disas¬
trous if the commercial fisheries
declined and were replaced by jelly¬
fish ! The question is, what triggers
the food chain of flagellates to jelly¬
fish as opposed to the more useful
large diatom food chain?
The answer to this question seems
to lie in one of several effects.
Through experiments at CEPEX it can
be shown that small flagellate plant
cells are often produced as a result
of low level pollution, especially in
the presence of heavy metals or petro¬
leum hydrocarbons. However, the
food chain favouring flagellates and
jellyfish can also be set up in response
to storms which are natural events.
Thus the hypothesis, if found to be
correct, might explain why jellyfish
become abundant in some years and
not others, due to natural changes
in our weather, as well as suggesting
that the same events could be enhan¬
ced by man's pollution of the ocean
to the detriment of world fisheries.
The CEPEX programme is expected
to last for about ten years and to
eventually involve many more scien¬
tists from other countries.

### 46518: Expedition FAMOUS: pioneer exploration of a deepsea volcanic canyon where the earth's crust is born

pioneer exploration
of a deepsea
volcanic canyon
where the earth's
crust is born
AT ten minutes past noon on
2 August 1973, the French
bathyscaphe/4/-c/ï/Vnèa'e came
to rest on the slopes of a volcano,
two and a half kilometres below the
surface of the North Atlantic and
700 kilometres south-west of the
Azores. Powerful lamps picked out
a cascade of black lava, which had
solidified at the moment of eruption
but looked as if it had emerged only
an instant earlier from the depths of
the earth.
The lava had seeped through
countless cracks, forming buds, ten¬
drils and petrified rivulets. Further
investigation proved that the eruption
was indeed of recent date, at least
in geological terms. It had occurred
a mere few thousand years ago.
The volcano, which the explorers
named Mount Venus, is 250 metres
high, a kilometre wide and three or
four kilometres from end to end. It
stands in the middle of a high-walled
valley three kilometres wide, the bot¬
tom of which is 2,700 metres below
the surface of the ocean.
The dive by Archimède marked the
beginning of expedition FAMOUS, the
French-American Mid-Ocean Under¬
sea Survey, during which three sub¬
marines Afvin, from the Ameri¬
can Woods Hole Océanographie
Institution, together with Archimède

mer seasons exploring the valley,
travelling more than 90 kilometres at
a depth of more than 2,500 metres,
and less than five metres above the
bottom of the ocean bed.
The explorers spent altogether
228 hours in the valley, collecting
two tons of rock samples from 167
different sites, taking 23,000 photo¬
graphs and recording more than a
hundred hours of television films.
Their skilful navigation and accurate
survey made it possible to quickly
reconstruct the geology of this valley,
where the ocean bed is born.
It was immediately apparent that
this ocean landscape changed very
rapidly as it stretched away from the
centre of the valley towards its walls.
Along the fissured centre-line, where
the volcano had erupted, the crust
was freshly formed; the further the
rocks were from this line, the greater
their age.
How did the explorers know this,
as ' they peered out through the
portholes of their submarines?
Firstly, because of the snowlike
sediment in which the slopes of the
volcano were buried.
When plankton, the minute plant
and animal life which floats near the
surface of the ocean, dies, the chalky
remains sink slowly to the bottom,
where they pile up at a rate of 3 cm.
every thousand years, or 30 metres
every million years. Thus, after tens
of millions of years, the snow-like
layer of white sediment may well be
several kilometres deep.
What the explorers noticed, how¬
ever, was that Mount Venus itself
was barely dusted with this snow,
apart from a few drifts here and
there, while the lower parts of the
valley wall were buried under several
metres. In other words, the in¬
creasing depth of the sediment from
the centre of the valley to its edges
reflected the increasing age of the
underlying volcanic rocks.
Secondly, the submariners noticed
that the further they moved towards
the walls of the valley, the more
abundant were signs of animal life.
Dating of the rocks themselves
confirmed these initial observations.
The lava at the centre of the valley
was of recent origin; at the edges,
it was almost a hundred thousand
years old. It looked as though the
valley had been pushed outwards
from its centre during this period.
But how did this all happen ? To
understand the process, we must
return to Mount Venus, the origin of
the lava flow.
The volcano looks like a gigantic
black cauliflower, bursting out of its
skin. During formation, its surface
continually split and cracked, with
the oozing of buds of lava which, in
their turn, solidified almost imme¬
diately on contact with the surround¬
ing water.
This formation is typical of under¬
sea volcanoes. The crust of solidi¬
fied lava insulates the molten matter
underneath, which can only escape
by pushing upwards. Hence the
cauliflower-shape.
Northwards and southwards from
Mount Venus, the exploring subma¬
rines discovered whole areas of gap¬
ing fissures. What appears to have
occurred during the widening of the
valley is a stretching process, pulling
the crust outwards until it burst open
in a crazy pattern of cracks.
When the cracks deepened enough
to reach the molten matter under¬
neath, at a depth of two or three
kilometres, and when enough pres¬
sure had built up in the "magma
chamber", as it is called, lava was
squeezed up through the cracks, like
toothpaste out of a split tube. This
second process, known as extrusion,
covered all traces of everything

that had taken place before.,
The little valley which the expedi¬
tion examined in such detail forms
part of the floor of the Rift, the most
importantand for long the least-
knownfeature on the face of our
planet. But this is understandable
since it meanders along .most of its
60,000 kilometres at a depth of
2,500-3,000 metres beneath the
surface of the ocean at the centre of
the submarine mountain range known
as the Mid-Ocean Ridge..
The Rift is a split in the lithosphère,
the thin crust whichlike the rind of an
orangecovers the earth. Through¬
out the course of geological history,
basalt lava has leaked up almost
continuously through this split, re¬
newing the ocean bed on either side,
in the process known as "sea floor
spreading".
It was this process, which explains
why continents are drifting away from
each other on each side of the mid-
ocean ridge, that expedition FAMOUS
investigated.
Study of the Rift, and of the layers
of sediment under which the extru¬
sions of the volcano have been pro¬
gressively buried, provides the key to
the geography of the ocean bed
throughout its evolution, and to the
ancient structures and environments
in which each chapter of its history
was written.
How is this so? The immediate
answer to the question lies in the
discovery, after 20 years of explora¬
tion of the ocean depths, that the
oceanic crustunlike that which sup¬
ports the land masses of the earthis
short-lived. Oceans are born, live
out their lives and die in less than
200 million yearsa mere twenty-
fifth of the time which our planet has
taken to reach its present state.
Thus 200 million years ago, the In¬
dian and the Atlantic Oceans did not
exist, while a vast ocean covered the
space where the Alps and Himalayas
are today.
The birth of an ocean is the result
of the creative process studied by
FAMOUS at the bottom of the Rift.
In this process, the Rift valley
broadens under the pressure of lava
erupting from its central fissure,
pushing the older rocks out on each
side and permitting the ocean floor
to spread.
The oceanic Rift is a split between
two slab-like areas, or plates, in the
lithosphère, which are drifting apart.
By a process of injection, liquid basalt
rises from the depths of the earth to
fill the gap, the end result of which
was studied during expedition FA¬
MOUS. As it cools, this lava solidi¬
fies and forms the oceanic crustfive
or six kilometres thickon each side
of the split. The oceanic lithosphère
is thus the product of accretion, which
takes place symmetrically along the
edges of the Rift.
As it grows, the oceanic crust
evolves. Close to the Rift, where
the lithosphère is new, its average
temperature is very high. Conse¬
quently, its average density is rela¬
tively low and the water depth is
relatively shallow (2,500-3,000 m.).
With age the lithosphère grows
cooler and contracts, with the
result that the ocean depth in¬
creases. In other words, the older
the ocean is, the deeper it is. On
either side of the Rift, the ocean
grows steadily deeper until it reaches
the continental mass. Thus the
youngest part of the earth's crust (a
few dozen million years) is shaped
like a flattened isosceles triangle
whose summitwhere the Rift is
situatedis 2 1/2 or 3 kilometres
below the ocean surface, and whose
base is several hundred kilometres
wide.
This Mid-Ocean Ridge is too young,
and too far from the continents, as
FAMOUS discovered, to have recei¬
ved more than a dusting of the
"snow" of sediment.
When the lithosphère is more than
70 million years old, it is almost as
cool as it will ever be, and the ocean,
already more than 5,500 metres
deep, is slow to grow any deeper.
This is the ocean basin, the ocean's
second main feature after the Mid-
Ocean Ridge.
Here the water, being deeper, is
colder and under greater pressure.
It is also capable of absorbing more
calcium carbonate and silicaand
indeed does so, by dissolving any
planktonic remains that settle from
the surface to a depth of more than
4,500 metres.
Consequently, the "abyssal hills",
which are all that remain of the volca¬
noes of long ago, are not covered
with a chalky layer of "snow", but
with a fine insoluble "red clay", com-i
posed of particles carried by winds)

>and currents from the distant land.
This red clay usually' accumulates
very slowly, no more than a millimetre
every thousand years. If, however,
the basin is closer to a continent, and
not separated from it by a deep
trench, the process takes place more
rapidly.
Much sediment also enters the
ocean from the continental margins
in muddy avalanches known as turbi¬
dity currents, which bury the original
relief, thereby creating what oceano¬
graphers call abyssal plains.
If it is relatively easy now to
reconstruct the shape and structure
of an ocean during its long progress
from birth in the Rift to the state in
which we see it today, it is much
more difficult to identify the different
environments in which this develop¬
ment took place. Any indications
which we can obtain in this connexion
must come for the most part from the
sediment covering the ocean floor.
This is one of the major objectives
of the Deep Sea Drilling Project
(DSDP), launched by the United
States in 1968 and now involving
scientists from six countries: the
Federal Republic of Germany, France,
Japan, the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A. and
the United Kingdom.
Rock samples have been taken
from boreholes drilled by the re¬
search vessel Glomar Challenger at
more than 400 points in the earth's
crust, from the Antarctic to the
Arctic regions. Anchored at points
where the ocean is 5,500 metres
deep, it can drill more than 1.500
metres into the ocean bed. As a
result, we now know much about
the composition of the sea bed at
depths of up to seven kilometres
beneath the surface of the ocean.
It is impossible here to summarize
the results obtained from this great
international scientific venture, whose
scope and scale are increasing
rapidly. But its importance for the
reconstruction of the globeand its
climateat different stages in their
evolution is obvious.
We need only recall the words of
the pioneer of modern oceanography.
Professor Maurice Ewing, who obser¬
ved that if the land mass of the earth
can be compared with a picture
whose outlines are constantly being
blurred by time and the weather, the
ocean floor is like a wall that has
been covered with successive layers
of paint. There is information there,
but to reach it requires a scraperor a
drill. And Glomar Challenger has
the tools to do the job.
As an example, let us see what it
has taught us about the floor of the
Atlantic between North America and
Africa.
Here, the ocean has been growing
wider for 180 million years, at a rate
of about three centimetres each year,
and getting deeper during the pro¬
cess. Close to its surface, and even
more so in its depths, the circulation
of its water has been changing, too.
At the beginning of its history, this
ocean was in fact an enormous lake,
stretching away on either side of the
Equator and protected by dry land
from the cold water of the Poles.
Its situation was much like that of
the present-day Red Sea. It grew
wider and deeper very slowly. It
is probable thatat least in the
northernmost part of the oceanthe
initial sediments were composed of
salts, which settled down in a narrow,
relatively shallow basin, and were
subjected to a climate that was hot
and dry.
Deposition of carbonates followed
in an environment rich in oxygen and
in water certainly less than 2,000 me¬
tres deep. The water gradually deep¬
ened as the crust subsided, until
1 40 million years agoit was 3,000
metres deep or more. The waters
at the bottom remained motionless
and stagnant for long periods, as is
the case in the Black Sea today.
The sediments consequently were
rich in organic matter. Also the
presence of red clay for the first time
demonstrates the existence of a deep
ocean.
Between 110 million and 80 mil¬
lion years ago, a major epoch of
volcanic eruptions occurred, doubt¬
less related to the process which was
to separate Europe from North Am¬
erica. The sea flooded thecontinents,
trapping their erosion products on the
shallow continental plateaus.
THE separation of Europe from
North America began 80 mil¬
lion years ago. The sepa¬
ration of Greenland from Europe
occurred 60 million years ago and
led to the creation of the Norwegian
Sea, at which time water in the ocean
depths began to circulate vigorously.
With cold water pouring in from the
polar regions to the north, a system of
circulation similar to that of today's
Atlantic was established. This was
a period of erosion, rather than sedi¬
mentation.
Forty-five million years ago, thé
level of the ocean having fallen
considerably, the eroded sediments
of the continents were being trans
ported over the edge of the conti¬
nental shelf and into the depths.
This sedimentation went on increas¬
ing until 15 million years ago, al¬
though it was interrupted by epi¬
sodes of deep-water erosion about
30 million years ago when the
Antarctic regions began to freeze.
Then, in the northern hemisphere,
three million years ago, the Ice Age
began. This led to the accumula¬
tion of vast quantities of sediments
on the deep ocean floor, producing
abyssal plains. The sediments are
the result of erosion caused by the
retreat of the ocean and the lowering
of sea level during the periods when
the ice-caps thickened and advanced.
Since the last phase of the Ice Age,
11,000 years ago, this kind of ero¬
sion has sharply decreased, the sea
level having risen more than 100
metres.
From FAMOUS to DSDP, the ex¬
ploration of the ocean depths in all
dimensions has produced a coherent
picture in whichfor the first time
we can see how the globe and its
environment have changed during
the last 200 million years.
This critical period has seen the
progressive occupation of the conti¬
nents by living creatures, and the
appearancejust as the Ice Age was
beginning in the northern hemi¬
sphere Man's ancestors.
It seems certain that all the im¬
portant changes of climateabout
which so little is as yet known with
certaintyhave played a vital role
in the process of human settlement.
It is only by studying the ocean
that we can hope to understand the
whole story. But the ocean is a
very complicated place; its explora¬
tion has only just begun, and no
one would dare to guess what dis¬
coveries the future will bring.

Letters to the editor
DESTINATION UNESCO :
A COMIC STRIP VOYAGE
OF DISCOVERY
Sir,
My congratulations on your August-
September 1976 issue, "Destination
Unesco". I appreciate very highly
the imagination and the courage you
have shown in adopting a new tech¬
nique to focus attention on the major
achievements of Unesco during the
last three decades. This issue can be
read and understood by people of all
ages and all levels of education. My
teenage daughter took it to school
and found it difficult to circulate it to
her friends without antagonizing any
one of them, because of the demand.
At a Seminar on Teaching about the
United Nations held in 1958 with
financial assistance from Unesco, I
proposed that occasionally UNOPI,
Unesco, WHO, etc., publish their
achievements in the form of the"
"comics" which were then, and still
are, the rage among children and even
among some adults.
But a very sophisticated audience
laughed me out of court and the
proposal was rejected. It is nice
now after a lapse of 1 8 years to find
someone of your ability deciding on
your own to resort to this kind of pu¬
blication to highlight Unesco's achie¬
vements.
L. H. Horace Perera

Organizations of the
Teaching Profession

Sir,
I was disappointed and irritated by
the issue. I can't see why you
should have tried to imitate comic
stripswith all their mediocrity, ba¬
nality and ugliness. What a far cry
from the beauties of Abu Simbel !
This is the first issue I shall not
read. And why should the hero be a
boy? Males are only one half of hu¬
manity.
Perhaps the explanation for my
distaste lies in my age: I am 64 years
old. And yet I am still fully active.
Andrée Looten Aroz
Golfe Juan, France
Sir,
I have subscribed to the "Courier"
for over 20 years. For practical rea¬
sons I always prefer the Spanish edi¬
tion since I teach Spanish at evening
classes run by the L.B.C. Institute in
Antwerp. My pupils found "Desti¬
nation Unesco" so interesting and
instructive that I am sure that it will
get an enthusiastic reception from
young people everywhere.
Raymond Duys

Sir,
I thought the issue was so con¬
structive, so easy to understand and
so interesting that I should like to
order a dozen more copies.
Gilbert Blondeau

Sir,
I just read your wonderful August-
September issue, and I must sub¬
scribe. Please send me the Courier
on subscriptionbeginning with the
August-September issue I must have
it for my children.
J. Eric Diehl
Boras, Sweden
Sir,
To my mind such ugly and stupid
comic strips are unworthy of a pu¬
blication like the "Courier". I hope
you will not produce any more issues
of this kind, which can do nothing but
harm to readers' taste and ideas.
J.Taillard
Paris
France
Sir,
In my opinion it is badly drawn, in
poor colour, and worst of all the
"bubble" technique makes it very dif¬
ficult to read. If one had no previous
knowledge of Unesco's work it would
be difficult to find enlightenment in
this issue.
I do hope you have no plans to
repeat this, in my view, disastrous
experiment. If I wish to read comic
strips I should buy an appropriate
journal.
Miss A. Kenyon
Accrington, England
Sir,
This is exactly what is needed to
introduce Unesco to school children
and I hope that major efforts are
being made through National Commis¬
sions to utilize the issue for this pur¬
pose. It is also clear that cartoon
film strips of various types would be
most valuable.

STARS AND STRIPES
FOR EVER
Sir,
May I add to the "hot contest"
about the design of the American
flag mentioned on page 3 of your
July 1976 issue.
I took part in a U.N. Seminar on
New Towns in Britain a couple of
summers ago. The U.N. kept us
hard at work in the historic precinct
around Westminster, but Her Ma¬
jesty's Government was generous in
flying us to new towns all over En¬
gland and Scotland.
Among them was the "new town"
of Washington CD. (County Durham)
where the first Wessington who came
over with William the Conqueror laid
out his demesne and where George
Washington's ancestors lived for hun¬
dreds of years. Indeed the "Great
Hall" of the family is being incorpo¬
rated in the new town.
At a luncheon for which they were
the hosts, the members of the
Washington New Town Corporation
were all wearing an old school tie,
which, they explained, was the tie ol
the Washington Corporation. Its em
blem was the seal of the George
Washington family's coat of arms
which revealed stars and stripes. So
this is where Betsy Ross got the idea
for the flag that she sewed in Balti¬
more.

UNESCO BRAILLE REVIEW
Sir,
As a blind teacher of French lan¬
guage and literature at a high school
in Nancy (France), I was extremely
interested to learn that Unesco had
launched a magazine in braille. I
thoroughly enjoyed the articles in the
first issue, all taken from the
"Unesco Courier", and I am sure that
they were widely appreciated.
The "Unesco Braille Review" offers
the blind an additional way of making
contact with the world, and it will
undoubtedly enable some blind per¬
sons to emerge from the isolation in
which they live. We in France can
consider ourselves privileged in com¬
parison with the blind of some coun¬
tries, for whom social and cultural
possibilities are extremely limited.
For them, even more than for us, the
"Unesco Braille Review" will bring a
note of hope.
Unesco is particularly well placed
to remind men of their obligations of
brotherhood and also of justice, since
all persons have a right to informa¬
tion and culture, whatever their phy¬
sical differences and inequalities.
C. Poncin
Nancy, France
Editor's note. The first issue of the
"Unesco Braille Review" was pub¬
lished in April 1976 and met with an
enthusiastic response. Unesco will
publish an increased number of copies
of the two issues planned for 1977
so as to meet all the requests received
from over 120 countries. English,
French and Spanish versions of the
magazine will be distributed free of
charge. Requests for copies should
be sent to Mr. F. Potter, Unesco Visi¬
tors' Information Centre, 7 Place de
Fontenoy, 75700 Paris, France.
CELTIC MEDICINE
AND THE DRUIDS
Sir,
Bravo for your presentation of the
broad sweep of Celtic civilization
(December 1975 issue). The sub¬
ject is not sufficiently well known
and school textbooks only devote a
few pages to it.
Even so, your study would have
been more complete had it given us
just a brief account of the druids,
explaining the nature of their learn¬
ing and their functions in these an¬
cient communities.
The Celts possessed a knowledge
of medicine that was advanced for
their time, and here again a resume
of their medical practices would
have been welcome.

Gl M
19th session of Unesco's
general conference
THE 19th session of Unesco's Gen¬
eral Conferencethe first Unesco
General Conference for 20 years
to be held away from the Organization's
Paris headquarterstook place in Nairobi
(Kenya) between 26 October and 30
November 1976.
. Conducted from beginning to end in
an atmosphere of co-operation and conci¬
liation, inspired by what has been called
"the spirit of Nairobi", the Conference
culminated in a series of important deci¬
sions on the future tasks of Unesco.
By approving the programme propos¬
ed by Unesco's Director-General, adop¬
ting the declaration on the role of Unesco
in the field of science and technology
and recognizing the phenomenon of the
"communication explosion", the General
Conference indicated the priorities for
the future.
For the first time, a six-year plan was
discussed at length and approved, thus
giving a medium term orientation which
will further the effectiveness of Unesco's
work in education, science, the social
sciences, culture and communication.
The contribution of Unesco to the esta¬
blishment of a new international econo¬
mic order, with all its social and cultural
components, was defined as well as
Unesco's role in the Second Development
Decade.
Thanks to a drafting and negotiation
group, a consensus was reached on a
certain number of controversial prob¬
lems.' There was unanimity for
example on the necessity to work for a
more balanced exchange of information,
and on the priority to be given to the
least developed countries. The draft
declaration on the use of the mass media
in strengthening peace, and international
understanding and in combatting war
propaganda, racism and apartheid was
referred to the 20th session.
On the practical side, all the States
which did not yet belong to a given region
were included in regional activities.
Israel, whose entry into the European
region was accepted by a majority of the
States concerned, was censured for its
archaeological excavations in Jerusalem
by reference to a resolution of the pre¬
ceding General Conference and for its
delay in replying to the demand that a
mission be sent to the occupied territo¬
ries. But on the whole, the desire for
conciliation was obvious in these debates.
The new budget ($224,41 3,000 for
the biennium 1977-Í978) was voted
without a single dissenting voice and
with only 12 abstentions, while Unesco's
working capital fund was doubled, from
$8,000,000 to $ 1 6,800,000.
The General Conference approved a
restructuration of the Unesco Secretariat,
including the creation of a new Social
Sciences Sector, in order to meet the
need to apply specialized knowledge
to development as a whole. Problems
such as national policies with respect to
population, youth and its participation
in the life of the nation, and human
rights and the study of the causes of
human rights violations will come under
this new Sector.
The General Conference also approved
the decisions of the first meeting of more
than 100 ministers of physical education
and sports in creating an intergovern¬
mental committee to prepare the sta¬
tutes of a permanent commission. The
United States issued an invitation to
Unesco to hold in the U.S.A. a confer¬
ence on sport and physical education.
Life-long education, mass education,
the elimination of all opposition between
formal and informal education and the
need to encourage adult education were
overwhelmingly approved by the Unesco
Member States.
Much of the discussion centred on
the decentralization of efforts to develop
education, and participants insisted that
priority be given to educational planning,
teacher training, to the production of
inexpensive teaching materials and to
the use of national languages. The role
of education as an instrument for the pro¬
tection of cultural identity was stressed.
The General Conference expressed
its solidarity with the action of the Greek
government in launching a world cam¬
paign for the preservation of the Acro¬
polis. It also authorized the Director
General to undertake five new interna¬
tional campaigns for the preservation of
the cultural heritage: the Medina of Fez
(Morocco), Herat (Afghanistan), Sukhathai
(the ancient capital of Thailand), the
cultural heritage of Ethiopia, Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda, and finally the
restoration of the architectural heritage
of Guatemala damaged by earth¬
quakes in 1976.
The vast programme of regional
studies of cultures' begun in recent
years will be continued and will concern
particularly traditional and contemporary
Asian cultures, Arabic culture, African
cultures, contemporary Latin American
cultures, European cultures and cross-
cultural studies.
Unesco will continue to carry out a
large programme of book development
and the promotion of reading, focussed
on the production and distribution of
works especially in the developing coun¬
tries.
The General Conference recommended
the employment of more women in
Unesco's Secretariat.
Perfect co-ordination between the
work of the Conference in Nairobi and the
Unesco Secretariat in Paris was facilitat¬
ed considerably by the French-German
"Symphonie" system of experimental
telecommunications, using two satellites
in stationary orbit.
. The next session of the Unesco Gene¬
ral Conference will be held at Unesco
Headquarters in Paris in the autumn of
1978.
International science
prizes
Two international science prizes were
presented by Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Unesco's Director-General, at
Unesco H.Q. in Paris on 9 December,
1976. The Unesco Science Prize for
achievements of special value to the
developing countries was awarded to the
distinguished French engineer Alfred.
Champagnat for his research into the
manufacture of protein from petroleum
products. The 1976 Kalinga Prize for
the Popularization of Science was awar¬
ded jointly to twp noted Latin American
scientists, the Brazilian biologist Prof.
José Reis and the Mexican physicist Prof.
Luis Estrada Martinez, both of whom
have written numerous popular scientific
works and launched science clubs for
young people and the general public.
Travelling exhibition
on Borobudur
The Belgian Ministry of Culture in
co-operation with the Indonesian govern¬
ment has organized an important exhibi¬
tion on the great 8th century A.D. Bud¬
dhist sanctuary of Borobudur (Indonesia)
and the art of central Java. To accom¬
pany the exhibition Unesco is preparing
a display of photos and diagrams to
explain the stone-by-stone reconstruction
of the sanctuary being carried out under
its ' International Campaign for the
Safeguard of Borobudur. The exhibition,
which opens in -Brussels in January
1 977, will later tour European cities.
Unesco's Executive Board
elects new chairman
Mr. Leonard C.J. Martin (U.K.) was
elected chairman of Unesco's Executive
Board when it met in Nairobi on 1 Dec¬
ember 1976. Mr. Martin has long been
associated with Unesco, as Secretary of
the U.K. National Commission for Unesco
(1962-1965) and as the U.K.'s perma¬
nent delegate to Unesco (1965-1968).
Language teaching
in multilingual societies
Unesco's educational quarterly Pros¬
pects examines the problem of mother-
tongue schooling in a multilingual envi¬
ronment in a special 8-article "dossier"
published in its No. 3, 1976 issue. Top¬
ics discussed by specialists from India,
the U.S.S.R., France, Nigeria, Sri Lanka,
Peru, Yugoslavia and Canada include
"Language, education and development
planning", "The problem of the choice of
languages in Africa", "Sri Lanka: science
teaching in the national languages" and
"The Soviet experience with languages".
Unesco world survey on
unemployment and youth,
Unesco is carrying out a world survey
of problems concerning young people
who are out of work, including those
with little or no schooling or vocational
training. Covering the 14-25 age group,
the survey is being made in collabora¬
tion with the International Labour Office.

SUBMERSIBLE MADE FOR TWO
This two-man pocket submarine is used as a jeep by engineers
inspecting underwater pipelines off the coast of Louisiana (USA).
Mass-produced; and small and light enough to be transported by air
(4 metres long and weighing 1,500 kilos) the midget craft is powered
by 3 electric motors and can cruise for 5 hours. Today versatile
submersibles serve the marine sciences and industry in many parts
of the globe (see photos pages 16 24, 28)
