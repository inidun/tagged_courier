OUR DWINDLING $Êmm
ENERGY RESOURCES
Today's oil crisis has highlighted the much broader problem
of the world's critical energy shortagenow & in the future
by
Harry Lustig
HARRY LUSTIG, a native of Vienna, is
Professor of Physics and Dean of the Col¬
lege of Liberal Arts and Science of the
City College of the City University of New
York. From 1970 to 1972 he was a member
of Unesco's Science Sector. He was
Unesco's consultant for the 1973 International
Congress, "The Sun in the Service of
Mankind" and contributed a major report,
"Solar Energy: The State of the Art", for
Unesco's working party on solar energy, in
lune 1973. His article is a condensed version
of a chapter from this study.
Recent world events have focussed attention on the grave energy
crisis facing the world. With total energy demand growing at a rate
of about five per cent a year and with conventional energy resources
rapidly dwindling, the problem is urgent with serious implications
not only for the developed but also for the developing countries.
World population is expected to have doubled by the year 2000 and
merely to maintain this population, with no attempt to raise living
standards, will require over three times the current rate of energy pro¬
duction. Power is the key to expanding food and industrial production
and to many other vital problems of world development. For this
reason world energy needs have for many years been a matter of
great concern to the United Nationsand Unesco. The following article
presents a global energy "balance sheet" from which it becomes
clear that our present problems and future requirements call for the
speediest possible development of power sources other than fossil
fuels. One such power source, solar energy, was the subject of a
crucial international conference held last summer at Unesco's Paris
headquarters. Other articles in this issue take a look at the possi¬
bilities and realities of solar energy over the next decades.

### 50113: Our dwindling energy resources: today's oil crisis has highlighted the much broader problem of the world's critical energy shortage, now and in the future

O what extent is the world
energy crisis upon us now and how
much time do we have before it will
reach disastrous proportions? What is
the lead time necessary for producing
needed technological innovations and
economic and social rearrangements?
How reliable are the estimates of
fossil fuel reserves? How long will
the world's stocks of natural nuclear
fuel last and how good are the pros¬
pects for controlled fusion? What is
the relative availability, exploitability
and cost (economic and environmental)
of the "natural" substitutes: solar,
wind, geothermal and tidal energy?
Is it realistic to expect people in
the industrialized countries to change
their way of life, so as to use less
energy in the future? And is it sensible
and moral to ask the developing
countries to give up their quest to
narrow the energy gap and to begin
to approach the standard of living now
enjoyed by the developed countries?
It is generally recognized that the
future of solar energy will in large
measure be determined by the answers
given to these questions. This is
because in order to utilize solar energy
on either a large or a small scale, no
fundamental scientific breakthroughs
are needed (unlike in the case of
nuclear fusion), but what is needed
are technological advances and invest¬
ment policies to bring down the cost.
The factors which will determine
whether and when sunlight becomes
a major source for satisfying man's
energy needs are thus largely eco¬
nomic, political, sociological.
Between now and the year 2000,
the United States will consume more
energy than it has in its entire history:
in that year the annual U.S. demand
for energy is expected to be double
what it is now.
Today the United States, with
6 per cent of the world's population,
uses 35 per cent of the world's energy.
Its per capita increase in energy con¬
sumption is now about 1 per cent per
year, while, starting from a much lower
base, the world's average is increasing
at a rate of 1.3 per cent.
Because of the much faster popu¬
lation growth in some parts of the
world, just to keep pace with that
growth (and the 1.3 per cent per capita
increase) the world-wide energy supply
will have to triple, rather than double

ENERGY RESOURCES (Continued)
by the year 2000. With these trends,
by 2000 A.D. the gap between the U.S.
and the developing countries will still
be large and it could take 300 years
to close that gap.
The problem in many developing
areas is not only the very low and
nearly static per capita energy con¬
sumption (the population growth
largely negating the increased total
production of energy) but also the
"non-commercial" sources (mostly
firewood) from which much of the
energy is derived.
The use of wood as a fuel and the
ensuing deforestation has already had
the most deleterious consequences in
India and in large areas of Africa. It
is clear that there is little possibility
of Increasing the consumption of these
non-commercial fuels in many parts
of the world. The projected increases
in energy consumption would (in the
absence of new sources, such as solar
energy) therefore have to come dis¬
proportionately from the commercial
sector.
The world's consumption of energy
for Industrial purposes is already
doubling each decade. If the rate of
industrialization were to change fast
enough to permit the developing
countries to reach by the year 2000
the U.S. standard of living, the world¬
wide level of energy consumption
would be roughly 100 times the present
figure.
Our accumulated stocks of fossil
fuels were almost entirely laid down

during the Cambrian period, which
began about 600 million years ago.
The process is still continuing, but
probably at about the same rate as
in the past. Thus the natural accumu¬
lation during any part of the future
that is of interest will be entirely
insignificant; when we have used up
what there is now, there will be no
more.
The U.S. scientist, M. King Hubbert
predicts that the world's resources of
oil will be exhausted by 2100 and those
of coal by 2500. It does not appear,
however, that King Hubbert has taken
into account any limitations other than
those of discovery and extraction
such as a political decision by one
country not to export its resources to
another, or environmental restrictions
on the use of a fuel.
Nor is there, on the other hand,
any allowance made for an uncharac¬
teristic flowering of collective human
wisdom: should the peoples of the
world decide, for Instance, that oil and
coal should be preserved and used
for petrochemicals rather than burned
for fuel, the supplies could last very
much longer.
The peak in world oil production
will be passed sometime between
1985 and 2000. By the year 2000,
when the annual world-wide rate of
energy consumption will be only three
times the present rate, half or more
of the total world reserve of oil will
have been consumed. It is all but
certain that gas and oil will cease
being a major energy source for

### 50113: Our dwindling energy resources: today's oil crisis has highlighted the much broader problem of the world's critical energy shortage, now and in the future

humanity well before the middle of
the 21st century.
The situation for coal Is considerably
better both with respect to the re¬
liability of the estimates of reserves
and the amount of these reserves.
However, If the present rise In the
rate of coal production Is not checked
In the near future, the peaking will
occur before 2050 and the supply will
be exhausted before 2100.
It should also be noted that coal
mining has a particularly ugly effect on
the environment and that the burning
of coal produces serious pollution by
the emission of sulphur and other
products. Nevertheless, in the absence
of non-fossil substitutes, coal will
have to become the major source of
energy for the Indefinite future, and
even with the most optimistic estimates
as to the development of nuclear and
solar energy, coal will be a substantial
contributor to a growing energy con¬
sumption for at least the next 50 years.
Although the discussion of atomic
energy is usually carried on in terms
of the two alternatives, fission and
fusion, a prediction of what the future
holds in store really requires a sub¬
division of each of these methods Into
two categories.
If fission Is likely to be the only
available process as appears likely
for some time to come the prospects
for major and long time energy pro¬
duction from this source will depend
very much on whether reliance will
continue to have to be placed on the
presently developed reactors, which
use uranium 235, or whether breeder
reactors, which start with uranium 238
or thorium 232 as a fuel will be put
Into production.

opment (OECD) Nuclear Energy

fuels. But even if we include the
low grade ores as a source of supply,
it is clear that the era of U 235 nuclear
fission will be a short one probably
terminating before the end of the
century.
The situation will change drastically
if and when the breeder reactor comes
into use on an industrial scale. With
breeding, a large part of the supply
of natural uranium as well as of
thorium would thus become available

as fuel for fission reactors. This means
not only that low grade ores could then
be economically used, but that the
energy output from each ton of ore
would be very much greater. Under
these conditions the existing uranium
reserves could supply the world's
energy needs for perhaps a thousand
years to come.
There is every reason to expect
that breeder reactors will be oper¬
ational within perhaps 20 years. But
that development will not completely
solve the energy crisis and will, In
fact, bring new problems in Its wake.
For one thing, nuclear energy shares,
with solar energy, the characteristic
that it Is capital Intensive; the capital
cost, per kilowatt of generating
capacity, of a nuclear electric power
plant is about twice that of a fossil
fuel plant.
More Important, the environmental
consequences of large scale nuclear
power production are serious. Here
it Is not primarily a problem of air
pollution by effluent particles, .as in
the case of the burning of fossil fuels,
but of the safe disposal of the radio¬
active fission products, the (small)
risk of (highly disastrous) accidents
in the operation of reactors and the
thermal pollution caused by the
massive cooling of the nuclear power
plants.
Control of the thermonuclear fusion
process the process of the hydrogen
bomb so that it may be exploited as
a source of useful energy involves a
number of scientific phenomena that
are not yet completely understood and
of engineering advances that have
hardly been seriously studied. The
fusion process thus remains a possi¬
bility with a highly uncertain outcome.
It may therefore be premature to
be concerned about the reserves of
"raw material" required for the fusion
process, but It is useful, nevertheless,
since the successful realization of
fusion, by way of the deuterium-tri¬
tium reaction might see us through
about halfway Into the 21st century,
but no longer than that.
The picture would be changed
dramatically if fusion could be accom¬
plished with the deuterium-deuterium
reaction. One cubic metre of water
contains enough atoms of deuterium
to provide a potential fusion energy
equivalent to the heat of combustion
of 300 tons of coal or 1,500 barrels
of crude oil.
The total volume of the oceans is
about 1,500 million cubic kilometres.
If enough deuterium were withdrawn
to reduce the initial concentration by
1 per cent, the energy made available
by its fusion would amount to about
500,000 times the energy content of
tho world's supply of fossil fuels.
Many other disasters will befall the
world before that supply would be
exhausted.
There are three sources of conti¬
nuously incoming energy: intercept¬
ed solar radiation; geothermal
energy, which is conveyed to the sur¬
face of the earth from the interior by
the conduction of heat and by con¬
vection in hot springs and volcanoes;
and tidal energy derived from the
kinetic and gravitational potential
energy of the earth-moon-sun system.
It ¡s a reasonably simple matter to
estimate the approximate rate of Input
from each source, but the more diffi¬
cult and important task Is to determine
how much of this can be tapped as
useful heat or converted into work
in the light of the prevailing technology,
economic factors and environmental
constraints.
The earth intercepts more than
1,500 quadrillion (1,500 followed by
15 zeroes) kilowatt hours of power
each year, but not all of it reaches the
earth's surface. About 30 per cent of
the solar energy is immediately reflec¬
ted back into space, another 47 per
cent is absorbed by the atmosphere,
the land surface and the oceans and
converted into heat, and another 23 per
cent Is involved in the evaporation,
convection, precipitation and surface
runoff of water in the hydrological
cycle. A small fraction, about 0.2 per
cent, drives the atmospheric and
oceanic convections and circulations
Many countries now carry out
research on harnessing atomic
energy for peaceful tasks. India,
a pioneer in this field, decided
as early as 1954 to set up the
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
at Trombay, near Bombay (right).
Above, the "heart" of France's
"Rapsodie" reactor, in operation

and the ocean waves. Finally, an even
smaller fraction, about 0.02 per cent
is captured by the chlorophyll of green
plants and becomes, by photosynthe¬
sis, the essential source of energy for
the growth of all living matter (as well
as, in a minute fraction, the source
of fossil fuels).
Tidal energy represents a potential
source of power which, assuming it
could be exploited continuously, could
produce 567,000 million kilowatt hours
of energy per year. This is less than
1 per cent of the world's energy con¬
sumption in 1970.
The presently existing or seriously
researched ways of obtaining geo¬
thermal power all involve the extrac¬
tion of heat from volcanoes or from
the hot water filling the sands of deep
sedimentary basins. A geothermal
power operation has been under way
in the Larderello area of Italy since
1904 and now has a capacity of 370
megawatts. The three other main areas
of production are the geysers in north¬
ern California, Wairakei in New Zea¬
land, and Iceland.
It has been estimated that the stored
thermal energy in the world's major
geothermal areas would, if exploited,
provide energy equal to the amount
consumed In the U.S. in the year 1970.
Furthermore, this energy Is depletable;
if it were withdrawn over the next
50 years, the contribution to the
world's annual power consumption,
even during that limited time, would
be less than that from tidal power.
We see therefore that the total
power influx into the earth's surface
environment is almost entirely (99.98
per cent) due to solar radiation; the
sun's contribution to the earth's energy
income is 5,000 times more than
that of the other sources combin¬
ed. This does not by itself necessa¬
rily mean that solar energy is there¬
fore the only or even the major
candidate for becoming a source of
renewable energy but this conclusion
does, in fact, appear to be correct.
It should be noted that all the solar
components can, in principle, be tapped
for power. The classic approach is to
intercept a tiny fraction of the 47 per
cent which would otherwise go to
heat the land and water surface and
the atmosphere, and to use it either
directly as heat or to convert Into
mechanical or electrical energy.
With a collection and conversion
efficiency of 10 per cent, something
like 2 per cent of the land area of the
U.S. would suffice to meet that
country's total energy needs in the
year 2000.
The potential water power of the
world has been estimated at around
3,000 million kilowatts, about one third
of the present world rate of energy
consumption. However, only 8.5 per
cent of this water power is developed
(mainly by conventional hydroelectric
systems) and the three regions with
the greatest potential Africa, South

ENERGY RESOURCES (Continued)
America and south-east Asia are the
least advanced industrially.
Wind power is the sun's contribution
by way of the atmospheric and oceanic
convection mode. While windmills
could be resurrected as a source of
small power in certain locations, wind
energy cannot be relied upon on a
large or global scale. On the other
hand, it may become feasible to
exploit thermal depth and streamflow
gradients In the oceans, especially in
multipurpose operations involving also
mariculture and fresh water production.
Turning to the last terrestrial solar
energy absorption mechanism, recom¬
mendations have recently been made
in several countries for increasing the
solar energy harnessed through photo¬
synthesis, by growing suitable trees
and plants in special solar plantations
and recovering the energy either
through burning or the creation of syn¬
thetic fuels.
Finally there is a proposal for satel¬
lite collection of solar radiation and
recovering the energy on a large scale
outside the earth's atmosphere.
It is not yet clear which of the
many schemes proposed for the
harnessing of solar energy will prove to
be the most efficient or how soon solar
energy will be exploited on a large
scale. But it is clear that among all
the renewable sources of energy, the
sun is the only serious contender for
massive and long-term exploitation and
that it is, in fact, the only real altern
ative or supplement to breeder reactors
or fusion for dealing with the energy
crisis.
In recent years the partisans of solar
energy have shown a commendable
realism in recognizing that the sun
will not become a major direct source
of power until the cost of its collec¬
tion and conversion becomes at least
comparable to that of conventional
fuels.
Solar energy, when used directly as
heat, in such applications as water and
house heating and water distillation Is,
in some regions of the world, already
competitive with fuel and electricity.
There is little doubt that further

technological developments and mass
production will lower the cost of solar
energy utilization and even less doubt
that there will be a sharp rise in the
price of conventional fuels.
But it would be foolhardy to sit back
and rely on this negative phenomenon
because the cross-over point might
then be reached at a time and at a
price which would have disastrous
consequences for the world's standard
of living.
Humanity is willing to pay quite
exorbitant prices for energy in special
circumstances and for special uses,
or when the sources employed have
special characteristics.
Much high-priced energy is used in
small quantities and for luxury uses
such as electric watches or the space
programme. However, the problem
becomes serious when applied to
underdeveloped or underpopulated
areas of the world. There are places
where there is at present no fossil
fuel or nuclear energy available and
where solar energy may be the best
or the only hope for relief from suffer¬
ing or a dreadfully low standard of
living.
In the drought-stricken zone of west
central Africa, for example, where
millions of cattle have died and humans
are starving to death for lack of water
lying underground, fuel and mainten¬
ance-free solar pumps might just pos¬
sibly be more effective and practical
than diesel powered ones, for which
the fuel has to be transported over
miles of desert, and which may be¬
come useless at the first breakdown.
The energy supply crisis discount¬
ing political and ecological considera¬
tions and a concern for improving the
lot of the poor nations and people is
a crisis of the future, a crisis of anti¬
cipated growth.
The reason for the sense of crisis
is, of course, that the world's consump¬
tion of energy is not constant, or even
increasing linearly, but that it is rising
exponentially.
It is clear that our present growth
rates in energy production, in raw
materials consumption, in population
and in pollution cannot be sustained.
This is a point which scientists and
other throughtful men have appreciated
for some time and which they are
trying to get the world and its leaders
to understand and to act upon.
In spite of the fact that the present
Impetus for solar energy development
in the industrialized countries appears
to be fed by concern with the exhaus¬
tion of the supply of other fuels, a halt
to the increase in the consumption of
energy will have to occur for other

compelling reasons, long before some
of these supplies are exhausted.
Much will, of course, depend on
when the equilibrium state is reached
and at what level of consumption. If It
occurs soon, before levels of con¬
sumption rise much more and before
coal supplies are severely depleted,
and, particularly, if breeder reactors
are by that time in operation, the
consumption of energy will not be seen
as supply limited but as carrying
capacity limited.
If that happens, it will not be the
renewable aspect of solar energy but
its non-polluting nature which will make
it an essential source. For it is not
only air and water pollution which
may call a halt to exponential growth
before anything else does, but It may
very well be thermal pollution the

### 50115: UNESCO and the changing attitudes toward solar energy

Unesco
and the changing
attitude toward
solar energy
by Rolf E. Glitsch
'OME twenty years ago it
was thought that solar energy might
provide the ideal answer to man's
energy needs but no breakthrough
in the direct conversion of sunlight
into energy application was made.
When the large-scale use of solar
energy did not flourish largely due to
economic reasons, many were disil¬
lusioned and others directed their
attention exclusively to small-scale, low
temperature applications for developing
countries. Certain of these appli¬
cations were successful, others failed
to materialize mainly due to social and
economic rather than technical reasons.
What has been operating here is a
particularly pernicious case of the
advanced-versus-developing nations di¬
lemma. Those who could most benefit
from the advance and utilization of

### 50115: UNESCO and the changing attitudes toward solar energy

solar energy technology the develop¬
ing countries, most of them in the solar
belt, with limited fuel resources, poor
communications and isolated popu¬
lations, and therefore much in need of
small solar-powered appliances (such
as pumps, refrigerators, heaters,
dryers) have lacked the scientific,
managerial and financial resources for
doing much about it.
And in the advanced industrial
countries where there is plenty of
capital and a surfeit of scientists and
engineers, there has been little interest
or incentive to invest human or
monetary resources in either large or
small scale use of new forms of energy.
Conventional fuel has, until recently,
been cheap and plentiful. The planning
and development of alternative sources
has been almost entirely in the
direction of nuclear power: "conven¬
tional"- fission, breeder reactors and
fusion. Small wonder that there has
been an unwillingness by both public
and private enterprise to finance the
research and development of solar
devices to make them competitive.
But over the last three years, at first
slowly, but more recently, quite dra¬
matically, attitudes have changed, and
events have occurred which make it
appear that the take-off point for solar
energy development may now have
been reached.
There is, at last, a widespread
appreciation that the earth is a small
planet with very limited energy re¬
sources; the costs to the industrial
states both monetary and political
of oil and natural gas are rising
sharply; progress in breeder reactors
and in controlled fusion has been slow;
mounting concern with pollution and
for the protection of the environment
has not only cast a shadow over the
use of fossil and nuclear fuels but
also put a brake on the construction
of oil pipelines and atomic plants and
on the resumption of large-scale coal
mining.
Finally, there have been a number
of interesting technological develop¬
ments although not yet major break¬
throughs in solar energy collection
and conversion. As a result solar
energy development is now receiving
wide (if not yet universal) respect and
increased scientific and technological
attention.
It is obvious that the time has come
for new trends and new approaches
to meet the energy needs of future
generations. Discussions and action
are therefore being initiated with a
view to finding acceptable solutions
not only on a national basis but also
on an international scale.
ROLF E. GLITSCH, geophysicist and mineral
resources expert, has been a member of
Unesco's Science Sector since 1968. From
1964 to 1968 he was Deputy Director of
Unesco's Field Science Office for the Arab
States in Cairo. He was previously engag¬
ed in applied research on the exploration
of mineral resources.
The situation today thus differs
considerably from that of the early
1950s when Unesco became active in
solar energy through its international
programme for the world's arid zones.
At that time Unesco and the Indian
Government organized, in New Delhi
in 1954, an international symposium on
solar energy (and wind power). Its
findings stressed the social and politi¬
cal implications as well as the technical
possibilities of the use of solar energy,
as did a number of technical studies
commissioned by Unesco. But with
the termination of the Arid Zone pro¬
gramme Unesco's interest and work in
solar energy became dormant an
attitude caused by the world-wide
stagnation in solar energy activities.
The United Nations too through its
Department of Economic and Social
Affairs had contributed to the dev¬
elopment of solar energy by organ¬
izing, in August 1961 in Rome, a large
symposium on practical ways of using
energy from the sun (as well as from
the wind and geothermal sources).
This major international meeting on
solar energy attracted about 500 scien¬
tists from over 50 countries. The
proceedings were published in full and
can be considered as a major contri¬
bution to the scientific literature in
this field.
w,HEN all the activities
towards the promotion of solar energy
application during the 1950s and 1960s
are assessed, it appears that the public
mainly judged solar energy appli¬
cations as a possible replacement for
other sources of energy. It is evident
that the result of the judgement was
not very favourable as there existed
no satisfactory solution to the problem
of solar energy storage.
Moreover, society underwent a cer¬
tain change during this era. Central¬
ized power production from coal, oil
and natural gas or nuclear material and
its distribution in the form of electrical
energy with the advantage of continual
coverage sometimes even an inter¬
national grid became far more attract¬
ive. This form of power was con¬
sidered more convenient than individual
power units of small size which
produced the required form of energy
often without its transformation into
electricity.
Solar energy applications could not
fulfill the requirements which society,
rightly or wrongly, expected of them
to be able to replace existing energy
sources, to be continuously available
(storage problem) and lastly to be not
only as cheap as other sources of
energy but preferably cheaper.
When society became seriously
concerned about the existing energy
resources solar energy came to be
regarded as an additional source of
energy, able to bridge the gap between
the existing and the required amount
of energy. Thus storage problems
and to a certain extent commercial
evalutions became less important.
Therefore, at the beginning of 1970,
Unesco reviewed its interest in solar
energy. A modest programme of
education, information and promotion
of international co-operation was
launched. Research fellowships were
awarded to scientists from developing
countries, technical aid was given in
Cuba and Mexico and a seminar on
solar energy and its applications in
Africa was organized (in Niamey,
Niger, in 1972) for engineers and
scientists from tropical Africa.
These activities culminated with
Unesco's participation in the planning,
organization and sponsorship of an
international congress, "The Sun In the
Service of Mankind" in July 1973 at
Unesco's Paris headquarters (see
article page 24).
Prior to the congress an inter¬
national group of specialists met in
Paris to advise Unesco on a possible
future programme in solar energy.
The group drew up a series of
recommendations for projects that
Unesco might consider for a broad
international programme. Its pro¬
posals include:
Additional Unesco-supported solar
energy training courses and an expan¬
sion of current fellowship awards to
scientists, engineers and technicians
in solar energy research institutes;
A clearing-house operation to
provide information on educational,
research and development aspects of
solar energy to scientists, engineers,
technicians, students and potential
users in member states;
Aid to non-governmental organi¬
zations and to international solar
energy seminars and workshops;
Missions to advise member states
on possible development programmes
in solar energy;
Co-operation with member states
in drawing up and evaluating national,
regional and global research and
development projects for the exploi¬
tation of solar energy. Such projects
might be designed to meet home,
community, agricultural and industrial
needs and embrace conventional solar
energy devices as well as newer
processes such as photovoltaic (solar)
cells (see article page 16). Particular
techniques and devices might include
the solar pond, building design for
natural heating and cooling, green¬
houses, and other biological appli¬
cations, solar furnaces for baking
bricks, solar pumps and other small
engines.
These proposals are now being
studied by Unesco in the context of HP
an eventual programme that would | Jl
open up new possibilities for inter¬
national co-operation in solar energy
and its applications. '

Solar energy, already being tapped

riddle popular with French
children concerns a farmer, a pond,
and a water lily. It goes like this.
The lily is doubling In size every day.
In 30 days it will cover the entire
pond, killing all the creatures living
in it. The farmer does not want that
to happen, but being busy with other
chores, he decides to postpone cutting
back the plant until it covers half the
pond. The question is: on what day
will the lily cover half the pond? The
answer Is, on the twenty-ninth day
leaving the farmer just one day to
save his pond.
The realization that society will have
to find the answer to this riddle has
recently surfaced, and the issues of
limits to growth are being debated.
The "energy crisis" generated by the
massive production and use of energy
in the technologically advanced coun¬
tries is one of the major topics before
the public.
The question that needs to be
answered is: has society reached the
level of sophistication to apply solar
energy for its overall long-term bene¬
fit consistent with the balance of
nature? The answer is not yet obvious.
However, efforts required to provide
the answer are beginning to be made.
The amount of energy the earth
receives continuously from the sun
is enormous some 167,000 times more
PETER E. GLASER, of the United States, Is
an internationally known authority on the use
of solar energy. He has published and spoken
widely on the potential of solar power to
meet future energy needs. He has directed
a number of American engineering develop¬
ment projects in this field and is currently
in charge of feasibility studies on the concept
of a satellite solar power station. Dr. Glaser
is a past President of the International Solar
Energy Society and is Editor- in Chief of
the Society's tournai.
The solar energy falling on the
roof of a house in a year far
exceeds the energy used in the
most highly industrialized coun¬
tries to heat or cool a house.
Here, energy from the sun is
absorbed by batteries of collec¬
tors on a roof which are painted
black to aid absorption. Hot
water produced by solar energy
is stored in cylinders behind
the solar collectors. Experience
shows that 100,000 solar water
heaters of this type can save
$1 million in fuel bills.
energy than we now consume One
square metre of land exposed to direct
sunlight receives the energy equivalent
of about 1 horsepower, or about
1 kilowatt. Three hundred square
metres of land receive enough energy
when converted to meet the electrical
power requirement of a typical one-
family residence. If a piece of land
in a desert 150 miles square could
be covered with reasonably efficient
energy conversion equipment, it could
supply all the energy required by a
country like the United States.
There are two obvious problems in
efficiently harnessing solar energy.
First, solar energy is not constantly
available. Thus some sort of storage
is needed to sustain a solar-powered
system through the night and during
periods when local weather conditions
cut off the supply of solar energy.
Second, solar energy is diffuse.
While the total amount of energy avail¬
able is enormous, the amount available
at any point is not large enough to be
useful. Thus, solar energy must be
collected and converted Into useful
forms.
Radiant energy from the sun is
readily convertible to heat; one need
only provide a surface on which the
solar energy can be absorbed. If the
surface Is black, more than 95 per cent
of the radiant energy is absorbed and
converted to heat. If a fluid, such as
air or water, is then brought in contact
with the heated surface, the energy can
be transferred Into the fluid and sub¬
sequently utilized for practical pur¬
poses.
The two basic alternatives are fo¬
cussing solar collectors and flat-plate
collectors. Focussing collectors use
parabolic reflectors to concentrate
solar energy; the efficiency of such
devices is good, but they must track
the sun and this requirement makes
them complicated and expensive. Flat-
plate collectors are simpler and

cheaper to build, but they do not
reach high temperatures and have
lower efficiency.
Glass-covered, flat-plate solar col¬
lectors can deliver heated air or
water at typical temperatures of 100°
to 200°F, useful in such applications
as house heating, domestic water heat¬
ing, crop drying, and the like.
Focussing solar collectors can deli¬
ver comparatively large amounts of
energy to small receivers ; the recei¬
vers can be operated at high tem¬
peratures for such uses as steam gen¬
eration, melting of metals, and heat
treating of materials.
In more than a dozen countries
throughout the world, domestic hot
water supplies are heated by solar
energy. Several million solar water
heaters are in use, mainly in Japan,
Australia, Israel, the United States, and
U.S.S.R.
The system usually comprises a
blackened sheet of metal in a shallow
glass-covered box occupying 10 to
50 square feet of roof area. Water
circulates through tubing fastened to
the surface of the metal sheet, the
warmed water being stored in an insu¬
lated tank generally at a level above
the solar collector. In a sunny climate,
the hot water supply of an average
family can be provided by such a sys¬
tem. Auxiliary heat from an electric
heating element or other heat source
can be employed if desired.
A simpler design involves a trans¬
parent plastic envelope, similar to an
air mattress, with a black bottom sur¬
face. The unit is filled with cold
water in the morning; the solar energy
absorbed during the day then provides
a supply of warm water late in the
afternoon. This type has been used
extensively in Japan.
The principle employed in solar
water heaters can be applied directly
as well to the heating of houses with
solar energy. A number of houses
have already been built using solar
heating systems. By enlarging the
solar heating panels or using more
of them on the roof of a dwelling,
sufficient heat can be absorbed in the
circulating water to provide most of
the heating requirements of houses
located in sunny climates.
A heat storage tank must also be
supplied, practical considerations dic¬
tating sufficient capacity to carry most
of the heating demand for one or two
typical winter days. Conventional
energy sources would be used to
supply the balance of the hot water
demand during unfavourable weather.
Air may also be used as the heat-
transfer medium in house heating sys¬
tems that employ solar energy. Air is
circulated across or behind the
blackened surfaces in glass-covered
panels mounted on the roof, and hot
air is delivered by fan and ducts to
the rooms of the building.
In the past 25 years, more than

TODAY'S REALITY
TOMORROW'S DREAM
Left, design concept for a satellite solar
power station. This audacious project (to
say the least) of an American firm in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, would be in
orbit at a height of 36,000 km. in space
where solar energy is available virtually
24 hours a day. The station would have
two banks of solar cells, each 25 square
kilometres in size (5X5 km!). It would
convert solar energy directly into elec¬
tricity and feed it to microwave generators
incorporated in a transmitting antenna
(diameter 1 km.) at its centre. The antenna
would direct a microwave beam to a
receiving antenna (diameter 7 km.) on the
earth where the microwave energy would
be converted back to electricity. How such
a gigantic device could be blasted Into
space is another problem, but if successful
it would generate electric power ranging
from 3,000 to 20,000 megawatts (a mega¬
watt is 1 million watts). Right, Skylab I,
the U.S. space station, photographed a few
months ago from Skylab II Command
Service Module. Its panels of solar cells
(cross-shaped and rectangular) provide a
power output of about 20 Kw. Inset,

POWER FROM THE SUN (Continued)
20 houses and laboratory buildings
have been heated, at least partially,
with solar energy on an experimental
basis. The United States, Australia,
and Japan have been most active in
this application. Most of the installa¬
tions have been technically successful.
Energy savings achieved through heat¬
ing homes with solar energy can have
a significant impact on energy con¬
sumption.
Residential cooling systems that rely
on absorption-refrigeration cycles will
require more technical development
before they can use solar-heated water
or air from a roof-mounted collector.
The Inherent advantage of solar
cooling is that the maximum require¬
ment coincides roughly with the time
when the maximum amount of energy
is available to operate the system, that
is, when the sun's radiation is most
intense. In addition, the solar col¬
lector, which is the most expensive
portion of the system, can be employed
nearly year-round if cooling is com
bined with solar heating.
The development of the devices
required to cool and heat houses with
solar energy has reached the stage
where these devices could be avail¬
able in less than 10 years if a mass
market is realized. In mass use, solar
heating and cooling devices could
reduce energy consumption. For
example, the potential energy savings
in the United States from the large-
scale introduction of solar heating and
cooling in buildings could exceed the
flow of oil expected from the Alaska
oil fields.
The primary advantage of converting
solar 'energy to power is the inherent
absence of virtually all of the undesir¬
able environmental conditions ascribed
to present and anticipated means of
power generation with fossil or nuclear
fuels.
Several imaginative concepts have
been proposed for the large-scale uti¬
lization of solar energy on Earth.
Which of the approaches will be the
most feasible alternative to present
power generation methods remains to
be established. The important fact is
that most of them are based on exist¬
ing technology and well-known physical
principles.
All large-scale terrestrial appli¬
cations of solar energy will require a
large land area because of the diffuse
nature of solar radiation. This favours
the development of energy conversion
devices which can either convert solar
energy directly into electricity, or,
through efficient processes, produce
high temperatures.
Very important to the success of
any large-scale use of solar energy on
Earth will be the capability of storing
energy when the sun Is not shining,
the transmission of electric power over
long distances, and the integration of
the transmission line into a power grid
system.
Solar energy can be converted
directly to electricity by means of a
cell constructed of a semiconductor

crystal such as silicon. This process
is called photovoltaic conversion.
In contrast to thermodynamic con¬
version, with photovoltaic conversion
there are no moving parts, no circu¬
lating fluid, and no material is
consumed. A solar cell can operate
for long periods without maintenance.
The first successful solar cell was
demonstrated in 1953. Today, similar
cells are a necessary part of the
power-supply system of most space¬
craft. As a result of the space pro¬
gramme, there is now a substantial
technological base for further dev¬
elopments. The two primary research
goals are increased efficiency and
lower costs. Efficiencies of 16 per cent
have been obtained. The theoretical
maximum for silicon solar cells is
23 per cent. Silicon solar cells can
be purchased today for about $20 a
watt.
New techniques in the production
of single-crystal silicon and automated
assembly of solar cells using mass
production methods could bring prices
as low as $1 per watt over the next
10 years. Once a major market has
opened up, the cost of silicon solar
cells could drop to only about 5 times
the cost of plate glass. Beach sand,
the material used to produce plate
glass, is the basic raw material for
silicon solar cells.
An alternative way of reducing costs
is by partially concentrating solar
radiation by means of mirror reflectors
to minimize the number of solar cells.
Large installations of reflecting mirrors
and solar cells could lead to low-
cost direct solar energy conversion
systems.
For example, one square mile cov¬
ered with such devices with an effi¬
ciency of only 10 per cent could gen¬
erate 180,000 kilowatts when the sun
shines. Since the sun does not shine
all of the time, energy storage would
be necessary with batteries or perhaps
through the production of hydrogen
by electrolysis.
The prospects of focussing the sun's
energy to generate steam for a power
plant have always been intriguing. A
solar powered steam engine, using a
large mirror to focus solar radiation
on a boiler, was displayed at a Paris
exhibition in 1878. Similar plants
were built in California in 1901 and in
Egypt in 1913.
Recently, large-scale terrestrial solar
power plants have been proposed to
work in conjunction with conventional
power plants. Several approaches for
the design of solar collectors and
thermal storage devices are being
investigated. Large areas of the desert
would have to be covered with arrays
of reflecting mirrors to focus the solar
radiation on to absorber tubes. At
least 100 square miles are needed to
generate 1,000 megawatts.
These tubes, which are coated with
selective radiation-absorbing coatings,
are expected to heat a circulating fluid
up to 1,000 "F. The fluid can then be
arranged to transfer the heat to thermal

storage to permit withdrawal of the
heat during cloudy days and at night.
Alternatively, heat pipes can be used
to transfer the heat from the solar
collector to the thermal storage. Heat
is transferred from the thermal storage
to the working fluid which drives tur¬
bine generators to produce electricity.
If this work proves to be successful,
demonstration plants are expected to
be built in several years, and large-
scale power plants are expected to be
possible in about 20 to 30 years. The
primary location for such power plants
would have to be sunlit desert areas
receiving predictable and copious
amounts of solar energy.
Solar energy sustains the winds.
The power potential in the winds over
the continental United States and its
seashores exceeds by at least a factor
of 10 the United States projected

needs for electricity in the year 2000.
Winds are remarkably repeatable and
predictable. A wind power system
could incorporate its own electricity
storage which may include the elec¬
trolysis of water to produce hydrogen
for transmission through pipelines as
an alternate fuel.
In 1915, 100 megawatts of electricity
was being generated by wind power in
Denmark. In the 1940s, a 1.000 kilo¬
watt machine was operated in Vermont,
U.S.A., on an experimental basis.
Substantial advances in the design of
very light-weight aeroturbines indicate
that small as well as large scale wind
power generation may be feasible.
Projections indicate that wind power
could generate 20 per cent of the
year 2000's annual electricity produc¬
tion. This projection is based on the
use of wind turbines ranging in size
from 100 kilowatts to 2 megawatts.
The temperature difference between
the sun-heated upper layer and the
deeper cold water of oceans can be
used to power very large heat engines.
Experimental power plants were built
in 1929 off the coast of Cuba and
in 1956 off the coast of Africa.
These plants failed because of design
limitations and damage by a hurri¬
cane. If successfully developed, this
approach would make it possible
to tap the tremendous heat energy
stored, for example, in the Gulf
Stream with the potential to generate
26 trillion kilowatt hours per year.
To extract this energy, specially
designed ships (with a potential output
of 500 megawatts) would be anchored
in the Gulf Stream. The warm sur¬
face waters are passed through heat
exchangers which boil a fluid such as
propane to drive huge turbines coupled
to generators. The cold water pumped

from the ocean depth is circulated
through heat exchangers to condense
the working fluid (propane).
The process has to rely on heat
engines operated over a temperature
difference of about 40° F. A system
efficiency of less than 5 per cent is
projected. The major challenge is to
develop the very effective heat
exchangers and to design the large
turbines to extract energy from the
working fluid. In addition, materials
have to be chosen to withstand the
effects of seawater for prolonged
periods.
Terrestrial conversion systems suffer
from the fact that sunlight is not
constantly available and is diffuse.
This means terrestrial systems all need
large collecting areas and storage
capacity. This also means that conver¬
sion systems are economical in only
a few favourable geographical loca¬
tions.
These are earth-bound obstacles,
and the way to overcome them is to
place the conversion system in a satel¬
lite solar power station orbiting the
earth where solar energy is available
nearly 24 hours a day (during the
equinoxes the satellite will pass
through the earth's shadow for a
maximum of 72 minutes each day).
The maximum utilization of solar
energy can be made in an orbit around
the sun. The first step towards the
fullest use of solar energy is repre¬
sented by a satellite in orbit around
the Earth. This approach permits solar
energy conversion to be carried out
where it Is most effective with only
the final step arranged to take place
on Earth.
Similar to already existing satellite
world-wide communications networks,
power from space has the potential to
provide an economically viable and
environmentally and socially accept¬
able means to meet future world
energy requirements.
A satellite solar power station can
be maintained in synchronous orbit
36,000 km. from Earth's equator. Two
symmetrically-arranged solar collectors
convert solar energy directly to elec¬
tricity by the photovoltaic process. The
electricity is fed to microwave gen¬
erators incorporated in a transmitting
antenna located between the two solar
collectors. The antenna directs a
microwave beam to a receiving antenna
on Earth where the microwave energy
is converted back to electricity.
Such a satellite can be designed
to generate electrical power on Earth
ranging from 3,000 to 20,000 mega¬
watts. A system of satellites main¬
tained in a desired orbital location
could deliver power to most desired
geographic locations with the receiving
antenna placed either on land or on
platforms over water near major load
centres.
The use of the microwave beam
allows all-weather transmission, so
that full use can be made of the nearly
24 hours of solar radiation available
in a synchronous orbit.
Only a limited expenditure of propel-
lants for altitude control is required
to overcome orbit-disturbing influ¬
ences, such as the gravitational effects
of the sun and moon, solar pressure
and the eccentricity of the Earth.
The power generated by the Satellite
Solar Power Station must be trans¬
mitted to a receiving antenna on the
surface of the Earth and then rectified.
The power must be In a form suitable
for efficient transmission in large
amounts .across long distances with
minimum losses and without affecting
the ionosphere and atmosphere.
The power flux densities received
on Earth must also be at levels which
do not produce undesirable environ¬
mental or biological effects. Fortu¬
nately, man has considerable experi¬
ence in high-power microwave gener¬
ation, transmission and rectification,
to achieve these design objectives.
A high-volume, two-stage transpor¬
tation system will be required for a
Satellite Solar Power Station. A low-
cost stage capable of carrying a high
volume of payloads to low-Earth orbit
and a high-performance stage capable
of delivering partially assembled el¬
ements to synchronous orbit for final
assembly and deployment.
The challenge of a Satellite Solar
Power Station capable of generating,
for example, 5,000 megawatts of power
on earth is to place into orbit a payload
of about 25 million pounds and propel-
lant supplies for station-keeping
purposes of about 30,000 pounds per
year. This challenge could be met
by a space transportation system with
the first phase represented by the
space shuttle now under development
in the United States.
Solar energy applications are still
in an early stage of development. It
is too early to tell which of the tech¬
niques now being studied will be
useful in the long run. The prospect
for developing these applications as
alternatives to other energy production
techniques appears to be very bright.
But no quick solutions are in sight.
However the successful development
of even a few significant solar energy
applications over the next few decades
will permit society to look beyond the
year 2000 with assurance that future
energy requirements of all nations
will be met without endangering the
planet Earth.
DOWN
ON THE
SOLAR
FARM
I HE old way to run a steam
turbine with solar energy is to do it with
mirrors or optical lenses. They catch the
sun, they focus it into a single hot spot
to heat a boiler and raise steam. Then the
turbine starts spinning to turn a dynamo
and produce electricity.
It's a simple idea but it's not economic.
Since the sun does not stay put, the
mirrors or the lenses must be moved by
a complicated tracking system to follow
it through the sky. On cloudy days or
even when the sun is obscured by a thin
haze, they do not work very well. There's
little heat, no steam and no electricity.
Several researchers have stopped look¬
ing into mirrors and, instead, they are
turning to flat-plate collectors of which
the simplest example is a black surface
covered with a pane of glass. This is a
"selective surface", it absorbs more heat
than it radiates and the difference can be
piped off and put to use. It catches heat
even when the sun is not directly overhead
so it need not be moved.
Since these surfaces do not concentrate
sunlight nearly as much as mirrors do, a
large area is needed to gather heat.
Mirrors are measured in square metres,
but selective surfaces are cheap and they
could be spread over hectares. This has
led to the concept of a solar power farm
with land covered by sunshine collectors
instead of crops.
Or. Aden P. Meinel, director of the
Optical Sciences Center at the University
of Arizona, and his wife, Marjorie Pettit
Meinel, have calculated that a square
measuring 118 kilometres on a side could
collect enough sunshine in the south¬
western United States to generate a million
megawatts (a megawatt is a million watts).
They think that a plant could be set up
in the Colorado River area where it would
occupy some ten per cent of now uninhabit¬
ed desert. Waste heat from the turbines
could be used to desalinate enough water
from the Pacific Ocean to meet the daily
needs of 120 million people.
The Meinels have developed a "planar"
collector that they use to heat their
Arizona home and they have recommend¬
ed that a 1-acre demonstration farm be set
up with a three year budget of $4 million
to test their system. In one model of a
solar power farm, they propose four rec¬
tangular plots of solar collectors which
would send heat to central storage tanks
feeding turbines.
This would be a power plant with no
tall smokestacks to smudge the air. The
Meinels note that even motor cars would
have to be banned from the area so that
smog would not reduce power delivery
from the sky. For once, more muck would
mean less money. I

YAMASHITA'S MIRRORS
ON A HOT TOKYO ROOF
When the mushrooming, high-rise buildings of modern Tokyo
shut out the sunlight from his old style, two-storey, wood-frame
house, Japanese businessman Yasuichi Yamashita decided that
something had to be done to get his sunshine back. He devised
a system of three reflectors, one placed in his courtyard and two
on the roof of a nearby building, with which to lighten his darkness.
It's all done by mirrors, but the sunshine that now floods Mr. Yama-
shita's house is no illusion.
Equipped with an electronic sensor, the lower
of these two mirrors (above), perched on a nearby
rooftop, automatically tracks the sun. The upper
mirror directs sunlight down into the Yamashitas'
courtyard where a third mirror (being cleaned,
below) bounces the sunlight inside the house (right).
The Yamashitas say that they not only have
their light and heat, but can also enjoy
looking at the stars at night without going outside.

SOLAR ENERGY
CLAIMS A NEW PLACE m
IN THE SUN W
On every continent, domestic heating
and lighting units, water pumps,
desalting stills, refrigerators
are running on solar energy.
by Dan Behrman
HE first rays of a world¬
wide co-operative effort to get more
power from the sun have appeared on
the international scientific horizon.
They could be discerned in the out¬
come of a meeting that brought thirteen
experts from four continents to Paris,
earlier this year to advise Unesco on
how to set up a solar energy pro¬
gramme. This mini-conference was
held just prior to the vast international
congress on "The Sun in the Service
of Mankind" that met under Unesco's
.sponsorship with its more than 800
participants from 59 countries.
Despite the discrepancy In size, the
two meetings were complementary.
The congress showed that techniques
are available to apply solar energy at
a time when the world faces a shortage
of fossil fuels (particularly oil and gas)
and a surplus of pollution; the experts'
meeting sought ways to bring these
techniques to developed and devel¬
oping countries alike.
The experts suggested that scientists
the world over consider the possibility
of an International Solar Energy
Decade, a "massive internationally-
founded and directed research and
development programme". This pro¬
posal was voiced emphatically at the
closing session of the congress by its

DAN BEHRMAN is a Unesco science writei.

Oceans" (Little Brown and Co., Boston,

Solar furnaces are not only
capable of converting solar
energy into electrical energy
and producing ultra-pure met¬
als, they are also a priceless
research tool for studying the
properties of materials at
high temperatures. Right,
the solar furnace at Mont
Louis in the French Pyrenees,
built in 1952. The world's

pleted In 1968 at nearby

ful and can reach a tem¬
perature of 3,500 degrees C.
president, Prof. Pierre Auger, a leading
French physicist and popularizer of
science.
The experts also asked Unesco's
Member States to think about "the
possible creation of an International
Solar Energy Commission to lead and
co-ordinate a larger future international
programme in solar energy".
The cautious optimism of the experts
was more than justified by the con¬
gress itself. There scientists marshall¬
ed facts and figures to show that in
such regions as the south-western Uni¬
ted States or the eastern Pyrenees In
France the sun is cheaper than elec¬
tricity as a way to heat homes, and is
getting within competitive reach of oil
and gas, two fuels that can only rise
in price.
A solar energy panel set up In the
United States by the National Science
Foundation and the National Aeronau¬
tics and Space Administration (NASA)
has concluded that by the year 2020
the sun could provide 35 per cent of
the nation's total building heating and
cooling needs; 30 per cent of its
gaseous fuel; 10 per cent of its liquid
fuel and 20 per cent of its electric
energy requirements.
But the panel did not think that Am¬
ericans would have wait fifty years
before starting to reap such benefits:
" If solar development programmes are
successful, building heating could
reach public use within 5 years, build¬
ing cooling in 6 to 10 years, synthetic
fuels from organic materials in 5 to
8 years and electricity production in
10 to 15 years."
Solar power is a good way to heat
houses because the sun delivers
energy right to the rooftop without the
long transmission lines required by
electric power plants. On the other
hand, solar-fired steam plants are very
inefficient when it comes to generating
electricity. It can be done a battery-
driven car has been run with electricity
produced by a solar engine but the
cost per kilowatt is so high that it is
just not realistic.
One way to get around this is to use

solar cells that convert sunshine
directly Into electricity without any
boilers or turbines. Developed for use
on artificial satellites in outer space,
solar cells are extremely efficient but
still wildly expensive. At one-
hundredth of their present cost, they
would be competitive and it is hoped
that mass production will bring thefr
price down.
One scientist at the congress, Prof.
Sean Wellesley-Miller from Massa¬
chusetts Institute of Technology, has
his own answer to the problem of cost.
"Just imagine that solar energy is
everywhere In use, providing energy
at a cost slightly above current prices.
Imagine further that I was proposing
the 'radical' idea of sending geological
survey teams to the Middle Eastern
deserts to search for oil and, having
found it, to erect derricks, extract it
and transport It either by pipeline or
by especially constructed ships to the
other side of the world where it would
be refined and delivered to end-use
points by truck.
"I am sure that, in these cases, there
would be many people who would
prove 'conclusively' that this would be
economically infeasible."
He might have added that solar-
powered generator plants would
appear less uneconomic if they were
stacked up against newly-invented
diesel engines built the same way in
small machines shops as one-of-a-kind
prototypes.
In countries other than the United
States, prospects for the sun are also
looking brighter. In Australia, it has
been estimated that 15 per cent of the
country's energy needs could be met
by solar power by the year 2000 and
government scientists are now studying
industrial applications that run from
water-heating to timber-drying.
The world's most powerful solar fur¬
nace, the 1 ,000-kilowatt machine used
to produce refractory materials of
extreme purity at Odeillo in the
Pyrenees of southern France, serves
as the focal point for a major French
effort directed by Prof. Félix Trombe.
He began his work right after World
War II, using reflectors from surplus
anti-aircraft searchlights, and he is now
one of the world's top solar energy
authorities.
Prof Trombe Is particularly proud of
the contribution he has been able to
make In Chile. In the clear, dry and
transparent atmosphere of the Chilean
coastal desert, loss of heat by radia¬
tion from the earth out into space at
night is very high. Temperature dif¬
ferences of more than 40° C. have
been obtained between an isolated
"black body" and the air around it.
Developed by Prof. Trombe this
process has been used by Chilean
scientists to desalinate brackish water
by freezing it. The fresh water, pro¬
duced at the rate of 10 litres per
square metre of basin per day, Is used
to grow tomatoes, radishes and cu¬
cumbers In greenhouses so that local
miners, working In one of the world's
driest deserts, can have a diet of fresh
vegetables.

is under study and is already in use
in various branches of the economy in
Sunny central Asia and the Caucasus
(see articles pages 32 and 38). As
for Japan, It probably leads the world
In the number of solar home water
heaters in use.
Canada, though in a more northern
latitude, is exporting expertise. At the
congress, a paper by members of the
Brace Research Institute of McGill
University's Macdonald College in
Quebec described how a large-scale
solar steam cooker has been installed
to feed 240 pupils at a school in Haiti.
The Institute's help had been re¬
quested by a religious community, Les
Filles de la Sagesse, at Miragôane in
Haiti. Charcoal, the traditional fuel,
had become so scarce and expensive
that the school was spending $60 a
month just to heat the noonday meal
for its pupils. Kerosene and similar
fuels were not available because they,
too, are costly in Haiti.
The Brace Institute's paper, written
R. Alward, T.A. Lawand and P.
Hopley, described how a solar steam
cooker was built for a total cost of
$520 which means that it can pay for
itself in fuel savings In less than nine
months.
One should not forget that this is a
special situation. In India, for example,
a solar cooker as good as a 500-watt
electric hot plate was tested but
without success. Families did not
always want to eat their big meals at
noon when a solar stove works best,
of course, as In the case of the Haitian
school nor did women like to cook
outside. When they did, they felt
obliged to feed all the curious who
came around to watch, and that drove
up the price of solar energy. It would
also drive up the price of barbecues if
such a tradition of hospitality existed
elsewhere .
OLAR energy has proven
economic first of all in the sort of
absurd situations that affluence pro¬
duces. Heating a swimming pool with
the sun can mean a saving of several
hundred dollars a month with no great
hardship if one must miss a dip on an
occasional cloudy day. In countries
where fresh water is sold at a price
that other countries pay for wine, a
solar still can pay for itself very quickly.
As Dr Aden P. Meinel from the
U.S., one of Unesco's group of experts,
put It, solar energy is no longer a
hobby for scientists and it is getting
out "into the industrial world where
money and men answer key ques¬
tions".
Dr John Duffie, another expert and
head of the solar energy laboratory
at the University of Wisconsin in the
U.S., remarked that money is not
enough: "If you give me a dollar and
I give you a dollar, we each have one
dollar. If I give you an idea and you
give me an idea, we each have two
ideas."
This Is the approach that the
experts have urged on Unesco. Sur¬
veys are needed of existing inform¬
ation and a clearing-house should be
set up to make It available where It Is
most needed.
The capacity to apply solar energy
can be augmented in several ways,
the experts believe. They recommend
that Unesco should support such acti¬
vities as the seminar It organized in
October 1972 at Niamey (Niger) on
solar energy in Africa or the training
course it sponsored a year later in
France at Perpignan, with Prof. Félix
Trombe. They also asked that
countries should be helped to start
research and development work that
could be financed internationally.
Such work is needed to develop
greenhouses, solar pumps for irriga¬
tion, small furnaces to fire bricks, bet¬
ter buildings to take advantage of
natural heating and cooling or techni¬
ques to store the energy of the sun
overnight or longer.
That, perhaps, is the ' toughest
problem of all in solar energy: what
does one do when the sun doesn't
shine? The experts could hardly
recommend the solution suggested by
Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's
Travels:
"He had been eight years upon a
project for extracting sunbeams out
of cucumbers which were to be put
in phials, hermetically sealed, and let
out to warm the air in raw inclement
summers."
Luckily, the earth's supply of human
ingenuity is not running out as fast
as its reserves of fossil fuels. At the
Paris congress, a number of uncon¬
ventional solutions were advanced,
nearly all based on the commonsense
approach that the best way to collect
and store the sun's energy is to use
nature's way. One of them is photo¬
synthesis, the process by which plants
manufacture carbohydrates (sugars,
starches, cellulose) from carbon
dioxide and water.
It is the basis of the "energy planta¬
tion" described in a paper contributed
to the congress by an American
scientist, George C. Szego. He wants
to use the sun to grow trees for
fuel.
According to his calculations, 400
to 500 square miles of land could
produce enough organic matter in the
form of trees to feed a 1,000-megawatt
power plant. Burning wood, he
remarks, does not lead to much pollu¬
tion and actually produces ash that
could be used as a fertilizer to grow
more trees.
He thinks that by farming trees to
stoke an electric power station it
should be possible to produce fuel at
a cost close to $1 per million BTU's
(British Thermal Units). In the U.S.,
he said, coal and oil-fired plants now
operate at a cost of about $70 per
million BTU's.

SOLAR
HOME
I HERE are some people who
say we will be heating and cooling our
homes with solar energy fifty years from
now... and there are other people who have
decided they don't want to watt that long.
One of them is Harold R. Hay from
Los Angeles who has invented a new
word: solarchitecture. In a paper present¬
ed to Unesco's Paris congress on "The
Sun in the Service of Mankind", Hay
defines this as "the essential integration
of interdisciplinary knowledge involving
natural radiation forces, building design,
materials of construction, and human com¬
fort".
He first experimented with a house in
Phoenix, Arizona, which he succeeded in
heating and cooling with a roof pond
20 centimetres deep. Moveable panels
let the pond warm up by day during the
winter, then shield it at night to keep the
heat in. In summer, the pond stays cover¬
ed by day and, at night, the panels open
to let the heat out.
Since then, Hay has constructed a
solarchitecture house at Atascadero, Cali¬
fornia, on a test site that he calls "nearly
ideal for demonstrating that heat storage
produces superior comfort to the wasteful
use of power for alternately heating during
the cold nights and cooling during the hot
daytime".
Cheap and easily available, water is
Hay's preferred heat-storage medium. He
uses it to fill piastic tubes which are
inserted into walls of hollow concrete
blocks. Hay remarks that such natural
air conditioning is particularly appropriate
to developing countries. Walls of earth,
brick or stone can be built to support roof
ponds even though they are priced out of
the market in most industrialized countries.
There is no need to buy motors and com¬
pressors with scarce foreign exchange.
Natural air conditioning could be of special
help to hospitals because it provides
"gentle and uniform comfort with no noise,
drafts or disease-spreading circulation of
air".
This means a premium on low buildings
because they have a much higher ratio of
roof to total floor area and it is the roof
that is needed to collect or get rid of
heat. Such architecture runs counter to
the universal trend of monumental high-rise
buildings standing in lonely grandeur
amidst a desert of parking lots.

sun using a system evolved by two
Frenchmen, architect Jacques Michel and
Professor Félix Trombe, head of the Solar

the French Pyrenees. Vertical panels of
polyglass are placed on the facade of the

The "greenhouse" effect thus achieved
causes heat from the sun to be absorbed

the bottom of the wall, rises as it is
heated between the polyglass and the
heated wall and is then returned to the
rooms. Below, model of a group of three

Hay wrote in his paper: "Land use and
value are changing in ways that will affect,
and will be affected by, on-site use of
solar energy. Land prices may become
higher wherever natural microclimates
reduce the need for extra energy and
property deeds might be required to
indicate the energy value of building sites.
"To conserve virgin areas, new cities
should be built on abandoned agricultural
land and planned for lower power and fuel
consumption through natural heating and
cooling."
Solar water heating for domestic pur¬
poses has been a small but flourishing
industry in Australia for some 15 years,
with a sizable export trade. Solar dis¬
tillation is not yet established commer¬
cially, but a number of solar stills have
been built and used successfully. Research
programmes are being carried out by the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization and at a number of
universities and work has begun on energy
conversion using photovoltaic cells. Left,

### 50204: The Well of knowledge: how a school's solar pump transformed a Mauritanian oasis

by Howard Brabyn
W<ORN smooth and stained
from constant handling, a length of
rope, knotted at regular intervals, lies
neatly" colled beside the mouth of the
Well. Untouched since the day nine
months ago when it hauled up the last
bucket of water drawn by hand by an
inhabitant of Chinguetti, the rope
mutely links sombre past with
hopeful present.
For this is no ordinary well, and
Chinguetti is no ordinary town. The
seventh most holy place of Islam, the
oasis of Chinguetti is a gruelling,
700 kilometre drive, along barely dis¬
cernible desert tracks, due east from
Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania.
Here deep in the Sahel, the semi-
arid region fringing the southern limits
of the Sahara and stretching across
the heart of Africa from Mauritania to
the Sudan, a crucial social and tech¬
nological experiment is being put to
the relentless test of practical applica¬
tion.
At the well, after centuries of ser¬
vice, knotted ropes and knotted
muscles have given way to a classic,
hydropump powered by sunlight ab¬
sorbed and converted by collectors
installed in the roof of Chinguetti's
brand new schoolhouse.
Operating five to seven hours a day,
every day, the pump can provide each
of Chinguetti's 3,000 inhabitants with
a daily 20 litres of water, just double
the amount consumed before the pump
was installed.
Before the pump came to Chin¬
guetti, one member of a family would
spend as much as half a day merely
drawing water for the household. Often
the task was delegated to children as
young as six years old.
Drawing water was not a pleasant
task, but the well was one of the
natural centres of community life. For
many Mauritanian children, the things
they saw and the conversations they
heard as they waited their turn at the
well represented an important part of
their general education.
In installing a solar pump was there
not a danger of increasing the water
supply but at the same time drying up
the well of knowledge, of destroying
one of the focal social points of com¬
munity life?
The logical solution? Build a school
with a roof that would act as a solar
energy collector. The well of know¬
ledge would be revived and com¬
munity life invigorated.
Other problems arose. What form
should the new building take? Should
it be a functional building of ultra¬
modern design? Or should an attempt
be made to make it harmonize with
such beautiful existing buildings as
Chinguetti's ancient mosque?
This question resolved itself in the
happiest possible way. A tower was
essential to house the pump and
storage tanks and attached to this
was the school building itself, the roof
of which had to be of simple, rather
flat gable type if it was to fulfil its
role as an energy collector. The build¬
ing was erected by local labour under
the direction of an experienced fore¬
man from Senegal, since the Sene¬
galese are traditionally the expert
masons of west Africa.
The resulting construction, with Its
courtyards, small windows and tower
topped with the traditional protube¬
rances, which guard the building and
Its occupants from danger, blends
perfectly with the age-old buildings of
Chinguetti. What is more, the design
is such that the entire building could
be constructed with local materials.
Some nine months after the com¬
pletion of the pumphouse-school the
pump is smoothly throbbing away
bringing the benediction of water to
3,000 people. Its simple controls are
handled by an unskilled local man.
Only one technical inspection a year
will be required and the designers
hope that the pump will still be throb¬
bing away in 15 or even 20 years time.
School has begun and Chinguetti has
resumed its traditional way of life
relieved of one back-breaking, soul-
destroying labour and with its water
supply doubled.
The story of the Chinguetti pump
began in the early 1960s when the
late Professor Henri Masson, doyen
of the University of Dakar and long¬
time resident in Africa, turned his
attention to the problem of improving
the water supply of this drought-prone
region.
There were, he knew, adequate
reserves of water just 10 to 20 metres
below the surface and nothing, in
theory, could be easier than to dig
new wells or improve old ones and
then instal classic pumps powered by
the tried and trusty diesel engine. The
necessary technology, It seemed,
already existed and was only waiting
to be applied.
But was it the right technology for
this part of Africa? Who would instal

considerable expense from abroad?
How could spare parts and fuel
supplies be transported to remote com¬
munities across these trackless
wastes? What would it all cost?
The questions answered themselves.
The technology was available but it
was the wrong technology. Somehow
a way had to be found of producing
long-life, maintenance-free equipment
and of tapping the only abundant,
locally-available energy source the
sun.
In the laboratories of the Institut
de Physique Météorologique, at Dakar
university, Professor Masson and a
young French engineer, Jean-Pierre
Girardier, rapidly reviewed the classic
methods of solar energy conversion.
The initially attractive notion of
employing direct conversion by means
of silicon solar cells (like those used
to power spacecraft) was soon ruled
out on the grounds of cost.
Next to be considered was con¬
version by means of a high temp¬
erature thermal cycle using focussing
collectors such as parabolic mirrors
which concentrate the sun's rays on
a small receiver capable for example
of producing steam (if you set light to
a piece of paper by focussing the sun's
rays on it with a magnifying glass
you are using the same principle).
The practical difficulties of this
method soon led to its rejection. The
mirrors are bulky and easily damaged
by wind and sand; they have to be
continually adjusted as the sun moves
across the sky; and even small
amounts of cloud reduce their effi¬
ciency considerably.
simpler, more reliable me¬
thod was needed to cope with the
harsh conditions of Africa. The two
men turned their attention to a form of
conversion using fixed, flat-plate
collectors.
The principle behind this solar
energy conversion method is compa¬
ratively simple. Water circulating in
a closed system of pipes running
through flat-plate collectors is heated
by the sun. The heat from this water
causes a liquid gas, such as butane,
to expand rapidly thus building up a
pressure that drives a piston which
in turn drives a pump. The gas then
passes through a condenser where it
is cooled and liquefied by the cold
water pumped up from the well on its
way to the storage tank, and the cycle
is then ready to begin again.
The principle may indeed be simple,
but in practice it calls for a faultlessly
designed, high efficiency engine capa¬
ble of operating with very small temp¬
erature differences. The pump at
Chinguetti, for example will operate
when the temperature of the well water
used for cooling is as high as
35 degrees centigrade and the temp¬
erature of the water in the collectors is
as low as 60 degrees. Simple flat-
plat collectors, however, can easily
produce temperatures of 70 to 75
degrees.
Experiments with a number of
strictly laboratory prototypes with no
possible practical application were
followed by the production of four
practical prototypes all of which are
still in service.
First to be installed, in 1966, was
the "NADJE" pump, to be followed
two years later by the "SEGAL" pump
(both initially Installed at the Institut
de Physique Météorologique de Dakar,
Senegal, though "SEGAL" was later
transferred to a site in the bush).
Then came the "ONERSOL" pump
(installed at Bossey-Bangou, near Nia¬
mey, Niger, and operated under the
expert guidance of Dr. Abdou Mou¬
mouni, Director of the Niger Office of
Solar Energy (ONERSOL) and one of
Africa's leading authorities on solar
energy). In 1971 followed the installa¬
tion of the "OUAGA" pump, at Oua¬
gadougou, Upper Volta, on which the
first experiments in using the thermal
cycle of commercial butane were made.
By this time Jean-Pierre Girardier
was back in France. Working in a
cramped corner of his firm's work¬
shops, he perfected the "Chinguetti"
pump, the first fully operational pump
designed to fit into an integrated cons¬
truction planned in co-operation with
helio-technicians and architects.
In Paris Girardier had made contact
with two architects, M. and Mme
Alexandroff, both teachers at the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where
they were members of the "Groupe
Tiers-Monde" (Third World Group), a
multi-disciplinary teaching group con¬
sisting of architects, engineers, geo¬
graphers, sociologists, etc.
This was a decisive moment in the
pump's development. Not only did
this contact lead to a considerable
increase in the pump's efficiency,
thanks to the development of improved
collectors known as "Canaletas", or
"Solar Gutters", but it also brought
increased emphasis on the economic,
cultural and sociological implications
of introducing a revolutionary techno¬
logy into a remote African community.
Perhaps for the first time ever, a
piece of new technology was being
planned as much round basic socio¬
logical considerations as on technical
imperatives. Indeed, anyone who
really cares about Third World dev¬
elopment, who wants to make sure that
the right technology is used at the
right time, at the right place, in the
right way, might be well advised to
take a trip to Chinguetti to look at a
length of coiled rope and to drink of
the well of knowledge. M
Scientist O. Avezov of the Uzbe¬
kistan Academy of Sciences takes
a compact solar still which he
helped to invent for a practical
test in the desert. The "portable
well", as it has been dubbed,
weighs only three kilograms and
can hold two litres of salt water.
Folding solar panels open out to
capture the sun's energy and
provide drinking water.

language of figures and formulas rather
than the language of poets.
There was a wave of interest in solar
devices in the eighteenth century. In
1741, Mikhail Lomonosov submitted a
paper to the Russian Academy of
Sciences, in which he suggested
"exploring the electrical force in the
focus of an instrument of combustion".
There is an illustration of an imposing
machine for concentrating the sun's
rays in a treatise by Lavoisier.
Scientists in the second half of the
twentieth century, with their more
business-like approach to the future,
have turned with fresh enthusiasm to
this ancient problem of harnessing the
sun's energy. In 1950, the French
physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie de¬
clared: "If we had the proper equip¬
ment and if we could use only 10 per
cent of the solar radiation falling on a
surface equivalent to the area of
Egypt, we would obtain as much energy
as the whole world produces today."
Certain enthusiasts of technological
progress, accustomed to juggling with
the astronomical figures of power out¬
put of modern industrial plants, conti¬
nued to take the traditional view of
I
solar devices as technically impracti¬
cable curiosities. The error is for¬
givable: Watt's steam engine, Diesel's
motor, Laval's turbine and Tsiolkov-
sky's rockets were all regarded by
their less far-sighted contemporaries as
little more than fairground attractions.
Soviet scientists fully realize the
potentialities of what many of them call
the "noble fuel". The pros and cons of
modern solar technology have also
been carefully weighed from the eco¬
nomic point of view. As a result, an
integrated plan for Soviet research in
this field has been produced.
The research and development plan
takes into account the guidelines
which have been laid down for the
economic development of the U.S.S.R.
and which foresee the irrigation of
millions of acres of natural pasture and
the sinking of tens of thousands of
boreholes. It would in many cases be
advantageous if the pumps required
for this purpose could be powered by
solar energy. This would make it
easier to keep herds on distant pas¬
tures and would mean a saving of
millions of roubles.
Most of the uses of solar technology
are connected with agriculture, but
there is also a very wide range of pos¬
sible domestic uses, and the integrated
research plan provides for a number
of laboratories to specialize in this
aspect.
Scientists in Uzbekistan have con¬
centrated their attention on the trans¬
formation of solar energy into elec¬
tricity using semi-conductors, and are
building domestic solar water-heaters,
cookers, stills and refrigerators on this
principle. Specialists in Turkmenia are
working on air-conditioning devices for
appartments as well as for devices to
supply drinking water to cattle pas¬
tures.
The heating of buildings by solar
means is being studied in Georgia,
while in Armenia the possibility of
constructing devices or plants for
metal-smelting operations, where a
high degree of purity is required, is
being explored. A laboratory of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences' Power
Institute (Moscow) is seeking to im¬
prove the technical specifications of
solar devices by studying the physical
processes involved.

### 50205: Hunting the sun in the steppes of Central Asia; drinking water in the desert now fifty times cheaper

This concerted scientific programme
is already beginning to bear fruit in
some parts of Soviet central Asia and
the Transcaucasus. A powerful solar
still has been installed on the Shafir-
kan State Farm in Uzbekistan, where
sheep are bred to produce astrakhan.
It supplies about four metric tons of
fresh water a day, at only 2 roubles a
cubic metre. This is quite an achieve¬
ment, when it is recalled that in some
desert regions the same quantity of
water costs a hundred roubles. The
still can work perfectly well even in
winter.
A group of research scientists
under Corresponding Member of the
Uzbeck Academy of Sciences Giyas
Umarov has built and successfully
tested prototypes of a compact solar
cooker and a portable solar still. The
heat source for the cooker is a folding
parabolic collector with a diameter of
1.2 metres. In clear weather, it pro¬
duces as much heat as an 800 watt
electric cooker and a volume produc¬
tion model costs no more than
35 roubles.
The still, which its inventors have
called a "portable well", weighs only
3 kg. when empty, and when full can
hold 2 litres of saline water. A factory
now being built in Bokhara will begin
to turn out these devices in 1974, and
when in full operation will produce
25,000 water-heaters, cookers and
stills a year.
In the deserts of central Asia, where
even in the shade the temperature
sometimes reaches 50°C, the problem
of keeping food is particularly difficult.
The ordinary domestic refrigerator
works by the evaporation of a liquid
refrigerant and must therefore incor¬
porate a pump, which complicates the
design of the refrigerator and makes
the apparatus less reliable.
A member of the physics Faculty of
the Bokhara Institute of Education,
Orif Shodiev, has built a refrigerator
using a solid refrigerant, ammoniate,
which evaporates directly when heated
by solar energy, without passing
through the liquid phase, and then
re-crystallizes. This refrigerator requi¬
res no pump, is simple to use and
reliable and the hotter the weather
the more ice it produces.
The Bakharden State Farm in the
heart of Turkmenia's Karakum desert
has been using a unique solar still for
the last five years. It supplies three
metric tons of drinking water for the
farm's sheep every 24 hours. This
fully automatic device uses solar
power both to pump the saline solution
out of the ground and to distill it.
The main components are a collector
with a surface area of 20 square
metres and a solar battery with an area
of about 1 square metre. Its operating
voltage is about 27 V and its power
output is half a kilowatt. It is automa¬
tically equipped to follow the sun
across the sky, to find it again after it
has emerged from behind clouds and
to swing back from west to east in the
morning. An apparatus of this type
becomes economically viable when
alternative sources of fresh water are
more than 35 to 40 kilometres away.
Tests carried out in the Central Asian
republics with photo-electric genera¬
tors which activate the sluices of
automated irrigation systems show that
it is cheaper to instal such a system
than to bring in a low-voltage power
line.

sorts for fruit, grain, sunflower seeds,
meal, fish, timber, etc., and the
temperature in greenhouses and driers
can be raised by 9 or 10°C by using
selective glass which lets through
sunlight at the short-wave end of the
spectrum and reflects long-wave radia¬
tion from its inner surface.
Until recently, no attention was paid
to solar radiation in the design of
insulation for buildings; only the
external winter temperature was taken
into account. In recent years, however,
a new field of science, to which the
name of "constructional actinometry"
or "heliotechnics" has been given in
the U.S.S.R., has come into being and
has considerably influenced thinking in
this area.
A device now being tested in Turk¬
menia is capable of "servicing" a four-
storey block of flats using only solar
energy. It provides air-conditioning,
water heating (up to 300 litres per
household per day), and central
heating. Installation of this apparatus
increases building costs by only 4 to
6 per cent and in any case pays for
itself in two to three years from
savings in electricity and fuel. Resi¬
dential and industrial buildings using
this system are to be constructed in
many parts of the Soviet Union, parti¬
cularly in places a long way away from
grid supplies.
Some of the solar devices which
have been built in the U.S.S.R. are by
no means small-scale units. The huge
solar furnace which is being built in
Erevan, capital of Armenia, will be
unique of its kind. The parabolic
mirror will be 10 metres in diameter
and the furnace will develop 50 kilo¬
watts at a temperature of about
4,000°C. The Erevan furnace- will be
used both for research and for indus¬
trial applications.
Less powerful prototypes are already
in operation. Only with the use of
solar energy is it possible to reach the
high degree of purity nowadays requi¬
red in order to obtain heat-resistant
materials, semi-conductors, lumino¬
phores and new chemical compounds.
Scientists are already saying that a
"solar era" in power engineering is on
the way if not in the twentieth then
in the twenty-first century. A preview
of this era was offered by a recent
exhibition of science-fiction paintings,
"Tomorrow's World", held In Moscow.
A picture by the Soviet astronaut
Alexei Leonov and the painter Aleksan-
der Sokolov showed a gigantic mirror
orbiting in space. Lighting up vast
regions of the earth at night, such a
device could be immensely useful to
places where ground and air traffic is
particularly heavy after dark.


### 50207: What ducks have taught us about 'biological clocks'

What ducks have taught us
about 'biological clocks'
HE sun is essential to all forms of life,
but it can have injurious as well as beneficial effects. These twin aspects
of the effects of sunlight were highlighted in the "Sun and Life" section of
the international congress, "The Sun in the Service of Mankind", held at
Unesco headquarters in July 1973.
Ultra-violet rays, for example, play an important role in the development
of the human bone structure, but can also have a harmful effect upon the
skin (see back cover).
A number of studies described the effect of light on the nervous system,
on muscular reaction time, etc.
Human beings and ducks enjoy and need the sun (see opposite page),
and experiments with ducks have taught biologists a great deal about the
physiological mechanism by which light affects various glands. Research
carried out by Jacques Benoit, honorary professor at the Collège de
France, Paris, has shown the effects of orange and red radiations in
stimulating the gonads (sexual glands) and endocrine glands. Light
stimulation occurs through the eye, but experiments have shown that it
can act directly upon the hypothalamus (a sort of mini-brain within the
brain proper) and cause rapid development of the gonads.
Other studies show that our organs and their activities are regulated
by an internal, biological "clock" mechanism directly linked to the
day/night solar rhythm. " Jet-lag ", the feeling of malaise, loss of appetite,
difficulty in sleeping, etc., experienced by an air passenger transported
thousands of miles in a few hours, results from the sudden upsetting of
biological rhythms.
After a flight from New York to Paris, for example, it takes several
days to re-establish the waking-sleeping rhythm, a week to re-establish
the temperature rhythm, and several weeks for certain glandular activities
to resume normal functioning. The precise cause and effect of this
phenomenon have yet to be fully understood and explained.
Professor Benoit's experiments with ducks have helped to clarify the
relationship between light and human biology. Drakes were confined
either in total darkness or in uninterrupted light ; in both cases they
went through three or four sexual cycles during a year instead of the
usual single cycle.
Such discoveries mark the birth of " chronobiology ", a new discipline
of great importance since it has shown that the human organism is
affected by medicines or toxins to a greater or lesser degree according
to the time of day. The mortality rate of rats injected with nicotine varied
from 83 per cent at 1800 hours to only 8 per cent at 1300 hours. Similarly,
reaction to penicillin varied as much a« 41 per cent, the most favourable
period being between 1900 hours and 0400 hours.
Other experiments described at the congress included those carried
out by Professor Jean Dorst of the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris,
on the seasonal migration of birds and fish. These experiments show
that birds are able to keep track of the sun's position throughout the day
and when in flight to make the necessary corrections of course every
hour to compensate for the apparent movement of the sun. This implies
that birds also have a form of internal " clock " which " reminds " them
to take this factor into account.
All this research is revealing hitherto unsuspected facts about the
mechanism of these biological " clocks ".

### 50208: Irradiated seedlings for better crops; using concentrated light impulses we can now alter the genetic characteristics of plants

IRRADIATED SEEDLINGS
FOR BETTER CROPS
Using concentrated light impulses we can
now alterthe genetic characteristics of plants
by Aleksander Shakhov
38
LLTHOUGH solar energy is
the very basis of agriculture and
forestry, paradoxically, little attention
has been paid to the problem of
increasing the efficiency with which
plant life makes use of solar energy.
It is true that scientists have for
years been studying the process of
photosynthesis whereby plants, in the
presence of sunlight, can assimilate
carbon dioxide from the air and pro¬
duce oxygen. The study of this
process over the last 200 years has
given us considerable insight into the
mechanism which enables plants to
use sunlight and into the biosynthesis
of the products of chemical changes
in living matter.
But the hopes which scientists
entertained of bringing about a signi¬
ficant increase in the productivity of
agricultural crops by improving the
process of photosynthesis have been
disappointed. In the course of many
millions of years of evolution, plants
would appear to have developed such
a sophisticated apparatus for captur¬
ing and processing light in their leaves
that it would be extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to improve on it and
make it even more productive.
Nature appears to have provided
plants with the ability to assimilate
light in limited quantities, so that the
processes within the plant cells are
not harmed by large doses. Even in
countries with a humid tropical cli¬
mate and favourable conditions of
temperature, the rate of photosynthesis
is not very high.
It has been calculated that plants
in the process of photosynthesis assi¬
milate only from half to one per cent
of all the light energy absorbed by
their leaves, and only in the most
favourable circumstances does this
figure rise to 4 or 5 per cent, which
is the absolute limit.
ALEKSANDER SHAKHOV, Soviet expert on
plant physiology, is a pioneer of studies on
techniques designed to increase crop yields
by exposing plant seeds, pollen and tubers
to concentrated sunlight. He heads a research
team at the Timiryazev Institute of the Phy¬
siology of Plants of the U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences in Moscow.
Scientists have nevertheless per¬
sisted for many years in their desire
to increase the amount of light which
can be used by plants. Could plants
use more solar energy if it could be
introduced into those parts, such as
seeds, pollen or tubers, which do not
have the faculty of photosynthesis?
Would it not be possible to improve
yields of plants and thus improve crops
by using intense sunlight in some way?
This was an idea which occured to
my colleagues and myself in the late
1950's when we were doing research
in the Kola peninsula in the Arctic on
the effects of 24-hour sunlight. In
these regions, where the sun is very
low in the sky, the sunlight contains a
relatively high proportion of red and
infrared rays. Although infrared rays
play no part in photosynthesis, they
are more actively absorbed by plants
in the Arctic than in the middle lati¬
tudes, as if to make up for the heat
which the plants lack.
We set out this idea in a paper
which we published in 1957 on "The
photothermic hypothesis of the adapt¬
ation of plants in Arctic conditions".
This theory stressed the possible
significance of non-photosynthetic use
of solar energy. This idea found
further confirmation when we were
able to observe the striking effect of
concentrated sunlight on non-photo-
synthesizing seeds, pollen and tubers.
When, by subsequent research, we
were able to prove that the biochem¬
ical processes in those components
of the plant's cell known as mitochon¬
dria and peroxisomes and the cell
nucleus changed under the influence
of light, we advanced a theory of the
"non-photosynthetic transformation of
light energy by plants".
Many years of experiments over the
length and breadth of the Soviet Union
have shown that the transformation of
light in the non-photosynthesizing
organs of plants can produce appre¬
ciable effects and that this is there¬
fore a new way of increasing plant
yields. In our early research on this
subject, we subjected plants and seeds
to a brief but intense "shower" of
light, using sunlight reflected and
intensified by the mirror of a solar
device. In order not to singe the
plant, it is irradiated in short bursts
pulses of from 1 to 0.01 second's
duration. The period between the
pulses is a fraction of a second. Dur¬
ing irradiation, the plant receives
thousands of pulses or "light quanta".
By treating the seeds of various
plants (e.g. potatoes) in this way, it
is possible to accelerate and Improve
germination and the growth of shoots.

deep into the cell itself, the light
quanta act directly upon the funda¬
mental cell processes. They stimulate
the formation of a membranous system
in those parts of the cell where the
energy processes take place, increas¬
ing the activity of the enzymes which
are the catalysts of biochemical reac¬
tions. More important still is the fact
that irradiation with pulses of light
affects the synthesis of proteins and
nucleic acids and also affects the
chromosomes and genes which govern
heredity.
As a result of experiments it has
been possible, for instance, to Increase
the early crop of tomatoes and cucum¬
bers in Kazakhstan by 20 to 30 per
cent. The overall yield on experi¬
mental fields with an area of between
10 and 20 hectares has been increased
by 15 to 16 per cent.
ROMISING results have
been obtained in some sugar-beet
growing areas of the Soviet Union.
Pulsed-light irradiation of sugar-beet
seeds has produced not only a heavier
yield but has also increased the sugar
content by from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent
and more as against the 0.5 to 0.7 per
cent increase which has been pro¬
duced by selective breeding over a
period of 25 years.
In Kazakhstan, by subjecting pota¬
toes and melon, water-melon and soya
bean seeds to 45 minutes of irradia¬
tion, yield of those crops have been
increased by 15 to 20 per cent, and

### 50208: Irradiated seedlings for better crops; using concentrated light impulses we can now alter the genetic characteristics of plants

cotton yields have similarly increased
in Uzbekistan by 5 to 10 per cent.
Such is the effect of pulses of
concentrated sunlight en the non-pho-
tosynthesizing organs of plants. This
effect is even more pronounced when
the light alters the hereditary charac¬
teristics of the plant, but this requires
a longer period of irradiation.
If seedlings of spring-sown wheat
are submitted to a daily dose of
pulsed-light radiation of 30 minutes for
between 10 and 20 days, the next year
the descendants of these plants will
have bigger ears with a larger number
of grains and will ripen a week earlier.
The yield of the new strains, known
as photomutants genetically stable
over several generations is 50 %
higher than that of the original plants.
In Moldavia, irradiation of winter
wheat at various, stages of develop¬
ment has produced 5-6 per cent of
photomutants. Some of these were
strains with a shorter and stronger
stalk and a larger protein content in
the grain. These plants have annually
produced genetically identical offspring
for five or six generations.
After soya beans had been sub¬
jected to pulse-light radiation for half
an hour a day throughout the veget¬
ative stage, photomutants were
obtained which ripen three to four
weeks earlier than their predecessors.
The fact that these plants remain gen¬
etically stable through six generations
while continuing to produce the initial
crop of 30 quintals per hectare shows
that plant breeders have something
new to work on here.
Poplar buds given radiation while
growing produced a coarser type of
pollen. Seedlings pollinated with this
grow better in their first year or two
of life, which could be very important
for forestry in semi-arid regions.
Lastly, Dr. C. V. Moraru, working in
Moldavia, has managed, by irradiating
winter wheat throughout the summer
period during the hours when the sun
is high in the sky and sunlight is at
its most intense, to produce photo-
mutants which are genetically stable
for ten generations.
Such photomutants are now being
carefully studied and are being tried
out in the fields and in plant gen
eticists' laboratories, where they will
be used for further selective breeding.
Thousands of acres in Moldavia are
being sown with a photomutant strain
of wheat to obtain selected seeds.
This high-grade wheat has already pro¬
duced thousands of quintals of grain.
Thus, by using the concentrated rays
of the sun, man is now able to alter
and improve agricultural crops and to
produce new, heavy-cropping varieties.
At the same time, the overall problem
of changing the genetic characteristics
of agricultural plants by means of light
is still a new and very difficult one.
All we have done is to make a
successful start, to take the first steps
to prove that solar energy can be
used by man to transform plants by
acting on their genetic characteristics.
Since plant life depends on sunlight
and is controlled by genes and since
the sun and the genes together are
the motive forces of agriculture, it is
to be hoped that this new science of
"photo-energetics" will be instrumental
in improving the productivity of agri¬
culture.

### 50194: Solar energy claims a new place in the sun: on every continent, domestic heating and lighting units, water pumps, desalting stills, refrigerators are running on solar energy

SOLAR ENERGY CLAIMS
A NEW PLACE IN THE SUN (Continued from page 26)
National Science Foundation to study
solar energy has looked at this pro¬
posal quite favourably. It could find
no strong social objections although
it did see a problem in land costs.
Then it cited a number of other ways
to achieve a similar conversion of
sunshine into a fuel that can be used
at any time. In many cases, the end-
product Is hydrogen, a clean fuel that
is easy to transport. It could be pro¬
duced, for example, by using the
photosynthetic apparatus of green
plants or blue-green algae.
Another useful gas, methane, can be
manufactured by letting bacteria go to
work on solid wastes. There is nothing
new here; many sewage treatment
plants already meet their own power
requirements with the gases they
generate.
An even older process, charcoal-
burning, appears in the NSF/NASA
report under the much more alluring
name of pyrolysis. This is destructive
distillation carried out in an atmosphere
void of oxygen. It breaks organic
wastes down into liquid, solid or
gaseous fuels and, so the panel thinks,
the U.S. could meet one per cent of
its oil requirements in this way alone.
w,
40
ATER is a cheap way to
gather solar energy with a cost per
square metre infinitely lower than that
of mirrors or the so-called selective
surfaces that absorb more heat than
they radiate. It is used in the so-called
solar pond developed about fifteen
years ago by Dr. Harry Tabor, head of
the National Physical Laboratory of
Israel.
The first pond was about 600 square
metres in area. It measured a metre
deep with a blackened base. When
filled with layers of water In which
salt has been dissolved, the denser
bottom layers are heated without any
convection occuring. So the heat stays
down at the bottom where it can be
drawn off and used to run a turbine
while the sun pours more heat onto
the surface. Interest in this principle
is being awakened with the rising cost
of fossil fuels.
Most tempting of all is the possi¬
bility of using the ocean as a gigantic
collector of solar energy to be had
for the asking. Some forty years ago,
a French scientist, Georges Claude,
suggested that the difference between
the temperature of the ocean's surface
and its depth about 20°C in certain
tropical areas could be used to run
a heat engine.
His idea was demonstrated on a
bay in Cuba where 22 kilowatts of
power were generated but then it
was allowed to become dormant
when the discoveries of new fields
staved off an oil shortage that was a
threat even forty years ago. Today,
the NSF/NASA panel wants to wake
up this idea.
Another way to use the sea was
suggested at the congress by Dr. Ali
Kettani of the College of Petroleum
and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. He
wants to harness solar evaporation to
perform the apparently impossible feat
of generating hydro-electric power in a
country with neither rainfall or mount¬
ains.
How? Look at a map of Saudi
Arabia. Its coastline is dented by the
Dawhat Salwah, a small gulf 6,000
square kilometres in area. Quatar lies
across the Dawhat from Dahran, and
the island of Bahrain is in the middle,
forming a stepping-stone for a pro¬
posed series of dams.
Once the Dawhat Salwah had been
shut off from the open sea, it would
receive no new water to replace what
it loses by evaporation in one of the
world's hottest climates. After three
or four years, Dr. Kettani calculates,
the level of the gulf would fall by
thirteen metres. That would be enough
of a head to run a "helio-hydro-electric"
plant producing 300 million kilowatt-
hours per year.
"Scientists should think big", he told
the congress, "Theoretically, enough
sun falls on 5 per cent of the area of
the United States to generate all
the electricity that the United States
will need in the year 2000. But I'm
sceptical about covering 40,000 square
kilometres with solar cells. I try to
avoid the problem of solar cells by us¬
ing open areas of the sea to transform
solar energy into electricity. This is a
dam in a reverse and we are now
investigating evaporation rates in
Saudi Arabia to determine its feasi¬
bility."
He pointed out that other economic
benefits could be expected from a
Dawhat Salwah complex. Water on
the lower side of the dam could be
turned into a brine from which such
highly-prized minerals as magnesium
and bromine could be extracted.
Kettani estimates that it would cost
$150,000,000 to carry out his project
but it would bring in between fifty and
sixty million dollars a year. And, not
least of all in his view, it could
conserve oil, the treasure of Saudi
Arabia.
This would be a change from the
present state of affairs but, if the
omens at the congress are right, our
whole world may be turned topsy¬
turvy. Homes that are cheap to build
but costly to run because they eat
great quantities of fuel could become
obsolete, giving way to houses that
hoard the sun's energy collected on
their roofs.
Fred Dubin, a New York consulting
engineer who spoke at the congress,
is a long-time apostle of energy con¬
servation. He estimates that about
40 per cent of the energy Americans
consume goes for heating, cooling,
ventilation, lighting and power sys¬
tems in buildings. Proper design could
cut energy consumption in new build¬
ings by up to 50 per cent and in old
ones by around 20 per cent.
"When the architect, for God knows
what reasons, produced glass boxes
with inoperable sashes and sheer wall
surfaces without solar control, the
engineers dutifully provided lots and
lots of air-conditioning using lots and
lots of power", Dubin has written.
Then Americans could save another
40 to 75 per cent of the power they
now use in buildings if they turned to
solar energy to heat and cool offices.
This does not hold true just for sunny
California but also in a chilly New
England climate at Manchester, New
Hampshire, where Dubin is planning
an office building.
HE very shape of com¬
munities would change if energy came
not only from mines, refineries or
power plants but also from the sky.
Solar energy could bring about the
sort of revolution wrought by steam or
electricity when they were introduced.
A hint of this came in a paper
presented to the congress by Prof.
J. K. Page of the University of
Sheffield (United Kingdom). He also
took a swipe at modern architects for
introducing the worst features of
European design into developing
countries. Glass-walled buildings In
hot climates demand air-conditioning
that takes electric power away from
industry. "It's a case of bad archi¬
tecture slowing the industrialization of
nations", he said.
Prof. Page sees the distinction being
wiped out between town and country.
Already, factory farming has created
"animal cities" and even "animal
slums" in the countryside. The next
step is to bring the country into the
city. He wants to use sunshine falling
on buildings to grow plants on their
roofs. Carbon dioxide and moisture
generated by their inhabitants could
be fed up to the gardens on the roof
to speed plant growth.
And, during their lunch hours, office
workers could relax in these gardens
where city and country would be
combined without the lemming-like rush
of commuter migrations.

Calder, the British science writer. This
is the first time since it was founded in
1951 that the Kalinga Prize, awarded by
an international jury chosen by Unesco,
has been shared by two winners. Nigel
Calder is also the first son of a Kalinga
Prize winner to follow in his father's
footsteps. The prize for 1960 was award
ed to Lord Ritchie Calder. Dr Abelson,
editor of "Science" since 1962, is also
president of the Carnegie Institute in
Washington. Nigel Calder was editor of
the British weekly "New Scientist" from
1962 to 1966 and is widely known for
his books and TV programmes on science.
1974 is World
Population Year
The United Nations has designated 1974
as World Population Year to mobilize
world-wide public opinion and concern
about population growth and bring a better
understanding of the basic demographic
problems facing our planet
Focal point of World Population Year
will be the convening by the U.N. of the
first global intergovernmental conference
on population to be held in August, in
Bucharest, Romania.
The world's population in mid-1973
was over 3,800 million. If growth conti¬
nues at the present rate (2 % a year)
the 8,000 million mark would be reached
in less than four decades.
More than half the world's people,
about 2,100 million, live in Asia. Europe
(excluding the U.S.S.R.) has 466 million,
Africa 354 million, N. America 327 million,
S. America 195 million and Oceania
20 million.
The Fed. Rep. of Germany has the
lowest birth rate in the world (12.8 per
thousand) and Swaziland the highest
(52.3 per thousand).
The world's five most populous coun¬
tries are China (787 million), India (550
million), U.S.S.R. (245 million) U.S.A.
(207 million) and Indonesia (125 million).
If the world does not slow down its
rate of population growth, a child born
today, living until his seventies, may know
a world of 15,000 million. His grandson
may share the planet with 60,000 million

Letters to the Editor
MUSIC, MAESTRO, PLEASE
Sir,
Your issue "Music of the Centuries"
(June 1973) was most Impressive. Why
not devote more issues to music? We
all need to learn more about this rich,
mysterious, and ancient form of commu¬
nication.
Those who want to study music
seriously are often set apart by so¬
ciety. In Brazil especially, few families
accept or encourage the idea of a
musical vocation, considered by most as
a "passport to starvation". Yet a posi¬
tive counter current to this mistaken
idea seems to be gaining impetus at
the Ministry of Education and Culture,
and among the authorities in some
Brazilian states such as my own, Ceará.
But the attitudes of many generations
cannot be changed overnight.
I am happy to say that in Brazil the
"Unesco Courier" is reaching an ever-
wider public. As for future issues,
why not publish one on "Pop" music
or on Musicotherapy, or perhaps on
Ethnomusicology?

SCHOOLROOM WEATHERMEN
Sir,
Your special issue on meteorology,
"Unlocking the Secrets of Tomorrow's
Weather" (August-September 1973),
became the basis of a fascinating series
of classroom activities for my pupils.
These included the building of a mini
weather station, the study of different
types of clouds and the drawing up of
a world map showing locations of
climatic disasters.

POINT OF NO RETURN
Sir,
After reading "The Myth of Ecological
Equilibrium", by Miguel A. Ozorio de
Almeida, in your January 1973 issue, we
wish to protest against the general tone
of this "reassuring" article which tries
to make the most eminent ecologists
out to be prophets of doom and sensa¬
tion-mongers. What disaster must strike
us before we wake up to the peril facing
us 7 How can serious and authoritative
conclusions be dismissed as "a lamen¬
tably short-sighted interpretation of
trends"?
The despoliation of nature stems from
the prestige attaching to numbers and
quantity (as opposed to quality). That
such a childish outlook can still be used
as a guideline should provide an object
lesson in humility for our civilization.
Whether we like it or not, natural
resources are limited. The dangers that
M. de Almeida treats so lightly increase
a little every day.
While developed and developing
countries engage in a fruitless exchange
of mutual recriminations, phytoplankton
is disappearing from the oceans, the
seas are being transformed into sewers,
coastline and forest are being buried
under concrete and asphalt, animal spe¬
cies become extinct, parasites proliferate
and men multiply. Error piled upon
error, trifling, though they may be, are
leading us towards suicide. Are we so
afraid that we cannot face up to the
truth? Either we must act immediately
we have ten to twenty years before
we reach the point of no return or we
shall perish.

FAMILY FAVOURITE
Sir,
I wait Impatiently for the "Unesco
Courier" to arrive at our house. We
have been taking it for longer than I
can remember because my parents
and brothers are keen readers. It
interests me more than ever perhaps
because, now I am ten years old and
in the last class of primary school, I
can see that everything that teaches us
about education, science and culture
is important.
We children In Cuba think a lot about
the future and how we can learn more
and more so as to be of service to
the world at large. But we are also
interested in the past which makes up
the world's history. So I want to tell
you how much I enjoyed the special
supplement "Copernicus as told to
children" in your April 1973 issue. I
hope you will give us many other sup¬
plements as simply presented and as
Interesting as this one.

NICHOLAS ROERICH
CENTENARY
Sir,
This year marks the centenary of the
birth of Nicholas Roerich who devoted
his life to the ideal of bringing peace
between nations. Nicholas Roerich is
not only known as a great artist, but as
the originator and author of the "Pact
and Banner of Peace" which bears his
name. In 1935 the Pact was ratified by
the U.S. and all the Latin American
countries and later by other nations,
among them the U.S.S.R. and India.
The Nicholas Roerich Museum, in New
York, has a large permanent collection
of his paintings which will be augmented
in 1974 by special loan exhibitions, and
throughout the year various cultural
activities will be dedicated to celebrating
the centenary.

CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
Sir,
Your October 1973 issue ("Military
Service and Conscientious Objection"
page 31) does not make it clear that
France recognizes the status of
conscientious objector, giving the objec¬
tor the option of performing two years
of civilian service quite apart from tech¬
nical or other co-operation projects.
The law of 1963 allows young people to
refuse, on religious or philosophical
grounds, both military service and
assignment to the usual forms of co¬
operation projects. No such law applies
yet in Italy, but the question is currently
being debated in the Italian Senate.

BETTER LATE
THAN NEVER
Sir,
You probably receive many letters
praising the "Unesco Courier" and I
wish to add one more. However, I
have read some letters of complaints.
It is true that all the articles do not
interest everybody but that is not the
fault of the magazine.
Personally I find the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" an excellent magazine articles
written by experts and beautifully trans¬
lated, first-rate illustrations and the
whole excellently presented and printed.
Combining the intellectual with the
material, it is to my mind one of the
finest cultural magazines published.
I am only sorry I did not know about
it years ago.

ONLY ONE RACE
Sir,
Your October 1973 issue on Human
Rights was excellent. But why refer to
different "races"? If I were asked to
which race I belonged, I would say that
I was a member of the human race.
We all belong to the same race and are
therefore all equal. God clearly had
his reasons for giving us skin, hair
and eyes of various colours, but not
with the intention of giving some a
feeling of superiority or inferiority
towards others. So why continue to
use the word race to indicate differ¬
ences of colour between people when
they all belong to "the human race"?
If everyone would make an effort to
understand this, the world would have
fewer problems. If you developed this
theme perhaps this notion would take
root in the minds of millions and this
would be a great step forward in the
fight against racism.

sunbathing
Posing as the "nose" of a solar-faced "sundial" drawn on a beach, this young
woman basks in the warm rays of the suri. At a recent Unesco-sponsored
congress on "The Sun in the Service of Mankind", many scientists warned
against the dangers of overexposure to sunlight such as damaged eyesight,
burns, skin pigmentation disorders and even certain forms of cancerous skin
lesions. Certain substances used in the manufacture of some sun creams
and lotions, cosmetics, deodorants, soaps and toilet preparations may
dangerously increase the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and particularly
to ultra-violet rays from the sun (see page 36).
