AFRICAN HARP-STATUE
In this "harp statue" fashioned by a craftsman of the Mangbetu tribe in the
Valley of Uele, Northern Congo, aesthetic beauty has been combined with a
sense of musical harmony. The wooden resonance box is covered with skin and
the five strings are made of vegetable fibre. As the Mangbetu bard plays this
ancient instrument, it becomes, in a sense, a companion singer, embodying
in visual and symbolic form something of the human chant itself. (See p. 23).

CASE OF MISSING IDENTITY
by William
C. Kvaraceus
Nothing in the world troubles the adolescent as much as
the question of his own identity: how he sees himself
and how he feels the rest of the world sees him. He is strug¬
gling for "ego mastery." An American psychoanalyst. Dr. Erik
H. Erikson, has written: "...Identity consciousness means preoc¬
cupation between the self-image or images and one's appearance
in the eyes of others. The vanity and sensitivity of adolescents
belong here and also the apparent callousness to suggestions and
their lack of shame in the face of criticism... Adolescents, at
one time or another, for varying periods and with varying
intensity, suddenly decide to try and be exactly what some of
their elders do not want them to be... Young people, in extreme
conditions, may eventually find a greater sense of identity in
being withdrawn or in being delinquent than in anything else
society has to offer them."

### 78357: World side story, pt. 3: a case of missing identity
WORLD
SIDE STORY e
In our last issue we be¬
gan publication of a series
of articles on juvenile de¬
linquency. They present
the findings of a special
inquiry carried out for
Unesco by William C. Kva¬
raceus, Director of Youth
Studies at the Lincoln Fi-
lene Center for Citizenship
and Public Affairs of Tufts
University, Medford,
U.S.A. In this article the
author discusses the psy¬
chological aspects of soc¬
ial inadaptation and the
effects of new kinds of
relationships between
children and adults now
being brought about by
modern life.
Even a negative identity and more than one habitual
delinquent child has described himself as "plain mean"
can be satisfying. It can also be an expression of rebellion
on the part of the youngsters. Furthermore a youngster
may feel it Is better to have a negative self than no self
at all. For a negative Identity serves to ward off If not
entirely eradicate some of the doubts and confusion
about himself and how the world sees him.
Whether or not we accept the viewpoint and it ls not
exclusively a psychoanalytical theory that the child's
relationships with his parents may eventually result In
the kind of aggressions that we have labelled as delin¬
quency, there is little to be gained by denouncing the
faulty or inadequate family.
Parents who have failed their children are often persons
who have failed themselves and do not know It. In many
instances, particularly in certain milieux where there is
a higher degree of "broken" homes, parents have not
consciously decided to ignore or abuse their children.
Sometimes they are too busy trying to make a living,
sometimes they are helpless and cannot exert the right
control and very often they are ignorant of what they
might achieve as parents because no experience or rela¬
tionship in their own childhood gives them a good exam¬
ple or even a measurement.
It has been said that parents in a slum area do not
experience as many pleasures of family life as people In
a more prosperous stratum. They often have almost
nothing to share with their children except meals. But,
as a psychiatrist from a hospital in New York City once
said in referring to such families, "After all, who are these
parents in 'bad' homes? Poor, unhappy people them¬
selves."
But the most deficient parents are not necessarily always
among those who live in wretched buildings or in newly
erected standardized housing projects for low-income
groups. Juvenile delinquency appears to have Increased
in middle-class homes as well, and these are generally
richer, often calmer and more controlled. Hence there is
a growing belief that parents of both groups have much
less control or influence over their children than earlier
generations of parents.
The Inference ls not that parents care less about their
children or are too lazy or indifferent to give them gui¬
dance and discipline. One possible reason for the growing
lack of control is that many adults realize they can no
longer serve as the hero-models for their children.
A man born forty years ago, for example, has already
seen undreamed-of changes in his world; his son's future
will yield even more. The father's experiences and Judge¬
ment even his ideals may not be as meaningful and
crucial as they would be in more stable or predictable
times. If children can no longer look to their parents as
up-to-date models, no one knows it better than the adults.
Young people usually want and need parental models
either to Imitate or reject. When the parents are passive,
it ls impossible for the children to emulate them or rebel
against them. Few children might actively complain about
the increasing tolerance and permissiveness of their
parents but their behaviour often reflects their own Inner
confusion.
The possessive, domineering mother or the tyrannical
father are scarcely preferable, but one of the difficulties
undoubtedly affecting youngsters today ls that their
parents can no longer provide emotional yardsticks and
ideals for a future that ls more unpredictable than ever
before. When there are no clear boundaries in a child's
life, when the "rules" are never defined, when neither his
father nor his mother represent certain values and certain

WORLD SIDE STORY (Cont'd)
The need to be
'somebody'
commitments to life, It becomes harder for the child to
discover a true Image of himself and to set limits of
behaviour.
The inspector of Copenhagen's Child Welfare Directo¬
rate, N. H. Villen, has written of some parents: "they have
totally failed to offer their children any kind of guidance
suitable to their future life. One could illustrate this by
saying that adolescents are in no better position than a
human being from a primitive community who suddenly
finds himself transplanted into a highly Industrialized
society. It is easy to Imagine his feeling of helplessness
when faced with the Innumerable possibilities of choice
for which he was quite unprepared."
Mr. Villen also emphasized that children and young
people must be given the opportunity to experience the
feeling of being "somebody" who counts, of playing a
"role," of being of Importance.
Regardless of his nationality or his background, a child
may turn desperately to delinquency as an answer to his
problems. But delinquency ls not the inevitable behaviour
for an unhappy child seeking some form of reassurance.
The same child may relieve his own fears and anxieties
through neurotic behaviour. And although neurotic beha¬
viour and Juvenile delinquency sometimes overlap, they
are not Identical and not synonymous.
Juvenile delinquency in any form cannot be diagnosed
simply and solely as psychological maladjustment arising
from family disruptions. However, this can be one of the
many complex factors which Influence a child.
I NE of the hopeful, and yet one the puzzling,
aspects of trying to understand and help the
Juvenile delinquent are the many theories about the forces
that propel children. Not all of what the specialists say
may relieve us; some theories overlap while other theories
contradict each other. It is as though we were being
led to many windows and given a choice of many views,
each different and each revealing only one angle. But
only by seeing the problem of delinquency from these
different angles can we hope to discover new aspects that
might otherwise have escaped us. The teacher, the Judge
in a juvenile court, the anthropologist, the sociologist,
the psychologist, the social worker can all lead us to
different windows and ask us to look out.
We have considered the Interior forces that may shape
a child so crucially at the beginning of his life, but there
ls also the outside world which begins to intrude upon his
thoughts and feelings when he is very young. The family
may be the centre of gravity for a child but he Is never
immune to the world around him. There are many social
factors that touch upon a child's life and leave a deep
Imprint.
For example, a young person who grows up in a deprived
area learns certain kinds of behaviour as naturally and
normally as the middle-class boy learns exactly the oppo¬
site. It has even been suggested that the child of the
slums has a "tradition" to follow. A middle-class child
might be taught to fear poor marks in school, fighting,
cursing, and being rude to his teacher. But the slum child,
conversely, might fear doing well in school and being
friendly with his teacher, for this would set him apart
from the other children and possibly evoke their anger or
ridicule. He may even have been taught at home that
school ls a waste of time.
The middle-class child ls often taught, and put under
pressure, to divert all his ambitions Into getting good
marks and If he has strong aggressions he will often subli¬
mate them in achieving the goals his parents and society
hold dear. The slum child, all too often, learns that the

THE SLUM
Eight years ago the Tunisian Government
launched a large scale operation to care
for and rehabilitate children and adoles¬
cents who were without homes and
families and who, through poverty, the
disappearance of patriarchial traditions
and the lure to young people of life in
the cities, were living by all kinds of
dubious means. A series of "children's
villages" was created whose aim was
not only to provide a roof, food and
education, but also to restore the
children's confidence in themselves.
Though they were not necessarily young
delinquents, these children had become
used the uncontrolled freedom of life in
the streets. But thanks to the kind of
re-education that makes use of co-opera¬
tion rather than compulsion, they have
gradually been taught to accept the
normal standards of community life. Thus,
in their villages, at work and at play in their
small groups, these young "outcasts"
learn the advantages of freely accepted
discipline: security, friendship and a
sense of being part of the community.

WORLD SIDE STORY (Cont'd)
The lure of juvenile gangs
best way to express his aggressions ls with his fists, for he
has a completely different frame of reference.
It cannot be assumed that all deprived areas are Jungles
of violence or that a child cannot survive life in this sort
of neighbourhood without giving and taking many
beatings. What ls clearly shown In many scientific
research projects is that while deprived areas are never
the one and only cause for delinquency, they can provide
a different set of traditions which are unfamiliar to
outsiders.
The values a child learns from the social structure
surrounding him direct his behaviour and no matter how
dangerous these values are, they almost constitute a
legacy. The child may eventually replace or reject these
values, but he can rarely ignore them. Many children who
are exposed to values which almost encourage delinquency
do not automatically become delinquents. Others prove
more vulnerable.
HE community is the first world a child con¬
fronts. As he grows older, he may clearly see
the boundaries. The child who lives in an underprivileged
neighbourhood may often resent the limits that he feels
society has imposed. Because of his background and the
limitations of his life, he may become aggressive because
he ls frustrated. "Frustration aggressions," from the
sociologist's point of view, can mean being deprived of
legitimate means to achieve desired goals.
This may be illustrated through hundreds of case histor¬
ies. One example could be the boy who knows he will
never make enough money to buy the car he wants. It
may mean the child who knows that it is impossible for
him to attend college he may not even set this up as a
goal but what he resents is knowing and feeling that it is
a totally unrealistic ambition.
These are frustrations that society creates and they can
often be as disturbing as the frustrations that are
emotionally aroused by a lack of inner security. Both
types of frustrations, which so often lead to an explosion,
can result in behaviour that is defiant and destructive.
Sociologists and anthropologists, as well as many other
people, have clearly defined the difficulty which adoles¬
cents in a changing society especially male adolescents
must face In making the transition from behaving as a
child to behaving as an adult. In modern life, but depend¬
ing very much on the particular culture, the child Is
supposed to become emancipated from his parents' power.
But the exact time, the manner and the nature of such
emancipation ls uncertain and thus may become a source
of anger or dispute within the family.
Formerly, in India, China, Japan or Ireland, for exam¬
ple, the authority of the parent, for better or for worse,
continued until death. The end of a child's adolescence
did not mean a change in this authority. There was little
conflict: parents made all the decisions during their life¬
time and children abided by them.
Some primitive societies provide for the transition from
childhood to adulthood by puberty rites. Once an ado¬
lescent in such a culture has undergone this ceremony he
ls entitled to assume the status of manhood. His life has
been divided for him. Before the rite, he was a child,
after it, a man. Perhaps the child remains emotionally
confused but he has a far clearer idea of what is expected
of him.
Today, even in societies that once specified the moment
of manhood very precisely, there is no such distinct
passage. The role of the adolescent is ambiguous and
8 confused. The origin of the storm and stress in growing
up can often be found in each culture's definition of child¬
hood, adulthood or manhood. In many parts of the world,
the definition of manhood has become less and less clear.
The old Images of a man as a warrior and protector, the
sole provider of food and shelter, and the infallible father,
have become blurred.
We do not always agree on what "masculinity" means,
so it ls inevitable that many children, groping towards
manhood, reflect our confusion.
There are many ambivalences in the daily life of the
adolescent. Too often there is a confusing discrepancy
between what adults instruct him to do and what the
youngster himself sees them do. In one Instance, he may
be punished or threatened for telling a lie; at the same
time he is very much aware that his parents practise
small deceits themselves, and sometimes triumphantly,
as in the case of evading taxes or traffic fines. To the
child, therefore, it may often seem that there ls no real
right and wrong, only a great difference in what adults
can get away with and children cannot.
Sociologists, anthropologists and educators have traced
many complex problems in human behaviour to Intense
Industrialization and the resulting growth of big cities
or urbanization. There is a frightening freedom for people
who live in big cities, divorced from the traditional values
and familiar standards that shaped their lives. Very
often, they are anonymous and alone, cut off from the
familiar smaller society from which they came.
The word anomie, a condition first defined by the French
sociologist Emile Durkheim, means simply "without
norms" and refers to the breakdown in the traditional
order, to the default In "norms" and regulations based
on past authority. It has also been interpreted as meaning
the particular dilemma which occurs when people feel
there ought to be guidance and it Is lacking or when the
individual must cope with conflicting demands that cannot
be satisfied simultaneously.
Very often people who move to a big city, and even
those who have lived there for a long time, find themselves
living In a curious limbo. Sometimes, newcomers to a city
neighbourhood discover they are in the midst of a confu¬
sing, formless new culture which requires that they change
radically or else stick together and risk being identified as
an unwelcomed minority open to hostility or even attack.
The young are particularly vulnerable to anomie and in
many instances the juvenile gang is a comfort, a solution
and an escape. The gang at least offers a sense of
"belonging" and a set of meaningful values when nothing
else does.
SIDE from anomie, it has been pointed out
kvery often that an industrialized society, for
all its obvious benefits, brings hazards into our lives that
we often do not suspect or recognize. Sociologists have
made many studies of the type of work that consists
only of pressing buttons and pulling levers or switches,
throughout the entire working day, year after year. The
assembly line hardly offers a man a sense of joy or fulfill¬
ment In his work. He has no commitment, no sense of
achievement, no pride in craftsmanship and no sense of
social purpose. A farmer, a cabinet maker or a tailor
need not envy him.
For a young boy who can look forward only to many
years of this sort of monotony, delinquency can often
serve as the best and most exciting sort of protest against
a dreary and unacceptable future. The child who feels
this way might not even believe that an education could
prepare him for a more genuine or meaningful life. But
traditional formal education has become meaningless and
abstract to many pupils throughout the world.
A sociologist defined this feeling as follows: "Now with
formal learning available for nearly everyone, the rela¬
tion between schooling and future work ls at best indirect,
and at worst, completely incomprehensible. What do

Dalmas. Paris Through industrialization and the resulting growth of big cities many people today find them¬
selves divorced from their traditional values and familiar standards, and living in a curious limbo.
By banding together with other teen-agers, many young people find a sense of "belonging"
and a set of values however wrong some of these may be by normal community standards.
algebra, history and ancient languages have to do with
labour on the assembly line, salesmanship or the duties
of a housewife?"
Some children do understand that schooling can develop
them in many ways that will help them In their future
employment, but other youngsters cannot find any
meaningful link.
The creation of cities may often make life more bearable
for many people in some ways while depriving them in
different respects. An outstanding example of what may
happen when people are suddenly deprived of their tra¬
ditions is brought out in a report from one African coun¬
try that states: "An important factor in producing
'criminal behaviour' is culture conflict. This discontinuity
is seen in the movements of hundreds of thousands of
Bantus from their villages to the cities, where a new set
of physical and personal associations surround the
Individual. There is a breakdown In primary controls that
follows detriballzation with the introduction of cash
economy, accelerated mobility, personal anonymity and
leisure-time pursuits. Unaccustomed to making such com¬
plex decisions, the African commits some infractions as
he loses his way in the maze of laws and regulations."
When normal values and traditions break down, and
cannot be so easily replaced, let alone retained, it is often
the adolescents who feel the most stress. It has been said
that the social problem of one generation is a psycho¬
logical problem for the next.
In Japan, the taiyozuku are not the children of refugees
or the very poor, they have not been physically displaced
or asked to make the drastic adjustments that must face
many Africans. But their behaviour shows how much
they, too, are victims of change. Children of the wealthy
upper-class echelon, they frequently find little meaning in
life and no purpose except for their short-lived, impulsive
and often malicious pleasures. Much as their European
or American counterparts, they live for the moment.
One possible factor In their behaviour is the history of
Japan since the end of the Second World War. Here is a
country that has absorbed such a melange of Western
ideas and influences with so much speed that the revered
and stable concepts of behaviour have been threatened
and, in many families, discarded, even if not willingly.
Because there has been an unusual upheaval in Japan
and an upheaval of a very complex nature one of the
consequences ls the phenomena of Juvenile delinquency,
In a country where it was little known before. In the case
of societies undergoing modernization, It is often the rate
the degree of acceleration of these changes much more
than the changes themselves that has to be taken Into
account.
Understanding and appreciating the viewpoints of the
specialists on the subject of Juvenile delinquency, can lead
us to many conclusions. One should always be kept In
mind: delinquency is not one type of behaviour exclusively,
but rather a range of many types. There ls not one cause
for It but rather a sequence of interlocking factors in the
child's life that can provoke it. Different factors some¬
times can result In the same type of delinquent behaviour;
on the other hand, different kinds of delinquent beha¬
viour are often caused by the same factors.
The full report of the inquiry by Professor William
C. Kvaraceus will be published in a forthcoming Unesco 9
study "Juvenile Delinquency: A Problem for the Modern
World."

### 61954: Rebel with a cause
REBEL WITH A CAUSE
by
Dmitro
Pavlychko
One hundred and fifty years ago, the great Ukranlan poet and painter, Taras
Shevchenko, was born near Kiev (see "The Unesco Courier," July-August 1961).
Shevchenko gave his talents and his life to the cause of an oppressed people.
To commemorate Shevchenko's birth, "The Unesco Courier" tells on the following
pages the story of this poet of courage, and presents extracts from his poems, his
diary and his novel, "The Painter", and reproductions of some of his drawings and
paintings. Freed from serfdom at the age of 24, Shevchenko became a celebrated
portrait painter in St. Petersburg. But he never forgot the humiliations suffered
by the people of the Ukraine and in his poems he castigated the Czarist tyranny.
After ten years of exile in Central Asia he returned to St. Petersburg, where ho
died at the age of 47, In his lifetime only 17 of his poems were published. Today
translations have been made in 42 languages of more than 200 of his poems and
of his novel and these works are now known across the world.
It happened on April 25, 1838 In St. Peters¬
burg, in the home of Karl Brüllov, "the
prince of painters." A stocky youth, with
reddish hair, called Taras Shevchenko had
just received from the poet Zhukovsky a docu¬
ment for which the sum of 2,500 roubles had
been paid. It was an expensive piece of
crested paper on which the feudal lord, Engel-
hardt, had written: ". . . this man Shevchenko
is hereby free to choose whichever way of life
he wishes."
Until then Shevchenko had been Engle-
hardt's property, his serf, whom he had long
tried to turn into his lackey. But he failed,
for as Shevchenko wrote later: "To tame a
Cossack child is like trying to tame a fleet-
footed deer in the wilds of Lapland." Having
discovered a talent for painting in his re¬
bellious young Cossack, the feudal lord
apprenticed him to a despotic hack painter,
hoping thereby to acquire a household painter
of his own.
It so happened that the young man's talent
made a great impression on Karl Brüllov who,
with the help of several other Russian artists
and men of letters, raised the money to buy
Shevchenko's freedom. The price that was
paid 2,500 roubles was a staggering sum,
since according to reviews of that time forty
roubles would buy an entire family, Including
a skilled coachmaker.
"Whichever way of íife ... ?" Shevchenko
thought he had chosen his way of life long
ago, and forever. He had already chosen it
when, as a tattered and hungry orphan, he
wandered from one Ukrainian village to ano¬
ther in search of somebody who would teach
him to paint. Painting that was his aim in
life. And now, as he stood before the "divine"
Karl Brüllov, he already imagined himself a
student of the Academy of Fine Arts. He was
not even discouraged at the thought that the
great Brüllov had graduated from this Aca¬
demy at the age of 17, while he was already
twenty-four. Now at last he had gained
the freedom for which he had longed for so
many years and he felt that the prospects
open to a free man were boundless. This was
the happiest day In Shevchenko's life.
And yet this day also marked the beginning
of the tragedy that was to torment the future
poet throughout his Ufe. Shevchenko's per¬
sonal freedom always seemed to be In constant
conflict with the strongest of all his emo¬
tions his love for his own people, still living
in a state of slavery. An honest man cannot
feel free if his people continue to languish in
captivity. There can be no individual free¬
dom If that freedom is enjoyed by one man
alone.
This tragic conflict only became fully
apparent later when as a student Shevchenko
returned to the Ukraine In 1843 having mean¬
time tasted of all the Joys of a free life. How
he had changed during those fifteen years of
absence from his loved Ukraine! And the
Ukraine? She also had changed. She had
suffered bitterly during all those years and the
Czarist chains had eaten deeper into her flesh.
Shevchenko dedicated to the Ukraine his
first little book of poems, TheKobzar (1), which
was published in St. Petersburg In 1840. These
poems showed that Taras had never forgotten
his people. The memory of the Ukraine had
been constantly with him even amongst the
roofs of the capital which he painted while
"studying" with Shlrlayev (a guild-master of
painting and fresco decoration) and in
Brüllov's studio where, instead of making
drawings of Greek gods, he wrote poems about
Ukrainian maidens and rebels and about
"what happened In the Ukraine In bygone
days."

them to the great struggle for freedom. And
so Shevchenko the romantic became Shev¬
chenko the realist.
In St. Petersburg in 1844 he wrote an
explosive poem, The Dream, powerful enough
to shake the palaces of the mighty on the
Neva embankment. The Dream was Shev¬
chenko's first truly revolutionary poem. It
expresses all his innermost feelings and
convictions: his grief as a Ukrainian, the indig¬
nation of his social conscience, his love of life
and the caustic bitterness of a man who prefers
death to slavery.
No one, before or after Shevchenko, has
drawn so complete and true a picture of the
Russian Empire of the czars as he, no one
has ridiculed as he did Its mendacious and
sham magnificence or penetrated so deeply
Into the hearts of the enslaved peasant masses
and the minds of the city slum-dwellers. No
one had spoken so simply and sincerely in
their name. Shevchenko tore the shroud of
hypocrisy from the Russian monarchy, and
revealed exploitation, and lawlessness, vice and
chauvinism, stupidity and falsehood.
We know that many writers tried to strike
a death blow at the regime. But no one has
succeeded so well as Shevchenko:
"I watch: the czar comes close
To him who ls of highest rank
And whops him on the nose! . . .
Poor fellow, he just licked his lips
And poked him right in the pot
The next in line! . . . Then that one gave
A smaller fish a clout;
That one punched still a smaller fish,
And hestill smaller fry,
Until the smallest at the end
Got theirs and opened wide
The palace gates, and poured outside
Into the city streets
To put the boots to common folks;
Then those began to screech
And holler fit to wake the dead:
'Our little father deigns to play!
Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray !'
I laughed out loud, and that was all;
I own, in the melee
I too got banged."
Shevchenko Indeed "got banged": he was
sentenced to ten years' exile.
Though by no means the first of his country's
notable writers, Shevchenko was certainly the
true founder of Ukrainian literature; under his
pen the full wealth of the Ukrainian language
and Its every nuance find expression in works
that speak of universal Ideals.
The full breadth of Shevchenko's vision is
apparent in one curious episode of his life.
Having returned from exile and being impa¬
tient to begin serious work again, he was
preparing his tryptlch Fate, The Muse and
Glory. He then met, at the beginning of 1858,
in the salon of Count Feodor Tolstoy, an
American Negro tragedian, Ira Aldridge, who
was on a theatrical tour in St. Petersburg.
The two men soon became almost insep¬
arable friends. In the evenings Shevchenko
would visit Aldridge in his dressing room at
the theatre and, in the afternoon, the actor
would sit for his portrait in Shevchenko's
wretched little room.
This brief but moving friendship between a
man who had been a serf in his youth and
another who had belonged to an enslaved race
was Itself a simple everyday expression of the
great human ideals that inspired the struggle
of the Ukrainian poet who wrote:
"Will justice for man ever come? It must, it
[must.
The sun will rise and scorch all evil,
And then the dawn will come."
Right, "Council of the Elders" in a Ukrainian village
(etching, 1844). Below, the central, seated figure
in the same group. All Shevchenko's artistic work is
filled, as are his poems, with his affection for the
Ukraine. He painted the beauty of its vast landscapes,
depicted its ancient customs and expressed his hatred
of the tyranny to which his people were subjected.

NLY feeble minds live on hope", said the late
Goethe. But the words spoken by the wise
Gcethe are only partly true. Hope is a characteristic of all
minds, the mediocre and the great alike, and even of the
most realistic, down-to-earth minds. Hope is our nurse and
the most affectionate and constant of lovers, faithful to the
end. It flatters the credulous imagination of the all-powerful
czar and the famous sage, of the impoverished labourer and
of someone as poor and wretched as myself; and it lulls our
doubting minds to sleep by recounting wonderful fairy-tales
which all of us believe spontaneously (though not
unconsciously).
It is indeed a feeble mind which believes that pears can
grow on willow-trees. Yet why should I not believe that I

have yet to visit, and that 1 wiii go to the opera, the resplen¬
dent, entrancing opera.
Oh, how sweet it is to believe in such a marvellous future.
I would be no more than a cold and unfeeling atheist if I
did not believe in hope, this wonderful, spell-binding god.
Here is how I have decided to arrange my life, with my
friends' help, of course. First of all I must no longer think
about painting. To do so would be like believing that pears
grow on willow trees. Already, in the past, I was never an
outstanding painter, and thus even less so today. The
greatest virtuoso may become a common or garden bala¬
laika player if he lets ten years go by without practising
his art. So I had better give up any idea of painting.
I hope, though, to devote myself entirely to engraving.
I believe that to achieve this goal I must limit my daily needs
to strict essentials and concentrate entirely on the study of
this art. Meanwhile I will make sepia copies of famous
works for future engravings. I think that two years' study
will be enough.
Next, I will return to my beloved Ukraine where life is so
pleasant, and there I will start work on my engravings. The
first will be "The Barracks", after Teniers. My immortal
Master, the great Karl Brüllov, said that people would
willingly come all the way from America just to glimpse
that masterpiece. And you can rely on the judgement of a
great man like Brüllov.
I now prefer engraving to all other fine arts. And not
without reason. A good engraver spreads what is educa¬
tional and beautiful throughout the community. His work is
of value to men and pleasing to God. The engraver's is the
finest and noblest calling that exists. How many works of
art which are only accessible to the rich would moulder in
little-known galleries were it not for the engraver's mira¬
culous needle: a divine calling indeed.

| n 1847 Taras Gregorevlch Shevchenko was thir¬
ty-three years old. Some time had elapsed
since he had passed from serfdom to freedom and from
obscurity to fame. His future was now assured; but his
nature was such that he could not accept the prospect of
his own personal success while an endless horizon of
misery and slavery faced the people of Kirillovka and
Mornltz (the villages where he was born and raised) and
beyond them, the inhabitants of countless other, villages
and towns throughout the Ukraine and perhaps even
beyond the frontiers of Ukraine itself.
He could not abide the thought that those he loved
should continue to suffer the degradation he himself had
known during his childhood. He Joined a secret revolu¬
tionary group and animated Its members with the im¬
passioned poems of sedition which poured from his pen.
Seized and arrested, he soon found himself Impounded
into the army as a private and shipped off in exile to the
far-off military fortresses beyond the Urals in central Asia.
Before turning this page, let me pause, here for a
moment to try to visualize the effect of such an event on
the mature and celebrated figure that Shevchenko had
become. He had achieved what had once seemed to him
an Impossible dream by graduating from the Academy of
Fine Arts; he was an habitué of the notable salons of
St. Petersburg, a poet and a painter. Suddenly there he
was thrust Into the ruthless, brutal world of the army and
the mire and filth of military barracks.
"A child shaped like a cube." This was the strange
phrase Shevchenko once applied to himself. At the
present moment in his life he seems not only to have the
hard form of a cube but, carved as it were in an adaman-
. tine, unpliable substance, its rock-like solidity as well. He
appears as stubborn now as he was in his early childhood
when he would trek across the Ukrainian countryside till
he dropped with fatigue or sleep in order to reach the
pillars of iron, behind the mountain, which propped up
the sky. Not only had he tumbled back Into servitude and
isolation after only a brief interlude of happiness and
Independence but by order of Czar Nicolas I he was
forbidden either to write or paint one of the most Ignoble
forms of tyranny and oppression against artistic and
literary creation.
For Shevchenko the order to abandon brush and pen was
well-nigh unbearable but at least he was never forced to
paint or write in glorification of a regime which persecut¬
ed him. In any event he soon began to write again in
secret.
The following year, 1848, the Russian general, A.I. Buta-
kov set about equipping a large scientific expedition to
%
explore the flora and fauna of the Aral Seaa vast though
not very deep expanse of salt water set in the midst of the
desert. Because of his skill at drawing Shevchenko was
asked to join the expedition. Soon one thousand five
hundred horse-drawn wagons called telegas were crossing
the Kara Kum wastelands. They carried everything
needed including a dismantled schooner.
I can well Imagine what that month-long journey must
have been like; men struggling against such heavy sand¬
storms that young faces rapidly developed the furrows of
old age. On the dunes which stretched ahead like ocean
waves, on the brain-like, coral-like sinuosities, nothing
grew but sedge and wormwood, dwarf . saxifrage and
desert acacia, an armour-plated vegetation, tough, thorny
and hostile.
Yet when the waters of the melting snow receded there
was a brief multicoloured explosion of swift budding tulips
and sudden poppies. It is not hard to picture the
unexpected delight which these short-lived flowers,
blossoming in the barren landscape, brought to the
painter, to the poet exiled far from the green banks of
the gentle Dnieper where for so long the land had belong¬
ed to man that it undulated with the burial mounds rising
over his bones.
Sketches and water-colours followed one another in

Sunset on the edge of the Aral Sea. This water-colour was painted by Shevchenko on September 25, 1848, in the
camp of the scientific expedition which he accompanied to the Aral Sea. Shevchenko recorded the desolate scenery of

Beneath an unwashed sky
The sullen waves sleep on
And though no wind stirs
Far off, above the shore
Rushes bob and sway
As if in a tipsy dance
How much longer must I wither
By this sombre, dismal sea?
Though the faded grass is silent
On the steppe it bows and bends
Like a feeling, living soul
But the withering grass won't talk
It will never tell the truth
And there's no one here, except the grass
To be questioned on our fate.
TARAS SHEVCHENKO
Shevchenko In exile. I do not even know if they have all
been preserved or If many of them have been lost. No
matter. I like to think that we owe to him the first
picture of the rare salmon found only in the Aral Sea,
or that of the elegant cardlum, a heart-shaped shell-nsh
which, by who knows what mysterious way, left the
Mediterranean to proliferate In this land-locked lake.
During the winter on the island of Kos-Aral, Shevchenko
wrote poem after poem. Many of his most powerful and
original verses were written there. Then, at Orenburg
and Novopetrov, even though he was once more subject to
the harshest conditions, came his best prose works,
especially his Diary.
No sign of despair ever appears in its pages. I believe
that when on August 2 1859, he left Novopetrov, he was
happy not only because he was returning home, but also
because be had turned adversity and solitude into a rich
human experience.
Even when conditions were most trying he refused to
be discouraged. Instead he simply turned out more and
more work. With his drawings of cliffs and hills and a
thousand sketches of various kinds he contributed in his
way, at the distant end of the earth to which tyranny had
exiled him and because an enlightened general gave him
a chance, to the advancement of a science which must
certainly have seemed strange and foreign to him, namely,
geography. One cannot always choose the alphabet of
one's message.
A philosopher has observed that man would not today
be what he is had not his caveman ancestor determined
to bequeath to his descendants a better world than the
one he had Inherited. Every generation is in the same
situation and Is subject to the same unspoken law. In
Shevchenko, we honour not only the painter and the poet
but also one of the resolute pioneers who have truly
understood this prime and permanent duty of man.

Where people weep their whole life through
You'd not compose your rhapsodies
And God for nothing you'd not praise
And mock our tears and twit the truth.
The tranquil cottage in the grove
You call a paradise, I know.
In such a cottage once I dwelt
And there my first hot tears were spilt,
My early tears! I know no vice,
No wrong nor evil anywhere
That's not within that cottage fair...
And yet they call it paradise!
I do not speak of that wee house
Beside the village, by the copse,
As though 'twere paradise on earth.
'Twas there my mother gave me birth
And, singing as her child she nursed,
She passed her pain to me... 'Twas there,
In that wee house, that Eden fair,
That I saw hell... There people slave
Without a let-up night and day.
Not even given time to pray.
In that same village to her grave
My gentle mother, young in years,
Was laid by toil and want and cares.
There father, weeping with his brood
(And we were tiny, tattered tots),
Could not withstand his bitter lot
And died at work in servitude!...
And we we scattered where we could
Like little field mice. I to school
To carry water for the class.
My brothers slaved on the estate
And then, conscripted, marched away!
And you, my sisters! Fortune has
Reserved for you the cruellest fate!
What is the purpose of your life?
Your youth in service slipped away,
Your locks in servitude turn grey,
In service, sisters, you will die!
My blood runs cold when I recall
That cottage in the village fair!

### 62094: Encounter on a summer night: extract from Shevchenko's novel "The Painter"
ENCOUNTER
ON A SUMMER NIGHT
Extract from Shevchenko's novel "The Painter ft
In 1856 while exiled to the for¬
tress of Novopetrovsk on the
Caspian Sea, Shevchenko
wrote a novel entitled "The
Painter". It was a largely au¬
tobiographical work and des¬
cribed how a young serf with
ambitions to become an artist
finally won his freedom, as
did Shevchenko, helped by
the painter, Karl Brüllov and
the poet Vassili Zhukovsky.
The following extract from
"The Painter" is taken from
"Taras Shevchenko-Selec-
tions", translated by John
Weir, and published by "The
Ukrainian Canadian", 1961.
IN St. Petersburg I nearly always pass the summer nights out on the street
or somewhere on the islands, or more often yet, on the riverside walk.
Especially do I like the place where the Neva is calm and like a gigantic
mirror reflects to the tiniest detail the majestic portico of the Rimiyantsev
Museum, a corner of the Senate and the scarlet curtains in the home of
Countess Laval.
In the long winter nights the dwelling is lit up inside and the scarlet
curtains flame like a fire against the dark background, and I urn always
annoyed that the Neva is then covered with ice and snow and therefore the
decoration loses its true effect.
In the summertime I also like to meet the sunrise on Troitsky Bridge. A
marvellous, majestic picture.
In a genuinely artistic painting there is something that is more charm¬
ing and beautiful than nature itself the uplifted spirit of the artist, his
divine creativeness. On the other hand, there arc such wonderful phenomena
in nature before -which the poet-artist hows to the earth and can only give
thanks to the Creator for such a thrilling moment of rapture.
I often admire Shchedrin's landscapes (1) and especially was I captivated by
his small painting, "'Portichi Before Sunset." A fascinating work! But it
has never fascinated me so much as does the view of Vihorg from Troitsky
Bridge just before sunrise.
One time, having enjoyed to the brim this picture, which was not painted
by the hand of man, I walked over to the Summer Gardens for a rest. When¬
ever I happen to he in the Summer Gardens, I never stop on any of the alleys
which are ornamented with marble statues: those statues make the worst
kind of impression on me, especially the ugly Saturn gobbling up his equally
hideous offspring. I always pass by those clumsy gods and goddesses and
sit down to rest beside a pool from where I can admire the beautiful granite
vase and the majestic architecture of the Mikhaïlovsky castle.
Nearing the place where the main alley is crossed by a smaller one, and
where Saturn, surrounded by gods and goddesses, is depicted devouring his
child, I almost 6tumbled over a living person in a soiled smock of twill who
was sitting on a bucket directly opposite Saturn.
I halted. The boy (for he was really hut a lad of fourteen or fifteen) look¬
ed around and began to hide something inside his shirt-front. I came closer
and asked what he was doing there.
"I'm not doing anything," he replied bashfully. "Tin on my way to work
and I stepped into the park on the way." Then, after a moment's silence,
he added: "I was drawing."
"Show me what you drew."
He pulled out a quarto of grey stationery from his shirt-front and shyly
handed it to me. On the sheet the outline of Saturn had been copied quite
faithfully.
I held the drawing in my hands for a long time and feasted my eyes on
the smudged face of the author. There was something attractive in his thin,

was named by Shevchenko. A

the money needed to buy Shev¬

Shevchenko expressed all the
admiration he felt for Karl Brüllov
in his novel, "The Painter".
irregular features, especially in his eyes, which were intelligent and meek
as a maiden's.
"Do you often come here to draw?" I asked him.
"Every Sunday," he answered, "and if we happen to he working close hy,
I come on weekdays too."
"You are training for a house painter?"
"Also fine painting," he added.
"To whom are you apprenticed?"
"To Shirayev, the mural painter."
I wanted to question him in greater detail, but he picked up the bucket
with yellow paint in one hand and a large yellow brush that had been wiped
dry in the other and started to leave.
"Where are you hurrying so?"
"To work. I'm late already and when the master comes, I'll catch it."
"Come to see me Sunday morning, and if you have any drawings you did
yourself, bring them to show me."
"Fine, I'll come, but where do you live?"
I wrote my address down right on bis drawing and we parted.

### 62094: Encounter on a summer night: extract from Shevchenko's novel "The Painter"
Early on Sunday morning I returned from an all-night promenade and in
the hallway before the door of my apartment I was met by my new acquain¬
tance, no longer in a soiled smock of twill but in something resembling a
frock-coat of a brown colour, and with a roll of paper in his hand.
I greeted him and extended my hand to him. He sprang to my hand
'and attempted to kiss it. I snatched away my hand: I was
embarassed by his slavishness. Without a word I went into my apartment
while he remained in the hallway. I took off my coat, put on a smock, lighted
a cigar, and he still hadn't entered the room. I walked out in to the corridor
and looked about, but my friend had disappeared; I went downstairs and
asked the caretaker whether he had seen such a person. "I saw him," said
he, "a young fellow with papers in his hand, he ran out to the street."
I went out to the street but found no trace of him.
A sadness came upon me as though I had lost something dear to me. I
was dispirited all week until the following Sunday and couldn't figure out
what the sudden flight of my friend could have meant. When Sunday arriv¬
ed at last, I went to Troitsky Bridge at two o'clock in the morning and after
enjoying the sunrise I went to the Summer Gardens, traversed all the
alleys but my friend was nowhere about.
I was on the point of going home when I iemembered the Belvedere Apollo,
that is, the parody of the Belvedere god that stands by itself right beside
Moika street. I went there and there was my friend. Seeing me, he stopped
drawing and blushed to the ears like a child caught stealing cookies. I took
him by his trembling hand and led him like an offender to the pavilion
and in passing ordered the tavern waiter to bring us tea.
I showed my friend all the kindness I knewr bow and when he calmed
down I asked him why he bad run away from the hallway.
"You were angry with me and I got scared," he replied.
"To be angry with you was the farthest from my mind," I told him, "but
your grovelling was unpleasant to me. Only a dog licks hands, a human
being should not do it." This strong expression so affected my friend that
he seized my hand again. I laughed and he turned red as a lobster and stood
silent with his head bowed.
After drinking our tea we parted. At parting I told him that he must call
on me without fail either this very day or next Sunday.
I have seen my new acquaintance only three times and already I am drawn
to him, I have become attached to him, I have developed a liking for him.
And truly, there is something in his features that you can't help liking. Hi?
physiognomy, which seemed homely at first, as time went on appeared more
and more attractive. After all, there are such fortunate faces on the earth!
I went directly home so that my friend shouldn't have to wait in the
hallway. I walked up the stairs and there he was already, in that same brown
frock-coat, washed, combed and smiling.

"You're quite the nimble-foot," I said, "for you stopped over at your
quarters on the way, didn't you? How did you manage to do it so quickly?"
"Well," he answered, "I hurried to be home when the master returned
from Mass."
"Why, is your master strict?" I inquired.
"Strict and..."
"And cruel, is that what you meant to say?"
"No, I was going to say that he is a skinflint. He would beat me but actually
be would be glad that I was too late to have dinner."

### 62094: Encounter on a summer night: extract from Shevchenko's novel "The Painter"
We entered the room. On my easel was a copy I had «lone of a painting
by Velasquez that was on exhihition at the Slroganov Gallery, and li is eyes
fastened on it. I took the roll from his hands and began to inspect it.
Everything that disfigures the Summer Gardens was there, from the sacchar-
inely smiling goddesses to the hideous "Phraclitus" (1) and Hcraclitus.
What struck me about these not-at-all-poor outlines was their remarkable
similarity to the originals, especially the sketches of "Phraclitus" and Ilera-
clitus. They were more expressive and, truth to tell, uglier than the originals,
but nevertheless you couldn't look at the drawings without being moved.

I was glad at heart over my discovery. At that time the idea didn't even
come to my mind to ask myself what I would do with my diamond in the
rough in view of my more than limited resources. Actually, the thought did
cross my mind even then, hut was immediately set aside with the proverb:
"God is not without mercy, and a Cossack is not without luck."
"Why don't you have a single drawing with shadings?" I asked, returning
the roll to him.
"I drew all those sketches early in the morning, before sunrise."
"So you have never seen them in the light?"
"I've gone to look at them in the daytime, but you can't draw then, with
the people walking about."
"What do you intend to do now: stay and have dinner with me, or go
home?"
He was silent for a minute and then, without lifting his eyes, said almost
indistinctly:
"I would rather stay, if you'll let me."

"Then let's go to dinner."
When we arrived there were as yet no customers at Madame Yurgens' place,
of which I was very glad because it would have been annoying to have some
smoothfaced bureaucrat smirking stupidly as he eyed my friend who was far
from being a dandy.
After dinner I had intended to take him to the Academy and show him
"The Last Day of Pompeii," not everything at once. After we had dined,
however, I proposed that we either take a promenade on the boulevard or
read a hook. He chose the latter and I made him read aloud in order to test
him in that subject. I fell asleep as he read the first page of Dickens' famous
novel "Nicholas Nicklehy," hut neither the author nor the reader were to
blame for this I simply couldn't say awake because I hadn't slept the
previous night.
When I awoke and went into the next room, my usually chaotic study
appeared pleasant to the eye: there were no cigar butts or tobacco ashes
anywhere to be seen, everything was tidied up and swept clean, even the
palette, which hung on a nail with dried paints on it, was cleaned and glistened
like glass; meanwhile, he who was responsible for all this harmony sat by the
window, drawing the mask of Thorvaldson's (2) famous model, Fortunata.
All this was exceedingly pleasant to me. Those services clearly spoke in
his favour. However, and I don't know why, I didn't show my satisfaction.
1 corrected the sketch he was doing, put in shadows, and then we left for the
"Kapcrnaum" for tea. "Kapcrnaum" is another name for the "Berlin" tavern
on the corner of the Sixth Line and the Academy Lane that's how it was
named, I believe, by Pimenov (3) during his boisterous student days.
While we were having tea, be told me the story of his life. It was a sad,
mournful talc, but be told it naively and simply, without a shadow of complaint
or reproach. Until that confession I had been thinking of means to improve
his upbringing, hut having heard the confession I even stopped thinking about
it: he was a serf.

THROUGH HIS ART: MUSIC
by Roger Hinks
THE distinction In kind between
music and the visual arts the
one art existing in time, the other in space
is a fundamental one, and is valid In
any time or place. You cannot play music
or read poetry backwards, and make sense.
Whereas it is indifferent whether you begin
to examine a building inside or outside;
or whether you look at the front of a statue
first, or the back ; or whether you start
looking at a picture from the top right hand
corner or the bottom left: the examination
of the whole will take some time, but it is
the spectator's own time; and the choice of
the order of experience is left to him, for
he is an active participant in the process
of appreciation. But a poem, a play, a
symphony have to be experienced in just
that order; and the public has to submit,
all its members responding together simul¬
taneously.
In all countries, there are probably people
who are impatient of this constraint, who
claim the right to take in their own im¬
pressions, in their own time and at their
own pace. Such people, perhaps, are by
nature refractory to music and poetry and
drama ; they feel at ease only with paint¬
ing, sculpture, and architecture. Yet all the
while a kind of unheard, unhurrylng music,
echoes unendingly in the background of
their minds; and they seek to fix it and
point to it In the still but somehow vibrant
shapes of certain works of visual art.
For there are musical pictures, just as
there are unmusical ones, pictures that are
positively hostile to the whole notion of
music. Often enough, the least musical
pictures (in our sense) are precisely those
in which the persons represented are most
busily .engaged in "making" music, or in
which musical Instruments are most con¬
spicuously displayed. In how many pictures
of a musical company do we not feel that
the persons involved are (as amateurs)
merely displaying a polite accomplishment
for the sake of social prestige, or (as pro¬
fessionals) exhibiting their virtuosity to an
admiring, and usually self-admiring, public?
Yet there are, of course, pictures which
really do, in Pater's phrase, "aspire to the
condition of music:" pictures In which the
music is intrinsic, emanates, almost in spite
of themselves, from the men and women
involved resounding, as It were, in the very
pictorial texture of the piece.
Not all pictures of people "making" mu¬
sic are musically unconvincing: In not a few
cases the artist is a sufficiently good
psychologist to be able to convey by ex¬
pression or gesture the rapt and self-forget¬
ful look of those who have really lost them¬
selves in the sounds conjured forth. For
it is not difficult to judge whether the mu¬
sicians are serious or not: whether they are
truly absorbed in their playing and 6inging,
or are smirking at the audience.
Or again: there are plenty of truly mu¬
sical pictures that represent the pauses
In the performance rather than its actual
movement. In fact, many musicians, when
they are being painted, prefer to be exhibit¬
ed as tuning up: It exempts them from
the obligation to put on an act of concen¬
tration for the spectator's benefit; and
it creates the atmosphere of suspense,
when music has just sounded and is soon
to be heard again that moment which is ext¬
ended from the rhythm of the music itself

### 62096: Man through his art: music
MUSIC (Cont'd)
Rhythm and melody
in an art of silence
24
to the Intervals between the movements.
There are Indeed persons so musical that
they only perfectly enjoy the Intermission,
because only then can they reflect In tran¬
quility upon the emotion just past, and anti¬
cipate confidently the emotion Just to come.
It Is thus that one may interpret some of
the most inspired renderings of musical
intermissions, for example, Glorglone's
"Concert Champêtre". The music hangs in
the air, vibrates In the memory: for some
lovers of painting and music, at least, such
pictures are the most musical of all.
For pictures of music are rarely so sug¬
gestive. Painting, after all, Is essentially
an art of stillness: to bring in the ideal
dimension of time, in which music has Its
being, Is to invite disquiet. In seventeenth-
century Holland, the music-lesson, with the
fumbling beginner and the patient master, is
a commoner theme than the assured per¬
formance.
The difference between the European and
the non-European approach to the relations
between sight and sound in the arts is
hard for either to determine. The European
may feel, for instance, that the Chinese and
the Indians and the Persians are nearer to
him in their visual expression of musical
sensibility than, say, the Egyptians, the Afri¬
cans, or the Pre-Columbian Americans; but
he will find it hard to define exactly why
this Is.
No doubt where the rhythm Is most mark¬
ed, and the dominance of time, or duration,
most absolute, the visual arts are furthest
away from music, and the plastic equivalent
to sound hardest to discover and to hold.
One may witness, as it were, drummers
drumming, harpers harping, and trumpeters
trumpeting: one's experience may explain,
more or less, what those drum-beats, harp-
plucks, and trumpet-blasts sound like; and
one's imagination does its best.
But one cannot fully sympathize, or em¬
pathize, unless the artist has managed to
find a visual symbol for the musical effect:
by means, for example of brilliant colour
to render strident sound. The legendary
blind man who felt that scarlet must be like
a trumpet-blast gives again in Nicholas de
Staël's "The Musicians", where the flaming
reds and yellows juxtaposed with sharp
blues do convey with real conviction the
pungency of jazz.
Where, on the other hand, melody pre¬
vails, the rise and fall of the tune can be
suggested in the flow of line; and the
musical intervals in the spacing of shapes,
on the purest Pythagorean principles. In
this sense It is meaningful to describe as
"musical" certain compositions of Gothic
and Renaissance architecture which are
explicitly based upon the Greek philoso¬
pher's relation of number and pitch, and
whose proportions may in consequence
suggest the static relationship of sound and
space. And since colour can be measured
spectroscopically In terms of wavelengths,
it is not fanciful to detect certain affinities
of colour and pitch.
More plausible, however, Is the conten¬
tion, often made when analysing the effect
of Persian miniatures, that there Is a real,
if empirical, connexion between the size of
a patch of colour and the intensity of its
tone and tint; and that melodic sequences
may be easily imagined from the arrange¬
ment of coloured patches as well as from
the movement of the linear pattern. These
relations are, no doubt, a matter of personal
feeling in the sensitive spectator, and
cannot be scientifically demonstrated; but
they are not necessarily the less valid for
that.
Asian music, being purely melodic and
free In rhythm, can be suggested by the
flowing, swaying lines of the design, and
its tonality may be implied by the chroma¬
tic range of the whole composition. Here
at least the European Is at a disadvantage:
he has lost the power to respond emo¬
tionally to any modes but the major and
the minor, which he still equates with
"cheerful" and "sad" moods.
On the other hand, the European does
respond very readily to the clear and
"singing" colour of a Perian- miniature, to
the voluptuous movement of an Indian
sculptured frieze or fresco, to the rhythmic
calligraphy of a Chinese scroll, even if he
knows he Is missing all the overtones and
associations that make them precious to the
Asian mind and eye. And he knows that
the richness and variety of his own musical
and pictorial tradition have been purchased
by the sacrifice of purity, clarity and
directness.
By comparison with the art of Asia his
own art has shown a certain evasiveness, a
certain tendency to obliqueness in Its
musical analogies. But when in recent
years the European artist has wished to
create a permanent ¡mage of movement In
time, he is forced (like Matisse) to rely
upon the Intermediate art of the dance,
where alone music becomes visible, but
whose effect Is of its very nature as eva¬
nescent as music itself.

The temple of Borobudor was
built between 750 and 800 A. D.
It consists of six superimposed
terraces, the wholestucture being
covered with small "stupas"
(Buddhist chapels) and crowned
with a central stupa 52 feet in
diameter. In addition to the rows
of reliefs, there are hundreds of
images of the Buddha and other
statues. Borobudor is the finest
example of Central-Javanese art
and reveals the affinities that
exist between this art and the
medieval art of Bengal (India).

This sculptured group of "Celestial Musicians" (left) from the
great Buddhist temple of Borobudor. Java, is a detail from a
frieze which forms part of a series of reliefs depicting the life
of the Buddha. The frieze shows the Buddha in heaven before
he descends to earth in human form. The group is diverse, yet
in complete harmony; each face and figure is like a note of
music forming a melody. The figures have a gentle grace that
flows like the music they are making. The relief is typical of the
delicacy and tranquility of the art of Central Java between the
8th and 10th centuries A.D., which was closely linked with every¬
day life. In many parts of present-day Indonesia music permeates
life to a remarkable degree, and religious ceremonies and thea¬
trical performances alike take place to the sound of the Gamelan
orchestra. The portfolio "Man Through His Art: Music "includes
a special study on Borobudor's " Celestial Musicians ".

### 62098: The Flags are not enough
THE FLAGS ARE NOT
In a series of three films for TV screening entitled "The
Flags Are Not Enough", the United Nations and Unesco have
reported on social and economic development in the world
during the present United Nations Development Decade.
Since these productions were first distributed last year they
have been shown on all the world's major TV networks.
The three films "Generators of Hope", "Life is Short" and
"The Widening Gap" were written and produced by Stephen
Hearst and are presented with a commentary by Alistair
Cooke. We publish below an adaptation of the English script
of "The Widening Gap".
26
Iuring the next half-hour another Ave thou¬
sand human beings will join us on this earth.
Two in three will inherit a life of want. One in three
a life of comfort.
Today there are many reasons why we should take a
good look at the small world of ease and comfort and
the huge and growing world of poverty.
Between the two there is a widening gap. It is not
a gap between the rich and the very poor, but one
between all those who have a job, a comfortable bed and
reasonable health, and the rest the two thirds of the
human race that is usually side and always close to star¬
vation.
Many people think that the 20th century with its mar¬
vel of technology has bridged this gap, and is paving
the way for everyone Into a land of milk and honey.
They are quite wrong. The gap is widening mainly
because the rich countries are getting richer faster than
the poor countries are emerging from their poverty, and
for the first time in history the depressed two-thirds of
the human race knows this.
One human being in three accepts clean water as a
fact of life . . . Two others don't know what it looks or
tastes like. These are simple contrasts but the two
worlds they reflect are so complicated that It is not
easy to explain why they grow further and further apart.
In the developed world, one farmer can feed 23 people.
In the underdeveloped world, one farmer can barely feed
himself. All the power generated in India could not run
New York City. Two-thirds of the people on earth earn
about one hundred dollars each a year. The privileged
third earns one thousand dollars. Here a man strains
to turn a water wheel . . . Elsewhere, a wheel is the
symbol of speed and comfort.
Yesterday a camel driver may have thought that his
was the common lot of mankind. Today he sees another
world and its wealth on the move. He always knew he
was poor. Now he feels poor. For the first time, he begins
to wonder about his poverty. Is it his fate to be poor?
What brought this about? When did It happen?
Each civilization in turn has believed itself to be the
centre of the world a great improvement on what had
gone before. But all these civilizations had one thing
in common: They were deeply rooted in agriculture and
were thus at the mercy of drought and famine.
They had their doubters, but only among men who had
gone to other parts of the world and seen other marvels.
When Marco Polo returned from China to his native
Venice, he felt that the superior civilization was the
one he had left behind.
It was the beginning of self-doubt; and of that curio
sity which set men first to roam the physical world, and
then to explore and share the world of ideas. One
century discovered raw materials; and the next disco¬
vered the knowledge of how to transform them. These
energies combined to cleave a gap between the old agri¬
cultural societies and the new industrial ones, and then
to use the old for the profit of the new. So, the gap
widened. The people with the new knowledge moved
ahead quickly while monuments to the old knowledge
were engulfed.
Today, every part of the world ls the neighbour of all
the others. The flags at U.N. Headquarters proclaim that
the aspirations of all men are equal. But the flags are not
enough. In over a hundred countries the means are not
equal, nor the training, nor the skill, nor the capital.
This is how Paul Hoffmann of the United Nations sees
the situation: "Poverty and hunger were just words to
me until I saw poverty and hunger in the Far East.
Then and only then did I understand Gandhi's descrip¬
tion of the life of an Indian peasant as 'an eternal
compulsory fast'; and today, with exploding populations,
in order to win the fight against poverty, many countries
are going to have to run fast just to stand still.
"And the problem is aggravated as peasants move from
poverty in the country to unemployment in the cities.
Life is very marginal for these people. They are accused
sometimes of being obstinate, of being unwilling to
take a chance. This is not the case; they dare not
take a chance.
"Even though he doesn't dare take a chance he is
determined to achieve a better life for himself and his
children. When I say 'he' I am talking about hundreds
of millions of people in the less developed countries.
What he needs is insurance against disaster as he
moves to modernize his agriculture and his industry:
help from his own government and help through external
aid. If he gets this assistance, progress can come by
peaceful evolution.
"If he doesn't get this assistance then he will be
tempted to try violence. The bluntest and most accurate
answer as to why we should be concerned is that we
must be. Morally, we can't escape concern ; politically,
we can't avoid it and economically, all our interests
dictate it."
The size of the job is tremendous, but the earth is
tremendously rich. We have only begun to map its
buried or unused resources, but we know already that
there ls hardly a land that could not become a developed
country.
Meanwhile, the essential element of fertility and rich

crops, water, rolls unused Into the ocean. The yield of
the soil ls pitifully low in the very countries whose peoples
live off the land.
In Latin America, 57 per cent of the people live off
the land. In Asia, 73 per cent. In India, a farmer earns
about 18 cents or ls 3d a day. In Africa, three-quarters
of the people grow their own crops, exactly as their
ancestors did.
In simple terms, a farmer in Latin America, in Asia, in
Africa produces one tenth as much as a farmer in West
Europe or North America.
While the developed world, to maintain its prosperity,
is caught up in the momentum of its need to produce
and produce for itself the underdeveloped world, just to
stand still, requires a vast work force. But by 1970, there
will be 300 million more people in the underdeveloped
world many more than primitive skills can support or
feed.
How can we prevent the "explosion" of these baffled
and desperate millions? How can we bring the two worlds
into a sensible balance?
The United Nations has surveyed this world problem
and decided that what we need is nothing less than a
world effort. The U.N. General Assembly has called the
1960's the United Nations Development Decade. It has
defined the needs of its economic growth and social
change, from now till 1970.
We can no longer hide the contrast between the two
worlds. Everywhere the messengers from the developed
world are to be seen automobiles, machinery, etc., and
28 they mock the world still chained to the water wheel.
A man may know how a tractor works, but lack the
training to mend it, and there is no magic that can
give it him overnight. But there ls a talisman for these
people, a new word: "education." As Professor Arthur
Lewis, an economist of international stature, recently
put it:
"Most underdeveloped countries have nibbled at educa¬
tion in one way or another. For prestige reasons, quite
a lot of money is going these days into universities, and
quite a lot of money is going into primary education in
order to wipe out illiteracy.
"Not half enough money, not a quarter enough money is
going into the Intermediate kinds of education. It is at
that secondary level that you really staff up a society."
There is no question of forcing education on unwilling
or bewildered people. They want it and will walk miles
to get it. All over the underdeveloped world children are
hypnotized by the word "school." Mothers start riots
when the local politician fails in his promise of a school
by the autumn.
Education has become a precious latch-key the sure
escape from the prison of poverty.
And there is a sad Irony. In quickly developing places,
the means sometimes arrive before the humans who can
use them. Thus we find well-equipped laboratories but
only a trickle of students. On the one hand, too few
high schools to train students for the university; on the
other, too few of the university students stay home
they are lured abroad by scholarships. Some buildings
could well carry a warning legend: "Built at the wrong
time for the wrong students."
For countless bright boys, the primary school is the
end of the road. They know too much to go back to the

old life, too little to go forward to a new one. As Professor
Lewis has also pointed out:
"You can't begin to tackle this problem without a very
large expenditure of capital. Some of this capital can
come, Indeed does come, from outside. But the great
bulk of it has to be found inside the countries, either from
the savings of the people or from the savings of the
government.
"The people save very little, partly because they haven't
got the savings habit, partly because they are very poor.
And therefore, in underdeveloped countries a great deal
of reliance has to be placed on savings from the govern¬
ment, on having a level of taxes which is sufficiently
high to cover the whole of the government expenditure
on current account and also to make capital available
for agriculture, for housing, for helping out the small
manufactures with loans, and so on.
"Even in the case of countries where there ls a general
recognition that one should move forwards, and that
moving forwards means that the great masses of the
people have to be educated and given the incentive to
improve themselves, some fall by the wayside because
politicians find other things so much more interesting."
There is another side of the problem: the production
and pricing of the crop you live by. Something as
humble, say, and essential as peanuts. A country is urged
to produce more; and It does; only to find that the
world market is against it.
Since 1948, the underdeveloped countries have Increased
their farm exports by 33 per cent; but the value of these
exports on the world market has gone up by only 4 per
cent. This is yet another simple, sinister way in which
the gap between the two worlds widens. For these
countries, a fall in the price of a single crop can wipe
out the value of all the foreign aid they receive. If
coffee fetches less than It used to, people may be drink¬
ing it at the grower's expense.
We all know by now that developed nations are giving
substantial aid to low-Income countries. But it's often
unco-ordlnated and competitive.
Britain has built an artificial harbour for Ghana . . .
There is vast and diverse French aid to West Equatorial
Africa . . . Yugoslavia puts up a tanning factory in the
Sudan in exchange for its products . . . The United
States, Britain and the United Nations all help to cons¬
truct the Volta Dam; and in Asia the Bahkra Dam is a
monument to generous aid.
One of the Soviet Union's widespread commitments ls
to build a steel mill in India and train its workers.
Canada helped with India's first atomic reactor. Inter¬
national financial help builds railways In Pakistan. In
Latin America, the United States In particular has
helped a whole continent Into the industrial age. In the
West Indies, American help replaces the slums with
decent housing.
These are samples only. But all the aid so given ls
Itself only a sample of the aid that is needed. But other
people too are citizens of member states of the United
Nations. What has the United Nations done for them?
The honest answer is not much, if we look at their
needs. A good deal if we look at the available means.
In the words of David Owen, Head of the UN's Technical
Assistance Board:
"Agricultural production has been increased in many
lands, schools have been started and thousands of young
people who would otherwise have had no education have
been provided for. Industrial efficiency has been improv¬
ed, trade for new industries has been increased, and the
health and vitality of a vast number of peoples through¬
out the world has been transformed."
This is on the plus side. But It is hardly a beginning.
It is not that we are ignorant about the immensity and

A new capital for Pakistan
Map of West Pakistan. Pak¬
istan's capital, formerly in
Karachi, has now been provi¬
sionally established in Rawal¬
pindi, about 12 miles from
Islamabad, the new capital.
I IM the north of West Pakistan, on a site formerly
occupied by six small villages, a great modern
city has been born: Islamabad, the new capital
of Pakistan. It is situated about 12 miles from
the present provisional capital at Rawalpindi
and some 750 miles from Pakistan's former capi¬
tal, Karachi. Work began in 1961, and today
Islamabad is a bustling city of 50,000 people.
The first primary school was opened last year
and the secondary school for girls already has
500 pupils. Over 3,250 houses have been built,
700 are now being constructed and a further
2,400 will be built. Half the planned streets are
open to traffic. Islamabad can fairly claim to be
one of today's most striking architectural and
town-planning achievements. It has not merely
been planned as the administrative centre of a
nation but also as a symbol of its way of life,
its history and traditions, and the image of its
hopes for prosperity and social stability.

residential area. All sections of the city will enjoy
the same standard of urban services and amenities.

### 62098: The Flags are not enough
THE FLAGS (Cont'd from p. 29)
U.N. -Unesco
In some countries 50% of all the energy used comes from the muscles of men and beasts. In
others, thanks to a technological revolution, practically all energy is non-human. Most of the
world is still waiting for the technical means that can release resources locked in the soil,
in the sun and in the sea. Above, a shot from the U.N.-Unesco film, " Generators of Hope"
No Utopia by next Monday
the variety of these people's needs. They have been
accurately and conscientiously studied. But the helping
nations each work independently, often in conflict and
without a plan, and the will to combine is weak. So
that all the aid given to the underdeveloped world
amounts to a bare fifth of what we know to be necessa¬
ry. Of that fraction, the United Nations has been able
to supply only a fraction. The gap ls not visibly narrow¬
er. Perhaps, it would be good if all the helpers could
begin the new decade by admitting their failures.
"We have made many mistakes," says David Owen.
"We spread our resources out far too thinly. We have
undertaken technical projects which were good in them¬
selves, but were from an economic standpoint somewhat
implausible. Then there was the problem of doing things
in a hurry. Starting off university work before we were
sure we had the high schools producing the students to
go to these universities. And undertaking the develop¬
ment of industries before we were sure that the world
market justified the development of industries of the
kind which we had In mind."
And yet there have been astounding successes.
It is not biased to say that some governments and
peoples prefer to get help through the United Nations,
since an international team is trusted and its motives
are above suspicion. International aid could achieve far
more if governments gave more money. But governments
depend on public opinion, which at present appears too
divided to make its weight felt.
Utopia by next Monday morning. This too Is a fact
of the 1960's. Over half the world's population is under
twenty-one; and the idea that age equals wisdom is mock¬
ed by the ferment in the blood of the young people every¬
where: the new conviction is that a better life can be
had and must be had.
Is there a reasonable way to satisfy this craving? Here
ls what the economist and writer, Barbara Ward Jackson
has to say:
32 "I know a lot of people will say that this is nonsense,
that economic assistance to underdeveloped areas is an
essential part of governmental policies these days, and
governments are giving considerable sums in economic
assistance. But I wonder whether we really do It with
a right and central purpose.
"Nations give it for their own national interests; they
give it to stop the people they don't like; they give it to
gain friends for the quarters they do like. I don't think
they see it as a potentially International effort to carry
the revolution of science and technology In abundance to
all mankind, which Is now possible. And because of this,
I don't think that the positive purposes are put in proper
perspective, nor frankly, do I think we do enough.
"I would like to see the one per cent of national income,
which ls talked of as the contribution of the wealthy
nations to the poor (and which isn't reached inciden¬
tally) as a minimum, as a starting point. After all, we
all grow by three per cent a year, at a minimum, and
therefore if we were to devote one per cent to the deve¬
lopment of poorer nations we shouldn't exactly be worse
off. We might perhaps be slowing down our own rate
of wealth-making a little. But that doesn't seem to me
to be a tremendous sacrifice to this cause."
The income of the underdeveloped world can be raised
by a quarter in this decade, if the effort to raise it is
not jarred by national jealousy and confused by pulling
in different directions. This decade has set a race be¬
tween education and catastrophe. We could, in only ten
years, make the world a more decent place for maybe
four humans in ten instead of for three.
The world cost of armaments may well be equal to the
income of the whole underdeveloped world. It is a grim
piece of arithmetic.
The children themselves will soon learn, for the first
time, that men can increase their capacity, that a poor
man can with the right help change his lot. Rightly
given, that help would be part self-interest, part intelli¬
gent goodwill, and no part charity.
In ten years from now the flags of the nations could
salute a prouder truth than the fact of sovereignty; the
fact that millions had learned to take pride in being
a member of the human race.

Letters to the Editor
PLACE FOR SPORT
Sir,
Your articles on amateurism and
professionalism in sport (Jan. 1964)
were full of interest, but they did not
deal with every aspect of this im¬
portant problem. I think that through
your magazine, Unesco should deal
more thoroughly with this question
and also present some counter
opinions.
Fred Pfeiffer
Kirchberg, Switzerland
Sir,
The Unesco Courier is great and
I am very glad I made its
acquaintance. But I think you should
continue to follow your choice for the
January 1964 issue. A little bit of
sport, without transforming the
magazine, will encourage young people
to take a good look at the world.
They welcome even a few facts on
sport.
René Martin
St-Vallier, France
KEEPING UP WITH ART
Sir,
The very fact that a magazine
article can rouse me to write a
letter means something. Not only
am I getting on in years, but I have
seen too much to be easily moved
to enthusiasm. However, the article
"Movement and Light in Today's
. Art", (Sept. 1963) made such an
impression on me that I do not want
to let this ' opportunity slip by.
Certainly, I like a Rubens painting
better than a modern one as it is
easier for me to understand and
appreciate. However,. I realize that
art, like science and technology,
cannot stand still but evolves
continuously. Therefore, I con
gratulate you for having shown your
readers the problems inherent in
modern art and, using Malina's work
as an illustration, giving us an idea of
its true aims. Various aspects immed¬
iately became much clearer to me and,
in spite of my "aged vision", I am
now trying to penetrate into this new
world of movement and to recognize
its beauty. However, you will
certainly agree with me that a single
issue on this subject is not enough.
I am sure that many readers would
welcome a return to this theme and
perhaps to other aspects of modern
art as well. I suddenly feel very "up
to date", and thank you warmly for
this.
Jules Baur
Laupen, Switzerland
WHEN NEGATIVE = POSITIVE
Sir,
An editorial note in your letters
column ("Seeking the Causes of
War", Sept. 1963) pointed out that
since 1956 Unesco has placed
emphasis on studies of the positive
aspects of improving international
relations rather than conducting
research into the negative aspects of
such relations which tend to bring
about war. Your split in "negative"
and "positive" aspects does not give
the "negative" studies the credit they
also deserve. Only they can give us
a better understanding and know¬
ledge as to which of the aspects of
international relations are the most im¬
portant and should be worked on
hardest.
W. Smit
Hilversum, Netherlands
SHAPING YOUNG MINDS
Sir,
I believe that Unesco, the inter¬
national organization for culture and
education, should do its part in the
shaping of young minds from the
moral standpoint. This is much more
important than many other aspects
of education. Despite the many risks
run by adolescents today, we seem
unmoved by this transcendent problem.
Adolescence is the most critical period
of life since it is so close to the step
that will bring the child to adult¬
hood. We know that today's children
are the men of tomorrow, but we
still do not concern ourselves
sufficiently with their future nor
fight energetically enough against the
demoralizing and corrupting influences
of our time.
Maria Roca de Compta
Barcelona, Spain
DEAL WITH PEOPLE...
Sir,
I find the Unesco Courier of little
interest. I am interested in the living
world of today, not in a long, windy
tale about musical instruments, desert
sands, arctic penguins etc. In my
estimation you have a good organiza¬
tion but why don't you fill your
paper with people, problems, under¬
standing of the members of the U.N.
nations as they are living today...
Don't try to be geographical or
scientific but deal with people...
M. J. MacDonald
Montreal, Canada
...AND GIVE US SPECIAL ISSUES
Sir,
For some years now I have been
subscribing to your magazine and
have been reading the various
comments about the magazine in the
letters pages. I find it as it is now
a very fine journal, midway between
being too serious and too popular.
I do not expect to find all articles
in any journal I wish to read of equal
interest to myself, and hope that at
least one or two will be worth reading.
The Unesco Courier always lives up
to my expectations.
I enjoy the special issues as they
appear from time to time, so I hope
that you will keep these up. It was,
in fact, a special issue which brought
The Unesco Courier to my notice,
one on Duddhist art sometime in 1956
I think. (June 1956-Ed.) Mostly I
enjoy the features on art, literature,
archaeology, ancient Egypt and other
civilizations that is my personal bias,
but I do find many others interesting.
Other letters you print only show
that you can't please everybody.
D. G. Jamlcson

NEW ART IN GLASS
Sir,
Anita Engle's interesting article,
"3,000 Years of Glass-Making" (Feb.
1964), set me thinking about a new
art form: gemmail. What kind of
process is used here and how is glass
incorporated with it? Since when
has gemmail existed? Congratulations
on the standard of your texts and
illustrations.
Pierre Bailly
Chaourcc, Aube, France
Ed note : Gemmail is a method of
making stained glass pictures witliout
the use of lead soldering, and simply
by juxtaposition and superposition of
fragments of glass. The technique is
said to have been first used in 1939
by the French surrealist artist of
Swiss origin, Jean Crotti (1878-1958).
UNREVEALED
TRANSLATIONS
Sir,
In the October 1963 issue of The
Unesco Courier, a letter headed
"Hebrew Translations" deals, inter-
alia, with books that have been
translated from Hebrew into German.
On the authority of the last two
editions of the "Index Translationum",
this letter states that only a single
book has been translated from Hebrew
into German.
However correct the information
obtained from the Index Trans¬
lationum may be, it gives a very
incomplete picture. As was recently
stated in Germania Judaica, published
by the Cologne Library for the History
of German Jewry, more translations
from Hebrew have appeared (at any
rate in German) than the Index
Translationum indicates. The reason
is that many books written by Jewish
authors have not been translated into
German but originally appeared in
that language, while other books by
Jewish authors were translated into
German via the English version.
Neither the one nor the other type of
translation from the Hebrew is listed
in the Index Translationum.
This is not an isolated case, but
also holds for translations from Asian
languages, which often find their way
into European languages via English,
French or German.

Cologne, German Federal Republic

From the Unesco New
YOUTH LENDS A HAND: Since the
U.N. . Development Decade was
launched three years ago, nearly two mil¬
lion young people have served as volun¬
teer helpers, building roads, bridges and
schools, and teaching and doing social
work in the developing countries. Plans to
expand this work have been made by
voluntary service organizations at a con¬
ference in Linz, Austria called by the
Coordination Committee for International
Voluntary Workcamps with Unesco's assis¬
tance.
ALL ABOUT UNESCO: The most
complete account of Unesco's acti¬
vities and history is available to scholars,
research workers, librarians, authors, stu¬
dents and others in the Unesco Archives.
A collection of over 217,000 items of
documentation, the Archives are consult¬
ed on subjects ranging from problems of
the developing countries to race questions,
and from child and family problems to
mass communication techniques. Anyone
unable to visit the Archives at Unesco's
H.Q. in Paris may request information by
mail.
PRAGUE BIOLOGY COURSE: A
post-graduate course on modern prob¬
lems in biology sponsored by Unesco
and organized by the Czechoslovak Acade¬
my of Sciences in co-operation with the
University of 17th November, Prague, will
be held at this university from October 1,

be given in English. Application forms
may be obtained from Academician Ivan
Malek, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences,
Narodni trida 3, Praha 1 - Stare Mesto,
Czechoslovakia, and must be completed by
July 15, 1964.
FACTORY-BUILT TOWNS: Préfabrica¬
tion plants which will put the cons¬
truction of entire towns on an assembly-
line basis are to be built on sites in the
Ukraine, near Tashkent (Uzbekistan) and in
Daghestan. These three factories are com¬
posed of pre-fabricated elements and can
be dismantled when required. Each will
turn out the parts to make 1,000 homes
a year, as well as kindergartens and
schools.
IN SPACE FOR 470 MILLION YEARS.
French and American scientists be¬
lieve that a meteorite found in Upper
Volta (Africa) last year had previously been
moving through space for 470 million
years. The meteorite, weighing just under
18 lbs. and looking like a piece of rusted
metal, may provide new information on
cosmic rays and the age and origin of the
solar system.
SEISMIC EXPLORATION OF
WORLD'S CRUST: More systema¬
tic use of seismic explosions to obtain a
truer picture of the profile of the earth's
crust has been recommended by a meeting
convened in Paris for the International
Committee for Geophysics. The picture so
far obtained of the earth's crust is far from
complete and probably inaccurate in detail.
MAPPING HISTORIC MONUMENTS:
Switzerland, the 49th country to
ratify the International Convention for the
Protection of Historic Monuments in the
Event of Armed Conflict, recently arranged
for publication by the Topographical Ins¬
titute of a 1: 300,000 scale map indicating
all its artistic and historical monuments,
as well as those of Liechtenstein. To date,
fifty countries have ratified the International
Convention, which is sponsored by Unesco.
TEMPLE ON THE MOVE: The small
temple of Buhen with its beautiful
sculptures and paintings which for 3,500
years has stood above the Nile near Wadi
Haifa in Sudanese Nubia is now stored
away in cases in Khartoum, prior to its
re-erection on a new site under Unesco's
plan to save monuments threatened by
floodwaters after the completion of the
new Aswan High dam. The Buhen temple
will be rebuilt in the gardens of the New
Museum in Khartoum.

The first joint Soviet-French research in
Antarctica has recently been carried out.
Five French glaciologists took part in a
900 mile trek by snow vehicle from the
Soviet Vostok station near the South Pole,
to study the movement, structure and
deformation of the Antarctic ice shield.
Under a national plan for educational
expansion, Colombia has built 3,000
primary schools and plans to construct a
further 20,000. A Unesco mission now in
Bogota, Colombia's capital, is helping
the government to review its educational
planning at all levels.
H Kenya recently became Unesco's 114/ft
member state.
[ The world's first ocean-bottom seis¬
mograph station which will be used for
tracking small continental earthquakes is to
be placed in the Pacific Ocean. It will be
connected by cable to a recording station
on the nearby California coast, to which
it will transmit data on seismic waves in
the ocean depths.
H Every year water-borne diseases, in¬
cluding typhoid, dysentery and cholera, kill
five million babies and attack 500 million
people, reports the World Health Organi¬
zation. This year's World Health Assembly
urged the stepping up of national pro¬
grammes to provide safe drinking water.
SAVING AFRICAN WILDLIFE A NEW UNESCO FILMSTRIP
our african
heritage
notre héritage
africain
Seventy kinds of African mammals disappeared
during the 19th century and since the beginning
of the 20th, forty more have become extinct.
"Our African Heritage" a colour flimstrip recently
Issued by Unesco, serves as an illustrated guide
to the problem of protecting wildlife in Africa.
In 32 colour photographs the Unesco fllmstrip
shows some of the animals which are an Impor¬
tant natural resource for Africa and a valuable
scientific heritage for the world. Measures to
protect these animals from game hunters are
suggested in seven diagrams, illustrating how
a balance could be achieved between the ani¬
mals and their natural habitat. Commentary notes,
a glossary and a bibliography are given in
English, French and Spanish In an explanatory
booklet Distributors' addresses and further
details of this and other Unesco filmstrips covering
a wide range of subjects may be obtained from
Unesco's Visual Information Division, Place de

HEVCHENKO, REBEL WITH A CAUSE
Celebrations this year mark the 150th birthday an¬
niversary of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko
whose entire life was dedicated to a struggle
against despotism and on behalf of human rights
(See page 11). An exhibition of 1,600 works of art
dedicated to Shevchenko opened recently in Kiev.
This statue by the Ukranian sculptor, Michael
Khudas, honours the poet in Zaporozhe (Ukraine).
