Henri Atlan
interview
,f è
e tronUers of Hcienee
The French biologist Henri Atlan,
{Tofessor 


of biophysics at the
University of Paris VI and at the
Hebrew University of Jérusalem, has
won an international réputation for
his research on the self-organization of
cells and artificial intelligence.
Notable among his published works
are Entre le cristal et la fumée, Essai
sur l'organisation du vivant (Seuil,
Paris, 1979), A tort et à raison,
Intercritique de la science et du mythe
(Seuil, Paris, 1986), L'Organisation
biologique et la théorie de
l'information {l^ermmn, Paris, 1992)
and Questions de vie, Entre le savoir
et ropinion (Seuil, Paris, 1994).
Hère he talks to Géraldine Schimmel
about some topical matters arising
from the relationship between science
and Society.
Science was vested with an
immense hope that it would explain
everything, help people to live, and
provide a basis for ethics. How do
things stand today?
Henri Atlan: It is now clear to most sci-
entists that this hope is groundless.
Unlike the rehgions, idéologies and
philosophies that claim to give meaning
to the universe and to people 's lives, sci¬
ence owes its successes to its method,
which involves carefully circumscribing
a subject for study and contenting itself
with local explanations that hold good in
a certain well defined field. Science and
technology hâve been effective in domi-
nating matter, but unable to give meaning
to life or solve social, political or moral
problems. There is still a nostalgie hope
that science may provide us with Truth
with a capital T, a single truth from
which it will then deduce individual,
social, political or some other form of
Good; but this is simply nostalgia.
An illusion?
H. A.: Of course. A pièce of nostalgia
based on the illusion of a universal
theory that would explain everything,
things as they are and as they ought to
be. This is what is known in English as
the naturalistic fallacy, deducing what
"ought to be" from what "is". "What
ought to be" is actually the product of
our imagination and of our desires, and
is not usually deducible from "what is".
Knowledge of "what is" enables us to
realize the constraints that impose
limits on our imagination, limits which it
is usually impossible to transgress.
Are science on the onehand and
myths and religions on the other based
on the same rationality?
H. A.: Not at ail. In my book A tort et à
raison I tried to demonstrate that there
are several sorts of rationahty something
which is not seK-evident. Many people stiU
beheve that only science is rational, and
that what is not scientific is necessarily
irrational. But every myth expresses, in its
own way, a kind of rationahty which is dif¬
férent in terms of its method, its objec¬
tives and its means of vérification from
that of scientific thought. It is wrong to
get them mixed up. The same reason is
involved, but the ways in which it is
apphed are différent.
You hâve said that the real
generator of objective Knowledge is
It is wrong to think that onty science is rational. Every
mytii expresses a Ifind of rationality wliicli is différent
from that developed by scientific thought.

H enri Atlan at a Unesco
Philosophy Forum on the
thème "What We Do Not
Know" (Paris, March 1995).
mastery of nature and that ethics is
the motor of mystical and religious
traditions. What happons when ethics
is required to deal with objective
Knowledge?
H. A.: That is a quite straightforward
matter. It's the reverse situation that
raises problems. It is indispensable that
ethics should be concerned with the use
made 


of science-based technology,
insofar as technology raises moral ques¬
tions that the sciences are unable to
answer. Let's take an example from the
field of biomédical ethics: is the real
mother the woman who carries the child
or the one who supplied the egg that is
fertilized and then implanted? This
question did not arise before technology
made it possible to separate the utérine
and ovarian aspects of maternity. In this
field the progress of science and tech¬
nology has created problems of legiti-
macy, of good and evil, of what is per-
mitted and what is not that did not
exist before and that neither biology nor
medicine alone can solve.
You hâve rejected the term
'bioethics'. Why?
H. A.: I don't like the term because it
implies the existence of a new discipline
derived from biology, rather like bio-
physics or biochemistry, and suggests
that via bioethics it may be possible to
find, within biology itself, the answers
to the ethical problems posed by
biology. But this is not at ail the case.
Biology poses problems of an ethical
nature, but it does not solve them, even
if it is clear that we cannot begin to
tackle them without an understanding
of their biological roots. Solutions will
resuit from différent ethical
approaches that vary from person to
person and culture to culture. Thèse
problems are so new that people
belonging to the same tradition often
respond spontaneously to them in totally
différent ways.
Is thinking about the problems
posed by new scientific discoveries
exclusively a matter for specialists?
H. A.: Certainly not. It is vitally impor
tant that questions about the rights or
wrongs of using a given biological tech¬
nique should be asked by people out-
side the field who bave a broader, non-
partisan approach to it. In fact this is
increasingly being doue by so-called bio¬
médical ethics committees. The mem-
bers of thèse committees include
experts who explain to the best of their
ability the scientific background of the
problems, but also philosophers, reli¬
gious leaders, sociologists, psychologists
and especially légal experts, who even
though their answers are, perforée,
fragmentary and incomplète bave to
give an opinion on what is permissible
and what is not.

What about the gênerai public?
H. A.: They are faced with two prob¬
lems. On the one hand, biologists don't
bave a big platform on which to make
their science known. On the other, the
média présent problems in a way that is
inevitably incomplète and sometimes
biased. The gênerai public is forced to
decipher a confused message which
reflects a debate between specialists fil-
tered through the média, which try to
explain to their audience the issues
involved in complex questions to which
there are no simple, ready-made
answers.
Do you think that fear about
advances in genetics is justified?
H. A.: It dépends on what kind of fear
you are talking about. Abuses are
always possible, but they existed before
advances in genetics. Don't forget that
the most horrible eugenic policies this
century were implemented by the Nazis
without the help of genetics. Tech¬
nology is not necessarily dangerous in
itself. Its application can be, however,
if it is left to the discrétion of criminals.
This is one of the reasons why a min¬
imum of législation is necessary.
Applying to human beings some of the
genetic techniques that are applied to
animais (making chimeras, transgenic
individuals whose génome is modified in
such a way that it is largely impossible
to know what will corne from it) is obvi-
ously criminal. This must be made quite
clear, so that no geneticists should feel
authorized to go in for such practices.
In any case almost ail geneticists
agrée that a clear distinction should be
made between therapeutic activities in
which the gènes of somatic cells (the
body's non-reproductive cells) are mod¬
ified, and activities designed to modify
the gènes of germ cells (cells trans-
mitted to descendants). The différence
is enormous: modifying the gènes of
somatic cells is no more dangerous than,
for example, x-ray therapy. Treating a
cancer with x-rays entails a lot of muta¬
tion of cells, but not of germ cells. Most
ethics committees hâve completely for-
bidden the use of gène therapy on germ
cells. But how can we be sure that this
prohibition will be maintained unchanged
in future?
Does the same prohibition also
apply to disease-bearing germ cells?
H. 4.; At présent it is strictly forbidden
to try to manipulate sperm, ova and fer¬
tilized eggs to replace disease-bearing
gènes with normal gènes because, I must
stress, cells transmitted to descendants
are involved. A very important distinc¬
tion must be made about the purpose
of genetic techniques. Are we trying to
treat a person with a spécifie disease or
are we trying to modify the human
species? Insofar as we are dealing with
individual therapy, classical standards
of médical practice and biomédical
ethics that are now developing make it
possible to distinguish, sometimes on a
case-by-case basis, between what is and
what is not allowed. But imagining that
we are going to modify humanity is the
same irresponsible fantasy that has been
at the root of ail eugenic disasters.
Can standards of ethical
practice, ethics committees and
législation slow up research and
development?
H. A.: Some people think they should. I
don't agrée with that at ail. In any case
it would be impossible. First of ail
because as soon as you know something,
you can no longer behave as if you didn't
know it. Secondly, because it is impos¬
sible to know in advance what results a
research programme is going to lead to.
Research programmes can't be stopped
on the pretext that they may be dan¬
gerous. Obviously it is always possible
to stop certain spécifie applied research
programmes that do not come under the
heading of basic research. But that is
not the same thing as putting a brake
on research or halting scientific
progress. The ban on applying certain
research techniques to human beings
has always existed; implicitly before the
Second World War, and explicitly after
the trial of Nazi criminal doctors at
Nuremberg. That was when biomédical
ethics began to be established.
The Nobel Prize-winner Albert
Szent-Gyôrgyi once claimed that 'life
as such does not exist'?i Wasn't that
a strange thing for a biologist to say?
H. A,: He said that at the beginning of
the century, but it's even more obvions
today. It simply means that life does not
exist as an object for biological research.
Biologists today are not preoccupied

with knowing what life is. They study
Systems, organisms, and try to under-
stand how they work, i.e. the physical-
chemical mechanisms 

of what structures
them and of what they do. This being the
case, life has completely disappeared as
a subject of research for this science that
is still called the science of life! but
this does not mean that it no longer
exists. It is still a matter of subjective
expérience: it's our life. But it no longer
has anything to do with biology.
What différence is there, then, from
a biological point of view, between a
living being and a dead one? Between
the animate and the inanimate?
H. A.: From a physical-chemical point
of view it's merely a change of state.
The same applies to the soûl, which is
no longer a subject of scientific
research. In the past thèse two notions
were inextricably linked: a living being
was living because of having a soûl that
bestowed that particular quality. This
idea goes back to Aristotle. It domi-
nated the West until the Renaissance,
but has now disappeared.
In the view of scientists, what rôle
does chance play in the organization
of nature?
H. A.: When we study Systems that are
not simple (living organisms, some phys-
ical Systems and interlocking chemical
reactions, for instance) we can see
since we don't know everything about
them that the best way to understand
and achieve even a very slight measure
of control over them is to take this igno¬
rance into account. Chance appears in
the form of phenomena that arise at
random. For example, the évolution of
species is considered to be an effect of
genetic mutations supposedly occurring
by chance in individuals. This does not
mean that the mutations do not bave
causes. They do bave causes, in fact,
some of which we know fairly well:
cosmic radiation, natural (or artificial)
Imagining that we are going to modify the human
species is an irresponsible fantasy that has been at the
root of ail eugenic disasters.
radioactivity and exposure to chemical
substances that exist in nature or are
even stored in spécifie kinds of waste.
Mutations always hâve physical causes.
The only random clément has to do with
their possible effect on an organism; in
other words, there is no link between
the cause of a mutation and the change
it will effect in the functioning of the
organism in question.
What is self-organization?
H. A.: The classic example is that of a
hen's egg. When you look at an egg, it
doesn't seem very complicated. Even
when you examine it under a microscope
you find it only consists of one cell. But
the chicken that will émerge from it will
consist of a large number of cells that
are very différent from one other.
The same principle applies to the
development of species. Ail palaeonto-
logical data show that we began with
relatively simple, single-cell organisms,
like seaweed or paramecia. Multi-cell
organisms appeared much later, but
they were still fairly simple with
roughly similar cells. Then more com¬
plex organisms began appearing with
diversified cells performing différent
functions.
What we hâve to understand is how
a pièce of matter that appears poorly
organized to us rightly or wrongly
can evolve using its own properties to a
more complex state of organization.
Vitalist théories said it was the life
force. The French philosopher Henri
Bergson himself said that the organiza¬
tion of living organisms was explained by
what he called an "élan vital". But now
that this kind of explanation is no longer
accepted, we hâve to find a physical
theory capable of describing thèse self-
organizing mechanisms. This is where
chance comes into it. It seems to play a
positive rôle in the sensé that it may
permit a state of things to be modified
in the direction of greater organization.
In the past chance was thought to be
nothing but a source of disorganization.
But certain factors that can only be con¬
sidered as random, as the product of
chance, may on the contrary encourage
the appearance of more organized
States. There is nothing magical about
this. To call something "chance" is only
a way of formalizing factors we are igno¬
rant of.
But this is only a summary descrip¬
tion of one possible form of self-organi¬
zation. There are many others which
use computer models that enable us to
study how complex forms and functions
can be produced by interconnected net¬
works of simple éléments.
Has chance replaced the magie of
the IVliddIe Ages?
H. A.: Not at ail. We're talking about
chance which is formalized and tamed,
and thus forms part of laws laws of
probability that are décisive.
Is there any order in nature?
H. A,: Undoubtedly; and probably more
than one. But the person who could tell
us about it would need to be very bright
indeed. Science is trying to discover cer¬
tain regularities that look like order.

HUNTERS A PROTECTED SPECIES?
I was unpleasantly surprised to find a short
news item entitled "Hunters a much-
maligned species" in the Greenwatch section
of the October 1995 issue ("The United
Nations, Why it matters"). 1 fail to see why the
prolifération of hunted animais should be big
news, nor how the prolifération of some species
(even if hunters are indirectly responsible) can
be considered a positive sign of the health of
the environment. In gênerai it seems to me
that, on the contrary, it is a sign of an imbal¬
ance albeit one that hunters hasten to cor¬
rect! 1 trust that this will be nothing more than
a momentary lapse by your admirable maga¬
zine and that I will hâve no reason to regret my
subscription in the coming months.
Christian Viliard
O rnacieux (France)
What is a news item in favour of hunting doing
in the Greenwatch section of your October
1995 issue? Certainly the text is carefully
worded and expresses certain réservations, but
the message that will stay in people 's minds is
that hunters protect nature. I would suggest
that nature cannot be protected by people
wielding guns, The ecological balance is not
aided by reintroducing species that are "inter¬
esting" to hunt, The real balance is infinitely
more complex and is not limited to deer and
elk, I hope the UNESCO Courier will be more
careful in what it says about this topic in
future and will not make excuses, however
unintentional, for hunters.

In one sensé this issue on racism is a follow-up to last month's number devoted to the mechanisms
of complex thought. The astonishing advances of genetics are a new reminder of the need to think
in complex terms, of how dangerous it is to make do with simple explanations, to float on the sur¬
face, confuse the foam on the billows with the depths of the océan.
A day rarely seems to go by without the announcement that scientists hâve discovered gènes
that trigger diseases such as certain cancers and cardio-vascular ailments, and conditions such as
obesity. One gène may even prédispose people to suicide; another to a spirit of innovation.
Such news items report on highly complex scientific research that may one day lead to major
breakthroughs in technology and therapy. When they are presented in oversimplified form to hun-
dreds of millions of non-specialized readers or televiewers, they may hâve a grossly misleading
effect. Instead of regarding the gène as one key among others to the mystery of life, many people
come to believe that genetics can explain everything. The impression spreads that we are pro-
grammed even before birth to possess certain qualities and certain defects, perhaps even a
prédisposition to good or evil.
As well as attaching excessive prépondérance to nature over nurture, this approach leads to
a perfidious mixture of value judgements and clinical observations. A potential defect comes to be
regarded as inévitable. A weak point is magnified into total infirmity. This déviation towards sim-
plistic determinism is bad enough when it leads to the establishment of hiérarchies and of inequal-
ities between individuals. It becomes criminal when it seeks to define classes of people which are
inherently endowed with a certain weakness or a certain token of superiority. Genetics is not at fault
hère, but it may, like Darwinism in the late nineteenth century and biology early in the twentieth,
serve as a new pretext on which to base old préjudices.
We are living at a time when racism is again rising from its ashes and manifesting a virulence
and pervasiveness that we hoped had disappeared at the end of the Second World War. This is why
we hâve thought it necessary to go to the roots of this evil phenomenon, to the obscure origins of
racism, to the enigma that underlies it and perpétuâtes it in various guises in différent times and
places.
What causes racism to appear and reappear?
One contributor to this issue, French sociologist Michel Wieviorka, suggests that racism is a
corollary of modernity, and that its résurgence is a resuit of the collision between économie glob-
alization and cultural individualism. Etienne Balibar argues that it is a fearsome instrument of col¬
lective identification, the évolution of which often goes hand in hand with modes of social domina¬
tion. American sociologist Stephen Steinberg believes that only interventionist policies can shake
the structures in which discrimination is enmeshed. Geneticist Albert Jacquard reminds us that
however often science exposes the alleged "scientific" justifications of racism, racism continues to
feed on our fears and repressions.
We also publish excerpts from landmark texts by Elias Canetti and Claude Lévi-Strauss to round
off our analysis of an evil that Gandhi once admitted was for him a "mystery".

### 102557: The Seeds of hate

The seeds of hâte
by Michel Wieviorka
Crisis in the modem world is fanning the embers of
racism and nationalism
An elderly woman with the
yellow star Jews were forced to
wear by the Nazis.
iij % In the wake of the Second World War
«-* f and, later, of decolonization, Western
societies had reason to believe that racism in
their countries would gradually fade away.
After the discovery of the Nazi concentration
camps and gas chambers, antisemitism could
no longer be regarded as a matter of opinion; it
had become a crime and a taboo. Colonial
racism ceased to hâve any justification when
colonized peoples achieved independence.
The modem âge beckoned, and nothing
seemed likely to hait the mareh of progress.
Then, in the early 1970s, the situation
altered radically. The idea that political and
économie change would lead towards more
and more growth and democracy and less
and less poverty, racism and anti-semitism
began to run out of steam.
The fîrst signs of this reversai appeared in
the United Kingdom in the late 1960s when
Enoch Powell criticized current immigration
policy in the name of English nationalism, and
when the National Front movement emerged.
During the 1980s, racism, xenophobia and
anti-semitism became features, often central
features, of political life in most European
nations.
A rising tide
Today, the situation is particularly disturbing.
A number of studies and surveys hâve
shown that racial discrimination in employ-
ment and housing has become widespread in
the United Kingdom. There has been an
upsurge in racist violence, mainly in towns
and cities but also in rural areas. In France,
where public opinion poils reveal growing
race préjudice and racialist attitudes, the most
conspicuous sign of racism has been the rise
of a populist nationalist party, the Front
National, which has scored considérable suc-
cess in élections since 1983. The party gives
shape to popular feelings in which racism,
more than antisemitism, has an important
place. In France, a country where racist vio¬
lence is limited in extent, race discrimination
is a less central issue than that of social and
ethnie exclusion. The French expérience is
différent from that of Britain, where there is
little specifîcally political expression of racism.
Racism in the former Fédéral Republic of
Germany took real but limited form in xéno¬
phobie campaigns linked to économie down-
turns in 1966-1967 and 1974 and in the treat-
ment of Turkish immigrants. The situation
changed radically with reunification. After

the bombing of a hostel for immigrant
workers in Hoyerswerda in September 1992
a wave of violence swept through the former
German Démocratie Republic and then
spread throughout the country. In this case
the violence had more to do with xenophobia
than with racism and 


involved groups of
skinheads or néo-Nazis. At the same time
anti-semitism gained some ground, and
Jewish cemeteries were desecrated. Racism,
xenophobia and anti-semitism also had a
political impact as extrême right-wing groups
did well in élections. This breakthrough was
not however followed up in élections in the
mid-1990s.
In Italy, whose traditional non-racist cre-
dentials include the reluctance of the fascist
régime to take its eue from Nazi anti-semi¬
tism, racism has been a subject of concern to
the média and intellectuals since the early
1990s. Racism exists on a very limited scale in
what was for many years a country of émi¬
gration but has now become a country of
immigration. It mainly consists of social ten¬
sions due to dislocation of the urban fabric
where there are large numbers of immigrants,

grants on the clandestine job market, in door-
to-door trading or in illégal trafficking, espe-

cially in drugs. It gets more exposure in the
média than in politics. Anti-immigrant racism
was only a minor plank in the platform of the
populist Leagues of northern Italy during
their ascendancy in the early 1990s. It would
be misleading to compare thèse movements
with the French Front National, for instance.
In Belgium, on the other hand, racism is
above ail political and institutional. There is
very little violence, but extrême right-wing
parties are growing, especially the Flemish
Vlaams Blok party, whose focus on intercom-
munity différences is largely shaped by the
crisis of the state and Belgian national identity
as well as by tensions between the Flemish and
Walloon communities and Brussels.
This review of the situation in individual
European countries could be taken further.
The essential point, however, is that we are
dealing with a problem whose common fea¬
tures transcend différences in the ways in
In the early î970Sf the situation altered radically. The idea that
change would lead towards more growth and democracy and less
poverty and racism began to run out of steam.

which racism, xenophobia and antisemitism
are expressed.
Crumbling Structures
Throughout Western Europe the structure of
situations that had been relatively stable until
the 1970s is tending to change. European
societies were industrial societies with strong
labour movements that played a central rôle
in social, political, cultural and intellectual life.
Now thèse societies hâve entered the post-
industrial era and their labour movements
hâve split up and atrophied. They hâve lost
the power to set the agenda of debate on the
main social and political issues. Germany is no
exception to this rule. Reunification posed
serions problems to the German unions,
which had stood up to the crisis in trade
unionism more successfully than their coun-
terparts elsewhere 


in Europe.
The problems of exclusion and social and
économie polarization hâve become a major
source of concern, and racism has found a
new breeding ground. On the one hand the

change or afraid of becoming so, regard

immigrants as scapegoats. They act as if their
own exclusion and social décline were the
fault of immigrants, whose situation, more-
over, they often share. On the other hand,
people on the "right" side of the social divide
act individually or coUectively in ways that
amount to building social and racial barriers
to keep at arm's length the "dangerous"
classes, to which the immigrants are widely
considered to belong.
Throughout this century the European
nations hâve developed welfare-state policies
in an attempt to promote equality of oppor-
tunity and the redistribution of social
resources. Thèse policies hâve been under
fire since the 1970s, primarily for économie
reasons. The intensification of market com¬
pétition combined with the globalization of
the economy and the internationalization of
business are increasing the cost of welfare
policies to a prohibitive degree, especially at a
time when the ranks of the unemployed are
swelling and society is ageing.
In thèse circumstances, neo-liberalism
made constant headway during the 1980s
while social democrat-style approaches fell
by the wayside. This explains the resentment
and in many cases the populism of those who
feel abandoned by the state and ignored and
betrayed by the politicians. Once again thèse
people think that they lose out to the immi¬
grants, who abuse public institutions to the
détriment of native-born citizens.
The question of identity has been a major
préoccupation in Europe since the 1970s.

the other, manifestations of a tense and anx-
ious nationalism hâve reflected varying
degrees of xenophobia and racism and hâve
been more intent on isolating nations from
the outside world than opening them up to
the universalist values of reason and democ¬
racy. Thèse forms of nationalism usually
reflect the feeling that national identity or cul¬
ture are threatened. They accuse Jews and
Gypsies, as well as immigrants, with being the
perpetrators of a cultural invasion, and they
point to the intransigent nature of their cul¬
ture or religion. In this situation, racism
becomes cultural.
A sombre outlook
This leads us to the hypothesis that we hâve
entered a new era of European racism, con¬



current with the triumph of modernity. It
may take the form of a universalism that
sought to subjugate colonized peoples and
destroy them if they resisted, or to dominate
and exploit them whilst allowing them to join
the mareh of progress via the back door. It
may take the form of a "differentialism" that
regarded the Jews in particular as the symbol
of the most controversial aspects of moder
nity the cosmopolitanism of money and
power, and even socialism and révolution.
Racism and anti-semitism faded into the
background with the formation of national
political frameworks which created the condi¬
tions, especially through éducation, for éco¬
nomie modernization and industrialization,
expansion and cultural intégration. Today thèse
frameworks are disintegrating. Economie
activity is taking place in an international con-
text and more often than not seems at odds
with the nation-state; institutions are col-
lapsing; racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism
are re-emerging in societies that find it increas-
ingly difficult to connect the values of reason
and économie progress with those of cultural
and national individuality.

Racism and
anti-racism by Etienne Balibar
The strangely
ambiguous
relationship
between two
incompatible
ideas

Libre Parole (28 October
1893), an anti-Semltic dally
founded in Paris In 1892.
Above right, a French
explorer at a time when
European colonlalist powers
were engaged In "the scramble
for Africa". (Newspaper
illustration, 9 July 1892).
jf'i' The term "racism" seems to hâve been
' i introduced into the English language in
1938 in a translation of a book by the German
writer Magnus Hirschfeld which had appeared
in German four or five years earlier and
described the "racial theory" that underlay
Hitler's conception of a war between races. The
word thus seems to hâve been coined in Ger¬
many to describe the racism of the Nazi state,
which was targeted primarily against the Jews
but also against other "sub-human" peoples and
groups and was based on the Aryan myth. In
due course it came to acquire its internationally
accepted meaning as a préjudice based on belief
in the congénital inequality of human groups.
Pierre-André Taguieff, a French philoso¬
pher who has made an exhaustive study of the
question, has discovered what he calls two
"totally distinct appearances" of the word
"racism" in France. The first, relatively
episodic use of the word occurred between
1895 and 1897 and was connected with the
founding of the authoritarian ultra-nationalist
organization. Action Française, and of an
extrême right-wing nationalist newspaper, La
Libre Parole. The supporters of this move
ment, which actively propagated anti-semitism
in France and also had close ties with colonial
circles, described themselves as "racists", rep¬
résentatives of a "French race" that was to be
preserved from degeneration. Then, between
1925 and 1935 the terms "racisme" and "raciste"
made a come-back in France but this time were
used in a broader sensé to designate the doc¬
trine of German fascism, and to translate its key
adjective, "vôlkisch".
After the Second World War this second
meaning and the accepted English usage of the
word racism came to overlap. But in France
the référence to nationalism was still of déci¬
sive importance, for attempts to stigmatize
German-style "racism" were entirely orga¬
nized around its différence from French-style
"nationalism". The latter was presented as
"universalist" and was regarded as having a
"cultural" basis that was quite alien to the Ger¬
manie "naturalist" tradition, propped up by
belief in the supposed biological immutability
of "races". An ideology based on xenophobia
and essentialism may thus lie at the roots of
antiracism in France.

### 102558: Racism and anti-racism

An ambivalent doctrine
This reasoning, which I hâve hère simplified to
an extrême degree, has shown up the ambiva¬
lence which may to some extent be character-
istic of both anti-racist and racist thinking. The
ambivalence of racism is manifest in the fact that
it is based both on idealization of oneself
("master race") and on denigration of others as
"degenerate", "sub-human" or "primitive". It
also appears in the relationship of racism to uni¬
versalism. Racism which heightens in a quasi-
mystical fashion the illusion of the absolute
uniqueness and superiority of a nation or group
of nations that believe themselves to hâve been
"chosen" paradoxically coïncides with univer¬
salism when it attempts to set this supremacy
in a context of universal history or natural évo¬
lution of ail humanity.
It should not be surprising, then, that anti¬
racism, which also exists in the context of
nationalism the dominant state ideology of
our era should sometimes manifest a sim-
ilar ambivalence. What is true of the French
condemnation of "German racism" in a cli-

mate of nationalistic revenge is equally true of
the condemnation of Nazism by the victors
of the Second World War and of the con¬
demnation of colonial racism by certain
national libération movements.
The notion of "race" has such a wide range
of meanings that it can be used in many dif¬
férent contexts. "Races" do not exist, but the
word "race" has been for an entire âge the pivot
of a vision of history and a confrontation
between différent outlooks on the world.
While the meaning of certain words may hâve
shifted as historical circumstances hâve
changed, thèse changes of meaning hâve arisen Cortés Arriving in Vera Cruz

### 102558: Racism and anti-racism

HIstorically speaking, there Is not a 


single racism but several
successive ideological configurations, boundup with tbe confllcts
of cultures and violent political practices.
This questioning may seem to hâve disap¬
peared today but in ail likelihood it has only
moved to différent terms.
The origins of
modem racism
The history and critique of "racism" hâve lost
their innocence. Since they are themselves
historically and ideologically determined, they
must face the blinding and retaliatory effects of
the very language they use.
At the time when a standard définition of
racism was taking shape, two important
debates were underway. One centred on the
relationship between "racism" and "anti¬
semitism", the other on the circumstances in
which the specifically modem form of
"racism" emerged. The first debate is far from
over, but the second has given rise to a broad
consensus that modem racism emerged in the
late fifteenth century around the time when
the Americas were "discovered". This was the
starting point of the Europeanization of the
world, and also of the formation of absolute
monarchies (embryonic national states), the
secularization of anti-semitism and the taming
of aristocracies that would develop the ide¬
ology of the "purity of blood".
I am tempted to adopt the methodology
of the current debate about the notion of
"racism". A single racism did not appear in
the West at one moment in history and dis-
appear at another. There are several succes¬
sive ideological configurations, closely bound
up with conflicts between cultures and with
the political practice of violence (particularly
state violence). Each of thèse configurations
expresses the tensions and internai antago-
nisms of a far-reaching attempt to achieve
world domination: the Roman Empire,
Christianity, European expansion, nation¬
alism, the global market and, tomorrow per-
haps, the "new international order".
Each configuration leaves a trace that goes
into the makeup of a new "racism", which is
thus always a "neo-racism". Thus there hâve
been transitions from theological anti-
Judaism to secular anti-semitism, from bio¬
logical racism to cultural racism, and from
colonial violence to post-colonial discrimina¬
tion against people from the "South".
Whether we like it or not, this is probably
due to the fact that schemes for domination
and discrimination (internai exclusion) are
powerful tools for the identification of one¬
self and others, and thus of historical and col¬
lective memory.
The ambivalences and theoretical weak-
nesses of anti-racism obviously do not cast
doubt on the need to combat racism. Just as
the fluctuations of racist doctrine justifying
discrimination and ségrégation cannot con-
ceal the similarities between ail thèse prac¬
tices, so the continuity of anti-racism in every
era is based on a perception of the intolérable
inhumanity of racism and on its patent
incompatibility with freedom.

^ffl+. States was primarily a struggle for liberty,
not equality. It sought to dismantle the System
of officiai ségrégation that had been erected in
the aftermath of slavery and to secure full rights
of citizenship for African Americans. The
abiding faith of the movement was that once
the walls of ségrégation came tumbling down,
blacks would be free to assume their rightful
place in American society.
No sooner were the historié Civil Rights
Acts of 1964 and 1965 passed, however, than
it became clear that législation alone would
not address the deep-seated inequalities that
were the legacy of two centuries of slavery
and another century of Jim Crow. This was
acknowledged by Président Lyndon Johnson
in a commencement address at Howard Uni¬
versity in Washington, D.C., in June 1965, the
very month that the Voting Rights Act
received Congressional approval. As he told
the graduating class:

'You are free to compete with ail the others,'
and still justly believe that you hâve been
completely fair. We seek not just freedom but
opportunity, not just equality as a right and a
theory but equality as a fact and as a resuit."
Passive and active policies
Johnson's oratory was punctuated by the out-
break of racial violence in the Watts section of
Los Angeles only two months later. In the
ensuing years there were scores of other
"riots" that threw American society into a
deep political crisis, one that forced the nation
to confront the issue of equality as well as lib¬
erty. This is the historical context in which
affirmative action evolved as national policy.
Affirmative action has never been formu-
lated as a cohérent policy, but evolved incre-
mentally through a séries of presidential exec¬
utive orders, administrative policies and
court décisions. Partly for this reason, the
term itself is so fraught with ambiguity that it
is not always clear what advocates and oppo-
nents are squabbling about. Let us therefore
make several crucial distinctions.
First, affirmative action must be distin-
guished from policies of non-discrimination.
Although both seek racial justice in the work¬
piace, policies of non-discrimination merely
enjoin employers not to practise discrimina¬
tion in the recruitment, hiring and promotion
of workers. It is essentially a passive injunc-
tion not to discriminate. Affirmative action,
on the other hand, commits employers to go
a décisive step beyond non-discrimination
and to actively seek out protected groups in
employment. In this form essentially "out-
reach" programmes reliant on the good faith
efforts of employers affirmative action
arouses little or no opposition.
There is another form of affirmative action,
however, that goes a décisive step beyond out-
reach and involves granting "préférence" to
minority applicants in order to guarantee the
desired resuit. This is where controversy
begins. For example, in his confirmation hear-
ings to the Suprême Court in 1991, Clarence
Thomas spoke passionately of his support for
outreach programmes to extend opportunity
to women and minorities, but he was equally
adamant in his opposition to affirmative action
programmes that involve préférence.
Thèse three forms of anti-discrimination
are not mère abstractions, but are anchored
in history. Let us briefly review how social
policy evolved from non-discrimination, to
outreach, to préférence.
Occupational apartlieid
Africans were originally imported to the
United States to provide labour in the South 's
evolving plantation economy. In the century
after slavery, when tens of millions of immi¬
grants from Europe were rapidly absorbed
into the North's burgeoning industries, a
colour line excluded blacks from employ¬
ment in the entire industrial sector, with the
exception of a few menial and low-paying
jobs. When the Southern economy finally
underwent modernization, blacks were still
confined to "negro jobs" servile and unde-
sirable jobs that were reminiscent of slavery
itself. As late as the 1960s, even as the civil
rights movement reached its triumphant
climax, the United States had, in effect, a
System of occupational apartheid that
excluded blacks from entire job sectors. Most
black men worked as unskilled labourers;
most black women as low-level service
workers, especially domestics.

### 102559: The Affirmative action debate

This racial division of labour went virtu¬
ally unchallenged until the Second World
War, when the black union leader A. Philip
Randolph threatened a mareh on Washington
unless blacks were given access to jobs in
defence industries. This also led to the estab¬
lishment of a Fair Employment Practices
Committee. Even though the FEPC had few
resources and virtually no power to enforce
non-discrimination, it was quickly engulfed
in controversy and disbanded as soon as the
war was over. Hère was an early sign that
attempts to enforce compliance with non-
discriminatory policies would encounter
enormous résistance.
In the 1940s and 1950s a second FEPC,
along with other fédéral and state agencies,
preached non-discrimination, but with
meagre results at best. Indeed, this is pre-
cisely what eventually led to a 


shift from non-
discrimination to affirmative action. A major
turning point occurred in 1961 when Prési¬
dent John F. Kennedy, again in response to
rising protest from the black community,
issued Executive Order 10925, which
required fédéral contractors to take "affirma¬
tive action" to desegregate their work force.
Unlike similar déclarations in the past, the
presidential edict established spécifie sanc-
LITTLE R,0<^CEMTRJ
tions, including termination of contract, to be
applied against contractors who were not in
compliance. Three years later Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act proscribed employ¬
ment discrimination on the basis of race,
colour, religion, sex or national origin. A year
later Président Johnson issued Executive
Order 1 1246 that put further teeth into affir¬
mative action by requiring fédéral contrac¬
tors to develop spécifie goals and timetables

for increasing the employment of women
and minorities.
Corporate inertia
One might think that thèse developments
would hâve dealt a fatal blow to America's
System of occupational apartheid. This was
hardly the case. In 1973 nine years after the
passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act a télé¬
phone Company which was the nation's largest
corporate employer and a major government
contractor still had a highly segregated work¬
force. The Company employed 165,000 per-
sons in low-paying operator classifications
99.9 per cent of whom were female. Of
190,000 higher-paying craft workers, 99 per
cent were maie. Virtually no women were in
management positions, and even supervisory
personnel in "female" departments were maie.
The Company, furthermore, could boast
of "equal opportunity" policies that had
increased black employment from 2.5 per
cent in 1960 to 10 per cent in 1970, but this
mainly reflected the hiring of black women
as operators to replace white women who
were experiencing a high rate of turnover.
There were virtually no black maies in craft
jobs and even fewer in management. This was
the context in which the Fédéral Communi¬
cations Commission opposed a rate increase
on the grounds of the company's discrimina-
tory employment practices.
Eventually this resulted in a landmark
consent decree with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the
Department of Justice, and the Department

the consent decree, the programme got off to

short-term targets had been reached. Fur¬
thermore, thèse gains occurred in the context
of a declining labour force due to the impact

Wliat's at stalte
As this case illustrâtes, good-faith efforts to
increase minority représentation were gener-
ally ineffective until they were backed up by
spécifie "goals and timetables" that, in effect,
gave préférence to minority applicants who
met basic qualifications but might not hâve
been 


hired or promoted without affirmative
action mandates. Critics, of course, complain
that this amounts to a System of de facto
quotas. Like Clarence Thomas, they raise no
objection to affirmative action so long as it
involves "outreach", but reject affirmative
action as soon as it involves "préférence".
What thèse critics overlook, however, is
that décades of preaching non-discrimination
produced little or no change in the System of
occupational apartheid. Indeed, this is why
affirmative policy shifted from outreach to
préférence in the first place.
Unfortunately, no systematic body of évi¬
dence exists that would permit a précise
accounting of what has been achieved under
affirmative action. This much is clear, how-

ever: the occupational sphères where blacks
hâve made the most notable progress in
government service, in major blue-coUar
occupations, in corporate management, and
in the professions are ail areas where vig-
orous affirmative action programmes hâve
been in place over the past two décades.


Before affirmative action, the black middle
class consisted of a small number of profes¬
sionals and businessmen anchored in the
ghetto economy. Most of the progress that
we celebrate particularly the émergence of
a large black middle class with roots in main¬
stream économie structures is a direct
product of affirmative action.
Thus, much is at stake in the current
debate over the future of affirmative action.
In récent years there has been a rising chorus
of criticism against affirmative action pro¬
grammes, and it has not come only from
whites who feel that they are being asked to
pay the priée for crimes that they did not
commit. Criticism also has been levelled by
légal scholars who challenge the constitution-
ality of affirmative action and see it as
betraying the cardinal principle of the civil
rights movement itself: a colour-blind
society. A new genre of black conservatives
hâve denounced affirmative action as patron-
izing to blacks and subversive of black self-
esteem. Even some libérais who say they
support affirmative action in principle hâve
concluded that it is self-defeating because it
triggers a popular backlash that only serves
their political enemies.
Thèse are powerful arguments, based as
they are on légal and moral principles as well
as on political pragmatism. However, they fail
to recognize the lesson of history: that even
laws proscribing discrimination and well-
intentioned efforts to increase minority rep¬
résentation were never effective until they
were backed up with spécifie affirmative
action mandates.
Thus, the problem is stated falsely when it
is suggested that we must choose between
merit or préférence, or between the rights of
individuals and the rights of groups, or
betweeA a colour-blind or a colour-conscious
society. Rather, the paramount choice is
between racial progress or returning to the
status quo ante: the period before affirmative
action when we salved our national con¬
science with laws on the books that did little
or nothing to reverse centuries of occupa¬
tional apartheid.

### 102560: An Unscientific notion

A geneticist
explains why the
concept of race is
notvalidfor
human
populations
An unscientific notion
by Albert Jacquard
' jjsf- Racism is based on two assertions
?i 1 ''.. which are presented as facts. First, that
the human species is made up of very distinct
groups with différent biological characteris-
tics in other words, "races"; and second,
that thèse "races" can be ranked in hiérar¬
chies according to a scale of "values".
Thèse two propositions were laid down as
incontrovertible truths in a book that ail
French schoolchildren were given to read
during the first half of this century. Le Tour de
la France par Deux Enfants (A Tour of France
by Two Children). When the two children
visit Marseilles, they are surprised by the
diversity of people of every colour they
encounter there. This provides the author
with an opportunity to teach them about the
four human races white, red, yellow and
black and to make the following observation:
"The white race is the most perfect."
The author is careful to illustrate each race
with a very decent-looking individual. He
admits that each race is "perfect", but cannot
help establishing a hierarchy of perfection,
which is to the benefit of the white race.
The rôle of the scientist is to cast a rig-
orous, dispassionate eye on thèse two asser¬
tions and détermine the degree to which they
are fantasy or fact.
Defining race
Human beings display a variety which is at once
disturbing and marvellous. The task of science
is to try to make sensé of this chaotic situation
by proposing a classification. The most cele-
brated classification is that of the Swedish natu¬
ralist Linnaeus. He conceived of a tree whose
successive ramifications would mark the dis¬
tinction between two "kingdoms" (animal and
vegetable), then between several "classes"
within each kingdom (such as mammals in the
animal kingdom). Each class contained several
"orders" (carnivores, for example), each order
several "gênera" (such as the genus Canis), and
each genus several "species".
The dividing Unes between this séries of
catégories are often blurred and arbitrary,
except in the case of species, where an objec¬
tive criterion interfecundity makes it pos¬
sible to détermine whether two living créa¬
tures belong to the same species or not. In
other words, individuals are deemed to
belong to a single species if they are capable
of reproducing and obtaining fertile offspring.
Usually, however, a species comprises
such a large number of members that it is
tempting, and scientifically logical, to pursue
the classification process by defining rela¬
tively homogeneous groups within a given
species. Criteria need to be defined before
the dividing fines between thèse groups,
which are generally described as "races" or
"breeds" can be drawn.
It was not really until the eighteenth century
that scientists tried to introduce some sort of
order into the varions ideas that were being
peddled on the subject. They first needed to
specify the characteristics to be taken into
account when comparing individuals.
The characteristics concerned were natu-

%-5)#
rally visible ones, such as size, colour and shape.
Throughout the nineteenth century anthropol-
ogists squabbled over the number of races con¬
tained within the human species. The four tra¬
ditional races, which were based on skin colour,
were clearly inadéquate when it came to taking
into account the degree of variety involved.
Should humankind be divided up into ten, 100
or 1,000 races? The controversy might hâve
gone on raging for ever if the parameters of the
whole question had not been changed by the
sudden appearance of a new discipline: genetics.
From 1900 on, the rediscovery of con¬
cepts devised by the Austrian monk Gregor
Mendel (1822-1884) made scientists realize
that appearances, or "phenotypes", were the
manifestation of factors concealed in the
nuclei of cells: gènes. The combination of
gènes in any individual constitutes his or her
"génotype". Thus, parents pass on to their
children not a visible characteristic but half
the genetic inheritance that governs their
phenotype. They do not transmit what they
are, but half the mass of information that
allowed them to become what they are.
This meant that scientists had to go back
to square one. They realized that the only
comparison that makes it possible to appre-
hend the stable reality of a given population
is one that focuses on what it passes on with
each génération, in other words its genetic
inheritance, and not on appearances, which
are no more than a manifestation of it.
A faise genetic traii
The first thing scientists did was try to track
down "marker" gènes whose présence
would indicate that an individual belonged to
a given race. If ail members of a given popu¬
lation possessed a certain gène that was not
found elsewhere, things would be straight-
forward. But no such gènes hâve been found.
Most gènes are présent in virtually ail human

Schubert's Histoire Naturelle
du Règne >1n/ma/("Natural
History of the Animal
Kingdom"), published in
Germany in 1886.
Chromosomes (below), where
the gènes are located, are the
carriers of heredity.
populations. Some of them, probably as a
resuit of récent mutations, are found only in
certain populations, but even then they are
rare and do not qualify as marker gènes.
What distinguishes groups, then, is not the
présence or absence of a gène, but the fre-
quency of its occurrence. The B-gene of the
blood System accounts for 25 per cent of the
genetic inheritance of people who live in the
Indian sub-continent, but that proportion
decreases the fartherwest one goes: itis 15-20
per cent in Russia, 10-15 per cent in Central
Europe, 5 per cent in France and Britain, and
0 per cent in the Basque Country.
Any définition of race can therefore resuit
only from a logical process that allows for
such différences in frequency. The starting
point is a table which indicates, for ail popula¬
tions, the frequency of the greatest possible
number of gènes. Information now available
to us means that this line of reasoning can be
pursued with the help of a large mass of
observations. As part of this approach, popu¬
lations are regarded as belonging to one and
the same "race" when most of their gènes
occur with similar frequency.
If the problem is to be approached with
scientific rigour, a définition of genetic dis¬
tance between différent populations is
required. Once ail such distances between ail
populations hâve been calculated, it seems
logical enough to assume that populations

with a small distance between them belong to
the same race, and those with a great distance
between them belong to différent races.
If thèse populations are represented as
dots whose distance on paper is proportional
to their genetic distance, the resuit in the case
of dogs is shown in figure A (this page) where
each cluster of dots may be regarded as a
breed. On the other hand, if ail human popu¬
lations are represented, the resuit is not a
séries of very distinct clusters, but an indis¬
tinct haze of dots which cannot be put in
groups without an arbitrary élément coming
into play (figure B). It is true that populations
X and Y are genetically doser to each other
than they are to population Z, but it is impos¬
sible to know where to draw the dividing line.
There is only one conclusion to be drawn:
the concept of race is not valid for human
populations. There are obvions différences
between, for example, Lapps and Pygmies,
but the transition from the former to the
latter can be established via intermediate
populations without any abrupt leaps.
The reason why the concept is not valid is
well known. If a genetic inheritance is to
acquire a certain originality, if it is to distinguish
itself significantly from that of neighbouring
groups, it has to remain in complète isolation
for a very long period, or for roughly as many
générations as there are individuals of repro¬
ductive âge. That kind of isolation can exist in
the case of animais, but is barely conceivable for
a species as nomadic and as keenly curions as
ours. Because we are capable of crossing
mountain ranges and océans, we hâve homog-
enized our genetic inheritances.
That observation can be illustrated by the
following figures: the proportion of the total
genetic diversity of the human species that can
be put down to différences between the four
traditional "races" is only 7-8 per cent. In the
case of différences between nations within
thèse races, it is also only 7-8 per cent, while the
remaining 85 per cent is due to différences
between groups belonging to the same nation.
In other words, the essential différences are not
between groups, but contained within them.
The concept of race consequently has so little
content that the word becomes meaningless
and should be eradicated from our vocabulary.
From classification to liierarciiy
However arbitrary it may be, some sort of
classification is necessary. But, in Western
culture at least, a classification is often auto-
matically assumed to be the basis of a hier¬
archy: if two objects are not identical, they are
regarded as not being "equal", in which case
one is superior to the other. This automatic
assumption originates in primary school,
where we are taught that when two numbers
are différent one is bigger than the other.
What is true for numbers does not apply
when several sets of measurements are used.
In this case, the opposite of "equal" is not
"superior" but "différent". There can be a
hierarchical rank only when objects are
described by a single number. Thus one stone
will be heavier, or denser, or more voluminous
than another. It can be "superior" only if ail the
measurements are synthesized into one.
This is what some psychologists do when
they want to compare people's intellectual
potential. Some individuals can reason more
quickly, others hâve a more extensive

## [Page 25](102577engo.pdf#page=25) 0

### 102560: An Unscientific notion

memory, and others again ask more relevant
questions: they hâve différent mental pro¬
files. But the question "Who is the most intel¬
ligent" can only be answered if intelligence is
gauged by a single measurement. Hence the
success of the notorious "intelligence quo¬
tient" or IQ. In fact it measures nothing def-
inite, but enables people to talk as though a
hierarchy of intelligence existed.
Différent human groups hâve varying
potentials in every field. Whether innately or
thanks to their culture, Pygmies are better
equipped to solve the problems posed by
living in an equatorial rain forest than Lapps,
who know better how to cope with Arctic
cold. The two populations are différent; nei¬
ther is superior to the other.
Unfortunately, our minds hâve been
impregnated with a belief in that kind of hier¬
archy, which is reflected in turns of phrase
that are so familiar to us that we take their
meaning for granted. Thus we accept the idea
that breeders hâve "improved" the equlne
race, whereas in fact ail they hâve donc is
improve the racing abilities of certain stock, at
the cost of a spectacular décline in their bio¬
logical potential. Such "thoroughbreds" are in
fact defective animais whose only achieve-
ment one of little interest is their ability to
run fast over short distances.
The phrase I used about the "white race"
being "the most perfect" is not even a fallacy:
it is meaningless. But it is much harder to
combat such assertions, which are meaning¬
less, than it is to combat inaccuracies.
That is why the fight against racism may
well go on for ever. It matters not that the
geneticist can prove that the notion of race is
without foundation or that the logician can
demonstrate the absurdity of global hiérarchies.
The racist's attitude will not change one iota
because when it comes down to it that attitude
has nothing to do with biological reality or logic.
An expression of contempt
What racism expresses is essentially con¬
tempt contempt for other people that is
motivated not by their characteristics as such
but by the fact that they belong to a group.
Hence remarks such as "Ail . . . are . . .". What
prompts such contempt is a lack of self-confi¬
dence, and its end-product is self-destruction.
What are human beings if not animais
whose peculiar characteristic is to be able to
construct themselves with the help of
others? My "I" has emerged from the "yous"
that hâve been addressed to me. "I" is made
up of a web of links I weave with others.
But the weaving of those links cannot take
place unless efforts are made and fears quelled.
Other people are a source of both riches and
risks. We hâve to confront them, that is to say
tackle them head on and set intelligence against
intelligence. The exchange will be fruitful only
if a modicum of confidence exists both self-
confidence and confidence in others.
Racists are people who hâve no self-confi¬
dence. To disguise their fear, they puff them¬
selves up and daim to be superior. Their con¬
tempt for others only serves to mask the panic
their own inner emptiness inspires in them.
It is easy to prove that the notion of race in
the case of human beings is virtually impossible
to define, or that the concept of hierarchy
cannot be used in a global way. But the most
useful contribution science can make to the
fight against racism lies elsewhere in a greater
awareness of what a human being is: a won-
derful thing which each individual builds with
the help of others.

### 102561: Beneath the dark sun of racism...': Elias Canetti, an imaginary interview

'Beneath the dark sun of racism. . . '
Elias Canetti
An ima^inary interview by Edgar Reichmann
Elias Canetti In 1983.
The novelist, dramatist and philosopher Elias Canetti (1905-
1994), who wrote in German, was born at Ruschuk in Bulgaria.
His parents were Sephardim, Jews of Spanish origin. In 1981,
when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the
Swedish Academy noted that the characteristic features of his
work are "a satirical bite in the observation of people's
behaviour, a loathingof wars and dévastation, bitterness at
the thought of life's brevity". This imaginary interview has
been composed by writer and journalist Edgar Reichmann
using extracts from Canetti's work.
EDGAR REICHMANN
is a novelist and literary critic. His
most récent novel, Nous n'Irons
plus à Sils Maria, was published
earlier this year by Denoêl, Paris.
You left us on 14 August 1994. Where did
you come into the world?
Elias Canetti: I was born at the beginning of the
century at Ruschuk on the Bulgarian bank of the
Danube. It was a marvellous city for a child.
People of the most varied backgrounds lived
there, and on any one day you could hear seven
or eight languages. As well as the Bulgarians, there
were Turks, Greeks, Jews, Albanians, Arme-
nians, Gypsies and Romanians who came from
the opposite side of the Danube. I lived with my
parents and my two brothers in the neighbour¬
hood of the Sephardim, the Spanish Jews, where
my father had a successful business.
The looming threat of war led your family
to emigrate to England. Your father died when
you were living in Manchester in 1912.
E. C.:lt was a terrible shock and in a way I never
got over it. Someone who has been exposed to
death too soon can never rid himself of it. It is a
wound which becomes a kind of lung through
which one breathes.
But you try to use remembrance as a kind
of counterweight to death. . .
E. C: One must visit the dead and localize them;
otherwise they slip away with astonishing speed.
As soon as you join them in their proper place,
they return to life. In a flash, you remember
everything you thought you had forgotten
about them, you hear their words, stroke their
hair and see your reflection in the brightness of
their gaze. Once upon a time you might never
hâve been quite sure of the colour of their eyes;
now you recognize it immediately. Perhaps
everything in them is more intense than when
they were alive; perhaps the dead await com¬
plète self-fulfilment in the résurrection that one
of those they hâve left behind will offer them.
Then you left England. . .
E. C: In 1913 I left with my mother for Vienna,
then we moved to Zurich and at the end of the
Great War to Frankfurt, where I passed my
school certificate. After learning English, I
learned German, which became my second
mother tongue and the language in which I
wrote. I went back to Vienna to study chem-
istry. I was very excited by the intellectual fer¬
ment in the capital of the former Austro-Hun-
garian empire. It was there, in 1924, that I met

ten years later. In 1928 I went for the fîrst time
to Berlin, where the artistic and cultural life was
just as intense as it was in Vienna.
But intolérance was also rife at this time.
The rise of totalitarianism had begun. This
climate is reflected in your writing.
£ C.;My first play, Hochzeit ("The Wedding"),
which I wrote in 1932, is not based on a model. It
stands on its own. The way in which the charac-
ters express themselves reveals ail kinds of tur-
moil and none 


of them grasps what the others
want to say. The lack of communication is total.
Komôdie der Eitelkeit ("Comedy of Vanity") was
written in 1934 beneath the dark sun of the
tragedy that was unfolding in Germany. At the
end of January Hitler came to power. From then
on every event bore its load of anguish. In 1925 I
began to try to find out the meaning of the con¬
cept of the crowd, how crowds functioned and,
later, how power sprang from crowds. When the
madness that was later to become all-consuming
took control of the heart of Europe I felt the need
to understand this even more strongly.
In 1925 I began to try to find out tbe meaning of the concept of
the crowd, how crowds functioned and, later, how power sprang
from crowds.
while books were being burned in Berlin, I
was writing my metaphor-novel, originally enti-
ded Kantfdngt Feuer ("Kant takes fire") and later
Die Blendung ("The Blinding"). In it I tried to
expose the narcissistic verbiage of the mandarins
who were incapable of foreseeing the horror that
would soon destroy them or force them into exile.
The book was rejected by Austrian publishers and
first appeared in a Czech translation. After the war
it was published in English as Auto-da-fé.
Then came your key work, Crowds and
Power, essential reading for anyone who
wants to understand the twentieth century.

with the rise of Nazism. I concentrated on
threats 


of war in the hope that I would be able to
dissipate them.
After my mother's death in 1937, an event
that prostrated me, I returned to Vienna. A year
later I saw Hitler's troops enter the city. I stayed
there a few more months in order to observe
the horror at close quarters and to understand
more about how the crowd functioned.
Men's feeling for their own increase has
always been strong. The large numbers of the
herds they hunted blended in their feelings with
their own numbers which they wished to be
large. They expressed this feeling in a spécifie
state of communal excitement which I call the
rhythmic or throhbing crowd.
Their excitement grows and reaches frenzy,
until they are ail doing the same thing. They ail
swing their arms to and fro, and shake their
heads. In the end, there appears to be a single
créature dancing, a créature with fifty heads and
a hundred legs and arms, ail acting in exactly the
same way and with the same purpose. When
their excitement is at its height, thèse people
really feel as one, and nothing but physical
exhaustion can stop them.
The fact that wars can last so long and may
be carried on well after they hâve been lost
arises from the deep urge of the crowd not to
disintegrate; to remain a crowd. This feeling is
sometimes so strong that people prefer to
perish together with open eyes rather than
acknowledge defeat and thus expérience the dis-
integration of their own crowd.
What suddeniy créâtes this uncanny
cohésion?
E. C: The phenomenon is so mysterious that it
must be approached with a measure of caution.
People décide that they are threatened with
physical destruction and proclaim the fact pub-
licly to the whole world. They say "I can be
killed", and secretly add "because I myself I
want to kill this or that man." The stress prop-
erly belongs on the second half of this sentence.
It should run: "I want to kill this or that man.
therefore I can be killed myself." But when it is
a question of a war starting, of its éruption and
the awakening of a bellicose spirit, the first ver¬
sion will be the only one openly admitted. Even
if in fact the aggressor, each side will always
attempt to prove that it is threatened.
What is the place of the individual survival
instinct during thèse deadly confrontations?
E. C: Death, which threatens every individual at
every moment, must hâve been proclaimed as a
collective sentence before people will oppose it
actively. There are, as it were, declared times of
death, times when it turns on a definite, arbitrarily
selected group as a whole. It is "Death to the
French" or "Death to the English." The enthu-
siasm with which people accept such déclarations
has its root in the individual's cowardice before
death; no one likes facing it alone. The death that
thousands approach together is entirely différent.
The worst that can happen to men in war is to
perish together; and this spares them death as indi¬
viduals, which is what they most fear.
Where does force come into ail this? You
make a distinction between force and power.
E. C: The word "force" suggests something
close and immédiate in its effect, something
more directly compelling than power. When
force gives itself time in which to operate it
becomes power. The distinction between force
and power can be illustrated very simply by the
relationship between cat and mouse. The cat
uses force to catch the mouse, but while it is
playing with its prey another factor is présent. It
lets it go, allows it to run about a little, and during
this time the mouse is no longer subjected to

### 102562: Race, history and culture

Race, history and culture
by Claude Lévi-Strauss
Oneoftheworld's
leading
anthropologists, Claude
Lévi-Strauss twice set
forth his ideas on
racism for Unesco, first
\n Race and History
(1952) and later in
Race and Culture
(1971). On the
following pages we
publish long extracts
from thèse two
important studies.
The development of human life is not everywhere
the same but rather takes form in an extraordinary
diversity of societies and civilizations. This intel¬
lectual, aesthetic and sociological diversity is in no
way the outcome of the biological différences, in
certain observable features, between différent
groups of men; it is simply a parallel phenomenon
in a différent sphère. But, at the same time, we
must note two important respects in which there
is a sharp distinction. First, the order of magnitude
is différent. There are many more human cultures
than human races, since the first are to be counted
in thousands and the second in single units. . . .
Second, in contrast to the diversity of races, where
interest is confined to their historical origin or their
distribution over the face of the world, the diver¬
sity of cultures gives rise to many problems; it may
be wondered whether it is an advantage or a disad-
vantage for human kind	
Last and most important, the nature of the
diversity must be investigated even at the risk of
allowing the racial préjudices whose biological
foundation has so lately been destroyed to
develop again on new grounds. . . . We cannot
therefore claim to hâve formulated a convincing
déniai of the inequality of the human races, so
long as we fail to consider the problem of the
inequality or diversity of human cultures,
which is in fact however unjustifiably closely
associated with it in the public mind	
Collaboration between cultures

strategy. Number and diversity: a comparison of
the Old World with the New on the eve of the
latter's discovery [in 1492] provides a good illus¬
tration of the need for thèse two factors.
Europe at the beginning of the Renaissance
was the meeting-place and melting-pot of the
most diverse influences: the Greek, Roman,
Germanie and Anglo-Saxon traditions combined
with the influences of Arabia and China. Pre-
Columbian America enjoyed no fewer cultural
contacts, quantitatively speaking, as the various
American cultures maintained relations with one
another and the two Americas together represent
a whole hémisphère. But, while the cultures
which were cross-fertilizing each other in Europe
had resulted from differentiation dating back sev¬
eral tens of thousands of years, those on the more
recently occupied American continent had had
less time to develop divergencies; the picture
they offered was relatively homogeneous. Thus,
although it would not be true to say that the cul¬
tural standard of Mexico or Peru was [in 1492]
inferior to that of Europe at the time of the dis¬
covery (we hâve in fact seen that, in some
respects, it was superior), the various aspects of
culture were possibly less well organized in rela¬
tion to each other. . . . Their organization, less
flexible and diversified, probably explains their
collapse before a handful of conquerors. And the
underlying reason for this may be sought in the
fact that the partners to the American cultural
"coahtion" were less dissimilar from one another
than their counterparts in the Old World.
No society is therefore essentially and intrin-
sically cumulative. Cumulative history is not the
prérogative of certain races or certain cultures,
marking them off from the rest. It is the resuit of
their conduct rather than their nature. It repre-
sents a certain "way of life" of cultures which
dépends on their capacity to "go along together".
In this sensé, it may be said that cumulative his¬
tory is the type of history characteristic of
grouped societies social super-organisms
while stationary history (supposing it to exist)
would be the distinguishing feature of an inferior
form of social life, the isolated society.
The one real calamity, the one fatal flaw which
can afflict a human group and prevent it from
achieving fulfilment is to be alone.
We can thus see how clumsy and intellectu-
ally unsatisfactory the generally accepted efforts
to défend the contributions of various human

races and cultures to civilization often are. We list
features, we sift questions of origin, we allot first
places. However well-intentioned they may be,
thèse efforts serve no purpose for, in three
respects, they miss their aim.
In the first place, there can never be any cer-
tainty about a particular culture's crédit for an
invention or discovery. ... In the second place, ail
cultural contributions can be divided into two
groups. On the one hand we hâve isolated acqui¬
sitions or features, whose importance is évident
but which are also somewhat limited. . . . At the
other end of the scale (with a whole séries of
intermediates, of course), there are systematized
contributions, representing the peculiar form in
which each society has chosen to express and sat¬
isfy the generahty of human aspirations. There is
no denying the originality and particularity of
thèse patterns, but, as they ail represent the exclu¬
sive choice of a single group, it is difficult to see
how one civilization can hope to benefit from the
way of life of another, unless it is prepared to
renounce its own individuality. Attempted com¬
promises are, in fact, Hkely to produce only two

results: either the disorganization and collapse of
the pattern of one of the groups; or a new combi¬
nation, which then, however, represents the
émergence of a third pattern, and cannot be
assimilated to either of the others. The question
with which we are concerned, indeed, is not to
discover whether or not a society can dérive ben-
efit from the way of life of its neighbours, but
whether, and if so to what extent, it can succeed in
understanding or even in knowing them. . . .

World civilization
Finally, wherever a contribution is made, there
must be a récipient. But, while there are in fact
real cultures which can be localized in time and
space, and which may be said to hâve "con-
tributed" and to be continuing their contribu¬
tions, what can this "world civilization" be, which
is supposed to be the récipient of ail thèse contri¬
butions? It is not a civilization distinct from ail the
others, and yet real in the same sensé that they
are. . . . [It is] an abstract conception, to which we
attribute a moral or logical significance moral, if
we are thinking of an aira to be pursued by
existing societies; logical, if we are using the one
term to cover the common features which
analysis may reveal in the différent cultures. In
both cases, we must not shut our eyes to the fact
that the concept of world civilization is very
sketchy and imperfect, and that its intellectual and
emotional content is tenuous. To attempt to
assess cultural contributions with ail the weight
of countless centuries behind them . . . by référ¬
ence to the sole yardstick of a world civilization
which is still a hollow shell, would be greatly to
impoverish them, draining away their life-blood
and leaving nothing but the bare bones behind.
. . . The true contribution of a culture consists,
not in the list of inventions which it has personally
produced, but in its différence from others. The
sensé of gratitude and respect which each single
member of a given 


culture can and should feel
towards ail others can only be based on the con¬
viction that the other cultures differ from his own
in countless ways. . . .
We hâve taken the notion of world civilization
as a sort of limiting concept or as an epitome of a
highly complex process. If our arguments are
vahd, there is not, and never can be, a world civi¬
lization in the absolute sensé in which that term is
often used, since civilization implies, and indeed
consists in, the coexistence of cultures exhibiting
the maximum possible diversities. A world civi¬
lization could, in fact, represent no more than a
worldwide coalition of cultures, each of which
would préserve its own originality.

### 102562: Race, history and culture

[In 1952,] in a booklet written for UNESCO, I sug¬
gested the concept of "coahtion" to explain why
isolated cultures could not hope to create single-
handed the conditions necessary for a truly
cumulative 


history. To achieve this, I said, dif¬
férent cultures must, voluntarily or involuntarily,
combine their respective stakes in the great game
of history, to increase their chances of making
that long run of winning plays by which history
progresses. Geneticists are at présent [1971]
putting forward very similar views on biological
évolution, in pointing out that a génome is in
reality a System within which certain gènes func-
tion as regulators and others act in concert on a
single characteristic (or the contrary, if several
characteristics dépend on a single gène). What is
true of the individual génome is also true of a
population, in which the combination of a
number of genetic inheritances in which until
recently a "racial type" would hâve been identi-
fied must always be such as to allow the estab¬
lishment of an optimum equilibrium and
improve the group 's chances of survival. In this
sensé, it might be said that in the history of popu¬
lations, genetic recombination plays a part com¬
parable to that played by cultural recombination
in the évolution of the ways of life, techniques,
knowledge and beliefs by which différent soci¬
eties are distinguished	
The nature-culture debate
[But] one fact cannot be too strongly emphasized:
while sélection makes it possible for living species
to adapt to their natural environment or to resist
its changes more effectively, in the case of man
this environment ceases to be natural in any real
sensé. Its characteristics arise from technical, éco¬
nomie, social and psychological conditions
which, through the opération of culture, create a
particular environment for each human group.
We can go a step further, and consider whether
the relation between organic évolution and cul¬
tural évolution is not merely analogical, but also
complementary	
In the dawn of humanity, biological évolution
perhaps selected such pre-cultural traits as
upright posture, manual dexterity, sociability, the
capacity to think in symbols, speech and the
abihty to communicate. But once a culture

existed, thèse traits were consoHdated and prop¬
agated by cultural factors. When cultures became
specialized, it was again cultural factors which
Consolidated and encouraged other traits, such as
résistance to heat or cold for those societies
which had willy-nilly to adapt themselves to
extrême cUmatic conditions; aggressive or con¬
templative dispositions, technical ingenuity etc.
None of thèse traits, as perceived at a cultural
level, can clearly be attributed to a genetic basis,
although we cannot exclude the possibility that
such a connexion even if partial, remote and
indirect may sometimes exist. In that case, it
would be true to say that every culture sélects
genetic aptitudes which then, by reflex action,
influence those cultures by which they were at
first stimulated.
An Ideological cover
By pushing back the earliest beginnings of
humanity to an ever more remote past
according to récent estimâtes, some millions of
years ago physical anthropology has under-
mined one of the principal bases for racialist
theory, since the number of unknowable factors
concerned thus increases much more rapidly
than the number of landmarks available to stake
out the paths followed by our earhest ancestors
in the course of their évolution.
Geneticists delivered even more décisive blows
to thèse théories when they replaced the concept
of type by that of population and the concept of
race by that of the genetic stock, and again when
they demonstrated that there is a gulf between
hereditary différences attributable to a single gène
which are of little significance from the point of
view of race, since they probably always hâve an
adaptive value and those attributable to the com¬
bined action of several, which makes it virtually
impossible to détermine them. . . .
Only in the last ten years hâve we begun to
understand that we were discussing the problem
of the relation between organic and cultural évolu¬
tion in terms which Auguste Comte would hâve
described as metaphysical. Human évolution is
not a by-product of biological évolution, but nei¬
ther is it completely distinct from it. A synthesis
of thèse two traditional points of view is now pos¬
sible, provided that biologists are not content with
answers not based on fact, or with dogmatic expla¬
nations, and realize both the help they can give
each other and their respective limitations.
The unsatisfactory nature of the traditional
solutions to the problem perhaps explains why
the ideological struggle against racialism has
proved so ineffective on a practical level. There
is nothing to indicate that racial préjudice is
declining and plenty of évidence to suggest that,
after brief periods of localized quiescence, it is
reappearing everywhere with increased intensity.
It is for this reason that UNESCO feels called upon

Ail true création implles a certain
deafness to outside values, even to the
extent of rejecting them.
to renew from time to time a battle whose out¬
come appears uncertain, to say the least.
But can we be so sure that the racial form
taken by intolérance results primarily from false
beliefs heid by this or that people about the
dependence of culture on organic évolution? Are
thèse ideas not simply an ideological cover for a
more real form of antagonism, based on the will
to subjugate and on relations of power? This was
certainly the case in the past, but, even supposing
that thèse relations of power become less
marked, will not racial differentiation continue to
serve as a pretext for the growing difficulty of
living together, unconsciously felt by mankind,
which is undergoing a démographie explosion
and which . . . is beginning to hâte itself, warned
by a mysterious prescience that its numbers are
becoming too great for ail its members to enjoy
freely open space and pure, non-polluted air?
Racial préjudice is at its most intense when it
concerns human groups confined to a territory so
cramped and a share of natural resources so
meagre that thèse peoples lack dignity in their own
eyes as well as in those of their more powerful
neighbours. But does not humanity today, on the
whole, tend to expropriate itself and, on a planet
that has grown too small, reconstitute, to its own
cost, a situation comparable to that inflicted by
some of its représentatives on the unfortunate
American or Oceanic tribes? Finally, what would
happen to the ideological struggle against racial
préjudice, if it were shown to be universally true
as some experiments conducted by psychologists
suggest that if subjects of any origin whatever are
divided into groups, which are placed in a com¬
pétitive situation, each group will develop feelings
of bias and injustice towards its rivais ?
Minority groups appearing in various parts of
the world today, such as the hippies, are not dis¬
tinguished from the bulk of the population by
race, but only by their way of life, morality, hair
style and dress; are the feelings of répugnance and
sometimes hostility they inspire in most of their
fellows substantially différent from racial hatred?
Would we therefore be making genuine progress
if we confined ourselves to dissipating the partic¬
ular préjudices on which racial hatred in the
strict sensé of the term can be said to be based?
Tlie mirage of universal entente
In any case, the contribution ethnologists can
make to the solution of the race problem would
be derisory; nor is it certain that psychologists
and educators could do any better, so strong is
the évidence as we see from the évidence of the
so-called primitive peoples that mutual tolér¬
ance présupposes two conditions which in con¬
temporary society are further than ever from
being realized: one is relative equality; the other is
adéquate physical séparation.
. . . No doubt we cherish the hope that one day
equality and fraternity will reign among men
without impairing their diversity. But if humanity
is not to resign itself to becoming a stérile con¬
sumer of the values it created in the past and of
those alone . . . , it will hâve to relearn the fact that
ail true création implies a certain deafness to out¬
side values, even to the extent of rejecting or
denying them. For one individual cannot at the
same time merge into the spirit of another, iden-
tify with another and still malntain his own iden¬
tity. Intégral communication with another, if fuUy
realized, sooner or later dooms the créative origi¬
nality of both. The great créative epochs in history
were those in which communication had become
adéquate for distant individuals to stimulate each
other, but not fréquent or rapid enough for those
obstacles, indispensable between individuals as
they are between groups, to be reduced to the
point at which diversity becomes levelled out and
nullified by excessively facile interchange.
. . . Convinced that cultural and organic évolu¬
tion are inextricably linked, [biologists and ethnol¬
ogists] know, of course, that a return to the past is
impossible, but they know, too, that the course
humanity is at présent following is building up ten¬
sions to such a degree that racial hatred is a mère
foretaste of the greater intolérance that may hold
sway tomorrow, without even the pretext of
ethnie différences. To forestall the dangers threat-
ening us today and those, still more formidable,
that we shall hâve to face tomorrow, we must
accept the fact that their causes are much deeper
than mère ignorance or préjudice: we can only
hope for a change in the course of history, which is
even more difficult to bring about than progress
in the mareh of ideas.

A plea for tolérance
Article 1
m
Meaning
of tolérance
1.1 Tolérance is respect, acceptance and
appréciation of the rich diversity of our
world's cultures, our forms of expres¬
sion and ways of being human. It is fos-
tered by knowledge, openness, com¬
munication, and freedom of thought,
conscience and belief. Tolérance is har-
mony in différence. It is not only a
moral duty, it is also a political and légal
requirement. Tolérance, the virtue that
makes peace possible, contributes to the
replacement of the culture of war by a
culture of peace.
1.2 Tolérance is not concession, conde-
scension or indulgence. Tolérance is,
above ail, an active attitude prompted by
récognition of the universal human
rights and fundamental freedoms of
others. In no circumstance can it be
used to justify infringements of thèse
fundamental values. Tolérance is to be
exercised by individuals, groups and
States.
1.3 Tolérance is the responsibility that
upholds human rights, pluralism
(including cultural pluralism), democ¬
racy and the rule of law. It involves the
rejection of dogmatism and absolutism
and affirms the standards set out in
international human rights instruments.
1.4 Consistent with respect for human
rights, the practice of tolérance does not
mean toleration of social injustice or the
abandonment or weakening of one's
convictions. It means that one is free to
adhère to one's own convictions and
accepts that others adhère to theirs. It
means accepting the fact that human
beings, naturally diverse in their appear¬
ance, situation, speech, behaviour and
values, hâve the right to live in peace and
to be as they are. It also means that one's
views are not to be imposed on others.

Education
4.1 Education is the most effective
means of preventing intolérance. The
first step in tolérance éducation is to
teach people what their shared rights
and freedoms are, so that they may be
respected, and to promote the will to
protect those of others.
4.2 Education for tolérance should be
considered an urgent imperative; that is
why it is necessary to promote system¬
atic and rational tolérance teaching
methods that will address the cultural,
social, économie, political and religious
sources of intolérance major roots of
violence and exclusion. Education poli¬
cies and programmes should contribute
to development of understanding, soli¬
darity and tolérance among individuals as
well as among ethnie, social, cultural, reli¬
gious and linguistic groups and nations.
4.3 Education for tolérance should aim
at countering influences that lead to fear
and exclusion of others, and should help
young people to develop capacities for
independent judgement, critical thinking
and ethical reasoning.
4.4 We pledge to support and implement
programmes of social science research
and éducation for tolérance, human
rights and non-violence. This means
devoting spécial attention to improving
teacher training, curricula, the content of
textbooks and lessons, and other educa-
tional materials including new educa-
tional technologies, with a view to edu-
cating caring and responsible citizens
open to other cultures, able to appre-
ciate the value of freedom, respectful of
human dignity and différences, and able
to prevent conflicts or résolve them by
non-violent means.

Race and racial préjudice
Article 1
1. AU human beings belong to a single
species and are descended from a
common stock. They are born equal in
dignity and rights and ail form an intégral
part of humanity.
2. Ail individuals and groups hâve the
right to be différent, to consider them¬
selves as différent and to be regarded as
such. However, the diversity of life
styles and the right to be différent may
not, in any circumstances, serve as a pre¬
text for racial préjudice; they may not
justify either in law or in fact any dis-
criminatory practice whatsoever, nor
provide a ground for the policy of
apartheid, which is the extrême form of
racism	
4. Ail peoples of the world possess equal
faculties for attaining the highest level in
intellectual, technical, social, économie,
cultural and political development.
5. The différences between the achieve-
ments of the différent peoples are
entirely attributable to geographical, his¬
torical, political, économie, social and
cultural factors. Such différences can in
no case serve as a pretext for any rank-
ordered classification of nations or
peoples.
Article 2
1. Any theory which involves the claim
that racial or ethnie groups are inher-
ently superior or inferior, thus implying
that some would be entitled to dominate
or eliminate others, presumed to be
inferior, or which bases value judge-
ments on racial differentiation, has no
scientific foundation and is contrary to
the moral and ethical principles of
humanity.
2. Racism includes racist idéologies,
prejudiced attitudes, discriminatory
behaviour, structural arrangements and
institutionalized practices resulting in
racial inequality as well as the fallacious
notion that discriminatory relations
between groups are morally and scien-
tifically justifiable; it is reflected in dis¬
criminatory provisions in législation or
régulations and discriminatory practices
as well as in anti-social beliefs and acts; it
hinders the development of its victims,
perverts those who practice it, divides
nations internally, impedes international
co-operation and gives rise to political
tensions between peoples; it is contrary
to the fundamental principles of interna¬
tional law and, consequently, seriously
disturbs international peace and security.
3. Racial préjudice, historically linked
with inequalities in power, reinforced by
économie and social différences
between individuals and groups, and still
seeking today to justify such inequalities,
is totally without justification.
Article 4
1. Any restriction on the complète self-
fulfilment of human beings and free
communication between them which is
based on racial or ethnie considérations
is contrary to the principle of equality in
dignity and rights; it cannot be admitted.
2. One of the most serious violations of
this principle is represented by
apartheid, which, like génocide, is a
crime against humanity, and gravely dis¬
turbs international peace and security.
3. Other policies and practices of racial
ségrégation and discrimination consti-
tute crimes against the conscience and
dignity of mankind and may lead to
political tensions and gravely endanger
international peace and security.

exercising ail or some of their rights. Because of
this risk we must act before it is too late and cor¬
rect trends which might otherwise lead to incalcu¬
lable problems. We must observe, anticipate, and
prevent. Prévention is not just an option. It is an
unavoidable obligation, an ethical imperative. We
must act in good time. We must look ahead and try
to see the shape of our common destiny. We must
never lapse into fatalism. UNESCO's Constitution
has entrusted us with a unique task: to be the con¬
science of humanity. This task includes considéra¬
tion for those who will follow in our footsteps,
those who hâve yet to be born.
The survivors of wars think with great intensity
of those who will come after them, because they
want to spare future générations the horrors they
hâve known themselves. Death, which they hâve
seen at close quarters, has at least given them an
opportunity to discover the full meaning of life. Not
life lived selfîshly and in isolation, but community
life in ail its aspects, including that of continuity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the opening
words of the Charter of the United Nations
should refer to the fate of succeeding générations.
What is surprising, however, is that there has been
no subséquent attempt to look more deeply into
the idea of "future générations", especially from
the standpoint of the rights they should enjoy. It
is true that the World Héritage Convention
adopted by Unesco's General Conférence in 1972
was inspired by a détermination to safeguard the
héritage so that it could be passed on intact to
future générations those very words appear in
its text. Twenty years later, the Earth Summit
adopted the Rio Déclaration, which strengthens
and reaffîrms the idea of solidarity between the
générations.
Solidarity between the générations
But we must go further. We must recognize and
guarantee the 


rights of future générations. Probably
the most striking example of a possible threat to
those rights is that of pollution and its attendant haz-
ards, especially in relation to choices concerning
nuclear energy an issue which is rarely as simple
and cut-and-dried as it is presented to the gênerai
public. The political, économie or financial interests
that favour particular solutions must never be
allowed to overshadow the interests of future gén¬
érations. In cases where the foreseeable consé¬
quences of investment will extend far beyond the
présent, it is worth considering whether an impact
study should not be made of the conséquences of
the various options on offer over a fifty-year
period, the span of two générations.

### 102565: The Rights of future generations

In fact there is little doubt that several of the



rights of future générations are affected: the right
to life and to the conservation of the human
génome, the right to development and to indi¬
vidual and collective fulfilment, and the right to an
ecologically balanced environment. Thèse are
indeed human rights, that is, universal and univer-
sally recognized values which are a legitimate cause
of concern for the international community as a
whole. This is a far cry from rights regarded
merely as legally protected vested interests.
The duties of the présent
The fact remains that the rights of future généra¬
tions belong to a new type in comparison with the
rights enshrined in the Universal Déclaration of
Human Rights of 1948. First of ail because, by déf¬
inition, those entitled to them do not yet exist
although since Roman times the law has admitted
cases in which the rights of persons yet unborn are
acknowledged. We must now extend that possi-
bility, without, however, ending up with a précise
légal status for the unborn child or embryo, issues
which are now under discussion in many countries.
In reality, thèse new-style rights are only rights
because today's générations hâve obligations
whose counterparts are the rights of future génér¬
ations. In other words there is a dialectical rela¬
tionship between rights and duties which should
make us aware of the inhérent unity of the human
race, in space and over time.
Which rights of future générations should be
recognized? It has often been correctly pointed
out that ail the rights set forth in the thirty articles
of the Universal Déclaration can be condensed
into a single one: the right to live in dignity, which
is indeed the sum of civil, political, économie,
social and cultural rights. The same synthesis could
probably be applied to the rights of future généra¬
tions, with the added dimension of the continuity
of human life, i.e., guaranteeing the right to live in
dignity on an earth that is habitable. This brings us
back to the préoccupation with the environment
which will probably, with hindsight, be seen as the
major qualitative change that has occurred in the
twentieth century.
However, it is préférable, if only for educa-
tional and légal reasons, to consider the rights of
future générations on an individual basis. First of
ail, the exemption of persons belonging to future
générations from ail individual responsibility for
the crimes of earlier générations should be
regarded as a human right. I hâve long believed, to
put it bluntly, that history kills and that accordingly
we are in duty bound to "disarm history", since it
is axiomatic that future générations cannot con¬
tinue to shoulder the burden of the crimes, actual
or alleged, of their forebears. Make no mistake:
this has nothing to do with the moral responsibility
which each person, each community and each
nation must assume in complète freedom, but
concerns légal responsibility, with its attendant
criminal and civil conséquences.
The right to live in peace
The second right which is of great importance at
the présent time is that which has been formuated
as "right to peace and right not to be a victim of
war". In this context I think particularly of the pio-
neering work carried out by the recently founded
Tricontinental Institute for Parliamentary Democ¬
racy and Human Rights and by Captain Cousteau
and his associâtes. We know that war does not stop
when the guns fail silent but continues long after,
to the détriment of those who were not respon¬
sible for it. The acknowledgment of this new right
for future générations is part of the culture of
peace for which UNESCO is working.
If it is true, as the French philosopher Henri
Bergson once said, that "the idea of the future is
more fertile than the future itself", we must start to
work on this idea, extract ail we can from it, and
ensure that it flourishes. The rights of future gén¬
érations are the duties of today's générations. Their
lives tomorrow dépend on the concern we show
for them today.

« SALAMANCA
JOSÉ M. G. HOLGUERA
is a Spanish writer and translater who was born in
Salamanca and has taught at the Universities of Stirling
(Scotland), Dublin (Ireland) and Rouen (France).
Salamanca first appears in history
as Helmantiké, in an account 

of
its fail to Hannibal's Carthaglnian army
in 220 B.C. The stone bull on the city's
Roman bridge, which also features on
its coat of arms, is a relie of that period
and was probably the legacy of the Vet-
tones and the Vaccaei, who put their
herds to graze on the banks of the River
Tormes. The bridge itself is thought to
hâve been built by Trajan, but only the
fifteen arches on the city side date from
the Ist century A.D. The others are the
resuit of extensive rebuilding in the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries after
the bridge had been damaged by flood
waters.
Not much has survived from the
period between the collapse of Roman
rule in the third century and the repop¬
ulation of the city in the eleventh, apart
from sections of Roman and médiéval
ramparts, the bridge over the Tormes
and its bull.
Three people were responsible for
Salamanca's prosperity in the Middle
Ages. The first, Bernardo del Carpio, was
a legendary hero who continued to crop
up in Spanish literature long afterwards.
The second, Raymond of Burgundy,
helped the city to expand considerably
at the end of the eleventh century when
it was repopulated by Castillans, Gali-
cians, Mozarabs, Jews and Franks, and
given the well-defined légal and territo¬
rial structures of the feudal System.
Bishop Geronimo, El Cid's chaplain, was
responsible for the ecclesiastical organi¬
zation of the city and the start of work on
building the cathedral.
Of the many hterary figures associated
with Salamanca, two became household
names: Lazarillo de Tormes and La
Celestina. The Life ofLazarillo de Tormes

The golden stones of
Salamanca
byJoséM. G. Holguera
Famed for its university and its cultural life, the Spanish city of Salamanca
has an outstanding architectural héritage. Its historic centre was registered
on Unesco's World Héritage List in 1988.
Salamanca's Roman bridge is dominated
by the Old Catliedra! (12th century) and the New
Cathedral (16th-18th centuries).
The Patio de las Escuelas. In the centre of this
little square stands a statue of the Spanish writer

is an anonymous first-person account, pub¬
lished in 1554, of the adventures of a
maverick hero born, as his name suggests,
on the banks of the River Tormes, who
does his best to get through life without
overburdening himself with ethical con¬
sidérations or lofty sentiments. This story
marked the birth of Spanish picaresque
literature and is one of the sources of the
modem novel. As for La Celestina, or La
Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea
(1499), it was probably written in Sala¬
manca by Fernando de Rojas. With its
pair of tragic lovers and the unforgettable
character of La Celestina, an aged bawd-
cum-witch, the play is one of the most
important forerunners of modem théâtre.
A third figure who did much to bring
famé to Salamanca is that of the stu-
dent. In the Spain of the Golden Cen¬
tury, the student figure who features in
so many stories and plays always hails
from Salamanca. He is generally quar-
relsome and ne'er-do-well (the meaning
of the word picaro), but above ail
bursting with youthful vitality. He
enjoyed an eventful literary career
which lasted until José de Espronceda y
Delgado's The Student of Salamanca in
the nineteenth century. Even today,
youthfulness is the hallmark of social
and cultural life in Salamanca, where
most of the population is aged under
thirty.
THE OLD CATHEDRAL
The courtyard known as the Patio Chico
affords the finest view of the cathedral of
Santa Maria de la Sede (known as the Old
Cathedral, to distinguish it from the
New Cathedral built next to it three cen¬
turies later). It was erected between the
beginning of the tweifth century and the
end of the thirteenth, which explains
why the original fortress-like building
gradually became lighter, in both sensés
of the word, under Gothic influence.
The monumental lantern-tower known
as the Torre del Gallo (the Cock's Tower),
which tops the building, even has an ori¬
ental quality. Its lower section, which is

flanked by four turrets, rises to a Byzan¬
tine-style cupola. This almost improvised
arrangement resulted from changes made
to the original plan by master architect
Pedro Pérez with the aim 


of covering the
naves. The élégant solution he devised is a
model of architectural creativity.
The Old Cathedral is remarkable
not only for its wealth of architectural
interest, the abundance of its décora¬
tion (capitals, paintings and sculptures)
and the inventive fantasy of the vault in
the Talavera Chapel (eight semicircular
arches, arranged in parallai pairs, ail of
them différent, which do not meet at
the keystone), but also because it used
to house the Ecclesiastical School, first
mentioned in 1130, which later became
the University. It was there, in the
Santa Barbara Chapel, that examina-
tions and degree cérémonies were heid
for centuries.
THE UNIVERSITY
Patio de Escuelas, a small square over-
looked by the monumental façade of
tha University, is a masterpiece dating
from the early seventeenth century. It is
lined with tha buildings that form the
heart of tha old University complex: the
Escuelas Mayores and Manoras and the
Estudio Hospital (which now housas the
Vice-Chancallary). It was in 1218, at
tha bahast of Alfonso IX, that tha
Ecclesiastical School broadened its cur-
riculum to include général studies.
From 1255 on, the University of Sala¬
manca ranked among the most famous
centres of learning in Christendom,
alongside Oxford, Paris and Bologna.
Tha University's golden aga cama in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
The Escuelas Mayoras were built
batwaan 1415 and 1433. Tha founda¬
tion stone of tha hospital was laid in
1413. Tha portai of the Escuelas
Menores (an establishment providing
secondary éducation) was built in 1533.
Tha courtyard onto which thesa build¬
ings give includes rows of multifoil
Gothic arches a sophisticated combi¬
nation of curves and countercurves
which rank alongside other hidden traa-
sures to be found in Salamanca's many
innar courtyards (in the Casa de las Cou¬
chas, the Palacio de Fonseca, and the
University's upper cloister).
The Estudio Hospital was built in the
Gothic style on tha spot where Raymond
of Burgundy's palace once stood, and
which was traditionally thought to ba
the site of the anciant Roman pretorium.

Tha Plataresqua décoration of tha
friezes borrowed many stylistic éléments
from tha Itahan Renaissance: fauns (ona



of whom is shown engaged in amorous
activity), cartouches, foliated scroUs and
grotesque masks.

What confers unity on thèse buildings,
as it does on ail thosa in Salamanca, is tha
matarial of which they are built: a red-
dish-gold stone from tha Villamayor

and phUosopher Fray Luis da Léon, which

It was in the adjoining hall that, threa

tha University crossed swords with the
Francoist General MiUân Astray, who had
just exclaimed: "Daath to the intellec¬
tuals! Long liva death!" The Vice-Chan¬
callor rose to his feet and said: "This is
the temple of intalligance, and you hava
just desecrated it. Victory will ba yours,
but you shall not carry conviction, for to
convince and persuade you need some¬
thing which you lack: reason and a just
cause." In tha uproar caused by his
ramarks, soldiars had to "saa him home".
The incident took place on 12 October
1936, thraa months after the beginning
of the Civil War, and tha Vice-Chan¬
callor's name was Miguel de Unamuno.

ties sought by tha architects of Plaza

and 1735. It is remarkable for its fine
proportions and the élégance of its déc¬
oration, which is at once baroque and
sobar. Plaza Mayor is, in a sensé, Sala¬
manca's opan-air salon, where everyone
likas to foragathar.
It is always thronged with people,
whataver tha time of day or night, or
tha time of yaar. But they do not go

of Salamanca hastens back to Plaza

### 102567: Waste-free manufacturing: feasible goal or wild goose chase?

Wast&free manufacturing ^feasible
goal or wild goose chase?
by France Bequette
G reyiag Geese
in flight.
FRANCE BEQUETTE
is a Franco-American
journalist
specializing in
environmental
questions.
ccording to the United
i Nations Industrial Develop¬
ment Organization (UNIDO),
world économie output is
expactad to double between now
and 2010. In developing countries
it is anticipated to nearly triple.
It is vital, therefore, to idantify
manufacturing technologies that
produca a minimum of waste and
encourage their widespread usa
internationally, as well as pre-
venting pollution at its source. As
wasta storage and treatment
become more and more costly,
"zéro waste" manufacturing is in
everybody's interest.
It was against this background
that the United Nations Univer¬
sity (UNU, see box page 44)
launched a long-term research
programme known as the Zéro
Emission Research Initiative
(ZERI). The aim of the pro¬
gramme, which is the brainchild
of Gunter Pauli, an advisor to tha
UNU's Rector, is to achieve tech-
nological braakthroughs that will
facilitate manufacturing without
any form of wasta.
RESEARCH
INTO ECOTECHNOLOGY
The ZERI programme is based on
the principle that tha idéal indus¬
trial System is one where total
input equals total output, i.e. tha
raw materials usad in the manu¬
facturing process are fully usad.
Tha programma has a four-step
approach. Firstly, it is compiling
lists of the types of waste prod-
ucts that can be returned to
industry for usa as raw materials.
Secondly, it is suggasting that car-
tain industries should co-operata
in "clusters", with wasta from one
industry being usad as raw mate¬
rials by othar members of tha
cluster. Thirdly, it is encouraging
the search for technological
braakthroughs that would
improve tha cost-affactivanass of
this kind of raorganization.
Lastly, the programme calls for

government backing which is nec¬
essary if its aims are to be real¬
ized on a large scale.
A number of companies agread
to take part in tha programme,
and five core projects were
selected for research into indus¬
trial clustering. The industries
concerned ware fish farming and
the brewing of bear and soya
sauce; sugar; forastry; the paper
and pulp industries; and plastics,
cament and construction mate¬
rials manufacturing. Two other
projects ara encouraging research
into "technologies from nature"
the non-wasta production of
colour pigments and waxes.
VERTICAL
CONCENTRATION
The brewing of béer and soya
sauce créâtes a number of envi¬
ronmental headachas. It produces
large amounts of solid waste that
is often simply dumped because
it is not financially worthwhila to
convert it to animal food even
though it has a high protein con¬
tent. ZERI suggests that thèse
two industries join forces with
fish farming. This calls for exten¬
sive rasaarch into the affluents
and solid wastas produced by
brewaries and the best way of
feeding them diractly to fish, the
fish varietias best suited to
absorb waste from brawerias, and
algae which could absorb waste
from fish ponds and, thanks to
sunlight and oxygen, convert it
back into feedstuff for the fish.
Another problem facad by tha
bear and soya sauce industries is
that of claaning returned bottles
and bottling machines. Harsh
chamicals such as caustic soda
and starilizing agents are widaly
usad, and as a rasult cleaning has
to ba donc twice, onca with chem¬
icals and once with watar to rinsa
out tha chemicals. If sugar-based
cleaners such as APG (alkyl
polyglucose currently used in cos-
metics and pharmaceuticals) wara
used, wasta watar could ba
directly channaled to fish-farming
ponds. As the ZERI programme
sacs it, vertical concentration of
thesa industries would bring
mutual benefit and would be an
idéal solution for recycling wasta.
Another example, albeit on a
smallar scale, concerns racycling
branchas and foliaga from felled
traas. Tha leaves of some tree
species can be used to produce

parfuma, essential oils, colour
pigments, and stabilizers (prasar-
vativas) used in food processing.
Unlike the synthetic products
that are currantly usad, ail thesa
natural products ara biodégrad¬
able. The distillation process
used to obtain them is often
highly enargy-intensiva, but small
wood débris could be used in
mobile distillation units that
would operata at the falling site.
At tha end of tha opération
rasiduas from distilling could be
used as a soil enrichar. In this way
tha trees would be fully usad,
and highly skilled jobs would be
created for foresters.
TECHNOLOGICAL
BREAKTHROUGHS
Everyone is in favour of racycling
paper, but not everyone knows that
it is an axpansive opération and ona
that causes pollution. De-inking is
inafficient (only 65 to 80 par cent
of ink is effectivaly removed). A lot
of water is needed and highly pol-
luting toxic sludge is produced. In
short, racycled paper is more
expansive to produce than new
paper. It will be necessary to
davalop da-inking technologies
using enzymatic, microbiological,
biochamical or magnetic mathods,
and produce a naw ink that will ba
casier to datach from paper. The

resulting waste sludge and short
fibres could ba used in tha
building industry as a substitute
for asbestos or for making sound-
proof panels and corrugated card-
board.
Meanwhile, fly ash from incin-
erated municipal wasta and slack
from the iron and steel industry
could be converted into high-
value-added raw materials for the
construction business, as is
alraady being donc with coal
dust. Limastone and gypsum ara
used in tha cament industry and
could partly be produced from
thèse wastes. To ba completely
efficient, however, the siza of the
cernant factory must correspond
to the size of tha town and tha
volume of wasta incinerated.
NOT STRICTLY
FOR THE BIRDS
Tha ZERI programme also
encourages rasaarch into tech¬
nologies based on procassas and
Systems that ara well known to
nature but not to humankind. To
date only tha pharmaceutical
industry has investigated thesa
possibilities.
Take the case of colours,
which are used in industries
ranging from textiles to cars and
from cosmatics to food. Industry
has devaloped some 4,500 colour
pigments, most of them based on
patrochamicals. In textiles, most
of the colour pigments ara wasted
in the watar and only a fraction
sticks to the fibres. In countries
whara there are strict environ-
mental protection laws, compa¬
nies are obliged to traat tha pol-
luted water at great expansé.
This partly explains why many
textile companies hava moved to
developing countries whara pro¬
duction costs are lower and envi¬
ronmental constraints not so
severe.
The painting process usad in
the automobile industry has
changed considerably ovar the
past twenty years, largely due to

the introduction of powder- and
water-based paints. Thèse newer
techniques do not produca the
sludge once made by car-paint
workshops, which is handlad as
spécial industrial waste and incin¬
erated with great care. However,
metallic paints remain a potential
health hazard.
To solve thèse problems the
UNU suggests studying birds.
The brilliant colours of the
feathers of several tropical birds
are not based on colour pigments
but on the refraction of light that
offers the variety of colours of the
rainbow. Research into tha
refraction of light in synthetic
fibres can build on optic fibre pro¬
duction technologies devaloped in
télécommunications, although a
lot of work still needs be donc
before this technology can ba
applied to automobiles.
Birds hâve another original gift
to offer us. They produce various
kinds of wax that are essential for
their survival. Oddly enough their
feathar wax is liquid and easy to
apply at -30° C, whereas it solidi¬
fies in the +40° Celsius beat of the
tropics. The ZERI study will con-

aircraft and satellites and reduce
their friction are both polluting to

Before applying this process in
industry, the molacular structure
of wild goose wax must be studied
in order to solve the mystery of
why it remains liquid at very low
températures and solidifies in
great haat.

THE SWAN SONG OF THE COW?
Up to 1,500 of the world's 4,000 to 5,000 domestic animal breeds may eventually disappear,
according to the new édition of FAO's "World Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity". Because
of the rapid spread of high-yield commercial breeds, tbe genetic resources of certain animais are
becoming impoverished. One case is that of Europe's dairy-cattle population, v^hich is novi dom¬
inated by the Holstein breed. Conservation of animal genetic diversity is essential because it
allows farmers to sélect stocks and develop new breeds in response to environmental changes,
threats from disease, and consumer demands.
FROM WORM TO
WATCHDOG
Genetic engineering carried out at the Univer¬
sity of Nottingham (United Kingdom) on a
transparent aquatic worm, Caenorhabditls ele-
gans, has endowed it with the capacity to turn
royal blue when it comes into contact with
toxic chemical waste or heavy metals. Since
the intensity of the blue is proportional to the
degree of pollution and the worm takes only a
few hours to change colour, it may well
become an efficient watchdog for monitoring
water quality.
INSURANCE COMPANIES
ACCOUNT FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change says that climate changes caused by
human interférence with the environment
hâve aiready begun and that an increase in
natural disasters such as floods, droughts
and hurricanes is to be expected. The United
M'
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has
pointed out that more than $50 billion com¬
pensation was paid out in the wake of
storms and cyclones between 1987 and
1995, a period in which the number of floods
and droughts also increased dramatically.
Last November, 14 European and Japanese
Insurance companies signed a déclaration
promising to protect the environment by
introducing environmental considérations
into their risk-management policies.
FAOHASTOTIGHTEN
ITS BELT
The budget of the Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization of the United Nations (FAO), whose
mandate is to help the 800 million human
beings (including 200 million children under
five) who do not hâve access to sufficient
food, is equal to the amount spent in nine
industrialized countries on dog and cat food
in six days. For 1996 and 1997, FAO Director-
General Dr. Jacques Diouf had to propose a
no-growth budget ($697.8 million). Dr. Diouf
said that he was sensitive to the concern of some member states to
find savings in order to reduce imbalances in their national budgets,
but warned against retreating before "the growing needs . . . of the
world's poor".
ADEADLYNEWALGA
Late in 1994, the French Institute for Marine Research (IFREMER)
detected the présence of a poisonous micro-alga {Heterosigma carterae)
in several bays on the coast of Finistère, western France. The alga has
proliferated to a concentration of several million spécimens per litre,
turning the waters where it thrives yellow-brown. Substances released
into the water by the algae attack the gills and digestive tracts of fish
and cause them to suffocate. The reasons for this sudden infesta-
tion are not yet known.
AIRBORNE PARTICLES THAT MAY
COOL THE EARTH
Scientists now suspect that aérosols (microscopic particles of sul-
phur compounds and other pollutants floating in the atmosphère) may
play a rôle in neutralizing or even reversing the greenhouse effect in cer¬
tain of the world's highly industrialized régions. Aérosols are mostly
produced by burning fossil fuels but are also emitted by living organ¬
isms and volcanoes. By reflecting sunlight back to space, thèse tiny par¬
ticles directly affect the amount of radiation entering the earth's atmos¬
phère and may help to slow down global warming.
GREEN GOLD
Bamboo (often called "green gold") and rattan generate global revenues
exceeding $11 billion annually, and some 2.5 billion people worldwide
dépend on bamboo alone for uses ranging from building material to
food. Concern about overexploitation and tropical forest destruction
hâve led the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI),
the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) and FAO to
carry out joint research to improve the accessibility of bamboo and
rattan resources, reduce pressure on natural forests, and create new
job opportunities in rural areas.

### 102575: Isabelle Leymarie talks to Teresa Laredo

Isabelle Leymarie talks to
TeI1!b9A LAREDO
Teresa Laredo in concert at Unesco's Paris Headquarters In 1992.
The internationally known Bolivian pianist
and harpsichordist Teresa Laredo studied at
tlie Académie Santa Cecilia in Rome (Italy)
and the Mozarteum in Salzburg (Austria),
and later taught at the Conservatory in
Geneva (Switzerland). She recently carried
out a study on women composers In Bollvia
and made two recordings, one devoted to
Works by the Argentine composer Alberto
Ginastera and by a number of Bolivian
composers, and the other to the early works
of Clara Schumann.
ISABELLE LEYMARIE
is a Franco-American musicologist.
You seem to feel that music is
above ail a state of exaltation,
sometliing almost sacred. . .
Teresa LaredOi Spanish has a term that
describes perfectly how I feel about
music: jûbilo (jubilation). Music is a way
of experiencing higher states of con-
sciousness and communicating them to
others. That is why I love teaching. l've
often hosted musical events and I enjoy
improvising for ail kinds of audiences,
flying in the face of barriers and com-
partmentalization. I like to explore ail
kinds of music and musical tastes. . . .
How did you become so
eclectic?
T. L.: When I was a child I danced the
flamenco with castanets and the zap-
ateado. I also played the xylophone. My
response to music was totally physical. I
also danced my country's Indian dances.
One of my grandmothers came from
Granada. She had an expansive person-
ality and sang. The other was Bolivian
and was more withdrawn. She played
waltzes and light music on the piano.
Later I spent three years in Casablanca
where I became interested in Arab
music and its influence on Spanish
music. In Morocco I played the qanun
for fun, and studied classical harp at
the conservatory. I like oriental music
because, with its quarter tones, it
reveals ail the refinements of the soûl. I
also became interested in Indian music
and hâve taught ragas on the piano.
Since the piano is not a
tempered instrument, teaching
Indian music must be difficult,
especially for rendering slides from
one tone to another.
T. L: Yes, it was a little frustrating.
Later I lived in Sydney (Australia) and
was fascinated by the music of the
Aborigènes their culture, their
musical instruments, especially the
didgeridoo, a wind instrument made
from a bamboo pipe. I found it ail
enchanting. Their music seems to cap¬
ture the sounds of the sea and the wind,
even the movement of ants.
Some American jazz musicians
are very fond of the didgeridoo.
T. L: I haven't got enough wind to play
the Bolivian panpipes, so at home I hook
up them up to a sampler, which synthe-
sizes the sound and intégrâtes it into the
keyboard. l've donc a lot of composing
directly on this device. When I scrape my

foot on the floor, for example, I get
sounds that evoke certain cosmic sounds
when they are processed by the sampler.
Would you call this kind of
composition concrète music?
T. L.: Yes, sort of, but combined with
notes. When I use this instrument I take
myself into the next century. I composed
Star Dust while gazing at a drawing done
by my little nièce. You see the earth and
the galaxies and children coming down
towards our planet. They're like voices,
vibrations of innocence that help us to
purify ourselves. They arrive on earth
and join together in celestial harmony. I
am very keen on Andean pantheism, its
cosmic and solar rituals and its célébra¬
tions of the equinoxes.
You are particularly fond of
women 's music. . .
T.L.: What interests me about women is
that they've always made music while
they were cloistered at home, at court
or in convents. Later they played at
family gatherings and gradually began
to study in conservatories. Right now I
am very interested in Amy Beach, an
American contemporary of Olivier Mes-
siaen, and in Seymanovska, a Polish
woman who composed nocturnes that
Chopin admired. In Fribourg not long
ago I asked the audience to identify the
composer of a pièce I had just played.
They ail guessed it was Chopin, but in
fact it was Seymanovska.
How do you manage to
remember so many works from
such varied sources?
T. L: My memory seems to be tailor-
made for that. What's more I hâve a
wide range of expérience. l've accompa-
nied ballets, played chamber music and
concertos and given solo récitals. l've
experienced moments of ecstasy, espe
cially when playing César Franck.
Somewhere in Latin America in a place
where there was no piano, I even mimed
piano-playing to taped music in front of
a rapt audience of children.
Where did you get your
enthusiasm for Clara Schumann?
T. L.: I read her journal and her corre-
spondence with Robert Schumann and
Brahms when I was thirteen years old in
Bolivia. Later I met a woman who had
photographed some documents about
Clara, and she gave me her archives. I
admired Clara. She adored giving con¬
certs; she didn't play her own works but
other people's, and she always deferred
to her husband. So I said to her with my
inner voice, "Now it's your turn. I'm the
person who will make your work
known."
From then on, I decided to draw
attention to minor works composed by
women, those fleeting moments in life
that men sometimes tend to disdain. I
did research and made some amazing
discoveries. It was thanks to Clara that
I finally had the courage to start com¬
posing myself. I think l've interpreted
her music faithfully. It has an aura that
has to come out in every pièce so that
the music is radiant with the artist's
inspiration.
Every note seems to hâve a life
of its own.
71 L: Absolutely. This explains the con¬
nection between music, poetry and the
other forms of art. When I compose,
words and melody often come to me at
the same time. Music has taught me to
see our hidden qualities. The magie
that music gives off comes from our
inner being, from what one might call
the soûl which is something unique to
ail of us and at the same time links us to
others.

### 102576: The Image and the word

January 1972
^
The image and the word by Alberto Moravia
ItaUan writer (1907-1990)
The notion that the book and the printed word are in rapid
décline gained ils widest currency following the spectac¬
ular success of the image and the média of visual commu¬
nication the cinéma, télévision, advertising displays, strip
cartoons, road signs and so on.
But few persons appear to hâve given much thought to
the fact that the image owes its success, in turn, to the
entry into humanity's arena of large masses of humanity,
including the newly literate and the totally illiterate.
The illiterate person undeniably has a distinctive visual
awareness. For him the whole world is a vast System of
visual signs and symbols waiting to be interpreted and trans¬
lated. The origin of writing itself, with its slow progression
from the représentation of an object to a form of sym-
bolism, shows that primitive man used his eyes for tasks
that civilized man later entrusted to his ears.
So in the first place, what we are dealing with is not so
much a décline of the book as a triumph of the image, a tri-
umph due in far smaller measure to those who hâve always
been readers than to those who only yesterday did not know
how to read.
If this is so, as l myself believe, we can expect at any
time to see a steady décline in the influence of the image
and a corresponding résurgence of the book. In other
words, as millions upon miUions of illiterate men and women
learn to read and write, they are likely to abandon the
primitive, direct language of the image in favour of the
more elaborate, more indirect language of the printed
word.
Modem man, moreover, uses the picture in ways that
are basically différent from those of primitive man. In the
primitive world, it marked the first steps in communica¬
tion; today it is only a provisional return to conditions that
are perhaps temporary. The modem world is not so much a
primitive world as one temporarily "primitivized". In other
words, even in the progression from the language of the pic¬
ture to the language of the printed word we can observe
once again the phenomenon of ontogenesis (the development
of the individual) which duplicates the phenomenon of phy-
logenesis (the development of the whole human species).
That this hypothesis is plausible is furthermore borne
out by the huge circulation of paperbacks. Between the
traditional book and the paperback there is not just a dif¬
férence of quality and priée. In reality the two types of
book are profoundly différent in nature.
The traditional book was rooted, indeed still is rooted,
in an organic, stratified cultural context that has lasted for
centuries. The paperback, on the other hand, scatters the
seeds of the culture of ail âges and ail régions wholesale
upon completely virgin soil. In the space of a few years, the
entire population of our planet, only now barely emerging
from iUiteracy, has been inundated, without any prépara¬
tion, with the culture of thirty centuries.
The danger is that this culture will be not assimilated,
but thrown together, condensed and reduced to mère for¬
mulas and synthetic aggregations in a vast grinding opéra¬
tion of destruction. After which the masses would appar-
ently be free to revert to the image, thenceforward the sole
médium of communication.
This, indeed, may be the direction taken by Marxism in
China with its rejection of the past as "Bourgeois". Mao Tse
Tung has said that the vast masses of the Chinese people are
Uke a sheet of blank paper on which one can write whatever
one wishes. What will be written on this paper we still do
not know.
Besides, the image itself has recently appeared to be
reaching its limits. The fact that the spectator takes in the
picture passively, without any effort of interprétation, ulti-
mately results in the picture itself losing its fuU force and
becoming a victim of this passivity. People watching télévi¬
sion or a film at the cinéma simply do not see what is hap¬
pening before their eyes on the screen; or if they do see, they
do not really comprehend. Passivity has atrophied their
powers of concentration, rendering them inattentive to the
point of blindness.
Of course, they "see" the road sign indicating a school, or
the cowboy astride his horse firing his gun, but now what
they "see" is nothing more than a response to the same con-
ditioned reflex devoid of any mental reflection and hence any
communication. Marshall McLuhan admits this when he says
that "the médium is the message."
The décline of the book is by no manner of means, then,
a certainty. Even if we ignore the fundamental fact that the
book springs from nature, that is from the faculty natural to
ail human beings to utter words and shape them into orga¬
nized speech, we should not overlook the fact that the book
is made up of words which are "also" under certain condi¬
tions of poetic creativity, images. Thus there is no substantial
différence between the image suggested by the book and
the image that appears on the screen. In fact there is only one
différence, though an important one: the image on the screen
aUows for no play of imagination; it is what it is.
Nevertheless, we must distinguish between one type of
trading and another type of reading, between one book and
another book. Reading some books is no more than a simple
physical exercise. Such books, written for mass consump-
tion, conventional in content and in style, are not read in the
full sensé of the word but rather are skimmed through by
the reader: when the eye passes from one ready-made phrase
to the next, from one cUché to another, the "reader" may
believe he has been "reading" but in reality he has doue no
more than register the notations of a verbal mechanism that
is as incompréhensible as it is insignificant.
For a book to be properly "read" it must first be really
"written". If it is true that the book is in décline this is due
not to the fact that the broad gênerai public does not read
but to the fact that they read books that bave not been
"written" but merely printed.
A book, then, must be thought out and created or it is not
a book. Indeed, the future of the book is bound up with the
poetry, creativeness, descriptive power and imagery of the
writing. The future of the book wiU be assured if we succeed
in "writing" books ; it will perish if we content ourselves with
merely printing them.
