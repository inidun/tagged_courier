This wooden statue is one of

in Kafiristan, northeastern
Afghanistan. Surprisingly,
the Kafirs, who live in the
high valleys of the Hindu
Kush mountains, keep no
horses and rarely see them.
They prop the effigies against
the wooden funeral caskets
that lie above ground in
their cemeteries. Standing
over two metres (6'/i ft.) high,
this figure wears a traditional

The launching of the world's first weather satellite in 1960 opened a new era
in meteorology. Weather forecasting and exploration of the atmosphere can
now be based on data obtained promptly and on a truly global scale. But even
today only one-quarter of the surface of the globe has. enough meteorological
stations. To fill the gaps in the present weather observation network, the
World Meteorological Organization is planning a bold new adventure in inter¬
national co-operation the World Weather Watch.

### 19236: Television for the pre-school child

by Henry R. Cassirer
I N Venezuela and Japan, In
Czechoslovakia and the
United States, special programmes are
broadcast by television stations for
children in kindergartens. In Britain
tiny tots are asked to "Watch With
Mother", while in New Mexico, in the
United States, where there are no
public kindergartens, the "TV Kinder¬
garten" takes their place in many a
home and community. Pre-school chil¬
dren tend to watch television whenever
there is a receiver in the home, and
educators are becoming increasingly
aware of the Importance of the tele¬
vision experience in the lives of young
children.
But why should special efforts be
made to reach children between the
ages of two and six with television
programmes?

answers to this question. On the one
hand, it is argued that In countries
which offer massive television pro¬
grammes by day and night, children
inevitably are attracted to the screen
and see many shows either not suited
to their age or of doubtful value. The
moving image on the TV screen exerts
a fascination quite independent of the
content of programmes. This fre¬
quently tempts parents to use TV as a
baby sitter; they urge their children to
"watch the tele" In order to have them
out of the way when they would like
to get on with the housework. Under
these circunmstances, it is particularly
valuable to present programmes care¬
fully prepared and adapted -to the
young ones In order to meet their
hunger for TV and to give them a sense
of values and discrimination with res¬
pect to the majority of unsuitable
shows.
Those who argue this way unques¬
tionably have the child's Interest in
mind; but this is essentially a negative
approach: let's have TV programmes
for the young ones, because we can't
keep them away from television
anyway.
more fundamental reason¬
ing stresses the Important
positive contribution which television
is able to make in order to "develop
the world within the child and fami¬
liarize it with the world around", as
the producers of one series of pro¬
grammes put it. This approach sees
in television one of the tools to attack
one of the basic sources of social
inequality in our time, the great dispa¬
rity among children of school age
between those who come from well-
to-do homes and a cultured back¬
ground and those who bring with them
the social and cultural deprivation of
their home.
Rather than difference in intelligence,
It is difference in background which
gives rise to the greatest problems In
elementary education, prevents chil¬
dren from rising above the social status
of their parents, and deprives them of
the equality of opportunity through
education one of the fundamental
objectives of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
The underprivileged suffer handicaps
of both body and mind In the race
through life. "Children need certain
basic knowledge to profit even from
kindergarten; children lacking this
knowledge certain words, ideas, hab¬
its fall behind in their work and may
take as long as five years to complete
the third grade", stated a leading edu¬
cator from one of the cities of the
American Midwest.
Her point of view is shared all
around the world. Children who come
to school with a very limited voca¬
bulary and with no idea of the way
nature and the man-made world look
beyond their restricted experience
in urban slums or on a poverty-
stricken farm, are unable to benefit
from education to the same degree
as children who have been more widely
exposed to social and cultural experi¬
ences. It is here that the audiovisual
media of communication, and especially
television, become significant forces
for the democratization of opportuni¬
ties.
It is generally recognized that inborn
intelligence is no more than a potential

In the past decade special efforts have been made to reach
children between the ages of two and six with television programmes.
Well-planned programmes have proved to be effective helpers
for the kindergarten teacher, and regular use Is made of them in some schools.

to be cultivated. Without stimulation
and education, particularly during the
early formative years, such an intelli¬
gence is lost for the future. There is
need, therefore, for a systematic edu¬
cational programme for pre-school
children and a more intensive effort
by both parents and educational Insti¬
tutions; television can effectively assist
such a programme.
While the basic objectives of pre¬
school education are similar in most
countries, the degree to which such
education is carried by the home or the
kindergarten varies not only (or
perhaps mainly) between nations, but
primarily between social classes and
conditions of cultural environment. The
role of television must thus equally
vary In different conditions.
In Venezuela the Audio Visual Centre
of the Ministry of Education produces
a programme entitled En el Jardin de
Infancia. It ¡s transmitted, via the facil¬
ities of a commercial station, primarily
for use in kindergartens, but also for
the benefit of individual families, to
raise the standards and opportunities
not only in Caracas but equally (or
perhaps more particularly) in smaller
communities.
The programmes seek to assist kin¬
dergarten teachers and parents in
activities aimed at developing psycho¬
logical functions and manual skills of
children.
ROGRAMMES are deve¬
loped in close collabo¬
ration with the kindergarten teachers
and designed for follow-up action in
the group under the guidance of the
teacher and through the stimulation of
individual activities.
These programmes have been pro¬
duced continuously since 1960, and
many government and private schools
in Caracas, as well as in other parts
of the country have spontaneously
bought receivers so they could benefit
from these broadcasts. Their effective¬
ness is evident from an opinion survey
among kindergarten teachers who
reported:
"Attendance has become better.
Efficiency in manual skills has Improv¬
ed. Vocabulary Is richer and more
correct. Collaboration... and compre¬
hension are enhanced.
" Television has helped to develop
sight and hearing, to exercise memory
and to stimulate attention. It has in¬
fluenced the children's behaviour."
Kind_ergarten teachers recognize
that the programmes are of value not
only to the children, but to their own
professional training. As so often in
educational television, programmes
which appear to be designed principally
for child audiences are in fact of
supreme value ' In the in-service
training of teachers. Typical is a letter
from one of the kindergarten teachers
to the television teacher in Caracas:
"I have learned a good deal thanks
to you and your programme. I have
taught the children what I learned and
now I can teach with enthusiasm.
Professionally, I have learned a num¬
ber of practical and useful techniques
for teaching children of pre-school age
techniques which were entirely un¬
known to me."
ANY of the values noted
in these reports from Vene¬
zuelan teachers are echoed in other
parts of the world. Expansion of the
child's vocabulary, broadening of his
horizon, stimulation of manual skills
and of creative activities are key ob¬
jectives of kindergarten teaching which
can be directly served by television.
In Japan, the public broadcasting
corporation, NHK, presents a total of
10 hours 15 minutes per week of pro¬
grammes specially aimed at children
under six years. Commercial stations
also have regular programmes for the
very young ones. NTV carries some
11 hours a week of broadcasts primar¬
ily designed to entertain children
through cartoons, quizzes, puppets, au¬
dience participation and physical exer¬
cises. NET, the commercial educa¬
tional station, has three programmes of
70 minutes each (with three repeats)
per week which follow the official
kindergarten curriculum and show to
the children fairy tales and folklore
from Japan and other countries through
dramatic presentations, teach them
good manners and etiquette, and
enhance rhythmical education through
singing and dancing.
In Japan television is popular with
both children and teachers. Throughout
Japan 82.1% of kindergartens and
71.6% of nursery schools have receiv¬
ers, and a survey in 1964 indicated
that the rate of utilizing NHK program¬
mes was 73.5% in kindergartens and
88.2% in nursery schools.
At a recent regional conference of
the National Federation of the Society
for Study of Educational Broadcasts at
Kittakyushu, I pointedly queried some
one hundred kindergarten teachers
about the value of using television.
Does it not tend to create passivity
among children rather than active
expression? And does not the rela¬
tively poor quality with which scenes
of nature and distant places are repro
duced on the TV screen provoke dis¬
tortions in the mind of the child and
impair their value?
Both arguments were recognized as
valid but by no means inevitable prob¬
lems. Programme producers are
conscious of the Importance of stimu¬
lating classroom activities. Captain
Do-re-mi-fa, for Instance, a musical
show designed for the musical educa¬
tion of children, aims particularly to
inspire Interest in music and to let
children move and play In response to
music. Rhythmical education is con¬
sidered of key importance in Japan for
both pre-school and school children,
and believed essential for body control
and the development of a harmonious
personality. Here radio also proves of
great value, and many of the kinder¬
gartens which receive TV programmes,
also use their radio receiver for music¬
al programmes and story telling.
As to the lack of full reality In pro¬
grammes which show nature and social
scenes, it was pointed out that many
children in the sprawling cities of
industrial Japan had few other oppor¬
tunities to see more than their imme¬
diate surroundings. Teachers stressed
the importance of familiarizing children
with unfamiliar scenes, for they arouse
natural curiosity and create a sense
of familiarity which enlarges the voca¬
bulary and provides notions of the
world around which are of great value
to the child in preparation for more
systematic learning at a later age.
HE home situation is the
primary target of the BBC
in Great Britain. Watch With Mother
may well be the oldest television pro¬
gramme still regularly broadcast over
the same national network. Five of
its six series of 26 films were produced
between 1952 and 1955, and have been
repeated regularly ever since. Few
British children today have not grown
up with Andy Pandy, the puppet small
child dressed in "clown" clothes who
plays with toys, sings and dances like
a three-year old with his companion
teddy bear. Other familiar figures of
early childhood fantasies on television
are the Flowerpot men and the glove
puppets, Rag, Tag and Bobtail. While
most of these programmes appeal to
the young child's love for stories and
an imaginary world, a film series made
in Canada using real animals to act
stories of a colony of small animals
(hamster, rat, frog, etc.) called The
Tales of the Riverbank, is also very
popular. J
A more distinctly educational pur¬
pose is served by Play School, a daily

'Much that portends of a halo'

25-minute programme aimed primarily
at the child at home but ready for nur¬
sery school. The eavesdropping au¬
dience goes down to two-year olds and
Includes over a million regular adult
viewers. Children with parents, family
groups and nursery schools watch
but the target remains the intelligent
four-year old sitting alone In front
of the set.
The purpose is to stimulate the child
with ideas and information which affect
him not only during the programme but
long afterwards. There is, in fact,
impressive evidence of long-term
follow-up activities art work (the BBC
receives a steady supply of paintings
for the Play School picture board),
singing, imaginative games and prac¬
tical play.
A report from the producer observes
that "Play School tries to offer a child
at this crucial stage of its develop¬
ment a wider range of subject matter
and a richer canvas of people than
has been customary in past children's
television programmes for this age
range. It takes into account the limit¬
ations restricted terms of reference;
small vocabulary; shorter span of con¬
centration but it makes no concession
apart from this. Talking down is a sin.
False attitudes are stamped on. The
child under five is gullible and all too
easily Influenced for good or bad. Our
responsibility, therefore, lies in not
taking advantage of this but assuming
a taste and discrimination in the under-
five which, like a rather frail flower, can
respond to the hands of the right
gardener."
HE gullibility of young
children is of primary con¬
cern to the producers of programmes.
An American student of communica¬
tions has suggested that "a child's
early exposure to television, regard¬
less of the content, contains much
that portends of a halo. It is all
good. It amuses, entertains, and
watches over the child. The child, left
to his own devices, makes indiscri¬
minate use of the medium. When he
is good, he is rewarded with more
exposure; when bad, he is often
punished by denied use. From these
kinds of contacts, standards, tastes and
discriminations find no formative
roots." Hence the particular respon¬
sibility of those who seek no more
than to attract and amuse the child
audience in order to reach a wide
audience for commercial publicity.
But there are pitfalls on both sides,
as has been found in countries, such as
Australia, where commercial and non¬
commercial programmes compete for
the audience. A primarily purposeful,
didactic approach may fail to involve
the child sufficiently to make an impact
on a large portion of the audience. A
primarily entertainment approach may
fail to leave a constructive impact.
How to balance both approaches is an
issue which faces the television direc¬
tor, and not only in the sphere of pro¬
gramming for pre-school children.
This competitive situation is of parti¬
cular significance to the United States.
Among the commercially most success¬
ful programmes is Romper Room
whose format is also distributed to
many other countries. The programme
emphasizes the. involvement of chil¬
dren, not only on the receiving end but
in the studio itself.'
OME educators feel that to
show little children acting
out their games in front of the camera
is not desirable, that it impairs the
educational impact and leads children
to show off rather than to express
themselves quietly and creatively as
individuals. Others welcome this ap¬
proach as an inducement to the wat¬
ching children to participate in the
action.
Romper Room suggests many activi¬
ties which help keep the youngster
physically fit, and develop his mind
and social adjustment. To familiarize
the child with natural and social
scenes, and thus to enlarge his horizon
and vocabulary, the programme uses
films, pictures and objects to show
foreign lands, interesting professions,
as well as animal life. To develop
"reading-readiness" among children,
they are taught to recognize and draw
letters and numbers, play a game called
"Look 'N' See", as well as a word
game called "Words and Sounds" to
increase their vocabulary.
Here ¡s a slick production designed
to attract, amuse and instruct young
viewers and, incidentally, also to sell
merchandise. On the other side of
American television are the non-com¬
mercial educational television stations
which make special efforts to provide
programmes which are of value to the
children and their parents alike.
Notable among the many program¬
mes produced by these stations is
7V Kindergarten produced at Albu¬
querque, New Mexico. In this state
the need for some new form of pre
school education Is so evident that
many of the usual reservations
about ^.ihe use of television seem
to fall by the wayside. The people
of this state have a trilingual culture;
the basic language of children who
enter school is English, Spanish or
one of the American Indian langua¬
ges, and this diversity in linguistic
and social backgrounds poses a
particular problem for the school
system. Another problem arises be¬
cause the state covers a large but
sparsely populated area. There are
no public kindergartens in New Mexico
and much of the population could not
take advantage of them even if they
were offered.
To meet these educational problems
of cultural diversity and dispersal of
population is one of the primary pur¬
poses of the TV classroom which
reaches many remote areas and makes
proper conditioning for school possi¬
ble. The programme seeks to prepare
the pre-school youngster for his first
school year. Using the standard kin¬
dergarten curriculum as a backbone,
the programme is prepared with the
advice of the educational authorities
and stimulates the child in reading
development, linguistic ability, number
ability and social readiness.
"Recognizing the limitations of only
30 minutes per day with the children,"
adds the report from New Mexico,
"emphasis is placed on assisting
parents to meaningfully guide the child
after the programme Is completed.
Each project is designed to use inex¬
pensive, readily available materials.
Thus, parent education is an important
adjunct to the series."
BSENCE of public kinder¬
gartens, especially in the
lower Income parts of American cities,
is a problem all over the United States
and particularly in the large, urban
areas of the eastern states. Here,
educational television finds one of
its most important tasks. Station
WQED in Pittsburgh produces three
times a week a semi-Instructional
series of programmes for the pre¬
school child entitled QED Kindergar¬
ten. The programme was started in
1963 and is regularly used by fifteen
other eastern U.S. stations as well as
in Chicago and San Francisco. Here,
too the station co-operates closely
with kindergarten teachers and child
development authorities in the elab¬
oration of the programme and the selec¬
tion of the teacher who presents it in

### 19236: Television for the pre-school child

Television can introduce
the young child to
knowledge of all kinds,
from drawing and music
to the mysteries of Nature
and the marvels
of science. It Is often
through television
that children in great
industrial cities first
learn to appreciate the
beauties of the
countryside. In certain
regions, such as
New Mexico, television
programmes prepared with
the help of teachers
help to overcome the
special problem of a
trilingual population. In
Czechoslovakia, traditional
puppet shows help to
stimulate artistic and
mental activity. Right,

front of the camera. Regular feed-back
of reactions from children, parents and
school authorities helps to steer the
programme towards its main objective,
to inform and shape the mind of the
young child, and to draw on entertain¬
ment and amusement to the extent that
it serves to enhance this purpose.
All aboard with Mr. Be, another pro¬
gramme produced by educational tele¬
vision in Memphis, Tennessee, is de¬
signed to prepare the pre-school child
for the first grade and aid in the maxi¬
mum development of his potential. This
programme Is presented in a nostalgic
19th century setting built around the
romance and exciting mobility of trains,
with Mr. Be holding forth as the former
engineer of the olden days who now
lives in a combination train depot and
general store. The store is filled with
Interesting junk, pictures and pets, and
the train is a replica of a famous
Civil War train "The General."
One hundred and eighty-three pro¬
grammes have been recorded on
videotape, many of which introduce the
children to new sights and facts. One
day Mr. Be demonstrates with a home¬
made steam engine how steam is able
to move a train, and tells the story of
railroads up to a modern diesel passen¬
ger train. On another day, he explains
how clocks tell "when" and "how
long", and how in earlier times people
used to tell time by the sun and the
moon. Visits to a shoemaker or a gro¬
cery store, to lions who live in the
jungle or to the bird house in the zoo,
bring knowledge and new words to the
young ones. How electricity is a friend
of man when controlled, but a danger
ous enemy children must beware of
and follow important safety rules, is
another of the many topics of this in¬
structive programme.
One of the arguments against tele¬
vision for children is that it will keep
them from reading, from seeking their
own information at their own pace and
choice. But experience has shown that
television, whether for adults or chil¬
dren, can be as much a stimulator of
reading as a distracting, deadening
force. It is a matter of how TV is used
and how It relates to books. In France,
television has for many years carried
a weekly programme for adults and
a companion programme for children
in which new books and authors are
introduced to the large television
public.
The impact of these programmes is

shown by the eagerness with which
publishers try to get their books
discussed on them. Similarly, tele¬
vision in the United States has also
been a stimulator of reading; many
programmes for young children are
direct TV adaptations of books and
thus contribute directly to their sale
or borrowing in public libraries.
Picture Book Parade ¡s a series of
films directly based on the illustrations
and text of well-known children's
books. Through slow close-up photo¬
graphy, with the camera panning over
pictures, picking up detail or showing
the entire scene, and with the accom¬
paniment of music and text, these
films are a simplified, slow type of
animation whose pace is suited to the
rhythm of child viewers. Local stations
use these films, or produce their own
visual book reports, as part of regular
programmes for school and pre-school
children. These programmes, enter¬
taining in themselves, induce children
to get hold of the books so they can
look at them, or read them if they
have already learned to do so.
E-READING or re-viewing
of the familiar is particu¬
larly satisfying to children, just as they
love to hear the same story over and
over again. Many television produ¬
cers labour under the fallacious as¬
sumption that only novelty counts and
consider it contrary to the style of
the medium to repeat themselves.
But that is not the way children see
it. "My five-year-old has been asking
me to write for weeks to ask you if
we could see 'Red Carpet' again,"
writes a mother from Ithaca, New
York, "We enjoyed the other stories
too and would like to see them all
again and then some new ones."
If television does not provide an
opportunity to see the story again, the
book does. And so many mothers
echo a letter from a housewife in Cali¬
fornia who wrote: "After we watch and
listen, we borrow these books from
the library and get a real thrill out of
re-reading them and getting a long
close look at the pictures." No wonder
such programmes, whether produced
on film or in local educational stations
all over the United States, are parti¬
cularly popular with children's libra¬
rians who welcome the Introduction of
good books to both children and
parents.
Educational television in the United
States is the work of devoted people
who do not have at their disposal any¬
thing like the technical resources and
finance available to commercial sta¬
tions. At Milwaukee, for instance, a
group of performers who work for the
museum, the public school system, the
Bureau of Community Relations, or
who are housewives looking after their
families, come together as volunteers
at the educational station to participate
in Children's Fair, a variety show
geared for viewers aged three to
seven. "Tired of violence in the name
of humour? Then try your children on
a TV diet of Children's Fair," runs the
appeal for this programme whose pro¬
moters donate their time for this daily
half-hour broadcast "to accent the
positive aspects of life and the world
in which we live."
Reaction against the violence of
much of television, whether in pro¬
grammes specifically designed for
them or, more frequently, In general
programmes which are seen eagerly
by children, is one of the prime motives
in the production of programmes by
educational stations.
N outline of the purposes
of The Land of Play, a
programme produced at Michigan
State University, sums up this point
of view: "There is no need and there
is no place for violence in this pro¬
gramme. There are no weapons, no
physical attacks, no verbal barrages.
The stories may be suspenseful, but
not frightening. We use no fear
appeals. This is a happy, light, posi¬
tive programme. The characters who
are involved in the programme are
involved in positive ways. Proper
conduct is rewarded and rewarding . . .
not materially, but other ways. Stories
and situations have morals, but morals
are never drawn from them and pre¬
sented to the child wrapped in the

### 19236: Television for the pre-school child

Opinon surveys among
teachers confirm that young
children are far more
attentive when schools
make use of television.

and comprehension
are improved. Left, two

more intimate knowledge of their
surroundings, to promote feelings of
social adjustment, and "to help them
to understand those actions which are
good and those which should be
blamed."
Here, too, it is emphasized that
"such knowledge should come to small
children by a fascinating game and
not by direct admonition. While
playing and dreaming, children learn
at the same time various useful things.
The programmes for pre-school chil¬
dren do not Include direct teaching of
certain subjects but they do include
enrichment materials for the educa¬
tional programmes of kindergartens."
The Pencil Drawer, for Instance, is a
game -which has been broadcast for
several years and in which an artist
puppet called "Merry Pencil" teaches
children the art of drawing and
explains, at the same time, phenomena
such as why the squirrel dries
mushrooms on the pine tree and why
birds fly off to warmer countries.
"This programme is a great success
among the little ones and the depart¬
ment receives hundreds of letters with
pictures drawn by the children at home
or in the kindergartens under the
guidance of their teachers, nurses or
parents."
Finally, we come to Czechoslovakia,
the country which has perhaps the
greatest tradition in puppetry, in
children's films and now in television
programmes for the little ones, broad¬
cast regularly ever since 1958. A
report from the editor of kindergarten
programmes in Prague reads like a
summary of all that has been said by
producers around the world; for
children are children and have much
the same reactions, Independent of the
culture in which they live, while the
television medium poses similar prob¬
lems and opportunities irrespective of
its particular form of organization and
control.
The danger of passivity In the viewer
is recognized here as elsewhere. The
child viewer "Is Inclined to consume
passively miles of stories, events and
tales, without being forced to strain
his mind," a danger which the pro¬
ducers in Czechoslovakia strive to
combat by seeking "to Incite, Instigate,
inspire and excite our children; we
want to acquaint them with the
unknown world that surrounds them.
We want our viewers to be entertained,
but simultaneously to be instructed."
WHILE initially Czech TV
programmes were aimed
at the entertainment of very young
children, a much closer co-ordination
with preparation for school in kinder¬
gartens is now sought by the producers
who base their programmes on the
official kindergarten curriculum. The
fairy-tale form is considered most
effective in order to Influence and
educate young viewers. They take
children to the farthest corners of the
world and are blended with realistic
reportages about the world of grown¬
ups.
Programmes are popular with kin¬
dergartens, a selected number of which
regularly report back audience reaction
to the station so that programmes may
be adapted to their needs. Producers
seem confident that the programmes
are in fact stimulating artistic and
mental activities, and contributing to
the development of individual capacity
in the child. Programmes are broad¬
cast twice a week (with one repeat)
and on Saturday morning the announcer
acquaints teachers with the content of
subsequent programmes to aid them
in their use. For the producers recog¬
nize the importance of the teacher
"who must not waste the feelings which
the children have experienced during
the programme."
Television serves the child and the
parents, the school, the teacher and
society as a whole when It develops
the personality and broadens the
horizon of youngsters about to enter
school. This educational task responds
to the yearning of children for know¬
ledge, to their love of fantasy and
their curiosity of life. "If it Is said of
adult listeners that you will never
satisfy everyone," states the producer
of Czechoslovak kindergarten pro¬
grammes, "then our smallest listeners
surely form an exception which proves
the rule. Five and six-year-old viewers
do not telephone, do not threaten, do
not make categoric demands. But
naturally they also have wishes and
desires, usually that one of the fairy
tales be repeated. Through adults
they often show us their dissatis¬
faction when they are cheated out
of a programme. But they have always 1 1
been, they are and will probably '
remain the most grateful of television
viewers."

the director of the National
Book Centre of Pakistan examines
READING HABITS
AND BOOK PUBLISHING
IN ASIA
by Ibne Insha
12
HE great expanse called
Asia extends from Iran on
the periphery of the Middle East, to
palmgrove islands of the Pacific, many
thousands of miles eastwards. It
covers a multitude of peoples, cul¬
tures, languages, and scripts; the vast
region comprises radical variations in
terrain, climate, customs, traditions,
modes of living and thinking, as well
as social and environmental situations
generally. The patterns of statehood
and economy differ, too, and the
Interstate cultural affinities are mostly
limited to immediate neighbourhoods.
Yet it is Asia all the same, with
unmistakable features of identity and
similarity.
All these countries are what we call
developing countries . All share a
considerable, in some cases disturb¬
ingly high rate of illiteracy, and all
are trying to improve the situation by
employing breakthrough literacy pro¬
grammes. Most have neither a very
high living standard or per capita rate
of income, and the inadequacy of
means of communication is a general
handicap. All need a quickened pace
of progress In technological fields; and
the advancement and modernity of
Japan, for instance, is still a rare
phenomenon in this region.
Most are tradition-bound and have
often disregarded the utilitarian aspects
of education. Even the learning of
the three Rs has amounted to the
achievement of knowledge for its own
sake, or, at best, has been regarded
as a key to professions like teaching,
the priesthood or the judiciary. Now,
however, the emphasis is changing In
IBNE INSHA, Pakistani author, poet and
literary critic, is director of the National
Book Centre of Pakistan, Karachi. He has
carried out surveys of reading habits in his
country and has organized many book
festivals, exhibitions and seminars. This
article is adapted from a paper he contribut¬
ed to the meeting of experts on book
production and distribution in Asia, held
in Tokyo in May.
favour of the sciences. Many of the
countries in this region have been
under foreign domination or influence
for extended periods and are only now
changing over, or going back, to na¬
tional languages as media of educa¬
tion. This has a considerable bear¬
ing on reading preferences of the
better educated classes.
What deters a potential reader?
We may enumerate the deterrents to
the use and enjoyment of books as:
illiteracy; low purchasing power; non¬
availability of specific reading matter;
lack of information about availability
of books; inadequate library systems;
inadequate book promotion.
How to induce people to read. Of
the deterrents named, abolition of
illiteracy is of fundamental importance,
yet we are not concerned with it direct¬
ly here. Our immediate concern is to
induce those who are literate to read,
and to encourage them to go beyond
their textbooks. Our typical client is
a man with a reasonable measure of
schooling (about four years) and a
modest purchasing power. The prob¬
lem is to make reading a "felt need"
for him.
He must come to realize that as a
student, he stands to gain by extend¬
ing his area of study not only for
examinations but later in life. If he
works in a factory or an office, reading
can help to improve his efficiency and
prospects. A businessman can profit
from books imparting information
concerning his affairs. A farmer is
likely to be interested In better agri¬
cultural methods, and a mechanic In
the techniques of his trade. A house¬
wife needs books on cookery, knit¬
ting or child-care. But of course, all
of them need books for general read¬
ing poetry, fiction, travel, history,
biography and general subjects. But
basically it is the potential reader,
man, woman or child, who should feel
the urge to read, and that urge has
sometimes to be created.
To be a reader requires a reasonable

### 19865: Reading habits and book publishing in Asia

In recent years Asian countries have made a tremendous effort to increase their book production and
distribution. But to do so they have had to overcome formidable obstacles: high density of population,
shortage of technical resources and capital. In May 1966, Unesco convened an important meeting to study
the possibilities of developing Asia's book publishing Industry. Photo shows young readers in a Singapore street.
endure for a lifetime. Perhaps some
sort of test based on non-textbooks
read by a student might be introduced
at the end of his course. School
libraries need to be better equipped,
too, for a broad, basic and enlighten¬
ing education.
A network of public libraries. A
student's awakened interest in reading
will, in time, lead him to the public
library and the bookshop. In Asia, we
need a network of local libraries in
cities and towns as well as in rural
areas. Such a network would provide
a much needed fillip to the publishing
and the bookselling trade. In the
United States and the United Kingdom,
from 75% to 90% of children's books
are bought by libraries; the rest are
sold by bookshops to the individual
buyer. A similar, even a much smaller
ratio of consumption would result in
a vigorous publishing Industry in Asia.
Street lending libraries. The role
of street lending libraries and mobile
libraries is significant, too. In India and
Pakistan, street libraries known popu¬
larly as "Anna Libraries" have existed
and flourished for long. At one time
one could take out a book daily for an
anna (1/1 6th of a rupee, a pre-metric
system coin) and a voracious reader
was welcome to more than one book
for the same fee. A survey has shown
that housewives and students predo¬
minate as the clientele of these insti¬
tutions.

the authorities should suppress them.
It may be so. But some way should
be found to improve rather than close
them.
Experiments are being conducted
with mobile libraries and "box libra¬
ries" In some countries. The mobile
libraries, which constitute the well of
knowledge that goes to the thirsty have
been very useful but their number is
limited and needs to be increased.
Box librairies contain standard sets
of books catering to different tastes.
These are supplied by community de¬
velopment organizations to community
centres in rural areas and circulate
from village to village. It is a good
way to make literates life-long readers.
The "home library" is one of the
most effective ways to develop book-
buying habits in Asia; ¡t incorporates
the features of book clubs as we know
them to work in the West. A home
library can be run by a single publisher
who has a strong and varied list, or
by a wholesale bookseller.
What is a home library? An instal¬
ment plan relying on a strong body of
patrons or subscribers. Books are
dispensed on attractive terms, and the
initial offer is often too alluring to be
resisted. As can be seen in advertise¬
ments of book clubs, the bestsellers
of the season are offered at extremely
low prices to new members if they
undertake to buy a specified number
of books in a year, from a large
selection offered, and at a specially
low price.
A model plan for a home library for
Asian countries has been devised by
the consultant to the All India Home
Library Plan Society, Artur Isenberg.
Subscribers are asked to pay 5 ru¬
pees (about one dollar) monthly, for
18 months, or a total of 90 rupees.
In return subscribers who complete the
subscription period receive 100 rupees
worth of books which they can select
from a list of over 500 titles. In
addition, each subscriber receives free
of charge a number of bonus books
as well as a monthly magazine, plus
free packing and mailing of books.
A modest discount (of about
10%) on book orders placed after
subscriptions have been taken out may
be given; or other facilities such as
limited credit made available.
The subscriber who does not com¬
plete his subscription period does not
receive the considerable extra benefits
mentioned above, but he does receive
his money's worth of books of his own
choice. His accounts are credited with
any payments he may have made and
debited with the cost, at list price, of
any books, including bonus books, sup¬
plied to him, as well as with the cost
of posting them and also the magazine
issues sent to him up to the premature
closing of his subscription account. In
other words, the incomplete subscrip
tion is treated like any other retail
book purchase.
Different organizations initiating
home library plans In India are reported
to have sold more than 10 lakhs of
rupees ($210,000) worth of books since
the first such scheme was launched in
January 1960. Since the bulk of the
clientele is that section not normally
reached by bookshops or other con¬
ventional outlets, it really means that
a new sector of the literate public is
acquiring the book reading habit.
The economics of a home library
system are: small profits per sub¬
scriber, multiplied by a large number
of subscribers into an attractive overall
profit.
simple variation, especially
for children, would be
something like the "Paisa Library" of
Lahore which flourished in the early
1940s; we might call it a "Farthing
Library" or a "Penny Library."
The "Paisa Library" scheme was
designed to promote saving as well
as the book reading habit. Children's
books are usually purchased by par-
rents, but this scheme gave the child¬
ren a sense of importance since the
books were bought out of their own
meagre pocket money. The child had
to save one paisa a day, which made
30 paisas a month (less than half a
rupee, or ten U.S. cents). The sum
was sent to the promoters, a leading
firm of publishers, who issued a child¬
ren's magazine of long standing, and
all correspondence, dispatch and other
costs were paid out of these ten cents.
The child received a new book each
month for about seven cents net.
The important underlying idea was
to encourage the buying of books out
of one's own resources as opposed
to receiving books as a present. The
project was abandoned after more than
fifty titles had been published, ranging
from 72 to 112 pages. The war raised
the cost of materials and everything
else involved in production, and it
became impossible to continue the
"a paisa a day" project. The hall¬
mark of the scheme had been inexpen-
siveness which still is the prime con¬
sideration in most countries, and the
system is well worth trying again.
The importance of book festivals and
book exhibitions in developing the
reading habit in Asia cannot be over¬
emphasized. It is one of the striking
ways of bringing books to the atten¬
tion of potential readers and informing
people that the books they are inter¬
ested in have actually been published.
Admittedly there is a shortage in
Asian countries of books in certain
fields, particularly science and techno¬
logy, or biography and literary criti¬
cism, but the books that are available
are not always known to the general
public.
I wish I could quote from the register
of comments we keep for every book
exhibition. The response is so great
that there are always requests by indi¬
viduals and especially educational in¬
stitutions for these book exhibitions to
be prolonged. It is really exhilarating
to see students eagerly queuing to
browse among the stalls, and reading
books on the spot. Such book exhibi¬
tions should be of a general as well
as a specialized nature, to attract
particular strata of readers.
Our experience shows that book
exhibitions should be accompanied by
sales arrangements. People who see
good books exhibited are disappointed
not to find them readily available for
purchase and by the time they return
home other considerations dampen
their enthusiasm and customers for
books are thereby lost.
In order to increase the book reading
habit, book exhibitions need to be
better advertised or publicized, either
in the book supplement section of daily
newspapers, or through posters,
streamers and radio/TV programmes
where possible. It is always good
policy in Asia to declare a sale at
discount for the duration of an exhibit¬
ion in order to attract potential book
buyers. During the Pakistan National
Book Festival of 1964, for example, all
books were available at 10 % discount,
not only at the door of the exhibition,
where sale arrangements^ were pro¬
vided, but in city bookshops as well.
Every bookseller could afford to give
a 10 % discount without asking for
special arrangements from publishers.
In this connexion I should mention
that it is not generally known, even
in Pakistan, that money used to buy
books can be deducted from income
tax in Pakistan. The National Book
Centre of Pakistan recently produced
a poster to publicize this little known
fact and this has had a marked effect
on the sale of books.
"Book Festival" is a much more
attractive name for general annual
events than "Book Exhibition," and it
should be given a festive look. In
Pakistan, we gave away free of charge
thousands of balloons with slogans,
book marks and illustrated book lists
during the festival.
Movable feasts of books should
be provided through bookmobiles, visit¬
ing educational institutions, industrial
housing areas and other suburbs with
displays of books, and carrying extra
portable wire book racks and addi¬
tional stock for display outside the
van.
More and better book vending. Book
buying is incentive buying. Books
would surely sell in greater numbers
if a potential reader had the chance to
look at them. This takes us to the

## [Page 15](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/020805engo.pdf#page=15) 0

### 19865: Reading habits and book publishing in Asia

need for more bookshops or book
outlets with "browsing" facilities. In
the West, these are offered by the
drugstore or department store. In Asia,
we should make use of restaurants,
general stores, fairs and festivals or
other places where people congregate.
In Iran and in Andhra Pradesh, India,
this has proved a great success. The
success of Iranian paperbacks is based
on a shift of emphasis from the book¬
shop to the news-stand and similar
outlets. As a result, bookshop sales
now represent only one half of total
book sales. Millions of new readers
are being created among people who
hitherto were outside the orbit of
conventional booksellers. Bookmo¬
biles or bookshops on wheels run by
cooperatives of publishers and book¬
sellers would also help to boost sales.
Though primarily a commercial en¬
terprise, a bookshop also plays an
important cultural role. Municipal and
other local bodies in Asia should there¬
fore be pursuaded to reserve centrally
located stalls and kiosks for book
vending and to lease them on special
terms. Asia's railway bookstalls would
do well to provide a larger variety
of books. Enlarged book vending fa¬
cilities at the terminals and stopping
places of other forms of transportwould
also do much to stimulate book buying.
I T is imperative, of course,
for the reader to be told
what books are available. A need
therefore exists for more subject lists
of functional bibliographies to guide
readers. Trade papers could do much
in this respect if their scope was wid¬
ened to include reviews and articles
on books.
The National Book Centre of Paki¬
stan has Itself published a book list
of currently available children's litera¬
ture. Arranged by subject and carry¬
ing an authors' index, the list gives
details of the volume, illustrations,
content and price of books. Another
list published by the Centre covers
reference books and book on Paki¬
stan. Such subject bibliographies do
much to promote book sales. They
should, however, be based on com¬
pletely objective selections of books
so as to make them clearly distinguish¬
able from publishing trade catalogues.
They should be modestly, even nomin¬
ally priced to allow distribution on the
widest scale.
Good books are not usually cheap,
and cheap books, in turn, are not
always good. The ideal situation of
good books at cheap prices is a para¬
dox to a book producer. Paperbound
books, while revolutionizing the distri¬
bution systems, have tried to reconcile
the two situations and can be consider¬
ed as an answer to the growing needs
of Asian readers with modest pur¬
chasing power. Mass production is a
prerequisite, however, since the profit
margin of publisher, bookseller and
author on a paperback is far lower than
in the case of a hard cover edition.
According to one graph, the publisher's

Although book production in many Asian countries is expanding, the number
of books bought by the people of the region is still no more than one-thirtieth
to one-sixtieth of that in the industrialized nations. Asian countries also
need three times as many textbooks. Travelling bookshops, like this one
in Ceylon, help to ease the book famine, but many more are needed.
A revival of the "penny book clubs" which enabled children
to buy a book each month for a very small sum has been proposed.

net profit on a paperback retailing at
2/6 (stg.) is about 2 %. On a hard¬
cover book it would be about 15 %.
Paperback publishing deserves the
utmost support and encouragment.
Prerequisites are cheaper raw ma¬
terials, modern printing and binding
facilities and also the services of
technicians trained by European paper¬
back publishing firms.
One Asian country, Iran, has
developed a very successful paper¬
back series entitled "Kltabhai-Jebi",
one of whose important innovations
is a uniform sales discount. Whatever
the price of a book, the retailer gets
five rials (about 7 U.S. cents), and
unsold books are collected and
replaced by the publisher's repres¬
entatives. Western publishers should
be asked to charge nominal copyright
fees in order to encourage similar
enterprises.
For the illustrated books needed
by children, and sometimes published
in colour, arrangements for a central
and syndicated production of il¬
lustrations are advisable, as was re¬
commended by the Teheran Seminar
in 1964. The Franklin Organization,
operating in some Asian countries,
has tried this successfully. Illustrations
for everyday science books by
Bertha Morris Parker, published
simultaneously In Arabic, Urdu and
Persian, were produced centrally in
Teheran, and the different language
texts were printed in other countries.
The writer has experimented with
most of the book promotion measures
described here, as Director of the
National Book Centre of Pakistan, an
organization created on Unesco's
initiative, which seeks to encourage
book development on progressive
lines and to promote reading habits.
We should like to see similar book
promotion organizations, transcending
professional interests, set up on a
national basis, and then loosely
federated on a regional footing.
Ceylon, Iran and India already have
such agencies, and In recent years
the Unesco Centre for Reading
Materials in South Asia, from its
headquarters in Karachi, has actively
promoted an exchange of information
designed to encourage book pro¬
duction and development.
The Unesco Centre issues a
magazine, sponsors surveys of reading
habits, arranges professional training
"workshops" and helps to create a
dialogue between representatives of
the book world in South Asia.
This has involved Pakistan, India,
Burma and Ceylon, which have been
in the Centre's orbit for about ten
years, to a greater degree than other
countries such as Iran, Nepal,
Afghanistan and Thailand. As the
Centre's orbit is expanding and as
mass co/nmunication programmes are
likely to be given a new stimulus, a
closer integration can be expected in
the years to come.

to expand his science to the point
where forecasts for longer periods
and even, perhaps, the dream of one

realities.
For thousands of years, men have
observed their local weather, noting
its regularities and lamenting its many
irregularities. They have naturally
looked to the skies for knowledge, but
their limited view of the world's
weather restricted and confined their
knowledge and power to predict.
For almost 100 years, meteorologists
of the world have together sought to
expose the physical laws behind
weather and climate. This, of course,
has been no easy task. Unlike other
scientists, meteorologists cannot easily
carry their research into the laboratory,

study on this miniature scale, and
certainly far too large for any one

country to undertake a sufficiently
wide-scale study.
When the study of weather became
the science of meteorology, men of
every nation realized that their fore¬
casts and research would be inade¬
quate unless they were based on
global data and that their understand¬
ing of weather processes could only
be translated into useful knowledge
by international exchange and co¬
operation. World meteorology has
become an active 24 hours a day
science, rushing to meet a host of
forecast deadlines. It has become
one of the finest examples of interna¬
tional co-operation.
Meteorological satellites and other
new techniques have increased the
need for international co-operation.
The U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., for example,
co-operate closely in weather satellite
activities through plans for the co¬
ordination of launching programmes
and through the establishment, in 1964,
of the Washington-Moscow line for
direct transmission of satellite cloud
photographs and other meteorological
information.
In 1961, the General Assembly of
the U.N. called on the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization to develop a plan
which would ensure:
that these new devices are fully
used to advance man's knowledge
of the basic physical forces affect¬
ing weather and the possibility of
large-scale weather modification,
and
that this knowledge is used to
develop the existing forecasting
capabilities of all member states.
This recent chapter in meteorological
history and to date its most important
really began on April 1, 1960, when
Tiros I was launched by the U.S.A.
Since that day, ten in the Tiros family
of satellites have been put into orbit,
and one other experimental satellite
called Nimbus. Although Tiros and
Nimbus were intended primarily for
research, the many thousands of photo¬
graphs they have taken and relayed
to earth have also proved of immediate
value to forecasters. Timely warnings
of hurricane and typhoon formations
have been derived from photographs
taken by practically all Tiros satellites.
The satellite stores its cloud photo¬
graphs on magnetic tape and relays
them to earth as electronic signals
when it comes within range of a ground
receiving station. The satellite can
transmit as many as 32 photographs
in three minutes to a read-out station,
where the signals are converted into
pictures, and where electronic com¬
puters are used to insert latitudinal and
longitudinal grids to give the geogra¬
phical location. This information is
then flashed to the world within six
hours of orbit time.
One of the latest satellite devices
is the Automatic Picture Transmission
or APT system. The APT television
system automatically transmits cloud
pictures every 208 seconds during the
daylight hours. Using a relatively
simple and Inexpensive piece of receiv¬
ing equipment, any country can

satellite as soon as it comes within
their range. These on-the-spot pho
tographs give valuable local informa¬
tion to forecasters.
Nor is the satellite inactive at night.
Infra-red detectors measure radiation,
the relative temperatures of land, sea
and cloud surfaces, the geographical
distribution of water vapour and the
height of cloud tops. They can indi¬
cate where on the earth's surface there
is a net gain or loss of energy from
the sun. This information is invaluable
for research into long-range forecast¬
ing. The Soviet satellite Cosmos 92
has already given extensive information
on terrestrial radiation and temperature
variations through the atmosphere.
On February 3, 1966, the Tiros
Operation Satellite system was initiat¬
ed with the launching of Essa I at
Cape Kennedy. Essa I, and its
descendants, will obtain cloud pictures
over the entire sunlit portion of the
earth at least once every 24 hours.
A new weather observation window
was placed in space in August 1966
with the launching of the Soviet
satellite Cosmos 122. This satellite
is now transmitting to ground centres
television pictures of clouds covering
substantial parts of the earth's surface:
Cosmos 122, however, is also equipp¬
ed with instruments for making
radiation measurements in the infra¬
red band and can thus take "pictures"
of cloud systems during darkness,
thereby enabling meteorologists to
compare cloud pictures made in the
visible spectrum band with those made
in infra-red rays.
Cosmos 122 is also carrying out
another important piece of meteorolo¬
gical research measurement of the

THE WEATHER (Continued)
No weather data
for four-fifths
of earth's surface
intensity of outgoing radiation. Solar
radiation reaching the earth's surface
is the main source of energy and the
cause of atmospheric motion. In
analyzing atmospheric processes,
scientists need to know how much
solar energy has reached the earth's
surface and in what areas, how much
is reflected back to space and how
much heat energy is being emitted by
the earth's surface and the atmosphere
to outer space. Instruments Installed
in Cosmos 122 are collecting impor¬
tant data on this radiation balance in
the earth-atmosphere system. This
information is transmitted to offices
of the U.S.S.R. Hydrometeorological
Service as well as to the meteorolo¬
gical services and research institutes
of other countries.
In six short years, meteorological
satellites have graduated from the
experimental class to the fully oper¬
ational.
Developments in space technology,
automatic data processing and tele¬
communications will bring great
changes to meteorology and to meteo¬
rological practices throughout the
world. Change and development in
this science have become more impor¬
tant than ever before.
Although more has been discovered
about weather in the past 50 years
than in all previous history, there is a
greater urgency behind each country's
need for a more perfect understanding
of weather processes and for improved
meteorological practices.
he weather may be no
more malicious, no more
devastating, no more kind than 20 or
100 years ago, but the world today
is more sensitive to extremes. Our
greater population, urbanization, in¬
dustrialization, and increased depend¬
ency on agricultural production, make
us more and more vulnerable to the
whims of weather. What was once
regarded as just a severe storm, or
unusually wet, cold or dry conditions
now quickly assumes the proportions
of a national disaster. Financial losses
soar to increasingly staggering heights.
And the more complex our civilization
becomes, the more damage the
weather can cause.

THE WEATHER (Continued)
Can science change tomorrows weather?
22
The meteorologist urgently requires
information and lots of it. For every
24 hours, about 100,000 observations
of weather conditions at the earth's
surface and about 11,000 observations
of the upper atmosphere are recorded
and distributed throughout the world
under the present international weather
system. These observations come
from some 8,000 land stations, from
3,000 aircraft and 4,000 ships.
Formidable as these figures are,
they only represent adequate Informa¬
tion for 20 % of the earth's surface.
Large areas of the world have yet to
yield vital information. The oceans
and deserts have long defied the appl¬
ication of normal observing methods.
Satellite photographs are now filling
in many gaps on the world weather
map, and it is expected that new
techniques, such as more sophisticated
satellite sensors for the measurement
of temperature and moisture distribu¬
tion and surface winds, and automatic
weather stations, meteorological buoys
and constant-level balloons will fill
many more. The satellite will be a
messenger as well as an observer,
passing information from these auto¬
matic stations and balloons to data
collection centres.
The forecaster needs information,
but he also needs to receive and pro¬
cess it with all possible speed and
accuracy.
Feed a satellite photograph to a
computer and in an amazingly short
time it has painted a portrait in letters,
the shades of black and white in the
photograph becoming a variety and a
pattern of symbols. This new "photo¬
graph" is but one piece of information
the computer will use in producing
other analyses.
The computer can perform a million
calculations a second, assimilate infor¬
mation from thousands of observation
points all over the world, sort it. sift
it, following faithfully the instructions
contained in intricate mathematical
equations and print out. finally, the
probable pattern of the atmosphere.
It is a "forecast" for the forecaster.

Numerical models of the atmos¬
phere, the basic instructions fed to
the computer, are a reflection of the
meteorologist's knowledge and of the
development of new computer tech¬
niques. As his knowledge Is incom¬
plete, so is the computer's "forecast".
When a computer produces a cyclone
moving across the Atlantic at 500
m.p.h. (the average cyclone travels at
a sedate 15 m.p.h.), the meteorologist
knows that somewhere along the line
there is a missing quantity in his set
of equations. The perfection of these
equations is yet another problem for
the weatherman to overcome.
The World Meteorological Organ¬
ization was quick to realize that revolu¬
tionary developments in space tech¬
nology, computing and telecommuni¬
cations were too broad and far-reach¬
ing in their implications to be simply
incorporated into the existing intern¬
ational weather system. An entirely
new approach was called for. A new
concept was needed, which would
extract full value from these new
developments, unite them with more
conventional methods and allow both
research and operational work every
chance of developing and complement¬
ing each other.
The answer is the World Weather
Watch (WWW). It may best be
described as a kind of international
nervous system, highly sensitive and
capable of immediate reaction to
change in weather throughout the
globe. Many thousands of points at
the earth's surface and in the upper
atmosphere will register any slight
change in weather conditions. Satell¬
ites will provide the eyes and the
overall view. Three world centres at
Melbourne, Moscow and Washington
and a limited number of regional
centres will be the brains and memory
of the system, receiving great volumes
of data and processing them by com¬
puter. An elaborate network of tele¬
printer and facsimile links will quickly
convey pictorial and written information
to each component of the system.
Men, money and machines, all the
resources of meteorology throughout
the world, will be poured into this
new system. Highly industrialized
nations in the temperate zone, develop¬
ing countries in tropical and sub¬
tropical regions, countries marooned
in the vast oceans of the southern
hemisphere, all, regardless of their
stage of development, will have access
to the same global information. For
those countries whose weather ser¬
vices are still in their Infancy, this
will enable them to "leapfrog" over
50 years of scientific and technical
development.

It is an easy matter to draw up a

All methods of observation, commu¬

visualized that satellites will collect
reports from automatic weather sta¬
tions, floating balloons and meteorolo¬

on to the world centres. Communi¬

by using satellites for the exchange

general circulation of the atmosphere
accumulates, the forecaster will en¬
deavour to extend the period of his
prediction.
When the meteorologist can produce
mathematical models which are faithful
to the atmosphere, the computer will
not only forecast accurately, it should
also help him to anticipate what would
happen to the world's weather if man
diverted the Gulf Stream, dammed the
Bering Strait, poured oil on the
oceans, or blackened the Arctic Ice.
By coating large areas of ocean with
chemicals, for example, he might
reduce evaporation and therefore the
heavy rainfall and violent storms in
tropical regions. By blackening the
Arctic ice, he might reduce loss of
energy by reflection and make neigh¬
bouring wastelands more habitable.
But he can only embark on such large-
scale modifications when he is per¬
fectly confident that their long-range
effects will be entirely beneficial.
The weather will be robbed of its
power to catch us unawares, and may
instead be harnessed for man's greater
comfort and prosperity.

the dawn of history. But now, in a brief moment of time, all this will end.
The coming of the communications satellite will make it impossible for any
human group indeed, any individual to be more than a few milliseconds
from any other. The social consequences of this, for good or evil, may be
as great as those brought about by the printing press or the internal combus¬

COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE (Continued)
Orbital post offices
telephones and newspapers
The progress of astronautics since
the opening of the space age in 1957
has been so phenomenal that all the
technical problems of the synchronous
satellite should be solved by the mid-
seventies. Millions need no longer be
spent, as they are at present, in the
vain quest for absolute component
reliability. The communications satel¬
lites may not be permanently inhabited,
but they will be regularly serviced by
low-thrust ferries which can bring
repair crews to deal with any emerg¬
ency within a couple of hours. For by
1975, of course, there will be numerous
manned space complexes in orbit, to
conduct scientific research and to
operate the presently unimaginable
zero-gravity, high-vacuum industries of
the next generation. The communi¬
cations satellites of the later part of
this century may be part of these sys¬
tems, and will share their servicing
facilities.
With the development of space tech¬
nology, therefore, all but one of the
synchronous satellite's present limita¬
tions will pass swiftly into history.
Rockets are already under develop¬
ment that can put many tons of pay-
load into the twenty-four hour orbit;
nuclear reactors such as Snap-8 could
provide enough power for direct TV
transmission to home receivers. Al¬
though those concerned with today's
satellites have to use the tools current¬
ly at hand, they should not let present
difficulties and failures condition their
thinking. But I certainly do not envy
them their problems, for every commu¬
nications satellite built during the next
ten years will be obsolete as soon as
it Is launched.
The only fundamental objection to
the synchronous satellite Is the pro¬
pagation time lag, which of course
does not affect radio or TV services,
but only telephony. I am convinced
that once the inevitability of this time
lag is understood and users are taught
the proper speaking procedure, they
will have no difficulty in handling it.
Every generation comes to grips with
new techniques; our fathers had to
learn to use the dial telephone, our
grandfathers, the telephone itself. We
are currently grappling with long-dis¬
tance dialling and ten-figure numbers;
our children may think nothing of end¬
ing each stretch of conversation with
"over" and it would probably improve
our own telephone procedure, and
shorten our talking time, if we did this
even now.
In any event, if the delay does prove
to be intolerable, then we can establish
low-altitude satellites (perhaps in
accurately sub-synchronous twelve,
eight, six or three-hour orbit6) purely
for telephony. These might provide a
first-class, premium rate service; the
cheap rate would be through the
twenty-four-hour satellites. (As a
much longer term possibility, It might
be mentioned that there are a number
of theoretical ways of achieving a
low-altitude, twenty-four-hour satellite;
but they depend upon technical devel¬
opments unlikely to occur in this cen¬
tury. I leave their contemplation as
"an exercise for the student".)
It seems clear, therefore, that the
next ten years will be an interim, tran¬
sitional period, characterized by small
low-powered satellites of the Telstar,
Relay and Syncom type. Transmis¬
sions from these will be received only
by very elaborate and expensive
ground tracking stations, which can
feed signals into national networks.
There will be no question of direct
broadcasting to the home viewer or
listener; he will still have to rely on
his existing local stations, if any, and
must accept what they choose to give
him.
Even so, the communications satel¬
lites of the next few years will have a
major Impact on world affairs, and part¬
icularly upon relations between the
United States and Europe. Telstar
proved this In the first few weeks of
operation, when it established the first
TV bridge across the Atlantic. As in
the case of the first Atlantic cable a
hundred years earlier, contact was
Intermittent; but again, as in that
case it will soon become permanent.
Because they share many common

possess extensive rebroadcasting facil¬
ities, and are separated by a relatively .
small time differential, the Americas
and Western Europe will obviously be
the first to benefit from communic¬
ations satellites. Some of the services
which may reasonably be expected,
either experimentally or on a full oper¬
ational basis, during the next decade
are:
The Orbital Post Office. It has been
pointed out by S. Metzger that a single
5 mc/s satellite has enough inform¬
ation-handling capacity to carry all
first-class and airmail correspondence
between the United States and Eu¬
rope. Delivery time would be reduced
to approximately half, the limit being
set by the physical collection and dis¬
tribution of the mail. One of the chief
problems involved in this system is
psychological; how would the public
react to a postal service in which its
letters could be read by unauthorized
persons at any point? However, it
accepted wartime V-mail; and for really
confidential correspondence, there
would be no difficulty in developing
private electronic coding systems, so
that only the right recipient could
receive readable copies.
As ground facilities improve, to keep
up with the possibilities offered by the
satellites, we may expect high-speed
facsimile systems to spread to at least
all important towns. For business (as
opposed to personal) needs, the dis¬
tinction between mail, telegram and
teletype will rapidly blur. In each case,
transmission time will approach zero,
with profound effects upon Industry
and public affairs, and a speeding up
of the tempo of life.
Orbital Newspapers. The simulta¬
neous setting of international editions
has already been demonstrated. In¬
fluential newspapers such as The Times
of London and the New York Times
will experience a great increase in
distribution and immediacy. One of
the first countries to benefit from this
will be, rather ironically, the United
States, which has never possessed a
really national newspaper. In the
longer run, however, the newspaper
as we have known it for the last three
hundred years cannot be expected to
survive the advent of communications
satellites; ultimately, the home presen¬
tation will become purely electronic.
Intercontinental Telephony. As more
and more band widths are made avail¬
able, there will be a tremendous in¬
crease in long-distance telephony. It
is impossible to set a limit to this; man
is a talkative animal, and all estimates
that have been made of his need for
communication have been swiftly sur¬
passed. Although transatlantic calls
may not be substantially cheaper
during the next decade, I suspect that
well before the end of this same cen¬
tury all telephone calls to anywhere
may be charged at the same flat rate.
(How much of the present cost of a
call goes to maintain the equipment
that merely calculates the bill?) Even¬
tually, the telephone may become a
free public service; It will have the
same status as the water supply, for
in the society of the future it will be
equally essential. Any tax on free
communication is detrimental to the
public interest.
The full consequences of swift,
cheap, and universal person-to-person
telephony (and later television) cannot
possibly be anticipated at this stage.
One can only hint at some trends
which may become apparent during the
next decade, and dominant during the
one that follows. They are:
A great decline in personal corres¬
pondence, continuing the trend already
started by the telephone and conse¬
quently reducing the need for the "Or¬
bital Post Office" just when it becomes
technically possible.
A correspondingly great increase in
long-distance personal contacts. The
situation will develop over the whole
world that now exists in great cities,
when intimate friends may talk to each
other every day but seldom meet. This
would have been totally inconceivable
only a hundred years ago.
A steep decline in transportation for
other than pleasure purposes. Effi-

COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE (Continued)
Blackboard in the sky for multimillion classes
cient communications and efficient
transportation are, to some extent,
opposing influences. If either were
perfect (i.e. free and instantaneous)
there would be no need for the other.
Thus one can envisage the time, in
the not too distant future, when con¬
ferences could be conducted with
none of the participants leaving their
own countries or even their homes.
It may be objected that much of the
important work at such conferences
takes place in private and behind-the-
scenes negotiations between indi¬
viduals, not amenable to telecommuni¬
cations. But even this will cease to be
true as person-to-person services
multiply. A generation from now, a
delegate in Canberra may be able to
locate one in Washington much more
easily than either could do so today,
if they were both looking for each
other among the many committee
rooms, private suites, simultaneous
lecture sessions, dining rooms and
bars typical of a large International
conference circa 1960.

ow let us look a little
further ahead, to the se¬
cond phase in the development of
communications satellites particularly
the Impact of direct broadcasting on
the undeveloped countries. This,
coupled with the timely invention of
the transistor, may give a great stimu¬
lus to radio; though we usually asso¬
ciate satellites with television, it must
not be forgotten that most areas of
this planet cannot yet receive reliable,
good quality sound.
However, radio brings us immedi¬
ately to the question of language. A
single orbital transmitter can broadcast
high-fidelity sound to half the world
but can it provide programmes of
equal interest to the Congo Pygmy,
the Afghan tribesman, the Greenland
Eskimo, the man-about-Manhattan?
Obviously not, until they share a
common language and, at least to
some extent, a common culture.
Communications satellites will make
a basic world language mandatory.
Just as (in quite recent times) all men
had to learn to read so that they could
work and even survive in modern
society, so in the one world of the
very near future they will have to
possess a language in common.
The full potentiality of educational
programmes from satellites could not
be exploited, however, until the arrival
of vision; one could hardly teach the
written language without this aid
(though a great deal could be done
with the help of leaflets keyed to the
programme and distributed in advan¬
ce). And here I would like to make a
suggestion for an interesting compro¬
mise between radio and full-scale TV.
I t should be possible to
develop a cheap and sim¬
ple slow-scan facsimile-plus-sound
receiver which could operate on the
normal radio band width, without
requiring the approximately thousand¬
fold greater spectrum space needed by
TV. Such a device could reproduce
line drawings and cartoons (halftones
would be unnecessary) at a perfectly
adequate speed for educational purp¬
oses, where the same picture has to
stay in view for a minute or more. It
would be the remote equivalent of the
teacher's blackboard, and with its aid,
even language could be taught to peo¬
ples who did not share a single world
of their instructor's tongue. It would
thus be possible to tape programmes
suitable for multimillion classes.
The impact of such a device every
element of which lies completely within
existing technologies upon preliterate
societies can perhaps be judged by
the following example.
In 1948 Monseñor Jose J. Salcedo,
appalled by the poverty and illiteracy
in his parish, set up a small radio
transmitter in the mountain village of
Sutatenze (Colombia). His facilities
were quite limited but his objectives
were large; reduction of illiteracy and
provision of useful information. Start¬
ing with a few hours of broadcasting
on Saturday evenings to fifteen
receivers and an audience of some
5,000 listeners, Monseñor Salcedo's
programme had grown by 1954 to six
hours of daily broadcasting to 16,000
receivers and 200,000 listeners... By
1960 there were in excess of one
million student listeners... With a very
modest investment, Monseñor Salcedo
has radically transformed rural life
over a large part of Colombia.
Through communal reception, support¬
ed by first-level maintenance by parish
priests, he has provided a broadcasting
system suited to the meagre resources
of the people and responsive to their
needs.
This gives a foretaste of what may
be done by satellite communications
to reduce illiteracy and ignorance if
we decide to devote them to this ser
vice rather than to selling soap. (Not
that I am against soap, but I am
against pretending that one soap is
better than any other, and feel that it
is essentially degrading to the commu¬
nications industry to be dependent
upon such impostures.)
Because the slow-scan receiver
would require a bandwidth of less than
10 kc/s, it avoids the power and fre¬
quency allocation problems which blur
the global TV picture, and could start
functioning in the very near future.
There Is no question, however, that
global TV will arrive just as soon as
it is technically and economically pos¬
sible. So much has been written on
this subject that it is difficult to add
anything new to it, but the following
comments seem in order.
It is often said that the existence
of time zones will inhibit the develop¬
ment of instantaneous, planet-wide
communications. This precisely paral¬
lels the argument, heard at the begin¬
ning of this century, that motor cars
would only be of use inside the cities,
because, of course, there were no
roads elsewhere on which they could
operatel
When we have true global
communications, our way
of life will adapt to them not vice
versa. It would be frustrating to live
in a society where, at any given time,
between a third and a half of one's
acquaintances were asleep. This will
be the global situation, a quarter of a
century from now, and society will
have to make some Procrustean
adjustments. Current attacks on the
problem of sleep may give one answer;
perhapswe can condense our present
requirements, by electronic means, into
an hour or so a day. Or the long
range solution, unattractive though it
is, may lie in the wholly artifical world
where life goes on independently of
the sun, and all the clocks on the
planet keep the same time. As will
appear later, this solution would not
be only unpleasant, but unstable.
The existence of nationally operated,
direct-broadcasting TV satellites will
immediately focus attention upon two
problems which today are merely a
minor annoyance, but which tomorrow
will be intolerable. They are cen¬
sorship and jamming. For the advent
of communications satellites will mean
the end of the present barriers to the
free flow of information; no dicta-

torship can build a wall high enough
to stop its citizens listening to the
voices from the stars. It would be
extremely difficult, if not impossible,
to jam satellite broadcasts; any at¬
tempt by one country to do so would
result in an act of space piracy, or a
global telecommunications nuisance
which the rest of the world could not
permit.
One of the immediate objectives of
the ITU, therefore, should be a total
ban on jamming, and a recognition by
all nations that such behaviour is as
uncultured as interrupting other peo¬
ple's conversation by making rude
noises. And very much more dang¬
erous, since so many vital lifesaving
and navigation facilities now depend
upon radio links.
It seems that we have, in the com¬
munications satellite, a technical device
that may help to enforce good be¬
haviour and co-operation even upon
reluctant parties. (The meteorological
satellite, with which it is closely linked,
will do the same). Its influence will
be like that of air transport, though
on a much larger scale and affecting
whole nations rather than a relatively
few favoured individuals. The inexor¬
able force of astronomical facts will
destroy the political fantasies which
have so long fragmented our planet.
For when all major artistic productions,
entertainments, political and news
events can be viewed simultaneously
by the whole world, the parochialism
and xenophobia of the past will be
unable to survive.
his will be one major in¬
fluence of communications
satellites; another, perhaps even more
fundamental, may be the reversal of a
historic trend which has proceeded
with scarcely a break for five thousand
years. The traditional rôle of the city
as a meeting place is coming to end;
Megapolis may soon go the way of the
dinosaurs it now resembles in so many
respects. This century may see the
beginnings of a slow but irresistible
dispersion and decentralization of
mankind a physical dispersion which
will take place, paradoxically enough,
at the same time as a cultural unif¬
ication.
It will be none too soon, for it has
been truly said that the measure of
man's unhappiness is his estrange¬
ment from nature. There is ample
proof of this in the fact that the most
vicious of all savages are now to be
found in the rotting stone jungles of
our great cities. Civilization, in historic
fact as well as in etymology, was the
child of the city; but now it has
outgrown its parent and must escape
from its suffocating embrace.
It will be able to do so when almost
all the sense impressions, skills and
facilities that we employ in everyday
life become amenable to telecom¬
munications as they will. For as I
concluded in my address to the Xllth
International Astronautical Congress in
Washington, 1961:
What we are building now is the
nervous system of mankind... The
communications network, of which the
satellites will be nodal points, will
enable the consciousness of our grand¬
children to flicker like lightning back
and forth across the face of this
planet. They will be able to go any¬
where and meet anyone, at any time,
without stirring from their homes... all
the museums and libraries of the world
will be extensions of their living
rooms...
And it will not matter where those
living rooms may be; for on this planet
at least, the conquest of space will
be complete.
This article was prepared at the request
of Unesco to serve as background for a
Unesco report on space communications.
It was later presented by Arthur C. Clarke
at the Unesco meeting of experts on the
use of space communication by the mass
media in December 7965.

### 21218: Hurdles in space broadcasting

HURDLES IN SPACE
BROADCASTING
by Nicolai I. Tchistiakov
J ust nine years have elaps¬
ed since the launching of
Sputnik 1. In these few years, with
much intensive work, the foundations
for the use of satellites for communi¬
cation, and particularly for radio and
television, have been firmly laid.
Broadcasting was part of the earliest
probes into space. Conversations
with Yuri Gagarin during man's first
orbital flight were transmitted through
the broadcasting system of the
U.S.S.R. in April 1961. In August of
the same year the Soviet television au¬
dience had its first view of a cosmo¬
naut in space flight. By 1964 television
viewers were shown not only the
inside of the cabin, but also the view
of Earth from space. In 1965 they
watched cosmonaut Alexei Leonov take
the first walk in space.
With improvements in technology
came the satellites Telstar and Relay,
launched by the United States in 1962
and 1963, which made possible for the
first time short, experimental television
transmissions over very long distances.
In 1964, Syncom and Early Bird, in
synchronous orbit, realized television
transmission for long periods, includ¬
ing the broadcast of the Olympic
Games from Japan.
In April 1965, the Soviet satellite
Molniya 1 ("lightning") was launched
on an elliptical orbit with its apogee
in the northern hemisphere at a height
of 40,000 km (25,000 miles). The
period of orbiting is 12 hours, and
Molniya 1 makes one circuit over the
U.S.S.R. and a following one over
North America. A 40-watt active
relaying apparatus on board, with two
spares, made possible the first regular
television transmissions between the
western U.S.S.R. and its far eastern
lands for periods of from eight to
nine hours.
In October 1965, the launching of
Molniya II further increased the possi¬
bilities of television transmission
throughout the eastern part of the
U.S.S.R. On October 17, for instance,

NICOLAI I. TCHISTIAKOV is Professor of
Radio Techniques at the Institute of Tele¬
communications in Moscow. He took part
in the Unesco meeting on the use of space
communication by the mass media, in
December 1965.
Soviet television viewers on the Pacific
coast were able to see the Denmark-
U.S.S.R. football match being played
in Copenhagen.
In November 1965 the first success¬
ful experimental transmissions of col¬
our television from the U.S.S.R. to
France were carried out via Molniya I.
The successful experiments with
communication satellites by the U.S.A.
and the U.S.S.R. show that they have
an Important role to play in the devel¬
opment of broadcasting. Comparisons
are now possible between various
types of orbits. In the use of satellites,
the main emphasis is on the transmis¬
sion of television programmes.
Without using satellites, the long
distance transmission of radio broad¬
casts has not been difficult or expen¬
sive, and improvements in shortwave,
radio relay and cables offer continual¬
ly the possibility of further progress.
Sound broadcasts are recorded and
transmitted swiftly, and possibly will
be sent by supersonic rocket in the
near future.
Copying television programmes and
transmitting significant news events
present greater problems. This calls
for broad band channels such as
coaxial cables, wave guides, micro¬
wave relay lines and communications
satellites. We are aware of limitations
of the present stage of development.
Experience suggests two types of
communications satellites as best for
broadcasting systems: Satellites on
synchronous equatorial orbits (see
drawing page 29), such as Syncom 2,
and satellites on stretched inclined
elliptical orbits, providing long conti¬
nuous transmission periods, such as
Molniya 1. The problem now is to
improve the power sources, stability,
reliability and life of the equipment on
board the satellite. The launching by
the U.S.S.R. of a satellite equipped
with an electrical battery with radio¬
isotopes suggests one possible solu¬
tion.
These are some of the advantages
of the synchronous satellite :
no time limit for transmission,
a minimum number of satellites in
orbit for global communication,
comparatively simple construction
of ground antenna, driving servo-
mechanisms for the antenna and com¬
puter control devices,
remoteness of satellites from the
effects of belts of intensive cosmic
radiation,
M stability of received signals,
absence of distortion from Doppler
effect,
the "earth satellite" permits relative
localization of the radiated wave,
reducing interference between space
and ground equipment.
Among the advantages of the high
elliptical orbit are:
an orbit which provides optimum
receiving conditions for the ground
stations of a given country or territory,
use of the same satellite for pro¬
gramme exchange between territories
in the eastern and western hemisphere
with one-hop propagation,
high signal to noise reception in the
high latitudes where synchronous
satellites do not provide good recep¬
tion,
simpler and more economic launch¬
ing of satellites.
It is possible that, for global com¬
munication, a system combining both
types of satellites will prove most
satisfactory.
Direct broadcasting, which would
provide a direct signal from the satel¬
lite transmitter to the ordinary home
receiver, offers some apparent ad¬
vantages. But the shortcomings are
so numerous and important that It may
have limited scope. However, on the
positive side, it would not be neces¬
sary to load national and local broad¬
casting stations with transmissions
from satellites, and the listeners and
viewers would have a more varied
choice of international programmes.
But there is an impressive list of
obstacles to direct broadcasting. A
high power supply would be neces¬
sary on the satellite, of an order not
now technically available. Even if the
power were available, it might not be
practical to radiate it, since it would
create interference with services such
as fixed and mobile communication,
and radar, which share frequency
bands allocated for satellite commu¬
nication.

HURDLES IN SPACE (Continued)
Not all eggs in one satellite
32
The optimal bands for transmission
from satellites are centimetre waves,
but ordinary receivers cannot be
readily adapted to this band. The
installation of a complicated and
expensive receiving antenna by the
ordinary set owner for proper reception
from satellites is also not practical.
Direct broadcasting faces further dif¬
ficulties. With synchronous satellites
of the "stationary" variety, the recep¬
tion becomes worse at the boundaries
of the region served, mainly in the
high latitudes. Signals from the satel¬
lite cannot be kept out of countries for
which they are not intended. Transmis¬
sions cannot be shifted to more con¬
venient times for the populations of
given territories. The sound on a tele¬
vision transmission cannot be proces¬
sed or changed if translation into the
language of a given country or territory
is desired. In areas where the tele¬
vision standards differ from those of
the transmission, reception would be
impossible.
Much further study of direct broad¬
casting will be required, in the event
that countries reach agreements for
its use.
Broadcasting with retranslation is
the system in which television and
sound broadcasts are received from
the satellite by the national ground
station and then retransmitted to the
individual home receiver via national
broadcasting stations. The advantages
of this system are numerous. Pro¬
grammes can be received on portable
transistor radio and television receiv¬
ers. Optimal frequencies in the "sat¬
ellite-Earth" channel can be used,
Independent of the bands of ordinary
receivers.
For television, standards can be co¬
ordinated with the standards in each
country. The schedule for international
broadcasts can be co-ordinated with
national broadcast schedules and for
the convenience of the people. Pro¬
grammes can be recorded or taped at
the receiving stations for broadcast at
a more convenient time. Stable types
of modulation and of signal processing
can be used in the "Earth-satellite-
Earth" channel for noise resisting
reception and for narrowing of the
occupied frequency band.
For broadcasting by retranslation by
synchronous satellite, the ground sta¬
tion can be located at a comparatively
low latitude where, for the given
country, optimal reception conditions
exist. In the use of satellites with
elongated elliptical orbits, it is pos¬
sible to switch from one satellite to
another without programme interrup¬
tion. Also, it is possible to reduce
interference from satellite radiation to
ground services by decreasing the
power of the transmitter aboard the
satellite, by using sharply directional
receiving antennae, or low noise am¬
plifiers. The power plant aboard the
transmitter can be lighter and more
compact, with a corresponding in¬
crease in reliability, in power conser¬
vation, and in the life of the satellite.
For the new art of international
broadcasting, each country should
first develop its national radio and
television broadcasting system. Only
then can it adapt its national network
for the reception of international pro¬
grammes. Broadcasting by retransla¬
tion best fits this principle.
There is no reason to believe that
satellites will in the future be the prin¬
cipal means for the international ex¬
change of programmes. Other means
such as cables and micro-wave are
available and are being developed
further. Micro-wave links from con¬
tinent to continent could join together
the various national communication
networks to provide global networks
of large capacity.
here are certain services
which require the open
propagation of radio waves. The lo¬
calization of radiation on the surface
or in space is impossible, in some
cases, or could create great difficul¬
ties. This is true of terrestial radio¬
location and navigational systems,
meteorological, geophysical and navi¬
gational satellites, communication sys¬
tems for the flight safety of cosmo¬
nauts, planet radiolocation, radio-
astronomy and communication with
observatories in open space, and the
important mobile communication ser¬
vice on the ground, in the air and on
oceans .
Development and improvement of
mobile communication systems are
important now and must go on in the
future. Today there are systems for
control of maritime, air, and other
transport, and communications services
for the passengers. More individual
services will be required in the future.
Satellites especially launched for
the purpose may have a great role
in mobile maritime communication ser¬
vice.
And so we see that satellites in
point-to-point communication systems
may solve the problem of a global
communication network. However,
they do not give us the only solution,
nor the most realistic one.
Satellite communication systems
must be designed with limitations on
their range and the duration of their
use, with relation to the availability of
other systems, and to economic ad¬
vantage. This is my personal opinion,
but I firmly believe that only by adher¬
ing to the principle can we exclude
the crisis in the use of frequencies
which arose in the high frequency
(short wave) band.
This point of view must also be
considered in planning the develop¬
ment of broadcasting. The satellite
communication channels should be
used only when actually necessary;
there must be economy of frequency
channels.
Immediate transmission is necessary
only for actual important events, and
that does not take much time nor
many channels on a global scale.
There is usually a delay in transmis¬
sions of the principal parts of many
broadcasting programmes, and the
delay is often desirable because
of zonal time differences. The
processing of broadcast programmes
for language differences requires a
delay. The transcription of program¬
mes may serve satisfactorily, as in
the case of the 1964 Olympic Games,
when television programmes were
transported to Europe from the U.S.A.
after being received from Tokyo
through the satellite Synchron III and
recorded on magnetic tape. They
could have been transported directly
from Tokyo to European central tele¬
vision stations.
However, such considerations do
not mean that satellite communication
channels will not play a great role in
the transmission of broadcasting pro-
grammes. Television programme
transmission by satellite may be very
useful for areas where the ground
nets of multi-channel communication
are not adequate, and for towns situat¬
ed far from other towns across under¬
populated and inaccessible territories.
A global system combining the use
of all modern means and methods
must be designed, providing for ap¬
proximate scheduling of the use of
satellite channels, and it must secure
for all parts of the world and all coun¬
tries an equal right of participation.
However, that enterprise would have
to be preceded by a broad interna¬
tional exchange of television broad¬
casting programmes via communica¬
tions satellites.
In a global exchange, there must
be an equal flow between developed
and developing countries. Each coun¬
try possesses invaluable treasures of
national culture.
Since October 5, 1957, when the
man-made Earth satellite became a
reality, it has been clear that all tech¬
nical difficulties in this field may be
overcome. But the regulation of major
legal problems always goes slowly.
Global broadcasting through commu¬
nications satellites must be regulated
by an international convention, based
on the relevant decisions of the United
Nations General Assembly.

Letters to the Editor
STRATOSPHERONAUTS 7
Sir,
The press in general, including the
Unesco Courier (Man in Space, May
1966) describes the score or so per¬
sons who have risen to a height of
some 400 kms (250 miles) above the
earth as "cosmonauts" (or astronauts).
In my view this is an exaggeration
or at least a premature use of these
terms.
An altitude of 400 kms (approxim¬
ately the length of Switzerland between
its farthest frontiers) is still quite
close to our planet; it is certainly not
the cosmos. If we picture our globe
as a circle 10 cm. (4 in.) in diameter,
then in proportion our pseudo cos¬
monauts have risen a mere 4 mm.
(1/6 in.). At that altitude they are
still well within the earth's gravitational
field which is why they have to orbit
the globe at such colossal speeds.
It would be more appropriate and
more accurate to use the term "strato-
spheronaut" and to keep the name
"cosmonaut" for those who will
actually reach the cosmos one day.
F.E. Ducommun
Geneva, Switzerland
permit such a record. Especially is it
a golden opportunity for the judicious
historian to render justice to the
worthy, and by the fullness of his
narrative to rescue them from threaten¬
ed oblivion, even as he unflinchingly
records the depths of human degrada¬
tion."
Edwin G. Pulleyblank of Cambridge
(in Historians of China and Japan,
1961, p. 136) writing of Chinese his¬
torical criticism, has this to say:
"The first actual treatise on the
writing of history in Chinese (or, as
far as I can discover, in any language)
was the Shih-t'ung (Generalities on
History) of Liu Chih-chi (A.D. 661-721)
. . . completed in 710."
One might add similar comments
by other objective scholars. Fortun¬
ately, as the writings of the Chinese
become better known through transla¬
tion, people unacquainted with the
original may themselves judge the
worth and standards of these his¬
torians.

WHY NOT USE SEA WATER 7
Sir,
With many regions facing water
shortages, available supplies of fresh
water must be used economically.
While scientists are searching for
the best way to desalt sea
water (probably with chemical
substances) there are many ways of
using sea water as a substitute for
fresh. Swimming pools which take
enormous amounts of fresh water to
which salt is often addedcould be
filled with sea water. And what
about industry? Iron and steel plants
absorb vast quantities of fresh water
to which sodium chloride is often
added. In its manufacturing processes
the plastics industry uses hundreds
of millions of litres of fresh water
and almost as much salt. Why
waste so much drinking water on
other needs when to use sea water
would be both an economy and a
simple solution. Its distribution would
cost no more than the present
collection and supply of fresh water.
I should like to add my compliments
to the many you have already receiv¬
ed for your remarkable issue on "Wa¬
ter and Life" (July-August, 1964).
THE FIRST HISTORIANS
GHOSTLY POLYGONS IN SPACE
Sir.
E. Thumelaire
Brussels, Belgium
Sir,
I am one of your genuine admirers,
and enjoy each issue as it comes
along, largely because it takes the
whole world as its oyster. Once in a
while, however, when it falls short of
this ideal, I am critical. The June 1966
issue is one which provokes the
comment below.
Miss Barbara Bray, in an interesting
article on Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406).
calls him "the first man to treat history
as the proper object of a special
science." But is this so? The Chin¬
ese for a millennium and a half
before his time regarded the writing
of history as a special province, and
these historians conceived it their duty
to dilate on the whole story of man's
past.
Charles Sidney Gardner of Harvard
(in Chinese Traditional Historiography,
1938, p. 16) writes thus about Ssu-ma
Ch'ien (B.C. 100):
"History ¡s to him no mere genealog¬
ical record, no bald archival chronicle
of a single court, no treatise on
political morality. Nor is it dedicated
to the glory of any individual or
institution. Rather it is a composite
portrayal of the whole past of his
people, so far as accessible documents
I would like to suggest a different
explanation for the "ghostly polygons
of light" that featured on the front
page photograph of the May 1966 issue
of the Unesco Courier, as taken from
the Soviet spacecraft Voskhod I, and
that were ascribed to "rays of sunlight
reflected on the spacecraft window."
I have recently had a similar expe¬
rience with photographs that were
not taken through a window.
I happened to take some photo¬
graphs at a small angle toward the
sun, though the sun never actually
appeared in the photos, and in some
of these there are one or two penta¬
gons (never more).
Since the shape of the polygons
resembles the aperture in the camera's
diaphragm, I assume that the cause
of this phenomenon is due to the
sun rays passing through the aperture
at a certain angle, hitting the inner
lens and reflected (totally or partially)
back outside, then once again reflected
to the film from one of the outer
lenses (size and brightness thus
defined).
The camera I used was a Contaflex-
prlma. My explanation is just an
assumption.

MAGIC WORLD OF PUPPETS
Sir.
May I say how much my family and
I enjoy your magazine, especially the
recent articles on art. The standard
of the colour photography In the
December 1965 issue was excellent.
I lent several copies of the Courier
to friends hoping that they would
become subscribers. Unfortunately
their home was one of many destroyed
by bushfires last year and the copies
of the magazine were destroyed along
with the rest of their belongings. I
list the copies that were lost and I
wish to know if I can replace them.
Many years ago the Courier devoted
an issue to puppetry (Puppets: Magic
World In Miniature, No 3-4. 1955).
Would it be possible to produce
another Issue on this subject? I feel
that the increase in subscribers over
the years means that many will not
have had the pleasure of seeing this
or a similar issue.
