LAST FRONTIERS
OF CIVILIZATION
This Indian of the Amazonian jungle is imitating
the cry of a she-monkey in order to trap the male.
In many parts of the world there are millions of
people still living on the frontiers of civilization.
What should be done with them ? Should we
leave them alone, try to assimilate them, or
protect them and yet help to preserve their
traditional ways I (Photo Dominique Darbois.)
Civilization today is literally dropping out of the sky on
"primitive peoples" (we use this term for want of a better
one). With the aeroplane we have now succeeded in
breaching the last 'frontiers which once completely protected
aboriginal ways of life.
Up until not so long ago, though, most contacts between our
civilization and primitives meant long-drawn-out journeys and
were rarely accomplished except by slow progressive stages.
In 1880, Karl von den Steinen required months of tedious
river navigation to reach the tribes of central Brazil. When
he did reach them, his discovery was one of the outstanding
events in the world of science at the end of the 19th century.
Ever since 1948, these same tribes can be reached within six
hours by an airliner leaving downtown Rio de Janeiro and
landing at the very threshold of their villages. The first pilots
who met these Indians brought home stone axes as souvenirs;
today, they fly in illustrated magazines whose circulation seems
to have soared among the tribesmen.
This sudden and abrupt contact of the modern world with
the frail native cultures is, as a matter of fact, the last act of a
drama which has been staged in different settings since the end
of the Middle Ages. Until now, nearly every scene has been a
cruel one; it is up to us to brighten the final curtain.
The meeting of the white man and the primitive has always
followed the same script. It can be summed up in a few lines.
First, the romantic idyll of discovery with enchantment and
tenderness on one side -and, on the other, surprise and curiosity.
Then, still under the charm of this first encounter, the primi¬
tive becomes an enthusiastic fan for all the novelties spread
before him.
But the first disillusions follow as the pioneer begins to
exploit land and the people who had lived on it before him.
The decline of the native way of life coincides with a steep
drop in population, for new diseases are among the "novelties"
of civilization.
Often, just when native traditions are on the verge of disap¬
pearing, there is a last wave of revolt. Prophets or messiahs
spring up and preach a return to the past or the building of
another culture harmonizing old and new for better or worse.
These attempts to turn back thé clock are usually doomed to
failure. They usher in the final annihilation of a culture or
resignation to an inevitable fate.
Up until the end of the last century the crushing of primitive
peoples in the path of our civilization was accepted as a natural
state of affairs. Darwinism served as a legitimate excuse for
the extermination of weak, backward tribes. After all, didn't
this prove the law of the survival of the fittest ?
Frankly, there was no need of scientific theories to put con¬
sciences at ease. From the earliest days of European expansion,
primitives all too often were placed in the same category as
wild animals to be destroyed as if they were vermin or dange¬
rous beasts.
Poorly armed and incapable of putting up a fight, these
hapless victims of "civilization" rarely found defenders except
among the ranks of missionaries sent out to save their souls
and transform their cultures. Unfortunately, the loss of a
culture can be as fatal as an epidemic. The Polynesians lost
their will to live in the 19th century and as a result their islands
were soon sharply depopulated all because of the mass
despair of a people confronted with the collapse of its values.
During the last 50 years, anthropologists and psychologists
have done an excellent job of analyzing these contacts between
different civilizations or cultural groups. The question is: will
we take advantage of their work?
Although the rapid expansion of our modern industrial civili-

(continued)
zation is a potential deadly danger for
primitive peoples, the errors of the past
are now known. Several governments
have awakened to their responsibilities
and are now endeavouring to spare
their indigenous populations the hard
lot of other peoples in the same situa¬
tion in the past.
A good many scientists and philan¬
thropists sincerely believe that pri¬
mitives should be placed in a sort of
quarantine so that they may be
sheltered from the evils which our
civilization seems to insist upon bring¬
ing them. However, the idea of a
"national park for human beings"
does not seem feasible.
Whether we like it or not, there is not
a single tribe on the face of the earth
today which can hope to escape from
the effects of our civilization. True,
this contact is harmful, but it is the
primitives themselves who demand the
tools and the knowledge which they
believe can make life easier for them.
New diseases threaten their health
and only our science can save them.
The problem consists in finding an
intelligent way of integrating them
into modern life without destroying
what is valuable in their way of life
and, above all, without destroying their
self-respect. Of course, there are
some who will ask what is the use of
saving people who seem to belong in
the dark ages of early man.
The answer is that these primitives
number in the millions and that hu¬
manity cannot condemn them to death
and degradation. Our indifference
would not only be a crime, but a fool¬
ish policy as well. These men are
now being called upon to play an im¬
portant role in harnessing the resour¬
ces of their virgin lands. The trans¬
ition will be a difficult one, but it can
be carried off if it is tackled with
intelligence and with a deep sense of
the innate dignity of man.
What is the nature of Unesco's role
in the face of. the responsibilities
towards primitive peoples which the
civilized world must assume? Firstly,
it can ease the process of passing from
one type of life to another, a transition
apparently inevitable. Unesco's long
experience in fundamental education
can prove invaluable in this respect.
And, secondly, these "savages" have
the right to preserve their artistic tra¬
ditions, for the loss of these traditions
would be a loss for all of mankind.
Unesco is not blind to this danger.
It has already begun to participate in
the long task of salvage being under¬
taken by many scientists, all too aware
that this is our last chance.

CIVILIZATION LITERALLY drops out of the blue these days onto the heads of "primitive" peoples-
as illustrated by this photograph of an airfield at Tapini in New Guinea, a country entering the air age
without ever having passed through the stage of roads and railroads (airplanes are the only practical
way of reaching its interior). Last year, an aerial map-making crew discovered a "lost valley" on New
Guinea where some I 00,000 aborigines whose existence was previously unknown are believed to live.
An expedition is scheduled to explore the region, hemmed in by rugged peaks, later this year.

"PRIMITIVE", a bad enough word in itself, does not mean "inferior". These Kanakas (upper photos)
in the New Hebrides cope perfectly well with life on Pentecost Islandeven if they rub two sticks to¬
gether to light their fires and make their own axes from stone. The Australian aborigines have also
found a way of life well-adapted to their own environment. Science has turned the corner after first
regarding "primitive" peoples as unfit for survival it now recognizes that indiscriminate "improve¬
ment" can be disastrous for them if it destroys their traditional values.

### 69983: What is a 'primitive'?
WHAT IS A 'PRIMITIVE'?
Tribal dance of the Bapendé in the heart of the Congo. (Photo D.F.F.)
by Claude Levi-Strauss ,
here .was a time when if you spoke about
savages everyone had a fairly clear idea what
you were talking about. Etymologically, the
savage was a man of the forest, and the term
denoted those people who lived in close
contact with nature. The German word naturvölker (nature
folk) conveyed this idea directly.
But apart from the fact that all savages do not necessarily
live in forests (think of the Eskimos), the word soon took on
a figurative meaning which quickly became derogatory.
Then too, the idea of living in close contact with nature was
also confusing. Peasants live much closer to nature than city
dwellers yet both belong to the same civilization
Scientists came to realize that you couldn't classify the
people of the world according to how close or how far
removed they were from nature. In fact what distinguishes
mankind from the animals is that man, with his universal
use of language, his fabricated implements and tools, and
his submission to customs, creeds and institutions, belongs
to a higher order than any living thing in nature. The
world of man is a world of culture that is rigorously and
unequivocably opposed to nature whatever the level of civi¬
lization. Every human being talks, makes implements and
behaves according to set rules whether he lives in a skyscra¬
per or in a thatched hut in the middle of the forest. And
it is this that makes him a human being, not the particuliar
materials he builds his house out of.
Prof. Claude LEVI-STRAUSS knows the life of "primitive" civilizations at first¬
hand, haying lived among the Indians of Brazil's Amazon basin. During his long
career he has taught at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, the Institute of
Ethnology in Paris and served as Assistant Director of the Musée de l'Homme in Paris.
At present, he is Research Director in the Section of Religious Sciences at the Ecole
Pratique des Hautes Etudes and Secretary-General of the International Social Science
Council in Paris.
Modern anthropology prefers therefore to use the word
primitive to designate the people who used to be called
savage. There are an enormous number of primitive socie¬
ties several thousand according to a recent estimate. But
trouble starts when an effort is made to describe the charac¬
teristics of such societies.
First of all, we can discount the factor of numbers, that is
the size of the society. Of course, size does have meaning
from the global point of view, for societies comprising several
million members appear only rarely in the history of man¬
kind and are found only in a few great civilizations. More¬
over, these civilizations appeared at different historical epochs
and in regions as far apart as the East and Far East,
Europe, Central and South America. Yet these are differ¬
ences so great that the factor of numbers or size can have
no absolute value. Some African kingdoms included several
hundred thousand persons and oceanic tribes had several
thousand members but in the same regions of the world we
find societies made up of a few hundred persons or even at
times of only a few dozen.
In addition, such peoples (for instance, the Eskimos and
some Australian tribes) are often organized in an extraordi¬
narily flexible way : a group is able to expand on festive
occasions or during certain periods of the year, so as to
include several thousand persons, while at other seasons it
splits up into small self-sufficient bands of a few families, or
even of single families. Obviously if a society consisting
of 40 members and another of 40,000 can both be called
primitive for the same reasons, the numerical factor alone
doesn't provide an explanation.
We may perhaps be on firmer ground if we consider an¬
other feature, undeniably present in every culture we call
primitive: each of them is, or was at least until very
recently, outside the range of industrial civilization. But

PEOPLES WITH A FORGOTTEN PAST

here again, the yardstick won't work.
Consider the case of Western Europe.
It has often been stated, and rightly,
that the way of life of Western Euro¬
peans scarcely changed from the be¬
ginning of historic times until the
invention of the steam-engine ; there
was no fundamental difference be¬
tween the life of a patrician in Impe¬
rial Rome and that of a well-to-
do Frenchman, Englishman or Dutch¬
man of the 18th century.
Moreover, neither Rome in the
second century B.C. nor Amsterdam
about 1750 is comparable with a Mela-
nesian village of today, or with Tim-
b u k t u in the middle of the 19th
century. Civilizations which preceded
the birth of our industrial civilization
shouldn't be confused with those which
existed outside it, and would probably
have remained outside for a very long
time if industrialization had not been
imposed upon them.
The fact is that when we speak of
primitive peoples, we have the factor
of history (or time) in mind. The very
word primitive implies the idea of a
beginning. Then, can we say that pri¬
mitive peoples are those which have
retained or preserved to the present
day a way of life that goes back to the
beginnings of human society ? This is
an attractive hypothesis and it is valid
within certain limits. But it is also
liable to cause serious confusion.
First, we know absolutely nothing
about mankind's actual beginnings.
The earliest traces we have discovered
arms and implements in chipped
stone some thousands of centuries old
are certainly not the very first pro¬
ducts of the human brain. They
already reveal complicated technical
skills which must have developed little
by little. And above all, these tech¬
niques are found to be the same over
vast stretches of the earth's surface,
implying therefore that they had time
to spread, to influence one another,
and to become homogeneous.
A simple matter
of relativity
IN the second place, the peoples
whom we call primitive are all or
nearly all familiar with at least
some of the arts and techniques that
appeared extremely late in the devel¬
opment of civilization. Although the
oldest chipped stone implements may
date from 400,000 or 500,000 years ago,
agriculture, stock-raising, weaving and
pottery appeared only about ten thous¬
and years ago, perhaps less. Thus the
"primitiveness" of peoples who culti¬
vate gardens, breed pigs, weave loin¬
cloths and make cooking-pots is quite
relative in the time span of the total
duration of human history.
But we can ask another question :
after all, don't at least some of
these peoples continue to follow a
way' of life much older than ours,
much more like that of man in the
earliest ages? At once, some examples
come to mind: the aborigines of Aus¬
tralia or of South America. They lead
a nomadic life in semi-arid regions,
live by hunting, and by picking and
gathering from the earth what food
they can. They are ignorant of weav¬
ing or pottery, and until quite re¬
cently used stone implements. The
natives of Australia had no knowledge
even of the bow and arrow, while those
of Tierra del Fuego had only a very ru¬
dimentary type.
Nevertheless, the progress of ethno¬
logical knowledge provides the expla¬
nation. It has shown that in these
cases and in all the others that could

be mentioned, the apparently primi¬
tive state is not the result of any mira¬
culous preservation of an ancient mode
of life, it is the effect of regression.
The Australians can only have reached
their continent by boat, so they must
at some time have known the art of
navigation, and since forgotten it.
Men who know nothing
of writing
A CHANGE of environment to an
area which lacks good quality
clay often explains the disap¬
pearance of pottery, sometimes even
from human memory. Language
often proves that peoples whose
low level of civilization might sug¬
gest their immobilization and isola¬
tion in the same place from the most
distant times, have in fact been in
contact for thousands of years with all
kinds of much more highly developed
populations. Far from these alleged
primitives having no history, it is their
history, that explains the very special
conditions in which they have been
found.
For it would be absurd to think that,
because we know nothing or almost
nothing of their past, primitive peoples
have no history. Their remotest an¬
cestors appeared on the earth at the
same time as our own. For tens and
even hundreds of thousands of years
other societies preceded theirs and
throughout that time lived, endured
and therefore changed as ours did.
They knew wars, migrations, periods of
want and prosperity. They had great
men who left their stamp on technical
knowledge, on art, morals and religion.
All this past exists; only they know'
little about it and we know nothing.
The latent presence and pressure of
a past that has disappeared are enough
to show the falsity of the word primi¬
tive, and even of the idea of a primi¬
tive people. But at the same time we
must take note of a feature which all
societies we call primitive have in com¬
mon and which distinguishes them
from ours. It is the reason for ap¬
plying to them all the same term,
however inappropriate it may be.
All these societies from the power¬
ful empire of the Incas, which suc¬
ceeded in organizing several million
men into a politico-economic system of
exceptional efficiency, down to the
small nomadic bands of plant-gather¬
ers in Australia are comparable in
at least one respect: they knew or still
know nothing of writing.
They could preserve nothing of their
past save what human memory, was
able to retain. This remains true, even
for the small number who have, for
lack of writing, developed some system
of mnemonics (such -as the Peruvian
knotted strings or the graphic symbols
of Easter Island and of certain African
tribes). Although these societies are
not, strictly speaking, more "primitive"
than ours, their past is of a different
kind. It could not be a past preserved
in writing and thus available at any
moment to be used for present advan¬
tage.
It was a fluid past which could be
preserved only in small quantities, and
the remainder, as it came into exis¬
tence, was condemned to be forgotten
with no hope of recovery. To borrow
a simile from the language of naviga¬
tion, societies with some form of
writing have a means of logging their
course and therefore of keeping on the
same track for a long period.
On the other hand, societies without
some form of writing are reduced to
following an unsteady course which
may in the end (although the distance
covered is the same in both cases)
bring them back very near to their
starting point. Or at least it deprived
them of the means of systematically
drawing away from it, that is to say,
of making progress.
Danger of ambiguous
expressions
THEREFORE I cannot too strongly
warn that readers and even
scientists themselves should
beware of ambiguous terms like savage,
primitive, or archaic. By taking the
presence or absence of some form of
writing as the sole criterion in our
study of societies, we shall, in the first
place, be invoking an objective quality
which implies no philosophic or moral
postulate. And at the same time we
shall be relying on the only feature
capable of explaining the real diffe¬
rence that distinguishes certain socie¬
ties from our own.
The idea of a primitive society is a
delusion. ' On the other hand the idea
of a society with no form of writing
makes us aware of an essential side of
mankind's development; it explains
the history, and enables us to foresee
and perhaps influence the future of
these peoples.

Brazil is a country
where primitive Indian
tribes still live next to
huge modern metropolises.
Brazil is a country of vio¬
lent contrasts, contrasts
arising both from her enor¬
mous area and the uneven
rate at which regions with¬
in this area have been pro¬
gressively developed.
The Brazilians them¬
selves say that, when you
travel in the direction of
the setting sun in their
country, you journey backwards
through time. Sooner or later, you are
bound to meet forgotten centuries.
Even today, the Brazil of the prairies
and unexplored jungles is only begin¬
ning to be integrated into the life of
the nation. This Brazil is an ever-
moving frontier and it marks the pro¬
gress which has been made by Brazi¬
lian society in what amounts to the
conquest of its own territory.
This is a borderland where Indians
and the forces of civilization face each
other under much the same conditions
as those of the first meeting of Europe
and America. At times, the clash is
even more violent than it was in the
past for it has now been heightened
by centuries of bloody conflict.
The Indian who sees an outsider
move onto the territory of his tribe is
convinced that there is no hope of any
agreement. From tradition and per¬
sonal experience he has learned that
he can expect nothing but the worst...
	 by 	
Darcy Ribeiro
and that he has no other course but to
defend his rights.
The pioneer, opening up new grazing
lands or jungle areas, looks upon this
soil as his own. He resents the Indian
and he is suspicious of him. The atti¬
tudes of both sides being what they
are, it is no great wonder that a fight
is inevitable.
Up to the beginning of the 20th cen¬
tury, Indians who dared to resist an
invasion of their territory were hunted
down like wild beasts. Vast regions
only a few days' journey by horseback
from big cities such as Sao Paulo, Vito¬
ria, Ilheus or Blumenau lay untouched
because they were battlegrounds for
whites and Indians.
Entire tribes were wiped out.' Gangs
of professional killers hired themselves
out to local governments or colonization
companies to massacre Indians and
make room for European settlers.
The fate of the Indians who lived
peacefully in contact with white civili¬
zation was no less tragic. They were
treated mercilessly and frequently they,
were thrown off their land if it proved
to be of any value. When they could
be used in any way as a source of lab¬
our, they were ruthlessly exploited,
often reduced to slavery and stripped
of their most elementary rights. Their
women and children were playthings
of village tyrants.
But as the advancing frontier pushed

For many years he has had close contact with
Indians of the Brazilian ¡ungle and is the author of

THE SOLDIER WHO

DIE IF YOU MUST BUT NEVER KILL AN INDIAN'
the Indian further and further away
from Brazil's large towns, a new atti¬
tude took form in the minds of the
distant city-dwellers. The Indian be¬
came a romantic figure, resembling one
of Rousseau's "good savages" and a
flood of poems and novels began -to
sing his praise.
This, of course, did not stop the fron¬
tier settlers from painting him as black
as possible so that the great Indian
hunt could go on with some sort of
justification.
The beginning of the 20th Century
saw an increase in world demand for
rubber and other tropical jungle pro¬
ducts. This led to the invasion of the
last of the land where the Indian re¬
mained unmolested. New conflicts
between whites and Indians sprang up
and new massacres followed. But, this
time, an aroused public opinion
brought pressure to bear on the govern¬
ment to put an end to the slaughter.
It is against this background of vio¬
lence and murder that the figure of a
young soldier first appeared. - Soon,
the eyes of the entire country were to
be on him.
This officer, assigned to build a tele¬
graph line linking the Brazilian coast
with the country's western border, had
adopted a new policy towards the In¬
dians. He wanted to demonstrate that
it was possible to pacify even the most
hostile tribes merely by persuasion.
His troops had to push' through
regions ' occupied by the most feared
Indians of the interior, regions where
no white man had ever dared venture.
They did go through, systematically
winning the Indians' confidence and
with never an act of violence.
The man behind this miracle was
Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon. He
had been a professor of mathematics
and astronomy at Brazil's military col¬
lege until the day, a few years pre¬
viously, when he decided to find a
humanitarian way of using the troops
under his command.
Rondón was a "positivist" for the
driving force behind this epic of the
Brazilian jungle was the philosophy of
the French thinker, Auguste Comte.
Putting positivism into practice meant
leading an armed expedition through
territory occupied by hostile tribes
without ever authorizing the use of
arms, even under attack... and all of
this in the name of an abstract prin¬
ciple of justice.
Rondón became the head of a com-

house varies according to the region and the state of tribal development.

BRAZIL'S INDIANS (Cont'd.;
SCANTY CLOTHING worn by dwellers In the heat and
humidity of tropical forests is compensated by a profusion of bodily
decoration. Beads and rings are worn and body tattooing and
painting are widespread. Feather decorations include crowns,
frontlets, collars and cloaks. Feather headdress held by this young
girl is also decorated with beetles wings.
BASIC FURNITURE in the forest Indian's hut is the hammock
whose suitability for sleeping in the tropics led Europeans to adopt
it after their first contacts with the Indians, and a low stool or bench
often carved in the shape of an animal. Woman in hammock is
spinning cotton while her husband makes basket-work fish trap.
Basketry is a masculine industry.
INDIAN KITCHEN is merely the centre of a roofed, but unen¬
closed hut. Here the manioc, purged of its poisonous prussic acid
and now a starchy whitish powder, is either baked on a clay grid
into thin flat cakes or stirred to produce small white crumbs,
"farinha" pellets, like those of white bread. Meat or fish which
would rapidly spoil in the humid climate are baked and smoke dried.
FOOD MAINSTAY of Brazilian Indians, as for all others in
tropical South America, is manioc, one of a variety of root crops
from which many dishes and drinks are prepared. In the cooking
pots shown here, for example, manioc is being fermented to produce
a strong drink genericàlly called chicha. Before being used for
cooking, the commonest kind, bitter manioc, is carefully processed
to remove the prussic acid it contains.
YOUNG HUNTERS have spotted an Ara, a macaw which
.though never eaten by Indians, is much prized for the plumes widely
used for making ceremonial headdresses. The blowgun and bow are
basic hunting weapons and several types of arrow heads are used
including barbed for larger game and blunt ones for stunning birds.
SUN OVEN is a hut roof on which the manioc cakes are spread.
Well-baked and dried these will keep for a long time. In addition
to root crops nearly all tribes grow maize and cultivate many other
plants for use as food, drugs or poisons. Certain plants when
crushed in streams give out a sap which drugs fish without affecting
their edible qualities in any way.

MOTIONLESS AS STATUES, TWO INDIANS PATIENTLY WAIT FOR THE FISH.
ORNAMENTAL DESIGNS of human, animal and linear figures
are used by Indians to decorate weapons, implements, vessels, clothes
and their bodies. Here, using a twig and a liquid called "genipa"
customarily employed for body painting, an Indian girl traces simple
rectangular designs on paper supplied by the photographer.
THIRSTY BOATMAN refreshes himself by letting water
run down his paddle into his mouth. He is tattooed (a form of
protection against malign influences) but like most Indians has
removed all hair from his body, from above the eyes and from
his lips and chin. Indians usually explain that they think hair is
"ugly", but there is generally some underlying superstition
to account for this custom.

mission which set out to apply Comte's
ideas to an army. Rondon's plan had
three basic points: the peaceful use of
troops to survey unknown regions, mili¬
tary construction of public works such
as telegraph lines and, finally, the
application of humanitarian principles
such as the protection of the Indians.
In the cruel history of relations bet¬
ween primitives and civilization, it
would be difficult to find a policy
bearing such a stamp of generosity.
Even the 16th century missionaries who
brought the Gospel to the Indians of
Brazil did not disdain to use the secular
arm. On more than one occasion, they
asked the aid of the army. But Ron-
don was the secular army personified.
He was at the head of a conquering
army, and he was able to make it an
instrument which combined both .wis¬
dom and understanding.
His troops marched under his motto:
"Die if you must, but never kill."
Twsnty years of life in the jungle
brought him into contact with many
tribes, a good deal of them pacified by
his men. These years gave Rondón
precious experience in the problem of
relations existing between Indians
and Brazilians.
Eventually, he succeeded in training
a team of men as conscious as he was
of the complexity and the importance
of Brazil's Indian problem. This
school produced the first of the Brazi¬
lian "Indianists", men who had learned
from Rondón that force should never
be used, even to stand off an attack.
Above all, they learned that the most
warlike of tribes might very well be
peace-loving and willing to fraternize
with white men once they had been
convinced that they were not dealing
12
with the usual sort of white men. In
other words, the Indians had to be
shown that civilization had a face
other than the one with which they
were all too familiar.
In 1910, when the Brazilian Govern¬
ment yielded to public opinion and
decided to create an organization to
protect the country's Indians, Rondón
was immediately hailed as the best man
to set it up. This was the birth of the
Serviço de Proteçao aos Indios, set up
to carry out a realistic demographic
- policy: the preservation of a popula¬
tion indispensable to Brazil because it
was already occupying vast areas of
the country. This organization was
also entrusted with bringing peace to
regions torn by Indian-white conflicts.
It was understood that the service
would be devoted exclusively to aiding
the Indians and would abstain from
any religious proselytizing. The law
setting up the service established the
principle that the Indians would be
respected as a people with the right to
be themselves, to preserve their beliefs
and to live as they wanted to live that
is, according to the traditions handed
down to them by their ancestors.
This service heralded a new era for
the Indians of Brazil. No longer were
all customs, beliefs and institutions to
be reduced to one all-inclusive stan¬
dard or cast into a foreign mould. The
new policy was based on what sociolo¬
gists term "cultural relativism". In
other words, there was a willingness to
admit that certain conceptions of the
supernatural and certain social customs
could fulfil a useful purpose within the
framework of a specific society.
Protection of Indians on their own
land was another major objective. The
service put an end to the old practice
of forcing Indians to abandon their

BRAZIL'S GENERAL RONDON -
THE SOLDIER WHO WOULDN'T SHOOT
homes and eke out a miserable exis¬
tence elsewhere. This method of "civi¬
lizing" Indians had been one of the
main causes of tribal disorganization.
Ripped loose from the surroundings
where he had been raised and where "
he had learned to fight for life, the
Indian could not meet his own needs
and he had been faced with a choice
of fleeing or submitting.
No longer would families be separat¬
ed under the pretext of education or
evangelization. Previously, the remo¬
val of children from the homes of their
parents had been the cause of specta¬
cular failures and bloody insurrections. .
Traditions shattered
THIS practice had been widespread
and justified by the hope of trans¬
forming new generations oftln-
dians. Unfortunately, it only resulted
in depriving Indians of an education
which would have enabled them to
learn how to meet their own conditions
of existence. It also shattered tribal
traditions essential to them for surviv¬
al as a society.
Considering the period of his work,
Rondón and the "positivist" policy of
his service represented a big step for¬
ward especially in view of the atti¬
tude of anthropologists and sociolo¬
gists of the time. They were mainly
interested in describing exotic customs
and had little concern for the future
of the people they were studying. The
Indian was a sort of human fossil enab¬
ling them to shed light on the past.
Rondon's Bureau of Indian Affairs
was established in Rio de Janeiro, with
branches Inspetorias throughout the
country and also a network of "Indian
outposts." Each of these outposts rep¬
resented a territory belonging to an
Indian tribe which was assisted by
government officials.
These officials were given the task of
organizing Indian economic life, pro¬
tecting the Indians from famine and,
in general, raising their standard of
living. In addition, government repre¬
sentatives were in charge of relations
between their Indian community and
the whites to prevent exploitation and
to punish crimes which had been com¬
mitted against the tribe.
If necessary, officials were empower¬
ed to intervene in quarrels among In¬
dians but only if the Indians had re¬
course to their authority after failing
to settle the disputes under their own
traditional system of justice.
106 outposts
FINALLY, Indians were given medi¬
cal aid, mainly to protect them
against diseases transmitted by
white men. In short, outpost officials
had the job of directing the entire
process of assimilation of the Indian
to avoid violent change which might
harm his traditional way of life.
Sudden change often proves to be
harmful when a primitive people can¬
not meet a new situation with its tra¬
ditional ways of life and when it has
not yet been convinced that there are
any valid reasons for changing the way
- of life it has always known.
- Today, thousands of Indians live
under the protection of 106 "outposts".
Many of them would not have survived
without Rondon's service assuring them
possession of their land and the right
to live according to their customs.
The service has always faced another
problem the pacification of hostile
tribes. It has devoted itself to this
task for forty years while Brazil has
pushed back her frontier. The men
who followed Rondón continued to use
only persuasion and several of them
paid with their lives for the faith they
showed in the motto : "Die if you must,
but never kill."
soap, metal tools, etc. and that he has
to work for wages to satisfy them.
What chance does he have to meet
these needs with the resources of his
basically rural economy an economy
precarious even for Europeans? It is
no wonder that the Indian often finds
that his status is inferior to that of
better equipped competitors who are
adapted to a complex civilization.
Uprooted, the Indian may lose every¬
thing even his will to live. He no
longer feels secure in a changed world
after having lived among men who
shared his viewpoint and his philoso¬
phy. Among Indians, the loss of tra-
HUNTING PARTY of Oyampi Indians who inhabit the frontier lands of Brazil and French Guiana,
returns to its village. In some tribes canoe hunters use a calabash to imitate the roar of the jaguar.
Attracted by the call, the jaguar swims out to the canoe where it can easily be stunned with a club.
This policy has proved profitable for
Brazil as well as for the Indians. Huge
regions have been settled peacefully
and integrated into the national eco¬
nomy. The service has no secret of
success other than the patience and
the spirit of sacrifice which Rondón
was able to awaken.
But what can be done with Indian
tribes once they have been pacified?
How can they be saved from the harm¬
ful influence of everyday contact with
their onetime traditional enemies?
The loss of part of their territory is
a hard economic blow to Indian tribes
dependent for survival upon hunting
or upon plants growing wild. To make
matters worse, they are killed off by
epidemics of influenza or measles and
the high mortality rate destroys their
social structure and shatters their tra¬
ditional system of maintaining order.
At the same time, the Indian finds
that he has new needs clothing, salt,
ditional values breeds demoralization
and, above all, loss of self-respect.
The activities of the Servigo have
posed many questions, some difficult to
answer. These problems are still await¬
ing solution, a solution requiring the
contribution of anthropologists interest-
ed in the future of so-called "primi¬
tive" peoples. General Rondón had
foreseen these new problems and, in
1942, he created a research section at¬
tached to the Servigo.
Millions of men in the present-day
world live under conditions little dif¬
ferent from those faced by the Indians
of Brazil. The example of Brazil is a
lesson: it teaches us that their fate
need not be tragic. But a profound
understanding of their problem and of
the situation which is confronting
them with the advance of modern civi¬
lization is essential.

This was also a male device to frighten the women into submission. Men appeared disguised as various
spirits, threatening women with punishment for disobedience. Believing that spirits took the form of natural phenomenathe heavens, clouds, thunder,
mountains, etc.the Onas used imitative masks. The one representing the heaven, Olemmg, was painted with red and white spots. His wife, falpen,
wore a completely white dress to imitate the colour of the clouds. The Onas believed that if one offended a mountain.it would send rain and winds.
IN 1880, the Ona Indians of Tierra
del Fuego at the southern tip of
South America were a hardy vi¬
gorous tribe numbering more than
4,000. Today, they can almost be
counted on -the fingers of two hands.
What happened in "the meantime?
There could be no more striking illus¬
tration of the tragic destiny of millions
' of "primitive" people than the fate of
the Ona Indians. The details of this
particularly sordid episode in the his¬
tory of white colonization have been
obtained from Dr. Martin Gusinde,
an Austrian-born anthropologist at the
Catholic University of America in
Washington, D.C., who knows more
about this tribe than perhaps anyone
in the world.
Hunters become
the hunted
AFTER several thousand years,
these Indians had become adapt¬
ed to the harsh physical environ¬
ment of Tierra del Fuego (its name
means Land of Fjre). Primarily hun¬
ters, they roamed the plains and moun
tains of their island tracking the gua¬
naco, an animal related to. the llama.
To the Onas, the guanaco was exactly
what the bison of the North American
prairies was to the Redskins. It pro¬
vided them with food, and with skins
for clothing and shelter, and bones and
sinews for weapons and tools.
The Onas' first contact with the white
man goes back to 1520, the year they
were discovered by Magellan as he
sailed through the straits which have
since borne his name. In succeeding
centuries, navigators who braved the
storms of Cape Horn landed on their
coasts, but only long enough to murder
some of the Indians or kidnap a few
unfortunates to be shown in Europe.
These incidents had little effect on
the state of the tnbe as a whole, and
the Fuegians might have survived to
our own day but for rumours, spread in
1880, that the island contained gold.
Adventurers began to roam over it and,
if they did not grow rich, they at least
had time to massacre the small bands
of Indians who crossed their path.
This first encounter with civilization,
though devastating, was only the pre¬
lude to a drama of mounting horror.
The bloody history of the Indians of
Tierra del Fuego began with the estab¬
lishment of sheepfarms in the last
years of the 19th century.
Not content with cutting up hunting
grounds by barbed wire enclosures,
sheep-raisers, running these enormous
farms, destroyed the guanacos and
other game on which the Ona Indians
depended for survival.
One pound for
a pair of ears
THE starved Indians began to
"hunt" the sheep, or "white
guanacos" as they called them,
and that enraged the colonists who put
a price on the Indian's heads, offer¬
ing one pound sterling for a pair of
ears the rate paid for killing a puma.
Hunting Indians became a profitable
business and people still talk of one
man who made £ 452 at it in one year.
In the interests of efficiency, the "hun¬
ters" organised big beats and their
human quarry sometimes started with
the aid of mastiffs was slaughtered
without pity.

### 69988: The Last of the Fuegians
The last of

(Continued)
The Indians, armed only with bows
and flint-tipped arrows, were in no
position to defend themselves. In des¬
peration, they took revenge on the
sheep.
At the beginning, the Onas killed the
sheep in order not to die of hunger; in
the end, they slaughtered them to vent
their hatred. They cut the barbed-
wire fences, stampeded the flocks, and
trained their dogs to bite sheep.
Disease, poison
and deportation
THIS absurd vendetta only exas¬
perated their persecutors and led
them to greater cruelty. More
than ever the Indians were treated as
dangerous animals, to be destroyed by
every possible means. "Hunts" became
more frequent and more cruel, new
horrors being added to old brutalities.
Dr. Gusinde recounts that chil¬
dren were captured,' purposely exposed
to contagious diseases, and returned to
their parents to spread -epidemics. A
new method of slaughter was employed
on a huge scale: mutton poisoned with
strychnine was distributed to the
starving.
This accumulation of horrors finally
aroused public opinion and authorities
decided to act, but the measures they
took proved cruel and deadly. The
Indians were torn from their land and
deported without any regard for their
living conditions. Most of them were
herded onto Dawson Island; others
were put into veritable concentration
camps behind barbed wire.
There is no need to describe what
happened to the deported Indians.
The women and children who were
lent or sold to colonists were probably
better off as slaves than their kin im¬
prisoned under military supervision.
Only a handful
now remain
WHEN Dr. Gusinde went to live
among them in 1919, the Fue¬
gians then numbering 279, had
taken refuge in the southern forests of
their island. They were trying more
or less successfully to live according to
their traditions and to avoid contacts
with the whites.
But just when there might have been
hope for their survival under the pro¬
tection of missionaries, they were deci¬
mated by influenza to such an extent
that only a handful now remain.
These "children of nature" had led a
happy and satisfying existence for
centuries in their solitude at the very
southern end of South America, Dr.
Gusinde writes. Generation had fol¬
lowed generation in a fruitful way of
life. Other generations might have
succeeded them without harming a
soul on the face of the earth.
Then, the anthropologist continues, a
handful of fortune-hunting Europeans
invaded their lands. In less than fifty
years, an ancient Indian tribe whose
past went back beyond the dawn of
history had been exterminated.

DEATH WAS ONCE
A TRIBAL GAME
Death was attributed by the Ona people
to a supreme being called Temaukel whose
will was executed through such causes as
old age, sickness, war etc., and the spells
of sorcerers. It was also the theme of
one of their ceremonial games in which
the leader, named Kotaix (left) painted his
body and wore a horned headdress. At
one stage in the game those taking part
had to lie down and feign death. In
wintry weather they first spread furs
on the ground (below). But the game they
were finally forced to play was far more

SPARTAN LIFE IN
A GOLD CLIMATE
Ritual circle is formed by men in front of the ceremonial hut, which only they can approach, to invoke the spirits
responsible for the weather. The severity of the climate on Tierra del Fuego over which chilly winds constantly roar
is proverbial. But the people acquired an amazing resistance to cold. Immediately after birth infants were plunged
into the sea or a stream and underwent similar treatment as they grew up. Only the most robust survived such a
Spartan childhood. Scanty clothing consisted of guanaco furs, and for shelter Onas built windbreaks of hides.

FEATHERS SPED THE
FEET OF RDNNERS
Games and sportswrestling, foot races, archery duelswere very popular pastimes among the Onas and all
helped to develop a physique capable of resisting the terrible weather on Tierra del Fuego. But superstitions
also found their way into sports. Before starting a foot race runners tied a bunch of feathers to the left arm,
being pursuaded that this would give them greater speed. It is, in fact, difficult to speak of games in the normal
sense in relation to peoples for whom almost everything has some link with -a superstition or religious rite.

The first Europeans who came into contact
with Tierra del Fuego Indians considered
them as being little better than animals.
Their language was reported to be rudi¬
mentary, but this Idea was completely
destroyed after the Rev. Ernest Bridges
went to live among them and later pub¬
lished a dictionary which, though in¬
complete, contained some 23,000 words.
Their reputation as "savages" was such that
visitors to the Paris Exhibition of 1889
were willing to pay to see a group of-
these "curious animals" who had been
forcibly taken from their Island homes.
PAINTING UP
FOR "KEWANIX

Ceremonial rites such as the initi¬
ation of young men were always
the occasion for Ona men to dress
themselves up. But there were
other ceremonies such as the
Kewanix at which women painted
their bodies with traditional designs.
Their strange customs did not
prevent the Onas from having a
developed sense of morality which
required them to live virtuously so
as to earn the goodwill of the gods.,
NEW STYLES FOR
EVERY OCCASION
Ona women generally paid little attention
to their hairstyles except for aslight parting
and a fringe over their foreheads. Painting
of the face was the only way of "making-
up". Here (from left to right) is the make¬
up for everyday use, for the marriage
ceremony and the special hairstyle for
mourning. Another mourning custom of
the Onas was to gash themselves with
pointed bones to show their sorrow.
Men's facial decorations varied in the same
way. Photos (from left to right) show an
everyday design, a typical old man's head
and the warrior's decorations. (All photos

THOUGH SPREAD OUT OVER AN IM-

tian Islands in the Pacific to Greenland, the
Eskimos have managed to preserve an' amazing
unity of language and culture. This photograph
of a woman carrying her child In Greenland could
well have been the inspiration for the statuette"
executed by an Eskimo artist in Canada. (Photo

MANY years ago, I excavated an
old Eskimo site in West Green¬
land. Human bones were scat¬
tered where the sleeping platform had
been and all sorts of implements
appeared during our- digging. Local
tradition told us that the inhabitants
had starved to death during a par¬
ticularly severe winter. Some years
later, when travelling with some
Eskimos over the Barren Grounds in
arctic Canada, we had ourselves to go
four days without food.
The Eskimos, living at the northern
boundary of the inhabited earth, have
always been in danger of extermina¬
tion. The failing of the hunt, a violent
epidemic, or a case of ptomaine poi¬
soning might lay a whole settlement
waste even in Greenland, where living
conditions are easier than in the arctic
regions of Canada.
It should be remembered that

In 1953 the native population

Farther north, in the Thule District,

is the author of many books on the subject. <
selling products which the Greenlanders
needed for their own use.
However, when Hans Egede,' a Nor¬
wegian Lutheran missionary, came to
Greenland in 1721 with the support of
the Danish Government, he introduced
a new era in the history of the Arctic.
His object from the beginning was to
revive the belief in the Gospel among
the descendants of the Norsemen who,
according to general belief, were still
to be found in the country. For good
reasons, this came to nothing ; instead,
he threw himself with zeal into the
conversion of the Eskimos.
It was the intention that the expen¬
ses involved in this work should be co¬
vered by trade, and in the course of
half a century, trading and mission
posts were spread over the west coast.
Much later, posts on the east coast and
at Thule were established.
At first, various private companies
attempted to carry on the trade, but
they suffered heavy losses. In 1774, it
was taken over by the Danish crown.
This made it a government monopoly,
and it was forbidden for others "to na¬
vigate to or trade with the said country
Greenland and adjacent islands, places,
and harbours."
Right from the beginning, the go¬
vernment trade had quite a special
character owing to the fact that, as
expressed in the important Instructions
of 1782, the leading principle was to be
the welfare -of the Greenlanders, and
assistance was to be rendered to them
in times of dearth. And it must be
acknowledged that, in- spite of inevit
able mistakes, thoughtful care has
always dictated the steps the adminis¬
tration has taken.
Gradually the old Eskimo culture was
transformed. Christianity and school
education were introduced and sanitary
conditions were improved. The leading
principle was, however, that sealing
should remain the key industry. As
hunting requires that the population be
scattered, a clash of these economic and
cultural efforts was, to some degree,
unavoidable. Still worse was the fact
that, iwith the breaking down of the
old cultural pattern, the aboriginal
Eskimo social ideas disappeared with¬
out being replaced by new ones.
A sort of general dejection was, in
fact, predominant within Greenland's
population when, at the suggestion of
the great friend and champion of the
Eskimos, Dr. H. Rink, the so-called
"managements" were set up in 1862-
1863. They were the first step towards
letting the Greenlanders settle their
own affairs and creating new social
ideals. The success of this reform can
be measured by the steady growth of a
community spirit amongst the Eskimos.
' About the beginning of this century
a new danger turned up. While the
population was steadily on the increase,
there was particularly since 1920 a
very considerable decline in the num¬
ber of seals upon which the whole
existence of the people was based.
The cause of this unfortunate condi¬
tion cannot be stated with certainty.
It is probably the result of a coinci¬
dence of factors,, among which the most
IN ADDITION TO THE 23,000 ESKIMOS in
Greenland, the world's largest island, some 22,000
more live in the Far North of the mainland. Among
these are the Caribou Eskimos (named after the animal
which serves as their staff of life) on the barren grounds
of Canada. (Photo, National Film Board of Canada.)

### 69989: The Eskimos: Denmark's formula for world's northern outpost
UNESCO COURIER N«" 8-9 1954
FROM CLASSROOM TO THE
COUNCIL ROOM. Illiteracy
has disappeared in Greenland where
schools have succeeded in training
young Eskimos to shoulder their
responsibilities as citizens. In 1953
Greenland shed' its status as a
colony and was incorporated into
the Kingdom of Denmark; it now
sends two representatives to the
Danish Parliament. These pictures
show an adult class in Greenland
and a provincial council meeting.
important are the amelioration of the
climate during the last decades, the
brutal butcheries ion the breeding
grounds by foreign sealers, and the
Greenlanders' increasing propensity
for using the rifle instead of the
traditional harpoon.
Whatever the reason may be, it be¬
came necessary to look for new resour¬
ces. Fortunately the improvement of
climate which contributed to the de¬
crease of the number of seals also
resulted in a steady northward spread
of cod, now found along most of the
west coast. Fisheries have" been de¬
veloped by the introduction of improv¬
ed gear and methods, and the appoint¬
ment of Danish fishermen as tutors to
the Greenlanders. There are at pre¬
sent 79 government stations for
buying, salting and drying cod for the
export trade.
A new jobsheep farming
WHILE fisheries are a further de¬
velopment on old Eskimo lines,
animal husbandry and farming
involve a breach with all Eskimo tra¬
ditions. A sheep farming experiment
was started on the initiative of the
government as early as 1906, and there
are now about 19,000 sheep in Green¬
land. Experts claim that their num¬
ber may be increased fourfold.
However, the sheep industry must"
always, for natural reasons, be limited
to the southernmost parts of the
country and hence an attempt has re¬
cently been made to introduce reindeer
breeding. In 1952, about 300 Lappish
reindeer, accompanied by some Lapp
herdsmen as tutors, were transferred to
the Godthaab District.
What, then, are conditions in Green¬
land today? It is difficult, not to say
impossible, to give an adequate pic¬
ture. Since World War II, the radical
changes which began slowly more than
200 years ago, have increased with ra¬
pidly growing speed. At present, Green¬
land is actually in a melting pot. The
transition from a natural to a money
economy is continuing, and at the same
time the first steps are now being taken
towards a gradual abolition of the mo¬
nopoly and an adjustment of the differ¬
ence between the price levels of Green¬
land and the world markets.
Social care has been improved. Any
Greenlander more than 55 years of age
who is not able to support himself or
his family is entitled to old age assis¬
tance, as also are orphans and widows,
and there is also ordinary relief for the
poor. As for sanitary conditions, the
country is divided into districts, each
having a medical officer, one or more
hospital-trained nurses, and a hospital,
and there are also a large number of
midwives. In order to improve hygiene
and make healthy dwellings easily
accessible, loans are granted by the go¬
vernment to enable the Eskimos to
start the building of new houses.
It is generally admitted, however,
that sanitary -organization is insuffi¬
cient and must be further developed.
Tuberculosis is, perhaps, the most
dangerous enemy of the Greenland
community ; between two and three
per cent of the population suffer from
active tuberculosis of - the lungs.
Like sanitary organization, education
is one of the greatest problems in
Greenland, because the extremely
scanty population is scattered over an
enormous area. School attendance is
compulsory for children between the
ages of seven and fourteen, and there
are no illiterates.
There are four continuation schools,
one of them for girls, and the seminary
at Godthaab, which originally served
only for training catechists (Eskimo
teachers and assistants of the parsons)
has been extended to include a two-
year commercial class. There are now
also a technical school and a special
school for wireless operators.
Among other reforms, the new
School Act of 1950 provides that there
be erected bilingual (Greenlandic and
Danish) elementary schools. While
nobody thinks of contesting the rights
of the native language, in which there
is already a small but steadily growing
literature, it is nevertheless generally
considered of paramount importance
that the instruction in Danish be
(Photos Vagn Hansed, Copenhagen.)
extended in order to facilitate the
absorption of European culture. It
should be added that there are three
public libraries in Greenland, and that
for many years, selected intelligent
Greenlanders have been given an op¬
portunity to study in Denmark through
two- or three-years schoarship grants.
No longer a colony
THE old-fashioned "management"
system, which at one time served
its purpose so well, has been
abolished and replaced by municipal
councils and a council for the country
as a whole, elected by universal suffrage
and possessing considerable authority.
Since 1953, when the colonial status of
Greenland was rescinded and the
country was incorporated in the
Kingdom, the Greenlanders elect two
members to the Danish parliament.
There can be no doubt that the
greatest problem of the future is the
inevitable transition from a natural to
a money' economy, and as long as it
has not been completed, considerable
dangers are involved. It is to be hoped
that the feeling of responsibility which
has always characterized Denmark's
attitude towards Greenland will finally
triumph.

### 69990: Canada's Eskimo carvings
THE QUEST FOR FOOD and animal fat for heat dominates the Eskimo's entire existence. He
keenly portrays the other hunters, the animals and objects around him, and manages to Infuse
his carvings with the excitement of the hunt. Each animal is depicted with the concentration of a
carver whose whole mind is focussed on his future food supply. Among the Eskimos it is thought
good luck to carve the animal one is about to hunt.
ESKIMO ART portrays subjects through a hunter's
eyes yet reveals typical traits of playfulness and good
humour. This little figure, "Man on Walrus Head with

### 69990: Canada's Eskimo carvings
Canada's Eskimo Carvings
IF you ásk an Eskimo of the Cana¬
dian Eastern Arctic if he carves
sinourak (art objects), he will
answer "Certainly !" For in a land
where life is governed by hunting and
where any one area will produce only
enough game to support a few
families there, is no specialization.
Every family must be able to do
everything : make a pair of boots,
build a kayak, fashion a knife, shape
a harpoon, sing a song and, of course,
create a pleasing object of art. Many
experts believe that their art equals
or surpasses any native art produced
on the North American continent. It
seems strange to find a rich, creative
and productive art flourishing in such
a barren land.
Living a semi-nomadic life in tents
and snowhouses along the treeless
shores - of Hudson Bay and Baffin
Island, the Eskimos are hindered by
a severe climate. Fewer than 5,000
in number and scattered over an area
of more than half a million square
miles, they rely entirely on the ' sea
and land animals around them to
provide food for themselves and fat to
heat their dwellings.
It seems probable that they first
introduced tailored clothing in Ame¬
rica.' Their parkas, trousers and boots
are unequalled for warmth and
comfort by anything we have yet been
able to design. The slim kayak is said
to be the world's most perfectly devis¬
ed craft. The seal oil lamp, the har-
.poon and fish spear are unique in de¬
sign and perfectly suited to their needs.
The Eskimo possesses a cheerfulness
James HOUSTON, a Quebec 'artist, first became
interested in Eskimo art during a trip to the east
coast of Hudson Bay in 1948. He returned with some
examples and interested the Canadian Handicrafts
Guild, a non-profit organization, and the Canadian
Government in developing an art project to encourage
the Eskimos' carvings and the sale of their work.
by James A. Houston
and tranquility of mind that seems
almost unknown in our modern civi¬
lization. He finds ample time in his
life of hardships to carve the fine
plastic forms that perfectly portray
his cultural rise above his savage
surroundings as well as his feeling
about the people and life around them.
The surge of civilization that swept
the North American continent in the
past few centuries stamped out many
Indian ritualistic tribal arts, leaving
in its wake a meaningless souvenir
trade ; but the Eskimos were protected
by their geographical remoteness, and
the link between past and present in
their art remains as yet unbroken.
The severe climate demands that the
Eskimo spend a good part of his life
inside his home ; he is invigorated by
the cold weather. As he has never
wasted his time on warfare and is by
nature industrious, he finds time to
contemplate ' and to perfect his
carvings.
In his art we see life through the
eyes of a hunter as he perfectly
portrays the moving things around
him with the keen, trained senses of
one whose very life depends upon
observation. -
"When hunting caribou one must
think like a caribou" say the Eskimos.
"Try to understand from its move¬
ments what it will do next."
As the season approaches for the
various animals to migrate to his
land, the Eskimo visualizes the thrills
of the hunt. As they bring in the
carvings you can feel the excitement
of the search for walrus, the snake¬
like thrust of the bear's head, of the
seals on new-formed ice, the first
coming of the geese, the salmon in the
rivers the fatness, the cunning, the
agility of, the animal portrayed with
the concentration of a carver whose
whole mind is focussed on the endless
quest for food.
The Eskimo's expert dissection of
game gives him a fine anatomical
knowledge clearly shown in his well-
proportioned carvings.
In their art the Eskimos still use
many primitive tools. They fashion
knives shaped to their individual
requirements using a shard of scrap
metal set in a bone handle. A steel
needle is employed for fine detail on
plastic forms and for incised drawings:
The bow-drill is operated by placing
the short rotating drill shaft in a
bone socket held in the mouth, leaving
the carver one hand with which to
work the bow back and forth and the
other hand free to hold the carving.
After the stone has been carved and
drilled into the desired shape, a rough
stone is used to attain smoothness,
then the carving is submerged in seal
oil for several days to allow the grey
stone to darken, bringing out the rich
serpentine greens and reds. After
this the carving is rubbed to its final
finish with stone dust and much hand
polishing.
Some carvers work with infinite care,
portraying the subject in minute
detail ; others prefer to create on a
wider plane, merely suggesting the
details while concentrating on compact
form suggestive of movement. However,
no art controversy exists among them,
since' the inherent politeness of the
Eskimo requires him to praise highly
the work of his fellow man no matter
how inferior it may be and to malign
his own efforts. The finer his carvings
are, the louder his protests that he
is unskilled and his work worthless.
Like the Chinese, the Eskimos keep
their small objects wrapped away
instead of on constant display, until

they are passed to ' a guest for in¬
spection.
Just before a walrus hunt, I visited
the camp of Kopeekolik at Povungne-
tuk on the east coast of Hudson Bay.
He offered nie the most perfect stone
walrus I had ever seen. I praised it
and asked him if he could make' me
another. After a perplexed silence he
said "You can see that I can carve
the likeness of a walrus ! Why should
you want another one ?" As far as
he was concerned he had proved his
craftsmanship as a walrus carver and
that was enough.
I suggested that I had never seen
him carve a caribou. After thinking
about this he became so excited that
he immediately went off to select a
piece of stone. The Eskimos
of the east coast of Hudson Bay are
fortunate in having many deposits of
stone along the coast suitable for
carvings and for making their tra¬
ditional stone lamps, though it must
sometimes be quarried under 15 feet
of water. Baffin Islanders are not so
fortunate and often must travel long
distances to obtain okusiksak (literally,
material for making kettles).
The Canadian Handicrafts Guild,
which has collected thousands of
pieces of carving for sale, is aware
that a demand for mass production
has, in the past, destroyed many
creative arts. In order not to kill the
Eskimo's creative ability, the Guild
does not seek to increase the present'
volume of the craftsman's 'work nor
change his methods in any way.
In the past four years the Eskimos
of the Canadian Eastern Arctic have
felt a real benefit from the sale of
their art and craftswork. It has .
eliminated government relief in areas
where _ hunting, has failed and has
given the Eskimo the opportunity to
support himself and maintain his self-
respect. It has not disrupted his
normal way of life since carving is
done in his spare time when the
weather will not permit hunting.
The Eskimos are happy in the
work of carving objects of art, and
given proper encouragement and
protection, It should continue to gain
recognition as a definite art form of
which Canada may well be proud.

Black Islands' of the Pacific Milky Way'
The Pacific islands, or "Oceania" as they are often called,
form a kind of "Milky Way" some 8,000 miles long,
stretching from the Philippines and New Guinea to
lonely Easter Island, about 2,500 miles west of Chile. They
consist of three great branches a northern chain, Micro¬
nesia ("small islands") ; a southern, broken double chain of"
islands, Melanesia ("islands of the blacks") and, where the
eastern ends of these two crescents meet, the groups of far-
flung scattered islands known as Polynesia ("many islands").
By far the largest single islands in these three chains are
found in Melanesia whose most important islands and groups
of islands are New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Admir¬
alty Islands, Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, New Caledonia
and the Fiji Islands.
Melanesia was given its name (black islands) because most
of its inhabitants are of Negroid stock. Two races, the Pa¬
puans in the southwestern part and the more numerous Me¬
lanesians in the other regions, make up the greater part of
the population. In the east there are some Polynesian
admixtures and in the west live the Negrito, a pygmy people.
It is probable that the Melanesian Islands, which lie close
to the Malay Peninsula, were settled before those of Micro¬
nesia and Polynesia. Yet despite their proximity to the
mainland of Asia, the Melanesians are the most primitive
people in the Pacific. They are not such accomplished sail-
lors as other -Pacific islanders, but they are better farmers,
raising the starchy taro plant, sweet potatoes and yams, ba¬
nanas, squashes and pumpkins in their garr'cns and small
fields. Although their social and political cu* toms are crude,
the Melanesians show marked skill in wood c.rving and other
decorative arts. (See article on Melanesian a:t, page 32.)
Their first regular contacts with Europe in civilization in
the 19th century, through the arrival of go-< ernment officials,
missionaries and traders, gave them an approach to modern
civilization which was piecemeal and non-comprehending. It
was not until military forces American, Australian and
Japanese' suddenly arrived in their midst during World
War II that they were able to see that European life was a
system in which the various parts religion, political or¬
ganization, currency, dress, etc. all fitted together.
This experience of seeing European customs as part of the
day-to-day life of a large community instead of encountering
them in piecemeal fashion has been an unsettling one for a
people who have hitherto always lacked a feeling of group
or cultural unity. But, as Dr. Margaret Mead, one of the
world's leading anthropologists, has pointed out in the follow¬
ing article, it has also opened up new possibilities for a
genuine integration of the Melanesians into the modern
world.

### 70010: Melanesia; 'black islands' of the Pacific 'Milky Way'
by Margaret Mead
HE Melanesian people of the Southwest Pacific
share with other South Sea Islanders their type
of habitat, small islands, either coral or volcanic,
and an occasional larger island which has served
the function of a "mainland" to the people of the
smaller islands. Like the other South Sea islanders they
were cut off from the main body of civilization until the
19th century, and experienced mainly contact with European
forms of exploration, trade, missions, recruiting and pros¬
pecting. Like the other South Sea islanders, their original
value to European men was seen as souls to save, labour for
plantations and* means to the acquisition of island raw
materials like copra, bêche de mer, and in- a few cases
mineral products.
They differed, however, from the Polynesians the South
Sea islander who has become familiar in song and story
in having a far less developed type of culture, lacking the
political ideas necessary for the development of kingdoms,
the Unking together of many people in one group, and lacMng
any developed historical sense. Darker skinned than the
other islanders Polynesians and Micronesians with stiff
frizzy hair, there was more probability of their being classi¬
fied with the people of Africa and so subjected to attitudes
developed during African-European contact.
Characteristically they were divided, one small group from
another, by differences in language often a language
would be spoken by less than a thousand people and the
practice of head-hunting, and linked together by. elaborate
trade arrangements which made possible a great deal of
geographical specialization.
Because they themselves lacked any kind of large group
political organization, and were also so accustomed to
forming economic ties outside their group, the -irregularities
of their contact with Europeans were accentuated. Different
missions, different recruiting practices, accentuated by the
rivalries, compromises, and fortunes of war among the

Western world, or conclude' that if the
new lives, the old dies.
Furthermore our calculations about
their future reckoned without the
unprecedented experiences of World
War II, when the Melanesians encoun¬
tered, not the isolated government
official, missionary or trader, but large
groups of men from highly organized
societies who were concerned with
their own affairs fighting a world
war rather than with persuading,
or forcing a handful of "natives" to
gather coconuts, bury their dead -
differently or pay a small head tax.
Anthropologists know that when
members of one society immigrate into
another society where they can witness
the whole on-going life of a large com¬
munity, they learn much more rapidly
than when the customs of a country
are brought to them piecemeal by sin¬
gle emissaries. In the case of the Mela¬
nesians whole villages, whole tribes had
the experience usually reserved for
single immigrants, and they combined
with it the security of remaining in
their own land, where the reefs and
bush are well known to them, the fish
and birds familiar.
Equipped with the by-products of
the economic relationships of the last
century a knowledge of money, and
a trade language, Neo-Melanesian,
which is based on the grammar of
Melanesian with a vocabulary from the
whole world, although preponderantly
English in origin they have begun
to comprehend with great rapidity that
European life is a system, a whole way
of life in which all the various parts
religious belief, political behaviour
currency, dress, sex ethics, medicine
all fit together. From an approach to
modern civilization which was piece¬
meal and non-comprehending, they
have moved to one which has the possi¬
bility of a genuine new integration.
The Polynesians like the Samoans
and Tongans were able to work out
new cultural forms which included
Christianity, literacy and the incorpo¬
ration of European manufactured pro¬
ducts and still maintain their sense of
dignity because before the coming of
Europeans they already had the neces¬
sary sense of themselves as a people.
The Melanesians are getting a similar
sense of Ethic Identity by having ex¬
perienced the same sense of what being
a people is, in their contact with large
Australian, American and Japanese mi¬
litary organizations in World War II.
All over Melanesia since the war
there have been attempts on the part
of local groups to establish a local ver¬
sion of European-American culture.
Old rudimentary political forms of their
own, and the systems set up by Euro¬
peans local constables appointed by
government officers with limited police-
power or liaison duties^have been
called in question, as the Melanesians
attempted to work out line .and staff
organizations, to " include "councils",
"committees", "customs", "passes", etc.
into their local Ufe.
It is they now who are insisting on-
the individual right of contract" and
right of a man to the money he earns,
an insistence which is often inconve¬
nient to the trader and recruiter, who
has learned to exploit the older kin
organization and "buy boys" from the
old men, or bribe the government
appointed constable illegally to use his
power to recruit labour.
Local leaders- have set up "armies"
and "navies", have collected sums of
two most unfortunate labels, being
called either "cargo cults", that is mys¬
tical nativistic cults which arise out of
the disappointments of contact between
a more and a less developed civiliza¬
tion, or "Melanesian nationalism".
The task before us is to realise that
this mid-20th century renaissance of
one of the most primitive groups of
people in the world, must be seen in
mid-20th century terms, as part of a
CANNIBALISM still exists in the interior of some islands although the open warfare between
tribes which once provided the victims is now infrequent. After wreaking vengeance on their
enemies, the victors ate them, believing that they would thus acquire the virtues of the dead.

money which have been branded as
"war chests". There have been diffi¬
culties with the Missions, many of them
still operating in the climate of opinion
of pre-World War I, insulated for half
a century from a world which has pass¬
ed from a belief that it was necessary
for men to submit to deprivation with
good grace to a world in which educa¬
tion, medical care and economic ade¬
quacy for every human being is seen
as an obtainable goal.
Government officials, most of them
fresh from the sufferings and hard¬
ships of World War II have tended to

manifestations which have received

These Melanesian movements are
not nationalistic yet although we

en tactics. They are not mere "cargo
cults", or blind alley defeatist attempts
to cut themselves off from the religion
and politics of a world with which they
are unable to deal. They are a search
for an ethnic identity, a sense of them¬
selves as a people, grounded in their
realization of what being American, or
Australian or Japanese means. It is a

quickly, formulas for bringing them

### 70020: Magic' arts of the South Pacific
of the South
Pacific
Artists and craftsmen, like these villagers in New Guinea, have made Melanesia one of the richest
primitive art regions in the world.
THE South Pacific in general is' an area of such great
and far-flung diversityin races, customs, beliefs and
in material culture that the arts of this vast area are
as manifold as its races, and the variety of styles even greater
than in Africa.
Of all the arts of Oceania, that of Melanesia is the most
varied and the most fantastic. The region itself is lush,
dramatic and often dangerous. Volcanic eruptions, tidal
waves and storms give to many parts of it a melodramatic,
violent quality that has strongly affected the lives and beliefs
of its inhabitants.
Awed by natural phenomena the people attribute them
to supernatural forces. Believing that spirits invest animals,
places and objects, they perform long and dramatic rites
to venerate and gain the favour of these spirits and to invoke
the aid of ancestors.
Secret societies, initiation rites, elaborate communal cere¬
monies, masked dancing, head-hunting expeditions and
cannibalistic practices are so many expressions of Melanesian
preoccupation with the supernatural..
Melanesian art reflects the same preoccupation. Indeed,
its relation to ceremonies .and occult practices must be taken
into account in judging
its effectiveness. An ac¬
tive cult of the dead ex¬
plains the abundance of
ancestor figures. A rich
ceremonial life requires
all sorts of objects, inclu¬
ding masks, drums, clubs,
shields, paddles and orna¬
ments, and many Mela¬
nesian objects must be
seen as "props" for use in
dramatic ceremonies or as
terrifying "tests" sprung
suddenly on initiation
candidates.
The richest flowering
of Melanesian art is found
in New Guinea over 1,300
miles long and the second
largest island in the
world which has been
described as one of the
three most prolific centres
of primitive sculpture in
wood, the others being
Negro Africa and North- Small clay mask from the New Hebrides.
Carved neck-rest from New Guinea
west America. Through¬
out this vast ' island
there is hardly any im¬
plement, ritual or profane,
.without a plastic or linear
decoration of some kind.
In New Guinea, as else¬
where in Melanesia, the
aesthetic idiom varies
greatly from district to
district, although six main
different local styles can
be distinguished. These
correspond to the six main
culture 'areas: Dutch New
Guinea, in the west; the
Sepik River and the Huon
Gulf, in the north ; Torres Straits and the Gulf of Papua,
in the south ; and the Massim Area in the east.
Among the most striking styles, those of the Sepik River
and the Gulf of Papua are distinguished by their use of co¬
lour to emphasize design and the effect of violence and sen¬
suality they convey. The diversity of conventions used in the
representation of facial features and parts of the body by the
Sepik River artists is bewildering. Eyes, for example,
appear as pin points or as huge circles, as narrow slits or as
wide ovals. Heads may be round, oval or diamond shape.
Such an arbitrary rearrangement gives to these figures an
urgent, excited air.
These carvings beak-nosed figurines and brooding shell-
eyed masks have a peculiar vitality, a kind of nightmare
reality. The striking use of colour red, white, black and
orange accentuates the intensity of expression and the
perversity of form. Never did the primitive imagination
translate more vividly into art the concepts and creatures
which haunt it.
In contrast to this feverish and even morbid art is the
restrained and delicate carving work of the Massim Area of
New Guinea. Primarily an art of line, its designs are pre¬
cisely composed and carefully executed. Magnificent designs
and scrolls, incised on the surface of a hard dark wood and
filled in with white and red, give it a distinctive character.
In Melanesia even utilitarian objects are generally adorned
with motifs derived from the mythology, religions, beliefs,
ancestor cult or the magic of the tribes. One curious
example of art stimulation through the ancestor cult is found
in the carving of mortuary figures called korowaar in, the
Geelvihk Bay area of north-west New Guinea.
Originally a korowaar was simply the relics of a dead per-

son, a handful of dried
bones sewn up in a cloth.
Then it became the cus¬
tom to place the dead
person's skull on a wooden
support, which in turn
became the carving of a
small human figure to
which the exaggeration
of the legs, arms and
head gave a monumental
character.
The figure was carved
during the life of a per¬
son so that at the mo¬
ment Of death the spirit Carved she" ornament, Solomon Isles,
could enter it. When a
village sorcerer wished to contact the ancestors of the tribe,
he would pick up the figure in his right hand and use it to
strike the ground until he went into a trance.
Ancestor worship is reflected strongly in the architectural
carvings on the houses of the Melanesians, notably in New
Caledonia. Human heads and faces are found flanking the
door, on the lintels and windows and on the roof spires. All
house sculptures are meant as memorials to the ancestor and
to preserve his protection. During jedo, the mourning cere¬
mony, the carvings regarded as participating in sorrow are
"killed", by being slashed and mutilated with knives. New
Caledonian art is essentially a sculptor's art as many other
wood carvings show. These include finely' shaped pick-like
or "bird head" clubs, wooden ceremonial knives with heads
or faces carved in relief, decorated combs and round-headed
axes symbols of power.
Intense effort has gone into the production of objects used
at religious ceremonies. This has been specially marked
among tribes in the Papuan Gulf area whose ceremonies were
organized in cycles often spread over a decade. Governed by
strict taboos and ritualistic, often magical, procedures, the
making of huge, elaborate bark-cloth masks absorbed nearly
all of this time. Sometimes as many as 100 masks, some of
them 13 feet high were produced. Ancestor figures and pla¬
ques, shields, belts and clubs were also carved for the rites.
The vast amount of carved, modelled, painted and fabri¬
cated objects produced by the Melanesians using wood, bone,
bark, stone, fibre and pith, as well as decorative materials
such as feathers, shells and leaves, has made their islands
one of the richest primitive art regions in the world. Here
are artistic taste and tra¬
ditions which should be
respected and preserved,
however much the Mela¬
nesian way of Ufe may
change through ever in¬
creasing contacts with

### 70021: Neither isolation nor assimilation: protection, India's policy for its 30,000,000 tribesmen
India's policy for its 30,000,000 tribesmen
NEITHER ISOLATION
NOR ASSIMILATION
-PROTECTION
b y Dr. Verrier E I w i n
N modern times,
there have been
three different
methods of ap¬
proach to the
problem of the
thirty million tribesmen who live on
the frontiers of Indian civilization. The
former British Government tended on
the whole to leave them alone, partly
because the task of administration,
especially in the wild border areas, was
difficult and unrewarding; partly from
a desire to quarantine them from pos¬
sible political infection; and partly
from a genuine belief that they were
happier and better as they were.
In sharp distinction to this is a
policy of "assimilation" which has
bpcome very DODUlar sinre Inripnpnd-
ence. Both Christian missionaries and
Hindu social reformers have, in their
different ways, desired to see the
primitive civilized, their "inferior"
social customs and ideas eliminated
and their identity assimilated either
into the Christian church or into the
general framework of Hindu society.
The Christian missionaries have
had striking successes in some tribal
areas, though they have failed in
others. Especially in Assam, they
have converted a very high percentage
Dr. VERRIER ELWIN has spent most of the past two
decades among aboriginal tribesmen in India as
anthropological consultant to the Indian Government.
Founder of a settlement devoted to aboriginal welfare
and humanitarian research on their problems, he was
the editor of "Man in India", from 1943 to 1949
He is the author of Tribal Myths of Orissa, The Tribal
Art of Middle India, ana* Myths of Middle India.
of such tribes as the Lushais, Khasis
and the so-called Naga groups. The
Christian Khasis have preserved their
matriarchal social structure, and the
Lushais and Nagas have retained
certain aspects of their life (in par¬
ticular their very beautiful hand-
weaving), but in the main they have
lost most of what is distinctively tribal,
adopting a semi-western culture.
Similarly, the ambitious program¬
mes of education, reform and change
now being initiated by most of the
State Governments, while bringing
many economic and social benefits to
the people, are likely to bring to an
end the older values, good and bad
alike, of tribal life. For though a
sincere desire for tribal welfare is now
everywhere apparent, this is not
matched by an equal interest in or
respect for tribal culture.
You cannot make an omelette with¬
out breaking eggs, and the continued
existence of the tribes as tribes is
regarded as of less importance than
the march of civilization. This policy
has led to strong zenophobic reactions
in some areas, and in Bihar, for
example, the separatist Jharkand
Party is the largest opposition group
in the State Assembly.
Between these two extremes of do¬
ing too little and doing too much,
there is a third policy, with which the
name of the Prime Minister, Mr.
Nehru, is associated. In one of the
most remarkable speeches ever made
by a public man on the problem of
HORNED HEAD-DRESS is part of the
traditional costume of the Durwas of

primitive peoples, Mr. Nehru spoke of
the strong attraction which he had for
the tribesmen and described how he
approached them' "in a spirit of
comradeship and not like someone
aloof who had come to look at them,
examine them, weigh them, measure
them and report about them or to try

### 70021: Neither isolation nor assimilation: protection, India's policy for its 30,000,000 tribesmen
and make them conform to another
way of life."
"I am alarmed", he said, "when
I see not only in this country, but
in other great countries, tooAhow
anxious people are to shape others
according to their own image or like¬
ness, and to impose on them their
particular way of living." He declar¬
ed that he was not sure which, the
modern or the tribal, was the better
way of living. "In some respects I
am quite certain theirs is better/'
"There is no point in trying to make
of them a second-rate copy of our¬
selves." He emphasized the^ import¬
ance of encouraging the tribal langu¬
ages, so that they would not only
prevail but flourish. He- insisted that
a measure of protection must be given
so that "'no outsider can take posses¬
sion of tribal lands or forests or inter¬
fere with them in any way except with
their consent and goodwill."
He hoped that the high sense of
discipline, the power to enjoy life, the
love of dance and song would endure
among the tribesmen. Schemes for
welfare, education, communications,
medical relief were no doubt essential:
"one must always remember, however,
that we do not mean to interfere with
their way of life, but want to help
them to live it."
Now this attitude poses a serious
problem to the administrator. The
assimilation policy which holds, broad¬
ly speaking, that there is not much to
be said for tribal life ; that if it disap¬
pears it will not matter greatly ; that
the "backward" must be brought for¬
ward and that the low are to be
"uplifted", is simple and straightfor¬
ward ; it is logical, and it brings many
benefits at a price. So did the
British policy of leaving well alone
though at a different price.
But the new attitude, the Nehru
attitude, has complex implications.
For unhappily, tribal culture is the
most delicate thing in the world. Of
it we may say what Oscar Wilde said
of innocence : it is a delicate exotic
fruit touch it, and the bloom is
gone. Tribal social organization in
India has to some extent managed to
survive, though many acculturated
tribal communities have suffered a
tragic moral decline. The tolerant
influences of Hinduism have enriched
tribal religion with a loftier ethic and
vitalized it with a nobler conception
of deity, but at the same time they
have often brought the more dubious

trying to make of
them a second-rate
copy of ourselves'

accretions of new gods to be placated
and new taboos to be observed.
The contact of civilization has
generally had an adverse effect on
tribal art and culture. His exquisite
taste for design and colour disappears
when a tribesman enters a shop in the
bazaar. The splendid tribal dress and
ornamentation is rapidly abandoned
in favour of a parody of western cloth¬
ing. The tribal languages have shown
an alarming lack of vitality when
confronted by a system of education
in another tongue. In some areas the
dance has died out altogether, in
UNESCO COURIER N" 8-9 1954
others it has become. woefully debased.
The tribal craftsman does not seem
able to maintain his standards before
external competition.
The task set by Mr. Nehru, there¬
fore, is no easy one, for it involves
several ideals that have rarely been
found compatible. The first is to
preserve, strengthen and develop .all
that is best in tribal society, culture,
art and language. The second is to
protect tribal economic rights. The
third is to unite and integrate the
tribes in a true heart-unity with India
as a whole, so that they may play a
full part in her life. And the last is
to develop welfare and educational
facilities so that every tribesman may
have an equal opportunity with his
fellow-citizens of the open country
and the plains.
India has one advantage in attempt¬
ing to fulfil this exacting programme.
She is starting late. The older
British administrators, as we have
seen, rarely attempted anything of the
kind. This had its disadvantages, but
at the same time the tribesmen were,
on the whole spared the exploitation
and degradation that has overcome
their brethren in other lands.
Today India is able to approach her
task with an informed and enlightened
public conscience to inspire her and
the findings of the " anthropological
and social sciences to direct her. And
if there is need to protect the tribes¬
men, India is awake to the need of
protecting and helping all her many
millions of poor peasants. The tribes¬
men are being integrated into a
country that is on the move, that is
vitally alive to economic inequalities,
whose best men do in fact worship at
the altar of Daridranarayana, the
Lord of the Poor, which was Mahatma
Gandhi's favourite name for God.

INDIA'S
TRIBES
No interference in
village life and customs
(Continued from previous page)
Since Independence, India has done
a great deal for her tribes. Nowhere is
this more evident than on the North-
East Frontier, that great area of over
30,000 square miles of tangled hill and
forest, where something like a million
tribesmen, have lived almost untouched
and largely unknown until recent times.
Here a special administration of hand-
picked officers is extending its activi¬
ties number of administrative
centres has risen from 12 to 43 in four
years according to a policy based on
the ideas of Mr. Nehru, that with
everything possible done for the people,
there should be no direct interference
in tribal life and custom.
To this, however, there were bound to
be certain exceptions. On this frontier
the problem of peace has been para¬
mount. As recently as 1942, a former
Governor of Assam, Sir Robert Reid,
could write that "general orders stop¬
ping wars would be impossible to en¬
force without constant punitive expe¬
ditions. The remedy might well be
worse than the disease." Yet within
the last few years, inter-village warfare
has been largely checked and head¬
hunting has become a thing of the
past. By a combination of friendliness,
courage and firmness, a method of
warfare at once heroic and treacher
ous, valiant and despicable, has come
to an end. And where formerly life
was continually disturbed, the people
are now able to cultivate the arts of
peace.
In this area the method of schooling
being introduced is that known in India
as "basic education" which, with its
emphasis on manual activities and the
tribal languages as medium of instruc¬
tion, is admirably adapted to the needs'
of simple hill-people. In addition there
are many centres for training the
tribesmen in a variety of crafts, care
being taken that this shall be on lines
native to them.
Improvement of agriculture, the first _
essential for economic improvement, is
being energetically pursued, and com¬
munications, of vital importance in
these wild and lonely hills, are push¬
ing forward. Slavery, which has been
practised from times immemorial, is
disappearing; the opium problem is
being scientifically tackled; the doctor
and the vaccinator are extending their
gentle offices of mercy to the wildest
tribes. And everything is being done
in a spirit of friendliness and res¬
pect, so that there shall be a mini¬
mum of psychological disturbance and
no loss of self-reliance or of pride in
the classic heritage of tribal culture.
This is an enterprise, at once scien¬
tific and humane, of which India may
well be proud.
HOMAGE TO A SNAKE GOD Is being paid by this Saora
shaman in the hills of Orissa as he adds his contribution to
a cluster of simple gifts. But more and more tribesmen in
India declare themselves as Hindus or Christianswhich adds
to the difficulty of keeping statistics on their population.
Today people are classified according to their tribal origin
instead of their tribal religions.
THE LONG DRUM of an Orissa tribal village leaves its shelter on the backs of
four Juang youths. It symbolizes the tribal traditions India is determined to preserve
within the framework of a campaign against illiteracy. In I 93 I, only .58 % (one out
of 1 72 persons) of India's tribesmen were classified as capable of reading and writing.
"It would be over-optimistic to assume that the situation among tribal peoples has
improved", the International Labour Organization has commented in a recent survey.
However, an active government effort promises to bear fruit for the future.

only reason is that there is not any
bookseller or any office authorized to
accept the subscription fee. And that it
is not possible to send any money
abroad. It is not possible to order any
foreign books or any publications from
abroad for any individual now. I myself
have given up completely when trying
to get anythjng concerning the ascent
of Mount Everest one year ago.
Please, do not think that there are
-not people interested in the work of
Unesco or in reading The Courier in our
country. I am sure that there would be
as many keen readers of The Courier, if
not more, as in any other country on the
globe. Also our people are interested in
the education for peace, for internation¬
al understanding, friendship and real
unlimited co-operation as well as in the
realization of the Declaration of Human
Rights. I am sure that also in our
country there would be as many support¬
ers of Unesco work and as many readers
of The Courier just as among the big¬
gest proportion known in your publica¬
tion office. If possible I would order the
whole list of publications issued by
Unesco until now and very many issued
by other specialized agencies of U.N. Not
only Iplenty of such orders would be
pouring like a lifegiving rain from
teachers and intellectual workers from
countries such as ours.
When not able to order and to read
the issues of The Courier of this year I
turn back to the previous years and
with unlimited and ever refreshed inter¬
est I re-read what I read last year and
earlier.
What I would like to recommend is
this : Please, do mind the future needs
of readers in such countries like our
country to give them the opportunity in
reading The Courier and otner publica¬
tions issued by Unesco in the future as
soon as the free flow of publications for
education for peace and international
co-operation will be possible.
Please, accept my best thanks for all
that has been printed in The Courier
and other publications and all best
wishes for future work in the spirit of
U.N. Our prayers are with you and don't
forget also WE are your supporters and
also believe that ALL people are the
members of ONE family under ONE
Father and that happiness and the ba¬
lance of spirit and mind cannot be
established without this sincere open
mind co-operation and mutual respect.
Our hearts don't* recognize any ex¬
ception except of people whose hearts
are made from stone. The international
co-operation, friendship, free travelling,
the realisation of the Declaration of
Human Rights in its full meaning and
in its broadest sense is for us more
important than daily bread and I think
it is as necessary as fresh air and ihe
nutrition of our food. I have the full
comprehension for people who can't live
without these basic values.

CORONA PHOTOGRAPHY IS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD
Due to clouds the recent solar eclipse was only partially visible in many
countries, but for the first time in history a major effort was made to
observe and photograph an eclipse from the air (photo above). In
photo taken over James Bay, Canada, (top of page), a burst of light
flares out across the moon's rim. This brilliant "diamond ring" effect
shows the first peep of the sun's disk as it burst from behind the moon
after the eclipse. The striking photo (upper right) of the luminous
"corona" or crown of light with long streamers was taken in Khartoum,
Sudan, by Dr. W. Jaschek of the Vienna Observatory, during the eclipse
of 1952. First successful photograph of the corona, a daguerreotype,
(lower right) was taken at Koenigsberg, East Prussia, a hundred years
ago. (Photos copyright American Airlines-Hayden Planetarium Eclipse

### 70027: In the dark of the sun
In the dark of the sun
THE eclipse of the sun on the thir¬
tieth of June was an interna¬
tional drama that was seen by
the largest audience of all time. Never
before has the shadow of the moon
crossed an area so large and so den¬
sely inhabited. Its path ran from
Nebraska in the western United States
to Jodhpur in India. It was at sunrise
in America, at sunset in India. Yet it
xwas seen almost simultaneously in
most of 'North America, all of Europe,
in northeastern Africa and a large part
of western Asia. In America its climax
was caught by a telescope at the Uni¬
versity of Minnesota and was broad¬
cast by television into many millions of
homes. Not until 2151 will an eclipse
again be visible to so large a fraction
of the human race.
Dramatic and mysteriously beautiful
it was. But it did
not arouse the panic
fears of centuries
ago when an eclipse
was at best a por¬
tent of disaster and
at worst an attack
on the sun god by a black dragon in
the sky. The beasts, demons and dei¬
ties that once peopled the heavens
have vanished under the keen eyes of
the telescope and the logic of science.
They have been replaced by less
childish and more inspiring concepts.
The world is now convinced that the
motions of the "heavenly bodies" are
mechanical and are subject to precise¬
ly the same inexorable laws as the
fall of an apple or the movement of a
clock. This recognition of natural law
is, indeed, one of the criteria of civili¬
zation. But that does not mean that
eclipses of the sun ' are commonplace
or that astronomers have lost interest
in them.
Every total eclipse, in which the face
of the sun is completely hidden by the
moon, is an opportunity to see and
photograph what the brilliance of the
sun's face usually forbids.
The great observatories of all nations
plan for years ahead to find a spot
where the length of totality is a
maximum, where the sky is most likely
to be clear, and that can be reached
with many tons of costly and sensitive
instruments. The teams of experts
with all their equipment often travel
many thousands of miles to the loca¬
tion, for the shadow almost never falls
on an established observatory.
The international drama
of the sun's total eclipse
T
HEN" the sequence of operations to
be done during the brief two or
three minutes of totality are
rehearsed on split-second timing
every moment must be well spent.
Often when the time comes the astro¬
nomers themselves see nothing of the
great show, being intent on their
instruments and especially on .the
cameras that provide the permanent
record. The results unless clouds get
in the wayjustify all the effort and
expense.
The eclipse of 1919 is an example.
But for it, atomic energy might still
by Gerald Wendt
be undiscovered. The story goes back
to 1905 when the young and unknown
Albert Einstein published his theory of
relativity. Few people understood it
because of its mathematical difficulty.
Fewer still thought much of it because
it seemed to contradict common sense.
It held that at high velocities, compar¬
able to that of light, ordinary stan¬
dards of distance, time and mass no
longer are valid. As a particle ap¬
proaches the velocity of light its mass
increases, said he, so that if it could
attain that velocity which it cannot
its mass would be infinite. Also he
claimed that theoretically matter can
be changed into energy and energy into
matter. Though
this is now done
every day in the
atomic piles and the
great cyclotrons (See
The Courier for De¬
cember, 1953), it was
then almost unthinkable and could
not be tested or proved.
But there was one minor prediction
of Einstein's that could be tested by
exact measurement. It was that light
rays passing through space could be
bent by the intense gravitational field
of a large mass like the sun. This too
was unthinkable according to older
theory because gravity acts only on
material objects and particles while
light was a vibration in the immaterial
"ether" that was supposed to fill
empty space. But if Einstein was
right the light from a distant star;
passing closely . by the sun, would be
curved a bit and would thus reach the
earth at a slightly different angle. So
the star would seem to have changed
its position in the sky. Such an effect
could be noticed only at the time of a
total eclipse of the .sun, when its great
light blacks out and the stars emerge
from behind it.
By 1919, at the
first total eclipse
after the close of
World War I, astro¬
nomers were ready
to make the test.
During the eclipse the star-field around
the hidden sun was photographed. The
star positions were then compared with
those of the same stars six months
later when they shone by night, with
the sun on the opposite side of the sky.
Careful measurements showed that
they had moved. Since the stars do not
jump about the sky, the rays of
starlight must have, been bent by the
sun. Einstein was right !
That eclipse, observed by a few
scientists on an island in the South
Pacific, unnoticed by governments
and the masses of mankind, was a
turning point of history. For if Ein¬
stein was right on this point he was
almost certainly right in his basic
conceptions of the universe. After
these eclipse measurements were
published, the scientific world began
to take Einstein seriously. One single
but solid fact overthrew the age-old
theories of the nature of matter and
energy, of light and the ether, of space
and gravity.
Unlike most mortals, the scientists
were ready, whether they liked it or
not, to change the ideas they had
always held, not only because of
Einstein's theory but because of what
the eclipse proved. Among the many
consequences was the study of very
high-velocity particles in the rays
from radium, which again confirmed
the theory of relativity. Then came
the new world of cyclotrons and atom-
smashers and, twenty years after that
eclipse, the direct conversion of matter
into energy which, in 1945 produced
the atomic bomb and now generates
useful industrial power from the
fission of uranium atoms.
N
Science's most productive
half hour in history
O one could foresee these conse¬
quences when astronomers pre¬
pared for the 1919 eclipse. No
one knows what any eclipse may reveal.
It is precisely because of this that each
eclipse is so important.
While no eclipse permits a study of
the actual surface of the sun, the
most striking revelation is always the
great luminous "corona", or crown of
light, which surrounds the hidden sun
on all sides and seems to stream
outward into space with a faint pearly
or greenish light. It may be seen
only during the moments of totality.
In the June eclipse it extended beyond
the sun for a distance more than twice
the diameter of the sun itself, almost
two million miles.
The cause of the corona is not
known, nor is its composition. Its
temperature is extremely high be¬
tween half a million and a million
degrees and thus much hotter than
the surface of the sun itself. The
corona does not show the lines of the
ordinary chemical elements in its spec¬
trum. This may be because at its high
temperature the
electrons have been
stripped from all the
atoms, leaving bare
protons and neu¬
trons and probably
also unattached
electrons. Matter in this state is not
known anywhere else.
Apparently proton or electron beams,
and perhaps cosmic rays, are ejected
from the corona into outer space, some
of them toward the earth. A large
proportion of the eclipse expeditions
from the great observatories devote
themselves to the study of the corona.
Closer to the sun there are also
brilliant spots of light. They are in
fact enormous flames that rise from
the sun's surface with explosive speed.
These jets are from five hundred miles
up to 100,000 miles in diameter, in
which an object the size of the earth,
only 8,000 miles in diameter, would be
completely lost. Within two to fifteen
minutes these ñames shoot up at super¬
sonic speed to heights of 10,000 miles
or more.
In order to study these solar flames
and to record them on motion pictures,

out.
an "artificial eclipse" has been devised
in recent years, originally in France.
This is done with a coronograph, a
sort of telescope which covers the
sun's disk with a black plate but
permits study of the brilliant flames,
precisely as in a natural eclipse. " At
the High Altitude Observatory main¬
tained by Harvard University and the
University of Colorado on one of the
high peaks of the Colorado mountains,
motion pictures have been taken -
which show the luminous gas in
constant motion, sometimes slow,
sometimes fast.
Often knots of gas drop gracefully
down toward the surface at speeds of
many thousands of miles per hour.
Meanwhile other streamers whirl
upwards like tornadoes to a height of
100,000 miles, or narrow tongues of
gas shoot upwards at the rate of 100
miles a second. Occasionally, a great
streamer that has quietly arched up
from the surface across a distance of"
250,000 miles will explode; the bright
arch is lifted at" the centre then blown
far out into space. The flames seem
to be composed of hydrogen gas at
temperatures of 15,000 to 30,000
degrees C.
They are probably related to still
another luminous phenomenon that
is much fainter. This is the "zodiacal
light", a luminosity that is so faint,
that it cannot even be seen at the
time of the total eclipse because the
corona is almost as bright as moon¬
light. It ;an be seen and photograph¬
er1, however, at the time of the total
eclipse if the observation is made at
a point where the totally eclipsed sun
is beneath the horizon, either just
before sunrise or just after sunset.
When the earth itself thus blacks
out the corona, a long streamer of
light seems to extend from the sun
many millions of miles in the plane of
the sun's orbit. Tt gets its name from
the path of the sun across the sky,
called the zodiac. The cause of this
light is unknown but its study, done
in the total darkness at the precise
spot on the earth where the sun will
rise in total' eclipse, is one of the most
intriguing aspects of solar research.
There is one practical aspect of
eclipse research, namely the meas¬
urement of the size of the earth and
of the exact distance between' conti¬
nents that are separated by the sea.
The speed of the moon's shadow,
moving eastward at an average rate
of about 1,700 miles "per hour, is
exactly known. If then the exact
moment of the passage of the shadow
is measured at two distant points, a
simple calculation gives the exact
distance between those points, thus
between a place in Europe and one in
America. Indeed it permits calcu¬
lation of the exact size of the earth
itself. At the June 1954 eclipse ten
observing stations were established for
these measurements, reaching from
James Bay in Ontario, Canada, to
Bandar Shah in Iran, by way of
Labrador, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe
Islands to Sweden. But at most of
these stations clouds interfered with
successful measurements.
The results of observations of the
June eclipse will not be known for
some time since the photographs will
need much careful expert study
before conclusions can be reached. It
was a disappointing show for most of
the expeditions because clouds inter¬
fered in Canada and in Sweden, where
most American and European observers
were stationed. Yet there will always
be another eclipse and the curiosity of
the astronomers is not likely ever to
be satisfied. All present knowledge
has been gained from a sum total of
only about 30 minutes of totality in
all the eclipses that have been observ¬
ed by modern instruments. It is the
most productive half-hour in the
history of science.

the solar observatory atop the 6,000 feet Wen¬
delstein mountain in Bavaria, (above) studied

intense, and throughout the eclipse zone people
craned their necks and like this group in Ger¬
many (right) watched the phenomenon through
dark glasses. (Photos copyright Deutsche Presse

### 70027: In the dark of the sun
UNESCO COURIER N°" 8-9 1954
THE UNITED STATES: To study the enormous flames which rise
from the sun's surface with explosive speed, scientists use a coronagraph,
a sort of telescope which covers the sun's disk "with a black plate, thereby
creating an "artificial eclipse" and allowing the flames to be photographed.
Photo (above left), showing a stupendous burst of hot gases from the sun's
surface, was taken with the aid of the coronagraph (above right), which is
J housed in the High Altitude Observatory in the Rocky Mountains of
Colorado, U.S.A. (photo, left). But there are still problems that can
only be solved by observation during a natural eclipse. (Photos copyright
High Altitude Observatory, University of Colorado).
SWEDEN: The photograph of the completely
obscured sun (below) taken at Joenkoeping, Sweden,
on June 30, 1954, was telegraphed to the world's
press immediately after the eclipse. Elsewhere in
Sweden, at Oskarsham, an American expedition set
up a 25-ton radio telescope (upper part of photo)
to receive and record possible radio signals during
the 1 52 seconds of the eclipse. Below it is the
horizontal camera with which the same expedition
photographed stars in vicinity of blacked-out sun
so as to measure the bending of light in the sun's
gravitational field. (Photos copyright United Press).

### 70028: The World's hungry readers
The worlds hungry readers
IT would be difficult to think of life
today without paper. Everywhere
we turn we find it. In fact, the
only other commodity for which hu¬
manity has a greater hunger is food.
Because of man's insatiable desire
for education and information, paper
has attained a priceless value, for what
the wire conductor is to electricity, so
paper is to knowledge the medium
without which its wide conveyance and
use would be impossible.
We might even say that our civiliza¬
tion is based on paper. Without paper
for textbooks and exercise books there
would be no proper education; without
cheap and plentiful paper for printing
newspapers it would be difficult to
circulate information, and the people
in different countries would be igno¬
rant of one another's ideas and activi¬
ties; without letter paper there would
be no normal cultural, administrative
and business correspondence.
The greatest demand is for news¬
print the endless miles of paper
which feed the world's newspaper
printing presses. In a single year the
newspapers of the United States and
Canada, for example, use enough
newsprint paper to make a band fifty
miles wide around the earth. In the
form of the standard roll this paper
would have a length of. 13,000,000 miles.
In 1951, the consumption of news-

was formerly editor of "Excelsior" a daily paper,
and a founder (with André Breton) of the surrealist
movement. In 1933 he gained the Strassburger Prize,
awarded for the best article on United States affairs
published in the world press. Until 1940 he was
director of Radio Tunis and in 1945 he headed the
foreign broadcasts service of the Radiodiffusion Fran¬
çaise Since 1951 he has been a member of Unesco's
Division for Improvements of Means and Techniques
of Communication (Press Section). He carried out a

by Philippe Soupault
print throughout the world was
9,460,000 tons (*) according to a study
published by Unesco (Nos. 10 and 11 of
the Reports and Papers on Mass, Com¬
munication). During the same year
the world used roughly 9,000,000 tons
of printing paper (other than news¬
print) and writing paper.
But the world's hunger for paper
grows larger each year. According to
a study made for Unesco by the Intel¬
ligence Unit of "The Economist", of
London, (No 12 of the Reports and
Papers on Mass Communication), the
world demand for newsprint will pro¬
bably continue to increase so rapidly
that by 1965 it will be over 15,500,000
tons. The demand for printing paper
(other than newsprint) and writing
paper -will be in the region of
12,500,000 tons.
The basis for these forecasts was an
analysis of population and illiteracy
trends, the availability of educational
facilities, the trend of domestic paper
production, and political and economic
developments. An evaluation of each
of these factors was made for every
country and territory.
The single most important fact
which these figures bring home is that
unless a large-scale effort is made to
increase paper production the world
will become more and more starved of
this vital commodity. That is why
Unesco, primarily concerned with the
serious effects this would have on
educational, scientific and cultural
development and on the free flow of
information, has been working with
the United Nations and the other UN
Specialized Agencies to put the facts
before the public. Only a world-wide
effort in the planning and production
of printing and writing paper will
meet the increased demand.
What are some of the facts brought
out by the Unesco studies? One of the
most surprising is the disproportion in
paper consumption between different
countries. For example, in 1951, while
a citizen of the United States "con¬
sumed", on the average, 35.1 kilogram¬
mes of newsprint a year and 28.6 kilo¬
grammes of printing and writing
paper, an inhabitant of Indonesia was
obliged to make do with the meagre
ration of 100 grammes of newsprint
and 400 grammes of writing and
printing paper.
This is no "freak" example for a
more general view confirms this lack
of balance, and shows the extent to
which the per capita consumption of
newsprint varies from one part of the
world to another. In 1951, for ins¬
tance, that of the United States was
over 350 times higher than those of
Eritrea, Haiti, Indonesia and Pakistan.
There have also been some striking
fluctuations in newsprint consumption.
The United Kingdom which, between
1935 and 1939 was the world's most
hungry newsprint consumer had, by
1951, dropped to eighth place, coming
below Hawaii and the Bermudas. In
the four years prior to the Second
World War, "Mr. Britain" got through
26.4 kilogrammes a year, or 1.3 kilo¬
grammes more than "Mr. U.S.A." at
that time, but by 1951, he had been
reduced to 11.9 kilogrammes per year.
However, as this fall in British con¬
sumption was due to the severe post¬
war restrictions imposed by the
British Government on the size of
newspapers, the relative "loss of

appetite" can be considered as abnor¬
mal and unlikely to last indefinitely.
As a matter of fact, if we disregard
those countries in which the use of
paper has been restricted by govern¬
ment order, we see that the consump¬
tion per head was almost everywhere
higher in 1951 than it was before the
.war, despite the difficulties of obtain¬
ing supplies. This was true not only
of underdeveloped countries where the
press has expanded as illiteracy has
been reduced and education spread,
and where per capita income has
increased, but also of very highly
developed countries, such as the Uni¬
ted States, whose economic activity has
increased still further and which have
less difficulty in satisfying their needs.
The biggest appetite
THE world's appetite for paper is
thus growing with amazing
speed. In 1928, the -world con¬
sumed 6,130,000 tons of newsprint,
and in 1951 9,460,000 tons, which
means that, in spite of the economic
depression . which began in 1930 and
the effects of the second world war,
the consumption of paper went up, on
the average, by 145,000 tons a year
between 1928 and 1951. In the United
States of America which uses more
paper than any other country, the
consumption of newsprint increased
nearly fourfold between 1915 and 1951,
and doubled between 1933 and 1951.
In 1951, 120 countries each consumed
more than 50 tons of newsprint. These
120 countries were distributed as fol¬
lows: 26 countries in Africa, 22 in North
and Central America, 12 in. South
America, 26 in Asia and~33 in Europe,
besides the U.S.S.R.
How can this enormous demand
which is getting bigger from year to
year be met? While all the countries
in the world which are able to pur¬
chase enough to meet their needs are
consuming larger quantities of paper,
a relatively small number of countries
are producing this commodity. In
1951, only 36 countries manufactured
newsprint, 3- in North America, 4 in
South America, 7 in Asia, 20 in Europe,
besides the U.S.S.R., and 1 in the South
Sea Islands. The world production of
printing paper (other than newsprint)
and writing paper is much less central¬
ized than that of newsprint. It is
estimated that in 1951 42 countries or
territories each produced over 50 tons
of these two types of paper.
Threat to literacy
BY far and away the largest paper
producer is Canada. It has held
this position since 1928, and from
1932 to 1945 turned out a larger and
larger proportion of the total world
output. It was the only country whose
production in 1951 showed a consider¬
able increase over pre-war figures.
Between 1945 and 1951 this figure rose
from about 3,260,000 tons per year to
rather more than 5,000,000 tons an
enormous quantity representing 52.7 %
of the total world production.
In 1951 when Unesco began to alert
public opinion to the dangers of a
" DEVOUR BOOKS" this was the title of a recent
poster published by the National Syndicate of French
Editors showing the French actor Gérard Philipe
" devouring " a pile of books.
newsprint shortage, the situation was
already hampering the fight against
illiteracy in many countries because of
the difficulty of importing paper for
primary and secondary school text¬
books and notebooks. It had also forc¬
ed some newspapers to close down.
At that time, however, it was not
known how enormously the world
demand was going to increase. Will
the existing and planned production
resources be able to meet the ever-
increasing demand? The equipment of
large paper mills involves heavy capi¬
tal outlay and a relatively long study
of organization and building plans.
Of course the growth in production
and consumption noted over the past
25 years was an indication that a large
increase was to be expected in the
future. But other factors such as the
spread of education, the new literacy
campaigns undertaken in many coun¬
tries, the continual growth of the
world's population and the increase in
the real per capita income of its in¬
habitants had also to be considered.
Unesco therefore set out to make at
least an approximate* assessment of
man's future needs in paper. In co¬
operation with the Food and Agricul
ture Organization, the Economic Com¬
mission for Europe and the Economic
Commission for Latin America, Unesco
collected world information about the
development of the paper problem.
It also commissioned the Intelligence
Unit of "The Economist" which spe¬
cializes in economic investigations on
an international scale, to work out
estimates of the consumption of
printing and writing paper for each
country and territory. These indicate
that in 1965 the world will need some
65 % more newsprint than in 1951 and
that the rise in the demand for other
printing paper and writing paper will
also be considerable.
Here is a hunger which must be
appeased. Lack of paper to carry
information means lack of the aware¬
ness, the interest and the personal
responsibility that play such a large
role in sound citizenship. Lack of
paper for textbooks deprives children
and adult illiterates of the means of
learning, and limitation of education
penalizes all forms of progress. The
availability of paper for newspapers,
for books, for exchanges of facts and
ideas is therefore .a matter of world
concern and world action.

TEACHING SCIENCE WITH
ODDS AND ENDS
by
Daniel Behrman
INGENUITY AND A SOAP
PLANT are the main ingre¬
dients of these molecular models
Elvira Salazar is demonstrating
to two pupils in a Lima secon¬
dary school. The round pips
of the soap plant and a few
lengths of iron wire are all that
is needed for this introduction
to the atom. Miss Salazar is
only one of a team of six young
Peruvian chemistry teachers
working with Dr. Jose Martinez
Cros, a Spanish scientist sent
to Peru on a Unesco technical
assistance mission. Faced with
a shortage of teaching equip¬
ment and currency they de¬
cided to devise their own.
In a freshly-painted room in the Teresa Gonzalez de
Fanning School in Lima, Peru, Elvira Coloma, a fourth-
year student, was preparing her laboratory table for the
production of ammonia, the day's experiment in inorganic
chemistry, in this secondary school's programme.
First, she half-filled a test-tube with caustic soda solution,
measuring it by eyedropper from its flask, a syrup bottle.
She dropped three small lumps of ammonium carbonate into
the solution and plugged the test tube, using a cork with a
hole drilled through its centre. On top of this cork, she
fitted another test tube and then placed the whole affair on
a wooden ring stand, clamping the test tubes into position
with a clothes peg.
Elvira lit a match to her laboratory burner, an ink bottle
with a cotton wick, soaked in alcohol, rising through a hole
punched in the bottle's metal cap. As she slowly heated the
solution, bubbles of gas formed and rose into the upper tube.
She blew out the flame and removed this tube, stopping it
with her finger. She turned it right-side-up and filled it
' with water from a wine bottle with an eyedropper spout in
its cork. Then she sniffed. A strong smell of ammonia
came from the tube. To complete her test, she added a drop
of phenol-phthalein. When the colourless liquid came into
46
contact with the. ammonia, it turned pink. The experiment
was overhand Elvira began to write in her note-book.
Instead of watching a passive demonstration by a teacher
or simply memorizing a few passages from a chemistry test,
Elvira and her eighteen classmates had done the experiment
on their own. Their laboratory was an ordinary classroom
not even equipped with gas for Bunsen burners nor with
water outlets for each laboratory bench. But to do their
experiments Elvira and her friends had a kit of basic appa¬
ratus,- a "minimum laboratory" quite adequate enough to
conduct all of the organic and inorganic chemistry experi¬
ments in a secondary school science course. Its total cost
12 soles (60 cents or 4/-).
This "minimum laboratory" has been developed by Dr. Jose '
Martinez Cros, a Spanish scientist iwho took leave in 1951
from the Higher Council of Scientific Research in Madrid to
join a Unesco technical assistance mission working with
Peru's Ministry of Education on the training of science
teachers.
A nervously energetic man full of drive, Dr. Martinez Cros
built up this laboratory with the help of six young Peruvian
chemistry teachers. Beginning in 1952 they had studied
with him intensively to become a team of missionaries in

### 70029: Teaching science with odds and ends
modern science teaching. In their own,work, they conducted
experiments with precision apparatus supplied by the Peru¬
vian Government and installed in the Fanning School while
it was still the Pedagogical Institute of Lima (it became a
girl's secondary school in 1953 when Peru opened its new
Central Normal School).
Precision apparatus was essential for these refresher
courses, but it was expensive. And it was no answer to the
problem of introducing experiments by individual students in
the average school. Another method had to be found
otherwise chemistry would remain a dull textbook subject
or, at best, a demonstration course.
The Peruvian teachers and Dr. Martinez Cros decided to
follow a line already traced by science teachers on United
Nations technical assistance missions for Unesco in Indo¬
nesia, the Philippines and Thailand. In these countries,
school experiments in chemistry and physics had been
conducted using equipment built out of anything at hand
from electric light bulbs to discarded telephones. However,
Dr. Martinez Cros and the Peruvian teachers did their own
research. Dr. Martinez Cros had not brought any prefabri¬
cated ideas into Peru from Spain,- nor was there any magic
-Unesco formula for teaching science without apparatus.
In the "minimum laboratory" they built up in Lima, two
points have been stressed simplicity and precision. "Home¬
made apparatus is as good from a pedagogical viewpoint as
expensive equipment", Dr. Martinez Cros told me. "It has
one great advantage if the student is interested in che¬
mistry, he can duplicate it at home and make his own
experiments."
In terms of precision, the group decided that, while an
electric light bulb with its metal base filed off may serve as
a laboratory flask for primary school lessons, it was not
adequate for experiments at the secondary level. Therefore,
a set of 16 pyrex test tubes is among the three items in the
"'minimum laboratory" which must be purchased from a
chemical supply house, the other two being a glass funnel
and a few feet of glass tubing.
Using the versatile
electric light bulb
THE test-tubes go into a home-made wooden rack with
numbered corks to identify their contents. Another
rack is filled with syrup bottles containing the six
reagents needed for secondary school chemistry experi¬
ments ammonium hydroxide, caustic soda, sulphuric acid,
nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and phenol-phthalein. In the
interest of safety and economy, they are corked with
-eyedroppers. Students are never required to pour an acid.
The wooden ring-stand is a basic feature of the laboratory.
It consists of a flat (wooden base with a dowel nailed to the
bottom. A horizontal slat of wood is attached to the dowel
by clothes pegs, permitting it to ride up and down or to be
rotated. To this moveable slat are nailed two more clothes
pegs, one for holding test tubes vertically and the other
slanted for experiments in which the test tube must be kept
at an angle to protect the student against escaping acid.
The laboratory burner is a descendant of the ink bottle
burners used by Unesco technical assistance workers in Asia.
Then there are sundry accessories test-tube holders of
scrap metal salvaged from shipping crates, waste jars
consisting of wine bottles with their upper halves filed off,
pieces of window glass to handle products which might harm
a wooden table; a heating pan devised from a bottle cap
with a handle of bent wire soldered to it, small test tubes
made from glass aspirin tubes (better than the factory-made
article in some cases because their flat bottoms make it
easier to calculate volumes), boiling flasks made from the
bottom half of the versatile electric light bulb,' and a length
of -electric wire and two dry cells for carrying out experi¬
ments in electrolysis.
The key to the laboratory is the use of materials found in
Peruvian homes or available in shops at low cost. For
example, models of molecular structures are made with their
atoms represented by the hard round pips of a Peruvian soap
plant sold on the market for 3 cents a pound and linked
together by pieces of iron wire. , Molecular models made from
UNESCO COURIER N°« 8-9 1954
the soap plant are just as good for teaching purposes as
those built from imported kits which cost as much as $ 80.
Dr. Martinez Cros has gone much further in his laboratory
for training teachers. Although much of its equipment was
made in the Fanning school, it is at a much higher level
a prototype of a rational, low-cost laboratory for a normal
school. Each table is equipped with bases inserted flush into
its surface to take metal ring stands, merely lengths of pipe
threaded at one end to screw into the tables. Gas-operated
Bunsen burners are used here and they are prepared from
lengths of 17 mm pipe equipped with jets used by Peruvians
for their kerosene stoves. The tables are of wood, covered
with an anti-acid paint. Wood is cheaper than tile in Peru
and it reduces the breakage of glass equipment.
Scales from thread,
corks, wood and needles
MOST of this equipment is now manufactured in the
school by Felix Jacinto Bravo, a handy laboratory
assistant whom Dr. Martinez Cros trained in laboratory
glass blowing. While no attempt is made to produce com¬
plicated precision apparatus, the laboratory meets its own
needs in tubing and can handle repairs of broken equipment.
Training in glass blowing is included in the course which
Dr. Martinez Cros conducts for chemistry teachers.
A similar job of training teachers and improvising apparat¬
us was carried out next door to the chemical laboratory by
Dr. Raymond Zuckermann, a French physicist who complet¬
ed a Unesco mission in Peru in 1953. While Dr. Martinez
Cros was conducting experiments with his six chemists, Dr.
Zuckermann was working with six physics teachers.
There was one important difference in their tasks. Che¬
mistry experiments require only basic equipment, but physics
demonstrations need different apparatus for virtually every
principle to be proven. Dr. Zuckermann and his students were
confronted with experiments requiring equipment far too
costly for the budget of an average school. They decided to
go ahead with what they could find.
The results are in the physics laboratory of the' Fanning
school, a house of ingenious marvels. In this laboratory,
scales sensitive to 2 milligrams are produced out of thread,
corks, wood and needles (the scales are so sensitive that they
cannot be operated with a window or a door open in the
laboratory). An old Model T Ford magneto and a magnify¬
ing glass have been transformed into a mirror galvanometer.
A discarded phonograph motor plays a major part in an
apparatus for demonstrating the law of falling bodies.
One of the most fascinating of these instruments is the
laboratory's extensometer, a device for measuring the expan¬
sion of metals when heated, and contrived from wood, paper
and wires. When a current is passed into it to heat the metal
being tested, the expansion is indicated by a wooden needle
registering on a gauge inked out on paper. Exact measure¬
ment of this expansion requires exact knowledge of thu
temperature to which the metal has been heated. This is
determined with surprising simplicity: a piece of wire is
attached to the metal under test by a lump of sulphur and.
as soon as the sulphur melts, the experimenter knows how
hot he has heated the metal because he knows the melting
point of sulphur.
Outgoing fellows
incoming experts
IN this laboratory, as in the chemistry room of Dr. Mar¬
tinez Cros, delicate equipment is used only in working
with teachers. Here, too, simplified models have been
devised for use by individual students in physics classes.
Both of the laboratories are being moved out to the new
Central Normal School at Chosica, an ultra-modern structure
basking in year-round sunshine.
In Peru the 25 miles from Lima to Chosica equal the cli¬
matic difference between New York and Miami in the United
States or Paris and the Riviera in France. Lima has a cool
climate with overcast skies, the gift of the Humboldt Current

(Continued)
on the shores of the Pacific. Chosica,
inland in the valley of the Rio Rimac
never sees a cloud.
The new normal school now has an
enrolment of 280 future teachers.
Besides developing the science la¬
boratories, technical assistance has
been able to play a part in the school
by providing Unesco fellowships for
two vocational education teachers to
study at the University of Puerto
Rico. The director of the school'f
audio-visual section, Manuel Vera,
also studied for a year at the Uni¬
versity of Wisconsin in the United
States under a technical assistance
fellowship and he is introducing
films, film strips, records, charts and
other teaching aids in the normal
school's laboratory classes.
This method of complementing
incoming international technical as¬
sistance workers with outgoing Peru¬
vian fellows has the unqualified appro¬
val of such Peruvian education leaders
as Carlos Teixeira, the country's direc¬
tor of technical education, who be¬
lieves that "the fellow is as important
to Peru as the expert."
Mr. Teixeira is at the head of
a mushrooming technical education
system which is placing heavy de¬
mands on Peru's available supply of
teachers of science and trade. From
1948 to 1952, the number of students
attending industrial, agricultural and
commercial schools jumped from 9,500 to 20,000. The
vocational training department in the Central Normal
School is the first of its kind set up in Peru specifically to
train teachers of vocational education to staff the classrooms
which are being built throughout the country.
These teachers are badly needed. Early in 1954 among
those in Peru's 34 vocational schools, there were only 44 who
had graduated from a normal school, although Mr. Teixeira
hoped to double their number before the end of the year.
"We are giving technical school teachers the same privileges
THE CHILDREN'S HOUR on this record player is part of the programme of the audio-visual section
at Peru's new Central Normal School at Chosica, 25 miles from Lima. Manuel Vera, who studied
for one year at the University of Wisconsin in the United States under a Unesco technical assistance
fellowship, is now director of this section of the school.
and the same salaries as academic teachers", he explained.
"This is a fight to dignify technical education so that we
can attract good teachers and it is going on elsewhere in
the world as well as in Peru."
"Economic progress brings up the old question of the
chicken and the egg", Mr. Teixeira told me. "Should a coun¬
try train skilled workers first or wait until its industries are
desperately short of labour? We are now going ahead with
the training of workers and that is why we need more and
better teachers. We believe that Peru will not stand still."
EVERY EXPERIMENT required in a secondary
school chemistry course can be performed with
this "minimum laboratory" put together by
Dr. Martinez Cros, which can be used even in
rooms without water or gas facilities. Here,
two pupils are conducting an experiment in
the production of ammonia.
A BREATH OF AIR is enough to disturb
these scales, sensitive to two milligrams though
they consist of wood, corks, needles and string.
Here, Carmen Cassano, a member of the team
of physics teachers chosen to work with the
Unesco mission, is seen here testing a scale at
the end of her "production line".
EXPANSION OF METALS when heated by
an electric current can be measured with this
home-made "extensometer" operated by Mesias
Huannga, another member of the team of
physics teachers. The paper tube around the
wire prevents it from being cooled by air cur¬
rents during the experiment.

B,ÍETTER RURAL EDU¬
CATION: Most people in the
world today live on crops they
grow themselves and spend their
lives in rural villages or isola¬
ted farms. Their educational
problems are more difficult and
imperative than those of city
dwellers. To study these spe¬
cial problems and to discuss
ways of solving them, delegates
from thirty countries met re¬
cently in Denmark at an inter¬
national seminar organized by
Unesco on adult education in
rural areas.
* PROTECTING NATURE:
As the world's population in¬
creases by 25,000,000 every
year, man must be taught
how to make the best use of
nature's resources on which
he is completely dependent.
This is the aim of the Inter¬
national Union for the Pro¬
tection of Nature founded in
1948 under the sponsorship
of Unesco. At its fourth
annual assembly held re¬
cently in Copenhagen, the
Union discussed methods and
means of publicity which
should be used to enlist pub¬
lic aid in nature protection
work. Two other subjects giv¬
en special attention were the
protection of Arctic animals
and the effect of modern
insecticides on mammals,
birds and insects. (See
Unesco Courier N°. 4/5,.-1954,
for an article on the pro¬
tection of nature).
M. HE WORLTJ WARMS
UP: There is definite evidence
that the Northern Hemisphere
is becoming warmer, according
to M. Jean-René Rivet, deputy
Secretary-General of the World
Meteorological Organi¬
zation. M. Rivet said that as
a result of this, improved agri¬
culture was now possible in
northern latitudes of Scandina¬

Unesco has lost a leading
member of its staff through
the death of Mr. William
Hodson, Head of the Bureau
of Programme and Budget.
Mr. Hodson was one of 28
passengers killed in an airliner
crash near Shannon, Ireland,
on September 5. An Ame¬
rican citizen, Mr. Hodson was
born in Minneapolis on March
25, 1921. Educated at Har¬
vard he later entered govern¬
ment service in Washington.
He joined Unesco in March,
1947, as Executive Assistant

ral. In March 1951 he was
appointed to the post he held
at the time of his death.

grown in recorded history.
(See Unesco Courier N° 2, 1954,
for an article on the world's
warmer weather: "It Was Cold¬
er When We Were Younger. ")
* FOOD AND PEOPLE:
In 1953 and again this year
world food production man¬
aged to stay ahead of popu¬
lation increases, reports the
Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization (FAO). Agricul¬
ture production has risen
by nearly three per cent a
year over the last four years,
while the estimated popula¬
tion increase has been about
one and one-half per cent
each year. But even though
the total world food output
may now be adequate, un¬
even distribution makes for
surpluses in some areas and
great shortages in others.
JL OLL FOR PARENTS :
The City of Denver, in the Uni¬
ted States, finds out what citi¬
zens think about its school sys-s
tem by taking a public opinion
poll. The first, taken in 1950,
showed that 49 per cent of the
people felt the school system was
doing a "good job1'. By last
year's poll this approval had
risen to 59 per cent.
RURAL RADIO LINKS :
To overcome one of its
biggest development problems
lack of communications
both between its east and
west territories and between
its isolated villages Pakistan
is making great efforts to
extend its radio links. New
broadcasting and relay sta¬
tions are being built and ra¬
dio is now being used in
conjunction with a nation¬
wide campaign to educate
adults in remote villages. At
present 600 community ra¬
dios are being distributed in
villages around the relay
transmitting stations of Chit-
tagong and Rajshahi in
East Pakistan. The Pakis¬
tan Government has pur¬
chased 3,000 for distribution
to rural areas. A new plan
for training telecommunica¬
tions personnel is also under
way in Pakistan. Besides a
Central Training Centre al¬
ready in operation, three re¬
gional schools will be set up
at Karachi, Dacca and
Lahore to train technicians.
The Lahore school will be
opened at the end of the
year, and the Dacca and
Karachi establishments may
start working early in 1955.

International stu¬
dent CENTRE : The first
international student centre in
Egypt has been set up with
prefabricated units provided by
the World University Service,
on the Cairo University grounds
at Giza. The Universities of
Cairo and Heliopolis have given
money towards its construction
and provided furniture. The
centre will form a social meeting
place for students of all nation¬
alities at Cairo's various uni¬
versities, and will give conva¬
lescent students a chance to
regain their health under satis¬
factory conditions.
SPEEDIER SCIENCE
SHIPMENTS : The recently
announced Unesco scheme to
aid the international ex¬
change of delicate scientific
measuring instruments
among science laboratories
has already received support
from thirty-four member
states. Seventy scientific la¬
boratories have been named
as participants. Under the
plan, measuring instruments
would be assured safe and
speedy transit when being
shipped from one country to
another. Each would carry
a distinctive Unesco symbol
enabling customs clearance
to be made at the sending or
receiving laboratory rather
than in customs sheds, thus
avoiding damage or delay.
The plan is part of Unesco's
general programme for the
free flow of information.
'LACKBOARDS IN DIS¬
FAVOUR : A "development
group" .studying school building
for the British Ministry of Edu¬
cation has recommended that
because of its effect on class¬
room colour schemes, the tra¬
ditional blackboard should be
replaced by a " chalkboard " in
such colours as red, brown,
green or grey. Stressing the
importance of a school build¬
ing's colour scheme, the group
considered it should give a
positive rather than a neutral
effect.
w<ORLD FACTS : More
than 230,000,000 radio sets are in
use throughout the world today,
which means there are 95 for
every 1,000 inhabitants. The
United States has about one
half of these radios, of which
some 25,000,000 are fitted in au¬
tomobiles. These items of in¬
formation are given in the sec¬
ond edition of " Basic Facts
and Figures", a publication in
which Unesco has collected
world-wide information on illi¬
teracy, education, libraries, mu¬
seums, books, newspapers, news¬
print, film, radio and television.
The booklet also reveals that by
September 1953 twenty countries
were broadcasting regular tele¬
vision programmes. The United
States had the largest number
of TV receivers 25,100,000
and the United Kingdom had
2,900,000 with an increase at the
rate of about 70 per cent a year.
SCHOOLS AROUND THE
WORLD : Dutch boys and
girls are hearing what school
is like for young people all
around the world / rom
Alaska to Indonesia and
from Japan to Liberia
through a series of special
programmes being broadcast
by a Dutch radio corporation
(VARA). Material for the
programmes was obtained by
the Unesco Centrum of Ne-
derland from Unesco Natio¬
nal Commissions in 13 coun¬
tries.
* PAPER PROBLEM : The
problems of establishing new
pulp and paper industries
will be discussed in detail at
two international conferen¬
ces to be sponsored by the
Food and Agriculture Organ¬
ization later this year. In
October the problems of
paper production in Latin
America are to be discussed
at a meeting in Buenos Aires.
In December the question of
pulp production will be an
important item on the
agenda of the Fourth World
Forestry Congress at Dehra
Dun, in India. (See page 44
for article on the world's
growing hunger for paper) .
s«» CIENCE GOES ON
TOUR : Since 1950 four science
exhibitions prepared by Unesco
have been seen by over 1,200,000
people in 26 countries. Making
use of graphic displays, photo¬
graphs and demonstrations that
could be operated by the
visitors, the exhibits have over¬
come language barriers. They
have helped people to under¬
stand the world they live in and
have brought home simple, vital
facts. After people have looked
through a microscope at a drop
of pond water, and have seen a
million tiny organisms squirming
and darting about, for instance,
they are ready to believe doctors
who warn that such water is
dangerous to drink. Exhibits
have covered physics and astro¬
nomy, the human senses, the
use of synthetic materials in
modern life and the instruments
we use to study the universe,
from atoms to stars.
UNESCO ON TV : For the
last two years, Professor Luis
Amador Sanchez, of Sao
Paulo University, Brazil, has
presented a weekly television
show on Unesco's work over
Sao Paulo's television sta¬
tion. Senor Amador Sanchez
illustrates his telecasts with
views of leading historic
monuments and universities.
He also shows Unesco's tech¬
nical assistance work, as well
as ballet, theatre and music
performances. On an aver¬
age, three hundred thousand
people in the Sao Paulo
region are watching this
Unesco show on their sets
each week.
M,MUSEUMS IN THE ME¬
TRO : People waiting for un¬
derground trains at the Opera
Station in Paris can see a novel
and fascinating exhibition as¬
sembled by the French Ministry
of Education. Artistically
arranged window panels show
samples of the treasures con¬
tained in various French na¬
tional museums in and around
Pans. Beautiful oriental por¬
celain suggests the wonders of
Asiatic art on display at the
Guimet museum. Quaint house¬
hold utensils of bygone days
evoke the curiosities at the
Museum of Decorative Arts.
The exhibition is designed to
introduce the public to lesser-
known Paris collections as well
as to famous museums like the
Louvre.

FLYING CLASSROOMS:
Schoolchildren in Birming¬
ham, England, now learn
geography in flying class¬
rooms. Armed with maps
and accompanied by a tea¬
cher, groups of them travel
to London three times week¬
ly on the regular airline
flights. Aided by sheets
from the pilot's log they can
identify landmarks and cities
along the route during their
aerial geography lesson.
A,ILL ABOUT BRAILLE :
Unesco has just published
"World Braille Usage", a basic
reference work which recounts
the history of Braille and
presents a survey of the efforts
made towards Braille unifica¬
tion. The author of the book
is Sir Clutha Mackenzie, who
was Unesco's consultant between
1949 and the end of 1951. He
is Chairman of the World
Braille Council. In a foreword
to "Braille World Usage", Helen
Keller writes that in this book
"a magnificent monument has
been raised to Louis Braille,
from whose life-dream has been
wrought the mental and spiri¬
tual emancipation of the blind
in every land."
TUITION BY TAPE:
Groups of students at Cons-
tantine (Algeria) are now
following examination cour¬
ses at Algiers University by
tape recordings. These re¬
cordings of the courses of
the faculty of letters in pre¬
paration for the first degree,
secondary teacher's certifi¬
cate and the fellowship exa¬
mination for teachers of Eng¬
lish are regularly made and
sent each week to the Cons-
tantine students.
JuATIN AMERICAN CLAS¬
SICS: A historical novel Ma¬
nuel de Jesús Galváns The
Cross and the Sword has
been chosen by the Indiana
University Press, in the United
States, as the first of a series of
Latin American classics to be
published under the sponsorship
of Unesco and the Organization
of American States. The setting
of the novel, translated by the
English author and translator,
Robert Graves, is in the West
Indies shortly after Columbus's
voyages. One of the central cha¬
racters is a famous historical
figure, the Spanish missionary
Bartolomé de Las Casas who
fought to protect the Indians
from the violence of ruthless
Spanish explorers and soldiers.
Manuel de Jesús Galván, jour¬
nalist, diplomat and educator,
was born in Santo Domingo in
1834 and died in 1910. The
Cross and the Sword is the first
publication in English of his on¬
ly novel, originally issued in
1879 as gnriquillo.
Through the Latin American
Classics Series, the Indiana Uni¬
versity Press hopes to introduce
and spread knowledge of repre¬
sentative works of Latin Ameri¬
can literature and thought
among English-speaking people
in the interest of better inter¬
national understanding. Other
Latin American classics plan¬
ned in the series are Selected
Writings of José Marti, trans¬
lated by C.A. Rossner; and An¬
thology of Mexican Poetry
translated by Samuel Beckett;
The Last Days of the Colonial
Era in Upper Peru by Gabriel
René Moreno; Royal Commen¬
taries of the Incas by El Inca
Garcilaso de la Vega; Travel*
by the Argentine writer and pat¬
riot, Domingo Faustino Sar-
mentio; The Boarding School
(O Ateneu) by Raul Pompeia and
a number of anthologies of the
social and political thought of
Latin America.
SOUTH SEA STUDENTS:
Every year since 1945 some
15 young South Sea Island¬
ers have won scholarships
from their homes in the Pa¬
cific to study at New Zea-
Council for Education announc¬
ed this decision following the
visit to Chile of Dr. Fernando
Romero, sent to Latin America
by Unesco to survey adult edu¬
cation programmes. The Com¬
mittee, composed of the Rector
of the Technical University of
Federico Santa Marie, a repre¬
sentative of factory management
and one for the labour unions,
is to prepare a comprehensive
educational plan for adults.
*WORKSHOP FORPEACE :
The daily work of the United
Nations Headquarters in New
York provides the theme for

ASSSISTANT DIRECTOR-GENERAL
OF UNESCO APPOINTED
M. René Maheu, of France,
has been appointed Assistant
Director-General of Unesco.
The appointment was made in
July 1954 by Dr. Luther Evans,
Unesco's Director-General.
M. Maheu was born in 1905,
at St. Gaudens, France. He
graduated from the Ecole Nor¬
male Supérieure and taught '
philosophy at the University of
Cologne (1931-33), at the
French Institute in the United
Kingdom (1933-39) and at the
Franco-Moslem College at
Moulay Idriss, Fez (1940-42).
As a member of the civil cabi¬
net of the Resident General of

1 IGHTING DISEASE :
Successful attacks on typhùà,
yaws, malaria and other dis¬
eases by co-operating teams of
workers from the United Na¬
tions Children's Fund, the World
Health Organization and gov¬
ernments have been reported
recently. Last winter, teams of
Afghan health workers dusted
homes, mosques, public baths
and horse-drawn hacks in Kabul
with DDT. Not one case of
typhus was reported there this
spring. Only a few years ago
louseborne typhus was epidemic
in the area. In Haiti, 35,000 to
55,000 persons afflicted by yaws
were treated monthly with peni¬
cillin. Almost 100,000 incapaci¬
tated persons have returned to
work.
WORLD'S NEEDY CHIL¬
DREN: In 1953, the United
Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) aided some
20,000,000 children and ex
pectant or nursing mothers
in some eighty countries.
This year, UNICEF'S goal is
even higher. . .to reach
more than 25,000,000 children
and mothers through mass
health campaigns and long-
range nutrition and maternal
and child welfare program¬
mes. Of the world's 900 mil¬
lion children, two-thirds are
still without adequate food,
clothing, shelter, sanitation
or minimum medical protec¬
tion.
^RIPPLED CHILDREN :
Gifts from voluntary groups in
many countries have enabled
the Children's Orthopaedic Hos¬
pital in Bombay to open an
Occupational Therapy Depart¬
ment and to equip other de¬
partments of the hospital with
much - needed material. The
hospital's needs were made
known through Unesco's Gift
Coupon scheme, a voluntary aid
plan through which a sort of
international money order can
be sent as a gift to educational,
scientific or cultural institu¬
tions in other countries. Through
the Unesco coupons it received,
the Bombay hospital is now
able to provide more effective
treatment to hundreds of Indian
crippled children.
KOREAN TRAINING
CENTRE: Unesco has sent
Mr. Howard Hayden, a Bri¬
tish educational expert, to
Korea, where he is to be Di¬
rector of a Fundamental
Education Training and Re¬
search dentre. This Centre
is a joint enterprise to be
started by the United Nations
Korean Relief Administra¬
tion and Unesco. It will train
teachers in fundamental
education techniques, which
would be applied' in the edu¬
cational campaigns in Korea.
Mr. Hayden goes to Korea
with a wide knowledge of
educational problems in the
Pacific, as well as British co¬
lonial territories. For the last
year, he was Director of
Education in Trinidad, and
from 1946 to 1953 he held the
same position at Fiji.
JUlVING AND LEARN¬
ING: A second international
group of young men and women
have begun training as funda¬
mental education experts in an
eight months' course sponsored
by Unesco at Mysore, India. A
similar Unesco study course
ended there recently, graduating
seventeen students to work as
experts in the technical assis¬
tance programmes of the United
Nations and the. Specialized
Agencies. The students who
came from nine countries learn¬
ed techniques, which ranged
from how to make educational
films and other teaching mate¬
rials, to training local teachers
for adult literacy campaigns.
Like the first group, the second
will live and work m the villages
of Mysore, learning by practical
experience to apply the teaching
techniques developed by the
Mysore State Adult Education
Council. This organization has
taught 300,000 illiterates to read
in the past twelve- years.

THE BIGGEST SHOW IN THE UNIVERSE. - This photo
of the June 30 eclipse of the sun was taken in Minneapolis
in the United States, but scientists all the way from
Nebraska to Jodhpur in India had their instruments
trained on the blacked-out sun. None of them knew
what might come out of their few minutes of observation
anything could. Observations taken during the
eclipse of 1919 helped .substantiate Einstein's theory of
relativityand led to the splitting of the atom. See
"In the Dark of the Sun" on page 40. (Photo by Roy
Swan, Copyright Minneapolis Star).
