The plight of the 275 million people living in
the world's poorest and economically
weakest countries is the theme of this Issue
of the Unesco Courier. It was also the sub¬
ject of a United Nations Conference held at
Unesco's Paris headquarters from 1 to 14
September, 1981. Addressing the Con¬
ference, United Nations Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim declared: "In the current
world economic crisis, it is the least
developed countries which are particularly
vulnerable... For the accelerated growth of
the developing countries and particularly the
least developed amongst them, a much
stronger political will and a sense of shared
responsibility on the part of the entire inter¬
national community is a prime necessity...
Given determination, political vision and in¬
ternational co-operation, it is certainly possi¬
ble to render significant assistance to these
countries in finding solutions to their
economic problems. They must be given the
means to break out of the vicious trap of
poverty and deprivation."

The poverty trap
The plight of the
Least Developed Countries
by Henri Lopès
and
Huynh Cao Tri
T
'HE concept of LDCs (Least Developed
Countries) is relatively new. Long
regarded with suspicion by the other
developing countries, it originated among
the industrialized nations who supported a
selective system of preferences graduated
according to product and country, in op¬
position to the Third World's proposal to set
up a single system of trade preferences.
Three criteria were finally adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly in
November 1971 for defining the LDCs:
a very low level of per capita in¬
come $200 per person and per year
in 1979 as against an average of $700 in the
developing countries taken as a whole and
$8,000 in market economy industrialized
countries;
a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
which the industrial sector's contribution is
10 % or lessagainst 19 % in the develop¬
ing countries as a whole;
a literacy rate of 20 % or less.
There were originally 25 LDCs, but the of¬
ficial list now includes the following
31 States: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Benin,
Bhutan, Botswana, Burundi, Cape Verde,
Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros,
Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-
Bissau, Haiti, Lao People's Democratic
Republic, Lesotho, Malawi, Maldives, Mali,
Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Samoa, Somalia,
Sudan, Uganda, United Republic of Tan¬
zania, Upper Volta, Yemen Arab Republic,
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
The largest number (twenty-one) of these
countries are on the African continent; eight
belong to the Asian region and one each to
the Caribbean (Haiti) and to Oceania
(Samoa). Their combined population is
275 million or about 13 % of the total
population of the developing countries
(China not included).
Though the LDCs differ widely in size of
population, political regime and geographic
situation, they all share a number of com¬
mon features:
a high percentage of their population
depend for their livelihood on agriculture,
usually carried out at subsistence level, and,
at best, integrated to only a slight degree in¬
to the modern monetary system. They all
have poor communications systems;
industrial production in the LDCs is
usually very small both in absolute terms
and in percentage. Most of them have such
a tiny economic growth rate that their per
capita income often tends to decrease in¬
stead of rising;
for various reasons the LDCs generally
have been unable to create an export sector
which would enable them to finance their
import needs. And where exports do exist
they are usually limited to two or three basic
products;
natural resources vary from country to
country, but in most cases even where
mineral resources have been discovered
they are not yet being exploited. Many LDCs
in fact do have large mineral and hydroelec¬
tric resources but their development calls for
concerted and combined efforts. In others,
these resources are scarce or non-existent
and the situation can only be improved by
making better use of the country's human
resources;
all these countries, however, are very
short of trained personnel capable of plan¬
ning, organizing and administering the
development process, as is shown by their
very low literacy rates and figures of school .
and university enrolments; f
HENRI LOPES, former prime minister of the
Congo, is at present consultant to the Director-
General of Unesco concerned with the Organiza¬
tion's Medium-Term Plan.
HUYNH CAO TBI, of China, is senior pro¬
gramme specialist in Unesco's Division for the
Study of Development. He is the author of many
publications on development problems.

r the people of the LDCs suffer from
malnutrition; they lack clean drinking water,
as well as basic health and education ser¬
vices. The world's highest birth and death
rates are to be found in these countries. As
the president of the World Bank put it,
"their populations live in a state of absolute
poverty";
domestic savings in the LDCs are
negligible and there is a very low level of
investment;
most of them rely largely on interna¬
tional aid, which covers a considerable part
of their imports. Worse still, the gap bet¬
ween these countries and the rest of the
developing world is growing, as is the gap
between the latter and the industrialized
world.
This dire situation, which has been called
"the scandal of the century", has often pro¬
moted generous gestures: in very critical cir¬
cumstances or in times of natural disaster
rescue operations organized by the interna¬
tional community have saved human lives.
While such efforts should not be minimized,
it must be stressed that what the LDCs need
is not a temporary remedy for their ills, but a
cure, or, better still, the means to cure
themselves.
For they hold the key to their own salva¬
tion and should be prepared to mobilize their
peoples resolutely in a long-term effort,
using strategies inspired by the lessons of
the first two United Nations Development
Decades.
The first decade sought to achieve social
progress through improved living conditions
and a greater degree of freedom. But social
progress was seen merely as a fall-out from
economic growth, estimated at 5 % of
Gross National Product (GNP), and was to
be achieved by increasing industrial and
agricultural production.
The second development decade cor¬
rected the initial strategy by giving greater
importance to social aims. It stressed the
need for reforms in domestic structures and
recommended limiting the privileges of the
elite in poor countries, in particular through
a more equitable distribution of national
income.
In each case, development was based on
existing (liberal or planned economy)
models, but in order to use these models ef¬
fectively the developing countries, especially
the LDCs, first had to make up for years of
backwardness. It is clear today that gross in¬
equalities are hidden behind the apparently
satisfactory global results of the seventies.
The 38 low-income countries classified by
the World Bank as "low-income developing
countries" achieved an annual economic
growth of only 3.9 % during the sixties, and
of 3.6 % during the 1970-1978 period. Dur¬
ing the latter period there was even a
decrease in gross domestic product in some
of these countries. Over the whole period
1960-1978, GNP growth in the low-income
group averaged 1 .6 % annually, and it fell in
seven countries.
In the past few years it has become clear
to the international community that
development cannot be equated with
reproducing systematically the dominant
foreign production and consumer models,
or even with fulfilling economic objectives
when these have no cultural content. The
concept of "endogenous development"
with its three components the cultural
dimension, autonomy and popular participa¬
tion in development is now universally
recognized. This strategy aims at
substituting a new international economic
order based on equity and solidarity for in¬
terdependence based on inequality.
This kind of development satisfies several
fundamental needs including: harmonious
social relations, brought about within the
community through justice and social con¬
cord and between nations by greater equity
in the distribution of benefits; a balance bet¬
ween man and nature in the environment
and habitat; and more democratic and
humane methods of development achieved
through broader participation of groups and
individuals at all stages of the planning pro¬
cess. (Participation is seen not only as a
means of achieving development but also as
responding to a basic human need, a form
of self-education in civic and social matters
and a fundamental human right.) The aim,
in other words, is to achieve global,
multidimensional and integrated develop¬
ment. And this unified approach involves
not only active participation of all citizens
both as agents and beneficiaries of develop¬
ment, but the use of multidisciplinary
methods of analysis.
Meeting the economic and cultural
demands of an endogenous, man-based
development strategy should enable each
country to acquire optimum control over all
development operations at national level.
But experience also proves that a State
can meet all the social, human and political
preconditions of endogenous development,
it can work out a carefully prepared plan and
still not achieve adequate progress in
development or even economic growth. In¬
evitably there comes a time when the pro¬
blem of financing development arises and it
then becomes clear that this problem cannot
be solved simply by distributing existing
capital in a more equitable way. What is
even more serious is that there seems to be
no prospect of drawing on national savings
in the LDCs, at least so long as they keep
their present structures.
The investment needs of these countries
are considerable and always exceed a
tolerable percentage of their gross national
product. According to the World Health
Organization, even if the LDCs were to in¬
crease their health spending by 10 % an¬
nually, their investments in this sector in the
year 2000 would amount to only about 5 %
of the sums now being spent in most in¬
dustrialized countries. Third World industry,
according to another study, will require $25
to $35 billion per year in foreign capital dur¬
ing the coming decade; it is now receiving
less than $10 billion annually.
Despite the many resolutions passed
unanimously both by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) and by the U.N. General
Assembly, the industrialized countries are
still a long way from the target of allotting
0.70 % of their GNP to official development
aid. In the member States of OECD (the
Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development), the average rate is only
0.08 %; and it is 0.01 % in planned
economy industrialized countries, which do
not consider themselves responsible for the
plight of the developing world. OPEC
member countries, on the other hand, are
already devoting 0.20 % of their GNP to of¬
ficial development aid. As to China, which is
a developing country and has recently been
classified as a group on its own, it has
stressed that its aid "cannot be compared to
that of the developed countries", but must
be considered as a form of economic and
technical co-operation between developing
nations.
9
During the United Nations Conference on
the Least Developed Countries held in Paris
from 1 to 14 September 1981, many delega¬
tions emphasized that what they expected
from the industrialized nations should not be
seen as an act of charity but rather as a
gesture of solidarity and even as enlightened
mutual interest. They stressed that the
plight of the developing countries in general
and of the LDCs in particular was not due to
fate or to any intrinsic incapacity, but was
the consequence of an historical relationship
of domination and exploitation based on
force.
It is true that aid received from the in¬
dustrialized world enables the developing
countries to increase their exports. But their
needs are such that they inevitably use any
additional income that this brings in to buy
essential goods from the developed coun¬
tries. The latter therefore stand to gain from
any increase in the poor countries' resources
produced by an expansion in their exports.
The prolonged recession of the mid-
seventies has highlighted the important role
played by Third World markets in compen¬
sating for the fall in demand in the in¬
dustrialized countries and in limiting
unemployment in these countries. Between
1950 and 1980, overall exports to the
developing world from OECD member
states made it possible to create thirty
million jobs in the industrialized world.
While the developing countries showed
their solidarity with the LDCs during the
Paris conference and supported all their
claims, they also stressed that the plight of
the LDCs is only one aspect of the problems
facing the developing world as a whole and
that commitments made to help these coun¬
tries should not be used as an excuse for
reducing official aid to the rest of the Third
World or allowing it to stagnate at its pre¬
sent level. This was by no means a
superfluous precaution, for some of the in¬
dustrialized countries are inclined to use the
present world recession as an excuse for
evading their duty of international solidarity.
It is extremely important that the interna- .
tional community should realize that the f

only true and lasting form of development is
global, planetary development. The aim of
the Paris conference was to urge the donor
countries to go beyond declarations of in¬
tent and make firm, concrete commitments
leading to a new programme of action for
the 1980s.
In spite of the lessons of the first two
development decades, the discussions tend¬
ed to be dominated by short-term economic
problems at the expense of vital cultural and
social issues. And here Unesco's represen¬
tatives drew attention to the part the
Organization could play in the war against
poverty and injustice.
Unesco is prepared to put its experience
in education and literacy training at the
disposal of any country that asks for it.
Education and literacy can provide the
peoples of the LDCs with the tools they
need for the task of national construction.
Both can play a decisive role in improving
nutrition and health. This calls for a restruc¬
turing of educational systems, curricula and
methods so as to take proper account of the
fundamental objectives of development and
the national culture. Too many schemes
have failed because they neglected the
cultural identity of the societies involved.
Unesco also has a great deal of experience
in communication, another field vital for
development; it provides the means of
transmitting technical knowledge, influenc¬
ing attitudes and behaviour and making the
public aware of the many and varied kinds of
effort that national development involves.
Unesco's Social Sciences sector can help
to find solutions to many grave problems
facing the developing countries. The
phenomenon of poverty, for example, is
linked to a variety of factors economic,

Of all the developing countries,
the LDCs (Least Developed
Countries) are the poorest, the
weakest economically and the
most hampered by structural
difficulties. According to the
United Nations, the expression
"least developed countries"
means the weakest in terms of
three main economic and social
criteria: low income per capita
Gross Domestic Product of $200
or less (in 1979 the annual per
capita GDP in these countries
averaged $183 as compared with
$674 for all developing countries
and $8,217 for market economy
countries); low literacy rate20
per cent or less; and low share
of manufacturing in total
output 10 per cent or less
(often it is less than 4 or 5 per
cent). These three criteria are
symbolized by: above, a coin

social, cultural and human. Analysis of the
interaction between production factors and
social relations, and between technical pro¬
gress and cultural values, the study of the
socio-cultural conditions in which the
transfer of science and technology takes
place, and of the way in which the different
sectors of development (production, ex¬
change, distribution and socio-cultural ac¬
tivities) function and influence one
another all this offers the social sciences a
vast field for research and -reflection.
Over and above the international com¬
munity's concern for the immediate plight of
the Least Developed Countries, what is real¬
ly at stake is how to achieve human solidari¬
ty on a global scale in an increasingly in¬
terdependent world. As Unesco's Director
General, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, has put
it: "Never has the world been so closely knit;
but never has its diversity been so
striking...; the world emerges as a whole all
of whose parts are interrelated." This idea
should serve as a basis for the new interna¬
tional economic order and later perhaps for
a new and more humane world order which
we hope to build.

### 47564: The Poorest countries of an oil-rich region

DESPITE the prosperity brought about
by the recent increase in oil prices,
the income of most people living in
States that are members of the Economic
Commission for Western Asia (ECWA) is
not much higher than the average income in
developing countries taken as a whole. In
fact, about half the population of the
Western Asian region lives in countries that
are not oil producers. The two least
developed countriesThe Democratic
Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab
Republic which account for 15 per cent of
the region's population and form a
geographically homogeneous sub-region,
are among the poorest in the world.
The extent of poverty and underdevelop¬
ment in these two countries cannot be fully
gauged from their per capita Gross National
Product, which is only one of several criteria
used to identify the Least Developed Coun¬
tries. Other indicators in fact show a far
worse situation. Life expectancy in the two
Yemens is among the lowest in the world,
even for that part of the population with an
adequate calorie intake and access to clean
water supplies. The literacy rate and the
number of doctors are also among the
lowest in the world, while, not unnaturally,
the number of cases of illness is among the
highest. As for the social services and
means of transport, they are below accep¬
table standards.
The economic structure of both countries
is decrepit. Agriculture, their chief activity,
is crippled by lack of investment, shortage L

> of water, the deterioration of the environ¬
ment and the emigration of workers.
Industry is almost non-existent and the
amount of income and number of jobs it
provides are insignificant. Efforts to pro¬
mote industrialization are hampered by lack
of capital and skills, as well as by the high
cost of raw materials, the absence of in¬
frastructures and appropriate technologies
and a very restricted market. The two coun¬
tries therefore depend to a great extent on
imports, particularly of food and other
essential goods. Exports, which barely exist,
cover only 5 per cent of imports.
The Least Developed Countries of the
ECWA region are also poor in natural
resources. Clearly, this is a grave handicap
to development, especially in view of the
overall rise in the price of raw materials, par¬
ticularly oil. But the two Yemens are in
desperate need of energy resources to com¬
pensate for the shortage of qualified man¬
power. This is now more acute than ever
because of the number of skilled workers
who have emigrated over the last few years.
One of the gravest obstacles to the
development of the poorest countries in the
ECWA region is geographical, for the nature
of the terrain desert or sparsely cultivated
areas with a scattered population makes
the provision of infrastructures a highly
costly operation.
Despite these handicaps, the two least
privileged countries of ECWA have made
laudable efforts to develop their economies.
Though they have chosen different paths to
development, they share common aims:
economic growth, a fairer distribution of
wealth and a higher standard of living. To
achieve these aims both have embarked on
ambitious development schemes which
should help to accelerate the low GNP per
capita growth rate of the 1960s and 1970s.
Neither of the two countries has sufficient
resources of its own to finance the increased
expenditure required by development. The
Arab Republic of Yemen's Second Five-Year
Plan for the period 1982-1986 envisages an
expenditure of 10 to 15 billion dollars. It is
calculated, however, that only 2.9 billion can
be expected from national resources and
outside contributions. In the Democratic
Republic of Yemen, the investment needed
in the 1980s is estimated at 3.77 billion
dollars. Despite increased efforts to muster
national savings, a large part of the invest-
12
ment needed nearly one-thirdwill have
to be financed by outside aid. This foreign
aid has been estimated at a billion dollars for
the present five-year plan, rising to 1.27
billion during the second half of the decade.
The gap between expenditure and na¬
tional resources would be even greater if the
prosperity of the neighbouring Gulf States
did not spill over to some extent into the two
Yemens through the funds sent home by
emigrant Yemeni workers. Since 1973, the
beginning of an era of rapid growth for the
oil-producing countries of the region, these
transfers, which amount at present to 2
billion dollars for the Yemen sub-region,
have provided considerable finance both for
imports and for development expenditure.
Such transfers, however, are not likely to
continue at the same rate as in the past, for
the Yemeni workers are gradually being
replaced by more highly-qualified and
better-organized workers from South-East
Asia. The socio-economic costs of expor¬
ting labour must also be taken into account,
as, for example, the impact on the home
labour market. In the Arab Republic of
Yemen, about 20 per cent of the labour
force is reported to be working abroad.
Since many of these workers come from
rural areas, agricultural production and pro¬
ductivity is considerably affected, and this
adds to the uncertainty concerning food
supplies. Moreover, by draining skilled and
semi-skilled workers away from the country
continuous emigration has created staffing
and training problems for the national
development schemes.
Using funds sent home by emigrant
workers to expand national production,
which is a way of putting this money to the
most profitable use and even of creating
jobs for the workers themselves should they
later wish to return home, is a difficult
problem of economic management that few
developing countries have succeeded in
solving satisfactorily. The LDCs, especially,
lack adequate savings schemes that would
enable the State to borrow and use for
development funds sent home from abroad.
The result is that the money, instead of be¬
ing saved, is spent on consumer products
and this, in turn, creates inflationary
pressure and discourages investment.
Clearly, the lack of resources in the Least
Developed Countries of the ECWA area
must be made good by outside aid. Hitherto
the amount of financial assistance received
by these countries has fallen short of the re¬
quirements of possible development pro¬
grammes. Most of the earlier aid schemes
were designed to support the budget and
the balance of payments, as well as con¬
tributing to defence expenditure. The pro¬
ductive sectors received insufficient aid and
most of this was used to maintain consump¬
tion of essential goods such as foodstuffs,
pharmaceutical products and fuels and to
build schools, hospitals and roads.
The oil-producing countries of the ECWA
region have been in the front rank of sup¬
pliers of aid to the poorest countries of the
area, as well as the Third World as a whole.
Their assistance has either been given
direct, under bilateral agreements, or chan¬
nelled through multilateral operations. Over
the period 1973-1978, the OPEC countries of
the region devoted on average 5 per cent of
their GNP to the developing countries, out
of a total of 6 per cent of their GNP spent on
foreign aid. It should also be noted that 5 per
cent of the aid received by the least privileg¬
ed countries of ECWA comes from the oil-
producing States of the region.
Quite apart from the amount of aid receiv¬
ed, the form it takes and the way it is financ¬
ed are of vital importance to the LDCs.. They
cannot be expected to bear the high interest
costs of loans made to assist development.
The aid they receive should be essentially in
the form of gifts. Another difficulty arises
for the receiving countries when the donor
wishes to finance only part of a project,
leaving the recipient to search for a co¬
financer. Even if one is found, the execution
of the project still presents serious problems
of co-ordination. The LDCs also need in¬
creased aid in the form of food supplies to
enable them to meet minimum needs and
build up essential reserves.
The poorest countries of the ECWA
region, like those of the other regions, also
require effective technical assistance pro¬
grammes, particularly in connexion with the
training of executives and skilled workers,
the development of energy resources, the
establishment of technical components of
infrastructures and the identification and
selection of projects. Providing technical
assistance is an ideal way for the more
technically advanced developing countries
to prove their solidarity with the Least
Developed Countries.

### 47565: Tropic islands in search of a future; interview with José Brito, Cape Verde's Secretary of State for Development

2. Tropic islands
in search of a future
Interview with José Brito,
Cape Verde's Secretary of State for Development
Courier The group of "Least Developed Countries" seems to be
a very varied assortment Is there any common denominator for
these thirty-one States?
Brito Yes, they are indeed very diverse and, at first sight, it is dif¬
ficult to see what the little islands of my country. Cape Verde, with a
total populatioh of 300,000, can have in common with, for example,
Bangladesh, which has a hundred millioh inhabitants. Obviously the
priorities are not the same. But there is a cornmoh denominator, and
probably ohly ohe: the fundamental problems faced by the develop¬
ing world education, health and employment are more serious in
these countries than elsewhere and the governments find it even
more difficult to solve them.
This is true even when a country is rich in natural resources. Guinea,
for example, has large mineral deposits, while Cape Verde has none;
but Guinea is not yet in a position to develop as it would wish and
lacks the means to exploit these resources itself. In other words, the
Least Developed Countries face obstacles they cannot overcome
without considerable support from the international community.

### 47565: Tropic islands in search of a future; interview with José Brito, Cape Verde's Secretary of State for Development

CASE STUDIES
Courier What specific problems does Cape Verde face and could
you explain why you lack the means to resolve them?
Brito I can answer you in two words: infrastructure and person¬
nel. As far as the economic infrastructure is concerned we inherited
practically nothing from the colonial system. The country had been
living on direct aid from the suzerain power and when it became in¬
dependent it was not even able to feed its own population. As an
agricultural country in a semi-arid zone it is part of the Sahelian
climatic system Cape Verde depends almost entirely on rainfall
agriculture; very few areas are irrigated and droughts have had
disastrous effects. There are still food shortages even today.
Though it is an archipelago consisting of ten islands and five islets,
its ports are insufficient to allow the free flow of people and goods.
At the time of independence industry was non-existent.
In a situation like this what can be done to provide employment and
prevent emigration? There are 300,000 Cape Verdeans living in the
islands and probably as many if not more living abroad. In fact, there
is a positive aspect to this emigration at present since it enables us to
correct our trade deficit, for our imports vastly exceed our exports.
Nevertheless, emigration also has its dangers since it is usually the
most qualified people who emigrate and as a result we are in the
paradoxical position of having a very high rate of unemployment and
an enormous lack of executive level personnel. This is characteristic
of most of the Least Developed Countries: they lack qualified staff to
run the economy and the civil service.
Courier Isn't a high rate of illiteracy another characteristic of the
Least Developed Countries?
Brito It certainly is a qualification for membership of the group.
Yet it is clear that if these countries are to acquire the techniques
needed for development, they must have a high literacy rate. Il¬
literate peasants don't take easily to innovation; they stick to tradi¬
tional methods which, often, do not allow them to rise above a sub¬
sistence economy. In Cape Verde, however, this problem is less
acute than elsewhere. There are still too many illiterate adults, but
more than ninety-five per cent of children of school age are now
receiving primary education. What is much more serious is that we
do not have the qualified personnel or the resources to increase our
production and so reduce our dependence on other countries. This
is another characteristic of the Least Developed Countries and the
developing countries in general: often they can see a way of solving
their problems but haven't the means of doing so.
Courier When you speak of the problems of manpower, or
human resources, are you thinking in terms of the problems of voca¬
tional and technical training?
Brito Yes, that is a concrete example of the type of problem we
are facing. We have to educate workers and set up vocational train¬
ing centres, and this training must continue within industry. But we
haven't the money to open such centres, to establish technical col¬
leges and maintain them, nor have we the staff to man themat
least, not Cape Verdeans.
Courier Yet there are plenty of qualified and competent Cape
Verdeans.
Brito Yes, but they are abroad. One can't really talk about a brain
drain. We have been independent now for six years about the time
it takes to train a first batch of professionals. These young people
should soon be coming back from the foreign universities where
they have been studying, but we know that many won't. This is
nothing new. It happened long before independence. Many Cape
Verdeans have become nationals of other countries and hold posi¬
tions of responsibility. Among the highly qualified people only a
small number come back to work in Cape Verde. It is true that the
terms we offer are not very attractive; salaries are low and there is an
acute housing shortage, but the development of our country calls
for sacrifices.
Courier All the developing countries face these problems.
Brito Yes, but they are more acute in Cape Verde because of the
emigration I mentioned earlier which is a tradition with us. Cape Ver-
14
deans don't emigrate just anywhere. They know where to go and
find it easy to adapt. I mentioned the economic advantages and
disadvantages of emigration, but there are also cultural ones.
Foreign contacts and exchanges can have some very salutary ef¬
fects. As a people we have no inhibitions with regard to other
cultures and find it easy to integrate elements from them into our
own. This open-mindedness, which is the hallmark of our culture,
enables us to adopt any useful innovations. But there is one
"cultural danger" that has a direct effect on the economy and that is
the importation of consumption patterns completely unsuited to our
resources and which lead to public demand for goods that local pro¬
duction cannot provide.
Courier Will the government go on giving priority to agriculture?
Brito Yes, we must concentrate on fighting the desert and the
problems connected with drought. This means reallocation of the
land, reafforestation, soil conservation, as well as increasing water
resources and supplies and extending the areas under irrigation. A
programme of this kind calls for large-scale investment. In Cape
Verde the cost of developing one hectare of land clearing it of
stones, improving the soil and protecting it against erosion is ex¬
tremely high.
Fortunately, the people understand the need for this work and are
able to take part in it. These schemes for soil protection and irriga¬
tion create jobs and therefore help in the fight against unemploy¬
ment. Moreover, the agricultural sector is likely to attract investment
and loans, so we hope to solve the problem of finance without too
much difficulty. This is practically the only area in which national
production can be increased.
The organization of these various activities calls for a series of an¬
cillary measures such as agrarian reform, the creation of credit
facilities and agricultural extension services. We know full well,
however, that the possibilities of agriculture are limited by factors
such as climate, demographic pressure and the amount of land
available. A time will come when increased productivity will no
longer generate development. So we must prepare for the next
phase industrialization. We intend to concentrate on processing
industries, canneries and enterprises producing building materials.
We are also thinking of establishing industries linked to Cape
Verde's geographic and economic position as an international
staging post. These would include merchant shipping as well as
fuelling and transit facilities, warehouses, etc.
But, once again, to reach this phase we need trained personnel. If
we don't want to lose control of our economy we must train Cape
Verdeans and organize them into peasant and worker production co¬
operatives. Furthermore, we must adapt the public services to cater
for this co-operative system and set up institutions capable of direc¬
ting public enterprises in other words, establish a coherent system
to control production.
In my view, one of the great mistakes made by developing countries
in the past has been to start by setting up production structures and
then, at a later stage, trying to solve their manpower problems. We
must go about it the other way round and start with the human
problem, not forgetting that basic to this is the provision of health
services and food supplies.
Courier A programme of this kind calls for considerable finance.
Where do you see the aid coming from in the present international
situation?
Brito We have developed co-operative links with as many coun¬
tries as possible. We believe that the more dependent a country is
economically, the more independent it should try to be at the ethical
and political level, and that therefore it should avoid ranging itself
with one group rather than another. That is why non-alignment
seems to us to be the only path open to the developing countries if
they want to avoid becoming satellites. In fact, non-alignment could
become an international force capable of reducing conflict and ten¬
sion and of increasing the world's concern for the problems of
development.

### 47567: The Disinherited: a dossier on the thirty-one least developed countries

The Disinherited
A dossier on
Least
Developed
Countries
The United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Coun¬
tries, held at Unesco's Paris headquarters from 1 to 14
September, 1981, reflected the will of the international com¬
munity to give unique attention and support to overcoming the
basic development problems of the poorest, weakest countries
in the world the least developed countries. It should be seen as
part of efforts to alleviate poverty generally in all developing
countries, and as part of the broader efforts to establish the New
International Economic Order.
The group of least developed countries now comprises a
population of approximately 275 million or about one-eighth of
the population of all developing countries (excluding China). Ac¬
cording to recommendations by the United Nations Committee
for Development Planning, the expression "least developed
countries" means the weakest in terms of certain economic and
social criteria: low income, low literacy rate and low share of
manufacturing in total output.
What are the reasons for the very low level of most of the
economic and social indicators for the least developed countries
as well as for the weak, and sometimes even deteriorating, per¬
formance over time of many of them?
Although quite diverse in a number of structural charac¬
teristics, they have in common: a high percentage of population
dependent on agriculture; extremely limited manufacturing ac¬
tivity; very low rates of economic growth; exports limited to a
few primary products; natural resources either unexploited,
limited or non-existent; often subject to severe geographic,
climatic or topographical handicaps; extremely limited
resources of skilled personnel; widespread malnutrition; lack of
safe drinking water; limited health services and education
systems; low levels of investment; heavy dependence on foreign
aid; lack of foreign exchange to command imports needed for
development.
On the following pages the Unesco Courier presents a dossier
on the appalling problems facing the Least Developed Countries.
The necessarily brief reports are based on summaries prepared
by the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on the Least
Developed Countries on the basis of presentations made by the
countries concerned. In the case of Guinea the summary was
prepared by the country itself. In the case of Chad, no country
presentation was made and the figures quoted in this dossier are
taken from a variety of United Nations sources.
A deliberate choice was made to present the current situation
of each country and to exclude the detailed development plans
drawn up by countries themselves. It cannot be too strongly em¬
phasized that the Least Developed Countries, without exception,
are themselves making tremendous efforts against virtually im¬
possible odds to remedy a situation which dishonours the entire
world.

The world community adopts a ten-year action programme
When the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed
Countries ended on 14 September, it was amid hopes that the
world community had agreed on a prescription which would relieve
the plight of the 275 million people living in the world's poorest and
economically weakest nations. These hopes repose on a Substan¬
tial New Programme of Action for the 1980s (SNPA) which
delegates adopted by acclamation.
The Programme, approval of which climaxed two weeks of
discussion and negotiations in which representatives of 142 coun¬
tries took part, is designed to transform the economies of the least
developed countries towards sustained self development and
enable them to provide at least internationally-accepted minimum
standards of nutrition, health, housing and education, as well as
job opportunities to all their citizens, particularly to the rural and
urban poor.
The Substantial New Programme of Action has three chapters:
Chapter I deals with the general situation and national measures;
Chapter II covers international support measures, and Chapter III
arrangements for implementation, follow-up and monitoring.
In the introduction to the Chapter on the general situation and
national measures, the Conference stated that the least developed
countries have the primary responsibility for their overall develop¬
ment. Sections are devoted to measures that should be envisaged
at the national level in key sectors such as food and agriculture,
human resources and social development, natural resources and
energy and the manufacturing industry.
Among the objectives cited are the 4 per cent annual growth
target in agriculture set In the International Development Strategy
for the Third United Nations Development Decade for all develop¬
ing countries, so that food production in each country would in¬
crease faster than population growth with a view to guaranteeing
food security. The target set for the manufacturing industry in the
least developed countries should aim at increasing the rate of
manufacturing growth to an overall annual growth of 9 per cent or
more.
The dependence of the least developed countries on external aid
is indicated by the fact that they are now able to finance only half of
their imports out of export earnings. The import costs of these
countries has risen by $10 billion in the last decade with only a small
increase in the real volume of imports. With the growth in popula¬
tion there has been an actual decline in per capita terms. Recogniz¬
ing this situation, the Conference stated in the Programme of Ac¬
tion that only a "substantial" increase in official development
assistance in real terms during the 1980s would enable the least
developed countries to achieve the objectives of their country
programmes.
In the Programme, donor countries also reaffirmed their commit¬
ment to the target of 0.7 per cent of their Gross National Product
(GNP) for overall Official Development Assistance (ODA) to all
developing countries, as envisaged in the provisions of the Interna¬
tional Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Develop¬
ment Decade, and agreed that the flows of ODA would be increas¬
ingly directed towards the least developed countries.
According to the Programme, most donors of ODA will devote in
the coming years 0.15 per cent of their GNP to these countries.
Others will double their ODA to the least developed countries in the
same period. "Taken together these efforts are likely to achieve, by
1985, a doubling of ODA to the least developed countries, com¬
pared to the transfers to them during the last five years".
Agreement was also reached on other international support
measures related to aid modalities, technical assistance, commer¬
cial policy and transfer of technology. These measures taken
together were also considered as likely to have considerable impact
on the situation of the 31 least developed countries.
The programme emphasizes that regular review and monitoring
of its implementation at national, regional and global levels is
essential. National reviews would be fundamental for the execution
of the SNPA in the least developed countries while the regional and
global reviews will be crucial in ensuring international support for
it. The review mechanism as a whole will be a "means to ensure
that every least developed country receives an adequate minimum
flow of assistance and demonstrates a minimum standard of per¬
formance in economic development".

Republic of Afghanistan
2. The People's Republic
of Bangladesh
3. The People's Republic
of Benin
AFGHANISTAN is a land-locked country
with a surface area of about 650,000
square kilometres and a population
of about 15.5 million. Arable land accounts
for about 12 per cent of the total area, forest
and woodland for about 6 per cent. The ter¬
rain is mountainous or hilly, the climate con¬
tinental. About 71 per cent of the population
is rural, 16 per cent nomadic and 13 per cent
urban, with almost half the urban population
living in Kabul. Life expectancy at birth is 42
years. The number of children in primary
schools is expected to reach the one million
mark shortly; the adult literacy rate is about
12 per cent. Agriculture (including forestry)
is the principal activity, accounting for about
58 per cent of the national income in 1978/79
and for 70 per cent of employment. The main
crops are wheat, fruit, cotton and sugar
beet. Animal husbandry is a major occupa¬
tion for the rural and nomadic population
and livestock products are exported in con¬
siderable quantities. In 1978/79 industry ac¬
counted for about 11 per cent of the national
income and trade for about 9 per cent. The
active labour force is estimated at about 5
million. The country's mineral wealth (coal,
iron ore, copper, natural gas) and
agricultural raw materials provide a basis for
industrialization, and the energy potential,
as yet largely unexploited, is considerable.
The constraints hampering the industrializa¬
tion process are the rugged terrain, the land¬
locked situation of the country and the shor¬
tage of managerial manpower.
BANGLADESH, with a population over
90 million, is the world's eighth most
populous country (density about 580
persons to the square kilometre). Over 90 per
cent of the people live in rural areas and de¬
pend largely on agriculture and related ac¬
tivities for a living. The manufacturing sector
accounts for only some 10 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product. It is estimated that 80 per
cent of the population are living below the
poverty line, i.e. their income is not suffi¬
cient to cover minimum requirements of
food, shelter, clothing, education and health
care. The country's natural resource endow¬
ment is limited, consisting essentially of
fisheries, natural gas and some mineral
deposits. At present adequate shelter, piped
water, sanitation and other community
facilities are available only in about 100 urban
and semi-urban locations in the country, ser¬
ving about 10 per cent of the total popula¬
tion. There is one physician per 11,000 per¬
sons, one hospital bed per 4,500 persons. Of
the country's 8.500 medical practitioners,
fewer than 10 per cent work in the rural
areas. In earlier years privileged treatment
was accorded to university education, at the
expense of primary education and as a result
the literacy rate remained low (about 22 per
cent). Per capita consumption of energy is
one of the lowest in the world. While three-
quarters of the energy consumed comes
from sources like firewood, cow dung, etc.,
the import bill for fuel nevertheless
represents more than half the country's total
foreign exchange earnings. Vulnerability to
natural disasters (floods, cyclones) is
another formidable obstacle to sustained
economic and social development.
BENIN, a country of almost 113,000 sq.
km., is situated in the equatorial
coastal region of West Africa. Its
population was estimated in 1979 at about 3.3
million. The yearly demographic growth rate
is about 2.7 per cent. Owing to climatic con¬
ditions and to water-borne diseases, certain
infectious diseases and inadequate health
care, life expectancy at birth is very
lowabout 39 years. Infant mortality is very
high. Over 80 per cent of the population lives
in rural areas, which are poorly provided
with health services. The average school
enrolment was estimated at about 47 per
cent in 1978. The literacy rate of the popula¬
tion as a whole is estimated at about 12 per
cent, but it is thought that only about 5 per
cent of persons over the age of 35 can read
and write. Agriculture is the principal oc¬
cupation of over 60 per cent of the labour
force of about 1.5 million. The modern sector
gives employment to only about 61,600
wage-earners, of whom almost half are
employed in the public service. The physical
infrastructure, roads, railways, port, is in¬
adequate for the needs of the country's
economic development. Many rural
localities are not accessible the year round
and hence cannot market their produce.
Piped water and electricity supplies are
available virtually only in the large urban cen¬
tres. The country's principal export com¬
modities are palm oil, coffee, cotton,
groundnuts and shrimps. Both the value and
the volume of these exports have been
declining in recent years.

4. The Kingdom
of Bhutan
THE Kingdom of Bhutan, a land-locked
country with a total land area of about
47,000 square kilometres in the Hima¬
layan ranges, has a population estimated at
1.2 million. There are three climatic zones:
the southern characterized by a hot humid
tropical climate; the central belt is
temperate; and the northern area is alpine.
About 70 per cent of the total surface area
consists of forest, 9 per cent is under cultiva¬
tion and the rest is wilderness. The vast ma¬
jority of the Bhutanese work force (95 per
cent) is engaged in agriculture which con¬
tributed 54 per cent to Bhutan's Gross Na¬
tional Product in 1979/80. Animal husbandry
is an integral part of farming activities and in
the alpine region forms virtually the sole
economic activity. There are only two urban
centres, including the capital Tnimpu, with
more than 20,000 inhabitants. Bhutan's abun¬
dant but as yet largely unexploited natural
resources consist principally of forestry
resources, hydroelectric energy potential
and certain mineral deposits. The average
life expectancy is 46 years and the rate of in¬
fant mortality is high. The existing health
care system is weak (one doctor per 20,000
inhabitants, 12 general hospitals, about 80
dispensaries and three leprosy centres). The
two principal constraints hampering ac¬
tivities in all sectors are the shortage of train¬
ed and skilled manpower and the lack of ade¬
quate financial resources. The illiteracy rate
is estimated at 78 per cent. Industry in
Bhutan is still at the infant stage accounting
for about 6 per cent of Gross National Pro¬
duct.
5. The Republic
of Botswana
BOTSWANA is a land-locked country in
the centre of the Southern African
plateau. Its area is about 582,000 sq.
km. Two-thirds of the country is desert. It is
estimated that less than 5 per cent of the sur¬
face is arable. On the other hand, much of
the land is suitable for cattle grazing. The de
jure population is estimated at 884,000; of
these about 55,000 are absentees, mostly
males employed in South Africa. The de fac¬
to population (persons resident in Botswana,
whether citizens or not) is estimated at
849,000. The annual rate of population
growth is about 3 per cent. About half the
population is under age 15. According to the
1971 census, the infant mortality rate was 97
per 1,000, and 152 per 1.000 did not survive to
the age of 5. Life expectancy at birth was
then 52.5 years for men and 58.6 for women.
It is thought that since 1971 infant mortality
has been reduced thanks to better health
care. Because of lack of educational oppor¬
tunities in the past, most of the adult popula¬
tion of Botswana is illiterate. The majority of
the children however now have access to
primary education. It is estimated that about
three-fifths of the country's labour force (i.e.
about 250,000 persons) depend mainly on
subsistence agriculture and on informal ac¬
tivities for a livelihood. Botswana produces
no petroleum or natural gas and has no
hydroelectric potential. The majority of the
people use wood for heating and candles or
paraffin for light. It is hoped to exploit the
country's almost unlimited coal resources
and to lessen its dependence on expensive
imported petroleum products.
6. The Republic
of Burundi
B
,URUNDI forms part of the lakes region
of East Africa. It has a gross surface
area of 27,834 sq. km., the waters of
Lake Tanganyika accounting for
2,000 sq. km. In 1979, total population was
just over 4 million. About 95 per cent of the
people live in rural areas, the towns of Bu¬
jumbura and Gitega being virtually the only
built-up areas. Life expectancy at birth is 45
years and the infant mortality rate is 138 per
thousand. The climate is favourable to
agriculture and two or three harvests per an¬
num can be brought in depending on the
crop and the area concerned, so the
country's effective agricultural area is
probably doubled. However, strong
demographic pressure and the system of
land cultivation are causing the soil and
vegetation to deteriorate rapidly. In 1979,
four crops coffee, cotton, tea and cinchona
accounted for the bulk of the total value of
Burundi's exports. Lake Tanganyika yields
an annual fish catch of about 20,000 tonnes.
The manufacturing sector (textiles,
footwear, cigarettes, etc.) is scheduled to
achieve an annual growth rate of 11 per cent
between 1981 and 1985 and a similar growth
rate is forecast for the mining and energy
sectors. Despite progress made in recent
years the health situation remains
precarious; the doctor/inhabitant ratio is
1:34,000 and there is one hospital bed per 286
inhabitants. In 1977/78 the number of pupils
attending State primary schools was slightly
above 142,000 (23 per cent of the age group
concerned); a further 45 per cent were atten¬
ding private schools and literacy centres.
The literacy rate was 25 per cent in 1978.

7. The Republic
of Cape Verde
GAPE Verde consists of ten islands and
three islets with a total land surface
area of about 4,000 sq. km and a
population estimated at a little less than
300,000. The terrain of most of the islands is
rugged. Owing to prolonged drought and to
food shortages, many Cape Verdeans have
emigrated. It is estimated that the number of
emigrants is about equal to the number of
residents. The almost total lack of an
economic and social infrastructure, and the
ravages caused by progressive desertifica¬
tion have contributed to the present state of
the country's underdevelopment, ag¬
gravated by the small size of the internal
market and the decline of the output of sub¬
sistence agriculture and animal husbandry in
recent years. The country is dependent
essentially on external financial assistance,
food aid, commodity aid and remittances of
emigrants to cover the difference between
Gross Domestic Product and total expen¬
diture (the "gap" is estimated at more than
50 per cent). Industrial activity accounts for
about 10 per cent of GDP and employs about
3 per cent of the labour force. More than half
the population depends on agriculture for a
meagre livelihood. The illiteracy rate is about
50 per cent and the health situation is
precarious, as exemplified by an infant mor¬
tality rate of close to 100 per 1,000 and by a
doctor:population rate of about 1:5,800.
Technical and vocational training facilities
are insufficient but the educational stan¬
dards are expected to improve as almost all
children of school age (7-14 years) now at¬
tend school.
8. The Central African
Republic
THE Central African Republic is a land¬
locked country with a surface area of
about 623,000 sq. km. and a population
estimated (in 1980) at about 2,334,000, of
whom over 40 per cent are under 15. The rate
of population growth is estimated at 2.5 per
cent per annum. The illiteracy rate was
estimated (in 1962 by the World Bank) to be
in excess of 90 per cent. The general mortali¬
ty rate is estimated at 250 per 1,000, the in¬
fant mortality rate at 130 per 1,000. All im¬
ports and exports have to be carried over
long distances by road and rail from and to
the seaports of neighbouring transit coun¬
tries (e.g., the distance from Bangui to
Douala is about 1,530 km). About 80 per cent
of the population depends on agriculture for
its livelihood. Less than 2 per cent of the
country's surface area is cultivated; about 10
per cent is used by nomadic population
groups for cattle raising; and dense forest
accounts for about 5 per cent. In 1980 exports
amounted to about $100 million, imports to
about $180 million. The doctor.-population
ratio is about 1:27,500. The diet, particularly
of vulnerable groups such as pregnant
women and children, is insufficient and un¬
balanced. The rate of school enrolment is
about 47 per cent of children of school age.
According to preliminary geological surveys,
the Republic possesses large mineral
resources but as yet these have not been
thoroughly explored or evaluated. It also
possesses a great though as yet largely
unexploited potential of hydro-electric
power, thanks to its numerous water
courses which could be harnessed to
generate electricity.
9. The Federal and Islamic
Republic of the Comoros
TIE islands that constitute the Republic
of the Comoros have a surface area of
about 2,240 square kilometres and a
population of about 400,000. Population den¬
sity is very high, averaging 190 persons per
square kilometre. The islands are of volcanic
origin, the coasts are rocky and there is prac¬
tically no natural harbour. On the island of
Grande Comore there are no year-round
rivers or streams and the island is dependent
on rainwater stored in tanks and reservoirs.
Agriculture accounts for about 40 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product and for virtually all
export earnings. Export crops include
vanilla, cloves, coconuts and ylang ylang (an
important ingredient for perfumes). Forest
resources have been seriously depleted and
now cover only about 20,000 hectares. The
fish catch is estimated at about 3,000 tonnes
annually, but the potential fisheries
resources are much greater. At present
fishing is carried on by traditional methods.
Non-agricultural production plays only a
minor part in the national economy and
tourism is still in its infancy. The health situa¬
tion is distressing. The rate of infant mortali¬
ty is about 20 per cent and life expectancy is
41 years for men and 44 years for women The
diet of the inhabitants is short of calories and
protein. There are three hospitals with about
500 beds. The country has 28 doctors. Nearly
all children between the ages of 5 and 7 at¬
tend the Koranic schools. About 63 per cent
of children of school age are enrolled in
primary schools, which are modelled on the
French system. The teaching staff is to a
large extent underqualified.

10. Ethiopia 11. The Republic
of the Gambia
12. The Revolutionary
People's Republic
of Guinea
ETHIOPIA has a total land area of
1,223,600 square kilometres comprising
a central highland mass surrounded by
lowlands. Population was estimated to be 31
million in 1980. Ethiopia is a land of young
people with about 54 per cent of the popula¬
tion being below 20 years of age. There is a
low standard of nutrition, inadequate access
to clean water, widespread disease and a
high infant mortality rate. Agriculture is bas¬
ed on small-holder production which makes
extensive use of the land. The main food
crops are cereals, pulses and oilseeds. The
main cash crops are coffee (Ethiopia is the
largest Arabica coffee producer in Africa
with an annual output of 200,000 tonnes),
oilseeds, cotton, sisal, tobacco, fruit, pepper
and sugar cane. Ethiopia is first in Africa and
tenth in the world in the size of its livestock
resources: 70 million cattle, sheep and goats
and about 8 million horses, mules, donkeys,
camels, etc. The manufacturing sector plays
an important role in supplying consumer
goods to the domestic market and absorbing
agricultural raw materials. Food processing
accounts for 30 per cent of manufacturing
production, textiles for 25 per cent and
beverages for 12 per cent. The remainder
comprises tobacco, leather and footwear,
wood, chemicals and construction
materials. The post-revolutionary period has
witnessed a great expansion in health ser¬
vices which now reach a significant propor¬
tion of the population. There has also been
notable progress in education with more
than 1.8 million children enrolled in primary
schools in 1979/80. During the Mass Literacy
Campaign, nearly seven million adults were
covered by courses in basic literacy.
THE Gambia covers some 10,360 sq. km.
forming a narrow strip of 350 km.
entirely surrounded by Senegal and
bordered on the west by the Atlantic. It is
one of the Sahelian countries and suffers
from frequent droughts. The population was
estimated (June 1980) at 603.000 and is pro¬
jected to reach 1 million by the year 2000. The
urban population accounts for about a
quarter of the total and is concentrated in
and around the capital Banjul. Among the ef¬
fects of migration from the countryside are a
shortage of housing, inadequate urban ser¬
vices and increased unemployment. Health
and sanitary conditions are among the
poorest in West Africa, especially in the rural
areas. It has been estimated that 62 per cent
of the rural population has to walk more than
10 km. to reach the nearest health care facili¬
ty. The national literacy rate is 10 per cent,
and is lower in rural areas. According to the
Gambian 1973 census (the latest available)
average life expectancy was 36.1 years. In¬
fant mortality ¡s 217 per 1,000 and 30 per cent
of children die before the age of 2. The
average calorie intake is only 80-90 per cent
of the "minimum" required level.
GUINEA, which is situated in the south¬
western part of West Africa, has a
population of 6.4 million (1980) and
an area of 246,000 sq. km. The rate of school
enrolment, which was about 15 per cent at
independence in 1958, was raised to 70 per
cent in 1979. A mass literacy campaign was
launched in 1968, and functional literacy has
been achieved throughout the country in
eight national languages. The crude death
rate fell from 27.7 per thousand in 1960 to
20.7 per thousand in 1980, while life expec¬
tancy during the same period rose from 36 to
43.5 years. However, the general mortality
rate was 20.7 per thousand in 1977 and the
infant mortality rate 156 per thousand. With
its land, climatic and water resources, Gui¬
nea has a high potential tor agricultural deve¬
lopment. Cultivated land is estimated at
about 1.1 million hectares, of which 76 per
cent is used for crop rotation. The country
has a considerable timber potential for all
purposes. Bauxite reserves are estimated at
12 billion tons, or two thirds of world resour¬
ces. Iron ore deposits are currently estima¬
ted at 15 billion tons. Prospecting has revea¬
led substantial uranium shows and deposits
are estimated at more than 5 million tons.
Hydroelectic resources are extensive and as
yet practically untapped.

13. The Republic
of Guinea-Bissau
14. The Republic of Haiti 15. Lao People's
Democratic Republic
GUINEA-Bissau is situated on the west
coast of Africa, south of Senegal.
Its surface area is about 36,000 sq. km.
of which about 8,000 consists of rivers and
swamps. The population is about 800,000
(1979) of whom about 87 per cent live in
about 3,600 villages in the interior. The birth
rate is fairly high (average family size: 6.3
persons), but the Infant mortality rate is very
high owing to poor health care (about one
hospital bed per 600 persons, a low doctor-
population ratio (about 1:10,000), endemic
diseases, deficient diet and inadequate
supply of safe water. The principal economic
activity is agriculture, which has recently
suffered from drought for three successive
years. The literacy rate is barely 15 per cent.
Of the active labour force of about 450,000,
only about 25,000 are wage earners; the bulk
of the labour force being engaged in the sub¬
sistence economy. The agricultural sector,
which employs almost 90 per cent of the
labour force, accounted for only about 40 per
cent of the Gross Domestic Product, owing
to low yield and low productivity. The
country's food deficit in 1979 amounted to
about 20,000 tons of cereals, 3,000 tons of
sugar, 800 tons of edible oils, 200 tons of
milk.
HAITI has a surface area of about
27,500 sq. km. and a population of
rather more than 5 million, of whom
about 3,630,000 live in rural areas. Three-
quarters of the territory is mountainous, and
large tracts of the plains consist of infertile
land. The principal cause of the impoverish¬
ment of the soil is excessive exploitation of
the forest resources by the growing popula¬
tion in search of fuel wood and timber,
which has led to an erosion of the land and to
a water shortage of well-nigh disastrous pro¬
portions. The consequential ecological
damage has had a most serious effect on
agriculture. The population is growing at an
annual rate of about 1.8 per cent. Average
life expectancy is about 52 years; the infant
mortality is very high at about 150 per thou¬
sand. The Gross Domestic Product grew at
an average rate of 2.7 per cent between 1970
and 1980. Economic and social progress is
hampered, however, by the stagnant
agriculture, on which 80 per cent of the
population depends for a livelihood, and by
the chronically adverse balance of
payments. There is widespread unemploy¬
ment and underemployment, and the coun¬
try suffers from a maldistribution of incomes
and inter-sectoral and interregional im¬
balances.
THE Lao People's Democratic Republic,
established in 1975, is a land-locked
country with a surface area of about
237,000 sq. km. and a population estimated
at 3.75 million. The labour force is about 1.6
million. The infant mortality rate is about 200
per 1,000 and life expectancy at birth was
estimated In 1972 at 50 years. There is one
doctor per 31,000 inhabitants and one
hospital bed per 458 inhabitants. The
agricultural sector employs 80 per cent of the
population and accounts for about two
thirds of Gross Domestic Product, The prin¬
cipal crops are rice, cotton, coffee, tobacco,
vegetables and maize. The country's prin¬
cipal natural resource and export commodity
is the timber from the vast forest area. The
country's potential hydroelectric resources
and mineral deposits known or thought to
exist are as yet largely unexploited or even
unexplored. At the moment, the only mineral
deposits worked commercially are those of
tin and gypsum. The constraints affecting
the country's development are mainly: Its
land-locked situation, the low density of the
population, the inadequate infrastructure of
roads, communications and means of
transport and the country's vulnerability to
natural disasters. The development task is
hampered by the loss of lives and property
and the destruction of large areas (almost 40
per cent) of the cultivable land during the
long period of war, when more than a
quarter of the population became refugees,
and by the consequences of natural disasters
(drought in 1977 and floods in 1978).

16. The Kingdom
of Lesotho
LESOTHO is a small, land-locked country
entirely surrounded by one econo¬
mically more advanced and dominant
neighbour. South Africa. It constitutes a
very limited market and has a restricted
resource base. The total de jure population
(1976 census) was 1,216,816; the resident
population was 1,064,162, with 152,654 na¬
tionals employed in South Africa. The vital
role played by migrant labour in Lesotho's
economy can be assessed from the fact that
in 1977/78 migrants remitted some $156
million to Lesotho, an amount almost equal
to the income generated from domestic ac¬
tivities. Only 13 per cent of the total land area
is suitable for crop cultivation. However,
agriculture is the most important economic
sector in Lesotho. Together with mining
employment in South Africa it provides the
main source of Income for about 90 per cent
of the population. The country has a com¬
paratively high rate of literacy: about 60 per
cent of the population have attended school,
and around 57 per cent aged 10 and over have
had at least 3 years of primary education. On¬
ly about 10 per cent of the population have
access to piped water. Lesotho's socio¬
economic problems are largely a result of the
country's geopolitical position. The country
being a labour pool for the mines and in¬
dustries of South Africa, little effort was
made prior to independence (1966) to
develop Lesotho's infrastructure.
17. The Republic
of Malawi
MALAWI, a land-locked country,
occupies a narrow strip of land and
lakes totalling 118,500 sq. km. bor¬
dered by Mozambique, Zambia and Tan¬
zania. It has a total population of some 6
million people. Average life expectancy is 42
years. Infant mortality is 130 per thousand
but is higher in rural areas. Health services
are free, but facilities are old and in need of
improvement and extension. Population per
physician is 50,000. About 36 per cent of the
adult population are literate. Primary school
enrolment is 60 per cent of the relevant age
group and secondary school enrolment 4 per
cent of the 14-18 age group. The main
agricultural crops are maize, groundnuts and
cassava (grown mainly for subsistence), and
tobacco, tea, sugar and cotton produced for
export on large commercial estates. Known
mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite,
apatite and uranium have not yet proved to
be economically exploitable. Possibilities for
the development of these and other minerals
as yet undiscovered are being studied.
18. The Republic
of Maldives
THE Republic of Maldives consists of an
archipelago of nearly 1,200 islands in
the Indian Ocean. Most of the islands
are tiny, none larger than five square
kilometres. Only two (including Male, the
capital) have a population of more than
5,000. The total population is estimated at
153,000. Life expectancy at birth is estimated
at 46.5 years. The adult literacy rate is at least
70 per cent, this relatively high figure being
accounted for largely by schooling at
Koranic schools. Health and hygiene condi¬
tions are poor; the drinking water supply is
inadequate, and communicable diseases and
malnutrition are widespread. There is no
regular inter-island transport. Agriculture is
very much a subsidiary activity in the Maldi-
vian economy, accounting for about one
tenth of employment. Fishing, followed by
tourism and shipping, is the principal oc¬
cupation of Maldivians, and the sale of fish
to foreign buyers is an important source of
export earnings. The manufacture of coir
products is the leading industry not based on
maritime resources. There are also some'
small-scale artisan and cottage industries.
The high economic growth rates (10-12 per
cent annually) achieved by the Maldives in
recent years are attributable to tourism, to
mechanization of the fishing industry, to the
operations of the merchant shipping fleet,
and to the growth of the capital, Male. The
single most important impediment to the
development of the Maldives is the lack of
trained manpower. Although the level of
literacy is high, the level of educational at¬
tainment of the population as a whole is low;
in 1977, only 20 per cent of the population
had attained the standard of primary
education.

19. The Republic of Mali
20. The Kingdom
of Nepal
21. The Republic
of the Niger
MALI is a semi-arid land-locked
African country with a surface
area of about 1,240,000 sq. km.
between the Sahara and the Sudano-
Sahelian belt. It is estimated that the popula¬
tion (average annual growth rate about 2.5
per cent) will reach or exceed 7 million in
1981. Over 83 per cent of the population live
in rural areas. Over 80 per cent are under 40,
over 44 per cent under 15 (1976 figures).
These statistics of a very youthful nation
contrast with the grim mortality rates: overa
quarter of the children born in rural areas
died before age 5. An estimated 3 per cent of
the population suffers from such serious
diseases as leprosy, trypanosomiasis, tuber¬
culosis and river blindness. Average life ex¬
pectancy is about 38 years. In 1975 the
literacy rate was estimated at 10 per cent. As
regards resources of trained manpower,
graduates with academic training are look¬
ing for work, whereas there are unfilled job
vacancies for people with specific technical
and practical skills. Mali actually exports
highly qualified manpower and at the same
time is short of personnel for the execution
of large projects and its health and educa¬
tional services. Health services are insuffi¬
cient. In 1976 there were only 212 medical
practitioners, one for every 4,000 persons in
the capital Bamako, but only one for every
56,000 or so elswhere. The value of exports
was estimated at $99 million for 1979. Im¬
ports amounted to about $234 million. The
import bill was aggravated by the high cost
of petroleum products and of transport and
by the effects of successive droughts which
cut domestic production of foodstuffs and
necessitated heavy imports of these essen¬
tial commodities. Mali possesses con¬
siderable mineral resources, some of which
are being exploited: gold, phosphate, gyp¬
sum, bauxite, iron ore, manganese ore.
NEPAL is a land-locked country in the
Himalayan region, with a land area
of about 141,000 sq. km. and a popu¬
lation estimated at 14.3 million. The moun¬
tain region (altitude 5,000 to 8,000 metres)
constitutes about one third of the territory,
the hill region (altitude 1,000 to 5,000 metres)
45 per cent, and the fertile tropical Terai plain
for the remainder. The literacy rate is about
24 per cent. Agriculture, including animal
husbandry, supplies about 80 per cent of ex¬
ports, provides half the raw materials for in¬
dustry and contributes about 60 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product. Industry is as yet
in the infant stage of development employ¬
ing fewer than 60,000 people. In addition
there are about 750,000 cottage industry
units employing over a million people.
Tourism has expanded greatly in recent
years. Health conditions in Nepal are among
the poorest in the world. Infant mortality
rates are very high; the doctor/population
ratio is about 1:39,000; the average calorie in¬
take is below the recommended minimum.
Since 1950 a community health system has
been created and malaria in the Terai has
been almost eradicated. Life expectancy at
birth is estimated at 43 years. In 1979/80, over
a million children were enrolled in 10,000
primary schools, staffed by 27,000 teachers.
Secondary school enrolment stood at
500,000, and over 39,000 students were enroll¬
ed in centres of higher learning.
THE Republic of the Niger is a land¬
locked country in the Sahelian region;
the nearest point to the sea is 760 km.
from the port of Cotonou. The country's
total surface area is about 1,267,000 sq. km.,
with a population of about 5.1 million (1977).
About 90 per cent of the population live in
rural communities, including a nomadic
population estimated at about 740,000. The
birth rate is estimated at 52 per thousand, the
infant mortality rate 200 per thousand, and
the child mortality rate (children under the
age of 5) 500 per thousand. At present, only
about 30 per cent of the country's rural set¬
tlements are adequately supplied with
water. In the last 5 years the economy has
experienced strong growth. The recent
drought severely affected the cultivation of
groundnuts, but the country's agricultural
production still satisfies about 75 per cent of
the population's food needs. The principal
exports are uranium, livestock, niebé (a local
bean), hides and skins, edible oils and cot¬
ton. Imports consist of a vast range of con¬
sumer and capital goods and petroleum pro¬
ducts. The balance of trade is chronically in
deficit. The country's natural endowment,
on which its future development depends,
are the land, water and mineral wealth. Of
the 15 million hectares of cultivable land, on¬
ly about a fifth is at present cultivated. The
mineral wealth consists of deposits of
uranium, coal, phosphate, limestone, iron
ore, molybdenum, manganese, lithium,
cassiterite and other ores.The Niger's output
of uranium accounts for about 10 per cent of
the world output.

22. The Republic
of Uganda
UGANDA, with a total area of some
241,000 sq. km. suffers from the
double disadvantage of being both
a least developed and a land-locked coun¬
try its major outlet to the sea is the Port of
Mombasa in Kenya, about 1,280 km. from
the capital, Kampala. In 1980 Uganda had a
population of 12.6 million. Some 90 per cent
of the population live in rural areas.
Uganda's economy is predominantly
agricultural. Over 80 per cent of the rural
population depend on agriculture for in¬
come. Over the years, Uganda's export trade
has been dominated by coffee exports, in
particular robusta coffee. Exports of cotton,
tea, tobacco, blister copper, hides and skins,
and cotton fabrics began to fall by the
mid-1970s. Tea exports declined from an
average of 16,000 tons over the period
1970-1972 to a mere 1,000 tons in 1979. Sugar
exports were reduced to negligible quan¬
tities and even the domestic market supply
faced shortages. Uganda's economy is today
experiencing deep-seated economic and
social problems. The productive base in the
agricultural, livestock, industrial and mining
sectors has been destroyed. There are acute
shortages of consumer goods and produc¬
tion inputs and as a result inflation is in the
four-digit range. The basic social services in
the health, education housing and water
supply sectors are functioning only on a
skeleton basis.
23. The Rwandese
Republic
RWANDA is a completely land-locked
country situated at the point where
Central Africa and East Africa meet,
at the centre of the region of the great lakes
and volcanoes. It occupies a land area of
26,338 square kilometres and is an essentially
mountainous country. In August 1978 total
population stood at 4.8 million, with 47.5 per
cent under the age of 15. In the health field,
the doctor:inhabitant ratio is 1:28,700 and
there is one hospital bed per 711 inhabitants.
Primary school enrolment in 1978/79
amounted to 515,700 pupils and 2.3 per cent
of pupils leaving primary school went on to
post-primary education. The development of
the agricultural sector, in which 93 per cent
of Rwandese are engaged, is being
frustrated by the growing scarcity of land
and severe soil degradation. About 60 per
cent of farming families have holdings of
less than one hectare and the quality of the
land varies widely. Export earnings from
agriculture are limited with coffee as the
main ingredient. Rwanda's other natural
resources (mining and quarrying) are also
limited. The mining industry accounted for 3
per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1978.
Production is scattered throughout the
country. The principal products are
cassiterite and ferberite.
24. The Independent
State of
Western Samoa
SAMOA is an island country in the South
Pacific which attained independence
in 1962. It consists of seven islands
with a total land area of about 2,850 square
kilometres and a total population of about
161,000. roughly half of which is under the
age of 20. About three-quarters of the
population live on Upolu island and most of
the remainder on Savaii island. Subsistence
agriculture is the principal occupation. Ex¬
port crops are copra, cocoa and taro. In addi¬
tion there are large forestry resources. The
manufacturing sector, which accounts for
only a small share of Gross Domestic Pro¬
duct, comprises some medium-size plants
that produce beer, cigarettes, animal feed
and matches. Life expectancy at birth is
about 63 years; infant mortality is about 37
per 1,000. The level of education is
reasonably good and literacy in the ver¬
nacular is almost universal. About 70 per
cent of children attend secondary school.
The Samoan economy suffers from a
number of handicaps: the country's isolation
and remoteness from the rest of the world;
lack of mineral resources; relatively small
fishing zone; heavy dependence on foreign
trade; vulnerability to fluctuations in world
prices of copra and cocoa; shortage of skill¬
ed manpower (emigration is estimated at
about 2,000 a year).

25. The Somalia
Democratic Republic
26. The Democratic
Republic of the Sudan
27. The United Republic
of Tanzania
SOMALIA is located in the Horn of Africa
and has a total land area of 638,000 sq.
km. The annual rainfall is meagre and
irregular, creating the constant threat of
drought. The economy of Somalia is at pre¬
sent heavily burdened by the influx of
refugees into the country as a result of the
Ogaden conflict and the drought in the sur¬
rounding areas. In addition to the normal
resident population there are at present
about 1.25 million refugees in camps and
800,000 more spread all over the country. The
present resident population is estimated at 5
million (excluding refugees). Of the total,
2.8 million are nomadic, 1.1 million settled
rural population, and 1.1 million live in urban
areas. Almost 47 per cent of the total popula¬
tion consists of children under the age of 15.
The infant mortality rate is 177 per 1,000 and
the overall life expectancy is 41 years. The il¬
literacy rate is estimated at 30 per cent.
Agricultural and allied activities are the oc¬
cupation of 80 per cent of the labour force
and generate 60 per cent of the Gross
Domestic Product. Livestock is Somalia's
most important renewable resource and
generates 75 per cent of export earnings. It is
estimated that there are 5.2 million camels
2.74 million head of cattle, 9.43 million sheep
and 15.12 million goats. The coastal waters
of the country have a substantial fishery
potential, but at present the fishing industry
is undeveloped.
THE Sudan, with a land area of 2.5 million
sq. km. is the largest country in Africa.
It has a population of only 18 million
and unlike the situation in most other least
developed countries population growth is
not excessive. Indeed, there is often a shor¬
tage of labour which is aggravated by the
emigration of skilled workers to the oil-rich
States in the region. Life expectancy at birth
is 46 years. Nearly 80 per cent of the adult
population is illiterate and about half the
children of school age do not enter primary
school. The Nile is the backbone of the coun¬
try. It links the northern and southern
regions, is an important source of hydroelec-
tricity and is vital to agriculture. Cotton is
the dominant cash crop and for a long time
provided 80 per cent of export earnings. Dur¬
ing the past decade efforts have been made
to achieve crop diversification and produc¬
tion of groundnuts, wheat, fruit and
vegetables has increased considerably.
Since only 10 per cent of available land is at
present under cultivation there is a vast
potential for agricultural expansion. Never¬
theless, even today agriculture, including
livestock, contributes about 40 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product and nearly 95 per
cent of exports. The contribution of the in¬
dustrial sector to the economy is modest, ac¬
counting for less than 6 per cent of Gross
Domestic Product. At present there are
some import-substituting industries produc¬
ing notably textiles, sugar, cement,
footwear, soft drinks and alcoholic
beverages. Heavy industry is currently con¬
fined to cçment manufacture and some
petroleum processing.
THE United Republic of Tanzania, with a
total area of some 945,000 sq. km. of
which 5.4 per cent is arable land and
under permanent crops, has a total popula¬
tion of around 17 million, growing by 3 per
cent per annum. The urban population ac¬
counts for 13 per cent of the total population.
Average life expectancy at birth was 51 years
and infant mortality was 150 per 1,000 live
births. All health services provided by
government health institutions are free of
charge. There are serious problems caused
by nutritional déficiences. Protein malnutri¬
tion causes about 50,000 deaths among pre¬
school children every year. In 1978
agriculture constituted 39.5 per cent of the
national income (industries 9.3 per cent and
infrastructure 11.5 per cent). After in¬
dependence (1961) the major focus of atten¬
tion in agriculture was placed on: (1) the pro¬
duction of food and export crops, and (2) the
integrated development of the rural areas
which support over 90 per cent of Tanzania's
population. This new policy was embodied in
the Arusha Declaration (1967) which provides
the fundamental basis for the country's
ideology of Ujamaa (i.e. familyhood based .
on the African traditional family life of living
and working together as a unit). By focuss¬
ing on staple food production Tanzania has
been able to avoid over-all food shortages
and limit reliance on food aid to serious
drought years. According to UN data Tan¬
zania was the third most seriously affected
country and lost about an eighth of its na¬
tional purchasing power during 1972-1976 in
terms of trade deterioration.

29. The Republic
of Upper Volta
30. The Yemen
Arab Republic
No country presentation was received from
Chad and the following information, with
the exception of the figures for land area, is
taken from United Nations sources.
Land area: 1,284,000 square kilometres
Population: 4,400,000 (1979)
Life expectancy at birth: 43 years (1978)
Infant mortality rate: 160 per thousand (1978)
Adult literacy rate: 17.8 per cent (1980)
UPPER Volta is a land-locked African
country, far from any port (1,145 km.
to Abidjan by rail, 1,020 km. to Lomé
by road). It extends on either side of the
Mossi Plateau, a flat dome of rocks yielding
for the most part poor soils of low
permeability, poor in groundwater. The more
fertile and better watered Volta valleys form
a breeding ground for sandflies, vectors of
onchocerciasis (blindness) where human set¬
tlement has become possible only as a result
of campaigns to eradicate this disease. The
climate is hot and dry. The population in 1975
numbered 5,638,203 of whom 5,127,000 lived
in rural areas. The population is young, with
17.3 per cent aged between 0-4 and 24.9 per
cent between 5 and 14. Population pressures
result in massive emigration to the coastal
countries. Of the economically active
population, 91.8 per cent are employed in
agriculture. 3.5 per cent in industry, and 4.7
per cent in the tertiary sector. Wage earners
number 41,600. The main crops are food
crops. Less than 15 per cent is marketed, the
remainder being consumed by the pro¬
ducers. The illiteracy rate is 92.5 per cent.
Upper Volta has scarce energy resources
apart from wood, which supplies the
necessary energy for cooking meals but at
the cost of alarming deforestation.
THE Yemen Arab Republic has a land
area of about 195,000 sq. km. and is
located in the south-western part of
the Arabian Peninsula. In 1980 population
was estimated at 6.5 million. Life expectancy
at birth is 35.7 years for females and 38.3 for
males. Literacy barely exceeds 10 per cent.
Agriculture, in which 83 per cent of the
population is engaged, is still considered the
leading sector in the national economy, but
its relative importance has declined substan¬
tially in recent years to about 29 per cent of
Gross Domestic Product. Output consists
mainly of food grains and livestock pro¬
ducts. Between 1966 and 1981 the contribu¬
tion of manufacturing industry to Gross
Domestic Product was 5 per cent. Since 1962
new industries have been set up including
textiles, cement, oilseeds, cigarettes,
plastics, sweets and soft drinks. Approx¬
imately 20 per cent of the labour force
(600,000 people) are temporary emigrants to
the Gulf States and in particular to Saudi
Arabia. While their remittances have provid¬
ed a welcome boost to Yemen's balance of
payments, development projects in the
country are suffering from the resultant
shortage of manpower, both skilled and un¬
skilled. Other constraints to the develop¬
ment of Yemen include organizational and .
administrative problems, a low resource
base, the mountainous nature of the country
and scarcity of water resources.

31. The People's
Democratic
Republic of Yemen
DEMOCRATIC Yemen, which attained
independence in 1967, covers a land
area of about 337,000 sq. km. and has
a population estimated in 1980 at 1.9 million.
The country's principal resources, other than
human, are fisheries, the port of Aden, the
Aden oil refinery, and salt. Life expectancy
at birth is about 46 years; the infant mortality
rate is about 114 per 1,000. There are 1.1 doc¬
tors per 10,000 inhabitants. The illiteracy rate
is estimated at about 80 per cent. Agriculture
is limited to about 80,000 hectares (0.2 per
cent of the total land area), principally
because of the water shortage. The rainy
season is brief and unreliable. There is some
irrigation from underground water. The
pasture land is extensive but vegetation is
sparse. About 40 per cent of the labour force
is employed in the agricultural sector.
Livestock production accounts for about half
of the total value of the output of the
agricultural sector, but falls far short of
meeting the demand of consumption.
Thanks to a fairly long coastline (1,200
kilometres) Democratic Yemen possesses
substantial fish resources which are a major
source of export earnings. In addition to the
Aden oil refinery, the industrial sector covers
salt production, mining and quarrying, the
production of goods of agricultural origin
(foodstuffs, cigarettes, textiles, leather
goods) and some import-substitute in¬
dustries such as paints, matches, plastic pro¬
ducts, tiles, nails, etc.). The major con¬
straints hampering development are the
poor endowment of natural resources, the
adverse climate, the rugged terrain and the
shortage of technical and managerial skills.

### 186457: African youth between tradition and modernity

African youth
between tradition
and modernity
by Boubakar Ly
The United Nations has proclaimed 1985 International
Youth Year and, as a major contribution to its prepara¬
tion, Unesco has just published Youth in the 1980s (see
inside back cover). The book includes a synthesis
report on the prospects for youth in the present
decade, which was presented to the General Con¬
ference of Unesco at its twenty-first session, and a
panorama of the situation of young people around the
world. The article below is based on extracts from a
chapter devoted to the rapidly changing world of
African youth.
Abrief examination of the position of
youth in traditional African society
reveals certain characteristic fea¬
tures. The first is the limited and relatively
small-scale character of traditional society,
which was organized on ethnic, tribal, clan
and lineage rather than on national lines.
The real social group was often made up of
the living descendants of a known common
ancestor. The latter were grouped together
within! the villages, where they were
members of other non-kinship groups such
as age-groups and affinity groups.
The whole social system was held
together by regard for the ancestors, who
were the cornerstone and guarantors of the
social order. Tradition legitimized by the
ancestors was the main factor for social
integration.
Young Africans grew up in this social and
ethical context. Indeed, either individually or
collectively they were taken in hand by the
community and its various institutions and
personalities at every stage of their lives.
From earliest youth their families taught
them to live within a broad social setting;
and this eventually accustohned them to'the
presence of others.
The community at large for its part show¬
ed them adults as interchangeable, and gave
every adult the right to take part in their up-

turer in sociology at the University of Dakar. He is

Modernity", his contribution to Youth in the
1980s, just published by Unesco (see inside back
cover).

bringing. Similarly with age-groups, which
acted as a finishing-school by giving young
people a collective education consisting
essentially of training for independence.
Education was in general diffuse, infor¬
mal, pragmatic and functional. Vocational
training formed no small part of it: in tradi¬
tional African society it was one of the
dimensions of human kind, for it was part of
life. Training was progressive, in step with
the acquisition of maturity in life. Vocational
training was concerned inter alia to
reproduce the position of the father, mother
or other person in charge of the child. Social
and occupational mobility were unknown in
this kind of society. The reproduction of the
position of the "authorities" in charge of the
young person was facilitated by family tradi¬
tion, which acted here as a justificatory
ideology. Tradition as ideology served to fix
the young person in his or her occupation
and place in society. In other words, society
suggested to young people that their place
in society was prestigious because it was
that of the founding ancestors and all their
descendants from time immemorial.
In such a context work of whatever kind
carried prestige. Young people accepted
and loved their trades. They were in a hurry
to finish their training and take their place in
the family production structures, which
society skilfully portrayed as imbued with
both honour and prestige.
Once their training was complete, young
people were started off in life by society.
This "starting-off", be it noted, took place
when society judged it opportune. It took
the form of declaring the young person's in¬
dividuality within the community. The
young man or woman came in a sense to
model his or her life on that of the group.
Traditional African society neither allowed
nor encouraged young people to become in¬
dependent. "Liberation" in traditional socie¬
ty consisted of splitting off in order to
become more firmly embedded in the group.
Young people did, of course, show signs of
impatience and rebellion, but these were the
marks of their eagerness to acquire as soon
as possible the freedom to take root.
Society as such was never challenged. No
one tried to break away from parental care
and start life elsewhere: indeed, young peo¬
ple aimed rather to integrate themselves into
society by becoming more responsible and
playing a part in perpetuating it. The act of
freedom lay in the will to play a part in
perpetuating society. Once young people
became responsible members of society,
they helped to perpetuate it by up-dating at
their level the traditional models of authori¬
ty, which were in fact distinctively African
cultural models.
Reference to models of authority and
dignity was facilitated by another aspect of
the education of young people, namely the
teaching of history.
This society was, after all, founded on the
ancestors: and consequently it was con¬
tinual reference to them (and hence to the
history of the group) that helped to forge,
sustain and reinforce the sense of belonging
to a community. The history of the group
was young people's constant companion;
they were steeped in it, because they were
always in the line of descent. Genealogy was
not merely a fact, it was also a value.
Ancestry had prestige value, like a coat of
arms. The roll-call of ancestral names was a
matter of pride. When consciously asserted
it served to make the young man or woman
part of an honourable line, within an
honoured structure.
This continual reference to the history of
the family, through mythical or legendary
ancestors and some actual heroes, was an
effective technique of psychological integra¬
tion, designed to reinforce community spirit
by broadening its base so as to make it in
some respects comparable to present-day
national pride.
The existence of this community spirit
was a major factor in developing in young
people the readiness to serve already
fostered by their family education.
The system of values was such that youth
had a duty to serve. Any youngster was
available and could be called on at any time
by any adult or by the community to do a
service. Community service was thus far
from being a chore; it was part of life. By
and large, African youngsters in traditional
society, as turned out by the educational
system, were characterized by a number of
inter-related traits, namely the habit of living
with other people, willingness to serve,
sense of identification with their parents, ac¬
ceptance of their lot and devotion to their
trade, dedication to the values of the com¬
munity, and acute awareness of member¬
ship of and identification with the group.

### 186457: African youth between tradition and modernity

These traits combined with others to pro¬
duce a type of African man who has been
represented as the epitome of "peasant
humanism".
African youth, which in the traditional
period attracted attention for its adaptation
to society, began to set society problems
and to see itself as a problem when African
society underwent radical changes. These
changes were primarily introduced by col¬
onization, but were then taken up and
developed on new lines by the independent
régimes.
The problems of youth have taken on a
new aspect in modern society. The latter
developed out of colonization, and has cer¬
tain characteristic features: market
economy, complex organic division of
labour, population growth, emergence of
towns and the formation of national political
entities. Moreover, it is part of a world
characterized by unequal development, by
colonial, neocolonial and generally im¬
perialist domination.
It is in this general context that youth has
become a problem and society has become
a problem for young people. It is difficult to
separate youth from other social groups, as
is often done. Its problems are bound up
with those of society as a whole, their
specificity has probably been exaggerated.
It can be argued that the essential feature
of the position of modern youth is failure to
integrate. Modern African youth is malad¬
justed, both objectively and psychologically,
to society. There are several reasons for this.
Probably one of the most remarkable
phenomena of contemporary African socie¬
ty is population growth and the number of
young people. In 1976, of a total popula¬
tion of 413,000,000, 253,469,000 or some¬
what more than half were young people
below the age of 24. The annual average
growth rate of the population of Africa from
1975 to 1980 has been estimated at 2.8 per
cent.
This general population growth has been
accompanied by an internal rearrangement
of the structure of society; and paradoxical
as it may seem, scope for the individual's in¬
tegration into society has diminished.
What has happened is that the social
group in which young people grow up has
become narrower, kinship no longer being
as important as it used to be. Clans and
lineages have disappeared and been replac¬
ed by the extended family, and in the cities
by the nuclear family that is now taking
over. This narrowing of the social field is ac¬
companied by a process of individuation.
The individual is becoming a sociological
fact.
The extent to which nuclear families and
individuals are becoming independent has,
however, been exaggerated. In the country¬
side the problem does not arise, whilst in the
towns relatively extensive kinship networks
still exist. Nuclear families and individuals
form part of social networks, and it is rare to
find either quite alone. There is always some
kin in the background: if necessary it may be
some form of surrogate. It is, after all, com¬
mon in Africa to find that where no real
(biological) kinship exists a surrogate
(social) kinship takes its place. It is in this
context that modern youth must be con¬
sidered. The social system in which it is
growing up is new, but retains some of the
characteristics of traditional society.
The State has replaced the traditional clan
community as the all-embracing society on
which modern African young people de¬
pend. From now on it is the State that gives
them their political status and nationality,
and also takes over responsibility for their
education. In other words, an abstract, ra¬
tional, bureaucratic grouping unconnected
with the family has replaced a concrete
grouping based on emotional ties and linked
with the family because rooted in kinship.
Moreover this new phenomenon, the
State, is not the result of the inner
dynamism of African society. To establish
itself, it had to "cut into the flesh" and
replace what Lévi-Strauss calls "home¬
made models". The African State was
established from outside, which explains
why it is not always functional in relation to
the pre-existing social structures, even
though African societies have adopted it
and (in the sociological sense of the word)
reinterpreted certain aspects of it.
Nowadays there is practically nothing any
more between the family and the State, and
many sectors of traditional education that
were presided over by intermediate institu¬
tions such as age-groups, initiation groups
and the adult community have fallen by the
wayside. The modern family can no longer
undertake them, and the State as conceived
is not designed for such tasks. Hence
education today is in smithereens, and the
State, which has replaced the all-embracing
community, accepts responsibility for only
one aspect of education t- intellectual
training.
All contemporary African societies sup¬
port the current world movement according
to which elementary education is the right of
every citizen. The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights lays an obligation on all
States signatories to the Charter of the
United Nations to give their citizens elemen¬
tary education. At Addis Ababa in 1961
Africa adopted a resolution under which all
participating States undertook to achieve
universal compulsory education by 1980.
The obstacles they encountered in fulfilling
the objective were discussed at the Nairobi,
Lagos and many other conferences.
Despite the considerable efforts that have
been made, Africa today is still a continent
in which ignorance is pretty well-developed.
In 1970 it accounted for 18.7 per cent of
total world illiteracy for the 15 and over age-
group. This figure is expected to reach
19.7 per cent in 1990. For the same year
(1970) African illiterates from 15 to 19 made
up 26.8 per cent of the world total for this
age-group. In 1975 51.5 per cent of children
from 6 to 1 1 , 31 .2 per cent of those from 12
to 17 and 5.8 per cent for those from 18 to
23 were enrolled in schools. In all only
32.3 per cent of young people from 6 to 23
were at school. The school-attendance rate
for this age-bracket was expected to reach
41.8 per cent in 1980. The percentage of
girls attending school for the period
1965/1975 is 6.8. Hence a great many young
people are still outside the educational
system. Since the extra-familial training "in¬
stitutions have virtually ceased to exist,
some young people are thus left without any
collective training. Those in rural areas may
still, in default of a general education, be
taught a trade. This is more than can be said
of urban youth, who are often doomed to
receive no schooling but that of the streets.
The second difficulty that modern schools
encounter flows from the fact that they no
longer train the complete man. The effect of
their approach is to fragment what was once
an all-round education. African societies did
not have schools: they represent a cultural
phenomenon from the history of other
civilizations. The school, in its classic form,
is concerned with only part of map's
psychological whole, namely the intellect.
Intellectual training has now replaced all-
round education, and modern Afrirjan
schools are concerned with only one side of
a child's personality. The result is that a
cieavage has developed that affects the
structure of the personality. Children
operate within two unconnected worlds,
family and school. The point has been made
that in Africa "starting school" represents
entry to a cold, abstract, rational, intellec¬
tual world quite different from the emotional
world of the family. It is true that this
cleavage between the two worlds is a
universal phenomenon and that in all
societies going to school for the first time is
traumatic for children. Nevertheless, in the
case of Africa there is the further point that
school and family represent different
cultural worlds. The cleavage between
school and family tends to persist, like the
fragmentation of the educational process.
Schools are divorced from society. The
transition from family to school means mov¬
ing from one language to another. The use
of a foreign language is in itself an alienating
factor; but then so is the subject-matter
taught. Specialists have been very struck by
the unsuitability of school syllabuses.
African cultural situations do not occur in
the texts set for children, and real life is not
reflected in the facts or values. The situa¬
tions, actions, behaviour, attitudes and
words used often have no African flavour. In
view of this it is hard for children fully to
understand the models they are given or to
identify with them.
The situation has the additional drawback
of instilling (often unconsciously) foreign
life-styles. Hence schools play no small part
in the alienation of young Africans, and will
probably continue to do so in the years to
come unless the situation is remedied.
Traditional society automatically saw to
the training and placing of the young, but
modern society has run into difficulties over
this. Because of the complexity of the divi¬
sion of labour, trades have proliferated and
professional mobility has increased along

division of labour, population
growth, emergence of towns and
the formation of national political
entities... Modern African youth is
maladjusted, both objectively and
psychologically, to society... What
has happened is that the social
group in which young people
grow up has become narrower,
kinship no longer being as
important as It used to be... This
narrowing of the social field is
accompanied by a process of
individuation. The individual is
becoming a sociological fact. "

### 186457: African youth between tradition and modernity

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 29
with them. Under the new system of values
in Africa, occupations have become in¬
dividualized, and young people no longer
necessarily ply their parents' trades. They
have in a sense been "liberated", but only at
a price. Apart from the peasantry and cer¬
tain craft industries, families no longer pro¬
vide vocational training. The State, which
has replaced the traditional collective institu¬
tions, does not provide it either. It is active
in certain limited sectors such as education
(general or technical), and for some time has
attempted to give out-of-school training.
The state of education being what it is, a
great many young people find themselves
without any vocational training.
Nothing is done for children not attending
school, or for all those who have been
weeded out by successive selection steps or
have had to give up school for one reason or
another. These young people without voca¬
tional training make up with some adults the
mass of the unemployed.
Youth unemployment in particular has
been a matter of concern to the authorities,
especially since it has a number of causes
and effects, such as the flight from the land.
"The first evidence of unemployment
came not from statistics but from the ap¬
pearance in the towns of people who ob¬
viously had nothing to do. They came in in¬
creasing numbers, and lived in shanty
towns..."
The flight from the land is due among
other things to the unprofitability of
agricultural work and its seasonal character.
It is brought about by lack of land. The
migrants come to town to earn money. The
importance of money in modern African
societies has been noted. The monetariza-
tion of the economy drives people to go and
look for money where it is to be found, i.e.
mainly in the towns.
This has certain consequences for the
towns, such as "vagrancy", to mention only
one, though this term is not always quite ap¬
propriate. After all, it is questionable
whether "vagrancy" is the right word for
certain features of African life that are
described as such. "Vagrancy" is a relative
notion, and varies according to the cultural
context. The term is inappropriate to the
situation of those young people who come
to town on the off chance, and then live by
their wits in an economy based on living by
one's wits. For underdevelopment leads to
an attitude of "all's grist that comes to the
mill", and to the emergence of trades that
not only are not regarded as such in other
cultures but do not even exist in them.
Hence the youths you hear calling out
"Madam, let me carry your shopping bag"
or "Madam, let me look after your car", and
the paper boys and shoeshine boys found in
many African societies all "trades" plied
only by young people.
It has been stressed that those who leave
are the marginals of the community: but this
is not always the case. Those who
leave especially the young people are the
representatives of the community. Hence
migration is an organized affair, as it often
was in traditional society. The young have
all the more reason to leave because they
realize that the low profitability of
agriculture does not always allow them to
make a living. New needs have appeared
both in the country and the towns. The
flight from the land may be expected to con¬
tinue in the years ahead, and even to be in¬
tensified by the economic crisis.
In a society needs are related to historical
and cultural development. In the case of
Africa, young people in modern society can¬
not have the same needs as their parents at
their age. They aspire to certain forms of
consumption offered by modern society.
They also experience a state of affairs that
their parents could in the nature of things
not experience, namely boredom. Nothing
worthwhile happens in town or coun¬
try still less in the country than in
the towns. Youth does not feel itself involv¬
ed in any "grand design" or general
mobilization. Furthermore, now that
modern society has lost its sense of fun,
young people no longer enjoy themselves in
a worthwhile way.
What young people come to town to look
for is a chance to be. Here the idea of magic
combines with the spirit of adventure. Peo¬
ple go to town because something might
happen there that certainly does not happen
in the country. Migration is therefore a way
of achieving freedom, all the more because

### 186457: African youth between tradition and modernity

young people can no longer feel at home,
especially after being introduced at school
to a modern cultural world with which they
can no longer fully identify. Nor can they
any longer fully identify with their parents,
though remaining emotionally attached to
them. Very often when asked about their
parents young people reply that they are
"decent folk" who make considerable
sacrifices and work for a pittance. They also
reproach them (and this shows how deeply
they resent their situation) with accepting
their lot. Their parents' occupations are no
longer regarded as prestigious, and by and
large young people have lost interest in
manual pursuits. In other words, a very im¬
portant factor for social integration, which
worked normally in traditional society, can
no longer do so.
Unable to identify with their parents,
young people are sometimes faced with
problems of authority. They often reproach
adults with no longer having authority and
no longer knowing how to bring them
up in short, with no longer taking them in
hand as they would like to be taken. The
question is how parents are to re-establish
their authority, and how young people are to
be persuaded to ply manual trades. The
future will increasingly see a rift between the
situation of parents and the aspirations of
young people, especially among the peasan¬
try and the urban rank and file.
Unfortunately the crisis of authority in
modern society often leads to delinquency.
Delinquents are generally in an abnormal
family situation. Merely moving from coun¬
try to town does not automatically produce
delinquency; it all depends on the situation
they are moving into. In most cases delin¬
quents find themselves in a social (and par¬
ticularly a family) vacuum. Young people
very often turn to the State, asking of it
something it cannot give. The same is true
of those parents who, reacting as they
would have done in traditional society, try to
hand over to the State in this case to the
police children they have difficulty in con¬
trolling. The State often only acts when the
misdemeanour has been committed, and
then applies repressive remedies.
This State intervention after the event il¬
lustrates the difficulties facing modern
African society. The family as a factor for
social cohesion is not supported by institu¬
tions in our all-embracing society. Modern
society does not take responsibility for
young people (or does so badly); and in view
of this vacuum they withdraw into
themselves and try to find their own solu¬
tions. The social vacuum will become more
acute, and young people are increasingly
turning in on themselves in order to fill it.
This brings us to the problem of
psychological integration through con¬
sciousness of belonging to a nation, i.e. na¬
tional awareness.
Traditional society managed by continual
reference to the history of the group to
create an awareness of shared allegiance,
attachment to lasting values and acceptance
of society's goals. Modern society, despite
the attempts that have been made, is not
quite able to bring about and sustain a
minimal awareness of belonging to a single
group, because of ideological and political
divisions. There are also the difficulties that
stem from ethnic and tribal differences,
which although they have sometimes been
exaggerated are nevertheless real. Modern
African youth is thus often deprived of an
important dimension in the shaping of its
social and cultural personality, namely an
opportunity to identify with the group and
its shared values. In Africa the State, which
as has often been shown preceded the na¬
tion, has the historic task of building na¬
tional awareness. This national awareness is
inseparable from awareness of political
"Africanity": they are dialectically linked.
Here again the integration of youth presup¬
poses that modern African societies find
suitable ways of inculcating in it the idea of
its "Africanity", in which cultural values play
a considerable part.
This task will be the easier because
despite all the difficulties mentioned African
youth is not incurably alienated. The striking
thing in Africa, and this needs emphasizing,
is the strength of tradition. Traditional
African society is still alive; it has extra¬
ordinary powers of survival and hence of
recovery.

attempts that have been made,
is not quite able to bring about
and sustain a minimal

single group, because of
ideological and political
divisions... Modern African
youth is thus often deprived of
an important dimension in the

Unesco Peace Education Prize
Awarded for First Time
Finnish adult educator Helena Kekkonen
and the World Organization of the Scout
Movement jointly received the first award of
the $60,000 Unesco Prize for Peace Educa¬
tion at a ceremony held on 1 October at
Unesco's Paris HQ. The Prize, created by
Unesco's Executive Board in 1980, was
made possible by a $1 million gift from the
Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation.
During the ceremony, the Director-General
of Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
pointed to the urgent need for steps to
stimulate public opinion and mobilize cons¬
ciences to build peace based "upon the in¬
tellectual and moral solidarity of mankind",
as enjoined by Unesco's constitution.
International Literacy
Awards for 1981
International prizes for outstanding work in
literacy teaching were recently awarded to
educators in Cuba, India and Angola. The
1981 Nadezhda Krupskaya Prize, sponsored
by the USSR, went to the Federation of
Cuban Women for its participation in Cuba's
mass literacy campaign. The prize donated
by the International Reading Association
was awarded to the Department of Adult
Education of Bihar State (India) whose pro¬
gramme led to the creation of 8,000 centres
for 240,000 participants. The Noma Prize
was won by the National Literacy Commis¬
sion of the People's Republic of Angola
which has made literate more than
500,000 persons simultaneously in Por¬
tuguese and in one of the 6 national
languages. Speaking at the awards
ceremony, held at Unesco HQ in Paris on In¬
ternational Literacy Day (8 September),
Unesco's Director-General Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow pointed out that while the
world illiteracy rate was falling, the absolute
number of illiterates had risen from
742 million in 1970 to 800 million today. If
current trends continue, he warned, there
would be more than one billion illiterates by
the end of the century.
Fair Play Awards
for Outstanding Footballers
Two outstanding figures of the football
world, Giacento Facchetti, 94 times capped
and 70 times captain of Italy, and Sir
Stanley Rous of the UK who for many years
headed the International Federation of Foot¬
ball Associations, received Pierre de Couber-
tin Fair Play Trophies for 1980 at a ceremony
at Unesco's Paris headquarters on 6 Oct¬
ober. Five other sportsmen received
diplomas of honour in recognition of sports¬
manship. They were Fernande Schmidt,
cross-country runner of Luxembourg,
Stefan Branth and Gert Petterson, Swedish
orienteering runners, Stanislav Olszewski,
Polish cross-country motor cyclist, and
Georgi Sinko, Hungarian cross-country run¬
ner. A diploma of honour was also awarded
to Guru Hanuman, former Indian wrestling
champion.

Julian Huxley Memorial Appeal
A Memorial Fund has been created to com¬
memorate the life and work of Sir Julian
Huxley (1887-1975), the distinguished British
scientist who was Unesco's first Director-
General. The range of Julian Huxley's in¬
terests and genius took him beyond the
boundaries of science to the practical
problems of human development, notably in
his pioneering work on conservation and
population control. One of his greatest gifts
was to make the complexities of science ac¬
cessible to the layman. If the necessary
funds can be provided, Balliol College Ox¬
ford (where Sir Julian was an under¬
graduate) and the Royal Society of the UK
have agreed to establish a "Julian Huxley
Memorial Research Fellowship" for study in
the biological or human sciences, and
especially fields in which Julian Huxley was
himself interested such as evolution,
genetics, population, ethology and ecology.
At least £100,000 is required for an adequate
endowment of the Fellowship, which will be
tenable for 3 years at Balliol and open to
men and women from any country. Those
wishing to contribute to the Julian Huxley
Memorial Fund should address their remit¬
tance to: Peter G. Roberts, Esq., The Bur¬
sar, Balliol College, Oxford, UK..
World Food Day
Representatives of Unesco Member States,
international organizations and French
associations connected with development
and the struggle against hunger are observ¬
ing the first World Food Day at Unesco HQ
in Paris on 16 October, the 36th anniversary
of the foundation of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Na¬
tions (FAO). World Food Day, which will be
an annual event, has been proclaimed by the
UN General Assembly and the Conference
of the FAO in order to increase public
awareness of global food problems and to
provide an annual occasion for renewed
commitment to measures to vanquish world
hunger. Governments, non-governmental
organizations, schools, communities and
the media in many countries are marking
World Food Day with a wide variety of
events and activities. Educational materials
connected with the Day can be obtained
free from World Food Day Secretariat, FAO,

UNHCR Wins Nobel Peace
Prize for Second Time
The Office of the United Nations High Com¬
missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been
awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize for Peace in
recognition of its work on behalf of "the
enormous and growing number of
refugees" around the world. This is the
second time that UNHCR has been awarded
the Nobel Prize. The first was in 1954 when
it was honoured for resettling European
refugees after World War II. Under the
leadership of High Commissioner Poul Hart-
ling, UNHCR currently assists about
10 million refugees or displaced persons
throughout the world.
