Motherhood in Marble
This marble Mother and Child (43 cm high) was executed in 1913 by Jacob Epstein
(born New York 1880-died London 1959), who became one of the most influential
sculptors of his time. Its extreme simplification of forms and smooth surfaces are
characteristic of the works he produced when strongly influenced by Cubism and
African sculpture. The artist later moved away from this style and is perhaps best
known for his monumental religious and allegorical figures, and as a portraitist
who forcefully rendered the nuances of character. Group shown here is now in
the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

"The developing countries are facing an
unprecedented challenge, that of mastering
science and technology, in the shortest
possible time, in order to ensure their
survival." These words of Unesco Director-
General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow were
addressed to the 5,000 delegates from some
150 countries attending the United Nations
Conference on Science and Technology for
Development, held in Vienna from 20 to 31
August 1979. They sum up the basic theme of
the Conference whose purpose was to find
ways of strengthening the scientific and
technological capacities of developing
countries and to relate science and
technology more directly to the development
process itself. These preoccupations are also
reflected in this issue of the Unesco Courier.

### 44796: Science and technology: the development dilemma
Science and technology:
the development dilemma
by Ibrahim Helmi Abdel Rahman
CAN the developing countries take
advantage of available technology to
further their own development along
lines suited to their needs? This important
but so far unresolved question was the
underlying theme of the United Nations
Conference on Science and Technology for
Development, held in Vienna from 20 to 31
August 1979.
During the early 1950's, development
economists hoped that the latecomers to
technological advance would so to speak
ride on the bandwagon of technology and
achieve accelerated development without
paying the high costs of research or having
to run the risks of innovation. As it turned
out in practice, this hope was not universally
nor adequately realized. To many it seemed
that the developing countries were, on the
contrary, being crushed under the wheels of
the technology bandwagon. Even in those
cases where technology was successfully
transferred and applied in some developing
countries, the development which resulted
seemed to be merely an extension of
Western patterns and not really attuned to
the prevailing social and cultural conditions.
So the question remains with us and the
delegations that flocked to Vienna have
gone back home to reconsider policies, pro¬
grammes and procedures of technological
developments and applications. Some
general principles seem to have been re¬
asserted by the Vienna conference. These
include the need to strengthen the scientific
and technological capacities of the develop¬
ing countries and to restructure the existing
patterns of international scientific and
technological relations. The conference did
not, however, reach complete agreement
about two major aspects of the problem: the
role of transnational enterprises, and the
conditions of technology acquisition and
transfer agreements; these will continue to
be the subject of further discussion and con¬
flicting claims in many forums. Agreement
was achieved on strengthening the role of
the United Nations system in the field of
science and technology and on a modest ex¬
pansion of voluntary contributions to sup¬
port international co-operation.
Can we, then, expect that the developing
countries will be more successful in the
coming years in grasping the elusive new
technology, without themselves being
caught in its web? One critically relevant fac¬
tor is that of the integration of technology
and development in the developing coun¬
tries. In the past, because of certain short¬
comings of their own as well as cir¬
cumstances imposed upon them, the
developing countries have handled science,
technology and development almost as
three separate, independent, partial
systems; yet the successful development of
technology and its application, in any

### 44796: Science and technology: the development dilemma
Science and technology lie at
the very heart of development,
but harnessing them rationally
and equitably is turning out to
be much harder than it once
seemed. Only a matter of years
ago, few foresaw the limitations
and constraints on the rapid
transfer of science and
technology from the
industrialized countries to the
developing world. Among the
most urgent challenges today
are the linking of scientific
activities to technologies that
best serve development
priorities and the promotion of
technological capabilities within
each country as a step towards
real autonomy in decision¬
making. Here, two examples of
international co-operation in the
late 1970s. Dome (left) of an

society needs a process of integration and
harmonization between these three closely
interrelated systems.
Science, which is the search for
knowledge through the logic of observation,
inference, deduction and experimentation,
is increasingly becoming the foundation and
origin of many technologies. Scientific
endeavour is not aimed at application and
scientific efforts are judged successful and
become accepted (but not necessarily for
ever uncontested) on the basis of their own
logic of observation and deduction and not
on the basis of the use made of them. Scien¬
tific studies are explorative and con¬
templative and scientists must be left free to
widen the frontiers of human knowledge,
and open new paths to the unknown,
whether in the exploration of the innermost
structure of matter or the widest reaches of
the space-time continuum. The theories of
science are logical structures invented by
science as temporary "scaffolds" to build
knowledge. They are dispensable, and may
eventually be replaced by others. Science
attempts to match theories to observations,
and predict phenomena from theories and k
previous observations. Y

### 44796: Science and technology: the development dilemma
Technology, on the other hand, is the
' knowledge of "how" to get things done.
Technology is older than science and just as
not all science has practical technological
application, so not all technology has a
known scientific basis. Domestication of
animals, fishing, hunting, fire, agriculture,
metal implements are all very ancient
technologies, which man acquired, by trial,
error, and inventiveness, centuries before
acquiring the scientific basis of animal
husbandry, plant breeding, heat and fric-
tional energy and modern metallurgy.
Technology, therefore, is acquired through
practice and also even by chance, develop¬
ing through trial and error. Its success can
only be judged by application and use.
Technology as knowledge does not lead
to application unless certain other factors
are present, which in the modern language
of economics are called entrepreneurship
and factors of production. The water-wheel
and the windmill, and even the steam-
rotator-jet, were all known in their rudimen¬
tary form long before the specific conditions
arose in which they could be fully applied
and developed. Thousands of "inventions"
are patented every year, but only a few of
them find their way to application. Many
steps are needed to move a piece of
"technology information" from the stage of
knowledge to the stage of production,
which will satisfy the economic and social
criteria of application, namely profitability
and use by a client. The proof of the "pud¬
ding" of technology is in the "eating" by a
customer.
In certain cases the customer is ready to
try all possible new ideas irrespective of
cost. This is the case of war, hence the
association, quite logical, between military
expenditure and the surge of innovations.
Because of this association, technology has
mistakenly been considered to be evil in
itself.
Technology was, and still is, transferred
through the movement of men and goods.
The necessary conditions and factors of
useful application cannot however be
transferred from one place to another.
Hence the obvious, almost trivial, observa¬
tion, that the mere transfer of knowledge or
know-how does not by itself ensure suc¬
cessful application. It is easy then to ap¬
preciate the difficulty of achieving
technological advance in a country where
there is no base of previous experience, nor
the conditions and factors for successful ap¬
plication.
But this is exactly what the developing
countries are trying to do, and what the ad¬
vanced countries are advising them to do.
Much modern technology information is
openly available, and specific technologies,
protected by patent, can be transferred at a
price. The real difficulties are at the receiving
end, namely in the developing countries,
which do not have the technological capaci¬
ty to apply the open knowledge, nor to app¬
ly the know-how bought from outside, even
when it is fairly priced and properly selected.
This is almost a typical "chicken and egg"
situation, which requires a careful manipula¬
tion, to build up the technological capacity
gradually and selectively by interlocking it in
stages with economic activities of design
and production. This is a difficult and
delicate operation, without which
technology slips through the fingers of the
developing countries whenever they try to
seize it.

The brain-drain is an example of how
elusive technology can be. A developing
country attempts to build a strong and
qualified "human base" of highly educated
personnel in the different branches of
science and technology. But, once
qualified, many of the trainees fail to find
satisfying jobs corresponding to their voca¬
tion and training. The level of remuneration
and availability of equipment and facilities
are such that they are lured back to their
training grounds abroad or shift to ad¬
ministrative or other jobs for which their
sophisticated training is unnecessary. Those
who stay in universities and local research
institutes are forced to lower the standards
of their scientific activities. Herein lies the
paradox you cannot get science and
technology moving in a developing country
without trained personnel, and you cannot
keep those persons, unless you have a
strong science and technology set-up.
Another example is the establishment of
research institutes. In many instances a start
is made with foreign imported equipment,
foreign personnel, and problems not
specifically pertinent to the local environ¬
ment. Attempts are made to identify pro
blems of local relevance to agriculture, in¬
dustry, housing and other branches. The in¬
dustry and business communities in princi¬
ple would like to benefit from the national
research and development centres, but they
find them, naturally, rather inadequate to
handle the current jobs of designing an in¬
dustrial process, or building large bridges
and dams. Business and industry invariably
play safe by seeking the experience of inter¬
national experts and firms. By-passed in this
way time after time, the national institutes
never gain enough experience to mature;-
they become remote from their own
economic and industrial community.
It should be added that the holders of
technology are not concerned with
strengthening the local technological base in
a country. They do not object to it being
done, but they cannot be expected to pay
for it. Their concern is to strike a financial
deal, which, because of ignorance or lack of
bargaining power, may include many restric¬
tive clauses, which inhibit the full benefits
accruing to the recipient country.
The constituent components of a viable
technology system include trained person¬
nel at different levels, especially technicians,

Brazil and Paraguay are collaborating in the
construction of the world's biggest
hydroelectric plant, the Itaipu dam on the
Parana River which forms the frontier
between the two countries. Some twenty-
eight thousand persons are working on this
gigantic project which when completed
should supply electricity to the whole of
Paraguay as well as consumer centres in
southern and southeastern Brazil. Aerial

research equipment and institutes, libraries
and reference facilities, scientific and
technological publications and discussion
forums, pilot and semi-industrial plants,
patents and technology transfer rules and
regulations, design and consulting services,
and appropriate financing and management
capacities. Those components are all
necessary for a healthy scientific and
technological structure, but they need to be
integrated into a combined system that
works without much and repeated outside
injection and stimulation. The building of
each component separately would be similar
to bringing together components of a clock
mechanism. The pieces of such a
mechanism are all essential, but they only
tick if put to work together.
An integrated technology system does
not become completely viable, however,
unless it is interlocked with the productive
and investment sector. It is only through the
cycle of production, marketing, profit and
saving, then re-investment, that innovations
are likely to be injected into the economic
system, and find later, directly and indirect¬
ly, the necessary financial and other support
for growth and advance.
Developing countries tend to over-invest
in equipment and under-invest in training,
management and soft technology. The in¬
itial steps of co-operation and association
between the integrated technology system
and industry should thus include the
development of soft technology to increase
productivity using human skills, with better
selection of less equipment and much im¬
proved maintenance and skills.
Increasing co-operation between
technologists and research workers on the
one hand, and entrepreneurs and business
managers on the other hand, can thus form
a starting point for a viable development ac¬
tivity. After a number of years, this co¬
operation would lead to a self-sustaining ad¬
vance, which would generate new
technology, some of which could be ex¬
ported to other developing countries. Thus
technology takes hold in the society.
The developing countries should
therefore be selective, choosing a small
number of key sectors or problems, to be
adopted as starting points for technological
development. Integrative and intensive ap¬
proaches should be adopted to ensure the
effective and gradual interlocking between
technology and production in these
specifically selected areas. ¿
Statistically speaking, the developing
countries spend on research and develop¬
ment 10 times less per capita than is spent
by the advanced countries. The developing
countries, in many cases, distribute these
limited resources on a very wide front of
sectors and problems, hence the lack of ef¬
fectiveness. With the selective and in¬
tegrated approach, the developing countries
are likely to be able adequately to finance
technology development and application in
a number of key sectors, for which they can
attain the minimum threshold of finance and
concentration of resources for effec¬
tiveness.
Three examples seem to support this
argument. The first is the case of trans¬
national enterprises, which succeed
technologically and economically in most
cases in establishing viable production units
in different branches in developing coun¬
tries. There is of course the higher bargain¬
ing and manipulative power of such enter¬
prises, but there is also the political and ad¬
ministrative power of the State with which w
they have to come to terms. The point that Y

In Malaysia a government-sponsored
research and development programme
concerned with rubber production and
processing has helped maintain the
competitiveness of natural rubber in the
face of a strong challenge from synthetic
materials. Malaysian rubber technology is

have been advising other countries on

concerns us here is the integrative aspect of
the activities of the transnationals, in which
they combine technology, capital manage¬
ment, marketing and skills and put them all
together under one control, hence realizing,
for their own objectives, the successful in¬
tegration and interlocking of technology and
production.
The second example is the colonial ex¬
ploitation system, by which agriculture and
mineral raw-material production in a
dependency or a colony was carefully plann¬
ed and supported to integrate with the in¬
dustry at the metropolitan base, using the
most modern techniques of organization, ir¬
rigation selection, grading, standardization,
inspection and supervision. Such highly ar¬
ticulated systems existed in connexion with
plantations and industrial enclaves, as well
as in the intricate systems of trading cor¬
porations and strict quality control
mechanisms, for the raw materials destined
for export, but not for the productive sec¬
tors as a whole.
The third, and perhaps the most obvious
example, is the procedure by which
technology has developed, and is develop¬
ing, in the advanced countries. It goes
through a number of steps almost identical
to the two main proposals mentioned
above, namely technology integration and
interlocking with production and economic
activities. For historical reasons, the institu¬
tions that take part in those cyclic sets of ac¬
tion have grown rather autonomously in the
Western countries, but in a more planned
manner and according to special designs in
the centrally planned economies and in
Japan.
A new surge of technological advances is
in the offing in the advanced countries, with
vitally important implications for the
developing countries. The latter cannot af¬
ford to lose any more time in building their
technological capacities, to deal with their
accumulated problems of population,
unemployment, poverty, and social change,
and in addition face the implication of the
advancing technologies of the industrialized
countries. Hence the importance of making
doubly sure that technology will not slip
again from their hands.
The development objectives in the poor
countries (as well as in the industrialized
countries) are not simply the numerical in¬
crease of goods and services available to the
citizens. There is the need for greater equity
and better income distribution, which is a
form of economic democracy necessary for
social stability and greater participation.
8
New priorities for the types of goods and
services to be produced are emerging. In the
advanced countries greater concern for the
environment and quality of life, and even¬
tually, it is to be hoped, diversion from
escalating military expenditures, are impor¬
tant factors shaping future demand. In addi¬
tion the slow population increase, longer life
expectancy and the need to escape physical¬
ly and culturally from the oppressive unifor¬
mity of modern factories and hustling urban
megacities, will move technology towards
new phases.
In the developing countries, on the other
hand, there will be more insistence on pro¬
viding the basic human needs for the in¬
creasing populations in which the number in
the "youth" age group will be multiplied two
to three times by the end of the century.
Considerable political and economic
changes will be required to shift the
priorities of production towards the more
essential services and goods, and to create
gainful employment for the billions of young
people in the working age bracket, especial¬
ly in the heavily populated countries of Asia,
and the least developed countries, which are
mostly in Africa.
The demand structure and the social
priorities are thus expected to undergo con¬
siderable changes in all countries in the next
two decades. Technology and production
capacities will have to meet these changes..
Most of the new technology will be still
generated in the advanced countries, and
will be directed in the first place to solving
their specific problems. The developing
countries will therefore have to develop their
own technologies to the greatest extent
possible and to supplement them by careful¬
ly selected and considerably adapted
technology from the outside.
The patterns of development, the social
priorities for production, the cultural iden¬
tities and value systems are all sources of
guidance and re-orientation of those com¬
plex processes of technology generation,
acquisition and application in the developing

In 1975 Brazil launched an ambitious
programme to produce alcohol from
fermented sugar cane for use as motor
fuel, either in a blend as "gasohol" or by
itself. The target is to meet one-fifth of the
country's automotive fuel requirements
with alcohol by 1980, thus reducing
dependence on imported petroleum. Brazil
is now regarded as a world leader in this
technology. Existing vehicles can run on
gasohol without engine modifications, and
several countries are now engaged in
research into the feasibility of vehicles
fuelled by pure alcohol (below).
Countries of the Andean Pact, formed in
1969 to harmonize the economic and
technological policies of its members
(Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela) have strongly criticized the way
in which existing technological transfer and
patent licensing policies have increased the
dependence of the developing on the
industrialized world. To increase control
over the development and use of
technology in their own countries, they
have launched a number of joint research
programmes. One of the first was to

### 45103: Twelve 'musts' for development
Twelve 'musts' for development
by Joao Frank da Costa
THERE is today a widespread consen¬
sus that the traditional concept of
development, which focused prim¬
arily on economic growth, needs to be
redefined. A new concept of development is
emerging, which might be summed up in
the following twelve "musts".
1. Development must be total, that is
to say it must transcend purely economic
dimensions in order to include social con¬
siderations health, living conditions
and employment and the whole dimension
of cultural and spiritual self-realization em¬
bracing creativity, quality of life, and the
rights of man.
2. Development must be original,
which is to say that imitation of models is
undesirable. This means that styles of
development should not only be diverse and
respond to country-specific economic and
current social structures, natural and human
environment and cultural integrity, but
should also be in accordance with the objec¬
tives of each country and the way it
perceives its own future. In this sense, the
notion of "gap" between developed and
developing countries acquires a different
significance. Without rejecting the objective
of reducing sharp contrasts in standards of
living, one should strive to abandon the
limited concept of "gap" which is usually
somewhat negatively defined on the basis of
external indicators and instead substitute a
positive and voluntary strategy of develop¬
ment.
3. Development must be self-
determined. This applies not only to the
capacity for selecting a development style,
but also must assure its application in order
to eliminate or at least reduce dependency
and vulnerability, to unify and amplify inter¬
nal markets and to ensure the production of
basic foodstuffs and goods.
4. Development must be self-
generated. This should not mean that full
self-reliance can be achieved by national ef¬
fort alone. Often, indeed in most instances,
self-reliance is achieved on a larger scale
than that of an individual nation, within a
broader framework, either "horizontally" by
co-operation among developing countries,
or in a "triangular" pattern, that is to say,
with the added participation of the
developed countries. In this sense, develop¬
ment must be co-operative.
5. Development must be integrated.
"Truncated" growth of certain sec¬
tors the consequence of redeploy¬
ment policies of transnational corpora¬
tions not correspond to real develop¬
ment and causes growing dependency and
vulnerability. Strong horizontal and vertical
linkages must bind together the several pro¬
ductive units (in particular between the
agricultural and the industrial sectors) and
ensure complete communication and in¬
terdependence, and full integration with na¬
tional supply and demand.
6. Development must respect the in¬
tegrity of the environment, both natural
and cultural, as well as the traditional struc¬
tures which are often necessary for the con¬
servation of a country's social cohesion.
This includes the safeguarding of the na¬
tional heritage and protection against all
forms of imposed alien values.
7. Development must be planned and
requires constant attention from and in¬
tervention by national authorities. This does
not mean, of course, the mandatory exclu¬
sion of private interest and free market
mechanisms. It appears, however, to be
generally accepted that the free play of
economic forces does not automatically lead
to an equitable diffusion of scientific and
technological potential, but instead, it leads
frequently to concentration and polarization
of capabilities and benefits in highly
developed centres. The alignment of the in¬
terest of private enterprise with national ob¬
jectives needs to be ensured by appropriate
mechanisms.
8. Development must be directed
towards a just and equitable social order
which requires for its establishment, in
general, structural transformations allowing
for the participation by all sectors of the
population in the benefits of science and
technology, and not only in their negative
effects. In developing countries, it is
necessary in particular to eliminate the
dichotomy of demand that may exist where
elites have consumption patterns similar to
those in highly developed countries, in con¬
trast to a mass which does not participate in
the market for lack of purchasing power.
9. Development must be democratic,
that is to say, it must respond to the choices
made by the population as a whole. The idea
that technological decisions are dictated by
an internal scientific-technological logic and
are self-executory must be categorically re¬
jected. The goals of society are not purely
scientific or technological and scientific and
technological considerations must not be
allowed, to impose their control. This pro¬
blem involves nothing less than the freedom
of mankind to determine its own destiny.
10. Development must not insulate
less developed countries or regions into
"reservations", where they would barely
survive and lead a marginal life far from the
main flows of growth and dynamism. On the
contrary, it should make them all participate
actively in a new optimal division of labour
which is at the heart of the objectives of the
New International Economic Order. Par¬
ticularly, such a new division of labour
should lead to structural changes in
developed countries which would promote
expansion into new types of productive ac¬
tivities. This requires a reconceptualization
of development and the design of measures
that can only be conceived in a long range
perspective.
11. Development must be innovative.
It must neither depend on the importation of
outmoded technologies from developed
countries nor even advanced technology
developed somewhere else. Only the
mastery of world scientific knowledge, in¬
cluding the knowledge which for economic
reasons has never been applied in developed
countries, can assure an original, creative
technological development.
12. Development planning must be
based on a realistic definition of na¬
tional needs and on consumption models
that are consistent with the national'
characteristics of a country including its
resources, gross national product, capacity
of accumulation, and the possibilities of in¬
tegrated interaction of science and
technology with production activities.

In countries grappling with the problem of poverty, fostering a spirit of self-reliance is as
essential as outside aid. Tanzania has developed an original approach to this problem
through the creation of its ujamaa villages, which are based on the principle of co-operative
living and working for the good of all and stress the traditions of "familyhood" (the literal
translation of the word ujamaa). The eventual aim is that most of Tanzania's agriculture
should be in the hands of "groups of people who live as a community... farming land which
would be called 'our land' by all the members". Photos show scenes from life in ujamaa
villages. (1) Women carry water for making bricks to be used in the construction of a
primary school and health centre for their village. (2) Primary school pupils of Kilinga village
give a helping hand as their parents build a new classroom with materials provided by the
Government. (3) An open-air classroom in another village. (4) Adults get reading practice;
Tanzania is waging a major campaign against illiteracy. (5) A group of Masai mothers
attend a child-care class. (6) Pupils of Inyala village harvest maize from their school farm.
Technical and agricultural training is increasingly emphasized in Tanzanian school
programmes, with self-reliance as the goal.

A widening

between
rich
and poor
900 million
people
still living
in absolute
poverty
by IM.A. Cox-George
THROUGHOUT the life-time of the
great majority of people alive today,
mankind has been obsessed with the
threat of a mutually destructive nuclear
world war. Yet this is a speculative,
hypothetical threat. Paradoxically, man has
always seemed to have an inordinate
fascination for the remote while giving scant
regard to fundamental realities that should
concern him most.
The phenomenon of "absolute poverty",
one of the greatest indignities the human
race has suffered, is one such present reality
and, although during the latter part of the
19th and the early part of the 20th century
social reformers such as Henry George in the
United States and Charles Booth and Ben¬
jamin Seebohm Rowntree in England show¬
ed their concern with this phenomenon at
the national level, it remains a reality with
which the world as a whole seems content
to co-exist.
Absolute poverty is the condition of peo¬
ple whose incomes are insufficient to main¬
tain bare physical efficiency. In Charles
Booth's words they are living "below the
poverty line". The absolutely poor are those
"trapped in conditions so limited by illiteracy
and low life-expectancy as to be denied the
very potential of the genes with which they
were born. Their basic needs are simply not
met."
The World Bank has estimated that in
1976 there were no less than 900 million peo¬
ple in the world living in absolute poverty.
To be sure, they are concentrated largely in
the developing countries, accounting for
forty per cent of their total populations. But
even in the developed countries, despite
their economic growth and the progress of
the Welfare State, there were approximately
20 million absolutely poor people in 1976.
People in this category have per capita in¬
comes of well below $200 a year, and in the v
thirty least developed countries well below Y

To feed the constantly rising world population and fight the hunger and malnutrition which
are rampant in many regions, food production must be increased. Another approach to the
problem, of particular concern to developing countries, is to reduce the enormous losses of
food after harvest. Every year millions of tons of food perish during storage, as a result of
deterioration, contamination, spillage, or attacks by insects, birds and rodents. The
introduction of modern technology may not be the only solution because traditional
methods of storage have been found to work well as long as they are in balance with the
rest of the farming system. Above, the marriage of modern technology and traditional
methods in China. Grain pours up the conveyor belt into a granary made of straw. The
outside is made as the grain flows in, and when it reaches a certain height the structure is
covered with a straw roof. Below, traditional granaries in Mali are made of clay reinforced
with timber.

### 44806: A Widening chasm between rich and poor: 900 million people still living in absolute poverty
> s 100 a year. Even on- the most optimistic
assumptions these incomes are not ex¬
pected to rise beyond $180 by 1985. Thus
the absolutely poor earn incomes equal to
half the amount it takes to maintain a pet
dog in the industrialized Western world.
The experience of the last two United Na¬
tions Development Decades offers no hope
at all for these people through the develop¬
ment process itself. The trends are all too
clear. Not only has the gap between the rich
(developed) and the poor (developing)
countries widened into a chasm, in the Third
World itself development has been uneven
and in some cases there has been a decline
in the growth rate.
The poorest nations have an infant mor¬
tality rate eight times higher than that of the
developed countries, a life expectancy one
third lower, an adult literacy rate sixty per
cent lower and a nutritional level, for one
out of every two in the population, below
minimum acceptable standards; and for
millions of infants, less protein than suffi¬
cient to permit optimum development of the
brain.
Such briefly is the profile of the absolutely
poor in today's world which, incidentally, is
predominantly young, with more than fifty
per cent of its total population under the age
of 15.
In international discussion of the problem
of poverty it has always been held that its
solution (as, indeed, that of the problem of
development generally) is primarily the
responsibility of the national governments
themselves. The developing countries
themselves, with their adoption of the no¬
tion of collective self-reliance in the Manila
Declaration and elsewhere, have tacitly ac¬
cepted this responsibility. It is therefore per¬
tinent to consider how the least developed
countries can lift themselves out of absolute
poverty as it were by their own bootstraps.
How can they contribute to growth and self-
reliance and improve their own productivity?
In doing so one does not necessarily have
to subscribe to the prevailing view. On the
contrary, one can deny its acceptability and
its applicability. The least developed na¬
tions, like the absolutely poor, are enmesh¬
ed in a web of adverse conditions which
tend to suck them further into poverty like a
drowning man caught in the quicksands.
Absolute poverty, it has been said, is the
result of both past and present neglect. In
many respects the phenomenon as it ap¬
pears today is a backwash from the colonial
era and failure to give practical effect to the
League of Nations' mandatory principle of
trusteeship. Had the colonial powers, for ex¬
ample, educated, or even offered literacy to
the peoples of the colonial territories in the
period between the wars, the profile and
dimensions of absolute poverty, given its in¬
ner dynamics, would have been entirely dif¬
ferent today.
Recent development experience clearly
reveals the inability of the governments of
many former colonial territories to deal with
the poverty problem. Nor are the poor in any
position to help themselves. Held fast in the
iron grip of appalling conditions, they are
like immature infants who have to be cared
for and brought to maturity before they can
be expected to exercise any initiative what¬
soever.
To give another analogy, the first thing to
be done to save a drowning man is to rescue
him from the water and administer first aid.
And this brings me closer to the kernel of my
own disagreement with the current conven¬
tional wisdom on this subject. The truth is
that we now live in a single world communi¬
ty and the problems of absolute poverty and
of development are world problems and, as
such, are the responsibility of the world and
not primarily of individual nations.
This viewpoint implies not only the need
for a new world economic order but for a
new world political order. This is a vast sub¬
ject. Suffice it here to say that until a ge¬
nuinely democratic world government
evolves, based not on the policeman's
philosophy but on the sacred principle of the
equality of its citizens everywhere and
guaranteeing each of them a minimum stan¬
dard of living above the poverty line, ab¬
solute poverty will remain with us.
Coming back to the question of what the
poor countries can do to help themselves,
the answer, frankly, seems to be very little;
or rather, they can do as much as a slave can
do to emancipate himself in a slave society.
The crucial point is that they must first be
helped, given the strength, as it were, to use
their muscles. And here the rest of the world
stands convicted at the bar of history.
Whether it be a matter of trade policy and
trade relations, of aid, technology and
technical assistance, or of access to capital,
the story is the same, a story of almost
criminal neglect of the fate of the poor coun¬
tries. During the first United Nations
Development Decade, 90 per cent of the
capital development of the middle-income
range of developing countries was financed
from their own domestic savings, while the
rest had practically no savings of their own.
Thus the possibility of mobilizing increased
domestic savings for investment is slim.
But there is one avenue for creating some
savings or rather for re-directing expen¬
diture, and that is the re-direction of military
expenditure; euphemistically referred to as
defence expenditure, this is, in reality, no
more than the defence of poverty. If,
without waiting for general world disarma¬
ment, the poorer countries would renounce
their claim to maintain military forces or
decide to transform them into "production
brigades", then productivity and real pro¬
duction could be increased. This would im¬
ply the end of foreign military aid and its
transformation into economic development
aid. But is such a renunciation conceivable?
Another possibility is for those poor coun¬
tries that have a substantial export trade in
primary products but are large importers of
foodstuffs to reduce exports and switch
their efforts to the production of more food,
since the internal comparative cost advan¬
tage will lie with food.
One other way in which they could
enhance their productivity would be to
adopt the most efficient technology in
everything they do. Confused at first by
various notions that have been bandied
about such as "appropriate" technology and
"intermediate" technology, they are now
realizing that what they need to speed up
the closing of the gap between them and the
rich countries is the "most efficient"
technology. Here also they need external
assistance.
In his introduction to Progress and Pover¬
ty, published in 1879, Henry George wrote:
"The present century has been marked by a
prodigious increase in wealth-producing
power. The utilization of steam and electrici¬
ty, the introduction of improved processes
and labour-saving machinery, the greater
subdivision and grander scale of production,
the wonderful facilitation of exchanges,
have multiplied enormously the effec¬
tiveness of labour.
"At the beginning of this marvellous era it
was natural to expect, and it was expected,
that labour-saving inventions would lighten
the toil and improve the condition of the
labourer; that the enormous increase in the
power of producing wealth would make real
poverty a thing of the past. Could a man of
the last century have seen, in a vision of the
future, the steamship taking the place of the
sailing vessel, the railroad train of the
wagon, the reaping machine of the scythe,
the threshing machine of the flail; could he
have heard the throb of the engines that in
obedience to human will, and for the
satisfaction of human desire, exert a power
greater than that of all the men and all the
beasts of burden of the earth combined;
could he have conceived of the hundred
thousand improvements which these only
suggest, what would he have inferred as to
the social condition of mankind?
"He would have beheld these new forces
elevating society from its very foundations,
lifting the very poorest above the possibility
of want, exempting the very lowest from
anxiety for the material needs of life; he
would have seen these slaves of the lamp of
knowledge taking on themselves the tradi¬
tional curse, these muscles of iron and
sinews of steel making the poorest
labourer's life a holiday, in which every high
quality and noble impulse could have scope
to grow."
That dream is still with us. Since the days
of Charles Booth's pioneering study on
poverty there has been considerable im¬
provement. The development among the
, poor themselves of trade unions and co-
* operatives has engendered a significant
degree of income re-distribution and an
awakening of the social conscience. The
persistent belief that the poor were responsi¬
ble for their condition has today been replac¬
ed by the philosophy of the Welfare State
that their condition is the responsibility of
the whole community and its government.
: The absolute poor of today may wish to take
this lesson to heart.

### 44807: The Candle of learning: the tragedy of neglected scientific talent in the developing world
The candle
of learning
The tragedy of
neglected
scientific talent
in the
developing world
by Abdus Salam
I would like to make a few general remarks
regarding the history of science in civili¬
zation and the way in which the history
of science has gone through various cycles.
I would like to illustrate this with a story: 750
years ago, an impoverished Scotsman left
his native glens to travel south to Toledo in
Spain. His name was Michael. His quest
was to live and work at the Arab universities
of Toledo and Cordoba, where the greatest
of Jewish scholars, Moses Bin Maimoun,
had taught a generation before.
The Toledo school, representing as it did
the finest synthesis of Arabic, Greek, Latin
and Hebrew scholarship, was one of the
most memorable of international essays in
scientific collaboration. To Toledo and Cor¬
doba came scholars, not only from the rich
countries of the East, like Syria, Egypt, Iran
and Afghanistan, but also from the im¬
poverished countries of the West, like
Scotland.
Then as now, there were obstacles to this
international scientific concourse, not least
the intellectual and economic disparity bet¬
ween different parts of the world. Men like
Michael the Scot and his contemporary
Alfred the Englishman were exceptions.
They did not then represent any flourishing
school of research in their own countries.
With the best will in the world, their
teachers at Toledo doubted the wisdom and
value of training them for advanced scien¬
tific research. At least one of his teachers
advised young Michael to go back to clip¬
ping sheep and weaving woollen cloth.
In respect of the cycle of scientific
disparities, I can be perhaps a little more
quantitative. George Sarton in his
monumental five-volume history of science
chose to divide his story of scientific
achievement into various ages, each age
lasting half a century. With each half-
century he associated one central figure.
The years 450 to 400 BC, for example, Sar¬
ton calls the age of Plato. This is followed by
the half-century of Aristotle; then of Euclid;
then of Archimedes, and so on. But then the
cycle changes. The period from 600 to
650 AD is the Chinese half-century of Hsuan
Tsang; from 650 to 700 is the half-century of
l-Ching. The 350 years from 750 to 1100 are,
in an unbroken succession, the ages of
Jabir, Khwarizmi, Razi, Masudi, Wafa,
Biruni, Omar Khayyam and so onArabs,

Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam, founder and director of the Unesco
sponsored International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, and pro¬
fessor of theoretical physics at the Imperial College of Science and
Technology, London, has been awarded the 1979 Nobel prize for physics.
The prize, which he shares with two American physicists, Sheldon
Glashow and Steven Weinberg of Harvard University, was awarded for
work in electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles. In the
words of the citation, the three physicists' theoretical work constitutes
"an enormous step" in the search for an underlying physical principle of
the universe. One of the goals of modern physics has been the elaboration
of a "unified field theory" (a task to which Einstein devoted the latter part
of his life) that would demonstrate that the four basic physical
forces electromagnetism, gravitation, the strong atomic interaction and
the weak atomic interaction were in reality different aspects of a single
basic force. The theory elaborated by the three Nobel laureates, since con¬
firmed experimentally, shows that two of these forces, electromagnetism
and the weak atomic interaction, are indeed the same phenomenon.
Shortly after the announcement of the award. Professor Salam, who has
had a long and fruitful association with Unesco, was invited to the
Organization's headquarters in Paris to receive the congratulations of the
Unesco Executive Board. The article below consists of large extracts from
his address to the Executive Board.
Turks, Afghans and Persians, men belong¬
ing to the culture of Islam.
After 1 100 Western names appear: Gerard
of Cremona, Jacob Anatoli, Roger Bacon
and so on. But the honours are still shared
with the names of Moses Bin Maimoun
(Maimonides), of Ibn-Rushd (Averroës), of
Tusi and Ibn-Nafis. After 1350, however, the
developing world ceased to make such an
important contribution, apart from some oc¬
casional flashes of scientific genius, such as
the Observatory of Ulugh Beg, the grandson
of Timurlane, in Samarkand, or the work of
Maharajah Jai Singh of Jaipur, who in 1720
corrected the errors of the western tables of
eclipses of the sun and the moon by as
much as six minutes of arc. As it was. Jai
Singh's techniques were surpassed soon
after with the development of the telescope
in Europe. As a contemporary chronicler
wrote, "With him on the funeral pyre ex¬
pired all science in the East."
And this brings us to the present century
when the cycle of Michael of Scotland turns
full circle and we in the developing world
begin to borrow from the West. I would like
to quote here from Alkindi: "It is fitting for
us not to be ashamed to acknowledge truth
and to assimilate it from whatever source it
comes to us, even if it is brought to us by
foreign peoples. For him who seeks the
truth, there is nothing of higher value than
truth itself, it never cheapens or abases
him".
The question which I am really leading up
to is, are we in the developing world today
firmly on the road to a renaissance in the
sciences, just as the West was in the twelfth
century at the time of Michael the Scot?
For this renaissance to happen, there are
two prerequisites: one, the availability of
places like Toledo where international con¬
course can take place, where one can light a
candle from a candle; secondly, there has to
be an interest in developing societies to give
the topmost priority to the acquisition of
knowledge, just as, for example, the
Japanese did after the Meiji revolution by
enshrining the acquiring of knowledge in
their constitution.
Regretfully, if I may speak the truth and if
I look at the world of developing countries
as it is today, I see that neither of these re¬
quirements is being met. The opportunities
for international concourse are fast shrink¬
ing, with greater and greater restrictions on
acceptance of overseas scholars from
developing countries. It is becoming in¬
creasingly clear that soon the developing
world will need internationally-run, United

### 44807: The Candle of learning: the tragedy of neglected scientific talent in the developing world
Nations-run, Unesco-run, institutions,
universities of science, not just for research
as at the United Nations University in Tokyo,
but for high-level teaching of traditional
technology and science, both pure and ap¬
plied. The second prerequisite which I men¬
tioned, a passionate desire on the part of the
developing countries for scientific know¬
ledge and the removal of all barriers to its
acquisition, is unfortunately non-existent.
Some of you may recall that on 9 May this
year, Unesco held a meeting to mark
Einstein's birthday. I told then how Einstein
might have been lost to physics, but for a
series of accidents such was the measure
of the financial, economic and other frustra¬
tions which he faced, even in a country like
Switzerland. Unfortunately, the same thing
applies to an even greater extent where the
developing countries are concerned.
Perhaps I may be allowed to illustrate this
with a few words about my own case.
The fact that I became and remained a
research physicist was due to a series of ac¬
cidents. First the Second World War: as
soon as I showed some competence in
science, my well-wishers, my parents, all
around me, destined me for a career in the
prestigious Indian Civil Service. As chance
would have it, the Civil Service examination
was suspended for the duration of the War.
But for this and but for the grace of God, I
would today have been a civil servant in
Pakistan.
The second accident and this is
something which I am sure many others have
experienced in their own lives and which is
by no means unique to mewas the acci¬
dent of how I got to Cambridge. The then
Prime Minister of my State, the Punjab, col¬
lected some funds to present to the British
Government for the purchase of armaments.
The war ended and the funds were left
unutilized. The Prime Minister decided to in¬
stitute Smallholding Peasants' Scholarships
for Study Abroad. A number of scholarships
were offered; I was fortunate enough to get
one and sail the same year, 1946, and to go
to Cambridge to read physics and
mathematics. Several other scholarships
were awarded. Unfortunately the scholars
were promised admissions for the subse¬
quent year. In the meantime, the sub¬
continent was partitioned and with partition
the scholarships disappeared. The entire ex¬
ercise of the then Prime Minister succeeded
in one thing only in getting me to St.
John's College, Cambridge, where Pro¬
fessor Dirac, to whom Unesco recently
awarded an Einstein Medal, was teaching.
So you can understand why I feel so
grateful to Allah for having given me this op¬
portunity in such a mysterious way that I
was able to conduct research at a time when
there was no visible means of doing so.
The third accident, and I will conclude
with this, happened to me after I returned to
Pakistan from Cambridge to teach and to try
to found a school of research in physics at
Lahore. Unfortunately, I soon discovered
that there was a very big conflict between
whether I should remain a research physicist
or whether I should leave my country. With
anguish in my heart, I made myself an exile.
It was this anguish which led me to propose
the creation of an International Centre for
Theoretical Physics, but this time with the
sponsorship of the Government of Pakistan
and of the governments of all other friendly
developing countries. The idea was to
award what we call associateships of the
Centre, so that a deserving young man
might spend his period of vacation in an in¬
vigorating environment in close touch with
his peers in research something which
commonly happens in a developed coun¬
try charge his batteries with new
ideas, still spending the remaining nine
months of his academic year back at home
working in his own university.
Unesco supported the idea, although it
was in fact first suggested at the Board of
the International Atomic Energy Agency,
from the very first day. With Unesco's very
active help, and with the most generous
assistance from the Government of Italy, the
Centre was created in 1964 by the IAEA in
Trieste, with Unesco joining as a full partner
in 1970.
Over the 15 years that the Centre has ex¬
isted, it has, in response to a continuing de¬
mand from the developing countries and
from Unesco, steadily shifted its emphasis
from fundamental and basic physics
towards subjects which are on the interface
of pure and applied science subjects like
physics of materials, physics of energy,
physics of fusion, physics of reactors,
physics of solar and other conventional
sources, geophysics, physics of oceans,
physics of deserts, systems analysis in ad¬
dition to the more basic subjects like high
energy physics (my own subject), quantum
gravity, cosmology, atomic and nuclear
physics, and applicable mathematics. This
shift from the pure to the applied was not
because we thought we were doing too
much pure. It was simply the fact that there
just was not and still is not any other institu¬
tion which could take over the more applied
aspects of the subject at all.
Over the fifteen years that I have been
running the Centre, I have felt more and
more strangled, if I may so express myself,
and never more so than now. I used to pride
myself on spending half a day every day in
research, and half a day in administration.
Progressively over the last five years, this
has become impossible. This is not because
the task of administration has become
greater; it is simply because the uncertainty
of the Centre's standing in the ecology of in¬
ternational institutes means that its ex¬
istence is something which one has to fight
for all the time, and this is not good for a
director who would like to combine both
research and administration.
Briefly, one-half of the Centre's budget
comes from the Italian Government and the
other half from the IAEA and Unesco.
Unesco defined its mandate 25 years ago as
a catalyst of institutions: but that is no
longer enough. We get 1,500 physicists
every year, coming to us for periods ranging
from four weeks to a year. We have a very
considerable experience of actually knowing
what the pulse of science in 120 countries is.
The realities of the situation now demand a
revision of earlier thinking. A mere catalyst
role is, I fear, no longer enough: it is
necessary to think in terms of setting up
more stable institutions. It will be pointed
out that this cannot be done without new
funds, and that is undoubtedly true. But I
would humbly appeal to Unesco and there
is no other body in the world to which one
can goto consider such a revision of what
was decided 25 years ago and envisage, the
creation for developing countries of institu¬
tions with the requisite stability, both on the
applied side as well as on the fundamental
side which must not be ignored.
In science, as in other spheres, this world
of ours is divided into rich countries and
poor countries. The richer half the in¬
dustrial north, the centrally managed coun¬
tries an income of 5 trillion dollars,
spends 2 per cent of this income, some 100
billion dollars, on non-military science and
research. The remaining half the poorer
southwith one-fifth of this income, i.e. 1
trillion dollars, spends only two billion
dollars rather than the 20 billion it should be
spending on the basis of the norm establish¬
ed by the richer countries. At the Vienna
Conference six weeks ago, the poorer na¬
tions called for international funds to in¬
crease the 2 billions to 4. We got promises
of one-seventh of this. Unesco's program¬
mes will be the sufferers, and with them un¬
fortunately the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics.
I would like to conclude with three ap¬
peals. The first and most important is to the
delegates from the developing countries,
and I am one of them. I would like to make a
personal appeal. Science and technology
are your responsibility. Your men of science
are precious assets. Prize them; give them
opportunities to participate in the scientific
and technological development of your
countries. Do not leave them out. The goal
of increasing the 2 billions to 20 billions is
ultimately your responsibility.
But having said this, I would also wish to
appeal to the international community, both
to governments and to scientists. A world
so divided where science and technology are
concerned cannot endure. What is one to
think when one sees that an international
centre for theoretical physics has a budget
of 1.5 million dollars to spend on 100
developing countries, while the great
organization CERN (the European Organiza¬
tion for Nuclear Research), at Geneva,
which is a joint organization of European na¬
tions, has a budget of one-third of a billion
dollars? That is the scale on which scientific
research has to be conducted in order to be
effective.
And then, finally, I would like to make an
appeal to my brethren, those from the
Islamic countries. I have spoken of Islamic
science. I spoke of it advisedly. To some of
you, Allah has given a bounty, an income of
the order of 60 billion dollars. On the interna¬
tional norms these countries should be
spending one billion dollars annually on
science and technology. Your forbears were
the torch-bearers of scientific research in the
eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries.
It was your forbears who started the
academies of sciences in Baghdad and in
Cairo. Be generous once again. Spend the
billion dollars on international science, even
if others do not. Create a talent fund. It is
talent which makes the difference in the
end. Let this talent fund be available, not
only to Islamic countries, not only to Arab
countries, but to all developing countries.
My humble personal contribution to this
fund will be the $60,000 which the Swedish
Academy will so generously award me on 10
December.

Waterweeds at work
Infestation by waterweeds, which grow
luxuriantly and weigh hundreds of tons per I
hectare, is an increasingly serious
development problem, especially in tropical
countries. These threateningly prolific
aquatic plants choke irrigation pumps and I
canals, interfere with hydroelectricity
production, hinder navigation, increase the I
spread of waterborne diseases such as
schistosomiasis, malaria and encephalitis,
hamper fishing and fish culture, and clog
up rivers and canals so that drainage
becomes impossible and floods result. So
far they have proved impossible to
eradicate and difficult to control. Some
approaches to the problem now being
explored involve the use of nature's own
mechanisms, rather than expensive
machinery and herbicides, to control these I
troublesome weeds and even turn them to I
productive use.

Above, the scintillating skyline of
Manhattan by night. In July 1977 the lights
went out in Manhattan and the rest of New
York when a day-long power station failure
cut off electricity supplies, bringing the
city's activities to a halt and causing losses
totalling $5 billion. The breakdown
illustrated the vulnerability of a certain kind
of economic development characterized by
a high degree of concentration and
technological specialization. The
components of such concentrated systems
are so mutually dependent that when one
of them fails the whole systerri is
paralyzed. Attempts to solve the problem
by further injections of technology are not
fully satisfactory because in a sense the
very rarity of technical breakdowns means
that people are less fitted to cope with
their consequences when they occur. This
undesirable by-product of technological
progress is leading to dissatisfaction with
technology in some quarters. At the same
time, attention is increasingly being
focussed on the reliability-potential of
smaller-scale, more autonomous
undertakings.

Diminishing
returns
A provocative
view of
the limitations
of modern
technology
by Orio Giarini
IF we look back over the history of the last
ten centuries or so, it becomes apparent
that economic growth is a phenomenon
as old as mankind. The Stone Age, the
Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Space and
Electronic Age, each describes a stage of
development in human civilization. The divi¬
sion between one stage and the next is often
marked by a technological advance, but
technological progress is inseparable from
the men who conceived it, who used and
spread it. Systems of production and
distribution are determined by the society in
which they evolve; society is the prime fac¬
tor in production, indeed, it is our way of
putting our signature on economic facts.
Man's history is essentially the history of his
production, in every field of activity. Ob¬
vious though this may seem, it tends to be
forgotten, particularly since Keynesian
economic theory laid emphasis on the "de¬
mand" factor and preached that economic
development depended essentially upon
stimulation of consumption.
Nevertheless, both in its magnitude and in
its causes, the phenomenon of economic
growth such as the western world has ex¬
perienced since the end of the Second
World War is unprecedented in the whole
history of mankind.
If, in 1945, an economist had dared to
predict that national income in the in¬
dustrialized countries would increase as it
has, he would certainly have been thought a
madman. All previous economic history
would have tended to suggest to a man of
good sense that such a prediction was im¬
possible of fulfilment.
And yet, during the following twenty
years, economic and political life became
organized around the new reality of a high
growth rate. In the debate over the growth
rate (should we be content with 6 per cent a
year, or should we attempt to catch up with
Japan's rate which in some years nudges 20
per cent?) we have begun to think of this in¬
creasing growth as an eternal truth. It has
become part of our way of life, a constant in
our economic and political analyses. We
have even been told that if the growth rate is
only 2 or 3 per cent, then we are in a state of
crisis, quite forgetting that the average
growth rate during the first Industrial
Revolution is believed never to have been
higher than that. Born of real economic and
social factors, increased growth has since
entered the psychology of the industrial
world as an article of faith, an unavoidable
reality. Accelerated growth has become, im¬
plicitly, an ideology, especially since it has
come to be regarded as the principal, if not
the only means of achieving a social consen¬
sus. Little by little, the means has become
the end, a categorical imperative.
The driving force behind this growth has
been the widespread use of a technology
which, for the first time in history, was
based on the development of scientific
knowledge bequeathed to us by the 19th
century. The Industrial Revolution was bas¬
ed on new methods of production, coupled
with an increase in the population due itself
to the development of technology in health,
hygiene and agriculture. But it was the
unheralded marriage between technology
and scientific knowledge which was the key
to the new growth. Knowledge of the nature
of a polymer forms the basis of the produc¬
tion of man-made textile fibres and of
plastics. At the time of the first Industrial
Revolution, when the steam engine was in¬
vented, the properties of water were not
precisely known. But we owe nuclear
energy to a profound knowledge of the
structure of the atom. The engineer has
become the secular arm of the scientist.
How can we predict the practical con¬
sequence of this marriage which took place
almost before anyone, even the married
couple themselves, was aware of what was
happening?
Economists, accustomed to scrutinizing
the relationship between investment figures
and alterations in the population structure
and in demand, were unable to assess the
economic significance of the discovery of
the structure of the ethylene molecule and
of polymerization at the time these
discoveries were made.
The reality of economic growth, this
growth which began at the start of the cen¬
tury but which really took off between 1965
and 1973, has been such that it cannot be
explained by the analytical methods at our
disposal. From this state of affairs to an im¬
plicitly ideological explanation was a short
step, easily taken.
Towards the end of the 1960s, more at¬
tention began to be paid to the correlation
between investment in research and
economic growth. It was a dizzying mo¬
ment. The technological gaps between
Europe and the United States, between the
developing countries and "the others" were
discovered. The fact that, as a general rule,
investment in basic research only shows
results after about ten years was forgotten.
Even in applied technology it always takes a
fair number of years before appreciable
economic results are obtained. To say that
research would produce results more and
more rapidly (and who has not seen graphs
purporting to prove this?) was to confuse
the time needed to become aware of the
uses of a technology already in existence
with the time necessary for the development
of a new technology. The time needed for
the former has shortened, but the time
needed for the latter has, more often than
not, tended to become longer. Physicists to¬
day confirm that no discovery of fundamen¬
tal research is likely to be usefully applied in
under twenty years. Hence the difficulty of
conceiving and putting on paper a feasible
and effective "policy for science and
technology".
Furthermore, in the case of those famous
twins R and D (Research and Development),
the correlation between investment and
economic growth was considered irrever¬
sible and directly proportional.
It is curious to note that, at the very mo¬
ment that the gospel of growth through in¬
vestment in technology was being most
fervently preached, America's leading in¬
dustries and aeronautics
undergoing a pronounced recession.
The statistics even showed that it was above
all the export of products requiring a low
level of technology that was having the
most beneficial effect on the American
balance of payments. A few years later the
file on the "technology gap" was being
passed feverishly from one expert to
another, but no one was able to explain
away an increasing series of contradictions.
The fact is that, by its very success,
technology has produced its own limita¬
tions. In this context reference is often made
to the problem of environmental pollution or |
to be more precise, of the lengthening of the I

The price of the potato is in the packaging.
Research and development of preservation
and processing techniques and the
organization of a sales and distribution
network are factors which help to explain
why the potato chip should be so much
more expensive than its earthy raw
material. In some countries today, the
lion's share of the price the customer pays
for a product covers distribution costs of
various kinds; manufacturing costs may
constitute less than 20 per cent of this
retail price.
y time needed for the re-cycling of many new
products. The production sequence, from
extraction of the raw material to the utiliza¬
tion of the final product, comprises a series
of transformations each of which produces
its own wastes. The wastes themselves are
sometimes transformed into by-products
and again some wastes remain.
This is an important question, but it ac¬
counts for only a part of the present situa¬
tion. The most important problem is that
technology has so much reduced produc¬
tion costs in comparison with distribution
and storage costs that the industrial sector
today has become virtually a second tertiary
sector. In more and more cases the cost of a
finished product as it comes off the machine
represents as little as 10 or 20 per cent of the
price paid at the end of the distribution net¬
work. The rest is made up of costs of
storage, distribution, maintenance, sales,
and financing. A technological improvement
which reduces production costs by 10 per
cent, but which indirectly causes an increase
of the same percentage in storage and
distribution costs, is an "improvement"
which increases the economic cost in real
terms five or ten times. Once we have reach¬
ed this point technology is no longer a
motive force in the production of wealth but
has become a source of "diseconomies"
leaving no margin for growth in real terms.
In other words, an additional advance in
technology no longer provides a propor¬
tional increase in economic growth and
material well-being.
At all events, it is obvious that margins are
not infinitely wide and there is reason to
believe that many sectors of industry have
already reached the limit of these margins.
The race to produce the biggest or the
fastest aeroplane, the largest ethylene or
ammoniac plant, so much a feature of the
industrial scene ten years ago, is now vir¬
tually a thing of the past. Today the practical
men of industry are talking in terms of the
diminishing returns of technology, but this
phenomenon has not yet been recognized
by the general run of economists. The myth
suits them better. Meanwhile, economic
growth has become an item on the balance
sheet rather than something that really oc¬
curs, with "stagflation" (economic stagna¬
tion accompanied by inflation) providing the
link between the two.
Experience gained during the economic
crisis of 1929 led experts to deduce an
economic law which stated that large-scale
unemployment and inflation could not occur
simultaneously. If there was unemployment,
therefore, the economy could be revived to
the point where full employment was attain¬
ed simply by stimulating demand. This
would only be possible, however, in a situa¬
tion in which production was elastic, that is,
where there was nothing to constrain a rapid
change in the level of production. But there
is an essential difference between the situa-
y

The situations shown in these two
drawings illustrate at a simple, everyday
level how technology can have both
positive and negative effects. When a
gardener plants flowers near a bee-keeper's
hives (above), the yield of honey is
improved, while smoke from the factory
chimney (below) has a detrimental effect
on the service provided by the nearby
laundry. Attempts to measure the costs
and benefits of technology are increasingly
taking into account its impact on the
environment and the quality of life.

Below, irradiated fuel in a plant at La
Hague (France) specializing in the
treatment of radioactive waste from
nuclear power stations. By radically
changing the structure of materials,
modern technology often creates products
which when discarded take much longer to
be "recycled" into nature than natural
substances such as wood. Nuclear energy
poses the problems of recycling waste in
their most acute form, since atomic waste
may remain radioactive for centuries.

tion before the Second World War and the
situation today. During the 1930s,
technology was in a phase in which it of¬
fered increasing returns, whereas today,
overall, it has reached a stage where it offers
only diminishing returns. Furthermore,
modern technology entails increasing costs
imputable to the need for pollution control
and correction and to the growing
vulnerability of economic systems. These
costs appear in the accounts as "value add¬
ed" to the national income and thus as an
increase in wealth, whereas in fact they are
"value deducted" and represent a reduction
of wealth.
We are therefore faced with a situation in
which the limits to growth are to be found
within the production mechanism itself and
in the very logic of technology application.
There is also the problem of the increasing
vulnerability of complex economic systems
and the question of intrinsic value. What
purpose does it serve? is a question which
comes up more and more often. A fibre that
can withstand a temperature of 500 degrees
may find a small, specialized market, but it is
unlikely to arouse much enthusiasm in the
general textile industry, even in the most
highly developed country. And in a society
that is not capable of inventing or re¬
inventing a process for its own purposes
(and therefore of maintaining and making
use of it) a modern process or technology is
not necessarily going to increase well-being
or wealth.
The limitations of technology, therefore,
entail limits to a certain conception of
growth. They peel off the many layers of
superstition that have built up about science
and about its ideological interpretation. In¬
deed, it can frequently be observed that the
very same science that has fought so many
bitter battles against superstition over the
last two or three centuries has itself
become, in some subtle way, the refuge of
unreason. Though they themselves would
not see it in this way, scientists have often
played the role in society that an American
economist of the beginning of this century,
Thorstein Veblen, identified with that of the
magician. Scientists are only credible to the
general public when they use an incom¬
prehensible language (proof that, unlike the
ordinary mortal, they can communicate with
the gods) and when they cause things to
happen that are beyond the ordinary man's
ken (further proof of their magic powers).
Today, whether he likes it or not, the
scientist finds himself at the crossroads, try¬
ing to escape from the myths and supersti¬
tions of our time. But whereas in the time of
Galileo superstition was against him, the
modern Galileo's problem is that he is often
seen by the politicians, the economists and
the public at large as an incarnation of the
figure of the magician. Psychologically we
look upon him as we used to look upon the
magician of old. This is very important for,
although the army, the police and money
have always played an important role in the
history of civilizations, these civilizations
have been made or marred not because one
was richer than another, but because one
was more successful ,in controlling men's
minds and spirit. The role of science today
would be less contested if we had been able
to see where this assimilation of the scientist
to the magician would lead us. Scientists
themselves cannot be blamed for this
assimilation which probably satisfies a cer¬
tain taste for the irrational in all of us. I

k This is why there is an urgent need for us
to understand that in our modern age
superstition too has been modernized so
successfully, indeed, that it can attack its
enemies from within, imitating their words
and gestures.
If science today is under attack, it is
because men see in her an inexhaustible
source of miracles. How many economic
miracles and technological miracles has our
era experienced modern miracles born of
the marriage between science and
technology that was consummated during
the last century.
But in this present time of the "growth
crisis", the question of divorce is in the air,
divorce between economic growth and
economic welfare in the widest sense of the
term. This would become blindingly evident
if a new form of economic accounting were
to be developed which would put costs and
profits in their proper place. In the
framework of present economic thinking,
too many activities are assessed on the
credit side when in reality they should be.
placed on the debit side.
Take for example the man who commutes
to work; the farther he lives from his work,
the more it costs him in transport and time.
But the national revenue is increased as a
result of having to set up the system of
transport he uses. The individual pays and
this represents for him a reduction in
economic welfare, but the Gross National
Product is increased, and we are told that
this benefits growth. That is the divorce.
Growth too often feeds on the costs it
creates itself.
It is, of course, impossible to avoid the
whole range of such costs, but if we could
detach ourselves from the myth of growth,
which today is given absolute priority, we
could find a new equilibrium. Without
sacrificing everything to the popular Utopian
ideas of the primitive life, we could try to
find better economic welfare by daring to
ask again the question that Adam Smith first
asked: "What is the wealth of nations and
how is it created?". The answers that the in¬
dustrial societies have so far given to this
question are becoming less and less
satisfactory. There are almost certainly
several new directions open to us which
would produce values and riches on a
worldwide scale.
To achieve this we must first, in the
jargon of the electronics technician, get rid
of the background noises produced by all
kinds of superstitions, especially those that
disguise themselves in modern dress and,
using the trickery of scientific and
technological "miracles", assume the man¬
tle of the true religion and prevent us from
seeing clearly the paths to the future.
We are today witnessing a process of
world industrialization. If this process is not
progressing evenly enough to satisfy those
who want to see a more equitable distribu¬
tion of the riches of the world, it never¬
theless shows some parallels with the
spread of the industrial revolution to con¬
tinental Europe during the last century. In
the political field the resemblances are strik¬
ing. Today, as then, we are seeing the
irresistible thrust of independence
movements in regions affected by the in¬
dustrialization process. This corresponds to
an extension of the European ideological
model which was born of the industrial
revolution (in both its liberal and its marxist
versions). It is nevertheless to be hoped that
it will be possible for this model to evolve in
the Third World without ' reproducing at
each stage the set-backs that occurred in
Europe. It is even possible to conjecture that
the equilibrium of our planet very probably
depends more on a growth of awareness
and a flowering of the different cultures of
which it is composed than on a standardiza¬
tion of the cultural environment.

The adoption of more efficient production
techniques sometimes leads to results
which are diametrically opposed to those
desired. In the case of renewable natural
resources, technological progress may lead
to overexploitation and ultimately to a drop
in production. Modern techniques have
enabled fish to be located and captured so
efficiently that fish stocks have declined
and there has been a drop in the world fish
catch in the last ten years. Whale fishing
has been so intensive that certain species
were hunted to the point of extinction. The
International Whaling Commission,
established in 1946 to protect whales from
overexploitation, has prohibited the hunting
of some whale species and fixes annual
catch quotas for non-prohibited species.

UNISIST-,4 philosophy,
a movement
and an organization
Rational planning for development requires
a solid basis of readily accessible scientific
and technological information. But many
countries lack the personnel or the facilities
to cope with the rising flood of information
(around two million scientific articles are
published in some fifty languages every
year). To make this mass of information
more readily available and to help scientists
and decision-makers to select more swiftly
the information appropriate to their needs,
Unesco launched in 1971, in close
collaboration with the International Council
of Scientific Unions, an intergovernmental
programme known as Unisist. The aim of
Unisist is to promote the unimpeded
exchange of published scientific
information and data among scientists of
all countries by encouraging compatibility
between different systems through
standardization in the presentation of data
and removal of the barriers of language and
by the development of trained manpower
and information resources in all countries.
Unisist makes it easier for developing
countries to select the scientific and
technological information that they
themselves consider important for their
development. Unisist has been described as
"a philosophy, a movement and an
organization" and it provides the
conceptual framework and helps to
harmonize the activities of the hundred or
more information systems or services of
the United Nations and its Agencies, some
examples of which figure in the diagram.
The meaning of these acronyms and the
Agencies which sponsor them are:

Co-operation in the fields of scientific and

STILL fresh in everyone's memory are
the days when, for the first time,
mankind had to face up to problems
on a global scale, when the world was finally
obliged to consider the possible
catastrophes that might be brought about
by the "reckless" actions of an exploding
population on our shrunken earth.
Various alternative causes of disequili¬
brium between man's activities and his en¬
vironment came under consideration. And
as if to justify our fears, the real crises broke
one after the other: food, energy, raw
materials, and, finally, the ecological crisis.
The world began to heed the voices calling
attention to the problems of the ocean and
the climate and demanding proper manage¬
ment of the ozone layer which protects the
earth against the damaging effects of
cosmic radiation..
It must be admitted that alarmist
dramatization of the future turned out to be
more effective in attracting attention to
these new questions than was impartial
analysis of the vivid facts of everyday reality.
The reason for this is that people are inclined
to underestimate a danger with which they
are actually faced and that is evident to
them, and to overestimate the risk when
they have only a vague understanding of the j
nature of the processes involved. I

### 44809: The Search for a global strategy
The bounty of the earth
Science and technology have brought great benefits to mankind by freeing men from many
of the constraints imposed by nature and giving them the means of exploiting the earth's
resources. The question remains, however, how far man can go In the manipulation of the
environment without risking disruption and breakdown. Although environmental and
resource use problems take specific forms in different geographic areas of the world, they
have to be viewed in a global or at least a regional perspective since nature takes no
account of man-made frontiers. It is not by chance, therefore, that Unesco's major
intergovernmental scientific co-operation programmes have evolved around disciplines that
are geographical in character, such as geology, ecology, hydrology and oceanography.
Thus, the International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) is concerned with
advancing our knowledge of the processes involved in the evolution of the earth's crust
and of the origin and extent of the earth's mineral and energy resources and with ensuring
their rational use; the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) aims to improve our
knowledge of the earth's biological resources and of man's interaction with his
environment; the International Hydrological Programme (IHP) seeks to promote the study
and the rational management of the world's water resources; in the Marine Sciences
Unesco's programme is concerned with examining the possibilities for man of what has
been described as "the last frontier", the vast ocean masses that cover some 70 per cent of
the surface of the globe. Today the social sciences, the humanities, culture, education and
communication are all contributing to the solution of one of the crucial problems on which
all development hinges how to conserve and to make rational use of the earth's bounty.

, But neither alarmism nor complacency are
good advisers where complicated and im¬
portant global problems are concerned.
What is needed is a realistic evaluation of
the situation, mobilization of the necessary
resources, and exploitation of the options
open to us. And it is only natural that in fac¬
ing global problems, in searching for the
wisest and most rational solutions, mankind
should draw more and more actively upon
the accumulated store of scientific
knowledge and upon the know-how offered
by technology.
The past decade has seen the emergence
of a new approach to the consideration of
the long-term laws that govern the evolution
of human civilization. Now generally known
26
as global modelling, this approach brings
together representatives of various scientific
disciplines possessing the professional
knowledge and skills acquired previously
within their individual disciplines. This
results in attempts to solve global problems
within the framework of approaches of a
wide spectrum of disciplines with different
objectives and methods and at the same
time it creates favourable conditions for
alternative and even contradictory concepts,
thus offering hope that a comprehensive
analysis can be achieved. If the contradic¬
tions between various approaches turn out
to be major and substantive, a basis is pro¬
vided on which global modelling, suggesting
theories of its own, can establish itself as a
new conceptual approach.
The first work in the field of global modell¬
ing was undertaken in an attempt to explain
the process of mankind's development, tak¬
ing into consideration multiple factors
which, in the view of scientists, could in¬
fluence the future of civilization on the
planet. What these attempts revealed most
clearly, however, was the existence of a
number of serious methodological problems
in the elaboration of theories and in situation
simulation.
The modest results so far achieved in
global modelling can thus be explained by
the lack of a sound theoretical basis and by
the tendency to use short-term interactions
among system elements for the analysis of
long-term patterns.

Below, the majestic architecture of the
tropical forest, photographed here in the

thousand million hectares of land in Africa,
south and central America and south-east
Asia, tropical forests form the habitat of
some of the world's most rare and
interesting plants and animals. Over one
thousand million people live in the world's
tropical forest zones; wise use of forest
lands is vital to their well-being and is the
very foundation of national economic and
development planning for many tropical
countries.
The potential contribution of science to
the solution of global problems is not,
however, limited to the development of a
methodology for their analysis. Problems of
the interactions of human society with
nature and of the interactions between
societies with varying potentials for ac¬
cumulating natural wealth to satisfy their
domestic needs cannot be resolved without
the direct involvement of scientists and
engineers. A wide range of problems, both
fundamental and technological, must be
solved before the population of our planet
can be assured of an adequate supply of
energy, food and raw materials, before
dangerous diseases can be checked and
before environmental pollution and the
degradation of the soil can be halted.
Even the most elegant scientific solu¬
tions new method of increasing crop
yields known as the "Green Revolution" is a
good example may be incompatible with
the socio-economic environment in which
they are to be implemented. It is in these
situations that a purely mechanistic,
technocratic approach is insufficient and the
systems approach, broadly interpreted, is
needed to identify in good time possible
contradictions, to establish new objectives,
sometimes in unexpected areas, and to sug¬
gest valid solutions.
One important stimulus to modern
development is the contradiction between
the universality of scientific knowledge and
technological skills on the one hand, and the
specific origin of many of today's dominant
technologies on the other. This contradic¬
tion is quite natural, since knowledge of the
world is gained unevenly, while specific
achievements in certain branches of science
respond to the requirements of the time and
the social environment.
<
Which scientific discoveries can be ap¬
plied in the form of appropriate technologies
is after all a question of a socio-economic
character, rather than one to be resolved by
the natural sciences. It is regrettable that
those who determine scientific and
technological policies in governments or
corporations do not always take this obvious
factor into consideration.
Quite often we come across certain con¬
cepts which are based on the idea that the
universality of natural laws implies identity
of methods in their use by all the peoples of
the earth. This leads to the simplistic conclu¬
sion that peoples with a wider experience of
interactions with nature and possessing
more powerful means of transforming
natural wealth into economic benefits can
pass on their experience to countries that
are less developed in this respect; since the
latter are not adequately prepared to absorb
new technologies, they have to simplify
and adapt them first, and only then can
they introduce them into their economic
structures.
Reasoning along these lines, the authors
of certain global projects make suggestions
whose implementation would perpetuate
the unnatural situation obtaining in the
capitalist world, and would not be con¬
ducive to solving the global problem of the
international division of labour. These
authors regard the future of mankind as a
realization of the so-called "organic growth"
concept, according to which each region of
the world, guided by a wish to minimize
costs, specializes in the most readily
available activities. The final result of the
whole chain of logical consequences pro¬
ceeding from a seemingly harmless
hypothesis of the integrity and universality
of principal technological decisions is sum¬
marized by the American futurologist Her¬
man Kahn, who states in his book "The
Next 200 Years": "The poor and the un¬
trained have always done the dirtier and less
pleasant work, and this is true among coun¬
tries as well as within them".
The application of the comparative costs
principle as the only basis for shaping the
strategy of long-term development of coun¬
tries and regions of the world is not only in¬
sufficient, but is fraught with the dangers in¬
herent in a simplified interpretation of com¬
plex processes of socio-economic develop¬
ment. The development of world economic
relations in line with this principle brings
about stratification of the productive struc¬
ture of the world economy, that is to say,
specialization of some regions in raw
materials production, others in their pro¬
cessing, and still others in the manufacture
of consumer goods and equipment and in
development of new technologies. In the
longer term such stratification would modify
the conditions of foreign trade exchange in
favour of the regions that occupy the upper
levels of the production process and result in
the export of inflation by these regions in ex¬
change for import of higher growth rates
from other, mainly developing, regions.
Thus the solution of the more radical |
global problems of today's world calls for a I

### 44809: The Search for a global strategy
fundamentally different strategy of long-
term development, one that provides for all-
round development of every region. In par¬
ticular, developing nations need their own
scientific capability so that they can meet
their urgent needs through the creation of
adequate technologies of their own. These
technologies may have nothing in common
with the so-called "adaptive" technologies
that reproduce, in a simplified form, pro¬
duction techniques used in the advanced
countries.
It is quite possible that new technologies
would have to be developed that would
meet the same demands but by quite dif¬
ferent means and would be suited to the
economic potential of the nation concerned.
In many cases the accomplishment of these
tasks would be impossible unless the
developing countries are provided with the
infrastructure for modern fundamental
research and a constantly evolving scientific
and technical basis of their own.
The solution of vital scientific and
technical problems and the quest for alter¬
native technological options requires so
much manpower and such vast financial
resources that the duplication of research
in several countries is an unjustifiable
extravagance.
The development of international scien¬
tific and technical co-operation and the
search for ways and means of making it
more effective are thus particularly urgent
issues. In this context, the attitude of the
developed capitalist countries at the recent
UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development) Session in Manila
to the question of transfer of technologies
was disappointing. Their position appears to
be dictated inter alia by the desire to
minimize the threat of active competition
from the developing nations, some of which
have already achieved some success in
developing their own industry and possess a
substantial potential for certain types of
mass production based on the processing of
their own natural resources.
This attitude on the part of the developed
countries may well compromise any pro¬
gramme or strategy of scientific and
technological development, no matter how
enthusiastically it is adopted.
I believe that the task of rendering the
achievements of modern scientific and
technological progress genuinely interna¬
tional has now become so urgent that it ex¬
cludes any other alternatives, all of which
are fraught with catastrophic conse¬
quences. Never before in human history has
the need for co-operation between the
peoples of the globe been so acute as it is
today. All proposals aimed at setting up
adequate and effective international
mechanisms deserve the most careful
consideration.
In this context the reinforcement of the
activities of the United Nations, its
Specialized Agencies and the Regional
Commissions in organizing international
scientific and technological co-operation is
of particular importance. Not enough has
been achieved and there must be a constant
search for new and efficient organizational
forms of co-operation. The developing
countries should be given all possible sup¬
port in their efforts to establish regional and
subregional scientific centres, and to
achieve international integration of their na¬
tional goals.

National Park, California, United States.

Conservation fordevelopment
The biosphere, the thin layer of soil, water
and air surrounding our planet, to which all
life is confined, consists of a number of
complex self-sufficient units, known as
ecosytems, within which a balance is
maintained through the interactions of
animals, plants and other organisms and
chemical and physical elements. At first,
man had no more impact on these
ecosystems than any other mammal, but
the moment he mastered fire and invented
tools and agriculture, he began to modify
the "natural" environment in ways
favourable to himself. Unfortunately, the
achievement of the high present day levels
of agricultural and industrial productivity
has involved increasingly extensive

theories on natural selection from

found there. Many of the islands have been
declared nature reserves with animals and

modification of ecosystems and a rapid
attrition of natural areas and the animal
and plant species within them. If this trend
continues, many more species will become
extinct, with a consequent diminution of
the world gene pool and the loss of
important sources of potential evolutionary
material. To counter this threat, Unesco,
through its Man and the Biosphere (MAB)
Programme and in co-operation with
Member States, has established a network
of "biosphere reserves". These are
protected natural areas (tropical rain
forests, deserts, prairies, tropical
savannahs, etc.) in which valuable plant
and animal genetic strains can be
safeguarded and in which scientific
research on man's impact on his
environment can be carried out. Already
162 such areas (indicated by black dots on
the map below) have been designated
throughout the world and it is hoped that
eventually every type of habitat and
ecosystem will be represented. Biosphere
reserves are not limited to completely
untouched natural areas. They may include
areas that have been ravaged by man for
example by strip mining in which
experiments in restoration can be effected.
The whole concept of biosphere reserves,
therefore, adds a new dimension to the
traditional conservation approach. Going
beyond the initial stage of conservation, it
involves research into the broader question
of the rational use of natural resources and
the maintenance of mankind's biological
life-support system. With this approach,
conservation of our heritage becomes not a
hindrance to but a means of achieving
rational development.

Not only international governmental
organizations but a broad range of interna¬
tional non-governmental institutions should
be actively involved in the search for solu¬
tions. The potential of the international
scientific community, which within the last
few years has greatly improved its
understanding of the problems confronting
mankind, should be more effectively
employed. In this connexion particular
stress should be laid on the importance of
independent expert assessment, based on
deep and objective analysis of the complex
processes of scientific, technological, social
and economic development, as a means of
keeping pace with global development pro¬
cesses, enriching understanding of the com¬

tions on policy issues relating to the

the non-governmental community are need¬
ed. We should strive for the creation of a
new and powerful partnership of effort in¬
volving the international scientific and
technological community, national govern¬

Similarly, we should develop a partnership
of effort between the developing and
developed countries as well as between the
East and the West.

development are to be successfully solved,

THE year 1867, when the emperor
Mutsuhito acceded to the throne,
was a turning point in Japanese
history. Mutsuhito took the name Meiji,
which means "enlightened rule", and in the
little over a century that has elapsed since
the beginning of the Meiji era Japan has
been transformed from an isolated feudal
State into one of the great industrial powers
of the world.
What special factors lay behind this
achievement and what conclusions, if any.
can the countries of the Third. World draw
from this first successful experience of the
introduction of European-style industrializa¬
tion into a totally different economic, social
and cultural environment ?
First of all, the industrialization of Japan
has to be seen within the broader context of
political, social and economic development
and reform. The beginning of the Meiji era
saw the initiation of a political revolution
aimed at changing the whole structure of
political power as well as a strong cultural
and social reform which opened up the
country to the influence of the outside
world, in particular of Europe and the United
States.
Before that period, Japan had been vir¬
tually isolated from the outside world for
three hundred years. The visit, in 1853, of
Commodore Perry of the United States with
his four battleships, to demand the
establishment of diplomatic relations and
the opening up of the country, had been a\
tremendous shock to Japan. The Japanese!

### 44814: Meiji Japan: a case study in industrialization
This Japanese engraving of the
Meiji period shows, not without
irony, some of the conflicts that
could arise between modern,
foreign ways and products, and
those of traditional Japan: umbrella
(called a "bat" in the engraving and
perhaps also in popular parlance)
versus parasol. Western garments
versus the Japanese haori.
Inscriptions on lamps and lanterns
make similar allusions to Japanese
and Western food and systems of
transport. "Westernization" (or
opening up) and "Tradition" (in the
sense of resistance to change) are
words emblazoned on the banner
attached to the telegraph pole
brandished by the man with the
head of an ox.
were deeply impressed by the strength of
' these black ships, made of iron, driven by
steam, capable of crossing the Pacific
Ocean and, above all, equipped with over¬
whelmingly powerful guns. This was power
to which the old feudal régime had no
answer.
As the country was opened up to outside
influences the Japanese became aware of
the huge gap between the might of the
Western countries and their own lack of
modern technology and industry. There was
general anxiety throughout the country that
Japan could be taken over by strong
overseas powers.
A famous businessman and educator of
that time, Yukichi Fukuzawa, described this
feeling when he declared: "A country which
aims at the advancement of its civilization
has to decide the basic principles of its ac¬
tion by looking at European civilization as its
goal. And all the advantages and disadvan¬
tages have to be judged by this yardstick".
The surprise and shock which they ex¬
perienced at the start of Meiji provided
powerful motivation for the Japanese to
adapt and accept Western technology as
essential for building up a new civilization.
The important thing to be stressed,
however, is that not only among leading
politicians and businessmen but also among
the general public, there existed a strong
consensus on a national objective: Japan
had to introduce and adapt Western civiliza¬
tion, especially science and technology, in
order to become a civilized, by which was
meant a strong, country. The general public
understood the situation and this was due to
a very important factor the high educa¬
tional standard at that time in Japan. In
1868, the percentage of school attendance
was already the highest in the world,
reaching 43 per cent for men and 10 per cent
for women.
But great admiration for and attraction to
Western civilization was counter-balanced
by deep anxiety about the political
dominance of the West. This led the
Government to adopt a very careful attitude
in introducing Western civilization. There
was eagerness to introduce Western
knowledge and talent but also prudence in
adapting them to Japanese needs so as to
establish a truly indigenous self-reliant
capability.
The Government endeavoured to control
foreign capital investment even at a time
when there was a scarcity of capital in the
domestic market. The employment of
foreigners was also restricted mainly to
technical training and education and all
foreign workers had to be registered.
On the other hand, foreigners were paid
very high salaries, even though they were
not allowed to take part in general manage¬
ment. It is reported that thirty-five foreigners
employed by the Government were offered
higher salaries than ministers. More than 10
per cent of the Government's total budget
was at one time spent on foreign employees'
salaries.
There was thus very keen willingness to
introduce Western technology by welcom¬
ing the best foreign talents. But, on the
other hand, there was a strong effort to
adapt this technology to the Japanese
autonomous system as quickly as possible
so as to achieve self-reliance. One fact to be
noted is that almost all the Japanese
students who studied abroad came back to
Japan and there was practically no brain
drain. They engaged not only in education
or became Government employees but
also entered business and created new
enterprises.
With the amendment of the unequal trade
agreement early in this century, co¬
operation with foreign capital began.
However, even at that time the purpose of
joint ventures was more to acquire
technology rather than capital itself. The ex¬
ecutive manager of a large Japanese enter¬
prise stated: "It is not difficult to raise
capital in Japan. However, what I consider
to. be important is technology rather than
capital". Even after World War II this at¬
titude persisted in Japanese business
circles.
Another essential factor was the en¬
trepreneurial skill which created the driving
force for industrialization in the Meiji era.
Japanese entrepreneurs linked their private
activities with the national objectives of
developing the national economy and
military power. These entrepreneurs had
much in common with the innovators who
played such an important role in the in¬
dustrial revolution in the United Kingdom.
They were hard workers, with tough
physical and intellectual personalities, broad
interests and flexible ideas and a strong
belief in technology, and they made full use
of the talents of young people. They also
had something in common in their approach
to new enterprises: a strong competitive
spirit against imported goods, a desire to
serve the national interest by import
substitution and a very strong spirit of
emulation with fellow businessmen.
The close government-industry relation¬
ship, especially the dynamic policy of the
Government in support of the businessman
was another major factor. The slogan of the
Government was industrialization and at the
beginning of the Meiji era several measures
were taken, such as development of a
modern transportation system, formulation
of a direct export policy, the promotion of
trading companies, the establishment of in¬
dustry with modern production facilities,
and the holding of exhibitions and meetings
in various parts of the country at which
university professors were on hand to offer
technological guidance. In most cases the
foreign engineers employed by the Govern¬
ment were assigned to model factories and
Government factories to give technological
training and assistance.
While Government factories were mainly
in basic heavy industry closely related to
military purposes, such as iron and steel and
explosives, the private sector was mainly in¬
volved in light industry, manufacturing such
items as matches, toothbrushes, shoes,
glassware, umbrellas, soap, and buttons.
Such industries already existed to some ex¬
tent before the Meiji period and by introduc¬
ing new technologies they developed suc¬
cessfully and became the economic base
which supported capital intensive industries
in the later development of Japanese in¬
dustrial growth. They represent a typical
case of industrial application of what is to¬
day termed appropriate technology, being
labour intensive and closely combining
modern with traditional technology.
There are many examples of traditional
enterprises combining with imported
technology to produce some unique

opened up an era which still holds
untold prospects for young
Japanese today. Here, babysitting

Japanese products. In the very early stages
of the introduction of foreign technology
these enterprises tried to seek areas of the
domestic market not catered for by foreign
products. For example, the celluloid in¬
dustry produced artificial coral for Japanese
women's hair-pins and the rayon textile in¬
dustry produced decorative braid for
Japanese haori coats. Thus the domestic
market in traditional areas was used effec
tively to start the rudimentary stage of the
industry, leading to independence and com¬
petitiveness in the later stages. Throughout
this development, the Government offered
effective technical, financial and institutional
assistance to the industry.
Thus the successful industrialization of
Japan from the Meiji era onwards was based
on a wide consensus on national goals.
careful adaptation of technology leading to
self-reliance, entrepreneurial skill, and close
relations between government and industry.
Any relevance the Japanese experience may
have for developing countries today will,
however, be a matter of judgement for each
individual country based on its own specific
political and social situation.

### 44817: The Decision-makers
The decision-makers
by Francisco Papa Blanco
ALTHOUGH man is both the fount and the
finality of all action, on however large a
scale it may be, as an individual he
rarely has a say in decisions on technology except
perhaps in his own home or occasionally, when
he is self-employed, in his work. Even in these
restricted fields his habits as a consumer and his
access to the benefits of technology depend
largely upon decisions that are taken in circles
remote from him as an individual, whether by
large private companies or by legislative, political
or administrative bodies that govern society.
In fact, the general technological framework as
well as specific activities are increasingly deter¬
mined by society and the ruling political groups.
More and more, actions and their consequences
transcend frontiers, even though the era of fully
shared and concerted action on global problems
(climate, the hydrosphere, pollution of the upper
atmosphere, rational management of non¬
renewable resources, etc.) is still far off.
This inexorable removal of the centres of deci¬
sion further and further from the individual tends
to reverse the process of "spontaneous aggrega¬
tion" experienced to some extent by the few
countries in which conditions favouring the
development of technology first came together.
The approach has become more global, less con¬
cerned with the detail of specific actions, an in¬
version which leads to solutions which "descend"
upon the individual and upon communities and
social groups, not merely from the large private
companies (including the multinational com¬
panies) but from the society itself.
This is one further aspect of the inexorable pro¬
gression towards the structuralization, the
systemization or globalization of social life. One
day, as yet far off, our planet _will function as a
complex, vulnerable, perhaps ponderous and not
very efficient technological system. Such a
system, necessary for the management and the
survival of mankind and the planet, in an ineluc¬
table symbiotic relationship of mutual interaction,
will doubtless involve a huge superstructure
which will weigh heavily on national structures,
themselves at times unwieldy.
At present, the benefits and the disadvantages
this "planetization" may entail remain a matter of
speculation. Yet one fact is certain, the State can
introduce, and is introducing, new elements into
the classic decision-making processes of
technology. In principle, technology is devised in
order to satisfy needs and to improve living condi¬
tions. The State which takes technological deci¬
sions may, however, perceive needs, ways and
means which do not necessarily coincide with
those perceived or desired by the individual or by
the agents of technology, that is, business' in the
widest sense of the term. Thus the State may call
upon technology:
to act as a social instrument, primarily as a
distribution mechanism, through job creation,
geographical re-distribution of economic activity
or the reconversion of industry, agriculture or the
service sector;
to function as a bargaining factor. In this case,
technological production and services would be
oriented towards external trade, even at the ex¬
pense of internal objectives of immediate interest,
giving rise often to distortions of all kinds, for ex¬
ample, by the establishment of technological
enclaves which are the antithesis of a true implan¬
tation of technology in the general framework of
society;
finally, to fulfil its classic role the satisfaction
of needs and the improvement of the standard of
living.
These three objectives are basically divergent.
Generally speaking, any specific activity which
would lead to the achievement of one of these ob¬
jectives could not at the same time further the ac¬
complishment of the other two. As a "bargaining
factor" the specifications to be respected and the
methods to be used would be those appropriate
to foreign trade; productivity would have to en¬
sure competitiveness. As a "social instrument",
specifications and productivity would become
secondary to the methods of work used and the
materials employed. Finally, technological activity
conceived in function of the domestic re¬
quirements of a developing country would scarce¬
ly open the way for exports or radically improve
social conditions.
It is an essential part of the activity of every
State to take technological decisions on a greater
or lesser scale. Yet actual technological undertak¬
ings are necessarily the province of more or less
specialized bodies, whether private or otherwise,
having a certain autonomy as far as management
and executive decision-making are concerned.
Such bodies include private companies,
autonomous organisms, services within
ministries, or "mixed economy" companies all
businesses in the widest sense of the term.
For such "businesses", even those inspired by
the highest motives, the individual is a unit of
consumption, a user of the services offered. This
individual, with all the others, forms a market
which can be defined in terms of habits,
possibilities and capacities, and decisions have to
take account of this market. It is natural,
therefore, that sooner or later the line taken by
the State will diverge from that which business or
the market will tend to take spontaneously. The
roles of "bargaining factor" or "agent of distribu¬
tion" imposed on technology, coupled with the
superimposition of other conditioning factors (in¬
cluding the adoption of so-called "appropriate
technology") will end by altering, perhaps pro¬
foundly, the spontaneous course that would have
followed the application of technology more or
less directly in relation to the ultimate user.
In its planning and directive capacity the State
necessarily works on hypotheses and not on solid
technical standards sanctioned by experience or a
chain of reasoning backed by scientific
knowledge, as would be the case at more elemen¬
tary levels of conceptualization and execution.
Evaluation of the factors involved is in large part
subjective; a posteriori rationalization of the
policy or plans adopted may conceal spurious per¬
sonal or group motives. Both the political
strength and the practical weakness of
technocracy lie in the imprecision of the compo¬
nent elements of the technological system and in
the uncertainty of its links and of its evolution in
time, in the impossibility of allowing for and con¬
trolling the ever more powerful external in¬
fluences in a world ever more closely interlinked
yet still out of step in terms of reason and equity.
Man is suffering today from the negative con¬
sequences of the indiscriminate application of
technology, yet he is plunging ever deeper into it.
He does not properly understand what
technology is nor what its purpose is, but he
wants the products it offers. Technology extends
man's mastery in every direction, yet, because of
this, man finds himself submerged in an increas¬
ingly artificial world, confronted with options that
are beyond him. Man is at the same time actor
and spectator, beneficiary and victim of
something he himself created.
Technology is the one major sphere of activity
of modern society in which public conscience is
virtually non-existent and in which it exercises no
controlling influence. It is thus becoming more
and more the prerogative of the great industrial,
commercial, military and political interests.
It is strange that, at the same time, man is
becoming more and more capable of understan¬
ding other aspects of the world in which he lives,
such as its political, geographical, religious and
social aspects. The one aspect which seems to
escape his control, except in so far as he is a con¬
sumer unit, is technological advance.
Only public awareness of the way technology
functions, of the factors that carry the most
weight with decision-makers, will enable mankind
to control advances that otherwise may have
dehumanizing effects. This is the great challenge
to education, to the great communications media
and, above all, to those who hold in their hands
the power to make decisions on technology.
