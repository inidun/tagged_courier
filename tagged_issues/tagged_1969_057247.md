>9f ease beneath a tree
A flashback to nomadic life in Siberia nearly 2,500 years ago, this Scythian cast gold
relief (5 in. by 6 in.) is a striking example of the rich metalwork with which these
early people of the steppes decorated their persons and possessions. Hunters and
herdsmen, the Scythians created and developed in south-east Europe and western
Asia an original culture in which art enjoyed pride of place. In this plaque showing
two saddled horses and three riders at ease beneath a tree, a Scythian artist has
captured a moment of repose in an errant existence in the vastness of the steppes.

TO OUR READERS
On the threshold of the New Year, the UNESCO COURIER
is happy to extend Season's Greetings to all its readers in more
than 125 countries. In the months ahead, the international
staff of Editors will seek to present a broad panorama
of major international problems in science, education,
the arts and communication.
With this issue the UNESCO COURIER appears in a very
slightly reduced format (a fraction of an inch) necessitated by
a change in the offset rotary presses used by our printers.
The economies thus effected will enable us to maintain our
current sales price despite the considerable rise in printing
costs during the past year. This modification in format in
no way reduces the editorial space of the magazine.

Many of the fictional places described
in the works of the American novelist
William Faulkner were actually modelled
on localities in Lafayette County,
Mississippi, Faulkner's lifelong home.
The United States Is one of
the countries which have made the
greatest efforts In nature conservation.
Nevertheless, many of the places that
Faulkner knew, including forest areas,
have been destroyed or altered In the
continuing process of land-clearing and
modernization. These starkly-outlined
trees with their mutilated trunks are
all that remain of a once luxuriant forest

### 188408: Can we keep our planet habitable?
CAN WE KEEP
OUR PLANET
HABITABLE ?
by Michel Bâtisse
FeOR more than 40,000 years,
Homo sapiens has applied himself,
patiently, laboriously, unremittingly, to
the task of conquering his planet,
extending his dominion over all other
creatures and taming the vast forces
of nature.
From this, at the start, foolhardy
and unequal contest, he has emerged
victorious. Not a single corner of the
globe has escaped his scrutiny; no
species of animal has held out against
him. He has imposed his will on
rivers and even the seas. He has
swept away forests and replaced them
with crops. Today he rockets into
space. He seems to have achieved
total victory too total to be lasting.
Until a few decades ago the
triumphant progress of a technological
civilization based on scientific know¬
ledge seemed to confirm man's total
victory. Then, all at once, danger
signals were observed. In a brief
period of his relatively short history,
man, a "Johnny-come-lately" on earth,
4 MICHEL BATISSE, engineer and physicist,
is head of the Division of Natural Resources
of Unesco's Department of the Advance¬
ment of Science.
has so effectively conquered nature
that he is now in the process of
destroying it.
Hasty felling of forests to clear new
land for crops; swift and reckless
encroachment on the countryside to
make place for tentacular cities,
factories, highways and aerodromes;
destruction and erosion of the soil;
pollution of air and water; disappear¬
ance of wildlife; accumulation of waste
products and mounds of rubbish;
defacement of rural scenery; the
increasing poisoning of our planet
all are the bitter fruit of man's
technological skill, of the exponential
rate of increase in population and the
modern mystique of productivity.
These too are the mortal dangers
that threaten the thin layer of the earth
known as the biosphere the meeting
point of land, air and waters where
life can exist, the environment on
which man depends inescapably for
his survival.
In view of this increasingly critical
situation, Unesco, in September 1968,
called an intergovernmental conference
of specialists to study the ideas of
modern science on the rational use
and conservation of the resources of
the biosphere and to propose measures
for national and international action.
The Conference on the Biosphere
was organized in co-operation with
the United Nations, the Food and
Agriculture Organization, the World
Health Organization, the International
Biological Programme and the Inter¬
national Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources. It
brought to the Paris headquarters of
Unesco, 240 delegates from 62 na¬
tions and 90 representatives from
International organizations.
It is not the first time that scientists
have taken up these problems, but
the Paris conference was the first
occasion on which representatives of
governments have met to appraise the
world situation and to initiate steps
for remedial action.
Conference discussions revealed a
striking identity of views on the causes
and gravity of problems posed by the
deterioration of our planetary environ¬
ment. The conclusions reached are
rigorous: the situation is degenerating
rapidly and far more dangerously
than most people realize, especially
city people who have- forgotten to
what extent they depend on nature
and its resources. Urgent action is
needed.
But do remedies in fact exist? On
this extremely complex question, the
## [Page 5](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/057247engo.pdf#page=5) 🆗
### 188408: Can we keep our planet habitable?
conference could do no more than
formulate general principles and lay
down guidelines for action to be taken
without delay.
I.VERYTHING would be
simpler, no doubt, if there were not so
many people in the world and if their
needs were fewer. That is the view¬
point of certain "conservationists", who
yearn for a Golden Age and Paradise
on Earth.
The conference, on the contrary,
concluded that it is indeed possible
to reconcile the needs of man with the
preservation of nature, and that the
only realistic attitude is one which
endorses a "rational utilization" of
natural resources, it being understood
that rational utilization comprises all
the imperatives of conservation so as
to ensure the continuity of the world's
resources.
Protection of threatened plants and
animals, creation of national parks and
reserves, campaigns against erosion,
contamination and pollution are thus
fundamental to a policy of rational
utilization of our natural resources.
Similarly, studies of biological
productivity in natural environments
could provide a sound scientific basis
for decisions on land use, the most
fertile areas being reserved for
farming, others being earmarked for
urban development, highways, afforest¬
ation, recreation facilities and so on.
While emphasizing that the quantita¬
tive needs of productivity must be
met, the conference reaffirmed man's
own important need to preserve or
restore the quality of his environ¬
ment, by combatting pollution of every
kind and through a reconciliation with
nature.
Science, that is, clear understanding
of natural phenomena and the conse¬
quences of man's own actions, offers
solutions to the multiple problems
posed by this reconciliation. New
research will thus be needed, in which
all branches of the natural and social
sciences could collaborate.
If present knowledge and experience
were applied effectively, it would help
to solve many of our current diffi¬
culties. But a tremendous effort in
public information and education,
aimed at every level and every age
group of the population, is indis¬
pensable if we are to reverse today's
trends and find a way out of the
present impasse without losing time.
In practical terms, the conference
asked Unesco to map out a long-
term, international and interdisciplinary
programme based on its final recom¬
mendations. This programme on "Man
and the Biosphere" will deal with
scientific, technical, educational and
institutional problems relating to the
rational use of natural resources and
the improvement of the environment.
It will be submitted for approval to
Unesco's General Conference at its
next meeting in October 1970.
The success of this programme will
depend, in the final analysis, on the
determination shown by peoples and
governments of all countries. The
organization of mankind and the level
of its political maturity lag far behind
its technological potential. Never¬
theless, it is imperative, while there is
still time, for man to embark on a
rational renovation of his planet.
The Conference on the Biosphere
brought home a fundamental truth.
In freeing himself from the forces of
nature by his ingenuity and skills,
man has become his own worst enemy,
the greatest threat to his own survival.
His vainglorious power has brought
him face to face with a new and
fundamental responsibility: the future
of the human race on Planet Earth.

### 57249: The Biosphere: a delicate balance between man and nature
THE BIOSPHERE
a delicate balance
between Man and Nature
by René Dubos
The Biosphere is a new word which every thinking individual today
ought to make part of his vocabulary. It means the thin layer of air,
water and land on our Planet Earth where life exists. The article below
describes how man's exploitation of nature and his environment has
affected the delicate balance of the Biosphere. It is based on an
important study prepared by the American biologist, René Dubos,
who benefitted from the findings of an international panel of experts
including Dr. François Bourlière, professor of gerontology at the Faculty
of Medicine, Paris, and president of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources; Marion Clawson,
director of the Land-Use and Management Programme for Resources
of the Future, Washington; the British ecologist Frank Fraser Darling
(see page 24), and specialists from Unesco, the Food and Agriculture
Organization and the World Health Organization. The study was
presented as a basic text to the international conference on Man and
the Biosphere, held in Unesco, Paris, in September 1968.
A,ILL men are migrants from
a common origin. Their various races
have undergone minor modifications
during prehistoric and historic times
as a result of the migrations that
exposed them to different environ¬
mental factors and led them to adopt
different ways of life.
But on the whole, their genetic
endowment is still much the same as
it was several tens of thousands of
years ago. Furthermore, there is no
indication that it will change signifi¬
cantly in the near future, because
the normal process of genetic evolu¬
tion is much too slow, even though
natural selection is still at work. For
this reason, human life can be sus¬
tained only within the fairly narrow
range of physical and chemical limits
that fit the anatomic and physiological
characteristics of Homo sapiens.
The fact that modern man is
constantly moving into new environ¬
ments gives the impression that he
is enlarging the range of his biological
RENE DUBOS has devoted his entire life
to the effects of the environment on man
and the impact of human life on the environ¬
ment. Professor of microbiology and experi¬
mental pathology at Rockefeller University,
New York, he is the author of a score of
books and studies on the subject, including
"Man, Medicine and Environment' (Praeger,
New York, 1968), "Man Adapting" (Yale Uni¬
versity Press 1965), "Unseen World" (Rocke¬
feller Institute Press, 1962), "Dreams of
Reason: Science" and Utopias" (Columbia
University Press, 1960), 'Mirage of Health"
(Harper, New York, 1959; George Allen and
Unwin, London, 1960; In paperback, Double-
day, New York, 1961), 'So Human an Animal'
(Scnbner, New York, 1968).
adaptabilities and thus escaping from
the bondage of his evolutionary past.
But this is an illusion. Wherever he
goes, and whatever he does, man can
function only to the extent that he
maintains or creates around himself a
micro-environment similar to the one
within which he evolved.
He moves at the bottom of the sea
or in outer space only if he remains
linked to the earth by an umbilical
cord or is confined within enclosures
that almost duplicate the terrestrial
atmosphere. He can survive in
environments polluted with chemicals,
noise, and excessive stimuli, but he
retains physical and mental health only
if he protects himself by devices that
shelter him from these environmental
pollutants.
Granted these biological limitations,
it remains true on the other hand that
man is today as adaptable as he was
during the late Stone Age when he
established settlements over much of
the earth. During the past few
decades, countless persons have sur¬
vived the frightful ordeal of modern
warfare or of concentration camps.
Under normal conditions, the bio¬
logical mechanisms of adaptation
are powerfully supplemented by
mechanisms that do not require any
change in man's biological nature.
All over the world, the most crowded,
polluted and brutal cities are also the
ones which have the greatest appeal
and in which population is increasing
the fastest. Economic wealth is being
produced by men and women working
under extreme nervous tension amidst
the infernal noise of high-power
equipment, typewriters, and telephones,
in atmospheres contaminated with
chemical fumes or tobacco smoke.
Because man is endowed with such
remarkable ability to tolerate conditions
profoundly different from the ones
under which he evolved, the myth has
grown that he can endlessly and safely
transform his life and his environment
by technological and social inno¬
vations; but this is not the case. On
the contrary, the very fact that he
readily achieves biological and socio-
cultural adjustments to many different
forms of stress and of undesirable
conditions paradoxically spells danger
for his individual welfare and for the
future of the human race.
Man can achieve some form of
tolerance to environmental pollution,
excessive environmental stimuli, crowd¬
ed and competitive social contacts,
the estrangement of life from the
natural biological cycles, and other
consequences of life in the urban and
technological world. This tolerance
enables him to overcome effects that
are unpleasant or traumatic when first
experienced. But in many cases, it is
achieved through organic and mental
processes which may result in the
chronic and degenerative disorders
that so commonly spoil adult life and
old age, even in the most prosperous
countries.
Man can learn also to tolerate ugly
surroundings, dirty skies, and polluted
streams. He can survive even though
he completely disregards the cosmic
ordering of biological rhythms. He can _
live without the fragrance of flowers, 7
the song of birds, the exhilaration of '
natural scenery and other biological
stimuli of the natural world.

THE BIOSPHERE (Continued)
How many square feet per inhabitant?
This loss of amenities and elimina¬
tion of the stimuli under which he
evolved as a biological and mental
being may have no obvious detrimental
effect on his physical appearance
or his ability to perform as part of
the economic or technologic machine.
But the ultimate result can be and
often is an impoverishment of life, a
progressive loss of the qualities that
we identify with humanness and a
weakening of physical and mental
sanity.
Air, water, soil, fire, the rhythms of
nature and the variety of living things,
are of interest not only as chemical
mixtures, physical forces, or biological
phenomena; they are the very in¬
fluences that have shaped human life
and thereby created deep human
needs that will not change in the
foreseeable future. The pathetic week¬
end exodus to the country or beaches,
the fireplaces in overheated city apart¬
ments, the sentimental attachment to
animal pets or even to plants, testify
to the persistence in man of biological
and emotional hungers that developed
during his evolutionary past and he
cannot outgrow.
Like Anteus of the Greek legend,
man loses his strength when his feet
are off the ground.
We

1 HILE the genetic endow¬
ment of Homo sapiens has not under¬
gone any significant alterations since
the late Stone Age, it is obvious that
man's interaction with his environment
has greatly changed with time and
differs from place to place. The reason
is that mankind as a whole possesses
a wide range of genetic potentialities,
most of which remain unexpressed
under ordinary conditions. These
potentialities are developed through
the creative effects of the responses
that each person makes to environ¬
mental stimuli.
Man cannot modify significantly the
genetic constitution of the human race,
but he has a large measure of control
over the quality of human life because
he has learned to manipulate the envir¬
onmental factors which condition
the detectable expressions of his
genetic endowment. Individually and
collectively, man makes himself
through responsible choices at each
moment of his existence.
In theory, all human beings have
much the same essential biological
needs; but in practice actual needs
are socially conditioned and therefore
differ profoundly from one human
group to another. Even food require¬
ments cannot be defined without
regard to historical and social factors.
The value of an article of food is not
determined only by its content in
protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins,
minerals, and other chemical com¬
ponents.
A particular food has, in addition to
its metabolic values, symbolic values
which make it either essential or
unacceptable to a particular group of
persons depending upon their beliefs
and past experiences. These symbolic
aspects of nutrition are not of im¬
portance only among primitive people.
Americans are even more reluctant to
eat horse meat than Frenchmen are to
eat cornbread.
Furthermore, needs are not unchan¬
geable. Some which appear almost
essential today may become trivial in
another generation, not because man's
biological nature will change, but
because the social environment usually
undergoes rapid and profound modi¬
fications. It may turn out for example
that the individual motor car will
progressively disappear if driving
loses its appeal because of traffic
congestion or boredom, and if people
learn to use more of their leisure time
within walking distance of their homes.
The individual detached house so
characteristic of the North American
continent may also become obsolete
once home ownership loses its sym¬
bolic meaning of economic and social
independence by reason of more gen¬
eralized prosperity and financial secur¬
ity. Changes in automobile usage and
in housing habits would probably have
enormous effects on the fate of land
areas, as would of course changes in
the methods of food production.
The phrase "essential need" is there¬
fore meaningless because in practice
people need what they want. As
technological civilization develops,
needs are determined less and
less by the fundamental biological
requirements of Homo sapiens and
more by the social expectations.
These expectations are created by
the environment in which man lives
and especially in which he has been
brought up. The members of a given
social group generally come to desire,
and consequently develop a need for,
whatever is regarded as most desirable
by the group. The good life is identi¬
fied with the satisfaction of these
needs whatever their biological utility.
Wants become needs not only for
individual persons, but "also for whole
societies. Elaborate religious in¬
stitutions and ceremonies were ap¬
parently a need for the 13th century
European towns, which devoted to the
creation of churches and monasteries
a percentage of their human and
economic resources that appears
extravagant to us in relation to the
other aspects of medieval life.
Our own societies seem particularly
concerned with creating a middle-class
materialism with a veneer of uplifting
platitudes. This creates its own pattern
of costly demands irrelevant to biolog¬
ical necessity for example costly
carbonated beverages and narcotizing
television programmes.
IHE environments men
create through their wants constitute to
a very large extent the formula of life
they transmit to succeeding gener¬
ations. Thus, in addition to affecting
present-day life, the characteristics of
the environment condition young
people and thereby determine the
future of society. It is unfortunate
therefore that we know so little and
make so little effort to learn how the
total environment affects the physical
and mental development of children,
and how much of the influence persists
in adult life.
There is no doubt that the latent
potentialities of human beings have a
better chance of being realized when
the total environment is sufficiently
diversified to provide a variety or
stimulating experiences, especially for
the young. As more persons find the
opportunity to express a larger per¬
centage of their biological endowment
under diversified conditions, society
becomes richer and civilizations, con¬
tinue to unfold.
In contrast, if the surroundings and
ways of life are highly stereotyped, the
only components of man's nature that
can become expressed and flourish
are those adapted to the narrow range
of prevailing conditions.
Historically, man was very slow to
expand his horizons and develop his
full genetic potential. Thus, sur¬
rounding early man with nature does
not seem to guarantee a rich, diverse
existence. Furthermore, in some
present rural areas of the developed
countries, man has produced a
monotony of both crops and culture
that stifles human development.
The present trends of life in
prosperous countries are usually
assumed to represent what people
want; but in reality the trends are
determined by what is available for
choice. What people come to want
is largely determined by the choices
readily available to them early in life.
Many children growing up in some of
the most prosperous suburbs of
industrialized countries may suffer
from a critical deprivation of ex¬
periences and this determines the
triviality of their adult lives. In
contrast, some poor areas of the world

By 2000 A.D. it is estimated that the world's population will reach the 7,000 million mark.
Many cities which today have several million inhabitants will grow into vast megalopolises.
Already afflicted by incessant noise, fumes and stress, modern city dwellers increasingly
feel the need to escape from these "unnatural" living conditions and seek relief in the
tranquility, clean air and open spaces of the countryside that have still been spared.

provide human environments that are
so stimulating and diversified that
many distinguished adults emerge from
them despite the economic poverty of
their early years.
There is no doubt, in any case,
concerning the sterilizing atmosphere
of many modern housing developments
which are sanitary and efficient, but
inimical to the full expression of
human potentialities. All over the
world, many of these developments
are planned as if their only function
was to provide disposable cubicles
for dispensable people. Irrespective
of their genetic -constitution, most
young people raised in such a fea¬
tureless environment, and limited to a
narrow range of life experiences, will
suffer from a kind of deprivation that
will cripple them intellectually and
mentally.
In judging the human quality of an
environment, it is essential to keep in
mind that passive exposure to stimuli
is not enough to elicit individual
development. The stimulus becomes
formative only if the organism is given
a chance to respond to it actively and
creatively. Amusement parks and
zoological gardens, richly endowed as
they may be, are no substitute for
situations in which the developing child
can gain direct experience of the world
through active participation. Juvenile
delinquency is probably caused to a
very large extent by the failure of
the modern world to provide oppor¬
tunities for the creative expression of
physical and mental vigour during a
human being's most active period of
development.
Man has been highly successful as
a biological species because he is
extremely adaptable. He can hunt or
farm, be a meat-eater or a vegetarian,
live in the mountains or by the
seashore, be a loner or a team
member, function under aristocratic,
democratic, or totalitarian institutions,
but history shows also that societies
that were once efficient, because highly
specialized, rapidly collapsed when
conditions changed. A highly-spec¬
ialized society, like a narrow spec¬
ialist, is rarely adaptable.
Cultural homogenization and social
regimentation resulting from the
creeping monotony of over-organiz¬
ed and over-technicized life, standard¬
ized patterns of education, mass
communication and passive entertain¬
ment, will make it progressively more
difficult to exploit fully the biological
richness of the human species and
may handicap the further development
of civilization.
We must shun uniformity of sur¬
roundings as much as absolute
conformity in behaviour and tastes.
We must strive instead to create as
many diversified environments as
possible. Richness and diversity of
physical and social environments
constitutes a crucial aspect of function-
alism, whether in the planning of
rural and urban areas, the design of
dwellings, or the management of
individual life.
Diversity may result in some loss
of mechanical and administrative
efficiency and will certainly increase
stresses, but the more important goal
is to provide the many kinds of soil
that will permit the germination of the
seeds now dormant in man's nature.
|T is often assumed that
progress depends on man's ability to
conquer Nature. In reality, there exist
throughout mankind biological and
emotional needs that require not
conquest of Nature, but rather har¬
monious collaboration with its forces.
The ultimate goal of conservation
policies should be to manage the en¬
vironment in such a manner that it
contributes to the physical and mental
health of man and to the flowering of
civilization.
Unfortunately, while there is much
know-how concerning certain limited
aspects of conservation practices, there
is little understanding of what should
be conserved and why. In fact, the
goal should not be to conserve but
rather to guide the orderly evolution
of Man-Nature interrelationships.
Conservation certainly implies a
balance between the multiple com¬
ponents of nature including man.
This is a doctrine difficult to reconcile
with the present trends of modern
civilization, built on the Faustian
concept that man should recognize
no limit to his power. Faustian man
finds satisfaction in the mastery of the
external world and is engaged in
endless pursuit of success for success'
sake, even when he tries to reach the
unattainable. No chance for balance
here.
To be compatible with the spirit of
modern civilization, the practices of
conservation cannot be exclusively or
even primarily concerned with saving
parts of the natural world or man-
made artifacts for the sake of preserv¬
ing individual specimens of interest or
beauty. Their goal should be the
maintenance of conditions under which
man can develop his most desirable
potentialities.
Since man relates to his total en¬
vironment and especially is shaped
by it, conservation implies a quality
of relationship rather than a static
condition. Man must engage in a
creative interplay with his fellows,
animals, plants, and all the objects

THE BIOSPHERE (Continued)
A countryside adjusted to human limitations
of nature that directly or indirectly
affect him, and which he affects.
From the human point of view, the
total environment, including the re¬
mains of the past, acquires its full
significance only when harmoniously
integrated with the living tissues of
man's life. It can even be demonstrat¬
ed that because they shape irreversibly
all aspects of human development,
environmental forces are, so to speak,
woven in man's physical and mental
fabric.
The ill-defined meaning of the word
Nature compounds the difficulty of
formulating a scientific basis for the
philosophy of conservation. If we
mean by nature the environment as
it would exist in the absence of man,
then very little of it survives. Not
even the strictest conservation policies
could restore the primeval environ¬
ment; nor would this be necessarily
desirable if it could be done. Nature
is never static. Physical forces and
living creatures alter it continuously;
animals especially modify parts of it
to fit their biological and behavioural
needs.
12
F<OR animals as well as for
men, the kind of environment which is
most satisfactory is one with which
they are familiar and in which they have
introduced modifications that facilitate
their biological and social life, such
as territorial marks, trails for explora¬
tion, access to water supplies, re¬
treats for mating, sheltered areas to
protect the young. In general, the
ideal conditions imply a complementary
cybernetic relationship between a par¬
ticular environment and a particular
living thing.
Civilized nature should be regarded
not as an object to preserve unchang¬
ed, not as one to dominate and exploit,
but rather as a kind of garden to
develop according to its own poten¬
tialities and in which human beings
develop according to their own genius.
Ideally, man and nature should be
joined in a non-repressive and creative
functioning order.
Nature can be tamed without being
destroyed. Unfortunately, the word
taming has come to imply subjugating
animals and nature. Like men and
animals, landscapes tamed in this
manner lose their real essence, and
become spiritless. To be biologically
successful, taming demands the estab¬
lishment of a relationship that does
not deprive the tamed organism-man,
animal or nature of the individuality
that is the sine qua non of survival.
There are two kinds of satisfactory
landscape. One is a landscape as
little disturbed as possible by human
intervention. The other kind of
satisfactory landscape is one created
by man and in which he has achieved
harmony with natural forces. Most
commonly, this has been achieved
through centuries of interplay between
human societies and the land on which
they have settled.
What we long for most often is not
nature in the raw, but a landscape
adjusted to human limitations and
expressing the aspirations of civilized
life in its many different forms. For
this reason, each people has its
preferred landscape, constituting an
integration and synthesis of natural
forces and of cultural traditions.
Indeed, much of what we regard
today as natural environment is in fact
a product of history. The valleys of
the Nile and Euphrates were shaped
by human labour during the Neolithic
period. And much of the arable land
all over the world is also the product
of man's management of the primeval
forest.
Many of the plants now considered
typical of the Mediterranean landscape,
the olive tree for example, were in fact
introduced from Iran. The tulip, which
is now such a characteristic of the
Netherlands, was first brought there
from Turkey as late as the 16th century.
Irrespective of social changes, cities
and their streets, the highways link¬
ing them, as well as the countryside
surrounding them, also retain traces
of the character imposed on them by
early historical influences. The future
development of new cities, especially
in the U.S.A., is bound to be constrain¬
ed by the grid-iron pattern and the
network of highways that shaped their
early growth.
Since most of the environment as it
exists today is a creation of man, and
in turn influences the subsequent de¬
velopment of human societies, environ¬
mental quality must take into consid¬
eration not so much the preservation
of the natural state, as the effects of
the environment on the future of civi¬
lized life.
From this point of view, the situation
looks very dark in most parts of the
world. Everywhere, societies seem
willing to accept ugliness for the sake
of increase in economic wealth.
Whether natural or humanized, the
landscape retains its beauty only in
the areas that are not valuable for
industrial and economic exploitation.
The change from wilderness to dump
heap symbolizes at present the course
of technological civilization. Yet the
material wealth we are creating will
not be worth having if creation entails
the raping of nature and the destruc¬
tion of environmental charm.

MR. OTTER
AND THE UNWITTING
FISHERMAN
What happens when man upsets one
of the delicate balances in nature ?
This little story gives one example of
the boomerang effect of man's spo¬
liation of wildlife, in this case the
harm caused by killing off the Offer.
Mr. Otter loves fish and thus seems to
be a big rival of the fisherman.
Mr. Fisherman thinks he is acting in the
interests of all by killing the otter.
Mr. Fisherman finds his catch has
dwindled seriously.
Mr. Otter caught mostly old or sick
fish. When he was killed off, there were
more sick fish to spread disease and the
fish colony was decimated. Moral:
Mr. Fisherman had unwittingly destroyed
one of nature's safeguards against
degeneration and epidemics, without
which rivers vould soon be depopulated.

### 57249: The Biosphere: a delicate balance between man and nature
In the past, the primeval wilderness
progressively evolved into a humanized
form of nature through the continuous
"wooing" of the earth by peasants,
monks, and princes. We must now
learn to convert the drab wilderness
generated by technology into a new
kind of urbanized and industrialized
nature worthy of being called civilized.
In the huge urban areas of the
modern world we must supply the
inhabitants with something more than
amusement parks, highways for
sightseers and paved grounds for
weekend campers. No social philo¬
sophy of urbanization can be success¬
ful if it does not deal with urban man
as part of the highly-integrated web
which unites all forms of life.
There have been many large cities
in the past, but until recent times their
inhabitants were able to maintain fairly
close and direct contacts with the
countryside or with the sea, and thus
could satisfy the physiological and psy¬
chological needs acquired during the
human past. Historical experience,
especially during the 19th century
shows that urban populations are apt
to develop ugly tempers when com¬
pletely deprived of such contacts.
Saving nature in both its wild and
humanized aspects is thus an essential
part of urban planning.
Wherever man has been successful
in "wooing" the land and assuring its
biological viability, success has result¬
ed from his ability and willingness to
plan his creations within the con¬
straints determined by climate, top¬
ography, and other local characteristics
of Nature. In the past, this was also
true of cities which were planned
in accord with certain geographical
imperatives.
Modern cities are in contrast devel¬
oping without any regard to physical
and biological constraints and only
under the influence of economic and
political imperatives. The belief that
man can "master" the environment and
achieve independence of his innate
biological limitations has generated
the impression that there is no need
for disciplines in the development of
cities. Most urban problems derive
precisely from such a misapplied inter¬
pretation of freedom.
Town planning as well as country
planning will not be successful until
we learn again to recognize and accept
the restraints that are inherent in man's
biological nature and in geographical
conditions. In fact the whole concept
of planning the use of our environment,
or perhaps what is better described in
French as "aménagement du territoire,"
is only emerging as a new discipline
and it is high time that it be developed
all over the world on sound ecological
principles.
Rational environmental planning
cannot be done by acting under
the pressure of emergency as is now
the general practice. Unfortunately,

the world is prompted not by compre¬
hensive, integrated programmes of
water and land use but by the threat
of floods or of water shortages. Poli¬
cies for the control of soil erosion
are enacted only after irreversible dam¬
age has been done.
There is a general awareness of the
dangers posed by noise, environmental
pollution, and the misuse of drugs, but
effective measures are rarely taken
before some catastrophe creates an
atmosphere of panic. In fact, most
environmental programmes emerge as
empirical adaptive responses to acute
crises and usually take the form of
disconnected palliative measures de¬
signed to minimize social unrest or
the depletion of a few natural re¬
sources.
For lack of adequate knowledge,
the environment is being manipulated
almost exclusively on the basis of
technological criteria without much
concern for its biological and psychol¬
ogical effects. These effects should
be considered not only in the here
and now, but in their long-range conse¬
quences and in their relevance to
mankind as a whole.
Before long, all parts of the globe
will have been occupied or exploited
by man and the supply of many natural
resources will have become critical.
Careful husbandry of the spaceship
Earth rather than exploitation of natural
resources, will then be the key to
human survival.
Developing stations in outer space
or on the bottom of oceans will not
modify significantly if at all the physical
limits of human existence. Man
emerged on the earth, evolved under
its influence, was shaped by it, and
biologically he is bound to it forever.
He may dream of stars and engage in
casual flirtations with other worlds,
but he will remain wedded to the earth,
his sole source of sustenance.
As the world population increases,
the topographical limitations of the
spaceship Earth and the inevit¬
able exhaustion of its natural resources
will inevitably require that its economy
be based on strict ecological principles.
This imperative necessity however, is
not yet widely recognized. The very
word ecology (the interrelationships of
qrganisms and their environments) was
introduced into the scientific language
only 100 years ago by Ernst Haeckel,
the German biologist, so recent is the
awareness that all components of
nature are interwoven in a single
pattern and that we too are part of
the pattern I
Until now, man has behaved as if
the areas available to him were un¬
limited, and as if these were infinite
reservoirs of air, soil, water, and other
resources. He could do this with relat¬
ive impunity in the past because there
was always some other place where
he could go, start a new life, and
engage in any kind of adventure that
he chose.
Since the evolutionary and historical
experiences of man are woven in his
mental fabric he naturally finds it
difficult not to behave as a nomad
and hunter. It is not natural for him
to rest quietly in a corner of the earth
and husband it carefully. His thought¬
lessness in provoking ecological situa¬
tions that are potentially dangerous
originates partly from the fact that he
has not yet learned to live within the
constraints of his spaceship.
The ecological attitude is so unfam¬
iliar, even to many scientists, that
it is often taken to imply acceptance
of a completely static system. Stud¬
ents of human sociology have ex¬
pressed concern lest the ecologist's
professional interest in the well-ba¬
lanced smoothly-functioning, steady-
state ecosystem of the pond be
extrapolated uncritically to the whole
earth and its human population. They
are right in emphasizing that man's
relation to his total environment cannot
be regarded as a steady-state ecosys¬
tem because this would imply that the
human adventure has come to an end.
The physical forces of the environ¬
ment are forever changing, slowly
but inexorably. Furthermore, all forms
of life including human life are contin¬
uously evolving and thereby making
their own contribution to environmen¬
tal changes. Finally it seems to be
one of man's fundamental needs to i Q
search endlessly for new environments | <J
and for new adventures. There is no
possibility therefore of maintaining a
status quo.

### 57249: The Biosphere: a delicate balance between man and nature
THE BIOSPHERE (Continued)
The challenge of the urban landscape
Even if we had enough learning and
wisdom to achieve at any given time
a harmonious state of ecological equi¬
librium between mankind and the other
components of the spaceship Earth, it
would be a dynamic equilibrium, and
this would be compatible with man's
continuing development.
The important question is whether
the interplay between man and his
natural and social surroundings will be
controlled by blind forces as seems
to be the case for most if not all animal
species, or whether it can be guided
by deliberate, rational judgements.
Admittedly, all of man's biological
evolution so far and much of his his¬
tory have been the result of accidents
or blind choices. Many deliberate ac¬
tions have had consequences that had
not been foreseen and often proved
to be unfortunate. In fact, most of the
environmental problems which now
plague technological civilization derive
from discoveries and decisions made
to solve other problems and to enlarge
human life.
The internal combustion engine,
synthetic detergents, durable pesti¬
cides and medicinal drugs, were intro¬
duced with a useful purpose in mind,
but some of their side effects have
been calamitous. Efficient methods of
printing have made good books avail¬
able at low prices, but are cluttering
mail boxes with despicable publications
and useless advertisements; these
burden waste baskets with mountains
of refuse which must be burned and
thus pollute the air.
14
ASTE disposal is becoming
as critical as resource production. It is
obvious, from the law of the conserva¬
tion of matter, that waste is produced
exactly in the amount that resources
are used. What is not so obvious is
that, in the long run, the reverse must
also be true: resource production
depends upon the utilization of waste.
Otherwise man will convert the bio¬
sphere into a global dump.
Waste that nature cannot process
accumulates and pollutes the environ¬
ment. Converting such waste into a
usable form not only solves a problem
of pollution, but also contributes posi¬
tively to environmental quality and the
production of future resources.
Like animal life, human life is affect¬
ed by evolutionary forces that blindly
fit the organism to its environments.
Human history, however, involves also
the unfolding of visionary imagin¬
ings. Creating a desirable future
demands more than foresight; it
requires vision.
The 18th century philosophers of
the Enlightenment had imagined new
ways of life long before there was any
factual basis for their vision. They
prepared the blueprint for most of what
is new and desirable in modern soc¬
ieties on the faith that objective
knowledge, scientific technology, and
social reforms, could some day liber¬
ate human beings from fear and des¬
titution. Throughout human history,
progress has b'een a movement toward
imagined Utopian goals; the realization
of these aims has in turn inspired new
goals.
Mankind's greatest achievements
are the products of vision. One need
think only of the marvellous parks,
gardens, and monuments that have
survived from all great civilizations to
realize the creative force of a long-
range view in shaping desirable
humanized environments.
The great parks and gardens all over
the world originated from that extra¬
ordinary sense which is peculiar to
man, the imaginary vision of things to
come. For example, several books by
European landscape architects of the
eighteenth century show drawings of
parks as they appeared at the time
of their creation, with the naked banks
of newly-created brooks and lakes,
among puny trees and shrubs.
In these drawings, the landscapes
have an abstract and cold elegance,
but lack substance or atmosphere.
One has to assume that the landscape
architects had composed the expanses
of water, lawns, and flowers to fit the
silhouettes of trees and the masses
of shrubbery not as these components
of the landscape existed when first
organized but as they were to become
with the passage of time.
The architects had visualized the
future appearance of their intellectual
imaginings and planned their actual
designs and plantings so as to give
scope to the creative effects of natural
forces. Similar visionary anticipations
account for most of the great urban
sites and vistas throughout the world.
While the great gardens, parks, and
urban vistas created by past civili¬
zation still delight our senses and
minds, other kinds of landscapes must
be conceived to meet present and
future needs. The old country roads,
lined with stately trees, provided poetic
and practical shelter for the man on
foot or horseback and for slow-moving
coaches.
A modern highway, however, must
be designed in such a manner that
horizons, curves, trees and other ob¬
jects of view are related to the physio¬
logical needs and , limitations of
motorists moving at high speed. The
evolution from parkways and super
highways involves aesthetic factors
based on physiological imperatives, as
much as economic and technologic
considerations.
Envisioning an environment satis¬
fying the needs of an immense techno¬
logical society is of course vastly
more complicated than visualizing the
future appearance of a park or
designing a super highway. But
certain principles hold true for all
environmental planning, because they
are based on the unchangeable and
universal aspects of man's nature.
0,IN the one hand, the
genetic endowment of Homo sapiens
has. changed only in minor details
since the Stone Age, and there is no
chance that it can be significantly,
usefully, or safely modified in the
foreseeable future. This genetic per¬
manency defines the human race, and
determines the physiological limits
beyond which human life cannot be
safely altered by social and tech¬
nological innovations. In the final
analysis, the frontiers of cultural and
technological development are deter¬
mined by man's own biological
frontiers and therefore by the genetic
constitution he acquired during the
evolutionary past.
On the other hand, mankind has a
large reserve of potentialities that be¬
come expressed only to the extent that
circumstances are favourable. The
physical surroundings condition not
only the biological aspects of pheno-
typic expressions but also their mental
aspects. Environmental planning can
thus play a key rôle in enabling human
beings to realize their potentialities.
One can take it for granted that there
is a better chance to convert these
potentialities into actual realizations
when the physical environment is suffi¬
ciently diversified to provide a variety
of stimulating experiences and oppor¬
tunities, especially for the young.
Any change in mental attitude and
in ways of life becomes incorporated
in the human group concerned through
socio-cultural mechanisms, and from
then on it conditions the future devel¬
opment of the group. Socio-cultural
evolution is as much under the influen¬
ce of the environment as is biological
evolution, and almost as irreversible.
Planning for the future demands an
ecological attitude based on the
assumption that man will continuously
bring about evolutionary changes
through his creative potentialities. The
constant interaction between man and
environment inevitably implies contin¬
uous alterations of both alterations
that should always remain within the
constraints imposed by the laws of
Nature and by the unchangeable bio¬
logical and mental characteristics of
man's nature.

For many years there has been a growing awareness everywhere
of the need to create national parks for the conservation of
wildlife. As long ago as 1872, the United States created the
world's first national park at Yellowstone, Colorado (3,400 square
miles). In 1885 Canada followed by establishing Banff National
Park, and the movement spread to Europe, Asia and Africa. East
Africa has now become a world proving ground for modern
conservation practices. This polar bear paradise on the island
of Wrangel, in the Arctic, is one of the U.S.S.R.'s national parks
and reservations, which cover 63,000 square kilometres (the
total area of Belgium and the Netherlands).

A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT THE
ANIMAL WORLD (BEASTS AND MEN)
by Jean Dorst
|AN'S relationship with
nature has consisted to a great
extent in the irrevocable destruction
of habitats, plants and animals without
benefit to mankind in the long run.
The time has now come to take
stock of the situation and to look
ahead, for we have unquestionably
arrived at a crucial point in our
history.
It has taken at least several tens of
thousands of years for the world to
reach its present human population;
yet in only 35 years from now the
earth's population will have doubled.
There are thus more consumers, and
also many more "workers" to change
the face of the earth, and the latter
have at their disposal vast sources of
energy as well as far more powerful
tools than their predecessors ever had.
This accounts for the depressing
balance sheet of the present epoch,
all the more dismal because our
attitude toward nature has scarcely
altered from that of our ancestors':
from many points of view we have
remained at the stage of predatory
economics what German economists
call "Raubwirtschaft". We are still
trying to apply theories devised
centuries ago. We still believe in the
myth of nature's inexhaustible wealth
and in a few "formulas" for turning
it into fields, forests and artificial
pasturage everywhere on the face of
the earth.
Throughout previous centuries
certain species of animals have
vanished or become rare. The Mi¬
grating Pigeon, the Great Auk, the
JEAN DORST, professor at the zoological
laboratory of the Museum of Natural History
in Paris, is president of the Survival Commis¬
sion of the International Union for Conserva¬
tion of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN),
and president of the Charles Darwin Founda¬
tion, created In 1959 by Unesco and the
government of Ecuador to study the extra¬
ordinary wildlife of the Galapagos Islands.
A prolific author, his major work is 'Avant
Que Nature Meure' (édition Delachaux et
Niestlé, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 1964), a re¬
markable and detailed study of the relation¬
ship between man and nature, which appears
In English this month under the title "Before
Nature Dies' (Collins, London).
Carolina Parakeet, the Quagga Zebra,
the Blue Antelope and several species
of marsupials are the best known
victims in this lamentable necrology.
Destined to become tomorrow's
fossils, many others are still holding
out with their numbers drastically
reduced, vestiges of formerly flourish¬
ing populations.
Nature conservationists, it is true,
have taken positive steps to safeguard
shrinking animal populations. Laws
protecting some species and regulat¬
ing the hunting of others have been
passed, and national parks and
reserves now exist in most countries.
But such measures no longer meet
the situation, for the problem has
taken on far greater scope and
importance. Naturally, everything
possible should be done to save
the last vestiges of wildlife. But the
major problem is to safeguard natural
resources throughout the world and
provide mankind with the means of
survival.
It is undeniable that the earth is
still being pillaged despite the efforts
of biologists and considerable tech¬
nical progress in agriculture, sylvi¬
culture, fishing and harvesting tech¬
niques. On the whole, "renewable"
resources are steadily decreasing,
despite some spectacular progress in
specialized fields.
The situation is particularly serious
in the developing tropical countries
where soils are still being ruined by
unsuitable methods of farming. In the
Indus Valley the population increases
at the rate of 10 mouths to feed
every 5 minutes, but in the same
span of time one acre of land is lost
through erosion accelerated by man's
misuse.
Throughout the world, natural forests
are receding. Fish stocks, one of
man's vital food resources, are being
depleted by overfishing. Whales are
disappearing at a catastrophic rate
from their last refuge in the Antarctic
oceans.
Naturalists understandably fear that

the flora and fauna which make up
natural communities will become rare
or even extinct. But the world at large
might well have to face the disquieting
prospect of losing its renewable
resources ever more rapidly at a time
when the number of consumers is
increasing, and individual needs are
greater because of welcome improve¬
ments in standards of living.
A complete reappraisal should thus
be made of the whole problem of
man's relationship to nature. Despite
technological progress and today's
widespread belief in a machine-
dominated civilization, man continues
to be closely dependent on natural
resources and especially on nature's
primary productivity, of which photo¬
synthesis is the first step. This basic
fact links man closely to the entire
living world.
Man himself is a single cog,
although a vital one, in a complex
mechanism composed of many work¬
ing parts. Dwarfing the individual
human being, whole populations and
even the multitude of species making
up the plant and animal kingdoms, is a
vastly greater entity the living or¬
ganism that forms the entire "bio¬
sphere" of our planet, that is, the thin
layer on which life exists on the outer
surface of the globe.
Ecology the science of relation¬
ships between living beings them¬
selves and between them and their
physical environment teaches us that
biological communities the entire
complex of various plant and animal
populations, occupying specific habi¬
tats have their own distinct ways of
life and are subject to rigid laws
that determine their evolution.
We must become one with this vast
natural complex. Up to the present
time our activities have all been aimed
at destroying or at least reducing the
size of natural habitats by channeling
their production in terms of strictly
human needs. In place of the multitude
of species found in natural forests we
have substituted one-crop fields. The
long-term overall balance sheet very
often shows a deficit, except on the
most fortunate lands, which are res¬
tricted in area.
Obviously man can be only one
of the elements in our planet's
biological equilibrium. In its virgin
state the earth is not favourable to
the growth of our species. To
satisfy our legitimate needs we have
to "manhandle" nature and radically
transform certain environments so as
to increase the proportion of prod
uctivity of immediate use to man.
We shall never again be in a position
to do without fields and man-made
prairies.
This does not mean, however, that
we should apply the same "formula"
indiscriminately: i.e. eliminate wildlife
and change the face of the whole earth
for our immediate benefit. This would
cause the irrevocable disappearance
of wildlife, but above all, would lead
to serious disturbances in the overall
productivity of the whole biosphere.
Use of natural resources and
nature conservation are two sides of
the same problem which is the quest
for maximum return from the bio
sphere for man's well-being. Even if
we are only concerned with the utili¬
tarian factor, we are forced to admit
that man has nothing to gain by
exterminating animals and plants, even
those which at first glance are either
"useless" or seem harmful.
The pursuit of optimum equilibrium
leads logically to the idea of planetary
"management" according to a plan
which takes into account the particular
use to which different types of land
are destined by their nature and the
environment's varying physical and
biotic features. We should, in particu¬
lar, create integral natural reserves,
within which every human activity

Such reserves afford protection for
the flora and fauna closely linked
with a specific habitat, which is the
case of most species of small stature
which have clearly defined needs.
This also enables us to conserve
animal and plant life for which man
may find use in the future nature's
possibilities are indeed far from being
exhausted. If need be, we would be
able to draw on the reserves in these
"banks", as has already been done
with plants, trees in particular.
These integral natural reserves are
not only conservatories but also
natural laboratories for long-term
research removed from any kind of
human interference. Such basic work
in pure research is essential to applied
science if new techniques and pro¬
cedures of resource-use, truly adapted
to local conditions, are to be devised.
At the other end of the scale from
these integral natural reserves are
the areas suitable for development
by man. Man obviously needs to
cultivate a large proportion of the
earth's surface. Only by creating
artificial environments can he gain
high yields from the crops he grows.
I
But we must always bear in mind that
agriculture is the conversion of our
natural capital, particularly the soil.
It follows that only land clearly
destined for agricultural purposes
should be cultivated. Marginal land,
subject to irrevocable and rapid
deterioration from the moment that the
natural habitat is altered, should be
set aside. It is an ecological absurdity
to plunder this type of soil as well
as imprudence on man's part, for in
so doing he risks losing future benefits
from certain environments that his
present knowledge still prevents him
from putting to use.

A LOOK AT THE ANIMAL WORLD (Continued)
The sad fate of the fur seal
The only way to integrate this
marginal land into the human economy
is to use its natural resources within
reason while maintaining its equilib¬
rium relatively undisturbed. Perhaps
in the future, new technical devices
will enable man to draw immediate
benefits from such land, but to
transform it at present would be
to put oneself in the position of a
financier who squanders his capital
for a quick profit instead of invest¬
ing it for greater gains in the
future.
It is in these areas that the aims
of the nature protector and the eco¬
nomist are most clearly seen to be in
harmony. Indeed, when properly used,
this land can immediately produce
sizeable returns. The first rational
use to be made of it is obviously
to maintain extensive forests, whose
existence is amply justified by the
modern world's increasing demand
for timber. Forests, whose planned
exploitation began many years ago,
effectively protect the soil, particu¬
larly on the water-drainage slopes
in mountainous regions.
Controlled and reasonable exploita¬
tion of wildlife by hunting is also
advisable, despite opposition from
certain nature conservationists inspir¬
ed by a commendable but now some¬
what outdated sentimentality. Hunting
matched to the population level of
game animals is a rational use of
this livestock and even increases
its productivity.
In North America, for instance, duck
populations are now systematically
worked over on the basis of
constant studies that reveal the
birds' numerical importance and
distribution. The lakes and marshes
where these birds reproduce, like
every wetland habitat in the world,
are endangered by drainage and
reclamation projects. But their food
yield as game reserves helps to
protect them from the development
projects of the technocrats.
Biologists have recently discovered
that large mamrnals, particularly those
of Africa can be utilized systematically
as meat providers, an important asset
in protein-poor tropical countries.
African savannas can sustain a live-
weight of gazelles, antelopes, buffaloes
and other vegetarian mammals far
superior to the domesticated livestock

for them (see "Unesco Courier", Sep¬
tember 1961, "Africa's Wildlife in
Peril").
The biomass (the total weight of
any given animal species) of wild
ungulates (hoofed animals) can reach
nearly 40 tons per square kilo¬
metre in the grass savannas of the
Congo and Uganda, whereas the
same habitat can maintain only 5è tons
of livestock per square kilometre.
Moreover, though far greater in
number, wild animals do not deplete
the soil because they pasture in a
manner far better adapted to its
regrowth. This factor makes it
feasible to slaughter a given quant¬
ity of gazelles, antelopes, and even
buffaloes and elephants, for meat,
thus ensuring sufficient returns from
these marginal areas unfit for any
direct use by man to guarantee
their protection against untimely
transformations.
The rational putting to use of
wildlife has produced encouraging
results wherever it has been tried
out. In the Soviet Union, the
Saiga antelope, which became so rare
about 1920 that it was believed to
have become extinct, is now protected
on the steppes that stretch from
the south of the U.S.S.R. to Central
Asia. As a result, these otherwise
barren lands have become a positive
economic asset. The size of the
present herds allows 300,000 head of
antelope to be cropped each year,
without endangering the future of
the species, which is protected, but
at the same time integrated into the
economy of the Soviet Union.
Protection of the Alaskan fur seal,
from the Pribiloff Islands in the
northern Pacific, which became almost
extinct about 1911, now yields annually
60,000 high quality skins which consti¬
tute the only resource of these under¬
privileged isles. This promising
achievement is in striking contrast
to the situation in the Austral
Islands and Juan Fernandez and Gala¬
pagos Islands where the fur seal
has been slaughtered to the point
where, in its present numbers, it
is unlikely to be able to re-establish
itself. By squandering this natural
capital man has short-sightedly
killed the goose that laid the
golden egg.
Such examples demonstrate that we
now have sufficient know-how and
tested techniques to discard once
and for all the naive notion that the
face of the earth must be completely
transformed, and that only the relatively

of the iguana after visiting the Galapagos Islands in 1841. A living fossil, survivor of the
great saurians, which once roamed the earth, this awesome-looking reptile is completely
inoffensive. It has survived until our time in the isolation of the Galapagos archipelago,
where Charles Darwin conceived the theory of evolution. It is at Galapagos, a unique

Darwin Foundation in 1959 In co-operation with the government of Ecuador. Here, three

few animals and plants domesticated
thousands of years ago should be
utilized for our benefit.
Instead of destroying wild habitats
and replacing them by artificial fields
and pasture land, we can manage the
entire earth complex. This implies
preserving the earth's diversity and
respecting the natural use of each acre.
Instead of universally applying the
same formula, we should maintain a
balance between the different kinds
of habitats. Forests, marshlands and
wild expanses should be included along
with fields and pasture land in a
single mosaic, taking into account
climate, type of soil, flora and fauna.
Such a balanced totality will certainly
guarantee a far better long-term output
than hasty transformations.
Such sensible management would
also help to protect man's living space.
The problem of the human habitat has
now become a crucial one in a world
beset by rapidly increasing popula¬
tions, tentacular towns and dis¬
figurement of so many localities by
unsightly industrial plants.
We are only just becoming aware
of the social, medical and psycho¬
logical factors involved in this problem,
but already they are revealing the
extent to which nature conservation
and management are closely linked
with the protection of man himself.
There is room for optimism because
man, having now become aware of
the dangers, is weighing the conse¬
quences. He has realized that nature
conservation is not solely the domain
of a few biologists preoccupied with
protecting some rare species of
animals, but is in fact the far greater
problem of the rational use of man¬
kind's natural capital and living space.
A well-planned management policy can
still safeguard this capital while
substantially increasing the income
from it to meet man's legitimate needs.
Such management is primarily the
business of governments and approp¬
riate authorities. It also is the
concern of the major international
organizations: the United Nations
and particularly Unesco and FAO,
have clearly shown that they are
deeply concerned with the problems
posed by the management of nature
and its utilization on rational lines.
Nature conservation, no longer the
business of a handful of devoted
naturalists, is thus entering a dynamic
phase. This renewed vigour and the
research programmes being set up on
an unprecedented scale are a sure
guarantee that our natural capital will
be safeguarded.
Though the present situation is
serious, mankind possesses the means
of solving these vital problems. In
this effort it is up to each of us to
engage his heart as well as his mind.

MAN AGAINST
NATURE
by Frank Fraser Darling
The havoc wrought by modern man and civilization against nature is
graphically described in the four articles that follow, based on a study by
Prof. F. Fraser Darling, with comments and additions by Vladimir Sokolov,
of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences; Dr. François Bourlîère (France),
president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources; Frederick Smith, professor of zoology, University
of Michigan (U.S.A.); and specialists from Unesco and FAO. This
far-reaching study was one of the important papers submitted to the
Unesco "Man and the Biosphere" conference last autumn.

HE world as it existed
before man used tools and fire was
one of immense riches of natural
resources, organic and inorganic. But
FRANK FRASER DARLING, of Great Britain,
and specialist on animal ecology, is vice-
president of the International Union for Con¬
servation of Nature and Natural Resources,
and vice-president of the Washington Conser¬
vation Foundation. Professor Fraser Darling
has written widely, and among his most
Important publications are: 'Pelican in the
Wilderness; a Naturalist's Odyssey in North
America" (Random House, New York, 1956),
"A Herd of Red Deer; a Study in Animal
Behavior' (Doubleday, London, New York, In
co-operation with the American Museum of
Natural History, 1964), "Wild Life in an

sity Press, London, 1960), 'Man and Nature

to say that is to put the cart before
the horse; natural resources were
not resources at all until man was both
present and able to make use of them.
For a long time man may not have
been much else than the equivalent
of an indigenous animal of limited
change-producing activity, but even at
the advent of that great thrust, the
Neolithic Revolution, hunting and food-
gathering man had changed parts of
his world more or less unintentionally
by the use of fire.
Men were so few and the world
apparently so large that it would have
been strange had man dwelt philo¬
sophically on his own numbers and
the fate of natural riches. The student
of the human condition, albeit he may
hold to the philosophy of conservation,
accepts the loss of much natural
wealth as the price of civilization.
When was the moment critical that
man should have arrived at conscious¬
ness of that fuller kind that would have
led him to call a halt to bald exploit¬
ation, and to match exploitation with
rehabilitation? It is possible we have
reached that moment now, though
overall the planet is still losing out.
The fear now is whether we can
rehabilitate, or are causes and conse¬
quences setting up their own per¬
cussive oscillations to an extent we
cannot control?
It is worthwhile attempting some
classification of man's impact on the
biosphere. This impact is not to be
thought of as being wholly to the
detriment of- man's ultimate welfare
though it may be preponderantly so.
Certain man-modified habitats may

represent ecosystems of equal or
greater production and wealth-building
power than the natural condition.
Fire has been used for animal hunt¬
ing, destroying forest incidentally and
preventing much regeneration. But
production of savannas as in parts of
Africa with a rich spectrum of ungulate
species (hoofed animals), may lead to
a rich habitat for organic production.
However, savannas of Brazil and
Guiana seem definitely to lose out as
to their qualitative potential. Is this
because of a limited array of ungulates
as compared with Africa? Again, in
North America, the Indians extended
the prairie rangé of bison by burning
forest and the resulting humid prairies
were an immense store of rich soil.
Sometimes the terrain is also burned
intentionally to produce fresh young
grass; this leads to impoverishment of
the array of plants present originally,
which upsets flexibility of the grazing
complex in face of seasonal climatic
variation. Examples are production of
stretches of grassland in the Scottish
Highlands; and the gradual elimination
of grass, giving way to gall acacia and
lantana bush in parts of Africa, and
mesquite in North America's south¬
west.
Settled cultivation, in opposition to
shifting cultivation, leads to soil
exhaustion if replenishment is not
understood or is impossible, or
possible aridity if active counterworks
are not used. The English "breks" or
broken lands are thought to have
developed from Neolithic cultivation.
The "Dust Bowl" of the United States
in the 1930s showed what continuous
extractive cultivation without adequate
replenishment could do when a cycle
of drought years was encountered.
Broadly, cultivation must manage to
sustain the level of organic matter,
or the soil either bakes or blows away.
But many examples can be given
where settled agriculture, under various
ecological conditions, had been suc¬
cessfully carried out for centuries,
namely in the Far East, the Near East,
the Mediterranean area and Central
America. The ancient Negev demon¬
strated efficacy of counterworks for
conservation of water; abandonment
of these resulted in almost complete
degradation of the habitat.
Conservation-minded people, as a /Q
whole, tend to have an absolute anti¬
pathy towards shifting cultivation as
being wholly deleterious to habitat.

Instances could be given of this prac¬
tice, however, that produce variety
and valuable "edge-effects" so long
as the human population is low.
The chitemene system in Central
Africa is a good example: the gardens
are not larger than an acre or so and
being surrounded by bush on fairly
level terrain soon return to bush after
3 to 5 years of use, and are not used
for a further forty years. Immediately
after being relinquished these gardens
are taken over by colonies of Tatera
rats while the soil is loose and friable.
The rats, caught by small boys, form
a secondary protein crop for a year or
two. Following this, the bush slowly
recovers and replenishes the soil.
Shifting cultivation is the bane of
central and northern South America
and land hunger, with rapidly increas¬
ing human population, creates a vicious
circle from which it is difficult to break.
Erosion is having long-term effects on
far greater areas of country through
interference with the water relations.
Irrigation has a long history and is
still a popular line of development, but
in large-scale irrigation projects, im¬
provement or maintenance of soil
fertility over a long period raises many
problems. As they are so often sited
in arid areas where a high evaporation
rate has kept salts in the soil, irrig¬
ation tends to redissolve the salts and
deposit them again as a crystal crust.
Re-use of irrigation water from sources
such as the Colorado River can
mean good ground being made saline
and useless at the lower levels of
operation. This also happens on the
Bear River, Utah, and on the great
Sind scheme in Pakistan.
Wise irrigation, or possibly fortunate
irrigation, uses rainwater, and if this
is adequate in supply, it can wash the
more saline ground of the arid parts
where the water is used. The Gesira
scheme in the Sudan is an excellent
example. The country's economy has
been much strengthened by non-saline
water from the Blue Nile (which runs
at a higher level than the White Nile)
which is taken off and spread over the
triangle of the Gesira. The used water
drains into the White Nile on the lower
side of the triangle, the volume of
which renders insignificant any salin-
ization suffered by the Blue Nile water
passing across the Gezira.
aINCE domestication has
occurred sedentarization limits move¬
ments of stock which often leads to
over-grazing. Different species of
domestic stock cunningly used in dif¬
ferent climatic conditions make for
maintenance of habitat, but well-under¬
stood balances can be easily upset by
natural fluctuations of conditions.
The technique of successful graz¬
ing has to be learned and even when
learned may not be generally followed.
Even the sophistication of a modern
research station can fall short, as in
the case of the reindeer era in Alaska,
where deterioration outpaced research.
As a result, grazing land deter¬
iorated and reindeer herds diminish¬
ed. Modern examples of extractive
grazing, as in European Africa, parts
of Australia and New Zealand, and the
shortgrass prairies of North America,
have caused rapid soil deterioration.
Nomadism of pastoral origin de¬
serves special mention because it can
be so easily upset or broken, to the
detriment of the habitat. Nomadism
is . at best a pursuit of the steppe
regions of the world and produces
least deterioration. It is utterly bound
up with movement if habitat is to be
conserved. Any undue lingering
punishes the vegetational complex,
reduces its numbers of species and
therefore impoverishes it.
The finest nomadic areas of the
world were the chernozem plains, like
those of the Kuban where the Scy¬
thians roamed in the time of Hero¬
dotus (see page 2). Nomads depend¬
ed on animal products for sustenance
and warmth, and as protein consumers
were an ecological élite, at the top
of the food chain or pyramid.
The chernozem soils of America and
Europe have stood up well to the
extractive agricultural methods impos¬
ed upon them, and it is likely that
good farming methods will maintain
them in the future. But a revolution
of the plough of this kind always goes
farther than those lands best able to
bear it. Higher, poorer and more arid
steppes have been "dry farmed" with
disastrous results.
Wherever sedentary populations
have impinged on nomad grazing there
has been degradation of habitat for
which the nomads are invariably blam¬
ed. Yet nomadism as a careful pastor¬
al process is the least traumatic
of human influences and as a form of
husbandry utilizes areas which could
not be utilized by man in any other
way. It is essentially ecological in
structure, relying on movement and

The Repetek Desert Afforestation Centre uses the large

grown through the mat, the trees will anchor the sand.
The Masai, pastoral nomads of East Africa, are an
outstanding example of a people who have learned to
adapt their way of life to the environment, by co-operating
with nature instead of despoiling it. With the introduction
of Western veterinary techniques, however, grazing lands
are now overstocked, and nature's delicate balance is
threatened. Below, a Masai shepherd tends his flock of

seasonal use, a wide spectrum of
grazing animals adapted to well-un¬
derstood differences in habitat and
producing much energy without loss of
organic matter.
Nomadism is always brittle: appar¬
ently small changes reduce it to habi¬
tat spoliation. The Masai in East
Africa are a Nilotic tribe moved from
a humid homeland into high, dry step¬
pe country. Yet their knowledge was
good and accurate and they did not
deteriorate their habitat until the white
man brought veterinary magic which
prevented the full incidence of mortal¬
ity which formerly kept the herds to
a proper level for the stock-carrying
capacity of the ground.
The Masai and their country are a
good example of integration of nomad¬
ism with the indigenous animal popu¬
lation. Wild game existed alongside
domestic herds, tolerated and respect¬
ed. In the Bahr-el-Ghazal, the Dinka
accept giraffes as part of the herd.
Even in this paradise of symbiotic
cattle culture, the march of modernity
and the hungry mouths elsewhere are
demanding rice culture.
History records a striking example
of nomadism having become allied
with political power and made so
powerful by law that a whole country
was devastated. This is what happen¬
ed with the society of the Meseta in
Spain. Ferdinand and Isabella allied
themselves with it for the profit of the
crown. The flocks of Merino sheep
were driven through cultivated areas
and it even became illegal to fence
against them. It took the folk of Spain
nearly 200 years to beat the Meseta,
but the bare hills of Spain remain today.

Man against Nature - 2
THE DEAD LAND
OF THE WITHERED TREES
D,lEFORESTATION has taken
place from earliest times and is prob¬
ably better documented than most
other types of change of habitat. The
earliest effect of restricted deforesta¬
tion is one of enrichment of the habitat
by providing change in a situation of
little or no change. Parkland in forest
is appreciated by many species of
grazing animals.
Primitive and later man, utterly sur¬
rounded by forest, arrives at a psy¬
chological state eventually when he
must push back the forest and not be
enfolded.
The Anglo-Saxon colonizing a Brit
ain which had islands of ploughland
and pasture connected by roads in a
sea of forest was not only knowled¬
geable in tools and woodwork, but
clever ecologically. To create new
arable ground in the long term he
used a biological plough or grubber
in the oak and beech forest in the
shape of the snouts of herds of
swine, descendants of the European
wild boar. The beasts garnered the
acorns and beech nuts, and by
concentration of effort prevented
regeneration.
As actual tree felling took place,
grass followed on the "cultivation" by
the pigs; grass parklands or lawns
were created, to be ploughed as need¬
ed. In temperate, humid England, the
changed biological system of forest to
grassland with occasional trees made
for little loss of organic matter and the
output of free energy was probably not
far behind that of the forest. Cer¬
tainly it allowed more of it to be
used for producing man's food.
The fact that the export of natural
resources tends to open the way to
devastation has been documented
many times. The oak forests of Eng¬
land did not all fall to the axes
of the early Anglo-Saxons. The rise

of England as a naval power involved
heavy felling, and the use of iron de¬
manded more felling for smelting fuel.
The opening of the 17th century
saw prohibitions on the felling of Eng¬
lish timber. This drove the iron
smelters to the woods of western
Scotland where the long sea lochs
allowed ships laden with iron ore to
penetrate deep into the forests of
Scots pine and to have access to the
oaks down in the glens.
Here devastation came quickly be¬
cause of the high rainfall, acid soils
and steep slopes. The Forestry Com¬
mission of the present day is concern¬
ed with the repair of this damage, but
at great cost because the active humus
has long gone from the once-timber¬
ed slopes.
Perhaps the onslaught on North
American forests was the main reason
for the rise of conservation thinking.
Fairfield Osborn said in 1948 of the
United States, "The story of our nation
in the last century as regards the use
of forests, grasslands, wildlife and
water sources is the most violent and
destructive of any written in the long
history of civilization. The velocity of
events is unparalleled..."
This fact of weight and speed of
destruction may find its absolution in
the rise of the ideal and practice of
conservation in the United States. Si¬
milarly in Africa, there has grown an
awareness of the need to conserve,
often as a result of destruction and
denudation.
On a happier note, the African Spec¬
ial Project carried out jointly by the
International Union for Conservation
of Nature and Natural Resources and
FAO, may well have been the turning
point in attitudes towards conserva¬
tion in the rest of Africa. No less
important was the international confer¬
ence held in Arusha, Tanganyika in
1961, on the need for conservation in
tropical Africa.
The felling of tropical forests has
been a story of sheer extraction. The
massive and impressive accumulation
of organic matter presented by this
oldest life form on the planet tends
to blind us to its fragility.. Like most
forest forms, the tropical is primarily
a photosynthetic factory of cellulose,
with any protein as very secondary
production.
The tropical forest floor has been
protected from the sun for thousands
of years with the niches for decay and
conversion so well filled that nutrition

A single crumb of soil is a teeming
invisible community of infinitely
tiny creatures bacteria, protozoa,
microscopic worms and mites
on whose health, to some extent,
man depends for the successful raising
of crops. This photo of a soil

and invertebrates but not always in
a form acceptable to the human being
as food. Drainage has been done
throughout history in various parts of
the world to create navigable channels
and to provide more agricultural land
or, perhaps, specially fertile agricultur¬
al land. Holland and the Fen country
of England are good examples, as
also are many areas in the U.S.A.
Where the soil is alkaline peat it
becomes highly fertile when dry
enough to manage, but so contracts
in volume that diking and pumping
become necessary, for the won land
is then below the level of the adjoining
sea. The situation is vulnerable and
soil is friable and tends to blow away.
The question must always be
whether the considerable capital
works necessary can be maintained
and whether the potential fertility of
wetland soils can pay for them.
Once more the ecosystem is being
changed from one of protein produc¬
tion to one of largely carbohydrate
grain production. Certainly more
mouths can be fed on the "devaluated"
product. The aesthetic loss of beau¬
tiful species, especially birds, from
drainage in wetlands is considerable.
The United States has changed its
former policy to some extent by
allowing wetlands to refill and resume
their former land form, for example the
Klamath Marshes in northern Califor¬
nia. It might be said here that allowing
marshes to refill is only possible as a
policy in a country affluent enough to
be producing grain surpluses and
where the proteinous wildlife is
beginning to have extrinsic values
for recreation.
The Everglades National Park in
Florida provides a perfect instance of
the complexity of wetland habitats and
what can happen when water is deflect¬
ed from these areas.
The Everglades constitutes a large
national park, but is a vivid example
of several thousand square miles
being insufficient to be an ecologically
independent area. Nothing is simple
when playing with water on wetlands.
General reserve on changing the
nature of wetlands is not yet apparent.
There is a psychological fascination
about playing with water and to change
a protein-producing system to a car¬
bohydrate-producing one seems to
provide ample practical reason for
going ahead.
Africa has many interior wetlands
and one of the most promising lines of
development in recent years has been
improved management and enlarged
use of the fish resources of these
wetlands. Zambia is an excellent
example of achievement of an improved
standard of nutrition for a new in¬
dustrial population from the freshwater
fisheries of the numerous swamps.
Yet the projected increase in human
population has caused serious con¬
sideration of draining such areas as
the Kafue and Chambeshi Flats to
serve as wheat-growing lands. Not
only would fishing be constricted as a
result, but the herds of game animals
would go also, despite the fact that
the red lechwe, an antelope moving
in large herds, is adapted to grazing
inundated lands and potentially capa¬
ble of management as a meat-
producing animal.
I
HE history of over-hunting
selected desirable species is well
known, and concerns us here in so far
as the disappearance or decrease in
numbers of species has altered the
ecosystem and the habitat. We do
not know very much about this; our
knowledge of niche ("microhabitat")
function is growing but we have much
to learn about habitats from which a
niche occupant has been removed.
The elephant would provide a good
comparative study because we have
plenty of habitats from which it has
recently been removed by over-hunting
and others in which it is more
numerous than ever because of pro¬
tection. We have a fair notion of what
is happening In the latter situation
production of grassland and removal
of bush with the tsetse fly being
pushed back. The elephant is the
agent of change, but man's distortion
of the elephant's way of life is the
instigator of change.
Not enough thinking has been done
about the influence of reduction of
plains game on African savanna. The
bison on North American prairies was
followed by the plough, so we know
little of the change which actual
reduction would have caused, except
that on the fringes of prairie there is a
coincident rise of even-age forest.
The wolf is perhaps the best example
of the intentional extincting or eradic¬
ation of animal species because of its
direct challenge to extended pastor-
alism. The supposed behaviour of the.
wolf has become a human psycholo¬
gical fiction which can still influence
the fate of habitats.
In the recent past, bounties were still
given on wolves killed in the Arctic

### 57264: The Dead land of the withered trees
where human prédation of the caribou
was quite insufficient to prune the cari¬
bou population to safeguard the range
which, if over-grazed, might take a
century to recover longer than cari¬
bou could wait.
There were excellent object lessons
in the reduced reindeer populations on
the west coast of North America
after thirty years of over-grazing of
the ranges," but the psychological
obsession about wolves had blinded
people to the plain cause. These over¬
grazed ranges can still be seen as
different from the surrounding terrain
when viewed from an airplane at
20,000 feet.
How far the lack of the predator was
responsible, or how far the sheer
lowering of numbers of deer was the
cause of the Kaibab plateau crash of
mule deer in 1916 will probably never
be known, but the fact of an absence
of predators was immediately under¬
stood.
What interests us most is the per¬
cussive influence on habitat caused by
violent fluctuations due to the man-
caused absence of predator popul¬
ations which not only lower the
numbers of the herds on which they
prey, but also keep them moving.
Recent work on the moose-wolf ratio
and equilibrium on Isle Royale in Lake
Superior shows how a woodland habi¬
tat carrying these large deer can be
maintained by man allowing the wolf
to do all the necessary culling.
Mineral exploitation and industrial
processing are other factors to be
considered. Smelting liberates toxic
fumes which kill plants and sometimes
animals. The sterilization of areas by
copper smelting in Tennessee is well
known. Aluminium smelting at the foot
of the Great Glen of Scotland produc¬
ed fluoride fumes which were blown
north-eastwards up the glen by the
prevailing south-west winds. The graz-
ings were affected and young cattle
suffered. It took a court case and
very dilatory action thereafter before
scrubbers were installed to remove
the hazard.
The lead mines of Derbyshire and
the felspar workings left areas of spoil
on which the herbage which grew
thereafter was so far impregnated with
lead that young stock could not be
grazed on them. This effect remains in
the ground even centuries after the
mining.
Coal and shale mining not only create
conditions where subsidence occurs,
but large quantities of detritus are
produced which are in general dumped
on the surface near the mine shaft.
These vast dumps not only make the
landscape an unhappy one aesthetic¬
ally, but serious interference with

surface drainage is often apparent in
their vicinity. At worst, these dumps
are a menace to human communities,
as was experienced so tragically at
Aberfan in Wales. We are slowly
emerging into a world of different
values in which space is seen to be
getting short and derelict landscapes
cannot be allowed to impinge on such
a scarce commodity.
The recent marriage of ecology and
landscape architecture has immense
promise. The English counties of Dur¬
ham and Northumberland have initiated
schemes of vegetating pit heaps, with
a success that promises to enrich and
make beautiful the violated landscape.
The National Coal Board of Britain
has done much opencast mining in the
North of England, and immense care is
being taken to rehabilitate the land¬
scape afterwards, to the extent of 11
per cent of the Board's income. Similar
results can be found in Germany.
The strip mining and auger mining of
the hills of Kentucky are leaving eye¬
sores of dereliction along the faces of
the hills, and the effects of watershed
erosion which follow are having serious
repercussions below these hills on the
good soils of the Ohio River country.
It is all the more distressing to hear
that the coal is being mined for sale
at the lowest possible price to that
model of rehabilitation policy, the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
One of our difficulties in much con¬
servation endeavour is to stop differ¬
ent agencies within one nation work¬
ing to each other's disadvantage, never
mind between nations. Once more we
lack good legislation: the process of
law being so largely by precedent, it
can scarcely keep abreast of the types
of change quite unimagined in the past.

MILLIONS OF CORMORANTS live unmolested on the

Callao, Peru's busiest port. The guano, or droppings,
of these birds, which have sometimes accumulated
to depths of as much as 150 feet, are one of Peru's
most valuable resources. Guano (annual production
now 300,000 tons) was long ago used by ancient Indian
civilizations to fertilize the irrigated lands of Peru's
coastal desert. For the past 50 years, the
guano-producing islands have been rigorously
protected by the Peruvian Government which has
also cut off several peninsulas from the mainland to
create ten new islands where the birds can breed in
safety. Mass fishing of anchovies the basic food of

PROBLEM

The dead pike (left) symbolize the
destructive effects of pollution in
our rivers, lakes and waterways
today. Throughout the world, water
pollution is bringing untold havoc
to fish and plant life, as well as
ruining these areas for swimming
and other recreational activities.
At the turn of the century,
50 species of fish could be found
in the lower reaches of the river
Seine. Today, only a few diseased
eels survive. It has been estimated
that the pollutants in French rivers
and lakes would fill 10,000 trains,
carrying 6,000,000 tons. Thousands
of lakes in Finland are now totally
polluted. Lake Zurich In
Switzerland is biologically dead:
pollution has exterminated all its
fish and other forms of life.

OLLUTION is the greatest
problem of our age. No longer can
we think of England's industrial north,
Germany's Ruhr, the U.S.S.R.'s Don¬
bass mining area, and a few other
places, as being the polluted areas
where money is to be made, but places
not to be lived in if possible.
In the last quarter of a century we
have polluted the whole planet so that
the fat-storing creatures of the remote
Antarctic continent, penguins and
seals, carry appreciable quantities of
organo-chlorine compounds in their fat,
the compounds we commonly allude to
as pesticides and which have not been
used within many hundreds of miles of
any part of the Antarctic continent.
We have learned now of the virtual
cessation of reproduction in some
species of birds which have not been
the objects of any hard feelings, only
of love and pleasure. We carry these
pollutants in the fat of our own bodies
and as yet do not know of any effects
on us, good or bad, but most thinking
people are concerned about the pos¬
sible effect of accumulations of these
compounds over the years.
Some developed countries have
regulated the use of pesticides and cut
down dosages, but this has meant the
economic dumping of large quantities
in tropical countries where there are
pests enough and little control over
the use of pesticides. The informed
among us know that to regulate use in
some countries but not on a world¬
wide basis does not prevent pollution
of the biosphere. We are world citi¬
zens willy-nilly now.
Dumpipg of wastes into rivers is an
obvious and well-documentated way
in which we are bringing about change
in the biosphere. The trouble arises
from the primitive notion that a river
is a natural sewer. Paper-making is
a modern industry in terms of cent
uries which has been responsible
for fouling many rivers of the forest
countries. The U.S. State of Maine
has a relatively low human population,
but its rivers are polluted to an extent
that precludes most of them receiving
a run of salmon. Where human popul¬
ation is dense, sewage is the main
problem.
Knowledge is being gained all the
time of how to deal with industrial
wastes, but regulation lags. Recent
production of pesticides has had a few
tragic sequels in the poisoning of
rivers and ditches. In comparison, the
carelessness of shepherds in draining
out baths of sheep dip is a small thing,
perhaps, but indicative of the thought¬
lessness that spreads man's deleter¬
ious influences over habitats beyond
the immediate vicinity. There has not
been sufficient realization that much
marine productivity on the continental
shelf has an estuarine basis.
Much could also be said on radio¬
activity. In the recent past, the radio¬
active level has been increased in air,
soil, water and living organisms over
large areas of the world. Experimental
atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions
and some other works with radionu¬
clides represent one of the greatest
dangers for all living organisms on
earth.
What might be the planetary profit
and loss account in relation to expen¬
diture and production of oxygen? We
believe our atmospheric figure of 20
per cent oxygen has been built up
through evolutionary time by the photo-
synthetic power of plant life, and the
slow deposition of organic matter in the
deep ocean sediments. So we may
ask, when we hear that a jet plane
crossing the Atlantic burns 35 tons of
oxygen, is industrial process and com¬
bustion dipping seriously into the mar¬
gin of production over consumption,

THE NUMBER 1 PROBLEM (Continued)
especially when we think of the rate
of destruction of forest growth and
other plant life.
Oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production are to some extent
linked; we know that the carbon
dioxide content of the atmosphere is
rising and that this could lead event¬
ually to such raisings of temperature
of atmosphere and oceans that there
could be a substantial ice melt which
would appreciably raise the level of the
oceans. Pollution, , combustion and
destruction are combined here in their
ultimate power of bringing change to
the biosphere.
The deposition of sewage into rivers
is of course age old. Lakes receive
this effluent, and eutrophic conditions
are being reported from as far apart
as Lake Erie and Lake Baikal. Life in
some lakes is being asphyxiated by
lack of oxygen and too great a deposi¬
tion of organic matter. Our river banks
and lake sides are becoming over-
populated.
In order to be able to live at high
densities we must process all sewage
and wastes. We are definitely trying
to mend our ways but not fast enough.
London's River Thames is improving
by civic action, and we must thank the
sport of trout fishing for saving from
pollution many streams that feed the
Thames and other rivers in England.

taking the dangers of oil transportation
by sea as a major task of research.
Half the world's ocean cargo weight is

3,218 tankers.
Separators of improved design at
ports, plastic booms round oil har¬
bours, flocculants for spillage at sea,
jelling agents to solidify oil in threat¬
ened tankers and new methods of
loading and ballasting giant tankers,
show a willingness on the part of the
oil firms that we would be glad to see
more commonly in shore-based indust¬
ries that are potential pollutors of the
environment.
Smoke, smog, sewage and deter¬
gents, these are the pollutants pro¬
duced by modern man. We might also
add noise. It is one more addition to
bad environment engendering psycho¬
somatic disease, that hidden fifth col¬
umn in the sum total of our spoliation
of our world. How long will it be be¬
fore the individual has amenity rights,
and the burden is laid on those
offending?
ON THE WAY
TO A GLOBAL DUMP
More than 200 million automobiles now use
the world's roads. In cities, they
dangerously pollute the air we breathe.
Travelling 1,000 kilometres (600 miles), a
car consumes as much oxygen as a human
being does in a year, and in addition to
lethal carbon monoxide, it emits annually
about one kilogramme of lead. Certain
countries now oblige motorists to install
filters that reduce the amount of toxic
gases given off. Another problem created
by the proliferation of motor vehicles is
how to dispose of wrecked and worn-out
hulks. Increasingly they pile up (below) in
hideous "cemeteries" which blight the
countryside. The situation is so serious
that certain countries have built huge
scrap-metal plants that grind up old cars.
Even the deserts do not escape the
pollution of nature by man. Above, a
dump of petrol cans deep in the Sahara.

### 57910: Water pollution and the law
WATER POLLUTION AND THE LAW
A.ILMOST every country in
the world has tried to meet the threats
of water pollution by means of legis¬
lative action. But passing laws does
not automatically bring the situation
under control. Unless legislation is
supported by a strong climate of public
opinion and unless adequate funds
and staff to enforce the regulations are
provided, the results are usually disap¬
pointing.
Because of the importance of legis¬
lative measures, both national and
international, increasing attention has
been directed toward this feature of
pollution abatement, in recent years,
the International Water Supply Assoc¬
iation has devoted much time to the
legal aspects of this problem. Simi¬
larly, the International Law Associa¬
tion, the International Association of
Legal Science and the International
Institute of Administrative Sciences
have taken up these questions.
Where watercourses have formed
the boundaries of, or crossed states,
agreements, conventions and treaties
have been entered into. Significant
examples are those between Belgium
and France, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia,
and Switzerland and Italy.
Experience in the joint international
management of watercourses is of
long standing and is sometimes effec¬
tive. But more often there have been
delays in taking action to maintain an
agreed quality of water acceptable to
all countries concerned. Among other
examples, this has occurred in the
case of international arrangements on
the Rhine and Lake Constance in Eur¬
ope, on the Great Lakes in North
America, and on the Rio Grande in
Central America.
Wherever population density is high
and hence pollution abatement calls
for constant vigilance, continuing
efforts will no doubt be made to estab¬
lish at least common criteria and stand¬
ards of water purity, and increasing
discussions are likely to take place on
the best ways of preserving the purity
of waters.
The history of national legislation
abounds with examples of declarations
of good intention and high aspiration,
but nowhere are these matched by
equally high standards of implementa
tion. Abatement of pollution has not
been at a standstill. On the contrary,
a great deal has been done, but not
enough and not fast enough.
The situation was summed up suc¬
cinctly a few years ago by a World
Health Organization expert committee
which declared: "Countries with severe
laws against pollution have not in fact
avoided the occurrence of widespread
pollution. One reason for this may be
that laws calling for no pollution at all
do not represent a practical policy and
therefore fail into disrepute. In a
world becoming rapidly urbanized and
industrialized, it is not possible to pre¬
serve rivers in their natural condition.
The law should aim at controlling pollu¬
tion."
In spite of such clear definitions of
the situation, countries, large and
small, under the lash of perfectionists
and opportunists, continue to pass acts
designed to recapture the pristine
purity of past eras. The record of such
legislation is far from gratifying as is __
pointed out by two important analyt- x7
ical studies published by the World *"
Health Organization.

BLUEPRINT FOR
PLANETARY MANAGEMENT
IHE very rapid advances
that characterize developing nations
today have produced dramatic new
kinds of interactions with the environ¬
ment that were not so evident in earlier
history.
Nowhere is the problem of accel¬
erated development and its devastat¬
ing consequences more evident than
in many regions of the tropics and sub-
tropics, where two-thirds of humanity
now live. Here the relations between
man and his environment are changing
so rapidly that well-balanced develop¬
ment is seriously endangered and, in
extreme cases, entire populations may
be threatened with extinction as some
actual examples reveal.
Owing to the rapid development of
ever greater land areas and the wide¬
spread use of powerful technological
methods, the various tropical biotic

radical and extensive changes. De¬
forestation, irrigation, the introduction
of exotic plants and animals, the large-
scale use of weed-killers, the eradic¬
ation of certain pathogenic agencies,
etc., have transformed the tropical
landscape more profoundly in ten years
than the traditional agricultural and
stock-raising methods in ten centuries.
In addition to economic advantages,
immediate and undeniable, this "re¬
ordering" of the tropical ecosystems
has sometimes entailed a sudden col¬
lapse of the balances, generally going
back thousands of years, between Man
and his environment and given rise to
unexpected difficulties.
The introduction of livestock into the
savannas of tropical America has pro¬
moted the increase of rabies-trans¬
mitting haematophagous vampires. Ir¬
rigation of the savannas of the Sahel
in Africa has entailed the spread of
bilharziosis. Systematic deforestation
has frequently brought about trans¬
mission to men and domestic animals
of certain arboreal viruses, normally
confined to the pathogenic cycle of
the forest canopy. Some are capable
of causing sickness of little gravity to
monkeys and tree-dwelling rodents, but
they can be much more dangerous to
humans; yellow fever, dengue-fever,
Kyasanur forest disease, etc.
The abandonment of certain tradi¬
tional foods, both animal and vege¬
table, or their replacement by other
kinds of food more easily produced
has often served to aggravate already
existing nutritional deficiencies. Even
eradication of a number of tropical dis¬
eases may cause long-term difficulties.

America, the last twenty years have

resulted in the creation of a súb-
proletariat in poor physical condition,
which deprives agriculture of a source
of manpower but, at the same time, is
unable to offer skilled labour to in¬
dustry. As regards public health, sani¬
tary conditions in these shantytowns
represent a constant menace to the
great urban centres of which they are
a part.
The lure of new cities and industrial
centres involves unprecedented popul¬
ation movements which are the cause
of a demographic imbalance that is in
every way detrimental to the develop¬
ment of many tropical countries. These
migrations are, moreover, frequently
selective: they tend to leave the less
enterprising groups or individuals be¬
hind in the rural areas and to condemn
the majority of the better elements to
chronic unemployment. Populations
biologically well adapted to a special
environment (the high plateaux of the
Andes, for instance), sometimes find
themselves moved by these migrations
into areas climatically unsuited to
them.
These problems and there are many
of this kind require urgent study by
teams of specialists, including ecolo-
gists, medical experts, psycho-socio¬
logists and economists, with a view
to finding satisfactory solutions as
quickly as possible. Tropical ecosys¬
tems are at once so numerous, com¬
plex and delicate that nothing could
be more detrimental to the interests
of the human beings who inhabit them
than a pure and simple "transplanta¬
tion" to the tropics of techniques (and
sometimes even of ideas) which have
proved their effectiveness in the tem¬
perate latitudes.
Irrespective of past and present mis¬
takes, and of the new problems creat¬
ed by accelerated development due to
demographic, economic and social
growth, man has already in the past
tried to solve these problems of habitat
deteriorations; and new ways of think¬
ing and changing technologies give
him the desire and the possibilities
to build or rebuild an environment
which has the quality required for
mental health as well as to provide
the necessary goods and services.
Some examples are given below:
Enjoyment of nature as the hand of
man has arranged it, by people at
many levels of society is now a well-
established fact. There are the great
villas of the past, their gardens and
the manipulation of water for aesthetic
pleasure. We can think of China,
Rome, Persia and Renaissance Italy,
the architectural gardens of France
and the English ¡ardin intime. The
parks of Capability Brown, in England,
could not be enjoyed by his patrons
as we can enjoy them now with the
trees at their maturity. Gardening is
becoming enormously popular and
municipal authorities are gaining con¬
fidence In spending money on their
public parks. Increased affluence
creates a demand for environmental
amenity.
National parks are a major contrib¬
ution to civilization from conservation-
minded people who had a vision of
future human aspirations.
The best results of conservancy and
the study of wild nature have been
achieved through the establishment of
reserves and national parks with a
staff of scientists working permanent¬
ly in them.

PLANETARY MANAGEMENT (Continued)

Establishment of wilderness areas
and natural areas are prompted by
both spiritual and aesthetic concern
and biological need. There is a widely
diffused element of human feeling that
wishes there to be wildernesses. Even
if many individuals never reach the
wilderness, there is satisfaction and
comfort in the knowledge that it
exists. Biologically we need the natur¬
al areas as reservoirs; their study can
provide datum lines from which we
can more intelligently study other
environments.
Conservation agriculture can also
help us to preserve our environment.
Some tribes of people in limited or
constricted habitats have arrived at
conservation practices empirically, but
the science of conservation in farming
and water relations, together with for¬
estry, has come from change of heart
after orgies of exploitation.
One would say guardedly that con¬
servation agriculture was fairly firmly
established in developed countries, but
these same developed countries have
made some shocking mistakes in under¬
developed countries . This now could
be arrested if the necessary prelimin¬
ary studies concerning sites' poten¬
tialities and limitations and the neces¬
sary investments for conservation are
made. We have the tools and we
must use them correctly.
Outdoor sports in many forms in
developed countries lead to care of the
environment. Care of rivers has been
mentioned already in the Interests of
fishing;' a diversified agriculture and
the maintenance of strategic wood¬
lands and covers has been followed
in western countries in the interests
of sport.
Sometimes sport has removed ani¬
mals from large areas, but understand¬
ing of the ecological place of predators
is bringing about much greater toler¬
ance. All in all, farms run by those
who like to keep the sporting interest
are richer in a variety of plant and
animal life than others. Sometimes, the
sporting farmer progresses to the state
of being a definite naturalist enjoying
specifically the natural life of no sport¬
ing interest.
Changes in industry have also play¬
ed their part. This can best be
presented by examples. In the United
States, agriculture moved from the
eastern seaboard to the Middle West.
The forests that had never relinquish¬
ed their hold took over again. Even
60 years ago much wood was being
cut for fuel in these eastern forests.
Now, oil-fired central heating is fairly
general and the woods have grown
more beautiful. What is more, the
eastern woods have reached a new
high destiny, of being the Suburban
Forest, the Pleasance of the urban
communities of the seaboard. Pub¬
lic opinion is now solidly behind main¬
tenance of this pleasing region of the
East.
Likewise, in Europe, the concentra¬
tion of agriculture on the best soils and
the consequent abandonment of mar¬
ginal lands, have opened the way for
rural area development based on
afforestation for soil conservation,
forest management for timber produc¬
tion and recreation, establishment of
national parks, and, generally speak¬
ing, conservation, recreation and
extensive management of natural
resources.
In conclusion, do all these examples
give us reason to be optimistic?
Ecologists can scarcely afford to be
optimists. But an absolute pessimist
is a defeatist, and that is no good
either. We see there need not be
complete disaster and if our eyes were
open wide enough, world wide, we
could do much towards rehabilitation.
The biggest danger of all is our in¬
ability to control the explosive rate of
growth of human population. A real
damping down of this would lessen
the all too frequent policy of exped¬
iency, bolstered by technology divorc¬
ed from the philosophy of science.
The scientist as a social entity must
eventually establish the necessity for
the ecosystem approach to world prob¬
lems as a safeguard against unbalanced
technological action. We have yet to
realize that political guidance and re¬
straint is nothing like so operative on
technology as on other major fields
of human action.

u,INESCO has now embarked
on its programme in education,
science, culture and communication for
1969-70. The programme, approved by
Unesco's General Conference in Nov¬
ember 1968, together with a two-year
budget of $77.5 million, confirms the
priorities hitherto accorded to educa¬
tion, the natural sciences and techno¬
logy.
Presenting the programme to the
General Conference, Mr René Maheu,
Director-General of Unesco, who was
elected to a second six-year term of
office, drew attention to what he term¬
ed the "four major crises" the
crisis in development aid, the crisis of
human rights, the world crisis in edu¬
cation and the crisis of youth.
Of the youth crisis, he said: "It
is not in fact a crisis of youth; it is a
crisis of our society... and youth... re¬
veals the strains and stresses in that
society... I believe that, just as over
the past ten years Unesco has given
special attention to the developing
countries, it must now couple this
attention with a growing concern for
youth."
In the programme now envisaged;
Unesco will work not only for youth but
with youth. In the next two years
Unesco will hold several important
meetings or conferences dealing with
problems of youth: one in Uruguay
on "Youth and Development," a sec¬
ond, on the impact on young people
and adults of violence as portrayed by
mass media, and a round table on
university reform, to be held in Latin
America.
Importance will be given to the par¬
ticipation of young people in all these
conferences as well as others not
dealing necessarily with youth prob¬
lems.
Of Unesco's 125 member states, 70
sent ministers to the conference, which
elected as its president Mr. William
A. Eteki-Mboumoua, Minister of Educa¬
tion, Arts and Letters in Cameroon,
from 1961 to 1968. Under his chair¬
manship, it debated and approved
basic guidelines for Unesco's policy
during the coming years:
Confirmation of the priorities accord¬
ed to education, natural sciences and
technology.
Substantial contribution by Unesco
to the Second Development Decade,
which depends, "not only on the ra¬
tional use of natural resources but on
making the most of human resources
by a co-ordinated process of educa¬
tion and training."

### 57267: UNESCO's programme for 1969-1970
Unesco's programme
for 1969-1970
Basic concept of the idea of life¬
long education, "embracing in indus¬
trial and developing regions alike all
levels of the education systems, al|
forms of out-of-school education and
even all policies for cultural develop¬
ment."
Recognition that the problems of
youth "are an indication of a rapidly
changing society", and the realization
that a growing awareness of these
problems must be the starting point of
general progress to benefit students
and young urban and rural workers.
Importance of the modernization of
universities in which administrators,
professors and students should all be
involved.
An urgent need "to propagate the
scientific spirit," and, at the same
time, to define national science poli¬
cies, allowing for the establishment of
the necessary structures and staff
training, "needed in the less favoured
countries, to accelerate their develop¬
ment."
Growth in the contribution social and
human sciences can make "in analyz¬
ing situations within societies and
seeking new solutions".
Strengthening awareness of a
common human destiny through mu¬
tual appreciation of cultural values and
the preservation of the heritage and
traditions of the past.
Use of modern information techni¬
ques for promoting educational activ¬
ities and the scientific spirit.
In Unesco's world programme for
the next two years, one of the pro¬
jects in education is the development
of pedagogical research, in co-opera¬
tion with the International Bureau of
Education (IBE), which is to be merg¬
ed into Unesco as an international
centre for the study of comparative
education.
This year's International Conference
on Public Education, convened by
Unesco and IBE, will be devoted to
the improvement of education systems.
In 1970, Unesco will organize a region¬
al conference, at the ministerial level,
on education and economic planning
in Arab States.
Aid programmes in educational
planning will be continued and special
attention given to problems of wastage
and drop-outs at primary and secon¬
dary levels, and to the improvement
of programmes and teaching methods.
Aid in teacher training and the up-grad
ing and re-adaptation of teachers will
be expanded, particularly for rural
areas in Africa and Latin America.
Studies on special education for handi¬
capped children are also planned for
1969-70.
Unesco's aid to literacy programmes
will be continued and intensified,
especially in the case of experimental
pilot projects.
Unesco's programme in the natural
sciences will now follow three main
lines: science policy, scientific infor¬
mation and fundamental research ;
science education and technological
training and research ; environmental
sciences and research on natural re¬
sources.
In 1970, Unesco will organize the
first European conference of ministers
concerned with science policy. In col¬
laboration with the International Coun¬
cil of Scientific Unions, Unesco will
continue its formulation of a world sys¬
tem for scientific information.
Unesco proposes to take a fresh look
at science teaching at all levels by
means of pilot projects involving new
programmes and methods and improv¬
ed teaching equipment. Other pilot
projects will see what can be done to
limit the effects of the "brain drain"
of highly qualified personnel from
developing countries. Unesco will also
continue to help train scientists, engin¬
eers and technicians in countries
where they are most needed.
Results of the first part of the
Unesco-sponsored International Hydro-
logical Decade launched in 1965, will
be studied at a conference of spec¬
ialists this year, and following the
International Conference on the Bio¬
sphere, in September 1968, an inter¬
disciplinary programme on "Man and
the Biosphere" will be mapped out (see
page 4).
While continuing its survey on the
main trends of research in the social
and human sciences and its promotion
of teaching in these fields, Unesco
will sponsor studies and hold a sympo¬
sium on the contribution the social
sciences can make to social and eco¬
nomic planning and development.
Other studies will be made on different
aspects of demography and on family
planning in relation to education.
Unesco's programme of studies of
different cultures (Oriental, African,
Latin American, Balkan, Scandinavian,
among others) in terms of their univer¬
sal significance will be continued.
Unesco will promote cultural develop
ment by encouraging the creative arts
and art education and by promoting
wider diffusion of art and literature.
As for the preservation of mankind's
cultural heritage, Unesco will organize
the first world conference of ministers
of culture next year. Other salient fea¬
tures of Unesco's cultural programme
are the adoption of an international
Recommendation for the protection of
cultural property endangered by public
or private works, studies on the prob¬
lems of Venice and the campaign to
save the monuments of Philae in Nubia
(see the "Unesco Courier", Decem¬
ber 1968).
Lastly, as regards communication
in the broadest sense of the term
Unesco's activities are two-fold. First¬
ly, it will continue to promote the
improvement of documentation ser¬
vices, nationally and internationally,
and will assist member states to deve¬
lop documentation centres, libraries,
archives and statistical services.
Secondly, it will continue to foster the
free flow of ideas by word and image,
studies abroad, book promotion and
the development of information media,
especially as these relate to education.
One of the new projects to be
launched in 1969 is a wide-ranging
study on the international travel of
persons whose occupations relate to
areas of Unesco's competence. The
survey will begin by charting and
assessing the pattern of travel of
scientists, engineers and technicians,
data being gathered on the numbers,
countries of origin and categories of
these specialists, on the types of
study and length of stay abroad and
the use made of the knowledge and
skills thus acquired.
The role of communication in
society, and the question of agree¬
ments covering the use of satellite
communications for televising educ¬
ational, scientific and cultural pro¬
grammes will be discussed at two
meetings this year.
For further facts we refer readers
to Unesco's official monthly publica¬
tion, "The Unesco Chronicle," whose
December 1968 issue is devoted to
the decisions of the 15th Session of
Unesco's General Conference. Pub¬

SEGREGATED PROGRESS
Sir,
i cannot understand why you are
opposed to apartheid. What is there
to condemn in a policy of separate
development? In a society composed
of different races at different levels
of development, each can make the
best progress in its own allotted
sphere. The best solution is racial
segregation which prevents clashes
and rivalry. Separate development
leading to the creation of Negro states
should certainly not be labelled as
colonialism or the oppression of
Negroes by whites.
G.M. Barbier

A RELIABLE SOURCE...
Sir,
In view of the anti-Western outlook
of your magazine, 1 wish to cancel
my subscription. It so happens that I
receive complimentary copies of the
"Revue de l'Afrique du Sud" (South
African Review) which keeps me better
informed on the problems of Africa.
Paul Le Reste

CAPTURING WORDS
IN FLIGHT
Sir,
Francesco Salis gave us a fasci¬
nating account of his literacy teaching
experiences in a Sardinian village, in
your April 1968 issue (Literacy Stair¬
way to Development). It showed us
how vital it Is to adapt teaching
methods to a country's living condi¬
tions and customs. In Sardinia, the
factor which speeded the progress of
literacy was shorthand. Why short¬
hand? Francesco Salis uses the phrase
"the magic of capturing words in
flight". It was this that appealed
to the Sardinians who saw in their
new skill a means "to capture in
flight" the verses recited at the
island's "Sagras" or poetry tourna¬
ments. This example shows us how
wrong it is to have preconceived
ideas about teaching people to read
and write. Teaching should take
account of a community's innermost
aspirations and tastes. Such methods
could surely be applied In numerous
other fields.

ABUSE OF DRUGS
Sir,
I warmly welcome your Drug Abuse
issue of May 1968, as it gives me
something of substance and official
standing to use with my colleagues,
who seem often so strangely reluctant
to believe in the harmful effects of
drugs LSD and marijuana in parti¬
cular. I am having several copies
sent to key persons on campus, and
will keep one or two to use with my
students abroad. Work with students
has convinced me, even without
medical research, that these drugs
can be dangerous; that drug usage
is widespread among our students
and has increased at a very rapid
rate in the last two years is also
obvious. I welcome the sense of
urgency expressed in the "Unesco
Courier".

Sir,
We were deeply interested by your
issue devoted to the dangers of drugs.
The International Council of Women
expressed its concern on this subject
at its executive meeting in London in
September 1967. Furthermore, the
ICW Standing Committee on Health
is carrying out an enquiry among the
National Councils of Women affiliated
to the ICW on "The growing use of
drugs".

OF UNIVERSAL CONCERN
Sir,
I am surprised the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" has published nothing on the
situation in Biafra. Surely, in terms
of human solidarity and civilization,
this is a subject on which world
opinion should be kept fully informed.

UNESCO CLUB IN EMBRYO
Sir,
We are a group of about ten young
people who lack neither enthusiasm
nor the will to work. Looking through
a copy of your special number on
Youth (July-August 1965), we all
agreed that your magazine does a
worthwhile job in enabling the peo¬
ples of different countries to learn
more about each other. We were
especially interested in this particular
number. It told us about the activ¬
ities of youth in many countries and
about the hundreds of Unesco clubs
which are now active in all parts of
the world. We would like to know
how such clubs are set up and what
sort of activities are Included in their
programmes. We would like to start
a Unesco club here.

ON THE RIGHT LEVEL
Sir,
You will be interested to know that
the "Unesco Courier" is shelved
conspicuously at eye level 'In the
general reference room of Detroit's
main library. That's how I happen
to be writing you: I came on it as I
browsed for publications that might
have assignments or contracts for
free-lance work.
Géraldine Mcintosh
Detroit, U.S.A.
Sir,
When I read some of the "Letters
to the Editor" I hardly know whether
to laugh or cryl Criticism is per¬
missible and indeed necessary. But
people should realize that an editor
cannot always deal with every theme
which interests certain readers.
Frankly, I think your magazine is
outstanding, the texts carefully balanc¬
ed and the illustrations excellent. The
"Unesco Courier", which is doing a
fine job, stands out head and should¬
ers above many publications.
Paul Strittmatter
Berne, Switzerland
Sir.
Your magazine is a firm favourite
with young people in Cuba. When a
new issue goes on sale, people often
queue at the news-stands, and copies
are sold out before everyone has had
one. I want to take out a subscription
so I can read the "Unesco Courier"
regularly.

PAUSE FOR THOUGHT
Sir,
I thought you would like to see,
from this photo, that some working
men of Manzanares, central Spain,
spend part of their lunch break read¬
ing the "Unesco Courier". We have,
quite a long way to go from our
homes in the city to the factory where
we work. When we stop for a rest,
we also take It in turn to read aloud
from the "Unesco Courier" and other
Unesco publications, and this often
leads to lively discussions.

How our planet looks from 90,000 kilometres (56,000 miles) away a remarkable
photograph taken by the Soviet spacecraft "Zond 5" on September 21, 1968.
After exposure, the film was not radioed back but returned to earth for development
in a laboratory, hence the exceptional clarity of the picture. Between the cloud
formations can be seen the African continent, the Arabian peninsula, the Middle
East and parts of Spain, Italy and the Balkans. On far right are the Black Sea,
the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Aral. It is midday on the Red Sea and 9 a.m. in
Spain. On far left, the Americas are still in darkness, but within minutes the sun
will rise over the north-east tip of Brazil. This issue is devoted to Man and the
Biosphere, that is. Planet Earth and man's centuries long destruction of his
environment, which now seriously threatens the balance of nature.
