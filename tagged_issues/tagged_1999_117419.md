Berlin was once an island. I move d
from Cologne to West Berlin in 1988,
when the Wall was still standing. To
reach the city you had to travel through
the German Democratic Republic (GDR),
a country that the average West Germ a n
b o rn after the war knew less about than
France,Spain or Belgium.
Reaching West Berlin was like dri v i n g
through a tunnel.The city was  already the
largest in the Federal Republic, but so ve ry
distinct from it.This melting pot of ‚Äú c o l d -
war wa rri o rs ‚Äù , ageing activists of the 1968
r e vo l t s , politically active students and disillu-
sioned artists made a somewhat archaic
impression on the outsider.The highly-sub-

BERL IN: BIRT H
A ND REBIRT H
By European standards, Berlin is a relatively young
c i ty, with its first records dating from 1234. Lo ca t e d
at the crossroads of a medieval trading route, the city
rapidly prospered and became the residence of the
p owerful Hohenzollern dynasty that reigned for over
500 years. The sprawling capital, which Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder referred to as the ‚ÄúBerlin Republic‚Äù
upon taking up office there on August 23, stretches
over 800 sq. km and is located 80 km from the Po l i s h
b o r d e r. The move of the century took place over the
summer, with the transfer of parliament, ministries
and 12,000 employees from Bonn (involving no less
than 120,000 pieces of furniture, 38,000 metres of fil e s ,
carried for the most part by rail, with special road
convoys for confidential defence files and art works).
Powerful symbols of the past remain: the fin a n c e
m i n i s t ry will move into the building from which Luft-
waffe chief Herman Goering commanded the air
war, while the Ministry of Labour will be housed in the
former headquarters of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph
G o e b b e l s .

Reclaiming its former status marks a rebirth for
Berlin, a city at the heart of the German enlighten-
ment in the 18th century when it was capital of the
kingdom of Prussia, before being proclaimed ca p i t a l
of the German Empire in 1871. During the 19 20 s ,
Berlin was one of Europe‚Äôs foremost cultural and
s c i e n t i fic centres, associated with such names as
Bertolt Brecht, Walter Gropius and Albert Einstein. But
the 19 20s were also marked by rising unemployment
and merciless inflation, facilitating Hitler‚Äôs rise to
p ow e r. In 1945, the devastated city was divided into
four zones of occupation, then partitioned into East
and West Berlin in 1949. The wall was built in August
19 61. When the city celebrated its 750th anniver-
s a ry in 19 87 on separate sides, few could have pre-
dicted that the country‚Äîand Berlin‚Äîwould be reu-
n i fied two years later. In 19 91, the Bundestag chose
Berlin as capital by a narrow 18-vote majority. The city
is now one of superlatives, with three opera houses,
160 museums and an ultra-modern cinema complex
that will be ready for the next Berlin Film Festival in
Fe b r u a ry 2000. The capital is placing hope in its
n ew status to shore up its economy and become a
major transportation hub, with Europe‚Äôs largest
railway station under construction. n

red to a metropolis like London or Pa ri s ,
Berlin was laid-back, q u i e t , almost sleepy
like a country village.
Bird‚Äôs eye view
of a burgeoning city
It was only by heading east in the city
t h at you started to feel uneasy‚Äîthe contrast
c o u l d n ‚Äôt have been gr e at e r. After passing
the rigorous border checks and changi n g
the obligat o ry amount of curr e n cy, you step-
ped through the Iron Curt a i n ‚Äî yet suppo-
sedly you were still in the same city.T h e
people all seemed so similar, with closed
expressions on their fa c e s.The pubs we r e
usually empty and you had the impression,
especially after 11 at night when the theat r e s
c l o s e d ,t h at the capital of the GDR had rol-
led up its sidewalks‚Äîbut  as it turned out,
this was only on the surface.
So much for the past.I t ‚Äôs now been almost
ten ye a rs since the Wall was pulled dow n .G e r-
m a ny is reunited and so is Berlin, which is
n ow the country ‚Äôs capital with the Bundestag
(parliament) and gove rnment having move d
from Bonn this summer. I t ‚Äôs been seven ye a rs
since I moved to the Mitte District on the bor-
der of Prenzlauer Berg in East Berlin.At firs t ,
c u riosity drew me here, the wish to discove r
this ‚Äú o t h e r ‚Äù city inside my ow n .We were lucky
enough to get hold of  a wasteland whose
ow n e rs had not been clearly identifie d .Yo u n g
people transformed empty halls, fa c t o ries and
ballrooms into art associat i o n s ,t h e atre wo r k-
shops and ‚Äú i n ‚Äùp u b s. As these new ve n u e s
became more established, the arts scene shif-
ted from West to East. Just a casual stroll will
lead you to marvel at an arr ay of conve rt e d
buildings and spaces that I doubt you wo u l d
find in any other city.
Right in the centre, just about 500 metres
n o rth of the Reichstag, t e e n a g e rs have car-

next to the pitch‚Äîremember this is bang slap
in the city centre, s u rrounded by office blocks
and shopping malls‚Äîthere‚Äôs a huge golf trai-
ning course for sports students and other
a m at e u rs.These initiat i ves aren‚Äôt motivat e d
by profit but by the simple desire to play vo l-
leyball or golf right dow n t ow n . But has
a nyone on the city council considered that
this area is going to be one of the most inve s t-
m e n t - at t r a c t i ve construction sites in the city
once the gove rn m e n t , the Bundestag and
their administrations have moved in?
Potsdamer Plat z , about 500 metres south
of the Reichstag, tells a completely different
s t o ry. Just after reunificat i o n , the Berlin
Senate thoughtlessly sold it off to Daimler
Benz and Sony. In the last few ye a rs , t h e
a r e a , which was the largest construction site
in Europe, has turned into an art i ficial com-
mercial district with new residential streets.
There used to be an insular tranquillity in
West Berlin, while a state-coerced calm pre-
vailed over East Berlin.To d ay both have fa l-
len between the cracks of the contrasting
d e velopments of volley ball courts and com-
mercial zones.
B e t ween these two areas, there is one
place from which one can pause to contem-
p l ate Berlin: the new terrace and dome of
the renovated Reichstag building provide a
b i r d ‚Äôs - e ye view, from a good distance, of this
city in full transform at i o n . If you look
t owards the west across the city centre‚Äôs
large park, the T i e r g a rt e n , little seems to
h ave changed. Early into a summer‚Äôs eve ,
you can see curls of smoke rising from
countless Berlin barbecues, most often
b e l o n ging to large Turkish families making
up for the absence of a  garden. A midday
stroll through the garden reveals another
Berlin peculiari t y : naked sunbat h e rs ri g h t
in the city centre!
N ow look east to find the view domina-
ted by a forest of cranes in action. Old bu i l-
Hard-hatted tourists take a guided visit to the Sony company‚Äôs building site on Potsdamer Platz, whose
concentration of cranes and construction works symbolizes the new Berlin.
The Oberbaumbr√ºcke, Berlin‚Äôs longest bridge, frames a boat-load of tourists on the river Spree. A terminus
for road traffic and an underground railway line before reunification, it was reopened in 1994.
If you look towards the west
across the city centre‚Äôs large
park, the Tiergarten, little
seems to have changed‚Ä¶
Now look east to find the view
dominated by a forest of
c ranes in action. Old buildings
dating from the GDR era which
are not protected as historica l
monuments are being
demolished to make way for
n ew construction.

### Four challenges for a new world
E D I T O R I A L
October 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 9
n
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt predict the future, but we can prepare it,‚Äù chemistry Nobel laureate Ilya
P ri g o gine once observe d . For the most part , the future will be what we make of it, e ve n
if by definition and through circumstance its fabric consists of uncertainty, change
and unpredictable creation.
Two major upheavals have profoundly changed our vision of the wo r l d .F i rs t , the scien-
tific revolution has taken us from an age of certainty and dogmatism and plunged us in
an ocean of uncertainty and doubt. We believed in the predictability of phenomena
governed by the imperious certainties of science:now the paradigms of determinism are
yielding to a concept of nature and history whose hallmark is uncertainty. Secondly, the
third industrial revo l u t i o n , based on the inform ation age and the rapid introduction of new
technology into all facets of human life, is changing the world into a global one.
Pa r a d ox i c a l l y, this globalizat i o n , far from creating a homogeneous global society,
whether desired or deplored, is subjecting societies to a logic of disintegr at i o n . It is a logi c
of selective pairi n g s , of exclusive gr o u p i n g s , of separat i o n , rifts and disaffil i at i o n .The highly
a s y m m e t ric economic success of a system which is based on the concept of liberty but has
forgotten equality and solidarity is a virtual political failure: it is coupled with an ethical
vacuum and with a complete lack of purp o s e .The power of globalization is devoid of mea-
ning.
In the face of these fractures and this va c u u m , four challenges must be fa c e d .The firs t
is that of peace, which is the precondition for successfully tackling all the others. Since the
end of the Cold Wa r , a fourth cat e g o ry of countries has appeared on the intern ational stage,
in addition to the industrialized and developing countries and those in transition. I t
comprises countries at war or emerging from conflict in which the state has often foun-
dered in genocide and intercommunal massacres.
The second challenge: will the coming century witness the onset of a new kind of pove rt y
whose victims will live side by side with unprecedented wealth? According to the United
N ations Development Progr a m m e , in 1960 the 20 per cent of the wo r l d ‚Äôs people who live
in the richest countries had 30 times the income of the poorest 20 per cent‚Äîby 1995 they
had 82 times as much income.
Sustainable development and the wise management of the global environment pose
the third gr e at challenge. E ve rywhere humanity is draining the resources which could have
fed tomorr ow ‚Äôs generat i o n .We have to find our way towards another type of deve l o p m e n t ,
one that is more economic, more intelligent, more cari n g . Because humanity has acquired
the technical capacity to commit collective suicide, it has to learn to assume the ‚Äú m a s t e ry
of mastery‚Äù,in the words of French philosopher Michel Serres.
The fourth challenge is that of the ‚Äúerratic boat‚Äùsyndrome.As a result of globaliza-
t i o n ,m a ny states appear to have mislaid their maps, compasses and direction-finding ins-
t ru m e n t s ,e ven the will to set a cours e .They are tossed about by the wave s , as though his-
t o ry had fallen into the hands of ‚Äú a n o nymous masters ‚Äù who can no longer be
controlled‚Äîfinancial markets,raw materials markets, statistics of all kinds.
But awareness of these problems has sharpened and solutions exist:hope remains. If
only we can find a way to give millions and millions of silent people a real opportunity to
use their freedom of thought and of speech, we would see the decisions of the mighty bow
to the only power that counts: that of the people.
G l o b a l i z ation must never remain confined to only the netwo r k s , t e l e c o m m u n i c a-
tions, computers, the media world or markets. It will have to be based on the consolida-
tion of a public democratic space worldwide.It is only on this condition that we will suc-
ceed in rendering globalization humane, making it a project with truly unive rsal promise,
and giving it a meaning.
This is the course we must plot for the twenty-first century. n

Once their work was done, t h e
Aborigines say, these supernatural crea-
tures‚Äîwhich still have influence over the
inhabitants and the fertility of the land‚Äî
spread out over the countryside, pausing
to fight or to rest, and established a num-
ber of sacred places: the so-called places
and trails of ‚ÄúDreamtime‚Äù.
But the dream stops right there.
Today, the Kakadu region is seen as the
site of one of the world‚Äôs richest deposits
of uranium. The park, the biggest in
Australia and the size of Belgi u m ,
contains an explosive mix‚Äîthe familiar
t u g - o f - war between conservation and
economic development, the tricky pro-
blem of radioactive waste and the asser-
tion of indigenous peoples‚Äô rights.
Three mining enclaves (Ranger,
Jabiluka and Koongarra) were mapped
out in the early 1970s, before the park
was created in 1979, Australian officials
point out.The Ranger mine has been ope-
rating since 1981. The Northern Land
Council (NLC), which officially repre-
sents the 16 local Aborigine tribes in the
running of the park, gave the go-ahead in
1982 for the Jabiluka mine.
A year later, things changed. A new
government was elected which curbed
uranium production and put the Jabiluka
project on hold. But ‚Äúwith the agreement
of the NLC and consent of the Aboriginal
traditional owners,‚Äù according to an April
1999 Australian government report, the

T HE HERI TAGE WORLD

The opening of a mine in Australia‚Äôs Kakadu Park has revived international debate about the
protection of the world heritage

‚Äò We are telling the truth. 
Non-Aborigine people often
doubt the sincerity 
of our cultures. But this sacred
site belongs to the Mirra r s . ‚Äô

How far should world heritage be
protected and who should judge?
Nearly 30 years after UNESCO adop-
ted its 1972 Convention on protecting
natural and cultural heritage sites ‚Äúof
outstanding universal value‚Äù, the ques-
tion is still stirring passions. The much-
publicized row over Kakadu, which was
put on the World Heritage List in 1981, is
the most recent example.
Supporters and opponents of extrac-
ting uranium from the Jabiluka mine,
which is an enclave in the park but not
officially part of it, have been fighting it
out for the past few years. Battles between
experts, flights of rhetoric, clashes bet-
ween police and militants, press campai-
gns, special meetings of UNESCO units
and diplomatic horse-trading have all
been part of this stormy episode of world
heritage.
Kakadu is in A u s t r a l i a ‚Äôs Nort h e rn
Territory and includes a wide range of
wetland and woodland ecosystems. The
area contains many rare species and
numerous places where ancient rock dra-
wings can be seen. Cultural traditions
there go back more than 50,000 years,
making it the continent‚Äôs oldest known
human settlement. This long history
makes its ‚Äúcultural landscape‚Äù a unique
s h owcase of the relationship betwe e n
humans and their environment.
Dreamtime
The scenery, plants and animals of the
region feature strongly in the religion and
traditions of the 550 or so Aborigines who
live in Kakadu.They keep a close spiritual
link to their lands, of which they are ‚Äútra-
ditional owners‚Äù under Australian law.
They believe they were put there by ‚Äúspi-
rit beings‚Äù such as the rainbow serpent,
which they say appeared at the time of the
world‚Äôs creation to give the planet its
shape and existence.
Australia (ERA), although the deposit
was still not being mined.
There was another U-turn in March
1996, when the Liberal Party won natio-
nal elections and said it favoured opening
new uranium mines, including the one at
Jabiluka.After environmental surveys, the
government gave a green light to ERA,
which started digging in early 1998. It
reckons the project, which will create
jobs, could earn up to $2.5 billion in
export earnings and produce $140 mil-
lion in royalties for the Aborigines. But
the 27 members of the Mirrar tribe are
dead against the project.
A ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù site
The Mirr a rs are the traditional
owners of the Jabiluka enclave.They say
the mine is dangerous for them and they
no longer feel bound by the agreement
the NLC signed in 1982.Their new lea-
der,Yvonne Margarula, has proved very
tough. They say the Aborigine leaders,
including her late father, were pushed
into the agreement by the mining compa-
nies at a time when Aborigine rights were
still little enforced and their leaders unu-
sed to ‚Äúmodern‚Äù negotiations.
The Mirrars also consider the expe-
rience of the Ranger mine inconclusive.
Although the Aborigines have received
r oya l t i e s , ‚Äúthe social situation in the
region has not improved since the 1980s,‚Äù
according to a 1997 survey commissioned
by several of the parties involved in run-
ning Kakadu, including ERA. U n l i k e
other Aborigine tribes who favour the
mining, the Mirrars say it will turn their
lives upside down and threaten their tra-
ditional subsistence economy based on
hunting and gathering. They also stress
that the site of the mine is a very sacred
spot, one of the ‚ÄúDreaming‚Äù places that
are ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù because disturbing them
will have terrible consequences. ‚ÄúWe are
telling the truth,‚Äù says Margarula. ‚ÄúNon-
Aborigine people often doubt the sinceri-

It was also concerned about the mine‚Äôs
‚Äúvisual impact‚Äù on the site and the dama-
ge it might cause to the daily culture and
religion of the Mirrars.

Taken in October 1998, this aerial shot clearly shows the advanced state of construction of the Jabiluka mine by the company Energy Resources of Australia. 
The Mirrars, an Aboriginal group, maintain that the mine would seriously harm their most sacred sites.

and Jerusalem, so we should
respect these holy places too.
The problem is that nobody

ty of our cultures. But this sacred site
belongs to the Mirrars.‚Äù
The tribe teamed up with ecology
activists to form the Jabiluka Blockade in
1996 to halt the project, and militants
have clashed with police at the site several
times. Almost two-thirds of Australians
say they are against opening the mine. An
a g gr e s s i ve intern ational campaign has
been launched and has spread around the
world.
The dispute soon landed on the desk
of UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage Committee,
on which sit representatives of 21 coun-
tries each elected for six years. They have
been inundated by hundreds of letters
denouncing the mine‚Äôs threat to the envi-
ronment and the cultural rights of the
Mirrars. The World Conservation Union,
one of the Committee‚Äôs three advisory
bodies, confirms that the danger is real.
The Committee decided to send
experts to Kakadu in June 1998.The mis-
sion reported that there were ‚Äú s e ve r e
ascertained and potential dangers to the
cultural and natural values‚Äùof the park.It
noted the scientific uncertainty about the
impact of the mining on water supplies
and aquatic wildlife and about the long-
term effect of stored radioactive tailings.

The mission criticized the fact that the
building of the mine was presented to the
World Heritage Committee as a ‚Äúfait

h ave been told about it before wo r k
began, according to the terms of the 1972
Convention. It called on the Australian
government to revise the 1982 and 1991
agreements so as to protect the Mirrars‚Äô
cultural rights.
In December 1998, the Committee,
meeting in Kyoto (Ja p a n ) , urged the
Australian government to stop building
the mine and scheduled a special session

for July 1999 to decide whether to classi-
fy Kakadu as an endangered heritage site.
The NGOs were very pleased and the
Australian government launched a coun-
ter-attack.
The Kakadu dispute has many
domestic political implications and has
set off fierce arguments with the opposi-
tion Labor Party and the Greens, who
challenge the government‚Äôs environmen-
tal policies and accuse it of jeopardizing
the process of reconciliation with the
Aborigines, which was stepped up in the
early 1990s.
The environment minister, S e n .
Robert Hill, led a strong delegation to
Paris to stress several points. First, that
Australia had no lessons to learn from
anyone.It had been among the first coun-
tries to sign the Convention in 1974 and
had changed its laws accordingly. The
mission said Australia had the biggest
expanse of world heritage sites of all the
signatory countries and that it spent $30
million a year on maintaining them.
Alcohol and Western food
Hill emphasized that the mining
enclaves were already there when the site
was put on the World Heritage List and
that Australia had said at the time it reser-
ved the right to start operations at
Jabiluka. The Ranger mine had not cau-
sed any environmental damage, t h e
Australian delegates said, pointing to
their country‚Äôs long experience in mining
and very strict regulation of it on ecologi-
cal and health grounds. Citing a number
of experts, they said environmental risk
was small and the way the radioactive tai-
lings were stored was very safe.The mine
was also hidden by hills and hardly visible
from the park. It could only really be seen
from the air and only 10 per cent of visi-
tors to Kakadu flew over the park.
Recalling that the Aborigines had ini-
tially agreed to mining at Jabiluka, the
officials said the mine did not directly
threaten the sacred sites, which were pro-
tected under Australian law.They in effect
accused the Mirrars of using their religion
as an argument to derail the project.The
April 1999 government report said it was
not until 1997 that there was a call to
extend Boyweg, one of the sacred sites,
possibly to cover the whole mining valley.
‚ÄúThese revisions upgraded the site from
‚Äòsacred‚Äô to ‚Äòsacred and dangerous‚Äô,‚Äù it
said, adding that the new call was ‚Äúnot
consistent with anthropological records
or previous statements.‚Äù
The delegation also said the govern-
ment was not responsible for the slow
social and economic development of the
Aborigines and the breaking down of
their culture. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stop them using
r oyalties to buy alcohol and We s t e rn
food,‚Äù one delegation member told the
C o m m i t t e e . The Australians promised
however to revise ERA‚Äôs mining plans and
resume talks with the Mirrars to establish
their cultural rights more clearly.
Then, on July 12, 1999, Hill sprung a
surprise: the Jabiluka mine would start
operations in 2001 but just slowly, only
reaching full capacity when the Ranger
mine had virtually closed in about 10
years‚Äô time. The government would ear-
mark $1.8 million to beef up the park‚Äôs
infrastructure and would step up efforts
to improve housing, water supply, educa-
tion, health and the job situation for the
Aborigines.
‚ÄúThere will be an enquiry in coming
months to assess the danger to the cultu-
ral property of the Aborigines,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúWe intend to appoint a mediator bet-
ween the traditional owners and ERA.
We‚Äôre going to take a break. We recognize
the problems of mining in this environ-
ment, even if the mine is not strictly part
of the park.‚Äù
The World Heritage Committee deci-
ded not to classify Kakadu as an endan-
gered heritage site. But the Committee
said it was still ‚Äúgravely concerned‚Äùby the
mine‚Äôs impact on the living cultures of
Kakadu and by the lack of dialogue and
progress in jointly managing the Mirrar
people‚Äôs cultural heritage. It said it had
s i g n i ficant reservations concerning the
‚Äúscientific uncertainties‚Äù relating to the
project and asked the Australian govern-
ment to present new reports before April
15, 2000.
The many NGO representatives who
came to UNESCO headquarters at the
same time as the delegation strongly pro-
tested.The Wilderness Society called the
Committee‚Äôs decision ‚Äúa dramatic capitu-
l ation to intense pressure from the
Australian gove rn m e n t .‚Äù It and other
NGOs said the decision damaged the

1972 Convention‚Äôs credibility and was the
outcome of a ‚Äúdirty tricks campaign‚Äù by
Australia to win over the countries repre-
sented on the Committee.
The government had announced in
early 1999 a $600,000 lobbying campaign
to prevent Kakadu being classified as an
endangered site. It also said in June 1999
it would back the candidacy of Australia‚Äôs
former foreign minister Gareth Evans to
succeed Fe d e rico Mayor as Director-
General of UN E S C O. The W i l d e rn e s s
Society said it hoped such backing was
not simply ‚Äúa way of pressuring‚Äù the cur-
rent chair of the World Heri t a g e
Committee, Japan‚Äôs Koichiro Matsuura,
who is also a candidate to replace Mayor.
A p a rt from its many political dimen-
s i o n s , the Kakadu affair has shown how
vulnerable world heritage is. H ow far must
p r e s e rvation go, when exceptional land-
scapes and monuments are increasingly
under threat , as evidenced by the lengthe-
ning list of endangered sites, which now
total 23? Can mining or other economic
projects be blocked when they endanger
sites but when the need for jobs and deve-
lopment is more and more urgent? A n d
who should decide the importance of a site
and how it should be preserve d ?
‚ÄúIn the begi n n i n g, world heritage wa s
d e fined in the light of We s t e rn artistic cul-
tural traditions,‚Äù s ays Cleere. ‚ÄúBut that ‚Äôs
c h a n g e d . N ow we recognize cultures
which aren‚Äôt monuments but where the
landscape has a ve ry gr e at cultural va l u e ,
especially in A f rica and Oceania. T h e y
h ave to be protected in the name of huma-
n i t y.‚Äù
But what should be done when their
importance is not fully appreciated, inclu-
ding in their own country? How far can
the international community go to pro-
tect them? The jury is still out. Under the
1972 Convention,countries which ask for
sites to be put on the World Heritage List
must recognize them as ‚Äúa world heritage
for whose protection it is the duty of the
international community to co-operate‚Äù.
But they can also interpret it as meaning

P L A N E T
‚ÄòNow we recognize cultures
which aren‚Äôt monuments 
but where the landscape 
has a very great cultural value,
especially in Africa 
and Oceania. They have 
to be protected in the name 
of humanity. ‚Äô
their sovereignty will be ‚Äútotally respec-
ted‚Äù.
With Kakadu, the Australian govern-
ment has stuck to a very narrow interpre-
tation of the Convention regarding inter-
national co-operation,as embodied by the
Committee. It has refused to recognize
the Committee‚Äôs right to list the site as
endangered without its prior agreement.
Sen. Hill has also challenged the way the
Committee works by questioning the legi-
timacy of its advisory bodies, saying ‚Äúthe
role of so-called independent experts and
advisers is up for scrutiny in the future.‚Äù
Eco-imperialism
He has thereby given comfort to those
who oppose joint management of world
h e ri t a g e . Fo rty members of the U. S .
C o n gress have backed Australia ove r
Kakadu, denouncing UNESCO‚Äôs supposed
‚Äúeco-imperialism‚Äù.
In a petition to President Bill Clinton
on July 1, 1 9 9 9 , they said any dispute ove r
an Australian mine should be settled by
Australians ‚Äú working with their elected
l e a d e rs , not at some obscure Wo r l d
H e ritage Committee.‚ÄùThey urged Clinton
to ensure that the Committee did not
‚Äú m e d d l e ‚Äù in the Jabiluka issue. The pres-
sure group also wants world heritage sites
in the United States to be controlled by the
U. S . C o n gr e s s. It said this demand was ‚Äú a
response to the Committee‚Äôs meddling in a
dispute regarding a proposed gold mine
l o c ated on pri vate property outside the
b o u n d a ry of Ye l l owstone National Pa r k ‚Äù .
The U. S . g ove rnment forced the abandon-
ment of the mining project there in 1996,
after Ye l l owstone was declared an endange-
red world heritage site.
These and many other examples show
that joint management of world heritage
is neve rtheless gaining gr o u n d . T h e
Jabiluka affair was not part of this trend,
but it has illustrated the astonishing orga-
nizational power of supporters of world
g ove rn a n c e . N G O s , politicians (the
European Parliament voted against the
mine in January 1999) and ordinary citi-
zens all over the world were inspired to
campaign to ‚Äúsave Kakadu‚Äù.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen anything like this,‚Äù
says Sarah Titchen, who is in charge of
the case at UN E S C O‚Äôs World Heri t a g e
Centre.‚ÄúNow everyone around the world
involved in world heritage knows about
Kakadu.‚Äù
Meanwhile the saga continues. T h e
M i rr a rs are now opposing, quite legally,
the building of a 15-km road through their
t e rri t o ry. The road would allow ERA to
take uranium mined at Jabiluka to be trea-
ted at the Ranger mining complex, w h i c h
would be less environmentally harmful bu t
most of all, much cheaper. ERA has eve n
hinted it will leave the Kakadu region by
2006 if the Mirr a rs do not gi ve way. I t
s h o u l d n ‚Äôt count on the rainbow serpent to
advise them to do so. n
At the White House in April 1999, Hillary Clinton welcomes Yvonne Margarula, one of the 27 Mirrar
‚Äútraditional owners‚Äù of the Jabiluka enclave who had recently received the Goldman Environmental Prize
along with Jacqui Katona, (in background) for the campaign against the uranium mine.

more distinction between ‚Äú l i t e r a cy‚Äùand ‚Äú e d u-

contrasting programmes in differing areas
of Nepal. The classes in We s t e rn Nepal

of forming wo m e n ‚Äôs micro-credit gr o u p s.
The programme near Kathmandu (in Lalit-

NGO which developed its own lesson sheets
linking literacy skills to health awareness.
In both cours e s , which were run by local

health messages through stories about vil-

recommended practices. S e veral of the older
women challenged the messages and ironi-

older women cackled away and then the joker
turned her attention to me:‚ÄúWhat can I do‚Äî

aching, I‚Äôm tired out.‚Äù
As Nani was an older experienced fa c i-
l i t at o r , she could handle the wo m e n ‚Äôs sar-
c a s m ,s y m p athizing with those who were too
tired to study. But the younger girls who ran
classes found the discussion style daunting
and resorted to chanting of alphabet letters
i n s t e a d .A further issue was around language:
the course was written in Nepali, p a rtly in
response to the younger women who saw
flu e n cy in the latter as opening more doors
to them than their local tongue, N e wa ri .
H owe ver the older women insisted that the

appoint a leader and that person had to attend a

In both, the A rutar and Lalitpur classes,
the women encouraged the teachers to spend

In Arutar, low-caste women who learn to read and write are often more strongly motivated by a desire

### Questioning the ABCs of women's literacy

the teacher‚Äôs authority in relation to the deve-
lopment ideas, they welcomed a more hie-
rarchical relationship where they called the
teacher ‚Äú M i s s ‚Äù ,a n swered the register and imi-
t ated the kind of education they had seen in
local schools. A l i n a , the A rutar fa c i l i t at o r ,
responded by treating the women (who we r e
much older than she) as school children,e ve n
though she knew well the constraints wo m e n
faced as they were her neighbours :
A l i n a : Did you understand it? I said so
much myself I don‚Äôt know if you unders t o o d .
To m o rr ow don‚Äôt bring any children.And study
at home.
All the women laugh‚Äîno time.
A l i n a : If you can‚Äôt study,h ow can I teach?
Go home and study in any free moment yo u
have,here and there.
So what did women gain from literacy
c l a s s e s ? Although many women challenged
the teaching methods, language of instru c-
tion or course content, their ve ry presence at
the classes suggested that they still saw some-
thing to be gained from literacy.As time we n t
o n , I realized that what they valued in the
e x p e rience was less tangible than the skills of
keeping written accounts or reading about
wo rm s. When I talked to Sansara, t h e
wo m e n ‚Äôs group treasurer, she was keen to
s h ow me the part of the records book where
the women had signed their names. I noticed
on another page that there were only thumb
p rints‚Äîthese were the marks of their hus-
bands who had attended in their place one
d ay.The fact that a wife could sign in place of
a thumb pri n t , when her husband could not,
i n d i c ated some important changes taking
p l a c e .S u rp ri s i n g l y,most men did not see this
as a threat to their authori t y, as they regarded
w riting as just one skill which one member of
the family needed. For the women howe ve r ,
signing their name constituted a new identity
as a ‚Äú l i t e r at e ‚Äù wo m a n .When I attended the
annual parents‚Äô meeting at A rutar school, I
d i s c overed that the few women who came did
so partly to assert their identity in a public
arena through signing the regi s t e r.
A private space
An incident that I observed at the A ru t a r
l i t e r a cy class made me realize that some
women were beginning to use literacy for their
own purp o s e s : I sat next to Misra and glanced
at her book‚Äîshe had written something about
h e rs e l f.She covered it with her hand when she saw
me looking.Alina [teacher] asked her wh at she
had written‚Äîsomething that was in my mind,
she answe r e d .But still she refused to show it.I wa s
i n t rigued to think that Misra‚Äîthe husband
who refused to let her come to the literacy class
r e g u l a r l y ‚Äî was now perhaps expressing her-
self through wri t i n g . It seemed that wri t i n g
(and reading) might provide a pri vate space
for women to reflect on their experi e n c e s.F u r-
ther proof of this are some of the articles and
s t o ries written by women published as a fol-
l ow-up to the literacy course (see box ) .
So whose agenda should determine the
kind of programmes on offer? The link being
made between literacy and inform ation on
h e a l t h ,n u t rition or income generating through
the ‚Äú f u n c t i o n a l ‚Äù approach seemed to result
p ri m a rily from the aid agencies‚Äô need to pro-
duce quantifiable results from literacy pro-
gr a m m e s. My experiences in Nepal show that
we , the ‚Äú d e ve l o p e rs ‚Äù ,h ave not taken time to
u n d e rstand where women are starting from,
and more import a n t l y,where they want to go.
They may already have knowledge about
n u t rition and skills in chicken-rearing and
In the following story from Sangalo, a collec-
tion published by Save the Children (USA) for
n e o - l i t e rates, Sushila Uparkoti from Arutar
explains her position as a low-caste woman. 
‚ÄúNepal‚Äôs thirty-six castes are like one com-
mon flower garden.‚Äù1 Low castes are oppressed.
Women  are not allowed to go to places like
water holes, inns, temples. Our fathers and
mothers used to say that our caste was not to
study. What‚Äôs the point of studying? Can‚Äôt get a
proper job, they used to say. When they wanted
to write letters they had to go the upper castes.
They had to work all morning for others in order
to have one letter written. Seeing our own condi-
tion, we feel very worried. Even at the adult class
we had to sit apart from upper caste friends. But
after studying, we realized that one of the rea-
sons for being backward was our lack of educa-
tion. Nowadays after studying in the adult class,
we can say and write some of the things in our
minds. Nowadays, mother and father are very
pleased that we can read and write letters. They
have started sending younger brothers and sis-
ters to school. The number of low castes at
school has increased. It seems for lack of educa-
tion we were dominated and suppressed. n

who unified Nepal in the 18th century.
they may not want to learn to write agendas
for meetings or accounts. Is the desire to wri t e
about your feelings as a low-caste woman or to
read religious books as justifiable as the more
concrete development aims? If women want to
i m i t ate a style of education provided in tradi-
tional village schools, should the aid agencies
be supporting this? 
Gains in self-confidence
The illustrations from Nepalese classrooms
d e m o n s t r ate that if women are not getting the
kind of literacy that they wa n t , they either drop
out or put pressure on class fa c i l i t at o rs to focus
on what they enjoy. Aid agencies need to
respond to this challenge and gi ve wo m e n
more direct control over what they learn and
h ow.This can be done by conducting initial
research into wo m e n ‚Äôs specific needs and inter-
e s t s : not eve ryone wants to write about their
l i ve s , just as some women may prefer to learn
h ow to write accounts.
L i t e r a cy programmes can be based on
wo m e n ‚Äôs own interests and an unders t a n d i n g
of the local context,r ather than a unive rsal ste-
reotype of an ‚Äú i l l i t e r at e ‚Äù wo m a n .E d u c at i o n
around issues such as family planning can
b e gin from a more critical approach that
encourages women to analyse their problems
and find ways to address them.L i t e r a cy - f o c u-
sed programmes are only beginning to draw
on such part i c i p at o ry planning approaches in
an attempt to provide support for wo m e n ‚Äôs
existing (rather than imagined or projected)
l i t e r a cy needs.The development outcomes of
such programmes might be more difficult to
e va l u ate than the numbers of savings gr o u p s
f o rmed or scores on a health knowledge test.
But the gains in wo m e n ‚Äôs self-confidence and
changes in social relationships should be long
lasting and eventually improve their quality of

The industrialized world stands out as an excep-
tion on the global Aids map: it has managed to
stabilize the rate of new infections and to shar-
ply reduce the number of Aids deaths through new
combinations of anti-HIV drugs.But everywhere else,
the pandemic is spre a d i n g, while the sick are tre a-
ted poorly if at all. This is notably the case in South
and East A s i a ,a n d , most dra m a t i c a l l y, s u b - S a h a ra n
Africa where the epidemic rages out of control in
s e v e ral countries. Six million people were infected
with HIV in 1998. Four million of them live in sub-
S a h a ran A f r i c a . Of the two and a half million people
who died last year of A i d s, two million were A f r i c a n
( p p. 2 0 - 2 1 ) .
T h e re is no vaccine to prevent the disease, a n d
new combinations of drug therapies are too costly
for the South.The only available weapon is pre v e n-
t i o n ,which is becoming ever more vital since about
half of new HIV infections are in young people.Yo u t h
also tend to be more open than adults to learning
about safer sexual behaviour.
But for preventive education to be effective, i t
must be a priority for everyone.‚Äú We‚Äôve pre f e r red to
keep our eyes shut,‚Äù states Peter Piot, e x e c u t i v e
d i rector of UNAIDS (pp. 1 8 - 1 9 ) .Aids bears a heavy
symbolic burden which helps to explain why it is all
too often treated as a taboo,especially in sub-Saha-
ran Africa (pp. 2 2 - 2 4 ) . Schools are only just begin-
ning to focus on Aids education (pp. 3 0 - 2 1 ) ,which is
further complicated by the stigma surro u n d i n g
people living with the disease (pp. 3 5 - 3 6 ) .
N o n e t h e l e s s, new approaches can bear fruit.T h e
results are seen clearly in Southeast Asia (pp.2 7 - 2 8 ) ,
s p e c i fically in Thailand with the ‚Äú100 per cent Condom
C a m p a i g n ‚Äù( p.2 9 ) ,as well as in sub-Saharan Africa by
way of films (p. 2 5 ) , t raditional healers 
( p.2 6 ) , Ko ranic schools (p.33) and school teachers (p.
3 2 ) . South America also offers positive signs, as seen
with a pro g ramme tailored for street children in Mexico
( p.3 4 ) .Most importantly, s t resses Piot,politicians no
longer need to be convinced of the value and neces-
sity of pre v e n t i o n .

18 The UNESCO Courier - October 1999
Around half of all new cases of HIV infection 
in the world involve young people between 
15 and 24. Why?
Because that‚Äôs the age when you begin experi-
menting with sex and change partners most
often, which multiplies the risk of infection. Our
studies in Kenya and Zambia show 15, even 23
per cent of girls between 15 and 19 are HIV-posi-
tive, compared with only three to four per cent of
boys. Girls are more vulnerable for both biologi-
cal reasons (the female genitals are more suscep-
tible to infection than those of males and are par-
ticularly vulnerable in the case of girls because
they have not yet developed) as well as socio-cul-
tural ones (whether they are won over by gifts or
are the victims of force, they often have as part-
ners adult men who because of their age are more
likely to be HIV-positive than boys).
The roots of the problem lie mainly in pover-
ty and male chauvinism.Hence the importance of
educating boys, who have to be taught that their
worth doesn‚Äôt depend on the number of women
they‚Äôve seduced. We have to change the whole
‚Äúsexual culture‚Äù as it were. But we have to be
humble: we‚Äôre not going to change the world in
the space of a few years.
What‚Äôs the impact of preventive education on
young people‚Äôs sexual behaviour?
Youth are more receptive to prevention mes-
sages and go on to adopt a more responsible atti-
tude to sexuality than adults. In countries where
there‚Äôs been a good response to prevention cam-
paigns, we‚Äôve seen a very marked drop in the rate
of infection among the 15 to 24-year-olds. In the
past eight years, the rate in Ugandan urban areas
has fallen 40 per cent. In Zambia, it has dropped
most markedly among schoolchildren.
All this shows that education has an impor-
tant role to play. Even though it‚Äôs true that many
children in developing countries don‚Äôt go to
school, the majority nevertheless pass through
school. The opportunity must be seized to give
them an education about Aids adapted to their
age-group, right from the start of primary school.
Some people still fear this will encourage children
to have sexual relationships, but has anyone ever
waited for lessons before starting their sexual life?
It‚Äôs been statistically proven that preventive edu-
cation makes people much more sexually respon-
sible, namely by having sexual relationships later
and using protection.
Is Aids education given the attention it deserves in
schools?
Quite honestly, no, and not even in industria-
lized countries. But extraordinary work is being
done in some places. Brazil, for example, has a
very good programme, which begins in primary
schools and is backed by UNESCO. Zimbabwe too,
where UNICEF is helping. Ugandan schools have
introduced a new curriculum subject called
‚Äústraight talk‚Äù in which pupils comment on daily
newspaper sections written specifically for young
people. The experiment is spreading in Kenya
and a few other countries, but there‚Äôs a long way
to go before it becomes general practice.
I myself plan to strengthen my contacts with
education officials, government ministries and
teachers‚Äô unions. Curricula which include the
Aids question have been designed, tested and
then not applied, like many good intentions. It‚Äôs
no longer a question of developing teaching mate-
rials, but of making use of them.
The United Nations General Assembly recently
declared its goal to cut the rate of new infection
among young people by a quarter in the countries
hardest hit by the epidemic. Isn‚Äôt this overly
ambitious?
Ambitious yes, but not unrealistic. Experience
has shown it can be done if you get all sectors of
society involved, starting with youth. UNAIDS
works a lot with young people. We design aware-
ness campaigns not just with young staff mem-
bers in their early 20s but also after consulting
teenagers whose ideas are always, I must say,
quite refreshing.
Since 1997, we‚Äôve had an annual World Aids
Campaign which targets young people.This year,
the young Brazilian footballer Ronaldo has
agreed to be involved. His words carry much
more weight than mine among the youth of poor
communities like those where he grew up. The
popular Ugandan singer Philly Lutaaya also wor-
ked with us before he died of Aids. If all the
famous people who are HIV-positive admitted the

Getting youth through the Aids crisis
fact, as Lutaaya did,it would have a great impact.
But they often keep quiet and I understand their
fear of being rejected if they admit it. Aids is
Janus-faced, and each side is just as terrifying as
the other‚Äîone is the virus that kills and the other
is the society, which also kills.
How can the stigma be fought?
That‚Äôs my latest priority, in fact. To be prag-
matic, we send volunteers who are open about
having HIV to work in schools, hospitals, govern-
ment ministries and other key places. T h i s
‚Äúpublic‚Äù approach to Aids has a much greater
effect than any speech about respecting the indi-
vidual. These volunteers are already working in
Malawi, Zambia, Thailand, South Africa and
Burundi and soon in Burkina Faso. I‚Äôd like to
spread this strategy all over the world, but we
don‚Äôt have the resources and it‚Äôs very hard to find
people willing to take on such a mission.
Why do you think Aids is still largely cloaked in
silence 20 years after it appeared?
The taboo surrounding Aids is a universal
phenomenon. In most societies, talking about
sexuality isn‚Äôt easy, even between two partners.
Also, the impact of Aids on societies wasn‚Äôt felt as
strongly 15 years ago as today. People also go into
denial, which is an instinctive reaction to danger.
Read The Plague by Albert Camus again.Another
natural reaction is to say that it‚Äôs only something
that happens to others. So for 20 years,we‚Äôve pre-
ferred to keep our eyes shut. Uganda, Senegal
and Thailand are among the very few countries
whose political leaders have reacted in a timely
manner. It isn‚Äôt just a matter of poor countries
either: U.S. President Ronald Reagan never pro-
nounced the word ‚ÄúAids‚Äù in public.
But this year,the dialogue has started going in
the other direction. Until now, I had to convince
political leaders that the situation was serious in
their countries. Now it‚Äôs they who are taking the
initiative.That‚Äôs a big step forward.
How do you explain this turn-around?
First,the impact of Aids on societies has beco-
me so great it can‚Äôt be ignored any longer, despi-
te the tremendous human capacity for denial.
Then, without boasting, I have to say that the
concerted action of the United Nations has hel-
ped a lot. We‚Äôre seizing every opportunity to
spread the message about Aids by going all out to
increase the number of sectors we work with‚Äî
groups like boy scouts,women‚Äôs movements,pea-
sants and others. I myself meet heads of state,
mayors of big cities, ministers of finance, business
leaders, army generals, musicians, footballers,
bishops and imams‚Äîanyone who can influence
members of a society. Religious leaders can be a
big obstacle to a prevention campaign but I most-
ly consider them to be allies.
Are they really allies?
I‚Äôve noticed that those religious leaders in
close contact with the population‚Äîthe parish
priest, the village imam‚Äîare the most receptive
to prevention campaigns, including encouraging
the use of condoms, which is the most delicate
aspect.The further you go up the hierarchy, the
harder dialogue becomes. Nevertheless, a Vatican
envoy attended our March 1999 conference in
Buenos Aires about involving priests in the fight
against Aids. The message of the conference was
clear: sex education at school is vital. Only a few
years ago, this was inconceivable. n

Facts about A i d s
Aids‚Äîacquired immunodeficiency syndrome‚Äîis
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus
( H I V ) , which weakens the body‚Äôs immune system.
Once they have an established HIV infection, i n d i v i-
duals are infected for life and will probably succumb to
serious opportunistic infections caused by the weake-
ning of their immune system. Treatment with antiretro-
viral drugs can slow the progression of HIV infection
but these expensive medications are not available to
most people in the developing world, who often lack
access even to drugs that combat opportunistic infec-
t i o n s. In individuals who do not get antiretroviral the-
r a p y, the time between infection with HIV and the
development of the serious illnesses that define Aids is
around eight years, and most patients do not survive
much more than two years after their onset.
HIV spreads through unprotected sex (intercourse
without a condom), transfusions of unscreened blood,
contaminated needles (most frequently for injecting drug
u s e ) , and from an infected woman to her child during pre-
gnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIV is a slow-acting virus.The majority of infected indi-
viduals look healthy and feel well for many years after
i n f e c t i o n ; they may not even suspect they harbour the
virus, though they can transmit it to others. Conservative
UNAIDS estimates are that 90% of all HIV-infected people
worldwide do not know they have the virus. A laboratory
blood or saliva test is the only certain way to determine
whether an individual is HIV-positive. n

Some two decades after the virus started to
s p r e a d , HIV/Aids is a gr owing crisis dispro-
p o rt i o n ately weighing on youth and on the
d e veloping wo r l d .About a third of the 33.4 million
people world-wide living with HIV are aged 15-24,
and half of all new HIV infections occur among this
gr o u p. F i ve young people are infected eve ry minute.
F u rt h e rm o r e , studies in A f rica show girls have four
or more times the infection rate of boys.
The developing world accounted for 95%,and
Sub-Saharan A f rica alone for 70% of new HIV
infections in 1998.Aids is now the biggest killer in
A f ri c a . Nine out of ten HIV infections among chil-
dren under 15 last year occurred in A f ri c a .I n fa n t
m o rtality in some A f rican countries rose as much
as 150% in 1998 alone. Life expectancy is fa l l i n g
by as much as 20 ye a rs as a result of A i d s.The cri s i s
is also having an impact on economic deve l o p m e n t ,
with many A f rican companies saying Aids illness
and death costs sometimes total more than corpo-
r ate profits. Elsewhere too the crisis is gaining
gr o u n d . In A s i a , of the 7.2 million people living with
Aids,a fifth were infected last year.
W h at is perhaps most startling is that HIV is
expected to gather force as a killer. In 1990 it
accounted for 8.6% of adult deaths from infectious
diseases in the developing wo r l d .By 2020, t h at fig u r e
is expected to rise to 37.1%. n

### A Slow march forward
1 The African epicentre
A slow march f o r w a rd
w Damien Rwegera
In the eye of the global Aids epidemic,Africa has no choice but to
o rganize a massive, m u l t i - p ronged prevention campaign which mobilizes
the broadest range of players
The Aids epidemic raging in sub-Saharan A f ri c a
is one of the wo rst plagues of recent centuri e s.
The region has only a tenth of the wo r l d ‚Äôs
p o p u l at i o n , but is home to two-thirds of the total
number of people with HIV/Aids.Two-thirds of
those infected in 1998 live in the region and the
s i t u ation is ‚Äúout of control‚Äù in some countri e s ,a c c o r-
ding to UNAIDS.
Sub-Saharan A f rica is the poorest region of the
p l a n e t , a fact which deepens the cri s i s. In this
c o n t e x t ,p r e vention is the only way out and to dat e ,
it has been glaringly inadequat e .H owe ve r , the qua-
l i fied success of preve n t i ve measures in some A f ri c a n
c o u n t ries demonstrates that actions can be as effec-
tive in stemming the crisis there as anywhere else.
The main problem lies in cultural attitudes to
i l l n e s s , pain and deat h . A f ricans tend to regard
disease not as something phy s i o l o gical but as the
result of social or religious fa c t o rs , such as a curs e ,
poisoning or divine punishment.
More than any other disease, Aids is associa-
ted with death and sex. With sperm and vaginal
fluids. It is passed on by blood and a mother‚Äôs
milk. All this gives it powerful symbolism while
making it a veritable taboo leading people to go
so far as to deny its existence. Out of derision,
some young people in francophone countries say
that Sida, the French acronym for the disease,
stands for Syndrome Invented to Discourage
Lovers (in French). They are not convinced by
scientific explanations of the disease especially
after the bogus reasons trumpeted at the begin-
ning of the epidemic: namely that A f ricans we r e
responsible for spreading the disease because they
‚Äúhad sex with green monkeys‚Äù. A f ricans responded
in kind, claiming that ‚ÄúAids comes from white
p e o p l e , especially white women who kiss their dogs
and sleep in the same bed with them‚Äù.
The main goal of preventive education is to
fight such ignorance and fantasies. The second
goal‚Äîto explain how to protect against it‚Äîruns
up against a similar problem of perception:
condoms are a ‚Äúwhite people‚Äôs thing‚Äù. Moreover,
they are so expensive that sometimes a person has
to choose between buying something to eat or
having safe sex. For an African earning about $50
a month,paying nearly 20 cents for four condoms
is out of the question.
The effectiveness of preve n t i ve education has
to take into account these cultural perceptions and
m i s u n d e rstandings and respect social stru c t u r e s. I n
A f ri c a , e ven in cities, adolescents just cannot talk
to their parents about sex. Such discussion is limited
to people of their own age and sex.So Aids educa-
tion must follow suit: wo m e n , men and teenagers
each have to be approached in different ways.
Adults have to drastically change acquired
h a b i t s.Te e n a g e rs have to be persuaded to adopt safe
sexual habits, a much easier task.Yet this is a long-
t e rm job operating on three leve l s ‚Äî awa r e n e s s ,i n f o r-
mation and education.
Despite meagre resources, A f rican countri e s
h ave made gr e at efforts to raise awareness and
spread inform at i o n . Po s t e rs and radio are the favo u-
red methods. Pe r f o rming arts presentations and
advertising are also often used. Experience shows
t h at condom sales increase in the ten days follow i n g
an awareness campaign. But these campaigns must
happen more frequently to be effective because repe-
tition is the key.
Reaching young people
in hierarchical societies
E d u c ating young people is still the main chal-
lenge because they are the chief victims of A i d s.
Around half of the newly-infected people wo r l d w i d e
are between the ages of 15 and 24. In 1998, 90 per
cent of the wo r l d ‚Äôs infected people under 15 lived in
sub-Saharan A f rica where there is a tendency to
engage in sexual relations at a relat i vely young age.
These relations are often forced, with 12 and 13-
year-old girls often the victims of sexual abu s e .

B i o √© t h i q u e : la tentation de l‚Äôenfant parfaitGetting youth hr ugh the Aids crisis
The world spends $1.5
billion each year on
Aids prevention.
Pa r a d o x i c a l l y, o n l y
$200 million a year are
spent in sub-Saharan
A f r i c a , which has the
highest concentration
of HIV carriers. A f r i c a n
states provide 10 per
cent of this amount.
This is a mark of their
p o v e r t y, but also a
mark of their
i n s u f fic i e n t
commitment to a
prevention policy
D r. F ran√ßois Chi√®ze,
Managing director of 
the Pan-African A i d s
O rg a n i z a t i o n
Schools would seem to be the ideal place to
reach youth and most countries have at last inclu-
ded preve n t i ve education in the school curri c u l u m
(see pp. 3 0 - 3 1 ) . But in sub-Saharan A f ri c a ,a b o u t
t wo-thirds of all pri m a ry school-age children and
80 per cent of secondary school-age children do not
go to school.So while schools must be part of pre-
ve n t i o n , it will take some time before they have a
real impact. In A f ri c a , more than any other regi o n ,
the only way to attack the epidemic is to mobilize
all the major actors in society at eve ry leve l ‚Äî t h e
g ove rn m e n t , civil society, local communities and
foreign aid sources.The higher placed they are, t h e
gr e ater impact they will have gi ven the fact that A f ri-
can societies are so hierarchical.
At the top are those with political powe r.T h e y
bear considerable responsibility for the spread of
the pandemic.Their only excuse for inaction is that
the continent is beset with terrible problems. I n
c o u n t ries at wa r ,Aids is hardly a pri o ri t y.And when
t h e r e ‚Äôs no wa r ,p ove rty is people‚Äôs main concern ‚Äî
not A i d s. After all, the disease has never come up
as an issue at election time.
The self-criticism of the continent‚Äôs heav y-
we i g h t , South A f ri c a , has had quite an impact. P r e-
sident Thabo Mbeki publicly admitted when he
launched the Partnership Against Aids project on
October 9, 1998,that ‚Äúfor too long we have closed
our eyes as a nation, hoping that it was not really
true‚Äù, while ‚Äúevery day another 1,500 South Afri-
cans were infected in South A f ri c a .‚Äù He appealed to
young people and to the population at large to use
condoms.
A campaign will obviously not work unless the
b attle against Aids is a top pri o rity for gove rn m e n t s
and gi ven ongoing at t e n t i o n .This has happened
in Uganda which has been the most successful A f ri-
can country in terms of Aids prevention.The ini-
t i at i ve for the all-out battle came from President
Yowe ri Musewe n i , who understood the extent of
the disease from the day he came to power in 1986:
out of about 60 army officers sent for military trai-
ning in Cuba,where Aids tests are compulsory, 20
were HIV- p o s i t i ve .Without further ado, he ear-
marked funds for a large-scale national prevention
c a m p a i g n . Uganda has since made considerable
g a i n s. For example, b e t ween 1989 and 1995, t h e
p r o p o rtion of teenage girls (between 15 and 19)
who remained virgins increased from 26 per cent
to 46 per cent.They had the courage to refuse sexual
relations.
In Senegal, p r e vention has also been boosted by

t o p - l e vel political decisions, with clear results. I n
1998, the government of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire earmarked
$1.6 million for a prevention campaign and recently
the president set up a nationwide fund,containing
an equal sum for taking care of the ill.This repre-
sents a huge amount of money in Africa.
B i l ateral and multilateral aid agencies are more
likely to help countries which make their own fin a n-
cial commitments to preve n t i o n .B e yond that ,i n t e r-
n ational organizations like UNAIDS,WHO and
UNESCO can and must convince African leaders of
the extent of the problem. In 1996, the countries of
A f rica as a whole, except for Botswa n a , K e nya ,
M a l awi and Uganda, spent less than $1 million each
on Aids prevention.
S p i ritual leaders and traditional chiefs, w i d e l y
respected and obeyed across the continent, r e p r e-
sent another key set of actors. Since the epidemic
s t a rt e d , r e l i gion has hindered rather than helped
the fight against A i d s. A devout Catholic will not
use a condom if he is told it is a sin,any more than
a Muslim will if the imam does not even deign to
talk to him about Aids.
The lessons learned from a conference on
Aids held in Dakar (Senegal) in 1997 are revea-
ling. About 300 participants from Africa, Europe
and the Middle East, represented the two main
r e l i gions of those regions‚ÄîIslam and
Christianity. Just getting people together to talk
about such a delicate topic was an achievement.
After some stormy discussions, everyone agreed
that Aids was a disease and had to be viewed in
strictly medical terms. If it did not remove all the
obstacles to prevention campaigns, the conferen-
ce at least managed to persuade participants to
stop opposing the mere idea of them. Across the
continent, religious leaders are now starting to
join the fight against Aids‚Äîfor example, Caritas
International, one of the world‚Äôs biggest networks
of NGOs, as well as the group Christians and
Aids and Uganda‚Äôs Islamic Medical Association
(see p. 33) have become involved.
With doctors powerless to cure or effectively
treat the disease, people are turning to the sym-
bolic authority of the ancestors, embodied by tra-
ditional chiefs. They are directly concerned by
preventive education because some customs run
the risk of spreading Aids‚Äîsuch as marrying the
sister of one‚Äôs late wife or the brother of one‚Äôs
dead husband and taking part in certain ceremo-
nies which involve washing the dead.There is an
alternative to every custom, as long as the head of
the family accepts it. If the traditional chiefs were
to decide to do more to help prevention, they
could speed up the process of changing certain
practices.
Risky customs
Equally formidable are the traditional healers
and practitioners , who have a leading part to play
since most A f ricans consult them. N i g e ria has
700,000 such healers but only 20,000 doctors for
120 million inhabitants. I nvolving the healers in the
fight against Aids not only draws on their prestige
but also lessens the harm they can do: namely by
admitting the disease exists and claiming they can
heal it.Va rious projects have targeted healers by pro-
viding them with training and instilling them with
a gr e ater sense of responsibility. For example, i n
1995-96 the Aids Fo u n d ation of South A f rica was in
contact with about half a million healers and 650
a s s o c i at i o n s , all of which admitted that even if they
could sometimes treat the symptoms, they could
not cure the disease. Before that , 75 per cent of
them said the opposite.
The Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers
Association, with 50,000 members, has over the
past decade run about 500 workshops which deal
with all social groups (teenagers, polygamous
families, healers, traditional chiefs) as well as
members of parliament. The aim is to make
people aware of the dangers involved in traditio-
nal rites such as circumcision, female excision
and cures involving incision.
P r e ve n t i ve education in A f rica remains the
only way of combating A i d s , but prevention must
not exclude medical treat m e n t .A f ricans cannot be
told forever that ‚Äúmedicine is for others bu t
condoms are for yo u ‚Äù . There is no underestima-
ting the importance of a French initiat i ve in May
1 9 9 8 , which was favourably received by the G8
(Group of Eight Industrialized Nat i o n s ) , and led
to the creation of the Intern ational T h e r a p e u t i c
S o l i d a rity Fund. S u p p o rted by rich countri e s , t h e
fund aims to make anti-Aids drug treat m e n t s
more available in developing countri e s. B e t t e r
access to treatment will not only help save pat i e n t s
but reinforce prevention effort s. E x p e rience has
s h own that infected people with no hope of treat-
ment are more likely to have unprotected sex than
those with medical support . n

Getting youth through the Aids crisis
A fter she heard from a cousin in Ouagadougou
(Burkina Faso) about the dangers of cat c h i n g
A i d s , one of Konat √© ‚Äôs two wives asked him to
wear a condom. The dismayed Konat√© told his
f riends about the request and they made fun of him.
His pride was so wounded that he became impotent
and even his mistress couldn‚Äôt solve the problem.
E ventually the village witch-doctor interve n e d
and told Konat√© his only hope was to say a prayer at
the foot of the tree on which the ‚Äú t h i n g ‚Äù ( t h e
condom) supposedly gr e w. So Konat√© went off to
look for the tree.
The film K o n at √© ‚Äôs T h i n g, which came out this
ye a r , tackles Aids prevention in a light-hearted way,
by laughing at male sexual pride and odd customs.
Fanta Regina Nacro, the fil m ‚Äôs 36-ye a r - o l d
Burkinab√© director,explains her approach:
Why did you use humour to handle such a
distressing topic?
Being alarmist about Aids wo u l d n ‚Äôt have helped
m u c h . People run away from painful images. B u t
we all like recalling funny episodes.
As an A f rican wo m a n , I‚Äôm particularly concer-
ned about A i d s. I wanted to use the wonderful means
of communication I had‚Äîfilm‚Äîto help prevent the
d i s e a s e . I know how my people think and it wo u l d n ‚Äôt

t o ry way ‚Äú Wear a condom!‚ÄùThe whole weight of tra-
dition would have come down on me.So I took ano-

Fighting prejudice with laughter, film director Fanta Regina Nacro 
gets a strong message acro s s
ther tack.Through laughter, you can fight prejudice
more easily.
You raise a number of questions yet you don‚Äôt deal
directly with young people even though they have
been hit the hardest by the epidemic.
I‚Äôm the first to admit this.But try and tell that to the
N ational Centre for Aids Preve n t i o n . I was told that
it would be ‚Äú d r a g ging them down into debauchery.‚Äù
They were so insistent that I gave up.The issue reeks
of hy p o c ri s y. Health offic i a l s , community organiza-
t i o n s ,e ve ryone invo l ved in the fight against A i d s ,t h e y
all avoid talking about and to young people. Fo rt u n a-
tely children are present during awareness campaigns
in the villages and no one chases them away. So they
l e a rn how to use condoms, just as they can if they see
my fil m .
We don‚Äôt have the right to leave children in the
dark about A i d s. Right now, I‚Äôm trying to get the
film more widely distri buted so most young people
in Burkina Faso can see it. I t ‚Äôs been shown on nat i o-
nal television but not eve ryo n e ‚Äôs got a TV set.A tra-
velling cinema is in the wo r k s , along with public pre-
sentations and discussions to be held in provincial
towns and villages.
How do you gauge your success?
In A f rican countri e s , where there aren‚Äôt any ve n-
ding machines for contraceptive s ,p e o p l e ‚Äî e s p e c i a l l y
young people‚Äîdon‚Äôt dare to go and buy them.We
d e c i d e d , as part of a promotion campaign, to either
hand out a free box of contraceptives or the equiva-
lent of one dollar.When a fa rm - worker was handed a
b ox of condoms, he was visibly delighted.When he
was gi ven money, he was gr ateful but nothing more.
With a dollar,he could buy five boxes but he wo u l d n ‚Äôt
dare do so.
Since the film has been shown in Burkina Fa s o,
kids have been asking in the market simply for
‚Äú K o n at √© ‚Äôs thing‚Äù and that ‚Äôs what they get. T h i s
a c h i e vement is much more important to me than
any prize the film has won.

‚ÄúYou could see the bones sticking out under

Amadou Sow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd had Aids for 12 years
when I decided to see the m a l a n go h e a l e rs. M a l a n go
means ‚Äò w h at is needed and is suitable.‚Äô I came back
feeling better. Since then, I have recovered my sight
and gained we i g h t .‚ÄùWhile Sow is a ‚Äú m i r a c u l o u s ‚Äù5 0
years or so old,he knows that he is not completely
cured of Aids.
In Senegal‚Äôs Fatick region, 150 kilometres
from the capital,Dakar,the Malango Association,
founded in 1983, has 450 members who are tra-
ditional healers (a fifth of them women) and work
in 264 villages. Starting from the belief that natu-
re has a cure for every ailment, they use mainly
powders, potions and plant extracts. But invoking
the spirits is also part of traditional therapy. In the
animist view of the world,humans are considered
a link in the cosmic chain who summon the lower
orders (minerals, plants and animals) to join the
higher ones (spirits, ancestors and gods). All of
them must be called on in the hope of finding
cures.
Unlike many of their counterp a rts in other
countries, the association‚Äôs healers don‚Äôt promise
their patients they will be cured of Aids.They suc-
cessfully treat some of the symptoms (diarr h o e a ,
vomiting and leukaemia) and ease sufferi n g .W h e n
the treatment is ineffective , they steer their pat i e n t s
towards health practitioners who work with them.
So far they have treated more than 10,000 people
from A f rica (including Senegal), Europe and the
United States.
The first stop
on the road
Three quarters of all Senegalese go to traditio-
nal healers. ‚ÄúIn some areas, there‚Äôs one doctor for
e ve ry 100,000 people and one traditional healer
for eve ry 1,000,‚Äù s ays Dr. E rick Gbodoussou, h e a d
of the Malango Association‚Äôs experimental centre.
Gbodoussou trained in We s t e rn medical schools
but is convinced traditional healers can not only
effectively fight some diseases, but can also play a
useful role in prevention.‚ÄúWhen I treat someone
with Aids,I discourage them from having sex with
their part n e rs ,‚Äù s ays one of the associat i o n ‚Äôs healers ,
a man in his 70s. ‚ÄúI tell them they can infect their
partners if they don‚Äôt do what I say.‚Äù
w Journalist with Sud
Quotidien,Dakar (Senegal)
In Dakar‚Äôs Til√®ne market, traditional healers
have been interested in helping to raise awareness
about the disease.‚ÄúAids exists and we have to dis-
cuss it with young people who are sexually acti-
ve,‚Äù says Ibra Niokhobaye Diouf. Do the ill
people dare talk about their sex lives? ‚ÄúTen out of
the average 15 patients I see each day raise the
subject openly,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI use each occasion to
make them understand they have to protect
themselves from this disease that everyone talks
about so much.‚Äù With more healers like Diouf,
the message about Aids reaches the whole popu-
lation by word of mouth.
In the village of Samb√©, in the Diourbel
region,healers attended seminars on Aids in 1998
organized by the NGOs Enda Tiers-Monde and
Ndef Leng (‚Äúact together‚Äù).The seminars featu-
red information workshops, debates and docu-
mentary films which convinced them of the pre-
vention campaign‚Äôs worth. Unfortunately, there
were only 35 healers present.‚ÄúHealers aren‚Äôt very
e f ficiently used in awareness campaigns, ye t
they‚Äôre our first stop on the road,‚Äù says Dr.
Moustapha Gu√®ye, of Enda Tiers-Monde. In our
talks, African traditional structures always have
pride of place. It‚Äôs time to make use of them.‚Äù
The intern ational conference on traditional
medicine and HIV/Aids, held in Dakar in March
1 9 9 9 , c o n firmed the key role of the healers. T h e
c o n f e r e n c e , organized by Prometra (a Senegalese
NGO which promotes traditional medicine) and
sponsored by a dozen intern ational organizat i o n s ,
attracted about 200 healers and 250 doctors and
s c i e n t i s t s , as well as political decision-makers ,j o u r-
nalists and people living with HIV and Aids from
about 30 countries around the globe. At the end of
the discussions, the traditional healers were inv i t e d
to take part in UNAIDS programmes and at t e n d
the next world conference on A i d s , in Durban
(South A f rica) in July 2000. n

While the region increasingly taps the media‚Äôs potential to spread the message on
Aids pre v e n t i o n , t raditional taboos continue to hamper the educational pro g ra m m e s
2 Southeast A s i a
MTV Asia is currently broadcasting an excel-
lent HIV- p r e vention campaign. S avvy and
m o d e rn ,M T V ‚Äôs commercial efforts reach
a f fluent youth in major cities.The music love rs who
see MTV‚Äôs HIV education spots have the means to
afford condoms and protect themselve s.These yo u n g
people include many of the future leaders of A s i a ‚Äôs
next generat i o n .
But the majority of youth in the Mekong regi o n
‚Äî young agricultural wo r k e rs in rural areas,newly arri-
ved fa c t o ry wo r k e rs in big cities, d ay labourers on
c o n s t ruction sites and others ‚Äî d o n ‚Äôt have access to
M T V ‚Äôs message. Much of the HIV and Aids educa-
tion aimed at youth takes place in schools,but it usually
only begins after the sixth gr a d e . A large number of
young people have already left school by this age. I n
C a m b o d i a , for instance, only 40 per cent of children
continue their education after their sixth ye a r.
Throughout the regi o n , traditions still act as a
sizeable obstacle to effective HIV/Aids prevention pro-
gr a m m e s. Sexual education is not considered a part
of the natural process of gr owing up.Parents still gr e at l y
i n fluence their children‚Äôs choice of marriage part n e rs.
In countries like Cambodia and Mya n m a r ,a rr a n g e d
m a rriage is often practiced. P r e - m a rital sex for ‚Äú g o o d ‚Äù
women is considered scandalous. Couples often do
not dat e , and thus, sexual negotiation doesn‚Äôt begi n
until well into the marital relat i o n s h i p, if eve r.
Scare tactics
As in many countri e s ,t e a c h e rs and students in the
r e gion often have trouble discussing sexual issues in
the classroom.Teacher trainers , who help teachers
l e a rn to discuss sex with their students, often find that
these adults have never touched a condom before and
are frequently embarrassed while giving the lessons.
Most grew up in an environment in which sex wa s
n e ver discussed. O f t e n , the task of conducting sessions
on condom education is left up to NGOs. Pa rt l y
because of the traditional difficulty of talking openly
about sexual issues, m a ny of the education pro-
grammes have focused on scare tactics: if you have sex
or inject drugs you will get Aids and die.Youth can
often list what is considered appropri ate and inap-
p r o p ri ate behav i o u r ,but this knowledge doesn‚Äôt alway s
change how they act.Traditional taboos have fil t e r e d
into the formal and non-formal health education sys-
t e m s , and affect how gove rnments and societies at
large perceive sexuality and HIV. For instance,
condoms were illegal in Myanmar until 1992. In some
c o u n t ri e s , a woman carrying one would be conside-
red a prostitute by many members of her community,
including the police.
E f f e c t i ve youth education programmes need to
equip young people with the skills and know l e d g e
to effectively negotiate their sexual behav i o u r. S u c h
programmes must start out by listening to the stu-
d e n t s , finding out about the reality of their sexual
l i ve s , and helping them to deal with these situat i o n s.
The reality is that throughout Southeast Asia there
h ave been fairly profound changes in sexual morals
and social behav i o u r: for instance, young couples
are now more likely to hold hands than 20 ye a rs ago.

now often left to the young themselves. Advertise-
ments show a life in which an acknowledgment of
sexuality is the social norm.
S t i l l ,m a ny traditional attitudes towards sexuality
p r e vail and some have a particularly high cost. B e c a u s e
female virginity is highly prized in some countri e s ,i t
is considered acceptable for young men to visit pros-
t i t u t e s.The sex trade has been a major cause of the
spread of Aids in the regi o n . In T h a i l a n d , there are
n ow more men infected with HIV than wo m e n , bu t
the ratio is expected to be even by 2005. Fo rt y - f o u r
per cent of the prostitutes in the nort h e rn region of
Thailand are thought to be HIV- p o s i t i ve . In Cambo-
d i a ,t h at figure is over 60 per cent in some areas.
Dealing with prostitution
In Cambodia, they start at 13, or even yo u n g e r.
M a ny sex customers delude themselves by thinking
t h at they are less likely to contract HIV from the yo u n g .
By UN standards, 80 per cent of the sex wo r k e rs in
Cambodia are yo u t h . In other countri e s ,m a ny yo u n g
hill tribe women have ended up in the sex industry.
And this trade continues to gr ow.
M a ny gove rnments have tried to deal realisti-
cally with the prostitution issue. For example, C a m-
bodia and Thailand have supplied condoms in bro-
t h e l s. This is an important measure, when yo u
consider that the yo u n g, less well-off men who drop
out of school before being taught about HIV- p r e-
vention and reproductive health, are among those
who may feel they can‚Äôt afford a condom. But not
all condoms are free. Pove rt y, especially among
yo u t h ,p l ays a major role in the spread of the viru s.
W h at appears to be a cheap price for a condom to an
office worker in Bangkok, m ay be prohibitive l y
e x p e n s i ve to a bicycle tire repairman in a village.A s
m a ny A f rican programmes have show n , money for
e d u c ation and prevention in all form s , from all sec-
t o rs , is a key factor in fighting the spread of the viru s.
Because so many young people in Southeast A s i a
are beyond the reach of traditional HIV/Aids educa-
tion progr a m m e s ,m a ny of the most successful ones
h ave invo l ved peer group talks.These might take place
in the wo r k p l a c e ,i n f o rmally at someone‚Äôs home,
d u ring youth festiva l s , vo c ational training pro-
grammes or via other community activities. Pe e r - t o -
peer education invo l ves not just discussing Aids and
the peer pressures involving sex, but includes talking
about eve ry t h i n g, helping young people gain life skills
to negotiate all the issues in their live s.
The local media that may reach the majority of
the less-educated population make an import a n t
contribution to forming people‚Äôs attitudes to HIV.
Soap operas have been a successful medium for
spreading the HIV message in Viet Nam. A non-
g ove rnmental organization in Cambodia sponso-
red a boat tour along the Mekong to produce a video
about an HIV- p o s i t i ve Cambodian soldier retur-
ning home. Because it was well-made and captured
the audience‚Äôs interest, the video was an extremely
e f f e c t i ve education tool and was seen by ove r
100,000 in the space of three months.
To counter gi ven the many negat i ve represen-
t ations of Aids victims in T h a i l a n d , a group of NGOs
has commissioned a series of portraits of yo u n g
people with HIV. Professional photogr a p h e rs ,m a ny
of whom have worked with fashion magazines, h ave
d o n ated their services to help young people see that
these individuals are as beautiful, and as full of life,
as everyone else.
The epidemic, which disproport i o n ately affects
young people, must be seen as a socio-economic
and a development problem by gove rnments and
society at large. Unless there is a rapid and effective
r e s p o n s e , it is foreseeable that Aids will curb the
economic gr owth of the region in the ye a rs to come.
It is imperat i ve that development plans incorp o r at e
an HIV/Aids pers p e c t i ve , and all the more so when
dealing specifically with programmes targeting the
region‚Äôs youth. n

‚ÄúCondom Night‚Äù in Bangkok.
A survey conducted in Thailand for the British
c o n t r a c e p t i ve firm Durex, published in
December 1998, showed that 60 per cent of
those questioned used condoms. Polls taken by
UNAIDS among 21-year-old Thai men found that use
of condoms in brothels in northern Thailand rose
from 61 per cent to 93 per cent between 1991 and
1995, while the number of customers fell by half.
Such changes in sexual behaviour are two solid
results of  T h a i l a n d ‚Äôs large-scale effort to fight A i d s.
Even before the first case was detected in Thailand in
1 9 8 4 , Mechai V i r ava i d ya (‚ÄúMr. C o n d o m ‚Äù ) , a fa m i l y
planning pioneer and founder of the Population and
Community Development A s s o c i at i o n , was publicly
s i n ging the praises of condoms. At first he was accused
of tarnishing the country ‚Äôs image, but then he wa s
c o n gr at u l ated for his major contri bution to halting the
spread of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) and
Aids.
Non-governmental organizations were the first to
support his work but were quickly overwhelmed.The
rapid spread of such diseases spurred the government
to launch a broad mobilization campaign. In 1992, it
announced a three-year plan to monitor and fight A i d s.
By 1996,the plan‚Äôs budget had risen to $82.3 million,
an initiative unmatched in any other country.
Coordinated by the ministry of health, preventive
e d u c ation was gradually taken over by civil society as a
w h o l e . By 1990, e ven before the plan was launched,
television had become the chief source of inform at i o n ,
with the broadcasting of expensive advertising spots.
Rural communities set up solidarity funds and Bud-
dhist monks opened their temples to ill people
rejected by their families.The religious association
Sangha Metta, based at the Buddhist Unive rsity of
M a h a m a k u t , at Chiang Mai, has so far trained more
than 500 monks and nuns to work in preve n t i o n
and treatment.
In most towns, people with Aids or HIV took
a c t i o n . The New Life Friends associat i o n , set up
in 1993, has several hundred members and is doing
an impressive job of raising awa r e n e s s , e s p e c i a l l y
in schools. M a ny members are now teaching classes
about the disease.
Complacency 
and budget cuts
From the early 1990s, clinics specializing in
t r e ating STDs, whose patients were mostly wo r-
king in the sex industry, generously handed out free
condoms and pushed brothel ow n e rs to encourage
their use.This programme,launched on a national
scale in 1991 and known as the ‚Äú100 per cent
Condom Campaign‚Äù is the key to Thailand‚Äôs suc-
c e s s , according to W i wat Rochapichaya k h o n , t h e
UNAIDS director for the Asia-Pacific region.
But prevention has flagged for the past two
years for several reasons. Rochapichayakhon says
people have taken for granted the progress and
h ave become complacent. The head of the
European Union‚Äôs Aids programme in Thailand,
Alessio Panza, blames a new policy of targeting
specific groups rather than conducting a mass
campaign. The chief of the Aids department in
the Thai health ministry, Chaiyos Kunanusont,
claims that the economic and financial crisis that
erupted in 1997 is responsible. The budget to
prevent the disease has been cut by a quarter, he
complains.
The effect of the economic crisis on the epide-
mic is unclear.Will the newly-unemployed end up
working in the brothels of Patpong and Pat t aya? Or
will the falling standard of living mean fewer cus-
tomers and so less demand for new sex workers?
One thing is cert a i n : the thousands of people retur-
ning to the countryside after losing their jobs in the
t owns are already causing sexual health problems in
the north and northeast of Thailand. n
HIV/Aids 
in T h a i l a n d
Out of a population
of 59 million,
780,000 people live
with HIV/Aids. Among
adults in the 15-to-49
age group, 2.23% are
HIV-infected,as are
14,000 children under
the age of 15. The
epidemic has so far
claimed a total of
230,000 lives.

topic is delicate and all the harder to handle with precious few re s o u rc e s

additional contributions from
Nathalie Barboza (UNESCO Dakar);

with the UNESCO office in New
Delhi (India).
Ed u c ating schoolchildren about Aids is some-
thing ve ry recent in developing countri e s ‚Äî
when it happens at all. M a ny politicians, s c h o o l
p rincipals and teachers are trapped by sexual taboos
and believe Aids education encourages young people
to have sex. Only in 1997 did a report by UN A I D S
(entitled E f fects of sex education on young people‚Äôs
sexual behav i o u r) come out showing there was no
such danger at all.
The situation is finally beginning to change.
M a ny developing countries have now taken the
plunge and Aids education is part of their school
c u rri c u l a .S o m e t i m e s , subterfuges have to be used.
I n d o n e s i a , a Muslim country, has chosen to talk
about ‚Äúreproductive health education‚Äù instead of
sex education.Many countries have followed suit.
Senegal‚Äôs pioneering 
programmes
In West and Central Africa,the subject is tack-
led in ‚Äúfamily life and population education‚Äù pro-
grammes which offer a multi-disciplinary mix of
b i o l o g y, home economics and health, civic and
moral educat i o n .H owe ve r ,d i f ficulties lie not just in
devising programmes but also in teaching them
e f f e c t i ve l y. In most countri e s , the programmes have
not yet been endorsed by the government.
Senegal is a pioneer in the field and family educa-
tion is even taught in pri m a ry schools there. S i n c e
1 9 9 4 , a Senegalese NGO, Group for Research and
D e velopment on Po p u l ation and Education (GE E P)
has set up 140 family education clubs, i nvolving 52
per cent of the country ‚Äôs secondary schools. In 1997,
three such clubs were started at Dakar Unive rs i t y.
So far more than 2,000 pupils, a third of them
gi r l s , h ave completed training as group leaders.
Their job is to make their fellow students, as well as
young people not in school, aware of Aids through
cultural day s , fa i rs and holiday camp activities.Te a-
c h e rs help them by looking after administrat i ve
m at t e rs. D u ring the 1997-98 school ye a r , their wo r k
involved about 45,000 young people,representing
32 per cent of all secondary school students.
In A s i a , the situation va ries widely from coun-
t ry to country.T h a i l a n d ,C a m b o d i a ,L a o s ,Viet Nam
and Sri Lanka have well-established prevention pro-
grammes which are part of formal educat i o n ,w h i l e
Nepal, Pakistan,Bangladesh and the Maldives are
only just getting start e d . In India, an Aids awa r e-
ness campaign is supposed to be part of phy s i c a l
e d u c ation and courses in ‚Äúsocial useful productive
wo r k ‚Äù . But often teachers do not even know such
p r o grammes exist, so they have to make do by them-
s e l ve s. In the most remote parts of India and elsew-
h e r e , t e a c h e rs with little knowledge of Aids are
expected to initiate an open discussion about sexua-
lity with classes of 50 to 80 pupils without the help
of books on the subject.This is asking too much.
Teachers: overcoming
their own inhibitions
‚ÄúOne of my students asked me a question about
Aids which I just didn‚Äôt know how to answe r , so I said
it wa s n ‚Äôt the subject we were dealing with,‚Äù a d m i t t e d

( Togo) in A p ril 1999. ‚ÄúBut I had the feeling it wa s

and I fear he wo n ‚Äôt dare ask it again.‚Äù

### Prevention at school: an arduous course
October 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 31
Getting youth through the Aids crisis
Togo are focusing on secondary school teachers.
The other countries have made little headway.
Te a c h e rs also need to have access to interactive
teaching methods so they can create an at m o s p h e r e
of confidence to encourage young people to voice their
c o n c e rns and learn to protect themselve s. But tea-
ching mat e rials are seriously lacking.At the begi n n i n g
of the 1990s, UN E S C O and the World Health Organi-
z ation (WHO) published some manuals for school
c u rriculum planners suggesting activities for pupils
and how teachers might approach the subject (see
b ox ) .S e veral thousand of these well-produced guides
were pri n t e d , but there are 55 million teachers in the
wo r l d . More recently,Togo put out a brochure for
s c h o o l c h i l d r e n , but it was distri buted only pri vat e l y.
Reach children 
when they‚Äôre young
Even when appropriate tools are available,tea-
chers do not always make use of them.Experience
shows that young teachers,who adapt much more
easily to new approaches, are the ones to rely on.
As a ru l e , nobody is really prepared to talk to yo u n g
people about sex.Parents do not feel up to the job
and pass it on to the teachers who in turn pass it
back to the family or the church.This is especially
so in majori t y - C atholic countri e s , mainly in Lat i n
A m e ri c a , where condoms are still sometimes regar-
ded as ‚Äúan instrument of the devil.‚Äù S u rveys by
UNAIDS show that when young people are we l l -
i n f o rmed about the disease, they protect themselve s
more effectively than adults. In Chile, Brazil and
Mexico, boys between 15 and 18 are the most fre-
quent users of condoms.
But education authorities still balk at preve n t i o n
p r o grammes and do not like to recognize that yo u n g
people are sexually active .E ven though premari t a l
sex is frowned upon, it is common among teenagers ,
who change part n e rs more often than adults.This is
w hy about half the new cases of infection are found
among people between 15 and 24. So they must be
wa rned about Aids as early as possible.
The ideal age to start preve n t i ve education is
about seve n , according to expert s. Children of that
age do not have inhibitions, express themselve s
openly at school and freely pass on what they learn
to the rest of their family and are thus excellent
agents of communicat i o n . It is too late to begi n
introducing this education in secondary school
because between a quarter and a half of all school-
children in developing countries drop out of school
after five ye a rs. P r o grammes outside school are the-
refore vital to combat A i d s. There are some, bu t
not enough progr a m m e s , which mainly reach chil-
dren in big towns.
So there is a great deal of work to be done.But
people are clearly becoming aware of the problem.
After two decades of silence, the issue of Aids has
finally reached the horizon of the classroom. n
UN E S C O
and Aids education
S et up in 1987, UNESCO‚Äôs Section for Preventive Edu-
cation aims to develop responsible attitudes and
behaviour at individual and community levels using edu-
cational strategies.The goal is to enhance national capa-
cities to implement effective educational programmes.Th i s
can mean implementing pilot projects, providing exper-
t i s e, and organizing conferences and teacher training
w o r k s h o p s. It assists in launching international cam-
paigns aimed at youth in collaboration with civil society,
promoting peer education,creative teaching and publi-
shing guides for teachers and educational materials.
The Unit of Cultural Research and Management‚Äôs
project originated in the UNAIDS Coordinated Appeal for
1998-1999.Its basic concern is to understand and take
into account people‚Äôs cultures in the broadest sense
when developing preventive actions against HIV/Aids.
The World Foundation for Aids Research and Preven-
tion was established in 1993 by UN E S C O D i r e c t o r- G e n e r a l
Federico Mayor and Professor Luc Montagnier, c o - d i s c o-
verer of the HIV virus. The goal of the foundation is to
mobilize all kinds of private initiatives, to create new
partnerships and find novel forms of co-operation, e s p e-
cially in research and prevention, in order to support and
continue actions against Aids taken by public authorities.

### A crash course for teachers
32 The UNESCO Courier - October 1999
At the school in Mujina, a couple of hours by
road from the Rwandan capital of Kigali, t h e
t e a c h e rs have gathered for a day of instru c-
tion about Aids organized by the NGO E n fants r√©fu-
gi√©s du monde.They all admit to being confused:
w h at can we do? they ask.Their pupils start hav i n g
sex quite early on‚Äîaround 16 for boy s , but much
e a r l i e r , from about 12 and up for gi r l s , who are often
pestered and harassed by adults.The teachers all
a gree that the school is ideally situated to reach
young people in efforts to prevent the spread of the
d i s e a s e . But how exactly can they get the message
across to their pupils? 
The curriculum officially includes lessons about
Aids and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), bu t
t e a c h e rs have not been taught how to tackle these sub-
j e c t s.They don‚Äôt have books or other written mat e-
ri a l , their own knowledge is limited and mainly obtai-
ned from the radio. Their mother tongue lacks
euphemisms for sexual mat t e rs.And even the most
energetic teachers shy away from the subject for fear
of being accused by parents of corrupting the minds of
their children.
An ‚Äòinternal army‚Äô
‚ÄúAs a result,‚Äùs ays a pri m a ry school inspector,‚Äú m o s t
of them just don‚Äôt teach the classes they‚Äôre supposed
t o.‚ÄùAccording to one female teacher,‚Äú i t ‚Äôs impossible in
R wanda to talk about sex with children under 12.‚Äù
A team from the Rwandan Child to Child pro-
gramme gi ves a one-day crash course on a teaching
method by which children learn to be more concer-
ned about their own health and that of others.T h e
training aims to equip the teachers with inform at i o n
about Aids and techniques for tackling the subject.
Right from the start,the team reminds partici-
pants that A i d s , unlike any other sexually transmit-
ted disease, is a blood disease, not one directly affec-
ting sexual organs. From this angle, t e a c h e rs can
handle the matter more calmly, like any other infec-
t i o n .The problem is that many teachers are unclear
about the va rious functions of blood.With malari a
widespread in the regi o n , they know that red blood
cells carry ox y g e n , but they are less familiar with
white ones or with problems of the immune system.

Before looking at how the virus enters the human

But making a life-size model of the female genitals,

### Uganda: a jihad against AIDS
October 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 33
Getting youth through the Aids crisis
U g a n d a : a j i h a d against A i d s
w Maggie Keenan W h e e l e r
In informal schools tied to mosques, Muslim religious leaders have taken on a pivotal role in
teaching youth the basics of pre v e n t i o n
Mohammed Mubiru admits that Aids is a
topic he has never discussed with his
p a r e n t s.‚ÄúThey would think I was being dis-
r e s p e c t f u l ,‚Äù he say s. So where did Mubiru , a teena-
ger, learn about the disease? 
In an innovat i ve project launched by the Isla-
mic Medical A s s o c i ation of Uganda (IMAU ) , yo u t h
in Mpigi (50 km southwest of Kampala) and Kamuli
D i s t ricts (140 km northeast of the capital) are lear-
ning about Aids at Madarasa schools associated with
the mosques in their villages.These schools are open
on weekends to teach Muslim children the A r a b i c
language and principles of Islamic culture and beha-
v i o u r. Muslims account for about 16 per cent of
U g a n d a ‚Äôs 20 million people. In 1989, the country ‚Äôs
highest Muslim authority declared a jihad (holy
war) on A i d s ,p aving the way for the Madarasa A i d s
Education and Prevention project.
In a 36-lesson curriculum developed by the
Ugandan Ministry of Health and the United
N ations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), youth in the
Madarasa schools learn about HIV/Aids transmis-
s i o n ,p r e vention and control during 40-minute ses-
s i o n s.The curriculum was recently enriched with a
life skills component to equip youth with some of
the tools they need for building self-esteem and
coping with va rious challenges of gr owing up.To p i c s
include resisting peer pressure,c o m m u n i c ation skills
and being assert i ve : ‚ÄúIf a girl is asked by a man to
h ave sex, she needs to know how to say no and mean
n o,‚Äù insists Neema Nakya n j o, I M AU ‚Äôs project offi-
c e r. He helps to train county sheikhs, imams and
their assistants to use the curri c u l u m .These trai-
n e e s , i n - t u rn , s u p e rvise the training of vo l u n t e e r
Madarasa teachers at mosques in their area. Since its
launch in 1995, the programme has reached more
than 36,000 children in 350 schools.
‚ÄúIt is challenging to introduce the topic of A i d s ,
but children need to know,‚Äù s ays Imam Hassan
Magola from Bukulube Mosque.The project under-
lines that certain traditional Muslim practices 
can increase the risk of exposure to the HIV 
v i ru s , namely male circumcision with unsteri l e
i n s t ruments and ablution of the dead without pro-
t e c t i ve glove s. Introducing the topic of condoms
h owe ver proved to be the single gr e atest hurdle. I n
the first ye a r , the issue was removed from the cur-
riculum after some religious leaders argued that
recommending use of condoms would promote sex
outside marri a g e . O ver a ye a r , I M AU held a dia-
logue with Islamic leaders to work through their
c o n c e rn s , stressing that the condom was only being
promoted as protection after the failure of the first
t wo lines of defence: abstaining from sex and hav i n g
sex only within marri a g e . As IMAU argued, gi r l s
do become pregnant before marriage and there are
m a ny cases of sexually transmitted disease among
the unmarri e d . Islamic leaders eventually agr e e d
t h at education on the responsible use of condoms
was acceptable and the topic was reinserted in the
curriculum in the second year.
N ow, the project‚Äôs main struggle is with funding.
UNICEF has contri buted $35,000 to the project
since its launch while parents are encouraged to gi ve
the Madarasa teacher 100 Ugandan shillings per
session (less than 10 cents) and have repeat e d l y
expressed their support for the project. G r ow i n g
n u m b e rs of non-Muslim parents are seeking to enrol
their children in the Madarasa Aids classes.W h at ‚Äôs
clear is that students feel able to talk more openly
about the subject.‚ÄúWhen I see someone with A i d s ,
I know what they are going through and I sympa-
t h i z e ,‚Äù s ays one student. ‚ÄúI have learned that A i d s
is a reality and I live in fear of it.‚Äù n

### Reaching street kids on their own turf
R e a c h i n g s t reet kids on their
own turf
w Guillermina Nava r r o
Born in Mexico City, Latin A m e r i c a ‚Äôs only Aids 
p revention pro g ramme for street children is ready to 
s h a re its expertise with other countries in the re g i o n
The street is their home. For several thousand
young Mexicans, it is the place where they play,
e at , sleep and when they can, wo r k . For many,
the sex trade is the only way of earning a few pesos.
It is also the most likely way that they will become
infected with HIV.In a few ye a rs time, m a ny of them
will succumb to Aids.
Finding suitable ways to prevent Aids is no
simple task, and even less so when street children
are concern e d . ‚ÄúThey are anxious, unstable and
sometimes aggr e s s i ve ,‚Äù s ays psychologist Gualbert o
G at i c a . To help tackle the problem, the NGO Casa
A l i a n z a , which has been working in Mexico since
1 9 8 6 , launched its Luna (‚ÄúMoon‚Äù) programme two
ye a rs ago. It is the only Aids prevention campaign
in Latin America designed especially for homeless
children.
Distorted 
knowledge
Luna, a name the infected children conjured
up to evoke light amid darkness, is currently
monitoring 6,180 children and teenagers. Besides
being present on the preventive front, the pro-
gramme also keeps a close check on HIV-positive
children, provides medical treatment for youth
with Aids and psychological counselling for their
friends.
‚ÄúSince 1997, the number of infected children
has ri s e n , so we ‚Äôre focusing on preve n t i o n ,‚Äù
explains Nicasio Garcia Lopez, the programme‚Äôs
coordinator. ‚ÄúStreet children usually know about
sex and Aids, but it‚Äôs often distorted knowledge.
Hence the importance of effective prevention.‚Äù
Vo l u n t e e rs and teachers from Casa A l i a n z a
comb the capital‚Äôs neighbourhoods eve ry day to
p e rsuade boys and girls to go to the organizat i o n ‚Äôs
‚Äú s h e l t e r ‚Äù where they can attend an hour-long
workshop twice a week called ‚Äú H I V / A i d s ‚Äî W h at
is it?‚Äù.With the help of simple, colourful teaching
m at e ri a l s , they learn how the disease spreads and
h ow to protect themselves against it. M a ny chil-
dren are also reached directly on their home
ground‚Äîthe street.When they go around the city,
Casa A l i a n z a ‚Äôs teachers carry games with them
t h at can be set up any w h e r e , all based on ques-
tions and answe rs. A game of darts for example.
Depending on where the children land the dart s
on the board, they must answer different ques-
t i o n s. A n o t h e r , called Marat h o n , is based on an
athletics race. The most popular game, L u n o c a ,i s
like snakes and ladders and provides inform at i o n
about HIV, the immune system and ways to pre-
vent A i d s. Such teaching mat e rial is easy to use
and entirely based on linking ideas and pictures.
A 1996 joint survey by  the United Nations
Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF) and Mexico City
officials found that 13,373 young people under
18 lived and/or worked in the streets of the capi-
tal. Their number grew by 20 per cent between
1992 and 1995‚Äîmore than 6 per cent a year.
Casa Alianza is also present in the United
S t at e s , C a n a d a , G u at e m a l a , H o n d u r a s , C o s t a
Rica and Nicaragua and is setting up a Luna net-
work in Latin America, based on the methods,
equipment and learning games used in Mexico.
‚ÄúThe idea is to copy the material and come up
with a manual which can be used all over Latin
America to assess the results,‚Äù says the program-
me coordinator.
The Mexican headquarters of Casa Alianza
also plans to devise new materials and games,
such as colouring books, picture slides and
puzzles which contain information about HIV.
The organization also responds to frequent
requests to give talks to schools, parishes and
Mexican institutions which care for disadvanta-
ged children. This is perhaps the best evidence
that the Luna programme is shining brightly. n

### The Stigma of AIDS
The s t i g m a of A i d s
w Jean Dussault
Discrimination against people with A i d s
is a major obstacle to fighting the epidemic.
The solution lies in education
w Member of the the Canadian
HIV/Aids Legal Network 
In her village in Kwa z u l u - N at a l , the South A f ri c a n
p r ovince hardest hit by the Aids epidemic, G u g u
Dlamini died because of the disease. But it wa s n ‚Äôt
the virus per se that killed her.She was accused by fel-
l ow - v i l l a g e rs of having brought shame on the com-
munity by talking publicly about being HIV- p o s i t i ve .
When she was beaten by a neighbour who advised her
to keep quiet, she went to the police but they did
nothing to protect her.The next night, v i l l a g e rs at t a c-
ked her house before stoning her and beating her to
d e at h .
While this story has gone round the wo r l d ,t h e r e
are other less bloody but just as revealing tales that
receive no attention.HIV-positive children are the
targets of other children‚Äôs angry parents who do
their utmost to have them expelled from the nur-
s e ry or school or excluded from sports activities.
Some doctors and dentists refuse to treat people
with A i d s. Community help projects regularly come
up against the refusal of local inhabitants to have
such ‚Äú p l a g u e - s t ri c k e n ‚Äù people living in their neigh-
b o u r h o o d .E ven dead, these people continue to ins-
til fear, with some funeral parlours refusing to accept
their remains.
Victims of such discri m i n ation are often poor
and isolated.They do not dare complain about how
they are treated for fear of making things wo rs e .T h e
few statistics about them hardly reflect the extent
of the phenomenon.The number of known cases is
just the tip of the iceberg.
Marginalized groups
As well as being frequently ostracized by ordi-
n a ry folk, H I V- p o s i t i ve people are sometimes also
hit by discri m i n at o ry law s. Using prevention as a
pretext,governments adopt laws which violate the
U n i ve rsal Declaration of Human Rights. O f fic i a l
public health programmes are sometimes the source
of violations.There are plenty of examples.
Blood tests have been made compulsory for cer-
tain ‚Äútarget populat i o n s ‚Äù such as newborn babies
in New York stat e ,p rison inmates in at least 18 U. S .
states and foreigners wishing to stay more than 30
d ays in such countries as Egypt, B u l g a ria and Geor-
gi a . In some U. S .s t at e s ,d o c t o rs are obliged to pass
on to the authorities the names of patients who have
tested positive for HIV. As a ru l e , H I V- p o s i t i ve
people are refused entry to the United States.
In a collection of essays entitled ‚ÄúEthics and Law
in the Study of A I D S ‚Äù (published in 1992 by the
Pa n a m e rican Health Organizat i o n ) ,K at a rina To m a-
s e v s k i , an intern ational human rights expert ,p o i n t s
out that ‚Äúif one were to read the Unive rsal Decla-
r ation of Human Rights with the aim of finding out
which human rights have been affected by various
responses to A i d s , one would see that most, if not
a l l , basic human rights and freedoms, laid down as
the common standard of achievement for humanity
more than 40 ye a rs ago, h ave been challenged, v i o-
l at e d , or denied in the context of HIV/Aids.‚Äù E x p e rt s
have pointed out in vain that no medical or public
health reason justifies measures restricting the ri g h t s
of HIV- p o s i t i ve people.These measures are usually
i n e f f e c t i ve and even counterp r o d u c t i ve . And ye t ,
discrimination continues.
Most ill people evoke compassion but Aids tri g-
g e rs the opposite reaction.The stigma of HIV is tied
to powerful social symbols, sources of prejudice and
intolerance towards groups which may va ry from
one country to the next but all share a common trait:
they are people who were marginalized even before
the emergence of A i d s.They include immigr a n t s ,
r e f u g e e s , people in pri s o n , male and female prosti-
t u t e s ,n at i ve peoples, d rug addicts and homosexuals.
It is sometimes enough just to belong to one of these
so-called ‚Äú ri s k ‚Äù groups to be considered a ‚Äú t h r e at ‚Äù
and thus presumed guilty of spreading the epide-
m i c. People who help them are often regarded as
their ‚Äúaccomplices‚Äù.
The world appears to be divided in two. On one
side are people with Aids and those who help them
I make love, I eat, I get

things as everyone else.
Is there a difference
between me and them?
Is there something on

and on the other, those who imagine they are safe
from the disease and do not feel concern e d . Some in
the first group avoid health and social serv i c e s
because of the stigma to which they are subjected
and their fear of discri m i n at i o n .Those who most
need help, i n f o rm ation and education are thus for-
ced underground which makes them even more vul-
n e r a b l e . Some people refuse to be tested for A i d s ,
p r e f e rring not to know. O t h e rs keep their infection
secret or else deny it.
People in the second group may be sticking their
head in the sand like ostri c h e s , but they are not for
t h at matter spared by the epidemic.Their self-defence
mechanisms feed their ignorance and create illusions
t h at gi ve them a false sense of securi t y.They think HIV
only strikes at ‚Äú ri s k ‚Äù groups‚Äîsealed communities
with which they have no contact. Believing that HIV
respects social frontiers makes them vulnerable in
t u rn .At an institutional leve l , such a belief slows dow n
awareness programmes and helps to reduce the fun-
ding they at t r a c t . So the stigma and discri m i n at i o n
t h at accompany Aids are not only consequences of
the epidemic but also contri bute to its spread.
The late Jo n athan Mann, who was head of the
World Health Organizat i o n ‚Äôs Special Progr a m m e
on Aids and of Harvard Unive rs i t y ‚Äôs Fran√ßois-Xav i e r
Bagnoud Center, insisted that human rights feat u r e
prominently in the campaign against HIV. A r g u i n g
t h at such protection of ill or HIV-infected people
was vital for ethical, judicial and practical reasons, h e
stressed that a community could not deal effecti-
vely with the disease if it failed to respect the basic
right of people to have a say in decisions concern i n g
their own future.
Protecting the victims
Although the stigma of HIV/Aids is tied to igno-
r a n c e ,i n f o rming people about the virus and the ri s k
of catching it is not enough to eradicate it.Preven-
t i ve education has to be accompanied by seri o u s
e d u c ation about discri m i n at i o n , but this is still at
an embryonic stage.
At the intern ational leve l ,h e a l t h , legal and ethics
e x p e rt s ,r e p r e s e n t at i ves of communities affected by
the disease and study groups have been insisting for
several years on the need to ensure that policies to
reduce the spread of Aids and care for its victims
respect their rights and their dignity, whether they
h ave the disease or are just at ri s k . But the appeals of
the experts will remain a dead letter without broad
public understanding and sufficient will, e s p e c i a l l y
on the part of political decision-makers.
The UN High Commission for Human Rights
and UNAIDS in 1998 published 12 guidelines for
s t ates on the rights of individuals concern i n g
H I V / A i d s. One of them recommended laws to pro-
tect victims of discri m i n ation in pri vate and public
sectors while guaranteeing respect for privacy and
c o n f i d e n t i a l i t y. Another focused on one of the
sources of discri m i n ation and called on states to
‚Äúpromote the wide and ongoing distri bution of crea-
t i ve educat i o n , training and media progr a m m e s
explicitly designed to change attitudes of discri m i-
n ation and stigmat i z ation associated with HIV/Aids
to understanding and acceptance.‚Äù
The current gap between the quantity of recom-
m e n d ations and a sluggish bu r e a u c r a cy is glari n g .
In Aids prevention campaigns, the issue of discri-
m i n ation often falls by the wayside and is rarely dis-
cussed in schools.The odd educational film at t a c k s
the stigma but no-one can boast of a broad aware-
ness campaign that has an important impact on
society.
The main features of education against discri-
m i n ation must be worked out in each country accor-
ding to the social context and the evolution of the
d i s e a s e . After the targets and participants have been
c h o s e n , steps must be taken to create a fri e n d l i e r
atmosphere for people who have Aids and who fa c e
rejection and indifference.This must also be done
for their families and friends as well as all those invo l-
ved in the fight against the epidemic.We must not
forget that the disease is the enemy, not the people
who have it. n

A BOL I T ION GAINS GROUND
w Martine Jacot
Countries that have abolished capital punishment now outnumber those applying it. 
But four countries still account for 80 per cent of all executions.
n
In the teeming jumble of daily news,
one important human rights event
passed almost unnoticed recently: on
June 2, 1999, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin commuted the death sentences of
716 people to life imprisonment. The
death penalty was thereby effectively abo-
lished in Russia, in line with its commit-
ment upon joining the Council of
Europe1 in 1996. In that year, Russia exe-
cuted 40 death row pri s o n e rs , s a d l y
almost a dark world record.
Russian Justice Minister Pave l
K r a s h e n i n n i k ov said the presidential
decree was ‚Äúa historic day‚Äù for his coun-
try. The decision may encourage the for-
mer Soviet bloc countries wishing to
become members of the Council of
Europe to follow suit or risk being barred
in the future.
Tipping
the balance
The Council was the first body to sign
(in 1983) an intern ational agr e e m e n t
obliging the signatories to abolish the
death penalty in peacetime. The treaty
(Protocol 6 of the European Convention
on Human Rights) came into effect in
1985. Since the Berlin Wall came down,
22 former or new European countries
have dropped capital punishment, at least
for ‚Äúordinary‚Äù crimes. The most recent
were this ye a r: L at v i a , C y p rus and
Northern Ireland. In 1998, Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania took the
same step for all categories of offences
and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan decla-
red moratoriums on executions.
Europe is not the only continent

where the abolitionist cause has made
h e a d way. Amnesty Intern ational notes
that the number of countries that have
totally abolished the death penalty has tri-
pled over the past 20 years‚Äîfrom 19 in
1979 to 68 by April 1999. To this list can
be added 14 more countries that impose
the death penalty in wartime only and 23
others where it is considered to have been
abolished ‚Äúin effect‚Äù because they have
not executed anyone for at least ten years.
This total of 105 states compares with
the 90 countries or territories that have
executed at least one of their death row

1,067 people were executed and 1,657
death sentences imposed. Tax evasion has
been a capital offence in China since
1997, which brought to about 60 the
crimes punishable by death there.
About a hundred people were execu-
ted in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo in 1998 according to Amnesty,
and 66 in Iran. In the United States (see
p. 39), 68 prisoners were executed, most
by lethal injection.Three of the U.S. pri-
soners were under 17 when they commit-
ted their crimes. Since 1990, only six
c o u n t ries‚Äîthe United Stat e s , I r a n ,

sentences on people who were minors at

presidential decree has just put an end to
this practice.The UN Convention on the

tipped only recently, between 1997 and
1998. When you look at the picture over
the whole century, progress is even more
impressive: in 1899 only Venezuela, Costa
Rica and the tiny republic of San Marino,
in Italy, had decided to abolish the death
penalty.
Such progress is clearly linked with
the gr owth of local and intern at i o n a l
human rights move m e n t s. The deat h
penalty is increasingly thought of as a
cruel and inhuman punishment. Its irre-
ve rsibility always touches people‚Äôs
consciences in cases where it turns out
that innocent people have been victims of
a r b i t r a ry or unfair tri a l s , cases which
receive more and more publicity these
d ay s. I n t e rn ational pressure has also
increased. 1999 saw the tenth anniversary
of the UN General Assembly‚Äôs adoption
of its first protocol calling for the aboli-
tion of the death penalty.
Many countries decided to abolish
capital punishment as a way of turning
over a new leaf following long periods of
political repression. This is what happe-
ned not only in the former communist
countries of Eastern Europe but also in
South Africa (1997) and before that in
L atin A m e rica‚Äîin A r g e n t i n a , B r a z i l ,
Peru, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
A cradle
of human rights
Elsewhere, action by courageous poli-
tical leaders has been needed to overcome
local public opinion that has remained
mostly in favour of the death penalty.The
French socialist government,for example,
abolished the death penalty in 1981 soon
after taking office. But opinion polls sho-
wed it was not until 18 years later, in
1999, that a majority of the public polled
finally turned against the death penalty,
despite France‚Äôs reputation as the ‚Äúcradle
of human rights‚Äù. In other countries, the
process has sometimes been a very long
one. Belgium and Greece repealed the
death penalty in 1996 and 1993 respecti-
vely, more than 20 years after carrying out
their last executions.
Despite this progr e s s , A m n e s t y
International reminds us that at least
1,625 prisoners were executed in 1998 in
37 countries, four of which‚ÄîChina, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the
United States and Iran‚Äîaccounted for
80 per cent of the total.
In China, for want of official figures,
Amnesty estimates that in 1998 at least

neighbours? In the Caribbean, rampant
c rime has fired support for capital
punishment among gove rnments and
public opinion. Nine prisoners were exe-
cuted by hanging in early June 1999 in
Port-of-Spain, capital of the Caribbean
state of Trinidad and Tobago, five years
after the last execution took place there.
The Bahamas used the gallows again
twice in 1998, after a two-year pause.
While the last execution by hanging in
Jamaica took place in 1988, there‚Äôs a high
risk that the practice could be resumed:
there are 40 people on death row there,
several of whom have almost exhausted
all legal recourse.
The myth
of deterrence
Rampant crime was also used by the
authorities in the Philippines to justify
restoring the death penalty in December
1993, with the first execution being car-
ried out in February 1999.Yet this coun-
try was the first in Asia to abolish capital
punishment, in 1987, after the fall of
President Ferdinand Marcos.The current
head of state, Joseph Estrada,has stressed
his determination to attack poverty‚Äîthe
‚Äúcompost-heap of crime‚Äù‚Äîbut without
abolishing the death penalty. Recent opi-
nion polls show about 80 per cent of
Filipinos are in favour of it. Over the past
six years,914 people have been sentenced
to death in the Philippines.
But so far no study has shown clearly
that capital punishment is a deterrent.On
the contrary, the murder rate has fallen in
several countries that have abolished it,
such as Canada, a neighbour of the
United States. Amnesty International and
other human rights organizations hope
the U.S., among others, will at least abo-
lish the death penalty for people who were
minors when they committed their crime,
as well as for the mentally ill and the
elderly. n

In a nation where the death penalty is in
force in 38 out of 51 stat e s , r o u g h l y
3,500 pri s o n e rs are waiting on deat h
r ow, 47 per cent of them white and 42 per
cent black.* Executions are on the ri s e ,w i t h
68 carried out in 1998. In addition to impo-
sing the death penalty for crimes committed
by juve n i l e s , the U. S . is also unusual in
making no exceptions for the mentally retar-
d e d .
W h at explains the endorsement of the
d e ath penalty by four out of eve ry five A m e-
ricans? In the civil rights period of the1960s,
the percentage of those in its favour bri e fly
dipped as low as 42 per cent.But since the
Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976,after
a morat o rium of about a decade, s u p p o rt
has been little short of monolithic. It is tru e
t h at the figures drop (to about 60 per cent)
if those surve yed are presented the altern a-
t i ve of keeping serious offenders in jail
without possibility of parole.
The ‚Äòdeath belt‚Äô
H owe ve r , fear of crime persists and a puni-
t i ve climate remains. L aw m a k e rs are conti-
nually introducing bills to expand the list of
‚Äú a g gr avating fa c t o rs ‚Äù presented to the jury in
m a ny states in the sentencing phase of a capi-
tal case.
The so-called ‚Äú D e ath Belt‚Äù of the Sou-
t h e rn stat e s , with their history of lynch law,
accounts for a hefty percentage of death row
i n m at e s , and half of the executions in 1997
were carried out in Texas alone. But Cali-
fornia,which pays out more for its prisons
than its unive rs i t i e s , n ow has the largest
number of inmates on death row. New Yo r k ,
whose Gove rnor Mario Cuomo was one of
the few American politicians in recent his-
t o ry willing to risk a public stand for aboli-
t i o n , has brought the death penalty back.
And in A ri z o n a ,o f ficials intend to accele-
rate the pace of executions.
Built on Puritanical foundat i o n s ,h u m a n
relations in this gun-toting culture are still
v i e wed in Manichean term s , va l i d ating the
f r o n t i e rs m a n ‚Äôs call for the bad guy to be
s t rung up. In a climate heavily influ e n c e d
by the religious ri g h t , a public stand against
capital punishment is regarded as nothing
s h o rt of political suicide. E xe c u t i ve cle-
mency, which was used to commute many
d e ath sentences to life imprisonment duri n g
the heyday of the gangsters in the 1930s and
1 9 4 0 s , is rarely exe r c i s e d .Witness Gove r-
nor Bill Clinton,who approved the execu-
tion of a mentally retarded convict in A r k a n-
sas just after winning the presidential
elections in 1992,and California‚Äôs Demo-
c r atic Gove rnor Gray Dav i s , who has pas-
sed up the possibility of staying two exe c u-
tions this year.
M o r e ove r , the criminal justice system is
i n e x t ricably intertwined with electoral poli-
t i c s. D i s t rict at t o rn e y s , who make the deci-
sion whether to seek the death penalty in a
gi ven case, are elected. S t ate judges, o n c e
a p p o i n t e d , face a retention vote at the next
general elections.While federal judges are
appointed for life, they face a grueling congr e s-
sional confirm ation bat t l e .Public perception
is that capital cases, which can cost a state in
the region of $1.2 million to prosecute, a r e
subject to unduly lengthy scru t i ny. In fa c t ,
l e gi s l atures around the country have made it
increasingly difficult to bring appeals.
M e a n w h i l e , despite a 1984 Supreme
C o u rt ruling intended to correct racial bias
in jury selection, the operation of the deat h
penalty remains racially skewe d .Of the 1,838
D i s t rict At t o rneys in death penalty states as
of May this ye a r , only 22 were Hispanic and
22 black.Although roughly equal numbers
of blacks and whites are homicide victims, o f
the 500 people put to death between 1977
and 1998, 81.8 per cent were convicted of
killing a white pers o n . Setting aside cases
i nvolving particularly egr e gious crimes such as
s e rial killings, the death penalty falls dispro-
p o rt i o n at e l y, for crimes of equal seve ri t y,u p o n
poor blacks who cannot afford adequate legal
r e p r e s e n t at i o n .
There are some signs of movement in
public opinion. A cluster of miscarriages of
justice on death row and the reve rsal of seve-
ral convictions have helped to rally support
both for a new morat o rium on executions and
for a plan to dive rt spending on death penalty
cases into a fund for the families of homicide
v i c t i m s. It is also conceivable that if a Demo-
c r at comes to power at the next elections and
appoints two new justices of a less than
extreme conservat i ve pers u a s i o n , the Supreme
C o u rt might turn the situation around.
B e t ween now and then, p ri s o n e rs wa i t
on death row. In the words of one juve n i l e
offender in Oklahoma,‚Äú To condemn me to
d e ath . . . is to say my life has no positive
va l u e , I‚Äôm beyond correction or rehabilita-
t i o n .‚Äù It is strange that a nation that puts such
store in the perfectibility of the individual is
willing to discard so many live s. n

speaks in broken English which his listeners
do not fully understand.The look on their

the same surp ri s e ‚Äùt h at at each destinat i o n

feelings beyond wo r d s. So there was no need
for any translations.

Jos√© Navas is from Ve n e z u e l a , w i t h
Indian and Spanish blood from his mother
and Italian and A f rican blood through his
fat h e r. He has been based for the last few
years in Montreal (Canada) after studying
in New Yo r k , and dances and choreogr a p h s
regularly in both Europe and North A m e-
ri c a . By ‚Äútalking about his Ve n e z u e l a n
c u l t u r e ‚Äù through his body, he has found a
way of breaking down language barriers.
M o d e rn dance has clearly become a
major vehicle for cultural exchange around
the wo r l d . It does more than simply
transcend spoken wo r d s : it seems to repre-
sent a common experience of humanity.‚Äú We
are all human beings‚Äîa link that comes
before national or ethnic ties,‚Äù s ays Duroure.
‚ÄúA child who cries conveys the same mes-
sage eve ry w h e r e .‚Äù Dance also invo l ves a dif-
ferent view of things, appealing to the ima-
gi n at i o n , just like music, and often with
m u s i c.
All these fa c t o rs partly explain the
upsurge of modern dance,a worldwide phe-
n o m e n o n . In 1998, 442 choreogr a p h e rs from
52 countries attended the prestigious Inter-
n ational Choreogr a p hy Fe s t i val in Seine
Saint-Denis (a suburb of Pa ri s ,F r a n c e ) . Fo r
the past decade, more and more festiva l s
giving pride of place to modern dance have
been held all over the world‚Äîin Prague
( Tanec Praha, e ve ry June), Brazil (Fe s t i va l
I n t e rnacional de Dan√ßa, in Belo Hori z o n t e
in Nove m b e r ) ,To k yo (the Yokohama Fe s t i-
va l ) , Stockholm (Dansen Hus), V i l n i u s
(Lithuania) and Adelaide (Australia).Fe s t i-
vals are also spreading across the Mediter-
ranean regi o n . A modern dance gat h e ri n g
was held in Tunis in early 1999, with dan-
c e rs from Egypt, L e b a n o n , A l g e ri a ,
M o r o c c o, Jordan and Syri a .O t h e rs will soon
take place in Casablanca and Beirut.
Dance often accompanies openings and
gr owth in other domains. In 1995, the firs t
Luanda Fe s t i val in Angola symbolized
attempts to revive the country after 20 ye a rs
of civil war.The second one,held in 1998,
claimed the title of the Fe s t i val of A f ri c a n
C h o r e o graphic Creation and showcased the
blossoming of modern dance across the
c o n t i n e n t . Some of the pri z e w i n n i n g

Miniature multinationals
Dance companies are miniature multi-
n at i o n a l s. The Ta n z t h e ater of Wu p p e rt a l
( G e rm a ny) run by Pina Bausch includes
people from ten countries, whose national
traits find pride of place in her productions.
The Tanztheater creates pieces all over the
world these days. Two Burkinab√© dancers
joined the Choreography Centre in Mont-
pellier (southern France) while retaining
links with their country. One of them, S a l i a
Sanou,had just completed his law studies
and passed the exam to become a police
inspector when he was invited to
France.‚ÄúIn 1991, you couldn‚Äôt make a
living from dance in Ouagadougou,‚Äù h e
said of Burkina Faso‚Äôs capital. ‚ÄúI was trai-
ned in A f rican styles by the older men in
the village but I never imagined I could
make a career of it or that I could dance in
silence, without music. Abroad, I discove-
red the music inside me.‚Äù
In Burkina Fa s o, Sanou and his col-
league Seydou Boro created a piece called
S i g n i n t o, which won a prize at the 1998
Luanda Fe s t i va l . Both dream of opening
together a choreogr a p hy centre in Ouaga-
d o u g o u , where studios but not dancers are
lacking.
‚ÄúThe challenge for me is how to bring
my culture and my experiences to other
people so they resonate even more with
their cultures without making modern
dance too cerebral,‚Äù says Deroure in Dur-
ban.He would like to move towards a kind
of language encompassing these different
cultures.
‚ÄúEverywhere,especially in Latin Ame-
ri c a , our generation is more and more of
m i xed background and the next will be eve n
more so,‚Äù s ays Navas in Montreal. ‚Äú We ‚Äôr e
opening up to the world and exchangi n g
things more than ever before.‚Äù
Yet does this mixing process risk homo-
genizing or wat e ring down creativity? ‚Äú A b s o-
lutely not,‚Äùs ays Sola.‚Äú Tradition without crea-
tion is steri l e . In dance as in other art i s t i c
fie l d s , transplanting one country ‚Äôs traditions
to another doesn‚Äôt wo r k , except for a few eth-
nology enthusiasts. M o d e rn dance can only
be creation and innovat i o n .‚Äù n

### Shedding straitjackets
SHEDDING STRA I TJACK ET S
Dance, like other art-forms, has been alive since
time immemorial, never ceasing to gain new
ground. At the temple of Palaiokastro, in Crete,
dance was offered to Zeus to make the vines and
farm animals fertile. Ceremonies like this were to
be found from India to pre-Columbia America. Is it
possible to draw the line at which dance evolved
from a communal rite to a form of self-expres-
sion? What about the period in India, for example,
when dance forms originally derived from martial
arts became ‚Äúperformances‚Äù in their own right? 
With a touch of humour, the anthropologist
Johann Kealiinohomoku refers to classical ballet as
‚Äúa kind of ethnic dance‚Äù. Ballet became popular in
France under Louis XIV, who set up the first royal
dance academy in the West. Indeed the king him-
self danced in public until 1670. The matrix of
artistic dance, ballet also opened a new vista for cul-
tural exchange, with Italian opera troupes visiting
France in the 17th century. But it was not until the
start of the 20th century, with the break ushered in
by the birth of modern dance, that this art form
espoused influences from much farther afield.
An insatiable curiosity for universal and spiritual
forms of expression inspired the work of America n
c h o r e o g rapher and dancer Ruth Saint-Denis whose
passion for Oriental dance was first sparked by a
cigarette poster of an Egyptian goddess. Her famous
E gypt, Greece and India which she performed
across the United States in 1916 was a mix of pyr-
rhic dances, scenes from the banks of the Nile and
the Ganges and evocations of nirvana. Another of
her famous compatriots, Isadora Duncan, the high
priestess of ‚Äúbarefoot dance‚Äù, sought to liberate the
body from the straitjackets of the past by conjuring
up an imaginary version of ancient Greece.
This search for ‚Äútruth‚Äù of the body continued
to grow throughout the 20th century, with constant
exchanges between ‚Äúhere‚Äù and ‚Äúe l s ewhere‚Äù in a
dialogue first between the United States and
Europe and then with the Orient. In London in
1916, the Japanese dancer Michio Ito created a
modern version of a traditional Japanese n √¥
d ra m a , At the Hawk‚Äôs We l l , with the Irish poet
W. B . Yeats. Another Japanese dancer, Ta k a y a
Eguchi, came to Germany to learn from the legen-
d a ry Mary Wigman and then returned to his
homeland to add a new dimension to modern
expressive dance.
In Paris, colonial exhibitions introduced the
public to Javanese, Kurdish, Persian and Armenian
dancers. After World War II, this cultural exchange
and intermingling resumed with a new dynamic.
From the late 1970s, the spectacular rise of modern
dance owed much to the seeds sown by German,
A m e r i can and Japanese dancers and teachers. 
France was a meeting point. Some of the lea-
ding figures in the French dance world were
foreign‚Äîamong them Americans Susan Buirge
and Mark Tompkins, Hideyuki Yano of Japan,
Hungarian Joseph Nadj, the Afro-American Elsa
Wolliaston and Angelin Preljocaj of Albanian
origin. The impact of the movement was felt to
v a rying degrees all over Europe.
Today Europe and North America have lost
their choreography monopoly as enthusiastic
young audiences around the world throng to see
n ew forms of artistic expression. Dance is increa-
singly nomadic in chara c t e r. The dancer travels yet
works within his or her own space, while some
c h o r e o g raphers go so far as to see the stage as a
‚Äú f ragment of mental space‚Äù. J-M. A. n

W hy is this difference import a n t , yo u

strong? The answer is that an exclusive
p h o t o,w h at journalists call ‚Äúa scoop‚Äù,can be

wide and earn many thousands of dollars.
This can‚Äôt happen when similar photos have
been taken by several photogr a p h e rs. If the

been a salaried employee of an agency which
charges its customers by subscription rat h e r

W h at ‚Äôs more, these photogr a p h e rs arri ve d
three months after the genocide began on
A p ril 6 and could only send back depres-
singly similar pictures of the afterm ath of the
tragedy‚Äîthe exodus and the epidemics,
not the event that sparked them off.
Exponential growth
P h o t o gr a p hy is widely considered to
h ave been invented in 1839.Since then the
number of photographic images has gr ow n
e x p o n e n t i a l l y. It is increasingly hard, d e s-
pite photogr a p h e rs ‚Äôs k i l l s , to come up with
a picture that doesn‚Äôt echo an earlier one.
Because of the laws of supply and demand
this has led to the situation in which increa-
sing output of news pictures goes hand in
hand with a decrease in the price they fetch.
Does a photo‚Äîa silent image, with a
b rief caption or no caption at all‚Äîhave
a ny intrinsic meaning? Imagine a shot of a
h o rseman who is caught by the camera
whipping his hors e . Is he a coward fle e i n g
the enemy or is he charging bravely forwa r d ?
It all depends,of cours e ,on the caption that
goes with the picture and its credibility.
Take the example of the photos that
were long thought to show the ‚Äú Ve l ‚Äôd ‚Äô H i v ‚Äù
stadium in Pa ris at the time when French
Jews were held there for deport ation in July
1 9 4 2 .2 N ow we know that they show a mee-
ting held two ye a rs lat e r.And what should
we make of the photo analysed by French
philosopher R√©gis Debray in his book L‚Äô O e i l
na√Øf (‚ÄúThe Naive Eye‚Äù) showing a group of
Pa risian strollers looking nonchalantly at a
bus with an open rear plat f o rm? The scene
a p p e a rs banal, except when we know that
the packed bus was taking Jews to the inter-
nment camp at Drancy, outside Pa ri s.
Herein lies one of the ove rriding we a k-
nesses of photojournalism and of photo-
gr a p hy in general, d e s c ribed by the Ger-
m a ny philosopher Walter Benjamin as
‚ÄúThe image in an age when it can be tech-
nically reproduced‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an image,
nothing more,‚Äù is all it says to us.
Despite this draw b a c k ,a number of pho-
tos have had a decisive effect on public opi-
nion and changed the course of history.O n e
notable example is the photo of the naked
girl running away from the Vietnamese vil-
lage of Trang Bang which had just been
bombed by mistake with napalm by South
Vietnamese aircraft on June 8, 1 9 7 2 . It wa s
taken by a Vietnamese AP photogr a p h e r ,

can soldier being dragged through the
streets of Mogadishu.It humiliated the Uni-
ted States and turned U. S . public opinion
against the presence of A m e rican troops in
S o m a l i a .
The strength and the weakness of pho-
t o j o u rnalism stem from its capacity to
t rigger a sudden earthquake in public
o p i n i o n ‚Äî p r ovided that the wo r l d ‚Äôs maga-
zines and daily newspapers get hold of the
photo and circulate it. But this key role
has now been taken over by television.
E ven if screened images are often less
s h a rp than many famous still photos,
television gives them added weight and
viewer interest via sound, commentary
and in some cases on-the-spot report i n g .
‚ÄòTelepresence‚Äô
From an aesthetic viewpoint, p h o t o-
gr a p hy is eve ry bit as good as television
r e p o rt i n g .A photograph can be looked at
again and again, whereas the televised
image fades from the screen. H owe ve r , a
good television report has a didactic adva n-
t a g e : it can explain and teach us about
e ve n t s. Since the 1960s, television sets
h ave become a common household item,
and TV reports reach vast audiences.

### Photojournalism: the last lap?
PHOTOJOURN A L ISM: HOW IT WORK S
There are three kinds of photojournalism. The
first and oldest kind relies on individual free-
lance photographers who come up with ideas,
shoot a feature and then offer it to various media,
mostly magazines and sometimes daily papers,
for publication. In some cases the media will com-
mission them to produce a report in line with their
special interest or skills.
The second kind comprises groups of photo-
g raphers working in an agency. The oldest and most
prestigious agency is Magnum, which was founded
in 1945 and is the only agency run as a photogra-
phers‚Äô co-operative. Gamma, set up in 19 67 by Ray-
mond Depardon and his associates, is another
famous agency. Sygma and Sipa-Presse were
founded later. All these agencies are based in Pa r i s .
Their way of paying photographers and hence their
working methods are ra d i cally changing. The agency
and the photographer consult with the editors of a
client publication before a job, and usually split the
cost of the assignment as well as the potential pro-
fits originating from publications which negotiate
reproduction fees on a ca s e - b y - case basis. They
keep the copyright to all their photos. This 50 - 50
agreement has revolutionized major assignments.
The third kind of photojournalism is done by the
big news agencies‚ÄîAssociated Press (American),
Reuters (British) and Agence France Presse (Fr e n c h )
‚Äîwhich are often known as wire services. The
media pay subscriptions to the agencies for unli-
mited use of agency photos and news.
News agency photographers are on a regular
s a l a ry, and like most agency journalists their names
are not widely known. They are paid at a fixed ra t e
irrespective of the sales of their photos. Recently,
international photofeature agencies such as
Gamma, Sygma and Sipa-Presse have also put
some of their photographers on fixed salaries. The
turnover of each of these three international agen-
cies is nearly $20 million a year. n

access to healthcare and equality for women are

created 30 years ago. The agency warns that the

So is photojournalism on its last legs?
Perhaps not, but to use a metaphor from
athletics maybe it‚Äôs on the last lap.The big
photo agencies such as Gamma, Sygma
and Sipa-Presse (see box on facing page)
h ave been forced to turn to areas out-
side journ a l i s m , like illustrating books,
d i c t i o n a ries and ency c l o p a e d i a s , wo r k i n g
for the communications departments of
public and semi-public institutions, p h o-
t o graphing the tempestuous lives of cele-
b ri t i e s , or even doing plain laborat o ry
wo r k .C e l e b rity photos accounted for 60
per cent of Sygma‚Äôs turn over before it
was taken over two ye a rs ago, while news
photos earned less than 10 per cent.
These agencies are now so economi-
cally weakened that they are easy prey for
outside inve s t o rs.A major investment gr o u p
looking to break into the field can buy out
a famous photo agency and gain far more
than a network of photogr a p h e rs and a
stock of photos. It can also acquire a pres-
t i gious name which is wo rth far more than
the financial costs of the takeove r.
Banks took a sizeable stake in Gamma
in 1997. More import a n t l y,m e g a - c o m p a-
nies such as Bill Gat e s ‚Äô Microsoft and its
d atabank Corbis have been especially active
in trying to get their hands on major photo

all free of copyri g h t .These photos can be
reproduced ad infin i t u m ,without bri n gi n g
a ny royalties to the photogr a p h e rs who took
t h e m .These companies can draw freely on
such huge archives to obtain low-cost illus-
t r ations for their multimedia activities or else
re-sell these pictures far more cheaply than
o t h e rs on the market,e ven if they are dat e d .
Wire services
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to tell the difference these
days between a fresh news picture taken
at gr e at expense and a much cheaper
photo that has come from an archive,‚Äù
says Roger Th√©rond,former head of the
French weekly magazine Pa ri s - M at c h. I n
fact too much photojournalism is killing
photojournalism, just as too many taxes
kill taxation.The fact remains,however,
t h at the death of the written press has
been predicted for the past twenty years
yet it is still alive‚Äîand abundantly illus-
trated.So how do things really stand?
Perhaps the past has caught up with us.
The gat e k e e p e rs of photojournalism did
not emerge ove rn i g h t . In 1903, F r e n c h
e n gineer √âdouard Belin invented a machine
which could transmit photos by telephone
from one place to another, like sending a
fax today.The machine enabled all the wo r l-
d ‚Äôs daily newspapers to receive pictures in
‚Äúreal time‚Äù for publication the next day.
‚ÄúWire serv i c e s ‚Äù such as A s s o c i ated Press,
R e u t e rs and Agence France Presse were set
up to serve as communications netwo r k s
and feed the media pictures via this pro-
c e s s.
These agencies, n ow virtually the sole
p l aye rs in news photogr a p hy, continue to
c over world events alongside the big tele-
vision netwo r k s.The hundreds of wo r k e rs
on their staff would claim to be simply
‚Äúdoing a job‚Äù. Most newspapers are sat i s-

T A L K I N G  T O ‚Ä¶
The most recent meeting of the G8 group 
(the world‚Äôs eight leading industrial powers)
decided for the first time that globalization
needed to be ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù. Does that mean
it‚Äôs inhuman right now?
It‚Äôs very human and very creative in
the eyes of the strong and very inhuman
for the weak. It creates unprecedented
polarization.
A third of the world‚Äôs population has
substantially raised its standard of living
and expanded its cultural and technologi-
cal resources.The other side of the coin is
that the latest UNDP Human Development
Report showed a massive growth in both
inequality and poverty as well as social
exclusion and marginalization all over the
world,with a few big exceptions including
India, China and Chile.
Forty per cent of the planet‚Äôs popula-
tion lives in misery on less than two dol-
lars a day. Within this category, a growing
number live in extreme poverty, especial-
ly cultural poverty. No one in this plight
can make any use of the emerging infor-
mation society. So ‚Äúhumanizing‚Äù globali-
zation means harnessing all the enormous
creative might of the new technologies, of
new economic productivities and of
worldwide communication through the
Internet so that it benefits people outside
the most advanced, educated and sophis-
ticated sectors of the most powerful coun-
tries. But for the moment, this is just a
pipe dream. We‚Äôre told we have to do
things differently, but the effects of such
discrimination are still not being correc-
ted. In fact quite the opposite is happe-
ning.
Does this discrimination match the divide
between so-called ‚Äúgeneric labour‚Äù and ‚Äúself-
programmable labour‚Äù?
Not entirely. S e l f - p r o gr a m m a b l e
labour has enough information, educa-
tion and culture to adapt to constantly
changing technological and professional
conditions. But in a system which has
become purely based on the individual,
without any social safety net or solidarity,
belonging to this category doesn‚Äôt mean
you‚Äôre invulnerable: if a major incident
occurs, such as a physical or psychologi-
cal illness or a family crisis, you find your-
self on the other side of the fence. Many
middle-class children, for example, start
taking drugs between the age of 18 and
20 and end up in prison, thus heading
right down the path to social exclusion.
Generic labour refers to workers who,
because they don‚Äôt have a specific qualifi-
cation and an adequate level of education
and culture, cannot fit into the predomi-
nant system of production‚Äîmachines
can or could replace them. Within this
category, there are two groups. There are
those who are still relatively protected,
who keep their jobs because they work in
institutions or live in countries that help
and protect them, and guarantee a decent
standard of living. There are also those
who live either in run-down city suburbs
in rich countries or in poverty-stricken

### Manuel Castells: the citizen versus the machine
M A NUEL CAS T EL L S :
T HE CI T IZ EN VERSUS
T HE MACHINE
As the technological revolution revolutionizes economic life and communications and shakes 
industrial society to its foundations, a noted Spanish sociologist asks where the citizen stands 
in the emerging ‚Äòinformation society‚Äô
regions and nations without the infra-
structure or companies that make pos-
sible and guarantee a transition towards
the information society. Such people are
totally excluded. That social exclusion
comes from lack of work.
Why do you say capitalism is much more
brutal today than it was in the past?
Because it‚Äôs broken the social
contract.These days, networks mean you
can connect everything that carries value
for this dominant system, thus making
those connected to it extremely dynamic.
But this structure also means that any-
thing for which it has little regard‚Äîindi-
viduals, regions, sectors and companies‚Äî
d o n ‚Äôt get connected and are thereby
condemned.And since it manages to take
control of anything which could be of
value to it, capitalism can afford to be
extremely choosy and to impose its own
rules.This is helped by the fact that states
and institutions, political or para-politi-
c a l , which acted as a counterwe i g h t
during the Industrial Revolution, have
very little influence over worldwide com-
munications, capital movements, techno-
l o gical development and production.
Might is right, a purely Darwinian logic .
Is anyone exempt from this logic?
In a way, it takes root independently of
a company ‚Äôs will and those who resist are
c rushed by competition because the net-
works consist only of the strong. And it
takes root inside the firms themselve s ,
independent of managers or outside share-
h o l d e rs. Look at advanced capitalism in
Silicon Valley which, i n c i d e n t a l l y, e m b o-
dies in a sense the 1960s Marxist ideal of
wo r k e rs ‚Äô m a n a g e m e n t . The people who
work in Silicon Valley are paid to a large
extent in shares rather than a regular sala-
The people who work in
Silicon Valley are paid to a

than a regular salary. So it‚Äôs in
their interest to push their way
upward in the firm, even if it
means kicking a colleague out
of a job on the grounds that he
or she isn‚Äôt productive enough.

ry. So it‚Äôs in their interest to push their way
up in the firm , e ven if it means kicking a
colleague out of a job on the grounds that
he or she isn‚Äôt productive enough.
Does this illustrate a trend which you
emphasize, namely the extraordinary
individualization of people‚Äôs destinies?
Setting aside current myths about the
impact of the new techno-economic sys-
tem on jobs, usually measured in terms of
falling unemployment, the fundamental
change lies in the greater flexibility of
labour relations.The way companies ope-
r ate in networks‚Äîboth internal and
external‚Äîis destroying the notion of a
stable, reliable job which dates from the
Industrial Revolution.
In Bri t a i n , the birthplace of that revo-
l u t i o n , 55 per cent of the workforce is
i nvo l ved in va rious kinds of temporary,
p a rt-time or freelance wo r k . The traditio-
nal model of organized labour is no longer
the ru l e . The same thing is happening in
cities in poor countri e s , which are beco-
ming more and more urbanized.There the
so-called informal economy holds sway
and labour relations revo l ve round the
l o n g - t e rm lack of stable and regular wo r k .
Economic activity in such countries can be
quite pri m i t i ve but some of it is ve ry

CAS T ELLS ON THE
UNI T ED NAT IONS
I think international organizations like UNESCO
have a really important part to play. They can
be a link between governments which are still,
after all, political instruments, and demands based
on people‚Äôs ideals, especially in the fields of deve-
lopment and peace.
So they must be meeting-places but, increa-
singly, also forums which give rise to pra c t i ca l
projects. For example, everyone agrees educa t i o n
is the key to reducing inequality and exclusion. But
what exactly does education mean? What must be
done on a world scale so the kind of education
needed reaches the two-thirds of humanity who
currently have no access to it? The response must
indeed come from governments. But UNESCO is
the very kind of organization within which a world
education strategy can be drawn up.
Bodies like the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank or the G8 group of countries are
managing systems of worldwide exchanges but
they concentrate on technological innovation,
economic productivity and growth of informa-
tion. Their power must be balanced by interna-
tional organizations like UNES CO , the World Health
Organization and the International Labour Orga-
nisation, which could draw up a new world social
and cultural contract, as the other bodies did for
economics and technology. But they will only
succeed in this if they acquire similar legitimacy
and authority by using the might of the netw o r k s .
n
ty is so much more efficient than previous
a rrangements that firms which still opera-
te with a mainly salaried workforce and
stable and established working methods
are doomed to failure by the laws of com-
p e t i t i o n . F i rms are also relying more and
more on a core of skilled wo r k e rs they
want to keep (and to whom they gi ve
stable jobs) and on a huge mass of tempo-
r a ry and sub-contracted wo r k e rs.W h at we
h ave is an individualization of the relat i o n-
ship between salaried wo r k e rs and firm s
on one side and among self-employed wo r-
k e rs on the other. E ve rybody sub-
contracts with eve rybody else.
But this trend introduces a totally unequal
balance of power between workers and
companies. . . .
Yes, but also between workers them-
selves. The strongest have real bargaining
power in the market, depending on what
they can contribute to their own or any
other firm.The unskilled don‚Äôt have such
power or any real power of collective bar-
gaining through trade unions. In the now-
dominant pri vate sector, unions these
days have only a meagre role and union
membership is steadily falling.This is why
we must resist shrinking the social securi-
ty safety-net and support a transition
from protecting individuals who wo r k
(the situation in most countries) to pro-
tecting people whether they work or not.
You paint a very gloomy picture. . . .
Saying that these changes only lead to
social exclusion isn‚Äôt the whole story.
They are extremely useful for very many
people‚Äîthe worldwide image- and opi-
nion-makers. This is not a small elite or
oligarchy, since between 30 and 40 per
cent of the population in countries like
the United States and France belong to it.

identity which it called citizenship. And it
protected its citizens. But globalization
means the state can no longer guarantee
such protection or provide the meaning
necessary to foster citizenship.
Two reactions are possible to the buil-
ding of an inform ation society which
gives pride of place to competition. For
the strongest, those with money and
power, competition can give purpose to
their lives if they develop a totally indivi-
dualistic, even narcissistic and consume-
rist identity, becoming big earners and big
spenders. All networked societies are basi-
cally individualistic. It‚Äôs the liberal and
libertarian ideology of the dominant tech-
nical and economic elite.
But all around them, a whole mass of
people either lack the resources to
connect to this individualism or else reject
it. They give meaning to their lives by
building community identities. T h e y
build them on cultural practices which
express simple, sturdy values, such as
God, country, ethnic identity, land and
family. This makes them feel protected in
some way against the worldwide changes
over which they have lost all control.
But these identities are ambivalent. . . .
They can be open because they‚Äôre
engaged in dialogue with people who have
other identities. But they can be dogmatic
when expressed in a rigid, inward-looking
way which shuts out all other identities.
That‚Äôs the crux of the problem: everybo-
dy can‚Äôt be Argentine or Serb, Catholic or
Muslim, female or homosexual, so the
strong affirmation of a unique identity as
only for economic but also social, intel-
lectual and cultural creativity. As well as
generating social exclusion, the technolo-
gical revolution has creative and libera-
ting aspects that we should not ignore.
Such as?
The Internet has reduced the power
of governments and the big media mono-
polies to control people. One result is
more openness, especially where political
corruption is concerned. The powerful
are used to spying on ordinary citizens,
but now citizens can spy on the powerful.
Work can be more independent and pro-
fessional advancement more varied. We
don‚Äôt have to stay stuck for life in the
same bu r e a u c r a cy and only adva n c e
through seniority.The educational level of
women is rising to an extraordinary
extent (most university graduates in the
U.S. are now women, for example).Their
professional advance is continuing.
D i s c ri m i n ation is still there, but it‚Äôs
dwindling. It‚Äôs better than being shut
away at home.
One of the main points of your work 
is that the information society seems 
to harbour the seeds of opposition to itself. 
How is that?
The process is very complex. The
modern state‚Äîwhether liberal, socialist
or Marxist‚Äîhas been built on a denial of
basic and historical identities. The state
made the nat i o n , not the other way
round. But it also managed to fuse these
original identities into a new abstract

each, the result of 12 years‚Äô interdisciplinary
research which took him all over the world. He
says the structure of industrial society‚Äîits econo-
mies, political units, industrial complexes and cul-
t u ral identities‚Äîalways revolved round centra l
points but that these are now disappearing. In
what he calls the ‚Äúinformational society,‚Äù a system
of networks develops in every sector. ‚ÄúThe power
of flows overwhelms the flows of power,‚Äù he says.
Such iconoclasm is the product of an unusual
intellectual journey. In 1962, the 20-year-old Cas-
tells, ‚Äúa shade Marxist but not Leninist‚Äù and to a far
greater extent ‚Äúanarchist and libertarian‚Äù, left his
native Spain to study in France. He was expelled
from France in May 1968 but returned two years
later.
By chance, he gravitated towards urban socio-
l o gy and became one of its leading exponents. His
La Question urbaine ( 1972) was translated into 10
languages, and The City and the Gra s s ro o t s won the
C. Wright Mills Prize in 1983 for the best social
science book published in the United States. To d a y
he is professor of sociology and city and regional
planning at the Center for Western European Stu-
dies at the University of California at Berkeley.
A friendly and persuasive man, with an impish
sense of irony, Castells refuses to act the guru and
points out that his work has limits. ‚ÄúEvery time an
intellectual has tried to answer the question ‚Äòwhat
should we do?‚Äô it‚Äôs led to disaster,‚Äù he says. n

Identity (1997) and End of Millennium (1998).

### Manuel Castells: the citizen versus the machine
October 1999 -The UNESCO Courier 49
T A L K I N G  T O ‚Ä¶
the only way to give meaning to one‚Äôs life
leads to fragmentation into tribes, to a
sort of collective atomization.
The only answer to this major threat is
to build bridges between these very diffe-
rent identities.The main challenge for the
state is to establish not only a political
contract between citizens but a cultural
contract so that all these cultural codes
and multiple identities can communicate
with each other. Only with such a
contract can a state guarantee the coexis-
tence of these identities while recognizing
their individual expression. But in view of
the state‚Äôs historical mode of construc-
tion, it is ill equipped to do this.
In view of this dual threat of exclusion and
fragmentation, how can a shared awareness
develop and lead to global political action?
This is the key question and I don‚Äôt
have an answer. I‚Äôve based my work on
observation, which isn‚Äôt forecasting.What
I see is a lot of resistance to the grip of the
network system. Some of these networks
no longer obey any human logic whatsoe-
ver: they have become what I would des-
cribe as automata.
The best example is the world finan-
cial market. It controls everything and no
one controls it, not even governments.
First, it pools together money from all
kinds of ori gi n s , not just fin a n c i e rs ‚Äô
money but everyone‚Äôs, including our own
(in the form of savings or pension funds).
Computer programmes and electrical cir-
cuits then keep it constantly mov i n g
around. Finally, and above all, it obeys
rules which are only partly economic,
because what I call information turbulen-
ce plays a crucial part. Various players,
including political players, send messages
and create images which lead a multitude
of other players to react in the financial
market. But they don‚Äôt act in concert and
no one can say for sure how the market
will react. M a ny playe rs , some more
powerful than others, can thus influence
the world in which these financial tran-
sactions take place.They can follow stra-
tegies, but nobody can control the process
or the outcome of the game. An automa-
ton has been created.
So what happens to politics?
Today politics are not defined by the
media but within media space, which is
occupied by the countless and ever more
varied television stations and, increasin-
gly, the Internet.So what comes into poli-
tical existence‚Äîin other words what
forms into a political opinion in people‚Äôs
minds‚Äîdepends solely on what appears
in the media. Traditional political stake-
holders are adapting to this new media
context. But they don‚Äôt play leading roles
in it at all.They‚Äôve been joined by a mass
of lobbies, interest groups and professio-
nal organizations which specialize in crea-
ting and manipulating messages and
images.These groups create new inform a-
tion turbu l e n c e , which stems from their
d e t e rmined strat e gies and how indepen-
All netw o r ked societies 
are basically individualistic. 
It‚Äôs the liberal and liberta r i a n
i d e o l o gy of the dominant
t e c h n i cal and economic elite.

dent the media are. But the final political
result‚Äîthe impact on decisions citizens
take‚Äîhas no relation to the wishes of each
of the playe rs. I t ‚Äôs the ‚Äú a u t o m at i c ‚Äù result of
interactions that nobody can control.
How do people react to this ‚Äúautomatism‚Äù?
I‚Äôve noticed they do two things. First,
they vote to express their opposition.The
main changes brought about by elec-
tions‚Äîcaused by shifts of mood among
only 5-10 per cent of voters‚Äîare the
result of opposition to a past event or
decision, not of support for a future poli-
cy. Such protest votes show that citizens
feel on the defensive towards the political
system. Secondly, they rate the system‚Äôs
players right at the bottom of the league
table of what they respect in society.They
think they‚Äôre corrupt, expensive and inef-
ficient.As a result, more and more people
are ceasing to see politics as a way of
changing their lives.
What about those who do want to change
things? 
Our generation has been conv i n c e d
t h at the state is the main instrument for
applying a political programme which
meets the expectations and needs of civil
s o c i e t y. But what can the state do today
faced with the financial machine and the
media machine? It has extremely limited
room for manoeuvre. People who want to
change things or do more in life than just
e a rn money are developing a new way of
conducting politics, this time without any
m e d i ation from the stat e . They have come
to act politically by taking pragmatic ethi-
cal action, working to bring about real
change in a small geographical area, at a
s p e c i fic time or in a limited fie l d . Of cour-
se such an approach only brings about ve ry
small changes in comparison with all the
changes that are necessary, but at least it‚Äôs
e f f e c t i ve . I t ‚Äôs a practical policy designed to
b ring immediate results. S u c c e s s f u l
examples of this approach include NGOs
like Doctors of the World and the Jubilee
2000 move m e n t , which has achieved sub-
stantial results in its campaign to alleviat e
the debt burden on the poorest countri e s.
Can such a piecemeal policy make a dent in
this big issue?
My bet is that all these piecemeal and
isolated activities,which involve hundreds
of thousands of people, will gradually
come together to form networks. I hope
the growth of networks will eventually
include those which want to fight the
harmful effects of other networks. That
alongside the networks of money, techno-
logy and information, alternative but just
as powerful (and so just as efficient) net-
works will develop and convey alternative
values that will steadily build new global
political strategies.
But some fundamental trends are
emerging even before we reach this final
stage. Look at the women‚Äôs movement. It
managed to set off the biggest cultural
r e volution in human history without
using traditional political means.
However, the changes in cultural prac-
tices and codes, first inside wo m e n ‚Äôs
minds, were so far-reaching that they‚Äôve
now been incorporated into political sys-
tems, at least where those systems are
dynamic and democratic. n
