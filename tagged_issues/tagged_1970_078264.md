Iron Age 'Roundhead'
Curved motifs on this Irish bronze disk (2nd century A.D.) give it the appearance of a rotund human face. The
purpose of the disk is unknown, but its non figurative and geometrical designs are typical of the Celtic "La Tène "
style which reached Ireland a few centuries before the Christian Era. Decorative art in Ireland was completely
reshaped by the impact of Continental Iron Age art and particularly that of the "La Tène " culture (named from
the famous archaeological site at Lake Neuchâtel, Switzerland). "La Tène" art combined three traditions: an
ancient geometric art, the animal art of the steppes and motifs from classical art.

### 56924: The Harsh facts of the 1960s
The crisis in development
o THE HARSH FACTS
OF THE 1960s
October 24, 1970 marks the 25th
anniversary of the United Na¬
tions. As the world commemor¬
ates this event, international
co-operation for economic and
social development in the Third
World is approaching a criti¬
cal juncture. Dr. Malcom S.
Adiseshiah, Deputy Director-
General of Unesco, sets forth
in the following pages his analy¬
sis of the situation as this
year sees the close of the U.N.
Development Decade of the
1960s and the start of the
Second Development Decade of
the 1970s. Dr. Adiseshiah, who
has just completed a major
study on the role of education,
science and culture in develop¬
ment entitled "Let My Country
Awake," published last month
by Unesco (see inside back
cover), presents here his frank
views regarding the successes
and setbacks of the past Decade
and the action he feels is ur¬
gently called for to meet the
problems of tomorrow.

HE simplest and most
awesome expression of today's deep-
rooted crisis In development is the
fact that the gap in the standards of
living of the rich one-third and the
poor two-thirds of our world is grow-'
¡ng wider every day and in every way.
Let us take just the dollar expression
of this living differential. The rich
countries have during the Develop¬
ment Decade of the 1960s Increas¬
ed their per capita income by four
per cent annually ($292), while the
poor countries have increased theirs
by two per cent ($12). But these
aggregates do not tell the real story.
If these trends persist, a person in the
United States will earn $10,000 annually
by the year 2000, while an African,
Indian and Pakistani will double his
income from $100 to $200 by 2119,
and an Argentinian or Uruguayan will
double his Income from $500 to $1,000
by 2009.
Our normal working tools do not
seem to be able to explain and resolve
this paradox. The abstract economic
models are unable to guide policy as
between injecting mere physical
capital or improving human resources,

### 56924: The Harsh facts of the 1960s
CRISIS IN DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
Galbraith's air-conditioned nightmare
between balanced development or
Induced growth, between, commodity
agreements or competition In the open
market.
The gap we have always had. "The
poor are always with us." With our
current dedication to development, it
has become a crisis point. But the
nature and dimension of the crisis have
further changed. The daily widening
of the gap transforms a factor of ine¬
quality into a judgement of iniquity,
a crisis of development into a crisis
of the conscience.
Another simple expression of the
crisis is what has happened to the one
per cent target that rich countries
should contribute at least 1 per cent
of their national income to develop¬
ment in the poor countries recom¬
mended by the World Council of
Churches in 1958 and later endorsed
by all Intergovernmental bodies
United Nations, Unesco, the U.N.
Conferences on Trade and Develop¬
ment and the Organization for Eco¬
nomic Co-operation and Development.
The tragedy is that before this
decision was solemnly made, the
transfer of resources to the poor
countries had reached the one per
cent target ($8,000 million in 1961). It
became stagnant In 1967 at 0.68 per
cent and has declined to 0.64 per cent
in 1968. If interest and amortization
payments from the poor to the rich
countries are deducted, the public aid
is $6,300 million or 0.4 per cent.
In fact, if all net interest and
dividend payments to the rich countries
are allowed for, the flow becomes
negative in the case of Latin America.
This means that of some $600,000 mil¬
lion by which incomes have increased
in the rich countries during the decade,
not a dollar has gone to aid the poor
countries. The present transfer has
been compared to the annual expen¬
ditures by the rich countries of $35,000
million on liquor and $15,000 million
on cigarettes, and the mad $200,000
million on armaments.
T
HE development crisis is
world wide, and its tentacles reach out
to all lands, rich and poor. The rôle of
the family as the basic unit of society
is disintegrating everywhere, the youth
revolt being but one expression of it.
Urban slums, the pollution of the air
and water and the use and misuse of
science and technology are universal.
John Kenneth Galbraith whimsically
presents another side of this haunting
crisis in his book "The Affluent
Society":
The family which takes its mauve
and cerise air-conditioned, power-
steered and power-braked auto
mobile out for a tour passes through
cities that are badly paved, made
hideous by litter, blighted buildings,
billboards, posts for wires that
should long since have been put
underground. They pass on into
a countryside that has been render¬
ed invisible by commercial art.
They picnic on exquisitely packaged
food from a portable ice-box by a
polluted stream and go on to spend
the night at a park which is a
menace to public health and
morals. Just before dozing off on
an air mattress beneath a nylon
tent, amid the stench of decaying
refuse, they may reflect vaguely
on the curious unevenness of their
blessings.
Similarly, the family and other
valuable institutions in the poor
countries are being damaged by the
process of development which is
essentially an unhappy form of mimi¬
cry, called westernization, since air-
conditioners, power-steered cars, ice¬
boxes and nylon tents on which
Western nations rank high have a ten¬
dency to be picked up as development
indicators in those countries.
A
LT the social level, the de¬
velopment picture presents equally
disturbing features, which are hidden
by the statistical aggregates that we
employ 6 per cent G.N. P., 10 phy¬
sicians per 10,000, 2 cinema seats for
100 people. If we look behind these
averages, we will find that in many
countries what little growth has been
registered is at the cost of distribu¬
tional justice. In fact the countries
with the highest growth rate have had
an unequal sharing of the benefits
among their people.
In some of the poor countries,
therefore, a kind of fatalistic social
philosophy Is spreading that the price
of economic growth is disparities In
incomes and that such concentration
of incomes In a few hands is needed
for increased savings. In actual fact,
large and growing income disparities
have not stimulated growth. They
have on the contrary acted as a
powerful disincentive to growth and
have channelled investments in luxury
goods production, corruption, tax
evasion and expatriate capital flows.
At the back of these social problems
is the lack of public participation in
policymaking and development plann¬
ing. A general norm of modern
government policies should surely be
to decrease correlations between
ascribed characteristics such as race,
sex, caste, class, religion and region
and achieved characteristics such as
position, income, power and education,
preferably to zero.
The most serious aspect of the
crisis Is the failure of the developing
countries to create meaningful employ¬
ment. That is the most tragic failure
of the world development situation.
It has been computed that in the
nineteen seventies there will be
300 million young people entering the
labour market of the poor countries,
for two-thirds of whom jobs do not
exist and will have to be created.
The equivalent in the developed
countries will be merely replacing
those retiring.
Today, 20 per cent of the entire
male labour force in the developing
world is unemployed. This fast
growing unemployment trend is due
to the rate of population growth and
the economic growth policies followed
by the poor countries In the fifties and
sixties. Increased child survival and
longevity have increased labour
supply.
High Gross National Product growth
rates have not helped create adequate
employment in countries like Pakistan,
Rep. of Korea and Venezuela. In
fact the tragedy is that higher growth
rates achieved through expanding the
industrial sector, increasing labour
productivity and using capital intensive
and labour saving techniques, made
falsely attractive by low interest and
exchange rates, cheap machine imports
and unrealistically high wages, have
not expanded job opportunities ade¬
quately.
These wage rates attract labour
from the rural sector and in the
absence of labour intensive, export-
oriented occupations result in massive
urban unemployment. The scarcity of
middle-level skills makes for large-
scale unemployment of unskilled or
semi-skilled labour in the ratio of 1: 10
or 12. As has been pointed out, the
irony of the unemployment crisis is
that there is no need for it. There is
enough unfinished business to keep
everyone employed.
Y
ET the crisis I have tried
to portray arises out of a historic and
positive situation. One hundred coun¬
tries, constituting two-thirds of the
people of the world, have made their
choice for development. Included in
this one hundred are 65 new nations of
Africa and Asia. "You have helped us
win our political liberation," said a
Chief of State to me, "now you must
walk along with us on the long, weary
but exhilarating path of economic libe¬
ration." The work of development has
begun: it will not be finished in a day "7
or a year. This is work for this cent- /
ury and beyond.
In opting in favour of development,

### 56924: The Harsh facts of the 1960s
CRISIS IN DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
The growing spectre of unemployment
did the poor countries have a real
choice? I have constantly faced this
question when visiting Member States,
working on their rural programmes,
helping them in the planning of a train¬
ing activity or in designing a research
project.
On one such occasion, at the end
of a long and weary day, when the
people and the United Nations team
had worked on the modalities of a
tightly scheduled renovation pro¬
gramme, the village leader asked me
how he could help explain and re¬
concile this proposed action vis-à-vis
his fairly happy and contented fellow
villagers, whose culture, in conse¬
quence, included the wisdom: "If ever
the feeling to work hard begins to
overcome you, just lie down, and the
feeling will pass away."
In India, Gandhiji expressed this
thought even more brutally: "Our
peasant earns his bread honestly," he
wrote. "He knows fairly well how he
should behave towards his parents,
his children and his fellow villagers.
He understands the rules of morality.
But he cannot write his own name.
What do you propose to do by giving
him a knowledge of letters? Will you
add one inch to his happiness?"
A
8
Lshort time ago I was again
involved in a discussion of this fun¬
damental option in an Arab country,
whose people have maintained their
basic features of fierce pride and
passionate loyalty, unforgettlng hostil¬
ity and confident trust, wide ine¬
qualities and an abiding religious faith.
We were drawing up a detailed plan
to train their own geologists to take
over responsibility for exploiting the
mineral-laden countryside.
The social change and cultural dis¬
ruption being brought about by this
and other programmes were fully and
freely debated and the conclusion to
which all In the group agreed was:
"Development is here to stay; it is
on us and around us; we have to live
with it and accept the changes in our
society and culture that it brings; we
have no choice in the matter." This
conclusion is a representative sample
of what is common to the development
option by the underdeveloped world:
namely the resigned and passive
acceptance of change, whereas de¬
velopment demands planned and
induced change.
This development option of the poor
countries has come to be expressed
through planning, which as a social
technique has gained universal accept¬
ance. Such planning has often times
been no more than a set of mathema¬
tical targets or accounting techniques.
It has not comprehended the larger
social, human and Institutional prere¬
quisites for development, which can
only be dealt with by development
policy. It has been weak on the
implementation and project preparation
side and has barely covered the dy¬
namic private sector.
Even so, the record shows that the
growth rates it generated represent
a break from stagnation and inertia,
an increase in the productive capacity
of the poor countries and a tool to
initiate wider and more complex pro¬
grammes. Above all, it raised savings
and investments to levels unknown in
earlier times. Eighty-five per cent of
all their investments was from domestic
savings. Given the low income level
of the poor countries and how near
the margin its people live, this is a
proud and heroic record.
T
HE most spectacular
achievements have been in the field of
education. Free and universal educa¬
tion has been accepted in all poor
countries. The initial reluctance of
parents in rural communities to forego
earnings of child labour, itself a back¬
wash of poverty and exploitation, has
yielded to the social prestige and
economic value of education. Recent¬
ly, I was in five countries where the
net growth of the population had fallen
to 1 to 2 per cent in three years and
where the reason given was universal
primary education and the absence of
illiteracy.
On a world scale, enrolments in
schools and universities have tripled
between 1950 and 1965. Two hundred
million adults were made literate
during the period. The annual rate of
growth of educational expenditures
between 1960 and 1965 has been
13 per cent in Asia, 16 per cent in
Africa and over 20 per cent in Latin
America. National plans for- science
and technology are under preparation.
The poor countries are devoting 5 per
cent of their national income to educa¬
tion, compared to 7 per cent by the
rich countries.
But this quantitative expansion of
education has been accompanied
by a sad qualitative deterioration.
Schools and university facilities are
used only for 25 per cent of the day,
educational drop-outs and repetition
leading to wastage average 50 per cent
of those enrolled, and the curricula,
techniques and streams of specializa¬
tions have little relation to personal
development, the environment and the
employment profile of the country.
In the health field, the achievements
amount to a miracle. Epidemics and
disease vectors have been controlled.
Mortality from plague was reduced
from 17,000 In 1951 to 47 in 1966,
cholera from 63,300 to 4,400 and small¬
pox from 226,000 to 12,200. Here
there has been a direct benefit to the
individual in the poor country. Life
expectancy at birth has been raised
very fast.
In the five countries that I have
referred to earlier, the mortality rate
from 0 to 5 years of age was less than
two per thousand. In human terms
this is the most convincing demonstra¬
tion of the power of applied science.
All would benefit if the lawlessness of
the world were reduced and man's
energies turned from the preparation
for war to the works of peace.
In agriculture, production barely
kept pace with population growth and
in many areas fell alarmingly behind.
The most Important lesson that we
have learned In this decade is that
agricultural expansion and renovation
are vital to the entire development
process and that there is nothing
automatic in achieving such adjust¬
ment.
Instead of being a net exporter of
14 million tons of cereals as it was
in the thirties, the developing world
became a net importer of 11 million
tons in the sixties. This led most
countries to revise their agricultural
policies for it was realized that there
were not enough foodstuffs for their
industrial workers, that there was less
employment, less Income, less savings
and less foreign exchange earnings.
E
I VEN more serious was the
human aspect; there were 500 million
hungry people and in a decade there
would be 600 million more, all living on
subhuman nutritional and protein intake
levels with all their consequences on
body, mind and soul. A change was
urgently needed. Following, therefore,
the focus on revised policies, a good
part of the developing world is now
experiencing a major breakthrough in
food production, called the "Green
Revolution".
This leap forward has been possible
through inputs of improved varieties
of rice and wheat strains, fertilizers,
irrigation, agricultural extension and
education. In 1968-1969, India's food
output was about 8 million tons above
the previous record of 89 million tons
in 1964-1965. Pakistan increased its
wheat production by 50 per cent in
two years. In non-cereal production,
similar advances have been registered
in sugar, coffee, tea, etc. Prospects
for growth, therefore, look much
brighter now that It has been demons¬
trated that the peasant is like all of
us, who laughs when he is tickled,

Some countries tend to measure development in terms of air-conditioners, automobiles,
refrigerators and other consumer goods considered as "prestige" objects.
cries when he is hurt and responds in
a normal way to costs, prices and
credit.
This agricultural breakthrough is
therefore not the result of magic. It is
one part of the total technology which
includes water management, land
reform and development, fertilizers,
pesticides, rural roads, regional centres
for storage, marketing facilities and
credit resources, all of which must
now move ruthlessly forward.
Further, it is important to ensure
that we do not get lost in the clouds
of the new agricultural technology and
allow them to push out the small
farmer and so Increase income dis¬
parities and create a new class of
landless city proletariat. In India, out
of 50 million farms, 30 million are
below 2 hectares covering, however,
only 1/6 of the total farming area of
130 million hectares. The small
farmer who Is caught in the vicious
circle of .fragmented holdings, in¬
security of tenure, lack of credit
facilities, unsatisfactory marketing and
untimely supply of inputs, has no profit
margin to share in the new technology.
Case studies in India show that
such technology requires him to spend
four times more than he does on
manures, one-and-a-half times more on
irrigation charges, six times on im¬
proved seeds and twelve times on
pesticides. So the new technology is
pushing up land values and the tragic
biblical drama of Ahab the King going
down to the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite "to take possession of it"
Is being repeated.
A further valuable lesson which has
been gradually learned during the
decade Is that there is no opposition
between agriculture and industry.
Their complementary and supplement¬
ary rôle was, during this period,
brought out by the fact that where
the parents work at yokes for their
oxen, gather manure, carry water,
winnow grain and weave their cloth
and baskets all by their hands, their
children work in industry producing
tractors, fertilizers, pumps and pipes,
meal and flour, cement and silos.
The industrial growth in the poor
countries has registered an overall
rate of 7 per cent compared to 6 per
cent for the world as a whole. This
gain has been registered despite
numerous handicaps such as shortage
of foreign exchange and domestic
skills, the small scale of the domestic
markets and the trade barriers erected
by the developed countries.
But now Industrial policy in the poor
countries has come to the end of the
line and needs recasting. The possi¬
bilities of import substitution have been
largely exhausted and the countries
face a very real danger of producing
high cost, inefficient goods behind
their high tariff walls. Protection in
these countries today Is simply a
contribution to high-cost domestic
structures.
The infamous illustration of this
trend is that In 1965, the poor countries
spent $2,100 million of their domestic
resources to manufacture cars and
automative products, which had an
international valuation of only $800 mil¬
lion. This one-year waste of $1,300
million, which is more than the World
Bank's 23-year total of investments in
industry, is a drastic reminder, if
reminder there must be, of the need
for a revised industrial policy based
on careful choice of technology,
export-oriented manufactures and
exploration of all available outlets.
The most Important external factor
which has determined (undermined in
fact) the development of the poor
countries has been their share in world
trade. And here the share of these
countries has declined steadily from
27 per cent in 1953 to 19 per cent in
1967, and even In primary products

### 56924: The Harsh facts of the 1960s
CRISIS IN DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
The dilemma of birth rates
and economic growth
10
in which they have an absolute and
comparative advantage there was a
decline from 54 to 42 per cent. In fact
in 1967, the developing countries did
not increase their trade by even 2 per
cent of the total.
The ratio of their exports to Gross
Domestic Product (G.D.P.) is around
25 per cent, a good indicator of their
heavy reliance on world trade for their
development. Their trade and exports
have fallen steadily because of internal
causes such as reliance on single
export items and production lags, but
even more because of falling inter¬
national prices for their products and
the trade policies of the developed
countries.
In the developed countries the pre¬
ference patterns of consumers, tech¬
nological Innovations and official
production and trade policies have all
meant that while the price of the
exports of the developing countries
continue to fall, thus reducing their
share of world trade and their export
earnings, the prices of capital goods
the latter import rise, thus worsening
their terms of trade. Hence, the trade
policy of the developed countries is
far more decisive than their aid policy
for the development of the poor
countries.
And so it is a pity that while U.N.
Conferences for Trade and Develop¬
ment (UNCTAD) have laid down
very good general principles, they
have not worked out a programme of
action by the developed countries to
promote duty-free, non-reciprocal pre¬
ferential imports of primary products,
manufactures and semi-manufactures
from the poor countries, the building
up of buffer stocks and the develop¬
ment of compensatory finance. At
UNCTAD II in New Delhi the
developed countries were instead
preoccupied with their domestic prob¬
lems of liquidity, budgetary resources
and balance of payments. A buoyant
world trade is surely the real answer
to these real concerns.
The world development situation
presents overtones of tragedy in
regard to population. No other facet
casts a darker shadow over the pros¬
pects for international development
than this question of the number of
men, women and babies. And let me
make it quite clear that I approach
this urgent and complex issue from
the point of view of the sanctity of the
human person, the dignity of man and
the rights to life, liberty and well-being
vested in him.
Control over disease vectors, as we
have seen, has diminished death rates,
and for this great humanistic achieve¬
ment we should all lift our hearts and
minds In thanks. The birth rates being
unchanged, the result is an unprece¬
dented upsurge of the population of
the developing countries which is In¬
creasing twice as fast as that of the
developed countries.
The annual Increase of the poor
countries, which was 15 million in
1930 to 1950, rose to 28 million in 1950
to 1960 and 37 million in 1960 to 1965.
The resulting demographic trends are
staggering, the world population in¬
creasing from 3,600 million in 1970 to
4,400 million In 1980 and 5,000 million
in 1985.
T
HE development results of
this astounding phenomenon will be
seen during the decade we have just
entered. They are simple facts: in¬
jurious Incomes distribution, rising
land values, increasing unemployment,
further lowering of low nutrition levels
and the depression of wages. All
these will add to the crying problems
of our youth, education and the cities.
Policies to spread family planning
have been introduced in countries
representing 70 per cent of the popu¬
lation of the developing world. But
these programmes to bring fertility
rates into more tolerable balance with
new mortality experience, face a time
problem as well as the physical prob¬
lem of availabilities and the psycho¬
social resistance to make the program¬
mes acceptable in rural areas.
In the meanwhile, two further demo¬
graphic factors demand our attention.
The first is the effect on the cities of
the "poor world which are rapidly
spawning a culture of poverty. In the
1950s, urban population increased by
50 per cent, it is now doubling and
by 2000 will increase bythe impossible
percentage of 500. One Indian city
will have over 30 million living in
its slums. Given the political attention
aroused by urban slums and the
neglect of rural poverty, is it more
than mere cynicism to conclude that
poverty seems to attract more atten¬
tion not only when it Is extreme but
also when it is visible?
The other is the increasing juvenes-
cence of the age structure of the
population. Generally, over 60 per
cent of the population of the develop¬
ing world is under 25. In one country
where I was recently, over 50 per
cent of the population was 18 years
and under. The minority which must
feed, clothe, educate and provide
moral care for the majority is shrinking.
It Is the quality, the spiritual life of the
next generation which is at stake.
A serious imbalance
in world trade is
compromising economic
progress in the
Third World. Poor
countries pay
increasingly higher
prices for much-needed
goods and capital
equipment while their
share of international
trade and the price of
their exports continue
to fall. Photo shows

W
W W HERE do we go from here?
As a result of the decision of the
comity of nations, we are now prepar¬
ing for the Second Development
Decade. This is to give us a second
chance to go on from where we stand
today. And the main outline of the
tasks for the developing and developed
countries, for our village world, the
world community, as one study terms
it, is emerging with startling clarity.
The developing countries are to plan
for an annual Gross Domestic Product
increase of 6 to 7 per cent, with the
resultant 3.5 to 4.5 per cent per capita
growth. This GDP Indicator must be
supported by a programme of income
distribution, structural change, land
reform and an employment and
population policy. The agricultural
sector must increase by 4 per cent to
sustain the 6 to 7 per cent rate, feed
the growing population, improve the
intake of proteins and nutritional
levels, ensure growing supplies of
raw materials for Industry, insulate
pressure on domestic prices and ease
the strains on balance of payments.
Agricultural growth must ensure the
participation of the small farmer in the
new technologies through the creation
of special institutions such as a
small farmers' development agency
which can help to convert the three to
five acre farm into a viable unit. If there
is an unavoidable short-fall In food
production, such as caused the two
famine years in India, the developed
countries must increase their food
assistance above the one per cent
target in order to avoid both bottle¬
necks to expansion and inequities In
welfare.
Industry, which is the sheet anchor
of modernization, must expand at an
annual average rate of 8 to 9 per cent.
There must be an appropriate expan¬
sion in the infrastructural network.
Consumption should rise at a slower
rate than GDP in order that a savings H -í
target of 15 to 20 per cent may be
attained. New employment opportuni¬
ties should be created through a
planned employment policy based on

CRISIS IN DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
the surplus and scarcity status of
factor supplies and using fiscal, monet¬
ary, trade and earnings incentives.
Education in all forms, which I will
return to later, must move forward in
quantity and quality calling for a 5 to
6 per cent expenditure of GDP.
Research and development must be
promoted, involving a further one per
cent. Health conditions must be fur¬
ther improved and a well administered
population control programme ensured.
At the national level, a new institu¬
tional framework for development
should be created through changing
attitudes, motivations, legislative re¬
forms and social services, which are
both the end and the means of
development.
The developed countries, on their
side, should expand their own devel¬
opment, aiming at an annual average
of 4 (3.7-4.2) per cent of GDP growth,
involving 3 per cent per capita. This is
their first task the war against their
own poverty pockets and areas of
deprivation begins at home but it
cannot stop there.
The most important contribution of
the developed countries to the devel¬
opment of the Third World is "in the
trade field. They must follow up the
Kennedy Round by giving preferences
to Imports from the developing
countries, through eliminating, or at
least drastically reducing their tariffs
and quotas. Such a move is in their
own interest as it not only ensures
comparative cost benefits, but also
reduces the high cost agricultural pro¬
ducts, manufactures and semi-manu¬
factures which exert an inflationary
pressure on their consuming public.
All this should result in an increased
capacity of the developing countries to
expand their imports by one per cent
per annum in order to sustain the 6 to
7 per cent target.
The debt servicing burden of the
poor countries casts a pall on all devel¬
opment perspectives. It was 4,700 mil¬
lion dollars in 1967, forming 15 per cent
of their exports (in the case of India
and Brazil it will reach 30 per cent)
and will move to 9,200 million dollars
in 1971. There is need for long-term
re-scheduling and re-financing of this
intolerable millstone at the start of the
Second Decade.
I
|N the aid field, the target
of one per cent of national income has
been agreed upon by all concerned,
involving 70 to 75 per cent of the tar¬
get in official government-to-govern¬
ment or multilateral aid, taking the form
of grants and soft loans. As the Pear¬
son Commission points out, this is no
give-away programme.
Given the form and purposes for
which It is made available, I have
serious hesitation in even using the
word "aid" in this context.
In one Member State, with a popu¬
lation of four-and-a-half million, foreign
aid programmes have introduced
20 different types of tractors (with the
result that no servicing and spare parts
industry is possible). They also pro
vide 50 per cent of the country's
investment, deciding the nature, rhythm
and timing of its development in
accordance with their domestic pro¬
duction schedules and profit potential.
These problems call for better co¬
ordination of aid and Increase in the
share of official aid, in other words
an improvement in the quantity and
quality of aid. One way of doing this
is to pledge ourselves to Increase the
quantity of official aid from the present
$6,300 million to between $16,000 to
$19,000 million by 1972-1975 and Im¬
prove Its quality.
Aid is neither a bribe nor a chari¬
table handout. Fundamentally, aid
policies are based on the hard fact
that we live in one shrinking world and
that every man's welfare is the concern
of all his neighbours.
The centre-piece to the international
frame for the Second Development
Decade is Man, the resources he
represents and the education he
demands. Let us not forget that the
purpose of all development is Man and
that he is its motive force and maker.
The Unesco doctrine is that the
essential instrument of such develop¬
ment is the continuing improvement
of the resources represented by the
whole population through the supply
of men and women who have been
educated, trained and harmoniously
integrated into the development move¬
ment.
This demands a global vision of the
entire educational system and all other
institutions involved in the develop¬
ment of human resources, science,

SCHOOL IN THE SAND. Children In most countries know sand as something to make castles out of, but for
these children in a Sudanese village it serves as a notebook on which to write out words and sentences they
have learned (photos above). Developing countries have increased their spending on education, but many millions
of children still lack classrooms, teachers and equipment. In contrast to the makeshift school above, youngsters
in this infant school classroom (below), in an industrially developed country, are introduced to "new mathematics"
concerned with theories of sets and relations which 20 years ago were reserved for research specialists.

### 56928: A Second chance in the 1970s
CRISIS IN DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
Towards a global concept of education
technology, information and culture.
Such a vision demands breaking away
from traditional tests and evaluations
and applying a wider systems analysis
approach, examining fearlessly all
operational relationships in human
resources development and applying to
it the principles of balanced growth.
The actual educational systems, as
they have evolved during the current
decade, with their wastages, imbalan¬
ces, irrelevancies, unused capacities,
obsolescences and unemployment end-
products, are knocking heavily at the
doors of the Second Decade.
I believe it is for us now to work out
new relationships between education
and society, over and above the usual
economic constraints and manpower
budgeting that have been imposed on
us. These constraints are in truth
based on the philosophy that human
development planning should be inte¬
grated with and subordinated to eco¬
nomic development planning.
A recent economic survey contains
the suggestion that in the interests of
increased productivity, the developing
countries must postpone the education
they need in favour of training and that
in order to offset the distorting
influence of the white collar profes¬
sions on the structure of education,
heavy, almost exclusive, emphasis
should be placed on science-based
subjects, engineering and what are
called practical skills that are needed
for a mechanizing society.
The truth is the other way around.
What is needed is a more differentiated
approach and, as appropriate, econo¬
mic planning should be integrated in
and subordinated- to the development
of human resources. The cure to
educated unemployment is not less
education so that there can be just
uneducated unemployment.
A
14
LS we have seen earlier,
there are no short-term remedies In
the economy for the growing unem¬
ployment problem. If, however, the
economy were integrated into the edu¬
cational system, instead of the other
way around, then the educated person
could and would create his own
employment, with some support from
the State and the private sector. The
supply of well-educated persons is
one of the most effective instruments
for enlarging employment and combat¬
ing unemployment during the Second
Decade. There is need for mutual
development of education and econo¬
mic strategies.
To further support this plea for the
two-way integration of economic
planning and human resources devel
opment, I refer to recent studies by
J.S. Coleman in the U.S.A. and T. Hu-
sén, in Sweden, which show that the
most important influence on student
performance in the school is not the
teacher and his qualifications (which
must always be high for quite other
reasons), nor the equipment in the
laboratories (which must always be
modern in the interest of scientific
truth) but the dynamism or stagnation
of the economic and social environ¬
ment in which the school is placed.
And this brings me back to the
social rôle and social demand for
education education being woven
into the development process and the
school and the adult education centre
being dynamic agents of change when
surrounded by a moving and growing
society. But this means that the impact
of education on society depends on
non-education on the other social and
economic institutions which can use¬
fully use the educational output and
induce a development-oriented peda¬
gogy. In this context, we are missing
spectacular development-directed op¬
portunities through the poor use and
misuse of our mass media which is so
largely devoted to indoctrination and
spurious entertainment.
Education must therefore be adapted
to each local society but equally it
must transform that society. And to do
this, education should become a life¬
long learning process (instead of being,
as it is, a life-long teaching and
cramming process), involving the ac¬
quisition of learning skills, of the capa¬
city to learn, so that the specific
training for specific employment, exist¬
ing, or induced, or created, can be
acquired flexibly as one goes along in
life.
The central concept of life-long
learning will call for fundamental chan¬
ges in educational philosophy and
educational aid and we must be pre¬
pared for them. International Education
Year 1970 inaugurated at the threshold
to' the Second Development Decade,
will see the elaboration and the start
of the application of the concept in
non-formal education, strategies in
innovation, the use of new techniques,
methods, curricula, together with new
concepts in educational planning, rang¬
ing from systems analysis to pro¬
gramme budgeting.
New learning systems need to be
conceived where the content and
method of instruction are relevant to
the spirit and the needs of the 1970s.
The only way to search for educational
breakthroughs Is to experiment and
to evaluate those experiments to take
risks on speculative programmes; to
try out new learning systems in both
in-school and out-of-school institutions;
to leave aside some of the traditional
impediments of academic pedagogy,
such as examination systems which
stress rote memory instead of ability
to solve development problems; to
channel today's splendid drive for
participation into self-help and self-
renewal learning patterns. In short to
innovatel But always innovation in the
direction of the liberation of talent and
Intellect, and in the direction of social
and economic justice so as to make
all development serve man.
W
ILL this at long last usher
in that technological revolution in edu¬
cation during the Second Decade,
similar to those which have swept
through health and agriculture during
the first? I fervently hope so.
The largest and most decisive contri¬
bution of education is in widening the
horizons of youth, in giving them the
capacity to adapt to the new human
condition, and by preparing them to
share in all innovative activities. Can
education fire their imagination at a
faster rate than that at which they are
setting fire to our educational struc¬
tures? We cannot, of course, orient
our youth in certain directions or give
them a free area for participation, If
all incentives are lacking, if they
observe that we do not practise that
which we preach, that the society that
we have created and dominate is
vastly different from our verbalization
of it.
We preach peace and make or con¬
done war. We talk about equality and
enjoy the fruits of inequality. We Insist
on vocational education but send our
own sons and daughters for a uni¬
versity classics degree. We cannot
effectively plan education for a so¬
ciety that cannot be imagined by our
young generation and does not call
for their total loyalty. May not then an
increasingly heavy focus on real
equality in educational opportunities
help form young men and women who
will transform our society?

Overcrowding is so serious in some schools for Palestine refugee children
that classes are run on a shift basis. Here, children change shifts at a
prefabricated school in the Baqa'a camp near Amman, Jordan. Over
220,000 school-age refugees in the Middle East attend schools run jointly
by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and Unesco. More than
83,000 children are in schools operating a double-shift system and over
10,500 go to school in tents or temporary buildings.

n the crowded refugee
camps of the Middle East, third gener¬
ation Palestine Arab refugee children,
born to parents who were themselves
born in these same camps, are now
beginning to learn to walk. Each year
more than 55,000 children are born to
refugee parents and these new births,
coupled with a fresh influx of refugees
following the Six-Day War of 1967,
have swelled the original figure
of some 900,000 Palestine Arabs
displaced by the war of 1948 and car¬
ed for by the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency (UNRWA) to over
1 ,400,000.
UNRWA was established in 1949 by

the United Nations to provide the
refugees with food, shelter, clothing
and health, welfare and educational
services.
Today approximately 700,000 of the
refugee population are under the age
of 18 and as a consequence the bur¬
den of the educational effort is
constantly expanding. It now swallows
up nearly 43 percent of UNRWA's
resources annually only slightly less
than is expended on rood, clothing
and shelter.
In the educational field Unesco has
an important role to play. It assumes
technical responsibility for the broad
educational programme and provides
the higher directing staff and a number
of experts who advise on the planning
and execution of the programme as a
whole and on the teaching of specific
subjects.
The joint UNRWA-Unesco education
programme now reaches some 297,000
children of whom over 220,000 are
taught In the 480 UNRWA-Unesco

schools that have been established In

Gaza Strip.

6 and 12 and those with a satisfac¬
tory scholastic record continue for a
further three years in the first-level
secondary schools. By a system of
payments to government and private
schools some 64,000 refugee pupils
receive additional upper secondary
education.
The refugees are hungry for educa¬
tion. Many of the schools are over¬
crowded and double shifts of pupils
are not uncommon.
But formal education In itself Is not
enough. An important feature of the
UNRWA-Unesco programme is the
technical and semi-professional train¬
ing provided at 12 special centres.
The courses, generally lasting two
years, cover a wide range of occup¬
ational training, turning out plumbers,
draughtsmen, hairdressers, laboratory
assistants, instructors, etc.
An Indication of the educational
effort being made is the fact that last
year over 7,000 candidates in the Gaza
Strip alone sat for their U.A.R. matri¬
culation examination. It was the first
time that examinations of this type had
been held since the Strip was occu¬
pied In 1967.
The holding of these examinations
involved Unesco in delicate negotia¬
tions and arrangements to collect the
examination papers from Cairo and
return the candidates' papers there
for marking. More than 5,000 of the
candidates were successful and in
February and March this year just over
a thousand of them set out on the
200 mile journey to Cairo, in five
convoys co-ordinated and supervised
by the Red Cross, to begin courses
in universities and other higher learn¬
ing institutions.
UNRWA is financed by voluntary
contributions from governments and
donations from voluntary organizations
and private individuals and, therefore,
cannot count on a regular and steadily
increasing income to meet its grow¬
ing needs. The rapid rise in the
refugee school population alone has
added some $5 million to the cost of
the UNRWA-Unesco education pro¬
gramme since the 1966-1967 school
year.
Clearly the need for an expanding
educational effort will continue to exist
so long as the problem of the refugees
remains unsettled, yet owing to short¬
age of funds the UNRWA programme
is in danger. The impact of any
substantial reduction in the Agency's
services will almost certainly fall
heavily on the education and training
programme, despite the tragic implic¬
ations which this will have for the
future of the refugee children.
As UNRWA's Commissioner-Gen¬
eral, Mr. Laurence Michelmore, told
the U.N. General Assembly in 1969,
"If education and training were to be
curtailed, the horizon of the refugees
would be even more limited and a
valuable form of technical assistance
to the Arab world would be lost."

In 1969, an archaeological expedition led
by Prof. A. Leskov excavated a Scythian
tomb in the Kakhovka district of southern
Ukraine which had escaped the attentions
of grave-robbers. It contained the
skeleton of a Scythian warrior, 520 gold
objects and countless other objects
of great historical value. The tomb is
considered to be the richest 5th century
B.C. Scythian burial ever discovered.

THE air traffic director of Moscow's Sheremetiev
airport looked askance at the two young men who stood In front of him, travel-
stained and red-eyed from lack of sleep. But there was an air of urgency
and determination about archaelogist Vasili Bidzilya and police lieutenant Vla¬
dimir Kapstov that lent authority to their demand for an immediate priority
flight to Leningrad for themselves and the battered suitcase which they
refused to put down even for a second.
A glance Inside the suitcase was enough for the airport official. Within
minutes the two men and their precious cargo were in the air and three
hours later they were unpacking their treasures beneath the- astounded gaze
of the Director of the Hermitage Museum, Dr. Boris Piotrovsky, whose eyes
widened as, one after another, gold-rimmed vases, a gold and silver bowl,
two drinking horns embellished with gold and silver, three silver vessels and
a bundle containing hundreds of small gold discs were placed on his desk.

customs "written" in gold and silver
by a master craftsman of the

decorative arts, and by a curious quirk
of history they have preserved for us
in their tombs remarkable examples of
Greek craftsmanship. From the
Chertomlyk tombs in the Rostov area

scenes from the life of the Greek
hero Achilles, which once embellished

### 56945: The Golden hoard of the Scythians
THE SCYTHIANS (Continued)
Faces of silver, garments of gold
It was a moment of unhoped for
triumph. Early In 1969, young archaeo¬
logist Vasili Bidzilya had been detail¬
ed to supervise the excavation of some
Scythian burial mounds, near the
Ukrainian village of Balki on the left
bank of the lower Dnieper, some
100 miles north west of the Crimean
peninsular. The mounds were threat¬
ened by the approach of the North
Rogachik irrigation canal system and
the excavation was thought to be me¬
rely a matter of routine. Vasili Bidzilya
could hardly have anticipated that he
would stumble across a treasure-trove
that would make his name famous.
Most of the objects found In the
"Gaimonov tomb", as it is now desig¬
nated, are unique specimens, although
they bear a close affinity with the
treasures found earlier at the famous
Scythian burial mounds of Chertomlyk,
Solokha and Kul Oba.
The Scythians were a nomadic
people who established their kingdom
In the area of the Black Sea, the lower
reaches of the Dnieper and the Don
and in the Crimea. They were skilled
horsemen and maintained their empire
from the 9th century B.C. until the
3rd century B.C. when they were gra¬
dually replaced by the Sarmatians.
Soviet academician Boris Rybakov
has described the discovery of the
Gaimonov tomb as "a great achiev¬
ement that will give fresh Impetus to
the whole study of Scythian culture."
Perhaps the most interesting find
is a gold and silver loving-cup on
which a bas relief depicts scenes of
military and diplomatic events in Scy¬
thian life. On one side of the cup are
seen two long-haired, bearded, seated
figures. They wear caftans of a pat¬
terned material, narrow trousers and
pointed boots secured at the ankles
by leather thongs. One Scythian
wears a sword belt, on which his
hand rests. The other holds a quiver
full of arrows while a bow and bow
case lie beside him. Each man has one
hand upraised and holding a whip.
By fashioning their hands and
faces in silver and their garments in
gold the craftsman has achieved a
luminous, vital effect. He has given
their faces a solemn, pensive expres¬
sion as though they were praying or
taking an oath. For sheer artistry
these are probably the finest portraits
of Scythians in existence and the lov¬
ing-cup is clearly the handiwork of a
master craftsman who was a skilled
sculptor with the eye and attention to
detail of an ethnographer.
Unfortunately, the other side of the
cup is badly defaced, but two seated
figures can be made out. They are
beardless and each has one arm
stretched out towards the other. One
of them has a goblet resting on his
knee. To their right a kneeling man
shields his face with one hand and
with the other proffers something to
his seated lord. To the left a figure is
to be seen drinking from a wine-skin.
With its six figures, who judging by
their accoutrements must have been
personages of considerable eminence,
this bas relief gives a fascinating
glimpse of a long-vanished world and
provides invaluable details of Scythian
weaponry and dress.
Vasili Bidzilya ended his investig¬
ation of the burial mounds by tackling
the largest kurgan, a man-made hillock
over a grave, on which a watch tower
is sometimes placed. The kurgan in
question measures some 30 feet in
height by 250 feet in diameter and is
surrounded by 70 smaller mounds,
some of which had been opened up
earlier. Working under Bidzilya's su¬
pervision, miners from the Zaporozhe
iron ore centre took 2 1/2 months to
remove half the earth mound on top of
the kurgan which was enclosed by a
low circular wall or kerb.
On the western slope of the mound
they found traces of a funeral feast
bones of sheep and horses, fragments
of broken amphorae, bridles and
arrow heads. At the base of the
mound were two entrances leading to
an underground chamber 25 feet below
the base of the mound. The excav¬
ators also found an entrance made
centuries ago by grave-robbers.
A careful inspection of the walls
of the vault revealed a niche contain¬
ing fragments of the alabaster facing of
a sarcophagus. A little farther on the
kitchen area was found with a selec¬
tion of cooking utensils including
bronze tongs for extracting pieces of
meat, a cauldron, a cooking pot, a tray,
a dish, a small bucket, a sieve for
straining wine, several clay amphorae
and a ladle for drawing wine. Lying
across the threshold of the kitchen
was the skeleton of a guard with his
lance and bow and arrows beside him.
When the plunderers of the past
had entered the tomb this area was
apparently blocked by earth, which had
fallen on the grave of a woman in
which were found her leg bones and
the remains of a pair of high leather
boots adorned with 43 gold triangular-
shaped plates.
Then, suddenly, one of the search¬
ers stumbled on a patch of softer
earth. A glint of gold set them digging
furiously and the cache which had
baffled the grave-robbers at last yield¬
ed up its treasure, including the lov¬
ing-cup described above. For eighteen
hours on end the exultant searchers
examined, catalogued and photograph¬
ed the treasure that had lain un¬
disturbed in the earth for 24 centuries.
The excavation of the Gaimonov
tomb has not yet been completed.
Three more burial mounds, Includ¬
ing the central one, have been found
and are being Investigated.
A museum Is to be erected on the
site of these discoveries and copies of
the most valuable objects will be put
on display. The earth mound over the
kurgan is to be replaced and the
ancient white stone kerbing that sur¬
rounds It is to be restored. Rising like
a pyramid out of the flat expanse of
the plain, the mound will continue to
mark the last resting place of Scy¬
thian warriors, a tomb which for their
descendants has provided a window
looking back on to the mysteries of
the past.
FROZEN TOMBS
OF SIBERIA
Near the point where the borders
of Russia, China and Mongolia
converge lie the frozen burial
barrows of Pazyryk. Unlike the
Black Sea Scythian mounds which
were topped with earth, the Pazyryk
barrows were covered with great
boulders. Rain seeped through the
boulders, was turned into ice by the
savage Siberian winter and convert¬
ed the tombs into huge underground
refrigerators. Although the tombs
were rifled by robbers in search of
gold, for 2,500 years a vast range
of articles remained ice-encrusted
beneath the soil in virtually pristine
condition. Uncovered by Soviet
anthropologist and archaeologist
Sergei Rudenko in 1947-1949, they
give us a picture of a horsebreeding
people living much like the Scythians
of the Black Sea area. The fasci¬
nating story of these tombs and the
Iron Age horsemen buried in them
is told in Sergei Rudenko's book
"Frozen Tombs of Siberia", recently
translated into English for the first
time by Dr. M. W. Thompson (see
Bookshelf, page 34).

a private place; see how he arranges

real distress, not just when an unthink¬

finds, but also when a well-meaning
mother tidies up the childish array,
destroying the spatial relationships he
has painstakingly established. It is
not only through his collection but
also through its structure as a model
of a new reality, that he seeks under¬
standing.
Similarly, consider the compulsive
ordering and arranging of objects in
the private quarters of the aged, as
they strive to maintain faith in a reality
long past. View, In this light, the
apparent chaos and random display
of objects in the private room of a

expressed in the need for a flexible
model which can be manipulated to
suit the whims of the moment as their
search for an identity a place in the

what collecting is all about.

been one of man's ways of coming
to terms with his environment.
First, let us consider the traditional
museum in these terms. Second, let
us look at the innovations of the last
twenty years and more which were
intended to give the traditional mu¬
seum relevance in the world of today's
audience and to democratize the
museum. Finally let us speculate on
the museum as Everyman's public yet
private environment for a personal
adventure in self-discovery and the
search for identity in a world of cons¬
tant change which is so easily per¬
ceived as chaos.
The traditional museum, and by this
is meant the so-called public museum
of the late nineteenth and early twen¬
tieth century, may have had any of
many origins. Rarely was it a museum
created in the public interest and
planned from its beginnings to serve
a mass audience. More often it was
a private, and possibly a highly artis¬
tic or individualistic collection, opened
to the public.
It may have been a private house,
modest or grand, opened to the public
by virtue of its history, its contents,
its past inhabitants, or failure to find
any other use for it. It may have been
a scholarly collection, the by-product
of research or exploration, opened to
the public by the political pressures
for democratization which, though
naive, were present even a century
ago.
The museum, before becoming
public, was the domain of its private
owner, a university, a church, a
society, or some other persons or
body which had neither created the
museum, nor organized it for effective
use of any kind, by a mass audience.
Even If it had been effective in its
private rôle as a collection or museum,
it was unlikely to be effective in its
new public rôle. I know, in fact, of
no instances where a private museum
became, in reality, a public museum.
I know only of private museums which
became open to the public. The dif¬
ference is important.
Where the private museum is open
to the public the visitor is told, "This
Is someone else's collection some¬
one else's model of their reality
which you may examine." When, on
the other hand, the museum is a public
museum, the visitor is told, "This is
your museum. This Is your collection.
Here is a sampling of a reality and a
view of the world which should have
meaning for you."
How often does the visitor find him¬
self in an alien environment In the
traditional "public" museum? How
often does he retreat to the world
outside our museum where he can find
in that familiar chaos more of rele¬
vance than was made accessible to
him within? And when he does linger,
how often is he finding, not meaning¬
ful relationships with his day-to-day
world, not understanding or revelation,
but rather re-enforcement for his fan¬
tasy world which he can artfully con¬
trive from our offerings?
The museum, as distinct from other
media of communication, depends pri¬
marily on things on real things
rather than on words or ¡mages or
symbols or replicas. The nouns of
the museum language are objects; the
relationships between objects are the
verbs. The adverbs and adjectives of
the language are the supplementary
media of print, graphic, sound, film,
colour and form in the object environ¬
ment, and so forth. This being the
case the prime requirement for the
organization and administration of a
museum is the person or persons who
know most about the things which
constitute the collection, or who know
best how to assemble and build the
needed collection.
These experts, the curators, are of
necessity at the core of all museum
organization. Without them and their
expertise the objects of the collection
cannot be encoded with the objective
and precise messages which are
required if the collection is to become
the meaningful sample of a reality
referred to above. It is the knowledge
of the curator, his researches and his
Insight, which permit the museum to
so present the object that it can speak
for itself.
Only the non-museums of the
twentieth century the exhibit and

Unlike the traditional museum,
often rigidly didactic in presenting
its collections, the modern "creative"
museum seeks to put the visitor
into direct contact with what it has
to offer and help him find in these
objects meaningful relationships
with his day-to-day world. Whereas
children have no difficulty in
making contact with objects, thus
lighting a spark of wonder and
curiosity (photo above), adults have
often become accustomed to regard
the label as a more important
source of information than the
object itself (left).

demonstration centres without research
collections or resources for original
research in their fields of interest are
free of this dependency on the curator.
They of course must assume a
parasitic rôle, being indirectly de¬
pendent on those museums which do
collect, research and publish and do
provide curatorial expertise. But
more of the new, non-museums later.
For the moment it is important to
consider the effect which this prime
dependence on the curator has had
on the organization and administration
of museums.
Since the curator was the authority,
and because there was usually no
other staff available, the curator
became not only the collector and
researcher, but also the interpreter.
It was he who designed the exhibition,
who determined the exhibition pro¬
gramme, who produced the interpret¬
ative label and prepared messages for
other supplementary media. It was
the curator who selected and arranged
the objects for public display and It
was often the curator who also gave
the guided tour and the lecture. Who
else? Was he not the authority?
Of course he was, but he was first
a scholar, and was being asked to
become a designer, an educator and
therefore the interpreter. With rare
exceptions he was untrained for these
rôles. In attempting to fill them he
had to fall back on what he knew
best which was the private language
of his scholarly discipline. The
galleries became elaborate, three-
dimensional expressions of nine¬
teenth century systems of the classifi¬
cation of knowledge. The interpreta¬
tion of the collections, rather than
relating to the experience of the
visitor, or to his values, related only
to the compulsive and obsessional
attempts of scholars of that time to
find understanding through ency¬
clopaedic exercises in the structuring
of knowledge.
In fairness it must be said that the
curator did not ask to be given
responsibilities for which he was un¬
prepared. Nor would it be fair to say
that all of them did not want to reach
their mass audiences. They simply
did not know how to go about it. The
situation was compounded by the facts
that exhibition design, education
through the exhibit medium, and other
museum skills recognized today, either
did not exist or were not recognized
during the first century of the period
under discussion.
In discussing the curatorial élite and
its effect on museum organization and
administration, it should be noted that
references to systematics, the obses¬
sional ordering of knowledge, or the
manifestation of curatorshlp as a three-
dimensional textbook, are not directed
towards museums of natural history
or of science and technology alone.
The history museum and the art
museum, including the museum of
contemporary art, fall prey to the same
ills as the others. Private codes are
in use in these museums as In the
others. The criteria for the selection
and organization of works of art or
for determining objects of historical
significance constitute a mystique
which may be even more threatening
and baffling to the visitor than that
which he encountered in the science
exhibit.
This situation has persisted through
the reluctance of the public to protest
it and the willingness of, governing
bodies to support It. Both have been
in awe of the mystique of curatorship,
both have been unprepared to admit
that the content of the museum is
meaningless and lacks personal
relevance. Thus, for many, the
museum is a fantasy playground, an
unreal world offering escapist ad¬
venture.

FINGERTIP
DISCOVERIES
Visiting a museum filled with exhibits
marked "do not touch" or locked
up in showcases is often a frustrating
experience for children. They need
to touch objects, to handle and explore
them from every angle (photo left), fn
museums which cater to this need,
playing or working with exhibits offers
children a "discovery in learning"
and an exciting experience. Right,
introduction to a new dimension in
sculpture an Alexander Calder mobile.
For others It becomes, after minimal
experience, a threatening environ¬
ment in which the frustration of
attempting to understand or to find
meaning in the incomprehensible leads
to anxiety. For a few, the upper-
middle class with higher education and
therefore some key to the secret
codes, it becomes a domain with class
and status connotations. It is this
segment of society which has, in the
past at least, tended to support the
traditional museum as described
above.
The last two decades, however,
have produced new forces and new
attitudes towards the democratization
of cultural resources and have brought
change. But since conferences are
still being held to discuss the rôle of
the museum In society, it would appear
that the changes of the recent past
have been insufficient.
If there Is one sentiment which has
been pervasive in the museum reform
movement of the past twenty years
it is a desire to be both wanted and
useful. Several trends are apparent:
M An open and uncommitted search
for the rôle of the museum in society.
An argument for the museum as an
integral part of the public education
system, yet to be fully appreciated
(financed) or exploited.
The development of popular pro
grammes, sponsored by museums but
not growing out of fundamental or
core programmes of the museum.
The rejection of traditional museum
functions (collecting and identification,
conservation, original research, publi¬
cation), and of the curator, in favour
of public exhibition and interpretation
largely dependent on media other than
the museum collections.
The development of children's
museums as a separate and quali¬
tatively different institution though
contained within the existing museum
organization.
The development of special mu¬
seums for the blind, the handicapped,
the poor, the oppressed, or for what
are often called "the culturally depriv¬
ed minorities."
While all of this has been in
progress (erroneously designated the
"museum revolution"), there have con¬
currently been both reactionary move¬
ments within the museum world and,
from without, an increasing public
demand for and use of museums (the
"museum explosion"). There has
been pressure from both the public
and government for democratization.
The picture is by no means clear.
I would suggest, first of all, that the
reforms have been well intentioned
but have been effected In the absence
of any real understanding of either
the nature of the very evident public
hunger today or of past failures to
satisfy the public appetite. The open
and uncommitted search for the social
rôle or function of the museum is a
long-standing need.
The argument that the museum is
properly a part of the formal education
system is, in my view, indefensible.
The museum, like the playground, the
concert hall, the theatre or the public
park must remain a private environ¬
ment for personal experience no
matter how greatly it may be shared
with others.
The museum's move towards inte¬
gration with the educational system,
I suspect, is primarily a result of the
fact that education in our society is
established; accepted, and was vir¬
tually immune from any general public
attack or criticism in the 1940s or the
1950s. Alliance with the education
establishment meant money, status,
and above all, an unquestioned social
usefulness. That, I believe, was the
attraction.
The objection, of course, is not that
museums are not educational. It is
that the museum achieves its edu¬
cational goals through a process alien
to the traditional school system.
Current innovation and research in
education may bring the two closer
together, but that does not justify the
ill-founded alliances of the past.

MUSEUMS FOR MODERNS (Continued)
The creative museum adventure in self-discovery
The development of museum spon¬
sored activities which are peripheral
to the essential programme of the
museum is not new. The 1950s and
1960s however produced a proliferation
of supplementary activities and some
museums, while remaining basically
unchanged, surrounded themselves
with: concert series, art and craft
classes, women's organizations, attrac¬
tive programmes of social events,
luncheon clubs for men, lecture series
and study groups, film and theatre
programmes, guided tours of foreign
countries, bazaars, auctions and
fashion shows.
A
26
LLL this might be commend¬
ed were it true that these activities
grew out of the museum's basic func¬
tion and social usefulness. The more
common pattern, I fear, has been for
the museum to become a recreation
centre, a social club, a school, a
college or a market place because it
did not know how to be a museum.
The defence that these added
attractions are necessary for fund
raising or for the involvement of new
audiences, or that they bring depth
and relevance to the traditional
museum programme is weak. It is an
admission that the museum, as a
museum, has been unable to win
public support, to create involvement,
to provide depth and relevance.
One of the most visible trends in
the "museum revolution" in North
America has been the creation of non-
museums, by which I mean exhibit
and activity centres concerned with
public education through the medium
of the exhibit, but without dependence
on collections of original materials.
There are centres of science and
technology, for example, which depend
almost entirely on audio-visual pre¬
sentations and apparatus which de¬
monstrates principles or processes.
Health museums are similar in that
they rely .primarily on the model or
replica. Some natural science mu¬
seums, especially those with industrial
sponsorship, tend to rely more and
more on audio-visual and graphic
media and less on collections of
original materials.
There is no criticism of this develop¬
ment Implied here, but it must be
remembered that an exhibit centre, no
matter how effective, is not a museum,
unless its primary medium is the
object, the collection, the sample of
reality, referred to earlier.
One regrettable aspect of the de¬
velopment of the new exhibit centres
is that they are frequently called
museums, and thus prompt compari¬
sons potentially as misleading as
comparisons between television and
film or between film and theatre.
Even more regrettable has been the
too common practice of publicizing the
exhibit centre, not in terms of its own
special values, but in terms of its
break from the "musty, dusty" museum
tradition. Museums may have brought
such negative comparison upon
themselves but the solution is not to
compete with the exhibit centre on its
terms but seek excellence In the
museum's own terms.
The exhibit centres arc popular, and
do appear to meet a real need in
informal education, especially in the
highly industrialized urban complexes.
But there is danger in the temptation
to imitate success for its own sake.
That danger is real for the many
museums which have to compete for
public funds in a political popularity
contest.
Something must be said of the
effects of the trends already discussed
on museum organization and adminis¬
tration. The most important effect
has been that greater status has been
gained by non-curatorial personnel,
and there has become the possibility
of a power-balance within the museum
organization.
The designers, educators and admi¬
nistrators gained control of a larger
share of budget and of programme
and became more powerful in the
organization. Conservators and other
highly skilled technical staff, registrars,
and librarians, demanded and got new
status and recognition.
I know of one museum where the
business suit or tailored dress was
once the mark of the curator. Female
clerical staff tended to wear smocks
and technicians and skilled tradesmen
wore white laboratory coats. The
white coat, however, seemed to be a
symbol of the scientist or scholar for
the visiting public. Soon curators
donned the white coat and the
technicians and tradesmen were given
buff-coloured coats. Female clerical
staff then abandoned their smocks
and while some blossomed, fashion¬
ably dressed, others adopted the
white coat.
One might have expected the
curators, or at least the director, next
to appear in a white coat with purple
hem, but the silly game never
advanced to that stage. Curators
returned to business suits and tailored
dresses. The point of the ancedote
is simply that the game of status and
the power struggle is both real and
transparent, and bears all the marks
of insecure and defensive behaviour
in the face of change.
The administration and organization
of museums was also affected during
this period by the establishment of
either new departments or the growth
of offices which had previously been
In the background. Some museums
set up public relations departments
and television offices. Education de¬
partments grew enormously. Member¬
ship secretariats and offices for the
planning of special programmes were
enlarged. Design departments, which
in some instances had previously been
no more than carpenter's shops
became design studios with large,
well-qualified staffs. The term "exten¬
sion" was often used to designate
departments responsible for the wide
range of activities supplementing the
museum programme. The lowly book¬
keeper's office became the Depart¬
ment of Administration.
The overall effect has been one of
confusion and at times open dispute.
Good public relations and publicity,
massive education programmes for
schoolchildren and appealing, if irrele¬
vant, adult programmes have all
appeared to be necessary to win
public support and to get public funds
from government. In some cases
these have been at the expense of
the essential museum functions, and
the curators have justifiably rebelled.
The enlarged organizations for admi¬
nistration have sometimes exceeded
need and become stifling bureaucra¬
cies. The desire for popularity has
often led to evaluations of success in
which gross attendance statistics
were given more weight than the
quality of the experience being enjoyed
by the visitor.
I
N summary, the organiza¬
tion and administration of museums
changed In two principle ways. First,
the non-curatorial staff of the museum
began to share with the curatorial
staff the direction of the institution,
although a harmonious balance of po¬
wer was seldom achieved. Second,
the administration concerned itself to
an Increasing degree with its public
and the building of an audience.
In my view this concern too often
related to the institution's emotional
need for acceptance or to the competi¬
tion for public funds, and related too
rarely to the public's need for the
museum as a unique learning environ¬
ment. The exceptions are those
museums created not for a mass,
broad-spectrum audience, but for
children and for certain minority
groups.
Although children's museums existed
in some centres long before the post¬
war period under discussion, and some
had won an enviable reputation, the

EXPLORING
THE WORLD
BEHIND A MASK
These three imaginatively designed masks
were among 200 works recently displayed at the
Museum of Man In Paris in an exhibition concerned with
African art. But they were not made by African
artists. The exhibition demonstrated the outstanding
success of an educational experiment in which the
Cantini Museum in Marseille collaborated with many
schools in the Provence region of south-eastern France.
In this French museum, collections of modern art
and temporary exhibitions are used as study and
discussion material by children and students aged from
5 to 20. This year, the children showed concretely'
and in highly individualistic ways how their knowledge
has been enriched by a museum exhibition of African
art, combined with their lessons on Africa. Using all
kinds of materials, children produced original works
that reflected their personal interpretation of African
art. These masks, for example, were fashioned by
15 and 16-year-olds, using nails and sieves (left), straw,
buttons and odds and ends of leather (below) and
cores from rolls of paper (below left). The experiment
showed how museums can open a meaningful
dialogue and participate directly in educational and
community activities. It also illustrates how the beauty
of a work of art in a museum can become the link
between children of today and peoples of
another age and culture.

V W ILL there ever be such a
person as International Man or Inter¬
national Woman? Someone whose
attitudes and beliefs are not enclosed
by national or racial boundaries? Some¬
one for whom words like "foreign"
or "alien" have been defused of
menace? Someone whose . values
have been formed specifically by the
international education he or she has
received? These are good questions
to ask in International Education Year.
Some answers may perhaps be
found in a new and major experiment
In international education The United

these colleges at St. Donat's Castle in
Wales which was opened in 1962.
I went to the London headquarters

of the project and to the college in
Wales to see and hear for myself.
The aims of the project were out¬
lined to me in London by an Irishman,
Robert Blackburn, who was the first
Director of Studies of the college and
now as Chief Executive Officer of the
project, works for Lord Mountbatten,
the President of the International
Council of the United World Colleges.
Robert Blackburn told me that the
United World College of the Atlantic
was the first of a number of such
colleges all based on a simple belief:
that international education is no
longer an expensive luxury but must
be made general In this century for
the sake of survival. The project aims
to use education to unite not divide
nations, to break down barriers, to
create new forms of international
education.
The plan is to set up a chain of
international colleges In Europe and
in other continents which will enter
young men and women of high ability
for their last two years of secondary
school. In these schools the organ¬
izers hope that students will discover,
by living and studying together,
common ideals based on service and
loyalty to the International community.
The intention is that they should then
return to their own countries, welcom¬
ing International diversity, convinced
that International problems must be
settled by reason and discussion; not
by force.
This is an Idealistic aim but if such
colleges could turn out each year
several thousand able and carefully
selected students, their influence
could be of lasting International value.
Half a dozen such Colleges could have
a major impact by the turn of the
century.
There are special practical needs
today for International education at

project of particular interest in Inter¬

### 56947: United World Colleges: a new concept in international education
A 13th century Welsh
fortress, St Donat's Castle
(left) is the setting for
the modern campus of
Atlantic College, a new
experiment in international
education. It is the first
link in a proposed chain
of international schools
United World
Colleges to be
established in different
parts of the world. Atlantic
College provides two final
years of secondary
education to 300 students
boys and girls aged
15 to 19 from 36
countries and every walk
of life. Its programme is
a working example of
international education and
co-operation. Right,

banqueting hall of
St Donat's, which has
been extensively restored.
Similar United World
Colleges are soon to be
set up in the Fed. Rep.
of Germany, Canada
and Singapore.
growing rapidly; increasing numbers
of international civil servants and
diplomats are moving around the world
with their families and have great
difficulty getting suitable education for
their children. They want to give
their children secondary education
in the country in which they are
based but university education at
home. The existing national educa¬
tional systems cannot meet these
needs. Also, international organiza¬
tions and businesses desperately need
staff with a genuinely international
outlook and training.
From what I saw, I believe that the
United World Colleges can help meet
these idealistic and practical needs.
The first United World College Is in
a fabulous setting a modern college
campus based on a 13th century castle
which was owned and extensively
modernized by the American millionaire
and newspaper owner, William Ran¬
dolph Hearst It was purchased by
a prominent French internationalist,
Antoine Besse, who donated it to the
college. Now it stands, spectacular
and secure, a medieval fortress
surrounded by ultra modern dormitory
blocks and academic buildings.
Terraced Elizabethan gardens lead
down to the rough and dangerous
waters of the Bristol Channel.
At St. Donat's the first experimental
phase of the United World Colleges
project has now been completed. By
September 1969 the first college was
at full strength with some 300 students
from more than 36 countries. The
United Kingdom provided one quarter
of the students, followed by large
groups from the Fed. Rep. of Germany,
U.S.A., Canada end Scandinavia.
Most other western European countries
are represented, and the first students
have been entered from eastern
Europe. Smaller numbers come from
Africa, South America, Malaysia and
India.
Here, in action, is a working example
of international education and co¬
operation. The students (boys and
girls) are mixed internationally in
classrooms and in the dormitory
houses where they live. English is
the common language and all students
must speak it well as it is their
language of instruction, their common
meeting ground. But in the corridors,
in the dining hall, in the coffee bar
you can hear any language from
Finnish to Swahili.
The study of modem languages is
particularly emphasized and all students
learn at least one foreign language.
The college has proved academically
to be an outstanding success and
already former students have returned
to more than 150 universities through¬
out the world.
A large group of these first students
at St. Donat's have been Norwegian,
and I had an opportunity to meet some
of them in Norway after their two
years at the college. They have come
back convinced internationalists but
none the less Norwegian for that.
The former students have just
started an Association Journal and the
first Dano-Norweglan edition has been
published. It Is clear their links with
their own culture and countries have
been strengthened not weakened by
this International experience: at school
in Norway one does not have to
explain and describe and defend ones
own country. At St. Donat's a Nor¬
wegian, Welsh or Polish student must
do just this.
Students who enter the college
(maximum age 17 1/2) must be of good
university potential. Most enter with
scholarships, financed by local educa¬
tion authorities for the British students,
by the State in some countries, and
private sponsoring groups in the
U.S.A. and several other countries.
This support from Ministries of
Education and Foreign Affairs, and
United World College National Com¬
missions has been essential as the
college ¡s a private foundation. It
ensures, through a competitive entry,
high academic standards, also a wide
variety of backgrounds among the
students from the sons or daughters
of Welsh miners and Greek taxi
drivers to the children of Scandinavian
shipowners and steel magnates from
the Ruhr. The daughter of a Nor¬
wegian carpenter is a student along¬
side the sons of the largest car
manufacturer in Italy and the leading
shipowner in Greece. This is no snob,
élite school except in terms of ability.
The range of nationalities, religious
belief and political allegiance Is equally
wide. There are students from
eastern as well as western European
countries; political refugees from
South Africa with the sons of European
settlers in Rhodesia; students from the
Arab states as well as Israel. This
is an adolescent U.N. in miniature.

UNITED WORLD COLLEGES (Continued)
We're all in the same boat
community is tough. Students choose
three or four major (Advanced Level)
subjects and then add four or five
subsidiary courses. Then there are
their afternoon "activities" which take
eight hours a week, followed by
evening lectures, seminars, debates,
college societies, evening tutorials.
A lecture by a representative from
the Soviet Embassy may be followed
by a symposium on the Middle-East
led by Jordanians and Israeli students.
An official South African lecturer will
be questioned by a Bantu student in
exile on a U.N. scholarship. Here
every political point of view is re¬
presented.
History is a central, subject in the
curriculum. Students bring the text
books used in their former schools;
there Is little agreement on the inter¬
pretation of the great issues of modern
history. What a Greek and a Turk
are taught about Cyprus, or what an
English and German student are taught
about Bismarck are still not the same
stories. In fact, so serious are these
variations that the college is going to
take on a major project in the com¬
parison of national history text books
as seen by the students from a
working level in an international
community.
w
30
HEN they first arrive, the
barriers and divisions between the
students are real and bitter; as real as
the divisions of our time. Therefore,
in addition to the international work
done in classrooms, debating hall and
dormitory, the college has designed a
special activities programme to further
its international purpose, based on that
most international activity of all the
saving of human life.
Therefore all students are taught
first aid and life saving and take part
in one of the college rescue services
Beach Rescue Unit, Cliff Rescue
Team or Inshore Rescue Boat Corps
or the Social Service Unit. This is no
playing matter, no schoolboy game.
These services are responsible to the
competent British national authorities
for the safety of the public along the
ten mile stretch of rocky coast of
which St. Donat's is the centre. They
have already answered 46 emergency
calls, have prevented many accidents
and saved 30 lives at sea, on the
beaches, or on the cliffs.
The skill and ambition of the
students is so great that one of them,
an 18-years-old Norwegian girl, Eli¬
zabeth Hostvedt, has qualified as the
first woman coxswain in the history
of the highly professional and rather
conservative British Royal National
Lifeboat Institution. (The college is
an accredited station of the R. N.L.I,
and operates its own small fleet
of inflatable inshore rescue boats
which are designed and built by the
students.)
The college rescue services were
one of the first voluntary services to
be called out to assist at the great
mining disaster at nearby Aberran
when a coal tip slipped and engulfed
part of the village and an entire
primary school.
The first college is now also becom¬
ing known as an important pioneering
venture in international education,
particularly for the work it is doing
with the International Baccalaureate
Office in Geneva, to establish an inter¬
national university entry examination,
which would be widely recognized
throughout the world.
No such examination existed when
the college started. However, it was
essential that all the students at the
college, irrespective of nationality,
should follow common programmes
leading to a single matriculation
examination. This was done by taking
the matriculation examinations of the
country in which the college is
situated (in this case British G.C.E.
Advanced Level examinations) and
then negotiating agreed additions with
ministries of education and universities
abroad so that students might be
excused their national matriculation
examinations.
These bilateral equivalence agree¬
ments were the college's first
piece of pioneering educational work.
However, it has been expensive in
time and money, infinitely complex
and only partially successful as a
number of countries have not accepted
G.C.E. qualifications, France and Bel¬
gium in particular.
However, all national examinations
are ill-suited to an international school
and therefore the college became a
founder of the International Baccalau¬
reate (I.B.O.). The teaching staff have
played a considerable part in develop¬
ing the programmes of the Inter¬
national Baccalaureate and the college
currently provides the majority of
students for the first trial examinations.
This I.B.O. experiment, which has
the full support of Unesco, has
created widespread interest in univer¬
sities throughout the world. Many
have already accepted the International
Baccalaureate as equivalent to their
own matriculation qualifications. The
college at St. Donat's intends to
change over to the I.B. course com¬
pletely from September 1971 and there
is no doubt that the I.B. will provide
the academic structure for subsequent
United World Colleges.
The interest which has been shown
in this pioneering work and the
success of the first college at
St. Donat's has revealed a wide
demand for international education at
this level, not just in Europe, but
throughout the world. Therefore,
the second phase of United World
Colleges development has begun: to
make the project multi-college.
For this purpose an International
Council has been set up under the
presidency of Lord Mountbatten (an
outstanding example of International
Man himself). In giving his' reasons
for taking on this major task of
establishing a chain of international
colleges throughout the world Lord
Mounbatten has said:
"I accepted this office because I
believe that this new venture In inter¬
national education can make a real
contribution towards international
understanding and peace; also because
in the present world situation educa¬
tion must now be harmonized as a
force to unite nations.
"I believe that education today
without some international element is
as outmoded as education which gives
no training in modern science or
technology."
N
lATIONAL committees have
already been set up in eleven countries
to further the project, mobilize public
interest, raise money and select
students. Active plans are now being
made for the next two Colleges in the
Fed. Rep. of Germany and North
America.
In the Fed. Rep. of Germany a
strong founding committee has been
established and there is widespread
interest and support.
In Canada a widely based national
committee with Mr. Lester Pearson
and Senator Donald Cameron is now
making active plans for the establish¬
ment of a North American College
which will be sponsored jointly by the
U.W.C. American and Canadian Com¬
mittees. This college will probably
be in British Columbia and will look
toward Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Australia for Its non-national students
in the same way as the College of the
Atlantic in Wales looks toward Europe.
It Is hoped to enter the first students
in September 1972.
Considerable Interest has also been
shown in Italy and Scandinavia in
founding United World Colleges while
in France a survey has just been
completed on the practicability of a
United World College within the
French educational system. A college
for South East Asia in Singapore is
also being considered.
When several such colleges have
been established throughout the world
the venture will be of major importance
In developing International education.
And as for the first students, they
say "We'll never be the same again.
These two years will be with us for
the rest of our lives." I am sure they
are right.

### 56946: Museums for moderns
MUSEUMS FOR MODERNS (Continued from page 26)
growth of these museums since the
late 1940s has been so great as to
demand our attention.
In effect, museum educators re¬
cognized the inadequacies of the
traditional museum as an experiential,
or "discovery learning", environment
for children. They saw the child's
frustration when confronted with the
static, untouchable display of objects
which by their nature demanded to be
touched, fondled, explored, discovered.
They understood the child's need to
work with the materials in an intimate
relationship, to manipulate the exhibits
and to create new structures. Those
who have worked with children in
museums where these things are
possible know the intensity and depth
of the child's adventure.
I
32
I T Is curious, of course, that
the inadequacies of the traditional mu¬
seum were seen as relative only to the
child's museum experience. I suspect
that was so because the adult
audience was thought of as only those
who frequented the museum rather
than the much larger audience which
did not. The adult museum users
most likely to have contact with
staff might also tend to be members
of the educated middle-class minority
which, I suggested earlier, supported
the traditional museum while valuing
the class limitations of Its form.
There is some evidence that the
adult was excluded in error when the
children's museum was created. Adults
want to visit children's museums and
in some instances special regulation
of visiting hours has been necessary
to keep the children's exhibits clear
for children. Experience with chil¬
dren's exhibits planned for world
expositions includes cases where
adults were of necessity barred from
admission.
The children's museum, wherein the
child Is turned loose to work with the
museum materials to the greatest
possible degree, is one of the clues
to the future.
The museums created for the cultur¬
ally deprived minorities and the handi¬
capped are also of great importance.
To create a museum for the blind
where understanding can be achieved
through tactile exploration of materials
is not only to recognize that the blind
cannot see but also to recognize the
validity of the tactile learning expe¬
rience.
The experimental Inner-city or
ghetto museum where the content ¡s a
product of the users' desires to create
what I call models of reality is another
development of note. From a middle-
class observer's viewpoint these
models may be meaningless, childlike,
crude or vulgar. But the permissive
environments of the best of these
experimental museums do not permit
the Imposition of bourgeois values.
The patronizing programmes of
"culture for the masses" have nothing
to do with these museums. What is
permitted Is the programming of Infi¬
nitely variable models of reality by
the museum users. What may appear
there as fantasy Is seldom irrelevant.
The codes employed in the model may
be private but private to the audience
or users, who are also the exhibitors.
These museums recognize their
potential relevance to day-to-day life.
They do not strive to make their
audience visually literate in the sense
that they will learn to verbalize about
artists and schools and the influence
of someone on someone else like the
well-rehearsed visitors at art gallery
openings. Rather, they strive to make
the users see their own world in the
context of the total human environ¬
ment, with all its beauty and its horror,
perhaps for the first time.
The new museums designed for
minorities differ most in that the
audience becomes the exhibitor. The
curator and the interpreter assume
rôles which are not new but are
modified. The curator now is cast
only in his most essential rôle as
scholar, developing the resources with
which the visitor must create. The
educators, designers and others whom
I have grouped together as "inter¬
preters", now have a rôle which that
title best Implies. They Interpret the
encoded resources of the museum to
the user so that he can work creativ¬
ely with them. In order to do this the
interpreter must be bilingual In the
sense that he must share common
languages with both the curators and
the visitors whom I prefer to call users.
But here we are discussing what I
propose as ¡deals for tomorrow which
can be observed today in but a. few
isolated experimental situations.
The creative museum, fulfilling the
Inherent social function described
earlier, requires organization and
administration different from that of
the traditional museum because the
balance of power has shifted and the
goals are achieved through the active,
creative participation of the user
rather than through the indoctrination
of the passive visitor.
Since the museum must be a
responsive resource, sensitive to the
changing needs of the users, it is, in
effect, programmed by the users.
Thus, if there is a dominant power in
the organization of such a public
museum It Is the public itself. The
curatorial staff continues to fulfil all
of the scholarly functions as before,
but now shares with the interpreters
equal status in the internal hierarchy.
Further, the flow of influence In
decision making no longer moves from
curator to interpreter, to produce a
product to be placed before a passive
audience. Now, the Influence of the
public, as manifested in its needs,
anxieties or simply desires, is trans¬
mitted to the curator through the inter¬
preter. This influences the develop¬
ment of the museum resources for
which the curator is responsible.
The curator in return responds to
his public by making available collec¬
tions supported by such thorough
research and documentation that he
can encode in it what his scholarship
dictates to be the most objective ans¬
wers to the questions implicit In the
public's concern. He also presents
the questions which the collection
poses but which his scholarship
cannot answer.
T
	 HIS is the way in which the
dialogue between curator and user is
effected through the medium of the
collection, with the interpreter decod¬
ing and re-encoding as required In
his intermediary rôle.
This dialogue must be active to be
effective. There is no place here for
the permanent, static exhibit which
purports to be a definitive statement.
The organization of the museum must
keep communication channels open so
that there can be a prompt feedback
of responses between curator and
user.
In considering this proposal It is
important to see that the museum's
traditional responsibility to collect and
preserve that which is most excellent,
or unique or which is an expression
of man's highest achievements Is
neither discarded nor pushed aside.
That responsibility has not been
discussed since It is assumed and not
considered endangered by that which
is proposed. Further, excellence can
only be fully appreciated when the
criteria are both understood and
accepted. This the creative museum
enables rather than Inhibits.
Finally, as must be apparent, this
proposal depends for its realization
upon the application of the methods
and insights of the social sciences.
The sociology and social psychology
of museums is admittedly a subject
which only recently has been consider¬
ed for research. If, however, we are
concerned with exploring the rôle of
the museum in contemporary society, is
it not to the social scientist to whom
we must turn first for guidance?

Letters to the Editor
TOBACCO AND ADVERTISING
Sir,
Congratulations on the articles deal¬
ing with tobacco and cancer (May
1970) and the letter on this subject
from Jean Chaumier (July 1970). This
reader doubted whether France had any
laws governing the advertising of ciga¬
rettes. Tobacco advertising is, in fact,
banned on French television under
regulations which also forbid the publi¬
cizing of alcoholic drinks. Consumer
associations such as ours brought
pressure to bear for this measure to
be adopted and applied.

PERENNIAL PROBLEM
Sir,
Since the "Unesco Courier" deals
with the great problems of our time
from an objective and non-sectarian
viewpoint, why not examine in a future
issue a social problem that is particu¬
larly acute and widespread In capitalist
countries prostitution.
Yves Auriol
Savigny-sur-Orge, France
CRUCIAL CHOICE
Sir,
I am accepting your invitation to
young people to write to you on the
problems of youth. I am an 18-year-
old English university student, and I
do not think that the problems of youth
are so very different from any other
group in society. However, there is
one aspect of youth which is often
sneered at their idealism. One of the
greatest difficulties is to reconcile what
has been called "the social conscience"
with a political Impotence. The youth
of my country have complete freedom
of speech and are no doubt grateful
for the social advances made here in
the past few years; many, like myself,
will feel great satisfaction as they read
of the excellent work carried out by
Unesco and hope that they too will be
able to help in this work in the near
future.
Yet still there are nagging doubts.
Few would disagree with the virtue of
providing education for all the peoples
of the world; but are we forced to make
the choice for primary reading matter
between the "Thoughts of Chairman
Mao" or the American Constitution
rather than "All Men Are Brothers"?
Are we forced to say that the latter
no longer has any relevance to the
Indo-Chinese Peninsular?
How do we prove our worth to be
educators as civilized nations when in
1968 the world military expenditure was
$159,000 million ("SIPRI Yearbook"
figure)? Surely there is some anomaly
in the situation where the May Issue
of the "Courier" deals with curing
cancer, and institutions such as the
microbiological establishment at Por¬
ton, England, carry out government
financed research for defence purposes?
It is one thing to call off the South
African cricket tour of Britain but
another to Improve the situation in
South Africa itself. The list is inter¬
minable.
Yet if these doubts are to be allayed
some solution has to be found to the
problem of using the idealism of youth
and others to create the Third World
through the work of Unesco while still
preserving a political detachment; but If
any government provides resources it
is surely going to want a say in how
those resources should be used. Thus
youth often seems to be faced with a
choice: either you can remain an Im¬
potent idealist or you can carry out
the measures which we desire.

WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS...
Sir,
Your issue of February 1969 carried
two letters of special Interest. Marlene
Hung Fok King, of Mauritius, suggests
that the "Unesco Courier" should report
on the world's various religions. Our
cultures stem from our religious herita¬
ges. All revealed religions have had a
tremendous impact on the people to
whom they were revealed. Consider
what happened to the tribes of the
Arabian desert after Mohammed. The
effect has always been to raise man
to a higher plane of existence and
awareness. Divine direction has not
been withheld from mankind, but man¬
kind has found it difficult not to with¬
hold itself from it. There is a sign
on the wall of the laundromat where 1
wash my clothes; it reads "When all
else fails, read the instructions." I am
inclined to believe that man will soon
be ready to return to Divine instruc¬
tions. I agree with Marlene that
features on the true essences of the re-
ligons of the world In the "Unesco
Courier" would be of great value.
The second letter was from Dr. H.
Bongers, of the Netherlands. He dis¬
cusses exactly the kind of thing I be¬
lieve in the cosmic or eternal truths
that run through all religions, and he
quotes from various religions, includ¬
ing Christianity, to convey his meaning.
Why not have Dr. Bongers do the
religious articles?

CRUMBS FROM
SPACE RESEARCH
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" as a general
rule pleads the cause of the develop¬
ing countries and, bearing in mind their
poverty and needs, I was most
disappointed to see the publicity given
to NASA (U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration) in your issue
on the fruits of space research (March
1970).
The laws of gravity which made it
possible to calculate space flights have
been known for 250 years ; Jules Verne
described a moon flight 100 years ago.
The astronauts can teach us little about
the moon that we did not know at the
beginning of the century. Furthermore,
a moon shot would have been unthink¬
able without the discoveries in elec¬
tronics, cybernetics, etc., during the
past 50 years.
It would be wrong to give the credit
to NASA which has merely been the
beneficiary. It Is not science that bene¬
fits from the astronauts' achievements,
but the other way round.
No one could deny that of the
thousands of millions of dollars spent
on space programmes a few . crumbs
have fallen which have benefited
science. But how far have these meagre
yet costly results met the needs of,
scientific research.
Even more disturbing than the space
programme itself Is the formidable
power of electronics which seems to
have modern man at Its mercy.

OF MANKIND' ADDRESS
Sir.
I fully endorse K. Joan Wright's pro¬
posal (Letters, October 1969) for an
annual "State of Mankind" address by
the Secretary-General of the United
Nations. 1 agree that it could be given
on United Nations Day, October 24,
and that radio and TV programmes on
that day could feature films and docu¬
mentaries on the work of the various
U.N. agencies. I should like to hear
the views of other readers. I suggest
that all those interested In the idea
should if possible contact the various
youth movements who in turn could
solicit support from their respective
governments. Unesco should propose
the Idea to its member states and ask
for their moral and financial support.

HANDY SEWERS FOR INDUSTRY
Sir,
The article on man's quest for water
by Raymond L Nace (June 1970) was
most informative and I was glad to see
him mention the vast problem of ocea¬
nic, atmospheric and riverine pollution.
In nations where the Industries are
privately owned it Is easy to under¬
stand the why of pollution. Take, for
example, the company that is planning
to build a steel mill. Water is used
in the manufacture of steel. Money
will be saved and profits Increased if
the company can use the river for a
free sewer instead of also having to
build a water repurification plant.
But how about the new steel mill in
the country where the industries are
owned by the government and there
isn't the private profit motive? If the
government has to allocate resources
to water purifying plants, that will mean
industrialization as typified by the
construction of steel mills will be slow¬
ed down. In some nations, speed of
industrialization has been an overriding
consideration.

Violence and the mass media
Television, radio and newspapers cannot
be made the scapegoats for violence In
modern society, but they have a responsi¬
bility not to add to it, declared specialists
from the mass media, sociologists, psycho¬
logists and child welfare experts at a
symposium on "The Impact of Violence In
the Mass Media" held recently at Unesco's
Paris headquarters. The symposium warn¬
ed that the mass media could contribute
to violent behaviour by exaggerating prob¬
lems and over-simplifying alternatives,
suggesting that violence was the solution
to some questions and by Identifying
certain groups with violence, so that these
people felt they had to live up to the
¡mage which the media presented.
The Tower Of Babel
"The Tower of Babel", an article by
Friedrich Ragette which we published in
our August-September 1970 number, origi¬
nally appeared in "Aramco World". By an
oversight, "The Unesco Courier" failed to
credit "Aramco World" as the source of
the article.
U.N. volunteer corps
for development
A proposal to establish an International
corps of volunteers to aid development is
to be considered by the U.N. General
Assembly. The project is based on a
suggestion made by the Shah of Iran in
1968. A U.N. study published last April
recommended the creation of a "United
Nations Group of Volunteers", and was
supported recently by a U.N. Economic and
Social Council resolution proposing that
the volunteer body should be administered
by the U.N. Development Programme.
International conference
of Tamil studies
The International Conference of Tamil
Studies met in Paris, recently for the first
time outside Asia. The Tamil language,
its relation to Sanskrit, classical and
contemporary Tamil literature and Tamil
culture In the fine arts were among
the themes discussed by 200 specialists.
Unesco's Deputy Director-General, Dr. Mal¬
colm S. Adiseshiah, an Indian of Tamil
mother tongue, spoke at the inaugural
session of the current world interest in
Tamil culture. A recital of Tamil dances
was given at Unesco headquarters during
the conference by two noted artists, Anan-
davalli and Padma Subrahmanyam.
Mini 'U.N.' at scout camp
A miniature "United Nations General
Assembly" and other U.N. bodies were set
up by 1,400 young people attending a
recent International scout camp at Rans-
berg, Sweden, organized by the N.T.O.
Scout Association of Sweden. A scout
"Security Council" directed camp order
and operations, "Unesco" organized camp
programmes and discussions on pollution
problems, and "UNICEF" studied how the
scouts could help the world's needy
children.

India's book industry
Publishing in some twenty languages,
from Assamese to Urdu and including
English, India ranks as the world's fifth
largest book-producer, although it is han¬
dicapped by shortage of raw materials,
lack of type foundries and an inadequate
distribution system. To help the industry,
the Indian government has set up a Natio¬
nal Book Development Council and a Book
Information Centre and granted tax rebates
to publishers. It is also negotiating with
Unesco and the British Book Development
Council for aid in setting up a publishing
and bookselling training institute.
Mexico's school in the park
Chapultepec Park in Mexico City is the
setting for a unique experiment giving edu¬
cational opportunities to thousands of
people. Each Sunday the park becomes
a kind of open-air school offering a wide
range of courses from basic reading and
writing to higher mathematics. Many cour¬
ses stress practical skills cooking, tailoring,
hairdressing while others cover the arts,
including musical theory. Begun by a
husband and wife teaching team, Mr. and
Mrs Abad Gomez, the centre has 120 volun¬
teer teachers and more than 5,000 students.
Flashes...
India is to launch a University of the
Air, using radio broadcasts and correspon¬
dence courses to reach students throughout
the country.
Young people from 32 countries recently
took part in Belgrade in a U.N. seminar on
youth and human rights the first world
meeting on this question to be organized
for youth.
Sweden is to raise grants for part-time
education by over 50 per cent under its
new plans to expand adult education.
Water flouridation programmes as a
preventative measure against tooth decay

SCYTHIAN ¡
SPLENDOUR !
ciences, Kiev
One of the great archaeological surprises of 1969 was the unearthing
by a young Ukrainian archaeologist, Vasili Bidzilya, of a magnificent
Scythian loving-cup in a tomb in the southern Ukraine where it had
lain for nearly 2,400 years. (See story page 18). Above, detail of the cup
(reproduced in full on page 19). The clever contrasting use of silver for
the faces and hands and gold for the garments imbues the figures with
a strangely luminous quality.
