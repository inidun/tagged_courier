rhino
and friends
In prehistoric times the
rhinoceros roamed the
world from East Asia
to North America and
from Siberia to south¬
ern Africa. Today in
India and Indonesia three
species of this huge
animal (named from the
Greek words "rhinos"
for "nose" and "keras"
for "horns") still sur¬
vive as well as the two-
horned species that live
in Africa, the white
or "square lipped" and
the slightly smaller
"black" rhinoceros
which weighs around
two tons. Perched on
the back of the black
rhinoceros shown here
(which incidently was
born without ears) are
some of the birds which
befriend these huge
beasts by eating the
ticks which, creep into
the folds of the dark
grey skin. In the past
century thousands of
rhinos have been hunted
down for the sake of
their horns (sometimes
over 50 inches long)
which were believed by
some peoples to have
certain medicinal pro¬
perties. Today rhino¬
ceros hunting is prohi¬
bited or strictly re¬
stricted in most African
territories. The white
rhinoceros in particular
survives only because of
measures adopted for its
protection. (See p. 15).

One of the great scientific
discoveries of the past
few years has been the
unravelling of the mecha¬
nism of heredity. Scientists
have found that the genes,
which determine the nature
of new organisms as they
are passed from parents
to children, are molecules
of deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA), the fundamental
building blocks of heredity.
These are arranged in special
patterns which scientists
have begun to decode.

SCIENCE
AND THE
COMMON MAN
by Ritchie Calder
I GNORANCE of the law, it is said, is no excuse. In the mid-
twentieth century ignorance of science should be no excuse.
For, while the first of these statements does not assume that everyone
should have a law degree, and the second should not imply that everyone
should be a science graduate, the truth is that science has become the
social dynamic of our times. It dominates international politics. It threatens
our lives and our livelihoods, or, if it is properly applied, it can promise a
fuller and a more meaningful life. Yet a great gulf of language and of ex¬
periences separates the scientist in his specialty from the wider commu¬
nity, and this separation is fraught with danger for our civilization and for
science itself.
Science, which exists to remove mystery and magic, has
created its own mystery and its own magic. People, in igno¬
rance through lack of explanation, regard science with a
kind of superstitious awe and, at the same time, want
science to produce those miraculous gadgets and cures
which a certain type of popular journalism has taught them
to expect and, indeed, to take for granted. In the absence
of a proper understanding of the methods and the processes
of science and of any social integration of scientific know¬
ledge, the apparent haphazardness of discovery encourages
a popular attitude towards science which is mistrustful and
unhealthy. People fear what they do not' understand.
Science, by its emphasis on experimental research, has
forsaken natural philosophy, and in its hurried retreat from
scholasticism is forgetting the scholarliness in which it made
common ground with the humanities. By the same token,
those humanities have lost touch with science. Overspecial-
ization gives the scientists the excuse for saying: "We have
no time for other subjects"; and their colleagues in the
arts, the excuse for saying: "If it takes the scientist so long
and so close a study to learn, how can we be expected to
understand ?"
The fragmentation of science into more and more bran¬
ches, each with its own specially invented jargon, is dividing
the scientists themselves and making it difficult or often
impossible for one scientist to understand another, much
less make himself intelligible to the wider public. In our
schools and universities, by over-early and continuing segre
gation, one section of our citizenry is given too little science
and another section too much.
This is as much a criticism of the humanities as it is of
the science faculties. It is not only a question of reconcil¬
ing, somehow, the"Two Cultures" of which Sir Charles
Snow has spoken; it is a question of how far we can get
to the mass of the community an understanding of the forces
which are determining their very existence. Pierre Auger's
estimate that 90 per cent of all the scientists that have ever
lived are alive today, has become a cliché. The other 10 per
cent have their niches in the Corridor of Time which stret¬
ches back to the time when Thinking Man first mastered fire.
But the word "scientist" is itself a comparatively recent
invention. The word did not exist in English nor, as far as
anyone knows, in any other language until 1841. Before
that the inquirer into natural phenomena was a "man of
science". As late as 1895 the London "Daily News" was
still protesting about "scientists" as "this American innova¬
tion" and to his dying day H.G. Wells insisted that the
proper term was "man of science".
The distinction is important. The "man of science"
belonged with the virtuosi, like Pepys, Wren, Evelyn, Bishop
Ward, Governor Winthrop, William Petty (the father of politi¬
cal economics) as well as with Boyle and Hooke, the men
who founded the Royal Society.
They belonged in the Lunar Society of Birmingham, where
James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, would argue

The Two Cultures'
on speaking terms
music with Herschel, the Astronomer Royal, who had been
a German bandmaster; where Joseph Priestley, the dis¬
coverer of oxygen, would discuss politics as readily as
chemistry and eventually had his house in Birmingham
burned for his pains by the mob; where Erasmus Darwin
speculated about evolution, which his grandson Charles was
eventually to define, and wrote poetry on his way home, by
moonlight, to Lichfield; where William Small could be found
(who, at Williamsburg, had been Thomas Jefferson's Pro¬
fessor of Natural Philosophy and who had taught him the
checks and balances of Newtonian physics which were built
into the American Constitution); where Josiah Wedgwood,
the potter, could learn from Priestley's oxidization, and go
out and find non-ferrous clays for his fine white porcelain.
Such men discussed everything, including science, with
minds unbuttoned like their breeches' bands. A "man of
science" could converse and communicate with any other
educated man (the fact that educated men were a small
élite, in those times, is another matter). There was no
barrier of language. They were the gifted amateurs. Any
educated man could be intelligible to another because the
scientific terms which they used were based on the roots
of Latin or Greek and they meant, descriptively, what they
said.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, men were
becoming "scientists" and the "-ist" meant that they were
ceasing to be amateurs or natural philosophers or "men of
science", on speaking terms with their colleagues in the
humanities; they were for their own specialized purposes
inventing their own language of convenience.
WO hundred years before, in 1640, Jan Come¬
nius, the great Bohemian educationalist, had a
proposal which would have incorporated science in wisdom.
His ideas of education command the respect of pedagogues
today, but there was one aspect of his contribution which
particularly affected science; that was his Pansophicon.
There is no doubt that his idea was inspired by Sir Francis
Bacon's "House of Salomon" in "New Atlantis" but Come¬
nius spelt it out. His idea was to create a college at which
the wise men of the world would foregather, for a year at a
time, and bring with them, and assess and explore, all the
natural knowledge, collected from all over the world, and
propound it and make it widely known for the adoption by
men for their benefit.
It was an idea which appealed to responsive minds in
Britain, and he was invited to London. His enterprise was
so well received that the Seminary of St. James's, Chelsea,
was actually earmarked for the college. The ways and
means of setting this up were to be discussed in Parliament
in the fateful session in which the Civil War broke out.
Charles I lost his head; Comenius lost his college, and the
building which had been assigned to the project was given
by Charles II, at the instigation of Nell Gwynn, to house the
veterans of wars. Today the Royal Chelsea Hospital for
Pensioners is where the Pansophicon might have been.
The idea did not become entirely lost; it influenced the vir¬
tuosi, who met as the "Invisible College", first in London
and then at Oxford, and who conceived the Royal Society
of London, the prototype of all National Academies.
In its way the Lunar Society of Birmingham was also an
offspring of the Pansophicon, and today the Princeton
Institute of Advanced Studies reflects Comenius's intention.
But it is not only on the high, intellectual level of synthesis
and assimilation, as at Princeton, that Comenius needs his

present-day expression. We need a heart-pump to spread
the corpuscles of science through the body-politic. We
have to restore something of the inquiring spirit and common
understanding.
When, in Britain, the Royal Society was itself becoming too
remote as a learned society at the end of the eighteenth
century, the Royal Institution was founded by Count Rum-
ford. He was an American who had been employed by the
King of Bavaria who had made him a Count of the Holy
Roman Empire, and he came to London with the idea of
setting up, by private subscription, "an establishment for
feeding the poor and giving them useful employment...
connected with an institution for bringing forward into gene¬
ral use new inventions, and improvements, particularly such
as relate to the management of heat and the saving of fuel
and to various other mechanical contrivances, by which
domestic comfort and economy can be promoted".
Although this institution was indeed to provide the labor¬
atories for Sir Humphrey Davy, and for Faraday, by 1831

discovered that there

it had become more especially a meeting place of the
intelligentsia and less committed to the people. This led to
the establishment of the British Association for the Ad¬
vancement of Science. The new association was founded at
York in 1831 and one of its objects was to remove the
obstacles which stood in the way of the advancement of
science, with the clear recognition that one of these
obstacles was public ignorance. To that end men of science
were invited into the provinces for the annual meetings,
which still continue, so that the "man in the moon" could
come down to the "man in the street".
When, after the middle of the nineteenth century, science
became more and more specialized the British Association
tried to correct this trend. In the 1860s it started lectures to
the "operative classes", and Tyndall, T. H. Huxley, Lubbock,
Preece, Ayrton, Bramwell, Ball and other great figures of
the times carried the facts of science into the countryside.
There was a great hunger for understanding among the
people, who were practically illiterate. In South Wales the
miners organized excursion trains from the mining valleys
to hear Sylvanus Thompson talk in Cardiff on electricity,
and in Bradford a crowd of 3,500 millworkers listened to
him with rapt attention for an hour and three-quarters.
Ray Lankester, Richard Gregory and H. G. Wells picked
up the torch at the beginning of the twentieth century.
Weils, a B. Sc. in biology, could seize on an abstruse paper
by Soddy (1911) and understand enough about the transmu¬
tation of atoms and the possible release of energy to predict
to the exact year, 1932 the first artificial radio-activity.
Scientists, however, were becoming still more specialized.
In 1900, the Royal Society of London abdicated its claims
to be a National Academy and sponsored the British Aca¬
demy, to which it referred problems of philosophy, psycho¬
logy, social science, literature and so on, while it itself
became the learned society of experimental science. "Natu- 7
ral philosophy" survived in the titles of Scottish university
chairs, whose professors were physicists. "Physics", which
had been a term derived from Aristotle's treatises on

SCIENCE AND MAN (Cont'd)
Cryptic language and private jargons
"natural things", had (except in the Physical Society of
Edinburgh, which still belongs to biologists) been expro¬
priated and restricted to "the science treating of the pro¬
perties of energy and matter (excluding biology and
chemistry)".
In place of the free-ranging discussions with benign wine
and gentle candlelight at the Lunar Society, we have narrow¬
er and narrower briefings in the fluorescent glare of seminar
and colloquia where, in their private jargon, the scientists dis¬
cuss last week's meson, the latest amino-acid synthesis, or a
hair on the whisker of a banana-fly. Learned societies,
themselves "splinter" groups of natural philosophy, have
sub-groups within groups and sub-sections within sections.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the ordinary person
thinks of science as a kind of vault to which only a graduate
scientist knows the combination, and within it a series of
safes labelled "Physics," "Chemistry," "Biology," "Geo¬
logy," "Astronomy," etc. And each of these has its special
combination lock. And inside these safes there are lockers
vast numbers of lockers marked "Nuclear physics,"
"Crystallography," "Solid state," "Colloid Chemistry," "Or¬
ganic," "Inorganic," "Cytology," "Genetics," "Biophysics,"
"Biochemistry," and so on ad infinitum.
I T is questionable whether anyone, or any body,
has ever made a complete list of all the so-
called branches of science. What makes it worse, of
course, is that each invents its own private language. It
would not be so bad if they would admit that it is their lan¬
guage of convenience, a shorthand, with grammalogues
peculiar to the inventor and to the small esoteric group
around him, but so many scientists assume that their code-
language is common language and that somehow people
are ignorant or stupid if they do not understand. Much
even of the normal language of science has been corrupted
away from meaning by usage.
It would be an excellent education and discipline for all
scientists if they were to take their latest monograph,
eschew all scientific terminology and use, instead, de¬
scriptive phrases not for the edification of the public (or
even to oblige science writers like myself) but for their
personal, private illumination. It is hard but true to say
that a scientist who cannot explain what he is doing does
not in fact know what he is doing. Every great scientist
has been able to make himself comprehensible even
Einstein triedl It is the lesser scientists without the full
confidence of their subject who make themselves defen¬
sively unintelligible. Language, therefore, is one of the
worst features of this fragmentation of science; in fact, it
is not too much to say it is one of the causes of it.
"The trouble about science and scientific explanation
is that it tends to be incomprehensible to anyone except
the expert," wrote Professor Hyman Levy in the "Literary
Guide," June 1955. "Scientists in transforming social life
have enormously inflated the language. The influence of
the Norman invasion on the English language was pro¬
found; yet how far-reaching the influence of modern science
has hardly been assessed. Listen to a group of chemists
or biologists or mathematicians talking among themselves
and you will realize that most Englishmen today no longer
know their mother tongue. Even a foreigner may under¬
stand more of what is said." (Perhaps one should inter¬
polate "If the foreigner is a chemist, a biologist or a mathe¬
matician, of a particular school of chemistry, biology, or
mathematics.")
Dealing with the "language" of mathematical symbols,
Professor Hyman Levy asks: "You say you want an expla¬
nation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. What kind of
explanation? In terms of words of the Anglo-Saxon period
and therefore with very nearly the concepts prevalent at
that time? In terms of the language of the seventeenth cen¬
tury and therefore with concepts prevalent about the time
of Newton? In terms of the language of, say, 1900? In
modern technical terms? In modern mathematical symbo¬
lism? All these would represent attempts at explanation
but how successful could they possibly be?"
Or, this writer might add, in terms of the language
of a London bar where, over a glass of beer and bread
and cheese, Professor Levy himself once gave me a
"translation" of Einstein, which made me sound very con¬
vincing that night on the BBC. I admit it was rather like
getting a Cree Indian to define atomic energy which I
once did. I found government geologists teaching Red
Indian trappers in the Canadian North to look for uranium
ore, and I wondered what it all meant to the Cree In¬
dians. I asked the chief of the Crees, what, in his language,
was atomic energy. He replied: "Eskotik-otchit kaochi-
pyik," which means "Lightning which comes out of rock."
This question of terminology is propably the most impor¬
tant consideration in the discussion of the communication
of science to the wider public. "A nod," it is said, "is a
good as a wink to a blind horse." And there is a good
deal of nodding and winking by scientists in their dealings
with ordinary people who are blind to science, or blinded
by science.
As Professor Levy pointed out, scientists, regardless of
their native tongue, can generally understand each other.
They have enough common ground in terms of their special
subjects. This is rather like the craftsmen in the Middle
Ages, who moved about Europe, without knowing one an¬
other's language, but with the signs and symbols of their
specialities. Their craft really were "mysteries" and the
mechanical "rites" under the secrecy of a brotherhood were
conveyed from generation to generation and from master
to apprentice.
Sometimes, one feels, the modern cryptic languages of
the scientists specialities have been conceived, as we once
invented operational code-names during the war, not to
explain, but to deceive. Nor does it help when scientists
in one discipline borrow the terminology of another. Like
the word "plasma," for instance. The physiologists first
used it about 1845 to describe the colourless liquid part
of blood, lymph, milk, or muscle. A hundred years ago,
the biologists embodied it in the word "protoplasm," the
living matters of cells. The classicists should, at that time,
have taken exception because, from its Greeks origins, the
world should have meant "mould" or "matrix." By their
default, however, the biologists acquired it by right of usage
and ultimately by the popular sanction of blood donors.
WE now have a new science of plasmaphysics,
which means the physics of electrified gases.
The term had been used by the fluorescence engineers to
mean the flux of positive and negative ions in tube lamps,
before it was given a new importance by researches on the
harnessing of thermonuclear energy the putting of the
H-bomb into dungarees for civil purposes.
Why "plasma?" In physics, it is certainly not a "matrix,"
nor is it the biologists' "fluid." If there is any analogy,
it is between the ions and the blood corpuscles the
opposite of the physiological usage. At a meeting in the
United States, which included physicists and biologists, the
physicists talked possessively about plasma until a bio¬
logist at the back of the room said plaintively: "Mr. Chair¬
man, can we please have our word back?" "No, you can¬
not," said the chairman, "the nuclear physicists have so
much money they have bought it."
Such borrowing of words causes confusion and is often
completely misleading. Sometimes, one suspects, they are
condescensions an example of talking down to less

WHY do men make mistakes?" asks Walter
Lippmann, the U.S. writer and political analyst,
and answers, "Because an important part of human
behaviour is reaction to the pictures in their heads. Human
behaviour takes place in relation to a pseudo-environment
a representation, which is not quite the same for any two
individuals. What they suppose to be not what is the
reality of things. This man-made, this cultural environment
which has its being in the minds of men, is interposed
between man as a biological organism and external reality."
The problem is one of bringing "pictures in the mind"
and "external reality" into truer alignment. The best way
though certainly not an infallible one is through first-hand
experiences, followed by audio-visual representations, and
lastly by words. It is through words, however, that most of
our "education" takes place and much is inevitably lost in
the telling as word descriptions are substituted for their Q
real-life counterparts. «*
Consider words such as poverty, underdeveloped, hot,
cold, democratic, progressive, backward, and the like.

WORDS UNDER A MASK (Cont'd)
A mental etc../ that leaves the door open
10
Dictionaries carry definitions but people carry connotations
and it Is connotations which influence thinking and rule
behaviour. Moreover, connotations are not only personal,
they are also heavily cultural. A Frenchman, a Cambodian
and a Tunisian or an Englishman, an Indian and an American
may "understand" the words which each is using when
speaking French or English, but whether they will ever
"understand" the nuances the shades of delicate
differences in meaning is quite another matter.
Throughout history many writers In many cultures have
called attention to the fact that words misinform as well as
inform, but it was not until 1897 that a Frenchman, Michel
Breal, gave it the name "sémantique", or the science of
meaning. More recently, in the 1920's in the United States,
a movement called General Semantics, often referred to
as G. S., was pioneered by Alfred Korzybski and subs¬
equently popularized by researchers and writers, including
Stuart Chase, Wendell Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, and Irving
Lee.
From these and other writers on the subject, we have
drawn a number of examples to illustrate the contribution
General Semantics can make to the study of other peoples
and ways of living different from our own. We do not claim
that greater attention to these and other General Semantics
assumptions and techniques will in itself eliminate all prob¬
lems of "meaning", but it should be incontestable that
descriptions of "things out there" can and must be conveyed
more precisely and with more accurate interpretation.
The nature of the world is one of dynamic flow "a mad
dance of electrons" in which no two things are identical,
no one thing remains the same and, as Heraclitus expressed
it over two thousand years ago, "one cannot step in the
same river twice".
The nature of man is that unlike other living things
he can "receive gifts from the dead" through the use
of his man-made language, but his internal experiences
are literally "unspeakable". Abstractions take place when
he tries to substitute words for reality.
HE nature of languages is like that of a map;
it is useful to the extent that- it describes the
territory accurately. Maps and territories are not the same,
however, nor are words and reality interchangeable, though
it is by no means uncommon for some people to react to
words as they would to a slap in the face. And, of course,
advertizers have long known that certain names appear to
have the magical effect of seemingly impregnating them¬
selves into a product. Who among us has not purchased
an item recently because the name rather than the sub¬
stance often untried appealed to our stream of conno¬
tations?
For example, South American (A) is not South American
(B) is not South American (C) is not South American (D),
etc. In other words, South American (teacher in Lima)
is not South American (rural area worker in Brazil), etc.
Although by convention we refer to the 150 million people
who live in an area called South America as "South
Americans", the truth is that no two "South Americans"
are identical including, of course, those who live in the
same country or even in the same household. Considered
in the same way, each of the estimated seventy-seven
thousand million people who have inhabited the earth
has been unique.
Statements which purport to talk about "a people"
as if they were one entity must obviously be qualified.
Questions such as "What do Africans think about Euro¬
peans?" are clearly unanswerable. Answerable questions
those which have some likelihood of being verified
are less dramatic and perhaps less satisfying, but that
is the nature of the problem. It is only by taking liberties
with language that we appear to be better informed than the
data permit. Similarly, it may readily be seen that terms
such as "Asian", "Moslem", "Oriental", and the like conceal
differences as well as reveal group affinities. (1).
Japan (1840) is not Japan (1945) is not Japan (1965) is
not Japan (1980), etc. Change is inevitable, though the rate
varies. One who forgets this is certain to be shocked when
confronted with the discrepancy between what he thinks (or
remembers) is true and what is so.
The same may be used to connote different "realities",
while similar events or experiences are sometimes called
by different names.
OR example, when someone says that it is hot,
the word "hot" is more likely to represent the
speaker's state of mind than it is to describe the current
temperature reading. "Cold wave" could mean anything
from 20 to 30 degrees below zero (F) in Alaska to 40 de¬
grees above zero in New Delhi where, incidentally, a conti¬
nuous string of days in the 90's in May would scarcely
qualify as a "heat wave".
Very often, the addition by the speaker of the words
"to me" and the addition by the listener of the words "to
you" help to identify so-called statements of fact as really
statements of opinion. Words whose meanings have become
meaningless from being used to carry too heavy and too
diversified loads of information should be set apart by
enclosing them with quotation marks to alert the reader.
Korzybski used to wiggle two fingers of each hand when
speaking to achieve the same effect.
Consider this plea from ancient China, entitled, "On the
Standard of Beauty":
"If a man sleeps in a damp place, he gets lumbago and
may die. But what about an eel? And living up a tree is
frightening and tiring to the nerves. But what about mon¬
keys? What habitat can be said to be absolutely right? Then
men eat flesh, deer eat grass, centipedes enjoy small
worms, owls and crows delight in mice. Whose is the
right taste, absolutely? Monkeys mate with apes, bucks
with does, eels consort with fishes, while men admire
great beauties such as Mao Chiang and Li Chi. Yet at
the sight of these women the fish plunged deep into the
water, birds flew from them aloft, and deer sped away.
Who shall say what is the right standard of beauty? In
my opinion, the doctrines of benevolence and righteousness
and the paths of right and wrong are inextricably confused.
How could I discriminate among them?" (2).
No matter how complete a listing or how comprehensive
an explanation, the possibility always remains open that
something more might be said about the matter under con¬
sideration. All descriptions are "open-ended" with the last
word unsaid. Completeness may be a goal, but like in¬
finity it eludes mortal grasp. Thus for example, an exami¬
nation of any culture or any country might include ref¬
erence to its history, its development, its achievements
and so on, but these would always be incomplete. No
matter how extensive the treatise, a mental "etc." should
be added to the last punctuation point. The practical
effect of this orientation is to leave the door open, albeit
a crack, for additional information which may be forth¬
coming.
This list of "devices" for applying General Semantics
can be extended almost indefinitely. Here are a few more
cautions to consider:
Let us try to use descriptive terms rather than those
expressing approval or disapproval. For example, the

Calculated
distortion
Images of grotesque beings? Visions of the supernatural? No, those
illustrations are simply examples of anamorphosis. This is the name
given to a distorted projection or drawing of anything which when
viewed only from a single point appears regular and properly proportioned.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, anamorphoses obtained through
the use of geometric calculations fascinated artists, painters, engravers
and architects and led to much optical research. Great artists like Dürer,
Leonardo da Vinci and Holbein executed drawings and paintings of
this kind. Above, a portrait of the Emperor Charles V (1500-1558) by
an unknown artist. To restore the emperor's feature to their correct
proportions the portrait should be viewed at eye level and from left
to right. Below, a child's head drawn by Leonardo da Vinci. It appears
normal only when viewed at eye level and from a single point diagonally
from right to left and from the bottom to the top. Left, "Perspective
Hunters" by Abraham Bosse (1648), an engraving representing three
researchers engrossed in their studies of imaginary squares on the floor.
In the 18th and 19th centuries anamorphosis no longer interested the
theorists; it became a popular curiosity and optical divertissement-

words "clean" and "unclean" are relative. The comment
that cow dung is used for fuel in many Afro-Asian villages
often provokes reactions of disgust from many urban
dwellers the world (1965) over. It may be instructive on
this point to quote from an American, writing about his
experience on the Great Plains of his country in 1879 when
buffalo and cow dung (he calls them "chips") were
commonly used for fuel:
"It was comical to see how gingerly our wives handled
these chips at first. They commenced by picking them
up between two sticks, or with a poker. Soon they used
a rag, and then a corner of their apron. Finally, growing
hardened, a washing after handling them was sufficient.
And now? Now it is out of the bread, into the chips and
back again and not even a dust of the hands."
Let us try to use phrases which indicate certain condi¬
tions which should be considered with a statement. For
example, awareness may be increased by using such
phrases as "in our culture", "from our point of view,"
"at that time," and the like.
12
ISCALCULATIONS often arise through the mis¬
taken notion that other cultures prize the same
values as one's own. Here, for example, is what Aldous
Huxley wrote following his first trip around the world in
1927:
"So the journey is over and I am back again where I
started, richer by much experience and poorer by many
exploded convictions, many perished certainties. For
convictions and certainties are too often the concomitants
of ignorance. Of knowledge and experience the fruit is
generally doubt. It is doubt that grows profounder as
knowledge more deeply burrows into the underlying mys¬
tery, that spreads in exact proportion as experience is
widened and the perceptions of the experiencing individual
are refined. . .
"...I set out on my travels knowing, or thinking that I
knew, how men should live, how be governed, how educated,
what they should believe. I knew which was the best
form of social organization and to what end societies had
been created. I had my views on every activity of life.
Now, on my return, I find myself without any of these
pleasing certainties. . .
"...The better you understand the significance of any
question, the more difficult it becomes to answer it. Those
who like to feel that they are always right and who attach
a high importance to their own opinions should stay at
home. When one is travelling, convictions are mislaid
as easily as spectacles, but unlike spectacles, they are
not easily replaced." (1).
Let us try to move in the direction of substituting more
precise words for vague ones. For example, it is often
said that "heavy rains" fall on India during the monsoon
season. The statement would carry more meaning if it
were pointed out, for example, that Allahabad, a city in
the Ganges Valley, and New York City both receive on
the average 40 inches of rain annually with the significant
difference that New York City gets from two to four
inches monthly whereas Allahabad is hit by some 37 inches
from June to October.
Let us become more alert to the ways in which
cultural conditioning shapes our value judgments. An
exercise in seeing one's own culture as it might be seen
by a stranger is a useful start. Consider, for example,
the following excerpt from an article called, "Body Ritual
Among the Nacirema":
"The focal point of the shrine is a box or chest which is
built into the wall. In this chest are kept the many charms
and magical potions without which no native believes he
could live. . .
"...The charm is not disposed of after it has served
its purpose, but is placed in the charm-box of the house¬
hold shrine. As these magical materials are specific for
certain ills, and the real or imagined maladies of the people
are many, the charm-box is usually full to overflowing.
The magical packets are so numerous that people forget
what their purposes were and fear to use them again.
"While the natives are very vague on this point, we can
only assume that the idea in retaining all the old magical
materials is that their presence in the charm-box, before
which the body rituals are conducted, will in some way
protect the worshipper." (2).
Here under discussion has been the medicine cabinet
in American (Nacirema spelled backward), or almost any
other western culture!

### 32062: World population to double by end of century

WORLD POPULATION TO DOUBLE
BY END OF CENTURY
A population "explosion" of unprecedented size is taking
place in vast areas of the world. This extraordinary multi¬
plication of population poses tremendous economic and social
problems, particularly in the developing countries. These
problems will be examined by the World Population Confer¬
ence, a scientific meeting of experts on population, to be
held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in September 1965, under the
auspices of the United Nations and with the co-operation of
Unesco, FAO, WHO and other international organizations.
Below we publish some of the findings of a recent U.N. study
on world population prospects for the next 40 years.
^^»ORLD population, approximately 3,000 million
1960, will rise to the order of 5,300-6,800
million by the year 2000, according to "plausible long
range" projections contained in a United Nations report on
world population prospects. A figure near 6,000 million,
or double the 1960 number, "seems to be the most likely
expectation", according to the study.
The world total by the year 2000 could, however, rise to
a level 2.5 times the 1960 figure to 7,410 million if the
1960 fertility rate were to continue and if mortality were

to go on decreasing~at the rates which prevailed during the
1950's, an assumption, the report states, "not considered
likely to be borne out by future developments."
The study notes that "it is highly probable that events
will occur which will bring about changes in the present
population trends". "Certain tendencies of development
can now be discerned which have fairly definite implications
for the near future, and their possible implications for the
more remote future are also calculable, though with varying
degrees of uncertainly", it states.
The publication, "Provisional Refort on World Population
Prospects, as Assessed in 1963", was prepared by the
Population Branch of the United Nations Department of Eco¬
nomic and Social Affairs and is being circulated among gov¬
ernments, selected demographic institutes and individual
experts for comments and suggestions. On the basis of
comments received, a final report will be prepared for pub¬
lication in the United Nations series of population studies.
In 316 pages of text and tables, the report points out that:
In nearly all developing countries, there remains
considerable scope for rapid decreases in the death
rate, so that the prevailing tendency is one of accele¬
rating population growth;
The population of most developing countries is now
increasing at annual rates ranging from about 1.0 per
cent to 3.5 per cent, whereas the rates of most dev¬
eloped countries are between 0.5 and 1.7 per cent;
The population of Latin America by the end of the
century would be 3.6 times as large as in 1960; Africa
and South-East Asia would each have more than three
times as many inhabitants, East Asia 2.3 times as many;
those of Oceania, North America and the Soviet Union
would nearly double; and Europe's population would
be increased by one-third;

WORLD POPULATION (Cont'd)
Sweden, the country of long life
By the year 2000, the share of world population in
the now less developed areas would rise from 71 per
cent In 1960 to 81 per cent. Very high population den¬
sities would be attained in East Asia and South Asia,
surpassing the density in Europe;
Migration in the future would probably tend to be on
a reduced scale and the relative demographic impor¬
tance of the population movements would be even
slighter;
The developed countries are undergoing a progres¬
sive increase in the proportion of aged persons in the
population, which is resulting in a gradual slowing-
down of population growth.
The report notes that world population growth has "cons¬
picuously accelerated", due to the immediate effects of
mortality decline, and may accelerate further for the same
reason. "It is inevitable, however, that this growth must
eventually slow down", the report says, but "if fertility does
not decline, the prospect of eventual slowing down of the
population growth is removed to a more distant future, and
the eventual size of the population will be still much larger."

Trends in Eight World Areas
A section of the publication deals with future population
projections up to the year 2000 by eight major areas: East
Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Soviet Union, Africa, Northern
America, Latin America and Oceania.
Included in this section is a report on population estimates
for mainland China. The report refers to the "scarcity and
uncertainty of data" and presents population projections
according to variously combined assumptions regarding
trends in mortality and fertility for mainland China. One of
the variants is computed on the assumption of low mortality
and late fertility decline. It gives the following figures on
the population estimate for mainland China:
1960	 648.1 million
1980 916.8 million
2000 1,210.0 million
The adjoining table compares the "medium" find the
"continued recent trends" projections of world population
by regions up to the year 2000 as calculated in the report:
Infant Deaths*
Despite the continuing downward trend in infant mortality
rates throughout much of the world, the range between the
lowest and the highest rates is still enormous. Thus, in
Sweden, the rate is 15.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live-births,
while the. recorded or estimated rates are 180.4 in Haiti,
165 in Turkey and 139.3 in Burma.
Very high infant mortality rates are also found in the
United Arab Republic (133.9 per 1,000 live-births), Indonesia
(125), Chile (116), the Turks and Caicos Islands (107.1) and
Ecuador (104).
At the lower end of the scale, in addition to Sweden, are
the Netherlands (15.8), Iceland (17), Norway (17.7), Finland
(18.0), New Zealand (19.6), Gibraltar (19.6), Australia (20.0),
Denmark (20.1) and Switzerland (21.2).
Expectation of Life*
Female babies born in Sweden now can expect to live
slightly over 75 years. Those born in the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Norway can look forward to almost 75
years of life; those born in France can expect to live
slightly over 74 years; and those born in Denmark, the Uni¬
ted States, Czechoslovakia and New Zealand have an aver¬
age number of years of life (expectation of life) between
73 and 74 years.
In addition, there are 19 other countries where life expec¬
tation for females is as high as 70 years or more, making
a total of 28 countries in which the expectation of life for
females is 70 years or over.
The highest expectancy for males born today is almost
72 years, and this applies to those born in Sweden. Male
babies in the Netherlands and Norway can expect to live
slightly over 71 years.
There are only three additional countries Denmark,
Israel (Jewish population) and Iceland where the longest
expected lifetime for male babies is 70 years or more,
making a total of six, as contrasted to the 28 for females.

frontiers

I;IS it pure chance or a happy omen ? After
centuries during which jealously guarded
frontiers were the most obvious outward sign of "territorial
behaviour" on a national scale and the living symbol of an
absence of understanding between peoples, the last few
years have brought us face to face with a curious phe¬
nomenon. On every continent and even in Europe, where
friction and open discord have been at their bitterest, there
is a growing number of "protected zones" astride the fron¬
tiers of two or even three neighbouring States.
In general, they occur in regions oustanding for their
spectacular scenery, for their "natural monuments" and the
special plants and animals that abound there. These regions
have rapidly become great centres of attraction for tourists
and have now joined the special localities in the world into
which flock young people of every nationality. Within a few
years a place that was once a barrier may, on the contrary,
become a meeting place.

POLAND -SOVIET UNION. By tha
end of the First World War the herds of
wild bison which once roamed the
forests of Europe had been completely
wiped out. All the surviving bison were
in zoos; by 1930 only 40 animals re¬
mained. Since then, thanks to the efforts
of the International Society for the
Protection of Bison, formed on the sug¬
gestion of Poland, the European bison
has not only been saved from complete
extinction, but its numbers have increas¬
ed considerably. From stocks raised in
Polish breeding centres the first new
herd to be allowed to roam freely was
released in 1952 in the great forests
around Bielowecza (photo right) where
Polish and Soviet reserves now meet on
the frontier. Poland has also been export¬
ing bison to enable other European
countries to start breeding new herds.

The protection offered to these and
other mountain animals by the long-
established Spanish Parque Nacional
de Ordesa will be increased if efforts
now being made to establish a French
national park in the Pyrenees are
successful. The combined reserves
would assure the future of the brown
bear and izards on the mountains and
the birds of prey that still nest there.

SANCTUARIES ASTRIDE FRONTIERS (Cont'd)
All that is required is. for parks established by two neigh¬
bouring States across their common frontier to co-ordinate
their programmes' of preservation and planning and also for
traffic controls to be organized at the entrances to protected
zones for everything to change very rapidly. Roads that
were once the preserve of customs officials and frontier
guards become increasingly used by people in civilian
clothes townspeople on holiday. Shelters and youth
hostels gradually replace guard posts and customs houses.
Tourists from both sides of the frontier discover, with sur¬
prise, how alike they are and that they possess a common
heritage. Gradually, the wall becomes a bridge.
Which are today's main "protected zones" astride the
frontier regions of two or three neighbouring States? In
Europe, the oldest and perhaps the most famous is on the
frontier between Poland and Czechoslovakia where the
Tatras National Park adjoins the Czech reserve bearing the
same name. Both parks together form a natural region as
spectacular for the tourists as it is of interest to the
naturalist.
In a wonderful setting of forests and mountains, speci¬
mens of almost all the great carnívora which have dis¬
appeared from the rest of the European continent, the
brown bear, the wolf, lynx and wild cat, are free to live far
from all interference. On mountain ridges, chamois and
royal eagles are to be found today as in the past. Rare
black storks nest regularly in the valleys. A fact of out¬
standing importance is that administrators of the Polish and
Czech parks hold working meetings together at regular
intervals and the numbering of game as well as the arrange¬
ment of tourist itineraries are organized in common.
Almost as interesting a region is to be found on the
Franco-Italian frontier in the western Alps. In 1922 the
former Aosta royal hunt was transformed into the Parco
Nazionale des Gran Paradiso, famous throughout the world
for its herds of ibex and chamois. This park was the only
ibex reserve in the Alps and was the centre from which
this species was reintroduced gradually into Switzerland
and France.
Since 1963, the Pare National Français de la Vanoise has
shared a common frontier with the earlier established Ital¬
ian park. The ibex and chamois can now pass In and out
of these magnificent mountain regions and out of reach of
the rapacious hand of the poacher whose depredations
have, until now, prevented the natural revival of the "Capra
Ibex" in the French Alps.
The Spanish Parque Nacional de Ordesa has been in
existence for a long time. It is situated in one of the wildest
and most picturesque regions of the central Pyrenees.
Those in France concerned with the preservation of wild
life hope that before long a national park in the Pyrenees
will be established on the northern side of the frontier.
This would ensure that the famous Cirque de Gavarnie is
protected from vandalism. If this second reserve can be
established reasonably quickly and if the area of the Parque
de Ordesa can be enlarged even slightly, the future of
the brown bear, of the izard, or wild goat, and of several
predatory creatures in the Pyrenees will be finally assured.
In another setting far from the great chains of mountains
that lend themselves better than anywhere else to the estab¬
lishment of national parks and recreational areas, another
fine example of international co-operation for the protection
of areas of refuge for threatened animals is found in the
protected zones of the forest of Bielowecza on the Soviet
Polish frontier.
This magnificent primeval forest with its fine oaks, lime
and fir trees, all that is left of the European virgin forests,
has always been particularly well looked after by the Polish
preservers of wild life and by naturalists. It was here that
the last herd of European wild bison found refuge and it
was also here that this interesting ungulate was saved from
complete extinction. In 1952 when there was stock of
beasts large enough to maintain the species, the first herd
was freed. They now roam the great forest lands.
In spite of territorial changes following the Second World 1 1
War when the Polish-Soviet frontier was made to pass ' '
through the middle of the forest, preservation of wild life
has continued to develop. The Soviet Government at that

Champion sprinters
off fftie animal world
The African cheetahs, or hunting leopards, in these remarkable close-up
views look for all the world like a family party of domesticated cats. Cheetahs
are easily tamed and have cat-like characteristics: they purr when stroked,
climb trees and have the cat's tree-scratching habit. Their non-feline features
are their long legs, blunt non-retractile claws and paws resembling a dog's.
Weighing about 1 00 pounds, they can cover a quarter of a mile at an average
of 45 m.p.h. and have been known to sprint for short distances at over
70 m.p.h. (the top racehorse speed ever recorded is 45 m.p.h.). In ancient
Egypt they were used to hunt gazelles and hares (themselves top-rank
sprinters) and in the 15th century it is reported that Armenia's kings kept
hunting packs of over 100 cheetahs. Today cheetahs have become rare in
Asia and are also disappearing in Africa; in the extreme south and north
they have been completely exterminated. Hunting of the cheetah has
now been generally prohibited or else is strictly controlled in Africa.

time created a reserve to cover the part of the forest on
its side of the frontier. Hundreds of thousands of tourists
each year now visit this wild region.
Next to Europe, tropical Africa contains the greatest
number of protected zones lying astride neighbouring State
frontiers. The most spectacular region in Africa is the area
surrounding Lake Edward containing the Albert National
Park and the Queen Elizabeth National Park situated in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, in Rwanda and in Uganda.
This area contains examples of almost all the natural
surroundings of the Ethiopian region.
With an area of some 2 1/2 million acres, these two
national parks include an astonishingly varied countryside
such as the glaciers of Ruwenzori, the incandescent lava
lake of Nyiragongo, the rain forests of the Ituri, the savan¬
nah land of the tree-euphorbia in the plains of Rwindi-Rut-
schuru and the country bordering the Kazinga Channel.
Some of the most spectacular animal species live there,
often in densely populated herds including mountain gorilla,

are few areas In Africa where so much wild life can be seen
UGANDA-CONGO-RWANDA. Next to Europe
tropical Africa has the greatest number of protected zones
lying astride neighbouring frontiers. The most spectacular
region is the area containing the Albert National Park and
the Queen Elizabeth National Park situated in the Demo¬
cratic Republic of the Congo, in Rwanda and in Uganda
and surrounding Lake Edward where this photo of Afri¬
can marabou storks was taken. Thousands of marabous
have been killed for the soft white coverts of the under-
wing and tail, used for trimming women's clothing.
in the course of a journey involving so few miles.
An area made up of the Serengeti National Park and the
Mara Reserve situated further to the east and astride the
frontier between the Republic of Tanzania and the Republic
of Kenya also constitutes a unique ecological region but
very different from the one just described. Livestock,
including over a million zebra, wildebeest, Grant and Thom¬
son gazelle, in addition to quite a considerable number of
giraffe, black rhinoceros and, of course, carnívora (lion,
cheetah, leopard, hyena, jackal and others) live in these
immense plains and emigrate with the movement of the
rainbelts.
A few miles away, the giant Ngorogoro Crater provides
us with one of the natural wonders of the world (See Unesco
Courier, Sept. 1961) while the Gorge of the Olduvai contains
a unique sequence of fossilized deposits from Homo Habilis
and Zinjanthorope to Homo Sapiens. Nowhere else on earth
provides more data on the complex history of the emergence
of man in the world.
The "W" National Park of the Niger (named after its
W-shaped form) in West Africa, lying astride the three fron¬
tiers of Niger, Upper Volta and Dahomey is, to some extent
a kind of western counterpart of the two spectacular regions
of East Africa just described. Considerable herds of ele¬
phant, buffalo, hippopotamus, antelope and cob as well
as the great carnívora are found there.
Unesco and nature conservation
Alain Gille Problems concerning the conservation of the world's
natural resources and particularly its wildlife have always
been one of Unesco's major preoccupations. In this
vast field it has collaborated closely with the U.N. Food
and Agriculture and the International Union for Conser¬
vation of Nature and Natural Resources.
Important developments have taken place in Africa,
in particular, following an international conference on
the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in
Modern African States, held at Arusha (Tanzania) in
1961. In 1963, a Unesco mission led by Sir Julian Huxley
made an on-the-spot-investigation of nature conserva¬
tion problems in Ethiopia. At Ethiopia's request Unesco
has now sent three specialists to help the country carry
out a conservation programme. A Unesco Regional Cen¬
tre for Science and Technology, whose creation was
decided by the recent Unesco General Conference, is
now being set up in Nairobi (Kenya). One of its tasks
will be to help African governments solve their conser¬
vation problems.
Asia's conservation problems will be discussed at an
international conference to be held in Bangkok under
Unesco's auspices later this year.
In Latin America, the Charles Darwin Station, an
international laboratory equipped for important scientific
research, was inaugurated in January 1964 in the Gala¬
pagos Islands a zoological site with unique characte¬
ristics. Its creation came about through close and con¬
tinued co-operation between Unesco, the International
Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources,
the International Charles Darwin Foundation for the
Galapagos Islands and the government of Ecuador.
The first international conference of world-wide scope
aiming at the development of national parks and an
increased understanding of the problems involved was
held in July 1962 at Seattle (U.S.A.). Among other recom¬
mendations the conference proposed the creation of
national marine parks; several such parks have now
been set up and projects for others are being studied.

Until recently elephants

snow-capped peaks as
Kilimanjaro in East Africa.
Because of unrestricted
hunting to obtain their
huge ivory tusks (record

have disappeared from a
number of regions. In
the past forty years ele¬

set up and the elephant

it was estimated at 23,500
head in 1959. Right, an

There are at present not many "protected zones" astride
international frontiers in America. On the Canadian-United
States frontier, the area made up of the Glacier National
Park and Waterton National Park is an exception and it
bears the propitious name, The International Peace Park.
Species of the great temperate mountain fauna, from the
giant grizzly bear to the white Rocky Mountain goat live here
in a majestic setting of high mountain ranges. With a little
patience and luck one can sometimes approach to within
a few metres of the timid mountain goats.
Unfortunately, in Latin America the proportion of wild life
has not reached the same stage of development as in other
countries. There are, however, encouraging signs of future
collaboration between people interested in wild life pro¬
tection in the various countries. Brazil and Argentina have
established two adjoining national parks around the famous
Iguassu Falls with an area of 640,000 acres which will
ensure the protection of not only the incomparable falls
themselves but also the interesting forest fauna and flora
of this part of the temperate tropics.
It is to be hoped that this first example of concern for
wild life will be followed by others, particularly in the Repub¬
lics of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador in the Andes
Mountains. Here, the mountain forest areas and the strange
paremos, or mountain plateaux, are deteriorating at an
alarming rate.
We may wonder why national parks are not found well
within countries rather than in frontier areas, which in fact
facilitates the joint development and exploitation of poten
tial wealth from the tourist trade and the natural resources
in these frontier regions.
There are at least two reasons for this. Frontiers bet¬
ween States often correspond with natural barriers, par¬
ticularly high mountain chains which have always been
relatively underpopulated and where there is little agri¬
cultural and industrial development. It is, therefore, not
surprising that natural vegetation and wild animal life should
be better preserved in such economically marginal areas.
But this is not always the case. Sometimes nature takes
advantage of man's hostility towards his neighbour. It is
not difficult to find examples of countries where extensive
forest and plain with. their fauna, wet lands and islands owe
their prolonged protection to the restrictions on movement
by people as well as on land development imposed by
military and customs regulations.
By a curious irony of fate, human antagonism has in this
case served the cause of wild life. It is for generations
to come to seize the opportunity of ensuring the continued
existence of the countryside and natural monuments which
owe their survival to their ancestors' mutual suspicion in
times past.

### 32976: What TV is doing to our children

Television has now become a world-wide force after developing in the past fifteen
years more quickly than was ever expected. As it continues to spread at an amaz¬
ing pace, entering more and more into the lives of people on every continent, what
impact does it make, especially on the ideas and behaviour of children? During the
past decade the spotlight of research has been seeking out some of the answers
to this question. A guide to present knowledge on this subject, gathered and
analyzed in many countries, has now been compiled and published by Unesco in
the form of an international annotated bibliography, "The Effects of Television on
Children and Adolescents", edited by Wilbur Schramm (No. 43 in Reports and
Papers on Mass Communication; French and English versions; $1.00, 5/-, 3.50 F.)
Below Professor Schramm sums up the results of the world-wide research carried
out on this subject.
ESTIMATES from different countries indicate
that the average child of elementary school
and high school age (six to sixteen) devotes to television
from twelve to twenty-four hours a week. Elementary
school children spend, on the average, a little more time
viewing than do high school students.
In the United States, where the most extensive measure¬
ments of viewing by children of different ages have
been made, it is estimated that a child of three is already
averaging about forty-five minutes a day on television.
By the time, the child is in the first grade (age five or six),
he is spending about two hours a day in front of the televi¬
sion set. The time spent watching TV slowly increases
with age and with later bedtimes, until a peak is reached
at the age of twelve or thirteen when the average child is
viewing about three hours a day. During the high school
years (thirteen to sixteen), the viewing time decreases to
about two hours a day.
This curve is consistent with other evidence on the
subject, and the daily averages are not unlike those found
in England or Japan. In England, it was found that
children ten to eleven and thirteen to fourteen years old
averaged about 1.9 hours a day, which is a little less than the
American average for those ages. This may be because less
television and fewer station choices are available in Eng¬
land. German youth, fifteen to twenty years old, averaged
only seven to eight hours a week, or barely over an hour
a day. Its is not known whether this is a result of less tele¬
vision being available in Germany or of the age group
selected or because there is a real difference in television's
attractiveness to young people of different countries.
WHEREVER television becomes available for a
number of hours a day it dominates the leisure
time of children. Hilde Himmelweit, A.N. Oppenheim and
Pamela Vince in "Television and the Child," based on stu¬
dies made in England, have suggested several principles
that help to explain the changes television brings about in
leisure patterns. The activities most readily sacrificed are
those which satisfy the same needs as television, but less
effectively.
For example, younger children will go less often to the
cinema when they have television in their homes; they
will read fewer comic books, and read less magazine
fiction; they will spend less time on radio. These acti
vities meet about the same needs as television. But the
reading of newspapers and non-fiction books will hardly
be affected by television because these activities answer
different needs than does television. Similarly, the ado¬
lescent's cinema-going will be less affected than will the
younger child's, because for the adolescent the cinema
represents a valued social experience, whereas for the
younger child it represents television in a theatre.
HE impressive figure that emerges from the
studies of television and leisure time is the
enormous amount of time devoted to T.V. during childhood.
An average child six to sixteen years old in any of the
countries where more than a few hours of television is
available and where children's viewing time has been
measured in detail, can be counted on to spend between
500 and 1,000 hours a year in front of the picture tube.
This is a total of 6,000 to 12,000 hours during the twelve
school years. The larger of these figures is not far diffe¬
rent from the amount of time an average child spends in
school during those same years, taking into account vaca¬
tions and holidays.
Effect on Taste. Because children spend so much time
on television, chiefly on programmes not noted for their
cultural content, critics have wondered whether television
"demeans" children's taste for entertainment. The research
carried out has some interesting things to say on the
subject.
When children begin at an early age to watch television,
they usually start with children's programmes puppets,
animals, story-telling, children's songs, and so forth. Very
soon, however, they discover adult programmes, and come
to prefer them. Above all, they prefer the more violent
type of adult programme including the western, the adven¬
ture programme, and crime drama. The result is that, even
in the early elementary school years, they view more
adult programmes than children's programmes. This pref¬
erence for adult programmes has been reported from
every country where a choice is available and where
children's viewing has been studied. In the United States,
it has been noted that as much as two-thirds of children's
viewing was of programmes in which adults make up the
majority of the audience.
Children's taste patterns are fairly well structured by
the age of ten or eleven. A child who likes a given kind of

WHAT TV IS DOING (Cont'd)
Confusing worlds of
fantasy and reality
programme on television will be likely to enjoy correspond¬
ing material in popular magazines or in films.
The question has been raised whether children "see what
they like," or "like what they see." In other words, do
they come to enjoy violent programmes because no very
attractive alternatives are available or do the more violent
programmes fill so much of the air time because children
do not like programmes which critics would say are at
a higher "cultural level"? This question is by no means
settled, but the research does contain at least one interest¬
ing finding relating to it.
Dr. Himmelweit and her colleagues found that when only
one channel was available in England, and children had
only the choice of ceasing to view or viewing a programme
which they did not expect to find very interesting, they
often chose to see that programme and became interested
in it. Thus their tastes broaden and may be raised in
average level. However, when choices are available,
children tend to choose the type of programme which they
have previously found interesting and thus their tastes
are hardened and narrowed.
Learning from Television. Abundant evidence has now
accumulated that a good teacher can teach effectively by
television, though no one contends that all the useful acti¬
vities of education can be carried on by television.
There is real hope that instructional television may
"enrich" many classes, that it may furnish expert teaching
In fields where few experts are available (in the teaching
of foreign languages in elementary school), that it may
add new strength to home and extension teaching, and that
it may be useful in some of the developing countries
where teachers are in short supply.
Does home television cause a student to do better work
in school? This is a hard question to answer. But there
is little evidence that television helps children's school
performance or that children's grades are poorer when they
have television at home. Lower grades go with heavy
viewing but the viewing is not necessarily the basic cause
of the poor performance. The observation of most students
of children's television behaviour is that heavy viewing
tends to be a symptom of stresses or frustration or un¬
satisfactory human relationships. The same stresses or
unsatisfactory relationships might also reduce a child's
efficiency in school, and the frustration of failing to do
good work in school might result in heavier viewing.
24
OST of the debate, however, has centred not on
the effect of television on school grades or on
the effectiveness of instructional television, but rather on
the incidental learning which children derive from the two
hours or more a day they spend on entertainment television.
Does television broaden their horizons? Does it teach
them skills desirable or undesirable? Does it give them a
distorted view of the adult world?
The general conclusion, as summed up by Dr. Himmel¬
weit recently in a statement concerning the British film
inquiry, is disappointment that television does not teach
children more than it does. "Surely a medium with such
possibilities as television should be able to do more,"
she writes. "We should by now be able to point with
pride to a younger generation more curious, better inform¬
ed, more enterprising through having been able to' offer
them a window to the world. What is wrong? It seems
to me a devastating indictment that while ten-year-olds
still pick up some knowledge from television, by the time
Children's television programmes
often present themes and stories
which have attained well-estab¬
lished popularity through books
and the cinema. Youngsters wel¬
come a reunion with familiar
characters. In the case of French
children these include the mari¬
ners who figured in a television
programme based on Jules
Verne's well-known book. "The
Mysterious Island" (right). To
cater for the child's taste for
fantasy there is no lack of charm¬
ing and humorous programmes
spiced with music and poetry.

they reach thirteen only the dull ones do so, and that the
television hold becomes less the more intelligent the
child. . . It must give even more cause for reflection to
realize that these children view almost exclusively pro¬
grammes designed for family and adult entertainment. Is it
perhaps that much of the evening's entertainment is at the
level of a ten to eleven-year-old?"
It was found in Canada that children in a television town
came to the first grade of school with vocabularies about
a year more advanced than children in a town without
television. Half a dozen years later, however, the differ¬
ences had disappeared, and the children with television
knew actually less about public affairs although more
about entertainment matters) than the children without
television. Here, as in other studies, it was found that
in the early school years the bright children seem to
learn more from television whereas after age twelve or thir¬
teen the slower children seem to use television more and
gain more from it while the brighter ones depend more and
more on print. However, there is also some evidence
that parents and teachers think the level of general know¬
ledge is increased by television.
Studies of television content, of course, vary in their
results from country to country but many of them point
out that television brings a child face to face with adult
problems long before he ordinarily would meet them, and
in some countries this tends to give him a view of adult
life that is distorted in terms of social class, desirable
occupations and violent ways of solving problems. To
what extent this television world view becomes a child's
real world view, affects his plans and expectations and
preparations, and controls his behaviour as an adult is
not yet fully known.
When Does Television Affect a Child's Outlook and
Values? Television has its maximum psychological effect
on children, according to one of the ablest writers on the
subject, when the values or viewpoints recur from pro¬
gramme to programme ; the values are presented in drama¬
tic form so that they evoke emotional reactions; they link
with the child's immediate needs and interests; the viewer
tends to be uncritical of and attached to, the medium; and
when a viewer, through his friends, parents, or immediate
environment, is not already supplied with a set of values
which would provide a standard against which to assess
the view offered on television.
Thus, in order to predict the effect of television one

Polish Television
must know something about the television and something
about the child. A child with high aggression will probably
make special use of the aggressive materials he finds in
a television programme. Many children may learn from
a television crime programme how a holdup is committed,
but only a few children for example, some who have psy¬
chopathic tendencies or have fallen under the influence
of a criminal gang are likely ever to make use of this
information. For most children, television is a pleasing
experience, a relaxation of tensions and relief from pressing
problems; but to some it is a confusing experience be¬
cause they are unable entirely to separate the fantasy world
of television from the real world. Thus the same television
programme will not have the same effect on all children
any more than will the same child derive the same effect
from all programmes.
But there is one element in the relation of child to
programme which seems rather more important than any
of the others in determining what effect the programme has.
This is the extent to which the child can identify with one
or more of the characters in a programme.
Television and Delinquency. Most students of television
effects on children are unwilling to say that identification
or incidental learning from television plays any large part
in causing delinquency or crime. The roots of this crimi¬
nal behaviour lie far deeper than television; they reach
into the personality, the family experience, the relation¬
ships with others in the same age group as the delinquent
or criminal individual. At most, television can be merely
a contributory cause, and is likely to affect only the child
who is already maladjusted and delinquency-prone.
Television may contribute by teaching a criminal skill
which may be used when the individual decides to commit
a crime. It may trigger off an act of delinquency by
feeding a child's aggressive nature. Or it may encourage
delinquent behaviour by implanting an unreal idea of the
importance of violent behaviour in solving human prob¬
lems. But in any of these cases television by itself can¬
not make a normal, well-adjusted child into a delinquent.
This is the almost unanimous conclusion of research and
clinical investigation.
The Effect of Violence. Because so much of the enter¬
tainment a child sees on television is violent, special
attention has been paid by researchers to the possible
effect of all this violence. The original hypothesis was
that television violence might serve as a safety valve, by
means of which a child might rid himself vicariously of
pent-up aggressions. However, a series of experiments
have now come out with exactly the opposite result.
The typical method used in such experiments is to
frustate a group of children so that they develop a high
level of aggression. Then they are shown a film or a
television recording of a drama in which aggressive be¬
haviour plays a prominent part. (In different experiments,
the ending, the type of aggression, the . nature of the
character, and other elements of the story are varied.)
A similar group of children, who have not been frustrated,
are shown the same programme. Then, the members of
the two groups are given chances to express any aggres¬
sion they may have either by behaviour or in tests of some
type.
Invariably, there has been a great difference between
the experimental and the control group. The children
who were not frustrated (the control group) seem no more
aggressive than they were before seeing the picture. But
the children who were initially frustrated (the experimental
group) have not reduced their aggression; if anything, they
have built it up. They have in many cases found ways to
express it.
WE know that children with high levels of
aggression are especially attracted to violent
programmes on television. If television now feeds rather
than reduces children's aggressive tendencies and if it
gives them hints as to how to take out aggression with
fists, knives, or guns, then an opportunity may come to use
those weapons at a moment when they are angry. We
assume this does not happen often because social norms
teach them not to behave in such a way. But certainly
there is little to make us believe that violent programmes
on television reduce the likelihood of violence in real life.
Suppose an aggressive child regularly identifies with
a hero who himself uses violence to solve problems. For
example, French investigators found that delinquent boys
were very fond of a certain film hero who "fights. . . knows
how to treat women. . . overcomes all obstacles . . .respects
no moral code and frequently plays an ambiguous role;
one can never tell whether he is on the side of the police
or the side of the gangsters." Analysing the reactions of

From escapism to learning

the boys they were studying, they concluded that such
a mass media experience as this is especially dangerous
for Juvenile delinquents or potential delinquents.
On the whole, the weight of the evidence is behind
one researcher's conclusion that "the heavy dosage of
violence in the mass media," although not a major deter¬
minant of crime or delinquency, "heightens the probability
that someone in the audience will behave aggressively
in a later situation."
Television and Maladjustment. One of the most im¬
portant topics in the literature of television research is
the relation of television experience to a child's social
adjustment and his mental health. This has not yet
been adequately examined because of the scarcity of
clinical studies, and only tentative conclusions are possible.
There is ample evidence, however, that television some¬
times frightens children, and of what kind of material is
most frightening. But children often like to be frightened
(witness the popularity of the roller-coasterl). And no
scholar contends that television is likely to have a harm¬
ful effect on the social adjustment or the mental health of
a child who enjoys warm and solid relationships at home
and with his friends and who has no foundation of mental
illness.
For this reason, parents have been advised that the
greatest defence they can raise against possible ¡II effects
of television is to make their children feel loved and
secure at home, and to help them to satisfactory relation¬
ships with friends of their own age. And so far as fright
is concerned, parents can help their children to avoid
programmes that are too frightening.
Dr. Lawrence Z. Freedman, a psychiatrist, points out that
most children in a reasonably stable environment, do not
confuse the make-believe world of television with the real
experiences of personal and family relationships. "Most
youngsters find the immediate personal relationships more
compelling and rewarding than the animated, pictorial sub¬
stitutes," he says. ". . . The intensity and psychic signifi¬
cance of the child's response to television is the reciprocal
of the satisfaction he gains in the milieu of his family,
school, and friends. One would predict that the less intelli¬
gent, the most disturbed youngsters, and those having the
poorest relationships with their families and peers would
be most likely to immerse themselves in televiewing as
escape and stimulus."
| OES television make children passive and with¬
drawn? There is no proof that it does, although
television clearly may contribute to passivity and withdrawal
when there is already a tendency present. As Dr. Freed¬
man points out, "when the automobile removed youngsters
from the surveillance of their homes, we were concerned
for their morals. Now television immobilizes them in the
living room and we deplore their passivity." Nor is there
any real evidence that television is good or bad for home
life. It keeps children more often at home. But watching
television in a group does not seem to make for a really
strong group relationship; each member of the family
reacts individually, more often than as part of a group,
to the television he sees. The conclusion is that television
is not likely either to ruin a healthy home relationship or
rescue an unhealthy one. And a reasonable corollary is
that the quality of a child's social relationships is more likely
to control his use of television, than vice versa.
In general, the evidence on physical effects is negative.
Television postpones average bedtimes a few minutes, but
seems to decrease sleeping time very little because children
who have stayed up later appear to go to sleep more
quickly. It is true that there are reports of children who are
frightened by evening television and unable to go to sleep,
and of children who are sleepy in school because they have
stayed up late at night to see a programme, but none of
the studies can find any evidence of widespread fatigue or
other physical effect related to television. Indeed, there is
some reason to think that standards of behaviour set by
the parents may have more to do than television with late
bedtimes, and that if these same homes did not have tele¬
vision the children might still stay up late for other pur¬
poses.
Nor is there any evidence that television, viewed properly,
has a bad effect on children's eyesight. Some specialists
say that reading is as likely as viewing to cause eyestrain,
and others that viewing is good "exercise" for the eyes.
In general ophthalmologists advise children to view tele¬
vision in a room where the television receiver is not the
only source of light, not to sit closer than six feet from the
screen and to sit with the screen at approximately eye level.
(The British ophthalmologists say, "eye level or slightly
below"; the Polish say, "eye level, or a bit higher.") Even
eye weariness resulting from protracted and improper
viewing can be overcome in a short period of rest, a Japa¬
nese study found.
WE are now rich in surveys, and except where a
country which has not had a large survey wants
a broad picture of the television behaviour of its children
in order to see how their behaviour is different from that
revealed by other surveys, there seems less need now for
survey than for experiment. Perhaps the most obvious
need is for additional close experimental and clinical studies
of the effect which a given kind of television has on a given
kind of child. It may be a long time before close, careful
studies like these answer all the questions posed, by the
effect of television on children, but without such studies we
shall never be able to say clearly and sharply what are
measuring and where our results apply. Whenever possi¬
ble these studies should be extended over a period of
years, so that we may begin to understand the cumulative
effects of television.
Another aspect of television which deserves more atten¬
tion is the problem of how to realize the potential of the
medium. Some disappointment has been expressed at the
fact that television has not completely fulfilled its potential
as a window on the world, that it has not given us a better
informed and more enquiring generation, and that Is has
merely provided the average child with two to .three hours
of daily entertainment.
Perhaps now we should study how to make the non-
entertainment, non-fictional programmes on television more
interesting, so that they will attract their share of viewers
and contribute their share of learning. And perhaps we
need to study how taste is formed, so that instead of
narrowing our children's taste around a certain level of
entertainment we can broaden their television interest and
encourage them to use television when possible as a
window on the world rather than as a momentary escape
from the stresses of growing up.

dating from the 4th century B.C.
In ancient China arms and knives
were often used for trade and
barter and eventually miniature
replicas replaced them as coinage.
'EFORE man invented coins
'barter was the prevailing form
of trade. Evidence of some measure
of barter over very great distances can
be found as far back as the Old Stone
Age. Flint, for example, which at that
time was in very great demand, was
exchanged between Northern France
and Southern Germany. Barter was
subsequently extended to ornaments
and implements (flint weapons, amber
ornaments), and, when the use of
metals began, copper, tin, bronze and
gold became important items of trade.
The great rivers already served as
trade routes, as in the case of the
amber route. In Ancient Rome, on the
other hand, in the fifth century B.C.,
cattle were still the most important
measure of value. The original name
for cattle in Latin was "pecus", whence
"pecunia", and, in Homer's writings,
the ox was still the standard of value:
Menelaus's armour is worth nine oxen,
while Glaucus's is worth as many as
one hundred.
The increasingly brisk trade across
the frontiers of individual towns and
states made it necessary, however, to
adopt a common measure of value.
Herein lies the great significance of
money and consequently of coins.
Money, however, does not always con¬
sist of coins. Cowrie shells, which were

already known as a means of payment
In East Asia as early as 1300 B.C. or
thereabouts, still circulated until quite
recently as money in Africa. The large
perforated limestone disks, which
played an important rôle as a medium
of exchange on the South Sea Island
of Yap, are well-known.
In the nineteenth century, tea
pressed into brick from (tea-brick
money) was used as currency in Tibet,
and in the second century B.C.,
spades, knives and other implements
were used for payment In China, which
was then already highly civilized. At
the end of the Shang dynasty (about
1.200 B.C.), these working implements
were replaced as a means of payment
by small replicas made from the same
metal. They were not, however, true
coins such as those used today.
To whom, then, do we really owe
the invention of coinage, which was to
have such Important consequences?

GREEK writers have left us
reliable accounts of the in¬
vention of coined money. The historian
Herodotus and the philosopher Xeno-
phanes, who were both born In Asia
Minor, ascribe the invention of coinage
to the Lydians. The latter were the
dominant power in Asia Minor in the
seventh, and the first half of the sixth,
century B.C. Gyges, the founder of the
Lydian dynasty (687-652 B.C.), may be
considered to be the real "inventor" of
coin money.
The first coins were made of elec-
trum, a natural compound of gold and
silver, found in the Lydian rivers. At
first, they were plain, nugget-like
objects bearing no image. It was only
later on that an image was stamped on
coins, but, at the beginning, only on the
obverse; the reverse showed one or
two impressed squares produced by
the punch with which they were struck.
A little later, on the island of Aegina,
the first silver coins were minted, and
shortly afterwards the first coins of the
rich seaport of Corinth and the first
Athenian coins appeared. In 593 B.C.,
Solon, the founder of the Attic politi¬
cal constitution, reorganized the coin¬
age system and minted the first large
silver coins of four drachmas (tetra-
drachma). For the first time, these
coins had images on both sides. While
the Aegina coins were stamped with a
rough representation of a turtle, the
Corinthian coins bore a winged horse
and the Attic coins were adorned with
an owl. In ancient times, the Aegina
coins were known as "turtles", the
Corinthian coins as "fillies" or "foals",
and the Attic coins as "owls". The
coins of these three towns were widely
current.
The noble art of coining spread with
astonishing rapidity in Greece in the
sixth century B.C., and from %there it
reached the West about 550 B.C.
Two centuries after their invention,

about 480 B.C. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom and pro¬

HUMAN-HEADED BULL. Half-man, half-animal, this river-

city where this silver coin of four drachmas (.95 in.) was minted about
425 B.C.
CAPTIVE LEADER. The expressive portrait on this silver denarius
I (.47 in.) is the work of a Roman engraver, L. Hostilius Saserna
(about 45 B.C.). With its air of resignation and its cheeks hollowed
by suffering, the face is probably that of Vercingetorix, leader of
the Gauls, who, after his capture by the Romans at the battle of
Alesia, was taken to grace Caesar's triumph in Rome in 46 B.C.
ATHENIAN OWL. For several centuries Attic coins bore the
figure of the owl, symbol of Athena, the patron goddess of
Athens. An olive branch, symbol of peace, and a crescent moon
also figure on this silver piece of four drachmas (1 in.) dating from
about 430 B.C.

coins were already being widely used
throughout the Greek world. They pro¬
moted trade by land and sea; they
enabled the citizen to amass money for
himself. When, later on, the Persians
made the gold daric the basis of a
single uniform currency for their whole
great empire, and when the practices
of interest accounting, pledging, pro¬
curation and security were taken over
from Babylon, all the conditions for
world trade as we know it today were
established.
The dies were carved by hand and
the coins themselves were stamped by
hand on an anvil. The Greek artist's
genius made the coin a work of art.
No coin was identical with another, and
no other people in the world has
ennobled "money" as a product of
artistic skill, to the same extent as the
ancient Greeks.
The representations stamped on the
coins were extremely varied. First
came representations of the gods in
all their shapes and forms; there is also
a striking variety of animals and plants.
The image of a living person appeared
on coins for the first time in Europe
during the reign of Demetrius Polior-
cetes of Macedonia (306-283 B.C.).
Greek coins finally penetrated deep
into India, but Greek power was vis¬
ibly declining. Rome was rearing its
head. The images of indigenous gods
and rulers were replaced by portraits
of proud Roman emperors.
It was only in the fourth century B.C.
when the Greek art of coining was
at its height that the formless lumps
of bronze used as money by the
Romans were shaped and marked to
become a state coinage. The first
coins, however, were cast and not
struck. The actual minting of Roman
silver coins did not begin until about
269 B.C. The basic unit was the silver
denarius. In the year 44 B.C., the
Senate conferred on Caius Julius Cae¬
sar the right to have his head portrayed
on coins. This was the first time that
the image of a living person had
appeared on Roman money.
Under the Emperor Augustus, the
line of development which was to make
Roman money a pattern for all future
currencies was started. The Emperor's
head thenceforth adorned the obverse
of coins, while the reserve was used
for State propaganda. At that time
there was no press, radio or television
and so coins became the "common
man's newspaper". Domestic and
foreign political events were commem¬
orated. The worship of the gods,
social policy and architecture were all
recorded on coins in pictures and
words.
THE minting of gold and silver
coins was the prerogative of
the Emperor himself, whereas the
Senate had a certain say in the minting
of bronze hence the two letters S.C.
(Senatus Consulto) imprinted on
copper coins. The imperial coins
minted during the first two centuries
A.D. are of surpassing beauty. This
is particularly true of the large bronze
coins, the sesterces. The magical
effect of the patina gives them the
lustre of rare jewels.
Rome's rule lasted for many centu¬
ries, but in the latter days of the Roman
Empire coin design became steadily
flatter and sketchier, and it is not
always possible to recognize the effigy
of the ruler. The slow decline of the
Roman Empire was accompanied by
the decline of the coinage in general.
It was a long time before the unmis¬
takable Buzantine style left its mark on
the imperial coins. The Byzantine
coins are simple, austere and highly
stylized.
Like every other art, coining has its
seasons of greatness and its periods
of decline. The art of coining in the
early middle ages cannot compare with
that of classical antiquity. The nor¬
thern peoples can show nothing to
rival the peerless mastery of the
ancients in all branches of the visual
arts.
From the end of the seventh cen¬
tury on, Charlemagne's mint regula¬
tions provided the standard for the
greater part of Europe. The most im¬
portant coin was the denarius or penny.
But even then the coinage steadily
deteriorated. The right of coinage was
the prerogative of the king, who ceded
it for money to margraves, palsgraves,
abbots and bishops. Almost all those
who enjoyed the right of coinage tried
to derive the maximum profit from
their prerogative.
In the middle of the twelfth century,
the penny became so thin that it was
no longer possible to make a clear
stamp on both sides. In those times of
need, the mint masters remembered
the ancient technique of hollow stamp¬
ing which had never died out. The new
one-sided pennies were called bractea-
tes. For those who enjoyed the prero¬
gative of coining, they represented a
productive source of revenue. They
were often called in within a year of
issue, and nine new coins were
exchanged for twelve old.
Shortly after the death of Frede¬
rick II, the powerful city of Florence
minted its own gold coins, florins, bear¬
ing the city's lily escutcheon. Venice
followed suit in 1284 with its ducats.
The Gothic style then made its appea¬
rance. The Gothic gold coins are
magnificent, particularly the English
noble, which was coined for the first
time by Edward III to commemorate his

naval victory over the French off Sluis
(July 12, 1340).
With the Renaissance came larger
silver coins. In 1486, the world's first
thalers were coined at Hall in the Tyrol.
At that time, they were still known
as "Guldengroschen". Later develop¬
ments, by way of Saxony and the sil¬
ver-mine of the Counts von Schlick in
Joachimethal (Bohemia), led finally to
their being known as "Taler" (thaler).
This great silver coin conquered the
whole world. In Scandinavia it became
the "rigsdaler"; the English took it
over as the "crown", the French as the
"ecu", the Italians as the "tallero", the
Spaniards as the "peso", the Russians
as the "rouble" and finally the Ameri¬
cans as the "dollar". At the end of the
eighteenth century, this extremely
popular silver coin also reached the
Far East.
Coins have gone through all the
stages in the evolution of culture: rise,
apogee, decline.
All peoples have coined money, and
confidence in coinage and, conse¬
quently, in currency has become a
question of confidence between the
peoples. Money appears most strik¬
ingly as a link between peoples in the
tourist trade.
Whereas, in ancient times, in the
middle ages and at the beginning of
the modern era, trade necessitated the
transport of money with a heavily
armed escort, today it is generally
carried through by book transfers and
bank transactions instead of transfers
of specie.
Money as such, it is true, no longer
appears as a link between peoples
except to a minor extent. This applies
particularly to coins, i.e. "hard cash"
though few currencies today can claim
to be designated "hard"! Neverthe
less, it is impossible to imagine pre¬
sent-day international relations without
money to fulfil its function as an
internationally recognized measure of
value.
Money may even be sa!d to play a
certain part as a means of transmitting
information, in so far as coins, and
now more particularly bank-notes, are
representative of national pride: great
figures in the history and culture of a
nation, scenes and symbols of nation¬
al life, or even of humanity transcend¬
ing national bounds (as the guiding
principles of peoples) are set before
other nations by means of the coining
press or the bank-note printing press.

### 31779: Words under a mask

Words under a mask
Let us become more suspicious of our own "wisdom."
Anatole France once said of a man, "He flattered
himself on being a man without prejudices; and this
pretension itself is a very great prejudice." In "The
Devil's Advocate: A Plea for Superstition," written in 1909,
Sir James G. Frazer argued that so-called superstitions
more often than not embody a realistic distillation of ex¬
perience whereby the unitiated and unwary may receive
tested guidance. Behind many "myths" are "truths" which
have helped people to rationalize and maintain social order
and organization.
Thus, for example, a "superstition" long held in some
local area that a certain marsh is "haunted" may seem
ridiculous at first but it may be a shorthand way of saying
that the number of people who enter it and the number
who emerge continually shows a marked discrepancy.
Until the cause of deaths in the marsh possibly malaria
is identified and dealt with, the local "respect" for the
area is based on more than mere superstition.
Of course, much of what has been pointed out here will
not come as a revelation. None of the ideas are new
and, under different names, many of the General Semantics
techniques have been used by intelligent people who
have never heard of the word "semantics", let alone been
exposed to the writings of Korzybski and others.
So much the better. Our concern is not so much with
(Cont'd from page 12)
how people distinguish between a "map" and the physical
territory which it describes, but that they do distinguish.
George Orwell writes, "What is above all needed is to
let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way
about. . . Probably it is better to put off using words as
long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one
can through pictures and sensations."
No one is suggesting that all abstractions be distrusted.
"In demanding that people cease reacting to abstract
names as if they were realities-in-themselves," says
S. I. Hayakawa, "we are merely saying in another way,
'Stop acting like suckers'." And until we do give more
disciplined attention to words, we will continue to stockpile
symbols and labels while the "precious commodities"
which are being symbolized and labeled escape our
detection and comprehension. The argument-ending
gambit, "It is only a matter of semantics" must give way
to the more sophisticated recognition that the "real"
search for "meaning" often starts where words leave off.

sophisticated brethren or sometimes the terms are relics of
a convenient analogy at the descriptive phase of a subject.
For example, we know how the word "fission" came into
nuclear physics. Hahn and Strassmann found that when
they bombarded uranium with neutrons the element broke
up into two portions of roughly similar mass. The result was
reported to their colleague Lise Meitner, then a refugee in
Stockholm. Her nephew, Otto Frisch, later Jacksonian Pro¬
fessor at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, was visit¬
ing her.
They discussed the implication and agreed that the like¬
ly explanation was that the absorption of a neutron had
disturbed the balance between the forces of attraction
and repulsion within the nucleus of the uranium atom. It
was as though the nucleus had become elongated and had
developed a waist before dividing into two. This seemed
to Frisch to be similar to the way living cells divide. When
he got back to Copenhagen, where he was then working
in Niels Bohr's institute, he consulted a biological colleague
and asked him what the biological term was and was
told "fission." This expropriation is still appropriate.
Exact scientists invented the term "atomic pile" and
then they themselves complained that it was inaccurate;
it was not "atomic," it was "nuclear;" and it was not a
"pile," it was a "reactor." Actually, in the squash court
at Stagg Field, of the University of Chicago, where Fermi
built it, it was called a "pile" because its significance was
known to very few and to most people it was just a heap
of graphite blocks and uranium metal. But the term was
a nuisance. We got stuck with "atomic pile." As science
editor of the London "News Chronicle," I spent nearly three
years converting the readers by writing "atomic pile (nu¬
clear reactor)" and, gradually, "nuclear reactor (atomic
pile)."
The most grotesque examples of misunderstandings and
misrepresentation of scientific facts are to be' found in the
field of atomic energy. With the release of atomic energy,
man created his own elemental gods. Forces like the
thunder, and the lightning, which our primitive ancestors
sought to appease, have been replaced by the Unseen,
the Unheard, the Unstated, the Unsmelt, the Unfelt, the
Unknown and the All-Pervading by the radiations which
have broken from the nucleus. This has created a new
superstition. That superstition, like the elemental gods, is
radioactive.
The fact that these new elements were arrived at by
the exercise of reason and can be rationally measured
and comprehended by the scientists is of little consolation
to those who do not understand the ways of science, and
who, in ignorance, instinctively regard science as meddling
with things which would better left alone. This is irrational
and deplorable but it is the ambiance of ignorance which
must be recognized in any discussion of the problems of
atomic energy.
In October 1957, the World Health Organization (WHO)
called together a group, of which I was a member, to study
the mental health aspects of the peaceful uses of atomic
energy. This group had at its disposal the reports of
many investigators in many parts of the world, not only
in the more sophisticated societies but also among the
people in the less-developed countries remote from news¬
paper headlines or nuclear text-books.
The findings of this WHO study group were superficial
but, even so, very disquieting. The disturbing features be¬
came plain. One was the universal disquiet about atomic
energy, not only of its potentialities for destruction in a
nuclear war, but even of its peacetime applications. The
group began to realize that the crust of our vaunted civili¬
zation was only egg-shell thick, and that, confronted with
the release of immeasurable power from the infinitesimally
small atom, civilized man tends to cower, like his Nean¬
derthal forefathers, in the dark caves of his own emo¬
tions. We were back in the "childhood of mankind."

Letters to the Editor
TAPPING HIDDEN WATER
Sir,
I read your special double issue
"Water and Life" (July-August, 1964)
with great interest, as it dealt with the
sort of problem that affects much of
Tanzania. During the greater part
of the year most of the area Is very
dry, and in the rainy season torrential
downpours wash all at once down to
the rivers taking with them a large
part of the topsoil, and leaving behind
sandy wastes.
Even in the dry season the rivers
here retain' lots of water beneath their
sandy beds. I have long been
considering how to make use of this
water to irrigate the nearby land and,
in the rainy season, how to use the
same means of Irrigation working the
opposite way to retain the water as
long as possible on the land and
thereby help it to Infiltrate the soil.
The main thing is to find a cheap way
to start the project so as to get other
people interested in doing the same
thing. For that reason I intended to
start a pilot project by digging a well
into the river bed and taking out the
water by means of windmills and canal
systems. Your Issue has made me
much more aware of the possibilities,
. but also of the dangers involved as
In the case of using salty water for
Irrigation, etc.

SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES
Sir.
Special thanks are due to you,
and to the noted scientists who also
made their contribution, for the Nov¬
ember 1964 issue.
I admire your courage In condem¬
ning the folly of politicians who lack
the courage to spend the sums
required to meet basic human needs,
preferring instead to devote a growing
proportion of their countries' revenues
to the tools of universal destruction.
What a striking comparison you
have drawn. On the one side you
show how thousands of millions of
dollars are swallowed up in producing
the means to kill millions of innocent
people, and leave those who might
escape the immediate effects of a
nuclear holocaust only a slim chance
of survival. As opposed to this
apocalypse, you present clear and
eloquent facts and figures showing
constructive and humanitarian alterna¬
tives that would bring health,
knowledge, skills and happiness to
all mankind.

Paris, France
Sir,
I was very shocked by your recent
Issue on nuclear hazards and the cost
of armaments not by its contents,
but by the fact that you actually
published such an issue.
Your official title is The United
Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, yet you publish
a political review presenting the views
of certain countries and distribute it in
another country which has decided,
rightly or wrongly, to follow a different
policy. This is unfortunate, at it might
well give the impression that Unesco
is something it should certainly not be.
I am not sure that I can say
"something it certainly Is not".

Sir,
Congratulations on your November
1964 issue. The stand you have
taken against war and above all
against all preparations for war can
leave no one in doubt as to your
sincerity and the value of what you
are trying to achieve.

Sir,
The article on Maria Montessorl

"education for peace" highlights the
importance of forging friendships
between the youth of different
countries. One of the most practical
and realistic ways to "educato for
peace" Is through philately In schools
which creates International exchanges
and stimulates an interest in other
countries.

which Argentina issued a stamp
honouring the late President John F.

Many of the children have been
encouraged to start stamp exchanges
with pen friends. It would mean a
great deal to them if others knew
about their club and wrote to them,
thus giving wider Interest to their

new titles have recently been added
to the Unesco Pocket Art Series: little
books that present high quality reproduc¬
tions of art masterpieces at popular prices.
They are: "Aboriginal Paintings" from Aus¬
tralia, "Greek Mosaics" of the Byzantine
Period, "Buddhist Paintings" from shrines
and temples in Ceylon, and "Czechoslova-
kian Miniatures" from Romanesque and Go¬
thic manuscripts. A co-operative effort by
publishers In different countries has made
possible a low sales price: 6/- for the
English edition end 95 cents for the U.S.
Unesco Pocket Art Series are published In
London by Collins, and in New York by
the New American Library of World Litera¬
ture, Inc.
'TALKING BOOKS': Besides its large
collection of texts transcribed into

Blind has set up a library of "talking
books", consisting of some 300 classical
works by Hungarian and other authors
recorded on tape. The tapes are also
loaned to blind Hungarians living abroad.

issue of Unesco's quarterly, "Education
Abstracts", (1) presents an interna¬
tional bibliography on out-of-school edu¬
cation, prepared for the recent Unesco
International Conference on Youth, held In
Grenoble, France. The review Includes

HOW MANY POLAR BEARS? An esti¬
mate based on a census made in
Alaska suggests there are some 18,000
polar bears in the world, all in the arctic
regions. Another estimate based on the
number of denning bears on Wrangel Island
In the Soviet Arctic puts the number at no
more than 5,000-8,000. A Canadian Wild¬
life Service official believes there are well
over 10,000. Whatever the total, the larg¬
est polar bear populations are in Alaska,
Canada and Norway (Spitsbergen).
TOOLS FOR SCIENCE TEACHING: Plan¬
ned by the Government of Burma with
Unesco's assistance, a plant to mass-pro¬
duce science teaching equipment for
Burma's schools and laboratories is going
Into operation at the Union of Burma
Applied Research Institute in Rangoon.
The project has been supervised by Bur¬
mese scientists and research officers and
a Unesco specialist from Sweden.
CZECH READERS' CLUBS: Readers'
clubs In Czechoslovakia now have a
total membership of 1,200,000 and include
two clubs for young readers, one for poetry
lovers and one for readers of technical
literature. Books selected by these clubs
are Issued in editions reaching several
hundred thousand; works by Edgar Allen
Poe were published in an edition of 210,000
and Tolstoy's "Anna Karenia" in an edition
of 179,000.

» lour-edition of "Your United Na¬
tions Official Guide Book" offers those
who cannot visit New York an attractive
and interesting tour-by-proxy of the United
Nations H.Q. The latest edition lavishly illus¬
trated In colour and black and white offers

H.Q. Available from U.N. sales agents this
12th edition, 1964, costs $1.50 (paperback)

U.N. stamp honours Education
It has been calculated that more than
two-fifths of the adult world popula¬
tion well over 700 million people
is Illiterate, and according to some
estimates the figure Is increasing by
20 to 25 million persons each year.
Illiteracy has disastrous effects on
economic and social progress; the
map of world illiteracy Is practic¬
ally identical with that of underdevelop¬
ment. A recent U.N. commemorative
stamp on "Education for Progress"
(right) focuses attention on this prob¬
lem and commemorates the work
already accomplished by the United
Nations and its Specialized Agencies,
including Unesco, to combat illitera¬
cy. The stamp is issued in 4, 5 and 11
cent denominations. As agent in

Barbara Ward
A Correction
The Unesco Courier published In
its September 1964 issue a series
of articles based on the Unesco
book "Women in the New Asia",
edited by the British sociologist,
Barbara E. Ward. Owing to a simi¬
larity in names, the author's note
published in this issue incorrectly
attributed to Miss Ward biographical
details concerning Barbara Ward,
(Lady Jackson) the British author
and economist.
Barbara E. Ward (in private life
Mrs. H. S. Morris) was lately lec¬
turer in anthropology at Birkbeck
College, University of London, and
is now at the University of London's
School of Oriental and African Stu¬
dies. In 1963-64 she was visiting
lecturer in the Department of Anthro¬
pology, Cornell University, Ithaca,
New York. Barbara E. Ward is a
member of the Royal Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,
the Association of Social Anthropo¬
logists, the British Sociological
Association and the Institute of Race
Relations, London. She is the author
of "A Chinese Fishing Village" (Jour¬
nal of Oriental Studies, University
of Hong-Kong, 1954); "Some Obser¬
vations on New Religious Cults In
Ashanti" (1956); and "Cash or Cre¬
dit Crops?" (Economic Development
and Cultural Change, Chicago, 1960).
Barbara Ward Jackson, Lady (Robert)
Jackson, joined the staff of The
Economist in 1939 as an Assistant
Editor. In 1957 she began lecturing
at Harvard University. She is the
author of "The International Share
Out" (1938); "Turkey" (1941); "The
West at Bay" (1948); "Policy for
the West" (1951); "Five Ideas that
Change the World" (1959); "India
and the West" (1961); "The Rich
Nations and the Poor Nations" (1962).
The Unesco Courier wishes to ex¬
press its regrets to both writers for
the error in its Sept. 1964 issue.
F/ashes.,!
For a total world population of 3,000
mi/lion there are only 1,5 mil/ion doctors,
reports W.H.O. While some countries have
one doctor for less than 500 inhabitants in
others the proportion is one to 50,000.
Yugoslavia has become the 24th country
to ratify the Convention Against Discrimi¬
nation in Education. The Convention came
into force in 1962 after adoption by the
Unesco General Conference. It is designed
to promote equality and justice in access
to education.
Some 300 mil/ion copies of nearly
8,000 daily newspapers are read by the
world's peoples reports a new Unesco
booklet, "World Press-Newspapers and
News Agencies". Material for newspapers
is provided by 150 news agencies operating
in 80 countries.
Through its current five-year teacher
training plan (1960-65) Pakistan is raising
the number of primary school teachers from
127.000 to 197,000. Under this plan two
education centres and 55 training schools
have been set up.

Since they were invented in Asia Minor some 2,600 years ago,
coins have served as travelling ambassadors, carrying images of
many peoples and their cultures across seas and frontiers to other
lands (see page 27). Many ancient coins, like this silver piece of
10 drachmas (diameter 1.25 in.) minted at Syracuse, a Greek colony
in Sicily, early in the 4th century B.C. are veritable works of art
in , metal. Among the Greeks, artistic merits were a primary con-

the artist, Kimon, is partly visible on the headband worn by the nymph.
