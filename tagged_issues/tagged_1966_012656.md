The teacher has still to win a
place in society worthy of his
calling. Too often is he regarded
as a kind of "poor relation" who,
in the satisfaction of accomplish¬
ing a noble and useful mission,
should find ample compensation
for his modest means of subsis¬
tence. At a time when a world
shortage of teachers and a vast
increase in school populations
are posing grave problems,
Unesco has convened an inter¬
governmental conference to study
recommendations designed to
improve the professional, social
and economic status of teachers

A FAIR DEAL
FOR THE TEACHER
by Jean Thomas
special intergovernmental conference convened by
Unesco is shortly to meet in Paris to consider and
adopt an international recommendation on the status of
teachers. The meeting will be the outcome of studies and
consultations carried out jointly by Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Labour Organization, with the help of many other
international governmental and non-governmental organiz¬
ations concerned with the progress of education. The aim
is to give the highest official approval to a set of well-defined
recommendations covering principles and standards whose
application would give primary and secondary schoolteachers
in every country a professional, social and economic standing
worthy of their calling. Why have Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Labour Organization decided to use such large-scale,
complex machinery to help resolve the problems of one
particular profession, and why has agreement between states
become necessary in a field where national law and custom
have always seemed adequate? The question is one which
applies equally to many other situations that have arisen in
the field of education.
FOR centuries, countries
and communities did their
best to provide young people with the
right kind of education. And then, as
education expanded and became
increasingly complex, the whole fabric
of the educational system began to
crack and crumble apart.
Just when the rising generations
were starting to crowd into the schools,
the schools were unable to find room
for them all. The need to build new
schools and to find teachers to staff
them became increasingly urgent. But
where education once managed quite
well with a few thousand primary or
JEAN THOMAS was Assistant Director-
General of Unesco from 1956 to 1960. He
was a member of the secretariat of the
Unesco Preparatory Commission in 1946
and in 1948 became Director of Unesco's
Department of Cultural Activities. He is
now an inspector-general in the French
Ministry of National Education.
secondary teachers, it now needs to
recruit tens and hundreds of thousands.
And there is hardly a country in the
world that is not facing this problem.
In matters of this kind people are
easily impressed by figures. So much
is heard about quantities: so many
schools to be built and equipped, so
many pupils to be taken in, so many
teachers to be recruited, so much for
capital investment, operating expend¬
iture and staffing costs.
Yet quantity is the least important
aspect of the problem. Even when
countries are quite prepared to make
all kinds of sacrifices to give their
young people an education, what
guarantee do they have that it will
be a good education, in other words,
that it will provide the intellectual and
moral training which young people
have the right to expect, and that it
will produce the leaders which every
nation needs? A country cannot afford
to make mistakes in the education of
its citizens any more than it can afford
them in matters of defence, nutrition
and health or in the exploitation of
its natural resources and the use of its
manpower.
Educational expansion is obviously a
desirable thing, but if it is made at
the expense of quality it soon becomes
a harmful one. That is why educational
planning, which has now become a
universal need, must produce an
accurate estimate of quantities, and a
no less precise assessment of the
level, type and methods of education
that will be needed in the future.
Governments throughout the world
are therefore anxious to reform educa¬
tion and to adapt existing structures,
curricula and methods to modern
needs. School systems based on time-
honoured tradition are everywhere
being transformed; new laws and
regulations are being adopted and old
ones rescinded; systems of selection
and study guidance are being ¡ntroduc-

FAIR DEAL FOR THE TEACHER (Continued)
Drawn to careers with greater prestige

ed or modified; programmes are being
streamlined or enriched with new sub¬
jects, and Increasing use is made of
fresh methods and teaching aids. Our
century, at least in appearance, is the
golden age of the science of teaching.
But ultimately the successful out¬
come of this tremendous effort is bas¬
ed on one factor: the competence and
devotion of men and women whose
profession it is to teach. Even when
schools are superbly built, equipped
with the finest libraries and apparatus
and provided with well planned
programmes, what sorts of results can
be expected if the teachers are lack¬
ing in talent, poorly trained or dis¬
satisfied with their conditions?
A good teacher can enhance the
value of education; a bad one can
jeopardize it. Whether one considers
the benefit to the individual child or
the collective interest of society, there
is no escaping the fact that the quality
of education always has been and
always will be directly linked with the
quality of the teacher.
Recruiting and training enough good
teachers, giving them the work best
suited to their aptitudes and tastes,
providing the salary, working con¬
ditions and career prospects which will
both enable and encourage them to
devote themselves wholeheartedly to
their work these are not simply the
answers to equitable demands; they
are also the soundest way to meet a
nation's needs. This is just as much a
matter of good economic management
as of equitable social organization.
Thus, the obligation to give teachers
their legitimate material and moral
position in society ranks high among
the factors that can improve educa¬
tion.
These facts are generally acknow¬
ledged, but only rarely is proper
thought given to all their implications.
The first of these, without a doubt,
is that a great many well-qualified
young people must be attracted to
teaching careers. And it is here that
the difficulties begin. The range of
professions demanding top-level can¬
didates with high intellectual and moral
qualities is increasing, and so is the
range of careers offering attractive
prospects to the young.
Teachers are often told especially
when they are meeting together that
theirs is the noblest of all professions.
This belief certainly does them honour,
and there is no lack of arguments to
uphold it. But what of priests, doctors,
architects, engineers and farmers, for
example? Is there not a nobility of
purpose in consoling the afflicted, help¬
ing the sick, building new towns,
designing machines capable of trans¬
forming standards of living, or in
simply growing food for others to eat?
Even administrative careers, long
considered as humdrum and lacking in
opportunities for initiative and respon¬
sibility, are daily increasing in prestige
because of their direct influence on
every aspect of community life. A
great variety of careers, all equally
useful and noble, now offer attractive
inducements to the intelligent young
man or woman who is eager to serve.
Teaching cannot therefore claim, as
in the past, to attract the very best
minds; and indeed it would not be
in society's interests if it did. The
needs of education must take their
place among many others; there can
be no question of giving them an
absolute priority.
However, these needs must not be
sacrificed either, since this would
create the most serious kind of imbal¬
ance in society. One of the essential
preliminaries to a profession, however
specialized, is a good general educa¬
tion; and it is the teacher's task to
provide this education. Thus, of all
public services, education is, if not
the most Important, at least the one
whose need is most immediately
obvious, and it is the duty of the state,
and in its own Interests, to see that
the teaching profession receives its
proper proportion of youthful talent.
This is the point on which public
opinion, and especially the opinion of
young people, needs convincing. It
is no exaggeration to say that the
public is generally ill-informed on the
role of the teacher in modern society.
At a time when so many other careers
are taking on new lustre because they
are seen to be closely linked with the
wonders of science and technology,
the teaching profession seems to be
set in very old habits.
In a world of constant change, where
newspaper articles and television
programmes make engineers, research
workers, doctors and surgeons appear
as pioneers, the teacher has practically
come to be considered as a survivor
from a bygone age. Newspapers,
books, theatre and cinema have all
helped to build up a stereotyped image
of the "typical" teacher: a man respect¬
ed for his honesty, conscientiousness

Inequalities in wages
and working conditions
In many Latin American countries, between 70 and 75 per cent of primary
schoolteachers are women. Teachers' salaries are generally very low In
some places less than those of unskilled workers. Generally speaking, a
qualified teacher earns less than a skilled worker, and in certain countries
a skilled worker is paid six times as much as a teacher. In one capital city,
for example, a qualified teacher earns as much as a building foreman; yet in
the rural areas of the same country a teacher receives hardly more than
three-fifths the salary of a building foreman. Since 60 to 70 per cent of
Latin America's people live in the countryside, the proportion of rural prim¬
ary teachers in the continent is extremely high.
In Africa, non-qualified teachers make up from ten to 30 per cent of teaching
staffs in some countries; in others they represent anything from 40 to 75
per cent. The majority of African teachers work under poor conditions,
often having to make do with dilapidated buildings or uncomfortable tents.
Many schools are built far from the main centres of population and are
often so isolated that teachers have difficulty not only in receiving school
equipment, as well as their salaries, but also in procuring food and water.
Many teachers, especially those in rural areas, are leaving the profession,
which is classed among the lower echelons of public service.
In Asia, teachers are less favoured, in terms of salary and status, than
other persons employed in public service.
In Europe, teachers' salaries have increased in most countries since 1938,
but the rate of increase has been slower for teachers than for office
employees and manual workers.

### Señorita Luciana, teacher in the High Andes
SEÑORITA
LUCIANA
Teacher in
the High Andes
Luciana Luna Yabar, a 26-year-old teacher
from Lima, the capital of Peru, was appoint¬
ed to run a small school in the province
of Cuzco for three years. Señorita Lu-
ciana's first problem was how to reach her
isolated post. She took a plane from Lima
to Cuzco and then spent an entire day in
a bus which took her to Paucartambo, a
village whose people live at a height of
3,500 metres (11,500 feet) in the heart of
the Andes. Setting off alone on horseback
across the vast Cordillera (right), she had
to cross a mountain pass 4,800 metres (al¬
most 16,000 feet) high. It was two days
before she covered the 115 kilometres (70
miles) and reached the school located in
the buildings of an abandoned farm. For
nine months each year this is her home,
until she returns to Lima for her annual
three months' vacation. Luciana's pupils
are Quero Indian children, aged eight to
13, whose parents breeders of llamas,
vicunas and alpacas live anything from 20
to 40 kilometres (12 to 25 miles) away.
Because of the distance they have to walk,
the children stay at the school from Mon¬
day morning to Friday evening. Water for
this austere "boarding school" comes from
melting glaciers, and in winter the school
is heated with fires of dead wood collected
on the mountains. Luciana shares to the
full the life of her pupils, and encourages
and watches over their games and recrea¬
tions (left). The children learn about hy¬
giene and are taught Spanish (their own
language is Quechua). They also learn to
read, write and count in Spanish. Luciana
has her own simple little room whose only
furnishings are a wooden bed and a llama
wool blanket. She earns 1,400 soles (£18
or $50) a month, and sometimes uses part
of her salary to pay for school supplies.

Meals also include porridge and
dried milk supplied by the
Peruvian Government. There
are rarely more than 10 to 12
children in school at one time,

FAIR DEAL FOR THE TEACHER (Continued)
Let's say good-bye to 'Mr. Chips'
and unselfishness, but who tends to
be absent-minded, ingenuous and
attached to old-fashioned principles.
It would have been surprising if this
view had not coloured the ideas of
teen-agers. They have, of course,
other and more direct ways of forming
an opinion about the teaching profes¬
sion, since it is the one they know, or
think they know, most about.
Some yougsters, inspired by admira¬
tion and enthusiasm for their teachers,
are strongly drawn to a teaching career
and their only ambition is to follow it
themselves. But it must be admitted
that such cases are relatively uncom¬
mon. Many others submit to their
teachers' authority with impatience
which shows itself in a display of
emotions ranging from indifference to
outright revolt. Later on they will
perhaps think with affection of their
former teachers, but more than likely
this will merely be nostalgia for their
own youth.
At an age when they are thinking of
choosing a career, young people are
often presented by the press, radio,
cinema and television with more
glamorous images of other jobs,
which seem to them to be in tune
with the world of today and tomorrow,
jobs which appear more active and
more "dangerous", but which offer
greater prestige and greater pos¬
sibilités of satisfying ambition.
There is room for a genuine non-
propaganda campaign, to publicize and
explain the role of the teacher. This
is not the place to set out the
particular points which should be
emphasized; they are, however, well
known to all who are familiar with
the world of education.
It would be wrong, for example, to
dwell on the sacrifices imposed by the
teacher's calling or on the haven
which the profession provides from the
agitation of the restless world points
that have so often been stressed, in all
good faith, in the past. Instead it
should be pointed out how much the
teacher contributes to the building of
the world of tomorrow, by preparing
young people for adult life and
citizenship; to the intellectual and
moral training of the makers of modern
society and to economic and social
progress. ' Teachers' associations,
which defend their members' legitimate
interests so conscientiously, might
perhaps pay more attention to raising
the standing of their profession in the
public mind, and especially in the
opinion of young people.
But it is, of course, up to the state
to set an example, and it has simple,
effective means at its disposal to do
so. The recommendation to be
submitted by Unesco to the inter¬
governmental conference deals with
the question of teachers' salaries in the
following terms:
"Amongst the various factors which
affect the status of teachers, particular
importance should be attached to sal¬
ary, seeing that in present world con¬
ditions other factors, such as the
standing or regard accorded them and
the level of appreciation of the im¬
portance of their function, are largely
CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE
World shortage of teachers
In 1950 the world had 5,347,000 primary schoolteachers. By 1962 their
numbers had risen to 8,052,000.
Despite this Increase there is still a serious shortage of teachers throughout
the world. In 1963 this shortage was hindering the development of primary
education in three-quarters of the 83 countries which replied to a question¬
naire from the International Bureau of Education. Fifty-one countries were
having to use staff without pedagogical training and 34 had been forced to
introduce accelerated training for teachers.
The number of teachers in secondary education (general, technical and
vocational) increased from 1,950,000 in 1950 to 4,300,000 in 1962. Never¬
theless, the International Bureau of Education reported in 1963: "the short¬
age of teachers, particularly teachers with proper training and qualifications,
gives rise to more anxiety than ever and is tending to become worse."
Teachers in higher education totalled 576,000 for 6,500,000 students in
1950; in 1962 there were 1,218,000 teachers for 14,000,000 students. The
1962 figures do not cover Mainland China, North Korea or North Viet-Nam.

FAIR DEAL FOR THE TEACHER (Continued)
The value nations place on education
10
dependent, as in other comparable
professions, on the economic position
in which they are placed."
Formulated in this way, the question
has two aspects. Salary is certainly
not the only factor to be considered
in a concerted policy of teacher re¬
cruitment. We have seen how, for
young people, the prestige of a career
is dependent on other factors. It is
not even sure that when young people
choose their profession they know
exactly what advantages it presents.
But it is also true that public opinion
does seem to have acknowledged once
and for all that teaching is badly paid.
Well-intentioned people have tried to
find solace in the idea that teaching is
not so much a career as a mission,
and that teachers must forego not only
wealth but many other material satis¬
factions as well. As compensation for
this, they point to the elation that
comes from fulfilling a noble task and
contributing to the development of
youthful personalities.
One need hardly point out that there
is a good deal of ignorance and hypoc¬
risy in this reasoning. Why should
young men and women at the very be¬
ginning of their working life renounce
the legitimate ambition of obtaining a
decent place in society for themselves
and their families? A profession with
the reputation of being badly paid holds
little attraction for young people, even
the most studious, and this again
dissuades many excellent potential
teachers from entering the profession.
Salary and other related advantages
are, however, also a sign of the regard
in which society, as represented by the
public authorities, holds a given pro¬
fession. It is illogical to declare that
teaching is one of the most necessary
of all public services, and at the same
time to keep teachers as impoverished
as they so very often are. Reliable
statistics collected during recent inter¬
national surveys prove that primary and
secondary teachers the former of
course more than the latter are in-
contestably among the most unfavour¬
ably treated categories of the working
population.
In many countries, it is often said
that anyone who goes into teaching
must have lost hope of entering any
other profession. How, then, can one
hope to raise the prestige of a career,
which is constantly so belittled? For¬
tunately conditions are not the same
everywhere; but examples of such in¬
consistency are too frequent to pass
unnoticed.
Teachers do not of course always
work for the state: they are often
employed by local communities or by
private enterprise. But since it is
agreed that teaching is a public ser¬
vice and that the education of young
people is one of the state's major res¬
ponsibilities, it is always the duty of
the state to supervise the quality and
operation of education.
The condition of the teacher is there¬
fore the concern of states; this means
that it is also the concern of Unesco,
whose task it is to bring about continu¬
ing co-operation between states in the
field of education. This is why Unesco
has taken the initiative, why it has
' arranged for an international recom¬
mendation to be drawn up and why it
has called an intergovernmental con¬
ference.
The question of salaries is not, of
course, the only problem with which
the recommendation deals; nor is it
the most important one. Methods of
recruitment, tenure, conditions of em¬
ployment, retirement pensions and all
aspects of social security are covered
as well. Teachers' rights must cor¬
respond to a fair assessment of their
duties and responsibilities.
A set of recommendations on the
selection and on the intellectual, pro¬
fessional and in-service training of
teachers must inevitably be associated
with this code of rights and duties; for
the status which the profession may
justifiably claim depends on the care
taken to choose and train its members
In accordance with the highest criteria.
The aim of the international recom¬
mendation is not to provide special
advantages for a particular group of
people, but to guarantee that a service
of public interest, of primary impor¬
tance for the future of every country
and of all mankind, should be carried
out in the best possible conditions.
Better training and
further education
The international recommendation on the status of teachers, which is to be
examined by the special intergovernmental conference, highlights some
major problems and suggests ways of dealing with them. Below are some
of its proposals relating to training and further education for teachers.
ADMISSION TO TRAINING. Candidates for teacher training should have
completed a well-rounded secondary education and should possess person¬
al qualities likely to help them to become worthy members of the profession.
AIMS OF TRAINING. A teacher's training should enable him to develop
his personal culture; his ability to teach; his awareness of the principles
which underlie good human relations, within and across national boundaries;
and a sense of responsibility to contribute to social, cultural and economic
progress.
TRAINING PROGRAMMES. General studies; study of the philosophy,
psychology, sociology, theory and history of education, comparative
education, school administration and methods of teaching various subjects.
Programmes should also include studies related to the student's intended
field of teaching, and practice in teaching and extra-curricular activities
carried out under the guidance of fully qualified teachers. All teachers
should be prepared in general, special and pedagogical subjects in univer¬
sities or in institutions of a comparable level.
FURTHER EDUCATION. A full place should be given to in-service
education designed to secure a systematic improvement of the quality
and content of education.
A wide system of in-service education, available free to all teachers, should
therefore be established. Refresher courses should be provided, espec¬
ially for teachers returning to their work after a break in service.
Courses should be designed to enable teachers to improve their qualifica¬
tions and to keep up to date with their subject and field of education.
Facilities should be available to enable teachers to buy or borrow books
and other material to improve their general education and professional
qualifications.

UNGATHERED HARVESTS
N THE OCEAN

I N the thick of a world¬
wide struggle against hung¬
er and malnutrition, man turns to the
sea for food and finds how poorly
he has named his planet Earth. The
connotation of Earth as a green world
of plenty is being dimmed. Millions
of her people are hungry and sick,
and sick and well alike are being
crowded rapidly toward the limit.
In 1930, there were 40 people per
square mile of total land area; now
there are 63; by the year 2,000 there
will be 142. We have begun to realize
as never before that only 30 per cent
of the so-called Earth is land area.
The rest is ocean, the only such ocean
in our entire solar system.
Meanwhile we must feed a popula¬
tion that grows at the rate of more
than 60 million a year. But only one-

tion and about two-thirds of that is
grassland of varying quality. These
are the main supports for our hungry
millions. And while the land supplies
grain, vegetables and fruits, it does
not yield directly the animal protein
that builds muscle and provides
stamina for continued work. The
conversion from vegetable to animal
protein comes through livestock and
this conversion costs us one-quarter
of all crops and one-half of all the
world's grain crops which go to feed
animals.
Once again we turn to the sea.

automatic, sun-powered, so far un-
managed, a warehouse of high-quality
food, withholding its wealth for the
right combination of keys. It is
estimated that, acre for acre, the sea
can produce as much as arable land,
yet the sea has twice the surface
area of Earth's total land and seven
times the area of land now under
cultivation. Can the sea be unlocked
to provide at least a partial solution
to our hunger? Yes, definitely. Will
the seas and inland waters someday
outrival Earth's agricultural production
and allow us greater breathing space
on the land ? Possibly, conceivably,
too soon to tell.
The present situation in world
fisheries has both optimistic and pes¬
simistic notes. On the bright side,
the world's fishermen now catch more
fish than ever before. Each year since
1945 has provided a record catch.
The 1964 catch 52 million metric tons
is double the 1953 catch. For com¬
parison with land-grown animal protein,
world fisheries production by 1962 was
exceeding beef and veal production by
18 million tons and pork production by
25 million tons.
The discouraging part of these fig¬
ures is that the fish is not being
taken by those who need it most.
First, between one-quarter and one-
third of the 1964 catch was taken by
only two countries Peru and Japan.
Second, only ten countries account¬
ed for the top 62 per cent of the total
catch. Finally, 95 per cent was taken
by the leading 43 fishing nations.

### Ungathered harvests in the ocean; man's vast potential food reserve
OCEAN HARVESTS (Continued)
Push-button' fishing with echo-sounder and television
12
There are about 220 independent or
dependent countries or territories, but,
even discounting those few which
have no marine or even inland
fisheries, these figures mean that per¬
haps 160 countries share only five
per cent of the world fish catch.
This imbalance also shows clearly
in a geographical distribution. Nearly
70 per cent of the 1964 marine catch
was taken from four big areas in the
northern hemisphere, the traditional
fishing grounds of the northeast and
northwest Atlantic and the west-cen¬
tral and north Pacific. These are the
areas fished most by the countries
which use the most modern fishing
gear and methods. Protein deficient
areas such as the Caribbean, parts
of Latin America, Asia and Africa pro¬
duced low tonnages and some pro¬
portion of even this catch was taken
by far-ranging trawlers from the more
developed fishing countries.
The reason for these discrepancies
is simply development; industrializa¬
tion. Since 1945 the technological
revolution that occurred with agricul¬
ture in the advanced countries long
ago, finally hit the fishing business.
Advanced nations soon had elec¬
tronic sounding devices to locate fish
schools. Shipyards produced better
boats; new engines began to shrink
sea distances. The textile industry
came out with new synthetic fibres
which made strong, rot-resisting nets.
New refrigeration techniques made it
possible to process fish at sea. Coun¬
tries with established rail and road
networks were able to distribute
fishery products far inland, through
extensive "cold chains" using refrig¬
erated trucks and railway cars.
Meanwhile, without the skills, capi¬
tal and industrial basis to seize these
innovations and turn them into oppor¬
tunity, the developing nations remain¬
ed far behind in fisheries develop¬
ment. This is why an Icelandic fisher¬
man accounts for an average annual
catch of more than 100 tons, while an
average fisherman in most tropical
areas will take only about one ton
of fish a year. Behind each Icelandic
fisherman there are many thousands
of dollars invested in boats, gear and
training. In the developing countries
we are trying to remedy this techno¬
logical gap, with varying degrees of
success, by sending technical assis¬
tance experts in specific kinds of fish¬
ing and by setting up entire fisheries
institutes.
Meanwhile, the technological revo¬
lution advances, always outstripping
the nations least prepared for it and
in most need of its benefits. Great
fleets of trawlers from Japan, U.S.S.R.
and a few other countries now roam
almost every sea, catching, freezing
and transferring fish to shore bases
or transport ships.
Some boats are able to operate
almost in "push-button" style, finding
a shoal of fish by Sonar, letting down
a trawl and directing this net with
the aid of television cameras mount¬
ed on the trawl mouth. The latest
news in fishing boat design is that
months of drawing and model-testing
can now be avoided by programming
an electronic computer to give "ideal"
specifications for a boat of a certain
type or size or for use in certain
sea conditions. Again, in the develop¬
ing countries, where the majority of
the world's boatyards are, most boats
are built from memory and rule of
thumb, without even rough drawings.
If the waters of the world are now
producing more than 50 million tons
of food a year, how much more can
they produce? The answer "we
don't know" illustrates man's great
Ignorance of the sea. The sea's pro¬
duction may be very large, but it is
not unlimited. It is limited by photo¬
synthesis, the process by which tiny
sea plants called plankton are able to
grow by absorbing sunlight. Some
attempts at measuring this growth
rate have been made. By estimat¬
ing the amount of plankton and its
growth rate, the sea's "primary pro¬
duction" can be guessed at.
In 1961, two scientists estimated
this primary production at 500 thous¬
and million metric tons per year for
all seas. In the sea's food chain we
might assume that small, plant-eating
animals feed off the plankton, are in
turn eaten by a class of small fish,
which are in turn devoured by larger
fish. At each stage there is a certain

### Ungathered harvests in the ocean; man's vast potential food reserve
Drawing "Science and Technology"
Two-thirds of the surface of our planet is covered
by seas and oceans, which combine to form
a single vast world ocean. As this "petal"
map-projection shows, all salt-water bodies, whatever
their names, ultimately mingle around Antarctica.
Below, hauling hard on their huge oars, fishermen
set out for tuna fishing grounds off the Sicilian coast.
loss in material. Counting these
losses, the estimated possible result
from the original 500 thousand million
tons of plant food would be one
thousand million tons of fish.
But any estimate of primary produc¬
tion is bound to be weak. This is
because the life processes of the
phytoplankton at one place vary from
hour to hour and season to season.
It also grows at different rates in
different areas. It Is possible to cal¬
culate from some estimates that the
world's catch of codfish requires
seaplant production equivalent to 22
world wheat crops, which would mean,
on the same basis, that the present
world catch of fish brings man the
equivalent of almost 100 times more
primary plant protein than is involved
in the entire agriculture of the earth.
Until better information is available,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organ¬
ization continues on its estimate that
the world fish catch could be doubl¬
ed without endangering basic fish
stocks.
Many ideas none so far very
practical have been advanced on
how to increase our harvest of food
from the world's waters. Since the
best fishing grounds occur where
upwelling currents bring bottom food
up into the zone of light penetration
where most commercial species live,
it has been suggested that artificial
upwellings should be created in the
tropics, where few exist, by lowering
nuclear reactors. The economics of
this up to now have shown that there
would be a tremendous energy waste.
Economics and physical laws also
have hindered the use of electricity
for marine fishing. Fish are attract¬
ed and stunned by a current, and
electrical fishing has been known on
a small scale in streams and shallow
lakes for more than 50 years. But
salt water dissipates a continuous
electrical force, even with equipment
generating 7,000 kilowatts enough
power to supply a small town. German
engineers have reported success with
a fraction of this power by sending
a series of strong electrical pulses
into the water. The German and Sov¬
iet fishing fleets have reportedly
been experimenting with this tech¬
nique.
The Russians have also apparently
begun experimental attempts to catch
fish with submarines and American
scientists have predicted that fish
could be lured with electronic sounds
or chemicals and simply sucked into
special holds in a ship's hull.
Whatever the limits of sea produc¬
tion, there seem to be no limits to
the inventiveness of the new technol¬
ogy of modern fishing. The obvious

OCEAN HARVESTS (Continued)
Fish by any
other name...
qualification to the new ideas is that
most of them depend on a sound
knowledge of fish behaviour, which
we simply do not have.
One of the more immediate hopes
we have is the mid-water trawl. The
usual commercial trawl net is dragged
along the bottom. But our charts of
the shallow continental shelves, poor
as they are, show there is not much
bottom left which has not been trawl¬
ed many times. Therefore, there
would seem to be good prospects for
a trawl which rides a considerable
distance off the bottom. This type of
gear is available but has seen no
large-scale commercial use yet.
By far the most practical idea for
increasing supplies of fish protein is
simply to use the great quantity of
fish now caught, but not used. Many
species, because they look ugly or
have harsh-sounding -names, will not
be accepted by consumers, despite
their being excellent high-quality food.
The "redfish" was one, until it was
processed into fillets and rechristen-
ed "ocean perch", which now sells
well. The same idea of dressing up
the product as fish sticks or paste
or other more attractive forms leads
to more sales and more incentive to
catch fish and avoid wasting its
protein.
The other great force toward a
sensible use of protein resources is
inland fisheries. Nearly 12 per cent
of the 1964 world catch came from
fresh water. Just as important, nearly
three-quarters of the Inland catch came
from protein-deficient Asia; Africa
produced almost as much as U.S.S.R.;
South America produced as much as
Europe and more than North America.
Again, in fresh water fisheries, we see
an expanding technology, but this is
backed up by centuries of experience
in the Far East and, unlike the sea,
there is a better possibility of control¬
ling production conditions in inland
waters.
In inland fisheries, it is quite within
possibility that the waters can be
"farmed" in much the same way as
the land. Despite a good deal of
futuristic talk, this is not so far prac¬
tical In the sea. Yet, as with every
idea in fisheries, our general Ignorance
has provided us with a wide range
of opinion.
The optimists point to 17,000 dif¬
ferent species of algae, plankton and
seaweed, some of which can produce
50 crops a year, with almost 100 per
cent of the plant usable as food. Kelp
and other large seaweeds have been
Siegfried Sammer, Berlin
Fishermen of Kerala, India, still use the type of fishing net
shown above, introduced 18 centuries ago by Chinese merchants.
Outdated techniques limit the catches of many countries. Ten
countries alone those which use modern fishing gear and methods

used for centuries, especially in the
Far East, for fertilizer, fodder and
human consumption. Algae or algae
extracts are now used In Japan, for
example, in bread, cakes, ice cream,
soups, soap, explosives, cosmetics
and toothpaste.
But when algae are offered as a
large-scale solution to the hunger
problem, the pessimists are quick to
point out practical difficulties. To
provide one man with enough calories
for a day's work through algae, they
say, would mean straining several
thousand cubic metres of sea water.
They say algal cells are so well pro¬
tected by nature that man would not
digest them easily. Again, until we
know a lot more about the sea's
grasses, that part of the ocean's ware¬
house which is the granary remains
locked.
Another intriguing possibility for
increasing world food supplies lies
not in plankton, but in krill, a shrimp-
like creature as long as a matchstick,
which feeds on the plankton of the
unexploited southern ocean. Unlike
plankton and the problem of strain¬
ing sea water to get at it, krill occurs
in enormous densely-packed shoals.
It is the main diet of the great south¬
ern whales, and, since whale stocks
have been decimated by unscrupulous
killing, the vast areas of krill have
Increased. In late 1962, solid data
on krill distribution began to be
published. The famous British scien¬
tist, Sir Alister Hardy, has said he
is sure that krill will save the starv¬
ing children of the world and that
within 20 years krill may be making
the greatest addition of the century to
man's food supplies.
Husbanding of marine fish has
already been tried. Young plaice have
been raised in tanks from hatching,
through the most dangerous part of
their lives, until they are ready for
release into the sea. A plant on the
Isle of Man is expected to turn out
a million fish a year.
## [Page 15](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/012656engo.pdf#page=15) 🆗
### Ungathered harvests in the ocean; man's vast potential food reserve
A technique tried 50 years ago to
increase fish size was to catch young
fish on overcrowded grounds and
transfer them to richer grounds. Those
transferred grew several times as
large as those left behind. A scheme
to make such transfers regularly, fail¬
ed. No one nation was going to pay
to release fish where other nations
could easily catch them. International
co-operation has improved since then.
One of the most unusual situations
in world fisheries is the case of Latin
America. Since 1957, Latin American
fisheries production has increased
nearly 1,000 per cent, while world
production has increased only about
65 per cent. However, in at least half
a dozen Latin American countries, fish
production increased little or not at
all, and in seven, including Mexico
and Cuba, production increases have
been about 50 per cent since 1957.
The key is anchoveta, a finger-length
fish found in great easily-caught
schools off western South America.
On the strength of this little fish, Peru
became the world's greatest fish pro¬
ducer in 1962, and Peru and Chile are
responsible for 90 per cent of Latin
American production and 20 per cent
of the world catch.
Could the anchoveta contribute to
the solution of Latin America's protein
deficit? The theoretical case is very
strong. In 1962, for example, nutri¬
tionists estimated that Latin America
needed 1.2 million metric tons of ani¬
mal protein annually. That year's Peru¬
vian and Chilean fish catch totalled
7.5 million tons, which contained about
1.3 million tons of protein. However,
considering that only half of this
7.5 million tons live weight would be
suitable for direct human consumption,
at least 40 per cent of the 1962 Latin
American protein' requirement could
theoretically have been met by the
catches of these two countries. On
the same basis, it seems quite within
the fisheries development possibilities
of the continent to be able to provide,
in theory, for all increases in protein
demands by Latin America's expanding
population over the next 20 years.
These figures are theoretical since,
in fact, 95 per cent of the 1962 ancho¬
veta catch, for example, was ground
into fishmeal, most of it for export to
United States and Europe as pig and
chicken feed. In effect, Peru and
Chile that year exported one million
metric tons of animal protein to put
pork and chicken on the tables of
nations already well fed.
This example is not intended as any
adverse comment on these countries,
but is used merely to point out what
the effect of fisheries economics can
be on human nutrition. The economic
fact is that Peru and Chile, desperately
short of foreign capital, gained
110 million dollars from the anchoveta
in 1962 and this money was invested
for development, including fisheries
development. The example is also
used to illustrate the importance of
fishmeal.
Late last year, the New York Times
announced a "breakthrough" in the
solution to the world food crisis fish¬
meal for human consumption. It was
said that studies indicated that if
unharvested fish in American coastal
waters were made into concentrate,
this would provide the normal protein
requirements for nearly one-third of
the world's population for 300 days at
a base production cost of half a cent
per person per day.
In the manufacture, whole, fresh fish
are pulped, then moved through a bath
of cold ¡sopropyl alcohol to eliminate
most of the water and fat. They go
Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
through two more stages under hot
¡sopropyl alcohol, stirring in kettles,
and after drying, an off-white flour¬
like substance remains. This is fish
protein concentrate. There are three
types for human consumption, varying
from 60 to 80 per cent protein. It can
be mixed into bread, macaroni and
other foods. Any "fishy" taste can
be removed during manufacture.
It has been possible to make such
a clean, safe, high-quality and cheap
product for several years. So far it
has been mostly manufactured for
experiments, though recently several
companies in Morocco, South Africa
and the United States have begun
selling it for institutional feeding at
retail prices ranging from $170 to $350
a ton. Experiments at the Anglo-
American Clinic in Lima, Peru, provide
encouraging results of its effective¬
ness in combating children's diseases
caused by protein deficiency, such as
kwashiorkor.
It may be one of our best answers
against malnutrition. But before we
can throw it in full force into the fight,
we need more economic and social
data, particularly on Its acceptability
to consumers. We need nutritional
data on how to use this concentrate
in the daily dishes of various countries
to improve diets. Some of these ques¬
tions are under study at the FAO-
founded Instituto del Mar in Peru.
Very recently two of our FAO De¬
partment of Fisheries staff members
made an interesting calculation on the
contribution fishmeal could make to
human diets and the amount of fish
required. They said that to increase
the daily diet of one million people by
five grammes of protein in the form of
fish protein concentrate containing 65
per cent protein, an annual tonnage of
about 16,000 metric tons of whole fish
would be required.
Though this increase of five gram¬
mes of animal protein is small, It is
still significant in some countries. For
example, the average daily animal pro¬
tein intake per person for Africa as a
whole is only 11 grammes, of which
only 1.3 grammes now comes from fish.
A per person increase of five gram¬
mes of animal protein for all Africa
would be a jump forward toward the
short-term target of 18 grammes for the
continent. The objective of this short-
term target is elimination of under¬
nutrition and a reasonable improvement
in nutritional quality of the diet.
The proportion of the total world
catch reduced to meal and oils for
animal feeds rose from 13 per cent in
1958 to 30 per cent in 1964, or 35 per * p
cent if the world Inland catch is Id
excluded. It seems obvious that if we
could upgrade some part of this animal

access and exposed at all times to
invasion (it has experienced no less
than ten periods of outside domi¬
nation). Yet paradoxically it has lived
through a score of centuries almost
always unaffected by the great changes
of history, as though it were a remote
corner of our planet.
Nevertheless, during the second mil¬
lennium B.C. well before the series
of foreign occupations began with the
arrival of the Phoenicians an ancient
and mysterious people, whose place
of origin no one has been able to
establish, created a distinctive form of
civilization which lasted for at least a
thousand years (from 1500 to about
500 B.C.). The sources of this civiliza¬
tion are bound up with the legend of
King Sardus, the eponymous hero who,
according to the Greek historian Pau-
sanias, ruled over the first inhabitants
of the island.
Curious traces of this civilization,
developed In part through the influence
of the richer and more mature cultures
of the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia
Minor, are preserved for us in the im¬

known as nuraghi, which have given
their name to the whole of this histor¬
ical period and are to be found by

ACOLYTE BEARING OFFERING.
The ancients of Sardinia
offered up animals,
food and drink to their gods.
The story told by the nuraghi and
the bronzetti is perhaps the most fas¬
cinating chapter in the history of Sar¬
dinia.
A nuraghe was a fortified house, the
dwelling of the chief of the tribe or
clan; it was a real fortress, rearing its
massive bulk in the midst of a com¬
plex of smaller stone buildings, all,
like the nuraghe itself, circular in
shape. The whole formed an actual
hamlet, an urban settlement (a "nuraghi
village" in fact), which, one can rea¬
sonably assume, marks the transition
of the ancient Sardinian society from
a nomadic existence of plunder and
violence, and a pastoral economy, to
a new and more advanced form of
community life, based on a mixed econ¬
omy. The nuraghi period indicates
the first Instance of an autonomous
Sardinian culture with a distinctive
structure and purposes of its own.
While, in view of the complete
absence of graphic evidence and of
decorative elements on the outer and
Inner surfaces of their cyclopean walls,
the nuraghi tell us very little about the
ancient island people, studies of the
bronzetti have on the contrary enabled
archaeologists and historians to shed
some revealing light on this interesting
period of Sardinia's history.
There are about 400 of these small
bronze sculptures, most of which are
kept at the National Museum in Caglia-
ri, the capital of the island. They vary
in height from 8 to 30 cm. (3 to 12 in.);
some are broken, but despite the long
erosion of time, they are in an excel¬
lent state of preservation.
These statuettes were found chiefly
In the sanctuaries the most famous
of all being that of Santa Vittoria di
Serri which the ancient Sardinians
built on lonely heights near to springs;
only rarely were they discovered in
tombs, and practically never in the
nuraghi. The fact that they come
mostly from the sanctuaries in itself
shows that they were ex-votos, offer¬
ings from the faithful to the deity in
propitiation when asking aid, or in grat¬
itude for help received; confirmation
of their votive purpose is occasionally
provided by insertion fitments in their
bases.
Tribal chiefs, priests and priestesses,
warriors, wrestlers, musicians, acolytes
bearing offerings of cakes or animals
to the deity, small funeral ships,
dagger and sword hilts have been
found. The theocratic and military char¬
acter of this society, with religion and
politics merging, is quite apparent.
It is a society in which the tribal
chief, equipped with the ritual sacri¬
ficial knife and with the staff of office,
unites in himself both civil and reli¬
gious authority, and where the warrior,
often distinguished by superhuman
traits (four eyes, symbolizing shrewd¬
ness and foresight), holds out his
shield as a sign of its dedication to
the invisible god.
The study of these ex-vofos has
given us some idea, although by no
means a full one, of the beliefs and
religious practices of the proto-Sardin-
ians. Without graphic evidence, relig¬
ious literature or historical Informa¬
tion, we must resort to the comparative
method, looking to the religions of Asia
Minor and the Central and Eastern
Mediterranean to throw light on the
religious significance of most of the
bronzes. Along with the statuettes
depicting priests and priestesses, with
their right hands raised in adoration,
acolytes and offering-bearers, we find
representations, often in limestone or
basalt, of the Great Goddess, some¬
times supporting on her lap a young
dead god.
Associated with this basic cult of
the Great Goddess, the Earth Mother,
the mighty Life-Giver, the principle of
abundance and fertility, represented
primarily by vegetation and spring
water (who was probably worshipped
all over the island), were elements
common to all the Mediterranean reli-

gions, such as the survival of the indi¬
vidual soul and the belief that death
does not permanently sever the rela¬
tions of the dead with the living.
Domestic objects found beside skele¬
tons, lamps to lighten the darkness of
the grave, bowls for use in the pre¬
paration of the dead man's food, and
little ships symbolizing his long journey
through the kingdom beyond the tomb
all these are proof of such a belief.
Certain practices also testify to the
fact that these peoples believed in the
continuance of relations between the
living and the dead; an example of
this is "incubation": a prolonged sleep,
even lasting several days, near the
tombs hollowed out from the rock (the
domus de ¡anas, or "spirit houses", as
the country people still call them), the
aim being to obtain either the cure of
illness, or revelatory dreams.
Clothing, religious feasts, propitia¬
tory rites, and offensive and defensive
weapons all help us to build up a
picture of the theocratic and military
structure of the nuraghi society, as it
may be deduced from a careful ana¬
lysis of these little sculptures.
Historians and art critics began to
be interested in the bronzetti at the end
of the eighteenth century, when the
German archaeologist, J.J. Winckel-
mann, a theorist of neo-classical taste,
summarily dismissed them, for appear¬
ance and workmanship, as "quite bar¬
baric" (ganz barbarisch). No less nega¬
tive was the opinion expressed by La
Marmora, the first great hnodern his¬
torian of Sardinia, in the first half of
the nineteenth century. Today, criti¬
cism has revised its view of these
ancient examples of the Sardinians'
skill in the plastic arts, considering
them quite rightly as some of the live¬
liest expressions of late neolithic art
among the peoples of the Mediterran¬
ean. The absence of monstrosities
emphasizes the poise and restraint
of their figurative imagination.
Unlike the rudimentary pottery of
the nuraghi civilization, which repeats
the motifs of geometrical design
(ribbons, dog-tooth patterns and con¬
centric circles), characteristic of the
late neolithic pottery of the Eastern
and Western Mediterranean, the bron-
zetti bear witness to an original stream
of artistic development, clearly distin¬
guished from similar art forms in the
Mediterranean regions.
As for their dating, a few decades
ago it was thought, that the bronzetti
went back to the second millennium.
Archaeologists now date them from the
first millennium, linking them with the
archaic geometric sculpture typical of
the Graeco-Latin figurative' arts of the
same period. According to the Italian
archaeologist Massimo Pallottino, the
bronzetti belong to the pre-archaic
minor sculpture of the proto-historical
Mediterranean. "Thus", he writes,
"certain similarities of structure, tech¬
nique and ~even of significant details
can be perceived between the Sardin¬
ian bronze figurines and those of
Luristan, Armenia, Syria, Asia Minor,
Greece, Italy and Iberia."
It is not possible, however, to say
for certain which of these art regions
exerted the greatest influence on the
development of paleo-Sardinian plas¬
tic forms. The geometrical style could
have been imported from Syria by the
Phoenicians. On the other hand, the
discovery, in the so-called "tomb of
the leader" at Vetulonia, of a beautiful
little bronze ship, clearly of Sardinian
inspiration, may support the hypothe¬
sis that there were contacts in art with
Etruria.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied
that the nuraghi culture possessed
strong artistic feeling. The merits and
significance of the creations of prim¬
itive man cannot be judged by the
standards of the academic formalism
prevalent among archaeologists in the
past. Though concerned with convey¬
ing religious reality in symbolic form,
the ancient Sardinian artist was un¬
doubtedly able, with marvellous in¬
stinctive feeling, to create authentic
works of art.

THE YEARS
OF THE QUIET SUN
Dressed warmly against the cold, a mountain-top
observer of the Soviet Far Eastern Solar
Service studies the rising sun.
Scientists in all parts of the
world are today studying the re¬
sults of a vast international
research programme into solar
activity and its influence on the
earth. Here two Soviet geophysi-
cists describe how in 1964-65 the
world became one vast labora¬
tory in which scientists from over
70 countries joined forces in a
co-ordinated effort to learn more
about solar-terrestrial relations.

O the uninitiated, the
phrase "years of the quiet
sun" may have an odd sound, remind¬
ful of some ancient calendar of the
East, perhaps of a poetic figure of
speech. Yet it happens to be a strictly
scientific term which is applied to
a great scientific project, recently
completed and widely reported.
Men have looked up to the sun as
the source of life since the earliest
times, and the worship of the sun last¬
ed in many lands until men learned
to look for rational explanations of
NICOLAI PUSHKOV, a prominent Soviet
geophysicist (and winner of the Lenin Prize)
is director of the Institute of Terrestrial
Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave
Propagation of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences. He is also a vice-president of
the Committee for the International Years
of the Quiet Sun (IQSY).
BORIS SILKIN, an eminent researcher, is
a member of the Soviet Geophysical
Committee (Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Acad¬
emy of Sciences). He took part in the
International Geophysical Year and the
IQSY, and has written books and studies
on these international research projects.
natural phenomena. The sun-god Ra
of the ancient Egyptians; Helios, iden¬
tified with Apollo, worshipped in an¬
cient Greece and Rome; the merry
Yarilo of the ancient Slavs (the god
of the life-giving forces of nature)
these were all held to be incarnations,
or embodiments, of the sun.
Centuries were to pass before men
learned to base their knowledge on
facts rather than faith, and it was only
during the Renaissance in Europe
that they began to test and experi¬
ment in various fields of science. In
1609 Galileo Galilei may be said to
have rediscovered the heavens when
he first trained his telescope on the
moon.
Three and a half centuries have
rolled by since then, and we may ask
ourselves the question: What have
we learned about the sun since those
times? i
We have learned, for one thing,
that the sun does not always remain
changeless but is subject to periods
of greater or lesser activity. Sunspots,
noticed in antiquity and observed by
Galileo, appear upon its face with
definite regularity, their number
increasing over a period of three or
four years, after which they decay,
solar activity sinks to a minimum, and
the sun remains relatively undisturb¬
ed. This quiet period continues two
or three years after which solar ac¬
tivity again begins to increase. The
entire cycle from one maximum to
another is completed in a little over
1 1 years.
Other phenomena besides the sun-
spots are subject to these cycles: the
faculae, or bright regions of the sun's
photosphere; chromospheric flares;
and prominences, or tongues of flame,
leaping hundreds of thousands of kilo¬
metres high over the solar surface.
These various phenomena are im¬
portant and hence of great interest
to the scientists. Moreover, they are
of no mere academic interest, for the
construction of some new hypothesis,
for example. Nor is it only that the sun
is our nearest star and the only one
that admits of direct observation,
being merely 150 million kilometres
away, whereas the nearest other stars

### The Years of the quiet sun
QUIET SUN (Continued)
Concerted effort by thousands of scientists
are hundreds of thousands of times
more distant.
It is the continuous and varied
influence of the sun on the earth that
explains our interest, rather than the
fact that observation of the sun advan¬
ces stellar astronomy.
Everyone is familiar with the inter¬
ferences that frequently occur in radio
transmissions. The local broadcast¬
ing station that regularly comes over
so clearly all at once begins to fade
out and another station, possibly un¬
identified and far away, comes in. This
is all very well if one has been tun¬
ed in to a programme of music, but
quite another thing in the case of a
radio beacon, for in that event ships
and aircraft may face distress as a
result of confusion in the ether. Or,
to take another example, the needle
of the compass on which you are
accustomed to rely may unexpectedly
begin to swing away from a given
point, and here again the results may
be serious.
In both cases solar phenomena are
at the root of the trouble.
Solar activity, therefore, and solar-
terrestrial effects require painstaking
observation. We need to know more
about the various solar phenomena
and to learn how to deal with or,
rather, adapt ourselves to the effect
of the turbulent activity of the sun
that has so direct a bearing on our
existence.
The recent international geophysical
year (IGY) was a good example of
such observation. Within the frame¬
work of its 1957-59 programme a great
deal of valuable information was
obtained concerning the various ter¬
restrial physical processes and the
nature of solar-terrestrial relations.
As a result, we have improved our
conceptions with regard to our plan¬
et's environment.
Valuable as this mass of informa¬
tion may be, its accuracy must be
proved by comparison. The IGY
happened to coincide with a period
of extremely high solar activity. In
order to arrive at definitive conclu¬
sions, however, we must observe the
sun in the less disturbed phase of
its cycle as well.
While science has so far been un¬
able to discover precisely what is
responsible for changes in solar activ¬
ity, scientists have learned to fore¬
cast such changes quite accurately
on the basis of the 11 -year cycles.
Inasmuch as 1957-59 had been a
period of maximum solar activity, they
were able to predict a period of
lessened disturbance in 1964-65.
This prediction . gave rise to the
idea of organizing an International
Years of the Quiet Sun project, or
IQSY. When the idea was broached in
1960 by some Soviet scientists, it gain¬
ed the immediate support of geophysi-
cists from many lands, convened for
the Geophysical Conference at Hel¬
sinki. It had become quite clear that
the physical phenomena caused by so¬
lar activity are on such a scale that
they must be studied on an internation¬
al level, for no amount of restricted,
national observation could cope with
the problem.
These physical phenomena affect
the earth as a whole, and if any reli¬
able conclusions were to be reached,
it was obvious that scientists would
have to work within the framework of
an internationally integrated program¬
me and familiarize themselves with
data collected all over the world.
If a chemist or an historian needs
to know what his colleagues in other
countries are working on, even if simp-

ly to avoid duplication of research and
to profit from discussion so as to get
the right answers, it is doubly impor¬
tant for the geophysicist to do so,
for the object of his study is the
earth as a whole. Uniformity of exper¬
iment, co-ordination of observation
and comparison of data collected are
of fundamental importance to the geo¬
physicist; without them it is impossible
to unravel phenomena of a universal
nature.
In line with the IQSY programme,
our planet became one vast labora¬
tory for the scientists to work in.
Thousands of geophysicists from more
than 70 countries joined forces in a
co-ordinated effort to solve the riddles
of nature. The project received full
support from Unesco and WMO, as
well as various international bodies
of astronomers, physicists, radiophy-
sicists, geodesists and geophysicists;
the committee for space research
(COSPAR) of the International Council
of Scientific Unions and the Special
Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR). W.J.G. Beynon of Great
Britain, who was put in charge of the
entire project, was requested by the
International Committee on Geophysics
to work out the general programme
of research.
Academies of sciences and other
similar institutions in dozens of coun¬
tries also responded to an invitation
to participate in the IQSY, thereby
assuring the representation of the five
continents, all the climatic zones, many
different scientific trends, and coun¬
tries with very different levels of devel¬
opment, including those with a history
of many centuries and those who have
just embarked on programmes of econ¬
omic and scientific development.
Japan and Australia are first to greet
the rising sun, and the astronomers
of the Tokyo Observatory train their
telescopes upon it. As the earth
turns upon its axis the sun comes
under the observation of the Soviet
Far Eastern Solar Service situated on
the banks of the Ussuri. An hour or
two later this observation is taken up
by astronomers in Irkutsk, Alma-Ata,
Tashkent and Delhi. As the sun rises
over the Caspian it comes within view
for Azerbaijan scientists at Perkuli,
near Baku, and their Georgian collea¬
gues in the hills of Abastumani. They
are soon joined by Kislovodsk, then
the Crimea, the town of Krasnaya
Pakhra near Moscow, Kiev and Lvov.
The sun is then passed on, as it
were, to the astronomers of Potsdam,
in the German Democratic Republic,
Plzen in Czechoslovakia, Ljubljana In
Yugoslavia, Wroclaw in Poland, Pic
du Midi de Bigorre in France, and
Greenwich in England. On the other
side of the Atlantic telescopes are
ready for it at the Smithsonian Obser¬
vatory at Washington, Arecibo in
Puerto Rico, Boulder in Colorado and
Sacramento Peak in New Mexico,
U.S.A., Tonanzintla in Mexico, and
Ottawa in Canada. South of the
equator, meantime, the watch is carried
on, successively, in South Africa,
Argentina and Peru, until finally the
sun plunges into the Pacific, to rise
again over the eastern fringe of Asia.
We have already remarked that the
IQSY was not an astronomical project,
for we were interested in the effect
of solar-terrestrial inter-relationships
here, at this end; we wanted to know
what kind of impact solar phenomena
have on the earth. Astronomical
observation of the sun, important as
it was, served the participants in the
project merely as a point of depar¬
ture in their work.
The polar regions of our planet are
more than any other of interest
to the geophysicist, for it is here that
the poles of the spherical magnet on
which we live are found. It is here
that the magnetic storms and polar

aurorae produced by the intrusion of
charged particles out of the cosmos
give displays of particular force. Here,
also, we can observe the very peculiar
behaviour of the upper charged layer
of the earth's atmospheric envelope,
the ionosphere, which reflects incom¬
ing radio waves. And here, finally,
above the endless icy wastes great
currents of air often form that affect
the weather and climate in even very
distant areas.
All these phenomena are directly or
indirectly connected with the whim¬
sical moods of the sun and the nature
of the electromagnetic and corpus¬
cular radiation emanating from it. To
gain a complete concept of the inter¬
relationships of the earth and its
nearest star, therefore, it is necessary
to start with observations carried on
in the polar regions, where the various
features of that concept are particu¬
larly characteristic.
That is precisely the reason why
the attention of the scientists was
focused on the work of the northern¬
most outposts of IQSY at the stations
North Pole 12, North Pole 13 and
North Pole 14, whose teams carried
on through the snowstorms of the
endless polar night, studying magnet¬
ic storms and polar aurorae in the
high latitudes of the Arctic and observ¬
ing the propagation of radio waves
and the behaviour of cosmic rays
when the sun is undisturbed.
The Antarctic ice-cap at the other
pole was made the subject of similar
study. At Vostok Station, near to the
earth's magnetic pole and cold pole,
Soviet scientists enrolled in the pro¬
ject carried on through the winter
despite temperatures of 80 degrees
Centigrade below zero.
The world's coldest continent be¬
came the land with the highest per¬
centage of scientists, a scientists'
continent, where co-operation among
the specialists from the participating
countries reached a record high. At
Vostok station and the Mirny Obser¬
vatory, Soviet scientists worked to¬
gether with their American, French,
German Democratic Republic, Czecho¬
slovak and Hungarian colleagues, while
Soviet geophysicists wintered and
worked at the American McMurdo
station. This fruitful collaboration
made it possible to achieve higher
levels of perfection in the various
schools of science and increase our
common fund of knowledge.
Each participating country carried
out its own national project, set up
within the framework of the overall
programme. Considerably more than
one hundred "Cosmos" type satellites
were launched under the Soviet pro¬
gramme to carry out a wide variety
of observations in circumplanetary
space, precisely where solar phenom¬
ena have their first impact on our
planet.
Four "Electron" type satellites were
launched in the U.S.S.R. specially for
IQSY purposes, whose orbits, draw¬
ing alternately away from and closer
to the earth, covered an extensive
part of its immediate environment and
were thus able to establish with
greater precision the pattern of its
magnetic field, to study the streams
of particles ejected from the sun and
its X-ray radiation, to capture micro-
meteorites, to study the electrons
present in the earth's radiation zones
discovered by American and Soviet
scientists under the IGY programme
and to determine the chemical compo¬
sition of cosmic rays.
American scientists launched sev¬
eral "Explorer" type satellites under
the IQSY programme which they used
to measure the magnetic field of
charged particles; to classify elec¬
trons by the direction of their move¬
ment and the size of their charge;
to study cosmic rays and the recently
discovered "solar wind", or particle
stream, that fans the earth; and to
measure the density of the terrestrial
atmosphere on its outer fringes, i.e.
where it merges into cosmic space.
The American "Oso" and "Ogo" type
satellites collected information on the
genesis of solar flares and the nature
of the particles launched into the
cosmos from the solar surface at their
genesis.
British "Ariel" type satellites were

### The Years of the quiet sun
CATACLYSMIC
ERUPTIONS
Above the surface of the sun is a
layer of lighter and cooler gas call¬
ed the chromosphere, so named
because it gives out scarlet light.
Great streams of glowing hydrogen
called prominences often shoot
through the chromosphere, some¬
times for hundreds of thousands of
miles. Left, the largest of these
cataclysmic solar outbursts ever
observed (on June 4, 1946). It
expanded like a giant fiery bubble,
reaching its maximum height in the
fifth photograph. Forty-nine minutes
later (last photo) it had almost
disappeared. (Numbers indicate time
when each photograph was taken.)
Violent, but short-lived, solar flares
also appear on the sun's surface.
These send out electrically charged
particles which on reaching the earth
affect the compass needle and inter¬
fere with radio transmissions, caus¬
ing fade-outs. When they collide
with atoms and molecules in the
earth's atmosphere, these particles
also produce the auroral displays

used to measure micrometeorites
and to carry out experiments to deter¬
mine the behaviour of ozone, the
"brittle"gas whose genesis in the
atmosphere depends on the ultraviolet
rays of the sun. "Alouette", the Ca¬
nadian satellite sent up into the iono¬
sphere, was used to establish the
relationship of the ionosphere with
the genesis of polar aurorae.
Needless to say, the IQSY pro¬
gramme covered much more than the
cosmos: a worldwide network was set
up, comprising 240 scientific stations
and laboratories for measuring the
earth's magnetic field, 180 stations
for observing polar aurorae, 270
stations for probing the ionosphere,
close to 1,000 meteorological stations
for studying the atmosphere, climates
and weather, 105 stations for captur¬
ing cosmic rays, 110 observatories for
recording the solar manifestations
responsible for all this diversity of
phenomena.
In addition to the cosmic experiments
already mentioned, land-based Soviet
geophysicists, for instance, effected
their observations with the aid of a
vast network of stations stretching
from the country's western boundaries
to the Soviet Far East and from the
Kola Peninsula beyond the Arctic
Circle and Yakutia to Transcaucasia
and Central Asia.
Thousands of Soviet geophysicists
attached to the Academy of Sciences
of the U.S.S.R. and the academies of
many of the Union republics joined
this fact-finding scientific campaign.
The country's foremost universities
co-operated in the effort to penetrate
the mysteries of solar-terrestrial
effects teachers, researchers and
enthusiastic students, the future geo¬
physicists, all joined in this work. No
small contribution to the IQSY was
made by the scientific bodies of the
Soviet Meteorological Service.
The Institute of Terrestrial Magne¬
tism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave
Propagation (of the U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences) brought into prominence
as an IQSY centre the small town
of Krasnaya Pakhra near which it is
situated in the Moscow countryside.
One of the Institute's departments
was continually on the move the
schooner "Zarya", the world's only
non-magnetic vessel. The "Zarya"
carried the IQSY flag over tens of
thousands of miles, as it sailed the
Baltic, North, Greenland and Norwe¬
gian Seas and the wide reaches of
the Atlantic Ocean down to the equa¬
tor, sounding and measuring to pro¬
cure the data to be used for making
precision marine charts of magnetic
declinations.
A very extensive network of scien¬
tific stations and observatories was
deployed by the geophysicists of the
U.S.A. to carry out the diverse obser
vations provided for by the IQSY
programme. This network covered
the country from Point Barrow in
Alaska down to Cape Kennedy in
Florida.
Work upon the project was also
carried on by American scientists in
Antarctica: at the McMurdo Observa¬
tory, at eight stations built specially
for electromagnetic observation, and
at the Amundsen-Scott Station, situat¬
ed at the geographic South Pole, or
as far down as one can go on our
planet.
Interesting experiments in the field
of polar aurorae and cosmic rays were
carried out in the southern ocean by
the American expeditionary vessel
"Eltanin". In many lands as widely
scattered as Iceland, South Africa,
Morocco and Japan, American scien¬
tists carried on observations in co¬
operation with local geophysicists.
British scientists carried out their
study of atmospheric physics and
various weather phenomena in their
relationship to the Quiet Sun at
stations on the British Isles, on board
four special weather ships cruising
the North Atlantic and on board the
famous research vessel "Discovery"
assigned to the Indian Ocean. The
earth's magnetic field was studied by
home stations, by stations on Mau
tius Island and on board the scientific
ship "Vidal"

QUIET SUN (Continued)
Solar observations from land, sea and space
28
The British network of stations
designated to observe the polar auro¬
rae stretched from North Scotland to
Halley Bay In Antarctica, while the
stations studying the ionosphere
were scattered from Edinburgh and
Sheffield to Singapore and the Wed-
dell Sea that washes the Antarctic
ice-cap. The English climate did not
appear to interfere with radio observa¬
tion of the sun, which was success-
fulry carried on with the aid of the
giant 75-metre radio telescope of the
Jodrell Bank Observatory. A regular
battery of scientific instruments was
set up on the Woomera Range in
Australia for launching the British
"Skylark" rockets Into the upper layers
of the atmosphere.
A substantial contribution to the
project was made by the scientists
of the Federal German Republic. The
Max Planck Institute of Aeronomy
built an observatory in the Harz
Mountains, which was used for the
observation of satellites and the study
of the behaviour of the ionosphere.
The Scherhag Institute in Berlin under¬
took to prepare daily weather charts
for the entire northern hemisphere,
and this made it possible to study
the effect of solar perturbations on
stratosphere temperatures.
An interesting and important pro¬
gramme was implemented by the
scientists of the German Democratic
Republic. Ozone, in its relationship
with the fitful behaviour of the sun,
was studied at Potsdam, magnetic
variations coinciding with the days of
an undisturbed sun were recorded at
Niemegk; and studies in the field of
wave propagation were carried on at
Kuhlungsborn.
A major part of the IQSY pro¬
gramme was Implemented by the geo¬
physicists of Czechoslovakia, Japan,
France, India, Canada, Poland, Italy
and Australia. While space does not
permit mentioning their individual
contributions, it may be said' that the
work of each was integrated in this
international effort, and each carried
an important share.
The Information on solar-terrestrial
effects collected over the period
covered by the IQSY in such widely
scattered areas as Yakutia in Soviet
Siberia, the Peruvian Andes, Antarctica
and the Island of Capri, will serve, in
all the 70 participating countries, as
a point of departure for scientific
theorizing in search of explanations
for worldwide physical processes.
While the most important conclu¬
sions still remain to be drawn, some
have already become apparent. Thus,
while the sun was undisturbed polar
aurorae were rarely observed outside
the Arctic and the Antarctic. There
were fewer magnetic and ionospheric
storms to cause compass deviations
and black out radio communication.
A deterioration was observed of the
flux of X-rays and ultraviolet rays and
the shower of incoming charged par¬
ticles. Changing conditions in the upper
atmosphere brought about a measure
of change in weather phenomena.
Changes were also observed In the
pattern of radiation zones encircling
our planet.
Rockets yielded a great amount of
information on the upper layers of the
atmosphere, which is precisely where
the earth's atmospheric envelope
receives most of the impact of the
various solar emanations. More in¬
formation is now available on the flux,
reflection and distribution of solar
heat; on the movement of large air
masses; on the behaviour of cloud
canopies; and on the effect of solar
activity on the density of the upper
atmosphere.
The expedition on the "Zarya"
discovered extensive magnetic anom¬
alies in the North Atlantic, off the
coasts of the British Isles.
The study of polar aurorae has
dispelled some of the mystery
surrounding the chemical composition
of the upper atmosphere, which was
discovered to contain atomic hydrogen
and helium of terrestrial origin. It Is
now clear that the chemical composi¬
tion of the outer ionosphere Is much
more complex than hitherto thought,
and that even short radio waves can
migrate repeatedly from hemisphere
to hemisphere following the terres¬
trial magnetic lines of force. Scientists
were able to establish that the intensity
of the cosmic rays, and more partic¬
ularly that of their component low
charge particles, roughly doubles dur¬
ing the period of an undisturbed sun,
while the flux of positive ions dwindles
to half Its volume.
It ¡s impossible to enumerate all the
scientific achievements under the
IQSY programme, all the more so as
progress in the field of geophysics
is nowadays almost too rapid to
follow.
The IQSY project is an excellent
example of the kind of joint effort on
an international scale that is required
by the very nature of the field under
study. Perhaps its greatest signifi¬
cance lies in the fact that it has
brilliantly demonstrated the fruitfulness
of businesslike co-operation among
the scientists of all lands.

REFUGEES

Yefim Zarjevski
United Nations Day (October
24) this year will be dedicat¬
ed to the cause of the world's
refugees. In 1965 the United
Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees was concerned
with over 3,000,000 refugees
in various parts of the world.
Most of them were satisfac¬
torily resettled, or were
being re-established in the
countries granting them asy¬
lum, but substantial numbers
still need help.
I N Europe alone 650,000
refugees come within the
mandate of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Some 12,000 of them are still in need
of help, and projects for their final
resettlement are now being carried out.
But in recent years new refugees have
been crossing frontiers at the rate of
10,000 a year.
A quick look at statistics from around
the world reveals the universal char¬

are added to material privation. What

initiative to make contact with others,
and will give him the will to carry on.
Ten years ago, the number of refu¬
gees in the world ran into millions
in India, Pakistan, Viet-Nam, Korea and
finally, Europe, where displaced per¬
sons were waiting for a rare chance
to emigrate (see the Unesco Courier,
January 1956).
Yet optimism of a kind was begin¬
ning to break through. With the help
of fellow citizens, the "national refu¬
gees", who had settled in countries
of which they were originally citizens,
were gradually overcoming their initial
trials. The others the million stateless
persons scattered throughout Europe
were beginning to benefit from the
assistance provided by UNHCR.
When the High Commissioner's post
was created in 1951, his field of
action was confined to international
protection, but by 1956 the scope of
the work had been expanded by funds
enabling him to implement programmes
designed to help integrate people for
whom, it had been thought, there was
little hope of resettlement.
These programmes were planned to
cover a period of ten years; in Europe,
they are now nearing completion.
They have also made possible the
resettlement of over 100,000 refugees
In Europe and the Middle East.
The programmes comprised a wide
variety of measures: low-rental ac¬
commodation in buildings constructed
with non-interest loans from UNHCR;
money and gifts to help provide fur¬
niture and occupational equipment;
accommodation in old peoples' homes
or hospitals for the aged and sick;
study and apprenticeship grants for
young people; occupational training for
the disabled; rehabilitation, vocational
guidance and legal aid.
While encouraging the on-the-spot
assimilation of refugees by such
measures, UNHCR continued to facili¬
tate migration within Europe and over¬
seas, with the collaboration of the
Intergovernmental Committee for Euro¬
pean Migration (ICEM), an organization
which provides emigrants with informa¬
tion and transportation.
It therefore seemed likely that post¬
war problems would vanish sooner
or later. Unfortunately, circumstances
proved such optimism to be unfounded.
In some areas, the old wounds were
still not healed; Arab refugees from
Palestine, for example, were still lead¬
ing a precarious existence in their
camps. The United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine
refugees is still helping them; but for
it, they would not have the barest
essentials. The joint UNRWA-Unesco
educational programme has provided
schooling for 200,000 refugee children
in these camps. Between 1958 and
1962, UNHCR and the League of Red
Cross Societies helped over 200,000
Algerians in Tunisia and Morocco.
At this stage, UNHCR decided to
define the part it should play in
unprecedented and unforeseen situa¬
tions situations in which the United
Nations General Assembly was re¬
questing it to intervene and "lend its
good offices" to assist refugees who
did not necessarily come under its
jurisdiction. Such situations had al¬
ready arisen, in Hong Kong, for exam¬
ple.
Through its "good offices" UNHCR
was also able to give prompt relief to
the African refugees, whose problems
were aggravated when countries pre¬
viously under colonial administration
achieved independence. Social, relig¬
ious and political disturbances led to
large-scale population movements,
involving whole communities, in over
ten countries in tropical Africa.
There were 270,000 refugees in the
Congo, 50,000 in Senegal, about
150,000 in Uganda, 5,000 in Zambia,
21,000 in the Central African Republic,
5,000 in Togo, 65,000 in Burundi, 27,000
in Tanzania and several thousand in
Rwanda nearly 600,000 uprooted peo¬
ple whose presence in the countries
that had received them was creating
difficult and urgent problems.
The most remarkable episode in the
African refugees' search for a new
homeland is undoubtedly that of the
Batutsi from Rwanda, who fled to the
Kivu in 1962, when Rwanda achieved
its independence (see the Unesco
Courier, January 1963). The Batutsi
numbered about 600,000. By 1964,
plans for their resettlement were
already advanced, thanks to the com¬
bined efforts of the League of Red
Cross Societies, UNHCR and the
International Labour Organization.
Disturbances broke out in the region,
however, interrupting work and making
life there precarious, if not impossible,
for many refugees.
Many of them set off again, this
time to Burundi, an already over-
populated country. At this juncture,
Tanzania generously offered to take
some of them, and UNHCR decided to
transport a group of 3,000 volunteers
there.
It was a long, tortuous journey; the
refugees had to cross Lake Kivu by
boat, fly over Rwanda, and travel by
train and truck to their destination
African refugees
drive their herds
of long-homed
cattle along
a road in Uganda.
In the first years
of this decade
there were about
150,000 refugees
in this country.
over the high plateaux of Mwezi (in
Swahili, the plateaux of the moon)
and all this to go 1,000 kilometres (625
miles. Todaya year laterthe 3,000
emigrants from Rwanda have cleared,
irrigated and ploughed the land and
built roads, dwellings, dispensaries
and schools. In short, they have
brought civilization to this part of
Africa.
For the High Commissioner for Ref¬
ugees it is an absolute rule never,
in any circumstances, to intervene in
any situation involving refugees unless
he is requested so to do by the govern¬
ment of a host country. UNHCR first
deals with the most urgent needs, and,
on the advice of an expert on the spot,
opens limited provisional credits to
cover emergency aid.
UNHCR itself, however, has no
operational powers; it therefore has
to call upon an organization such as
the League of Red Cross Societies,
which sends its delegates and medical
teams to the spot and, In many cases,
employs its own methods to obtain
assistance in cash and in kind for the
work it is undertaking.
There are many other organizations,
however, besides this traditional collab¬
orator, which participate, at the re¬
quest of UNHCR, in its various assis¬
tance programmes, and especially in
resettlement projects. In implement-

### United Nations Day, 1966: the world's refugees
ing these, UNHCR calls upon the
United Nations specialized agencies
such as ILO, WHO, FAO, or the United
Nations Development Programme.
Unesco uses its experience to provide
aid progressively Increasing for the
education of the refugees and their
children. The World Food Programme
is also asked to assist, especially in
the initial stages of resettlement in
rural areas, in providing food for the
refugees until their own harvests can
meet their needs.
These organizations, moreover, are
concerned with promoting the system¬
atic economic and social development
of whole regions, and the operations
they undertake to assist new arrivals
have to be co-ordinated with the rate
of progress in the country in which
they are settling.
In terms of actual assistance, there¬
fore, UNHCR acts as a co-ordinator
and a go-between. Its small budget
($ 3,500,000 In 1965) from the voluntary
contributions of 57 governments can
barely cover more than a fraction of
an assistance programme, but that
fraction is often of the greatest import¬
ance, since it provides the impetus
for an upsurge of international solidar¬
ity and co-operation.
But the strength of UNHCR is that,
In a given situation, its role is that
of a disinterested party acting on
behalf of the community of nations,
whose sole interest is the humanitar¬
ian aspect of the problems to be
solved.
This stand debars It from concerning
itself with the political reasons for the
refugees' plight but also earns it the
confidence of governments.
More and more countries 49 to
date have signed the 1951 Convention
on the Status of Refugees. Many
others, following the principles laid
down by the Convention, have given
all their refugees a status guaranteeing
that they will not be sent back to a
country where their life or liberty would
be endangered because of their race,
religion or nationality, or because of the
social group they belong to or the
political opinions they hold.
Although it is for the authorities in
the host country to determine the stat¬
us of the refugee, UNHCR has super¬
visory rights in this matter, and in most
of the countries where it maintains a
representative and which have signed
the Convention it is able to uphold the
cause of the refugee. A special travel
document, issued in accordance with
the Convention, enables refugees to
travel, which they could not otherwise
do, for lack of a national passport.
UNHCR has also encouraged the
conclusion of other international agree
ments designed to improve the lot of
the refugee. The Agreement relating
to Refugee Seamen, for instance, which
entered into force in 1961, helps sea¬
men who have no travel documents to
obtain legal status. Through close co¬
operation with other intergovernmental
organizations, UNHCR is continuing its
efforts to extend the right of seeking
asylum to all refugees, to simplify the
process of obtaining identity papers, to
secure for refugees the right to pursue
the liberal professions, to make it
easier for refugees to go from one
country to another, and so on.
Aiding refugees is essentially a hu¬
mane task, and one which serves the
cause of peace; but it should also
be as it aims to be constructive.
Its object, in the densely populated
countries of Europe or in the sparsely
populated regions of Africa, Is to settle
refugees Into the community and to
help them to become self-supporting
and integrated as speedily as possible.
United Nations Day, October 24, 1966,
will mark the launching of a fund-raising
campaign in many European countries to
aid refugees, mainly in Africa and Asia.
Proceeds will help to finance re-settlement
projects and also rural settlement centres,
dispensaries and schools projects with
which a great many private voluntary organ¬
izations as well as the U.N. specialized
agencies are associated.

### Ungathered harvests in the ocean; man's vast potential food reserve

UNGATHERED HARVESTS
IN THE OCEAN
(Continued from page 15)
feed and put it into concentrates for
direct human consumption, and find
the right set of economic keys for this,
we would have a strong weapon
against malnutrition.
In any such scheme to reduce our
food problems, we must increasingly
rely on international co-operation to
the point where internationalism has
become the most important single
factor In world fishing.
Meanwhile, man's ability to catch
more fish is leading to international
complications. Ironically, as the catch
goes up and traditional grounds such
as the North Sea and thé Grand Banks
are fished ever more intensively, more
effort in men and gear must be put
forth to harvest the same amount of
fish. Nations have begun to try to
protect their own coastal fisheries by
keeping foreign fishermen outside a
certain fishing limit.
Since 1959, this has caused an
increasing number of international in¬
cidents. A healthy side effect has been
that, as traditional grounds become
depleted or restricted, the search for
newer grounds has been spurred and
many new sources of sea food have
been discovered; for example, the
Arabian Sea and the rich shrimp
grounds of the Persian Gulf.
As the search continues, a new
concept of ocean ownership is being
forced upon us. This negates the old
idea that no one owned the ocean
beyond territorial limits. It implies that
all nations own the sea and must
accept attendant responsibilities.
A recent example of where this has
gone wrong is seen in the overhunting
of Antarctic whales to the point of
commercial extinction of the larger
species and consequent loss of a
potentially great world food source.
In the eastern Pacific, the only areas
where sufficient research has been
done on tuna stocks, yellowfin tuna
were found to be declining. Fortuna¬
tely, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission has been able to work out
regulations for maximum national
catches in the area. No similar
research has been done in the Atlantic,
but there has been a recent decline in
the catch per longline hook, which
may be an advance warning of deple¬
tion. FAO hopes soon to set up a
strong commission for research, con¬
servation and management of Atlantic
tuna.
In recent years almost every part of
the ocean has come under the sur¬
veillance of some kind of fisheries
commission, by region, species, or
both. We must ensure responsible
International co-operation if we are to
keep the sea resources we have and
increase them.
From the Unesco New
Sunpower for spacecraft
A propulsion system for use In space
which derives power from the sun alone
is beginning to show promise. The idea
is to combine large, lightweight arrays
of solar cells with an electric propulsion
system, to generate a small but continuous
thrust. Studies in the U.S.A. have dem¬
onstrated that solar cell arrays having
a much higher power-to-weight ratio than
those so far employed in spacecraft are
indeed possible. One concept Is for a
flexible array of solar cells that would be
unwound from a drum in space. Another
arrangement uses a "skin" of silicon cells
a mere 0.004 inch thick. Arrays of this
sort would feed their power to such "micro-
thrusters" as the ¡on and plasma rockets
now under development in several labora¬
tories.
Fighting river blindness
Israelis and Liberians are co-operating
to provide Liberia with a comprehensive
eye-service. Among the diseases they are
fighting is river blindness, a disease which
causes great suffering in Liberia where its
incidence is among the highest in the world.
River blindness is transmitted to human
beings by the bite of a black fly, which in¬
jects microscopic live worm parasites under
the skin, from where they migrate through
the bloodstream to the eye, thereby causing
blindness. Teams of Israeli opthalmolo-
gists have been sent in rotation to Liberia
to set up and run an eye hospital In Mon¬
rovia, while Liberians have been trained in
Jerusalem to take over the service in their
own country within six years.
Forests and the future
By 1975 the world will need nearly 50
per cent more wood and wood products than
it did in 1961, according to a recent FAO
study which says that most of this addi¬
tional wood will come from the world's
temperate forests, particularly those of
North America. The study, the first such
global analysis carried out on a country-by-
country basis, also looks beyond 1975 and
points out that even the huge reserves of
Canada and the Soviet Union are not limit¬
less. It suggests that other regions might
come into prominence as timber-suppliers
through man-made forests capable of yields
five to ten times higher than those of
temperate forests.
More technicians
for Ceylon
A six-year programme to train engineers
and technicians in Ceylon to help ¡the na¬
tion's industrial growth is to be administered
by Unesco on behalf of the United Nations
Development Programme. Costing some
$4.7 million, the project will be set up at the
Ceylon College of Technology, where Unesco
will help to establish three-year technician
courses and five-year diploma engineering
courses in civil, mechanical and electrical
engineering. Ceylon will contribute the
equivalent of $3 million, chiefly for the
expansion of classrooms and laboratories
and the provision of teaching and adminis¬
trative staffs.
Fresh water from the sea
Aerial inspections have been made by a
joint study group of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, Mexico and the United
States to investigate potential sites for a
nuclear water desalting plant In the Gulf of
California area. The group was set up last
year to examine the technical and econom¬
ic practicability of a dual-purpose nuclear
power plant designed to produce fresh water
from the sea and electricity for the arid
regions of Arizona and California (U.S.A.)
and Sonora and Lower California (Mexico).
Car for Asian farmers
U.N. specialists are helping Asian farmers
with the design and production of a farmer's
car that would eventually replace the tra¬
ditional bullock cart. The proposed vehicle
should cost under $500, do about 50 miles
per gallon, have a high road clearance and
should be suitable for travelling across
fields. It is hoped to display a vehicle of
this kind at the First International Asian
Trade Fair, in Bangkok, in November.
Computer-based
weather service
The Swedish Weather Bureau's activities
will be completely automated within five
years if a plan proposed by the Swedish
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute is
put into effect. Three computers would
handle telecommunications and the drawing
of observation, analysis and forecast maps.
The country's 1,000 regional weather offices
would be replaced by fewer stations with
more advanced equipment. The Swedish
Institute has based its project on the World
Weather Watch plan which calls for a unified
world system for the exchange of weather
information.
Training Africa's
literacy leaders
A Workshop for African Planners and
Organizers of Adult Literacy Programmes
recently brought 6ome 30 educators from
20 African countries to Tashkent, for a
seminar organized by Unesco and the
U.S.S.R. which enabled teachers, adult
education officials and school supervisors
to study literacy teaching methods that have
been used by the Soviet Union. At about
the same time, courses on the planning and
administration of literacy programmes for
French-speaking Unesco member states in
Africa were being given at the Institute of

Planning and Economic Development in Da¬
kar, Senegal. Studies in Dakar included
the problem of financing literacy campaigns,
the role of teachers and the kinds of aid
available; special attention was given to the
role of women in education.
Saving the one-horned rhino
Depredations by poachers have reduced
the population of the Asian one-horned rhi¬
noceros, whose home is in the Kaziranga
Wild Life Sanctuary, Assam, to under 400.
The animal is hunted for its single horn,
whose alleged but entirely mythical aphro¬
disiac and medicinal properties give it a
black market value of as much as $1,000
a pound. In an effort to save the remain¬
ing animals, a group of experts, including
specialists from the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources, has proposed that the Kaziranga
Sanctuary be converted into a national park.
World federation
of engineers is proposed
A move to establish the first world feder¬
ation of engineers has been made by an
international meeting of representatives of
engineering organizations held in Unesco
House. The proposed organization to be
called the International Conference of Engi¬
neering Societies would be composed of
national and regional groups. The constitu¬
tion proposed by the Paris meeting declares
that "a strong and dynamic engineering
profession is essential to the successful
development of any nation."
Pocket reading machine
for the blind
A new reading machine no bigger than
a pocket flashlamp which can read any¬
thing from Shakespeare to the label on a
can of food is being developed for the
blind. The Visotactor, as it is called by
its two U.S. inventors, is still in the exper¬
imental stage, but its essential features
have been developed. It consists of pho¬
tocells and finger vibrators. By slipping
fingers Into four slots and moving the Viso¬
tactor across a printed or written page
the blind receive vibrations that signify let¬
ters, 26 transistors in the handle of the
machine translating pictures from the photo¬
cells Into electro-mechanical vibration. It is
expected that commercial production will
begin within two or three years.
The man with the axe
The forest worker and his working condi¬
tions illustrate one of the main differences
between the developed and the developing
countries. Where labour Is cheap and abun¬
dant, man's muscle almost exclusively is
used to chop down trees. Where labour is
scarce and expensive, elaborate machines
have been introduced to do the work. Prim¬
itive working methods can mean as much
as 50 times more expenditure of effort than
when the same job is handled efficiently.
Nutritional differences can account for as
much as 70 percent increase in work cap¬
acity, according to a study comparing the
output of Indian and Swedish forest wor¬
kers. Problems of the care and more effi¬
cient use of the forest worker long the
concern of such international organizations
as FAO, ILO and WHO were studied re¬
cently during a session on "the human fac¬
tor in forestry" at the Sixth World Forestry
Congress in Madrid.
Untapped
inland fish resources
The vast network of lakes and reservoirs
formed by dams in the central United States
could supply additional millions of pounds
of fish a year if proper boats were designed
and built for fishing them, according to
two U.S. fisheries experts. In a paper pre¬
sented to an FAO meeting on fishing boats
held in Sweden, they say that though the
dams were built for flood control, irrigation
or hydro-electric purposes, there is no rea¬
son why their waters should not support
thriving commercial fisheries. Among
examples they quote is the Kentucky Lake
in Tennessee which covers 158,000 acres
and has a potential yield of 32 million
pounds of fish annually.
Museums of India
"Although India is often grouped with the
developing nations in some aspects of its
activity as a nation having assumed inde¬
pendence only eighteen years ago, it is
among the countries which can show a long
museum history," writes Grace Morley, hon¬
orary adviser on museums to the Govern¬
ment of India (1). Of India's 200 museums,
five are more than a century old and the
oldest, the Indian Museum in Calcutta, goes
back to the late eighteenth century. A re¬
view of India's museums presents a picture
of diversity and utility. The Archaeological
Survey of India maintains a dozen site mu¬
seums in addition to looking after 3,000
historical monuments. Municipal, university
and private museums devoted to archaeo¬
logy, traditional cultures or natural history
play a major role in education and culture.
Three museums of industry and technology
at Calcutta, Bangalore and Pilani are an
invaluable help in supplementing teaching
in science and technology.

XVIII, No. 4. 1965; 10/-, $2.00).
Flashes...
Paris is the world's most overcrowded
city with 32,000 people per square kilometre
as against 16,000 in Tokyo and 13,200 in
New York, reports WHO.
Primary school attendance in Peru rose
from just over one million to nearly two
million between 1960 and 1965.
Some Í67 million motor vehicles are
now in use throughout the world. Of these,
nearly 90 million are in the U.S.A. and
57 million are in Europe.
There are probably 10 to 20 million ac¬
tive tuberculosis cases in the world and
the disease kills between one and two
million persons every year, reports WHO.
Fully 70 percent of the world's one and
a half million fishing boats are still powered
by sail or paddle, says FAO, which sees the
equipping of these craft with outboard mo¬
tors as a rapid, practical way to raise fish
catches in the developing nations.

THE REFLECTING TELESCOPE
Sir.
In "Great Men, Great Events" (March
1966), you state that Newton's studies
on light led him to invent the reflect¬
ing telescope. This is an erroneous
idea. In 1616, Nicholas Zucchi, a Jesuit
priest, from Parma, had already built
a reflecting telescope equipped with a
concave metallic mirror. Because of
the short distance between the mirror
and the eyepiece, he was obliged to
place the mirror obliquely; this produc¬
ed an astigmatism and, as a result, a
distorted image.
In 1634, another priest. Father Mar¬
in Mersenne, of Paris, suggested a
way to avoid tilting the concave mir¬
ror: by piercing it and then using a
small secondary mirror to direct the
rays of light through this opening.
Independently, a Scottish mathema¬
tician, James Gregory, had a similar
idea in 1660, but with the difference
that the secondary mirror collected the
rays of light and directed them to an
eyepiece placed behind the main mir¬
ror. In Mersenne's telescope the smal¬
ler mirror had also served as an eye¬
piece. Gregory's reflecting telescope
was actually constructed, but proved
unsatisfactory because of optical aber¬
rations. In 1674, the year before Gre¬
gory's death, the English astronomer
Robert Hooke produced the first sat¬
isfactory Gregorian telescope.
In the meantime, Isaac Newton had
also been studying the problem of the
reflecting telescope. He conceived the
idea of placing the collecting mirror
at an angle of 45 degrees to the prim¬
ary mirror, thereby inflecting the con¬
verging rays of light at right angles
towards the eyepiece. In December
1671, Newton presented his telescope
to the Royal Society, of which he was
shortly afterwards made a member.
The same year, a Frenchman, Fran¬
çois Cassegrain, also demonstrated a
telescope which he had based on
Gregory's instrument. Cassegrain tele¬
scopes are still widely used today.

WANDERING SHOALS
Sir,
In Daniel Behrrrfan's interesting art¬
icle, "A New Mediterranean Fishing
Problem" (March 1966), the writer dis¬
cusses the fact that the first large-
scale appearance of Red Sea species
occurred in the Mediterranean between
1940 and 1945, and asks why the
change occurred so long after the
opening of the Suez Canal.
May I, as a long-time inhabitant of
these shores though not an ichthyolo¬
gist offer a suggestion.
For several years during World War
II, the Suez Canal was blocked to
all through-going shipping. If, as your
article states, the current in the Suez
Canal flows from the Red Sea to the
Mediterranean during eight months of
the year, plankton and fish could flow
with it, totally undisturbed by steam¬
ers and the accompanying discharge
of oil and other unhealthy substances,
during these years as far as I know
the only period during which the Canal
was not used for inter-sea traffic.
If the stoppage of traffic during the
war years brought with it a wandering
of shoals, the phenomenon should
have been observed by people living
along the canal. Systematic enquiry
among these people may help the
scientists interested in solving the
problem.

ANCIENT AFRICAN SCRIPTS
Sir,
I have read with interest your article,
"Ancient Scripts from the Heart of
Africa" (March 1966). It was most
interesting and informative, but I would
like to point out two minor errors. On
page 26 you state "Momolu Massakwa,
the Liberian consul lh Britain, has told
how the Vai transmitted news. ..by
means of pictograms on strips of
bark." The correct spelling of the
name is Momolu Massaquol and he
was Liberian consul in Hamburg, Ger¬
many, rather than Britain.

THE STEP TO MAN
Sir,
In "The Step to Man" (Dec. 1965),
John R. Piatt wonders whether the
dramatic changes of modern life will
converge to various kinds of limits and
doubts whether science can keep on
expanding indefinitely. He also tries to
foresee how man will live in the future.
I think it would be wrong to envis¬
age life in the future on the basis of
science alone. Science is very impor¬
tant today, but neither it, nor philosphy,
nor art can influence all people. But
to develop a new society, a new world
needs the efforts of all people. By
what can we influence everyone ?
I think, by affection, and the first place
where affection is needed is in school.
To my mind our present day educa¬
tion is too little concerned with giving
young people the right outlook. In
general they acquire only knowledge,
and the number of those who leave
school with an awareness of other
people's problems and an urge to be
helpful is very small. I'm sure there
would be far fewer "Teddy boys" and
"Halbstarkes" if the educational spirit
were perceptive and in harmony with
the modern world.

MESSAGES TO THE STARS
Sir,
In his intensely interesting article,
"Messages to the Stars" (Jan. 1966),
D.M.A. Mercer discusses the possibil¬
ity of sending the digits of pi (the
ratio of the circumference of a circle
to its diameter, 3.141592) as an intro¬
ductory message to alien intelligent
beings.
In its traditional form, pi is written,
of course, on the decimal base a
number base that is unlikely to be
used by anyone other than humans
with ten fingers.
If the digit pi is used I feel it should
be transcribed into the simplest num¬
ber base and the one most likely to be
used by those who may pick up the
message. The most suitable base
would be the binary system, in which
case pi would become 11.0010010000
111111011010111...
It would be even better to send the
digit pi written according to different
number bases. This would enable in¬
telligent beings not only to show us,
by the choice they make of our re¬
peated signals, what they have under¬
stood, but also to reveal their own
system of numeration. .

YOUTH WITH A PURPOSE
Sir,
I enclose an article from one of
our Canadian newspapers, describing
archaeological work done by students,
which I thought stressed a point
brought out in your July-August 1965
issue on Youth: young people doing
constructive work during their holidays,
learning as well as enjoying themsel¬
ves and keeping out of trouble, unlike
other young people of this age who
seem to take pleasure all over the
world in rioting, looting, vandalism and
terrorizing whole communities with
their wild sprees of jazz and destruc¬
tion. Why can't the constructive young
people get the same publicity and
admiration from their own age group
instead of from fuddy duddies of
50 like me? It Is Inexplicable!
I enjoy your magazine which I find
both interesting and informative.

GOOD WORDS FOR GOOD WORK
Sir,
I am one American who believes
very much in the U.N. I am aware of
the criticism launched against the good
work of the U.N. and its agencies . . .
and it makes me feel quite sad that,
particularly, some professed Chris¬
tians are so critical of the way our
united efforts with other countries are
bringing health and education to people
in some of the underdeveloped areas
of the world.

YEARS OF THE QUIET SUN. Children at play depict their
own familiar, everyday world bathed in the rays of the
sun. For long the sun was worshipped as the giver of
food, heat and light, but man knew little of his nearest
star, which commands the movements of the earth and
© APN
planets. Today he has learned that it experiences periods
of intense activity and others of relative calm. During
"The Years of the Quiet Sun" in 1964-1965, scientists from
over 70 countries carried out a vast solar research project
whose results are now being studied (see page 22).
