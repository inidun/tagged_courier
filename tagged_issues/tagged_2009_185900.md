Troubled waTer
Increased demand, waste and insufficient investment: water shortage may 
come sooner than we think. although water covers three-quarters  
of the world’s surface, only 0.0075% of this immense volume is available  
for humanity’s use. Some countries have already reached the limits  
of their resources.

5000 children die every day from 
diarrhoea, or one every 17 seconds. 
In all, about one tenth of all illness-
es worldwide could be avoided by 
improving water supply, sanitation, 
hygiene and management of water 
resources.
One kilo of meat = 
16,000 litres of water
While part of the population still 
lacks adequate access to water, 
demand has never been greater. 
Freshwater withdrawals have tripled 
over the last 50 years, while the 
area under irrigation doubled during 
the same period. This phenomenon 
is particularly linked to population 
growth. The world’s population, 
currently estimated at 6.6 billion, is 
growing by about 80 million people 
each year. This means demand for 
freshwater is increasing by 64 bil-
lion cubic metres a year. 
Population growth implies in-
creased demand for agricultural 
products, and so increased de-
mand for water. Agriculture is by far 
the greatest consumer of water, ac-
counting for 70% of all water con-
sumption (compared to 20% for in-
dustry and 10% for domestic use). 
There have been changes in life-
styles and eating habits in recent 
years, in particular an increase in 
the share of meat and dairy prod-
ucts consumed in emerging coun-
tries. The production of a kilo of 
wheat requires 800 to 4000 litres 
of water, while a kilo of beef, takes 
2000 to 16,000 litres. 
Water shortage linked to climate 
change can also be expected. Ex-
perts say that by 2030, 47% of 
world population will be living in 
areas of high water stress. Water 
scarcity in some arid and semi-ar-
id regions will have major impacts 
on migration. From 24 to 700 mil-

the importance of water  
in development  
and economic growth
Editorial
demand is increasing, and some 
countries are already reaching the 
limits of their water resources. The 
effects of climate change are likely 
to aggravate this situation even 
further. Competition for water is 
intensifying – whether between 
countries, urban and rural areas, 
or different sectors of activity. This 
may make water an increasingly po-
liticized issue. 
Access to basic water-related ser-
vices remains inadequate in much 
of the developing world. The link be-
tween poverty and water resources 
is obvious: the number of people 
living on less than US$1.25 a day 
coincides approximately with the 
number of those without access to 
safe drinking water. 
This situation has a major impact 
on health. Almost 80% of diseases 
in developing countries are associ-
ated with water, causing some three 
million early deaths. For example,

demand for water has never been greater, due 
to such factors as population growth, changes 
in food consumption and increased energy 
production. These are among the conclusions 
of the latest United Nations World

an assessment of water resources, entitled  
‘Water in a changing world’. It highlights

displaced because of a scarcity of 
water. 
Obviously water is one of the key 
issues the world, and particularly 
developing countries, has to face. 
Yet an inadequate percentage of 
budget allocation by governments 
and in official aid goes to water. For 
example, overseas development 
assistance to the total water sector 
has been decreasing and remains 
at only about 5% of total aid flow. 
At the same time, corruption in the 
water sector may add to the over-
all cost of these investments: typi-
cal examples include falsified me-
ter readings, favouritism in public 
equipment purchases, and nepo-
tism in the allocation of public con-
tracts. Estimates indicate that 30% 
of budgets can be siphoned off in 
some countries. These practices 
are rarely curbed, despite initiatives 
by some countries, like South Af-
rica.
Managing crisis
Confronted with shortages, some 
countries have already begun to 
integrate their strategies for man-
aging water resources with their 
development plans. Urban waste-
water use remains limited for agri-
cultural purposes, except in certain 
countries: 40% of uses in the Gaza 
Strip (Palestinian Territories), 15% 
in Israel and 16% in Egypt. 
Desalination of sea water is an-
other process used in arid regions. 
It is used to obtain drinking water 
and for industrial use in countries 
that have reached the limits of their 
renewable water resources (e.g. 
Saudi Arabia, Israel, Cyprus). 
Australia has also changed its poli-
cies, with a range of new measures. 
Restrictions have been introduced — 
on watering gardens, washing cars, 
filling swimming pools, etc — in the 
country’s major cities. In Sydney, a 
dual water supply was introduced 
in 2008 — one for drinking water, 
another for other uses, which draws 
on recycled water. 
This issue of the Courier includes 
a series of articles illustrating the 
main points of the latest World Wa-
ter Development Report, “Water in 
a changing world”.

### 186116: The Water we eat

              70% of this resource, which is both omnipresent and scarce. growing plants that are resistant

1960. In 2006 the figure was over 
80 million. According to the Institute 
for Water Education, 3000 litres of 
water are required to produce one 
kilogramme of rice, 16,000 litres for 
a kilogramme of beef.
Wanna fill up –  
or drink?”
Automobile production is booming 
too. Between 20,000 and 300,000 
litres of water are needed to make 
a car. Bio fuel has become increas-
ingly popular over the last few years. 
Cars need fuel, too. Ethanol, made 
from maize or sugar cane, has be-
come a profitable source of income 
for farmers in Mexico and Brazil, ag-
gravating not only the problem of 
food, but that of water, too. About 
2500 litres of water are required 
to produce one litre of ethanol. Ac-
cording to World Energy Outlook 
2006, biofuel production is increas-
ing at the rate of approximately 7% 
per year. This may not present so 
much of a problem in rain-laden 
he Earth really ought to be called 
‘Aqua’, because more than two-
thirds of our planet is covered by 
water. It’s where life evolved, and, 
even four billion years later, life still 
needs it. 
Paradoxically, though, water is a 
commodity in short supply — 97.5% 
is actually salt water, making it un-
usable for humanity. And most of 
the fresh water is not obtainable, 
either, being frozen in glaciers, inac-
cessibly deep beneath the earth’s 
surface, or in swamps. Only about 
0.0075% of total water is acces-
sible fresh water – and even that 
is very unevenly distributed around 
the world. 
Water shortage is a big problem, 
particularly in developing coun-
tries, since these countries are 
mainly arid and dependent upon 
agriculture, which swallows up 
most of the water used world-
wide. According to the United Na-
tions Water Development Report 
2009, this is approximately 70%, 
and could even double by the year 
2050. 
Asia is the thirstiest of all. Admit-
tedly, the continent – according to 
the UN Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization — holds the second larg-
est stock of fresh water on earth, 
but this is also the site of 70% of 
total irrigated agricultural areas 
world-wide. The four billion Asians, 
however, consume only about 6% of 
the water, and industry 10%. A good 
84 % is swallowed up by agriculture. 
Things are moving swiftly on the 
Asian continent. It’s estimated that 
about 9 billion people will be living 
on Earth in 2050, 5 billion of them in 
Asia. But it’s not just the population 
figures that are rising; the economy 
is growing and prosperity increas-
ing, bringing with it a change in 
consumer behaviour. The produc-
tion of rice – which is extremely wa-
ter-intensive anyway – will be joined 
by the increasing demand for meat. 
Approximately 2.5 million tons of 
meat were produced in China in

### 186116: The Water we eat

Brazil, but biofuel could well be-
come one in the China or India of 
the future. 
Just as you can already hear peo-
ple in Mexico sometimes saying 
“Wanna fill up – or eat?” you may 
one day hear people in Asia asking 
“Wanna fill up – or drink?” 
It’s agriculture, then, that’s the 
main water-waster. It is estimated 
that about half the water used is 
wasted. That translates to 30% 
of the Earth’s total available fresh 
water. This gives rise to a huge 
potential saving. There are sev-
eral ways to go about it. “Irriga-
tion is very inefficient”, says Jan 
Olof Lundqvist from the Stock-
holm International Water Institute. 
“And there is quite a big loss of 
food during production. That is 
what we call the loss from tree to 
fork.” About half of all food is lost 
in harvesting, storage and trans-
portation. “All the food produced 
needed water – and that means: 
if we lost the food, we also lost 
the water.” 
But savings can be made at the 
beginning of the production chain 
as well. Surface irrigation is main-
ly used in developing countries, 
usually by damming methods, also 
used for the cultivation of rice. It is 
cheap and technically simple. The 
drawback is that a large propor-
tion of the water is lost by seepage 
and evaporation — approximately 
half of it. 
It would be easy to make savings 
here by using drip irrigation. By 
means of hoses or pipes laid above 
(or better, below) the ground, small 
amounts of water are directly aimed 
at the plants. This method is eco-
nomical, but also costly. In addition, 
technical know-how is necessary for 
laying the pipes and, once installed, 
cultivation is no longer flexible. 
“And it needs very much energy”, 
says Lundqvist. “You need pumps 
to get the water everywhere. The 
investments are fairly high – so it 
is not suitable for every crop, es-
pecially not for rice production. It’s 
simply too expensive.”
New strategies
Lundqvist can see other avenues 
for improvement: “For rice produc-
tion and not so high-value crops you 
could improve the situation simply 
by working on the coordination be-
tween water supply schedules and 
farming operations.” The problem is 
simple: there’s usually not enough 
water there when it’s needed, and 
vice-versa. In Lundqvist’s opinion 
there is an urgent need for farm-
ers to improve their water manage-
ment. 
And one final point: “There is a 
need to utilize more ‘green water’ 
in agriculture – which means rain-
fall”, Lundqvist says. “It should be 
captured and stored, probably by 
underground storage systems.” 
But what should be done in areas 
where it rarely rains? “There, it would 
be a good thing to have drip irriga-
tion – however, it wouldn’t make 
any sense to grow water-intensive 
crops there.” One solution for these 
regions – albeit controversial — 
might be genetically modified plants 
resistant to drought and salt. “But 
still: farmers won’t use them if they 
can’t sell them”, says Lundqvist. 
One possible alternative here 
could be the production of biofuel. 
Jatropha curcas is a spurge plant, 
the seeds of which contain 30% 
oil. The plant requires little water, 
and the oil can be processed to 
make bio diesel. It does, however,

he believes it can be done. “I’m a 
born optimist.”

Germany, correspondent

the water we eat
contain toxicants as well. “In India 
and parts of Africa, Jatropha can 
be grown without competition with 
water and food production”, says 
Lundqvist. “But it depends on the 
scale. And I suppose the scale 
will be fairly modest, compared to 
the amount of energy that will be 
needed.” 
Apart from saving water, the exploi-
tation of new water sources could 
be the solution, particularly for the 
other regions. The huge amounts 
of water in the oceans, for example. 
But the desalination of water re-
quires lots of energy and money. 
Which is why, in numerical terms, 
it doesn’t play a big role yet. Only 
one% of desalinated water is used 
for agriculture. “Thanks to modern 
membrane technology, the prices 
for water desalination have come 
down,” says Lundqvist. “Fifty cents 
(in US$) per thousand litres – but 
that‘s still too expensive for the 
amounts of water that you need for 
food production.” This is why Lun-
dqvist regards desalination more 
as an option for producing drinking 
water and possibly for the produc-
tion of premium foodstuffs. 
If one were to succeed in further 
reducing the cost of desalination, 
the water problem could be largely 
resolved . The Desertec consortium 
has concepts for linking concen-
trating solar thermal power (CSP) 
plants – mirrors that concentrate 
sunlight and produce cheap elec-
tricity on the coast of North Africa 
and the Middle East - with desali-
nation plants. These regions are 
the most arid in the world, so their 
problems could thereby be solved 
in one fell swoop. 
Climate change will also aggra-
vate the water crisis in the future. “It 
will bring big changes in the rainfall 
pattern”, says Lundqvist. “Therefore 
it is important to have a strategy to 
combine irrigation and supplemen-
tary irrigation systems with local

### 186117: Blue scorpions against water corruption

As demand for clean water grows 
worldwide, so do concerns about 
corruption in the water sector. Not 
least in South Africa, where a gov-
ernment unit that combats water 
crime is getting a much-needed 
boost. 
Water corruption in Southern 
Africa hit the headlines earlier this 
decade when the chief executive of 
a US$8 billion construction project 
was found guilty of having accepted 
more than US$2 million in bribes 
from multinational construction 
companies to secure contracts. 
Masupha Ephraim Sole was in 
charge of the Lesotho Highlands 
Water Project, an ambitious pro-
gramme to build dams and canals 
for water transfer from the highlands 
of Lesotho, a country the size of Bel-
gium which is entirely surrounded 
by South Africa, to the dry Gauteng 
area around Johannesburg. 
Despite limited assistance from 
the international community, Leso-
tho succeeded in bringing the err-
ing parties to justice — the chief ex-
ecutive was sentenced to 18 years 
in prison in 2002 and some of the 
companies involved received multi-
million fines and have been de-
barred from receiving World Bank 
contracts.
Fighting corruption
Since the incident, the govern-
ments of both Lesotho and South 
Africa have stepped up their fight 
against corruption in the water sec-
tor. Such corruption can take many 
forms, from petty bribing to avoid a 
pollution fine to multi-million payoffs 
to secure large contracts. 
In South Africa, compliance with 
water regulations is monitored and 
enforced by a special unit in the 
Department of Water Affairs and 
Forestry (DWAF). The unit is nick-
named the “Blue Scorpions” after 
the country’s elite anti-corruption 
force, the Scorpions. 
The Blue Scorpions, set up in 
2005, fight a range of water-related 
crime, from pollution to unlawful 
abstraction of South Africa’s water 
courses. The funding increase will 
increase the unit’s number of staff 
from a handful to, eventually, over 
100. It is also going to get access 
to better technology, including sat-
ellite imaging, to track down wrong-
doers. 
Corruption is one part of the murky 
activity the unit unveils, says Nigel 
Adams, its director. “If you get to 
a place and there’s just a big hole 
in the ground, but 50 million rand 
(nearly US$5 million) has been 
spent, then you know something 
strange has happened,” he says. 
His unit’s success depends on 
three things, he says. First, its close 
working partnership with other gov-
ernment agencies and the South 
African police. Second, its open 
door policy that welcomes anyone

econcerned about their compliance 


with water regulations to come in 
and talk to the unit. The third, how-
ever, is a zero-tolerance policy for 
those who refuse to comply with 
the law. “To those people, I am hard 
as steel,” Adams says. 
Adams and his team are likely to 
have their work cut out for them. 
Last year, South Africa dropped in 
the corruption index compiled by 
Transparency International to 54th 
place, down from 43rd place in 
2007. There is corruption on many 
levels in South Africa’s water sec-
tor, said a representative of a water 
NGO who refused to be named. 
Some of the most common forms 
of dodgy dealings are fast-tracking 
procurement contracts and giving 
consultancy jobs to pals, she said. 
South Africa has many ‘risk fac-
tors’ that make it susceptible to 
water corruption. It is a dry country, 
with some regions facing critical 
water shortages. Urbanisation and 
industrial growth are putting pres-
sure on the water supply. In addi-
tion, the country’s Institution for 
Civil Engineering 2006 infrastruc-
ture report card identified the need 
for extensive refurbishment of the 
country’s dams and sewage sys-
tems, meaning more tenders, which 
can be corruption-prone. 
Still, South Africa is tackling cor-
ruption more successfully than 
most of its poorer neighbours on 
the continent. The poor gover-
nance structure and large funding 
flows that characterise the water 
sector in the rest of Africa provide 
fertile growing grounds for abuse, 
according to the 2008 Global 
Corruption Report. The report es-
timates that due to corruption, the 
cost for reaching the Millennium 
Goal on drinking water and sanita-
tion in developing countries could 
increase by as much as with US$48 
billion over the next decade. 
Such money-loss will have a direct 
effect on all Africans. Consumers 
will pay more and water quality will 
deteriorate (when pollution is over-
looked in exchange for a bribe, for 
example). Meanwhile, restricted ac-
cess, lower economic growth (be-
cause companies need water) and 
water shortages could spark unrest, 
damaging national security.
A range of actions
But few studies investigate the 
situation on the ground, says Piers 
Cross, a consultant who is investi-
gating water corruption in drought-
stricken Ethiopia for the World 
Bank. Ethiopia is currently investing 
heavily in water infrastructure, such 
as dams and bringing water to rural 
areas. 
With a large number of contracts 
being offered to improve access to 
clean water across Ethiopia, there 
are question-marks both over how 
contracts are being handled, both 
for large infrastructure projects and 
smaller-scale borehole drilling, says 
Cross. He’s going to Ethiopia in 
April to take photos of new equip-
ment. “We’ll try to compare if what 
is built equals what is being paid 
for,” he says. 
Some countries are addressing the 
problem. In Zambia, following the 
re-organisation of the water sector 
to allow more local control, commu-
(•••)
nity-based Water Watch Groups 
were set up to monitor water pro-
viders’ performance. The onus is on 
communities learning about their 
rights and raising awareness of in-
fringements. A 2008 study by S. 
Kayaga and R. Franceys, two UK 
academics, found that NWASCO, 
the Zambian regulator, had made 
“commendable progress” towards 
better accountability and transpar-
ency in the water sector. 
Due to the relatively short time 
water corruption has been in the 
spotlight, there is little information 
on what interventions work, says 
John Butterworth from the Interna-
tional Water and Sanitation Centre. 
“What has been shown is that a 
quick fix just pushes the corruption 
into a different area. If you sort out 
a particular aspect of your procure-
ment, the people who were engaged 
in corrupt practices will just shift to 
another part of the process. It needs 
a whole range of actions.” 
Something that seems to work is to 
raise the awareness of communities 
of the problem and how it affects 
them, he adds. “It’s called social ac-
countability. Involving communities in 
looking at the quality of construction, 
making sure all material is delivered, 
that sort of thing.” 
Nor is the problem unique to 
Africa. Water corruption by cartels 
in South Asia inflated prices be-
tween 15 and 20% between 2001 
and 2002, according to a survey. 
Recent member countries of the 
EU, such as Romania and Bulgaria, 
are, for example, ranking lower on 
Transparency International’s corrup-
tion perception index as compared 
to some African or Asian countries, 
says Håkan Tropp, chairman of the 
Water Integrity Network, set up in 
2006 to improve transparency and 
governance in the global water sec-
tor. “So it is also problem we in de-
veloped countries have to deal with 
in our own back yard.”

have gone through so that we can 
drink from a tap today. 
The idea behind the journey was 
also to translate the relationships 
between man and water into imag-
es. In the West we have lost sight of 
the importance of this vital resource. 
It’s there in abundance; even hot 
water comes out of a tap. And, 
worse still, we use drinking water 
to flush our toilets. Most people on 
the planet find this incomprehen-
sible. In China, for example, water 
is so precious they see the Yangtze 
as a source of nourishment, like a 
mother.
So there is a direct link between 
water and development?
g: Absolutely. Because of their geo-
graphical isolation, people living high 
up on the Tibetan plateau are, in a 
way, condemned to underdevelop-
ment. Of course, the new railway 
that opened in 2006 will help Tibet 
become less cut off, but, for the

Why did you choose  
development as the theme  
of your ‘Yangtze Expedition’? 
geoffroy: Travelling down the 
Yangtze is like travelling through time. 
High up on the Tibetan plateau, there 
are still people who have to walk 
for three hours a day to fetch wa-
ter. It’s like the Stone Age. If you 
travel downstream for a while, it’s 
the industrial era, with big cities that 
are beginning to control the water. 
And, in Shanghai, at the mouth of 
the same river, there is round-the-
clock running water. It’s the modern 
world. 
We wanted our documentary to 
show the link between access to 
water and level of development. We 
very quickly realised that China was 
the ideal place for this, because 
of the extraordinary diversity in the 
ways water figures in the lives of its 
people. 
loïc: Through this expedition we 
were able to rediscover our own 
history. It was important to trace the

time being, there is nothing modern 
about life there. One Tibetan stu-
dent who went back to her home vil-
lage, Qmar He, in the holidays, told 
us she spent most of her free time 
fetching water. In the city, she uses 
this time for reading and leisure. 
A little further down river, we saw 
a water mill, which is already a sign 
of development. But it took a long 
time before this kind of technology, 
albeit simple, was available. An-
other 1000 km further down river, 
we came across the famous Three 
Gorges dam. It is also a water mill, 
but much bigger. It was completed 
in 2009 and is the end result of a 
gigantic construction project that 
lasted 15 years. Still further down, 
we came across a paradox that is 
characteristic of all developed soci-
eties: we want clean water to drink 
yet still want to be able to use it to 
dump all of our rubbish! We finally 
arrived in Shanghai, where we found

have drinking water, you have to 
treat your wastewater. 
As we travelled down the Yang-
tze, we witnessed a whole series 
of stages in human development, 
marked by access to water, master-
ing it, making it secure, and manag-
ing it over the long term.
You were able to see the 
world’s largest dam, the Three 
Gorges. It made navigation on 
the river possible, and there-
fore brought development. But 
it is also causing some serious 
environmental problems.
g: This dam has really turned the 
Yangtze into a growth highway, link-
ing the developed East with the un-
derdeveloped West. Since the river 
has been navigable, the port city of 
Chongqing, which is upstream of 
the dam, has been mushrooming: a 
thousand people settle there each 
day! It now has a population of over 
32 million. 
l: Having said that, most of its 
wastewater still goes directly into 
the Yangtze. This polluted water 
then reaches the dam, where it 
stagnates, loses all of its oxygen 
and undergoes eutrophisation. In 
some places on the river, the layer 
of algae is 30 cm thick. 
If the Yangtze dies, so will the 
600 million people who live in the 
river basin - 10% of the planet’s 
population. If the Chinese do not 
act quickly, they will turn the Three 
Gorges reservoir into an enormous 
cesspit, an open-air sewage dump. 
And everyone knows this. If noth-
ing is done, the treatment that the 
Chinese will have to apply to make 
the Yangtze water drinkable will be 
a lot more complicated than it is to-
day, and may even be impossible. In 
China, surface water is still the main 
source of drinking water, not un-
derground water, which is practi-
cally untapped. 
What about the Yangtze river’s 
biodiversity?

It is estimated that for every US$ 1 invested in improved water supply 
and sanitation there will be gains of from US$ 3-34.
The overall economic loss in Africa alone due to lack of access to safe 
water and basic sanitation is estimated to be some US$ 28.4 billion per year 
or around 5% of GDP (WHO, 2006). 
A study in the MENA region noted that groundwater resource depletion 
appears to have reduced the GDP of certain nations (Jordan by 2.1%, 
Yemen 1.5%, Egypt 1.3% and Tunisia 1.2%) 
In China, there is local evidence that action on water management 
has delivered measurable improvements in local GDP terms. The 335 
counties in China with completed primary electrification from hydropower 
showed a doubling of GDP compared with those without rural electricity. 
Annual average income per farmer increased by 8.1% per year, nearly 3%

fishing led to the extinction of the 
Yangtze dolphin. The disappearance 
of this symbolic species caused 
quite a reaction, but there are still 
a great many other threatened spe-
cies that we don’t hear about. Like 
the Yangtze finless porpoise, which 
is also endemic to the river. 
The extinction of the dolphin is an 
alarm signal. Even if we talk about 
the overpopulation of the planet, we 
might wonder if the next mammal to 
become extinct won’t be man. Every 
year nearly three million people in 
developing countries die of water-

a child dies of diarrhoea. So we 
might say the process has already

### 186120: Australia's water revolution

Australia’s newly-created Murray-
Darling Basin Authority is about 
to embark on a world-first venture. 
Chief Executive, Rob Freeman, is 
charged with putting together a plan 
covering the basin, which is the size 
of France. “It has never been done 
in the world at this scale,” he said. 
“No-one has tried to return a sys-
tem that is over-allocated [back to 
sustainability].” 
Mr Freeman said the over-alloca-
tion is “a legacy of the past, com-
pounded by the early onset of cli-
mate change and on top of that we 
have one of the worst droughts on 
record”. 
The legacy is the issuing of water 
licences for over 5000 gigalitres 
(billion litres) a year, in wetter times. 
The Murray River historically had an 
annual inflow of 8900 GL a year. 
But drought struck seven years 
ago; in the last three years the 
annual inflow has averaged just 
1783 GL. 
The basin is highly vulnerable to 
climate change, because just four 
percent of the rain that falls on the 
basin ends up in the river (com-
pared with 39% in Europe and 
52% in North America). If the tem-
perature rises one degree — and 
this has been happening under 
climate change — 15% less water 
flows into the river. 
Before the drought struck, the 
Murray-Darling Basin supported 
40% of the country’s farm produce, 
including most of its irrigated agri-
culture, worth $A15 billion. 
Its waters support over two million 
people, including Australia’s fifth big- 
gest city, Adelaide, but in the last 
three years they have endured se-
vere water restrictions. In Adelaide, 
for example, gardens can only be 
watered with hand-held hoses for a 
maximum of three hours a week. 
Irrigation allocations have been 
slashed. Along the river, grape 
vines and citrus trees have been 
bulldozed. Wetlands are drying out, 
and huge old river red gums are dy-
ing. 
At the end of the river lie the lower 
lakes, separated from the ocean by 
man-made barrages. Those lakes 
are facing ecological catastrophe, 
according to South Australia’s 
Commissioner for Water Security, 
Robyn McLeod. As the lakes dry, 
their acid sulphate soils become 
dangerously acidic when they are 
                                    returning an over-allocated system to sustainability while combating 
           the harmful effects of climate change and drought – these are the challenges taken on 
     by the new murray-darling basin authority, founded in 2008. In seven years the annual inflow 
of one of australia’s largest river basins has dropped nearly 80%..
exposed to air. There is not enough 
fresh water in the Murray-Darling to 
keep the lake beds covered. Letting 
in salt water might halt the acidity, 
but, Ms McLeod said “they will be-
come hypersaline very quickly and 
it will be a dead sea.”
Measures called for
Adelaide takes up to 90% of its 
drinking water from the Murray, 
but it is developing other sour- 
ces. It recycles 30% of its water, 
and is aiming for 45% by 2010. 
New housing estates have two 
sources of water; purified water 
is used in the kitchen for drinking, 
while recycled water, delivered 
through distinctive purple pipes, 
is used for toilet flushing, washing 
clothes and watering gardens. 
Adelaide is also building a desal-
ination plant that will provide one 
quarter of its needs by 2011. 
Arguments over the water of the 
Murray River, which is shared by 
New South Wales, Victoria and 
South Australia, nearly halted 
Federation, which occurred in 
1901. The States retained con-
trol over water, and the arguments

Murray-Darling Basin Authority. 
Before, states were powerless 
to do anything about other states 
that breached the limits set for 
water extraction. South Australia, 
for instance, suffered fluctuations 
in its water supply because New 
South Wales was taking more than 
its share upstream and limiting the 
amount of water flowing down-
stream to South Australia. 
The new Authority will have the 
 power of enforcement, notably to 
issue injunctions to stop overdraw-
ing of water. It will need it, because 
irrigation allocations are certain to 
be reduced. 
Mr Freeman said the “new sustain-
able diversion limits will be based on 
how much water we need to retain 
to preserve key environmental as-
sets and key ecosystem functions. 
The limits will be based on how much 
water we need scientifically, not how 
much we traditionally extracted.” 
It will be a huge revolution in water 
use, and the world will be watching 
how Australia does it. 
Åsa Wahlquist, 
Australian journalist 
Murray-Darling Basin continued. 
In 1991 it was clear the rivers 
were stressed when a one thou-
sand kilometre long, stinking, lu-
rid blue-green algal bloom infest-
ed the Darling River. 
In 1994 the Council of Austra-
lian Governments, comprising 
ministers from the State Govern-
ments and the Federal Govern-
ment, agreed on a new water 
policy. The health of the river had 
to be factored into all water de-
cisions; water subsidies had to 
end and water licences had to 
be separated from land so they 
could be freely traded in a new 
water market. 
Mike Young is Executive Direc-
tor of the Environment Institute 
at the University of Adelaide. He 
argues that policy made Australia a 
world leader. “I am now spending 
quite a bit of time around the world 
advising people on how to get to a 
system which has the best of the 
Australian bits and pieces in it.” 
Central to the Australian system 
are clearly defined, tradeable shares 
in the available water supply. Profes-
sor Young said this “took us down 
a pathway looking at competition

as a way to solve problems and to 
facilitate and expedite change. That 
has been a very powerful driver of 
reform that they haven’t had in other 
parts of the world.” 
As the value of water has risen, 
farmers have moved from wasteful 
open channels and huge overhead 
sprays to computer-controlled drip 
irrigation. Water has been traded 
from low value-uses like flooding 
paddocks for cattle feed, to high-
value fruit, grape and vegetable 
growing.
Australia  
on the cutting edge
But in 2006, as the severe drought 
gripped the Murray Darling, it was 
clear more changes were needed. 
In 2007 the Federal Government 
offered a radical plan: if the states 
would sign over responsibility for 
the water in the Basin to the Federal 
Government, it would spend $A10 
billion buying back over-allocated 
water licences and upgrading ir-
rigation infrastructure. It took 15 
months before the states agreed. 
In December 2008, a new era in

### 186121: Water in a changing world

What’s new since the last 
report, published three years 
ago? Is it possible to outline 
the latest developments? 
What has happened over the last 
three years in terms of the more ma-
jor problems is that we have recorded 
considerable progress in some ar-
eas and met frustration in others. 
Safe drinking water, for instance 
— as a result of the ambitious cam-
paign championed by the UN and 
agreed to by the international com-
munity, the Millennium Develop-
ment Goals target seems likely to 
be met. Unfortunately Sub-Saharan 
Africa is a huge regional exception, 
embedded in food or other com-
modities needed in production. 
This becomes important vis-à-vis 
economic growth, when in emerg-
ing economies, people start eating 
more meat rather than, say, grains 
or rice, or start eating three instead 
of two meals; it means a lot more 
water to produce the food. Also to 
manufacture the cars they want to

drive and other consumer products 
demanded. On top of this you have 
to add the pollution that comes from 
a lot of these activities. That is another 
driver. It influences water resources. 
[…] 
Another message of the report is 
that water problems are created 
and potentially solved by decision 
makers that are not the actual wa-
ter managers. When I talk about 
leaders, I am talking in a broader 
sense, not leaders in the water 
sector. The past two reports and 
the processes have provided a 
good consensus among water re-
sources professionals and leader-
ship in the water community. But 
now we need to get out of the wa-
ter box and get the broader frame-
work involved in the identification 
and solution of water problems 
and preventing further water crisis.
The report encourages more 
investment in water?
The report has a complete section 
on the investment aspect. Obvious-
ly the current crisis will have impact 
on water. What we are saying is 
that water infrastructure is not to be 
neglected and that investment in 
water infrastructure is to be accele- 
rated. 
We are saying that, in order to deal 
with the current crisis, water infra-
structure and governance are more 
important than ever. Investing in wa-
ter provides benefits not only to the 
society but to the economy. 
Does the report make  
recommendations for averting 
a water crisis? 
This is not a prescriptive report. There 
are water crises around the world, 
but hydrology is local, meteorology is 
global. We have now water crises 
around the world but we are not 
talking about a global water crisis. 
We are warning against one if the 
existing crises are not addressed 
properly and if water is not made an 
integral component of broader deci-
sion making frameworks. An excel-
lent example is the food sector. You 
may want to increase production, 
but if you don’t have the resources 
– irrigation water – you have a con-
straint. You cannot only resolve the 
food crisis - you create pressure on 
water resources that could turn into 
crisis.
With increasing water scarcity, 
water becomes increasingly  
a political issue. Does the  
report address this aspect?
It’s a fact, when you have abun-
dant resources, everybody is 
happy. When demand increases 
or the resource decreases, then 
you start seeing competition, then 
you start managing the demand in 
many ways. It can be economic, so-
cial, legal or a combination. As the 
(•••)
water in a changing world
situation worsens, you may have to 
reallocate water from some sectors 
to others, and competition can turn 
into conflict. Managing the compe-
tition is very important so that con-
flict will not arise. There are plenty of 
examples of the report on how na-
tions or river basins or municipali-
ties have dealt with these issues. 
There are statistics and examples 
of conflicts as well. Again, there 
are general recommendations. The 
report avoids sweeping generaliza-
tions and indicates at the beginning 
that, like water problems, solutions 
depend on circumstances in the 
country or society – resource en-
dowment, financial resources, cul-
ture, legal framework. Each country 
should look for their own solutions, 
using what can be learned from 
others who have successfully dealt 
with them.  
With the current crisis, “water infrastructures and governance are more important than ever.”

Younger males, called black-

will then mate with the female 
whose child they killed. 
Gorillas only breed every three

West Africa in the 5th century B.C.

In the absence of visual evi-

impossible to tell whether goril-

not always available, but modern 
science divides them into two 
species - Eastern and Western

Each subspecies has feeding,

last two decades due to death from hunting and disease, 
notably Ebola. Population was estimated at 100,000 in 
the 1980s, but populations which had not been count-
ed before were discovered in remote swamp forests in 
the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
bringing total estimates up to 150,000 - 200,000 mainly 
in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Con-
go, and Equatorial Guinea. The subspecies is the small-
est and lightest of the four subspecies. 
The cross river gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is a 
recently recognized subspecies of Western Gorilla liv-
ing in tropical and subtropical broadleaf forests at el-
evations of 200 to 2000 metres on the northern Cam-
eroon-Nigerian border in an area of less than 10,000 
km². They are found in eleven localities most of them 
connected by continuous forest. The subspecies, total-
ling a mere 300 individuals, is critically endangered. It is 
particularly shy of humans and only few direct sightings 
have been made. Most information on their ecology and 
behaviour derives from observations of sleeping nests, 
feeding trails and reports by local hunters. The main 
morphological difference between the Cross River 
Gorilla and the Western Lowland Gorilla concerns the 
shape of their heads.
The high forest mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei 
beringei) is believed to total only 650 to 680 individu-
als, living in two isolated groups within protected areas 
in the Virunga Massif along the borders of the DRC, 
Rwanda, and Uganda, in the Virunga National Park 
(DRC), the Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda) and the 
Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (Uganda). A separate 
population of Mountain Gorillas is found in the Bwindi 
Impenetrable National Park in southwest Uganda. A 
2003 census of the Virunga Volcanoes Mountain Go-
rilla population showed a 17% increase since 1989. 
But the subspecies remains critically endangered due 
to habitat loss, poaching, human disease and war. It is 
very black and densely furred, with a broad face and 
massive jaws. The small of the back of mature males 
turns grey with age, hence the name of ‘silverback’ for 
mature males. 
eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei grau-
eri) have been severely affected by instability and war 
in much of its natural habitat since the 1990s. An in-
crease in hunting of Eastern Lowland gorillas has been 
observed in war-torn eastern DRC, and their habitat is 
under stress due to mining for coltan ore, agriculture 
and charcoal production. Anecdotal evidence sug-
gests a significant decline over the past 20-30 years. 
In the mid-1990s, population was estimated at 17,000. 
The Eastern Gorilla tends to be larger than the West-
ern, with longer, blacker hair. 
r. a.
modern science  
divides gorillas into two species  
- eastern and western gorillas -  
and four subspecies:  
western lowland gorillas,  
cross river gorillas, mountain gorillas  
and eastern lowland gorillas.

of space, which is why UNESCO 
favours the definition of large land-
scapes for their preservation, ar-
eas that include a wide buffer zone 
with biosphere reserves where peo-
ple can find sustainable livelihoods. 
Education projects to help the in-
habitants understand, respect and 
maximize the benefits of sustainable 
resource management are essential 
for the success of these preserva-
tion projects.
All species  
are important
Mambaele Mankoto of UNESCO’s 
Natural Science Sector is heartened 
by the recent increase observed in 
gorilla populations in the Virunga 
National Park, a UNESCO World 
Heritage site. This improvement 
can be attributed to ambitious pro-
grammes for conservation of biodi-
versity in regions of armed conflict 
launched by UNESCO in 2000 
with the United Nations Foundation 
and the European Union. The proj-
ects have focused heavily on help-
ing forest guards carry out their all-
important work. “But conflicts are 
still latent and we must not lower 
our guard,” cautions Mankoto, who 
highlights the need to convince 
donors to provide funds for proj-
ects that specifically target gorilla 
preservation. 
One way to reduce hunting for 
bushmeat and traditional medicine 
is to convince local populations 
that gorillas are worth more alive 
than dead. Conservation institu-
tions in the RDC and the Rwandan 
National Parks Office have con-
cluded an accord whereby gorillas 
that come from RDC to Rwanda 
are visited by tourists there and 
Rwanda pays a share of the profit, 
US$ 30,000 per annum on aver-
age, back to the RDC. Mankoto 
welcomes this as a fine example of 
transboundary cooperation within 
UNESCO’s mandate of peace-
building with the gorillas as am-
bassadors. 
Nevertheless, gorilla tourism must 
be managed with care, as contact 
with humans can have a negative 
impact on these great apes whose 
immune systems are unprepared 
for some of the diseases we carry. 
Humans also continue killing goril-
las not just for bushmeat but also 
for cultural reasons. While some 
people still believe that placing a 
gorilla bone in a baby’s bathwa-
ter will fortify the child, the major 
threats facing our closest animal 
cousins remain deforestation, 
road-building, traps laid for other 
animals and mining. 
Mankoto for his part hopes that 
the International Year of the Gorilla - 
launched by the United Nations En-
vironment  Programme’s Conven-
tion on Migratory Species (CMS), 
the UNEP/UNESCO Great Apes 
Survival Partnership (GRASP) and 
the World Association of Zoos and 
Aquariums (WAZA) - will serve as 
a plea for this animal which, in cap-
tivity, has proven it can acquire an 
impressive mastery of human sign 
language. 
In their natural habitat, gorillas 
provide valuable services in forest 
husbandry as they make clearings 
along their migratory path, allowing 
the sun to reach the underbrush, 
and digest seeds of species which 
they disseminate in their faeces. 
Mankoto reminds us of the need to 
resist anthropocentrism: “All spe-
cies are important; the loss of any 
species represents an impoverish-
ment of the environment — physical, 
cultural and spiritual.”

protecting gorillaS  
BeginS with education
like elephants, gorillas are migratory 
species that need wide areas.  
conserving such species is not about 
fencing large areas but about teaching 
populations to contribute  
to conservation through good  
territorial management policies.  
This requires educating  
the young and uneSco  
has not waited for the International 
Year of the gorilla to start this work.

### 186122: Saving our nearest relatives

The main axes for UNESCO’s  
activities in favour of the gorilla are 
its World Heritage Centre and the 
Man and the Biosphere (MAB)  
Programme. But education projects 
have also contributed to these  
programmes, particularly now, during 
the Decade for Education for  
Sustainable Development. 
UNESCO recently granted US  
$100,000 for GRASP scholarships  
for young researchers who spent  
two years studying issues pertaining  
to great apes. 
The Regional School on Integrated 
Management of Tropical Forests and 
Territories (ERAIFT) [Ecole Regionale 
post-universitaire d’ Amenagements 
et gestions Intégrés des Forets et 
Territories tropicaux] was created by 
UNESCO ten years ago at Kinshasa 
University with support from the RDC, 
the United Nations Development  
Programme, the European Union 
which has just announced a four 
million-Euro allocation within the 
framework of the 10th European  
Development Fund (2009-2013),  
Belgium, France and several partners 
such as the World Wide Fund for 
Nature (WWF). The school brings 
together young postgraduates  
specializing in human and  
social sciences with geographers,  
sociologists and economists along 
with agronomists, forest managers,  
biologists, and ecologists.  
They follow an 18-month Masters 
programme which includes six months 
of fieldwork. This allows for  
cross-disciplinary training, favouring  
a multidisciplinary grasp of issues 
which can help open the  
students’ eyes to new approaches.  
Eighty-one masters from 12 African 
countries have been trained to date 
along with three PhDs.  
A further 60 people will hopefully  
be trained by 2013.

Monuments of Nubia, 
past and future
In 1959, the governments of Egypt 
and Sudan asked UNESCO for 
assistance in safeguarding monu-
ments that the construction of the 
Aswan High Dam threatened to sub-
merge. This inspired a major cam-
paign by UNESCO to safeguard 
cultural heritage. The success of the 
Campaign inspired the development 
and adoption in 1972 of UNES-
CO’s World Heritage Conven-
tion and the inscription of sites on 
UNESCO’s World Heritage List on 
which the Nubian Monuments from 
Abu Simbel to Philae were inscribed 
in 1979.  To mark the 50th anniver-
sary of the appeal to save the monu-
ments of Nubia, UNESCO’s office 
in Cairo organized a conference in 
cooperation with the Egyptian and 
Sudanese ministries of culture.

Confronting Climate Change in the Arctic  
The rapidly changing climate in the Arctic is putting pressure on hundreds of thousands of indigenous 
people in the circumpolar North.  
In March 2009, UNESCO organized a conference in Monaco to address the concerns of the Arctic 
community and identify strategies for the sustainable development of the region.
Education for Sustainable Development 
The UNESCO World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will be held from 31 March  
to 2 April in Bonn (Germany). The event brings together some 700 experts and stakeholders. Graça Machel,  
international advocate for women’s and children’s rights and former Minister of Education and Culture  
in Mozambique, will present a keynote speech. 
The conference will underline the relevance of ESD to all of education; promote international exchange on ESD, 
especially between North and South; assess results of the United Nations ESD Decade (2005-2014); and  
develop strategies for the future.
