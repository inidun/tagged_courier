Twin-headed deity
Found in 1970 during excavation of the Roman quarter of the
city of Fréjus in the Var department, France, this twin-
headed, hellenic-style bust measure 38 centimetres in height
and dates from around the 2nd century AD. The face seen in
profile to the left is a representation of Pan, god of She¬
pherds and flocks, while the right-facing profile is that of
Hermes, herald and messenger of the gods and inventor of
the lyre. The bust was probably imported into Fréjus to
adorn a public building or the garden of a villa.

school and university programmes in many
countries. Now a related field of studies,
disarmament education, is beginning to
emerge in its own right. The present issue of the
Unesco Courier examines this relative
new-comer to the classroom, its Implications
and the challenge it presents to those
engaged in education and communication.

Since wars begin
in the minds of men,
it is in the minds of men
that the defences
ofpeace
must be constructed
(Preamble to the Constitution of Unesco)
IN April 1979, the Unesco Courier devoted an entire issue
to a United Nations report on "the economic and social
consequences of the arms race and of military expendi¬
tures". In that issue we showed that, far from slowing
down, the arms race is gathering momentum and is swal¬
lowing up on a vast scale resources (today nearly a million
dollars are spent every minute of every day on armaments)
that are urgently needed for development.
This state of affairs is fraught with the most terrible
danger to human life, indeed, to the very survival of the
human species. Although since 1945 world war has been
avoided, for how many days over the past thirty-five years
have the guns really been silent? The axis of conflict, which
still involves the industrial powers, has shifted towards the
poorer countries where men, women and children continue
to die as a result of war.
International action is urgently needed and Unesco's role
is clearly defined in its Constitution which assigns it the task
"of advancing, through the educational, scientific and cul¬
tural relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of
international peace and of the common welfare of mankind
for which the United Nations Organization was established
and which its Charter proclaims".
Since its inception, therefore, Unesco has been striving to
create a climate of world opinion, especially among the
younger generation, in favour of disarmament through the
twin channels of information and education. Yet the term
"disarmament education", although it covers part of well-
established domains such as peace education, world order
studies and education for international understanding, is a
new expression which was first officially used at a meeting
of experts convened by Unesco in April 1978 on Obstacles to
Disarmament and Ways of Overcoming Them.
The experts defined the purpose of disarmament educa¬
tion as being to promote the goal of general and complete
disarmament; this would involve, they stated, bringing up
youth in a social climate favourable to this goal (education
for disarmament) and training and instruction regarding the
various historical, political, economic and other aspects of
the problem of disarmament in international relations and
domestic policy (education about disarmament). They also
recommended the holding of a world congress with the task
of proposing measures aimed at the establishment of spe¬
cialized education in favour of disarmament. This proposal
was put before the Tenth Special Session of the United
Nations General Assembly, in May 1978, by Unesco Director-
General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, and received the
Assembly's whole-hearted support.
The World Congress on Disarmament Education was sub¬
sequently held at Unesco headquarters In Paris In June this
year and was attended by some 250 participants and obser¬
vers from all over the world. Its findings are largely reflected
in this issue of the Unesco Courier.

Education, disarmament

by Judith Torney
and Leonard Gambrell P
// ^^^EACE cannot be kept by force.
It can only be achieved by
understanding". These words
of Albert Einstein sum up succinctly the
common point of departure of all those who
believe that peace can be taught and that
the vital first steps are education concerning
disarmament and teaching about human
rights.
But although their objective is the same,
educational experts and writers have devel¬
oped two* distinct but complementary ap¬
proaches to education for disarmament
which are based on somewhat differing
assumptions and rely on different strategies
for attaining their ends.
In the first of these approaches, arms I

### 41128: Education, disarmament and human rights

races are seen as resulting from political
systems which are malfunctioning and
which can be improved through structural
reform of society. This may involve a basic
rearrangement of the nation-state system
and some of its proponents suggest that
world government is an essential part of the
solution to arms races.
The educational programme implicit
within this approach is the study of the
growth and physical characteristics of
nuclear weapons and of the negative
economic consequences of arms races the
percentage of national resources locked in
by arms production and alternative use of
these resources for economic development.
The risks of nuclear war and the physical
danger of nuclear weapons are stressed. A
wealth of facts is often provided by those
who take the structural approach. This may
be useful in developing awareness of
choices and priorities, but only when
governments demonstrate willingness to
share data with their citizens concerning
types of armaments and their economic
impact.
Some materials used in this approach
repeat the information that each human be¬
ing on earth could be killed many times over
by existing stockpiles of weapons. Certainly
this is true. But this kind of information is
likely to produce a high level of fear and anx¬
iety in people. A common response to such
emotions is to divert attention from the
problem in the hope that it will disappear.
This is especially true because individuals
have little chance directly or immediately to
influence the arms race.
Materials which suggest changes in
economic priorities by the redirection of na¬
tional resources are also hard for individuals
to understand fully. The economic system is
very complex, and citizens want very con¬
vincing assurance that their own well-being
will not take a turn for the worse if economic
priorities change. In periods of inflation or
economic instability, there may be especial¬
ly strong resistance to such changes.
Sometimes this kind of approach also
relies on exhortations labelling disarma¬
ment as moral and armament as immoral.
The proposal of a world government which
will abolish armaments meets with great
scepticism in many nations. Beliefs about
political morality as well as patriotic beliefs
are so deeply held by most people that they
are unlikely to be changed by slogans or
exhortation.
Though the model that stresses structural
problems gives some attention to the fact
that more weapons do not necessarily give
one more security, this is not always suffi¬
ciently emphasized. Unless a link is made
with positive alternative approaches by
which nations can understand each other
better and conflict can be resolved without
resort to increased armaments, it is not likely
that steps will be taken to reduce or control
the growth of arms.
The public may be aware that high levels
of armament increase the chances for war.
However, in the absence of alternative ways
of reacting to threats to security, both policy
makers and the general public are likely to
accept increasing armaments. They see no
other way to eliminate the threats against
which arms are intended to protect. This ap¬
proach is very useful, however, in pointing
to multilateral approaches through organiza
tions like the United Nations and Unesco
and to the interdependent roles of govern¬
mental, inter-governmental, and non¬
governmental organizations in promoting
disarmament.
The second of the two approaches to
disarmament education focuses major atten¬
tion on the behaviour of actors involved in
the arms race (including both policy makers
and the public) and on ways to influence
their behaviour. Concern for structural
reform is less important. Though pro¬
ponents of this approach sometimes make
use of data on arms expenditures and ex¬
press the belief that there is a need for an
alternative use of resources, they devote
more effort to a critical analysis of ap¬
proaches to national security and percep¬
tions of it.
The type of disarmament education pro¬
posed in this model begins with a critical
analysis of defence theories and military
doctrines or policies. Narrow perceptions of
national security are seen as the source of
the problem. More armaments do not
necessarily mean greater security this is
the major message. There must be an
analysis of other ways in which national
security could realistically be guaranteed.
The "logic" of nuclear deterrence may be
examined in this model; the economic im¬
pact of arms development, manufacture,

## [Page 7](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/074642engo.pdf#page=7) 0

### 41128: Education, disarmament and human rights

and sales may be analysed along with the
estimated costs of conversion from military
to non-military production.
This model also requires that the public
have access to information about the arms
expenditures of their own and other nations,
the relation of these expenditures to
legitimate defence, and the trade-offs bet¬
ween increasing arms and meeting basic
social needs. It requires that citizens be able
to obtain information about armaments
from unofficial as well as government
sources, that they have the opportunity to
participate in discussions of processes of
disarmament and goals of national security,
and that policy makers take their views
seriously. Free access to information on
these issues results in a climate for real
disarmament education.
When the connexion between national
security and the arms races is neglected,
discussions about disarmament frequently
break down into arguments which place
blame on other nations rather than exploring
alternative solutions. It is essential to
understand why people and governments
rely on arms and a military approach rather
than simply to denounce them. Teaching in¬
dividuals to examine assumptions regard¬
ing national security will give them a strong
basis of information for judging future
events. This behavioural approach, which
emphasizes the relation between education
for disarmament and teaching about human
rights, is promising for both formal and in¬
formal education beginning with youth
and extending throughout the life span.
Among the most basic rights defined in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
are those related to life and security of the
person. Article 28 proclaims, "Everyone is
entitled to a social and international order in
which the rights and freedoms set forth in
this Declaration can be fully realized".
This notion has been strongly stressed in
Unesco's Medium Term Plan which
declares:
"The assurance of human rights and the
construction of peace are tasks that go
hand-in-hand, no doubt because any war
irremediably compromises the exercise
of rights of all kinds, while denial of rights,
in itself, inevitably ends by engendering
violence; and because a peace based on
inequality, domination, and exploitation,
even if it could be maintained by com¬
pulsion, would be peace in name only".
It is clear that a climate of public opinion
favouring reductions in armaments is one
important component of the process of
assuring stable peace, and that respect for
human rights is equally important.
One may even contrast what might be
called a negative spiral of events relating to
national security with a positive spiral of
such events. Military approaches to main¬
taining regimes in power and ensuring com¬
pliance from the population characterize
many countries of the world. Positive mo¬
tives may underlie the takeover of a govern¬
ment by the military (for example guiding a
country through a stormy period with other
nations). Within a short time, however, the
military regime comes to be seen as an end
in itself. The population nearly always finds
itself ruled in an atmosphere of coercion and
fear.
Use of national security as a justification
for the deprivation of basic human rights in¬
itiates a negative spiral of events. The argu¬
ment is made by those in power that na¬
tional security requires the absence of dis¬
sent. Those who do dissent are punished,
often in disregard of internationally agreed
standards. In the spiralling climate of fear
which results, it becomes impossible to ex¬
amine the role which military power is play¬
ing in the nation's life. And this mentality
also has an impact upon the country's inter¬
national relations. It is not only that ar¬
maments are built up in a physical sense; it
is also that psychological reliance upon
coercion and threat internally builds a lack of
trust in matters requiring international co¬
operation (which is especially important for
disarmament).
In fact, serious international problems ex¬
ist in promoting disarmament in countries
where human rights are not respected. A
government which is not subject to popular
control is not likely to accept international
controls. It may oppose international inspec¬
tion because it fears that its human rights
violations might be exposed or that its
population might complain to outsiders.
Other governments are reluctant to trust a
government which maintains itself by force
and by violating human rights. This limits
the disarmament agreements which are
possible with such a government. Initiatives
which show the willingness of a government

Posters are a highly effective
instrument for alerting public opinion
to the issues involved in disarmament
education and in the struggle for peace
and human rights. In the three posters,
below, children are used to get the
message across. Two of them
constitute a direct indictment of war.
"The Child and the Aircraft" (1937)
denounces the bombing of civilians,
which leaves children as corpses
labelled with identification numbers.
The text on the chest of the "Tattooed
Baby" (1970), "Bless those who declare
war. They're usually too old to fight
and die", is a condemnation of those
who sacrifice the lives of the young to
the interests of a minority. The third,
used in an election campaign in 1977,
has a civic message: the boy's
admonitory gesture and the text,
"Think of the Year 2000", are designed
to remind adults of their responsibility
for the future of their country and its
children.
to comply with its human rights obligations
will not only create an enhanced sense of
trust on the part of citizens in that country
but will allow a constructive exploration of
alternative means for maintaining national
security. This can set the stage for a gradual
reduction of arms, which can build further
trust.
The negative spiral of events, where
power is maintained through coercive
threat, may be contrasted with national
security which is based on trust by the
population that the government will respect
basic civil and political rights and will work
toward the achievement of social,
economic, and cultural rights.
Many psychological theorists such as Erik
Erikson speak of trust as an essential ele¬
ment in human psychological development.
A variety of studies of political socialization
conducted in many nations shows the ex¬
tent to Which young children express
positive attitudes and trust in personal
representatives of the political system.
Although adolescents may be somewhat
more cynical, the young person whose civic
education is built upon a fund of trust which
is based upon experience with respect for
citizens' rights has a strong base which is
seldom substantially eroded. In countries
where respect for human rights has resulted
in confidence in the government on the part
of citizens, perceptions of national security
can build on a foundation of psychological
power. This is much stronger than the foun¬
dation of coercive power.
The actions taken by governments are
part of the message about national security
which students receive quite apart from any
textbook or school lecture. Governments
can do a variety of things to demonstrate
movement toward a positive climate for
disarmament education: allowing individuals
free access to information from other na¬
tions, opening deliberations on military
policy to public view, demonstrating will¬
ingness to co-operate with international
human rights procedures, to name only a
few.

content and status of international human
rights instruments and procedures. At
various levels of education people can be
given experience in applying these universal¬
ly accepted human rights principles to the
analysis of specific current events. With
respect to these cases the following ques¬
tions might be asked: How does this event il¬
lustrate the respect or lack of respect for
human rights? Which human rights? What
concept of national security is illustrated?
How might this event have been handled so
that respect for human rights would have
been enhanced and reliance on military or
coercive power given less emphasis? What
information about this event would citizens
need in order to make informed judgements
about it?
At a somewhat more advanced level,
students might be asked to analyse the in¬
fluence which culture and ideology have on
perceptions of national security. Another
topic would be the role of armaments and
military ideology in the history of their own
and other nations. Questions such as the
following might be asked: To what extent
are the high points of the country's history
defined as battles won? When and in what
context might negotiations have resulted in
arms reduction? How might the history of
the protection of human rights in this nation
have been different if the government had
taken different approaches to national
security at various times in its history? In
what cases have improvements in the
respect for human rights by governments
resulted in a climate for lessened reliance on
force as a way of guaranteeing national
security?
It is also valuable for students to examine
public awareness of the issue of human
rights and disarmament. How much infor¬
mation is available on current or projected
economic priorities? On armaments? Can
the concerned citizen obtain answers to
questions about policies from governmental
and non-governmental sources? Can he or
she join with others to discuss issues of con¬
cern, explore alternatives, and make their
conclusions known to policy makers?
Each of- these topics can contribute to an
educational programme the aim of which is
to build support for approaches to national
security based on respect for human rights,
including freedom of information and
discussion. These approaches are central to
Unesco's mandate to build support for
disarmament and the reinforcement of
peace.
Judith Tomoy
and Leonard Gambrell
Within the last few years the international
community has seen movement in this
positive direction in many countries; impor¬
tant steps have been taken toward
establishing the climate in which disarma¬
ment education can take place. Young peo¬
ple in these countries now have an oppor¬
tunity to learn that there are legitimate
sources of social power which do not de¬
pend on coercion. They have thus
developed a cornerstone of trust on which a
positive view of national security can be
built.
In summary, respect for human rights on
the part of governments can build a climate
of trust within and between nations which
allows the exploration of non-military ap¬
proaches to security and can lead to the
negotiation of agreements regarding gradual
disarmament. A positive spiral of events will
then be created.
There are thus two parts to the core of
education concerning disarmament. An
analysis of alternatives to military power as
ways of guaranteeing national security is
central. Of equal importance is an analysis of
the way in which respect for human rights
by governments along with free access to in¬
formation can build a climate of trust within
and between nations so that aradual move¬
ment can be made toward disarmament.

### 41129: World opinion: the weapon to end all weapons

World opinion the weapon
to end all weapons
by
Liselotte Waldheim-Natural
THERE is today a-widespread feeling
that the arms race is made possible
in part by public attitudes belief
tnat wars are inevitable, long-nurtured tradi¬
tions associating military strength with
national security, fascination with the
machismo and magic of modern weaponry,
and a deep-seated apathy which these other
attitudes compound. Fortunately, this
apathy is not universal; where it exists it is
due not to indifference but to a lack of
understanding of the complex problems in¬
volved and of the power of public opinion to
influence events.
Learning about the problems of disarma
ment is not a simple matter. The average
person may find it difficult to imagine the
cataclysmic effects of a nuclear war, may
not grasp the technical complexities of
weapon systems or may not understand the
jargon and concepts involved in disputes
of the military theologians over strategic
doctrines.
Disarmament is not a topic that readily at¬
tracts public interest it is too complex, too
technical, too political. Take a popular sub¬
ject and we can generate a world campaign
which nearly everyone hears about (the In¬
ternational Year of the Child, for example)
but the effort to make the world a safer and
more hospitable place for our children
through disarmament has little appeal and
not enough followers.
Disarmament is a long-term objective. It is
a pursuit that will depend on the support of
all citizens of the world today and on
generations to come. But initially it involves
governments with whom lies responsibility
for reducing and eventually eliminating the
arsenals of the world. However, each
government operates within a climate of
public opinion which, to a greater or lesser
degree, places limits on the range of actions
open to it. The purpose of disarmament
education is to help create an informed
public opinion able and willing to propose,
encourage and support policies aimed at
achieving international security through
disarmament.
In dealing with disarmament education
we confront the question not only of the
best modes and methods of teaching but
the question of content. What is the infor¬
mation we want to convey, and where do
we get it?
Of course, it is not difficult to draw up a
list of subjects to be taught. Such topics
might include the status of arsenals and
military forces of the nations of the
world. ..the threat posed by nuclear
weapons. ..the nature and deployment of
nuclear systems... the relative balance of
forces between countries or alliances... the
cost of armaments and the military expen¬
ditures in each nation.. .the world arms trade
and its role in promoting the arms
race. ..trends in weapons-related research

and development.. .the costs of armaments
of each nation. ..the role in national policy¬
making of the military establishment, of
industry, of scientific and technological cir¬
cles, and of the public... the prospects of
redirecting military resources and facilities to

velopment... disarmament and the new in¬
ternational economic order... current arms

cluding those for a comprehensive nuclear
test ban and a ban on chemical weapons...and
of course the efforts of the international
community to achieve disarmament agree¬
ments and to develop a system of internatio¬
nal security based on the principles of the
United Nations Charter.
We can also point to the variety of ways in
which disarmament issues can be introduc¬
ed in school courses: in biology, the effects
of radiation on the organism... in chemistry,
the nature of chemical weapons... in science
courses, the nuclear fuel cycle, the effects
of nuclear weapons, and the dangers of pro¬
liferation. ..in sociology, public attitudes
towards concepts of military strength and
disarmament... in economics, technological
and industrial forces tending to perpetuate
the arms race.. .in geography, the regional
efforts to create nuclear-weapon-free
zones... in history, the decades of proposals
and counter-proposals for disarmament,
and consideration of why there has been so
little progress... even in language or seman
tics courses, which could examine such
terms as "defence needs", "security in¬
terests" and "non-interference in the inter¬
nal affairs of States".
Information is the core of education and it
is necessary to recognize the difficulties that
arise over questions of information, par¬
ticularly in regard to sensitive information in
the disarmament field. In fact, the informa¬
tion problem is central to the disarmament
process itselfwhether in regard to ex¬
change of information for confidence-
building purposes, verification methods to
provide facts about compliance, questions
of determining the facts on the level of
forces or facts about the extent of military
spending. Indeed, the lack of information
universally accepted as reliable adds
substantially to the difficulties of disarma¬
ment negotiations.
We need to have reliable, thorough, fac¬
tual information, in order to develop sound
and effective education programmes and
that brings us to one of the obstacles we
face.
Let us take as an example the question of
theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. NATO
argues that it has fallen behind in its nuclear
strength in Europe and requires the in¬
troduction of new missiles to restore the
balance. The Warsaw Treaty countries
maintain that there is approximate equality
or even a favourable edge for Western
forces, and that new missiles will upset the
balance. Here is a crucial issue on which all
Europeans would need to be well informed.
But what are the facts? Can a judgement
be made unless we know the details concer¬
ning the relative capacities of arsenals,
deployments, operational capabilities? Is
such information available? Perhaps not. If
one cannot tell students or the public the
answers, then at least they should be made
aware of the questions. To be aware of what
you don't know is also necessary in develop¬
ing an inquiring attitude.
If I seem to emphasize the need for factual
reliable information, that is because I feel it
is the only kind that can lead to qualified
judgements capable of commanding the at¬
tention of sceptics. This may not be a
problem in regard to the primary-level ap¬
proach aimed at teaching the evils of war¬
fare and weapons. But as the level of
teaching or the sophistication of the au¬
dience goes up, so does the need for
something more than slogans because the
military and political establishments are
more likely to be influenced by an analysis of
the facts than by mere slogans.
Yet even with the best intentions, it will
not be easy for schools or the media to meet
the need for accurate and objective informa¬
tion. While there is no lack of material on
disarmament discussions, negotiations and
treaties, it consists largely of United Nations
documents and publications written mainly
for professionals which reach only a limited

### 41129: World opinion: the weapon to end all weapons

>< K K X X
The story of Janusz Korczak (1878-1942) is both a tragic and
inspiring example of individual heroism and a reminder that
children are always the innocent victims of war. A Polish
doctor and writer who devoted his life to the education of
orphans, Korczak spurned offers of a safe escape from the
Warsaw ghetto because he refused to be separated from the
children in his charge. He accompanied them on their last
journey and died with them at the Treblinka death camp (see
Unesco Courier, June 1979). Drawing, left, by fourteen-year-
old Maria Springer, was a prize-winning entry in a
competition held in Poland to mark the centenary year of
Korczak's birth.
The audio-visual media can powerfully dramatize the moral
responsibility of each individual when faced with choices of
peace and war. The film Joseph Schultz is the reconstruction
of an event which actually took place during the Nazi invasion
of Yugoslavia in the Second World War. After burning
villages, a detachment of young troops was ordered to form a
firing squad for a mass execution of partisans and civilians.
The victims had been lined up against a haystack when
Joseph Schultz, one of the members of the firing squad,
refused to shoot and instead took his place among those to
be killed. Photo below was taken at the time by one of the
soldiers.

### 41129: World opinion: the weapon to end all weapons

It is often said that the arms industry is a vital driving force in
the economy, providing essential jobs and contributing to the
balance of payments. However, many studies have shown that
the reconversion of arms industries to non-military production
would not present an insoluble problem. The life of the little girl,
below, depends on an artificial kidney. The machine was one of
several socially useful products featuring in a constructive plan
prepared, when jobs were threatened by a cut-back in arms
programmes, by employees of an engineering firm heavily
dependent on military work.

h audience. U.N. files and publications are full
of this kind of information which is both fac¬
tual and objective. Facts about the arms
race itself, however, come largely from
private institutions and authors, each
writing from his own standpoint. This kind
of information also reaches only a limited
public.
There is probably no government in the
world which considers its own military
establishment to have an accelerating im¬
pact on the arms race, or that it could con¬
ceivably have an "aggressive" purpose. On
the contrary, each government maintains
and believes that its forces are only for
defence, that because of country A's
weapons or country B's supposed ambitions
it must call for just one more round of
weapons or one more strategic foothold.
For you and me, this means only one
thinganother leap in the arms race. But to
those involved it means "keeping the
balance" or "closing the gaps", or "ensur¬
ing adequate defence" even, in some
cases, that old favourite, arming to build
a position of strength in disarmament
negotiations.
So the truth is elusive, lost or hidden
behind excuses for remaining armed to the
teeth. Yet we must make the effort to find
the truth, to learn the hard facts about hard¬
ware while gaining insight into our percep¬
tions of one another that give rise to
automatic suspicions and exaggerated and
dangerous fears. To be effective, the case
put forward by proponents of disarmament
must be sufficiently well-informed to refute
the positions of the military experts involved
in decision-making, and solid enough to
convince the vast segment of the public
which in many countries tends to accept the
official view on the need for more rather
than less arms.
Let me state the problem in another way:
if the information made available for
dissemination differs from country to coun¬
try and is tailored to each country's par¬
ticular viewpoint, will that kind of informa
tion and education really help to mobilize
public opinion in such a way as to promote
disarmament? Or might it in fact merely en¬
courage enthusiasm for arms reductions to
be carried out by others? Disarmament
education must clearly be undertaken to the
furthest possible extent on an international
and universal basis.
I do not believe there is a need to create a
demand in one country for the disarmament
of another. That mobilization may con¬
tribute to the arms race rather than oppose
it. What we need to do, in all frankness, is to
invite all people east or west, north or
south to consider the possibility that yes,
their country too may also be a participant in
the arms race. There is a chance to achieve
progress if people will take an inquiring at¬
titude towards their own national policies.

Disarmament

by Jaime Diaz
THE Third World has for the most part
been absent from discussions on
disarmament, because it is wrongly
believed that this problem solely concerns
the superpowers, or the club of countries
possessing nuclear weapons. For the same
reason, "disarmament education" seems
rather out of place, particularly in Latin
America, a region that has always been con¬
sidered to be removed from the international
conflicts which are so frequent in other parts
of the world.
Latin American eyes see the arms race,
disarmament and disarmament education
from a different angle. In the industrialized
countries, when the arms race is discussed,
reference is made to physical arms (with all
the technological development that has
taken place this century) and to formal war¬
fare. These arms are acquired and used by
other countries for formal warfare via the ar¬
maments trade, which means that it is possi¬
ble to distinguish the manufacturers/ven¬
dors and the victims, i.e. the users. At the

CODECAL (Corporación Integral para el Desar¬
rollo Cultural y Social), the Bogota-based
organization for cultural and social development,
and Vice-President of the World Council for Cur¬
riculum and Instruction. This article is based on a
paper presented at the World Congress on Disar¬
mament Education of which Mr. Diaz was elected
Chairman.
same time, we observe that the great
powers, instead of coming into direct con¬
frontation with each other, wage war
through the intermediary of lesser powers
which thus virtually become their symbol.



'Arms
are the symptom
of a deep-seated ill
which must be
tackled at its roots'
In Latin America the most costly weapons
are imported, even though they are by then
obsolete in the producing countries. To ac¬
quire these weapons, sums of money out of
all proportion to the countries' resources are
expended.
Following the lead of the rich industrial
countries, our countries are beginning to
produce easy-to-build military equipment,
whilst the rich countries reserve for
themselves the production of large expen¬
sive items and the most profitable business.
The multinational firms make profits either
by exporting directly or authorizing
manufacture under licence. Arms sales take
place without restriction either through the
official market or clandestinely.
Governments use arms mostly to sup¬
press "subversion". However, the term
"subversion" is used arbitrarily to describe
any attempt to change the prevailing
political and economic order.
Thus, the concept of warfare is different:
it is not so much formal or direct warfare as
economic and social warfare, which slowly
amasses great numbers of victims, without
the attendant tumult of war on the
battlefield, through malnutrition, illness,
unemployment and lack of training, coupled
with the political powerlessness of the vic¬
tims to change the system.
Disarmament, as viewed from Latin
America, would first of all involve
eliminating the basic ills that lead to social
violence and hence to the use of arms. Arms
are not a cause but an effect; they are not
the problem but the symptom of a deep-
seated ill which must be tackled at its roots.
In this context, our first reaction as
educators, on surveying the world scene
and the situation in our own region, is that
the task is virtually impossible. Furthermore,
there appears to be a serious contradiction
between government actions towards disar¬
mament and government actions furthering
the arms race and militarism, with those
responsible for the latter constantly seeking

to justify themselves on ideological grounds,
using all the mass media, and exploiting to
the full peoples' unhappy memories and
cultural stereotypes of enemy countries.
But despite the daunting size of the
obstacles, and indeed precisely because of
them, effective action towards disarma¬
ment, particularly in the field of education, is
becoming a matter of vital urgency.
The objective of disarmament education is
not just to halt or eliminate the arms race,
but also to seek "non-military", peaceful
alternatives for solving problems between
countries. It is not, therefore, a purely
negative education, seeking to eliminate an
acute evil, but a positive education aimed at
initiating and promoting new ways of
achieving human coexistence.
From the point of view of the so-called
Third World countries, pursuit of such an
objective involves identifying, denouncing'
and critically examining in both theory and
practice the "myths" of militarism and the
arms race in the world which are greatly
amplified by the mass media; examining in
detail the basic causes of violence; analysing
the mechanisms of direct or indirect warfare
at the national and international levels and
their relationships with political systems and
economic interests; denouncing injustice at
all levels; and dedicating oneself to the task
of building a world based on equity instead
of repression or exploitation.
The values of war and the values of peace
are in opposition to each other. Disarma
ment education therefore has to take a dif¬
ferent direction, i.e. create its own set of
values. We have in fact reached the
paradoxical situation where the most
sophisticated and costly arms race is
justified precisely on the grounds of main¬
taining peace, yet this peace is nothing but a
cold war based on official lying, fear,
mistrust, the lust for power and profit, and
the maintenance of a violent political and
economic system whose leaders are firmly
resolved to survive even at the expense of
the greater part of mankind.
For peace we need a fundamental con¬
sistency between what is said and what is
done: that is to say a world where truth is
the norm; where the prevailing attitudes are
ones of sincere co-operation; of trust; of
open-mindedness to others precisely
because they are different and not merely on
the basis of the extent to which they fit into
our own cultural, economic, political or
ideological universe; of respect for genuine
self-determination of peoples; where it is
recognized that, as long as the basic needs
of all people remain unsatisfied, we are at
war; and where it ¡s-accepted that conflicts
should be able to be solved in a human way,
i.e. not through physical force or the law of
the jungle but rather by negotiation and con¬
sensus and even legitimate moral pressure,
which is frequently necessary for just causes
to be acknowledged.
The fundamental value, recognized as
transcending all ideological and religious dif¬
ferences, is man. Every system must be at
the service of man, of all men, not just a
few; of all nations, not just certain ones
among them; there can be no progress
along the road to peace as long as the well-
being and extravagance of a minority are
being financed by the sweat and toil of
deprived multitudes.
Education must create personal attitudes,
develop ethical values in both theory and
practice and stimulate initiative. But for this
a global approach to the problem is
necessary, so that it can be assessed and
dealt with progressively in both its political
and economic dimensions.
This means learning how to look at the
social world and assess it from the point of
view of others, particularly when these
others are the immense multitude of the
non-privileged.
Disarmament education from the point of
view described above is more a state of mind
than a subject or a topic; it is more a feature
of social education than a new area of
study; it is more a process than a theory;
and it is more a thing of the future than
something developed from the past.

### 41131: The Structure of hunger

The structure of hunger
by Muzammel Huq
THE ARMS TRADE
WE live today in a world in which there is not much cause for
optimism.
Huge sums of money are being spent on arms that could
and should be spent on development and in meeting the crying needs
of the Third World. Meanwhile, the arms race continues, more than
half a million of the world's best scientists are employed in perfecting
ever more sophisticated weapons, and military research and develop¬
ment accounts for more than seventy per cent of all scientific
research being carried out in the world. The waste of resources in¬
volved is evident to all, but it must be remembered that some in¬
dividuals and organizations are making enormous profits out of this
situation.
At the same time. Third World countries are afflicted by poverty,
hunger and malnutrition, which are due, it is claimed, to the popula¬
tion explosion. But the causes of hunger are structural; people do not
go hungry because food is not available. Even in 1974, during the
worst food crisis the world has known, stocks of grain were sufficient
to provide for everyone in the world. But more and more people are
unable to pay for the food they need. Unless and until structural
changes are made in the production system, increase in agricultural
products will have little effect on the causes of hunger.
South Asia today, for example, has a twenty-two million ton food
surplus and at the same time millions of people in the region are starv¬
ing. Hunger is, therefore, a matter of structure rather than of produc¬
tion and a rise in production alone cannot alleviate world hunger.
Development programmes established for Third World countries
are directly linked to the militarization of several of these countries.
Technology and ideas are being introduced into highly structured
societies, even though no analysis has been made of the socio¬
economic consequences they entail, simply because they are linked
to the existing world military order.
Perhaps the time has come for every nation to re-examine the
whole concept of national security. Whose security is being defend¬
ed, that of an economic or political class, or that of the entire popula¬
tion of the country? Wages are kept down and cheap labour enclaves
maintained, strikes are prevented and supplies of raw material are ob¬
tained from the Third World at low prices, all in the name of national
security. This is a dangerous concept which must be abandoned.
Militarization of the police and of paramilitary organizations is go¬
ing ahead at a tremendous pace in the Third World today. And this
militarization is required to support the internal power structure and
to maintain the status quo within various developing countries.
There are a few glimmers of hope. Throughout the world today
there is growing concern about military establishments and the
resources they are monopolizing. Another encouraging factor js that
the myth that defence industries generate employment is no longer
believed. Research has shown that investment in any other field than
armaments manufacture would generate more employment, whether
in the industrialized or the Third World. Thus, without a serious re¬
examination of the existing military order it will not be possible to
establish a new and more just world order.
MUZAMMEL HUQ, of Bangladesh, is director of the Institute for the Study
of Rural Resources, Noakhali, Bangladesh. He is the author of a number of
works on militarism, development and human rights. Since 1963 he has been
a close collaborator of Amnesty International. This article is based on a
speech made at the international Peace Forum, held in November 1979 at
Unesco headquarters in Paris.

Third World 3%
Arms exporting countries (1970-1979)
The arms trade affects the economies of importing
and exporting countries in diametrically opposite
ways. It is a highly unequal exchange which is
detrimental to efforts to bridge the gap between
poor and rich countries. For the importer it is purely
and simply a waste of economic resources which
could have been used productively. Even when
weapons are provided as gifts, operation and in¬
frastructure costs must be included on the debit
side. In contrast to the import of non-military
goods these outlays raise neither consumption nor
production and generate no future output from
which to pay for them. Not so for the exporting
country. That part of its arms production which is
destined for its own armed forces constitutes, at
first approximation, an economic loss. But its pro¬
duction of weapons for export is no different in
economic terms from any other export production.
In some cases it may be in fact more advantageous
than other kinds of export because the advanced-
technology component in arms exports is par¬
ticularly high. These exports therefore tend to
stimulate important sectors of the economy of the
exporting country, such as mechanical engineer¬
ing, electronics and the industries supplying these
sectors.

### 41132: Costa Rica: the country that abolished its army

Costa Rica :
the country that
abolished its army
by Julio Rodríguez Bolaños
IN a world which spends 500,000 million dollars a year on
weapons, it may seem strange that one country, Costa Rica,
has had no army for the last thirty years.
Costa Rica became independent of Spain on 15 September 1821,
along with the rest of Central America. The region immediately
became the scene of power struggles, but the Costa Ricans sat down
to thrash out a political constitution. This document, completed only
a matter of days after the achievement of independence, was signifi¬
cantly entitled the "Pact of Concord".
From the document and its title three conclusions may be deduced
about the Costa Ricans. Firstly, they were not interested in exploita¬
tion nor in enjoying the prizes of power but in establishing a legally
constituted State, based on laws and respect for the rights of others.
Secondly, faced with the choice between liberty and peace, the
Costa Ricans were able to preserve both without bloodshed. Thirdly,
the man of law, the statesman and the citizen prevailed over the mili¬
tary, a situation which led to what became a permanent feature of
Costa Rican democracy: a deep-rooted concern for education.
This unflagging commitment to education was the underlying pre¬
mise of the abolition of the army in 1949. A poor country cannot
afford the luxury of maintaining soldiery and at the same time educat¬
ing its people. Army and education, barracks and school, military
ranks and academic degrees are contradictory concepts for a
developing country, especially one set on guaranteeing to all its citi¬
zens the right to health.
Under the Costa Rican constitution, policing and security are
carried out by Civil Guards, workmen and peasant farmers who leave
their workshops every four years when a new government takes
office. Four years later they return to their usual occupations. If this is
not a model of professional efficiency, it has proved its worth in
maintaining a democratic system.
Rejection of force has brought force to Costa Rica. It is a mark of
the country's pride. The Costa Ricans are convinced that the only use
of armies and arsenals would be to imprison their fellow citizens, and
that if man was endowed by God with reason, then he has no cause
to seek security in arms. The abolition of our army has brought us a
number of advantages, the most important of which is the opportu¬
nity to devote 35 per cent of the national budget to education and an
equivalent amount to health.
It was against this background that the President of Costa Rica,
Mr. Rodrigo Carazo, presented to the 33rd General Assembly of the
United Nations on 27 September 1978, a project for the creation of a
University for Peace, which would be based in Costa Rica and would
be the country's contribution to the attainment of this fundamental
human right. The project was approved on 14 December 1979. The
structure of the University is being handled by a Commission which
has met twice this year, in June at United Nations Headquarters, and
in September at San José, the capital of Costa Rica.
Hitherto peace has been the end of one war and the prelude to new
armed conflicts. The aim of the University for Peace is to make the
study of peace a genuine discipline for research and teaching which
will be central to all educational programmes from the kindergarten
to the university. Peace can and should be taught. As Costa Rica's
President declared at the United Nations : "The 21st century will be a
peaceful one or it will not be at all".
JULIO RODRÍGUEZ BOLANOS, Costa Rican journalist, is adviser to the
President of the Republic of Costa Rica and co-ordinator of the project for the
creation of a University for Peace.

Relation of Education to
Disarmament
Disarmament education, an essential
component of peace education,
implies both education about disar¬
mament and education for disarma¬
ment. All who engage in education or
communication may contribute to
disarmament education by being
aware and creating an awareness of
the factors underlying the production
and acquisition of arms, of the social,
political, economic and cultural reper¬
cussions of the arms race and of the
grave danger for the survival of
humanity of the existence and poten¬
tial use of nuclear weapons.
achieving international security and
realizing development. To be effec¬
tive in this regard, disarmament edu¬
cation should be related to the lives
and concerns of the learners and to
the political realities within which
disarmament is sought and should
provide insights into the political,
economic and social factors on which
the security of peoples could be
based.
Research and Decision-making
In addition to reaching the general
public, disarmament education has a
more specific and equally crucial task
of providing rational arguments for
disarmament based on independent
scientific research which can guide
decision-makers and, to the extent
possible, rectify perceptions of a
potential adversary based on incom¬
plete or inaccurate information.
Substantive Approaches
As an approach to international peace
and security, disarmament education
should take due account of the princi¬
ples of international law based on the
Charter of the United Nations, in par¬
ticular, the refraining from the threat
or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of
States, the peaceful settlement of
disputes, non-intervention in domes¬
tic affairs and self-determination of
Definition of Disarmament
For the purpose of disarmament edu¬
cation, disarmament may be unders¬
tood as any form of action aimed at
limiting, controlling or reducing arms,
including unilateral disarmament ini¬
tiatives, and, ultimately, general and
complete disarmament under effec¬
tive international control. It may also
be understood as a process aimed at
transforming the current system of
armed nation States into a new world
order of planned unarmed peace in
which war is no longer an instrument
of national policy and peoples deter¬
mine their own future and live in
security based on justice and
solidarity.
Role of Information
Disarmament education requires the
collection and dissemination of relia¬
ble information from sources offering
the highest degree of objectivity in
accordance with a free and more
balanced international flow of infor¬
mation. It should prepare learners, in
the strict respect for freedom of opi¬
nion, expression and information, to
resist incitement to war, military pro¬
paganda and militarism in general.
4
Relation to Economic and Political
Realities
Disarmament education cannot,
however, confine itself to the disse¬
mination of data and information on
disarmament projects and prospects
nor even to commenting on the
hopes and ideals which inspired
them. It should recognize fully the
relationship disarmament has with

peoples. It should also draw upon the
international law of human rights and
international humanitarian law appli¬
cable in time of armed conflict and
consider alternative approaches to
security, including such non-military
defence systems as non-violent civi¬
lian action. The study of United
Nations efforts, of confidence-
building measures, of peace-keeping,
of non-violent conflict resolution and
of other means of controlling interna¬
tional violence take on special impor¬
tance in this regard. Due attention
should be accorded in programmes of
disarmament education to the right of
conscientious objection and the right
to refuse to kill.
Disarmament education should pro¬
vide an occasion to explore, without
prejudging the issue, the implications
for disarmament of the root causes of
individual and collective violence and
the objective and subjective causes of
tensions, crises, disputes and con¬
flicts which characterize the current
national and international structures
reflecting factors of inequality and
injustice.

the individual and collective rights to

Links with Human Rights and
Development
As an integral part of peace educa¬
tion, disarmament education has
essential links with human rights edu¬

so far as each of the three terms
peace, human rights and develop¬

the other two. Moreover, disarma¬

Pedagogical Objectives
Whether conceived as education in
the spirit of disarmament, as the
incorporation of relevant materials in
existing disciplines or as the develop¬
ment of a distinct field of study, disar¬
mament education should apply the
most imaginative educational methods,
particularly those of participatory
learning, geared to each specific cul¬
tural and social situation and level of
education. It aims at teaching how to
think about disarmament rather than
what to think about it. It should there¬
fore be problem-centred so as to
develop the analytical and critical
capacity to examine and evaluate
practical steps towards the reduction
of arms and the elimination of war as
an acceptable international practice.
marnent education
Values
Disarmament education should be
based upon the values of internatio¬
nal understanding, tolerance of ideo¬
logical and cultural diversity and com¬
mitment to social justice and human
solidarity.
10
Sectors of Society Concerned
Disarmament education should be
the concern of all sectors of society
and public opinion. Indeed, schools,
non-formal and informal education
circles such as the family, community
organizations and the world of work,
universities and other research cen¬
tres and information media, all have a
part to play in this task. Educators
and communicators should strive to
develop the most appropriate and
effective language and teaching
methods for each situation. The chal¬
lenge is all the greater as the stakes
are so high.
The Ten Principles for Disarmament Education

drawn up at the World Congress on Disarmament

BERT ROLING, of the Netherlands, is professor
emeritus at the University of Groningen whose
Polemological Institute he founded and directed
for many years. A jurist and expert on interna¬
tional law, he was the first Secretary-General of
the International Peace Research Association.
BY one of the stranger ironies of fate
the funds that provide the world's
most prestigious award for action in
favour of peace, the Nobel Peace Prize,
were derived from the invention and sale of
dynamite and other high explosives. Yet
Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), the industrialist
and inventor of dynamite who founded the
Nobel Prizes, saw himself as a pacifist and
was convinced that the destructive power of
his inventions would bring an end to war.
Writing to Baroness Bertha von Suttner, the
author of the famous book Die Waffen
Nieder (Down with Armaments) and one of
the first winners of the Nobel Peace Prize,
he declared: "I do more for peace with my
guns than you with your disarmament
lectures".
Nobel eventually came to realize that he
had miscalculated his weapons were not

respondence he wrote that armaments
would only bring about the elimination of
war when they were powerful enough to
destroy not only military forces but the
civilian population as well.
Today the world has reached that situa¬
tion. The advance of science and
technology has brought atomic weapons
and missiles with such a capacity for mass
destruction that their use in a war between
nuclear powers would literally wipe out both

parties. And the consequences of such a
war might well also be disastrous for the rest
of mankind. Indeed, many experts fear that
the entire world would become
uninhabitable.
The doctrine propounded by the Prussian
military theorist, Carl von Clausewitz, that
"war is the continuation of policy with
military means", is no longer valid between
nuclear powers. It may, nevertheless, still
have some meaning in the context of Third
World relations cynics have said that war
has become the "privilege" of the poor and
the underdeveloped. But even wars on the
non-nuclear scale have become too risky,
since the superpowers may consider that
their outcome will affect their vital interests
and therefore intervene. If wars continue to
break out as they have done in the recent
past (about 130 wars have occurred since
the end of World War II), the probability is
that in the near future one of them will
escalate into a world war. This is why the
whole world has a vital interest in the
maintenance of peace.
Thus technological advance in weapons
development has brought about a situation
in which modern nuclear weapons can no
longer be used in combat because they
would lead to mutual annihilation, and wars
fought with conventional weapons carry the
risk of escalation into nuclear war. At the
same time, the arms race and the prolifera¬
tion of nuclear weapons (about five hundred
thousand million dollars are spent each year
on armaments) have produced a crazy
overkill capacity which could destroy the en¬
tire population of the world many times
over.
If modern weaponry is unusable, does this
mean that there is a case for unilateral disar¬
mament? Unfortunately not, because if one
party were to disarm unilaterally, the
weapons of the other party would become
usable again since there would be no fear of
retaliation. Thus we are faced with the
paradox that, although weapons may have
become unusable, they cannot easily be

^ relinquished in the world as it is today.
The logical conclusion to be drawn from
all this is that the only reasonable function of
armed power is to deter other States from
attacking or threatening to attack. Sabre-
rattling, even with the nuclear sabre, is still a
customary practice among the stronger na¬
tions. But if other States have a deterring
weapon posture, this "coercive diplomacy",
this "political use of military power", this
threat to use force loses all credibility.
If the only reasonable function of national
military power is to provide military security
achieved through the neutralization of the
military power of possible opponents by en¬
suring that their weapons remain unusable,
the question arises as to what level of ar¬
maments is necessary to attain this goal.
On this point opinions differ. In some
military circles the demand is for "enough
arms to enable us to win if war breaks out".
In other words, they want superiority of
weaponry. But if this attitude is adopted,
the arms race will continue endlessly as
States seek to achieve a disarming first
strike capability (the capacity to destroy all
the opponent's strategic weapons in one
surprise attack). Military security, however,
should imply "weapon security", that is to
say, the avoidance of a weapon situation in
which the weapons themselves form an in¬
dependent danger. Human nature being
what it is, such a disarming first strike
capability would inevitably lead to war.
The most satisfactory answer to the ques¬
tion "how much weapon power is enough?"
would seem to be: "just sufficient to ensure
that war will be avoided". A State needs
many more weapons to win (whatever winn¬
ing might mean in a nuclear confrontation)
than to deter the commencement of a war.
"Minimum deterrence", "inoffensive deter¬
rence", "defensive deterrence", "territorial
defence", all these terms have been used to
indicate a military posture which would
make a State powerful enough to deter a
would-be aggressor whilst being itself utter¬
ly incapable of committing aggression.
This function of national military
power that is, to provide for military
security by deterring the use of weapons by
others is the only function recognized in
international law. The United Nations
Charter forbids the use of military force (or
the threat of its use) except in the case of an
armed attack. The standpoint of the Charter
is unequivocal; it amounts to the prohibition
of the first use of armed force. And this
standpoint is clearly reaffirmed in the defini¬
tion of aggression adopted by the General
Assembly on 14 December 1974 which ex¬
pressly states: "No consideration of
whatever nature, whether political,
economic, military or otherwise, may serve
as a justification of aggression".
To rely on law in arguments concerning
international relations is, at best, a pre¬
carious business. Law is only one of the fac¬
tors, and not the strongest, which play a
role in deciding actions in the international
field. Nevertheless, the rule prohibiting the
use of force, this basic ground rule of the
United Nations, is not just some kind of lux¬
ury designed to make life more pleasant; it is
the pre-condition of life itself. It is a law that
follows logically from the present weapons
dilemma that our weapons are unusable
but still cannot be relinquished. The prohibi¬
tion of the use of force is the logical con¬
sequence of that dilemma and it is our

"When they are united, the weak become powerful".
Just as the tiny Lilliputians in Swift's Gulliver's Travels
(above) were able to bind Gulliver with their gossamer-
threads, the co-operation of the world's smaller nations
offers a basis for a new approach to questions of
disarmament and arms control by the great powers.
common interest that this rule be observed.
International law has restricted the
freedom of the sovereign States by pro¬
hibiting the use of armed force except in
response to attack. But traditional interna¬
tional law did not restrict the sovereign right
of the State to possess armed power. It was
only after World War II that the right to
possess weapons was limited. A State may
not possess biological weapons nor
weapons based on environment modifica¬
tion techniques, if it is a party to treaties
regulating these weapons. If it is a non-
nuclear power and adheres to the Non-
Proliferation Treaty, it is forbidden to
possess nuclear weapons. Other treaties
limit the numbers of certain kinds of
weapons a State may possess and forbid the
introduction of weapons to certain specific
areas (for example, the sea bed, cosmic
space, the South Pole).
States that adhere to such treaties may
then be said to have recognized the rule that
"the right of States to possess arms is not
unlimited". But this is not a universal rule of
international law since not all States are
bound by these treaties which can,
moreover, be renounced. The question is
whether it should not become a general
principle of international law with precise
and binding rules concerning the extent to
which the sovereign right to have arms is
restricted.
Up till now, restrictions on this sovereign
right to possess arms have forbidden some
quality or quantity of specific categories of
weapons. But technological innovations
have made this approach difficult if not
useless. Hence the need for a new approach
which does not rely on qualitative or quan¬
titative restrictions but considers instead not
weapons but the missions or functions of
armed power. "Missions" or "functions"
are used here to describe the specific tasks
to which military capabilities can be put, and
it is these missions or functions that should
be made the primary focus of agreement.
Some capabilities should be forbidden the
capability of launching a pre-emptive first
strike or a successful surprise attack. As a
general rule a State should not have the
right to possess arms capable of performing
functions that are forbidden by international
law.
If, according to present international law,
the principal function of national armed
forces is to provide military security, should
it still be legitimate to possess armed power
capable of going beyond that function? The
answer must be "No". The logical con¬
sequence of the ban on the use of force ex¬
cept to resist armed attack is a further ban
on the right to possess arms conceived for
aggressive purposes.
One of the "four freedoms" in Roosevelt's
famous State of the Union speech in 1941
was "freedom from fear". It implied a
"world-wide reduction of armaments
such. ..that no nation will be in a position to
commit an act of physical aggression
against any neighbour, anywhere in the
world". And Sumner Welles, the U.S.
Secretary of State at the time, clarified the
issue by stating that this implied "the aboli¬
tion of offensive arms and the limitation and
reduction of defensive armaments and of
the tools which make possible the construc¬
tion of these armaments".
Such a set of all-embracing rules could w
only gradually be established. A start might t

k be made with the prohibition of the in¬
troduction of new offensive or de-stabilizing
weapon systems. We might gradually reach
the stage at which the guiding principle
would be a ban on the possession of ex¬
cessive armaments. A new chapter of inter¬
national law concerning arms control and
disarmament is needed and this was stress¬
ed by peace experts at meetings held at
Unesco in 1978 and 1980.
A new approach in the field of disarma¬
ment has been proposed, but proposals
need to be addressed to people or groups
who can act upon them. In our case the
message is destined for the smaller nations.
The time has come to adopt the battle cry:
"Nuclear proletarians of the whole world,
unite!" The smaller nations, members of
military alliances and non-aligned countries
should co-operate more actively on ques¬
tions of disarmament and arms control.
They should collectively develop prin¬
ciples and standards to be applied in
negotiations on the basis of which the
United Nations General Assembly should
outline in its resolutions the standards and
rules of the new chapter of international law
concerning the restriction of national
freedom to possess weapons.
Although the General Assembly does not
have legislative power, it can, by its resolu¬
tions, change the political and juridical
climate in the world, as it did with respect to
colonialism, racial discrimination and the
market mechanism of the existing interna¬
tional economic order. Even in face of the
resistance of the great powers, the smaller
States, who form a vast majority, would be
able to make their strongly held convictions
gain the day. When they are united, the
weak become powerful.
The Special Disarmament Session was
the first occasion on which the small States
gave signs of their impatience and their
misgivings concerning the arms control
practices of the" superpowers. It provided a
demonstration of their protest against the
failure of the States previously responsible
for putting arms control into effect.
The Final Act of the Special Session on
Disarmament provides for institutions in
which the smaller States can fulfil their new
role in giving guidelines that should be
observed in arms control negotiations and
preparing the ground for the acceptance of
new rules restricting national freedom to
possess weapons. In the field of arms con¬
trol and disarmament the General Assembly
has to perform the same role as a law-
creating agency as it has in the field of
human rights and is doing with regard to the
establishment of a New International
Economic Order. In all these fields the pro¬
gressive development of international law
implies a curtailment of national sovereign¬
ty. These curtailments are not unrelated;
they are interdependent. Restriction of the
right to possess arms will only have lasting
effect if in other fields also arbitrary
behaviour by States gives way to behaviour
that fits into an international framework aim¬
ed at world peace and the well-being of
humanity.

### 41134: From man of war to man of peace

From man of war
to man of peace
The Venerable Gyotsu Ko Sato attending a session of the World
Congress on Disarmament Education, held at Unesco headquarters,
Paris, from 9 to 13 June.
by Howard Brabyn gg
P
HOWARD BRABYN is editor of the English
edition of the Unesco Courier.
EACE" and "Repentance" are
words that come constantly
to the lips of the Venerable
Gyotsu Ko Sato. The peace he proclaims is
peace for the world, with nuclear disarma¬
ment as the first step. Repentance is for
himself, for incredible as it may seem today,
the serene, ever-smiling figure in the saffron
robe of a Buddhist monk was once an
avowed militarist and a diehard member of
the Japanese warrior caste.
Gyotsu Ko Sato grew up in the troubled
climate of the years that followed the First
World War, a period which saw the revival
of Japanese militarism, the occupation of
Manchuria in 1931, the "China Incident" of
1937, and the gradual but inexorable drift
towards the Second World War.
"I was born in 1918 in a very remote
corner of the Japanese main island,
Honshu, in the northern part in a small
and peaceful village. My father was a
teacher. Then we moved to the middle
of Honshu island where I went to
school. Just at that time Japan was en¬
tirely changing, particularly in the
education field, because of the
militarization that was going on. The
China incident, as it was called in
Japan, was started by the invasion of
Manchuria. I was in the 6th year grade
at primary school. I remember many
young people were being mobilized into
the forces and they were telling us we
had to defend our nation. We had to be
loyal to the emperor and when an
emergency arose we had to go to the
battlefield with no hesitation what¬
soever in order to defend our nation.
That was what our teachers told us. We
were taught to respect the ancient
Samurai warrior code and to believe
that it was an honour to die in battle."
The sweeping successes of Japanese
armies during the early days of the war
served to confirm all that the young Sato
had been brought up to believe and sub¬
sequent defeats only hardened his resolve.
Even after atomic bombs fell on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August 1945,
Major Sato, then working at a weapons
research establishment, could not face the
"dishonour" of defeat and urged continu¬
ation of the war.
"I was serving in the military aero¬
nautical research institute working on
communications systems and on radio
control of missiles. The Japanese
weapons systems were rather inferior
compared with those of the United
States and the allied forces and I was
eager to improve them. When
Hiroshima was bombed I believed that
the United States had played its last
card and that they had no other means
to defeat us, so that if we persevered
then we might be able to conclude an
honourable peace. I urged people not
to surrender, but to wait and persevere.
Later I was ashamed to have said this
when I saw with my own eyes the
devastation of Hiroshima."
When an armistice was signed on
14 August 1945, Major Sato together with
other military extremists forced their way in¬
to a Japanese army air base and attempted
to take off in the notorious "kamikaze"
suicide planes for a desperate final attack on
the Allied fleet. The attempt was foiled by
Japanese military police and Major Sato
found himself a prisoner in his own country.
"Warriors were supposed to die if their
mission was not fulfilled and many of
my friends and colleagues committed
suicide. I was about to do so when I
was arrested without any weapons near
me. I tried to obtain a weapon to kill k
myself, but the watch was tight. The r

í military police officer guarding me told
me repeatedly not to die. He told me
that I should let myself sink to the bot¬
tom of society for some time and that
later I would be able to raise my head
again. Until then, he said, I should
simply survive. In the end I was
somehow convinced by him that I
should not kill myself. He had a friend
outside the military and I was introduc¬
ed to him. That friend was a Buddhist,
a retired naval officer of high rank, and
he suggested that I should become a
Buddhist monk".
Upon his release, Sato shaved his head
and donned the robes of a novice monk.
Though his heart was not in it he went
through the Buddhist rites and rituals; but it
was not until some two months later that he
discovered that a fundamental change had
occurred within him. He visited Hiroshima
and Nagasaki and learnt at first hand the full
horror of the atom bomb, whose effects he
discovered were far greater than even the
United Nations reports had revealed. On
25 February 1946 he was ordained and
became a fully-fledged Buddhist monk.
The wheel had turned full circle and the
former traditional militarist decided to wage
his own personal war on war. Today, as
Vice-president of the International Peace
Bureau, his voice is heard throughout the
world calling for peace.
Disarmament, he says, depends upon
governments, but the political will to disarm
originates in the minds of the people;
without that no treaty, however solemn and
binding, will achieve anything. A firm con¬
viction of the need for peace must exist at
the bottom of each and every person's
heart, otherwise humanity will not survive.
"My father and mother were both
teachers and they were not in favour of
my becoming a military officer. Both of
them were opposed to my decision as a
young boy, but school education over¬
whelmed the family teachings and I
paid no heed to my parents. Educa¬
tional systems must be carefully con¬
trolled by peaceable people. When I am
asked what the ordinary individual can
do for peace I tell them 'fear not'. Even
though the threat of violence may be
there we need not be fearful about it.
We need not arm to defend ourselves.
This is the first conviction that came to
me after I became a monk, for the
teaching of the Buddha is clear fear
not and therefore kill not. The. right to
live in peace must be made an individual
right as well as a fundamental national
right. In this way we will deny States
the right to declare war or to use war as
a solution for conflicts between States.
The theory that nuclear weapons are a
deterrent to war and that armaments
are a necessary evil is a false concept
that should be swept away".
Gyotsu Ko Sato has become a man of
peace, but the traces of his own inner strug¬
gle are still evident in everything he says and
does. He believes that his experience may be
of help to many who have faced, or may in
the future have to face a similar personal
dilemma. To have his story spread abroad,
to be obliged to re-live, again and again, and
in public, what he now sees as the shame of
his early life is part of his never-ending
penance.

HOW can the powerful force of
education be made to serve peace
and not war? How can it produce
individuals free from' aggressivity and from
the disastrous influences of nationalists,
chauvinist and racist prejudices? How can
the younger generation be brought up to
become convinced and active fighters for
peace and social progress? In a world in
which sixty times more is spent on training
in the science of destruction each one of the
twenty-five million people now clad in
military uniforms than on the training of one
child in creative activities, these questions
are uppermost in the minds of all those con
cerned with the education of youth for
peace.
It has become increasingly evident that
the arms race is not only undermining
mankind's economic health but is also caus¬
ing direct moral and psychological damage.
As the political scientist Pyotr Fedoseyev
declared at the 11th World Congress of the
International Political Sciences Association,
held in Moscow in August 1979: "The very
atmosphere of preparation for a new war, of
fomenting war hysteria and the reign of
militarism, limits the creative powers of the
human mind... On the other hand, efforts to
develop and strengthen the process of

détente and to achieve mutually beneficial
co-operation and friendship among nations
contribute to personal fulfilment of the in¬
dividual and the development of all man's
most noble qualities".
Thus, although socio-economic factors
may play a decisive role, the individual, pro¬
perly educated in the spirit of international
co-operation and peace and respect for fun¬
damental human rights and freedoms, can
have an enormous influence in normalizing
and improving the political climate in the
world.
Seen in this light the problems of educa¬
tion for disarmament take on a new urgen
cy. This was recognized by the 1974 General
Conference of Unesco which adopted a
Recommendation Concerning Education for
International Understanding, Co-operation
and Peace and Education Relating to Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The
Recommendation is a comprehensive docu¬
ment applicable to all stages of education
which indicates concrete steps which can be
taken in the educational field. Many Unesco
Member States have already taken action on
these proposals.
In Finland, for example, 30,000 copies of
the Recommendation have been circulated
among students and teachers. Seminars for
teachers are held regularly at which the
Recommendation is discussed. The Final
Act of the 1975 Helsinki Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe is also
a subject of study in Finnish schools.
In Poland, a special programme of peace
education begins at kindergarten level and
continues through primary and secondary
schools and higher educational institutions
as well as in clubs for teenagers.

' demn militarism and stress the value of
peace and human life.
In Austria, a number ot non-governmental
organizations have established the Austrian
Committee for Co-ordination of. Activities
for Peace. The Committee has drawn up a
"Plan of Action for Disarmament and
Education in the Spirit of Peace" which pro¬
vides for the preparation and translation of
instructional material on disarmament
problems for use in schools and in teacher
training institutions,
i
These recent examples of positive action
taken by a number of countries reflect the
notion that for schoolchildren textbooks
provide a window on the world. The first let¬
ters, the first words, the first systematized
ideas of life around them are learned by
children from textbooks. So it is vitally im¬
portant to ensure that their pages do not
become a source of misinformation, a
"distorting mirror", and that they do not
plant in children's minds seeds that will
grow into a scornful attitude towards other
people and an urge for violence and
aggression.
The bilateral and multilateral co-operation
that has been developing over the last few
years in the revision of the contents of
textbooks has proved very fruitful. Recom¬
mendations for the revision of history texts
have been drawn up, for instance, by
representatives of the Federal Republic of
Germany and Poland, and commissions
with similar tasks have been set up in the
USSR and the United States and in Finland
and the USSR.
Work in this direction should be con¬
tinued. Textbooks must make children
aware of the social nature of war and in¬
dicate the real rather than the illusory paths
to peace. There should be no place in
textbooks for the myth that the arms race
maintains employment or for notions of the
inevitability of war. A Soviet sociology
textbook for secondary school students
reads, for example: "In our day peaceful co¬
existence is an objective requirement of
peaceful development, the foundation of
the stability of the entire system of present
day international relations. It can be said
with confidence that there is no acceptable
alternative solution to peaceful co¬
existence."
Soviet textbooks on physics, biology and
chemistry emphasize the international
character of science and technology. In the
chapter on atomic energy in the physics
course textbook, for example, emphasis is
laid on the need to fight for a ban on nuclear
weapons tests and students are informed
about the principal international agreements
in this field. In the biology course instruction
on the biological processes in the cell in¬
cludes information on the deadly effect on
human beings of exposure to radioactivity.
The course on the geography of continents
incorporates the subject "Protection of
nature in the Antarctic as a model of interna¬
tional co-operation".
Education for international co-operation
and peace and respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms starts with the
teaching of these rights and freedoms so as
to provide students with a solid background
on which to base their behaviour throughout
their lives. Study of this subject begins in
the eighth year of general secondary educa¬
tion (i.e. before the age of sixteen when


### 41136: The Soviet Peace Fund

The Soviet peace
DURING the hardest years of the
Second World War, when the
battle against the forces of in¬
ternational fascism was raging on the
Dniepr, in the suburbs of Moscow and
on the outskirts of Leningrad, a move¬
ment was established to aid the Soviet
army.
Money and foodstuffs were collected
for this purpose, and the movement
spread throughout the country. The
money went to equip armoured units
and air squadrons. "Everything for the
front ! Everything for victory !" These
were not empty slogans, and people
gave willingly.
With the coming of victory, as
humanity set out to preserve a peace
whose achievement had claimed so
many victims, there arose a movement
for the defence of peace which is today
the most powerful of our time. A deter¬
mination to be involved in all the great
causes of the age awakened a desire to
contribute to the struggle for peace.
The Soviet committee for the
defence of peace, and other non¬
governmental organizations based in
various parts of the country, began to
receive donations to be used in the
struggle for peace, the strengthening of
friendship between peoples, and aid to
those fighting social injustice, and to
their families. Substantial sums flowed
in and were sent to various recipients. It
became necessary to funnel these out¬
pourings of popular generosity into a
mighty river.
And so a single Peace Fund was
created. Its address, 10 Kropotkin
Street, Moscow, is famous today both
inside and outside the Soviet Union. It
receives all donations and subsidies
contributed by the public to a variety of
peaceful causes.
The Fund, whose organization is now
solidly established, convenes con¬
ferences, organizes international peace
assemblies, sends delegations abroad,
and welcomes visitors. Supplies for

The cost of these activities runs to
millions of roubles a year. But the most
remarkable feature of the Fund is that it
does not become depleted. On the con¬

like the rouble which, in the old Russian
story, was given to a peasant who was
enjoined to spend it unhesitatingly, but
only on good causes. The generous

The basic principles implemented at
secondary level are applied at the univer¬
sities and other institutions of higher educa¬
tion. In the natural sciences attention is
drawn to the global problems involved in
protecting the atmosphere, bodies of water,
vegetation and wildlife which can only be
solved through the joint efforts of all coun¬
tries. In history, philosophy, political
economy and law courses emphasis is
placed on the comprehensive study of the
problems of safeguarding peace, interna¬
tional security and disarmament.
Present world realities demand that the
education and upbringing of children be
made an active "zone of peace". All who are
involved in the education of the younger
generation the family, the school, the
university, the mass media, literature, the
theatre, the cinema should play their part
in educating them in the spirit of peace and
disarmament, of safeguarding international
security and an atmosphere of mutual trust
as the only hope for the existence and future
development of mankind.
This, indeed, was the unanimous opinion
of the delegates attending the World Con¬
gress on Disarmament Education, held at
Unesco headquarters in Paris from 9 to 13
June, 1980. The final Document of the Con¬
gress points out the enormously important
role to be played in this process by teachers
and instructors on whom it largely depends
whether the new generation will value peace
as the greatest treasure of mankind.

### 41137: Teaching disarmament at universities: a world survey

Teaching disarmament
at universities :
a world survey
UNESCO'S Division of Human
Rights and Peace, in co-operation
with certain non-governmental
organizations, recently initiated a sur¬
vey that sought to discover the extent
and nature of current disarmament edu¬
cation efforts in universities in all
regions of the world. In North America,
the Consortium on Peace Research,
Education and Development (COPRED)
accepted responsibility for the effort.
The World Federation of United Nations
Associations (WFUNA) conducted the
distribution and collection of the infor¬
mation for Africa, Asia, Australia and
New Zealand, and Western Europe
(excluding parts of Austria, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Switzerland).
The Latin American survey was handled
by the Latin American Faculty of Social
Sciences (FLACSO). In Eastern Europe,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Swit¬
zerland, and portions of Austria, the
International Institute of Peace (IIP)
developed, distributed and collected the
information from the German language
surveys. We present below some gen¬
eral comments on the survey from a
paper prepared for COPRED by Profes¬
sor Leonard Gambrell.
For purposes of the survey, disarm¬
ament education was broadly defined.
Respondents were asked to
include instruction which dealt with almost
any aspect of the development, theory, or
rationale of arms policies. Likewise, they
were asked to include any sort of arms con¬
trol or disarmament related studies. Conse¬
quently, courses dealing with economic pro¬
blems associated with either the arms races
or disarmament, or with more narrow theo¬
retical or technical concepts such as deter¬
rence logic, were considered a possible part
of disarmament education.
Diversity in educational and political
systems made it very difficult for Unesco to
develop a single uniform questionnaire. It
was recognized, that even if the same ques¬
tions were asked, the diversity in perspec¬
tives and experiences in general, plus the
variation in views of the scope and nature of
what disarmament education entails, would
make a uniform survey difficult. For these
reasons, therefore, it cannot be claimed that
the survey has scientific statistical
significance, but it does provide important
information on the substance, and lack, of
disarmament education as well as insights
into several of the general problems facing
Art inspired by matters of concern to society as a whole should not be confined to art
galleries. The French artist Ernest Pignon Ernest exhibits his work in public
places streets, squares, public stairways that are associated in the collective
memory with incidents in the struggle against violence.
disarmament education endeavours.
Given the specific limitations of the survey
response, it seems fair to assert that little at¬
tention is being given to genuine disarma¬
ment education. While 73.8 per cent of
respondents offer courses on disarmament
problems or related issues, only 18.7 per
cent offer as much as one course dealing
with specific aspects of disarmament. There
is widespread general support of the notion,
but when probing deeper one finds that real
support, even in terms of long-range goaL
or interests, is lacking.
There is a recognizable resistance or indif¬
ference toward disarmament education on
the part of many of those teaching and
developing the professional literature in in¬
ternational relations and related fields. At
least part of this negative attitude may be at¬
tributed to the vagueness of the concept of
disarmament. Educators are not likely to in¬
itiate courses on a subject that does not sug¬
gest clear direction, scope and content.
The literature focusing on the moral
aspects of arms races seldom seems to be
consistent. Sometimes condemnation
seems directed at the use of violent defence;
in other instances, it appears that any type
of coercion or the mere presence of such a
threat is immoral. Even more contradictory
is an implied acceptance of conventional
arms policies coupled with condemnation of
the threatened use of nuclear weapons or
the use of "weapons of mass destruction".
By implication it is all right to use weapons
just as long as atoms are not split or the
destruction is sufficiently gradual.
One of the most negative influences on
the acceptance of disarmament education is
the treatment of the political aspects of the
topic of disarmament. Among the most glar¬
ing weaknesses is the general failure to
establish clear and precise linkage of arms
races to military doctrines and perceptions.
Overall there seems to be little appreciation
of the inherent implications that flow from a
nation's conceptualization of its strategic
and tactical defence policies. Seldom does
there appear to be any linkage of these mat¬
ters to levels and types of weapons systems.
One gets the impression that arms races are
nothing more than the consequence of habit
or lack of imagination.
It therefore appears that what is being
urged is a mere proclamation to stop arming
and it will occur. There is not sufficient
analysis and probing of the apparent
linkages between continuation of arms ex¬
pansion and such matters as the logic of
deterrence theory. Within the "logic" of
deterrence there are serious conceptual
flaws that inevitably lead to excessive
reliance upon arms and especially on nuclear

weapons. The concept promises much more
than can be delivered.
An additional problem arises from con¬
ceptual difficulties within disarmament
thought. It is sometimes postulated that on¬
ly the developed world can afford the "lux¬
ury" of thinking or teaching about disarma¬
ment. Developing nations, it is either argued
or implied, must focus on gaining and main¬
taining security.
Security, however, has several dimen¬
sions. Physical safety is only one aspect of
this concern. It is equally important to think
of the psychological or self-confidence
aspects of security. Likewise, it should be
noted, that although one thinks in terms of
national security, in political reality, the con¬
cern for security actually translates, in terms
of government policies, to mean the security
of the particular individual or groups of in¬
dividuals heading the government. Positive
economic development can and will occur
only within regimes which are led by people
who feel secure. Therefore, the effort to
promote disarmament should include an
awareness of processes that enhance this a
priori sense of security. To isolate disarma¬
ment as a separate goal or interest is a
mistake. Talk of removing weapons, or even
the study of such, will probably be viewed
as threatening in the "real" political world.
It is not very important whether peace
researchers and educators believe weapons
systems do or do not provide security. What
matters most are the perceptions of those
who have the weapons.
Within the broader conception of security
lies the possibility of establishing a clear
linkage between disarmament and security.
It is nonsense to ask political leadership to
behave in ways that do not make sense from
the leaders' perspectives. This also means
that there is a need to devote much greater
energy and creativity to improving the
chances of positively influencing those
who do not now agree with the goals of
disarmament.
- Much of the emphasis on disarmament is
somewhat misguided or misdirected. This,
in turn, has an adverse impact on the degree
of interest in disarmament education. In the
final analysis, neither development nor
disarmament can occur unless there is a
sense of general political security and confi¬
dence. Disarmament taken alone projects a
sense of defencelessness. One wonders, if
not arms, "what follows" or "what else" will
we experience? It should be recognized that
within formal academic training and espe¬
cially within international relations and diplo¬
matic history courses there seems to be little
awareness of alternative methods for pro¬
viding national security.
The failure to link disarmament proposals
with the necessity for conceptually projec¬
ting the notion of alternative approaches to
national security leaves disarmament educa¬
tion with a bleak future. If we are to reverse
this condition there must be full appreciation
of what does exist and what appear to be
important barriers to the development of
meaningful and far-reaching disarmament
education. This may require less use of the
term "disarmament" and more emphasis
upon the positive concept of alternative
views and approaches to security.

painting entitled "Children of Every Clime"

Milan, Italy.
PAUL MORREN, of Belgium, is State Inspector
at the Ministry of Education and Dutch Culture in
Belgium. He has been editor, since its inception

by Paul Morren
IN 1953 Unesco created tne Associated
Schools system as part of its pro¬
gramme of education for international
understanding and peace. Today over 1,600
institutions at every level, in almost eighty
countries, are involved. These Member in¬
stitutions are to be found in Africa, Asia,
Oceania, the Middle East, eastern and
western Europe, Latin America and North
America. Thus they are situated in regions
with widely different economic and social
systems, cultural traditions, levels of
development, and necessarily, educational L
systems. '

### 41138: Education for international understanding: UNESCO's Associated Schools System

Each school is directly associated with the
activities of Unesco, whose education sec¬
tor has a special unit which handles the co¬
ordination of the system. Since 1961 this
unit has published a magazine. International
Understanding at School, in order to pro¬
vide a link with the Member schools.
The Associated Schools are selected by
authorities in the various countries-
National Commissions for Unesco, Minis¬
tries of Education, specially constituted
committees. Ideas are exchanged and plans
drawn up at seminars held in these countries
and attended by teachers, civil servants and
in some cases the pupils themselves.
Schools taking part in the programme lose
none of their autonomy. It is up to them to
decide, in the light of what is feasible and
the interest shown by pupils and teachers,
on the form their collaboration should take.
The main thing is that a new spirit should
infuse their everyday work and that the
Associated Schools should be innovating
institutions capable of exercising a lasting
influence on the entire educational system.
When the programme was launched,
Unesco proposed three subjects for study:
international organizations within the United
Nations family; human rights; and the cultu¬
res of other countries. These options were
not in any way exclusive, although most
schools decided to take one or other of
them, and a strong preference was shown
for the third (and undoubtedly the easiest)
choice.
The field is immense, and the scope for
dynamism and initiative is limitless. But
facile sermonizing and the preaching of sim¬
plistic propaganda are always ruled out. "If
the choice has to be made between truth
and international citizenship, then I'm for
truth", said one of the delegates at the first
meeting of the Associated Schools. The
transmission of tendentious, incomplete or
falsely optimistic information would be the
worst kind of disservice to education for
international understanding (or to any other
kind of education, for that matter).
Presenting the United Nations as the infal¬
lible solution to all political problems is not
the way to help young people to understand
the conflict-ridden situations on which their
security may depend. Shouting from the
rooftops that all men are brothers is not the
way to fight racism, prejudice and discrimi¬
nation. Vaunting the beauty of the Taj
Mahal is not the way to explain India and its
people, its achievements and its problems,
its international relations, its economy and
the meaning of its culture. Let us make no
mistake: we must talk about the United
Nations, put the accent on human solidarity
and pay tribute to outstanding achieve¬
ments, but critically and within a broad
context.
As I see it, education for international
understanding should primarily seek to pro¬
mote an awareness of the international
aspects of the human condition, of contem¬
porary civilization and social relations, of the
dynamics of their evolution, and of the con¬
sequently growing interdependence of peo¬
ples and nations. This awareness will grow
out of the critical analysis and study of the
facts through active methods.
In 1974, Unesco's General Conference
adopted a Recommendation concerning
education for international understanding,
co-operation and peace and education rela-
Understanding and respect for all
peoples, their cultures, civilizations,
values and ways of life, including their
ethnic cultures, are among the guiding
principles adopted by Unesco for
education at all levels for mutual
comprehension and international
peace. Within the Associated Schools
System, pupils and teachers are free to
select a culture which they find of
special interest and to set up special
projects, of varying duration, for its
study. The pupils of the
Comprehensive Girls' High School,
Sargodha, Pakistan, decided, for
example, to study Japanese culture
customs and traditions with which
they are now thoroughly familiar.
Above, teachers and pupils are seen
during the traditional Japanese tea
ceremonial. The history, religions and
arts of India form the subject of the
special project set up at Northmead
Primary School, Lusaka, Zambia.

song on an Indian musical instrument.
The teachers of the Girls' Primary
School, Birkirkara, Malta, selected a
series of themes or "centres of
interest" concerning Greek culture.
The girls divided themselves up into I
groups to study Greek writing, arts I
and crafts, theatre and dance (bottom

ting to human rights and fundamental free¬
doms. This text sets forth seven guiding
principles: an international dimension and a
global perspective in education at all levels
and in all its forms; understanding and res¬
pect for all peoples, their cultures, civiliza¬
tions, values and ways of life, including
domestic ethnic cultures and cultures of
other nations; awareness of the increasing
global interdependence between peoples
and nations; abilities to communicate with
others; awareness not only of the rights but
also of the duties incumbent upon indivi¬
duals, social groups and nations towards
each other; understanding of the necessity
for international solidarity and co-operation;
readiness on the part of the individual to
participate in solving the problems of his
community, his country and the world at
large.
This list illustrates the range and possibili¬
ties of education for international understan¬
ding which, according to the same recom¬
mendation, should focus mainly on the follo¬
wing themes: equality of rights of peoples,
and the right of peoples to self-
determination; the maintenance of peace;
action to ensure the exercise and obser¬
vance of human rights, including those of
refugees; racism and its eradication; the
fight against discrimination in its various
forms; economic growth and social develop¬
ment and their relation to social justice; colo¬
nialism and decolonization; ways and means
of assisting developing countries; the strug¬
gle against disease, illiteracy and famine; the
fight for a better quality of life... the use,
management and conservation of natural
resources, pollution of the environment; the
preservation of the cultural heritage of man¬
kind; the role and methods of action of the
United Nations system...
' The recommendation shows that the
study of human rights is necessarily central
to the education which is being advocated.
In the last analysis, our work for peace,
disarmament and justice will always be
based on respect for Human Rights.
Ever since its early days the Associated
Schools system has had an eventful ex¬
istence and has been involved in many
pioneering experiments both in teaching
methods and content, including such
modern educational techniques as group
activities, projects and educative games.
In some cases there have been efforts to
involve parents, former pupils, and cultural
organizations in the system, and to promote
co-operation with school television and
radio.
This does not imply that all the problems
have been solved, especially those concer¬
ning evaluation and interdisciplinarity. But it
is now an established fact that States are
interested in incorporating education for
international understanding into their educa¬
tional systems on equal (if not preferential)
terms with other objectives. It is impossible
to ignore the contribution of the Associated
Schools system and, above all, to believe
that education with an international outlook,
if it is too searching, can be prejudicial to
national interests. National and international
values are not antagonistic, they comple¬
ment each other. No one has the right to
deprive today's young people, who are pre¬
paring to shape the twenty-first century, of
the knowledge, the critical approach and the
attitudes they will need and on which
human survival may hinge. paui Morren

I have a suggestion-request that some

KEEP IT SIMPLE
Sir,
I am thirteen years old, am in my se¬
cond year at secondary school, and this
year became a regular subscriber to the
Unesco Courier. I find it a good magazine
with a great deal of interesting information
about the world and its problems.
I have, however, a criticism to make. It
seems to me that the Unesco Courier \s ad¬
dressed to an intellectual elite. If you want
your magazine to be widely read and ap¬
preciated by as many people as possible,
you should write in a simpler fashion so that
it will be clearly understandable to young
people.
I hope that you will appreciate and act
on my proposal for your very instructive

DAMS OF ANCIENT EGYPT
Sir,
On page 15 of the February-March 1980
issue of the Unesco Courier a comment on a
photograph of the High Dam hydroelectric
plant at Aswan states that the barrage built
by King Menés at Kosheisha (as pronounc¬
ed locally); was for supplying his capital
Mempihls with water. However, in an article
in the American engineering review
Engineering News Record, Vol. 87, No.14,
page 556 (October 1921), under the title
"Some Dams of the Ancients", reference
was made to this barrage as reported by
Herodotus who pointed out that its purpose
was to divert the Nile waters, presumably
during floods, away from Memphis. The
scanty remains of the barrage as well as the
topography and configuration of its site
substantiate this viewpoint. Besides, the
neglect of the barrage in later centuries
caused the flood water to invade the city,
then deserted, and many of its fallen
monuments were covered with river mud.
Among these monuments is the colossal
statue of Ramses II now erected at Ramses
Square in Cairo.
It may be of interest in this respect to
note that another dam of these ancient
periods was built not very far from the
Menés barrage. This time the dam was a
storage dam to keep the flood waters im¬
pounded in the Fayum depression from
receding back to the main river. The dam,
discovered by Dr. Schweinfurt in 1885, had
unlimited economic benefits on the Fayum
area, as reported by Maspero in the above-
mentioned article.
Finally, one may wonder how the an¬
cient dam builders achieved skills and
design practices that in many cases are
comparable with current concepts.

Von Ditfurth
Receives
Kalinga Prize
¥ N a ceremony this summer Unesco
Director-General Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow presented the Kalinga Prize for
the popularization of science to
Dr. Hoimar von Ditfurth, scientist,
writer and television personality from
the Federal Republic of Germany.
Mr. M'Bow noted that the prize had
been established in 1951 by an Indian
industrialist, Mr. Betjayanak Patnaik.
He had been inspired to do so by the
example of the Emperor Asoka, ruler of
the Kalinga empire in India, who more
than 20 centuries ago had renounced the
use of force and conquest and turned
instead to the pursuit of knowledge and
. the welfare of his subjects.
Dr. von Ditfurth, the Director-General
added, was a specialist who had the
ability not only to explain to the layman
the substance of new scientific
knowledge but also to make clear its
impact on everyday life. Himself a
scientist, he had exploited to the full the
potential of not only books, newspapers
and magazines, but also radio and
television, particularly since 1969 when
he had resigned his post as director of
psycho-pharmacological research in a
large pharmaceutical firm in order to
devote his full time to explaining science
in popular terms.

Communications development in Africa
discussed at Unesco Conference
A N Intergovernmental Conference on
-** Communication Policies in Africa,
was held in Yaounde, Cameroon, from
22 to 31 July.
In his opening address to the
conference, Unesco Director-General
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow analysed
trends and practices in communication
in Africa and in the world, stressing the
opportunity put before humanity by the
prodigious progress of science and
technology in this field.
A universal effort of wisdom could
ensure that communication became a
factor of dignity, justice, peace and
solidarity among nations as well as an
instrument of reciprocity, liberty and
equality, he said.
Stressing the importance of international
co-operation at the regional and sub-
regional levels, the Director-General
underlined the role of the Organization
of African Unity in undertaking a
project to which all wished a brilliant
future: the creation of a pan-African
press agency.
Newly independent Zimbabwe was
represented for the first time at a
Unesco meeting when Mr. Justin
Nyoka, secretary-general of the Ministry
of Information and Tourism, attended
the Yaounde conference.
"It is through a hard struggle that
Zimbabwe has won the right to make its
voice heard in an international
conference," Mr. M'Bow told the
meeting. "Its presence here among us
marks a new setback for apartheid".
Cameroon President Ahmadou Ahidjo
said the work of the conference met a
vital necessity felt by all people of
goodwill: that of reducing the
imbalances and historical dependencies
in the field of information and
communication and of constructing a
new system of international relations
based on equality between peoples and
solidarity between nations.
The Yaounde Conference was the third
in a series on communication policies in
regions around the world; one for Latin
America and the Caribbean was held in
Costa Rica in 1976, and another for
Asia and Oceania in Malaysia in 1979.
Upper Volta Choral

yy ITH the assistance of the
TT International Fund for the
Promotion of Culture, the Chorale
Naaba Sanom of Upper Volta presented
a concert this summer at Unesco. The
programme of traditional songs and
dances was enthusiastically received.
1500th Anniversary of the Hegira
HT O mark the beginning of celebrations of the
-*- 1500th anniversary of the Hegira, Unesco organized a series of
public lectures on Islam, philosophy and science at headquarters
this summer.
The first, on tolerance in prophetic action, was delivered by
Professor Hamidullah, a researcher at the French Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Paris, and author
of several well-known works on the history of Islamic culture.
Professor Jolivet, of the Paris Ecole Pratique des Hautes
Etudes, examined the development of philosophy and its
relationship with Islam in the centuries preceding Avicenna, and
Professor Jacques Berque, of the Collège de France, spoke on
innovation in modern day Islam. Professor Rashed, a CNRS
researcher, analysed the relationship between Islam and the
development of scientific thought, showing that Islamic society
was the principal centre of scientific production until the 9th
century of the Hegira (the 15th century of the Christian era).

Unesco Helps Brazil
with Post-graduate
Chemistry Training
T J NESCO has been entrusted with the
*^ execution, in Brazil, of a project for high
level university training in chemistry at the
State University of Campinas to which UNDP
financial assistance amounting to $840,000 has
been allocated.
The purpose of the project is to develop a post¬
graduate programme of training for research
scientists and teachers at the university's
Institute of Chemistry. The Campinas
University is an important Latin American
university which has grown rapidly. Twelve
years after its creation, it is today training staff
for most of the major universities in Brazil as
well as for some establishments abroad.
It has been set up in a region of Brazil where
there are many industrial enterprises which vary
in size, some of which are still obliged to make
use of qualified foreign personnel. Hence the
importance of training high level chemists who
in turn will train other specialists or who will
work in these firms and thus reduce Brazil's
dependence on foreign expertise. Students at
the Institute will receive training adapted to the
particular requirements of the region.
The project encourages training and research in
fields of special interest to developing countries
(such as the detection and prevention of
tropical diseases such as Chagas disease and
schistosomiasis) and in areas of more general
concern (such as the development of fossil fuel
and alternative energy resources).

4 impact' ' Spotlights Bias Against Women Scientists

of apartheid is the segregation of
women from men. ... There is not a
national society in which the
attempt is not made to force the

"The ugly concept of sexual segregation
continues to thrive even among the
educated men and women operating in
the varied domains of science and
technology. " Vol. 30, No. 1.
How many would do so willingly,
reliably, and democratically? The
answers lie in the questions
themselves."
With these words in a leading
editorial, the journal "Impact of
Science on Society" opens the third
issue it has consecrated to the
problems of women in science. This
most recent issue (Vol. 30, No. 1)
contains articles by women
technicians from nine countries:
Algeria, Burma, Costa Rica,
Hungary, Mali, Mexico, New
Zealand, Peru and Romania.
Among the subjects covered: The
historical status of women in Peru;
African traditions and the Mali
woman; Women scientists and
engineers in Burma; Women
technical graduates in Hungary;
Today's woman and mass
communication; Women scientists
in New Zealand why so few ?
Science, development and women's
emancipation.
A tenth contribution entitled
"Whither women's rights?"
presents the results of a survey on
the question carried out by 20 well-
known journalists seven of them
women in 16 countries.
Action Urged to Solve Problems
of Rural Youth in Latin America
T SOLATION, poverty, exploitation,
lack of work and access to land,
cultural segregation, non-participation
in decision-making these are some of
the major problems facing rural young
people in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
Experts from the region taking part in a
recent Unesco meeting in Bridgetown,
found that the problems of rural youth
were part and parcel of the broader
national and international problems
facing their countries. As such, they
required solutions which could only be
found in structural change, which the
experts defined as "economic, social,
political and cultural transformation
both of the role of the region within the
world community and of the different
national societies within the region
itself."
The focal point of this transformation,
they said, should be "genuine agrarian
reforms that eliminate poverty and
achieve a just redistribution not only of
land but also of economic and political
power."
The Bridgetown meeting also called on
governments of the region to formulate
and implement comprehensive national
youth policies to promote "young
people's active, conscious and critical
participation in development." Far-
reaching educational reforms were also
required, the participants noted, with
the special aim of linking education
much more closely than at present to
socio-economic realities, particularly
productive labour."
While recognizing the paramount
responsibility of governments for work
with rural young people, the meeting
also stressed the important role of
national and international non¬
governmental organizations in detecting
problems and experimenting with
solutions.
A New
Instrument
for Electronic
Music
TH HE keyboard resembles that of a
teletype machine rather than a piano
or organ, but it's actually a musical
instrument the S-52, built by a Swiss
electronics firm according to the
theories laid down by Alain Daniélou in
his book "La Sémantique Musicale".
With a range of eight octaves divided
into 52 intervals each, the instrument
was demonstrated by Daniélou at
Unesco during the Composers' Rostrum
of the International Music Council.
Intended principally as a research tool
for the study and analysis of non-
European music, it can also be used for
experimental work in contemporary
composition.
