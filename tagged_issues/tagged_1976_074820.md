### 49460: UNESCO's early years
UNESCO'S
EARLY YEARS
by Julian Huxley
Unesco's first Director-General {I946-1948}
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the
foundation of Unesco. Born at the end of the
Second World War, on 4 November 1946, Unesco
has seen its membership grow from 20 countries
in 1946 to 136 today. On the one hand, this issue
focuses attention on Unesco's early years and its
first Director-General, Julian Huxley, who died on
14 February 1975. On the other hand it presents a
Unesco perspective on some of the major problems
of the world today. The August-September double
issue will present Unesco's 30 years of activity
in comic strip form.
My two and a half years incharge of Unesco affairs
were the most exciting period of my
life, but I must say also the most
exhausting.
It all started only through the acci-
dent of Sir Alfred Zimmern's sudden
illness early in 1945 when he was Sec-
retary of the Preparatory Commission
for Unesco. It was only because of
this that I was officially asked to take
over the Secretaryship of the Pre-
paratory Commission in London.
In spite of this, I didn't feel suitable
and when I entered the Commission's
office, I fe ! t, as) wrote in my diary at
the time, like the headmaster of a
school who is also its youngest pupil.
After settling down, I took a fortnight
off to write a pamphlet entitled :
"Unesco, its Purpose and its Philo-
sophy"to clarify my own thinking and,
I hoped, that of the delegates in the
forthcoming first General Confe-
rence (see passages from this docu-
ment, page 14). This was to be held in
Paris in December 1946 and would
decide the main outlines of Unesco's
policy. and programme and also elect
its first Director-General.
As it turned out, the humanist atti-
tude which I adopted in this pamphlet
led various delegates, quite er-
roneously, to think that I was anti-
religious, while my liberal views were
taken by others as communist.
While still in London, I had recruited
a number of the staff who would be
needed in Paris whoever was appointed
as Director-General. These included
such figures as Joseph Needham, emi-
nent both as biologist, historian of
science and, authority on Chinese
affairs-he was to head Unesco's
Natural Sciences Department ; the
cultured Jean Thomas, as Deputy
Director-General and the many-sided
Professor Pierre Auger,. as a physicist,
both of France.
We started work in January 1947 in
the Hotel Majestic, which had been the
Nazis'Paris Headquarters during the
Second World War. Ironically enough,
I, as Director-General of an Organi-
zation dedicated to peace, the promo-
tion of knowledge and culture, occu-
pied the room which had harboured
the very unpeacefd. repressive Nazi
Commandant.
The preamble of Unesco's Constitu-
tion, beautifully written by the Ameri-
can scholar-poet Archibald MacLeish,
proclaimed that Unesco was primarily
dedicated to peace-though through
education, science. and culture-and I
had often to defend projects that were
not specifically concerned with peace
by maintaining that the promotion of
education, science and culture, espe-
cially when involving the exchange of
ideas and personnel between different
regions was Unesco's primary task
and could and would indirectly te. ad to
peace through better mutual under-
standing.
In education, Unesco's first job was
obviously to promote literacy in a
largely illiterate world, but we soon
found that literacy in the customary
sense was not enough. Besides learn-
ing to read, write and do simple arith-
metic, the large mass of underprivi-
leged people needed to be educated
in hygiene, in improved methods of
agriculture and better care of their
environment. This comprehensive pro-
gramme we called"fundamental edu-
cation". It proved very valuable in our
early stages by lifting underprivileged
peoples to. a decent minimum of intel-
lectual and physical advance.
Later, the phrase"fundamental edu-
cation. was dropped and there were
separate projects for health, in con-

### 49460: UNESCO's early years
It is in the nature of things that all wars are waged against children. Some suffer
indirectly and others lose their lives, their limbs or their sight, like this young
Italian boy, blind and armless after a hand grenade explosion, here learning
to read Braille with his iips. One of Unesco's urgent post-war tasks was
educational reconstruction. It promoted emergency school-building programmes,
the preparation and distribution of textbooks and the standardization
of Braille systems and took many other steps to meet the immense
needs of children in war-torn countries.
It has also helped in conjunction with
the United Nations and its Specialized
Agencies in setting up the International
Biological Programme, which is at the
present moment surveying human
health-as wealth-and the conserva-
tion, and better utilization of the world's
biological resources.
junction with the World He, alth Orga-
nization, for general education, for
science, for population control, for
exchange of persons and for conser-
vation-a ! ! co-ordinated by the Techni-
cal Assistance Department of the
United Nations.
Besides this, there were numerous
non-governmental associations con-
cerned with different aspects of
Unesco's work. Some were alre, ady
in existence before 1945, like the Inter-
national Museums Office, which
I, as Secretary to the Preparatory
Commission, agreed should be affi-
liated to Unesco, helping Unesco with
advice, benefiting by grants or visits
by specialists financed by Unesco.
Others had to be deliberately
created, sometimes in thee face of
considerable opposition. This was the
case with the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature, IUCN for
short, consisting of specialists in eco-
logy, in establishing reserves to pro-
tect unspoiled scenery, rare and inte-
resting plants and animals and in pre-
venting pollution and unp !. anned urban
spread.
Many delegates to the Conference,
which we held at Fontainebleau in
1948, thought that preserving wild life
and the like was outside Unesco's
province, as it did not specifically
promote peace. But eventually, the
conference agreed to the formation of
the Union and its affiliation with
Unesco. I may add that the Union,
both on its own and with grants from
or personnel financed by Unesco has
achieved a great deal in preserving
much of the world's beauty and its
interesting plant and animal inhabi-
tants, though there is still much to be
done.
As regards Science, we found that
the scientists in one country in a given
region, like the Middle East, were often
more ignorant of the work of scientists
in other countries of their own region
than of the work of leaders of science
in more developed countries.
The Regional Centres for Science
established by Unesco put local scien-
tists in touch with each other so that
they could apportion research in rela-
tion to the area's need, and they also
put them in touch with world science
by the information we provided.
We also set up a scheme for the
exchange of individual experts ; post-
graduate students to work in the scien-
tifically more advanced countries ;
specialists to advise on projects in
so-called underdeveloped nations ;
exhibitions in world centres for artists

in different regions ; visits by eminent
lecturers, and so forth.
In visual arts, we set up two special
projects. One was a catalogue of good
reproductions of well-known paintings
with miniature coloured photographs
of the originals and prices of the re-
production. This has proved extremely
useful in schools in many countries.
The other was the publication of large
folio volumes illustrating little known
works of painting and architecture and
sculpture, such as the cave paintings
of Ceylon and India. These were
more valuable to specialists but cer-
tainly disseminated knowledge and ap-
preciation which was otherwise un-
available.
I badly wanted to set up. a powerful
organization concerned with population
control in association with the U. N.
and, I hoped, its other Specialized
Agencies ; but religious and nationalist
prejudices permitted only a handful of
experimental projects. Today, I'm
thankful to say, not only Unesco but
the U. N. itself, the World Health Org. a-
nization and also the World Bank are
helping in this, in my opinion, the most
important task facing mankind.
I must mention one final project
suggested to me by Joseph Needham :
the writing and publishing of a world
history which would stress advances
in science and literature, in culture and
the. arts, rather than political changes
and military events, This was adopted,
though against considerable opposi-
tion, by the Unesco General Confer-
ence in Beirut (Lebanon) in 1948, when
my career as Director-General ended.
However, in 1949, Professor Paulo de
Berredo Carneiro of Brazil was ap-
pointed President and myself as Vice-
President of the Commission appointed
to supervise the writing of the work.
Today, the six volumes of the Cultu-
ral and Scientific History of Mankind,
bringing it right up to date, have been
published both in French and English,
numerous other translations have been
arranged and a pocket edition with
fewer illustrations is being published.
I have no hesitation in saying that this
is a valuable achievement (1).
Naturally the scope of Unesco's
activities has been much enlarged and
often redefined in slightly different
terms. I can truthfully say that my
two and half years at Unesco were the
high point of my life, a time when all
my capacities and all my knowledge
and energies were fully involved. I
fervently hope and indeed confidently
expect that Unesco will continue along
the same general lines as a promoter
of cultural advance and mutual under-
standing, but always on the lookout
for new problems and new ways of
tackling them.
From an interview with Sir Julian
Huxley recorded in 1970.
(1) At the end of World War II many of Europe's cities were as devastated
as this street in Sheffield (U. K.) after a bombing raid in 1940. Unesco was set
up immediately after the war with the aim of using the resources of education,
culture and science to contribute to international peace and security. Its
Constitution was signed in London on 16 November 1945 by the representatives
of countries from every continent. (2) Among the signatures on the Constitution
reproduced here are those of A. A. Hekmat () ran), Yuce) (Turkey), Naji al-Asil
(Iraq), E. Letts (Peru), Ellen Wilkinson (U. K.) John A. Beasley (Australia) and
Leon Blum (France). (3) A year later, on 20 November 1946, the opening
session of Unesco's first General Conference was held in the main amphitheatre
of the Sorbonne in Paris. (4) The Conference continued its work until
December 10 at Unesco's provisional headquarters in the Hotel Majestic, Paris.

Conference. On his left is Leon Blum (President of the Conference) and on his

1946 when he was Brazil's representative on the
Unesco Preparatory Commission in London. He
is a member of Unesco's Executive Board and
was its Chairman during 1951-1952. Permanent
delegate of Brazil to Unesco Arom 1946 to 1965,
he led his country's delegation to many sessions
of Unesco's General Conference, of which he
was President in 1962. He has been chairman

consciousness of the unity of mankind
and the need to co-ordinate efforts
towards cultural and social progress
on a world-wide scale."
It is in these words that Julian
Huxley describes in his autobiography,
Memories, the aims of the first pro-
gramme for Unesco which he was
called on to prepare in 1946 as
Secretary of the Organization's Pre-
paratory Commission.
Few indeed, in 1946, were those who
could have taken charge of as bold
and pioneering an enterprise as the
United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
Called on by the educators, scien-
tists and scholars who had created
Unesco, Julian Huxley accepted the
challenge to make the new organization
a living reality. His previous studies,
his work, the whole course of his life
had, in fact, prepared him to perform
the task with brilliant success.
As a schoolboy at Eton, Julian Huxley
was equally attracted to scientific
research and literature. Latin and
Greek interested him as much as
animal life and behaviour, and he
divided most of his free time between
writing poems in these languages,
dissecting insects, and bird-watching.
At 18 he won a scholarship in
zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, By
now he was spending all his spare
time roaming through fields and woods,
notebook and binoculars in hand,
observing the different kinds of birds,
noting their songs and jotting down
descriptions of their nests, their eggs,
and the distinctive characteristics of
their behaviour.
As a young student at Baltic ! he
made the acquaintance of distinguished
Oxford figures in addition to the
teachers with whom he studied exper-
imental embryology, comparative anat-
omy and zoology. While at Oxford he
also won the university poetry prize,
the Newdigate, and bought his first
microscope with the prize money.
In 1909 Julian Huxley attended an
important international gathering held
at Cambridge to celebrate the centen-
ary of Charles Darwin's birth. During
the ceremony, as he tells us in his
autobiography, he thought of his grand-
father, the famous biologist Thomas
Henry Huxley, who had vigorously
defended Darwin's work against the
religious prejudices of those earlier
times.
He resolved there and then to
approach all his studies in a Darwinian
spirit and to devote his major work to
evolutionism, on which he threw much
new light through his own research.
In the same year he published his
first scientific paper, concerning a
protozoan parasite in a freshwater
shrimp, a survivor from the carbon-
iferous epoch 300 million years ago,
which had been found in Tasmania.
Soon afterwards, he was awarded a
scholarship at the Naples Marine Bio-
logical Station, where he was delighted
to discover almost limitless possi-
bilities for research. His first piece
of work, on the tissues of sponges,
was immediately published in the

### 49462: Julian Huxley: scientist, humanist, and lover of nature
As a broadcaster, lecturer and the author of some 40 books-scientific books based on original
research and others on travel. religion, science and politics, popular science, natural history
and poetry-Sir Julian Huxley became known to a wide public. His ability to interpret scientific
and philosophic ideas in a livery style and easily understood terms earned him the award of
the Unesco Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science, in 1953, (See also footnote
page 38). Photo shows Sir Julian at the Kalinga prize-giving ceremony at Unesco's
Paris H. Q. With him (on right) is Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former
chairman of Unesco's Executive Board who later became President of India (1962-1967).
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society. He next turned his attention
to a rare Foraminiferan [a tiny marine
creature] which lived in mud and whose
reproduction process he was the first
to describe. Each individual of this
species divides up into about 500
miniature organisms, each resembling
the parent except that their bodies
are ovoid instead of elongated.
But his most important work at the
Naples Institute concerned Clavellina,
an Ascidian [a jelly-like animal] which
lives attached to rocks in the sea.
When its thorax is cut and left in a
container, it shrinks into an opaque,
formless mass. Only its heart-beat
continues as evidence of normality. If
this formless mass is replaced in clean
water, it redifferentiates, not into a
new thorax but a norma) whote
individual. This remarkable experiment
was the starting point for many others
of a similar kind.
Julian Huxley's stay at the Naples
Institute was an extremely fruitful
period for his biological work. It also
brought him into contact with two
distinguished scientists, Otto Warburg
(later a Nobel Prizewinner) with whom

Photos on this page show
Julian Huxley at three
stages in his long career.
Right, the young zoologist
in his laboratory at Oxford
in the early 1920s.
As Secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942)
Julian Huxley transformed the London Zoo. One of his projects was
to set up a special children's zoo. In photo above, taken in 1938,
a sea lion seems to listen attentively as Julian Huxley chats to
a London zoo-keeper.
After serving as Secretary
of the Preparatory
Commission for Unesco
in 1946, Julian Huxley
was elected Director-
General of the Organization
at its first General
Conference held in Paris
in 1946. Photo right
shows Julian Huxley and
his wife Juliette at a
Unesco function in Paris
in the same year.
 Huxley later worked in his laboratory
at Heidelberg, and E. G. Conklin, an
embryologist at Princeton University.
Huxley now returned to Oxford to
take up a lectureship at Ba) ! io) and a
demonstratorship in the university
Department of Zoology. He gave free
rein to his interests as a naturalist and
spent most of his time in scientific
bird watching.
His first descriptions of the court-
ship ceremonies of certain birds such
as the great crested grebe were
published in 1914 and had a major
impact. Having been struck by the
formalized nature of some of the male
bird's actions, he concluded that they
served to establish an emotional link
between the couple. Julian Huxley's
work on these courtship rituals make
him a pioneer of ethology and a pre-
cursor of Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas
Tinbergen.
In the autumn of 1912 he sailed for
the United States to attend the opening
of the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas
where he had been appointed to the
chair of biology. This appointment
which he took up the following year
gave him the opportunity to get to
know the United States, its universities
and its scientists.
In New York his first visit was to
the famous"fly-room"at Columbia
University, where T. H. Morgan and his
team had just completed their first
great piece of research on Drosophila,
the fruit-fly. One member of the team
was H. J Muller, a future Nobel Prize-
winner, who was to become Huxley's
assistant at the Rice Institute. During
this period he met many noted
American biologists, including E. B. Wil-
son, S. Flexner, Peyton Rous and
Rosa Harrington.
A year after his arrival in Houston,
the First World War broke out. In the
early summer of 1916, Julian Huxley
returned to England to join the army.
His service with the armed forces,
first in England then in Italy, lasted
until the end of the war, when he
retarnu ed to Oxford to take up a fet) ow-
ship in Zoology at New Collage.
Here he continued his research
and teaching, numbering among his
students many who were destined for
a brilliant future in science.
In the time he could spare from his
scientific activities, Julian Huxley read
philosophical and religious works. His
study of Abelard, St. Thomas Aquinas,
St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi and
other saints, mystics and theologians
laid the foundations for the work he
wrote later on the role of religion in
present-day society, Religion without
Revelation.
Immediately after his return to
Oxford at the beginning of 1919, Julian
Huxley proposed to Juliette Baillot, a
charming Swiss girl he had met two
years before. She accepted."This
provoked a whirlwind of happiness in
my heart", he wrote in Memories,"and
I spent much of my time writing to all
my friends and relatives telling them

One of Julian Huxley's
most remarkable
biological discoveries
was made when he
studied the bristle-worm
SBbellB (right) at Lough
Ine (Ireland) in 1934.
His research showed that
headless fragments of
the worm's thorax would
regenerate a complete

brain and its nerves were
needed for this process.

was to last a lifetime.
About this time, Oxford University
prepared to send a scientific ex-
pedition to Spitzbergen in the Arctic
Ocean. Julian Huxley was one of the
organizers and in addition to him, the
expedition included botanists, a geogra-
pher, a geologist and an ecologist.
Julian Huxley's task was to study
Arctic birds and describe their habits.
To his delight he saw species such
as the grey phalarope and the purple
sandpiper for the first time and ana-
lysed their sexual behaviour. Each of
these two species is distinguished by
the reversal of roles between the
sexes : the hen (brightly coloured in
the case of the grey phalarope) takes
the initiative in courtship while the
protectively coloured male broods the
eggs and looks after the young chicks.
The Spitzbergen expedition led to the
foundation of the Oxford Exploration
Society, the first of the British uni-
versity exploration clubs.
In 1925 Julian Huxley left Oxford
to become professor of Zoology at
King's College in London. This move
coincided with a turning point in his
research and his career as a writer.
His mind now turned increasingly to
social problems, to which he applied
the scientific methods which had
proved their worth in his biological
research.
The biologist became a sociologist,
a humanist, an educator anxious to
serve a world in disarray. His
approach was that of a man of science
who recognizes the need for free-
ranging imaginative solutions in dealing
with complex social problems.
The population explosion of modern
times became one of his favourite
themes as a writer and thinker. He
returned to this problem again and
again, demonstrating its gravity and
its implications for mankind. He
expounded his views on family planning
in newspaper articles, lectures and
radio broadcasts which won a wide 
audience.

### 49462: Julian Huxley: scientist, humanist, and lover of nature
) n 1930 he played an active part in
the World Conference of Anglican
bishops at Lambeth Palace in London,
where family planning was a major
topic of discussion. In its final report,
the conference recognized the danger
of over-population and left the practice
of birth control to the conscience of
the individuals concerned.
From a very early age, Huxley had
no belief of any kind in the super-
natural. He thought it possible to
establish a moral system which was
purely scientific in inspiration and
which would be capable of uniting
mankind. In his view, love of God
should be replaced by love of nature
and love of Humanity. His concept
was of a religion without revealed
dogmas, without deities, without heaven
or earth.
To expound his main thoughts on
this subject, he wrote in 1927 a book
of major philosophical importance,
entitled Religion without Revelation.
Apart from his biological works this
is undoubtedly his most important
book. In a collection of lectures entit-
led What Dare I Think ? published in
1931, he returned to many of the
fundamental points he had raised in
the earlier book :"Religion, in the
light of psychological and anthropo-
logical science is seen not as a divine
revelation, but as a function of human
nature... God in the current sense in
which they use the word, is the
creation of man... Almost without
exception, the elements and practices
of the existing world-religions could
be utilized by a religion which, aban-
doning the interpretation in terms of
God, has adopted the scientific out-
look as basis for its theology.
"[This new religion]... can help to kill
fear and to achieve freedom from
the sense of sin. It can reveal to
its adherents unexpected richnesses,
possibilities of their own nature of
which they were ignorant... But it
will never be a real force in human
affairs, unless, in addition to providing
spiritual refuge and solace and the
opportunity of doing miscellaneous
good works, it makes some bold appeal
to the moral sense and the imagination
of humanity...
"Thus, whether looked at from the
human or from the scientific point of
view, a new religion cannot be a
religion of negation, of death, of
asceticism, of resignation. It must be
religion of life... From the point of
view of the individual's inner life, its
message will be that life can be sa-
cramental.
"The apprehension of truth or
beauty ; suffering or sacrifice ; simple
joy and simple health ; love, spiritual
and physical alike ; ecstasy and disci-
pline ; self-surrender and self-control
- the most widely differing aspects of
life can become tinged with transcen-
dent emotion, whereby we feel that
we are greater than we know and
come to experience a new value in
existence... [This religion] can also
help to give life a purpose beyond
itself... Who can doubt that the mo-
tive of work for the continuation of the
race and the increase of its capacities
for achievement and enjoyment could
be charged with religious emotion ?"
This scientific humanism is based
on the evolutionism of Darwin, but in
my view, it has a much closer affinity
with the philosophy of Auguste Comte
and his religion of humanity.
In 1927 H. G. Wells invited Julian
Huxley to join him and his son G. P.
Wells in compiling an encyclopedic of
biology, to be called The Science of
Life. Huxley was to be responsible

Observation of nature and the animal world preoccupied Julian Huxley from his
schooldays to the end of his life. Devoted to the question of conservation of
wildlife and natural habitats, he studied these problems in Africa where he
carried out several missions for Unesco between 1960 and 1971 (see"Unesco
Courier", September 1961). Below, perching happily on one leg, a crane cleans up

### 49463: A Philosophy for UNESCO: selections from a forgotten historic document
In 1946, before Unesco was officially
constituted, Julian Huxley drafted a long
paper entitled"Unesco, its Purpose and its
Philosophy."This document became the
subject of much controversy for its so-called
"anti-religious bias"with the result that the
Unesco Preparatory Commission and the
first General Conference of Unesco withheld
official sponsorship of the text. Below, we
publish salient passages from Huxley's
"Philosophy"which has remained virtually
unknown for the past thirty years. Photo Unesco
t t NESCO-the United NationsEducational, Scientific and Cul-
tural Organization-is by its title
committed to two sets of aims. In the
first place, it is international, and must
serve the ends and objects of the
United Nations, which in the long
perspective are world ends, ends for
humanity as a whole. And secondly it
must foster and promote all aspects of
education, science, and culture, in the
widest sense of those words.
Its Constitution defines these aims
more fully. The preamble begins with
Mr. Attlee's noble words-"since wars
begin in the minds of men, it is in the
minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed.'
It continues by stressing the dan-
gers of ignorance-"ignorance of each
other's ways and ! ives has been a
common cause, throughout the his-
tory of mankind, of that suspicion and
mistrust between the peoples of the
world through which their differences
have all too often broken into war."
It then proceeds to point out that the
late war was made possible by the
denial of certain basic principles-"the
democratic principles of the dignity,
equality and mutual respect of men"-
and by the substitution for them of
"the doctrine of the inequality of men
and races."
From these premises it proceeds to
point out that"the wide diffusion of

### 49463: A Philosophy for UNESCO: selections from a forgotten historic document
HISTORY IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE, The publication of
a six-volume history of the cultural and scientific
development of mankind, produced under Unesco's auspices,
was an unparalleled international achievement. Begun
in 1950, the enterprise took almost 20 years to complete.
Some 1, 000 historians and scientists from many countries
collaborated on this unique collective work which traced
for the first time the evolution of man's
cultural and scientific developments from prehistory to the
present age. This global history stresses advances in culture,
the arts, science, technology and philosophy rather than
political and military history. The History of
Mankind : Cultural and Scientific Development has so far
appeared in English, French, Greek, Serbo-Croat, Slovenian
and Spanish language editions. Photo shows on left,
cover of the Greek edition and on right cover of
Serbo-Croat edition, against the background of the
Unesco Secretariat building in Paris.
culture, and the education of humanity
for justice and liberty and peace, are
indispensable to the dignity of man and
constitute a sacred duty which all the
nations must fulfil in a spirit of mutual
assistance and concern" : and draws
the notable conclusion, never before
embodied in an official document, that
a peace"based exclusively upon the
political and economic arrangements of
governments"would be inadequate,
since it could not"secure the unani-
mous, lasting and sincere support of
the peoples of the world,"and that
"the peace must therefore be founded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind."
And finally, the States which are
parties to the Constitution assert their
belief"in full and equal opportunities
of education for all, in the unrestricted
pursuit of objective truth, and in
the free exchange of ideas and
know ! edge."
They agree"to develop and increase
the means of communication between
their peoples and to employ these
means for the purposes of mutual
understanding and a truer. and more
perfect knowledge of their livens. : and
they"hereby create the United Nations
Education. al, Scientific and Cultural
Organization,"whose purpose is then
specifically laid down as that of"ad-
vancing, through the educational and
scientific and cultural relations of the

'people of the world, the objectives ofinternational peace and of the common
welfare of mankind, for which the
United Nations Organization was
established and which its charter
proclaims."
But in order to carry out its work, an
organization such as Unesco needs
not only a set of general aims and
objects for itself, but also a working
philosophy,. a working hypothesis
concerning human existence and its
aims and objects, which nrill dictate, or
at least indicate, a definite line of
approach to its problems.
From acceptance of certain prin-
ciples or philosophies, Unesco is
obviously debarred. Thus, while fully
recognizing the contribution made to
thought by many of their thinkers, it
cannot base its outlook on one of the
competing theologies of the world...
Neither can it espouse one of the
politico-economic doctrines competing
in the world today to the exclusion of
the others-the present versions of
capitalistic free enterprise, Marxist
communism, semi-socialist p ! anninc,.
and so on.
It cannot do so, partly because it is
contrary to its charter and essence to
be sectarian, partly for the very prac-
tical reason that any such attempt
woutd immediately incur the active
hostility of large and influential groups,
and the non co-operation or even with-
drawal of. a number of nations.
For somewhat similar reasons it
cannot base itself exclusively on any
specia or p. articular philosophy or
outlook. Nor, with its stress on dem-
ocracy and the principles of human
dignity, equality and mutual respect,
can it adopt the view that the State is
a higher or more important end than
the individual ; or any rigid class
theory of society. And in the preamble
to its Constitution it expressly repudi-
ates racialism and any belief in
superior or inferior"races,"nations,
or ethnic groups.
And finally, with its stress on the
concrete tasks of education, science
and culture, on the need for mutual
understanding by the peoples of the
world, and on the objectives of peace
and human welfare on this planet, it
would seem debarred from an exclus-
ively or primarily other-worldly outlook.
Unesco's main concern is with
peace and security and with human
welfare, in so far as they can be
subserved by the educational and
scientific and cultural relations of the
peoples of the world. Accordingly its
outlook must, it seems, be based on
some form of humanism. Further, that
humanism must clearly be a world
humanism, both in the sense of seeking
to bring in all the peoples of the world,
16
and of treating all peoples and all
individuals within each people as
equals in terms of human dignity.
mutual respect, and educational
opportunity.
It must also be a scientific human-
ism, in the sense that the application
of science provides most of the
material basis for human culture, and
also that the practise and the under-
standing of science need to be
integrated with that of other human
activities. It cannot, however, be ma-
terialistic, but must embrace the spiri-
tual and mental as well as the material
aspects of existence, and must attempt
to do so on a truly monistic, unitary
philosophic basis.
Finally it must be an evolutionary as
opposed to a static or ideal humanism.
It is essential for Unesco to adopt an
evolutionary approach. of it does not
do so, its philosophy twill be a false
one, its humanism at best partial, at
worst misleading.
An evolutionary approach provides
the link between natural science and
human history ; it teaches us the need
to think in the dynamic terms of speed
and direction rather than in the static
ones of momentary position or quanti-
tative achievement : it not only shows
us the origin and biological roots of
our human values, but gives us some
basis and external standards for them
among the apparently neutra ! mass of
natural phenomena ; and it is indis-
pensable in enabling us to pick out,
among the chaotic welter of conflicting
tendencies today, those trends and
activities and methods which Unesco
should emphasize and facilitate.
Thus the general philosophy of
Unesco should, it seems, be a scien-
tific world humanism, global in extent
and evolutionary in background.
Evolution in the broad sense de-
notes all the historical processes of
change and development at work in
the universe. It is divisible into three
very different sectors-the inorganic
or lifeless, the organic or biological,
and the social or human. The inorganic
sector is by far the greatest in extent,
comprising the overwhelming bulk of
the cosmos, both of interstellar space
and of the material aggregates we call
stars.
The biological sector is very much
limited in extent, being confined to the
outer surface of the single small planet
Earth, and perhaps to the very few
similar situations in the universe. On
the other hand, with the emergence of
the two basic properties of living
matter-self-reproduction and variation
(mutation)-a quite new and much
more potent method of change became
available to life, in the shape of Natural
Selection. And as a result the possibly 1

 rate of evolution was enormously
speeded up.
Finally there is the human sector.
This is still further restricted in extent,
being confined to the single species,
man. But once more a new and more
efficient method of change is available.
It becomes available to man through
his distinctively human properties of
speech and conceptual thought, just as
Natural Selection became available to
life as a result of its distinctive pro-
perties of reproduction and variation.
Objectively speaking, the new
method consists of cumulative tra-
dition, which forms the basis of that
social heredity by means of which
human societies change and develop.
But the new method also has a sub-
jective aspect of great importance.
Cumulative tradition, like all other
distinctively human activities, is largely
based on conscious processes-on
knowledge, on purpose, on conscious
feeling, and on conscious choice. Thus
the struggle for existence that under-
lies natural selection is increasingly
replaced by conscious selection, a
struggle between ideas and values in
consciousness.
Through these new agencies, the
possible rate of evolution is now once
more enormously speeded up. What
is more, there has so far been a steady
acceleration of the new rate.
Whereas as in lower palaeolithic times,
major change required something of
the order of 106 years, by the late
upper palaeolithic the unit was nearer
104 yearns, and in historic times soon
came down to the century or 1 () 2 years.
During the last hundred years each
decade has seen at least one major
change-if we are to choose ten such,
let us select photography, the theory
of evolution, electro-magnetic theory
with its application in the shape of
electric light and power, the germ
theory of disease, the cinema, radio-
activity and the new theories of matter
and energy, wireless and television,
the internal combustion engine, chemi-
cal synthetics, and atomic fission.
Today, indeed, even the most mo-
mentous changes, such as the disco-
very and practical application of atomic
fission, may take only half a decade,
and there is as yet no sign of the rate
of acceleration slowing down.
Evolution in the human sector
consists mainly of changes in the form
of society, in tools and machines, in
new ways of utilizing the old innate
potentialities, instead of in the nature
of these potentialities, as in the
biological sector.
Man's inherited mental powers
cannot have changed appreciably since
the time of the Aurignacian cave-
dwellers : what have changed are the
ways in which those powers are used,
and the social framework which condi-
tions their use. This is not to say that
what has happened since the Aurign. a-
cian period or since the time of ancient
Greece, is not evolution : it is a very
astonishing bit of evolution.
Nor does it mean that man's innate
mental powers could not be improved.
They certainly were improved (presum-
ably by natural selection) in the
earliest stages of his career, from
Pekin man through the Neanderthalers
to our own species ; and they could
certainly be improved further by delib-
erate eugenic measures, if we con.
sciously set ourselves to improve
them. Meanwhile, however, it is in
social organization, in machines, and
in ideas that human evolution is mostly
made manifest.
But it is not only complexity which
increases with time. In the biological
sector, evolution has led to greater
control over the environment and
greater independence of the changes
and chances of the environment. It
has also promoted a higher degree of
individuality. And this trend is con-
nected with another which has led to
increase of mental powers-greater
capacities for acquiring and organizing
knowledge, for experiencing emotion,
and for exerting purpose.
This last trend, towards fuller knowl-

### 49463: A Philosophy for UNESCO: selections from a forgotten historic document
A PHILOSOPHY FOR UNESCO (Continued from page 18)
edge, richer emotion, and more
embracing purpose, is continued
(though by different methods) in the
human sector, and is continued at a
much increased rate. But to it is
superadded another trend-an increase
in the capacity to appreciate va ! ues. to
appreciate experiences that are of
value in their own right and for their
own sake, to build on knowledge, to
work through purpose, and to inject
ethical values into the process of
social evolution itself.
woe now know much about themeth d of biological evol-
ution : the existence of several quite
different types of selection ; the con-
ditions which promote or retard change ;
the subordinate position of mutation as
against selection in directing the
course of evolution ; the evolutionary
roles of the degree of specialization
and of progress shown by an organism,
of its biological environment, and of its
physical environment respectively, and
the interaction between them ; the
evolutionary conflict between the limi-
tations set by an organism's nature and
past history and the requirements of
the present, and its solution by means
of some new adjustment-or its lack
of solution, followed by extinction.
This last point immediately recalls
the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis of
Hegelian philosophy, and the Marxist
'reconciliation of opposites"b, ased
upon it. Indeed, dialectical materialism
was the first radical attempt at an
evolutionary philosophy. Unfortunately
it was based too exclusively upon
principles of social as against bio-
logical evolution, and in any case was
undertaken too pearly. before either the
facts or their analysis were able to sup-
port any such vast superstructure.
Today it is possible, at least to begin
the construction of a comprehensive
philosophy of evolution ; and many of
its conclusions will be of value in
formulating details of Unesco's own
philosophy.
For it is of major importance that
biology has enabled us to detect a
direction in evolution as a whole, and
not merely within the small domain of
human life, to which the term progress
can properly be applied.
This evolutionary progress, we find,
is directed towards an increase of the
following characteristics : throughout
evolution, an increase in complexity of
organization ; on this, in the biological
and human sectors, is superposed a
more important trend towards greater
control over and greater independence
of the environment, and, in later
phases, one towards an increase of
mental capacities ; and finally, in the
human sector alone, an increase in
the understanding and attainment of
intrinsic values, which now in its turn
becomes the most important charac-
teristic of progress. Throughout, prog-
ress has the further characteristic of
always permitting further progress,
never shutting the door on later
advance.
Of special importance in man's
evaluation of his own position in the
cosmic scheme and of his further
destiny is the fact that he is the heir,
and indeed the sole heir, of evolution-
ary progress to date. When he asserts
that he is the highest type of organism,
he is not being guilty of anthropo-
centric vanity, but is enunciating a
biological fact.
Furthermore, he is not merely the
sole heir of past evolutionary progress,
but the sole trustee for any that may
be achieved in the future. From the
evolutionary point of view, the destiny
of man may be summed up very
simply : it is to realize the maximum
progress in the minimum time. That
is why the philosophy of Unesco must
have an evolutionary background, and
why the concept of progress cannot
but occupy a central position in that
philosophy.
The analysis of evolutionary prog-
ress gives us certain criteria for
judging the rightness or wrongness of
our aims and activities, and the desir-
ability or otherwise of the tendencies
to be noted in contemporary history-
tendencies of which Unesco must take
account.
Thus mere increase of our control
over nature is not to be valued for
itself, yet appears to be a necessary
foundation for future progress. Put
in a way more closely affecting
Unesco's programme, research may be
perverted, and its material applications
may be over-valued ; yet without them
we shall not advance. This conclusion
applies a fortiori to mere complexity
of social organization.
Again, even knowledge that appears
to be wholly beneficent can be applied
in such a way that it does not promote
progress. Thus, the application of
medical science may increase the
number of human beings in a given
area but lower their quality or their
opportunities for enjoyment of life ;
and if so, in the light of our basic
criterion of evolutionary direction, it
is wrong.
We are brought by a new route to
realize once more the need for a
Unesco policy balanced between many
fields-in this instance, Unesco policy
would have to include, besides
the application of medical science,
studies on agricultural productivity
(soil erosion, mechanization, etc.) and
on social welfare, and also the pro-
vision of birth-control facilities.
In general, Unesco must constantly
be testing its policies against the
touchstone of evolutionary progress.
A central conflict of our times is that
between nationalism and international-
ism, between the concept of many
national sovereignties and one world
sovereignty. Here the evolutionary
touchstone gives an unequivocal ans-
wer. The key to man's advance, the
distinctive method which has made
evolutionary progress in the human
sector so much more rapid than
in the biological and has given it
higher and more satisfying goals, is
the fact of cumulative tradition, the
existence of a common pool of ideas
which is self-perpetuating and itself
capable of evolving. And this fact has
had the immediate consequence of
making the type of social organization
the main factor in human progress or
at least its limiting framework.
Two obvious corollaries follow.
First, that the more united man's tra-
dition becomes, the more rapid will
be the possibility of progress : several
separate or competing or even mutually
hostile pools of tradition cannot poss-
ibly be so efficient as a single pool
common to all mankind. And secondly,
that the best and only certain way of
securing this will be through political
unification.
As history shows, unifying ideas
can exert an effect across national
boundaries. But, as history makes
equally evident, that effect is a partial
one and never wholly offsets the
opportunities for conflict provided by
the existence of separate sovereign
political units,
THE moral for Unesco is clear.The task laid upon it of promot-
ing peace and security can never be
wholly realized through the means
assigned to it-education, science and
culture. It must envisage some form
of world political unity, whether through
a single world government or other-
wise, as the only certain means for
avoiding war.
However, world political unity is,
unfortunately, a remote ideal, and in
any case does not fall within the fief. : J
of Unesco's competence. This does
not mean that Unesco cannot do a
great deal towards promoting peace
and security. Specifically, in its
educational programme it can stress
the ultimate need for world political
unity and familiarize all peoples with
the implications of the transfer of full
sovereignty from separate nations to
a world organization.
But, more generally, it can do a great
deal to lay the foundations on which

introduction to the findings

survey the major problems c
of Unesco's fields of intere
economic order.
tj HE present situation in theworld and the outlook for 
last quarter of the 20th century
seem to me to show that Unesco, as
it attains its 30th year, has just as
important a mission to fulfil as when
it was founded at the end of the
Second World War.
Unesco's original and essential
function, which ultimately is an ethical
one, is still in fact to contribute to
peace by promoting international co-
operation in education, science, cul-
ture and communication.
The dangers to which world peace
is exposed are in evidence every day.
But we know, too, that there are other
threats, in some cases resulting from
the very powers which science and
technology have given to mankind :
natural resources are being exploi-
ted without order or control, our envi-
ronment is deteriorating, the inequali-
ties between countries or groups of
countries, and indeed within certain
countries, are becoming intolerable,
and misunderstandings between cul-
tures are deepening despite, or per-
haps even because of, the rising flood
of information, which sometimes looks
as if it is going to submerge us.
I am therefore convinced that, to
ward off these dangers, it is essential
to engage in a joint, wor) d-wide effort
of reflection on where our civilizations
are heading.
Unesco has a duty to take part in
this reflection in depth, which should
be its foremost obligation. Unesco's
particular vocation as an international
organization is to be a forum for those

skills-which Unesco can secure from
the international community only if it
is a lively centre for carrying out
studies and pooling ideas-the actual
work involved in promoting develop-
ment affords opportunities for intellec-
tual and cultural exchanges, so that
eventually no fundamental difference
between intellectual co-operation and
operational action can be clearly dis-
cerned.
But above all, I am convinced that
the problem of development is insep-
arable from a whole complex of matters
considered as relating to intellectual
life, We cannot accept the picture,
inspired by a facile idealism, of
Unesco on the one hand devoting
some of its efforts to scientific and
cultural co-operation and the world of
ideas, in the hope that such co-oper-
ation will further the spirit of peace in
the world, and on the other addressing
itself to the task of improving the
situation of the least privileged.
The distinguishing feature of the
world today seems to me, on the
contrary, to be the close interdepen-
dence between all its parts, wall the
regions composing it, all the human
groups living in it. Development is
therefore not a problem peculiar to a
certain number of countries. It is a
world problem, because its significance
is something involving a global com-
plex of relationships and mechanisms,
a certain kind of order or disorder.
It is a concept applicable alike to
the prospects of the industrialized
countries, wondering about the future
of their growth and its effects on living
conditions, and to the longing for a
better life in the countries of the Third
Wor ! d.
It is a unifying concept in the
domain of theory, even though it may
cover the most serious disparities
between human groups and between
individuals, and as such, more than
any other, it implicitly calls for human
solidarity, that solidarity whose ab-
solute necessity I stressed on taking
office as Director-General of Unesco,
pointing out that it presupposes not
only the acceptance of differences
between individuals and between
cultures but also concerted efforts to
achieve justice and progress for all.
I have dwelt on the question of
development in this way partly no
doubt because it is central to our
preoccupations, but also because it
appears to me to provide an excellent
illustration of some of the major
problems affecting the future of
mankind and necessitating a concerted
approach on the part of the inter-
national community if they are to be
solved.

Ware now undergoing aWW period of profound and rapid.
though uneven, and not infrequently
crisis-ridden change. This change is
largely connected with the ever-increa-
sing power available to man through
the development of science and
technology.
The roots of the crises lie, however,
in the crucial sphere of social relations
which to a considerable degree are
still not sufficiently adapted to cope
with the rapidity of change caused by
science and technology.
Technology is ambivalent. On the
one hand it has brought immense bene-
fits to mankind. On the other, it has
resulted in an incredible accumulation
of destructive devices. Furthermore,
the contradictions inherent in the
transfer of technology from the indus-
trial centres to the developing areas
of the world have brought very serious
maladjustments and disruptions. In-
equalities have been accentuated and
an extraordinary demographic growth
is taking place.
One thino is bevond doubt : none of
today and tomorrow can be solved
successfully if the conditions of peace
are not ensured, if the relaxation of
international tension is not transfor-
med into an irreversible process, and
if the enormous resources, today still
tied up with armaments, are not
gradually released for human dev-
elopment.
Efforts for the consolidation of
peace, which is to be understood as
a just and democratic system of inter-
national relations based on the prin-
ciples of peaceful coexistence and not
simply as the absence of war, should
be expanded in all spheres, from
economics to science, from diplomacy
to culture.
Annual expenditure on the arms race
is probably around 200 to 250 billion
dollars-a sum equal to the total natio-
nal income of those countries in which
the majority of mankind is living. At
the same time twenty-five hundred
million men and women live a largely
precarious existence at levels of nutri-
tion below the acceptable minimum.

### 49466: The Roots of a growing world crisis
The present growth-rate of these
populations is such that their number
is expected to double in 25 years.
The currently accessible resources
of the earth have their limits. Within
the space of a few generations we
are frittering away reserves of energy
be ! ow the ground which nature has
taken thousands of millions of years
to accumulate.
In the immediate future there is a
danger that we shall destroy, without
a thought for future generations, the
plants and trees produced over the
ages. In the last 50 years, nine-tenths
of the forests of some tropical islands
have disappeared. Many forests are
being ravaged by the paper industry,
on which the press of several indus-
trialized countries, as well as certain
other industries and commercial
interests make excessive demands.
The equatorial forest is being
attacked in turn. The future is also
being jeopardized through the excessi-
vely primitive exploitation of natural
resources by famished groups of
human beings. Their pressing needs
are destroying resources which, if
exploited rationally, would help to
ensure future progress.
Under the pressure of either justi-
fied or artificial imperatives designed
to maintain economic growth, increase
consumption or satisfy it without
heeding the consequences, today's
generations are plundering and pollu-
ting nature and condemning future
generations, tomorr-""-.. __. 1...------

would indicate that the"Western
model of development"cannot be
applied everywhere or at all times.
A plan of progress based on the Wes-
tern model until now considered by
some groups as capable of extension
all over the world, is henceforth faced
with fundamental contradictions.
In some societies where they are
firmly established, industrialization and
technology deprive individuals and
groups of the possibility of influencing
their living conditions, and hence their
own destiny.
The issue at stake is man's ability
to establish a comprehensible and
creative relationship between himself,
his group and the environment.
Human rights and freedoms are
threatened by multiple intrusions into
private life. As a result of the spread
of computer science and communica-
tion techniques, life is being condi-
tioned on the basis of surveys whose
aims in some cases are to a certain
extent inquisitorial. Thus some of the
industrialized countries must under-
take a new kind of struggle to defend
human rights, the very notion of which
is, an empty promise for the masses
of the developing countries who are
deprived of the most elementary
means of satisfying their needs.
These considerations emphasize the
close interdependence of the prob-
lems facing the modern world. We
are not faced with distinct problems,
each of which we may try to solve
separately and in isolation. We are
dealing with, a complex whole in which
mechanisms or phenomena are
closely interrelated, acting or reacting
on one another. The world must be
considered as a totality or a system
whose parts are organically linked.
A global view must therefore bea prerequ site to any attempt to
solve the different problems of today.
The United Nations declaration on a
New tnternationa ! Economic Order can
be regarded as an event of world-wide
significance attesting to the joint en-
deavours of nations to achieve a
positive settlement of urgent problems
of present-day social and economic
development. The introduction of a
New International Economic Order
obviously concerns not only econo-
mics, but is aiso a matter of social,
scientific, technological and cultural
relevance.
The problems of peace, of human
rights, and of the survival of mankind
are not to be separated from the
problems of development itself. For
this reason we should look beyond
economic development. We must give
up thinking of the centres of econo-
mic power as the sole repositories
of truth, civilization and universality.
It has been held in certain quarters
that industrial growth, modelled on
that of certain European or North
American centres, would itself bring
about a general improvement in human
conditions, each nation being free to
reproduce the proposed pattern for
itself. We must face the fact that
this is not so.
Once it is seen as global, develop-
ment can no longer be the direct
extension to the whole world of the
knowledge, ways of thought, life styles
or experiences specific to a single
region of the world ; each local dev-
elopment must be related to its own
values and culture.
It is not enough to transfer the sum
total of the knowledge available in
developed countries to the developing
countries ; to do this excludes the pos-
sibility of any genuine impl. antation of
science and technology in the coun-
tries at the receiving end. It favours
the"brain drain"and even slows down
the general advancement of knowledge
by depriving the creative imagination
of access to more varied sources than
those on which the existing system
drew.
The immediate problem facing the
developing countries is that of estab-
lishing an infrastructure for science.
As long as this does not exist, as
long as these countries do not possess
their own scientific capability, there
can be no authentic scientific dev-
elopment, but only transplantation of
imported science, which does not cor-
respond to the true needs of the
country.
The kind of scientific development
which does correspond to the needs
of a country can only be based on an
awareness of its civilization, traditions
and values.
Whilst science has been concerned
with discovering knowledge and un-
derstanding nature, its applications
have been largely governed by the
profit motive to the benefit of small
sections of human society-groups or
countries ; and indeed, in this process,
distortions have crept into the priori-
ties for the growth of science itself.
We would also like to draw atten-
tion to the huge sums spent on scien-
tifjc research, half of which at he, ast
are spent on armaments which become
obsolete or cancel one another out
as quickly as possible ; and to the
sums which are spent on stimulating
and attempting to satisfy unnecessary
needs of the consumer system.
An orientation of scientific and
technologic. al development basically
lacking any underlying commitment to
overall social progress has given rise
in many quarters to a feeling of"frus-
tration"and"disillusionment", to a call
for the"containment of science"and
for the"taming"of technology, ultima-
tely resulting in fear and hatred of
science and technology in general.
In actual fact, science is one of the
great creative manifestations of human
genius. What is needed is a new
concept and long-range international
strategy for the development of
science and technology which reflects
overall global social needs-a concept
and strategy that should not and must
not, in their rational advance, become
detached from the basic human orien-
tation and fundamental values of hu-
man life.
With the headlong progress of
science and technology, there are
new developments in the offing whose
implications are of a global nature for
human society as a whole-such as
interference with the genetic code,
deliberate efforts to modify climate,
mass employment of information sys-
tems and storage devices with per-
manent memories, industrial utilization
of micro-organisms, creation of closed
man-nature metabolism cycles and so
on.
CONCERTING questions of sofar-reaching a character, there is
need for a widely based discussion
leading to a global concept and in this
Unesco should play an important role ;
A truly sound concept of the future
of contemporary civilization can only
be based on a parallel development
of man and society on the one hand,
and technology on the other. We are
entering a period in which-without
well-thought-out programmes of social
development, without a purposeful
control of social processes and without
a purposeful shaping of our way of
life-man's socially useful abilities will
be prodigally wasted. We need to
realize that the control of social pro-
cesses is at once the most compre-
hensive and the most difficult task
confronting contemporary science.
Culture is not a luxury reserved for
those whose elementary needs are
satisfied ; it is linked with the organi-
zation of society, and to it society
owes its dynamic force. It is made up
of the wisdom of the illiterate or the
experience handed down through
generations of manual workers as well
as of the highest scholarship. Tradi-
tions which have been forgotten or
destroyed by inconsiderate moderni-
zation are irreparabte ! osses to the
understanding of our destiny.
To over-assert cultural particularities
is just as dangerous as to underrate
them. It is another way of running
the same risks. We must maintain
a constant equilibrium between scien-
ces and cultures, although this is not
enough. It must be matched by an
equilibrium in mutual efforts at com-
prehension, and by incessant adjust-
ments between what different cultures
have to learn from one another.
The processes of education have
clearly to be two-way. No educatio-
na) body can properly transmit what it
knows unless it is sufficiently familiar
with those to whom it is addressing
itself. And since no one can know
everything, mechanisms should be
established to provide balanced
exchanges and thus offset the inequa-

that a foreign language is learned
more easily at school when the pupil
knows how to use his own language.
Even learning of the most difficult kind

It is not to be taken for granted that

it has never yet been attempted.
If it had been possible for such

exist spontaneously, the virtues of
peace, freedom, equality, and human
rights and duties would come just as
naturally to human beings as their
physiological functions.

It can help the peoples of the doric
to mutua ! understanding and to a
res ! ! zation of the common humarlty
and common tasks which they share
as opposed to the nationalisms which
too often tend to isolate and separate
them.
It can promote enterprises which. by
being fully international from the out-
set, demonstrate that nationality and
nationalism can be transcended In
shared activity.
With all this Unesco must face the
fact that nationalism is still the basis
of the political structure of the world,
and must be prepared for the possibility
that the forces of disruption and con-
flict may score a temporary victory.
But even if this should occur, Unesco
must strain every nerve to give a
demonstration of the benefits, spiritual
as well as material, to be obtained
through a common pool of tradition,
and specifically by international co-
operation in education, science, and
culture, so that even should another
war break out, Unesco may survive it,
and in any case so that the world will
not forget.
Our evolutionary analysis shows
clearly enough that a well-developed
human individual is the highest product
of evolution to date. This provides
external and scientific support for the
democratic principle of the dignity of
men, to which by its Constitution
Unesco is committed.
it also constitutes a complete dib'
proof of all theses (...) which maintain
that the State is in some way higher
than the individual, and that the indi-
vidual exists only or primarily for the
State.
The human individual is, quite
strictly, meaningless in isolation ; he
only acquires significance in relation
to some form of society. His develop-
ment is conditioned by the society
into which he is born and the social
traditions which he inherits ; and the
value of the work he does in life
depends on the social framework
which benefits by it or transmits it to
! atertime.
Thus Unesco's activities, while con-
cerned primarily with providing richer
development and fuller satisfactions
for the individual, must always be
undertaken in a social context ; and
many of its specific tasks will be
concerned with the social means
towards this general end-the improve-
ment of social mechanisms or agencies
such as educationa systems, research
organizations, art centres, the press
and so forth.

In 1966 Unesco and the Italian Government launched an international campaign to save Venice,
increasingly threatened by flooding from the sea, which for centuries had brought life and
splendour to the city. The Italian Government called on Unesco's co-operation because of
the complexity and scale of such problems as land subsidence, water and air pottution,
flooding at high tide, deterioration of monuments and buildings, and an exodus of inhabitants due
to economic stagnation. As part of the Venice campaign the Italian Government has obligated about
$475 million for major preservation work,"Save Venice"committees in a number of countries,
acting in co-ordination with Unesco, will be responsible for restoring some of the more seriously
threatened buildings. But an enormous effort will still be needed to save Venice and its countless
masterpieces of art.

### 49463: A Philosophy for UNESCO: selections from a forgotten historic document
A PHILOSOPHY FOR UNESCO (Continued from page 30)
ness, and purpose is the necessary
prerequisite for further major progress
in human evolution. Accordingly,
although political unification in some
sort of world government will be
required for the definitive attainment
of this stage, unification in the things
of the mind is not only also necessary
but can pave the way for other types
of unification.
Thus in the past the great religions
unified the thoughts and attitudes of
large regions of the earth's surface ;
and in recent times science, both
directly through its ideas and indirectly
through its applications in shrinking
the globe, has been a powerful factor
in directing men's thoughts to the
possibilities of, and the need for, futt
world unity,
ESPECIAL attention should conse-quently be given by Unesco to
the problem of constructing a unified
pool of tradition for the human species
as a whole. This, as indicated else-
where, must include the unity-in-variety
of the world's art and culture as well
as the promotion of one single pool of
scientific knowledge.
But it must also eventually include
a unified common outlook and a com-
mon set of purposes. This will be the
tartest part of the task of unifying the
world mind ; but Unesco must not
neglect it while engaged on the easier
jobs, like that of promoting a single
pool of scientific knowledge and effort.
From this global aim, another prin-
ciple immediately follows. It is that
Unesco should devote special attention
to the levelling up of educational,
scientific and cultural facilities in all
backward sectors where these are
below the average, whether these be
geographical regions, or under-privi-
leged sections of a population. To
use another metaphor, it must attempt
to let in light on the world's dark areas.
The reason for this is plain. For
one thing it will be impossible for
humanity to acquire a common outlook
if large sections of it are the illiterate
inhabitants of a mental world entirely
different from that in which a fully
educated man can have his being, a
world of superstition and petty tribalism
in place of one of scientific advance
and possible unity.
Thus mass campaigns against illit-
eracy and for a common fundamental
education must form part of Unesco's
programme. Further, a satisfactory
common scale of values can obviously
not be attained so long as large
sections of mankind are preoccupied
with the bare material and physiologi-
cal needs of food, shelter, and health.
Again, science will not achieve its
optimum rate of advance, either in
research or in its application, until its
light is more evenly shed over the dark
surface of the world's ignorance, so
as to provide a more equable distri-
bution of scientists, of apparatus, and
(equally important in the long run) of
popular understanding of science.
With art and the appreciation of
beauty, much of the"dark area"is
differently situated-in the centres of
industry and among the proletariat of
industrially advanced sections. But
the task of lightening the dark spots
in this field is no less urgent than in
education or in science.
Furthermore, social mechanisms
must be constructed in the right way
if they are to provide the basis for
realizing the right values and for
providing individuals with the fullest
opportunities and satisfactions.
An educational system, for instance,
can just as readily be made to promote
the idea of a chosen race or of a
privi : eged caste as it can that of the
dignity of men and the equality of
their opportunity.
A scientific system can be based on
secrecy and focussed on war or on
economic rivalry ; or it can be focussed
on increasing human knowledge and
human welfare, and founded on
freedom.
A mass-production system can
indirectly destroy creative initiative
and aesthetic appreciation, and lead to
apathy or escapism, as readily as it
can be made to function directly to
produce for real human needs.
Thus broad studies of various social
mechanisms and their effects, conduc-
ted in the light of some general
philosophy, will necessarily form part
of Unesco's programme.
F FINALLY we come to a difficultproblem-that of discovering
how we can reconcile our principle of
human equality with the biological fact
of human inequality. Perhaps the
problem is not so difficult as it appears
when stated in this paradoxical form ;
for the contradiction largely disap-
pears as soon as it is realized that
equality is used in two very different
senses.
The democratic principle of equality,
which is also Unesco's, is a principle
of equality of opportunity-that human
beings should be equal before the
law, should have equal opportunities
for education, for making a living, for
freedom of expression and movement
and thought. The biological absence
of equality, on the other hand, con-
cerns the natural endowments of man
and the fact of genetic difference in
regard to them.
Concretely, genetic human inequality
is of two types. First, there is the
inequality of mere difference. Some
people are fair, others dark ; some are
tall and thin, others short and stocky ;
some have a natural gift for music,
others for athletics ; some are intro-
spective, others practical and extrovert.
Indeed, we can now definitely state
that no two human beings, with the
single exception of the members of
pairs of identical twins, are biologically
equal in the sense of possessing the
same genetic constitution, so that
biological difference is, for all practical
purposes, universal.
Furthermore, the range and degree
of genetic variety in man is greater
than that to be found in any other
animal species. This is largely due to
one of man's biological peculiarities,
namely that his local differentiation
into races is not continued to the stage
of separate and intersterile species,
as in almost all other organisms, but
has always been followed by migration
and interbreeding. But whatever its
cause, the resultant high degree of
variability is a fact, and one of con-
siderable evolutionary importance.
Secondly, there is difference in qual-
ity or level. Human beings are not
equal in respect of various desirable
qualities. Some are strong, others
weak ; some healthy, others chronic
invalids ; some long-lived, others short-
lived ; some bright, others dull ; some
of high, others of low intelligence ;
some mathematically gifted, others
very much the reverse ; some kind and
good, others cruel and selfish.
It is usually not so easy to say how
much of this second sort of inequality
is due to heredity and therefore
relevant for our purpose ; how much
only to the effects of physical or social
environment. But in most cases we
now know, and in almost all can be
reasonably sure, that some at least of
the difference is genetic.
This is certain, for instance, of length
of life, physical strength, and, most
important for our purpose, for intellec-
tual gifts-both special ones like math-
ematical aptitude and general ones like
intelligence ; while it is highly probable
for some aspects of moral qualities,
though the situation here is more
complex.
It is therefore of the greatest import-
ance to preserve human variety ; all
attempts at reducing it, whether by
attempting to obtain greater"purity"
and therefore uniformity within a
so-called race or a national group, or
by attempting to exterminate any of
the broad racial groups which give
our species its major variety, are
scientifically incorrect and opposed to
long-run human progress. On the
contrary, Unesco should aim at sec-
uring the fullest contribution to the 
33

 common pool from racial groups which,
owing to their remoteness or their
backwardness, have so far had little
share in it.
To adjust the principle of democratic
equality to the fact of biological in-
equality is a major task for the world,
and one which will grow increasingly
more urgent as we make progress
towards realizing equa ality of oppor-
tunity. To promote this adjustment, a
great deal of education of the general
public will be needed as well as much
new research ; and in both these tasks
Unesco can and should co-operate.
The task before Unesco is necess-
ary, is opportune, and, in spite of all
multiplicity of detail, is single.
That task is to help the emergence
of a single world culture, with its own
philosophy and background of ideas,
and with its own broad purpose. This
is opportune, since this is the first time
in history that the scaffolding and the
mechanisms for world unification have
become available, and also the first
time that man has had the means (in
the shape of scientific discovery and
its applications) of laying a world-wide
foundation for the minimum physical
welfare of the entire human species.
And it is necessary, for at the
moment two opposing philosophies of
life confront each other from the West
and from the East, and not only impede
the achievement of unity but threaten
to become the foci of actual conflict.
You may categorize the two philos-
ophies as two supernationahsms ; or
as individualism versus collectivism ;
or as the American versus the Russian
way of life ; or as capitalism versus
communism ; or as Christianity versus
Marxism ; or in half a dozen other
ways. The fact of their opposition
remains and the further fact that round
each of them are crystallizing the
lives and thoughts and political aspir-
ations of hundreds of millions of
human beings.
Can this conflict be avoided, these
opposites be reconciled, this antithesis
be resolved in a higher synthesis ?
I believe not only that this can happen,

As part of its programme on the study and prevention of natural disasters, Unesco
has organized many emergency scientific missions to disaster-hit areas. Following
the devastating earthquake in Guatemaia in February 1976, Unesco immediately
sent a team of experts in engineering, school building, seismology and monument
restoration to study the earthquake's causes, assess the damage and advise
on earthquake-resistant reconstruction. Photo left shows Unesco seismologists
studying the after-shocks of a major earthquake in Khorassan province, Iran, in 1968.
Promoting international co-operation in oceanographic studies, the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of Unesco co-ordinates major
marine research programmes in a number of ocean regions. Amongst other
projects, the Commission is developing an integrated global ocean station system
for monitoring the world's oceans and a comprehensive plan for global investigation
of pollution in the marine environment. Below, the German (Fed. Rep.) ocean

but that, through the inexorable dia-
lectic of evolution, it must happen-
only I do not know whether it will
happen before or after another war.
Since another war would be so
appalling as to set back the march of
human progress by centuries, I am
convinced that the task of achieving
this synthesis in time to forestall open
conflict must be the overriding aim of
Unesco.
In pursuing this aim we must eschew
dogma-whether it be theological
dogma or Marxist dogma or philo-
sophical or any other form of dogma.
East and West will not agree on a
basis for the future if they merely hurl
at each other the fixed ideas of the
past. For that is what dogmas are-
the crystallizations of some dominant
system of thought of a particular
epoch.
A dogma may, of course, crystallize
tried and valid experience ; but if it be
dogma, it does so in a way which is
rigid, uncompromising and intolerant.
What, for wanting a better term, I have
called doctrine may also embody valid
experience ; but it may be flexible, may
be capable of growth and development
and adjustment.
Some dogmas may represent a more
recent past than others ; but that does
not render them any the less rigid and
accordingly any less dangerously out
of date, any less incapable of reconcili-
ation with opposing systems. If we
are to achieve progress, we must learn
to uncrystallize our dogmas.
The two opposing philosophies of
today differ essentially on one point-
the relation between the individual and
the community. But this one central
difference provides differences in every
field with which Unesco has to deal,
as well as in many others.
It engenders different moralities and
systems of ethics ; different methods
of education ; different conceptions of
the role of art in society ; different
economic systems ; different ways of
integrating science with national life ;
different interpretations of the funda-
mental human freedoms ; different con-

### 49463: A Philosophy for UNESCO: selections from a forgotten historic document
Article 27 of the U. N. Declaration of Human Rights says that"everyone has the right freely to
participate in the cultural life of the community". Unesco has been trying to make this principle
a living reality by encouraging a broad programme of educational and cultural development and an
awareness, particularly amongst the world's newer nations, of cultural identity. In Africa and
elsewhere Unesco is engaged on a long-term programme for the preservation of oral traditions.
The preparation of a General History of Africa, at present under way, is part of this overall
approach. Above, visitors admire works of African art during the 1966 Festival of Negro Art in
Dakar (Senegal) organized with Unesco's heap,
 ceptions of the possibilities and limits
of international co-operation.
I believe that these differences,
though they will undoubtedly become
irreconcilable without armed conflict if
they are permitted to express them-
selves as dogmas, to embody them-
selves in rigid social systems, and to
become translated into terms of politics
and power, can in principle be rec-
onciled. They can be reconciled along
the lines of some such evolutionary
humanism as I have sketched in my
opening sections, in which, though the
full development of the individual is
recognized as the central aim and
criterion of further evolutionary prog-
ress, the proper organization of society
is recognized as the indispensable
mechanism of that progress.
Put in another way, society as such
embodies no values comparable to
36
those embodied in individuals. But
individuals are meaningless except in
relation to the community (though that
community transcends the nation both
in space and in time), and can only
achieve fullest self-development by
self-transcendence, by interpenetration
of the self with other reality, including
other selves.
The problem is thus not one of
metaphysics or dogma, but essentially
practical-how best to adjust or still
better to reconcile the claims of two
concrete sets of realities-individual
human beings, and human social
organizations.
Accordingly, I believe that this
reconciliation can be approached from
two directions. It can be approached
from above and from outside, as an
intellectual problem, a question of
agreement in principle ; and it can also
be approached from below and from
within, as a practical problem, a
question of agreement through action.
The world is potentially one, and
human needs are the same in every
part of it-to understand it, to control
it, and to enjoy it. Anything that
Unesco can do to satisfy these needs
through promoting education, science
and culture, will be a step towards a
unified way of life and of looking at
life, a contribution to a foundation for
the unified philosophy we require.
And finally, I believe that a body
such as Unesco, which is charged with
promoting both the higher activities of
man and their practical application, and
of doing so on an international scale,
is the most likely agency to make this
dual approach and so to speed up this
necessary process of reconciliation.

NO CHILD MARRIAGES
IN SRI LANKA
Sir,
In his article"Machismo-Latin Ame-
rica's Myth Cult of Male Supremacy"
(Unesco Courier, March 1975) Hernan
San Martin has made an extremely mis-
leading comment with regard to the mar-
riage system in Sri Lanka. He refers to
an interpretation of"the'purity'of wo-
men among the castes of Sri Lanka and
the Malabar Coast in India, where girls
are married at an extremely early age,
before puberty, perhaps with the aim
of defending this'purity'through a
commitment to marriage and fidelity"
(page 31).
The institution of marriage and the
pattern of marriage in Sri Lanka taken
horizontally from urban areas to rural
areas and vertically from the earliest
times to the present, does not reveal
any marriage of girls before puberty. To
say otherwise is a complete aberration
of facts as far as Sri Lanka is con-
cerned.
I have no doubt that Hernan San
Martin has referred to Nur Yalman's
article which appeared in the Journal of
the Royal Anthropological Institute (Vol.
93, 1963) under the title"On the Purity
of Women in the Castes of Ceylon and
Malabar". But even this article did not
mention an incidence of pre-puberty
marriages in Sri Lanka. However, in ano-
ther issue of the same journal (Vol. 89,
1959) an article by E. K. Gough reported
pre-puberty marriages among the Nayars
of Malabar, though not in Sri Lanka.

LEARNING FROM BURMA
Sir,
Reading the letter from France in your
January 1976 issue about women's lost
identity [on taking a husband's name]
reminded me of Khin Myo Than's eye-
opening article"From a Young Burmese
Girl's Notebook"in the March 1975
issue on International Women's Year.
No change of name, no ring, equal
rights and responsibilities under marriage
law, personal names for children to last
for life, neither man nor woman subor-
dinate to the other but working in a
complementary way. This has been so
for centuries.
We, in Europe, could learn from
Burma. All countries should be prepared
to learn from each other more.

THE CELTS
Sir,
I congratulate you most warmly on the
December 1975 issue of the"Unesco
Courier"devoted to the Celts. This
really is a splendid piece of work and
I am recommending it to all my pupils
and am getting copies of the issue to
put in various college and department
libraries.
With all good wishes.

WOMEN'S RIGHTS
IN URUGUAY...
Sir,
In your March 1975 International
Women's Year issue, He ! vi L Sipiia
writes in her article"Women's Lib-30
Years of Progress"that in some
countries a woman needs"the autho-
rization of her husband or the court to
exercise her legal capacity to contract,
sue and be sued (e. g. Ecuador, Haiti,
Mexico, the Philippines, Uruguay)."
As far as Uruguay is concerned this
statement is incorrect since there are no
restrictions on women's legal rights in
Uruguay on the grounds of sex. Uru-
gayan women have enjoyed equal civil
rights with men since 1946 and in fact
their rights are in some cases greater
than men's. For instance only women
have the right to seek a divorce simply
because they want the marriage to be
dissolved, without citing any specific
reason. This being so, it is unfortunate
that your list of"Milestones Towards
Emancipation", on page 9 of the same
issue, did not mention this measure
dating from 1946. The list also notes
that women obtained the vote in France
and Italy in 1945 but omits to say that in
Uruguay voting rights were extended to
women in the 1920s.

.. TUSCANY
Sir,
Since the appearance of your chro-
nological list of"Milestones Towards
Emancipation"in your March 1975
International Women's Year issue, you
have published two readers'letters
giving further information on this subject.
One pointed out that women obtained
the vote in the Isle of Man in 1881, the
other that voting rights were extended
to women in South Australia in 1894
and Western Australia in 1899.
I should like to point out that the
Grand Duchy of Tuscany, one of the
States constituting ! taiy before unifi-
cation in 1860, granted voting rights to
women on 20 November 1849. This right
was exercised by means of a male inter-
mediary and only provided a limited
degree of freedom to vote. However,
it was a first step, and when the
first Italian parliament began its work, a
deputy who proposed that voting rights
be granted to women added that if the
Assembly rejected his proposal (which
it did) it would cause serious discontent
in this region where women already had
the vote.

... AND IRAN
Sir,
In your March 1975 issue, Iran is
listed as having banned the veil in 1963.
This information is incorrect.
In Iran, the veil was banned by Reza
Shah Pahlavi in 1934. What is correct
is that political rights for women in
Iran, including the right to vote, were
gained in 1963.
In 1967 and 1975 Iran's laws were
changed to allow women to sue for di-
vorce and be awarded custody of chil-
dren in the event of their husband's
death.

On the occasion of Its 30th
anniversary, Unesco is telling
people about itself and its work
through a card game for
players of all ages, devised and
produced by graphic artists
Freimut Steiger of Austria ant
Markus Osterwalder of Swit-
zerland. The game (see back
cover) is currently available in
a French edition, produced in
co-operation with the French
National Commission for Unes-
co. It is hoped'that other edi-
tions will shortly appear in dif-
ferent languages.
The 50 cards in the set (eight
each coloured blue, green, yel-
low, orange, red or violet, and
UNESCO'S RAfNBOW
CARD GAME
two jokers) are composed of the
letters in the word UNESCO.
Each letter, illustrated with a
drawing, symbolizes one of
Unesco's major activities : its
work for peace and human
rights, international understand-
ing, education, science, cul-
ture and communications.
The game may be played by
2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 players. The
object is to form the word
UNESCO several times, the
first time respecting a specific
order of the colours in the rain-
bow. Six cards are dealt to
each ptayer ; the remaining
cards are placed in front of the
dealer, face down. The first
player must p) ay a U, first letter
of the word Unesco, or a
joker. If he has neither, he
takes a card from the pack. If
he draws a U or a joker, he
plays it. If not he keeps the
cards and the next player tries
to start the game.
Once the word UNESCO has
been completed, players use it
as a base from which to form
the word again vertically or
horizontally. They need not fol-
low the same colour sequence
as the first time but they must
not place two cards of the same
colour in the word UNESCO in
any direction.
Jokers already played may be
replaced by letter-cards. A
player who does this may then
replay the joker or another card
but may not draw from the pack.
A player placing a U must
plays second card (except for
the player who starts the game)
provided that it can be placed
in the me formed from this U.
If not he tares a card from the
pack.
The first player to use up all
his cards wins the round.
The game is currently avail-
able at the Gift Shop in Unes-
cos H. Q., 7 Place de Fon-
tenoy, Paris 75700 (price 16
French francs) and will later be
obtainable at other sales points.

### 49462: Julian Huxley: scientist, humanist, and lover of nature
JULIAN HUXLEY
SCIENTIST, HUMANIST AND LOVER OF NATURE (Continued from page 12)
for most of the scientific work. He
therefore resigned his chair at King's
College, London and devoted himself
full time to preparing and editing the
far-ranging encyclopedia.
The formidable work took three
years to complete ; but it gave Huxley
an opportunity to deepen his know-
ledge of a vast range of subjects-
and also to display his descriptive
powers. From then onwards he was
asked increasingly often to use his
undoubted gift as an interpreter of
scientific subjects, for which many
years later, he was to receive the
Kalinga Prize awarded by Unesco (1).
AFTER such a long period ofconcentrated writi he felt the
need of a break. So he packed his
notebooks and instruments and set off
for Africa. He had been asked to
inquire into the state of nature conser-
vation there and also to report on the
role of biology teaching in African
schools. Africa View, the book he
wrote after this journey, records his
impressions and observations of wild
life and human problems in this vast
region.
Near Nairobi he met the young
paleontologist Louis Leakey, who al-
ready believed that primitive man had
first appeared in Africa, a hypothesis
he was to prove thirty years later when
he found the famous fossil skull of
Zinjanthropus. Huxley went on safari
with his wife Juliette in the Belgian
Congo (today Zaire), and studied there
the great fauna of equatorial Africa
in their natural habitats.
When he returned to the United
Kingdom in January 1930 he presented
a report that included a scheme for
setting up nature reserves for the
wild animals of the entire region, but
it was some years before his propo-
sal was accepted.
After the African trip, Huxley paid
a brief visit to the U. S. S. R. This gave
him material for another travel book,
A Scientist among the Soviets. On his
return to London he resumed work on
a major study dealing with the differ-
rences in growth of different parts of
the body. This was published in 1932
under the title Problems of Relative
Growth.
As soon as he finished it he began
another ambitious project with his
former pupil, Gavin de Beer ; the
preparation of Principles of Experimen-
tal Embryology. This book took two
years to complete. When it appeared
(1) Prize of f1, 000 for the popularization of
science, created by Unesco in 1951 through
the donation of an Indian industrialist, Bijoya-
nandPatnaik. The prize is awarded by an
international jury chosen by Unesco. There
have been 24 Kalinga prize-winners to date.
in 1934 it had an immediate success,
and for many years was widely used
by teachers and researchers.
The 1930s saw a vast wave of pro-
paganda concerning racial myths that
falsely claimed to be scientific. It
provoked a vigorous reaction from
Julian Huxley. He wrote a stinging
counter-attack to the Nazi slogans,
dismantling the theories of racial su-
periority point by point and showing
they had no more weight than a house
of cards. His book, We Europeans,
was published in 1935. It demon-
strated that there was no such thing
as"pure race"anywheçe in the world
and that the qualities and achievements
of each so-called race or ethnic group
were determined mainly by environ-
ment and cultural history.
But these many activities never de-
flected Huxley from his vocation as
a dedicated naturalist. During the
same period he began a new venture,
with film director Alexander Korda. To-
gether they made a marvellous docu-
mentary on seabirds, shot on a small
offshore island, and called it The
Private Life of the Gannet.
When the film was finished Huxley
went off to southwest Ireland, near
Lough Ins. Here he studied a lake-
worm, the Sabella, whose body show-
ed a remarkable and completely un-
expected ability to achieve new growth
after amputation. He discovered that
headless fragments of thorax would
regenerate a complete thorax and
abdomen, though it had previously
been supposed that the brain and its
nerves were necessary for the process.
M N 1935 Julian Huxley agreed tot become Secretary of the London
Zoological Society, a post he was to
hold until 1942. In his autobiography
he writes at some length about this
phase of his long career, a period
marked by the convulsions of Wohd
War II and the bombardment of London.
In the midst of much work and worry
Julian Huxley nevertheless found time
to produce one of his most important
books : Evolution, the Modern Syn-
theses. It appeared during the war,
in 1942, soon after he had resigned
from his post at the London Zoo."It
is perhaps the work I am most proud
to have achieved", he notes in his
autobiography.
Soon after war broke out the British
Broadcasting Corporation invited Ju-
lian Huxley to join the Brains'Trust-
a weekly programme in which a small
group of distinguished figures discuss-
ed various questions submitted by the
public. He also wrote a number of
articles and a booklet, Reconstruction
and Peace, in which he stressed the
need to look ahead to the post-war
world and to prepare fair peace terms
and material aid, not only for the
occupied countries but for Germany
herself, so that she too could rise from
ruin and defeat.
On the suggestion of the Confer-
ence of Allied Ministers of Education,
Britain, France and the United States
invited the countries which had fought
alongside them to meet for discussions
on the setting up of an international
organization concerned with education,
science and vulture. The conference,
held in London in November 1945, set
up a Preparatory Commission and
Julian Huxley agreed to become its
Executive Secretary.
The proposals he made concerning
this ambitious project reveal the bold
and broad sweep of his vision. Re-
reading them thirty years later, as he
presented them at the first General
Conference of the new organization in
a paper entitled Unesco, its Purpose
and its Philosophy, one is struck by
his inspired foresight.
Regrettably, at that time the
delegations did not share his insights
and felt unable to adopt the proposal.
The plan was shelved, but by degrees
a good many of its features have come
to figure in Unesco's programme. The
extracts of this remarkable document
published elsewhere in this issue
(page 14) will enable readers of the
"Unesco Courier"to judge the true
significance of his proposal,
With equal ease Julian Huxley dis-
cussed and analysed questions con-
cerning education or information, the
natural sciences and the human
sciences. The opinions he expressed
at meetings of Unesco's Executive
Board or at its General Conferences
always sparkled with intelligence, and
often with humour. A natural frank-
ness gave his ideas a sincerity that
imposed respect, even from his most
determined opponents.
Placed at the service of Unesco,
his universalist spirit opened unlimited
horizons which reveal Julian Huxley's
tremendous contribution to inter-
national co-operation, to cultural de-
velopment and to the cause of peace.
Unesco is soon to publish a com-
plete bibliography of his writings.
The scientist, philosopher and apostle
will gradually take his rightful place
among the illustrious figures of our
century. Posterity will remember him
as much with admiration as with
gratitude, and will fully endorse his
own judgment of himself."If I am
to be remembered", he wrote,"I hope
it will not be primarily for my special-
ized scientific work, but as a genera-
list ; one to whom, enlarging Terence's
words, nothing human and nothing in
external nature was lien."
