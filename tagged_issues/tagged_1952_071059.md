THE REQUI REMENTS
FOR ETERNAL LIFE
f MMORTAHTY of the spirit has been
the hope or the faith of mankind
since the beginning of time. But
an everlasting life for the physical
body of flesh and blood has always
seemed hopeless. Recent biological
research, however, has advanced
toward that goal. Whole organs of
animals are being kept alive in glass
tubes for long period of time and in
Chicago, U. S. A., Dr. Ralph W. Gerard
has been studying the living spinal
cord of a laboratory rat, kept in a
glass vessel like a goldfish. Gradually
the conditions for the continued
maintenance of life are becoming
known.
To keep an organ alive indefinitely,
long after its removal from the body
of the animal, requires full and
precise knowledge of what that organ
needs for its nutrition. It must be
supplied with energy in the form of
sugars, with oxygen to permit it to
use or"burn"the sugar, and with
a complex mixture of other sub-
stances that are needed for the life
process. The nutrient solution in
which it is immersed must in effect
do all that the blood does in the
animal.
It is just as important also to
remove the products of life, the waste
materials which are formed in the
process of living. If these are stead-
ily removed and uniform correct
nutrition is supplied, the organ can
remain as healthy and active as it
was in the animal. In fact, it can
live longer than the animal could
because in an animal the composition
of the blood changes with age. It
deteriorates and finally fails to
maintain the health of one or more
organs so that death results. But in
the laboratory it is possible to
maintain perfect and changeless con-
ditions and thus to prolong life in-
definitely. This has been done for
individual muscles and organs but it
is still impossible to do it for whole
live animals. True immortality is
still far oft.,
Dr. Gerard's results have not yet
been fully public. shed but his purpose
in studying the Hfeof thespinat
cord are important. He could vary
the amount of oxygen supplied, for
instance, and Ihus have direct
In this tissue we begin a regular column
on Our World of Science by Dr. Gerald
Wendt, formerly professor of chemistry
at the University of Chicago and Dean of
chemistry and physics at the Pennsyl-
vania State College in the United States.
I n recent years he has devoted himself
to public education in science, first as
director of science and education at the
World's Fair in New York in 1939, then
as science editor of Time and Life
and finally as editorial director of
Science Illustrated. His published books
include Science for the World of
Tomorrow, The Atom Age Opens, and
Atomic Energy and the Hydrogen Bomb.
His first article for the COURIER
appeared in the February 1952 issue ; it
was entitled"The Miracle on 57th
Street". Dr. Wendt is the newly
appointed head of the DiYÎsion of
Teaching and Dissemination of Science in
Unesco's Natural Sciences Deportment.
evidence on what happens to the
nervous system if oxygen is insuffi-
cient. Such a direct study of the
role of oxygen in the life of the
nerves and of the brain should be of
enormous value to aviators who fly
high in the sky where the air is thin
and oxygen is deficient. Direct study
of the action of alcohol and of drugs
on the nervous system has also be-
come possible.
The method of keeping organs
alive is now called perfusion and is
being used in many laboratories of
physiology. At the Worcester (USA)
Foundation for Experimental Biology
the adrenal glands of calves have
been kept alive for long periods and
have been \used to manufacture cor-
tisone, the new drug that gives almost
complete relief from the crippling
effect of arthritis. A battery of living
animal glands, under perfusion, would
be a new type of biochemical factory.
In the case of muscle, very long
extension of life is possible.
Dr. Alexis Carrel, the distinguished
French surgeon, who spent all his
active life in researches at the
Roekefeller Institute for Medical
Research in New York and won the
Nobel Prize in Medicine, kept a piece
of heart muscle from a chicken
embryo alive for 23 years. He re-
ported in his famous book Man the
UnknO'wn, that"Colonies" (of muscle
cells), obtained from a heart frag-
ment, removed in January 1912 from
a chick embryo, are growing as
actively today as 23 years ago. In
fact, they are immortal.
It is true that a life of 23 years is
not immortality. But it is a long life
for a piece of chicken. Dr. Carrel
was quite confident that if the condi-
tions under which the muscle re-
mained alive were kept absolutely
changeless, then the muscle would.
remain alive and would continue to
grow for ever.
It was surprising enough when
Alexis Carrel kept a few muscle cells
alive, but these recent researches in-
dicate that much more lies ahead.
The ancient.'secret of life"is not as
mysterious at it was. Life goes on
if its environment is favorable, for
cells, for muscles and for organs. In
the living animal the blood and other
body liquids provide such an environ-
ment until the chemistry of the body
fails with age. But if ageing can be
prevented in the laboratory there is
hope that the process of ageing in
the body can also be explored, under-
stood and prevented. Eventually,
though not in this century, if all the
parts of the body stay young, the
entire body stays young too and
immortality is at least conceivable.
It is a word used by Alexis Carrel
fi fI een years ago.
SWITZERLAND : The Pestalozzi Chil-
dren's Village in Trogen has just inau-
gurated its Community House which
was built with funds raised by the Can-
adian Unesco Council for Reconstruc-
tion, by the canton of Zurich and by a
private firm in the city of Vevey. The
new house will be opened to children of
all nationalities and religions who will
play and work together towards bro-
therly relationship among all nations.
During the coming summer holidays,
educationists and young people from
all countries will be able to visit the
Pestalozzi Community House, where
they will have a chance to exchange
ideas and experience.
UNESCO : Machinery for planning an
international laboratory and for organ-
izing other forms of co-operation in
nuclear research in Europe has been
established as a result of a meeting at
Unesco House. A Council of Represen-
tatives of European States has appoint-
ed a secretary and heads of key study
groups for this purpose. And it agreed
on plans for a conference of nuclear
physicists to meet in Copenhagen this
month. (Members of the Council, which
has its headquarters in Geneva, are :
Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.)
INDIA : An Association of Indian
Science writers has been formed, fol-
lowing the initiative of the Indian
Science News Association and with the
co-operation of Unesco. The purpose
of the Association is to satisfy the
growing interest of the Indian people
in the achievements both of Indian
and other scientists, and to provide
full and accurate information about
international scientific co-operation.
EGYPT : Egyptian and Unesco offi-
cials have signed an agreement for
the establishment this year of a second
fundamental education centre. Site of
this experiment in co-operation to
raise living standards and combat
ignorance will be Sirs EI Layan, some
sixty miles north of Cairo. It will open
in autumn with some fifty students
drawn from Middle Eastern countries.
Enrolment soon will be raised to two
hundred. The first fundamental edu-
cation centre was opened last year in
Mexico and Unesco intends to set up
eventually a world network of these
centres to fight ignorance, poverty and
ill-health through education.
,
FRANCE : An imposing ceremony took
place recently at Grenoble, with the
participation of France's top education-
al authorities and a representative
of Unesco's Director-General, Jaime
Torres Bodet. The occasion was the
solemn endorsement by the city's muni-
cipal council of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights. A commemo-
rating plate was nailed on the gate of
Grenoble's city hall. It was in Greno-
ble that the French Declaration of the
Rights of Man was adopted and pro-
claimed in 1789. It is one of the three
European university centres chosen to
evaluate people's reactions to the Uni-
versal Declaration, the other two being
Cambridge, in Great Britain, and Upp-
sala, in Sweden.
U. S. A. : The Library of Congress is co-
operating whole-heartedly with Unes-
co's Book Coupon Programme. The Li-
brary has paid for more than ten thous-
and dollars worth of books from over-
seas with these Book Coupons, which
are a kind of international currency
primarily designed to aid book buyers
in soft currency countries. By pur-
chasing the Unesco Book Coupons with
dollars, the Library of Congress helps
increase the amount of hard-currency
available for the functioning of the
plan.
INTERNATIONAL : Librarians all the
world over are becoming better neigh-
bours. Most of them have large collec-
tions of extra and unneeded books and
reviews, which may be urgently needed
by readers elsewhere. Until recently,
however, there was no way to know
which books were needed, where they
were needed or how to send them. Now,
a vast network of exchanges has been
developed which knows no frontiers,
customs barriers or currency difficul-
ties. Unesco's Libraries Division, which
plays a central role in the scheme, is
dealing with a larger number of re-
quests and offers than ever before, as
well as encouraging direct contacts and
exchanges. Thus 134 scientific publi-
cations offered by the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute have been distributed
among 46 libraries, from Turkey to Chi-
li, from Poland to Burma, from Sweden
to China. The Austrian National Lib-
rary offered 179 works on history and
literature, and among those who bene-
fitted were the University of Hiroshima,
the Vieux-Conde district in the north
of France, the Olomouc University in
Czechoslovakia, and a number of In-
dian libraries. When the British Book
Centre offered 337 works on education
and social sciences, Unesco enabled 45
libraries to profit from them in Eur-
ope, Asia, Africa and America. Dis-
tribution and exchanges extend to
every country, whether it is a member
of Unesco or not. For hundreds of
'libraries, the ideal of international col-
laboration has become an everyday
reality.
DENMARK : Thirty Danish bus con-
ductors, in Paris to study transport
organization and make the acquain-
tance of their French colleages, were
received recently at Unesco House by
Director-General Torres Bodet. He
stressed the knowledge which 800 Eur-
opean workers who are granted Unesco
fellowships this year, would undoubt-
edly derive from their visits abroad,
and also the value to them of their
meetings with their colleagues of differ-
ent nationalities. The Danish workers
are the first beneficiaries of the group
travelling fellowships which Unesco is
granting workers and civil servants of
thirteen different nationalities, who
desire to establish contact with work-
ers in other countries.
INTERNATIONAL : The opportunities
for international study and cultural
travel during the summer vacation of
1952 will be unusually great and varied.
In order to make them more widely
known, Unesco has just published a
"Vacation Study Silpplement"to Vol-
ume Four of its annual survey"Study
Abroad". This international handbook
of fellowships, scholarships and educa-
tional exchange can be bought through
Unesco distributors around the world.
The supplement lists hundreds of gener-
al and specialized study courses offer-
ed in thirty different countries as well
as seminars, study tours, camps and
youth centres.

### 71060: 2,000 years of Mexican art

: SCO COURIER
. 2, 000 YEARS
OF MEXICAN ART v
by Jean Cassou
Curator, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris
JUNE) 952. Page 3
An exhibition on Mexican art, 01 exceptionally wide scope opened last month at the Paris Museum 01 Modern Art.Its aim is not merely to oller connoisseurs a chance to admire Mexican pointings, statues or rare art objects.
It is lar more than that, lor it reveals a great civilization which is really understood only by a relative minority
01 travellers and specialists. What the exhibition oilers us is an opportunity to comprehend the people of Mexico, not
Irom the outside in the political or ethnological sense but deeply and fNoloundly by tracing their spiritual and aesthetic
development. On this occasion, too, the Mexican Government has placed at the disposal 01 European radio stations
collections 01 recordings 01 its authentic folk music and its modern symphonic music. This great cultural event, then,
goes far beyond the scope 01 the ordinary art exhibition. The COURIER is devoting these page ! to the Mexican
exhibition 01 are not merely because 01 the value al the great works shown, but even more important, because 01 the
unusual opportunity it oilers lor a better and richer understanding between peoples. The article by M. Jean Cassou,
published bellow, is prevented in this same spirit-not as an account 01 she exhibition itself but as an attempt to
explain the fundamental continuity of Mexican culture expressed through the ants.
WHAT an awesome, startling experience
it must be to discover a new world
of undreamed-of expanse and with
an even more undreamed-of past. Can we
who have never had this experience, ever
hope to imagine the profound agitation
and emotion that must have gripped the
Spanish Conquistadores when they beheld for
the first time the vast new continent of
America and became aware of the long, long
ages of its history ? They had the revelation
of a whole universe in time and space ; a uni-
verse hermetically sealed, totally strange and
with an utterly distinct unity of its own
which was to persist down to our own
time. Everv element from the outside was
to be assimilated and absorbed so that this
unity remained unshakeably whole. Today,
there exists a phenomenon we can call Mexi-
can, a world that is purely Mexican. The
exhibition of Mexican art which opened
last month at the Musée National d'Art Mo-
derne in Paris, following an agreement be-
tween the Mexican and French Governments,
bears witness to this enduring phenomenon
which is Mexico and to its fundamental
continuity.
When the Conquistadores, or Teules
(Lords) as they were called, set foot in the
new wor) d, there was revealed to them a huge
Many centuries separate the pre-Columbian terracotta figurine of an old'Hunchback' (upper right) from the'Head of a Woman' (lower left) by the contemporary Mexican artist, Julio Castellanos, who is relatively
little known outside his country. The two works, seen together, convey something of the essential contin-
uity of Mexican art through the ages.
continent stretching out to the other Sea
beyond, and an uninterrupted span of em-
pires and monuments with their epic sequen-
ces of gods, laws and customs. The new-
comers, however, had their epic dreams, too,
and incredible good fortune was to make
these come true. That which they had so
passionately dreamed in their hours of idle-
ness, when the minds of all of them were
filled with the fabulous fancies of their early
childhood, they now were actually living.
They were living a romance of chivalry, each
of them Amadis of Gaul himself, the knight-
errant mounted on his charger, each of them
a Knight of the wheel or a Knight of the
Cross.
For with them, Iwhen they landed, they
brought the material and spiritual things of
the world they knew, their myths and estab-
lished beliefs, their arms, their animals and
their technical skills. They appeared at a
time when their world had reached new
heights of power and entered a new era of
global politics and aspirations. Indeed, a
brilliant panoply of strength and a solidly
organized machine supported the dreams
which dazzled their imagination.
And so, the Conquistadores pitted their
myths and their fantasies against the fables
of the unknown world, and from the vast,
confused battle which ensued, new dreams
were to emerge, new ideas and new forms no
less remarkable than the old.
One thing, however, was always to
remain, potent and indestructible as ever-
the original spark of Indian genius. In fact,
before the coming of Cortes, the native genius
of Mexico had expressed itself with such
powerful intensity and vigour that it is not
surprising that its burning, all-consuming
force has persisted down through the ages.
Scholars who work constantly with the
comparative method, as well as the man-in-
the-street who automatically draws parallels
with the things familiar to him, may find
similarities between certain forms of art of
the pre-Columbian period and those of
ancient Egypt, the old Mediterranean civili-
zations or the Far East.
And yet, when we consider the treasures
unearthed in the temples of Chichen-Itza or
Monte-AIban, we cannot evade the thought
that here is something underived, inalienably
original and whole ; here, indeed, is an art.

and style alike a power that expresses the concentration
or a tight closed core, a power primarily hermetic,
coiled like that of the symbolic serpent whose
expansion can only be slow and terrible.
The Indian genius, with its patient im-
passive features, its opaqueness, its iron,
and its aggressiveness, which might be
ncalled a combination of mineral
matter and wild beast, was to find a
note of harmony in certain rhythms
of the Spanish spirit. Above wall,

the highest genius, both accus-
tomed-and this is truly excep-
tional in the history of human
philosophy-to regarding death
as a sport. This single encounter
was to make possible a new
Mexico, rich in new and amazing
spiritual possibilities.
The humanism of the Iberian
peninsula, which extends over a.
considerable part of the globe, is the
result of such encounters. Varied fac-
tors, each carried to the maximum degree
of intensity, have contributed to its para-
mount originality. The aspects it assumed in
Mexico are no less striking, particularly in the case
of Colonial Baroaue art. This style, already sufficiently
In these mural paintings, the people have found their
own style, true to those they have used fer centuriesand expressing what they want to say with
perfect artistic dignity. They tell of their
past, of all their struggles and adventures
and vicissitudes, of their sufferings, their
work and their wars, of all their hopes
and their passions.
All this is of especial interest to us
today since modern art is in search
of new applications to architecture
and monuments and hence as a
service to the community. During
the past 50 years new ideas have
been developed in the plastic arts
and these, as more and more
persons everywhere are urging
- need to be applied and
adapted to mural painting. The
example set by Mexican fresco
painter, therefore, deserves
our serious consideration. The
success of this medium is
undoubtedlv due to two vital
factors : first, Mexican art for the
E past 2000 years, has been profoundly
and essentially of the people ; second,
Mexico has had a remarkable history
as a nation which has given its art many
inspiring themes. Of course, every people
has its history and expresses itself through
its art. But all art, however evolved and scholarly
it may seem to us, has a basic element which

A SYNTHESIS OF TWO GREAT CIVILIZATIONS
(Continued from previous page.)
be placed alongside the highest art forms of other great civilizations
of the past, it is only because, like them, it is matchless and reaches
the sublime.
If, then, we are truly to understand the phenomenon of Mexico,
it is above all towards its originality and vigour that woe must look.
Mexico and Peru were parts of the continent occupied by the
Indians where the White man found a great civilization. In
Mexico, the Indian civilization had attained a remarkable degree
of advancement ; in fact, it was so advanced that it had reached the
ledge of arrested growth and was beginning to decline and disin-
tegrate. Despite the desperate stand af Cuauhtemoc, the last of the
Aztec emperors, and the heroic battles which for a short time drove
the conquerors out of the city of Mexico, there was a sad fatalism
in the way the Aztec Empire accepted its fall and saw its fate as the
fulfilment of ancient prophecies. This was aided by the rebellion
of the Indian tribes subdued by the Aztecs and the help many of
them gave to the invaders to hasten the collapse.
But perhaps this fatalism and melancholy are parts of the very
genius of Mexico, and a permanent element which humanizes its
frightful-cruelty. The love of flowers and of other short-lived
things which the song-poems of King Netzahualcoyotl evoke so
movingly ; the meditative spirit : a minute and infinite patience-
all of these are traits of the Mexican soul. In their buildings and
sculpture one feels the weight of a massive, melancholy despon-
dency. The implacable geometrical forms, the square-cut jaws,
the uncompromising decorative motifs, the whole Cyclopean weight
of Mexican monuments speaks. of a gravity of mind inclined
towards macabre, unfathomed mysteries. There is in this spirit
intoxicating and intoxicated, was carried by Mexico's tropical pas-
sion to an unparalleled degree of richness and exuberance. For the
miracles introduced by the Whites were permeated by the terrifying
prestige of the old gods which had not been forgotten. This survives
even up to today. In the same way, the keen subtle spirit of the
Indian survives in Mexican speech with its soft sibilant inflexions
and its rhetoric even more ingenious and persuasive than Castilian
Spanish.
just as the Mexican genius surpassed Baroque in the field of art,
so it surpassed Conceptism (1) in poetry. Sor Juana Ines de la
Cruz, author of the First Dream-the admirable lyric description of
an adventure into the mind-was undoubtedly the greatest of
Gongora's successors and his equal as a poet and thinker.
The countries of Spanish America, which were all former pro-
vinces of Spain, have still retained a provincial air that is at once
touching, old-fashioned and quaintly picturesque. Yet beneath
these 18th and 19th century provincial ways the keen observer can
distinguish the differences between Chile and Argentina or Bolivia.
As for Mexico, its mark of individuality is easily recognized. And
perhaps it is not one of the lesser thrills of the Paris exhibition on
Mexican art that visitors will be able to discover for themselves
the charm of some of the religious pictures or portraits of the
Colonial period which reveal certain ingenuous qualities, it is true.
but which nevertheless are so very delicate and elegant and almost
clever. In fact, as far as the people of Mexico are concerned, we
can always believe and appreciate their ingenuousness. For their
native, unadulterated qualities are their guides in art, and popular
inspiration, for them, is always right. Technique and skill are only
derivatives of such native sources and have neither been learned nor
acquired from outside.
If we wish reallv to understand Mexican civilization, be it under
the domination of the Aztec Emperors or that of the Castilian Vice-
roys, or since Mexico became a sovereign state and nation, we must
This basic element i's clearly seen in a painter like Rufino
Tamayo whose name is always linked with those of the three
famous fresco painters of Mexico. Although he has done less mural
work than they, he is nonetheless one of the foremost representa-
tives of contemporary Mexican expression. The is something
poetically savage, mysterious and totally strange in all his works.
One fundamental thing stands out above everything else in
Mexican art. I have said this before and repeat it because one is
constantly brought back to it : the high degree of popular inspiration
which is so particularly rich and dynamic in Mexico's art. Add
to this the passionate temperament of the Mexicans, reflected in the
dramatic history which they have lived and forged by themselves.
As a people, the Mexicans are intensely individual. Their indivi-
duality has persisted through the strangest vicissitudes and even
because of them. We can see it, unchanged, in the civilizations
which preceded the White man and in those where he was present.
We can see it alike in the ancient gods and in the Christian images,
in the frescoes which express the collective spirit and in the easel
paintings that voice a personal sensibility. We can see it in the
masterpieces of art and in the cheap products of traditional crafts.
The singularity does not change. It is not contaminated ; nor is it
weakened or diminished. It persists like an undying flame, a force
of gravity, an everbeating heart.

always turn to the people, that is turn back to the original native
population which must always serve as our background. Wherever
influences have combined and intermingled in Mexican history, we
can always find the spontaneous initiative of the people colouring
and guiding them. That is why the works of modern Mexican art
which are most likely to please us are those we call"primitive"
or"naïve". But all modern Mexican art is naive and primitive.
This is, in fact, the highest compliment we can pay it. It appears
to ups : something like an explosion of the primitive, naive spirit and
of the crude essence of the people. So it expressed itself in the
Revolution of 1910, the second emancipation of the Mexican people
after their first struggle for Independance. From then on, the
Mexican genius in art developed freely and completely on its own.
Once freed of their fetters and complexities, all the elements of
this art, which'had been confirmed in the course of Mexico's long
history, asserted themselves as one single hermetic force of expres-
sion. These elements should be recognized and accepted as they
are, without our expecting them to conform to our own familiar
standards since modern Mexican art can be judged only against
Mexican art as a whole. The one element in it we should look for
is the inherent strength which derives from the Indian civilizations
such as the Zapotec and the Mayan and we should desist from
comparing its innovations and styles with modern European art.
Mexican art is the expression of its people ; it describes, defines
and portrays them in a natural easy manner since it is essentially
popular. The large frescoes of José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera
and Alfaro Siqueiros are not works produced for an aristocratic
court or on official commission even though they were completed
with the help of government funds. They are products of the people
focussed on themselves and fixing their actions in image.

'BONAMPAK'-THE PAINTED WALL
Mural paintings have played an important part in the artistic expression of Mexico since pre-Columbian times.
Only four years ago, new Mayan ruins were discovered in the jungles of the State of Chiapas. The Indians called
these'Bonampak'or the'painted wa) !' because the walls of the temples were covered with frescoes. A
fragment of one of these is shown below. Above, part of huge contemporary mural, telling history of Mexico,

BAROQUE AND
FOLK ART
The Baroque style which reached a peak of
development in the 18th century was carried to
the New World from Spain where its fanciful and
profusely ornamented interpretation by the archi-
tect José de Churriguera had given rise to the
name I Churriguresque"It quickly became an
idiom of wide currency in Mexico and all Spanish
America. In Mexico, a particular richness resulted
(sometimes referred to as'uttra-baroque') from
the fusion of churriguresque with the native
Indian taste for exuberance of heavy detail. This
is seen, for example, in the statues, ornaments
and jewelry of the ancient Mayas and Aztecs.
Today, Colonial Baroque art can be found almost
everywhere in Mexico. One of the masterpieces
of this style is the Sanctuary of Ocotlan in the
State of Tlaxcala (top photo). The church of
Saint Mary Tonantzintla (detail in centre photo)
in the State of Puebla, is another. Even in Mexi-
co's contemporary folk art, which is so rich,
varied and imaginative, the mark of Baroque is
still frequently evident (bottom photo of present
day terracotta folk representation of'Adam and
Eve'shows this influence).

### 71062: The West has much to learn from Asia

Page 10. JUNE 1952 UNESCO
THE WEST HAS MUCH
TO LEARN FROM ASIA
IF there is one notion that a Eu-ropean seeking to understand
the problem of South Asia must
banish from his mind, it is that of
the"exotic". Contrary to what so
many suggestions in literature and
travellers'experiences may imply,
the civilizations of the East are, in
essence, no different from those of
the West.
Let us take a look at the bare
remains that the passage of the
centuries, sand, floods, saltpetre, rot
and the Aryan invasions have left of
the oldest culture of the East-the
sites in the Indus valley, Mohenjo-
daro, Harappa, 4, 000 to 5, 000 years
old. What a disconcerting expe-
rience ! Streets straight as a bow-
string, intersecting each other at
right angles ; workers'quarters with
houses of dreary, unvarying design ;
industrial workshops for the milling
of four, the casting and chasing of
metals, or the"mass-production"of
those cheap goblets whose remains
still litter the ground ; municipal
granaries occupying (to use a modern
term) several"blocks" ; public baths,
drains and sewers ; residential quar-
ters providing comfortable yet
graceless homes designed more for
a whole society that lived in comfort
than for a minority of the well-to-
do and powerful-all this can hardly
fail to suggest to the visitor the
glamour and blemishes of a great
modern city, even in their most
advanced form as Western civiliza-
tion knows it, and as presented to
Europe today, as a model, by the
United States of America.
One would imagine that, over four
or five thousand years of history,
the wheel had come full circle-
that the urban, industrial, lower
middle-class civilization of the towns
of the Indus valley was not so ba-
sically different (except of course as
regards size) from that which was
destined, after its long European in-
cubation, to reach full development
only on the other side of the Atlan-
tic.
Thus, even in their earliest days,
the most ancient civilizations of the
Old World were giving the New
World its lineaments. Admittedly,
this twilight of an ancient history
of uniform design marked the dawn
of other, heterogeneous histories.
But the divergence was never more
than occasional.
From the days of pre-history down
to those of modern times, East and
West have constantly striven to re-
establish that unity which diverging
lines of development have undermi-
ned. But even when they seemed to
diverge, the systematic nature of
their opposition-the placing at
each extreme, geographically and
one might say even morally, of the
most ancient and the most recent
scene, India on the one hand, Amer-
ica on the other-would supply
additional proof, if such proof were
necessary, of the solidarity of the
whole.
Two con f1ieting theories
BETWEEN these two extremes.Europe occupies an inter e-diate position, a modest posi-
tion, no doubt, but one she strives
to make worthy by criticizing
what she regards as excesses in
the two extremes-the para-
mount attachment, in America,
to things material, and the exag-
gerated concentration, in the East,
on things spiritual ; wealth on the
one hand, poverty on the other,
situations with which it is attempted
to deal by two conflicting economic
theories involving, as an article of
faith,"spending"in the one case
and"saving"in the other.
When, having spent long years in
both the Americas, the writer last
year received, from a Keeper of
Bengali manuscripts, his first lesson
in Asiatic philosophy, he might have
been enticed into an over-simplified
thesis. The picture was this :
against the Amazon region of
America, a poor and tropical but
under-populated area (the latter
factor partly compensating for the
by Claude Levt-StrouK
Professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Paris.
former), was set South Asia, again
a poor and tropical, but this time
over-populated area (the second
factor aggravating the nrst), in the
same way that, of the regions with
temperate climates, North America,
with vast resources and a relatively
small population, was a counterpart
of Europe, with comparatively small
resources but a large population.
When, however, the picture was
shifted from the economic to the
moral and psychological plane, these
contrasts became more complex.
For nothing seemed further from
the American pattern than the
style of life of this sage, whose
pride lay in walking barefoot and
having, as his sole earthly posses-
sions, three cotton tunics which he
washed and mended himself, and
who thought he had solved the
social problem by cooking his food
on a fire of dead leaves, collected
and ground up with his own hands.
The'reverse side'
WHEN one flies over vast terri-tories of South Asia, from
Karachi to Saigon, and once
the desert of Thar has been crossed,
this land, divided up into the
smallest plots and cultivated up to
the last acre, at first sight seems
somewhat familiar to the European.
When it is looked at more closely,
however, a difference emerges.
These faded, washed-out shades of
pink and green, this irregular for-
mation of fields and rice-paddies
constantly appearing in different
designs, these boundaries, blurred as
if in patchwork-the whole carpet,
so to speak, is the same ; but, because
form and colour are less clear, less
well-defined than in the landscapes
of Europe, one has the impression
of looking at it"wrong side up".
This is, of course, merely an image.
But it reflects rather well the
different positions of Europe and
Asia in regard to their common
civilization. From the material
point of view, at least, one seems
to be the"reverse side"of the
other ; one has always been the
winner, the other the loser, as if in
a. given enterprise (begun, as we
have said, jointly) one had secured
all the advantages and the other all
the embarrassments.
In one case (though will it always
be so ?) an expansion of population
has paved the way for agricultural
and industrial progress, so that
resources have increased more
quickly than the number of people
consuming them ; in the other, the
same phenomenon has, since the
beginning of the eighteenth century,
assumed the form of a constant
lowering of the amount taken by
each individual from a common pool
that has remained more or less
stationary.
It is to the birth and development
of urban life that Europe has come
to attach its highest material and
spiritual values. But the incredibly
rapid rate of urban development in
the East (e. g. in Calcutta, where the
population has increased from 2 to
5 1 million in the space of a few
years), has merely had the effect of
concentrating, in the poverty-strick-
en areas, such misery and tragedy
as have never made their appearance
in Europe except as a counterpart to
advances in other directions. For
urban life in the East means
nothing but promiscuity, the most
elementary lack of hygiene and
comfort, epidemics, undernourish-
ment, insecurity, and physical and
moral corruption resulting from
over-concentrated, collective exis-
tence. Everything that, in the
West, seems merely to be a patho-
logical accident attending, for the
time being, a normal process of
growth is, one might say, a normal
state of things in the East, which
plays the same game but is con-
demned to hold all the worst cards.
Yet, without going back four or
five thousand years, this striking
misfortune seems to have been
neither inescapable nor of very
ancient standing. As recently as
the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries-thanks no doubt, very
largely, to the Mogul emperors, who
were admirable administrators-
the population of South Asia was
not over-numerous, and there was
an abundance of agricultural and
manufactured products. European
travellers who saw bazaars extending
from 15 to 20 miles into the country
(as, for instance, from Agra to Fati-
pur Sikhri) and selling goods at
what seemed to them ridiculously
cheap prices, were not sure whether
or not they had arrived in the"land
of milk and honey". It can never
be stated often enough that it was
Europe which, by forcibly incor-
porating the still primitive Asia in a
world economic system that was
solely concerned to exploit raw
materials, manpower and the pos-
sibility of new markets, brought
about (involuntarily no doubt, and
no less through the benefits than
through the abuses of the process)
a crisis which, today, it is its duty
to remedy.
Comparing itself with America,
Europe acknowledges its own less
favourable position as regards
natural wealth, population pressure,
individual output and the average
level of consumption ; rightly or
wrongly, on the other hand, it takes
pride in the greater attention it
pays to spiritual values. It must be
admitted, mutatis mutandis, that
Asia could reason-similarly in regard
to Europe, whose modest prosperity
represents, for her, the most un-
warranted luxury. In a sense,
Europe is Asia's"America."And
this Asia, with less riches and more
population, lacking the necessary
capital and technicians for its
industrialization, and seeing its soil
and its livestock deteriorating daily
while its population increases at an
unprecedented rate, is constantly
inclined to remind Europe of the
two continents'common origin and
of their unequal situation in regard
to their exploitation of a common
heritage.
Europe must reconcile herself to
the fact that Asia has the same
material and moral claims upon her
that Europe often asserts she her-
self has upon the United States. If
Europe considers she has rights vis-
d-Ms the New World whose civiliza-
tion comes from hers, she should
never forget that those rights can
only be based on historical and
moral foundations which create for
her, in return, very heavy duties
towards a world from which she
herself was born.
Inseparable worlds
THE West however need not fearthat, in this s ttli g of accounts
with the East, the latter alone
will be the receiver. Preoccupied as
it has been, and for too long, with
the economic aspect of the relations
between the two worlds, the West
has possibly overlooked a number of
lessons it can learn from Asia, and
which it is not too late to ask for
now. Despite the interest evinced
by scholars and the remarkable
work accomplished by Orientalists
in the nineteenth and. twentieth
centuries, the mind of the West has
not, as a whole, been very open to
the messages of Asiatic thought ; it
seemed difficult to comprehend
when attempts were made to in-
troduce it to groups of peoples who
lacked the basic experience under-
lying it.
All Western civilization has tended
to separate corporeal from spiritual
activities as completely as possible,
or rather to treat them as two
uncommunicating worlds. This is
reflected in its philosophical, moral
and religious ideas, and in the forms
taken by its techniques and every-
day life. Only recently, with the
development of psychiatry, psycho-
analysis and psycho-somatic medi-
cine, has the West really begun to
grasp the inseparability of the two
worlds. This key, which is new to
it and which it handles so clumsily,
Asia has long known how to use-
for purposes, it is true, which are
not exactly the same. For the
West, which for three centuries has
concentrated mainly on developing
mechanical processes, has forgotten
(or rather has never tried to
develop) those processes of the body
which can produce in that instru-
ment-the only natural and also
the most universal one at man's
disposal-effects whose diversity
and accuracy are generally un-
known.
This rediscovery of man's body, in
which Asia could be a guide tohumanity, would also be a redis-
covery of his mind, since it would
(as in yoga and other similar
systems) bring to light a network
of actions and symbols, mental
experiments and physical process
which, unless they were known,
would probably prevent the psycho-
logical and philosophical thought of
the East from being, for the West,
anything more than a series of
empty formulae.
Peaceful co-existence
THIS keen feeling, found in Asia,of th  interdepemlence of
aspects of life which elsewhere
one tried to isolate and close off
from each other, of the compa-
tibility of values sometimes consi-
dered to be incompatible, is also
found in the sphere of political
and social thought. The first
illustration of this is in the
field of religion. From Buddhism
to Islam, proceeding by way of the
various forms of Hinduism, the
religions of South Asia have shown
that they were supreme in the art
of living together, comprehend-
ingly, with other very different
forms of belief. In East Bengal,
not far from the frontier of Burma,
we have seen, side by side, mosques
bereft of images, Hindu temples
with families of idols each of which
enshrined a god, and Buddhist
pagodas filled with images (simple
objects for contemplation) of a
single sage, superior to gods and
mem. These irreconcilable yet at the
same time definitely complementary
forms of human faith could co-
exist peaceably, to such an extent
that Moslem authorities supervised
markets where the only meat dis-
played was pork (the staple food of
the Mongol peasants in the hin-
terland of Chittagong), and young.
Buddhists, under the amused eyes
of their bonzes, helped enthusia-
stically to drag the goddess Kali's
chariot to the river, on the occasion
of the annual Hindu festival.
It would be easy to set against
this idyllic picture the burnings and
massacres that marked the separa-
tion of Pakistan from India. But
in the case of these universal after-
effects of nationalist poison, is it
not the West that bears the primary
responsibility ? The only attempts
South Asia made in the way of
political unification-before Europe
compelled it to think in European
terms-developed in quite a dif-
ferent atmosphere. From the time
of Asoka-of whom the Director-
General of Unesco, in his speech to
the Indian National Commission,
said that he"attained to the concept
of a universal comity seeking the
good of all created things"-to
that of Gandhi, the ideal always
sought was that of peaceful brother-
hood. This ideal is particularly
evident in the political and aesthetic
achievements of the Emperor Akbar,
whose ruined palaces-a combina-
tion of the Persian, Hindu and even
European styles side by side-
affirm the will, and the possibility,
that different races, beliefs and
civilizations should live together in
harmony.

### 71063: Buddhist priests and modern science work a 'miracle' in the humming swamp

'JUNE 1952. Pare'I
BUDDHIST PRIESTS'AN MODERN SCIENCE
WORK A'MIRACLE'IN THE HUMMING SWAMP
CHIENGMAI Northern Thailand.
THE malaria team sprayed with DDT the priceless
mosaics on the walls of the temple of Phra Norn
Nong Pung which means-"The Reclining Buddha
of the Humming Swamp."
Priests in their saffron coloured togas, their heads and
eyebrows close-shaven, stood by in silent approval.
Above them glowed the golden smile of the recumbent
Buddha, 65 feet long and sheathed from
head to foot in gold-leaf, an image so big
that they had had to build the temple round
it.
Today the Humming Swamp does not
hum so such..
When'we went out with Dr. Bhatia, the
Indian entomologist from the World Health
Organization and his team of mosquito
hunters we dipped in vain into the water-
grasses of the irrigation streams. In a day's
search it was impossible to find a single
anopheles minimus, the midget mosquito
which has kept Northern Thailand malaria-
ridden for generations. And we could have
searched in vain through the whole of Se-
rapei, the district which, three years ago WHO, in
conjunction with the Thai Government and UNICEF,
chose as a demonstration area for malaria-control.
Notice that it was malaria control, an attempt to reduce
malaria to proportions in which it was no longer a public
health problem and a crippling disease for a whole popu-
lation. The project was not so ambitious as to expect
eradication. But today there are no new cases of mala-
ria and no malaria-bearing mosquitoes in Serapei.
At the temple of the Reclining Buddha we set up a
clinic on the steps of the pagoda. This was nothing
unusual. It had been held regularly there throughout
the whole project. In the verandas, or cloisters of the
temple were the desks and blackboards, the lay-teachers
and the chanting children of the village school-another
feature of Thai Buddhism which gives honseroom to
compulsory civil education.
When Dr. Udom, the Thai doctor, had borrowed an
altar table as his clinic couch, the bell was rung and the
children came tumbling in a hilarious romp up the
temple steps, lined up, put their little straw hats at their
feet and waited their turn.
Dr. Udom pressed their little stomachs to find the tell-
tale swelling of the spleen which, in malaria sufferers,
bulges with the overwork which the disease imposes on
it.
Always it was the same : children who three years ago
would have been pot-bellied with malaria were found
An inspiring saga is unfolding in South-East Asia-the story of man'sstruggle against poverty, disease and ignorance, a hard but slowly
advancing struggle in which the United Nations and its specialized
agencies are joining with governments and the people. Recently a joint
UN and specialized agencies mission led by Ritchie Calder completed
a 25, 000 mile expedition to record in words and pictures something of this
struggle. Last month the COURIER began publication of Ritchie Calder's
report on Sarawak and Indonesia. This month we follow him into Thailand
where the people are improving their health and living standards with the
help and technical advice offered by of the international organizations.
normal and to Dr. Udom's questions they replied : No,
they had no fever. Nor their brothers, nor their sisters,
nor their parents. The shaking disease had left their
homes.
Looking on were the hoy-priests, no higger than the
primary schoolchildren, their shaven eyebrows giving
them a look of continuous surprise.
And surprised they might be, because here was a
modern miracle-a miracle for which the Buddhist
priests can rightly claim a large share of the credit.
The Miracle of the Humming Swamp is a lesson for
the whole world. Modern science has played its indis-
pensible part, but equally indispensible was the co-
operation of the Buddhist priests who, throughout the
whole area, instructed the faithful to work with the WHO
international experts, with the Government authorities
and with the diligent Thai doctors.
So far on this expedition, we have seen how primitive
fears and superstition as in the jungles of Borneo have
to be overcome before modern life-saving practice can
play their part. We have seen too how the tenets of
advanced religions can deny women safe childbirth.
But here in Northern Thailand, Buddhism was the
doctors'closest ally.
I have a great respect for Dr. G. Sambasivan, the
Indian maloriologist who headed the WHO mission, both
as a medical expert and as a diplomat, handling with
real understanding the local susceptibilities. But I also

the North, Chawkun Tepmunee, who receiv-
ed me in the great Temple of the Golden
Buddha.
When I thanked him for the example he
had given by instructing the priesthood to
co-operate with WHO which supplied the
experts and UNICEF which supplied the
DDT and the equipment, he demurred.
Why, he said, should he or the priests be
thanked for obeying the injunctions of
the Lord Buddha and working for the
living wellbeing of the people. Science
and religion were as one when they strove
for the good life.
This was reiterated by the Governor of
Chiengmai who, like his predecessor who launched the
project three years ago, has been the friend and active
helper of the international team. He was proud that in
his province there bad been this project which had
benefitted his people and which in a few years would
mean that all Thailand would be delivered from malaria,
but which had also brought doctors from other countries
for training. These doctors (with WHO fellowships)
would apply in their own countries lessons learned at
Chiengmai.
These lessons are illuminating.
In other parts of the world there have been spectacular
victories over malaria. Even before DDT, malaria could
be checked by laboriously seeking out the breeding places
of the mosquitoes and either draining the swamp areas
or treating them with oil.
Then there was the heart-warming examples of malaria
control in Greece, and of Sardinia and Cyprus where
both islands were enti-
rely freed from malaria (Continued on pane 12.)

### 71064: A Case of cutting the teak tree's 'throat'

Page 12. JUNE 1952 UNESdc
A CASE OFC
While a shaven-headed priest) looks on, a member of a WHO anti-malaria team sprays DDT on pri-
celess mosaics of the temple of Phra Norn Nong Pung-"Reclining Buddha of the Humming Swamp."
! N THRE E YEARS THE'SHAKING DISEASE'
HAS VANISHED
(Continued from poge II.) by the destruction of
the mosquitoes through
spraying their breeding places with DDT.
But land-locked countries have not the advantages of
islands and require a different strategy. In Sardinia and
Cyprus it meant a frontal attack and mopping-up opera-
tions. In Thailand, it meant a pincer movement, cutting
off the mosquitoes when they were on the offensive.
When Dr. Sambasivan arrived in the spring of 1949,
he had to ! plan a campaign which would be economical
in DDT and in manpower, because it had to be scaled to
the resources which Thailand could afford in extending
the lessons of the project to the whole country-nnan-
cial, but also medical resources. Thailand is short of
doctors.
First it was necessary to choose a workable area. He
selected Chiengmai in Northern Thailand, in the hills
behind which lies Burma. This was an endemic malaria
area. That is, malaria was constantly present in 60 to 70
per cent of the population, not flaring up into sudden
and deadly epidemics, but robbing the people of health
and fitness and liable, like a sleeping volcano of disease,
to erupt.
Second, they had to find the mosquito responsible for
malaria in this part of the world. There were 30 types
of mosquito in the area, any one of which might be the
villain.
They were lucky. The very first day, Dr. M. D. Bhatia,
who had joined the mission from the Malarial Institute
of India, and his assistants, found the spores of human
malaria in the salivary gland of the 13th mosquito they
examined-the anophiles minimus.
Third, they had to study its habits. They found that,
unlike certain other mosquitoes which favour stagnant
water, it bred only in running, fresh water. This was
lucky because the experts could define its area of opera-
tions. It belonged chiefly to irrigation channels fast fed
from the hills and could not survive in the sluggish
canals of the lowlands.
Fourth, they had to find its bases for attack on humans.
They systematically examined the peasant huts-built on
stilts, with plaited mat walls and thatched with attap, a
broad, brown leaf, tobacco like. After studying the
habits of 15, 000 specimens, they satisfied themselves that
it rarely rested higher than 8 feet from the floor-an
economy when it came to spraying-that it lurked in
the walls and in hanging clothes, and that it was mainly
active between 9 in the evening and 4 in the morning.
They decided to attack its.'airstrips"-the walls and
hangings of the houses. The homes of 40, 000 people
were involved but, with the help of the priests and the
village headmen they set about it systematically. All
over the area one sees huts with letters and numbers and
dates painted on them'''A/16 DDT 21/4/50,"meaning
the village, the number of the house and the date of the
first spraying. So thoroughly was this done that the
DDT sign is now the postal address of the householders.
At the end of the first year, the Thai members of the
team led by Dr. Udom and Dr. Vimol were entirely
capable of handling the scheme and the international
members retreated to the role of advisers. This tactful
move strengthened rather than lessened their authority.
All this time UNICEF had been providing the DDT
sprayers and vehicles for the pilot project, matched in
cost by the Government's provision of staff.
They extended the Serapei project to five times as
many people, 200, 000, and at the same time trained and
advised the personnel which the Thai Government instal-
led and financed in the adjoining area of Hangdong.
This scheme was also so successful that it was extended
five times.
Yet another scheme was started in Central Thailand,
covering a population of 50, 000. In this case half the
cost of the, materials was born by WHO directly.
The pilot projects also provided training facilities for
the American and Thai staffs who were to work the ECA
schemes in conjunction with the Thai Government. This
provision of direct American aid has taken the place of
the WHO/UNICEF contributions and, following through
the plans prepared by the WHO experts, aims to clear
Thailand of malaria within 3 years. Thus the protection
already given to 600, 000 people will be extended to
another 4 million.
By killing the mosquito with the lingering poison of
DDT, the Chiengmai methods broke the cycle of malaria.
And they killed off the species. In a search of 5, 000
man-hours not an"a-minimus"has been found. The
disease faded out. And for a cost of 14 cents a head,
compared with 6 dollars a head in Sardinia.
This parable of health began with The Kathin and it
ended with The Kathin.
The Kathin is the festival which goes on for weeks in
celebration of the end of the Buddhist Lent and the
beginning of the Buddhist Spring. With the last of the
monsoon, the thousands of young Thais who have entered
the monasteries for a term of spiritual service-and
practically every Thai does-emerge and exchange their
humble yellow robes for civilian garb. The permanent
priests receive from the faithful their new robes. And
everyone makes merry.
It was at the Kathin that the Chief Abbot had first
enjoined the people to co-operate with WHO and when
we reminded the Governor of Chiengmai, Udom Bunya-
prasop, of this he immediately said we must join in the
Kathin. He ordered a procession complete with the
Corps of Court Dancers and the Busabok, the triumphal
car which the people drag with ropes through the streets.
The beautiful dancers of the Court, with their vivid
robes and flowered head-dresses and their goldern finger-
nails, six inches long, danced barefoot in the streets.
Every turn of the foot, every gyration of the body,
every movement of the hand is the exquisite dumb-
alphabet of age-old legend.
And the procession moved through Chiengmai to Wat
Suan Dawk the principle temple.
Only once a year does the Golden Buddha, the most
precious image in all North Thailand, emerge from the
dim recesses of his temple. For this occasion, the Chief
Abbot gave a special dispensation with priestly rites, the
golden image was carried down the temple steps and
enthroned on the lawn before the pagoda. People
prostrated themselves before it. The Dancers danced
before it.
Tradition and modern science met in common
thanksgiving.
Lampang, Thailand.
DIGNITY made way for Impudence. Boon
Tam, the giant tusker, stood aside and let
Too Too, the tawny terrier take the lead.
And for the very good reason that the
elephant feared the King Cobra, and TooToo, our
snake-dog, did not. He went jauntily into the
bamboo undergrowth. Chan, the forester,
released the safety-catch of his colt revolver.
Boon Tam, forced by the goad of his mahout,
warily pushed his, and our way through the
jungle.
One would have thought that TooToo took a
delight in teasing his mountainous friend. He
would scurry on ahead and stop dead. So would
Boon Tam. He would sniff at a dangling vine.
The elephant would give it a wide berth. The
terrier would get excited over the spoor of a wild
pig and go haring off leaving the elephant
"unprotected".
Once he himself was taken aback. Across our
path wriggled something black and apparently
furry. TooToo sniffed and sprang back
dismayed. The reptile was a giant earthworm
about ten inches long, very much alive but being
carried shoulder high by a swarm of ants, like
the Lilliputians manhandling Gulliver. The
captive would wriggle desperately and the
swarm of ants would sway but hang on.
Meanwhile, I had troubles of my own. I don't
ask anyone to believe it-but I had absentmind-
edly trekked into the jungle in my house-
slippers and in the squelch I could feel things
real and imaginary slithering in and out. I was
more worried about hookworm and leeches than
about King Cobras. So we went deeper and
deeper into the jungle of the teak forest-
TooToo, Boon Tam, Chan, the officer of the Royal
Thai Forests, the teak-fellers with their saws
and axes, and the jungle farmers and their
women folk with their curved, razor-edged kris.
And Nai Khan Chaiyen-"Little Mister Pitcher-
Who-Never-Gets-Excited"an appropriate name
for a jungle twelve-year-old, who fetches and
carries water. Jungle clearing is thirsty work,
and running errands to a jungle waterhole needs
a bit of nerve.
The jungle excursion may seem remote from
our mission, but, believe me, Chan Watanasuva-
kul, Bachelor of Science (Forestry) and his
fellow-conservators are as much"Men Against
Disease"as Dr. X and Professor Y.
The reason why the UN Food and Agricul-
tural Organization raJ1lIæ forestry and forest
management high in its technical aid programme
in South East Asia, is not just the commercial
value of timber or indeed, helping to house the
world's people, but because the food of Thailand
may depend on what happens to the forests.
"Some undeveloped countries are actually poor
but potentially rich while Thailand is actually
rich but potentially poor", said an FAO nutrition
expert."It has a rich and fertile soil. It has,
second only to rice, the wealthy export of teak.
But its population is beginning to rise steeply.
In another generation it may be short of'food
instead of exporting it."
They will have to increase, not lose, productive
acres. Crops depend on the control of the foods,
Here as elsewhere in South East Asia most of
the population is to be found on the banks of the
rivers and the alluvial plains. But the rivers
which supply the irrigation for the rice fields
also drown crops, the stocks and the people,
leading to hunger and to disease.
And soil conservationists look at Thailand's
rivers after a tropical downpour with the
concern of doctors confronted by a haemorrhage.
The rivers rise several feet an hour and swirl
past, the colour of liquid teak, heavy with eroded
soil scoured off hills where forests once checked
the run-on'.
The get-rich-quick teak cutting of the past has
already diminished the average size of teak trees
to about half. Peasant methods of cultivating
the jungle by clearing the trees and setting fire
to what remains so as to get the ash, and than
moving on somewhere else, have exposed soil to
the sun and to the hose-pipe violence of tropical
storms.
Now most of the forests are Royal preserves.
Concessions are lapsing and leases reverting to
the Crown and cutting is under supervision.
Not that cutting is a bad thing. Indeed selective
cutting can improve the forest. Nor is jungle
farming a bad thing-provided that it is done
the right way.
Thailand is fully alive to this and has called
in intennational forestry experts through FAO to
add experience elsewhere in the world to the

local experience of their own trained foresters.
These foresters also can have the opportunity
through FAO fellowships to go and study prac-
tices elsewhere.
FAO has brought in four experts, to advise
on Forest Management, Reafforestation, Mecha-
nisation and Sawmilling. And we went into the
jungle to find out what is meant by"Forest
Management".
Deep in the forest where the sunshine filtered
green through a screen of foliage, Chan chose
his tree.
The lumbermen with slashing axes, cut a
"girdle"-a deep gash round the trt1nk about
2 feet from the ground. He cut through the
combium through which passes the food vessels
from the roots and the leaves. In fact, it was a
case of cutting the teak-tree's"Throat". But it
will take two years to die-off and dry-off so that
when it is felled the log will be light enough to
float for anything from two to six years down-
river to Bangkok.
Beyond this he sanctioned a clearing with no
teak or other valuable wood, but other timber for
the peasants to fell and the Government to sell,
and with a bamboo undergrowth to fire to provide
the ash.
The men got to work with their axes and in a
matter of minutes trees were crashing. The
women with their knives cleared the wndergrowth
and lopped branches. With all their energy and
speed it would take them weeiks to clear the two
acres.
Then with long spiked sticks they would make
holes for the rice-seed and would plant their
cotton, their water-melons, their peppers and
their vegetables. And o. n the same ground they
would plant teak trees under the supervision of
the foresters.
This is the hard way to win rice, because the
ground they clear is theirs only for a year. By
then the teak would have asserted itself and
become a plantation and they would have to
repeat the process.
But"shifting cultivation"of this kind has beg. n
their traditional way. The difference now is
that it is a healthy instead of a destructive
process, supplying them with their vital rice,
cotton which they make into their clothes and
with a varied vegetable diet. But instead of the
scorched earth policy of abandoning the land
when its rice-fertility is exhausted and leaving
it to the off-scourings of the rains, they leave a
plantation of 800 teak saplings an acre, which
will be thinned to 80.
Ln ten years time, these trees will be useable
as timber and in a hundred and seventy nine years
it will be as valuable as the one we saw felled in
a nearby logging operation.
This veteran had been girdled and forest-
seasoned for two years when Chan ordered it to
come down. With axes and saws, (with"Little
Mister Pitcher-Who-Never-Gets-Excited"pulling
like a grown-up) they brought down the giant in
half a. n hour. They then sawed off the upper
reaches leaving a log three cubic metres in
size.
Its value on the jungle site is about 2400 ticals,
or 120 dollars, or 1 : 45. When it floats into
Bangkok, in three years'time, it will be worth
twice as much and when it reaches the cabinet-
makers in Europe or America it will be worth
at least four times as much.
That is why it pays teak-robbers to steal the
logs out of the river on their long journey, take
it to saw-pits in the juggle and slice it, by hand,
into planks for smuggling to markets.
With a deft axe, the huge log was shaped, given
a sharp nose like the bow of a ship and notched
for the fixing of chains. Boon Tam then rolled
it into position with his tusks and prepared for
the long haul.
When he strained on the chain it would not
budge. He bellowed with fury as TooToo barked
and the lumberman shouted and the mahout
goaded him. Then with his hind foot, he pushed
it clear of the root obstruction and went crashing
through the jungle-a living bulldozer.
At one point he struck a rock. He cried with
exasperation and tears ran down his cheeks.
Then, his brain-which is an intelligent (mite-
came to the rescue of his muscles. He turned
and tusked it past the obstacle. Then, he had to
drag it through a mat-hut jungle village. It
looked as though at any moment he would sweep
away the frail huts but always he edged and
twisted it past, like a boatman steering between. n
rocks.
As Chan said, you can mechanize the sawmills,
install stacking machines and road-haulage
trucks, but in the jungle itself, the elephant is
the only practical machine.
With foresight and fair-warning, with their
own able foresters and the added experience
which FAO can bring from other parts of the
world, the Thais can repair past havoc and avoid
the disasters which ruthless forest destruction
has caused to agriculture elsewhere in the world.
And so, strange as it may seem, the teak
forests of Thailand can help to feed the future
millions and preserve the health of the people.
Boum Tam, the giant tusker, is still the only pra'ctica) machine for these teak foresters in the jungles of Thailand. After the tree has been brought
crashing down and the upper branches sawn off, an elephant rolls the log into position and then hauls it away through the jungle undergrowth

### 71065: Hopes and bitterness of the Arab refugees

Page 14. JUNE t952
HOPES AND BITTERNESS
OF THE ARAB REFUGEES
IT is three years since I first saw Mr. Fattah
Nounih in an Arab refugee camp not far
from Jericho. lie is still at his refugee
school in El Karameh but in these three
years great changes have taken place there.
When I saw Mr. Nounih for the first time in
his black coat and striped trousers he looked
as impressive as any schoolmaster could hope
to be. But somehow his rather solemn beha-
viour and appearence did not fit in with his
surroundings, and least of all with what he
proudly called"my school."
His school was the burning sand of the
Jordan valley on which hundreds of Arab
refugee children were sitting in groups of
between 4U and 30, some chanting verses from
the Koran, some counting, others listening,
and a few even tracing English irregular verbs
in the sand. There were no books and not
even a blackboard ; there was just sand and
the deafening noise of children reciting in
chorus at the tops of their voices.
Despite the noise, the heat and the absence
of even the most elementary items of school
equipment, Mr. Fattah Nounih escorted me as
proudly as any headmaster might have done,
from class to class, and finally to his office-
Hn old army tent-where I explained that I
had been sent by Unesco to find out what it
could do to help him and other refugee teachers.
We made lists : so many blackboards, so
many pencils, notebooks, textbooks, maps, and
then, after reflecting a moment, this desert
schoolmaster suddenly added :"And I should
like a schoolbell, please."I thought at first
he was joking-a schoolbell in the wilderness.
Today, three years later, he receives visitors
in a neat little office in which chairs have
replaced the boxes on which we once sat. His
600 students still recite from the Koran, but the
older ones learn history, geography and En-
by Willem V AN VUT
glish. Each of the 20 groups has its own class-
room built of white-washed mud bricks, com-
plete with blackboards, chalk, pencils and
plenty of other equipment. And the head-
master now has his bell to summon the chil-
dren to classes.
But all these changes have not been brought
about simply by financial help from Unesco.
The school walls were built by the headmaster,
his pupils and some of their elder brothers.
The chairs and benches were made in an
apprentice workshop attached to the school, as
also were 81 pairs of shoes which Mr. Nounih
keeps in reserve.
The schoolbell was a gift from the Unesco
Youth Club in Amsterdam, Holland. A ship-
ment of notebooks came from Norway, black-
boards arrived from South Africa. The Calder
High School for Girls in Liverpool, Engtand,
made a collection and sent a cheque for
t 12. 0. 10. From Antwerp, Belgium, three
16 m. m. film projectors were shipped to the
Middle East.
With such gifts, an endless list of indiv-
iduals, clubs, schools and organizations in all
parts of the world have taken voluntary
action to help Mr. Fattah Nounih and his
800 colleagues to keep open the schools for
Arab refugee children in the Middle East.
The combined efforts of the U. N. Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) and some of the
Specialized Agencies (Unicef, WHO, Unesco)
have served a great humanitarian purpose.
Nearly 1, 000, 000 refugees who possess no
means of existence whatever, were kept from
starvation, protected against diseases and
provided with the equipment to continue the
education of their children. The Palestinian
refugees are grateful for these efforts. But
what is their actual position ? Mr. John B.
Blandford, Dil'eetOl of UNRWA, described it
earlier this year to the United Nations Assem-
bly in Paris :
"Today, almost a million refugees look back
upon more than three years of homelessness.
Approximately one-half of them are children
of 15 years and less ; there are more than
thirty thousand births a year. One-third of
the refugees live in organized camps or tents,
mud huts and barracks. The remainder are
scattered through villages and towns in temp-
orary rooms, old public buildings and caves.
Eight hundred and seventy-five thousand live
on rations which provide a daily average of
1600 calories per person. For clothing they are
principally dependent on the generosity of
private agencies. A small number of the
wage learners find employment, but in so doing
are often competitive with natives of the
country in which they work. Declining per-
sonal resources of the refugees has caused a
steady drift from private rooms to public tents
and huts. The problem daily grows in size
and intensity.
There can be no stability or security in this
mass dislocation and temporary way of life. A
recent storm of nine days duration destroyed
six thousand tents, ravaged 3, 000 mud huts and
momentarily unsheltered almost one hundred
thousand refugees. More tragic is the steady
weakening of the defences of family and reli-
gious life-the steady deterioration of morale."
To provide a solution for this great humani-
larian problem and enable the refugees"to
move out of a valley of despair and up a road
of hope", as Dr. Blandford put it, the Director-
General of UNRWA proposed, and the UN
General Assembly approved a $ 250, 000, 000
programme to help refugees obtain adequate
housing and employment ; permit them to move
from camps to suburban housing projects and
rural villagps ; and help them to become not
Through the combined efforts of the U. N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and some of the U. N. Speciaiized Agencies, nearly 1, 000, 000 homeless
refugees, with no means of existence whatever, have been kept from starvation, protected against disease and helped to continue the education of their children.

only self-supporting but ultimately economic
assets of the Near East countries.Meanwhile, the refugees'general attitude is
one of both bitterness and gratitude. Bitterness,
because of the continued existence of drab
camp life and the desire of many to return
to their former homes. Gratitude, because they
are aware of the goodwill of people from all
over the world.
Unesco was among the first to invite the
whole world to help to keep the Arab refugee
schools in action. Declaring that.'these chil-
dren cannot be brought up on bread alone",
Unesco appealed for money to buy books,
classroom supplies and teaching materials. As
fast as grants and gifts allowed, Unesco opened
more schools in the Middle East Camps. When,
in 1950, the United Nations decided to convert
its emergency aid unit into the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency the entire basis
of the education provided for the children
changed from a primarily social measure to
prevent the delinquency which follows idle-
ness, poverty and cramped living conditions.
It became an education aimed at preparing the
children for the task of earning a living and
contributing to the material and spiritual well-
being of the country in which they were to live.
The number of schools has steadily grown.
Today, Unesco and UNRWA are operating
119 schools such as the one at El Karameh, for
nearly 51, 000 boys and girls, scattered all over
the Middle East, in the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
and the Gaza area as compared with the
64 schools which provided elementary education
for about 33, 000 children in 1949.
Last year, a new vista opened up for a few
thousand of the young refugees. In some of
the schools vocational training classes were
opened up on a small scale, to supplement
ordinary classroom education with basic
training for a livelihood.
In these makeshift shops, girls learn dress-
making, knitting, embroidery, and home eco-
nomics. Education for girls is in itself a new
development, for before they became refugees, a
good many Arab girls never went to school. In
their home villages mothers would teach their
daughters everything that was thought proper
for a girl to know : housekeeping, needlework,
the care of babies. In the refugee camps,
however, home life lost much of its traditional
form. More and more girls are now being
allowed to attend school along with their bro-
thers. Although boys outnumber girls three
to one in the schools, still, for the first time,
thousands of young Arab women are growing
up with a knowledge of reading, writing,
arithmetic, geography, history and other school
subjects.
Vocational training for boys includes tin-
smithing, carpentry, shoe-making, black-
smithing and book-binding-all specialized
skills calling for special implements. The
things they make are immediately useful. At
the school of EI Karameh, run by Mr. Fattah
Nounih, for example, fifty boys are learning
how to make shoes. They are not elegant by
Western standards, the soles being made from
old tyres, and the uppers from disused canvas,
but the product is serviceable and saleable to
low income groups in Jordan.
Close to the EI Karameh refugee camp some
250 boys of the school are learning how to till
the land, how to plant and tend crops and
vegetables. Their production is used for the
supplementary feeding programme which
gives the schoolchildren part of their daily hot
meal. A less immediate but important result
is that these boys are getting agricultural
training through the United Nations which they
would formerly have obtained on the land
owned by their fathers or their father's em-
ployers. They are now being taught about soil
erosion, tree planting and irrigation in prepar-
ation for the time when they will be earning
a living as farmers, fruit growers and market-
gardeners.
These are some of the positive results that
have been achieved. But there are many pro-
blems to be solved, many needs to be satisfied.
More teachers are required, but teachers must
be paid. School equipment is lacking, but this
must come from abroad. Shortage of tools is
preventing the opening of more vocational
training centres.
Individual needs are modest, but multiplied
by the total number of refugee children, the
overall demands are tremendous. As a result,
the educational efforts of the United Nations
to tackle the problem of re-integrating youth
have so far been restricted by lack of funds
to a comparatively small number of benefi-diaries.
Even the maintenance of existing facilities,
difficult enough in itself, is not going to meet
the problem. There are still some 130, 000 refu-
gee children in the 6 to 14 age group eager
to go to school. Thousands of teen-agers are
still getting no training. Forty thousand adults
have learned to read-but now find themselves
in the ronic circumstances of having nothing
to read. Babies are still being born in their
hundreds to swell the refugee problem.
The progressive social planning that has
been initiated in the schools for Middle East
refugee children must be continued and
developed. The children must be taught and
trained to become productive citizens and not
left, illiterate and ignorant, to add to the
troubles of the Middle East.
: COURIER
Some facets of Arab refugee life are expressed in these few photos. For the aged who have exchanged a settled
family existence for a temporary way of living in tents, mud houses or huts, life has indeed become bitter. For the
young, sports and studies... and youth itself... help keep alive the spirit of hope. For the few wage earners who,
like this former forester now working in a re-afforestation nursery, have found employment, life has begun again.

SCHOOLS FOR ARAB
REFUGEE CHILDREN
Three years ago emergency schools for Arab refugee children were set up with
tents as schoolrooms, rocks as benches and the desert sands as'blackboards'.
Since then refugee teachers and children, using mud bricks, built class rooms
which have been equipped thanks to funds sent from many countries. Today
Unesco-United Nations joint schools are educating 50, 000 boys and girls, but another
130, 000 children out of a total of nearly 1, 000, 000 refugees are still without schools.
The problem of educating all Arab refugee children is still unsolved. (See page 14.)
