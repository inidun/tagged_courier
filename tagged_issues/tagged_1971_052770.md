The collections of the Pre-Columbian Museum in Montevideo, Uruguay, boast innume¬
rable artefacts of major artistic and historical importance. Originating from every part of
South America, these objects reveal the rich diversity of Indian civilizations that flourished
on the continent before the Spanish conquest. Some, like this little terracotta figure
(10 cm.; 4 in.), are very ancient. Discovered in north-east Argentina, it probably served as
a votive offering to a fertility goddess worshipped by one of the Stone Age farming commu¬
nities which had learned the art of fashioning pottery. These peoples may have been
the ancestors of the present-day Guarani Indians of Paraguay and north-east Argentina.

PROBLEMS OF CULTURAL POLICY (Continued)
From the right to culture
to the duties of governments A great work of art in every age stands as a
chronicle and summary of human experience.
The huge Nahua (Aztec) calendar, (below), being
examined by teenagers in the National Museum
of Mexico City, is a synthesis of art and
science, a record in delicately carved stone of
the chronology and astronomy of an ancient
American people. In striking contrast, but equally
expressive of its time, is the painting "Broadway
Boogie Woogie" by the Dutch artist, Piet Mondrian
(1872-1944), a pioneer of modern painting,
particularly in the abstract geometrical style.

confessed philistine and the "culture
vulture" alike.
Delegates from almost ninety coun¬
tries, including 39 Ministers, perhaps
inspired by the magnificent backdrop
that Venice provided for their delib¬
erations, publicly and unreservedly re¬
affirmed that "Everyone has the right
freely to participate in the cultural life
of the community, to enjoy the arts and
to share in scientific advancement and
its benefits". But more than this, they
showed, once and for all, their resolve
to make this extract from the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights a reality
of modern life.
Differences as to the means to
achieve this became evident as the
conference progressed, but never once
did these differences blunt the edge of
determination and faith or deteriorate
into a destructive negativism Instead
they offered a foundation on which to
go on building.
There was, for example, general
agreement with the basic proposition
that every country should in fact have
a cultural policy. As Unesco's Direc¬
tor-General, René Maheu, pointed out
with unassailable logic, "If everyone, as
an essential part of his dignity as a
man, has a right to share in the cultural
heritage and cultural activities of the
community, ... it follows that the autho¬
rities responsible for these communi¬
ties have a duty, so far as their
resources permit, to provide him with
the means for such participation."
Many countries already have clearly
defined cultural policies and machinery
for carrying them out. Some have
appointed Ministers of Culture or
allotted responsibility for cultural policy
to government departments with
complementary duties.
In certain countries, the danger
of stifling artistic creativity under a
bureaucratic blanket was felt to out¬
weigh the advantages of direct govern¬
ment intervention. This is not to say
that such countries reject the idea of a
cultural policy. On the contrary, it is
often a deliberate policy to encourage
non-governmental bodies and indivi¬
duals to provide the motivating force.

### 188335: Cultural policy, a modern dilemma

> -
The crux of the argument then was
about the degree of government inter¬
vention that was desirable.
The Moroccan Minister of Culture,
Mr. M. El Fasi, explained how govern¬
mental intervention was viewed in his
country by quoting from a speech
made by King Hassan II in 1969:
"We wish to bring together activities
which were formerly dispersed and
co-ordinate them. We have accordingly
set up a Ministry to deal especially
with them, to get our people to realize
how valuable this knowledge is, how
its originality is constantly renewed,
and how valuable a national heritage it
represents."
The Soviet Minister of Culture,
Madame Ekaterina Furtseva, explained
that culture was inextricably bound up
with all the other activities of a nation.
"The' cultural development of a nation,"
said Madame Furtseva, "depends upon
the socio-economic basis of society, on
people's material welfare; at the same
time, the cultural development of the
masses is an essential condition of
social and spiritual progress."
This is the principle upon which
Soviet cultural policy has been based
since the Revolution in 1917, when
three-quarters of the population was
illiterate and over forty nationalities
inhabiting outlying areas did not even
have a written language. From the
outset, the State assumed responsi¬
bility for all organizational, material and
financial aspects of the development of
culture and art.
Long-term planning was essential.
"To realize the importance of long-term
planning," said Madame Furtseva, "one
has only to think how life is likely to
have changed, not only in 15 to
20 years, but even in 10."
The dangers of concentrating patro¬
nage "in the hands of a limited circle
of politicians, bureaucrats and artists'
union bosses" were pointed out by
the Norwegian delegate, Minister of
Education Mr. Kjell Bondevik, who
recalled the old adage that "he who
pays the piper calls the tune."
Clearly this was an aspect of the
problem that worried a number of dele¬
gates. A cultural policy requires a
fine balance, but must enhance rather
than encroach upon the artist's crea¬
tive freedom.
As the Yugoslav Minister of Culture,
Mr. V. Micunovic, pointed out, "The
freedom to create cannot be granted or
withheld by decree, but a State can
provide the social and legal conditions
which allow an artist to express himself
fully and to express the whole com¬
plexity of his personality."
In a frank statement Mr. Micunovic
declared that "State interference in
aesthetic matters, characteristic of the
first post-war years, impoverished cult¬
ure and weakened creative criticism."
Cultural policy should be concerned
with the social and legal security of the
artist, with providing the material condi¬
tions which allow cultural and artistic
institutions to operate, with satisfying
the needs of art and the need for art.
The Yugoslav constitution safeguards

WHIRLWINDS OF FANTASY
Visitors to Japan's Expo' 70 last year had an opportunity to witness an extraordinary
array of original designs, works of art and cultural exhibits assembled In the 90 pavilions
at Osaka under the central theme "Progress and Harmony for Mankind". Many of the
illustration in this issue have been specially selected from Expo' 70, showing the cultural
contribution of different nations. Above, "The Cloud", a monument of blown glass
fantasy in the Czechoslovak pavilion. The work of a Czech artist, René Roubicek, it was
one of the main attractions of the pavilion. The artist who produced the explosion of
metal rods, bells, feathers and other paraphernalia in the awe-inspiring photo, opposite, is
unknown. The costume was worn during a carnival procession in Port-of-Spain,
capital of Trinidad and Tobago.

the independence and autonomy of
artists and scientists, limits the say of
public authorities in deciding what shall
be accepted as culture and eliminates
the State's right of arbitrary judgment
on the artistic value or otherwise of
what artists produce.
"Contrary to what Is happening in
other countries," said Mr. Micunovic,
"the role of the State and of govern¬
mental bodies In the direction of cultur¬
al affairs ¡n Yugoslavia Is likely to
decrease; to an increasing extent, It
will become merely supervisory. The
decisions will be taken where decision¬
making properly belongs, if democracy
is to be taken in its literal sense, by the
people actually doing the work or those
they choose to represent them; by
those who create forms of culture and
by those for whom it is intended."
Recent moves by governments to
recognize on a national, public basis
the importance of the arts and huma¬
nities to the future of their societies
were recalled by Miss Nancy Hanks,
Chairman of the U.S. National Council
for the Arts. In the United States
cultural matters have traditionally been
considered to be of solely private
concern. "Public money spent on
cultural matters other than education,"
said Miss Hanks, "will perhaps always
be relatively small as compared in
absolute terms with funds for health,
welfare, economic development or the
sciences; but now we have a commit¬
ment to an idea."
Mr. Edmond Michelet, the French
Minister of Culture (who died shortly
after the conference), pointed out that
it has taken a long time for the idea to
grow that culture, regardless of how it
may be defined, is the private property
of no one; and once it was recognized
as essential to man's dignity, all the
barriers had to come down. "But,"
said Mr. Michelet, "it is beyond the
power of individuals or groups, how¬
ever generous, to handle problems that
involve millions of people."
The conference, therefore, whilst
admitting the importance of govern¬
mental cultural policies, was less
united on the question of the extent of
State action required and the Institu¬
tions and machinery needed. "The
degree of direct governmental involve¬
ment," states its final report, "depends
upon the socio-economic system, the
ideological character and the degree of
economic and technological develop¬
ment of the country concerned. It is,
therefore, not possible to recommend
any standard structure applicable in
all countries."

THE EGGCENTRICITIES OF PROGRESS
Enclosed in soundproofed, egg-shaped cabins of transparent plastic,
visitors to Expo' 70 call their friends on radio-telephones equipped with

materials lead to new forms and designs that are gradually becoming
integrated into the cultural background of the modern world.

2.
PROBLEMS OF CULTURAL POLICY (Continued)
Changing ways of life
and the struggle
for cultural identity
L
,KE alchemists seeking the
philosopher's stone, a number of
delegates at Unesco's Venice confer¬
ence made brave and elegant attempts
to define culture. Others obliquely
skirted the issue, and Lord Eccles, the
United Kingdom Minister responsible
for the Arts, admitted unashamedly,
"In my country we have no clear
idea what culture means. Indeed, the
English I dare not speak for the Scots
or the Welsh are reluctant to admit
that they have any such thing as a
national culture."
The conference refrained from the
time-consuming effort of finding a defi¬
nition that would satisfy all viewpoints.
It kept resolutely to Its task of dis¬
cussing the problems involved in
creating cultural policies, yet from the
fire of debate a surprisingly clear pic¬
ture emerged of what culture meant to
the delegates, even if this defied formal
expression.
This was particularly noticeable in
the statements of delegates from the
developing countries. Again and again
culture was referred to as a unifying
force, a democratizing Influence and
the expression of personal and national
identity.
The Zambian delegate, Mr. J.L.M.
Mulenga, summed up the feeling about
the search for a national identity when
he quoted a message from President
Kaunda addressed to the 1969 National
Arts Festival: "We can never hope to
build a nation if we are not united by a
common culture. Citizens of any
country cannot all think alike, even
members of the same family can have
violently diversive views, but there Is
always something that unites them,
and that is, that they share a common
culture."
Mr. Mehrdad Pahlbod, Minister of
Culture and the Arts of Iran, declared
culture to be "the only element cap¬
able of imparting to men the sense of
personal identity without which all
communities are laid open to alienation
and disintegration. Long considered a
luxury, culture Is generally understood
today as being essential for social and
economic development."
Although emphasis in the States
emerging from long periods of colonial
rule has been primarily on grappling
with the basic material needs of the
people, hunger of another kind has
also been demanding attention. As
Mr. C. Cherif of Guinea put it, there
is "nothing retrograde about reviving
a national culture. It gives a country
back its soul and Its moral equilibrium
and prepares It to absorb what pro¬
gress can contribute without being
absorbed by it."
The dilemma facing many newly inde¬
pendent States was neatly explained
by Minister of State, Mr. Hector Wyn-
ter of Jamaica. As a result of the colo¬
nial educational structure, "it Is natural
to find that, to the bétter-off and better
educated, culture means only European
culture with its treasures of music,
painting and the arts. Increasing
acceös will therefore dare I say it
amount to cultural colonization.
"We have had to engage In an
aggressive policy of discovery and
identification of our cultural heritage
and an equally aggressive policy of
conservation, creation and dissemin¬
ation to avoid having to seek an
identity elsewhere. It Is right to pro¬
vide access to the admittedly great
European culture which is part of our
heritage, but it is equally necessary to
seek out the great culture patterns of
the African and Asian heritage which
are a part of our patrimony."
The problem does not present Itself
in the same way In all the developing
countries. Too rich an inheritance
from the past can be a crushing burden
on limited resources and be stultifying
for new cultural development.
Mr. Habib Boulares, Tunisian Min-

ister for Culture and Information, drew
a vivid picture of his country faced
with the dilemma of preserving and
restoring an embarrassingly rich legacy
from the past whilst striving to catch
up with and enter the mainstream of
modern life. This indeed is a delicate
task for the government which must
make choices, provide finance, en¬
courage and promote.
""But," continued Mr. Boulares, "the
public authorities must know what they
are trying to do. In a country like
Tunisia it is difficult even to say what
the expression "national culture"
means, since it includes Berber, Punic,
Roman, Oriental, Arab, Berber-Arab,
Ottoman-Turk, Moslem.
"In a country which has successively
seen seven languages and seven
different cultures, and in which a score
of political regimes have done their
utmost to reduce the indigenous
population to the rank of second-class
inhabitants and destroy even the
memory of their predecessors, "natio¬
nal culture" is scarcely an adequate
term to use.
"Assuming that it were possible at
all, what an effort it would take to
bring all the elements of this heritage
to light and introduce them into
curricula and other cultural activities
so as to make them available to all."
Mr. Boulares pointed to the Tunis-
Carthage project, being undertaken in
collaboration with Unesco, with its
twin cultural and economic aims as
being a prototype which might well
provide a new approach during the
next Development Decade. (See the
December 1970 Issue of the "Unesco
Courier" which was entirely devoted
to the Tunis-Carthage Project.)
Speaking to the press after the
conference, the Secretary-General of
the meeting and Director of Unesco's
Department of Culture, Mr. Amadou
Seydou of the Niger, showed how
closely his finger had been on the
pulse of the discussion in an admirably
concise analysis of the many state¬
ments given from the viewpoint of the
developing nations.
The biggest and most immediate
problem for the developing countries,
Mr. Seydou pointed out, was that
many of them, particularly in Africa,
had almost entirely oral cultures and
traditions.
Preserving and developing their
cultures was a matter of urgent action
today. In Niger, for example, a centre
had been set up, with Unesco's help,
with the task of making tape-recordings
of traditional songs, myths and fables,
religious rites, and so on, before the
older human repositories of the
ancient traditions died out. Material
assistance in the form of tape-
recorders and film-making equipment
and human assistance in the form of
technicians to operate this equipment
was wanted desperately and was
wanted now. "The crisis in the
advanced countries," said Mr. Seydou,
"is to decide what is the meaning and
purpose of culture. Their problem is
how to make proper use of the mass
media; for the developing countries
the problem is to get hold of them."
It was natural that the developing
countries should wish to protect their
national cultures from being swamped
by Western ideas and traditions.
"Cultures are ethnocentric," said
Mr. Seydou, but they must not become
totally isolated. The developing
countries had to avoid the error of
allowing cultural protection to develop
into cultural protectionism.
tFor the developing nations then,
cultural policy must provide the thread
by means of which their peoples can
find their way through the labyrinth of
history towards national consciousness
and identity. To quote Mr. Boulares
of Tunisia once more, "To live only on
borrowed culture is like living some¬
one else's lifel To live on a culture
borrowed from the past is like cutting
oneself off from life. A synthesis is
necessary. It must be made in an
atmosphere of freedom and, in the last
analysis, it is a matter for each
individual."
In the words of the English writer
Thomas Carlyle: "The great law of
culture is: Let each become all that
he was created capable of becoming."
This is clearly what the delegates hope
to see made possible for their peoples
both as nations and as individuals.

3. Mass media
and mass culture
T
HE Venice Conference,
while unanimous in accepting the
principle of each man's right to culture
and on the need for at least some
government action to ensure this right,
was far from reaching agreement on
how to deal with the powerful new
force that mass culture represents.
A new urgency, tinged with a certain
acrimony, marked this stage of the
discussions.
What was this danger that seemed
to be threatening not only the confer¬
ence but also a culture-hungry world?
The delegates were certainly not
afraid of the effects of mass culture
itself. They would have shouted down
Epicurus who, many centuries ago in
a letter to Pythocles, wrote: "Hoist
all sail, my dear boy, and steer clear
of culture."
Some delegates saw the principal
SPIRAL CITYAN
ANTI-MEGALOPOLIS
The present conurbation a
nightmare of overcrowding and
pollution problems was visualized
very differently a half century ago.
At that time, architects, artists
and designers at the famous
Bauhaus arts academy-crafts school
in Weimar, Germany (founded
by the German architect Walter
Gropius) depicted the tentacular
cities of the future in lyric terms.
Photo-montage, left, made in 1923,
shows how Paul Citroen, of the
Netherlands, and an associate
of Gropius, saw such a metropolis.
Today, as the metropolis tends
more and more to become
a megalopolis, architects and city
planners give top priority in their
designs to light, space and a
diversity of forms. Right, an airy
spiral-shaped city designed by Alexis
Gotnof a model shown at Expo' 70
in Osaka, in which futuristic
homes, cities, tools and machines
offered a preview of life tomorrow.
danger in excessive government inter¬
ference, whilst for others the mass
media were cast as the villain of the
piece. In other words the risks lay
with the means and methods used to
make the world's inheritance of culture
available to its three and a half
thousand million heirs. The problem
was to steer a safe course between
the Scylla of propaganda and the
Charybdis of triviality.
For the Soviet Minister of Culture,
Madame Ekaterina Furtseva, the battle
had already been brought to a largely
successful conclusion in the U.S.S.R.
For her, governmental Intervention was
no threat but a sine qua non of an
effective cultural policy.
Madame Furtseva pointed an accus¬
ing finger at commercialism and its
distorting effect on art for the masses.
"I think the time has come," said
Madame Furtseva, "to make use of
the social rights and duties of Unesco
and its Executive Board, and to ban
the dissemination by the modern mass
media of so-called commercial art,
which runs counter to the principles
of humanism and helps foster a cult
of war, violence and racialism, crime,
pornography and brutality. We must
not let the pseudo-heroes of this
ersatz culture replace for our young
contemporaries the eternal beauty of
art dignified by such glorious names
as Raphael, Shakespeare, Beethoven
and Tolstoy."
Some echoes of this fear of com¬
mercialism were evident in the speech
of the chief delegate from Sudan,
Mr. H.A. Yousif, although the problems
for his country are vastly different
from those of the Soviet Union:
"In a society which is more and

BLIND MAN'S BLUFF
This photograph, suggesting a bizarre game of blind-man's-buff, illustrates the
moral of an Indian fable, well-known throughout Asia, that a part should not
be mistaken for the whole. The photograph was taken in Sweden to illustrate
a Swedish textbook on philosophy, using five men wearing blindfolds.
The story goes that a traveller one day brought to an Indian village an elephant
which he placed for the night in a barn which had no windows nor any other
source of light. The curious villagers entered the bam and, since they could
not see, began to feel the strange beast to find out what it was like. As they
came out of the barn they each described the animal.
"It is a large pipe," said the man who had felt the trunk.
"Nonsense," said the one who had felt a leg, "it's a tree."
"It's a giant leaf," said another who had touched an ear.
"It's a massive wall," said the villager who had passed his hands over
the animal's flanks.
"No, it's a hard rope," said the man who had gripped the tail.
Each man thought he was right, but Just a little light would have changed
the picture and revealed the true figure of the elephant
more divorced from rural life, increas¬
ingly oriented towards urban life, mov¬
ing from a purely ascetic towards a
more secular life, from an agricultural
economy towards an industrial one,
many cultural problems arise; and
family disintegration, social and moral
irresponsibility, crude tastes In hu¬
mour, a more liberal view of sex, and
an acquaintance with the superficial
aspects of Western civilization, all tend
to create a cultural vacuum. There is
a danger of rejecting old roads without
discovering new ones."
S
UCH a notion of a "cultu¬
ral vacuum" and the danger that it
would be filled by an inferior, pseudo
culture born of a marriage of conve¬
nience between technology and com¬
mercialism seemed to be a nagging
anxiety that lay at the back of many
delegates' minds.
The chief Mexican delegate, Dr. J.L.
Martinez, summed up this feeling.
"Culture," he said, "has recently
acquired a completely new role; that
of providing a shock-absorber in a
technological world, and particularly in
cities. . . Industry and technology are
already producing a lethal smog in
cities. A complete lack of balance ¡n
education is producing students, study¬
ing for technical careers, who do not
even know the rudiments of their own
language and have no interest In or
knowledge of anything outside their
subjects. From that point of view,
technology is responsible for a mental
smog that could be similarly lethal to
any kind of worthwhile civilization."
Dr. Martinez was well aware, how¬
ever, that technology, or the ill-use that
men made of this potent weapon, was
not the only menace. In Interventions
in cultural affairs governments had to
walk a tightrope.
"It Is sometimes difficult," said
Dr. Martinez, "for the State to maintain
the freedom to think and create and
at the same time ensure the partici¬
pation of writers and artists in eco¬
nomic and social life. Nevertheless,
criticism and contestation are a necess¬
ary ferment for the health of peoples
and indispensable to social change
and even to progress. It should never
be forgotten that many of our patriots
and great cultural figures were dissi¬
dents or revolutionaries in their day."
The impact of the scientific revolu¬
tion of the post-war years and its
effect on cultural development was
never far from the delegates' thoughts.
How great an effect for good the
advances in telecommunications can
have becomes clear when we realize
that a single televised broadcast of
say Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute"

### 188335: Cultural policy, a modern dilemma

Freedom of the artist a ferment of progress
probably reaches a greater audience
than the sum of all previous per¬
formances in opera houses throughout
the world since the work was written.
The counterbalancing evil effect is
that, with a transistor or a television
set in almost every home, the demand
for programmes of quality has become
enormous and the gaps are too often
filled with endless outpourings of a
kind of "musical chewing-gum" liable
to turn us all into undiscerning
ruminants.
As Lord Eccles pointed out we are
now all exposed to a much more
powerful distribution of art than any
preceding generation. "No small body
of professionals and experts," he said,
"now has the privilege of making the
occasional effort to bring art to the
deprived masses. They have art
brought to them in their homes, they
listen to the radio in their automobiles,
and while they are at work soporific
music is relayed to them by loud¬
speakers.
"This is an entirely new world of
communications In which the urgent
task is to raise the quality of the art
which is being provided, day in and
day out, for everybody. We have
little time to lose because, before long,
the mass media may have blanketed
whole populations either with the
trivialities of the consumer society or
with political propaganda, and I do not
know which is worse for the character
of the individuals who make up these
vast audiences." If Lord Eccles was
aware of the dangers that lined the
way towards the establishment of
effective cultural policies, he was far
from pessimistic about the future and
had the air of a man convinced that if
the dangers were squarely faced they
could be overcome.
He recommended that national
cultures should be made available in
such a way as to add to the enjoyment
and instruction of populations as a
whole; that governments should be
asked to give artists the greatest
possible help, both by direct govern¬
ment subsidies and by the encourage¬
ment of private patronage; that an
intensive study should be made of the
relations between the live arts and
the mass media and that co-operation
between them should be increased,
remembering that "the mass media
are now the most powerful instruments
for raising or debasing the cultures
of tomorrow."
Throughout the conference there
was an evident desire to avoid useless
ideological confrontations and at the
same time a desire to hear and
interpret constructively the other
man's point of view. Debate left the
conference united on a wide range of
things to be done rather than
fragmented into angry factions that
expostulated but did nothing.
Dare we hope that this is a sign that
the cultured man is the constructive
man, that this conference marks
the beginning of a new age of
reasonableness and constructive co¬
operation? Clearly the delegates felt
that it did and even the most cynical
of observers could not help but catch
a little of their infectious optimism.
T
HE closing stages of the
Conference found the delegates "full
of great aims and bent on bold em¬
prise." A flood of draft resolutions,
80 in all, bore witness to the urgent
wish for words to be translated into
actions.
Some measure of the agreement
reached during debate became evident
when these 80 draft resolutions were
whittled down to 24 recommendations.
A striking feature of these recom¬
mendations was that fully half of them
were addressed to the Member
States of Unesco themselves. The
conference was clearly anxious to
underline the fact that culture Is not
a "spectator sport" to be left to
professionals and international orga¬
nizations while the world as a whole
looks on ready to cheer or boo, but a
"do It yourself" activity in which
everyone should take part.
This does not mean that the confer¬
ence underestimated the role that
the Secretariat of Unesco might play.
Indeed it placed heavy emphasis on
the need for international co-operation,
co-ordinated by Unesco.
Without attempting to give a com¬
plete list, some of the conference's
major recommendations on which
action can be expected within the next
few years must be mentioned.
The delegates called for: the
creation of a centre for the exchange
of information on cultural policies
which would work, not only in collabo¬
ration with governments, but also with
foundations interested in the arts;
the preparation of cultural statistics
models; research on the cultural con¬
tent of formal and lifelong education;
research into the cultural effects of
the new audio-visual methods; co¬
operation with other United Nations
organizations in drawing up inter
national agreements to ensure that, In
the use of telecommunications satell¬
ites and other new media, the equality
of cultures and non-interference in the
internal affairs of States will be
respected.
The delegates were aware that
cultural activities require advisers,
"animateurs" and other organizers and
administrators, and called on Unesco
to make provision for their training.
Recognizing that cultural develop¬
ment is part and parcel of develop¬
ment generally, the conference re¬
commended that Unesco make a study
of the relationship between cultural
and general development and the
possibility of creating an international
fund for cultural development.
Finally, encouraged perhaps by the
success of their own deliberations, the
delegates called for a further succes¬
sion of intergovernmental conferences
and meetings in Europe, in 1972, Asia,
in 1973, and Africa, In 1975, and an
international symposium of creative
artists and men of culture on the
contribution of culture to humanism
and peace.
Underlying all these recommenda¬
tions was the firm, unquestioned
assumption that culture will be a major
issue of the 1970s and that, in one way
or another, government involvement is
an established fact.
I
N presenting his report on
the Venice Conference to the General
Conference of Unesco, the Director-
General stressed the importance of
the delegates' findings. He proposed
certain possible re-arrangements in
the draft budget for 1971/72 to permit
immediate action on at least some of
the recommendations from Venice.
The Venice Conference has attempt¬
ed to remind the world of the basic
needs of human existence. Man has
been trying for years to live by bread
alone and has found it an exceedingly
indigestible diet.
If it is a little unfair to cast Science
and Education as the Ugly Sisters,
Culture has certainly been for too long
the Cinderella of development. Like
so many fairy-godmothers, the dele¬
gates at the Venice Conference tried
to work their magic. Will the rags-to-
riches story have a happy ending? . _
We shall have to wait to see whether 1 f
that fickle Prince Charming, world
opinion, has the courage to claim the
prize.

THE MIRACLE OF CREATION
"Artistic creation with time becomes reality for the crowd," wrote a 19th century
French historian, J.J. Ampère. In this drawing from a cartoon film, the Belgian artist,
J.F. Folon, in the "naive" style, depicts roses blooming out of a man's brain.

THE THOUSAND
AND ONE FACETS
OF CULTURE
On the following pages we present a selection of brief
quotations of different views expressed by participants at
the conference on cultural policy organized by Unesco last
year, in Venice.
Morocco
When the first man used a gourd, or something like it,
to take up water for a drink, that was utilitarian. It was
still utilitarian when he tried to fashion a bowl out of clay,
in imitation of the gourd. But his purpose in attempting
to decorate this bowl was no longer utilitarian; it was the
response to a deep aspiration for beauty which is the
specific attribute of culture.
Mohammed El Fasi
Minister of Culture
Hungary
A good cultural policy should give culture to a wider
public and give the artist freedom to create that was
what the Hungarian poet Sandor Petofi had in mind a
century and a half ago in writing of the ray of sunshine of
the spirit shining on the windows of all the houses.
Pal llku
Minister of Culture
France
It must be admitted that It is difficult not to believe that
one's own culture is the best that exists, or understand
that a wholly different way of thinking may be exactly what
someone else needs. But we should encourage everything
that is authentically human In every civilization. France is
prepared to help any country which asks, in making an
inventory of Its riches and in making its culture better
known inside and outside its own frontiers.
Edmond Michelet
Minister of Culture
Somalia
Culture is a way of life chosen or adopted by a society
or group of societies. It amounts to the sum of traditional
values and way of thinking of the society.
Mohamed Seek Hassan
Director-General, Ministry of Education
Australia
Culture must not be too narrowly conceived. Indeed,
properly, it comprehends much that lends quality to life and,
in one sense, it can be seen as a desirable component to
all aspects of living. Thus in Australia the natural environ¬
ment of an ancient continent, a wild-life rich and strange,
and a certainty of sunshine have traditionally established
open-air activities and the artistry of sports as integral
parts of our way of life and of our national culture. There
is, of course, classical justification for this view In the
example of ancient Greece.
We must be careful too not to impose narrow ethnic
limits on the content of culture. In our own case migrants
to our shores have brought us a better appreciation of the
complexity of European culture, and increasing contact is
bringing the influence of the richness and vitality of the
manifold cultures of Asia to bear upon the minds and
imagination of our artists. Perhaps, most importantly, we
have come better to understand and to value the unique
art and culture of the aboriginal Australians.
Nigel Bowen
Minister for Education and Science
Iraq
Culture is the collective intellectual achievement of a
people and the embodiment of their values, their aspirations
and their way of life.
Saad Abdulbaki
Minister of Education
World Federation of Trade Unions
To working men, culture is not only art and letters,
although they appreciate the full intrinsic value of these
without always having access to them; and culture would
amount to little if it were merely decorative and escapist.
Culture must be comprehensive, including all the sciences
and technologies, the arts, sport, and the indispensable
social culture economic, trade union, political forming an
indissoluble whole, each influencing all the others.

What we want is that, once freed from immediate
necessity, protected and free, educated and healthy, man
should be fully human i.e., be able to use his judgement, to
imagine, to meditate, and to dream.
José Luis Martinez
Director-General of the National Institute of Fine Arts
The Holy See
The State is "paid" less tangibly for the cultural facilities
it provides than for others which are more material, and
is sometimes paid with ingratitude. And still, this wider,
more flexible, more disinterested part of what it does should
not discourage it from working for cultural development as
an integral part of development as a whole.
Mgr. André-Jacques Fougerat
Adviser to the State Secretariat
Guyana
In the smaller and weaker States, one purpose of cultural
policy must be to achieve a greater resistance to the
onslaught of the twentieth century without at the same time
encouraging the growth of inhibiting parochial timidity.
M.W. Carter
Minister of Information and Culture
Iran
Culture is a way of interpreting the world. Science is a
way of transforming it. That is not sufficient reason for
keeping them separate. In so far as science is a culture,
it should be integrated, and one of the primordial tasks of
cultural policy Is to ensure that integration. And, as
cultural policy is a matter for individual governments,
Unesco must endeavour to provide the world co-operation
which offers the only way of bridging the ever-growing
scientific gap between the advanced and the developing
countries.
Mehrdad Pahlbod
Minister of Culture and the Arts
Guinea
Mass culture is essentially different from élite culture
but in no wise inferior to it. It is a potentially explosive
creative force which could be compared to its advantage
with the individualist subjectivity carried to its extreme by
certain intellectuals and artists who, seeking a new lan¬
guage, had reached total incommunicability or, at best, a
code language that strangely recalls that of the most occult
sects. Culture and witchcraft are surely different things...
Cheick Cherif
Consul-General for Guinea in Berlin
Denmark
There is probably no society on the face of the earth that
does not have to neglect vitally humanitarian and cultural
problems because of what it spends on armaments. At the
same time as technological progress follows a vertically
ascending curve, we are all thinking on horizontal levels;
the technological revolution has not been accompanied by
a revolution in our ways of thinking.
C Helveg Petersen
Minister for Cultural Affairs
Togo
A number of paradoxes merit reflection. Culture has
never been as rich and yet, never so much called in
question. Culture has never been as universal and yet
never so torn apart internally. Culture has never spread
so widely and yet never been so much in danger of losing
its central purpose: man. Culture has never had so many
material and technical aids available to it for its conser¬
vation, and yet has never been so totally menaced with
extermination. For, looking at the apocalyptic pictures in
the museum at Hiroshima, I could not help thinking to
myself: the whole world could be like this tomorrow, and
not only that, but there would not be even one spectator
left to come and remember our destruction.
N'Sougan Ferdinand Agblemagnon
Permanent Delegate to Unesco
Sweden
To the younger generations, cultural Isolation, like other
forms of national isolation, seems not merely unrealistic,
it seems absurd. The fact of artists being forced or induced
to create an underground civilization can only be taken as
a symptom of serious sickness in the political structure.
Art is not merely a social product; it is also an instrument
for changing society. Artists must be free to use their own
means of expression. History has left us many examples
of how reality sooner or later often in the most drastic
way takes its revenge on those who deny the artist the
freedom to follow his own calling.
Sven Moberg
Minister of Education
Federal Republic of Germany
In a deliberate move away from the appalling experience
with absolute State power, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many limits itself to aiding and promoting, without pre¬
conditions or compulsion. The task falling to the State, and
indeed the community, is to protect human values and
human dignity. Art, in the words of Camus, can only live
under its own laws; it dies when exposed to external
demands. Administration and culture can go together only
on the understanding that intellectual creative activity
shall be free. And a culture which takes shelter behind its
national boundaries must necessarily decay.
Bernhard Vogel
President of the Permanent Conference
of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder
Spain
Planning means establishing an order of priorities i.e. a
scale of values. But even assuming that there are
unchanging models and an artistic golden rule (which seems
to be more and more unlikely), there remains the major
problem of the renewal of patterns, types, styles, ways of
life; and the risk of fossilization which the administrators
run immediately becomes apparent. There are questions
of taste and fashion which cultural policy has only to touch
incidentally upon to provoke, on both sides, misunder¬
standings, interference, refusals, reticence. This becomes
all the more serious because the modern State, if it is
unable to indoctrinate artists, can perfectly well even
without wishing to do so orientate, influence, condition
public taste; and private and commercial interests do so
deliberately and without scruple.
This does seem to be inherent in culture: to be
condemned to devour or to be devoured and, in this sense,
all countries without exception are invaders or invaded.
But things are even more complicated. To a certain extent
every culture devours itself: in a kind of cultural canniba¬
lism, innovations In style, type or taste, to feel sure of
themselves, have to destroy their predecessors.

We hope, in the present and future history of mankind,
never again to have to regret the humiliations and absences

Vittorino Veronese
Former Director-General of Unesco
Cameroon
Can anyone Imagine the African peoples flourishing
without music, without dancing, without masks and statues,
without the immense verbal wisdom bequeathed by gen¬
erations of thought, and without the legendary joy of our
tribes? But how can this art be preserved against the
assault of the modern world unless artists are given the
means and techniques to express themselves in the style
of their times, confidently and with dignity, and still be
perfectly authentic? Excepting with the help of the public
authorities, how else can this be done?
Too many bilateral and even multilateral agreements
exclude cultural matters or regard them as superfluous
luxury.
Zaché Mongo Soo
Minister of Education, Youth and Culture
Belgium
The year 2000 is only thirty years away. It will probably
contain 140 working days. Education should not forget the
remaining 225.
Universal education is becoming a reality but will take
its full effect only In future generations. For the moment,
probably not more than a tenth of all adults lead a
conscious and active cultural life. This is partly because
their education has been based too exclusively on a mere
transfer of knowledge and on having to learn a bit about
everything. At the age of 19, a boy or girl ought to know
about theatres, concerts, libraries, museums. The sad fact
is that they often do not Some people are satisfied
with their days off, their paid holidays, their sports matches
and their television. Even those who do not want to work
are supported by the State, and some students, drop-outs,
hippies and beatniks see no reason for continuing the
material struggle for existence.
The other extreme is represented by people who work
themselves to death in order to gain more and more of the
products of a consumer society.
How is this challenge of the welfare society to be met?
Some surveys have revealed that 70 per cent of those
who started work between the ages of 14 and 18 never
followed another course of any kind. They obviously need
properly thought-out facilities for education, in and out of
school. Otherwise, it is difficult to see how there can be
any democratization of culture.
Frans Van Mechelen
Minister of Dutch Culture
Colombia
The Bank of the Republic of Columbia has been called
"the bank with a soul." To it is due the Museo del Oro,
in Bogota, which has an impressive collection of pre-
Columbian gold objects, a regular El Dorado of the
archaeologists; the numismatic museum; the "Cathedral of
Salt" at the Zipaguira mines; and a centre for youth and
artists...
José Manuel Rivas-Sacconi
Director of the 'Caro y Cuervo" Institute, Bogota
Japan
I should like to refer to what might be called
the intermediate arts that are widespread among the
Japanese people and vary between highly sophisticated
art and popular amusements: the tea ceremony; flower
arrangements, and the writing of the short poem
known as "Tanka" and "Haiku". Over twenty million
people are learning how to sip a cup of tea with formal
and refined manners, how to enjoy the making of formal
flower arrangements in their homes, how to write verse.
Two kinds of art and culture of different origin, European
and Japanese, can now be regarded In Japan as like the
two wheels of a cart, and have brought incomparable
variety to our lives.

India
Culture will have to have a vast base for survival In the
modern world. And youth cannot be forgotten when
thinking of the masses. States rarely provide adequately
for their needs. Much of the present-day ills of youth can
perhaps bè traced to culture starvation, or what one might
perhaps call cultural Illiteracy.
We in India would not like the development of culture
to be equated with the development of arts, especially
literary, performing or plastic arts. We believe that through
culture, a hierarchy of values can be established in the
mind of the individual. Indeed, this Is the message of
traditional cultures, especially the culture of India. At no
point of the history of India was there any doubt regarding
the ultimate goal of life not in making man as comfortable
as possible, but in making him aware of his immense
possibilities for spiritual development.
Indian tradition stresses the need to develop the har¬
monious man who, says the Bhagavad Gita, does not cause
disharmony In the world, nor does the world cause
disharmony in him. ..
T.R. Jayaraman
Joint Secretary, Ministry of Education and Youth Services
Netherlands
Social security marks a major step forward, as also
have compulsory education and paid holidays. Modern
development would be pointless without making the same
sort of progress In cultural matters. Are the public author¬
ities then entitled to exert pressure and Influence, as
Orpheus tried to influence the destiny of Eurydice by des¬
cending to the underworld? The answer is evidently: no.
The mass media have their advantages and their draw¬
backs. We must live with both. We must encourage the
greatest creativity of the greatest number and this is
obviously a matter for the public authorities unless we
want passive receptivity to win; if it does, the spectators
will have given in, accepting this culture, wrapped and
laoelled like a pharmaceutical product.
The industrialized countries are certainly more cut off
from creative sources than countries less well off materially.
Where the sources have dried up, they must be renewed.
This requires a new type of organizer, who is not an
educator in the formal sense, or a psychoanalyst, and
still less a sergeant-major. He must be both fellow-
player and guide. Part of his rôle in continuing education
is to rid people of the idea that, however successful they
may be in economic matters, art and cultural activities are
beyond them.
Marga Klompe

The Swiss Confederation has four languages and three

### 52772: The Independence of Africa and cultural decolonization

The independence
of Africa
and cultural
decolonization
^^^ULTURE, In Its broadest
sense, is a way of life fashioned by a
people in their collective endeavour
to live and come to terms with their
total environment. It is the sum of
their art, their science and all their
social institutions, including their sys¬
tem of beliefs and rituals.
In the course of this creative
struggle and progress through history,
there evolves a body of material and
spiritual values which endow that
society with a unique ethos. Such
values are often expressed through the
people's songs, dances, folklore,
drawing, sculpture, their rites and
ceremonies.
Over the years these varieties of
artistic activity have come to symbo¬
lize the meaning of the word culture.
Any discussion of culture inevitably
centres around these activities, but we
must bear in mind that they are deriv¬
ed from a people's way of life- and
will change as that way of life is alter¬
ed, modified or developed through the
ages. In our present situation we
must, in fact, try to see how new
aspects of life can be clarified or given
expression through new art forms or
a renewal of the old.
We need to see Africa's cultural
history in three broad phases: Africa
before white conquest, Africa under
colonial domination, and today's Africa
striving to find its true self-image. To
do this is to indicate the obvious: that
the pressures, inside and outside, at
the different stages of her growingTup,
have changed Africa's cultural <needs
and outlook.
JAMES NGUGI of Kenya contributes regu¬
larly to the most important newspapers and
periodicals of East Africa. He has written
widely on questions of African culture and
traditions, and was formerly professor of
English Literature at the University of
Nairobi, Kenya.
by James Ngugi
Yesterday, for instance, there were
many ethnic groups, each with a dis¬
tinct, cohesive culture; today, these
groups are trying to form nations
within wider, more inclusive boundaries
of geography and politics. Hence we
should examine the role of culture in
our time within the new horizons, them¬
selves made hazy by the often conflict¬
ing calls of the tribe, the nation, Pan-
Africa and even the Third World.
Yet too often we talk of African
culture as if it were a static commodity
which can and should be rescued from
the ruins and shrines of yesterday and
brought onto a modern stage to be
eaten by Africa's children, who, long
lost in the labyrinth of foreign paths
in an unknown forest, are now thirsty
and hungry for the wholesome food of
their forefathers.
No living culture is ever static.
Collectively, human beings struggle to
master their physical environment and
in the process create a social one. A
change in the physical environment, or
more accurately, a change in the
nature of their struggle, will alter their
institutions and hence their mode of
life and thought Their new mode of
life and thought may in turn affect their
institutions and general environment.
It is a dialectical process.
A profound change in a people's
economy or In their dwelling-place
through trade and migration, will make
people organize themselves differently
to meet the new set of circumstances.
Their ¡deals and their values, over a
period, are also likely to alter. We
know that trade across the Sahara
brought new ideas and technological
innovations with marked effects on
some west African societies. The
southward movement of the people
along the Nile turned some hitherto
pastoral groups into tillers of the soil
demanding a new mode of life and
system of values.
Contrary to the myth and fiction of
our conquerors, Africa was always in
a turmoil of change with empires rising
and falling. African traditional struc¬
tures and cultures then were neither
static nor uniform. There were as
many cultures as there were peoples,
although we can recognize broad affi¬
nities that'enable us to talk meaning¬
fully of African values or civilizations.
Bearing this in mind, we can rightly
ask ourselves about the attitude to
artistic activities in traditional Africa.
For convenience we should distinguish
between the two categories of societies
identified in "African Political systems"
by M. Fortes and E.E. Evans-Pritchard:
"One group consists of those so¬
cieties which have centralized autho¬
rity, administrative machinery and judi¬
cial institutions in short, a govern¬
ment and in which cleavages of
wealth, privilege and status correspond
to the distribution of power and autho¬
rity... The other group consists of
those societies which lack centralized
authority, administrative machinery and
constituted judicial institutions in
short, which lack government and in
which there are no sharp divisions of
rank, status or wealth."
In the first group, for instance the
Yoruba of Nigeria and the Baganda of
Uganda, there was a more sharply
defined hierarchy with a degree of
specialization of functions. The sur¬
plus from the farmers fed professional
priests and priestesses (or political
office holders) tending the shrines of
the people's gods, and professional
sculptors and artisans in the courts of
the great.
In the other group, for instance the
Ibo of Nigeria and the Agikuyu of A_
Kenya, the rather loose, more egalita- yh
rian political set-up did not allow the
same degree of specialization of func¬
tions. Political office did not carry

economic privileges; it certainly did not
confer on the holder power over the
community's surplus or over the loot
from war to give him the ability to hire
special followers and specialized skills
to entertain him at leisure and to fur¬
ther enhance his stature.
Among the Agikuyu, for instance,
only a very tiny group of workers in
metal lived by their skill, exchanging
their wares for food and clothes.
Otherwise, the farmer also played
music, officiated in ceremonial dances,
recited poetry and stories around the
fireside and became a warrior in time
of conflict.
However, in both types of societies
art was functional; it was never, as in
modern Europe, severed from the phy¬
sical, social and religious needs of the
community. Discussing African art
(in "African Mythology"), Geoffrey
Parrinder makes a pertinent comment:
"Since African art was the only
'writing' known in the whole of tropical
Africa, it was used to interpret life in
every aspect. It was employed in reli¬
gious life, which was not separated
from other parts of life, to give spiri¬
tual meaning and function ,to objects
used in ceremonies of individual and
community... so African art provides a
sacred literature, giving beauty and
solemnity to the face of man."
Song, dance and music were similar¬
ly an Integral part of a community's
wrestling with its environment, part and
parcel of the needs and aspirations of
the ordinary man. There was never,
in any African society, the cult of the
artist with its bohemian priests and
high church around the banks of the
Seine or Thames. Today the artist in
Europe sees himself as an outsider,
living in a kind of individual culture, and
obeying only the laws of his imagina¬
tion. This Is the position of James
Joyce's hero in "Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man":
"I will tell you what I will do and
what I will not do. I will not serve that
in which I no longer believe, whether
it call Itself my home, my fatherland
or my church; and I will try to express
myself in some mode of life or art as
freely as I can and as wholly as I can,
using for my defence the only arms I
allow myself to use silence, exile and
cunning."
Such an art ministers to a culture of
the mind. It is the culture of Matthew
Arnold who urged the English middle
classes to strive for sweetness and
light by knowing the best that had been
thought and written in the world.
Then this individual man of culture,
as Arnold put it, could "carry others
along in his march towards perfec¬
tion, to be continually doing all he can
to enlarge and increase the volume of

In all parts of Africa, an
inexhaustible fund of popular
tales, poems, stories and
proverbs with a rich vein
of folk philosophy or a moral
to propose has been handed
down by word of mouth
from generation to generation.
Drawing inspiration from this
broad tradition of oral literature,
writers of modern Africa
have developed a uniquely
African style of writing
compounded of humour,
lyricism and eloquence. In
recent years, Unesco has
collected and published
transcripts of these ancient
oral traditions and, in
1971-1972, will publish three
books on African thought
based on oral examples.

the human stream sweeping thither¬
wards." With Arnold, culture becomes
an intellectual activity of the individual.
Ours used to be oriented to the com¬
munity. And because of its public
nature, culture, in its broad as well as
In its narrow sense, helped to weld
society together. The Integrative func¬
tion of culture as described by W.E.
Abraham in "The Mind of Africa",
holds particularly true of traditional
societies:
"Culture is an instrument for making
(mutual) sufferance and co-operation
natural. Its success depends upon
the extent to which it is allowed to be
self-authenticating. Though it allows
for internal discussion, and Is indeed
nourished thereby, the principles of
decision In such discussions are
themselves provided by culture.
"By uniting the people in common
beliefs, actions and values, culture fills
with order that portion of life which
lies beyond the pale of State Interven¬
tion... It fills it in such a way as at
the same time to integrate its society,
on the basis of common attitudes,
common values. It creates the basis
of the formulation of a common destiny
and co-operation in pursuing it."
Jomo Kenyatta's powerful book,
"Facing Mount Kenya", is a living
example of this integrative function of
culture at work. To read it is at once
to witness a world with an inner, dyna¬
mic spirit; it Is also an authentic refu¬
tation of the missionary condemnation
of what they, the semi-gods, thought
was savage and dark. Above all, It
shows very well the political and eco¬
nomic basis of culture. After discuss¬
ing all the aspects of Agikuyu life,
Kenyatta concludes with an aggressive
assertion of the basic role of culture In
a people's discovery of their identity:
"It Is all these aspects of life, "writes
Kenyatta", that make up a social cul¬
ture. And it is the culture which he
inherits that gives a man his human
dignity as well as his material pros¬
perity. It teaches him mental and moral
values and makes him feel it worth¬
while to work and fight for liberty."
It was these "mental and moral"
values that the European colonizer
was bent on destroying in the classical
tradition of Prospero. In the story of
Prospero and Caliban, Shakespeare,
in "The Tempest", had dramatized the
practice and psychology of colonization
years before It became a global phe¬
nomenon. It is worth quoting the
well-known scene in which Caliban
tells Prospero:
"...When thou cam'st first,

## [Page 29](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/052770engo.pdf#page=29) 0

### 52772: The Independence of Africa and cultural decolonization

Thou strok'st me and made much
[of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach
[me how
To name the bigger light, and how
[the less,
That burn by day and night; and then
[I lov'd thee
And show'd thee all the qualities
[o' th' Isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren
[place, and fertile.
Curs'd be I that did so . All the
[charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats light
[on you I
For I am all the subjects that you
[have,
Which first was mine own king; and
[here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep
[from me
The rest o' th' Island."
A number of things and attitudes
emerge from the play. Prospero, the
stranger on the island, comes with the
soft voice of the serpent. He is at first
friendly to Caliban, flatters him, but all
the time learning the secrets of the
island. To him Caliban has no culture
or meaningful past. He even gives
his language to Caliban.
And before Caliban knows it, Pros¬
pero has taken his land, has set up
a one-man government, and turns
Caliban into a slave-labourer. Ariel,
formerly Caliban's subject, is released
from bondage into a new one: he will
only be finally freed if he remains
Prospero's faithful servant and spy.
L
IIKE Prospero, the Euro¬
pean colonizer instinctively knew the
supreme importance of culture, knew
and feared the threat posed by men
with confidence in their own past and
heritage. Else why did he concentrate
his military might, his religious fervour,
and his intellectual energy in denying
that the African had true gods, had a
culture, had a significant past? The
missionary attacked the primitive rites,
the dances, the graven images, recoil¬
ing from their suggestion of satanic
sensuality. Some of the best minds
of Europe abetted this grand deception.
But what was of far-reaching effect
was the fact that, again like Prospero,
the European took away the material
base, and systematically dismantled
the political and economic institutions
on which the African had built his way
of life. In the egalitarian societies for
instance he imposed a chief, a central
visible focus of authority, where none
existed before. In the other category,
he removed the bases on which the
central authority had rested: the source
of political authority of the king was
no longer the people from whom he
demanded allegiance but to whom he
also owed duties.
In both cases, the traditional institu¬
tions were allowed to remain where
they further facilitated the thorough
exploitation of land in the settler colo¬
nies of east and central Africa, or the
exploitation of raw materials and mar¬
kets in the more commercial colonies
of west Africa. By Introducing an
aggressive money economy and new
educational and religious systems,
while denying the African the econo¬
mic and political power by which he
could control them, the European colo¬
nialist "put a knife on the things that
held us together and we have fallen
apart"
The effect of the colonial presence
was to create an élite who took on
the tongue and adopted the style of
the conquerors. They it was who
hearkened to the voice of the missio¬
nary's God, cried Halleluiah, and
raised their eyes to Heaven. They
derided the old gods and recoiled with
studied or a genuinely acquired horror
from the primitive rites of their people.
The rest, for the colonial system by
its very nature has room only for a
few, were often deprived of their land
and then herded into the settler's
farms or to urban centres to become
hewers and carriers of wood.
The first group lost contact with
their roots. They despised anything
that smelt of the primitive past. It is
this group mostly whom the Nigerian
writer Chinua Achebe must have had
in mind when he cried: "If I were god,
I would regard as the very worst our
acceptance for whatever reason of
racial inferiority."
The other group remained close to
the soil and never completely lost
contact with their traditions. The resi¬
lience of African culture was somehow
able to withstand a certain amount of
battering and propaganda. It is diffi¬
cult as Prospero finds out for colonial
domination to completely crush thé
human spirit.
In the struggle for independence,
the peasants and often the urban
workers invoked their ancestral gods
for strength to fight the foe. They
adapted traditional rhythms, songs and
dances to the new needs of the
struggle.
The intellectuals, the élite, the
middle-classes also found themselves
not quite accepted in the world of the
conquerors. Rejected by their coun¬
terparts in the white structure, their
humanity sometimes denied in the
name of race, they were as it were
thrown back onto the masses. They
started to reclaim their past, often
with bitter nostalgia.
Declared Alioune Diop, of Senegal,
at the first World Conference of Negro
Writers and Artists In Paris:
"There is this scandalous allegation of
peoples without culture. While it is
true that those who were really res¬
ponsible for colonization knowingly
fabricated this myth, it is nonetheless
surprising that generations of cultural
and spiritual authorities have conced¬
ed that men could live In a community
without culture."
B
ECAUSE he knew that this
"scandalous allegation" was also em¬
bodied in European books, especially
fiction, on Africa, the African writer
tried to answer by asserting in the
books he wrote that Africa had a cul¬
ture as good as any. The négritude
movement was a cultural phenomenon
playing a political role. It was gener¬
ally realized that a community depriv¬
ed of its political liberty would find
it difficult to recreate an ¡mage of its
past and confidently look at the future.
The realization was general, at times
vague, The belief has persisted,
among most African intellectuals,
artists and politicians that "cultural
liberation is an essential condition for
political liberation". And since they
think of culture only in terms of
dances, the jungle drums and folklore,
they think it enough if they assert the
need for their revival.
But it is wrong to think of culture
as prior to politics. Political and
economic liberation is the essential
condition for cultural liberation, for the
true release of a people's creative
spirit and imagination. It is when peo¬
ple are involved in the active work
of destroying an inhibitive social
structure and building a new one, that
they begin to see themselves. They
are born again.
Today, after regaining their independ¬
ence, most African countries are
committed to developing a distinctive

CULTURAL DECOLONIZATION (Continued)
A pernicious pyramid based on race

national culture. In some cases, they
have even set up agencies to promote
it. Yet little has been done to trans¬
late this commitment into action.
This, in part, is due to the wrong
attitudes towards culture. There are
people, honest people, who confuse
culture with an irrelevant traditio¬
nalism; it is surely not possible to lift
traditional structures and cultures
intact into modern Africa. A mean¬
ingful culture is the one born out of
the present hopes and especially the
hopes of an impoverished peasantry,
and that of the growing body of urban
workers most of whom have lost
contact with the soil.
There are still other people who
believe that you can somehow main¬
tain colonial economic and other
social institutions and graft on them
an African culture. We have seen
that colonial institutions can only pro¬
duce a colonial mentality. The trouble,
of course, is that many African middle
classes helped to smother the revolu¬
tionary demands of the majority of
peasants and workers and negotiated
a treaty of mutual trust with the colo¬
nial white power structure.
In fighting for independence, most
of the African intelligentsia only
wanted that which was forbidden to
them, or rather they saw the struggle
in terms of their immediate needs
nurtured in any case by the social
position they had attained under the
colonial system, but whose fulfilment
was frustrated by the racism inherent
in the system. They wanted to wear
the same clothes and shoes, get the
same salary, live in the same kind of
mansions as their white counterparts
of similar qualifications.
After independence, the racial bar¬
rier to their needs was broken. The
gold-rush for the style of living of
their former conquerors had started.
Skin lighteners, straightened hair, irre¬
levant drawing-room parties, cons¬
picuous consumption in the form of
large estates, country villas, Mercedes
and Bentley cars became the order of
the day. Yet some of these will
verbally, tenaciously cling and sing
hymns of praise to a mythical past.
If we are to achieve true national
cultures we must recognize our situa¬
tion. That means we must thoroughly
examine our social and economic
structures and see if they are truly
geared to meeting the real needs, and
to releasing the energy of the masses.
Any ideal, any vision, is nothing unless
it is given Institutional forms.
This recognition is at the heart of
the now famous Arusha declaration
in Tanzania. The declaration shows
that Tanzanians are aware that most
African countries, though independent
in name, are still in a semi-colonial
state. In the words of the President of
Tanzania, Julius Nyerere: "We have
been oppressed a great deal, we have
been exploited a great deal and we
have been degraded a great deal. It
is our weakness that has led to our
being oppressed, exploited, disregard¬
ed. Now we want a revolution a
revolution which brings to an end our
weakness so that we are never again
exploited, oppressed and humiliated."
w
HILE ultimately the devel¬
opment of a meaningful self-image is
dependent on the complete reorgani¬
zation of social structures (this is abso¬
lutely basic) we must also create prac¬
tical, specific policies to facilitate the
emergence of new attitudes and art
forms.
In this the role of education is vital.
The colonial system produced the kind
of education which nurtured subser¬
vience, self-hatred, and mutual suspi¬
cion. It produced a people without
true roots in any culture. Often there
was racial discrimination in the allo¬
cation of school, of teachers, of teach¬
ing facilities.
In the whole of east, central and
south Africa, for instance, there were
schools for Europeans, for Asians and
for Africans. There were toilets for
Europeans, for Asians and then for
Africans. Society was a racial pyra¬
mid: the European minority at the top,
the Asian in the middle, and the Afri¬
can forming the base.
The educational system reflected
this inequality. It encouraged a slave
mentality, with a reverent awe for the
achievements of Europe. Europe was
the centre of the universe. Africa was
discovered by Europe: it was an exten¬
sion of Europe. So in history, people
learnt about the rise of the Anglo-
Saxon "race" as if they were the true
ancestors of the human race. Even
the geography of the rocks of Europe
had to be studied first before coming
to Africa.
Today, the more blatant racial
aspects of our education have been
removed. But the actual educational
system which aimed at producing
subservient minds, which at the same
time looked down upon the rural pea¬
santry and the urban workers, has not
been radically altered. In our schools,
in our universities, Europe tends to
be at the centre. And the shift of
emphasis has been on producing men
born to rule!
Only recently a very important
controversy broke at the University
College, Nairobi, when a group of
lecturers questioned the validity of an
English Department, the only depart¬
ment concerned with literary studies,
which continued teaching British
literature in the heart of indepen¬
dent Africa.
This chauvinistic, basically colonial
approach to the study of humanities
was justified on the grounds that
people needed to study the historic
continuity of a single culturel Under¬
lying this was an assumption that the
British traditions and the emergence
of the modern West were the central
root of our consciousness and cultural
heritage. It was the contention of the
lecturers that:
"If there is need for a study of
the historic continuity of a single
culture, why can't this be African?
Why can't African Literature be at
the centre so that we can view other
cultures in relationship to it?"
Towards this end, they demanded
the abolition of the English department
and the setting up, in its place, of
a department devoted mainly to Afri¬
can literature and languages. The
Department of Literature would teach
modern African writing in English and
French, Afro-American and Caribbean
literature and a selected course in
European literary tradition. But at the
core of such a department would be
the study of oral tradition in African
literature.
The importance of the oral tradition
in African schools and universities
can never be too over-emphasized.
Such a study would be important both
in rehabilitating our minds, a recourse
to the roots, but also in helping Afri¬
can writers to innovate and break
away from the European literary main¬
stream. As Abiola Inde, of Nigeria, has
stated: "(Already) one may note that
African literature in the European lan¬
guages lays claim to being differentiat¬
ed from the metropolitan literatures not
only In Its content but also to some
extent In its form. Its originality comes
from the recourse made by our writers
not only to African themes and sub¬
jects, and to elements of folklore, but
also to stylistic innovations derived
from the formal features of traditional
African literature.
To make all this possible funds
should be available to enable a

### 52772: The Independence of Africa and cultural decolonization

thorough collection and codifying of a
country's folklore. This is an area in
which international bodies, by provid¬
ing money, could really help.
Equally important for our cultural
renaissance, is the teaching and
study of African languages. We have
already seen what any colonial system
does: impose its tongue on the subject
races, and then downgrade the ver¬
nacular tongues of the people. By
so doing they make the acquisition
of their tongue a status symbol;
anyone who learns it begins to despise
the peasant majority and their barbaric
tongues. By acquiring the thought
process and the values of his adopted
tongue, he becomes alienated from
the value-system of his mother tongue.
Language after all is a carrier of
values fashioned by a people over a
period of time. It seems to me that
in a country where ninety per cent
speak African languages, it is very
unwise not to teach these in schools
and colleges. We need to develop a
national language but not at the dire
expense of the regional languages.
That a study of our own languages
is important for a meaningful self-
image is increasingly being realized.
Increased study of African languages
will inevitably make more Africans
want to write in their mother tongues
and thus open new avenues for our
creative imagination.
c
^^CHOOLS of drama and
music should also be set up in African
universities, and not as mere focuses
for the academic study of African
music and drama but as nerve-controls
for experiments in new forms and
structures. Orchestras and drama
companies resident at the university
must go out to the villages and urban
areas.
The university should also be
accessible to regional music and
drama groups to ensure a healthy
mutual exchange of ideas and skills.
In connexion with this, travelling
theatre companies can be encourag¬
ed. The Makerere College students
have been running one for three
years. They play in remote towns,
and villages; in this way, they have
aroused wide interest in drama in
Uganda's countryside.
This is something which could be
organized on a national and more
regular basis. As in the case of
folklore, we need a library of African

CULTURAL DECOLONIZATION (Continued)
A society founded on co-operation
not on ruthless grab-and-take
recorded music and a good collection
of various types of musical instru¬
ments in the country.
Most African universities and
schools have departments of Fine Art
where students go to learn sculpture,
drawing, and design. This approach
to art in most such departments is
too academic, and their products, too
abstract. The subject matter and the
execution being so abstract in the
Western mainstream, and the prices
being so high, only tourists can buy
them. Often our artists paint or sculpt
with one eye on these patrons.
This ought to change. First, the
academic criterion for entering a
school of fine art should be removed
or radically modified to make It
possible for village artists to use the
facilities. Even the selection of
teachers should not be on mere aca¬
demic qualification.
After all, those African sculptors
who influenced Picasso and Henry
Moore had not been trained in
Western academic institutions. They
moulded from a need arising out of
the total religious involvement with
the community. If a radical approach
to art centres were adopted, we would
be able to tap the artistic resources
and skills In each country.
And we must set up national galler¬
ies to collect any available traditional
sculpture and crafts and to prevent
the most talented of our contemporary
output from going to another country.
This would have the further advantage
of rescuing our artists from their
present dependence on the patronage
of the tourist.
T,
32
HE above suggestions in¬
dicate how important the educational
institutions are in the creation of a
people's self-image. A radical re¬
structuring of our facilities should not
be confined to the arts alone but to
science, medicine, geography, in fact
every aspect of learning so that Africa
becomes the centre. The universities
and our schools should go to the
countryside, there must be total invol¬
vement with the creative struggle of
the peasants if we are to find oursel¬
ves. Country and universities will be
revitalized.
One of the most popular and readily
accepted things in Africa is the need
to revive and develop our ethnic
dances. Towards this end dance
ensembles like The Heartbeat of Africa
in Uganda have been formed. There
are many more in west Africa. Yet
two attitudes to these companies pre¬
vail. For one, they are mostly seen
as a means of exporting African
culture to the outside world. While
this has helped to popularize African
dances In Europe and America, yet it
reveals the same tourist dependence
complex.
Dance and our other artistic pro¬
ducts are primarily for home con¬
sumption. This way there will be a
mutual nourishing effect between the
audience and the performing artists.
The national ensembles should be
such that they would stimulate commu¬
nal dance activities all over the coun¬
try. The Heartbeat of Africa is having
this effect in Uganda where small dance
teams keep on mushrooming even In
the remote villages.
Another attitude is that which sees
our job as mere revival of old dances
without much attempt at innovation or
transformation to make them more
relevant to the present. A dance,
like any other art, should reflect
a people's experience and needs.
Otherwise such dances will become
mere curiosity pieces like Scottish
country dancing, for the tourist in
search of the real primitive thing.
My view is that national dancing
troupes should be selected from
among the best dancers all over the
country; this should be a professional
group willing to learn as many differ¬
ent dances as possible. They should
also be willing to experiment espe¬
cially with the possibilities offered by
marrying dance to music and drama.
At the same time, village or regional
groups should be encouraged. After
all, it is from these villagers that the
national troupe will be getting its
nourishment.
I believe that all these activities,
important as they are, would be mean¬
ingless unless seen in the context of
the kind of society we want. Our
activities should not be aimed at
enhancing reactionary traditionalism
and irrelevant tribal solidarity. After
all, traditional tribal or ethnic unities
are irrelevant and reactionary now
that the economic bases on which
they rested have been removed.
In an interview with the Cuban ma¬
gazine "Tricontinental", the leader of
the Liberation Movement in Guinea and
Cape Verde, Amilcar Cabrai, tackled
this question as far as it affected his
guerilla forces against Portuguese
colonialism:
"We believe that when the colonia¬
lists arrived in Africa the tribal struc¬
ture was already in a state of disinte¬
gration due to the evolution of the
economy and historical events on the
African scene. Today it cannot be
said that Africa is tribal. Africa still
has some remnants of tribalism, in
particular as far as the mentality of
the people is concerned, but not in
the economic structure itself. More¬
over, if colonialism, through its action,
did anything positive at all, it was
precisely to destroy a large part of
the existing remnants of tribalism in
certain parts of the country."
w
E want to create a revolu¬
tionary culture which is not narrowly
confined by the limitations of tribal
traditions or national boundaries, but is
outward looking to Pan-Africa and the
Third World.
Having decided on this, then we
can utilize all the resources at our
disposal the radio, the television,
the film, schools, universities, youth
movements, farmers' co-operatives
to create such a society (the film
especially has great possibilities in
Africa where many people are still
illiterate. But the film industry in
Africa is practically non-existent). This
way we shall find new strength and
a new dynamic.
Talking to teachers at Dar es
Salaam last year, Julius Nyerere urged
them to teach to produce strength In
the context of the revolutionary aims
of the Arusha Declaration:
"Otherwise you will teach to pro¬
duce clerks as the colonialists did.
You will not be teaching fighters but
a bunch of slaves or semi-slaves. Get
your pupils out of the colonial menta¬
lity. You have to produce tough
people; stubborn youths who can do
something, not hopeless youths."
Any true national culture which
can produce such healthy "stubborn
youth", a culture that nurtures a so¬
ciety based on co-operation and not
ruthless exploitation, ruthless grab-
and-take, a culture that is born of a
people's collective labour; such a
culture will be best placed to contri¬
bute something truly positive and
original to the modern world.

Unesco awards
international science prizes
Two international prizes for science were
awarded by Unesco in a double ceremony
at its Paris H.Q. on November 12. Pro¬
fessor Konrad Lorenz, a leading authority
on animal physiology and behaviour, receiv¬
ed the Kalinga Prize for the popularization
of science; and the Unesco Science Prize
"for an outstanding contribution to
science and technology in a developing
State or region" was awarded jointly to
the International Rice Research Institute,
at Los Banos, Philippines and the Inter¬
national Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center, Mexico.
The two institutes were selected for
the part they have played in the "Green
Revolution", by developing high-yield, dis¬
ease and pest-resistant varieties of wheat
and rice a major contribution to the world
war on hunger.
The Kalinga prize-winner, Professor
Lorenz, is director of the Max Planck
Institute (Physiology of Behaviour) at See-
wiesen, Fed. Rep. of Germany, and author
of such widely-known books as "King
Solomon's Ring", "On Aggression" and
"Studies in Animal and Human Behaviour."
Unesco aid to Pakistan
Unesco is to give $50,000 worth of
assistance for reconstruction work follow¬
ing the tidal disaster in East Pakistan.
Announcing this, Unesco's Executive Board
called on all Member States to co-operate
with the Pakistan government in the
reconstruction of educational and cultural
property. The programme approved by
Unesco's recent General Conference
included a resolution from Pakistan calling
for the study of disaster prevention and
reconstruction.
The rising tide of population
World population will double to reach
more than 7 thousand million in the next
36 years if current trends continue, says
the latest annual United Nations Demogra¬
phic Yearbook. The world population
growth rate of 1.9 per cent per year was
constant in 1969 for the third consecutive
year. Other Yearbook statistics for 1969:
56 per cent of the world's people lived
in Asia, 6.7 per cent in the Soviet Union,
6.3 per cent in North America, 13 per cent
in Europe. The most populous countries:
Mainland China (740 million) and India
(537 million).
Problems of the human
environment
The "Unesco Courier" wishes to draw
the attention of readers to the fact that
the article "Man Killer of Nature" which
appeared under the signature of U Thant,
Secretary-General of the United Nations,
in our August-September 1970 issue on
Man and Violence, was not a signed article
by the Secretary-General, but an edited
version of the Secretary-General's report
"Problems of the Human Environment",
presented to the U.N. Economic and Social
Council in July 1969.
Air-polluted city?
The world's worst air-polluted city is
Seoul, capital of the Republic of Korea,
and not Tokyo or New York, according to
"Asian Student", published by The Asia
Foundation, in San Francisco. A recent
survey, it says, shows that 30 tons of dust
particles fall in one square kilometre space
in Seoul's suburban industrial area of
Yongdongpo in a month. Some 4,000
buses with outdated diesel engines belch¬
ing out black exhaust smoke contribute to
the gases.
Arab weekly
for new literates
The first number of "El Murshid", an
Arabic weekly specially designed for easy
reading by new literates, has been publish¬
ed in Rabat by the Moroccan news agency,
Maghreb Arabe Presse. The weekly em¬
ploys extra large Arabic characters, show¬
ing the vowel sounds customarily omitted
in written Arabic. It focuses on cultural
and scientific topics.
Images of Osaka-70
The fantastic spectacle of last year's
World Exposition at Osaka, Japan a show¬
case of the world, past, present and future,
condensed into 800 acres is captured in
"Osaka", an album of 500 remarkable pho¬
tographs by Bruno Suter and Peter Knapp,
published by Editions Hermann, Paris (see
Bookshelf).
Symbol
of racial
equality
The United Nations has designated 1971
as "International Year for Action to Combat
Racism and Racial Discrimination." The
design shown here has been chosen as
the symbol for this international campaign
to promote awareness of the evils of
apartheid, racial discrimination and segre¬
gation. It symbolizes the concept of equa¬
lity and non-discrimination on grounds of
race, colour and ethnic origin.
Flashes...
Arabic is to have equal status with
English, French, Spanish and Russian as
a Unesco working language.
Plans for a 5,000 mile long Trans-
Amazon highway system are being studied
by Brazil's Ministry of Transport.
The U.S.S.R. Commission for Unesco
has begun publication of a quarterly "Bulle¬
tin" , with Russian, English, French and

Letters to the Editor
OF MICE AND MEN
Sir,
On reading your .Issue "Man and
Violence" (August-September 1970), I
was amazed that you gave the greatest
amount of space and consideration to
the work of laboratory experimenters
and those who deduce human nature
from the behaviour of lower animals.
Laboratory experimenters into animal
as well as human behaviour of necessi¬
ty leave out questions of love, wisdom
and beauty these attributes being
beyond the scope of their experiments.
Yet these attributes do, or at least,
can, exist in men, and these make us
somewhat different to other animals.
And why must the "Unesco Courier"
think that those who deduce human
nature from the behaviour of mice,
monkeys and cats are "scientific" and
then leave out consideration of the
work done by the existential psycho¬
logists who have done research into
the specifically human side of human
nature?
What about leaders such as Mahat¬
ma Gandhi and Martin Luther King?
In an issue of the "Unesco Courier"
looking for solutions to aggressiveness,
these and other such leaders in peace
deserve as much space and consid¬
eration as do mice, monkeys and cats.
I write this letter with all the best
wishes for your magazine.
Malcolm Schosha
Florence, Italy
Our October 1969 number was en¬
tirely devoted to "Gandhi and the heri¬
tage of non-violence" . An article in the
same issue paid tribute to Martin Luther
King and his struggle for racial equality.
See also letter below - Editor.
EXAMPLES FOR THE WORLD
Sir,
Among many interesting subjects pre¬
sented in the "Unesco Courier", I
would single out "Arts and Man",
"Youth", "The Working Woman" and,
above all, the issue devoted to Mahat¬
ma Gandhi (October 1969). Gandhi
may be little known ¡n some European
countries, but having recently visited
India I realize how his life and work
have Influenced its people. It is admi¬
rable for a magazine as international as
the "Unesco Courier" to be concerned
with great men of our time and major
world problems.
Martine Leniau
Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire, France
WAR IS NOT IN OUR GENES
Sir,
1 quote from "War Is Not In Our
Genes" ("Unesco Courier", August-Sep¬
tember, 1970): "If aggression is a
doom carried in human genes, we are
predestined to wage wars and hopes for
peace would seem to be slim."
Surely the potential for aggression ¡s
the tendency of animals individuals,
groups, species to secure for themsel¬
ves, within their environments, adequate
supplies of whatever is necessary for
survival and comfort. To this extent, at
least, I think aggression is in our genes.
But man, being a reasoning animal, will
tend to be more aggressive than other
creatures in the belief that more
aggression means more of whatever is
desired. And his environment is the
whole world? solar system? universe?
But is not our intelligence, which
makes us so dangerous a species,
capable of maturing to the point where
it would choose to control that over-
aggression which intelligence, itself
gives birth to? The question is: can
we make it mature in time?

'BIG TOP': BIG TOPIC
Sir,
The circus has existed in its present
form for 200 years, but it ¡s one of the
oldest, ¡f not the oldest form of enter¬
tainment in the world.
During the many years that I have
been a reader of the "Unesco Courier"
you have never written about the circus.
Although the circus has occasionally
been used for political propaganda, ¡t
remains the most international and most
widely understandable form of enter¬
tainment and the one that snaps its
fingers at frontiers.
Denis Heifer
Lausanne, Switzerland
THE PROBLEM
AT EVERYONE'S FRONT DOOR
Sir,
I believe the "Unesco Courier" is
one of the most valuable magazines
available anywhere in that it encom¬
passes every phase of life.
At the present time there are many
organizations vitally concerned with
"ecological environment". At the Brit¬
ish Columbia Federation of Labour
Convention last week, one such organi¬
zation, "SPEC", operating in our area,
had a booth. In anticipation, I had
taken three copies of the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" with me: "Water and Life" (July-
August 1964), "Can We Keep Our
Planet Habitable?" (January, 1969), and
"Man in Quest of Water" (June, 1970).
When they tried to explain the functions
of SPEC to me I asked them if they
had ever read the "Unesco Courier".
They continued to try to explain the
problem to me as though it was some¬
thing new. So I showed them the
issues of the "Unesco Courier" I had
with me, and when I showed them the
picture on page 7 of the June 1970 issue
[detergent foam polluting a French
river], a young lady at the booth kept
smiling and asked me ¡f I could not
see that it was a floating ice pack.
Then I started explaining, and when I
had finished, she suggested I should
come on the executive of SPEC, a
branch of the Canadian Scientific &
Environmental Control Society. I item
ized the organizations I am already
active in, and I just don't have time
for any more unless I stop working for
a living.
Then she said I sounded as if I was
trying to sell the "Unesco Courier". I
said it was urgent that all the people
who were Interested ¡n SPEC should
subscribe to the "Unesco Courier",
which has shown what needs to be
done for a long time already, but that
too many people do not take action
until the problem comes to their front
door.
William Giesbrecht
Vancouver, Canada
INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUE
Sir,
We read constantly of nation oppos¬
ing nation by force, but little ¡s heard
of a dialogue between nations. Why
not publish a column entitled "Dia¬
logue", a forum for reports, disagree¬
ments and discussions by correspon¬
dence concerning the various cultures
and systems of education.
I know it is not Unesco's role to inter¬
vene directly. Its real task is to
promote and guide international dis¬
cussions based on mutual respect and
understanding, thereby fulfilling Its
purpose under Article I of Its Consti¬
tution: "To promote collaboration among
the nations through education, science
and culture in order to further universal
respect for justice, for the rule of law,
and for human rights and fundamental
freedoms..."
Christophe Berchem
Obercorn, Luxemburg
WORSE THAN CIGARETTES 7
Sir,
I wholeheartedly agree with Sir
George Godber ("Cigarettes and Can¬
cer", May 1970) that stopping ciga¬
rette smoking would drastically decrease
premature death and disabilities in
Britain and elsewhere.
But equally wholeheartedly I do not
agree with his statement that, "There
is no other single avoidable cause of
so much premature death and disabi¬
lity in Britain today as the smoking of
cigarettes." Alcohol, in my opinion, is
responsible for far more deaths and
disabilities than cigarettes, in Britain
and many other countries. And alcohol
is just as avoidable as cigarettes.
Further, any comparison of the problems
caused by alcohol vs. cigarettes would
immediately reveal that immensely more
social problems are caused by the
former. One seldom hears of broken
homes, mental institution admissions,
homicides and other crimes resulting
from smoking cigarettes. Alcohol
causes all these social problems, which
are probably more serious than the
physical ones of premature death and
disability. And yet few voices are
raised against drinking. Why not
devote an entire Issue to the problems
and human misery caused by alcohol?

SHIMMERING JEWELS
ON THE PIAZZA SAN MARCO
In this photo, buildings and monuments of St. Mark's Square, Venice, seen
from the waters of the lagoon, form a mosaic of phantom-like shapes
(foreground right, Palace of the Doges and column surmounted by the lion
of St. Mark; left, the square's soaring belltower). In this original interpretation
of a classic scene, our Italian photographer has recreated a work that might
have come from the brush of Joseph Turner, the English painter and
forerunner of Impressionism (1775-1851), in which forms lose their structure
and solidity, existing merely for the misty light and air which envelops them.
