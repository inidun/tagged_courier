'Barefoot" architects
Patterned on the successful Chinese system
of "barefoot" doctors (local people trained
to provide a basic level of health services in
remote rural areas), schemes are now being
elaborated, with Unesco support, for the
training of "barefoot" architects who
would be able to help solve the major prob
lems of villages or marginal urban set¬¨
tlements. In Thailand the "barefoot" ar¬¨
chitects of Baan Nong Pai ("Bamboo
village") have adapted techniques tradi¬¨
tionally used in basket weaving to create
patterned walls and shutters for a pre¬¨
school child-care centre.

Editorial
THIS issue of the Unesco Courier is concerned with a
crucial world problem: the extraordinary phenomenon
of urbanization today and its far-reaching implications
for tomorrow.
By the year 2000 half the people on Earth will be living in
cities facing acute problems of housing, transport, food and
water supply, schooling, sanitation and security. The lion's
share of urban growth is taking place in the developing coun¬¨
tries whose drama of rampant urbanization dwarfs the
problems of urban stagnation and inner city decay encountered
in the industrialized world. With their services already over¬¨
burdened by their present populations, Third World cities exer¬¨
cise a magnetic attraction on the people of their surrounding
rural areas, luring a massive influx of migrants for whom the
bitter reality is not streets paved with gold but a desperate strug¬¨
gle for survival in slums and shantytowns. Our article "The
World's Urban Explosion", in which these and other aspects of
the crisis of the world's cities are evoked, is based on the report
of an international symposium held in Paris in October 1984
and attended by more than 800 people from 70 cities.
Awareness of the consequences of rapid population growth
and urbanization has grown considerably since the United Na¬¨
tions World Population Conference held in Bucharest in 1974.
Last year, in Mexico City, a second International Conference
on Population was convened by the United Nations to review
and appraise the World Population Plan of Action adopted at
Bucharest. As part of its input to the Mexico City Conference
Unesco prepared a study, Unesco, Population and Develop¬¨
ment, from which we publish salient extracts.
Almost one third of this issue is devoted to a presentation of
the prizewinning projects in a Unesco World Competition for
Young Architects on the theme of "Tomorrow's Habitat",
organized on the occasion of International Youth Year 1985.
The projects are being exhibited at the International Exhibition
in Tsukuba, Japan, from 17 March to 16 September this year.
The Chairman of the Jury for the Competition was Kenzo
Tange and our presentation of the prizewinning projects is
prefaced by an article in which this celebrated Japanese ar¬¨
chitect and city planner looks back over almost half a century
on the ideas and theories that have shaped his work.
Two more of this month's contributors are internationally
renowned architects: Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the prin¬¨
cipal buildings of Brasilia, Brazil's capital, whose conception of
a city for the year 2000 attaches due importance to the role of
culture, recreation and leisure in urban life; and Hassan Fathy
of Egypt who outlines a plan for Cairo tomorrow.
Finally, Jean Dethier, a Belgian architect specializing in the
use of unbaked earth, examines a possible solution to housing
problems opened up by the modernization of traditional
methods of building with this readily available material.

### 63234: Tomorrow's habitat: an international competition for young architects
m.
An international competition
for young architects
AS part of its activities to mark International Youth Year,
Unesco, in collaboration with the International Union of
Architects, has organized a world competition for young
architects on the theme "Tomorrow's Habitat". Seventy-two
countries announced that they would participate in the competi¬¨
tion and would organize a national competition to select five pro¬¨
jects from among works submitted by students of architecture
and young architects under the age of thirty-five.
Entrants were required to submit a project on two boards, each
measuring 700 mm by 1,000 mm, showing their design for a
model dwelling set in the socio-cultural context of their country,
in harmony with their environment and taking into account the
most appropriate scientific and technological advances.
In May 1 984 an eight-member international jury met at Unesco
Headquarters in Paris to choose ten prizewinning entries from
among those selected in the national competitions. According to
the terms of the competition, the winning projects were to be built
in model form and exhibited in the "World Peace PavilionThe
United Nations Family" at the international exhibition being held
at Tsukuba, Japan, from 17 March to 16 September 1985. The
main theme of the exhibition is "Dwellings and Surroundings-
Science and Technology for man at home". With the co¬¨
operation of Japan Airlines, a two-week trip to Tokyo and
"Tsukuba Expo.85" was awarded by Unesco to the ten prizewin¬¨
ners. (In the case of a group project, the team is to select its
representative for the trip).
In its assessment of the entries, the Jury noted that "The whole
concept of the future and the notion of 'tomorrow' differ from one
socio-cultural context to another... Many architects admit that it
is difficult even to design contemporary housing fully consonant
with the needs and aspirations of today's men and women.
Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that tomorrow's habitat is
being built today, using the theoretical and technical knowledge
of our time, and that in many countries such a habitat can only
be created by adapting a greater or lesser proportion of the ex¬¨
isting stock of buildings.
"The many projects submitted... reveal that the different coun¬¨
tries are motivated by a great variety of concerns. Apart from the
purely Utopian or dream-world projects, there are a large number
of entries that show some degree of realism and demonstrate
that young architects are concerned not only with the way their
project fits into its environment but also with how it fits in with
society. Furthermore, many projects indicate that the training of
architects has undergone extreme diversification over the past
few years and that many schools in developing countries are now
showing a great deal of intellectual independence and a com¬¨
plete awareness of the specific features of the socio-cultural con¬¨
text in the country or region in which their graduates will have to
work."
The prizewinning projects are presented from page 8 to page
17. They are preceded by a text, beginning this page, in which
the president of the jury, Kenzo Tange, describes his conception
of architecture and urbanism. Quotations in captions accompa¬¨
nying the projects are from texts written by the entrants
themselves.

### 63236: Architecture and the city
Architecture
by Kenzo Tange
WHEN I graduated from university
in 1938, modern architecture
was already a prey to the snares
of formalism. The modern movement,
which styled itself rationalism or func-
tionalism, had rejected all past traditions
and styles and was dominated by the idea
that the "white box" (which is actually only
a starting point) was the ultimate goal. AH
negation of the past was willingly in¬¨
tegrated. I could not help but think that this
kind of contemporary architecture had
already lost its vital force. At that time I was
strongly influenced by Le Corbusier, who
seemed to me to stand alone in setting his
work on the level of architectural art.
I was also strongly attracted by
Renaissance architecture and by
Michelangelo.
Study of Michelangelo enabled me to
understand the grandeur of ancient Greece

and the city
and Rome. I was particularly interested in a
series of vast drawings depicting agoras and
forums. At the same period I was an en¬¨
thusiastic admirer of classical Japanese ar¬¨
chitecture and above all of the temple of
Ise, one of Japan's most sacred Shinto
shrines, which seemed to me a prototype of
Japanese architecture, and of the Katsura
Imperial Palace at Kyoto.
In 1946 I was asked to work on the plan
for the reconstruction of Hiroshima. This
experience was of paramount importance
for me, enabling me as it did to glimpse the
difficulty of rooting contemporary ar¬¨
chitecture in Japanese reality, behind which
we could still discern the weight of
tradition.
At that time there was a growing debate
about tradition. I felt my own interest shift
away from the Yayoi tradition, the basis of
aristocratic society, towards the popular
Jomon tradition. In a sense the Yayoi
culture could be considered as refined,
Apollonian, and the Jomon culture as crude
and Dionysiac. But if tradition acted for me
as a catalyst, stimulating the development
of my ideas and present at the conception
and preparation of my projects, it did not
appear as such in the final result. Concern
with tradition was related to our design ap¬¨
proach but our methodology was a question
of a different order.
The starting point of our methodology
was a critical attitude towards func-
tionalism. The different functions of a
building are as numerous as its users. The
totality of these functions had to be taken
into account.
In the case of a city hall, for example, it
is clear that all kinds of requirements im¬¨
posed by the mayor, the councillors, the
staff, and visitors, must be considered. In
view of this diversity, it is of crucial impor¬¨
tance in a methodological approach to
know what the real function of a city hall is.
At this point the concept of typology of
functions appears.
From all these arbitrary demands and
functions we select those which seem the
most human, the most essential, the most
future-orientated: accompanied by a
metaphysical content, the typology of func¬¨
tions thus comes to have a symbolic value.
My work on Hiroshima enabled me to
develop certain concepts which brought in¬¨
to play the relationship between architec¬¨
ture and the city. The Centre and the Park
of Peace became the heart of the city-
memorial of Hiroshima...
I then came to realize the need for an ad¬¨
ditional element to the four functions defin¬¨
ed in the Athens Charter*, one capable of
endowing the city with a sense of entity and
centrality. This element was the "urban
core", a structural concept through which
other cities could be provided with organic
entity, like Hiroshima. I understood that
where meeting places for the population
were concerned, the architect's interpreta¬¨
tion should go beyond the functional and
should embrace more general concepts.
Strongly aware of the role of information
in our society, I began to feel that urban and
architectural space, formerly open and un-
confined, actually exercised a force of at¬¨
traction. I felt increasingly that space,
which I had previously interpreted as being
created by the separation of physical ob¬¨
jects, actually exercised a force which held
these objects together. I slowly came to con¬¨
sider space as a truly active binding force.
My certainty that this was so caused a basic
change in my way of thinking about ar¬¨
chitecture and city planning.
Structures exist in several dimensions.
Dynamic relationships have physical struc¬¨
tures. Structures permit the association of'
elements. Space itself transmits messages to >
people. In linguistic terms, structure'
establishes the grammar of messages. It is
the channel whereby people can com¬¨
municate among themselves. We came to ^
The Athens Charter stemmedfrom the fourth
International Congress of Modern Architecture
(CIAM) in 1933 and dealt with what were con¬¨
sidered the four primary functions of the city:
dwelling, recreation, work, and transport.

### 63236: Architecture and the city
the conclusion that it is impossible to
understand a building, a group of
buildings, or urban space, without in¬¨
troducing the concept of" structure into our
thinking.
The proposal for structural reorganiza¬¨
tion contained in our Plan for Tokyo in
1960 was a first step towards a structural
rather than a functional approach. In this
plan, we attempted to comprehend the
structure of Tokyo in terms of mobility and
communications. We then proposed a
structural reorganization which would
transform the city from its enclosed, cen¬¨
tripetal structure to an open, linear and ex¬¨
pandable structure.
From this approach the concept of the ur¬¨
ban axis was born, a concept which is now
almost universally accepted.
In the Plan for Tokyo, the urban axis was
a symbolic as well as a physical structure.
In the 1970s the complexity and diversity
of world problems became even greater
than before. Politically, the world had to
face tensions between East and West and
North and South. All aspects of the pro¬¨
blems which arose were so closely interlink¬¨
ed that independent solutions to individual
problems became impossible. A
multidimensional approach was required to
understand what was happening. Previous¬¨
ly seen in terms of linear equations, pro¬¨
blems now had to be solved by multi¬¨
dimensional equations. Some even claimed
that no approach was perfectly acceptable.
They decided to leave the field and to
sidetrack the issue by talking of the diversity
of criteria of values.
But in my opinion, what emerged from
all this was not diversity but confusion.
In such a period, there is a tendency to
lose the architect in the labyrinthine com¬¨
plexities of the information society. Feeling
that he can trust no one but himself, the ar¬¨
chitect falls back on a highly individual
aesthetic. Historically, in fin de si√®cle
periods, people have tended to put all their
faith in beauty alone, to become aesthetes
who, incapable of judging the kind of beau¬¨
ty which is appropriate, search for anything
new or unusual. They are convinced that
Detail of the convent of Notre-Dame-de-
La-Tourette (1957- 1 959) built in France by
the Swiss-born French architect Le Cor-
busier (Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris,
1887-1965), whose work and ideas have
influenced Kenzo Tange. The structure
shows Le Corbusier's taste for plastic ef¬¨
fects and the freedom of his use of raw
concrete, on which the imprint of the
formwork can still be seen.
The first phase of the King Faisal Founda¬¨
tion Headquarters Complex at Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, was begun by Kenzo Tange
in 1976. The Foundation's offices are in
the two triangular towers in foreground.
The vast Complex also comprises a
mosque, a religious school and library,
and an apartment building. Simple
geometrical forms have been used
throughout.

Kenzo Tange blends the forms of modern
architecture with those of popular
Japanese tradition, one of the oldest ex¬¨
amples of which is the Shinto Inner
Shrine of Ise, the naiku (left), which pro¬¨
bably dates back to the 7th century. The
wooden buildings reproduce in highly
developed form the architecture of the
simple peasant houses of ancient Japan.

they must create something different in
order to express themselves within this
multiplicity of values. This is how I inter¬¨
pret the post-modernist experiments which
appeared in the 1970s as an antithesis to
modern architecture.
Modern architecture can, I think, be
defined by two periods. In the first, it
adapted itself to industrial society. In the se¬¨
cond, in which we are today, it must adapt
itself to the information society.
The first period of modern architecture
was that of the projects of Le Corbusier and
Walter Gropius, expressions of industrial
society, all of which bore the unique imprint
of these Masters of architecture. My own
work is an attempt to answer one question:
what should the architecture of the infor¬¨
mation society be?
I feel it is obvious that modern architec¬¨
ture has entered its second period.
Although I am not keen on the term post¬¨
modernism, it indicates the resources and
the new visual vocabulary which will
perhaps contribute to the creation of a new
language for the architectural age to come.
I do not think, however, that post-mod¬¨
ernism can become the expression of the in¬¨
formation society.
The objective of my research is to
discover the architectural and urban
language proper to this new society.
KENZO TANGE is an internationally known
Japanese architect and city planner. His best
known early work was the Peace Centre at
Hiroshima (1951-1956). Among his more re¬¨
cent buildings are the Akasaka Prince Hotel in
Tokyo and the King Faisal Foundation Head¬¨
quarters Complex at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (see
photos) In 1984, Kenzo Tange was elected to
the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut
de France. The article published here has been
extracted from the address he gave on his
reception into the Acad√©mie.

Hundreds of thousands of persons, mostly
belonging to hunting and fishing com¬¨
munities, are periodically made homeless
by heavy flooding of the Rio Parana. Many
are unable to return to their traditional way
of life on the banks of the river and are
sheltered "provisionally" in deplorable con¬¨
ditions. The project envisages "a solution
to this urgent problem, which will enable
flood victims to return to their localities and
work in a better organized, collective
fashion" based on a form of accommoda¬¨
tion which exploits the benefits of modern
technology yet also conserves the essential
features of the traditional structure. Built on
piles for protection against the floods, the
dwellings will be provided with modern
equipment such as biogas production and
storage facilities, windmills and charcoal
ovens. They will be constructed using local¬¨
ly available materials such as wood, straw,
osier rods and sand.

The aim of the project is to adapt the
grassroots rural community to present and
future changes in the construction of a
socialist society in the social, technical,
economic and cultural spheres... As a result
of these changes, "the differences bet¬¨
ween town and country will have been to a
large degree abolished. The countryman
will be a technician, a professional man or a
highly qualified worker. He will have full ac¬¨
cess to the entire cultural system and will
participate in social, political, cultural and
recreational activities." The project en¬¨
visages communities of from 2,000 to
5,000 persons, thus countering any trend
towards rampant urbanization. The
technology must be simple and adapted to
construction by the users themselves.
Locally available materials will be widely
employed. The urban structure will be
dynamic and capable of adapting to chang¬¨
ing needs. Facilities will include a biogas
plant, a wind-powered generator, a solar
energy unit, and a market garden to provide
for the needs of the community.

both a tool for exploiting the wealth of the
oceans and an autonomous city for 1 0,000
persons and their families created in accor¬¨
dance with the imperatives of the environ¬¨
ment. Aquapole's activities include
aquaculture, shell-fish cultivation, the ex¬¨
ploitation of metal nodules and hydro¬¨
carbons, the desalination of sea water,
petrochemistry, metallurgy and research.
The tubular structure consists of eight dou¬¨
ble pyramids, with activities on three levels:
at, above, and below sea level. In the upper
part of each of seven pyramids is a living
area for some 3,000 persons, divided into
"villages" with services, shopping and
leisure facilities. Solar energy panels are in¬¨
tegrated into the housing structures. There
is a three-tier transport system: elevators
and mobile platforms providing access to
the "villages" are linked to secondary axes
served by the main Aquapole transport net¬¨
work (aerotrains, heliports etc.). In order to
resist the salinity of the marine environ¬¨
ment, carbon fibres, optical fibres, syn¬¨

"Suburban Green Community" is based on
the exchange between rural and urban
communities, harmony with the natural en¬¨
vironment, and the harnessing of advanced
technology. The long main structure is a
combined housing, training institute and
agricultural factory block. Farmers' dwell¬¨
ings are located on each side^of a "com¬¨
munity corridor" on the ground floor of the
three-storey building. Other buildings
house mink, chicken and earthworm farms.
Circular ponds at left of main building are
for growing water hyacinth and green algae
(chlorella). Fields and orchards surround the
community buildings. Energy conservation
is carried out by the use of solar and wind
power energy, production of methane from
wastes and biomass. The river (right) and
reservoir (top right) provide recreational
space, habitat, for wild life, and protect
against flooding. City dwellers can par¬¨
ticipate in work of the experimental farm on

The "modular rural dwelling" project envi¬¨
sages the reorganization of Mexico's scat¬¨
tered rural settlements while preserving the
traditional character of life in the country¬¨
side. It proposes the creation of cells of
from sixteen to twenty dwelling units, each
housing one family. The cellular conception
is based on the typical Mexican neighbour¬¨
hood in which dwellings are disposed
around a central patio. The modular cells
are designed in the form of windmill sails,
with separate access for people and ani¬¨

cells to be constructed cheaply.

Adamu, a neighbourhood on the periphery
of the city of Jos. "It is officially designated
a slum mainly because it sprang up spon¬¨

Jos and identifies more with traditional
growth patterns than any predetermined
planning processes." The majority of the
people belong to the Hausa and Birom
ethnic groups, and the planning scheme
originates in the traditional Hausa concept
according to which the community has two
connected foci: in the past the market and
the palace, in this case the socio-economic
focus (community centre, etc.) and the
educational focus (vocational training cen¬¨

pedestrian mall. Housing (for a population
of 2,736 persons) consists of clusters of
adobe brick dwellings built around the cikin

### 63245: A City for the year 2,000
A city for the year 2000
by Oscar Niemeyer
Unlike Brasilia, created to be an urban
area in harmony and contact with nature.
S√§o Paulo has experienced rampant
growth and virtually all its green spaces
have disappeared. Photo shows S√§o
Paulo 's Co√°n building, designedby Oscar
Niemeyer.
CITIES have always changed under
the impact of progress, technologi¬¨
cal change, new forms of commu¬¨
nication, and human indifference.
In the past, city life was easy; it was more
natural, and there was a greater sense of
community. Then the little squares where
people got together, the markets which
brought animation to the narrow streets,
and the quiet tree-lined residential districts
all disappeared, with the spread of shops
and businesses created to satisfy everyday
needs.
The development of new means of pro¬¨
duction and transport, new urban activities,
and, above all, the industrial revolution,
transformed cities into dynamic metropoli¬¨
ses bustling with life but lacking the inti¬¨
macy which is so indispensable and which
was theirs in the past.
Cities have existed for thousands of
years... and perhaps the people of Nineveh
and Babyloncertainly those of Rome and
Alexandria faced some of the problems
which confront the modern city-dweller.
But metropolitan centres were then very
rare, and they may be considered a
twentieth-century phenomenon. In his
essay On the Populousness of the Ancient
Nations, the eighteenth-century philoso¬¨
pher David Hume (1711-1776) maintained
that no city would ever have more than
700,000 inhabitants. William Pelter was
convinced that the maximum population of
London would be five million. More realis¬¨
tically, Jules Verne (1828-1905) envisaged
cities with a population of up to ten million.
But the demographic growth of cities in the
modern world was to exceed all these
expectations.
Houses for five persons were replaced by
apartment blocks for two hundred; cars and
pedestrians packed the streets; the popula¬¨
tion density of urban areas skyrocketed;
traffic, noise and even security problems
began to preoccupy the city-dweller.
"Urban surgery" drove thoroughfares,
viaducts and level crossings through the city
fabric, and inevitably left scars, while man,
a forgotten and frustrated figure in the
anonymous crowds, was stifled by his own
lack of foresight.
Old tightly packed city districts were an
inviting target for demolition as magnates
constructed vast unsightly building com¬¨
plexes which disfigured the landscape with
their total indifference towards man and
nature.
As the implacably monotonous glass
cubes of rationalist architecture rose above
the streets, the old cities lost their former
unity.
Such is the explanation usually given for
the phenomenon of urban growth by those
who almost invariably forget the odious
social discrimination which it involves. New
possibilities have emerged only in those
countries where the institution of landed
property has been abolished. On the other

hand, the same errors continue to be made
in all Western cities: the rich have taken
them over, while the poor are relegated to
wretched quarters on the periphery.
From the "industrial city" project drawn
up in 1907 by the French architect and city
planner Tony Gamier to the Charter of
Athens of 1933 (see note page 5), countless
urban planning projects have been pro¬¨
posed but all, including the Charter itself,
are today strongly contested. Solutions
must be more coherent and more human;
the streets must be restored to pedestrians;
the urban fabric must again possess the
organic unity it has lost; and the creation of
large areas which are deserted outside
working hours must be avoided. Specialists
talk passionately about the problems of big
cities and issue a barrage of criticism: of
pollution, of the power of vested interests,
of intolerable crowding, of excessive
distances between work-place and home,
etc. But when it actually comes down to the
favelas (shanty-towns), and children
wandering through the streets, and the
workman who leaves home at dawn and on¬¨
ly gets back at night without ever seeing his
children, the discussion conveniently
evaporates, as if these were natural and ac¬¨
ceptable phenomena.
In such an appalling social context, the
city of the year 2000 cannot be built. As
envisaged today, this city would merely
reproduce, perhaps more aesthetically, the
discriminations and injustices of the capita¬¨
list world.
So what is to be done? How can we Latin
Americans, still oppressed by the old privi¬¨
leges created by the bourgeoisie, conceive of
a city which calls first and foremost for a
classless, just and interdependent society?
How can we imagine this ideal city if we
live beneath the yoke of dictatorships and
the chains of servitude, and when
privileges, landed property and

authoritarianism frustrate all our efforts.
How can we define the nature of the city of
the future if poverty besets us and injustice
forces us away from the drawing board to
respond to the promptings of our con¬¨
science and sense of solidarity, take part in
politics and cry out our indignation and
revolt?
But we can always dream a little and pre¬¨
sent our modest proposal for the city of the
future. At the outset let us say that it should
not, in our opinion, be backward-looking;
it should not turn towards those medieval
cities which attract us so much today, but at
the same time it should preserve something
The dilemma facing modern
architecturewhether to provide a ser¬¨
vice for all users or to pursue the mirage
of a better and better environment for a
smaller and smaller fraction of the
world's populationis evoked by Le Cor-
busier's drawing The Contemporary
Disaster or Freedom of Spatial

of their tranquillity and their human-dimen¬¨
sions, two essential qualities which have
fallen victim to human progress and incom¬¨
prehension. The city of the future will not
be conceived for the machine; it will be built
for man, who will be able to walk through
it from end to end, as he did in olden times.
Thus it will be a vertical city, one where
the distances will be reduced, thus fulfilling
its principal purpose. The population densi¬¨
ty will be fixed in advance, in order to avoid
the rampant growtl) which has disfigured
the world's great cities. To enable
pedestrians to move around freely, all
vehicles will be left in outlying car-parks
with direct access to the different sectors of
the city, including the centre, with its ad¬¨
ministrative buildings, offices and shops.
Sectors for health, culture, education and
housing will stretch, according to the logic
of urban organization, from the centre to
the limits. ' '
It will be a multipliable city. A series of
cities designed on this model will be stretch¬¨
ed along an axis, divided by immense green
spaces for recreation and leisure. Parallel to
these, areas will be allocated to agriculture,
scientific research and the major industries.
This is the formula we propose. Many
others are bound to be put forward, but we
believe that it is in this smaller, more in¬¨
timate, more human city, that man will one
day rediscover the lost sense of community
and the charm of city life, for which he has
always felt nostalgia.

leading exponents of modern architecture in

### 63246: The Metamorphosis of Cairo
The metamorphosis of Cairo
by Hassan Fathy
A seminar dealing with one of the most
pressing problems facing countries in the
developing world todaythe rapid growth
of cities was held in Cairo from 11 to 15
November 1984. The five-day seminar, en¬¨
titled The Expanding Metropolis: Coping
with the Urban Growth of Cairo, was the
ninth international seminar sponsored by
the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The
Award was established in 1976 "to en¬¨
courage an awareness of the strength and
diversity of Islamic culture which, when
combined with an enlightened use of
modern technology, will result in buildings
more appropriate for the Islamic world of
tomorrow". The article below is based on
the keynote address to the seminar by the
Egyptian architect Dr. Hassan Fathy,
himself a laureate of the Award in 1980.
The full proceedings of the seminar are to
be published later this year as part of the
Award series Architectural Transformation
in the Islamic World.

THE Cairo of the future is an intrigu¬¨
ing and enlightening subject of
research. Suffering as it does today
from most of the urban disorders typical of
many other Arab cities, Cairo constitutes
an ideal target for a case study.
At present Cairo is facing enormous
problems in almost all areas of urban con¬¨
cern: congestion, shortage of housing, in¬¨
adequate transport, entire lack of an ade¬¨
quate centre, lack of well-located public ser¬¨
vice buildings, and so on. Above all it is suf¬¨
fering from the problem of alienation and
loss of identity in town planning and ar¬¨
chitecture caused by borrowing models
from the West which do not fit, thus inter¬¨
rupting the natural urban development
stemming from the environment.
Existing over-population, which is ex¬¨
pected to intensify in the near future, re¬¨
quires the fashioning of a new Cairo that is
an outgrowth of the present city with the
addition of an area almost equal to its pre¬¨
sent size. This at once raises several essential
questions. To start with, where will this
Cairo be located geographically? What
town-planning system should be adopted?
What style of architecture should it have?
The site of the historical city has changed
several times. At the beginning of the
Islamic period, Fustat, the seed from which
contemporary Cairo grew, was founded by
Amr ibn al-'As, who built his palace and
mosque there in 643.
Some two centuries later, Ahmad ibn
Tulun found the palace much too small for
the proper functioning of the administra¬¨
tion and his large number of followers. So
in 872 he built himself a large palace in a
new quarter, at the foot of the hill on which
the Citadel was later built, and distributed
all the land surrounding it among his of¬¨
ficers and courtiers. This new quarter was
called al-Qatai, which means distributed
plots, and it extended from the palace to the
river. In 875 ibn Tulun built the famous
mosque that bears his name.
Finally, in 971, after the successful inva¬¨
sion of Egypt by the Fatimids, the vic¬¨
torious commander, General Jawhar,
founded a walled city further to the north
for the Fatimid Caliph al-Muizz. When the
Caliph arrived to make it the capital of his
dynasty, the city was given the name it has
retained t√∂ this day, al-Qahirah ("the Vic¬¨
torious"), or Cairo.
The city covered an area of some 1 50 hec¬¨
tares, but within a short space of time, dur¬¨
ing the reign of Caliph al-Hakim, the
population had increased to 100,000 and
the city was extended to the north and the
south.
Medieval Cairo attained its apogee dur¬¨
ing the Mamluk era. By the mid-fourteenth
century it had a population of some 500,000
and was the greatest city in all Africa,
Europe and the Levant and the centre of
Islamic learning.
Modern urban growth began during the
nineteenth century. Gradually, as the river
was brought under control and the riverside
marshes were drained, the city spread
towards the west until today it completely
occupies the area between the Citadel and
the river, with modern quarters in Euro¬¨
pean style attracting the centre of the city
from Muski to al-Khadra to Qasr an-Nil.
Bridges were built and urbanization spread
to the western bank of the river and the
quarters of Zamalek, al-Awqaf and
Madinat al-Muhandisin (City of Engineers)
and others were constructed, extending the
built-up area to the western desert thus en¬¨
croaching on the green area which used to
provide Cairo with vegetables.
As the population grew, the quarters
began to extend to the north and the south
and the city assumed a very elongated
shape. In addition, the centre moved
westwards at right angles to the main line of
growth so that the form of the city ceased to
represent the optimum configuration for
the efficient functioning of the city, causing
chaos and congestion.
Housing did not spread eastwards
because of the Muqattam Hills and the
military barracks, so the area adjacent to
the city on its eastern border and extending
to the Suez Canal remained unoccupied and
could provide a site for the Cairo of the
future. The best solution would be to site
the Cairo of the future to the east with its
linear centre extending lengthwise between
the old and the new Cairos.
Nasr City, a new town begun in 1958 and
situated to the east, gives an indication of
the feasibility of the idea. The Saleh Salem
road, which leads out to the airport, could
have formed the linear centre if it had been
designed sufficiently wide to allow for
public service buildings, "commercial
buildings, fast and slow communications
roads, car parks and so on. Unfortunately
it was designed as an ordinary street. When
Nasr City was built, chaotic building occur¬¨
red to the east of the street in the area which
is supposed to contain the Cairo of the
future and its linear centre.
Furthermore, Nasr City was not designed
as an integral part of the future Cairo. The
situation urgently demands the drawing up
of plans for the future Cairo in this
geographical area, the definition of its ar¬¨
chitectural style and a decision to stop the
construction of any building which does not
meet the requirements of the site or its ar¬¨
chitectural pattern.
The planning of the future Cairo should
be based on a system of quarters graduated
in size in an organized manner and
ecologically balanced so that every quarter,
from the smallest to the largest, is provided

with the services appropriate to the number
of inhabitants. We could adopt the concept
of a city of graduated communities. Com¬¨
munity Class One would be a street for
about a hundred people; Community Class
Two would be for five hundred people and
would require a grocery store and a
children's play area. Community Class
Three, for one thousand people, would
need an elementary school. Community
Class Four, with between five and ten thou¬¨
sand people would be a village requiring a
secondary school, a market and public ser¬¨
vice buildings such as banks and post and
telegraph offices, etc.
Based on a density of one hundred people
to 4,000 square metres, a Community Class
Four would require a square plot measuring
some 360,000 square metres. An area of this
size would enable the majority of the
inhabitantssecondary and primary
schoolchildren, housewives, people going
to sports meetings and social gatherings
to walk from their homes to their destina¬¨
tions, thus reducing automobile traffic
within the quarter by no less than eighty per
cent.
Community Class Four is followed by
Community Class Five, for 50,000 people,
and Class Six, for one million and more
from Metropolis to Megalopolis.
Modern urban planning attempts to
separate heavy automobile traffic and
pedestrians. This problem can be solved by
having a ring road for cars around the
residential quarter with cul-de-sac streets
penetrating the housing area, serving just
the inhabitants of the street, with a park in
the centre surrounded by the houses.
To respect the human scale in the Cairo
of the future we can use the Community
Class Four as the basic unit. To ensure that
man doesnot lose his sense of belonging to

Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, founder of the

Mamluk mosque of Nasr Mohammed.
his quarter the streets have to meander, with
closed vistas no longer than fifty metres, as
in traditional Arab cities. In this way the
streets, like the traditional Arab courtyard,
will act as temperature regulators, and the
architecture of the houses will be variegated
to allow the owner individual expression
while at the same time respecting the
aesthetic factor. This variegation will give
the closed vista area the rhythm of a move¬¨
ment in a sonata.
Architecture is said to be one of the most
important elements of culture. Culture can
be defined as the resultant of the interaction
between the intelligence of man and his en¬¨
vironment in satisfying his needs, both
spiritual and material. The artistic value of
any project depends on the answer to the
question: "Is it for man, the psycho-
biological man, or is it for some other pur¬¨
pose." If it is for man, then it can be
discussed. If it is for any other purpose,
political or economic, for example, then
decisions can be taken without discussion.
With regard to the Cairo of the future, we
have to define the man for whom we are
planning and designing it and what his
spiritual and physical needs in housing are
so far as architectural design and town plan¬¨
ning are concerned. This requires special
research. Concerning culture and Arab
civilization, we need to cope with the
problem of alienation which dominates the
Arab countries in the field of urbanization.
In modern Arab cities, the Arab has
adopted an alien style in planning and ar¬¨
chitecture which could never have
developed if he were reacting personally to
his natural environment and respecting his
cultural heritage. This problem of aliena¬¨
tion was imposed upon us in the past from
outside by foreign rulers and by the impact
of the historical, cultural and economic
changes resulting from the industrial
revolution in Europe.
There is one most striking example of
alienation in architectural design and plan¬¨
ning in the modern Arab city. This is the
replacement of introversion in the design of
the Arab house, in which the living-rooms
open on to the courtyard with its marble
fountain, trees and aromatic flowers acting
as a temperature regulator and protecting
the intimacy that characterizes Arab family
life, by extroversion, in which the living-
rooms open on to the street with its black
asphalt, exhaust fumes and noise.
The Cairo of the future can become a
triumph of man's artistry, ranking with the
world's finest examples of townscapes. If
the characteristics of the contemporary city
and the Arab identity can be combined in
the Cairo of the future, it could become a
model for Arab and Islamic countries.
HASSAN FATHY, Egyptian architect and
town-planner, has devoted his life to the
development of low-cost housing techniques
suited to the needs of the Third World. In 1946
he began work on the New Village of Gourna,
near Luxor, Egypt, where his graceful, earth-
built housing units, inspired by local traditional
styles, broke new ground. His views on ar¬¨
chitecture, on low-cost housing and co¬¨
operative building are contained in his book
Gourna, a Tale of Two Villages.

### 63247: UNESCO and the conservation of Old Cairo
Unesco and the conservation of Old Cairo
THE inclusion of the old city of Cairo
in the World Heritage List by the
World Heritage Convention, in
1 979, underlined the international cultural
significance of historic Cairo. But with
over six hundred listed buildings in an ex¬¨
panding city whose population is ex¬¨
pected to rise from twelve million to bet¬¨
ween sixteen and twenty million by the
year 2000 the problems of preservation
are enormous.
In February 1980, in response to a re¬¨
quest from the Egyptian Government,
Unesco undertook to send a mission to
prepare a report on a conservation
strategy for the old city of Cairo. The
members of this mission made a number
of visits during the period February to
August 1980.
The team concentrated its attention on
a study area of some three and a half
square kilometres (see map) containing
450 listed buildings. They found that the
resources available for the maintenance
of these historic monuments were totally
inadequate to the magnitude of the
problem. The area's narrow medieval
streets are choked with traffic, new and
unsuitable industrial and business ac¬¨
tivities are driving out the traditional
craftsmen and small tradesmen, and
building fabric is deteriorating due to
general decay, inadequate maintenance
and the ravages of a rising groundwater
table.
The team's report proposed two levels
of priority action for the study area. The
first of these covers the study area as a
whole and suggests a general programme
of housing improvement, limitation of the
size, speed and number of vehicles allow¬¨
ed into the area and improvement of road
maintenance, street cleaning and rubbish
collection.
At the second level of action the report
proposes a five-year emergency pro¬¨
gramme for six priority zones containing
clusters of monuments. Within each zone
urgent action is required to deal with the
restoration of monuments, to control the
design and construction of new buildings,
to rehabilitate and improve existing sites
and buildings, to introduce new compati-

ble functions for monuments and to im¬¨
prove and contribute to the social facilities
of the neighbourhood.
The six clusters of monuments have
been selected to form potential conserva¬¨
tion and rehabilitation zones and are
spaced out at almost equal distances bet¬¨
ween the northern gates and the Ibn Tulun
Mosque (see diagram), each focussing on
a single street about 250 metres long.
Each group is thus tightly integrated, yet
they are spaced out in such a way that
their upgrading will have the maximum
impact on the whole of the central area of
the old city.
The six priority zones or clusters and
their general characteristics are as
follows:
Zone One, centred on Sharia (street) al
Muizz li-Din Allah, covers the heart of
Fatimid Cairo and is the site of the former
Fatimid palaces which were replaced by
other major buildings during the Ayyubid
and Mamluk periods. Historically the zone
demonstrates the development of the
typical Cairene madrasa-mosque with at¬¨
tached mausoleum of the founder. Major
public buildings and commercial struc¬¨
tures prevail, with shopfronts often
obstructing the view of important
monuments. Due to the vicinity of Khan al
Khalili and the Sharia al-Azhar, this zone
is the most frequented tourist area and,
with its unique architectural heritage,
represents a showcase of Islamic Cairo.
Zone Two, centred on Sharia al-
Gamaliya, represents one of the finest
and most homogeneous street scenes of
the old city. It includes fine wakallas
(buildings facing on to courtyards and
consisting of shops on the ground floor
with living quarters above) and sabil-
kuttabs (buildings with a single ground
floor room in which is installed a public
fountain, with a balcony room above
where young children are taught to chant
the Koran) on the north-south spine of
Fatimid Cairo, leading from Bab (gate) al-

Nasr to the shrine of Hussein. The street
is also a sub-centre for the adjacent hous¬¨
ing districts which are accessible through
the many lanes branching off from the
spine.
Zone Three, centred on the Ghouriya,
contains the buildings of the Mamluk
Sultan al-Ghoury and a series of tradi¬¨
tional suqs (markets). These originally ex¬¨
tended from the Sharia Muski southwards
as far as the Mu'ayyad complex (Zone
Four) and were cut by the Sharia al-Azhar.
To the east, close to the Sharia Hammam
al-Masbaja is a vegetable market which
acts as a local focus for the surrounding
area. Further east, the al-Azhar Mosque,
which is adjacent to this zone, is both a
major tourist attraction and an important
religious centre.
Zone Four is centred on Bab Zuweila,
the southern gate of the Fatimid city, link¬¨
ing the walled city with its southern exten¬¨
sions. Immediately south of the gate, the
spine features a unique sequence in the
old city, from the small open space out¬¨
side the gate to the covered Street of the
Tent-Makers. Due to industrial activities
nearby this zone suffers from the impact
of heavy vehicular traffic and contains
many dilapidated and abandoned plots.
Yet it remains a vital centre of life for the
southern part of the Fatimid city.
. Zone Five stretches along the Sharia Ba
al-Wazir, a section of the street running
from Bab Zuweila to the citadel which is
itself a ramification of the main north-
south spine of Islamic Cairo. This street
has kept much more of its traditional
character and activities than the main
spine south of Bab Zuweila. With several
Mamluk mosques and mausoleums pro¬¨
jecting diagonally into the street space
and with some fine specimens of tradi¬¨
tional housing structures surviving, the
area offers an important potential for

number of modern housing blocks and a
large irregular open space behind the
Blue Mosque which is used as a youth
centre. Traffic is less of a problem than in
the other zones, although large buses
operating on this spine often cause
congestion.
Zone Six contains a fine sequence of
Mamluk and Ottoman monuments on the
road leading from the Ibn Tulun Mosque
to the Citadel. The zone is crossed by the
main north-south spine leading from Bab
Zuweila to the cemetery of Saida Nafisa
and offers possibilities of future exten¬¨
sion. More than any other zone it has suf¬¨
fered from the impact of change and
redevelopment, due to the fact that Saliba
Road is today a major traffic artery.

The world's

-ry^ >^^
The problems and the future of the great
metropolitan areas of the world were
discussed by 800 participants at an interna¬¨
tional symposium, Metropolis 84, organiz¬¨
ed by the Regional Council of the Ile-de-
France and held in Paris from 10 to 12 Oc¬¨
tober 1984. The report on the proceedings
of the symposium, on which this article is
based, has been published in Les Cahiers de
lal.A. U.R.I.F. (Institut d'Am√©nagement et
d'Urbanisme de la R√©gion d'Ile de France),
Paris (N¬∞ 74). It covers the four main
themes of the symposium: demography and
town planning, economic and technological
change, transport, and culture and
environment.

IROM 1900 to 1975, the number of
cities with a million inhabitants in¬¨
creased tenfold and that of cities
with over five million inhabitants
multiplied by twenty. During the same
period, the total population of the twenty-
five largest cities more than quadrupled and
will be multiplied eight to ten times by the
year 2000. Their average size will pass from
two to sixteen million inhabitants and they
will include about six per cent of the world's
population and twelve per cent of its urban
population. In the year 2000 more than half
of the twenty-five cities with more than ten
million inhabitants and nearly half the cities
with over four million inhabitants will be
located in Asia.
The universalization of urbanism is a new
fact. Before the year 2000, for the first time
in the history of humanity, the world will
have more town dwellers than country
dwellers. If conurbations with over one
million inhabitants are included,
metropolitan areas will assemble sixty per
cent of the urban population, or over 1,500
million individuals.
This change will be accompanied by a
swing in the relative importance of
metropolitan areas. Those' in the in¬¨
dustrialized countries are stagnating and
regressing (London, for example, has lost
two million people in forty years) and those
in the Third World are rapidly expanding.
In 1975 there were 262 million people in the
metropolitan areas of the developed coun-
1-
By the year 2000, for the first time in
history, more people will be living in
towns and cities than in rural areas. Most
urban dwellers (over 1.5 thousand million
persons) will be living in conurbations of
overone million inhabitants. Demographic
pressure on cities bursting at their seams
is illustrated in this photo of a Tokyo
crowd. In 1980 the 28.7 million in¬¨
habitants of the Tokyo Metropolitan
Region represented one quarter of
Japan's entire population.

tries as against 244 million in those of the
Third World. In the year 2000 Third World
metropolitan areas will have 914 million
people, more than double the 444 million
forecast for the industrialized countries.
This demographic and urban evolution is
taking place in the context of an economic
crisis and the imbalance in population
distribution will be accompanied by an in¬¨
creasing gap in the distribution of wealth.
All this will occur in a world brought closer
together by improved transport facilities,
the multiplication of commercial exchanges
and the increasing openness of boundaries
and cultures to the spread of information.
The increase in the mobility of mankind
is inescapable from one country to
another, from one continent to another,
under the attraction of the real or imagined
opportunities offered by metropolitan areas
beyond the barriers of the frontiers of to¬¨
day. California's powerful magnetic appeal
to the people of Latin America is perhaps
premonitory.
In the metropolitan areas of developed
countries with low growth or falling
populations, the problem today is one of
reviving activity, preserving and
highlighting the cultural heritage, pre¬¨
venting the depreciation of certain districts
before they are transformed into ghettos,
and making the best possible use of existing
infrastructures.
The metropolitan areas of the developing
countries, on the other hand, are seeking to
control their demographic growth, to
organize urban extensions, to make good
their lack of facilities and services and to
make productive use of the available labour
force.
Those responsible for the metropolitan
areas in developing countries are faced with
problems of alarmingly rapid growth. The
urban conurbations in these countries have
average growth rates of between five per
cent and seven per cent per annum which
means that they double every fifteen years.
Each year additions to their populations
can be counted in hundreds of thousands
(350,000 in Cairo, 300,000 in Bangkok,
750,000 in Mexico City) and the areas of
agricultural land lost in thousands of hec-
Long a problem in countries that first
used the automobile on a large scale, ur¬¨
ban traffic congestion is now a growing
cause for concern in many Third World
cities as well. Monumental traffic jams
occur regularly in such cities as Lagos,
Bangkokand S√§o Paulo (right). Handicap¬¨
ped by insufficient infrastructures to
meet current needs, cities in the develop¬¨
ing world are today facing massive and
ever-mounting demands for public
transport by low-income users.

tares, often in the richest agricultural areas
in the country.
The evidence is that this rapid growth is
going to continue for several years. The
rural population today is still very con¬¨
siderable. Its birth rate is greater than that
in the cities and generates demographic
growth far superior to that which
agriculture can absorb (1.5 per cent per an¬¨
num according to the experts). While, for
cultural reasons, the birth rate is lower in
the cities, the mortality rate there is lower
still. As a result the normal growth of the
urban population is more rapid than that of
the rural population, as witness the ex¬¨
amples of Mexico, India and China.
Faced with this problem a number of
countries and metropolitan areas are doing
their best to control metropolitan growth in
a variety of ways: demographic policies and
national encouragement to decrease the
birth rate China provides the most strik¬¨
ing example, promotion of agricultural ac¬¨
tivities and development of related activities
in small rural towns, development of
medium-sized towns, etc. Nevertheless, it is
generally agreed that metropolitan growth
will remain, for several decades, at a level
close to that being experienced today.
Those responsible for metropolitan areas in
the Third World will therefore have to make
provision for the reception of these huge in¬¨
flows of new inhabitants.
A variety of often complementary solu¬¨
tions have been adopted: the creation of
development zones, new districts, new
towns; the extension of infrastructural net¬¨
works, prefabricated or do-it-yourself
housing, etc. However, the speed at which
such operations can be undertaken does not
match the rapidity of population growth. In
addition there is the problem of the poverty
of the newcomers which is intensified by the
current crisis. It is everywhere evident that
economic development and therefore
employment are not progressing fast
enough to meet their needs. The difficulties
of employment and poverty in the metropo¬¨
litan areas of the Third World are reflected
in the anxiety of the worker whose budget is
whittled away by accommodation costs and
the anguish of those who know that their
accommodation is only temporary.
Employment is the number one
challenge. Yet at the same time it offers a
way towards a solution to all the problems
described above, whether in the
metropolitan areas or elsewhere.
In addition there is the high cost of ur¬¨
banization in the large conurbations. In
developing countries, national resources are
limited. It is not easy to define an urban
policy that allows satisfactory development
of metropolitan areas without signing away
the economic and social development of the
country as a whole.
Throughout this century, the metropo¬¨
litan areas of the developed countries have
witnessed periods of rapid growth which
those in charge have usually tried to halt by
various methods. The situation today is
very different and although some conurba¬¨
tions (such as Los Angeles, Moscow and
Madrid) are still expanding, others appear
to have stable (Ile-de-France; the ,

Hilversum, and Utrecht) or decreasing
(London, New York, Brussels) population
figures. The desired limitation has been
achieved, yet there remains a certain
dissatisfaction.
This stems from the fact that, even when
the populations of the conurbations are no
longer increasing or are even decreasing, the
space occupied continues to grow up to the
very limit of what is acceptable in the
economic context of today, particularly
with respect to networks and facilities.
At the same time, due to the effect of the
economic crisis, qualitative problems are
multiplying: socio-professional changes
connected with developments taking place
in industry, increasing impoverishment of
large sectors of the metropolitan popula¬¨
tion and the development of social
problems, delinquency, drug addiction, and
criminality. The increase in the number of
the impoverished is a sign of the poor health
of society as a whole. In the towns these
vulnerable population groups are concen¬¨
trated in particular areas, emphasizing the
social stratification.
Experience acquired over the last fifty
years, however, has made possible the
elaboration of a generally accepted "urban
technique" which is being put into practice
in most countries in various forms. Its main
elements are:
Polycentrism. It has become clear that
the organization of an urban area must be
based on a hierarchical system of centres
each dispensing services to the inhabitants.
The Ile-de-France, Los Angeles, Randstad
and London provide good examples of this;
The notion of discontinuity. Green belts
can halt the blanket urbanization that is
now everywhere rejected. Varied examples
are provided by Montreal, Los Angeles,
Moscow, Brussels, Copenhagen, the Ile-de-
France and Randstad;
Urban renewal. This appears to be an
essential factor in improved integration of
inhabitants;
The optimization of town planning
operations. The scale of these operations
has been considerably reduced, allowing
forms of intervention to become more sub¬¨
tle and therefore better adapted, more
human and better integrated into the urban
framework;
Energy conservation. After the crisis of
the 1970s concern for energy conservation
modified town planning perspectives. Too
much dispersion is costly in energy. Linear
development, overspill areas and the group¬¨
ing of services have become the guiding
themes of present-day town planning.
Experience has exposed the great com¬¨
plexity of metropolitan phenomena. The
After experiencing periods of rapid
growth earlier this century many conur¬¨
bations In the Industrialized countries to¬¨
day appear to have stable or falling
population figures. London, right, Is one
major city which Is experiencing
demographic decline. Greater London
has lost some two million people In 40
years (8.6 million In 1939, 6.7 million In
1981). Forecasts Indicate that this
depopulation will continue but at a more
moderate rate.
large metropolis is neither a static organism
nor an isolated fortress. It is involved in
multiple exchanges with the surrounding
regions. Even when it is experiencing a net
loss of inhabitants it continues to receive
newcomers in their tens, hundreds or
thousands. Intensive and permanent ex¬¨
changes take place in its midst: while
population is diminishing in some parts of
a conurbationoften the city centrein
other parts it is increasing. This is why ur¬¨
ban extension and the replanning of city
centres are often problems which must be
tackled simultaneously.
Are common solutions appropriate given
the diversity of the situations? The
demographic, social, economic and cultural
differences between the continents are ob¬¨
vious. Moreover, each concrete situation is
the product of a particular geographical
and historical setting and therefore unique.
Everywhere the metropolitan area is
emerging as the most suitable level for
reflection and action. Even though the
outlines of the metropolitan area remain
unclear and changing, and it has to work in
collaboration with local, regional, federal
and national communities, the urban region
must clearly be considered as a whole.
The technical, cultural and financial
feasibility of different urban policies is a
key factor. Experience throughout the
world shows that what makes the difference
between success and failure is not the town
planning or aesthetic aspects of the pro¬¨
jects, that is to say their intrinsic qualities,
but their appropriateness to the local
technical, administrative and financial con¬¨
text. Immense progress remains to be made
in this area and is all the more necessary in
view of the economic crisis and the weak
financial situation of the Third World ur¬¨
ban populations.
This is why the participation of citizens in
town planning choices is being widely ad¬¨
vocated. The fast pace of growth, the
cultural diversity, the size of the popula¬¨
tions in question, the complexity of the pro¬¨
cedures, are all obstacles to be overcome in
order to ensure a genuine citizen
participation and the best chance of suc¬¨
cess for future projects.

### 63250: The Outlook for urban man
The outlook for urban man
MAN is increasingly becoming an
urban species. Whereas in 1960
about a third of the world's
population lived in towns and cities, by the
turn of the century it is expected that
around half will do so. Cities are also in¬¨
creasing in size. In 1950 there were only
six urban agglomerations with more than
5 million inhabitants; today there are 26,
and by the end of the century there could
be as many as 60all but 12 of them in
developing countries. It is in the cities that
the problems of population growth are
magnified to frightening proportions: the
urban population of the Third World is ex¬¨
panding at a rate of 3.6 per cent a year,
almost twice as fast as the population in
general, and some cities are growing
three or four times as fast, a few at over 1 0
per cent a year.
For Third World countries, the implica¬¨
tions are enormous in terms of providing
adequate common services and ensuring
food and employment for at least double
the number of people currently residing in
urban areas. Many cities are already
familiar with the problem (although few
would claim to be coping adequately):
S√§o Paulo, for instance, is already adding
half a million inhabitants every year. An
extreme example of the scale of the pro¬¨
blem is the estimate that to bring in the ex¬¨
tra water needed for Mexico City by the
year 2000 will require electricity consump¬¨
tion equal to the total present-day elec¬¨
tricity consumption of the city's buildings.
Problems are compounded by the fact
that between one-third and two-thirds of
most Third World city dwellers live in
squatter settlements with inadequate
water supply and other amenities.
Often, programmes intended to im¬¨
prove conditions in different urban sectors
are planned and carried out independent¬¨
ly, sometimes cancelling out each other's
benefits. For instance, efforts to expand
industry and create employment may
reduce water or energy for domestic
purposes.
Those concerned with modern city
planning thus have to grapple with
problems of considerable complexity. Ur¬¨
banization needs increasingly to be seen
in the context of overall development
plans and investment strategies, as
Recommendation 39 for the further im¬¨
plementation of the World Population
Plan of Action adopted in Bucharest in
1974 suggests, "with the aim of achiev¬¨
ing... a reduction in current high migration
to capital cities and other large urban cen¬¨
tres, the development of medium-sized
towns and a reduction of rural-urban and
regional inequalities".
A better understanding of the urbaniza¬¨
tion process is one of the aims of
Unesco's programme in this field. At a re¬¨
cent meeting of experts, a common pro¬¨
gramme was agreed for identifying
sources of vulnerability within urban
systems as they evolve, and various
means outlined of increasing the
resilience of systems and their adaptabili¬¨
ty to change.
Many Unesco studies on migration
have a bearing on urbanization and help
to throw light on the motivations for move¬¨
ment from the countryside and to the city,
the choice of migrant destination, and on
adjustment and failure to adjust to the
host society.
Bearing in mind one of the key recom¬¨
mendations of the Plan of Actionthat
population distribution policies should be
integrated with economic and social
policies Unesco has increasingly linked
its migration research to the broader
perspectives of national development. Its
main aim is to investigate the variations in
migratory patterns and their causes, as
well as the consequences for the areas of
origin and destination. It studies the in¬¨
teractions between rural and urban en¬¨
vironments and their implications for
population growth and change in different
areas. Migration has complex conse¬¨
quences for the lives and welfare of the
migrants and their families, as well as for
their home and host communities. Recent
Unesco country studies cover a wide
range in time and space: migration into
Mexico City from 1930-1970, three cen¬¨
turies of internal migration in France, in¬¨
ternal migration in India, and the growth of
medium-sized towns in Nigeria.
Unesco research on the dynamics of
migration has highlighted the complex¬¨
ities of both "push" and "pull" factors in
the movement of workers and their
families. The density of settlement on the
land, carrying capacity stress, the degree
of commercialization, the forms of land
tenure and labour use, the farming
technology in use, the reform of land
tenure arrangements, and the degree of
provision of social and economic services
to the countrysideall impinge directly on
the process of rural out-migration. These
factors may assume even more impor¬¨
tance in the future as population growth in
marginal farming areas contributes, in a
vicious circle, to further environmental
degradation.
The central idea emerging from
Unesco's work in this field is that migra¬¨
tion policies should be formulated within
the context of general development plans,
and that these policies and plans should
aim to remove rural-urban inequalities,
create more small towns to act as a
counter-attraction to the cities and a focus
of rural development, and to introduce
strong welfare components and the provi¬¨
sion of basic services into rural develop¬¨
ment programmes.
In many countries, internal migration is
a crucial element in achieving and main¬¨
taining a balance in the various productive
sectors of the economy, and as such is a
major element in the development pro¬¨
cess. If allowed to occur in a policy
vacuum, however, migration can have
severe consequences and impose a strain
on the provision of basic services.
Governments should recognize this and
make appropriate plans and policies.
Unesco studies indicate that well thought-
out Incentive structures and policy in¬¨
terventions at the source region have a
higher probability of success than either
migration controls or policy actions at the
destination region alone. Migration con¬¨
trols, as Recommendation 38 for the fur¬¨
ther implementation of the World Popula¬¨
tion Plan of Action notes, "are difficult to
enforce and may infringe on human
rights".
Unesco research has also drawn atten¬¨
tion to the fact that most Third World plan¬¨
ning has failed to take account of the com¬¨
plexity of the relationship between "pull"
towns and cities and the surrounding rural
areas. As they grow, towns come to de¬¨
pend on ever more distant regions for
their supplies of water, energy, food and
building materials, and the extra demand
created often leads to the degradation of
both neighbouring and more distant land
through overexploitation. Another area for
intervention is the almost total lack of
knowledge and understanding of the
causes and consequences of migration
on the part of the public and of local and
regional leaders both in rural and urban
areas. This area of migration information
and communication is one which Unesco
is paying increasing attention to.
Although rural-rural migration Is more
widespread and more Important than was
thought only a few years agofor in¬¨
stance in India it is now known that around
70 per cent of all migratory movements
are of this typeit is the widespread drift
to the towns and cities of the Third World
which creates most concern among
governments.
Unesco has also drawn attention to the
need for population involvement in im¬¨
proving urban settlements, since the solu¬¨
tions to many development problems can
often be found within the society, and
much work can be carried out by the peo¬¨
ple themselves with little external support.
One way of achieving this goal is through
the use of "barefoot architects", who,
after simplified training, would be able to
solve many of the major problems of shan¬¨
ty towns or villages. He or she would be
able to deal with the basic problems of
roadways, water supply, drainage, house
construction and the building of communi¬¨
ty buildings such as schools. Such a per¬¨
son, drawn from the community itself,
would be able to mobilize community sup¬¨
port and guide local people in the use of
simple technologies to enhance the use of
locally available resources.

### 63256: A Back-to-the-earth approach to housing
A back-to-the-earth approach
to housing by Jean Dethier
Arealistic picture of the new trends in
architecture and housing tech¬¨
niques that are destined to prevail
at the end of this century would be in¬¨
complete without reference to a domain in
which rapid and important developments
are already taking place building which
uses unbaked earth as its prime material.
Earth building as an architectural tech¬¨
nique, which in its up-dated form has an im¬¨
portant role to play in meeting the needs
and challenges of our time, has a very long
history. Since towns were first created,
some ten thousand years ago, men have
used this material to build entire cities
palaces and temples, churches and
mosques, warehouses and forts, defensive
walls and proud monuments.
Readily available over most of the globe,
this seemingly humble material has been us¬¨
ed in every continent and climate, in all
latitudes and in nearly every pre-industrial
culture and civilization, in long stretches of
the Great Wall of China, built over twenty
centuries ago, as well as in both the simplest
and the most imposing dwellings. It has
proved its versatility and the extraordinary
variety of forms and functions to which it
can be applied. Its solidity and strength,
when it is correctly used, have been abun¬¨
dantly demonstrated.
Over recent years Unesco has helped to
promote recognition of this part of the
universal heritage by proposing the
classification of towns with fine examples
of buildings in unbaked earth such as Ouro
Pr√™to, in Brazil, Shibam, in the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen, and
Sanaa, in the Yemen Arab Republic.
Since the beginnings of modern science
attempts have been made to rationalize and
improve the empirical earth-building
techniques used in pre-industrial societies
all over the world.
The pioneer in the use of these techniques
in modern times was the French architect
Fran√ßois Cointeraux (1740-1830). As early
as 1797 he invented several processes for
stabilizing earth to increase its mechanical
and chemical resistance and its adaptability
to the new creative trends in architecture
which had been launched by such visionary
architects as Claude Nicolas Ledoux
(1736-1806) and Etienne Louis Boul√©e
(1728-1799).
Cointeraux was not only a theoretician,
he was also a practitioner and an enlighten¬¨
ed teacher and published many works which
were widely read not only in Europe but
also in the Americas and Australia. For the
best part of a century his designs were used
in the construction of factories, schools and
Unbaked earth dwellings at Shibam in the
Wadi Hadramaout valley, People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen. Built
around the 4th century AD, the town is
one of the most remarkable examples of
Yemeni art and architecture. Its construc¬¨
tions of unbaked earth date from between
the 16th and the 20th century. In
December 1984 the Director-General of
Unesco launched two appeals for interna¬¨
tional solidarity, one for the safeguard of
Shibam (which has been on Unesco's
World Heritage List since 1982) and Wadi
Hadramaout, and the second on behalf of
Sanaa, the historic city which is capital of
the Yemen Arab Republic.
public buildings as well as of dwellings of all
kinds, ranging from stately homes and
middle-class residences to housing estates
for workers and five-storey city apartment
blocks.
Cointeraux can thus be considered to
have invented modern earth architecture
two centuries ago. In the Grenoble and
Lyons areas of France, where Cointeraux
lived, several specimens of his creative
talent survive in perfect condition, adding
their contribution to the age-old traditional
urban and rural architectural heritage of
buildings made of earth. So this region is a
kind of vast open-air museum of the oldest

### 63256: A Back-to-the-earth approach to housing
This vast modern building of unbaked
earth was built near Luxor, Egypt, in 1980
by the French architect Olivier Sednaoul.
and the most modern earth-building
techniques.
But in France, as elsewhere, the irresisti¬¨
ble commercial progress of industrial
materials such as cement, concrete, baked
bricks and steel has led to a gradual decline
in the use of earth during the present cen¬¨
tury. It was only when violent crises inter¬¨
rupted the production of these materials
that architects and builders again had
recourse to unbaked earth. This happened
in Europe during and after both world
wars. Tens of thousands of earth dwellings
were built, especially in Germany, during
the 1920s and again in the 1940s. Also dur¬¨
ing the 1940s some of the great stars of
modern architectureFrank Lloyd Wright
(1867-1959) in the United States and Le
Corbusier (1887-1965) in Francedesigned
a number of projects in unbaked earth.
During the same period this new architec¬¨
tural approach had its first repercussions
outside the industrialized countries. A very
rational and impressive regional hospital
was erected in 1943 at Adrar, Algeria, by
the Belgian architect Michel Luyckx. In
Egypt, Hassan Fathy was to set out on a
long cultural Odyssey lasting forty years
which would lead him to rediscover the age-
old earth building traditions of his country
and to rehabilitate and modernize them.
His approach, at one and the same time
theoretical and practical, philosophical and
militant, was to make him the first guru of
a democratic form of architecture that was
specifically adapted to the cultural and
economic realities of a Third World
country.
However, despite the important work ac¬¨
complished by these and many other ar¬¨
chitects all over the world, during the 1950s
and 1960s earth building continued to be
marginal and precarious as compared with
the predominant modes of thought and pro¬¨
duction. The advocates of "progress at any
price" were strong in numbers at that time
of economic euphoria in the West and of
political euphoria in a number of Third
World countries then coming to in¬¨
dependence. From the very start the mere
idea of using earth as an officially approved
building material was scorned and rejected.
This was the golden age of the "interna¬¨
tional style" in architecture, of unbridled
industrialization and "heavy" technology
which so many countries adopted as their
chief or sole model for economic, technical
and cultural development.
For many reasons decision-makers and
planners have now become more realistic
and have adopted a more diversified ap¬¨
proach. Various development myths have
given way to doubts followed by a search
for less grandiose, less "universal" solu¬¨
tions that are better adapted to local
realities. The concepts of "appropriate
technology" (appropriate to a specific con¬¨
text) and "intermediate technology" (in
termediate between the costly heavy
technology of the industrialized countries
and archaic, outmoded traditional tech¬¨
niques) have come into their own.
Since 1972 international energy and
economic crises have imposed an urgent
reappraisal of modes of thought and action,
not only in the rich but also in the poorer
countries. Substitute energy-saving solu¬¨
tions were suddenly needed in the building
sectora big energy consumer in all coun¬¨
tries. It was then discovered that the
customary building materials, such as ce¬¨
ment, concrete, steel and even baked bricks,
were, by their very nature, high energy
consumers.
By the early 1970s a small international
group of architects and engineers had
already foreseen this inevitable develop¬¨
ment. They started discreetly to elaborate
alternative solutions and set up a non-profit
association within the Grenoble School of
Architecture the Craterre group. Its aim is
threefold: first, to study the whole range of
earth building techniques scientifically and
without any pre-judgement, to modernize
them and make them operational, reliable
and economical in the light of present and
future requirements; second, to participate
directly in earth building schemes, both in
Europe and in the Third World, so as to
provide a practical demonstration of new
approaches to housing and public works
problems; finally, on the basis of this
Map showing the main world regions
where there is a tradition of using unbak¬¨
ed earth as a building material. All told,
1.5 thousand million persons (30 per cent
of the world's population) live In dwell¬¨
ings made of unbaked earth. Half the
population of the developing countries is
housed in dwellings of this kind: most of
the rural population and at least 20 per
cent of town- and city-dwellers.
Adobe and rammed earth
A score of traditional techniques of
building with unbaked earth exist In dif¬¨
ferent parts of the world. The two leading
methods are based on the use of the
adobe brick (a word of Arabic or Berber
origin assimilated Into Spanish and
transmitted to the Americas where It Is
also used In English) and the wall of pis√©
de terre ("rammed earth", a French ex¬¨
pression which first appeared In Lyons In
1562 and has since found its way Into
many other languages).
The traditional adobe brick Is hand
moulded in a wooden frame In which a
mixture of earth, water and chopped
straw is piled and then dried In the sun.
Today adobes are made by using a mix
ture of earth, water and a fixative (e.g. 2
or 3 per cent of cement). The mix Is then
strongly compacted In mechanical
presses which produce more rapidly
adobes that are far more robust than the
hand-made kind.
Traditional pis√© Is made by compacting
earth mixed with water and chopped
straw In mobile wooden forms set up on
each side of the wall which Is being built,
to a minimum width of 40 cm. This tech¬¨
nique has also been modernized by In¬¨
troducing a small amount of fixative Into
the mix Instead of straw and by using a
pneumatic rammer Instead of manual
compaction using a pestle.

### 63256: A Back-to-the-earth approach to housing
Architecture using unbaked earth has
taken on a new lease of life In the United
States. The "La Luz" housing complex in
the suburbs of Albuquerque, New Mex¬¨
ico, comprises a hundred ultra-modern
luxury dwellings. It was completed in
1975. The walls of earth-plastered adobe
bricks are girdled at the top by a concrete
armature which extends to form a flat
roof. This project by the American ar¬¨
chitectAntoine Predock has already been
Inscribed on the United States National
Register of Historic Places.
balance between research and its applica¬¨
tions, to fill a serious void in the field of
training by setting up specialized courses at
university level.
In the early 1970s, thanks to this
threefold approach, the Grenoble School of
Architecture became the only one in the
world to provide this type of training, which
was open to architects and engineers from
all countries. A setting was thus created for
study and practical work on the future of
economical building techniques at a time of
very rapid growth in demand for ultra-
cheap urban and rural housing in the Third
World (the needs of urban Africa alone
within the coming fifteen years are
estimated at fifty million housing units) and
of worsening economic crisis in many of
these countries due to their enormous
foreign debts.
Under these circumstances, recourse to
earth makes it possible to avoid importing
costly materials or the energy to produce
them locally. The earth option enables a
form of development to be envisaged that is
centred on the indigenous economic,
natural, cultural and human resources of
the country or region concerned. Thanks to
appropriate transfers of modern earth
building technology it is possible to move
directly from outmoded techniques to the
most efficient processes, the houses being
constructed, if so desired, by the future oc¬¨
cupants themselves.
There has been a radical change in recent
years in the attitude, both of the public and
of decision-makers, towards the use of this
material previously regarded with prejudice
if not hostility. This change has been con¬¨
firmed by the international success of ex¬¨
hibitions such as Earth Architecture: the
future ofan age-old tradition (organized in
Paris in 1981 by the Centre de Cr√©ation In¬¨
dustrielle) and the construction of a unique
experimental housing centre in the new
town of l'Isle d'Abeau, at Villefontaine,
near Lyons, France.
The interest aroused by the latter achieve¬¨
ment has led many experts and technicians
from other parts of Europe as well as from
Asia, Africa and the Americas to come to
l'Isle d'Abeau to study on site the possibili¬¨
ty of adapting the techniques used there to
the needs of their respective countries. In
November 1984, Unesco, in collaboration
with the Craterre group, organized a one-
week, on-site seminar for a group of ar¬¨
chitects and decision-makers from six coun¬¨
tries in Africa and the Middle East who are
faced with the need to build a large number
of schools at very low cost for which this
technology could be adapted.
Encouraged by the success of this initial
experiment in earth-built dwellings and the
international interest it has aroused, the
authors of the project are already planning
a second, more ambitious and structured
project in France to meet the growing de¬¨
mand in this field.
An International Earth Building Institute
is to be established this year with Craterre as
its nucleus and in association with a number
of scientific, technical, university and
cultural partners. Its activities will be con¬¨
centrated in four sectors of major impor¬¨
tance: research, practical applications,
university-level education and information.
This strategy corresponds exactly to the
forms of action requested as an "urgent
priority" at the First International Sym¬¨
posium on Earth Construction, held at
Brussels in December 1984 under the
auspices of the United Nations.
It is hoped that a second complex will be
built in earth at l'Isle d'Abeau to house the
future Institute, the complex being com¬¨
pleted by an Earth University, an Earth Em¬¨
bassy, a Museum of Earth Building Techni¬¨
ques, an hotel and a number of individual
and collective dwellings. By its nature this
complex would provide an opportunity to
make use of an extensive range of architec¬¨
tural, urban, technical and functional
variations using earth as the building
material.
This project should be completed by the
summer of 1987, the date set by Plan
Constructionan experimental and
research body attached to the French
ministry for housing and town-planning
for an important international symposium
The French architect Fran√ßois Cointeraux
(1740-1830) was the first man to mod¬¨
ernize unbaked earth construction tech¬¨
niques and waged a lifelong struggle on
behalf of this form of architecture. He
designed urban and rural housing as well
as buildings foragricultural and Industrial
use. Above, three types of dwelling built
in 19th-century France "fordiverse social
classes" from plans by Cointeraux.
in this region to be organized in collabora¬¨
tion with the Institute. One of the objectives
of the symposium, provisionally entitled Le
Sommet de la Terre, will be to review the
real political, economic, social, technical
and cultural issues involved in the use of
earth-building methods in different parts of
the world.
Meanwhile, in 1985, China will play host
in Beijing to another international seminar
which will review the results of recent
research in which that country, like so many
others, is closely interested.
These reviews and perspectives will form
a vital, realistic contribution to the Interna¬¨
tional Year for Housing and the Homeless
which has been proclaimed by the United
Nations for 1987.
JEAN DETHIER, Belgian architect and town-
planner, is architectural consultant and
organizer of architectural exhibitions at the
Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. He has a
special interest in the promotion and spread of
information about the techniques of earth ar¬¨
chitecture, a subject in which he has become
an internationally recognized expert. He is the
author of Earth Architecture: the Future of an
Age-old Tradition and organized an exhibition
of the same name which was held in Pafis in
1981.
