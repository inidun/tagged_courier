Reaching down to a
., \,
nation s grass roots
nE work of Unesco is
one of a great crusade
for international under-
standing and betterment
founded on the belief that co-
operation between the peoples of
the world in furthering education,
science and culture can be a
deciding force in the search for
a lasting peace.
When Unesco was created in
1ü4ß, it elaborated a scheme
which was without precedent in
world organization. This was
the basic concept of national
commissions, designed to permit
governments to carry out Unes-
co's world programme on the
national and community level
through public and private orga-
nizations reaching down to the
"grass roots"of the country.
Today Unesco has 64 member
states, of which only six have not
yet formed national commissions.
Fifty-eight national commissions
out of a total of 64 member states
is indeed an impressive figure.
But is it really ? Do these bodies
actually serve as Unesco's
channel to the people ? Are they
the centres for dynamic Unesco
movements made up of civic,
labour, farmer and student
groups, as'well as cultural and
scientific associations in each-of
these countries ?
The truth is that, in many
countries, national commissions
are composed of important
figures in education, the arts and
the sciences who meet solemnly
once or twice a year in formal
assemblies. Except for a number
of outstanding exceptions, many
Unesco national commissions
have little real contact with the
people they are supposed to
represent, and some are in point
of fact almost inoperative.
Does this mean that there is a
lack of desire or willingness to
do more ? No. It is not that
national commissions do not care
to increase their effectiveness or
undertake concrete project in
which city and rural groups can
directly participate. In practi-
cally all cases they do. But
organizing such projects is a
complex matter. It often requires
special funds and at least a
small, permanent Unesco"rela-
tions staff"to plan and organize
them and then get them under
way. Most Unesco commissions
do not have funds for either.
Several weeks ago this problem
came to the forefront in Bangkok,
when Unesco brought together
for the first time the national
commission representatives from
the vast area of South Asia and
the Pacific. Afghanistan, Aus-
tralia, Cambodia, Ceylon, India,
Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Thailand, Burma
and Viet Nam were represented at
the meeting.
Many of these countries have
only recently won their political
independence. Millions of their
people can neither read nor
write, are under-fed, in ill health,
and are often unaware of their
responsibilities as citizens and of
their fundamental rights as
human beings. Most of them
are among the underdeveloped'
countries'which the United
Nations is aiding through its
programme of technical assis-
tance for economic development.
They met to discuss the
implementation of those parts of
Unesco's programme of particu-
lar urgency for their region.
These included fundamental and
adult education, free and compul-
sory elementary schooling, teach-
ing and popularizing the sciences,
the development of public library
systems, and technical assistance
for raising standards of living.
The delegates adopted a
number of specific measures for
increased action. But one thing
became very clear. The job
facing these countries was a
tremendous one. Raising the
standard of living of the great
mass of their peoples, providing
them with fundamental educa-
tion in such complex fields as
literacy, health, technology and
civics is far too difficult a job to
be tackled by government minis-
tries single-handed. It requires
the mobilization of all the resour-
ces of a country. It means that
students and scholars, scientists
and village teachers, workers and
farmers must at ! get together and
help.
And here is where the dis-
turbing bottleneck became appar-
ent. Few of the grave problems
that the national commission
delegates were considering would
really be solved unless the
commissions themselves could
play a more direct role and could
mobilize the potential resources
of their countries. The bottle-
neck lay in the commissions'own
lack of resources. They had
neither a minimum budget nor
the minimum Unesco"relations
staff"for their commissions, and
the administrative and pro-
gramming techniques to under-
take national or community
campaigns were almost complete-
ly lacking.
A cry for help went up from
the delegates of South Asia and
the Pacific. It was a plea for
some measure of outside assist-
ance, for the assignment of one
or two skilled national campaign
organizers to each commission
for a few months to enable them
to"start the ball rolling."
This is the important challenge
to Unesco, and its most active and
best organized national commis-
sions, that has come from the
Far East. On the response they
make depends the future devel-
opment of the national commis-
sions and the success of Unesco's
programme in that part of the
world.

### 70987: Report on Pátzcuaro, one of the world's most unusual social experiments

FEBRUARY 1952 Page 3-UNESCO COURIER
Island villages on Lake Patzcuaro are among those in which the Centre's
students are working. Here their main task is to help the islanders to solve the
economic problems which are the result of an ever-dwindling supply of fish.
REPORT ON
PATZCUARO
One of the world's most unusual
social experiments,
IN addition to its famed sceneryand Friday market, the Mexi-
can town of Patzcuaro recently
acquired a third distinction. It has
become the headquarters of one of
the world's most unusual social
experiments. As its"laboratory,"
the experiment has 18 villages
framed by the scenery of Michoa-
can and peopled by the bronzed
descendants of Tarascan Indians
who are still more attached to their
own musical language than to the
Spanish of the rest of the country.
Six thousand feet up among the
hills of the plateau, and only slightly
above the incredibly blue lake,
Patzcuaro is one of the most exotic
of Mexican towns. Its market, en-
closed by motley colonial arcades,
has been a meeting place for cen-
turies. On Friday mornings, long
before sunrise, Tarascans with
their wives and children, in crowd-
ed ancient buses, on muleback, or
simply on foot, come along the
winding road leading from the lake
to the town. Old and young, all
carry their heavy burden of things
produced during the week. It is
on this day that they have to
exchange the products of their tra-
ditional skills for the coins that
will buy them the necessities of a
rigidly simple life for the rest of
the week.
By ten in the morning the square
is crowded with people. Baskets and
fruits, sashes and serapes, fish and
fishing-nets, pottery and straw som-
breros are on display. Among the
pyramids of colour, of restless poul-
try and frolicking children, there
is also the open-air apothecary's
stall, displaying its strange assort-
ment of dried sea-urchins, alligator
heads, earths and herbs, surrounded
by Tibor MENDE
THIS is the second in a series of articles on Latin America by TiborMende, author and journalist, who recently visited Central and South
America on assignment for Unesco. In last month's Courier,
Mr. Mende reported on Unesco's pilot project in education in the Marbial
Valley of Haiti. Below, he tells of his visit to Patzcuaro, in the State of Michoa-
can, Mexico. Here on May 9, 1951, Unesco and the Organization of American
States launched the first regional centre to train leaders of teachers of funda-
mental education for Latin America. The Patzcuaro centre is a workshop
producing men and tools to be used for creating similar workshops elsewhere
in Latin America. The fifty teachers Patzcuaro trained last year cannot by
themselves do much to reduce Latin American illiteracy or to alleviate the
poverty that accompanies it. But they are the beginning of a chain process
of teaching other teachers, which gradually will provide the human and mate-
rial means of coping with the problem. This is the key to the existence of
Patzcuaro, and also to the network of regional education centres Unesco is
setting up throughout the world.
by dancing masks and a thousand
other exciting things.
In this orgy of sunshine and
colour and the babble of voices
rising over the foliage of the trees,
there mingle the sorrows and hopes
of a people who have been by-
passed by mankind's technological
advance. Their lives and desires,
so pathetically centred around this
place of exchange, are slowly adapt-
ing themselves to another focus of
their activities. It is less colour-
ful, of less immediate benefit but,
in the long run, of even greater
significance.
On their way back to the little
pier where their quaint dug-out
canoes are waiting, they pass a gate
with a simple notice nailed over it :
"International Territory-United
Nations."Behind the gate are the
Headquarters of CREFAL (Centre
Regional de Educación Fundamental
de America Latina), Latin America's
first training centre for rural edu-
cators, set up by Unesco. From its
windows, looking out across the
lake, one can see the"laboratory,"
the villages of the Tarascans.
In less than half-an-hour one is
across to the first island. Janitzio
is a village of less than 1, 500 souls,
situated in the middle of the lake.
Here a team of Unesco students
pays a daily visit. Only a small
section of the path leading up to
the hill is paved..
Old men with wrinkled faces sit
in the sun and repair their fishing-
nets. Old and young women spread
the tiny fish on the ground to dry
them in the sun. Children stretch
the nets between branches of the
trees, and a small boy is asleep in a
big cardboard box, while his mother
is mending nets.
The lives of the people of Janit-
zio are centred around fishing.
When the conquering Spaniards
subdued the proud Tarascans, the
King of Spain sent a bishop to take
care of their affairs. Vasco de
Quiroga, the man on whom his
choice fell, began to organize the
people around'he lake and two teach
them crafts. He èhoSß a different
one for each village, and these av
been passed on from generation to
generation.
Janitzio's people have been living
on fishing for centuries, and it is
their privilege to take the famed
pescado blanco or white fish to the
Friday market. They do no basket-
making or pottery, but, like all the
other villages, just slick to their
own trade.
It is this strange status quo, this
centuries-old gentlemen's agreement
between the villages of the lake,
that provides the basic background
to the"laboratory"of 18 villages.
To improve the lives of the villag-
ers is possible only by respecting
this status quo and working within
the framework of their traditional
occupations. For, to achieve last-
ing improvements, projects have to
be organized and carried out by the
inhabitants themselves.
Up, behind the church, there is
a tiny plateau and a group of young
fishermen are working on it, shovel
in hand. Our Unesco team-a
Haitian girl and a young man from
San Salvador-are greeted like
old friends. Instead of the custom-
ary siesta, these fishermen are
putting in their few hours mixing
concrete and spreading it across the
tittle square.

ground in Michoaean."declares AI-
fouzo Vargas, one of the working
team."n cost 300 pesos... and do

pride, and explains that they have
to hurry sup because the rest of the
road leading-up from the pier will
also have to be paved by Christmas.
"It's all voluntary work,"Vargas
says,"we all have only a few hours
each dav... after wall. the lake comes
first..."and he looks out over the
blue crater that for centuries has
provided the livelihood of Janitzio.
Meanwhile, the Haitian girl has
drifted away and she is
discussing with an old
woman how the fish
could be dried with less
effort and in a more
hygienic fashion. Var-
gas and his fellows are
in agitated discussion
with the young teacher
from San Salvador
about the price of ce-
ment and how a little
could be saved to repair
the cracked wall of the
church.
One of them brings up
an old project of pub-
lishing a mall guide-
book to explain to visit-
ing tourists the mural
paintings inside the
giant Morelos statue on
the top of the hill.
"From the sales of the
booklet we might buy a
small canning machine
and preserve our fish,"
one of the bovs re-
marks. The others look
sceptical.
"It's up to us,"Var-
gas retorts,"we have
to think of the futnre."
And the teacher from
San Salvador helps
them to calculate the
cost and promises to
discuss the plan at the
Centre.
Next day we go to
Ihuatzio, a village on
the shore. It is smaller
even than Janitzio. The
people are agricultur-
ists, and more reserved
than the fishermen of
Janitzio, who are quite
used to seelllg VISltlllg
strangers admiring their
island.
The village has a
sleepy air ; the wooden
planks of the landing
jetty are hanging in the
water ; pigs and dogs
roam the neglected
streets : and anart from
a few children sitting
around in the middle of
the road and playing
marbles on a serape,
there is seemingly little
interest in our group.
But the Mexican spe-
cialist in rural educa-
tion who came with us
takes me to a ! itt) e clear-
ing in front of an emph
building, and proudly
points to a group of
men rlearing stones from the
ground.
"They are volunteers,"he says.
"They are preparing the square
and repairing-the building which
is to he their community centre.
One day the viHage co-operative
will he directed from here..."
We wade through mud and water
and arrive at a modest house where
young women stand chatting on the
porch. The busy themselves
around a young Costa Rican student
of the Centre, who shows them
how to embroider t1e belts which
they send to the market each Fri-
day. Their conversation shifts to
questions of food. The student
explains to them how metals can he
varied and prepared more hygienic-
ally.
"We are getting them to do
something about that jetty too,"the
Mexican specialist says. But I in-
terrupt him :"All this is very
little... too slow."
The Mexican's tone, which has
been enthusiastic, becomes empha-
tic."You can change society
by either revolution or evolution,"
he says."The first may be quicker
and more spectacular-but pro-
hnhly less tasting. In this country
we have certainly had enougih
experience of it. Our way is the
painful, slow method of teaching
people how they can change their
livers. It is not imposed, it is deve-
loped... it is stop, but it is lasting."
He pauses, then goes on again.
"You could change this village from
top to bottom in 24 hours-it has
been tried before. But in a few
months, in a year, everything would
be right back where it was in the
past.
"You see, once these people really
feel and believe that the changes
are necessary, and get together and
build their own co-operative or
adopt a new method of working
because they realize its advantages,
AT THE CENTRE
I saw proof of that on another
of Lake Patzcuaro's tiny islands-
Jaracuaro. The Tarascans of this
village are no richer than their
neighbours. Yet, when they ferried
our team over to their island, they
refused to take money for it.
"Xot from you, Señor..."said
Pascal Corral, secretary of the vil-
lage council, as he was offered the
money by Filiberto Tentori, the
popular'Mexican teacher-student
working in this community. Here
... AND OUTSIDE
An instructor explains the use of the cine-camera. Heaith education is fun when it's  puppet show.
Discussing future posters in art studio. Tarascan women learn fine points of needlework.
Filmstrips are produced to meet local needs.
Ihuatzio will haze taken a lasting
step forward.
"And that's exactly why we're
here : not to do things for the peo-
ple, but to help them to do things
for themselves. Real rural educa-
tion must rest on this basic prin-
ciple... and, by necessity, the results
must be slow and gradual."
Results, of course, depend on a
number of factors. Some villages
may be more aloof and more suspi-
cious of outside interference than
ochers. The personality of teacher-
students in the teams that visit
the villages is of great importance.
There is an inevitable period of
"probing."First the students will
just walk around trying to under-
stand the problems of"their"ví\-
lage and be ready to offer advice
wherever it is asked for.
Sometimes circumstances may
favour their work. In one of the
villages confidential relationship
was quickly established because one
of the students was able to offer
quick and effective help to combat a
violent outbreak of malaria. In some
others, lire Ihuatzio, it took two
months before the villagers began
to display any desire to co-operate.
But the more resistance there is
to overcome, the more lasting the
improvements will be, as they
spring from the conviction that the
advice and example given have led
to self-help and an improvement in
living conditions.
It's easy to enlarge that window, student explains.
the daily arrival of the team is
greeted'with friendly smiles, with
roadside chats about current pro-
blems, and with the confidence
shown to comrades who are offering
a friendly hand.
Jaracuaro is the"sombrero-
island,"which manufactures wide-
brimmed straw-hats. But there is
also a tittle) and behind the village
where most of the food needed is
produced. When we entered Vi-
cente Rendon's house we were greet-
ed with the words :"My house is
at your disposaL"He and his
assistant were working on their
machines, sewing straw-ribbons
into a hat. White another young
man struggled with the creaking
press to flatten the straw, Vicente
talked about a power-press.
Now that the village co-operative
is in existence and has decided to
have an eieetric power-press, the
co-operative is about to embark on
its first serious action.'Vith the
help of the Pátzcuaro Centre, the
Electricity Commission agreed to
the village's request. In a matter
of weeks, the cables will be sunk
into the water across the lake.
The poles to carry the wires have
already been hauled across the
water'buy a fleet of canoes organized
bv the villagers, and now everybody
is waiting for the day when the
light will go on in the church of
Jaracuaro.
The basket-ball ground is already
on sports was written
by the young people
themselves.
In next month's issue
they intend to launch a
campaign for the build-
ing of a wood cause-
way across the water.
This would save buying
canoes, which are ex-
pensive.
Jaracuaro is wide
awake and is beginning
to take its future in its
own hands. On our
way back, swaying in
the shaky canoe, Fili-
berto proudly told me :
"When I first came here
five months ago they
looked just as suspi-
cious as the people you
have seen in Ihuatzio.
When they had an epi-
demic among their pigs
: md I told them that
they ought to kill and
burn the diseased ani-
mals, they were furious.
Now, however, they
understand why they
should."
The story is not very
different in the other
"laboratory"villages.
Problems and human
reactions varv accord-
ing to local circumstan-
ces. But beyond them
all, there is a patient
transformation that
slowly changes the out-
look of the men and
women going up to the
P ; ítzcuaro market every
Friday morning. Slowly,
their own efforts will
give them better results.
Already communities
are beginning to adopt
new ways which will
make life in them both
more rational and more
humane.
Behind the transfor-
mation stands CREFAL
with its educational
films, its slides and lec-
tures, its 50 teacher-
students from nine dif-
ferent countries, the
educational experts, the
specialists and techni-
cians and the handful of
devoted men who direct
the entire operation.
The teams, always com-
posed of five specialized
pupils (for health, eco-
nomics, labour pro-
blems, basic education and're-
creation activities) geo out to learn
while helping the villagers.
I was speaking of results one
morning with one of the directors
of the Unesco Fundamental Edu-
cation Centre when he interrupted
me impatiently :"Our principal
amhition is not to get quick results,
though naturallv it is satisfying to
see results... hut our real task is to
train these 50 young teachers, and
the many others who will come
after them, how to tackle these pro-
blems of village education... the

### 70925: The Book that roused a nation a hundred years ago

FEBRUARY 1952 Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
T N1850, the wifeof a Puritan
clergyman, Mrs.
Harriet Beecher
Stowe, was chal-
lenged by her
sister-in-law,
Mrs. Edward Bee-
cher, to"write
something that
would make this
whole nation feel
what an accursed
thing slavery is."
The answer to
that challenge
was Uncle Tom's
Cabin ; or Life
Among the Lowly
which appeared
serially in the
National Era, an
anti-slavery
newspaper of
Washington, D. C.
in 1851. It was
published in book form on March
20, 1852-one hundred years ago
- in two volumes, with a woodcut
of a Negro cabin as the frontispiece
(see photo at top of page).
Although no-one had expected
the work to be popular or success-
ful (the Boston publisher who had
contracted for the book rights pro-
tested that she was making the
story too long), ten thousand copies
were sold in less than a week and
within a year sales in the United
States amounted to some 300, 000
copies. In England, where the Brit-
ish slave trade had been abolished
in 1833, the book swept across the
country. Circulation reached a
million and a half by the end of the
first year in a triumph of pirated
edition.
Although hastily written, its
drama and emotional ardour gave
it wide appeal. It was soon trans-
lated into more than 20 languages,
and presented countless times on
the stage and in the cinema. As
late as 1890, sixteen separate com-
panies of actors were taking Uncle
Ton's Cabin from town to town in
the United States, presenting the
play in tents, and it was shown on
the American stage every year until
the 1930's.
Soon after the book reached Eur-
ope in 1852, a French critic, M.
John Lemoine, wrote in the Jour-
nal des Debates :"here is a little
book which in a few hundred pages
contains all the elements of a revo-
lution... It will do more for the
freeing of the Negroes than all the
speeches, all the sermons, or all the
treaties and crusades have done up
until now... It is perhaps the most
profound blow ever delivered
against a blasphemous institution-
slavery ; and this blow has been de-
livered by a wo-
man."
Few books, in-
deed, have had a
more direct and
powerful influ-
ence on America-
and on the rest
of the world-
than Uncle Tom's
6'abtH. By its vi-
vi d descriptions
of Negro suffering
and oppression, it
stirred up a
whirlwind of anti-
slavery agitation
in the North.
More and more
ì\'ortherners came
to believe that
Southern masters
were generally
eruel to their
slaves. Although
slaves in general
were fairly well
treated, th. North
became convinced
that the opposite
was true. Pro-
bably no other
book in the his-
tory of the United
States ever arous-
ed such a storm
of anger. It serv-
ed as one of the
important forces
in bringing about
the Civil War.
Harriet Beecher
Stowe had not
foreseen the
storm of wrath
which Uncle tom
was to arouse. In
the South, slave-
holders condemned it as extremelv
unfair, and her very name was
hated. A cousin living in Georgia
wrote that she feared rev, riving
letters with her name on the outside
envelope. The Southern Literary
Dessert'gear declared the book a
"criminal prostitution of the high
functions of the imagination,"
adding that the author had"placed
herself without the pale of kindly
treatment at the hands of Southern
criticism."
Mrs. Stowe, however, apparently
had a fondness for the South.
While she hated it for upholding
slavery, she portrayed its atmo-
sphere with sympathy. For this
the Abolitionists criticized her,
affirming that the book showed too
many of the favourable aspects of
slavery. From all sides, therefore,
she was attacked and the accuracy
of her facts questioned. Her reply
to this criticism was A Key to uncle
Tom's Cabin, published in 1853.
From the popular point of view this
book was a total failure. In 1856,
she wrote a second anti-slavery
novel, Dred : A Tale of the Dismal
Swamp. This too failed to achieve
any popularity, except in England
where 100, 000 copies were sold in
less than a month. Today, the
book is practically unknown.
The slavery question which rent
the abolitionist North and slave-
holding South was, of course, no-
thing new when Mrs. Stowe's book
appeared in 1852. In the 18th
century, many Southerners had
condemned slavery in principle and
tolerated it only as a temporary
measure. Washington and Jefferson,
both slave-owners, were hostile to
slavery, while John Randolph had
freed his. Two events occurred,
however, which
were destined to
transform the in-
teT'Pt""r : 1. ! ti'1S
of the South : the
invention of the
cotton gin in 1793,
which revolution-
ized the cotton
industry and
brought with it
an enormous in-
ftux of slave
labour from
Africa ; and the
law of 1808 which
stopped further
importation
of slaves, thereby
placing a prem-
ium on existing
slave labour.
Thus the South
came to defend
slavery with heat-
ed passion as one
of the mainstays
of its existence.
Planters failed to
see anythina
odious about slav-
ery in the same
way as the in-
dustrialists of the
. North were later
unmoved by the
e v i I s of child
labour. Apologists
of slavery preach-
ed the doctrine of
"a natural and
divine order"as-
serting.'that men
should reduce one
another to slavery
is part of nature
in the same way
Harriet Beecher
Stowe was the
first American
write to take the
Negro seriously
and to conceive a
novel with the
black man as the
hero. Although
to some people
nowadays Uncle
Tom's Cabin may
, eem of little more
than historical
interest, it never-
theless remains
as one of the
world's most fam-
JUS novels. It
played a great
part in arousing
public opinion ; it
: ertainly hastened
the abolition of
slavery..
as it is the natural order of things
that animals eat one another."One
apologist, a Mr. Harper, even went
so far as to declare ;"It is true
that the slave has no hope of
improving his lot ; but as he owns
nothing, he has nothing to lose."
But it was the Fugitive Slave
Law of 1850 that really aroused
Northerners to the evils of slavery.
This law not only gave federal
authorities the right to arrest fugi-
tive slaves, but made it a crime to
help a Negro to escape. And no
proof was needed to make an arrest.
It was this new slave law that set
off the spark of intense abolitionist
feeling in Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Before that, her letters confirm her
son's statement that for many years
she"was anti-slavery in her sym-
pathies, but she was not a declared
abolitionist."Her father, a Calvin-
ist pastor, was one of the links in
the"Underground Railroad."His
. : iIJ. minary was a hotbed of anti-
"' ; ;,.. cry sentiment ; and one of the
most extreme advocates of Aboli-
tionism, Theodore D. Weld, was an-
early student there. For 18 years
she lived in Cincinnatti, Ohio. Just
across the Ohio River lay slave
territory and visits to plantations
quickened Harriet Beecher's hatred
of slavery. Her husband was also
strongly hostile to slavery. Together
they later helped many fugitive
slaves to escape to safety. Her
brother, Edward Beecher, fanned
her sentiments on slavery to white
heat. From his Boston pulpit he
thundered against the Fugitive
Slave Law, and it was his wife who
wrote to Mrs. Stowe to.'write
something that would make this
whole nation feel what an accursed
thing slavery is."

### 70979: The Ever-restless atom


UNESCO COURIER-Page 6 FEBRUARY 1952
THE EVER RESTLESS AIOM
by Ira M. Freeman
THE notion that gross matter is not the uniform,continuous substance that it appears to be goes
back to ancient times and man's first specula-
tions about the world. The Greek philosophers
Leucippus, Epicurus and Democritus supported the
doctrine that matter consists of minute, hard par-
ticles, invisible and eternal, and in a state of contin-
ual motion. Such a particle was called an atom,
from the Greek word meaning"indivisible."
The thoughts of these early atomists survived only
in the famous poem of Lucretius, De Rerum Natura,
written several centuries later. Theorizing about
the nature of matter lay practically dormant during
the Middle Ages, and the atomic idea was not ser-
iously revived until the seventeenth century, when
Pierre Gassendi, in France, began to examine some
of the physical consequences of this hypothesis. By
assuming the atoms of a given substance to be all
alike and to rush about randomly, colliding fre-
quently in their frenzied, restless movement, he was
able to offer a plausible picture of the observed
behaviour of matter.
All known substances are either solid, liquid or
gaseous. We are familiar with water, not only in
its liquid state, but also as a solid (ice) and as a gas
(steam or vapour). A true solid has a characteristic
crystal form, as manifested by the variety of beautiful
geometric shapes shown by natural crystals such as
gems and minerals. These forms are but reflections
of the regularity of arrangement of the atoms
within the crystals, held as though arrayed on some
invisible framework, yet capable of vibrating about
their appointed positions.
If heat is sapplied to a crystal, the excursions of
the atoms are increased until they succeed in break-
ing away from the powerful forces that make them
cohere to their neighbours, and the solid melts. It
is now a liquid, in which the atoms'are no longer
constrained to the orderly arrangement of the crystal.
IN ORDINARY AIR, each particle
* has a diameter of about 0. 00000004 of a centimetre,
* weighs about 0. 00000000000000000000005 of a gram..
* moves with an average speed of 50, 000 cms. a second,
* collides with its neighbours 5, 000, 000, 000 times a second.
There are 27, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 particles in each
cubic centimetre of air.
Even under ordinary conditions, but especially at
higher temperatures, there are some favoured atoms
or groups of atoms (called molecules), pos-
sessing excess energy which enables them to
wrench themselves loose from the attractions of the
ethers and soar away as individuals in the space
above the liquid mass. The aggregate of these in-
dependent molecules is the vapour-a. gas. It is a
collection of jostling flying particles, filling the
container by their motion. Raising the temperature
results in swifter motion and the gas presses more
strongly against the walls of its confining vessel ;
lowering the temperature has the opposite effect.
Only at the absolute zero of temperature would the
motion cease altogether (see the Courier for
October, 1951).
Because in a gas the molecules are free of mutual
infiuences except at the instant of collision, a gas
is the simplest state of matter, and so is the best
understood. The English scientist Callendar aptly
described a gas as"a homogeneous chaos, with that
uniformity in the midst of diversity which is charac-
teristic of probability."The branch of mathematics
appropriate for treating the behaviour of a swarm of
particles is statistics, whose application to gases and
more recently to liqüids and solids as well have not
only led to a rather complete understanding of the
structure of matter in the large in terms of matter
in the small, but have also succeeded in revealing the
magnitudes and characteiiSHCs of molecules.
The Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli was the first
to ascribe the pressure of a gas to the impacts of its
molecules-individually feeble and erratic, but pro-
ducing a steady and considerable effect in the
aggregate. Over a century later, Waterston and
Joule improved his calculations and established the
first mathematical relationship involving molecular
magnitudes. In rapid succession the mathematical
attack was continued by Kronig and Clausius in
Germany and by Maxwell in Britain, so that by the
middle of the nineteenth century the so-called
kinetic theory of gases was well founded.
When the theory was compared with experimental
observations on gross matter, the results were aston-
ishing. Molecules were revealed as entities a hundred-
millionth of a centimetre in size and weighing but
a few biIIionths of a billionth of a gram ; they were
shown to be moving with speeds of the order of a
kilometre per second. This knowledge and much
more has been obtained in spite of the impossibility
of seeing or handling individual atoms or molecules.
As early as 1827 an English botanist, Robert Brown,
observed that grains of pollen suspended in water
executed a ceaseless trembling motion, and this was
correctly interpreted later as resulting from the
irregular impacts of the surrounding water particles
on the pollen grains. This interpretation was borne
out by the experiments of Jean Perrin in France
early this century. Meanwhile, Einstein had supplied
the mathematical theory of this phenomenon.
Since that time, the kinetic theory has been round-
ed out to give science a much more comprehensive
picture of the nature of matter. The reality of
atoms is no longer questioned-indeed, the tide
of research has swept on in the last half-century to
explore the constituents of the atom itself and to
study their behaviour (see"Fundamental Par-
ticles-What Are They ?"In July-August Courier).
A scientific hypothesis is valuable only to the
extent that it relates the unknown to simplier
experiences, and to the extent that it suggests new
lines of investigation. Jildged in this light, the
kinetic theory of matter is one of the. most success-
ful scientific theories ever proposed.

### 70980: Safety on the high seas

FEBRUARY 1952 Page 7-UNESCO COURIER
A FIELD as old as man's spiritof adventure and enterprise
is now coming within the
scope of United Nations activities.,
as the seafaring nations take
new steps for joint action to deve-
lop and improve measures for
bringing maritime hazards under
control.
Two international conferences
have prepared the ground. The
U. N. Maritime Conference, which
met at Geneva in 1948, established
IMCO (the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organi-
zation), which will join the U. N.
Specialized Agencies. This organi-
zation is still in the early stages
of formation. As soon as it comes
formally into being, its task will
be to promote higher standards of
maritime safety and efficiency of
navigation. Another important
step was a Sea Safety Conference
held in London the same year. It
prepared and opened for ac-
ceptance the International Con-
vention for the Safety of Life at
Sea, 1948, which will replace the
old convention of 1929.
37, 000 lighthouses
MARITIME co-operation is notnew. Faced with the perils
of the sea, man early
understood the need for common
action. Beacons sprang up all
over the world to mark perilous
waters, shoals and reefs, and today
the globe is dotted with some
37, 000 lighthouses. Between the
ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria,
one of the seven wonders of the
world, and the helicopter patrol of
today, lies a story of practical and
effective co-operation among na-
tions to establish common methods
for guiding and guarding ships
wherever they sail. Lifeboat ser-
vice, maintenance of buoys,
weather charts and international
signalling codes are only a few
examples. A typical measure is an
international agreement of 1930
establishing the International Load
Line, designed to prevent over-
loading of vessels with cargo and
passengers. Similarly, rules were
laid down for collision prevention ;
and since the Titanic disaster in
1912, a regular iceberg patrol has
been operated by the U. S. Navy for
the benefit of all nations. Now it
is financially supported on an in-
ternational basis.
Although modern science has
placed at the seafarer's disposal
new means of making shipping
safe, nature still takes a heavy toll
of man's life and property. For
instance, in 1946, the first year of
peace, as many as 179 vessels were
lost on the high seas, representing
a gross tonnage of 370, 000. This
indicates clearly that, due to the
vast increase in sea and air traffic,
the need for international co-
operation is as great as ever.
Weather-rescue ships
TODAY, under direct or indirect
U. N. encouragement, new
progress is being made in ma-
ritime safety. An important part
is played by a patrol network of
weather-rescue ships established
recently along the main traffic
routes in the North Atlantic. These
vessels, equipped with the latest
scientific devices, make periodic
observations of weather conditions
and relay their information to
shore stations for incorporation in
weather forecasts. At the same
time, they supply weather data to
ships and transoceanic planes, and
keep constant watch for any craft
in distress. The scheme, sponsored
by the International Civil Aviation
Organization of the United Nations,
is operated on an international
basis.
When the Safety of Life at Sea
Convention comes into force, and
its provisions embodying the latest
scientific advances are generally
accepted and put into practice, the
men who sail the seas, both pas-
senger and sailor, will greatly
benefit from this new agreement
among nations.
FIRES ABOARD SHIP have long been the scourge of the seafarer. These
strange-looking asbestos suits-a product of research into safety at sea-
enable many a fire-fighter to save life as well as valuable cargoes. (U. N. Photo.)

### 70982: The Work of a century in a few minutes: calculating machines, and the revolution in science which they are helping to bring about

THE WORK OF A
CENTURY-IN A
FEW MINUTES
Calculating machines,
and the revolution in
science which they are
helping to bring about
by Dr. S. LILLEY
University of Birmingham,
Department of Extra-Mural Studies
OW much... ?""How many... ?" A surprisingly large number of important questions of
modern life begin with those words. How many skilled mechanics can India rely on for
. building much-needed machinery ? How much will a sixpence-in-the-pou d increase in
income tax yield ? How much energy can you get from a pound of uranium 235 ?
Some of the most important questions of all do not, at first sight, take this form :-For instance, can
India avoid a famine in 1956 ? But to answer it, we have to ask : How many mouths will there be to
feed ? How much food can India's own agriculture produce ? How much of her manufactures
can she export to make up for the deficiency ?... and so back to that first question about skilled
mechanics. Without"How much ?" and"How many ?"we should not make our modern world
work.
In science, more than anything else, these two questions are of vital importance. There is scarcely
any major scientific problem-from the nature of the universe to the workings of the endocrine glands,
from the utilisation of atomic energy to the assessment of an adequate diet-whose solution does
not depend essentially on counting and measuring, and then making calculation.
Making calculations-that is the important point. To answer"How much ?"and"How many ?"
it is usually not good enough to measure, weigh and count. We must also do immense calculations
to deduce facts about a whole population in 1956 from a few thousand answers to a sample survey
in 1951, or to calculate the energy obtainable from a uranium pile on the basis of data produced from
small-stale experiments with cyclotrons.
It is with this process of calculation and the ingenuity that has gone into making machines to do
it for us that this article is concerned.
"How much ?" and"How many ?" have not always
been so important. They are characteristically
modern questions. Until some 350 or 400 years ago
they mattered rather little. The small peasant
communities that made up most of the world till
then could get along very well with a minimum of
calculation.
Even the cities of Greece or the Empire of Rome
needed less in the way of statistics than a town
council does today. And in science before the 16th
century, the characteristic questions were not"How
much ?" and"How, many ?" but"What sort ?" and
"Why ?"
Calculation played so small a part in ancient life
that most people were content with cumbersome
systems of arithmetical notation, of which Roman
numerals is only one of the worst examples. It is
hard enough to add with these old systems ; it is
almost impossible to multiply. And so calculations
were commonly done with an abacus-by moving
beads on wires or counters on a marked board.
In a sense, the abacus was the first calculating
machine. But it does not count for much in our
story. Though it can be extremely quick, it is less
efficient than calculation on paper. And the first
step towards our modern arithmetical world was
the development, mostly in the later Middle Ages,
of our familiar methods of adding, subtracting,
multiplying and dividing, so that calculations could
conveniently be done on paper without the help of
an abacus.
Towards the end of the 16th century the modern
world was fast emerging. The local, almost self-
sufficient units of feudalism were being bound
together to form truly national states-which
needed statistics of taxability and military resour-
ces. Large-scale commerce was growing ; custom or
guild rules no longer served to guide the business-
man, but had to be replaced by extensive and accu-
rate calculations of cost, selling price and profit.
Surveying, mining engineering, military engineer-
ing, and a host of other techniques were coming to
rely more and more on mathematical accuracy.
Science was taking on its characteristically modern
form with its emphasis on"How much"and"How
many."Men grew very interested in saving time
and trouble in their calculations. In 1585 the
Dutchman Simon Stevin published his little book
advocating the use of decimal fractions and so
inaugurated a new era in arithmetic. And in 1614
John Napier of Scotland made logarithms known
to the world.
In this atmosphere it could not be long before
some genius or other would invent a calculating
machine. In fact two of the really outstanding
scientists of the 17th century-Blaise Pascal and
G. W. Leibnitz-besides numerous minor men of
science, devised such machines. Pascal's father,
as a Government superintendent in the French
département of Haute-Normandie, had to check an
enormous number of accounts, and it was to aid
him in this work that his 18-year old son designed
the first machine for adding and subtracting, and
constructed it in 1642 with the aid of a Rouen
blacksmith.

It can add or subtract even larger numbers 3, 500 timl
Several other similar machines were invented. In
1694, Leibniz produced the first machine that could
do all the ordinary processes of arithmetic : add,
subtract, multiply and divide.
During the 18th century many more inventors
tried their hands at calculating machines, and
before 1800 they had created practically all the
devices that go to make up a modern"general pur-
poses" (adding, subtracting, multiplying and divid-
ing) machine.
But none of these instruments was a practical
success. Some would work well enough when
handled carefully by experts, but the engi-
neering technique was not available to turn out
calculators good enough and reliable enough for
day-to-day use.
However, with the gradual improvement of en-
gineering techniques, practical machines came
during the 19th century. The first was that of the
Frenchman Thomas de Colmar, which appeared in
1820.
In 1892 came the best known of all calculating
machines, the Brunsviga, which was such a success
that some 20, 000 were sold within 20 years. By now
the general purposes machine had reached the end
of its basic evolution-though many improve-
ments have been added since, the most important
being the electrical drive, to relieve the computer
of the labour of churning away at a handle.
The machines we have so far been describing are
called"digital machines,"because they work with

the actual digits with which numbers are
written. The later 19th and especially the 20th
century have also witnessed the development of a
wide variety of machines of a different class-
"analogue machines,"as they are called.
The basic idea behind all these is very simple.
The behaviour of any machine can be represented
by a set of mathematical equatians and their solu-
tion. Conversely, given a set of mathematical
equations, one can construct a machine whose
behaviour would be represented by them ; if one,
then, sets the machine working and observes the
motions of its various parts, one has the solution
of the equations. A speedometer, for example, is
an analogue machine which calculates speed
from the relation between distance travelled and
time (mathematically, it differentiates).
A very important class of mathematical problem
depends for its solution on the reverse of this pro-
cess (integration). For instance, if you know the
relations between the rates at which various quan-
tities are changing (differential equations), and
their starting value, where will they get to in a
given time ? Or, to give an easier example : given
the motorist's speed at every point, how far will he
go in an hour ?
As early as 1876 Lord Kelvin sketched a plan for
a"differential analyser"-an analogue machine for
solving problems of this type. However, he was not
able to overcome the mechanical problems involv-
ed, and the development of the differential ana-
lyser had to wait till 1931, when Dr. Vannevar
Bush hit on a very simple way of dealing with the
difficulties. Since then differential analysers have
been in constant us. e at dozens of computing labo-
ratories, while many other types of analogue ma-
chines have been developed.
Analogue machines have one great advantage
over the digital machines we described earlier-
they will solve a complete problem at one fell
swoop, whereas the digital machine will only do
elementary additions, subtractions, multiplications
and divisions, and the computer must arrange to
combine thousands of these elementary steps to
solve the complete problem.
Against that, analogue machines have several
disadvantages. Their accuracy tends to be rather
low, and they are not flexible-each machine will
solve one type of problem only, whereas the com-
puter and digital machine between them can solve
any problem, if given time.
Would it be possible to make a machine with the
advantages of both-a machine that would solve
complete problems without the minute-to-minute
guidance of a computer as the analogue machines
do, but which will tackle any problem and give
results to any desirable accuracy ? The answer is
Yes.
In the last few years, remarkable machines (of
the digital type) with just these powers have been
built and put into use. One starts by feeding the
machine with a list of instructions and a few initial
numbers, and then it gets on with the calculations,
adding this pair of numbers, dividing that pair,
storing results in a"memory,"picking out of the
store the numbers it wants for the next step-and
so on until the whole complex calculation is
finished without any human help.
This is not quite the miracle that it seems at first
sight. The duties of a computer using an ordinary
digital machine to solve a typical problem can be
reduced to a series of instructions which read :"At
such-and-such a stage, take the two numbers that
are written in such-and-such places in the first
column on the paper before you, add them (or
subtract, multiply or divide), and write the answer
in such-and-such a place in the second column."
There may be a few dozen of these instruc-
tions-and then will come the order"Repeat

### 70982: The Work of a century in a few minutes: calculating machines, and the revolution in science which they are helping to bring about

FEBRUARY 1952
Machines that relieve man of mental drudgery
(Continued from previous page)
all this, but using the numbers in the second
column,"and so on. Obviously a process like
this can be mechanised.
The machine will have to have units which
will add, subtract, multiply or divide any two
numbers supplied to them ; it will have to have
a"memory"in which it can store the results of
calculations until they are wanted again ; and
it will have to have some means of receiving
instructions about the routine it is to follow
and of transmitting these instructions to its
various parts. It needs a few other elements
too, which we need not bother about now. The
point is that each of these units is simple in
itself and the only complication arises in
connecting them together to make one very
complex and highly integrated organism.
In 1833 Charles Babbage, a Cambridge ma-
thematician, proposed the construction of a
machine on just these lines. His plans in-
cluded in principle practically every device
that is used by the modern machines, but he
never succeeded in putting them into practice.
It is probable that such a machine built en-
tirely in mechanical terms-of gears, levers

matician who, in

most every device
that is now in use.
and the like-would have been unworkable in
practice, and no other form was possible in
the 19th century.
But in the 20th century we have two new
types of devices which alter the picture com-
pletely-electro-mechanical relays (in everyday
use in automatic telephone exchanges) and
electronic devices such as radio valves, photo
cells and cathode ray tubes. By using these,
instead of mechanical elements like gear
wheels, practical problems become manage-
able, and in addition much higher speeds are
obtainable. Machines that do all that Babbage
planned have within the last seven years be-
come almost common.
The first of these giant calculators, the Au-
tomatic Sequence Controlled Calculator at
Harvard, brain-child of Professor H. H. Aiken,
started work in 1944. It was an electro-mag-
netic relay type. By the standards that have
since been reached it was a slow machine-
taking about a third of a second to add two 23-
figure numbers or about six seconds to multiply
them-yet even at those speeds it could work
about 100 times faster than a computer using
an ordinary calculating machine.
The Harvard machine was of momentous im-
portance as the first proof that the idea of a
fully automatic calculating machine would
work, but the future lay not with relay ma-
chines, but with those using electronic
elements. The first of these, the Electronic
Numerical Integrator and Calculator, designed
by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, Jr.,
went into action in 1946. Intended specifically
for ballistic calculations, it was limited to a
rather narrow range of problems, but the
speed had now gone up to 5, 000 additions a
second.
Since then a dozen or more of these
machines have been built in several countries.
There is no point in describing them in detail
here, and instead it will be better to note
briefly what the general abilities of a fully
automatic digital calculating machine are.
Such a machine can work at a rate of any-
thing from 15, 000 average operations a minute
upwards-that is, 10, 000 or more times faster
than a good computer with an ordinary
calculating machine.
Given appropriate instructions at the begin-
ning of a run, it can carry out a long series
of calculations without further human inter-
vention, and so solve in minutes or hours
mathematical problems that would have need-
ed years with earlier methods. Though most
of the applications have been mathematical,
these machines are by no means confined to
mathematics-they can deal with any type of
information that can be precisely stated, and
deduce its logical consequences.
These calculating giants open up vast new
possibilities for humanity. There are very
many scientific problems-in such fields as
aerodynamics and nuclear physics-in which
the theoretician can write down a set of
equations and say.'Solve these equations and
your scientific problem is solved."But in

world's great cal-
culating machines
many cases, the process of solution would be
so long that with the older methods it could
not be carried out in a lifetime, and so
experiments-often costly ones-had to be
done instead. Now the speed of the new
machines enables us to get practical results
from the theory.
Again, in using X-ray crystallography to find
out how the atoms are arranged in various
solids, a process of trial and error is involved.
If the scientist can make certain initial guesses
correctly, then the data on the X-ray photo-
graphs can be used to calculate the positions
of the atoms. But there are often so many
choices for the first guess that the solution
is in practice beyond us ; the crystallographer
usually confines himself to cases in which some
other sort of evidence gives a strong hint on
how to start.
Now, an electronic calculator could be set
to try out all the possibilities one after another
and to stop and give a signal when it finds
the right one. In this way it could run
through many thousands of guesses in a day,
and give answers in cases which previously
could not be tackled. In these and many
other ways the new machines should help
enormously to accelerate scientific advance,
and particularly to facilitate the application of
theory to practice.
There will probably be a comparable revolu-
tion in the handling of social and economic
statistics. One of these machines (on a larger
scale than the present ones) could be fed with
all the available information about the eco-
nomy of a country, and then in a few hours it
would tell us what would be the effect of in-
creasing a particular tax or introducing new
machinery to cheapen the production of steel
screws, taking into account all the complex
ways in which such a simple change would
react on all parts of the economy. All sorts
of economic problems which are at present
tackled by hit-or-miss methods would be
brought within the sphere of reason.
But to see the full long-term implications
of these machines we need to set them in a
broader historical perspective. For some
6, 000 years or so-ever since the first cart
was harnessed to an ox or the first sailing
ship launched-men have been developing
more and more machinery for relieving them
from physical drudgery. But until very re-
cently no machine has done much to relieve
us from mental drudgery-and, let us make
no mistake, the.'brainwork"of an office rou-
tine or even the more skilled work of a com-
puter is just as much drudgery as the manual
work of a navvy.
Now machines are beginning to take over
our brainwork too-only our second-class
brainwork, of course, the parts we can reduce
to a routine, not the creative effort of the
painter, research scientist, poet or philo-
sopher. As this new trend develops, we can
foresee a world in which all uncreative rou-
tine work, all drudgery, whether manual or
mental, has been taken over by machines, and

men and women are liberated to develop to
the highest degree their creative faculties.
To end on a more sober note, it is necessary
to say that the development of these calculat-
ing monsters does not mean that the earlier
types of calculating machines will become
useless. One does not use a steam-hammer
to crack nuts (although it will do so). And
similarly there will be plenty of work still to
be done by our humbler mathematical ser-
vants, the Brunsviga, the slide-rule, the diffe-
rential analyser-and even pencil and paper.
ELECTRONIC NIGHTMARE : With more than 12, 000 e) ectronic tu. bes bui ! t into modern calculators,
failures are inevitable. That is why engineers are on permanent duty, ready to locate faulty tubes or
connections. Sometimes they can be found and replaced in a few minutes. Sometimes it takes days
to track down the failure among the 21, 000 electric relays and 40, 000 connections inside the calculator.

FEBRUARY 1952 Page UNESCO COURIER
A DOUBLE CHECK : This modern calculator is, in fact, two calculators, identical twins, each operating simultaneously yet independently, each noting
the results of the other. A disparity in results immediately causes both to stop working. The printers (foreground) recording at the rate of 24, 000
digits a minute, give a running account of the results produced, thus enabling scientists to Lfollow progress of a calculation and modify their
programme in the light of results obtained.
THE'MIRACLE I ON 57th STREET
A day in a giant computing laboratory.','
AMONG the luxurious windows of New
York's 57th Street, displaying fine
furs, expensive fashions and valuable
paintings, is a store-front that stops
every passer-by. It is a broad glass wall that
permits an impressive view of a giant elect-
ronic calculator at work. It shows a high and
spacious hall with its three other walls
solidly covered with row upon row of glowing
vacuum tubes and tiny lights flashing in swift
succession.
It seems a vision of some other and super-
human world. This calculator, this machine
that"thinks"with lightning speed and
remembers endless numbers and equations,
dwarfs the few men that sit at desks beside it
as if they were but pigmy servants of its
higher intelligence.
Timidly one steps into the hall and hears
at once the steady confused chatter of relays
and switches, sounding as if a thousand
telegraph keys were racing to spell out end-
less messages. One's first impulse is to
retreat and be lost again among the ordinary
human beings out there in the street.
But no ;. a charming young lady steps from
the mathematical altar with a welcoming
smile and bids you enter. She is hostess for
the"thinking machine,"and radiantly
human. But she is a mathematician too, and
offers to guide you and explain its operation.
Both mathematics and mathematicians have
changed since I struggled with them in
school. Improved, I should say.
She tells me that the great calculator has
by Dr. Gerald WENDT
just finished a task that has occupied it for
many months of day-and-night operation. It
was a calculation which by ordinary methods
would have taken many men countless cen-
turies-and therefore would never have been
attempted. She shows me the result : a closely
printed book of 327 pages, filled with figures
that give the correct locations in the heavens
of each of the five outer planets-Jupiter,
Saturn, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto-at 40-
day intervals for a period of 407 years, from
the years 1653 to 2060-more than a century
into the future.
The book itself contains 1, 500, 000 numbers,
many of them in ten digits. But these are
only the final result of more than 150, 000, 000
figures used in the calculation and temporar-
ily remembered by the calculator. The
operation involved over 5, 000, 000 multiplica-
tions and divisions, and more than 7, 000, 000
separate additions and subtractions of large
numbers.
This is an inconceivable number of opera-
tions in a short time. But the operations
themselves are simple. Even the ancient aba-
cus can add and subtract ; and multiplication
is merely repeated additions. The most com-
plicated mathematical calculations can be
reduced to these simple operations. And
there I found the secret of the success of this
great calculator which has neither magic nor
intelligence.
Its secret is speed. Electric impulses pass
through it with the speed of light and they
can be added one upon another with the speed
of lightning. Actually, additions or subtrac-
tions of numbers with 19 digits each can be
done at the rate of 3, 500 per second. Numbers
with 14 digits can be multiplied at the rate
of 50 per second and divided at 20 per second.
Only in its speed is it superhuman. And
that speed is made possible only by the elec-
tronic engineers who built into it 12, 500 elec-
tronic tubes, 21, 400 electric relays and 40, 000
connections that can be made, changed or
broken by electric wires and plugs. All this
is big and complicated, but not superhuman.
In one other respect it does better than
man. It can remember more. Figures obtain-
ed in one part of a calculation are retained
until they can be used in a later part. Or
they can be so recorded (on punched cards)
that they are remembered forever. But that,
too, is old. Any record put on paper is
remembered there as long as the paper lasts.
What is new is the vast capacity of this
electronic memory. No less than 400, 000
separate digits can be stored in the"me-
mory"of the calculator, ready for instant use.
The machine has colossal memory and in-
credible speed in arithmetical operations.
But it cannot think. Every operation must
be prescribed for it by the mathematicians
who analyze the problem into its parts, supply
the necessary data and instruct the machine

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 FEBRUARY 1952
A mathematical error : The'Miracle'stops dead
(Continued from previous page)
what to calculate and in what order. Far
from being the servants of the electronic
giant, they are the masters whose thoughts it
obeys. It can do only what they order.
I saw them sitting quietly at the desk, two
young mathematicians and two engineers, as
the calculator went on and on with flashing
light and chattering relays, through dozens or
thousands of operations each second. I
thought of the months of inaction ahead for
them. But suddenly there was dead silence
and the lights stopped blinking. Instantly
all four men leaped from their chairs to
various parts of the calculator. The machine
had made an error, detected it, and stopped
dead.
There must be no error, so every single
operation is done in duplicate. Indeed,
the calculator is two calculators, identical
twins, each operating independently, doing
each operation at the same moment that the
other does, and each noting the results the
other gets. For hundreds of thousands of
steps the results are identical. The instant
they are not, everything stops.
Then the mathematicians get busy to
discover in which operation the error occur-
red ; the engineers must find the tubes or
relays that were involved in that operation
and repair or replace them. With more than
12, 000 electronic tubes, failures are inevitable,
for no tube is perfect and none lasts for ever.
An average of four tubes fail each day.
Sometimes they can be replaced in a few mi-
nutes. Sometimes it takes days to locate the
faulty tube or connection.
Then part of the calculation is repeated
and the steady hum and flicker of the cal-
culation resumes, without error-but only
until the next tube burns out. So a team of
four mathematicians and engineers is on duty
at all times, 12 men for the three daily shifts.
They are, however, only part of the staff
that is required to keep the calculator at
work. Three more men are engineers for the
air-conditioning that keeps an even tempera-
ture for the calculator. The thousands of
tubes require no less than 180 kilowatts of
electric power for their operation and all this
power becomes heat in the tubes, wires and
relays. So the calculator stands in a stream
of cool air behind a glass wall. The electric
refrigeration equals the melting of more than
two tons of ice per hour.
But there is more staff. There are the two
attractive guides. There are specialists pre-
paring instructions for the operation of the

machine, days and weeks into the future.
There are the mathematicians who spend
weeks studying the next problem that the ma-
chine is to solve, dividing it into its parts,
indicating the changes in circuits and pro-
gramme that will be required.
All in all it takes 30 people to keep the
machine going. It is not surprising that the
cost of its operations is about $300 an hour.
Who can afford such a cost ? There are a
few industrial and engineering corporations
who have rented the use of the calculator for
short periods. But for the most part it works
for pure science. It is a unit of the Watson
Scientific Computing Laboratory, operated
jointly by Columbia University and the
Department of Pure Science of the Interna-
tional Business Machines Corporation. Under
their management, the giant calculator is
available without cost to scientists under
three conditions :
1. The problem must be of general in-
terest to science ;
2. The results must be published and
made available to all ;
3. The scientist or laboratory that
wishes to use it must have insuf-
ficient funds to pay for its use.
The Watson Scientific Computing Labora-
tory occupies an entire building at Columbia
University. At the University are other,
smaller and more specialized computing ma-
chines which may solve smaller or more spe-
cial problems. The entire research staff of
27 experts, under the direction of Dr. Wallace
J. Eckert, Professor of Celestial Mechanics, is
engaged in the analysis of future mathemati-
cal problems for the computers to solve, in
the training of operators for the machines,
and in the design of newer and still swifter
calculators. Here, if anywhere, are the super-
human hrains, for here the giant calculator on
57th Street was conceived and designed.
Though colossal and impressive, it is only the
product of the brainwork and vision of this
group of modest, hardworking men.

### 70986: First International Computation Centre will open this year

T first international labora-tory of the U ited Nations will
open in Italy this year.
Behind this news is a heartening
story of co-operation among coun-
tries of Europe, Asia, Africa and
South America who have pooled
their resources to make available
to all what none of them could
manage by itself. That first labo-
ratory is an International Compu-
tation Centre which will be
established in Rome to house the
enormous, intricate machines that
have become necessary in this
complicated world of today.
The convention providing for the
computation centre was drafted at
an international conference in
Paris last December. Eight coun-
tries have already signed this
convention : Belgium, Egypt, Iraq,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico and
Turkey.
The International Computation
Centre is the first of a series of
United Nations laboratories which
have been considered by scientists
from many countries since 1946.
Despite the international cha-
racter of science, there is still no
methodic organization of scientific
research on an international basis.
In the past century, it is true, a few
international scientific institutions
have been created, such as the
International Bureau of Weights
and Measures, and the Interna-
tional Time Bureau. The work of
these institutions, however, re-
mains rather limited in scope.
There are many fields of science
in which research work can only be
organized efficiently and rationally
on an international basis. This is
particularly true where research
requires complex and costly instal-
lations and highly specialized staff,
which are beyond the means of all
but the most wealthy countries.
Such is the case with modern cal-
culating machines whose work can
be of service to all branches of
science.
Again, where subjects of study
and research can only be dealt with
as a unified whole and outside the
framework of any given State, as,
for example, in the cases of
meteorology, oceanography and
astronomy, effective concentration
on an international level is essen-
tial.
Such concentration is also vital
when the importance of a problem,
or mankind's urgent need for its
solution, call for energetic and
effective action. This especially
applies to public health problems
whose solution, in the case of cer-
tain diseases, would save millions
of lives and relieve untold mental
and physical suffering.
It was for such reasons as these
and because of its interest in"the
furthering of the development, in
all sciences of research and dis-
covery which are the essential
source and stimulus of all economic
and social progress,"that the Uni-
ted Nations Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC), decided during
1946-1947 to investigate the possi-

able for proceeding with the pro-
ject (funds, staff, etc.).
4. The probable cost of the
project and the risk of its dupli-
cating the work of already-existing
research centres.
With the aid of these criteria, the
Committee recommended first
priority for three projects : Inter-
national Computation Centre,
International Institute of Research
on the Brain, International Insti-
tute of Social Sciences. It recom-
mended for second priority four

bility of establishing United Nations
Research Laboratories.
Following consultations with the
United Nations Specialized Agen-
cies, the International Council of
Scientific Unions and individual
scientists and scientific bodies in
many countries, ECOSOC decided
to form, in co-operation with
Unesco, a committee of experts to
examine and report on the ques-
tion.
This Committee, after considering
proposals that had been made for
the establishment of specific labo-
ratories, decided to establish the
four following categories of criteria
for the selection of priority pro-
jects :
1. The importance of the project
to humanity from (a) the practical
and (b) the scientific viewpoint ;
the appeal which the project would
be likely to have for the public and
for Governments ; whether results
could be expected within a reason-
able period of time.
2. The appropriateness of the
project for research on the interna-
tional level.
ratory, International Institute for
the Chemistry of Living Matter,
International Meteorological Insti-
tute.
The Economic and Social Council
considered that the project for an
International Computation Centre
deserved special consideration and
invited Unesco to prepare and
submit a detailed plan for its
creation, including recommenda-
tions as to its location, staffing,
equipping and financing.
The approval of plans for the
establishment of the Computation
Centre by the Sixth Session of
Unesco's General Conference in
July last year and by ECOSOC the
month after, enabled the Organi-
zation to call a Conference of
interested States at which the
Convention for the creation of the
Centre was signed by the repre-
sentatives of eight nations in
December.
The Conference accepted the
Italian Government's offer to house
the project in the Italian National
Research Council Building, all of
whose library and documentation
facilities will be at its disposal.
The Government has also agreed to
make the Centre a $75, 000 free-of-
interest loan for ten years.
The Centre's Member States will
contribute to its annual budget
which is expected to amount to
about 1 ; ; 100, 000, and for the first
year Unesco will make it a $15, 000
grant and a loan of $60, 000.
The three main functions of the
Centre can be summed up as
research, education and service.
First, eminent scientists and a
research staff working in mechan-
ical computation, will be able to
perfect, under laboratory conditions,
new methods of computation.
Secondly, the Centre will initiate a
training scheme by giving scholar-
ships to young research workers ;
mechanical computation is a fairly
new science, and all countries wish
to have more experts. Thirdly,
scientists, scientific institutions and
industrial firms in ratifying States
will be able to ask the Centre staff
to work out intricate calculations
needed to solve scientific and
technical problems.
The administration of the Centre
will be shared in by all those
countries wishing to participate,
through a Council on which their
representatives will serve.
While enjoying the moral and
financial support both of the United
Nations and Unesco, it will be a
self-governing institution dep-
endent only upon the States
adhering to its Convention.
The first international laboratory
should do much to meet the needs
of many countries in various fields
of science and technology. It is, in
the words of M. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of Unesco.
"an achievement beyond the means
of any single nation, but not beyond
the resources of several nations
acting together-where enormous.
intricate machines will calculate, at
inconceivable speed, the measure-
ments of a dam, the proportions of
a nuclear energy station, or the
connexion between various kinds of
population statistics, and where
research workers will painstakingly
evolve other even cleverer and
quicker machines, to be the faithful
helpers of all who work for the
common welfare of mankind."

Detail photographed on October 1, 1946. All except a slight

piece can once again be appreciated in its original beauty,
FOR many hundreds of years, man hassought ways to protect the great master-
pieces of paintings from the ravages of
time. Of all works of art, paintings-whether
on canvas, wood or plaster-are without doubt
the most fragile. Plaster flakes off, wood
rots, and canvas tears or wears away. Paints
and pigments lose their brilliance, become
grimy, crack and ultimately chip off. Even
sudden changes in temperature can cause
irreparable damage to paintings. Intense
damp or dry weather, heat, cold, smoke or
dust often have similar effects.
For long, two problems have faced art
experts : how to protect these fragile treasures
from disfigurement, and how to restore the
original éclat to a disfigured painting.
Should the damaged parts be repainted, for
example ? Some 200 years ago, many art
restorers did not hesitate to do so. But
today's experts are quick to condemn such
audacity. It is generally agreed that a
by Georges FRADIER
picture should receive a protective coat of
varnish to guard it against the attacks of the
elements, and this has been widely practiced
for many years. Unfortunately, for more than
a century, until about 1850, it was the custom
to cover pictures with a dyed varnish,
producing a uniform brownish tint. This
"gallery varnish"gave paintings an"atmo-
sphere"which then seemed more romantic.
But with the years, this varnish often
tended to go yellow and mixed with the
colours, eliminating some of them completely.
The resin varnish protected the picture, but
at the same time plunged it into shadow.
For even the most transparent varnish
darkens as the years pa. ss. Thus, a morning
sky can be transformed into a night scene.
This is exactly what happened in the case
of Rembrandt's famous masterpiece The Night
Watch, which was the subject of one of the
most extraordinary errors caused by the
darkening of the varnish of a painting.
This title, which is now confirmed by
custom, was not given to the work until late
in the 18th century, when accumulated grime
had so changed its appearance that it was no
longer possible to make out what its subject
was. There seemed to be a shadowy night
scene, shot with gleams of artificial light,
whereas Rembrandt had actually painted a
company of militia setting out on a march in
broad daylight.
When, in 1945, after lying for six years in
shelters, The Night Watch was unrolled from
its cylinder, it was found that a new canvas
was needed. Old records were consulted in
order to establish as definitely as possible the
history of the canvas since its completion by
Rembrandt in 1642. It was found possible to

draw up a chronological account containing
much information about the condition of the
picture and the treatment it had been given.
Notes discovered show that, as early as 1696,
the masterpiece underwent periodic cleaning.
One of the methods used by the painter Jan
Smit was to soak the picture from the back
with boiled linseed oil. In his Guide, dated
1758, the painter Jan van Dijk wrote that the
picture had been so plastered with boiled oils
and varnish that it was no longer possible to
make out certain details. These details came
to light only after he had removed the
varnish. He admired the brilliant sunlight.
Cleaning, revarnishing, recoating and appli-
cations of boiled linseed oil, however, succeeded
one another periodically every 30 years or so.
Repeated complaints about the deplorable
condition of the coat of varnish were made
after 1851, and from the end of the last
century, the picture was treated at more and
more frequent intervals. This treatment
consisted mainly of revarnishing with special
oils and resins-copaiba and mastic-which
became necessary every five or six years.
The history of all these successive operations
and the application of these temporary
remedies suggested that hardly any of the
original coat of varnish could have survived,
and that if the balsams, oils and resins which
then covered the surface of the picture were
removed, it would perhaps be damaged but,
at least, freed of the distortion caused by the
accumulated concoctions of several genera-
tions of restorers.
The Amsterdam museum authorities there-
fore decided that the coat of varnish should
be almost entirely removed. Today, there is
a rejuvenated painting, with the same strik-
ing luminous treatment of light and shade
which delighted the painter Jan van Dijk
when he cleaned it in 1751 and admired the
high relief of the impasto,"rough as a nutmeg
grater."
Nowadays, the conservation of pictures
nearly always involves the removal of the
varnish. And for art experts this is one of
the most difficult of problems, for every case is
not as simple as that of The Night Watch.
Is it always justifiable to remove the coats
of varnish ? Must they all be removed, right
down to the last one ? Is there not the risk
of altering the original tones in trying, some-
times arbitrarily, to impart a freshness that
the painter may not have desired ? This old
controversy has recently given rise to very
animated arguments.
There are two schools of thought. One,
which has been called that of the.'total"
cleaners, declares that all those later addi-
tions such as overpaint and coats of varnish,
whether dirty, yellow or otherwise discoloured,
give a wrong idea of the painting and of the
artist's purpose. Accordingly, if the painting
is in a suitable condition, it is, they assert,
logical and desirable to remove all such
foreign elements. They may quote the example
of such paintings as Rubens'Le Chapeau de
Paille, which was cleaned in 1946 by the
National Gallery.
This cleaning was so severely criticized, and
the Times published so many indignant
comments from art lovers, that a commission
of enquiry was set up. The experts used every
modern aid in their examination of Le Cha-
peau de Paille, as well as a number of other
paintings whose treatment had been criticized.
Their findings (the Weaver Report) expressed
complete approval of the cleaning methods
used, and added,.'There is no evidence of loss
or of any substantial deposits of extraneous
material left on the original paint."
But the.'moderates"claim to be more
prudent..'Radical methods do not produce
the theoretical result aimed at, which is to
restore the picture intact,"they say,"and do
not allow each stage in the gradual removal
of the varnish to be watched so that the
process can be stopped at the point required
by the actual condition of the picture and by
its safety."
They claim that radical cleaning does not
achieve the desired result, since it does not
restore the original picture. They point out
that, under its coat of varnish, the picture
has undergone various changes in the course
of time. Not only have the colour values
changed, but earlier cleanings, usually badly
carried out, have often caused grave wear and
tear.
Worse still, they say, total cleaning may
alter or even ruin what remains of a picture's
original condition. In addition to painting in
heavy impasto, old masters, at various
periods of history, used light, more or less
transparent coats, scumbles, glazes or even
varnishes and patination like the Italian
veZatura.
Is it certain that, in removing the varnish,
damage will not be done to the surface parts

Nations are pooling resources in the preservation of paintings
of the colour, which were designed by the
artist to play an essential part in the final
appearance of his work ?
On this score the"moderate"school also
produces its examples. When the Louvre
cleaned the Raft of the Medusa, it would have
been easy, by boldly removing the varnish, to
give the foam of the waves that clear, white
colour which, in the original sketches for the
picture, it possessed. But, in the background,
this white has been deliberately"dirtied"by
Géricault with the aid of lacquer and ochre.
The artist used this patina to add to his
linear perspective a perspective of values,
darkening for distance. If the white of the
impasto had been revealed, the result would
have been a clear distortion, flouting the
intentions of the artist and rendering his
efforts of no avail.
Such, then, were the views which their
supporters backed up with arguments involving
evidence of an historical, chemical, aesthetic
or radio-electrical order. While the radicals
stressed the importance of technical research,
their opponents laid emphasis on historical
facts as well as on the sensibility of the
restorer.
"The main thing,"said the first group,"is
to have a properly-equipped laboratory."
And the second retorted :"No one has ever
had the crude notion of substituting chemical
analyses for the wine taster ; a trained and
gifted human being has a sharpness of per-
ception which no mechanical process can ever
equal."
At this point the clash of opinions too often
led to misunderstanding and confusion, so
much so that it was felt that the problems
should be'studied in an atmosphere of co-
operation, not only in the professional sphere,
but also the international, for schools of
thought and practices showed a dangerous
tendency to become national. Thus it was
that the International Council of Museums
(ICOM) set up in 1948 a commission of experts
from a dozen countries to obtain full infor-
mation on means of conserving paintings,
with emphasis on the thorny problem of
cleaning.
When the commission held its first meeting
in London, an observer remarked that all that
seemed to separate members was"a tiny part
of a varnish coating."And in fact it was
not so much the general principle as the
extent of cleaning which was at stake.
Detailed inquiries were made, visits were
arranged to the laboratories and workshops
of the National Gallery, the Louvre and the
Istituto Centrale del Restauro in Rome. To
clear up the ambiguity of current terminology,
so often a stumbling block, the ground was
prepared for a general polyglot glossary
dealing with the conservation and restoration
of paintings.
The adoption of a general programme, the
free exchange of information and the first-
hand discussion of specific methods or cases
were the preliminary moves towards a better
understanding of these problems.
As further meetings were held-in Rome
in 1949, in Paris in 1950, and in Brussels last
autumn-a rapid decrease in misunder-
standings and prejudices was noticeable.
Even the advocates of opposite courses who,
with some exaggeration, have been called
"total"and"moderate"cleaners, today admit
that no one dreams of destroying what belongs
to the original picture and that, when in
doubt, it is best to stay one's hand, since
caution should be the first and foremost
guiding rule in cleaning. One and all seem
to accept the existence of glazes in ancient
paintings, which was unduly questioned at
one time. Also, and most important of all,
they grant that every case presents its
particular problems and that every painting
requires individual treatment.
By thus re-establishing the atmosphere of
trust and understanding so essential to any
progress, the International Council of Museums
has brought about a true international
collaboration in regard to the conservation of
paintings. One of the best examples of this
collaboration is provided by the treatment of
the polyptych Adoration of the Lamb.
During the war, this masterpiece by Jan
van Eyck, the"inventor of oil painting,"was
kept for a time at Pau, in France, and later
transported to Germany, where it was dis-
covered by the American Army in a salt mine
where Hitler and Goering stored their booty
of art treasures.
When it was returned to the Cathedral of
St. Bavon at Ghent, the ravages of time
showed so alarmingly that something had to
be done quickly if the famous masterpiece of
the Flemish School was to be saved. It was
therefore decided that it should be given
treatment at the Belgian Laboratoire Central
des Musees.
Instead of relying solely on their own know-
ledge and skill, although these had earned
them world-wide respect, the Belgian experts
decided to invite the co-operation of an inter-
national group of specialists, among whom
were museum heads from England, France,
the Netherlands, Italy and the United States,
as well as representatives of the International
Council of Museums and of Unesco.
This was an initiative without precedent.
As M. Georges Henri Riviere, present director
of ICOM, declared at that time :"For the first
time in history, a country owning an out-
standing masterpiece regards itself as trustee,
and summons to its aid some of the greatest
specialists in the world for consultation and
advice." (1)
These specialists and the Brussels experts
have now finished their task. The Adoration
of the Lamb, with its 19th century additions
removed, and treated on each side with
beeswax, is back in its chapel at Ghent
Cathedral. Innumerable masterpieces else-
where in the world, however, are in danger
and no one has thought of assembling the
proper"doctors"to treat them.
This year the Committee of the Inter-
national Council of Museums is to meet III
Lisbon to study a new problem : the conser-
vation of paintings on wood which, as a base,
can sometimes prove even more fragile than
canvas or paper. The problems of cleaning
are not, after all, the most arduous or most
complicated connected with conservation.
In any case, it is certain, as Murray Pease,
of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art,
has pointed out, that"no museum can hope
to keep up with the task of conservation in
solitary independence. The problem can be
met only by the utmost in co-operative effort,
by pooling resources, sharing technical data,
and by resolute concentration on common
fundamentals."

 THE ADORATION
OF THE LAMB
The lower panels of The Adora-
tion of the Lamb, painted by van
Eyck in 1432, as it appears when open
(below). At left was the Righteous Judges
panel, stolen in 1934. Visitors to Ghent
Cathedral, where the polyptych is hous-
ed, are chiefly interested in the
strange history of this polyptych, often
forgetting the quality of the work, and
its importance in the birth and deve-
lopment of Dutch painting. They
remember the wars, fires, thefts and
other vicissitudes which the polyptych,
now reconstituted, has survived. The
artistic value of The Adoration of the
Lamb. the learned discussions which
continue to centre around it, and the
difficulties which it has surmounted
over a period of more than five cen-
turies, have given this work a special
fame of its own, a world prestige.
Last year, a group of international
experts used modern techniques to
restore the masterpiece, which was
deteriorating rapidly due to the ravages
of time. Photo (right) shows a detail
of the upper part of the central panel.

A MODERN MARVEL :
THE ELECTRONIC
i
CALCULATOR
Until recentty, no machine has done much to relieve man from his
mental drudgery. Now machines (such as the high-speed electronic
calculator in New York shown above), are beginning to take over our
brainwork too-but only our second-class brainwork, the sort
we can reduce to a mathematics ! routine, not the creative effort
of the artist, thinker or research scientist. As this new trend
develops, we can foresee a world in which everyday routine work and
its drudgery, whether manual or mental, have been taken over by
machines. For the fascinating story of these-new machines, and
of the men who have developed them, SEE PAGES 8 TO 12.
