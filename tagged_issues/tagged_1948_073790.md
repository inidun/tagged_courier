Educators Study
School Reforms
The Eleventh International Con-
ference on Public Education,
bringing together prominent edu-
cators from forty-six nations, was
held at the Palais Wilson in
Geneva, June 28-July 3, and was
sponsored jointly by Unesco and
the International Bureau of Edu-cation.
Nearly one hundred delegates
were present at the meetings to
hear detailed reports on education-
al developments throughout the
world during 1947-48. The role of
school psychologists, the teaching
of writing and teaching regarding
the United Nations and its Spe-
cialized Agecies were also studied.
The Chairman of the Confer-
ence lWas M. Marcel Abraham,
French Inspector-General, who is
in charge of the Service for Cul-
tural and University Relations
with foreign countries, was also
head of his country's four-man
delegation. The three Vice-chair-
men were M. Georges Alexits,
Secretary of State for Public Edu-
cation in Hungary, Mr. Galen

### 73073: Child experts meet at Pestalozzi village

CHILD EXPERTS MEET
AT PESTALOZZI VILLAGE
Problems of war-handicapped
children were under study early
. this month at a Conference of
educators and psychologists from
nine nations in Trogen, Switzer-
land. The week-long meeting,
first of its kind since the war,
was sponsored by Unesco and was
attended* by some twentv dele-
, gates.
The members, including direc-
tors of children's villages, exchang-
: eoj views and experiences on thebest methods of re-integrating
child victims of the war into
normal life.Each delegate presented a re-
port of his experiences in this
field, and the combined reports
will form the basis'of & study
of war-handicapped youth to be
prepared by Unesco.
The conference held general
sessions and meetings under two
commissions. The first studied
the material organization of chil-
dren's villages, problems of staf-
fing, financing and public rela-
tions. It drew up plans for an
international cordinatmg com-
mittee which will assist in rais-
ing funds, organizing joint pur-
chases, and arranging exchanges
of staff and children, and the
"internationalising"of the vi-
llages.
The second commission inves-
tigated the content and methods
of education provided in the villa-
ges and means of re-integrating
children into normal life. These
entailed studies of social and na-
tional problems, provision of fos-
ter families, the value of psycho-
logical and psychotherapeutic
treatment and the selection of
children.
The Conference was held at
the site of the International Pes-
talozzi Village for war orphans
(see Vol. 1, No. 4 of the Courier
for a more complete story on the
village). The Pestalozzi Village,
founded in 1946 to care for child
victims of the war, has been one
of the most successful such exper-
iments.

### 74503: Museum directors gather at first World Conference

Under the Presidency of Chaun-
cey J. Hamlin, President of the
International Council of Mu-
seums, the Conference studied
problems of scientific research,
the training of museum person-
nel, restoration of paintings and
other works of art, museums for
popular education, and techni-
ques and materials for museum
exhibitions.
This was the first conference
since the war in most fields of
museum activity, and the first
international museum conference
- including all fields of museum
work-ever held. Results of the
Conference are expected to have
wide influence, especially in de-
veloping the educational value of
museums and in advancing tech-
niques in teaching with objects.
The Conference opened'at
Unesco House, and then separated
into five working sections which
met at the Ecole du Louvre, the
Musée de 1'Homme. the Musée
Pedagogique, B ; bliothèque Natio-
nale and Palais de la Decou-
verte during subsequent sessions.
Among the principal addresses
were"A Philosophy of Museum
Education,"by Dr. Charles Rus-
sell (USA),"Children's Museums"
by Miss Margaret Brayton (USA)
and"Mobile Museums"by Mr.
M. L. Ashton (United Kingdom).
The delegates also heard reports
by M. Edouard Michel (France)
who spoke of"Museums and
Scientific Research"in the field
of art, and by M. A. Leroi-Gou-

United States voluntary agen-

vastated countries during 1948,
according to a report from the

During 1947, the report added,

Help to School.
The C. I. E. R.'s report to Unesco
was drawn from statements from
some 400 national voluntary agen-
cies. A further 115 agencies which
reported the year before were so
far unable to total their funds
raised."It may therefore be as-
sumed,"the Commission reported,
"that American voluntary efforts
this year are at least keeping
pace with and are probably sur-
passing those of 1947."
Almost the whole of the total
has been or will be spent on edu-
cational materials and services.
Food, clothing and other basic re-
lief accounted for less than five
million of the 1947 figure and were
supplied solely to schools and
teacher groups.
Countries receiving the aid in-
cluded Austria, Belgium, Bulga-
ria, China, Czechoslovakia, Den-
mark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Holland, Hungary, Indo-
nesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxem-
bourg, Norway, Philippines, Po-
land and Yugoslavia.
Many contributions were made
by American individuals and in-
stitutions without using the ser-
vices of the national agencies re-
porting to the Commission. These
contributions have totalled about
eight million in value annually
since 1946.

Before an audience which in-
cluded the Czech Minister of
Foreigh Affairs, Mr. Vado Cle-

Czech Minister of Education,
Dr. Huxley stressed that although
Unesco had worked to help create
the new organization, the Insti-

He declared that the I. T. I, and
Unesco would probably draw up
a formal agreement for close
cooperation and-with the appro-
val of the Third Session of Unes-
co's General Conference-Unesco
might lend financial assistance
to the Institute during its first
crucial year. But he pointed out
that the Institute woula be an
"independant, autonomous inter-
national body".
Seated on the flower-bedecked
stage of the Grand Auditorium of
the Artists House were Professor
Jean Thomas, Assistant Director-
General of Unesco, Benjamin
Jedlicka of the Czech Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Huxley
and Mr. Maurice Kurtz, Head of
Theatre Affairs at Unesco who
handled much of the preparatory
work for the Institute.
A Force for Peace
Mr. Priestley in hiS speech
pointed out that there existed a
United Nations fund for children
and that he hoped the United Na-
tions and Unesco would ensure
that the Lot. !., a very new infant,
would also not starve.
Any international organization

one thread in the fabric of a

theatres together and to ensure
that people enjoyed the best of

### 73793: Technical needs workers report on findings

Technical Needs Workers
Report on Findings
[Editor's note : Unesco field workers have been visiting seventeen
countries throughout the world during the past months to obtain
first-hand, derailed information of the position of press, radio and
film for the Technical Needs'Commission. Philippe Soupaull, promi-
nent French author who has also edited a daily newspa, per and run
a radio station, tells in the following notes something of his impres-
ions after surveying five Caribbean countries for UneSCo. ]

name, they have acquired a kind II
of magic power.
I spoke the word as an"open :
Sesame"before the many doors
on which I knocked-and the
doors were opened.
Carrying a thick questionnaire,
I called on ministries, on trade
unions and statistical bureaux. In
asking them my hundreds of
questions, I had to overcome a
certain amount of uneasiness on
their part as they realized they
were being requested an amount
of research and compilation of in-
formation which was often con-
siderable.
I had sometimes to argue and
to stress the importance to Unes-
co's Mass Communications pro-
gramme of knowing the number
of newspapers in existence, the
size of their editions, the range
of broadcasting transmitters or
the status of the educational film.
But all the people I consulted
were extremely interested in the
results I had obtained. My com-
monest reward was to hear,
mixed with advice and explana-
tions, this kind of remark :
"You know, this information ls
really useful. It brings, out all
sorts of points which have never
before been cleared up."
To my mind. the value of the
investigation I undertook in the
countries of Central America lies
not only in the results obtained,
nor in the quality of the answers
to questionnaires and in the vari-
ous complementary notes accom-
panying them.
It is to be found also, I think,
in the person of the investigator,
which proves to governments, ins-
titutions of all kinds and to in-
individuals that, despite the
thousands of miles which lie be-
tween them and the Avenue Kle-
ber in Paris, Unesco takes an in-
terest in them, in their work, m
their needs, and in what they
have achieved.
The impression I got was that
the people I questioned were
glad to see that the nations form-
ing Unesco were concerned with
the special problems of countries,
in some cases far away in space
and time alike, from the main
international current.
I should like to thank all the
friends I met as an investigator,
who answered my questions with
such care and interest as only the
published report will fully de-
monstrate.
Indian... Pakistan...
Alexander Shaw, former film
adviser to the government of In-
dia and producer of several Bri-
tish documentaries, surveyed
Technical Needs in Pakistan and
India for Unesco. The following
are some of his impressions of
conditions in those countries :
There seems to be an enormous
potential for films in both cities
and rural areas in Pakistan.
Many films shown are of an
informational and feature na-
ture. The dances and songs of
India, with all their colour, figure
prominently in most films. The
Government made a formal re-
quest. that a Unesco-trained do-
cumentary expert be sent to Pa-
kistan to train a documentary
unit there, for only now is the
first newsreel company being
formed.
India, on the other hand, is the
second film-producing country in
the world. The three centres of
the industry are in Bombay, Ma-
dras and Calcutta where no fewer
than some 400 companies are
located.
Indian film production is in
the neighbourhood of 250 feature-
films yearly, and their average
length is nearly twice that of
Hollywood films. Although tech-
nical and photographic standards
are nearly as high as anywhere
in the world, there is little effort
to produce compJicated plots-due
probably to the fact that 86 %
of the population (340 million) is
illiterate.
Some two thousand cinemas
serve the population, showing
only an occasional foreign film,
and these few are usually Bri-
tish or American.
Italy... Hungary...
Picrrè Artigue, Belgian foreign
correspondent and radio com-
mentator, carried out the surveys
in Italy and Hungary this year
for Unesco. Here in brief are
some of his observations made
after his return to Paris.
An outstanding impression ês
that both Italy and Hungary are
making a great effort to revive
and expand their mass communi-
cation systems.
Italy is seriously hampered by
a shortage of trained personnel
and printing equipment, although
radio networks have attained
their pre-war level.
In Hungary nearly nine-tenths
of all broadcasting equipment we
destroyed during the war. Yet
because of the lack of schools,
lessons are broadcast by radio
throughout large parts of the
country.
Hungary has produced the
world's lightest typewriter (barely
six pounds) made of aluminium.
The machine is inexpensive and,
tooling now completed, it will be
placed on sale this fall.

VISITS
CENTRAL
EUROPE
Dr. Julian Huxley, Director-Ge-
neral, undertook during June a
three-week official tour of five
central and eastern European
countries to meet with govern-
ment leaders and to develop clo-
ser co-operation between Unesco
and the countries. The visit in-
cluded Yugoslavia, Hungary, Aus-
tria, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The Director-General was able
to acquaint himself with the me-
thods of teaching and research
favoured in those countries and to
note the work being done to safe-
guard the heritage of folk art and
folklore and to preserve nature.
In those countries already having
National Commissions, these were
invited to special meetings where
Dr. Huxley was able to ease their
work in the early stages by spea-
king to them in detail of the
tasks to be accomplished and of
the best methods to be used in
the light of experience elsewhere.
On other occasions, contact was
made with most eminent repre-
sentatives of the intellectual
world who will furnish the nucleas
of future National Commissions
Dr. Huxley took the opportunity
also to recruit willing aid and
expert ability in making effective
the Unesco programme, and to
encourage certain countries to
ratify their membership in Unes-
co in final form.
Wherever he went, the Direc-
tor-General was received with the
utmost warmth and was able to
measure the goodwill and en-
thusiasm with Wl1lcn Unesco's
work is welcomed.

WTHEN Occidentals ta ! k of the

of them think automatically of
Europe, some extend their
thinking to China, but few im-
mediately think in terms which
include South East Asia. The
problems of Europe are so great
and so urgent and are so con-
stantly in our minds that it is
difficult to remember the equally
great problems of countries so
remote from us geographically.
But Unesco, an international
organization, is interested in all
war-devastated countries, whether
in the West or the East and, as
soon as it was feasible, a survey
visit was arranged to five war-
devastated countries in the Far
East.
The five countries surveyed
were Burma, Malaya, Sarawak,
North Borneo and the Philip-
pines. The tour took exactly six
months, from November 6th 1947
to May 6th 1948. More than
30, 000 miles were covered, a great
many by air, approximately
5, 000 by road and 500 by river.

Canadian Campaign
For School Help'
A campaign by the Cana-
dian Council for Reconstruction
through Unesco and the Cana-
dian Appeal for Children has
raised a million dollars which
will be spent to help restore edu-
cational facilities and standards
in countries which suffered most
heavily during the war.
Allocations of the fund, which
was collected by some seventy
voluntary agencies in a nation-
wide campaign, include :
to elementary and secondary
school supplies-$300, 000 ;
ftllowships for key personnel
to follow 6-month study courses
in Canada-$182, 000 ;
to university supplies, including
books and scientific equipment-
$150, 000 ;
for book projects, including a
book exchange scheme to collect
and send overseas half a million
volumes-$66. 750 ;
to art supplies, food and cloth-

Libraries and universities In
twelve war-wrecked countries have
been allocated thirty microfilm
readers by Unesco to assist the
rehabilitation of their services. An
additional eighteen readers have
been ordeced and will be allocat-

Countries in which the receiv-
ing libraries are located include
Austria, Belgium, China, Czecho-
slovakia, France, Greece, Hun-
gary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway,
Philippines and Poland. The in-
struments, useful to libraries in
areas where books are in short
supply, were bought by Unesco in
Paris as part of its reconstruction
programme.

The Boy Scouts International
Bureau has joined the Temporary
International Council for Educa-

and, through the efforts of its
nearly five million members, will
greatly strengthen the Council's
work in war-devastated regions.
The TICER, an association of
26 international voluntary agen-

quarters at Unesco House in Paris.
Council members represent over
700 national organizations in
more than 60 countries.
Since early 1944, the Boy Scout

ed, while Jesselton, the new
capital and the only other town
in North Borneo, lost 90% of its
buildings. Manila, once a fine
modern city, now lies in ruins ;
huge girders hang from stone
buildings, streets are still scarred
with battle, the fine University
of the Philippines and many
other colleges in the city may
never be rebuilt on their old
sites.
The toll of the destruction of
school buildings in South East
Asia is enormous. The almost
total loss of school equipment
and school supplies is common to
every country, with no exception.
The loss of books alone is a
catastrophic blow to education.
In fact the story of educational
losses in South East Asia is the
story of Europe all over again.
Such science teaching as there
was, and the teaching of science
is not yet far advanced in these
countries, is now almost at a
standstill for want of any equip-
ment.
But although t) te comparison
of looses produces very similar
pictures in the East and the
West, there are some assets in
eastern countries which help
them greatly in rebuilding edu-
cation. All these countrs have
a warm climate and perhaps the
people concerned in reconstruc-
tion hardly realize how great is
their good fortune. War strain,
however severe, is easier to re-
cover from in a lWarm and
relaxing climate, and this is par-
ticularly so with children. Child-
ren's clothing is not a problem.
European mothers search des-
perately for clothing to keep
their children and themselves
warm during the winter weather.
Schools often have to close for
several months because the child-
ren have not sufficient clothing
and the schools have no heating.
In the Far East there are no
such problems and the children
wear, if anything, the minimum
of clothing.
In all the countries visited
there has always been, through-
out the war, some kind of food
for the children ; not always
enough and not always the right
kind of food. but they have
never known real starvation.
Largely due to these two bles-
sings, a warm climate and food.
there is no real problem of"war-
handicapped children"as it 18
called in Europe. When the great
cities were bombed, mothers were
able to run with their children
into the jungle or surrounding
country-side and live there.
primitively, but indefinitely. And
the fact that they never endured
hunger over a long period 18
shown by the comparatively,
good health of the children.
Many of them have skin diseases
due to malnutrition, but very few
have been crippled by bombins
or have rickets and other disease*
through starvation.
And thirdly, all these countries
have Moot !, an invaluable gift.
In Burma, for instance, almoat
all the temporary schools are
built of bamboo. Evert the fur-
niture in some of the very poor
schools is made of bamboo.
Everywhere there are temporary
school bUildings,"mat sheds"aa
they are called. They will not
last long, not more than three to
five years and they cost five
times more to erect than they
would have before the war. But
at least they provide temporary
shelter from the sun and moat
of them even keep out the
tropical rains.
The greatest problem of re-
construction of all five countries
is the problem of teachers. In
each country the position was
found to be serious, in some the
solution is hard to see.
In every country visited Unesco
received the warmest welcome.
South East Asia has suffered
greatly in the war but is making
sallant efforts towards recons-
truction with, so far, little help
from outside. They greatly need
practical help and encouragement
and deserve every appreciation or
what they have already Mcom-
pllthed.

### 73796: Social scientists issue joint statement on world tensions

Social Scientists Issue Joint
Statement on World Tensions
At the end of June, Unesco brought to Paris eight ; ; eminent
social scientists to consider the causes of nationalistic aggression
and the conditions necessary for international understanding.
The following statement, signed by each of them, presents the
opinions on which all could agree. Its significance lies in the
fact that a series of important propositions on : he causes of
international tensions have been formulated and agreed to by
social scientists widely differing in their ideological allegiances.
The following men signed the statement :
Gordon W. Allport, Professor of Psychology, Harvard University ;
Guuerto Freyre, Honorary Professor of Sociology, University of
Bah ! a, Brazil, Professor at the Institute of Sociology, University
of Buenos Aires, Argentina ; Georges GurvÍfch, Professor of So-
ciology, University of Strasbourg, France. Administrator of the
Sociological Study Centre, Paris ; Max Horkheimer, Director of
the Institute of Social Research, New York City ; Arne Naess,
Professor of Philosophy, University of Oslo, Norway ; John Rick-
man, M. D., Editor,"British Journal of Medical Psychology" ;
Harry Stack Sullivan, M. D., Chairman, Council of Fellows,
Washington School of Psychiatry, USA, Editor,"psychiatry :
Journal for the Operational Statement of Inlerpersonal Rela-
tions' ; Alexander Szalai, Professor of Sociology, Unrversity of
Budapest, Hungary, President, Hungarian Institute of Foreign
Affairs.
A.. 4 AN has now reached a
stage in his history where
he can study scientifically
the causes of tensions that make
for war. The meeting OI this
little group is itself symptomatic,
representing as it does the first
time the people of many lands,
through an international organi-
zation of their own creation,
have asked social scientists to
apply their knowledge to some of
the major problems of our time.
Although we differ in the em-
phases we would give to various
parts of our statement and in our
views as to its comprehensiveness
and implementation, no one OI
us would deny the importance of
any part of it.
We agree to the following
twelve paragraphs :
War not Necessary
(A) To the best of our know-
ledge, there is no evidence to in-
dicate that wars are necessary
and inevitable consequences of
"human nature"as such. While
men vary greatly in their capa-
cities and temperaments, we
believe there are vital needs
common to all men which must
be fulfilled in order to establish
and maintain peace : men every-
where want to be free from
hunger and disease, from inse-
curity and fear ; men everywhere
want fellowship and the respect
of their fellowmen ; the cnance
for personal growth and deve-
lopment.
(B) The problem of peace is
the problem of keeping group
and national tensions and aggres-
sions within manageable propor-
tions and of directing them to
ends that are at the same time
personally and socially construc-
tive, so that man will no longer
seek to exploit man. This goal
cannot be achieved by surface
reforms or isolated efforts. Fun-
damental changes in social
organization and in our ways of
thinking are essential.
Insecurity Fosters Conflict
(C) If we are to avoid the kind
of aggression that leads to armed
conflict, we must among other
things, so plan and arrange the
use of modern productive puwer
and resources that there will be
maximum social justice. Econo-
mic inequalities, insecurities and
frustrations create group and na-
tional conflicts. All this is an
important source of tensions
which have often wrongly led
one group to see another group
as a menace through the accep-
tance of false images and over-
simplified solutions and by mak-
ing people susceptible to the
scapegoating appeals of dema-
gogues.
(D) Modern wars between na-
tions and groups of nations are
fostered by many of the myths,
traditions and symbols of nation-
al pride handed down from one
generation to another. A great
many current social symbols are
still nationalistic, hindering the
free movement of thought across
political boundaries of what is,
in fact. an interdependent world.
(E) Parents and teachers find
tut difficult to recognize the extent
to which their own attitudes
and loyalties-often acquired
when they were young and when
conditions were different-are no
longer adequate to serve as effect-
iYe guides to action in a chang-
ing world. Education in all its
forms must oppose national self-
righteousness and strive to bring
about a critical and self-disci-
plined assessment of our own and
other forms of social life.
mass Media Strong Ally
(F) The development of mo-
dern means of swift and wide
range communication is poten-
tially a great aid to world soli-
darity. Yet this development also
increases the danger that distor-
tions of truth will reach a great
many people who are not in a
position to discriminate true from
false, or to perceive that they are
being beguiled and misled. It
must be a special responsibility
of U. N. organizations to uti-
lize these means of mass com-
munication to encourage an
adequate understanding of the
people in other countries. This
must always be a two-way traf-
fic. It will aid the cause of peace
if 1IIQ, tions are enabled to see
themselves as others see them.
(G) The prospect of a contin-'
uing inferior status is essen-I
tially unacceptable to any group
of people. For this and other
reasons, neither colonial exploi-
tation nor oppression of minori-
ties within a nation is in the long
run compatible with world peace.
As social scientists we know of
no evidence that any ethnic
group is inherently inferior.
(H) Many social scientists are
studying these problems. But so-
cial scientists are still separated
by national, ideological and clas&
differences. These differences
have made it difficult for social
scientists to resist effectively the
emergence of pseudo-scientific
theories which have been exploit-
ed by political leaders for their
own ends.
(I) Objectivity in the social
sciences is impossible to achieve
whenever economic or political
forces induce the investigator to
accept narrow, partisan views.
There is urgent need for a con-
centrated adequately, financed
international research and edu-
cational programme.
Research Necessary
(J) We recommend, for exam-
ple, the co-operation of social
scientists on broad regional and
international levels, the creation
of an international university
and a series of world institutes
of the social sciences under inter-
national auspices. We believe
that international scientific fact-
finding studies could contrlbute
useful information concerning the
cultures of all nations and bring
to light dangerous insecurities
and sources of tension, as well as
legitimate aspirations of people
all over the world. Equally cer-
tain to be rewarding are studies
of educational methods in the
home. the school, and in youth
organizations and other groups
by which the minds of the young
are oriented toward war or
toward peace. From the dissemin-
ation of the information result-
ing from these studies, we may
anticipate the emergence of con-
crete proposals for the guidance
of national programmes of edu-
cation.
(K) The physical and biologi-
cal sciences in recent years have
provided impressive demonstra-
tions of the effect of research.
Some of the practical results i
have been rather to dismay anu
disquiet the civilized world than
to reduce its tensions. The scien-
tists whose research has been
used in the development of atom-
ic and biological warfare are
not themselves responsible for
launching a curse upon the
world. The situation reflects the
forces now determining the uses
to which sciences can be put.
While other factors are concern-
ed, we hold that the chances for
a constructive use of the poten-
tialities of scientific and techno-
logical developments will improve
if and when man takes the
responsibility for understanding
the forces which work upon him
and society both from within and
from without.
Real Hope Remains
(L) In this task of acquiring
self-knowledge and social insight.
the social sciences-the sciences
of Man-have a vital part to
play. One hopeful sign to-day Is
the degree to which the bounda-
ries between these sciences are
breaking down in the face of the
common challenge confronting
them. The social scientist can
help make clear to people of all
nations that the freedom and
welfare of one are ultimately
bound up with the freedom and
welfare of all, that the world
need not continue to be a place
where men must either kill or
be killed. Effort in behalf of
one's own group can become
compatible with effort in behalf
of humanity.

J
A Report
On Tensions Meeting
IMAGINE eight experts, most of them. professors, from different ;countries and belonging to different branches of learning, several
of whom had not met before, though some knew each other well :
Would you not think that everything was set for a slow-moving and
"sticky"conference ? The organizers of it started with an experiment
- as soon as we sat down at our table each was asked to give an
account of himself (not what was on the Academic Records, but what
we had done with life). *
Four of the eight of US had
been in prison, two had to leave
their country, and two had been
tortured by the Nazis. This show-
ed a bit of what life had done
to us : and these incidents helped
to make this matter of tensions
a real one to us. Incidently we
felt after only an hour or so
that we knew a great deal about
each other and that there was
much that it was worth tolerat-
ing each other for.
Some spoke quietly as if in a
drawing room, one of us as if on

us his appeals that we think
of ourselves as Workers-yes, but
we liked him, shouting or silent,
he was so friendly and sincere.
We were a mixed lot but we
each felt the others to be of
worth as individuals, and I think
this helped us to see more deeply
into each other's way of looking
at things.
We then each made a state-
ment about our views and plans
for research, and questioned each
other about them. Then we
parted for a long week-end to
write our 5, 000 word statements
which are to come out as a book.
Now few things are so dull as 8
statements by experts. The reader
is dragged over the ground 8
separate times, it's nearly always
dreadful. We are trying to give
that book some of the lively
cross currents that occurred in
our discussions ; this is the se-
cond technical innovation of our
conference. Any contributor can
put in notes as often as he likes'
and say what he likes about the
other's statements ; no-one will be
able to get away with his
statement without being ques-
tioned, but he won't be allowed
to answer his challenger.
Our opinions range from West
to East and differ a great deal,
but we have quite a bit in com-
mon, so much so that despite
ideological differences, which
were hot and strong, we signed a
common statement.
Here is an abstract : see if
you from your experience have
much to add on broad principle
to the joint opinion of a Pro-
fessor of Psychology (I'm taking
them in alphabetical order of
their last names), of Sociology-
two of these-a Director of an
Institute of Social Research, a
Professor of Philosophy, two P&Y-
chiatrists, and another Professor
of Sociology. Here, as I said, are
some abstracts.
The problem of peace is the
problem of keeping group and
national aggressions within man-
ageable proportions and of
directing them to ends that are
at the same time personnally and
socially constructive, so man will
no longer seek to exploit man.

ways of thinking and in social
organization are essential.
We must also so plan and ar-
range the use of modern pro-
ductive power and resources that
there will be maximum, social
justice.
Modern wars between nations
and groups of nations are foster-

tions and symbols of national
pride handed down from one
generation to another.

tudes and loyal-
ties-often ac-
quired when

ditions were different-are no
longer adequate to serve as effect-
ive guides to action in a chang-
ing world.
The development of modern
means of swift and wide range
communication is potentially a
great aid to world solidarity. Yet
this development also increases
the danger that distortions of
truth will reach a great many
people who are not in a position
to discriminate true from false,

The physical and biological

Some of the practical results

forces now determining the uses
to which science can be put.
While other factors are con-
cerned, we hold that the chances
for a constructive use of the
potentialities of scientific and
technological developments will
improve if and when man takes
the responsibility for understand-
ing the forces which work upon
him and society from within and
from without.
It is a task of self-knowledge
and social insight, the social
sciences-the sciences of Man
- have a vital part to play. The
social scientist can help make
clear to people of all nations that
the freedom and welfare of one
are ultimately bound up with the
freedom and welfare of all, that
the world need not continue to
be a place where men must
either kill or be killed, and that
effort in behalf of one's own

with effort for humanity. And so
it goes on...
But you will want to know the
Action Paragraphs-what we pro-
pose should be done. These, with
the reasons why each one was
put forward (without the reasons
they carry little weight) will ap-
pear in that book.
Now, that first statement in my
view is not the most important
product of the Conference. We
were, above all, experimenting
(again it is my view) with the
technique of conferring-I rather
fancy that's about as important
a job as any in these days.
I don't only refer to meetings
of Foreign Ministers and that
sort of thing-take the case of
the last Committee you yourself
attended. Would you not like to
know more about what really
went on ? Did the Agenda really
cover it, or the Resolutions ?
No ? And by the way, one of
my proposals is a study of the
reporting of conferences.

### 73800: 1948 working programme set for Amazon Institute

1948 WORK ! NO PROGRAMME
SET FOR AMAZON INSTITUTE
 >&lt;.  By Dr. Frank J. Malina
HEADQUARTERS COORDINATOR
HE programme of Unesco's Hylean Amazon Project for theremainder of 1948 following the conclusion of the Iquitos Con-
ference in Peru and the meeting of the I. I. H. A. Interim Com-
mission at Manaus has been. formulated. This program, directed
toward the final preparations for the opening of he I. I. H. A. in 1949,
can be divided into two major parts-administrative planning and
research planning.
In Latin America the imple-
mentation of this program is
carried out by the Secretariat of
the Interim Commission whose
headquarters are in Manaus, the
Brazilian city selected as the seat
of IIHA.
The staff of the secretariat for
1948 has been provided by Unesco
and an agreement made with the
Interim Commission that this
staff will carry out functions de-
fined by the Interim Commis-
sion on the one hand and by
Unesco on the other. These func-
tions are complementary and
have as a common objective the
'initiation of the work of the Ins-
titute on a sound basis at the
earliest possible date in 1949.
Administrative Pwnning
Thf administrative planning
now underway covers a diverse
number of subjects. Recommen-
dations are being drafted to cover
financial regulations incorporat-
ing provisions regarding the
currency in which the contribu-
tions of Member States of the
Institute shall be payable, the
reserve or revolving fund to be
established and the proceaures
for financial administration. Staff
regulations for personnel of the
Institute and rules of procedure
for the Council and the Executive
Committee will also be drafted.
A report is being prepared to
serve as a basis of a special con-
vention on the privileges and
immunities of the IIHA with
special reference to the problem
of scientific collections to he
made by the Institute within the
jurisdiction of the Member
States.
At the Iquitos Conference'he
area. of the Hylean Amazon to
he served by the Institute was
not finally defined, and therefore
the Interim Commission was ins-
tructed to take steps, in conjunc-
tion with the countries in the
region, to specify the area. wa-
tered by the Amazon and its tri-
butaries that can be considered
to have the same biological cha-
racteristics. The map reproduced
on this page shows a tentative
outline of the Hylean Amazon.
together with the seat of the Ins-
titute at Manaus (Brazil) and the
working centers that are to be
developed at Archidona (Ecua-
dor), Belém do Parà (Brazil),
Iquitos (Peru), Riberalta (Boli-
via). San Fernando de Atabapo(Venezuela) and Sibundoy (Co-
lombia).
Each of the States Members of
the Institute are to set up nation-
al bodies for tile maintenance
of relations between their respec-
tive national governments and
the institute, and for the encour-
agement of the study and deve-
lopment of their national sectors
in accordance with the integrated
work programme of the Ins-
titute for the whole region.
One of the important articles
of the IIHA Convention provides
for cooperation with public and
private organizations engaged in
work related to the purpose and
functions of the Institute. To
this end contact is being made
with these organizations, espe-
cially with the Specialized Agen-
cies of the U. N such as the FAO
and WHO, which are especially
interested in the agricultural, con-
servation and health problems of
this vast tropical region. The
relationships between the IIHA
and these intergovernmental or-
ganizations will be built up
without the intermediary of Uses-
co. Coordination of the activities
of the U. N. Specialized Agencies
in the Hylean Amazon will be
achieved through already estab-
lished procedures between the
Specialized Agencies.
Research Planning
It has been realized that it is
not possible to project a research
program for the Institute into
the distant future except in
broad outlines. Of immediate
concern is the definition of the
Institute's program for its first
year of operation, for which the
Iquitos Conference set a budget
of approximately $300, 000.
To assist with these prepara-
tions Unesco has initiated three
surveys to guide the formulation
of the recommendations of the
Interim Commission to the first
Council meeting of the Institute.
One of the basic principles of
modern research requires a sur-
vey of work done by researchers
in the past and now underway
on problems of interest, in order
to avoid unnecessary repetition
and duplication of effort. To this
end a bibliographical index is
being put in hand which will co-
ver available published and ma-
nuscript knowledge on Amazonic
problems.
The scope of the program of
the IIHA encompasses both the
natural and social sciences. In
the field of social anthropoMgy.
the Hylean Amazon region offers
numerous opportunities for signi-
ficant research on man. The ex-
ploratory community study being
carried out at present in the
lower Amazon is described in a
separate article on this page.
At Iquitos the Scientific and
Program Committee of the Con-
ference strongly recommended
that Unesco, as a part of its acti-
vities during 1948, make an expe-
riment with a"team"survey of

Lima the first week of July

This team 01 scienlific specia-

three months collecting inform-
tion for an integrated report on
the characteristics and potentia-
lities of the valley.
At the close of 1948 Unesco
will have concluded its role of
bringing the IIHA into being. In
1949 the States Members of the
Institute will finance the major
portion of the activities of the
Institute and Unesco will make
arrangements to have studies
made by the Institute for the
purposes of its future program
wIthin its budgetary means.
Thus Unesco, through its good
offices in bringing together va-
rious nations at Iquitos, Peru, de-
monstrated once again how inter--
national co-operation is possible
when a specific objective of
common interest to d1verse peoples
is chosen.
Among the few Amazon industries are weaving and pottery making.

### IGNORE

Some Press
Comments
Probably no other singe
Unesco project, has attracted
such widespread public inter-
est as the establishment of the
International Institute of the
Hylean Amazon. The follow-
ing are excerpts from a few
typical articles published dur-
ing the past weeks.
Peter van Dresser in the
"Scientific American" :
"'... The Amazon offers a vir-
gin laboratory in which the
sciences and social techniques
of our civilization, perhaps
grown somewhat more mature,
may try their skill. The stakes
in this effort are the opening
up of a land very nearly the
size of the United States-and
at least equally endowed in
natural niches..."
"La Cronica", Lima, Peru :
"... This is the first time that
such an expedition has been
undertaken under the ausrpices
of a world organization and
the Peruvian Government, with
useful scientific resources at its
disposal... Our vast hydra-
graphical regions hide huge
resources to be used by matt.
On this operation are based
the best hopes of a subsequent
work in order to justify the
aims of this great enterprise."
The"New Review" (Cal-
cutta) :
"The blueprint for the open-
ing of the Amazon... marks
the beginning of perhaps the
most ambitious of internatio-
nal scientific endeavours... The
long'orange aspects of the huge
project concern the civiliz-
ing and settlement of the
Equatorial vastness. which

the promotion of communica-
tions by Mater, land and air
across the now almost im-
penetrable reaches along the
world's greatest river."
The Brantford (Ontario,
Canada)"Expositor" :
"There is the promise of un-
disclosed resources through
making accessible regions
blocked off for untold centu-
ries by impenetrable forests.
There is the thrill of high
drama in this undertaking.
More important, it holds the
possibility of substantial im-
provement in the life of the
people of South America and,
ultimately, the world at large."

"initiating methods of interna-

give the people of all countries
access to the printed and publish-
ed materials produced by anv of
them."
To fulfil these aims, Unco hay
developed the following methods
in the field of the natural scion-
ces :
Grants-in-aid : A grant-in-aid Is
an outright pavment to a non-
governmental or semi-governmen-
tal international organization in
furtherance of Unesco's constitu-
tional objectives and general pro-
gram of work, for purposes spe-
cified in each case, and without
financial return.
A grant-in-aid may be awarded
to give"assistance to internation-
al organizations for initiating
and operating facilities for the
world-wide pooling and co-ordina-
tion qf already-acquired know-
ledge, the promotion of cultural
interchange, the standardization
of terms, techniques and appara-
tus ; the maintaining and ex-
changing of living samples and in-
animate objects ; and the upkeep
of laboratories and other institu-
tions under international control,
by means of grants for interna-
tional education, scientifie and
cultural institutions and bureaux.
It is understood that no grants
so given may be devoted to the
expenses of original research of
creative activity being carried out
in a country by citizens of that
country in public or private insti-
tutions financed by governmental
or private funds of that coun-
try".
Contracts : This is an arrange-
ment under which Unesco makes
a payment to an educational,
scientific or cultural organization
for the fulfilment, at Unesco's re-
quest, of a task, service, or pur-
pose specified in each Mse and
closely linked with the Prramme
of Unesco as approved by the
General Conference.
Contracts"may be concluded
with non-governmental or semi-
governmental international orga-
nizations which have been grant-
ed consultative status for :
1) the organization of interna-
tional conferences, congresses,
symposia, expert committees, etc. ;
2) the organization of the Ex-
change of Persons'programme
through promotion and adminis-
tration of travel grants, fellow-
ships, etc. ;
3) the execution of surveys, in-
vestigations or other studies ;
4) the preparation and public-
tion of periodicals. books or other
material ;
5) the development of new in-
ternational organization'.
From a careful study of the
above rules it will be seen that
only under exceptional circum-
stances can Unesco funds be said
to be directly involved in original
scientific research.
Scientists and engineers, when
they join the Unesco Secretariat,
leave their instruments and slide
rules behind. They only carry
with them a knowledge of the
scientific method, a familiarity
with some of the implications of
science in the modern world, and
a faith that relations between
peoples can be improved.

### 73802: Social studies planned of Amazon peoples

SOCIAL STUDIES PLANNED
OF AMAZON PEOPLES S
By Dr. Charles Wagley
[Dr. Charles Wagley, Columbia University anthropologit, and
Dr. Eduardo Galvao of Brazil are carryiufJ out, under, the auspices
of the Unesco Hylean Amazon Project, a communit1/study in the
lower AmazOn region in Brazil. The survey will aid in the formation
of a research programme to be carried out in other areas of the
Amazon basin by th< ! recent/y'e5tablished I. I. H, A. Before leaving for
Brazil, Dr. Wagley made the following observations regarding research
in that part of the world. ],
THE tropical environment, thepeculiar historial development
offer unusual circumstances for
social and natural sciences.
Such research should focu on
man and his past, present and
potential adjustment to the Ama-
zon environment. To study t..'1is
general problem, it will be neces-
sary to call upon many scientists
with a variety of specialities. Bo-
tanists must study the plants
which are used now, which have
been used by the Indians in the
past, and which may be useful
to man in the future.
Soil experts must furnish us
with an analysis of the earth
from the point of view of present
and future agricultural produc-
tion, and agronomists must tell
us what is good and bad about
the present techniques of tilling
the soil and must seek new me-
thods for greater and more effec-
tive production.
Nutritionists will study the
vitamin, mineral and energy con-
tent of Amazon foods and will
tell us what foods are appro-
priate for the Amazon. Physiolo-
gists will study the energy output
and other physiologically deter-
mined reactions of man under
Amazon conditions. Each science
has a definite contribution to
make to this general prouiem.
By focusing on the problem of
man in relation to the Amazon
environment we do not limit the
number of scientists and sciences
which would participate in the
program, but at the same time
we do not try to work toward an
encyclopedic knowledge of the
Amazon without the benefit of a
limiting problem.
In such a program, one of the
first steps would seem to be a
study of the contemporary cul-
ture, or way of life, of the pre-
sent population of the Amazon
Valley.
Three racial stocks have con-
tributed to the contemporary
Amazon population, and the mo-
dern culture contains elements
inherited from Portugal or Spain,
from Africa, and from the Ame-
rican Indian.
Newcomers to the Amazon are
soon forced to adopt many
caboclo customs and habits. Fur-
thermore, any social planning
must take into consideration the
habits, values, customs, beliefs
and in general the organized way
of life of the people who are
there.
Therefore, the problem of the
social anthropologists in coopera-
tion with other scientists in the
Amazon would seem to be two de-
vast uninhabited territory, and the
of the Hylean Amazon region
research in many disciplines of the
termine the basic patterns ut me
present culture and to be able
in the future to advise social
planners as to the feasibility of
programs of change in this re-
gion. Like the physiological orga-
nism, human culture has envy-
ronmental limitations and envi-
rorunental reactions, and It must
be handled with care.
In order to determine the basic
culture of the Amazon region,
studies will have to be made by
social anthropologists in several
Amazon communities within the
next few years.
In making these studies the
following major points must be
covered :
1) History of the region ;
2) Sustenance and basic eco-
nomy (agriculture, fishing,
collecting of forest products,
commercial system, etc.) ;
3) Diet and Food habits (objec-tive stu y f food consum d,
food taboos, preparation of
foods, cost, etiquette, etc.) ;
4) Social Life (education, fa-
mily life, social position and
prestige, social classes, clubs,
religious organizations, neign-
bourt100d groups, municipal
and community solidarity,
etc.) ;
5) The Individual Life (birth
child training, courtship,
marriage, relations between
the sexes, old age, death and
mourning, etc.) ;
6) Religious Life (church orga-
nizations, religious festivals,
cults, mythology and folk-
lore, etc.).
The arrow is still the main weapon for hunting in the Hylean Amazon
Region.

ence, its surveys, and its confer-
ences, has already done fine work
m the field of educational re-
ge6u'ch. However, these activities
can usefully be supplemented by
unesco's more practical pro-

Mr. Piaget, Director of the In-

agreed with Dr. Beeby that im-
portant results could emerge from
close Unesco-IBE co- {) peration.
I'in the field of education", he
said,"example should play a mare
important role than compulsion. I
am convinced that solutions suit-
able to the different conditions
obtsinir_g in the various countries
tthould be studied, without any
attempt to impose a uniform sys-
term",
The Conference then heard re-
ports of educational developments
in various countries during the
past year. Questions followed and
øome of the most interesting
points mentionned were these :
Australia.-The school leaving
ege was 15 in New South Wales
and Victoria and the possibility of
prolonging school attendance un-
taL that age in other States was
being examined... besides the State
colleges for training in academic
sttbjects, the secondary education
system included special schools
tor agriculture, trades, etc... a new
riment is being carried out in
J1rses for immigrants.
Belgium-Holiday parties for
lrOrkers are a new experiment for
tbð spare time and holidays of
\9OUDg workers... school broadcast-
ing is organized differently in the
Walloon and Flemish parts of the
country-it was independent of the
Ministry of Education... medico-
pedagogic centres are being
organized in Brussels, Borinage
IDd near Antwerp.
Burma.-8eventy per cent of
the population can read and write,
due largely to the traditional edu-
cation provided in Buddhist mon-
asteries... the education of adults
is being carried out by broadcast
courses and with the help of the
Ypung People's Associations... lang-
uage instruction is difficult be-
cause there are one hundred and
twenty differents dialects.
Bulgaria.-Forty-five per cent
at university students have schol-
arships... illiteracy has been redu-
ced to fourteen percent... education
is obligatory to the age of fif-
teen... primary school teachers are
trained for two years ; secondary
teachers must first attend a uni-
versity.
France.-School reforms have
8Ct far affected pupils between the
ages of twelve and fifteen... tradi-
tional methods are so far being
retained for students above that
age... the experiment of the"New
Classes"had been carried out
this year at the level of the 4th
grade... a training course held for
teachers in charge of the direction
of the new classes had continued
its creative development particu-
larly as regards the co-ordination
of teaching, the study of environ-
ment and the part played by
artistic, plastic, or musical train-
ing.
At subsequent sessions, delegates
exchanged views on the Teaching
of Handwriting, School Psycholo-
gists and on the various problems
concerned with teaching about the
purpose and the work of the
United Nations. A Chinese speaker
suggested the creation of an in-
ternational documentation centre
regarding the UN and its Agen-
cies, and stressed that"much
courage and faith"would be ne-
cessary to overcome the cynicism
and disillusionment of those who
iII4 not bzlieve in such teaching.
. French delegate urged that it
was necessary to demonstrate that
there were three fundamental re-
requirements for international
peace : mutual assistance between
the nations, the surrender of some
degree of national sovereignty by
each country and the organiza-
tion of collective security.
A speaker from Brazil pointed
to the survey Unesco had carried}
out among its Member States re-j
garding their progress in develop-,
ing teaching programmes about
the United Nations."Unesco en-
countered several kinds of obsta-
cles", he said,"some of these were
moral, due to the scepticism with
which the United Nations was
viewed".
Reports received on educational
developments in the countries re-
presented will be published, as
also will the Conference's recom-
mendations on Teaching of Hand-
writing ; School Psychologists ; and

To the Editor of the Unesco

.'... j.
Sir :
The Unesco Courier pu-
blished in its June numoer
(vol. 1, No 5) an interesting
article entitled'Work-Plan
for Germany'.
I would like to point out
that the'Federation de 1'Edu-
cation Nationale', whose Gene-
ral Secretary, M. Adrien La-
vergne, is a member of the
French National Commission
for Unesco, has given a good
deal of attention to the re-
education problem of German
youth.
A survey was made in all
four zones of occupation, in
June-July 1947. by a aeteKa'
tion of our Federation. This
delegation of seven members
was lead by Mile Mane-louse
Cavalier, permanent expert of
Unesco's Education Section at
the French National Commis-
sion and member of the tem-
porary Council of the interna-
tional voluntary organizations
dealing with Education, Scien-
ce and Culture.
The results of our survey
have been published in a re-
port of 300 pages entitled'AI-
lemagne 1947'. This book was
printed by the `society Uni-
I versitaire d'Edition et ue Li-
I brairie' (Sudel).

### 73803: I.T.I.: a liaison centre for theatres the world over

Maurice Kurtz, author and play-
right, has been closelv associated
with preparations for the Inter-
national Theatre Institute since
the idea took tangible form in
1946. In the following article, he
explains something of the Insti-
tute's. purpose and something of
what it may accomplish.
THE International Theatre Institute is the newest organization onthe scene of international art. With its creation comes to a close
the two-year production-rehearsal period which focussed upon it the
attention of theatre artists, technicians and administrators the world
over.
It is an exciting experience to help transform into a living reality
the inevitably cold, conventional words of a conference resolution :
"It was resolved to call an international meeting of theatre
experts for the purpose of founding an International Theatre
Institute..." (First General Conference of Unesco, Nov. 1946,),
Many months of preliminary investigation and study went into
the early stages of the I. T. I., giving it its raison d'etre and the
concreteness which earned for it the active guidance of J. B. Priest-
ley, the enthusiasm and support of Armand Salacrou. Jean-Louis
Barrault, Clarence Derwent, Tyrone Guthrie and a host of others :
. professionals, amateurs, public.
A first"reading"of the lost. !.
took place last July when Unesco
invited twenty-five theatre experts
from fourteen countries in Eu-
rope, Asia. North and South
America, to decide for or against
"production".Within a few days, these busy,
practical-minded theatre folk put
together a programme aimed at
lowering, if not eliminating, the
obstacles which interfece with the
international movement of new
playscripts, opera and ballet
scores, performing companies. and
of the various types of informa-
tion leading to increased and
better professional relations be-
tween theatre circles of all coun-
tries, and therefore, between the
people of all countries who flock
to their theatres.
In the past year since the July
1947 Conference, I have had occa-
sion to learn with what genuine
eagerness many countries look to
the establishment of the I. T. I. In
fact, twelve of them have given
concrete proof of this by consti-
tuting national centres :
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile,
China, Czechoslovakia, France,
Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland,
United Kingdom, U. S. A.
Other countries, such as. : Argen-
tina, Bolivia, Denmack, Ethiopia,
Greece, Norway, the Netherlands,
Poland, Sweden, Uruguay, New
Zealand and the Philippines are
in various stages of organization
of their national centres.
The importance of these con-
tres, springing up like guideposts I
on all continents, has not yet be·n,
fully appreciated. For it is an
entirely new idea in the arts to
organize a precise, all-year theatre
programme whose object is to
serve the stage and its world
everywhere.
The Central headquarters is a
convenient tunnel, a clearing-
. house, if you prefer, but in any
case, not The Thing itself. Any
other view, I believe, would be
pretentious and unrealistic,
In other words, the I. T. I, s job
is to help each nation make
known, honestly and effectively
and quickly, its best theatrical
products : spoken, musical, ballet.
dance, amateur, puppets, etc...
The former Société Universelle
du Theatre made an admirable
between-the-wars attempt to
achieve a solid footing in inter-
national theatre, but met with
the insurmountable indifference
inherent to its day.
Now that many more nations
are convinced that man's happi-
ness on earth is inseparably
linked to good international con-
duct, this fresh and more mature
understanding of world problems
gives the I. T. I, a. better chance

will be held in England during
September, 1H<.
Some fifty working librarians,
drawn especially from war-devas-
tated countries, will come together
to study library techniques and
equipment during the month-long
meetings. Close cooperation in
sponsorship of the school is being
rr. aintained with the International
Federation of Library Associa-
tions.
Mr. Raymond Irwin, Director Of
the School of Librarianship, Uni-
versity Collee, London, will direct
the school which will be held suc-
cessively in London and Manches-
ter. Choice of participants win be
made by Unesco National Com-
missions or Co-operating B dies
in the member states of the ora-
nizalion and by library associa-
tions.
There will be lectures by the
school's own faculty and by addi-
tional lecturers. Also included
will be demonstrations, discussion
groups, visits to libraries, exhi-
bitions of equipment and of
documentary films. Each stu-
dent will be expected to bring a
written account of public library
development in his or her own
country.
Librarians who may wish to at-
tend the school should contact
their national library association
or their Unesco National Com-

Following the opening ad-
dresses. the Congress went into
working session. It agreed to
110ld twice-daily meetings during
the six-day conference, and the
proposed Charter for the Insti-
tute was immediately adopted
subject to latex committee revi-

In the afternoon session. J. B.
Priestley was elected President
of the Congress, and Armand Sa-
lacrou-the distinguished French
playwright and head of his coun-
try's delegation-and Jmanch.
Honzl were elected Vice-Presi-

Three Committees were then
appointed, including one of orga-
nization, headed by Mr. Emil
Oprecht, President of the Asso-
ciation of Swiss Theatre Dn^ec-
tors. A Committee of Informa-
tion was headed by Dr. Yul
Shang-Yuen. of the National
Academy of Dramatic Arts in
Nanking, and a Committee on
Theatre Artists Abroad was led
by Dr. Arnold Szyfman, founder
and Director of the Polski Thea-
tre in Warsaw.
The Committee on Organiza-
tion recommended the establish-
ment of a National Theatre Cen-
tre in each Member-State.
The Committee on Information
emphasized that the National
Centres should compile lists of
all existing endowments, official
and unofficial, for foreign thea-
trical students within their coun-
tries. and should do everything
possible to promote the interna-
tional exchange of persons in
that field.
The Committee of Theatre Ar-
tists Abroad urged the National
Centres to call on their govern-
ments to reduce the obstacles
which block and hinder the free
movement of theatrical produc-
tions and companies from one
country to another.
Following the Committee work,
the Congress elected an eight-
man Executive Committee with
Armand Salacrou as its Chair-
man. Other members included :
Erich Nikowitz, prominent actor
. at the Josefstadt Theatre in
Vienna ;
Maurice Huisman, Director of
the National Theatre of Belgium ;
S. I. Hsuing, Chinese author

### 73804: Close links traced between early Greek/Syrian cultures

Close Links Traced
Between Early
Greek=Syrian Cultures
VER since its foundation one of Unesco's principal objects has
IL been to demonstrate to the nations that they do not exist in
isolation and to induce in them a. certain unity of spirit by
reminding them that civilizations, so far from being closed systems
evolving independently, are mutually accessible and enrich each
other by exchange.
were known to West-
ern thought, however
imperfectly, long be-
fore Europe could
make direct contact
with them at the time
of the Renaissance.
In thus passing on
the fruits of Hellenic-'"...wis'uuiii, mmtuc',. ii
the intellectual history of hu-
manity, were the agents of that
"historic continuity.. which is one
of the major achievements of mo-
dern science. Yet those who no-
tice dates cannot have failed, in
reading the previous article, men-
tioned above to be struck by a- break in that continuity.
Between the closing of the phi-
losophy schools of Athens, de-
creed by Justinian in 529 A. D.,
and the Arab renaissance, which
flowered in Baghdad in the se-
cond half of the Eighth Century,
more than two centuries passed,
during which time the Maslem
world was fully occupied in con-
quering the Mediterranean basin.
It had neither time nor occasion
to take much interest in the
"wisdom of the Ancients, ulumal-awa'il", from which Islamic
orthodoxy at first tended rather
to recoil.
What them during these two
: centuries was the fate of Greek
thought ? Who kept it alive ? The
Syriac-speaking Christians of
Mesopotamia.
Singular Universities...
Christianity appeared very
early in Mesopotamia. The point
from which it first spread was
the little kingdom of Osrohene,
y whose capital Edessa (now Urfa)became officially Christian at
the end of the Second Century.
From this ancient centre of Se-
mitic culture, little affected by
- Hellenization, from which it was
protected by its language, Syriac,
akin to Aramaic and Hebrew,
Christianity spread through all
the lands watered by the Tigris
and Euphrates.
On the Fifth Century theologi-
cal disputes concerning the na-
ture of Christ gave rise to schism.
The Persian churches adopted
the Nestorian belief (today repre-
ænted by about 100, 000 faithful
dwelling around Lakes Van and
Urmiah), while those of Upper
Mesopotamia embraced the doo-
< (1) cr. the Arab Cultural Beritare ;
'Yol I, No. 3, April 148
One of the dearest proofs of
this truth is the historic example
þf the contacts between Arab
Mind Western civilization, of which
an account was given to the rea-
ders of the Unesco Courier (1 ;
in connection with Unesco's nexb
meeting at Beirut. At a time
when the dominant idea of man-
kind was religion, could there be
two worlds more in opposition
than the Islamic and the Chris-
'Üan, eachhaviDg a different
concept of the Godhead and each
regarding the other as pagan
and idolatrous ?
Yet those two worlds did not
remain in ignorance of each
other ; they lived side by side
from the time when the sons of
the Prophet occupied all the peri-
phery of the Mediterranean. From
their frequent contacts, Europe
gained material wealth and in-
tellectual concepts which we use 
daily almost without realizing it.
The most important element of
this legacy from the Arab to the
Western world is without any
doubt the intellectual element
consisting of the sum of know-
ledge inherited from Greece and
transmitted to Mediaeval Europe
through the Arab scientists and
philosophers of Spain. Encyclo-
paedic intellects such as Avicenna
(Ibn Sina, 980-1037), Averroes
(Ibn Raschid), Atempace (Ibn
Badja, 1138), as versed in phy-
sical science as in metaphysical
speculation, transmitted to the
Latins the richest treasures of
Greece in science and philosophy.
Thanks to them Euclid, Archi-
medes, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Ga-
len, Aristotle and Plato
trines of Jacobite Monopnysism.
It was in these surroundings,
traditionally closed to Greek in-
fluence alike by language and by
political and geographical situa-
tion, that classical culture was
kept alive. Syrian converts to
Christianity had to learn Greek
to read the Old and New Testa-
ment and the writings of the Fa-
thers, and this introduced them
simultaneously to science and
philosophy.
From the Fifth Century
onwards there was a veritable
positive outburst of phil-HeIIe-
nism, whose principal centre was
the Persian School set up at
EdeS5a and later at Nisibe and
Gandishapur in Iran. In these
singular schools, where thousands
of students lived cloistered like
monks and which might be deem-
ed the first univet'sities since
the disappearance of the schools
of Alexandria, Athens and Per-
gamos, there was taught, in addi-
tion to strictly ecclesiastical learn-
ing, all the science of Greece.
Verbal teaching was backed up
by a vast labour of translation.
Works on dialectics, logic, astro-
logy and medicine were rendered
from Greek into Syriac. The
manuscripts which contain them
aJ"e today the ; richest treasure of
the great libraries of London,
Paris and the Vatican, and some
of them date from the Sixth
Century.

by the Arab invasion
reduced this activity"
little, but did riot en-
tirely suppress it, par-
ticularly among the
estorians. Though the
first successors of the
Pt'ophet retained his
simple way of life, op-
posed to all material
civilizatton and ail'worldly learn-
ing, the Ommeyads, established at
Damascus from 660, converted
Islam into a centralized temporal
State, with an army of official
recruited principally from Greek
and Syriac-speaking Christians.
Soon the Court of Damascus took
on the appearance of a Byzan-
tine Court in an Arab country.
The revolution of 750, whence
sprang the Abbassid Caliphate,
accentuated in Islam this ten-
dency towards a political system
along the lines of oriental des-
potism. In Baghdad, founded by
AI Mansur in 762, the Caliph be-
came as it were a reincarnation
of the Sassanian King of Kings.
Like him, he had his harem, his
gardens, his hunting, a sump-
tuous palace, in which were piled
the treasures and the arts of
Central Asia, the Indies and even
China.
Against this fabulous back-
ground, worthy of the Arabian
Nights, there moved a brilliant
Court, where pleasant living was
inconceivable without the pleas-
ures of the mind. Poets were wel-
comed there. It was there that
primitive Arab poetry, rude and
warlike, gave birth to Court poe-
try, flexible and playful,"tight
as the tracery of the Athambra".
There, too, philosophic throught
took wings, exploring problems
undreamt of by the first readers
of the Koran. And it was this
atmosphere of intellectual enqui-
ry that the works of Greek anti-
quity were translated from Syriac
into Arabic.
The part played by Syriac-
speaking Christians, whom mem-
bers of Unesco will find at Bei-
rut represented by the Maroni : es
of the Lebanon, in no way de-
tracts from the importance of the
Arab world in transmitting the
Greek heritage. Without it, the
vast labour accomplished by its
teachers, the Syrians of Mesopo-
tamia, would have rested a dead
letter, hidden in a tongue hardly
known in the West before the
16th Century Renaissance.

of nations and to share with
all other peoples the treasures of

The Chinese National Commis-
sion, first organized in August,
1947, has 120 elected members,
leaders in the fields of education,
science and culture. Divided into
six committees, each representing
one of the major fields of Unesco
activity, the Commission is head-
ed by Dr. Chu Chia-Hua, Minister
of Education. Its purpose is to
make effective the programme of
Unesco in China.
Reviewing the activities of
China in recent years towards in-
ternational understanding and co-
operation, Dr. Cheng referred to
developments in each of the six
programme fields.
In the field of Fundamental
Education, he recalled, Unesco
and China had jointly called a
Regional Conference (September,
1947), bringing together experts
from the entire Far East and
Pacific areas to discuss common
problems and to develop techni-
ques and materials in mass educa-
tion. China was also developing,
in close co-operation with Unesco,
a"pilot project"to try out me-
thods in bringing a basic mini-
mum of education and commun-
ity living to under-privileged
peoples.

Some Historic Elements
of Persian Painting
As a World Influence
JIiìERSIAN painting is a new discovery for Westerners and perhapsI even to some extent to the Persians themselves, When in 1910
the Germans held an exhibition of Persian art in Berlin the
appreciative eyes of a great many people were turned towards it,
especially when the Impressionists and the Expressionists had already
widened the scope of their perception. Since then the French and the
English have shown their interest in Persian art either by hOlding
similar exhibitions or have attempted to study the subject itself.
Persian painting is in its essence romantic. In its fully matured
stage it possesses a delicate touch of reality. This appeared towards
the end of 15th century and continued throughout 16th, when Behzad
of Herat, the master artist of Timur's court brought the sense of
movement, after the manner of Chinese, to his paintings.
He developed tne cnaraCLenz,,-
tion of his figures, introduced
landscape and released the art
from the restriction of beag mere-
ly illustrations of texts. Rich
blue and gold background became
generally accepted as the condi-
tion and the carefully coloured
red background, which prevailed
for a century if not abandoned
was skillfully moderated to new
fashion.
The art of the age draws the
season of gaiety where you have
the element of spring even in
your summer and winter, where
it is a love-scene or a battlefield,
a silver-like brightness is over the
white-flowers and the
leaves are ornamented
with shining diamonds.
Day and night are
often equally bright,
rocks are risen to meet
the blue sky, and little
brooks are rippling
while grass shoots up
in tender growth.-...,..--
The element of space
is reduced only to a fantasy and
everything is brought under your
eyes. A distant tree in the Euro-
pean art remains remote always,
lost and insignificant and its
values merely lie in the atmo-
phece which it creates in relation
to the main theme. This is the
normal attitude of the European
painter and shows strict fidelity
to nature.
But to the Persian artist a tree
or a figure behind the object is
always large and fascinating In
itself so that is shows a value
equal to that of the main theme.
This is held among, many reasons,
to belong to the creative and the
free spirit of the artist who looks
at nature purely from the ange
of his own imagination. But
there is a strong influence of
Chinese here, the fact that the
spectator is placed at the point f
vantage above what is represent-
ed. He looks down as if from a
raised platform so that not only
all the figures and object on dif-
ferent planes could be seen with-
out confusion but also the other
side of the curtain would be re-
vealed as well.
AnimBI Forms and
Geometric Patterns
The history of painting is very
old in Persia but by no means
easy to trace. A continuous tra-
dition from the Sassanian period
may be traced supported by sa-
tisfactory evidence, the relics of
which are to be found most abun-
dantly in 12th and 13th Centuries.
The most striking manifestations
of this early art were animal
forms and geometric patterns.
Herzfeld has traced to Sassanians
many wall paintings of dancing
girls, huntresses and floral deco-
rations of various kinds. But usu-
By
Akbar
M. OSKOUl
ally the Manichean artist Mani
is held by Persians to be the first
master artist. His illuminated
books being burned and he him-
self persecuted due to his religious
beliefs (A. D. 290), nothing re-
mains to us of his"Arjang"as
the collection of his painting was
called. In his time Persian paint-
ing is supposed to have developed
as the servant of religion, because.
later on when Islam was intro
duced into the country, painting
was denounced on the authority
of Hadith, though not specifical-
ly by Quran, (there is no clear
prohibition of painting in the
Quran) by the leaaers
of religion as some-
ching allied to idol-
atry.
To admire a repre-
sentation of the hu-
man figure was apt
to result in the wor-
ship of that figure.
Since then the reli-
gious authorities have
never ceased to frown on painting.
A man during this era, would
not be so much represented as
indicated.
But the religion did not ban
painting altogether. It only li-
mited its subject-matter to de-
signs. Calligraphy starts from
here.
Illustrations for Basra and
Kula Quran Manuscripts
Toward the end of the 7th Cen-
tury in Iraq, Basra and kufa
Quran manuscripts with beauti-
ful designs and decorations began
to appear, and religion and art
for a few centuries worked to-
gether in perfect harmony.
Faith, the essential element of aH
forms of artistic inspiration, was
restored, and the artist was con-
fident to work towards something
sublime. He no more had the
fever of an undecided artist t0
whom the whole world is given
to be represented, while his spirit
is divided and his attention dis-
tracted. His was a strong faith
and his task specific.
In the 14th and 15th Centuries,
art succeeded in releasing itself
from the narrow lines drawn JY
theologians and developed rapidly.
National literature was revived
with genuine enthusiasm. The
epic Shah-Nameh of Firdousi was
frequently illustrated with repro-
sentations of Persian heroes. N1-
zami and Khadju Kermani be-
came increasingly common sun-
jects of painting. The pair of
lovers, Khosro and Shirin, Leila
and Majoun were favourite sub-
jects with artists.
Strong Chinese Inl'ueMe
The Chinese influence has been
great on Persian painting and
miniatures but it was not fO
strong as to destroy the tradi-
tion, while on the other hand t
enriched the hands of master ar-
tists like Behzad and to some
extent Reza and the art stin.. e-
mained Persian in its nature.
The decline came suddenly and
since then Persian painting has
not yet risen to its past glory. Th< :,
decline was after Shah Abbas Saf-
vid's reign.
In the 18th century, European
painting and engravings were slav-
ishly copied and the typical them ? s
worked by artists were voluptuous
women of indolent expression, the
artist attempting unsuccessfully
to combine a type of occidental
and oriental beauty.

### 73807: The Story of the United Nations Radio

The Story of the
United Nations Radio
..-lr HIS is the United Na-tions calling the Peo-
ples of the World."
In practically every language
under the sun this statement has
gone out over the air, and in the
four corners of the world people
have become aware of this new
voice speaking directly to them.
When. the United Nations organ-
ization took shape, it was made
clear that it must have its own
radio system so that"we the
people"whose representatives
signed the Charter could hear
what our governments'spokesmen
were doing when they met toge-
ther.
With the co-operation of the
U. S. State Department and the
International Service of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corpora-
tion, and later the facilities of
the World Wide Broadcasting
Foundation at Scituate, Massa-
chusetts, the UN Radio Division
was able to establish a series of
transmissions beamed, respectiv-
ely, to Asia a. nd Australia, Eu-
rope, Latin-America, and to the
Soviet Union.
From the very first, the United
Nations Radio facilities have been
at the disposal of accredited radio
correspondents and of Delega-
tions who, speaking in their own
languages, have been able to
present their own un-censored
reports to listeners in their own
lands ; and many hundreds of
correspondents and Delegates
have availed themselves of this
opportunity during the various
important meetings that have
been held since.
An accredited'radio corres-
pondent or delegate is able not
only to speak over a UN micro-
phone to his own people, but he
can also avail himself of the
United Nations Radio recording
facilities, and prepare his mater-
ial in advance. Recording studio
facilities, production guidance, all
are freely available, and there
has been a tremendous output of
information about the United Na-
tions from this quarter since the
United Nations entered into the
broadcasting field.
It is not enough to broadcast
short-wave : there must be some
guarantee that there are listeners,
not only short-wave listeners, but
listeners who can hear UN broad-
casts on their ordinary medium-
wave receivers clearly and from
a familiar station. This fortuna-
tely HIPs been made frequently
possible by the interested and
generous attitude of many of the
national broadcasting organiza-
tions and local stations. And this
has no doubt been aided also by
the excellence and objectivity of
United Nations news bulletins
and feature programmes that
have been either transmitted
overseas by short-wave or, in
some cases, recorded and sent out
by airmail for relay.
A special programme in 1947,
celebrating the anniversary of the
signing of the UN Charter, was
recorded in the main languages
of the world, distributed by air-
mail, and relayed over national
and local stations. Another im-
portant programme, prepared on
the eve of the General Assembly
held at Flushing Meadows in the
autumn of 1947, and prophetically
and perhaps grimly titled"THE
TIME IS NOW"was broadcast
on gtl UN transmitters and widely
relayed.
It was estimated that, at the
time, probably over 200 million
people may have heard this pro-
gramme, and that it had one of
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and France's René Cassin broadcast their
impressions of a U. N. conference they have attended.

Mass., September 27-29. Much of
the meeting will be devoted to
reports of the operations in the
United States during the pre-
ceeding twelve months and to
the National Commission's plans
for extending its work during the
forthcoming year within the
framework of Unesco's pro-

Unesco Helps Schools
In war-torn Lands
Further shipments of technical
and educational equipment to
war-hurt regions have been made
by Unesco. These supplies, in-
tended as practical assistance to
the efforts at reconstruction,
were purchased from Unesco
funds set aside for the purpose.
Included are : 394 radios, 268
gramophones, 37 typewriters, 40
epidiascopes, 80 sound projectors
and 673 sets of artists supplies,
all of which were bought in the
United States. The countries re-
ceiving the allocations were Chi-
na, Poland, Greece, Czechoslova-
kia, the Philippines, Italy, Hun-
gary and Austria.
Additional materials, including
books on education, literature and
the arts, art reproduction, music
scores, musical instruments, mi-
crofilm strips and microfilm
projectors, are being purchased or
awaiting shipment to the coun-
tries named.
The epidiascopes, which project
images of solid objects as well as
coloured pictures, will be used to
reproduce pages of books, illus-
trations and maps in overcrowded
schools lacking visual aids. Ar-
tists'supplies consist of oil and
water colours and canvas panels.

### 73807: The Story of the United Nations Radio

From a broadcasting booth overlooking a U. N. Session at Lake Suc-
cess, United Nations R dio newsmen prepare on-the-spot analyses of
proceedings.
the largest audiences of any sin-
gle programme.
One of the most notable suc-
cesses of the UN Radio Division
has been in the U. S."medium-
wave"field with a daily quarter-
hour programme,"UNITED NA-
TIONS TODAY", made up of
selections of the recorded voices
of delegates, dispatches, and in-
terviews from UN meetings over-
seas, and the news headlines,
which has been relayed for up-
wards of a year throughout the
United States at a good evening
listening time.
As a complement to this daily
quarter-hour, a new half-hour
weekly summary, in'magazine
style, was developed for, and re-
layed from coast to coast by, the
Canadian Broadcasting Corpora-
tion. Entitled"MEMO FROM
LAKE SUCCESS", this UN pro-
gramme both carries the voices
of UN Delegates in important de-
bates, and dramatizes episodes in
UN work generally. This show is
fed, thanks to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation's Inter-
national Service, to New Zealand
and-along with the daily pro-
gramme-provides the New Zea-
land Broadcasting Service with
much useful raw material for a.
weekly programme prepared there
on United Nations.
Feature Programmes
The output of the United Na-
tions has covered practically
every important form of talks
broadcasting. There are regular
news bulletins, there are talk and
interview periods, and there are
dramatized feature programmes,
combinations of all three. The
subject matter has usually inclu-
ded current UN developments.
using the term in the broadest
sense and including regular refer-
ences to, and broadcasts about,
the Specialized Agencies, UNES-
CO itself in particular, but also
FAO, WHO, IRO, and the others,
according to their activities at
the time.
To carry through with the
plans, the Radio Division staff
has included a team of twenty
or more nationalities, all of them
experienced broadcasters. The
Director, for instance, is a Cm.-
nadian ; the assistant director a
Chilean. A Mexican and an In-
dian share shifts on the Radio
News Desk. Russians and Chinese
man the Sections broadcasting in
those languages. Belgians join
with Frenchmen ; Englishmen,
South Africans, Canadians, and
Australians join with Americans ;
and a variety of Latin-American
nationalities combine, each ser-
ving, respectively, the French, En-
glish-language, and LatlI1-, Il1eri-
can programme of the Division.
And in addition, either on the
staff, or on a part-time basis,
Arabs, Swedes, Danes, Norwe-
gians, and an increasing galaxy
of others maintain the output of
special language transmissions. It
is a busy, interested, picturesque
group of people, proving by the
very job they are doing how possi-
ble international cooperation can
be on the human, personal level.
Thousands of Listeners
Although much remains to be
done in order to provide the
United Nations, and through it
all the Specialized Agencies, with
a radio broadcasting system that
will keep them in direct touch
with the individual citizens of the
world, and although it would be
unwise to over-estimate what has
been accomplished, it is nonethe-
less encouraging to see the extent
to which the UN has been success-
ful in the field of radio on sound,
practical lines.
Its programmes are widely
heard, are widely relayed, are
widely followed. The proceedings,
which are by no means always
entertaining, are nevertheless
followed by thousands of people
in different parts of the world ;
and in some circumstances it has
been possible for people in the
countries most directly concerned
to hear as quickly as the audience
in the Council chamber itself the
decision taken in respect to them-
selves.
Thus, during the various deli-
berations on Palestine, the argu-
ments and voting in the General
Assembly and subsequently in the
Security Council have been heard
in Palestine directly, and the in-
terest in these broadcasts has of
course been intense. Daily the
letters come in to the Radio Divi-
sion at Lake Success, and daily
the interest of the individual
listener, and the appreciation of
the various broadcasting organ-
izations is made clear.
"The United Nations calling the
peoples of the World"is not a
voice crying in the wilderness. It
is heard from loudspeakers on
village housetops and in the
homes. Slowly but surely it is be-
coming a living force. Informa-
tion, facts and fair reporting are
gaining their hold.

### 73805: Dr. Cheng describes close cooperation between China and UNESCO

Dr. CHENG
REPORTS
(Continued from Page 7,)
In furthering the interchange
of persons across national fron-
tiers, China has sent more than
two thousand students abroad to
more than ten countries for ad-
vanced studies during the past
two years. At the same time,
China has offered a number of
scholarships-particularly to Uni-
ted States soldiers who fought in
China-to increase understanding
of the country. Six Unesco
scholarships are now being
allocated to Chinese candidates,
Dr. Cheng reported.
In the same way, the exchange
of publications and literature be-
tween China and other countries
has been increasing, Dr. Cheng
said. China has especially benefit-
ed from gifts of books from Eng-
land, the United States and
France,
In the field of museums and
libraries, China still stands to-
day in great need of small po-
pular institutions easily accessible
to the general public. Though
there are great showplaces-dis-
playing the unrivalled cultural
heritage of thousands of years-
China needs industrial and agri-
cultural exhibits which are of
practical use to the people.
Progress has been made, against
serious handicaps of finance, war-
time dislocation and shortage of
equipment, in developing audio-
visual aids for education. Film-
strips, moving and still pictures,
phonOgTraphs and radios are being
used in schools on a gradually in-
creasing scale.
Last year, for example, the
Ministry of Education-distributed
some 2, 000 radio sets throughout
the country where they were most
needed.
China is making a great effort
to promote teaching about the
United Nations and its Specialized
Agencies in schools, but to date
there are no definite courses.
In the field of international un-
derstanding, the problem in Chi-
na is not as great as in some
other parts of the world. For as
long as fifty years ago, textbooks
had been largely rid of racialist
and nationalist expressions. Uni-
versal love, rather than aggres-
sion and hate, has always been
the strongly predominant aspect
of Chinese education-dating back
to the time of Confucius who was
perhaps the first to teach true
internationalism.
The Chinese press is co-operat-
ing very well in helping acquaint
the people with the work of Unes-
co and the other United Nations
branches. All of the doings of the
National Commission are always
fully reported, as is all the news
sent from the Paris headquarters.
Dr. Cheng declared that the
Unesco Field Science Co-opera-
tion Office in Nanking was fun-
tioning well, with a sub-office in
Shanghai.
In general, Dr. Cheng said, the
National Commission in China is
doing its best to match the spirit
of Unesco and to carry out all the
essential measures in the Unesco
programme. His visit to Paris
would ensure a continuing and in-
creasing liaison between the head-'quarters and the field where the
real effect of Unesco's world must
be felt.
