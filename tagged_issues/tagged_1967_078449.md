This year marks the fiftieth
anniversary of the death of
Auguste Rodin (1840-1917).
The French sculptor's repu¬
tation has steadily grown over
the last half-century, although
during his lifetime the univer¬
sality of his work which is
now generally recognised was
hotly contested. Such is the
variety and range of his out¬
put that the public at large is
still unaware of certain as¬
pects. The work of this
"unknown Rodin" includes
such small sculptures as these
two right hands joined to¬
gether in gentle supplication
(carved stone 64 x 34 x 32
cms). For Rodin, hands were
more expressive than faces.
He entitled this sculpture
"The Cathedral" so as to
combine the idea of the couple
with spiritual elevation, the
supreme symbol of which was
exemplified in his view by
the Gothic arch.

APARTHEID
IN SOUTH AFRICA
The General Assembly of the United
Nations, has proclaimed March 21
"International Day for the Elimination
of Racial Discrimination". In the
same resolution proclaiming this in¬
ternational Day, which coincides
with the anniversary of the Sharpe-
ville massacre in South África, the
Assembly again called on States
practicing racial discrimination or
apartheid to comply with the United
Nations Declaration on the Elimina¬
tion of All Forms of Racial Discrimi¬
nation and with the Universal Dec¬
laration of Human Rights.
At the beginning of this year, on
January 18, an important Unesco re¬
port on the effects of apartheid on
education, science, culture and in¬
formation in South Africa was made
public by the United Nations in New
York. This report will be published
in its final form in English and French
in some months time.
The present issue includes passages
from this document together with a
series of statements on the effects of
apartheid on South Africa's cultural
life. These articles have been spe¬
cially written for the Unesco Cou¬
rier by the distinguished South Afri¬
can writers. Alan Paton, Lewis Nkosi,

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
A
report prepared by the
United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (Unesco) on
the effects of apartheid on education,
science, culture and information in
South Africa concludes that the policy
of apartheid is not only an inadmissible
answer to racial and group conflict
but is itself the major source of racial
and group conflict there.
The report, to be published later this
year by Unesco in its final form, was
prepared for the U.N. General Assemb¬
ly's Special Committee on the Policies
of Apartheid of the Government of
South Africa.
In its report, Unesco terms the situa¬
tion in South Africa "alarming" and
outlines in detail how discrimination in
the areas studied contributes to main¬
taining an ideology which it says is
"unacceptable to the world of today."
The 259-page report was prepared
by the Unesco Secretariat with the
help of various consultants and is
based essentially on official govern¬
ment publications and reports from
scientific and research institutions
within and outside South Africa.
D ISCRIMINATORY practices
at all levels of education, which keep
Africans at the most menial level of
society are outlined in the report. It
cites legislation and regulations which
require Africans to finance their own
educational institutions to a very large
extent through special taxation on them,
which limit the range of subjects offer¬
ed to them in school and which isolate
South African children of different eth¬
nic groups from each other. The report
also states that the overcrowding and
an insufficient number of teachers
for the most part poorly trained add
to a pattern which serves to prevent
Africans, and to lesser extent colour¬
eds and people of Asian extraction,
from playing a full role in society.
While there has been an increase
in the number of Africans going to
school, the report states this has been
achieved without a corresponding rise
in expenditure. In fact, the percentage
of net national income spent on African
schools is decreasing, the report adds.
The increase in school atten¬
dance, the report says, has been
achieved through the introduction of
double sessions in the first two years
of schooling, the policy of appointing
women teachers who are paid a lower
salary and the conversion of money
earmarked for school meals for expan¬
sion of education.
The sum allocated for school meals
has decreased from $1,758,960 in 1954
to $98,000 in 1966. Several surveys
among African school children, con¬
ducted around 1960, revealed that
60-70 per cent were recognizably suf¬
fering from malnutrition, 50 per cent
needed nursing and medical attention
and almost 10 per cent required hospi-
The term "white" is used for
people of European stock. The
term "African" replaces the word
"Bantu" which is at present used
by the South African Govern¬
ment to designate people of
African stock, except in direct
quotations where, if the word
"Bantu" was originally used, it
is retained. The term "Asian" is
used for people of Chinese or
Indian descent, and "coloured"
for those of mixed European and
African or Asian background.
The use in this issue of these
terms white, "African," "Asian"
and "coloured", has been un¬
avoidable, because of the nature
of "apartheid" itself. However,
the Unesco Secretariat rejects
the concepts of race and of
ethnic group relations that such
terms imply.
talization for diseases directly or in¬
directly attributable to malnutrition.
While there is no doubt that primary
level education, financed by the Afri¬
cans themselves, has expanded, the
position has remained almost stationary
at secondary and university levels,
according to the report. "That Africans
are being trained to 'take over' in the
Reserves cannot be supported either
by the numbers who graduate. . . nor
by the degree of administrative respon¬
sibility. That they are not being train¬
ed to play their part in a total South
African society is explicitely stated by
the South African Government itself."
The education section of the report
concludes: "The effects of apartheid
on education go far beyond the racial
discrimination that the facts and figures
of this report demonstrate. The most
deplorable effect is on the South Afri¬
can child whatever his colour. ..who
in all cases is educated within the res¬
trictions of an ideology unacceptable
to the world of today."
T
HE report investigates the
effects of apartheid on the employ¬
ment of non-white scientific and tech¬
nical personnel; on scientific organi¬
zation; on social field research and on
international scientific and technical co¬
operation. Among facts brought out
in the survey are the following:
There is little training available to
non-whites in engineering or in agri¬
culture where the need for non-white
specialists is probably greatest in the
so-called "Bantu Homelands."
The total number of non-white
doctors in 1960 was estimated at
around 130. The number of doctors per
head of population in that year was one
in eighteen hundred in South Africa
compared with one in eleven hundred
in the United Kingdom and one in
seven hundred and fifty in the United
States. Many scientific societies have
resisted government pressure to change
their constitutions so as to prohibit
membership to non-whites.
The difficulty which trained non-
whites experience in obtaining employ¬
ment. "This lack of suitable employ¬
ment opportunities undoubtedly dam¬
pens the enthusiasm of many a
potential non-white scientist and may
lead to mediocre performance and lack
of interest in scientific training," the
report states.
Besides taking up the influence of
apartheid on intellectuals, both "white" K
and "non-white," the report also consi- *
ders culture in the broader context and
gives details of the difficulties encoun-

tered by non-white South Africans fac¬
ed with the official Government policy
of the separation of cultures.
The report cites the Bantu Laws
Amendment Act of 1964 which served
to create a migratory labour force of
Africans temporarily resident in urban
centres but without any permanent
rights. This Act, the report states, has
had important effects on the African
family. One of these has been the
disproportionate increase in African
male population in the suburbs of
cities. Another has been the break-up
of entire families' because of govern¬
ment refusal to permit husbands and
wives to live together.
That apartheid is compatible with
Christianity has been denied by many
denominations, according to the report,
although a 1950 conference of the
Dutch Reformed Churches, which
attempted to define that church's policy
towards the African, endorsed the solu¬
tion of "Bantu Homelands" and recom¬
mended the replacing of the African
in the European industrial system.
In the area of literature, the report
points out that major works by African
South African writers, writing in
English, have been banned as "inde¬
cent, objectionable, or obscene," and
that well-known African writers, if not
under house arrest, now live outside
South Africa.
serves "communism" under the Sup¬
pression of Communism Act of 1950.
According to the Unesco report, this
Act endangers freedom of information.
Under its clauses, the Minister of Jus¬
tice has the power to prohibit an
individual from attending a particular
meeting or playing any part in certain
organizations and may prohibit any per¬
son from living in a given area for
a period of time, as well as assign¬
ing him to a determined residence.
The Annual Survey of South African
Law of 1963 states that there were
7,500 banned publications.
The report concludes that in educa¬
tion, science, culture and information,
apartheid violates both in principle and
in practice the United Nations Charter,
the Constitution of Unesco, the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights,
as well as the standards which have
been set by the international commu¬
nity in conventions, recommendations
and declarations which have been
adopted within the United Nations sys¬
tem. Moreover, "separate develop¬
ment" as practised within the Republic
of South Africa, does not mean equality
between various ethnic groups in any
of the spheres with which Unesco is
concerned.

'OUTH AFRICA has had a
long tradition of library services. The
report states, however, that under the
policy of maintaining separate libraries,
the major libraries remain closed to
non-white South Africans. In Pieter-
maritzburg, the European library has
almost ten times the number of volumes
as the branch for non-Europeans.
Sports have also been affected by
apartheid. The separation of the
"races" in the field of sport covers
five different but related issues, the
report states. These include mixed
teams, inter-racial team competitions,
the participation of non-white players
in games played on fields of all-white
districts and the composition of foreign
teams visiting South Africa and mixed
audiences.
Through the Group Areas Act of
1950, which was later extended to
cinemas, non-whites may not be allow¬
ed to attend cinemas, theatre or opera
in a "white" district without a special
permit, and ¿whites" are not permitted
to attend cinemas and other entertain¬
ments in non-white areas.
While freedom of the press is part
of the Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa, the Government may
prohibit any publication which it deems

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
MYTHS OF SOUTH AFRICA
Two myths aro widely believed in South Africa: that the Dutch landed
in empty territory and that the early history of white settlement was
marked by the massacre of innocent whites by Africans. Early travellers
had very different tales to tell: "On Sunday November 26, 1497 the fleet
reached the inlet ... a number of Hottentots appeared . . . They were
very friendly"; or they "came with ail friendliness to trade with us . . .
The killing of our people is undoubtedly caused by revenge being taken
by the [Africans] when their cattle is seized ..."
In "Prejudice in the Classroom" (Johannesburg, 1966), Eleanor Hawar-
den points out that "if African peoples are presented to school children
solely as engaging in unprovoked attacks on white farmers and this is
the picture which most South African textbooks and teachers present in
both primary and secondary schools then though the facts of individual
attack may be correct, the total impact on the students and the picture
they form of past events, is untrue. It omits the attacks by Europeans,
the provocation suffered by the Africans, the loss of their lands, the
courage and chivalry with which the Ama-Xhosa fought in defending
their country from invasion."
Similarly, land tenure and its relationship to frontier clashes was one
of the key aspects of early South African history. Yet F.E. Auerbach
("Thp Power of Prejudice in South African Education," Cape Town/
Amsterdam, 1965) found that in the Transvaal no junior book explains
it and only one senior book deals with it.

On March 21 1960, the crowd scatters as firing starts in Sharpeville
(South Africa). A few moments after this photograph was taken,
about one hundred Africans were killed and more than two hundred
wounded. The police had opened fire to disperse demonstrators
protesting against the law requiring non-whites to carry passes at
all times. A resolution recently adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly proclaimed March 21 as "International Day for
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination".
A COUNTRY DIVIDED
The following excerpts
are drawn from
the Unesco report
on the effects
of the policy
of apartheid on
education, science,
culture and
information.
S,OUTH Africa, a society in
which Africans, Asians and Europeans
co-exist in the same territory has been
the result of a long history going back
to the first European settlement in the
Cape of Good Hope in 1652. It is a
history not only of prolonged contact
(some of it friendly) between these
groups of people, but also a history
of conflict over land and cattle at
first, then over industrial opportunities
when towns grew up.
There were also conflicts between
the Boers, decendants of the first
Dutch settlers, and the English-speak¬
ing South African conflicts which
terminated in the Boer War and the
defeat of the Dutch-speaking Afrika¬
ners by the English colonizers.
About the mid-twentieth century,
then, the ingredients of the present
alarming South African .situation were
all present: the rivalry between the
Afrikaner and the English-speaking
South Africans which split the white
population into two main groups, the
suspicion and fear which most of the
white group felt for the Africans who
were numerically stronger, against
whom they had fought a series of wars
and whom they had traditionally treat¬
ed as a source of cheap labour.
There was also the coloured group
formed from a mixture of white, Hotten¬
tot and Malay elements and an Asian
group brought to South Africa in the
19th century as labour for the new
sugar plantations in Natal.

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
A COUNTRY DIVIDED (Continued)
The myth of 'separate development'
At the end of the second world war
there was another factor on the South
African scene. White supremacy,
threatened occasionally over the
300 years of white settlement, was
challenged by the emergence of inde¬
pendent states in Africa and Asia.
On the political front the struggle for
independence was a struggle for one-
man one-vote, and had direct conse¬
quences for South African whites, who,
in framing the Constitution of 1910,
had resisted any effective participation
of non-whites in the political process.
There was another challenge; in all
countries arose a new demand for the
implementation of "Human Rights", a
demand encouraged by the United Na¬
tions Universal Declaration of Human
Rights of 1948. In South Africa this
meant a demand for equality of oppor¬
tunity on the social and economic
front and was thus a direct threat to
white privileges.
The Nationalist Party came to power
in 1948 on an appeal which rested al¬
most entirely on its promise to safe¬
guard and, if necessary, strengthen
"white supremacy." In its public state¬
ments the Government identified this
political, economic and social policy
with the ideology of "apartheid" which
was described in the 1947 Election
Manifesto of the National Party as
follows: "In general terms our policy
envisages segregating the most impor¬
tant ethnic groups and sub-groups in
their own areas where every group will
be enabled to develop into a self-suffi¬
cient unit. We endorse the general
principle of territorial segregation of
the Bantu and the Whites ... the Bantu
in the urban areas should be regarded
as migratory citizens not entitled to
political or social rights equal to those
of the Whites. The process of detri-
balisation should be arrested..."
F
8
ROM the beginning there
were two co-existing concepts of apart¬
heid. One was that the races should
be completely segregated into self-
sufficient territories. The other was
that apartheid was not to mean com¬
plete territorial segregation but a more
rigid enforcement of "non-white" social,
economic and political inferiority. From
1948 to 1965, the South African
Government moved in both directions.
On December 4, 1963, the Prime mini¬
ster, Dr. H.F. Verwoerd, stated
that ". . . we shall be able to prove that
it is only by creating separate nations
that discrimination will in fact disappear
in the long run."
It is certain that some idealistic
"white" South Africans hoped that the
incipient conflict in the South African
situation would be resolved by apart¬
heid. Further, many hoped that while
the political and economic aspirations
of the "African" majority and the
"coloured" and "Asian" minorities
would be met by "separate develop¬
ment" the privileges of a "white" South
Africa would be guaranteed.
The creation of Bantustans "Black
Homelands" from the scattered reser¬
ves and the establishment of the Trans¬
kei as an example of a semi-autono¬
mous state, are steps in this "separate
development."
I T is not necessary here to
go into the Government's case for
independent Bantustans or the case
against it. It is sufficient to note the
report of the United Nations' Special
Committee on Apartheid in South Afri¬
ca, September 13, 1963: "These moves
are engineered by a Government in
which the African people concerned
have no voice and are aimed at the
separation of the races and the denial
of rights to the African population in
six-sevenths of the territory of the
Republic of South Africa in return for
promises of self-government for the
Africans in scattered reserves which
account for one-seventh of the terri¬
tory. These reserves contain less than
two-fifths of the African population of
the Republic, while many of the Afri¬
cans in the rest of the country are
largely detribalised and have little
attachment to the reserves . . . The
creation of Bantustans may, therefore,
be regarded as designed to reinforce
white supremacy in the Republic by
strengthening the position of tribal
chiefs, dividing the African people
through the offer of opportunities for
a limited number of Africans and
deceiving public opinion."
One important step in any attempted
separation of the races was the enforc¬
ed removal of people of differing races
who had lived closely together.
The Population Registration Act of
1950 with its later amendments provid¬
ed for the classification of the South
African population into three main
groups: white, coloured and African
the Asians constituting a sub-group in
the coloured group. This classification
was fundamental to the whole Govern¬
ment policy of "separateness" for
each "race".
Control of the freedom of movement
of Africans has been achieved through
the "Pass Laws." A system of Pass
Laws was in effect before the Natio¬
nalist Party came to power; however,
these laws varied from province to
province. Some classes of "Africans"
were exempted from carrying them,
and in the Cape, while they existed
in theory, they were in practice no
longer required.
The Natives (Abolition of Passes
and Co-ordination of Documents) Act,
1952, repealed previous laws. Hence¬
forth all Africans were required to
possess a "reference book" which
contains detailed information about the
holder, including a space for efflux
and influx control endorsements. Fail¬
ure to produce the "reference book"
on demand is a criminal offence.
Between July 1, 1963, and June 30,
1964, 162,182 Africans had been pro¬
secuted for failing to register or to
produce these documents.
The Natives (Urban Areas) Consoli¬
dation Act of 1945 and its amend¬
ments together with the Bantu Laws
Amendment Act, N° 42, provided for
the compulsory residence in locations,
native villages or hostels of Africans
within an urban area. It regulated
the entry of Africans into the areas
and the place of their settlement. The
presence of an African in a prescribed
area for more than 72 hours is subject
to severe restrictions. To take up
work he must get permission from a
labour bureau, and to visit the area
permission must be sought from a
labour officer.
S
OME Africans are exempt¬
ed from these restrictions; for example,
those continuously resident in the area
since birth (who must provide proof
that they are entitled to be there.) But
even Africans who qualify to remain
in a prescribed area may be deemed
"idle" or "undesirable" and then be
ordered out of the area, forfeiting
their residential rights. Moreover,
there seems to be some confusion as
to what the exemptions are and to
whom they apply.
The Group Areas Act has been fol¬
lowed by a list of Group Area Decla¬
rations setting aside areas for the
exclusive occupation of one or other
population group. This Act has been
implemented in spite of repeated reso¬
lutions by the General Assembly.
The proclamations issued in October
1963 involved in Durban alone the
eviction of nearly 10,000 families, the
great majority of them Indians. In

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
The Extension of
University Education Act
1959 proposed to replace
attendance of non-whites
at the universities
which until then were open
to all races by
institutions for the
different groups :
Africans, Asians and
coloureds, each with its
own university, the
Africans being further
divided according to
tribal origins. The
Unesco report finds that
"neither enrolments,
nor degrees awarded,
justify the statement that
establishment of Ethnic
Group Colleges has
provided increased
university facilities for
non-whites." While 144
Africans obtained degrees
in 1956 and 182 in 1961,
there were only 105
in 1962.
Outside Durban University
(right), white and
African students protest
against racial
discrimination. This
demonstration took place
ten years ago ; today
it would be an extremely
risky undertaking. The
new laws are so
stringent that all
participants could be
arrested and detained
without charge for
nearly six months.
1964 the declarations were designed
to resettle virtually all of the 38,000 In¬
dians on the Rand.
Ejection orders are not confined to
situations in which there may be a
degree however small of mixed
residential districts; the orders were
framed to force non-whites out of the
town centres and to resettle them on
the outskirts. Thus, the joint minis¬
terial statement of February 1966
declared District Six one of the oldest
sections of Cape Town which had
been populated by coloured residents
for over 300 years, as a "white" area.
A coloured population of over 20,000
was to be forced to move.
In spite of the ideology of apartheid,
in spite of the uprooting of thousands
of families, the complete separation of
peoples into tribal and ethnic groupings
in South Africa has proved impossible.
The closely integrated economic struc¬
ture, the location of all the major
industries, all the mineral wealth, all
the important harbour facilities and all
the best arable land in that part of
South Africa which is outside the
reserves in white ownership has meant
that Africans as well as "coloureds"
and "Asians" remain dependent on
the town and farming complex of
"white" South Africa for a livelihood.
Even the Government's attempt to en
courage African-owned small-scale
industries in the Transkei has come up
against the relative poverty of the area,
the comparative lack of natural resour¬
ces and the lack of accumulated
capital.
For good or ill, "white" and "non-
white" South Africa remain economi¬
cally interdependent. If the non-whites
need the job opportunities at present
available in "white" South Africa, so
white South Africa could not maintain
its present industrial and agricultural
production nor the present high
standard of living without non-white
labour. In fact, whatever the stated
policy of the Government, there has

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
In 1961 an Indian, Dr Dorasamy Chetty,
a graduate of the University of the
Witwatersrand (South Africa) and the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, with many years of experience
on malaria eradication programmes in
the Far East with the World Health
Organization, was unable to obtain a
post in South Africa where he could
practice and teach preventive medicine.
' In 1962, "in terms of Government policy,
a highly qualified African doctor was
refused an appointment to the Liv¬
ingstone Hospital for non-whites in Port
Elizabeth because in his post he would
have had several whites working under
him" (A Survey of Race Relations,
Johannesburg, 1963).'

been an increasing number of Africans
admitted to urban areas.
Between 1962 and 1964 the Afri¬
can population of Johannesburg in¬
creased from 609,100 to 706,389; the
number of African men employed in
Durban increased from 74,500 in 1946
to 136,000 in 1965. In the Western
Cape, the number of Africans em¬
ployed by local authorities, the Pro¬
vincial Administration, Public Service
Departments, agriculture and industry
increased from 1963 to 1964 by 7.5 %
(from almost 77,000 to a little under
83,000) and increasing numbers were
being recruited for employment through
the labour bureaux in the Transkei.
The main push of apartheid has
therefore been in the direction of more
rigid racial discrimination, with growing
inequalities in opportunities.
As could be expected, the policy of
apartheid has given rise to opposition.
There have been protests, demonstra¬
tions and riots from the non-whites,
while among whites opposition to the

Government's policy has ranged from
criticism to more political involvement.
A minority can hardly succeed in
preserving its absolute supremacy in
all spheres without the use of force.
It is therefore not surprising that the
implementation of the policy of apart¬
heid has been accompanied by an
abuse of police power, a disregard for
the integrity of the individual and cen¬
sorship of the press.
The real or imagined fear of coun¬
ter-violence, has led those in power
to a multiplication of procedures
aimed at strengthening the system of
apartheid by destroying opposition.
Again and again during the post¬
war period, attention has been called to
the situation in South Africa with regard
to civil rights. One need only briefly
draw attention to the 90-day detention
clause in the General Law Amendment
Act, 1963, which when it was with¬
drawn was in fact replaced by the Cri-

minai Proceedure Amendment Act.
Under this Act the Attcrney General
may issue a warrant for arrest and de¬
tention for a maximum of six months
(180 days) of a person who is likely
to give evidence for the State in any
criminal proceedings with respect to
certain offences, as long as that deten¬
tion is deemed to be in the interest of
such a person or of the administration
of justice.
The International Commission of
Jurists observed: "This must be one of
the most extraordinary powers that
have ever been granted outside a
period of emergency. It authorizes the
detention of an innocent person against
whom no allegations are made and no
suspicion even exists; it authorizes
detention in the absolute discretion of
the Attorney General. It denies the
detainee access to a lawyer without
special permission; and it precludes
the courts from examining the validity
Of the detention even within the al¬
ready very wide powers of the Act.
"It further authorizes the subjection
Of the detained witness to solitary con¬
finement for a period of six months
and, with the object, inter alia of
excluding, 'tampering with or intimida¬
tion' of any person, places him in a
situation where he Is in the almost
uncontrolled power of the police who
also have an interest in the evidence
he may give."
There are, too, the peculiar techni¬
ques of banishing, or listing persons,
and of banning.
Banishment is an action which can
be taken against Africans. The Native
Administration Act empowers the State
President, whenever he deems it expe¬
dient in the public interest, without
notice to order any tribe, portion of
tribe or individual African to move to
any stated place. Banishment has
been used, i.a, to remove from the
reserves persons who have been active
opponents of chiefs or of certain
Government measures.
In addition, emergency regulations
for the Transkei provide that any per¬
son suspected of committing an
offence under the regulations of any
law, or of intending to do so, or of
possessing information about an
offence may be arrested without war¬
rant and held in custody until the
police or prison authorities are satis¬
fied that they have fully and truth¬
fully answered all relevant questions
put to them. The offences include:
holding a meeting of more than ten
Africans unless with special permission
(church services and funerals are
exempted), making any statement or
performing any action likely to have
the effect of interfering with the autho¬
rity of the State, one of its officials, or
a chief or headman, or boycotting an
official meeting.

The person held in custody under
these regulations may not consult a
legal adviser without the consent of
the Minister of Bantu Administration
and Development.
Between January and April 1966, a
total of sixty-two Transkeians were
detained by the South African autho¬
rities.
Under the Suppression of Commu¬
nism Act, 1950, amended in 1962, a
person might be listed as member or
active supporter of the Communist
Party of South Africa (banned in 1950)
or of any other organizations deemed
unlawful (as the African National Con¬
gress, the Pan-African Congress and
the African Resistance Movement.)
In 1962 a list of 437 names of persons,
129 whites and 308 non-whites, was
published in the Gazette. At a later
date some were removed from the list;
others were added. The publication
of the names is merely for public
information, having no direct legal
consequences.
However, the Minister of Justice is
empowered to take certain actions
against a listed person. It should be
mentioned that the same actions might
be directed against certain other cate¬
gories, too, as persons convicted of
actions deemed to have furthered the
aims of Communism. Banning orders
of the most varying character might be
served. Thus, a person might be pro¬
hibited from becoming or being a mem¬
ber of specified organizations or orga¬
nizations of a specified nature.
Further, a person may be prohibited
from attending gatherings of any kind,
including social gatherings. Bans pro- '
hibiting persons from attending gather¬
ings are rather frequent. With certain
exceptions it is an offence to record,
publish, or disseminate any speech,
utterance or writing made anywhere at
any time by a person under such ban.
In addition a banning order may imply
that the person concerned is prohibited
from absenting himself from any stated
place or area, may be confined to a
town or a suburb, may be confined to
house arrest for a certain number of
hours, and on public holidays. It is
sometimes required that the person
shall remain at home for 24 hours each
day.
The publication of particulars in the
Gazette contains the date of delivery
of notice and the date on which notice
expires. The period varies, often it
is one or two years, and sometimes
five years.
At the beginning of 1964, 257 per¬
sons were subject to restrictions under
the Suppression of Communism Act.
The United Nations Special Com¬
mittee on the policy of Apartheid in
the Republic of South Africa gave the
number of persons "banned" as
approximately 600 in 1966.
While Unesco is not directly con¬
cerned with the economic and political
aspects of apartheid in the Republic
of South Africa, the policy of apart¬
heid has consequences for education,
science, culture and the dissemination
of information consequences which
follow logically from the philosophical
concept of man as conceived of by the
ideology of "apartheid", from the eco¬
nomic inequalities which the policy
creates and reinforces, and from the
political situation which severely
curtails freedom for all South Africans,
and in particular for the non-white
South Africans who form the majority
of the country's population.
N conformity with the ¡deal
of "separateness," Africans, Asians,
coloured and whites are educated as
independent groups within the popula¬
tion, the "separateness" emphasized by
the administrative structure of educa¬
tion, by methods of finance, by diffe¬
rences in syllabuses, and by different
levels of achievement deliberately
imposed to fit in with different expecta¬
tions in employment. Ultimately educa¬
tion is geared for the effective prepara
tion of the Africans for their future
occupations as unskilled labourers.
Higher training is intended only for the
small number of persons who can be
employed in skilled work in African
"homelands" or African "development
schemes."
The result of racial discrimination
in education and in the pattern of em¬
ployment is seen clearly in the field
of science. South Africa is facing a
chronic shortage of top-level man¬
power in science and technology as
well as in management. The shortage
cannot be remedied by relying on the
white population alone. Moreover, the
general repressive atmosphere is ini¬
mical to the development of a spirit
.of free enquiry and has led to the loss
to South Africa of some scientists of
great eminence, particularly ¡n the
field of the social sciences. The poli¬
tical atmosphere has also affected
recruitment of staff, particularly from
universities in the United Kingdom.
"Separate development" in the field
of culture has reduced to a minimum
all contacts between whites and non-
whites that are not purely of an eco¬
nomic nature. As in all other fields,
"separate development" is in fact
synonymous with "inequality of
access", but moreover, cultural apart¬
ness, as opposed to cultural interac¬
tion for which Unesco stands, has
limited the creative possibilities of all
South Africans.

### 59663: Apartheid in South Africa
That policy cannot be separated from
principle is illustrated by the fact that,
whilst the South African Government
in its statements continues to uphold
the right to freedom of information, the
need to enforce the policy of apartheid
has affected the relevant legislation
and its application, the actions taken
denying in fact the principle of free¬
dom of information.
Apartheid is not only not an admis¬
sible answer to racial and group con¬
flict but is itself the major source of
this conflict. This is most serious in
relationships between whites and non-
whites, but the very heightening of
group awareness, which is part of the
aims of the apartheid system, should
per se intensify hostilities between
Afrikaner and English-speaking South
Africa, and, by the separation of Afri¬
cans into self-contained tribal units,
create a tribal nationalism leading to
increased inter-tribal rivalry.
The image of man to whatever
ethnic group he belongs or is made a
part of which results from the policy
of apartheid in South Africa, is an
image which is clearly the opposite of
the one to which the community of
nations is ethically and legally dedi¬
cated.
T
HE ill effects of apartheid
are not confined to the situation within
South Africa; "the practice of apart¬
heid and all other forms of racial dis¬
crimination constitute a threat to inter¬
national peace and security and are a
crime against humanity," as stated in
the Resolution on "Unesco's tasks in
the light of the resolutions adopted by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations at its 20th session on ques¬
tions relating to the liquidation of colo¬
nialism and racialism," which was
adopted by the General Conference at
its 14th session (Nov. 1966).
The Secretary-General of the United
Nations emphasized in an address on
February 3, 1964: "There is the clear
prospect that racial conflict, if we can¬
not curb and finally eliminate it, will
grow into a destructive monster com¬
pared to which the religious or ideolo¬
gical conflicts of the past and present
will seem like small family quarrels . . .
This, for the sake of all our children,
whatever their race and colour, must
not be permitted to happen."
The group of experts, established by
the Security Council Resolution of
December 4, 1963, warned that "a race
conflict starting in South Africa must
affect race relations elsewhere in the
world, and also, in its international
repercussions, create a world danger
of first magnitude."
LU
o."
THE INVISIBLE WALL. That the Informal and personal contacts between people and pri¬
vate entertaining are important in the ordinary daily living together of any people no-one
will deny. The extent to which they can take place in South Africa is limited by the regu¬
lations governing eating together outside of the home, staying overnight in named areas
or in getting permission to visit "locations". It would be impossible for a racially mixed
group of South Africans to have tea or coffee together in any public place in the Republic.
Besides this, the whole atmosphere of mistrust between people, the basic suppositions
of the superiority and inferiority of racial groups, the difficult political problems, the
suspicion that Government-paid informers exist make meaningful human relationships not
only across colour groups, but within groups themselves, difficult to maintain. As long
as the present situation continues, one thing is certain South African culture (for whites
and non-whites) will become increasingly less creative.

THE EFFECTS OF APARTHEID
ON CULTURE
The price
segregation
by Atan Patón
m
ALAN PATÓN was born ¡n 1903 in
the province of Natal, South Africa. His
famous novel "Cry, the Beloved Country"
(1948), which was translated into 18
languages and published in 22 countries,
earned him world-wide renown. An opera,
"Lost in the Stars", and a film were based
on this book which gives a moving
account of the conflicts and crises
arising from racial segregation in South
Africa. Paton's second novel, "Too Late
the Phalarope" deals with the attitudes of
the Afrikaners. All his books, some
fifteen novels and studies, have been
published outside South Africa, in England
or the United States. They include "South
Africa and her People" (1957), "The
Christian Approach to Racial Problems
in the Modern World" (1959), 'Hope for
South Africa" (1959), "Tales from a Troubl¬
ed Land" (1961) and "South African
Tragedy ; the Life and Times of Jan
Hofmeyr" (1965). Alan Paton was among
those who formed the Liberal Association
of South Africa which became the
Liberal Party of which he is President.
The Liberal Party re/ects the racial
theories used to justify white supremacy
and aims at equal rights for all South
Africans regardless of their ethnic groups.

T,HE policy of apartheid, or
Separate Development as it is now
more grandly called, has as one of its
main aims the preservation of the
cultures of each of the racial groups
in South Africa,' the safeguarding of
each culture from contamination by the
others, and presumably the develop¬
ment of each of these cultures "along
its own lines". Apartheid has no
vision whatsoever of a South African
culture, enriched by contributions from
its Afrikaners, its Africans, its Coloured
people (that is, those of mixed blood,
Malay, Hottentot, and European strains

speaking people, its Hindus and
Muslims and Jews. These streams
must not flow into a river, they must
not even flow into the sea, they must
flow parallel to one another for ever
and ever.
Nor does apartheid envisage a
group of distinct racial cultures con¬
tinually enriching themselves and
others by fruitful exchanges. In fact
the purpose of legislation is to prevent
this from happening. It is now against
the law for a mixed (1) audience of
whites and non-whites, even with
segregated seating, to attend the
ballet, the concert, the opera, the
theatre, without a special permit from
the governmental authorities.
Hardly a day passes without news
that a permit for this or that event has
been refused. The most recent
example of this is the refusal to allow
Africans to attend the quinquennial

Government is prepared however to
let the all-white cast present a
separate performance for Africans, but
it would almost certainly not be
prepared to allow the producer of the
play to use a non-white actor for the
part of Simon of Cyrene. Nor can a
coloured opera group use a white
singer without permit.
It would be tiresome to retail the
thousand-and-one permutations and
combinations for which permits would
be required. The whole thing is an

### 59665: The Price of segregation
THE PRICE OF SEGREGATION (Continued)
'Like walking blindfold through a minefield'
immense fatuity, irrational and derisible,
with an element of cruelty that is
inevitably present when one race group
assumes the task of preserving the
cultures of others.
The same fatuity characterises the
Government attitude towards sport.
Spectators in segregated seating may,
if a permit is granted, witness cricket,
soccer, rugby, football, tennis, and
other games, but no mixed team can
visit the country. Nor can any mixed
team be formed in the country, except
presumably to play on some private
ground, nor can a team of one race
play against a team of another race
without a permit.
The reader must note, however, that
this would not apply if the two mono-
racial teams were both white; it is the
element of colour that is the important
consideration. It will therefore be
seen that apartheid or separate
development is not solely concerned
with the preservation of cultural
differences; it is equally concerned
with the preservation of racial
differences, and above all, of course,
with the preservation of white racial
purity, such as it is after a period of
three centuries.
Again hardly a day passes without
news that sports apartheid is being
more and more rigidly enforced.
The South African golfer Mr. Papwa
Sewgolum is of Indian descent, but he
can no longer play in any open golf
tournament. He can therefore no
longer win prizes, and must rely on
charity to enable him to golf abroad,
for example, in Holland, of whose
Open Tournament he has been the
winner on two occasions.
The Government has already
announced that if Mr. Basil D'Oliviera,
a South African coloured man living
in England, is selected to play for
England in cricket in 1968, the team
will not be allowed to enter South
Africa.
As I write this, it has just been
announced that Mr. Ronnie van der
Walt, a leading South African boxer
who has been fighting in "white"
boxing for 12 years, has now been
classified as a coloured man. When
interviewed by newspaper men, he
broke down and wept. His tears will
bring no relief; the Government will
go ahead with its task of creating a
happy and harmonious community out
of the unhappinesses of individual men
and women.
The people who suffer most from
these restrictions are those Africans,
Indians, and Coloured people who are
eager to enjoy and to learn more
about Western music, ballet, theatre,
and opera. Such people are incident¬
ally characterized by their quiet
behaviour. They do not go to concerts
and plays to demonstrate, they go to
hear and enjoy and learn. Their
numbers are in general not great, so
that they are unable to organize such
occasions for themselves. In any
event it appears to me impossible for
any non-Westerner, except the most
exceptional, to make much progress in
the understanding of Western culture
unless he is in touch with those who
are part of it.

existed, had not yet been translated

### 59665: The Price of segregation
Greatly against the desires of
the parents, primary education
is given in the vernacular,
whereas parents want it in
English. As the Unesco Report
on Apartheid in South Africa
states, this serves "to reinforce
the linguistic, social and
cultural isolation of the African
population within the country
as well as from the world at
large." Left, a school in the
Capetown area.

into the formidable body of law the
making of which has occupied
so much of the time and energy of
successive Parliaments. Cultural con¬
tacts between and among South
Africans of different races were
steadily increasing. It would almost
appear that South Africans were
growing in cultural awareness of one
another.
This tide has now been halted and
is in fact receding. Yet one hears the
preposterous suggestion that the
children in rigidly segregated schools
should be taught to appreciate and
understand the children of other races.
They are in fact to be taught to love
others, while being strictly forbidden
to play or eat or have any meaningful
relationship with them.
Apartheid has a crippling effect on
the art of writing. I give it as my
considered opinion that any play or
work of fiction which dealt with any
racial topic or any act of injustice in
a way uncongenial to the government,
would today, have little chance of
passing the governmental organ known
as the Publications Control Board,
whose powers are very far-reaching.
I add that such a work need not be
brought before the Board, but that
few publishers or producers would risk
a ban after publication or production.
It could of course be said that the
banning of publications has nothing to
do with apartheid, but in fact the
banning of publications is directed as
much against books dealing with racial
topics and injustices as it is against
the flood of pornographic trash which
would pour into the bookstalls.
The real purpose of publications
control is shown by the attitude
of censors towards "Selma", that
distasteful tale of the freedom fighters
in the Deep South. Any novel dealing
with love or sex affairs between black
and white (unless it does so with
considerable restraint, as in my own
novel "Too Late the Phalarope") would
never be allowed to enter South Africa.
But "Selma" was allowed to enter
because it showed freedom fighters
as unsavoury characters; who would
want integration if these are the people
who fight for it?
One must not think that apartheid
and authoritarian control of thought
and education are separate entities.
They are one and the same thing.
Without authoritarian control there
could be no apartheid. Both of
them powerfully influence the culture.
Some years ago African education
was largely in the hands of missionary
bodies, who gave what one could
generally describe as a liberal
education. Today, with the exception
of the Transkei, it is firmly in the hands
of the Bantu Education Department.
Greatly against the desires of the
parents, primary education is given in
the vernacular, whereas parents want
it to be in English. They believe, and
university teachers confirm, that their
children are retarded by one or two
years by this vernacular teaching.
What is more, they want their sons and
daughters to be at home in the
Western, or shall we call it the modern,
world. They (though not often
publicly) deride the idea that their
culture must be preserved by others
and say that they will preserve what
they choose to.
I
here are already signs
that the Government would like to
exercise a tighter control over the
education of white children also, which
at the moment is controlled by the
provincial administrations. Although
white unity is thought to be necessary
in the face of threats from within
and without, Afrikaans-speaking and
English-speaking children are educated
in separate schools. They may later
co-operate in commerce, industry, and
other spheres, but during their
impressionable years they must be
kept apart. The government has also
given signs that it is preparing to
exercise greater control over university
affairs.
Finally, apartheid has had a
calamitous effect on that part of culture
which has to do with moral ideas.
Here I shall confine myself to the moral
ideas of the white population.
Apartheid, because it has been
elevated to the status of the supreme
value, has wrought devastation
amongst the other values. The rule of
law is one of the outstanding
casualties; people are banned,
banished, and detained in solitary
confinement for periods up to 180 days
without any recourse to the courts of
law. White South Africa, with
laudable exceptions, accepts this
procedure on the grounds that such
people "must have been up to
something"
Certainly the proposition that the
end justifies the means is not now
much debated. Such things as the
rule of law, university autonomy,
parental rights to choose the language
in which children are educated, the
freedom of the churches, have all
suffered erosion. The value of any
thought, any activity, is officially judged
by one criterion and one alone does
it further or does it impede the cause
of apartheid.
The Press, especially the English
language, is under continuous fire.
Although as yet no direct steps have
been taken to curb it, the editing of
a paper is, in the words of one of our
leading editors, "like walking blind¬
fold through a minefield".
Therefore although one of the main
aims of apartheid is to develop the
cultures separately, its effect is to
ossify them separately, and to make
them resistant to the entrance of new
ideas. Whether the State will be in
the long run successful in maintaining
its hold on culture, or whether culture
has some inherent and independent
life of its own, remains to be seen.
One takes hope from the knowledge
that there are South Africans of all
races who reject apartheid as a
gigantic self-deception, who reject
what is called the "traditional way of
life", who speak and write openly, and
boldly present their ideas for the
consideration and criticism of younger
generations, though it may be
dangerous for them to do so.
Nor should one overlook the fact
that despite the laws and the
conventions, and despite the attempt
to preserve the separate racial
cultures, a great deal of cultural
assimilation has already taken place,
and though attempts are made to
reverse the process (as in making the
vernacular the medium of school
instruction), there are grounds for
believing that they will not be
successful. The forces that make for
apartheid and those that make for
assimilation will continue to fight each
other, in a struggle that is as old as
South Africa itself.

COLOUR MAKES THE JOB
During the past five years there are records of only three non-white
engineering graduates from South African universities.
The Government may prohibit the replacement of employees of one
race by those of another race, may reserve certain types of jobs to
persons of a specific race. The Government in introducing this legisla¬
tion indicated that it was intended to protect the "white" labour force
against the infiltration of non-whites into skilled labour. The Trade
Unions have become one of the strongest supporters of a job reser¬
vation policy, and its corollary "white supremacy", in the social and
economic spheres.
From the Unesco Report on Apartheid
By interfering with their freedom
of movement and residence, says an
International Labour Organisation report
South African law tends to compel
non-whites to take up the least attractiv
jobs. Above, an African worker
arrives at a diamond mine. South Africa
is the second largest producer of
diamonds in the world.
Only the whites are eligible
for highly skilled work or
executive positions. Left, an
interview in the personnel
bureau of a diamond mine.
Each evening (right), the miners
hand in at a window the diamonds
extracted during the day. Miners
are stringently controlled to prevent the
stones from being smuggled out.
When their employment comes to
an end, the miners are carefully searched.
This man (far right) has been searched
and is about to be X-rayed.
Additionally, non-white workers are
obliged to live within the actual area
of the mine throughout their employment.

THE EFFECTS OF APARTHEID ON CULTURE
The forbidden dialogue
by Lewis Nkosi
T
20
HE profoundest, most com¬
pelling impulses of South African
society have always been, and still
are, toward amalgamation. This is
perhaps the fact least frequently noted
about South Africa even by those most
opposed to the doctrine of apartheid;
but it is a fact which I think ought to
be set down straightaway not only
because it is true and evidence can be
adduced to support it, but because a
great deal of the legislative programme
of the Nationalist Party Government
since 1949 cannot be properly under¬
stood without taking this fact into
account.
It has also become fashionable in
writing about South Africa to empha¬
size the incompatibility of black and
white interests; yet left to their own
devices the races have always tended
to move closer, albeit unconsciously,
toward some form of integration.
Surely the most glaring proof of this
fact lies in the economic sphere; but
less obvious is a similar impulse at
work in the social sphere, which,
however denied and deeply buried,
continues to reaffirm itself and to agi¬
tate toward complete expression.
The very strong attempts to separate
the races by legislation, by force if
necessary, shows how strong this
impulse is. And how natural. The
State therefore feels compelled to uti¬
lise all its energies toward erecting
barriers against the secret, often deni¬
ed but natural tendency toward inte¬
gration; and it is my view that such an
occupation by the State is not only of
doubtful value but that it is positively
harmful to the cultural life of the
country.
That the blacks suffer untold hard¬
ships as a price for the maintenance
of the policy of apartheid is a fact
that cannot be denied even by the
proponents of apartheid. How often
has one been told that a certain amount
of hardship and injustice is inevitable
during the transitional period leading
to that perfect state of race separation
in which all races will enjoy true well-
being and in which they will experience
deep spiritual and material satisfac¬
tion?
What is not always noted is that,
though economically exploitative as
a ruling class, the whites are also
subject to certain very real deprivations
as a result of their determination to
live by a policy which would seem
to all reasonable men not only unrealis¬
tic but insane.
To say the very least, South African
whites are the most culturally deprived
community in Africa. Emotionally they
are just as stunted. White South Afri¬
cans cannot express certain emotions
which come naturally to most healthy
people simply because the State has
decided that the expression of such
emotions is subversive of the very
foundations of White Supremacy.
As a result they not only grow up
denying their innermost dreams, they
also learn to do without some of the
best works of modern world culture
(in literature, music, painting and intel¬
lectual discourse) either because such
works are considered subversive or
resuscitative of dreams that would be
better left covered, or because traffic
in culture with the outside world is
rendered almost impossible by the
maintenance of the policy of apartheid.
It must be remembered that a great
number of people active in the cultural
area are either non-white or white
people strongly opposed to a doctrine
of apartheid. Thus the white commu¬
nity in South Africa is becoming almost
as isolated in its privileged position as
are the blacks without privileges; for
not only must the blacks not see Harry
Belafonte with a white girl in his arms
in "Island in the Sun" but the whites
must not see Tony Curtis chained to
Sidney Poitier in the film, "The Defiant
Ones."
Indeed, a great number of mod¬
ern works of the best kind in the
post-war cinema are kept out of the
Republic of South Africa. The banning
of books and plays thought to be con¬
troversial is too well-known to need
reiteration. Under these circumstances
it would be surprising if the growth of
an indigenous South African culture
was not hampered and it would be
surprising indeed if the fostering of
standards on a par with the rest of the
world was not rendered almost impos¬
sible.
However, let us take a closer look
at the effects of apartheid on the grow¬
ing indigenous culture in the country
itself. I think I can write more effecti¬
vely about an area in which I myself
am interested. That area happens to
be literature.
I t seems to me that both
black and white writers are severely
impoverished by the limitations as well
as the schism existing in South African
national life, by a certain lack of shared
assumptions or sense of common na¬
tionhood, fostered by the persistent
and ruthless application of the policy
of apartheid.
For a black writer too much of his
emotional response is absorbed into
formulating his attitude toward apart¬
heid or finding his place in the revo¬
lutionary struggle; no matter where he
goes later on and no matter how bored
he is with politics he cannot be free
of the tragic burden of South Africa
until that country has freed its
14,000,000 non-whites.
Yet there are times when a writer
must suspect that his revolt against
the system is too easy, even glib, pre¬
determined rather than arrived at out
of a singular personal anguish; and

### 59666: The Forbidden dialogue
LEWIS NKOSI, South African author and
Journalist, was born in 1936 in Durban
where he was educated and later became
an editorial writer on the Zulu-English
newspaper "llanga Lase Natal" (Natal
Sun). He then joined the editorial staff of
"Drum" and of "Golden City Post" in
Johannesburg. In 1960 he was exiled by
the South African Government. In 1966
his collection of essays "Home and Exile"
shared second prize with Ralph Ellison's
"Shadow and Act" at the Dakar World
Festival of the Negro Arts. He now lives
in London where he is literary editor of
"The New African".
this revolt, so far as literature is con¬
cerned, must result in the formulation
of characters who are not only glib
and standardized but whose only claim
upon our imagination is that they are
caught in the apartheid mill. If we
confess ourselves bored with them we
then experience some guilt because
we cannot be sure that we are not
becoming unduly callous.
At the same time it seems to me
that the blacks in South Africa, no
matter how deprived economically or
politically, have a graver, far more res¬
ponsible attitude toward life. Where
white South Africans must manufacture
dreams and fantasies in order to main¬
tain some equilibrium between what
they really are and what they think
they are, the blacks have to learn quite
early to strip themselves of every illu¬
sion.
With the hindsight of modern psy¬
chology we all know what happens
to people who cannot face up to the
reality of their lives, who must live by
evasions and fantasies; a greater
burden is placed on writers or any
other kind of artists who belong to
such a community. Before they go on
to create anything of value they must
make an extraordinary effort to unlearn
everything they have been taught.
To put it more simply, in South
Africa, they must, for instance unlearn
what they are taught in schools: that
the whites, from their forefathers to
the present generation, are all heroes,
that the whites have the monopoly op
moral wisdom and intellectual enter¬
prise; the pain and the anguish which
attends the creative efforts of Afri¬
kaans writers at the moment is not a
matter for cynical amusement. It is an
agony of creative artists who must
break through a sealed cocoon in
order to see the world in its various-
ness or even to say something remo¬
tely relevant to their country.
Black writers do not have to make
any comparable moral choice; they do
not have to choose to oppose a system
which is patently contrary to all ob¬
servable reality; their colour makes the
choice for them; what they have to
do is learn to survive the system.
What they are prevented from doing
by a combination of circumstances is
exploring in depth that experience
which goes deeper than the present
apartheid setup, for there are times
when an affirmation of certain tradi¬
tional African values proves exasperat-
ingly difficult for black writers since
most of them are reacting to an ideo¬
logy which asserts again and again
that black and white people are irre¬
concilably different; that the African
mind cannot grasp certain nuances of
European thought; and, concluding
from the foregoing, that apartheid is
justifiable, indeed, the only realistic
policy to follow.
The result has been that black intel¬
lectuals in South Africa have had to
bend over backwards to prove that they
cannot only master the modes of Euro¬
pean thought but that they can beat
the South African whites at their own
game.
In the process they have neglected
to. examine those modes of thought or
cultural expression which are indige¬
nous and have sustained masses of
their fellow Africans undergoing the
process of urbanization. Consequently,
urban African music seems to me to
have provided the only example of
what South Africa can offer culturally
if she were left to develop in a natural
direction.
Music, because it is non-literal, is
not subject to the same limitations as
literature; it is hardly banned; also it
is less self-conscious in the modes it
adopts to express the agony of the
South African situation. The result has
been that popular urban African music
has provided a glaring paradigm of
what is happening to the underground
life of the nation.
The music is predominantly African,
which is as it should be, considering
the dominant numbers of Africans in
the country; but it is also eclectic; it
provides a moving illustration of cultu¬
ral diffusion in that part of the continent
which offers us the best laboratory for
the marriage of African and European
techniques and for the coming together
of European and African modes of
expression. Indeed, the phrase "popu¬
lar music" is meaningless if used in the
European sense of a music which offers
us fantasies about life, for South Afri¬
can urban music is nearer to the
blues.
hile black literature from
the Republic offers us glimpses into
an appalling situation of rare brutality
and anguish, the music not only shows
us this but goes further to affirm what
we should have known all along that
the oppressed in South Africa also
display an amazing form of resilience,
emotional certitude and optimism. On
the other hand, apartheid deprives
white South Africans of any real parti¬
cipation in such robust forms of
cultural expression.
In a short article of this nature one
cannot enlarge too much on this theme
but there is just one more disturbing
aspect trythe present cultural situation
in SoutK Africa which must be touched
upon; and that is the fear of the written
word as well as the brutality practised
against it.
It seems to me impossible to dis¬
cuss culture without discussing lan¬
guage; and language in the Repub¬
lic of South Africa seems to be work¬
ing under the severest of strains.
There are totalitarian regimes in the f\4
world, of course, in which language is ¿\\
subverted, debased, and made to serve
the interests of the regime by first

being raped and then being asked
to declare love for that which it loathes.
George Orwell's essay on this subject
and more recently George Steiner's
writings on German literature are
instructive.
White South Africans are prevented
from "naming" those emotions which
they may experience but which are not
sanctioned by the State, or they are
asked to give the opposite names to
what they truly feel. This is clearly
playing havoc with language, some¬
thing which is the very essence of
culture.
Consider, for example, what the
South Africans mean by immorality. In
South Africa a love affair between
black and white is regarded as unna¬
tural; therefore a law has been put on
the Statute Book called "The Immo¬
rality Act" which has nothing to do
with immoral acts as we understand
them: it simply means black and white
couples who feel love for one another,
even if they wish to marry.

he legislation by which
African students were deprived of
university education in the so-called
"white universities" is called "The
Extension of University Education Act";
the act by which the movement of the
Africans in urban areas was more
rigidly controlled was called "Abolition
of Passes and Co-ordination of Docu¬
ments Act.
I have to explain here that the Afri¬
cans are compelled to carry identity
documents called "passes" by which
their movements are controlled; there
have been more riots about "passes"
in South Africa than about any other
issue.
Therefore naming legislation which
was to secure a far more rigid control
of black people "Abolition of Passes"
takes on a more sinister implication as
soon as one remarks on that phrase
"Co-ordination of documents" for in¬
deed one begins to wonder what is
being "co-ordinated" if the law requir¬
ing Africans to carry "passes" is being
abolished.
This kind of abuse of language is
only indicative of a certain malaise
which is paralysing South African cul¬
ture. It is also indicative of a malaise
which compels the young, more expe¬
rimental Afrikaans writers to search
for a more poetic, transcendentalist,
symbolic language in order to comment
even remotely on the South African
situation. Otherwise it is doubtful
whether their writing, controlled as it
is by the Afrikaans publishers, would
ever see the light of day. In this res¬
pect both the literary pieces and the
paintings of a young Afrikaans writer
like Breyten Breytenbach become of
the utmost significance (see p. 27).
Apartheid and the 'All Blacks'
A white team cannot compete against a non-white team, nor can a white sprinter run in
the same race as a non-white sprinter. The Government's policy of apartheid applies not
only to South African teams inside or outside South Africa but also to foreign teams
visiting South Africa. The New Zealand "All Blacks" rugby team was due to visit South
Africa in 1967. New Zealand proposed to include in its team two Maoris. But the Prime
Minister of South Africa made a public statement: "Just as we' respect other people's
customs so we expect that when other countries visit us they will respect ours and that
they adapt themselves to our customs." The "All Blacks" decided not to tour South
Africa in 1967.

Sports stadiums in predominantly white
areas may in general be used by whites
only. Exceptionally, permission may be
granted to non-whites to attend major
events provided separate seating is made
available. As far as minor events are
concerned, coloureds and Asians may be
admitted to grounds so situated that white
residents are not disturbed. Above: an
enthusiastic supporter at a rugby match.
HE world knows a great
deal about apartheid. It knows it as a
repressive political system which
denies political representation to
14,000,000 South Africans because
they are not white; it knows it as a
divisive social system which keeps
people apart, dividing them ruthlessly
on rigid colour lines and punishing
those who try to cross these lines.
But the effects of apartheid in terms
of social behaviour and on cultural
development are less well known.
To understand the effects of apart¬
heid it is necessary to think of the
daily lives of the people and the ways
in which their lives are regulated by
apartheid both in law and in social
conventions.
It means standing for hours in a
bus-queue, because there are too few
buses specially set aside for black
people; it means having to pass thea¬
tres and swimming pools with no
thought of ever entering them, because
they are set aside for white people;
and because the restrictions extend to
the thoughts people think, and because
the laws apply to both black and
white, it means that all people in South
Africa are denied the right to read
certain books because the government
believes them to be subversive of its
apartheid society.
Apartheid means that outstanding
sportsmen like the cricketer Basil
D'OIiviera, the footballer Steve Ma-
kone, the weightlifter Precious Mac¬
kenzie could never represent their own
country because they were not white;
that singers and actors like Miriam
Makeba and Lionel Ngakane would be
restricted because of their colour to
appearing in certain places and before

certain audiences a coloured cast
could perform Verdi's "La Traviata"
but no non-whites could attend a per¬
formance before the State President.
The list of restrictions is endless
these are only a few small examples.
But what they add up to is an isolation
of the people a division which breeds
bitterness and hostility. At sports
events, if white and black spectators
are present, they support opposing
sides and the result is friction so
much so that in many grounds only
white spectators are allowed.
Small things show the effects of
apartheid: When I tried to take my high
school pupils to the theatre because
"King Lear" which was their prescribed
work was playing, they were turned
back: when, as part of my studies, I
tried myself to see an Afrikaans play,
the ticket sold to me in error was taken
from me and I was refused entry: often
I have seen small children being
chased away from the swings in the
park playgrounds their only offence
was that they were black. And in the
few churches which white and black
can still attend together, the blacks
kneel at the back, go to Communion
after the whites.
It is illegal for white and black to
play chess together South Africa
continues to be a member of the World
Chess Federation in spite of this chess
apartheid. And whites who tried to
play football in a team with black
members were prosecuted in the
courts.
Of course white and black live in
different areas and it is not difficult
to pick out the houses for blacks
poor tin shacks, or at best, monoto¬
nous cubes of cement built by the
council housing schemes.
And in a society where these ugly
barriers exist, it is better to pretend
that they are not there. The result is
that the writers and poets of white
South Africa are incapable of pro¬
ducing any work which truthfully
reflects their society; and so deep has
this kind of blindness entered that no
work of any real worth has been pro¬
duced in South Africa for many years.
Perhaps one might expect the writers
among the blacks, in a situation full of
tension and bitterness and pain, to
produce works which live. But for
them apartheid presents another prob¬
lem; to be frank is to be banned.
And so talented writers like Alex la
Guma were silenced by banning or¬
ders, or others, like Alfred Hutchinson
and Bloke Modisane fled the country
to evade arrest. Some have faced
greater tragedy; for Nat Nakasa the
pledge he was required to sign to
leave his country and never return
proved too much; he committed suicide
in New York.
Even white writers André Brink, for
instance who have dared to criticise,
or appear to criticise, the apartheid
society have suffered. Their works
have been banned, or they have been
savagely attacked by the official
spokesmen of apartheid.
The failure of writers to write, or of
people to understand each other all
these are indications of the deeper
evil; the failure of communication. But
what is little understood by the outside
world is that this is a failure legislated
for. It is a failure which has been
deliberately designed.
It is the intention of those who have
constructed the apartheid society, and
who intend that it should endure indefi¬
nitely, that those who make up the
society should be prevented from com¬
municating with each other. Black and
white must be cut off from each other,
must be unable to communicate. It is
on this division that apartheid rests.
This is the true meaning of apartheid.
And it is this that inflicts the true terri¬
ble wound on South African society.
B,'UT the real damage is in
daily human relations. I have seen
white children standing in one of the
mixed buses rather than sit beside any¬
one who was not white and this seems
to me so complete a rejection of an¬
other human person that it goes much
further than the division and separation
enjoined by law. From this kind of
rejection comes a complete lack of any
feeling of common humanity; the suff¬
ering of a human being ceases to be
real because he has ceased to be a
real human being.
In an atmosphere like this, it is easy
for children at play to imagine them¬
selves shooting a few blacks. It is
equally easy for blacks to think of
massacring whites in revenge for the
many injustices they suffer.
This is the situation which has been
created in South Africa today. The
tensions are real, the threat of a vio¬
lent eruption constant. And this must
not be thought of simply as something
which the politicians say, or which is
the product of political factors or argu¬
ments. It is a simple truth that human
relations between people have deterio¬
rated so far, and have been so barri¬
caded against by apartheid laws, that
dialogue, understanding, friendship
all these are impossible.
This is the effect of apartheid in
terms of the society this is its all per¬
vasive extent: it breeds, if it breeds
anything, hostility: often the result is
simply the bitter sterility which will
engender violence.
RONALD SEGAL, author and journalist, was
born in South Africa in 1932. After graduat¬
ing from the University of Cape Town, he
took a further degree at Cambridge, having
previously played a leading part in South
Arican student organizations. After a short
stay in the United States where he had a
fellowship at the University of Virgina, he
returned to South Africa and established the
quarterly "Africa South" which quickly became
an international front against racism. Nine
days after the Sharpeville shootings, Segal
fled South Africa to escape arrest. He
settled in England where he published "Africa
South in Exile" until 1961 when he became
editor of Penguin Books' African library. In
1963, he published his autobiography "Into
Exile". The following year he convened in
London the International Conference on
Economic Sanctions against South Africa.
His most recent book is "The Race War"

### 59668: The Dying minds
I T is piteous and appalling,
the ecstasy in which all but a very
few whites in South Africa pursue
their own degradation. There are
those among the victims of apartheid,
white and non-white, who consum¬
mate themselves in their refusal to
submit, discovering in resistance a
courage and a loyalty and a love that
seem1 the final meaning of humanity.
But inevitably apartheid degrades
many of its victims. There are those
who give way under torture by the
political police, betraying their collea¬
gues and so, desperately, themselves;
there are those who take service with
their own subjugation, as informers
and police, or like the docile chiefs
as administrative instruments, seeking
sanctuary in a little power and a pre¬
tended indifference to contempt; and
there are those, the still silent majority,
who do not resist, and whose degra¬
dation is their own shame, the vio¬
lence that they do, passively, to them¬
selves. Yet these, the acquiescent,
the betrayers, even the collaboration¬
ists, are the afflicted; and their
awareness of affliction secures them
from that other, deeper degradation,
the atrophy of the mind.
For there are those who afflict and
do not care, or deliberately cease to
know any longer enough to care. In
white South Africa the repugnant
quickly becomes the ordinary; and the
ordinary, the ignored. A new law yet
further savaging the lives of the non-
whites, in the cause of security or
separate racial development, stirs a
short rustle of consideration and then
settles into the unnoticed natural way
of life.
IHE emaciation of white
thought is everywhere evident. The
organs of fundamental opposition have
been suppressed or survive only under¬
ground. The English-language news¬
papers, once the source of a vociferous
if superficial questioning, are now
overwhelmingly subservient to the
demands of white supremacy.
Where the persecution of a few bold
journalists and the steady encroach¬
ments of censorship have not suc¬
ceeded, the prosperity of racial re¬
pression has promoted an eager sur¬
render. Indeed, like the official parlia¬
mentary opposition, the bulk of the
English-language press has taken to
attacking the government, when at all,
for being too liberal and endangering
white rule by bothering about separate
development for non-whites. Criticism
is safe only if it is directed at clearer,
closer, still more certain domination.

to find their way through underground
passages of rebellion.
From the bookshops and the libra¬
ries, private as well as public, dis¬
appears an ever lengthening list of
banned books, pamphlets and news¬
papers, published abroad or once upon
a time legally in South Africa itself.
Yet this is not sufficient to stop up the
leaks of intellectual enquiry.
The government bans the more
feared of its opponents not only from
all gatherings, but from the publication
of any statement anywhere in the
country. How much further can fear
of the single mind, of the individual
struggle against the atrophy of
thought, be taken?
The truth is that fear is far more
profound within the white community
than the non-white. The non-whites
fear the whites; the whites fear not
only the non-whites, but themselves.
The Immorality Act has made sexual
relations between white and non-white
punishable by long imprisonment and,
among whites, social horror. Yet the
number of contraventions steadily
mounts, with an embarrassing parade
of such responsible whites as Dutch

police brought before the courts.
There is fear at the consequences for
even the pretence of white race purity
in such flouting of the law, and deeper
fear still at the consequences which
might attend scrapping the law alto¬
gether.
And who is white? After more than
300 years of miscegenation, few fami¬
lies beyond first generation immigrants
can feel confident of a completely
colourless pedigree. The Population
Registration Act provides all South
Africans with compulsory racial classi¬
fication and suitable identity cards so
that, as the Minister of the Interior
declared in 1958, "To many a certainty
has been given that they never had
before."
But fear is not removed by such offi¬
cial adjudication; if anything it is for¬
tified. For now there are formal enqui¬
ries, with race tribunals, and whispers
or unco-operative genes can soon
enough cancel, beyond concealment,
one classification for another.
Fear breeds, indeed, around the very
source of protection against fear.
Whites who indulge only their imagin¬
ation by supposing themselves of
interest to the political police, whose
views are no less orthodox than the
conventions of parliamentary opposi¬
tion can comfortably contain, refuse to
discuss, politics on the telephone or
admit any criticism of the government
in private letters. The frenzy with
which many whites pursue luxury and
leisure their obsession with sport is
internationally remarked cries out
their fear of the risks in any interest
demanding more of the mind.
The refusal to think at all offers
itself as the one escape route from
fear. For, surely, to think is to reco¬
gnize the implications of racial repress¬
ion, and to reject its capacity to sur¬
vive in a sane world. And so white
South Africans perpetuate their privi¬
leges by surrendering their minds, and
in the name of civilization sacrifice
civilization's essence.
What is left is fear and the appetite
for domination, feeding insatiably upon
each other. If is the gangrene of huma¬
nity, and its amputation is imperative
if the sickness is not everywhere to
spread. History belongs to the victims,
for their human purpose is in their very
suffering sustained.

THE EFFECTS OF APARTHEID ON CULTURE
The fettered spirit
by Breyten Breytenbach
"I want to express by means
of the plague the suffocation
from which we all suffered,
and the atmosphere of men¬
ace and exile in which we
all lived." (Albert Camus.)
T
HERE are certain concepts
and principles which, in the Republic
of South Africa, must be stated and
restated until one is blue in the face.
This is necessary because of the con¬
stant modification, erosion and exploi¬
tation these concepts undergo in the
country at the present time. To the
extent that leaders and members of
the white community justify their laws
and actions and aspirations in terms of
the universally accepted meanings of
these concepts and principles, the
pretence must be shown up. One must
apply this constant debunking to nearly
every form of organized human acti¬
vity: education, legality and the laws,
politics, the racial concept, the right to
work, trade unions, private and public
BREYTEN BREYTENBACH is an Afrikaner
writer, poet and painter. He was born in
1939 in South Africa and studied art at the
University of Cape Town. In 1960 he left
South Africa and travelled around the world.
He now lives and works in Paris as a
painter. Exhibitions of his works have been
held in several European countries and in the
United States. A writer in Afrikaans, he is
the author of several collections of poems
and essays and a volume of short prose
pieces entitled "Katastrofes".
business, travel, marriage and the free
association of individuals, etc. And, of
course, culture. And here, we touch
not only upon the organized manifes¬
tation of culture, but also the right and
freedom of the individual to create,
to entertain or be entertained, to think,
to express himself to laugh or to cry.
Culture, to me, is the uttering of a
nation's dreams, hopes, fears, fantasies
and desires. It is national insofar as
the individual or group of individuals
formulating and expressing these, be¬
long to a nation sharing a common
heritage, living in the same country,
exploring a mutual present and mould¬
ing a brighter future. Culture is the
way in which the members of a nation
find themselves and their countrymen.
It should never be a privilege the free
expression of culture through the visual
and performing arts and literature, and
politically free access to cultural mani¬
festations should be a right never even
questioned. This is patently not the
case in South Africa.
Tribal white man has imposed a way
of life on the nation which has reduced
culture to folklore, or rather, has den¬
ied the progression from folklore to
culture. Apartheid, which puts the
accent on and favours that which
distinguishes one group from another,
inevitably means the glorification of
the banal and the local as opposed to
the original and the universal (or even
merely national): handicrafts and post¬
cards as opposed to sculpture and
painting, the beating of the tom-toms as
opposed to the discovery and enjoy¬
ment of richer musical forms, inferior
journalism as opposed to creative
writing.
Freedom is inseparable. There can
be no rich cultural life when man can
hardly aspire to the possibility of
attaining political and economic free¬
dom.
In which way does apartheid then
destroy culture? It seems senseless to
point to recent laws which, for example,
prohibit racially mixed audiences or
create a board of censorship so ob¬
viously politically motivated. Com¬
plaining about these is what I would
term "giving battle", a token (or real)
resistance to what is considered ex¬
cessive whereas the whole Ideology
underlying apartheid must be abolish¬
ed before we can think in terms of
culture, and therefore in terms of
human dignity. Advocating the libe¬
ralization of a situation is another way
of condoning the status quo. It is
like treating the patient for bilharzia
without purifying the water.
It is the basic ideology of the white
people in power (and those they re¬
present) as embodied in all the apart¬
heid laws, which denies culture and
human dignity to all the people of
South Africa, including themselves.
And this ideology is one of Chris¬
tian-Nationalism or Calvinist-Tribalism
by which one tribe is trying to perpe¬
tuate itself (according to the image it
has of itself) by monopolizing all power
and dictating to the other tribes their
supposed lines and forms of cultural,
political and economic development.
This development must always exist in
relation to the white man's central per¬
petuation of exclusive power. This tribe
dictates to its own members in that
it refuses any opposition to or ques¬
tioning of its ideology of supremacy
which may undermine the monolithic
power structure.
flPARTHEID stifles the cultu¬
ral contributions of the black, brown
and yellow man but in its denial of
morality, humanism and dignity, it is
probably well on its way towards kil¬
ling the contribution of the white man.
Other contributors will be able to
show in greater detail how the apart¬
heid laws prevent the growth of cul¬
ture, or affect the existing culture.
My intention is more general to try
and define this death for myself.
Apartheid is the big effort to curb the
forming of a South African nation
politically, economically, culturally and
therefore also racially which should
be one of the most normal things on
earth given our interdependence and

mutually hybrid origins. And culture and
cultural exponents would have been
the links. Now it has become futile
to hope that one ethnic group may fer¬
tilize another, and the brittle contact
established previously among writers,
artists and musicians of the different
groups is being dismantled progres¬
sively. It seems to be part of a
general movement of contraction and
falling apart a cultural and national
death wish.
At this stage of the contraction and
the spasm we have influential cultural
leaders of the Afrikaans community
asking the Government to stop the
flow of immigrants from non-Germanic
countries (as they fear the extinction
of Afrikaans culture) while launching
a campaign to replace English by Afri¬
kaans among the "Bantu."
We are going to have a new law to
be tabled during the present Parliamen¬
tary session which is to seek the
prohibition of one race "interfering"
in the political affairs of another: the
Prohibition of Improper Interference
Bill. For political affairs read anything
from social gatherings to plays or jam
sessions or writers' discussions.
One would hardly have thought it
necessary to pass new restrictive
laws. It is estimated that 1,800 people
were punished without trial for their
political beliefs in recent years. At
the moment, there are about 70 people
under house arrest, 600 more are ban¬
ned or restricted, another 40 are liv¬
ing in banishment in remote areas
and over 2,000 people are in prison
as 90 and 180-day detainees.
Every Government Gazette adds to
the list of people whose creative
works are no longer allowed in South
Africa. The Classic, a literary quar¬
terly had this to say in a recent issue:
"Classic regrets... present rules that
writers of the calibre of Ezekiel
Mphahlele, Lewis Nkosi, Can Themba,
Todd Matshakiza, Bloke Modisane,
can no longer be read in the maga¬
zine or country." There are many
more.
It is not surprising. In the atmo¬
sphere engendered by these laws one
can see how simple human acts or
the description thereof can be given
quite fantastic values, interpretations
and implications. For a black man to
kiss a white woman is revolutionary.
If this act were to be described (enthu¬
siastically!) by a writer in a book or
on stage, or even shown by a painter,
the life of the work would be endan¬
gered. And in this environment unfor¬
tunately a "literary" or "artistic-

the musician must use It as such, and
use it to fight for political freedom,
for dignity and for justice. Man only
lives in other men, he only expresses
his dreams in human terms, his only
real fear is of other men. It should
be up to the individual to decide how
much "message" or propaganda his
work can carry, and in which form.
Already the final decay has set in
in South Africa's cultural world. If
the coloured people of Cape Town
can no longer attend concerts in the
now all-white City Hall, then music
must eventually suffer. If our painters
are relegated to painting esoteric
pastoral scenes and "Bantu" motifs,
then our paintings will be just decor¬
ations on the wall. If plays with a
mixed cast can no longer be staged,
then the spirit of the theatre must
become atrophied. The non-white
writer may, if he is lucky, leave the
country for a bitter exile. If the white
writer, to be able to continue writing,
must compromise his humanism (his
love) for apartheid is practised also
in his name then the illness has
touched and discoloured the very
blood of his being, and his writing
will be an aberration of European
culture. Perhaps the fact that no Afri¬
kaans writer has been banned yet, is
a measure of this.
And that Is where the catch lies.
Most white South Africans have sim¬
ply never opened their eyes to the

inspires it will be impossible for

### 59675: South Africa's wasted manpower
SOUTH AFRICA'S
WASTED MANPOWER
Every year since 1965 the International Labour Organization has carried
out a survey of developments in connexion with the apartheid policy
as it affects labour. The following text is condensed from the 1966
survey (1). Examining the economic consequences of racial discrimination
in South Africa, the report notes that apartheid artificially obstructs
the flow of potential skilled manpower which South Africa needs to a
growing extent and that the Government seeks to keep this movement
under control, even at the expense of greater prosperity.
S
30
OUTH Africa is outstand¬
ingly rich in minerals. It has for gener¬
ations been the world's chief producer
of gold, output of which continues to
rise. It is the second largest producer
of diamonds, chrome and asbestos,
has the world's largest known reserves
of uranium, and vast reserves of iron
and coal. It is also a large producer of
copper, limestone and manganese.
Agriculture, which with 30 per cent, of
the economically active population at
the time of the 1960 census employed
more labour than any other sector,
produces many and varied products
both for internal consumption and
export.
Manufacturing has experienced par¬
ticularly rapid growth in the past
20 years, and now constitutes the
largest sector of the economy in terms
of output, accounting for a quarter of
the national product. South Africa
which employs a higher proportion of
its African population in the modern
sector than any other African country
has the most developed and diversified
economy in the entire continent.
These developments have materially
affected the composition and utilization
of South Africa's labour force, setting
off trends which are a growing chal¬
lenge to the purported objectives and
basic policies of apartheid. Thus,
instead of the separate development of
at least Africans and Europeans in their
own territories, economic development
Is drawing an ever greater number of
the former into the white areas, creat¬
ing a symbiotic relationship in which
the African worker is becoming in¬
creasingly dependent on wage-earning

General on the application of the Declaration

in the white economy and at the same
time ever more indispensable to it.
The increasing demands for skilled
manpower and the insufficient supply
of white labour to meet them are
also opening up to the non-white popu¬
lations rungs in the industrial ladder
to which conventional as well as statu¬
tory colour bars previously denied them
access, thus giving them a growing
stake in the white economy.
The strained manpower position has
likewise served to emphasize the eco¬
nomic wastefulness of the migratory
labour system and the colour bar,
which reduce the volume of produc¬
tively employed African labour, perpe¬
tuate instability and low productivity
and bar the way to utilization of vast
potential sources of skill.
T,
HE inflationary pressures
in the South African economy have
increased the urgency of making more
rational use of the country's man¬
power resources. Unless opportunities
for training of Africans are substan¬
tially increased and African education
adapted accordingly, the depressive
effect of apartheid on the quality of the
labour force will become an ever grea¬
ter drag on South Africa's industrial
progress.
African manpower in the white eco¬
nomy is treated as an imported commo¬
dity, as undifferentiated labour units
deprived of ordinary human rights: the
rights to free choice of employment,
to security of residence and employ¬
ment, to the development of Inherent
capacities, to a say in how the eco¬
nomy of which it forms an essential
component should be run.
That Is why the South African Gov¬
ernment maintains its adherence to
the migratory labour system, influx
control, the colour bar and the denial
of trade union rights to Africans.
Whatever the new openings and mat¬
erial improvements which South Afri¬
ca's spectacular development are
bringing within the reach of its non-
white population, the status reserved
for African workers in an economy
wedded to the principle of white domi¬
nation is thus scarcely distinguishable
from one of servile labour. The con¬
tradictions inherent in such a situation
are pregnant with danger to the
country's social peace.
The measure of bitterness engen¬
dered by apartheid is to be found in
the repressive apparatus which has
had to be built up concurrently with the
progressive development of apartheid
laws and practice in the social and
economic spheres. Without attempting
any exhaustive enumeration, it should
be remembered that the repressive
measures adopted include hangings,
detention without trial, house arrest,
and bannlngs of persons, organizations
and publications. To maintain apart¬
heid, South Africa is living in a per¬
manent state of emergency.
Parallel with these internal difficul¬
ties, on the international level South
Africa finds itself in a position of
isolation ¡n a world hostile to the
course upon which it is set. The Inter¬
national Labour Organization is not the
only organization from which it has
withdrawn under the pressure of inter¬
national opinion. South Africa left the
United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (Unesco) in
1955, and in 1964 it withdrew from the
Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations. It has been
expelled from the United Nations Eco¬
nomic Commission for Africa and has
resigned from the Commission for
Technical Co-operation in Africa. Its
participation in the Scientific Council
of Africa has likewise ceased.

### 59675: South Africa's wasted manpower
In 1964, the apartheid
rules were provisionally
made more flexible
so as to allocate
African miners to
certain supervisory
tasks. In 1965, the
Government terminated
this experiment
"in view of the
detrimental implications
involved". Yet the
International Labour
Organization's report
stresses that South
Africa continues to
suffer from a serious
shortage of skilled
labour. The
Government's economic
development plan
forecasts that in 1969
there will be a shortage
of 47,000 white
workers, but at the
same time there will
be 240,000 non-white
unemployed.
ca's racial policies and consequential
repressive measures have been under
Investigation by a special committee,
and the whole pressure of world opin¬
ion has been brought to bear on the
South African Government to aban¬
don a policy held to constitute a threat
to international peace and security.
Because of its tremendous wealth
and developed institutions, South
Africa could play a major part in pro¬
moting the progress of the African
continent, through investments, trade
and technical assistance. An extended
market for South African goods would
not only greatly strengthen the coun¬
try's industry, but also bring immea¬
surable benefits to the entire Southern
African region.
The educational system, now biased
in favour of the white population, could
help to spread literacy. The country
could offer advanced technical know¬
ledge and participate in fighting dis¬
ease. However, the possibilities for all
such developments must remain strictly
limited so long as South Africa's pre¬
sent racial policies are pursued.
No country can easily bring itself to
reconstruct the very bases of its body
politic, particularly in relation to an
Issue so charged with passion as
apartheid.
The choice lies between a stunted,
frustrated, bitter and isolated society
and a community built on purposeful,
constructive co-operation both within
the national borders and within the
wider family of nations.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
From the Unesco Report on Apartheid
32
Apartheid and African rights
During the reading of the 1964 Bantu Laws Amendment Act,
a Nationalist Party member of the House of Assembly, Mr. Grey-
ling, stated that "there is no such thing as 'the rights of a Bantu'
in the White area. The only rights he has are those which he
acquires by performing certain duties. Those duties which he
performs give him the right of sojourn here. The officials in
the labour bureaux, in considering whether they are going to
allow a Bantu to remain here, will have to give priority to the
consideration of whether that Bantu has carried out his duties
as a worker, and not whether he has a supposed right which
has been invented for him by members of the United Party."
Apartheid and international news
One of the South African Government's main aims is to see
that international information is slanted so as to conform with
its general policy and particularly its apartheid policy. Everything
possible is done to prevent the introduction into the country of
overseas information deemed "undesirable" from this angle.
Apartheid and films
Films for Africans are subject to strict censorship. Most
countries have some sort of film censorship but in South Africa
it is used as an instrument to further "separate development."
The Censorship Board may prohibit the showing of films before
a particular race or class. On many occasions it has decided
that, while a film may be shown in a non-white cinema, children
between 4 and 16 together with Africans may not be admitted.
There is a tendency to ban any film which does not present
non-whites as inferior to whites.
Apartheid and creative writing
Commenting on the situation of creative writers in South
Africa, the exiled African author Ezekiel Mphahlele pointed out
that, "Our energies go into this conflict to such an extent that
we don't have much left for creative work. One might ask,
'Why could this not be a spur towards creative writing?' I think
it is paralysing. . . We are in two ghettoes, two different streams,
and you can't get really dynamic art in this kind of society. You
won't get a great white novel, I think, and you won't get a great
black novel until we become integrated. As soon as the white
man has learned to realize that he is an African and no longer
a European, he will then begin to write an African novel or an
African poem."
Apartheid and sport
In 1963, the South African Olympic and National Games Asso¬
ciation (SAONGA) was reminded by the Minister of the Interior
that participation in international sports competitions by mixed
teams representing South Africa as a whole could in no circums¬
tances be approved. South Africa was unable to take part in the
1964 Tokyo Olympic Games.
The International Table Tennis Federation refused to recognize
the all-white South African Table Tennis Association as the
negotiating body for South Africa.
South Africa was asked to leave the International Football Asso¬
ciation.
In sport, as in drama, as in entertainment, South Africa black
and white is becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of
the world.
Apartheid and libraries
In Durban there are 11 municipal library depots and one
reference library for whites, one library for coloureds and one
branch library for Africans. In the Orange Free State there is
a free "whites only" library service and no similar service for
Africans. The demand for books, moreover, is governed by the
African's social and economic situation: he often grows up in
a home where there are no books, he has little money to spend
on them and he has had few opportunities to acquire a taste for
reading. Regarding school libraries, the poverty of the book
stock in non-white public libraries makes it impossible to supple¬
ment the inadequate book supply of the non-white school libraries.
In 1959, of the films provided for library users, 2,319 films were
screened for Europeans and 180 for non-Europeans.
Apartheid and social science
Social science field work in South Africa is greatly hampered
by the apartheid policy. Permission to carry out research in a
"Bantu Reserve" is essential and may be withdrawn at any time
without any reason being given. . . Field workers have the
impression that they are under continuous police surveillance and
are permanently apprehensive that they may lose their permits
to work in specific areas or, in the case of foreigners, their permits
to remain in South Africa. Even more serious is the suspicion and
hostility displayed by the people being studied. Even where
there is no open hostility there may- well be a reluctance to
talk since any white investigator is regarded as likely to be a
local official or a member of the special branch.
Apartheid and education
In 1965, the salaries paid to African teachers were less than
half those earned by white teachers---41-9 per cent for men and
37.9 per cent for women. In 1965, the gap widened when white
teachers salaries were raised. It is impossible to claim that sepa¬
rate development in education promotes good race relations. The
inequalities inherent in the educational system would in themselves
be damaging to racial harmony but one of the aims of the educa¬
tional system set in policy statements by both the Government and
influential groups in the white sectors of society is group natio¬
nalism.
Apartheid and the universities
The extension to higher education of the principle of separate
development has had serious repercussions on the universities.
In 1961 it was reported that 25 staff members from Cape Town
had left, that Natal had lost 35 and that eight professorships, nine
senior lectureships and nine lectureships were vacant at the
University of the Witwatersrand. Some of the scientists who
have left had played a major part in the intellectual life of the
country. And losses have continued on a considerable scale.
Apartheid and beaches
Racial zoning has been extended to beaches and, in December
1965, the Minister for Planning announced that the beaches of the
municipal areas should be allocated to different population groups.
Certain beaches, traditionally used by non-whites, but situated
opposite areas reserved for white residential districts, were
henceforward to be used by whites only.
Apartheid and the theatre
In conjunction with the anti-apartheid movement, playwrights in
Great Britain, U.S.A., France and Ireland have instructed their
agents "to insert a clause in all future contracts automatically
refusing performing rights in any theatre where discrimination is
made among audiences on grounds of colour." The protest by
foreign writers arose from their personal abhorrence of the evil
of racism, but their action was based on the Berne Convention
which gives artists and authors the legal right to authorize the
publication and performance of their works. In 1965, South
Africa passed a new Copyright Act, including a clause designed
to prevent authors from prohibiting the performance of their
works in South Africa on ideological grounds. . .

### 59678: Apartheid and the church
APARTHEID
AND THE CHURCH
s EVENTY two per cent of
all South Africans and 94 per cent of
all white South Africans are Christians.
The doctrinal approach of the Dutch
Reformed Churches in South Africa
to race relations was that the Dutch
Reformed Church "could not associate
itself unreservedly with the general
cry for equality and unity in the world
today ... It is mostly a surrogate unity
and brotherhood, that men seek to
realize without Christ in a world
disrupted by sin . . ." The unity of
man already exists in Christ, and is
a supernatural organic unity... One
of the factors causing the imperfect
realization of the existing unity in
Christ is racial contrasts and racial
tensions, in South Africa as in the
rest of the world.
In April 1950 a conference of Dutch
Reformed Churches was held at Bloem-
fontein to define the church's policy
towards the African. Apartheid was de¬
fined as a way which seeks to lead each
section of the people In the clearest
and quickest way to its own destination
under the gracious providence of God.
The only way in which the permanent
subordination of one group to another
could be avoided was by total
separation; the nature reserves were
to be converted into true "Bantu
Homelands" with full opportunity for
development and self-government and
the replacing of the African in the
European industrial system.
After the riots at Sharpeville and
Langa in March 1960, nine leading
ministers of the Nederdultse Gerefor-
meerde Kerk issued a statement,
which, after protesting the "continuous
besmirching of our country, people
and church by untrue and slanted
information," and declaring that the
condemnations of South Africa "do
not always spring from Christian
responsibility but show signs of...
the hysterical efforts of the West to
overbid the East for the ' favour of
the non-whites of Africa for the sake
of the ideological slogan of self-deter¬
mination," went on to say:
"The Nederduitse Gereformeerde
Kerk has made it clear . . . that it can
approve of independent, distinctive
development, provided that it is carried
out in a just and honourable way,
without impairing or offending human
dignity. The Church has also accepted
that this policy, especially in its initial
stages, would necessarily cause a
certain amount of disruption and
personal hardship, for example, in
connexion with the clearing of slums.
The whole pass system must be seen
in this light."
The nine ministers issuing this
statement then approved of the prin¬
ciples of the policy of apartheid, but
also called for an improvement of
the wage structure for Africans, that
non-whites be treated by whites in a
more dignified manner so as not to
reap a harvest of hate and that "re¬
sponsible and law-abiding" non-whites
should not be "misled by the false
promises of agitators who are not
concerned about the utmost good of
the non-whites . . ."
In December 1960, as a result of an
Initiative on the part of the Anglican
Archbishop of Cape Town who had
publicly repudiated compulsory. segre¬
gation the World Council of Churches
sent a six-man delegation to consult
with representatives of its eight
member churches (1) at the Cottesloe
residence of the University of the
Witwatersrand. Five of the churches
sent inter-racial delegations.
T,
heir report, known as the
Cottesloe Consultation Report, stated
that while being united in rejecting all
unjust discrimination, widely divergent
views were held on the basic issues of
apartheid. Nevertheless it was possi¬
ble to make certain affirmations con¬
cerning human needs and justice as
they affected the races of South Africa:
No one who believed In Jesus Christ
should be excluded from any Church
on the grounds of colour or race;
adequate facilities should be provided
for non-white people to worship in
urban areas as well as in segregated
townships, there should be more

Transvaal, the Methodist, the Presbyterian,
the Congregational Union, the Bantu Pres¬

Kerk of the Cape, the Nederduitse Her-
vormde Kerk of Africa.
effective consultation between the
Government and the leaders accepted
by the non-white people, there were
no scriptural grounds for the prohi¬
bition of mixed marriages, although
certain legal, social and cultural factors
might make such marriages inadvi¬
sable.
It was pointed out that migrant
labour had a disintegrating effect on
African family life, that the vast
majority of non-white people received
wages which were below the generally
accepted minimum standard for healthy
living, that the job reservation system
should give way to a more equitable
method of employment, that the right
to own land where one was domiciled
and the right to participate in the
government of the country was part
of the dignity of all adult men.
S
imultaneously, the Neder¬
duitse Gereformeerde Kerk of the
Transvaal and the Cape Issued another
statement which said that a policy of
differentiation could be defended from
the Christian point of view and
provided the only realistic solution to
the problems of race relations. The
Nederduitse Hervormde Kerk of Africa
the next day issued a press statement,
In which they dissociated themselves
from the resolutions passed and re¬
affirmed their faith in racial separation
in the belief that the ideals of Chris¬
tianity would best be served in that
way.
Opposition to the Cottesloe report
continued to grow. During March 1961,
the Nederduitse Hervormde Kerk
Synod met and decided by 487 votes
to 13 to withdraw from membership
of the World Council of Churches.
The Transvaal Synod of the Neder¬
duitse Gereformeerde Kerk meeting
in April 1961 also decided to withdraw
from membership of the World Council
of Churches, since the Cottesloe reso¬
lutions were at variance with the
policy of the Church and were
embarrassing to the Government. In
October the Cape Nederduitse Gere¬
formeerde Kerk Synod decided by a QO
large majority to reject the Cottesloe UÜ
report as "undermining the policy of
separate development"; the Synod

also decided to leave the World
Council of Churches.
Individual members of the Dutch
Reformed Churches continued to
question South African racial attitudes.
In November 1960, 11 leading theo¬
logians of the Nederduitse Gerefor¬
meerde Kerk, the Nederduitse Her¬
vormde Kerk and the Gereformeerde
Kerk published a book "Vertraagde
Aksie" calling for a new outlook on
South African racial attitudes.
This resulted in the heresy trial of
Professor Geyser, one of the authors
of the book, before the Synodical
Commission of the Hervormde Kerk in
December 1961; he was found guilty
on one of three charges of heresy.
He decided to contest the findings in
the court of law, but an agreement
was reached out of court (in 1963) and
he was reinstated as a minister of
the Church.
In August 1963, the Christian Institute
of Southern Africa was established; it
was inter-racial and inter-denomi¬
national. The Director of the Institute
was the Rev. OF. Beyers Naudé, who
had been elected Moderator of the
Southern Transvaal Synod of the
Nederduitse Kerk, had defended the
Cottesloe resolutions and was editor
of an inter-church monthly magazine
Pro Veníate.
The Christian Institute came under
attack from certain Dutch Reformed
quarters. Prof. Verhoef of Stellen¬
bosch for example, felt that members
of the Christian Institute had made an
error in judgement: the Institute gave
the impression that it understood the
problems and the aspirations of the
Africans better than the "Boorekerk."
That apartheid is compatible with
Christianity has been denied by many
denominations in South Africa. The
Methodist Conference in 1947 and
1948 stated clearly that every human
being is entitled to fundamental human
rights. In 1952 the Conference
rejected the policy of apartheid as
being impracticable, contrary to the
interests of all sections of the South
African community and inconsistent
with the highest Christian principles.
This was reaffirmed in 1957, in 1958,
in 1959 and in 1960.
In 1960, the Conference
outlined a programme of Education in
Race Relations which included inter¬
racial study groups, pulpit exchanges
and visits between church organiza¬
tions. Moreover the possibility was to
be explored of setting up a pilot city
circuit scheme of a racially inclusive
Church.
In 1961 the Conference resolved to
proceed with the removal of racial
demarcation from its official records
and legislation. In 1963 the Confe¬
rence elected an African, the Rev. Seth
Mokitlmi as Its president.
The 1950 Provincial Synod of the
Church of the Province of South Africa
a self-governing church within the
worldwide Anglican communion (the
supreme legislature body within the
Church) made the following statement
on race relations:
"The Conference is convinced that
discrimination between men on
grounds of race alone is inconsistent
with the principles of Christ's Reli¬
gion . . . (we) believe that the effect
of much recent legislation is likely
to be the rigid division of the popu¬
lation into social classes with unequal
rights, privileges and opportunities,
and the relegation of the non-Euro¬
peans to a position of permanent
inferiority, and for this reason
condemns this legislation as incon¬
sistent with the respect for human
personality that should be characte¬
ristic of a Christian society..."
S1 everal Anglican clergymen
have made individual statements
against the policy of the South African
government. Trevor Huddleston has
protested particularly over the demoli¬
tion of Sophia Town; the Rev. Ambrose
Reeves has been outspoken in his
opposition to the government's policy
and was deported in September 1960;
the Rev. Michael Scott was imprisoned
for taking part in a non-violent
campaign against segregation, left
South Africa to take the case of South
West Africa to the U.N. and has not
been readmitted to South Africa.
In addition, in 1963 several Anglican
Bishops in South Africa made state¬
ments condemning the apartheid
policies of the government. In 1963
the Minister of Foreign Affairs was
reported as having said at a Nationalist
Party meeting that the time had come
to tell the bishops that it was not In
the interests of their Church to inter¬
vene in South Africa's political issues.
The Synod of Bishops meeting in
November 1963 issued this statement:
"In these circumstances, it seems
necessary to the Bishops of the
Church of the Province of South
Africa, now meeting in Synod in
Bloemfontein, to reaffirm their
unanimity in proclaiming their con¬
viction that the Church must openly
and fearlessly condemn all that it
believes to be evil and false In the
social, political or economic life of
any nation and, whenever the claims
of obedience to the State and God
are in conflict, it is to God that our
obedience must be given."
In 1952, 1957, 1960 and 1962, the
Catholic Bishops of Southern Africa
issued joint pastoral letters on the
situation in South Africa. In 1957 the
pastoral letter entitled "Statement on
Apartheid" condemned apartheid and
went on to say: "there must be a
gradual change . . . but change must
come, for otherwise our country faces
a disastrous future . . . This involves
the elaboration of a sensible and just
policy enabling any person, irrespec
tive of race, to qualify, for the enjoy¬
ment of full civil rights . . ."
The pastoral letter of 1962 was
headed "We Dare Not Remain Silent"
and said in part: "As Christian people
we dare not remain silent and passive
in the face of the injustices inflicted
on members of the unprivileged racial
groups..." In July 1966 the Bishops
again denounced apartheid and all
forms of discrimination which it
engenders.
Since apartheid, two great theolo¬
gical debates are being fought out in
South Africa.
The first, illustrated by the position
taken by the Bishops of the Church
of the Province of South Africa, is an
old one the obedience which a
Christian subject should give to a
State which promulgates what he
holds to be intolerably evil laws and
the right of his leaders to criticize
these laws.
The second theological debate is
primarily a debate of this century, and
in its acute form was initiated precisely
by the system of apartheid In a country
whose leaders were prominent Chris¬
tians. It was the meaning to be given
to racial equality and whether or not
the doctrine of the brotherhood of all
Christians pre-supposed a multiracial
Church.
ithin South Africa the lines
drawn were principally between the
Dutch Reformed Church, on the one
hand, and the English speaking Church,
on the other. But even within these
groupings the argument continued.
Geyser and Naudé and others within
the Dutch Reformed Church took
theological positions not unlike those
of the Bishops of the English-speaking
Church and that in spite of the strong
sanctions which could be imposed on
them to conform to the main trend
of thinking of the members of their
congregations and of their Synods.
Within the English-speaking Churches,
too, there were some missionary
leaders who advocated separatism
for Africans.
This debate was not confined to
South Africa, it was part of the
worldwide ecumenical debate of the
1950s and 1960s, although certainly
by 1965 the idea of a multi-racial
church was accepted by most churches
outside South Africa, and racial
equality took on the meaning of
multi-racialism, as opposed to racial,
separatism in the statements of
major Christian religions. The Dutch
Reformed Churches in South Africa
are being increasingly isolated, nnt
only by the withdrawal of some of their
groups from the World Council of
Churches, but by their theological
assumptions on the question of race.
