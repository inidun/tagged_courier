Phoenician Hunting Scene
Processions of plants, animals and human figures are portrayed
in this detail (above) of a 2,700-year-old Phoenician silver dish
(right). Papyri, lions, gazelles, stags, archers and horsemen are
embossed and engraved in these scenes from the hunt. The Phoe¬
nicians traded with all the peoples of the Mediterranean basin
and were brilliantly skilful craftsmen in gold and silver whose
works have been found in Greece, Italy, Carthage and even Iraq.
Their civilization flourished on the eastern shores of the Medi¬
terranean in present-day Lebanon and Syria, as well as Carthage.

Illyria of yesterday
Albania of today
Archaeological excavations over the past 30 years
at hundreds of ancient sites have thrown new light
on the earliest ancestors of the Albanian people
by Muzafer Korkuti
I
MUZAFER KORKUTI, Albanian historian end
archaeologist, Is a leading authority and the
author of many studies on Albanian antiquity.
The article we publish here is based on a
special study by the author entitled in Alba¬
nian. "Shqiperia Arkeologiike' (Archaeolo¬
gical Albania), recently published in a tri¬
lingual {Albanian. French and English) edition
by the Archaeological Section of the Institute
of History and Languages at the National
University of Tirana (Albania).
|N 1948, workers draining
the Maliq marshes in southeast Albania
discovered potsherds, horn tools and
small flint knives embedded in the
mud of a drainage channel. Quite by
chance they had stumbled across an
important prehistoric site.
To appreciate the significance of
their find it is essential to under¬
stand the existing state of Albanian
archaeology and current theories on
the history and civilization of the
lllyrians and their direct descendants,
the Albanians.
At the beginning of this century, the
archaeological map of Albania was
virtually blank. The limited amount of
research that went on was the work of
foreign scholars who were mainly
interested in Greek and Roman civi¬
lization and hence confined their
attention to the Albanian coastal towns
which the Greeks and Romans had
colonized. Even those whose interests
ranged wider did not go into the fun¬
damental questions of lllyrian history.
Yet Albania is a country of ancient
culture and its soil has been inhabited
since prehistoric times. The lllyrians
were formidable warriors, as we know
from their stiff resistance to the
Romans between 6 and 9 A.D. They
were also skilful metal-workers and
potters.
Archaeological research
in recent years has shown
that Albania can boast
a continued period of
inhabitation going back
to prehistoric times. Left,

Nevertheless, the culture and civi¬
lization of the indigenous population
of Albania continued to be largely
ignored until the end of the Second
World War, which saw the birth of
Albanian archaeology as a scientific
discipline.
Albanian archaeologists began to
delve into the history of their country.
Some of their finds have been
sensational, and today they can look
back on nearly twenty-eight years of
systematic work which has illuminated
many previously obscure aspects of
lllyrian history.
They have excavated a large number
of settlements, fortresses and necro¬
polises from various periods, and the
fruits of their work can be seen in the
ancient castles which tower over the
city suburbs of modern Albania, in
fortified settlements deep in the heart
of the countryside, and in a host of
museums scattered about the country.
Albania currently boasts over 170
archaeological sites and new ones
open each year.
It had long been believed that the
lllyrians brought Iron Age civilization
to the Balkans, which they reached as .
part of a great wave of migrations from
Central Europe durino the second half
of the second millenium B.C. The
excavations at Maliq and elsewhere
were to disprove this.
For six years archaeologists worked
at Maliq. They discovered that the
site consisted of several layers, and
that it had been inhabited from the late
Neolithic Age (the first half of the
third millenium B.C.) until the late
Bronze Age (the end of the second
millenium B.C.).
The late Neolithic layer revealed the
remains of rectangular huts with wattle
and daub walls and clay floors. Each
hut had a space set aside for an oven.
Containers and potsherds of various
shapes and decoration were also
unearthed from this layer.
During the Aeneolithic Age (the
transitional period between the Neo¬
lithic Age and the Bronze Age), the
inhabitants of Maliq lived in l£\'<e
dwellings built on piles,- hundreds of
which were dug out during the exca¬
vations. Aeneolithic copper axes also
came to light, along with a rich
collection of pottery decorated with
geometric patterns on black and grey
glazes.
The Maliq site was inhabited right
through the Bronze Age, but by this
time the water level had dropped and
the huts were being built on the ground.
Most of the Bronze Age specimens at
Maliq were pots which had several
features in common with those from
the previous period, although some
new forms and designs had also been
developed.
Meanwhile, archaeologists were
learning more about the Bronze Age
population of present-day Albania from
excavations of tumuli on the Pazhok
plain near the city of Elbasan. Tumuli
earth and stone burial mounds
standing anything up to four metres
high have revealed a great deal of
information about lllyrian civilization,
for the lllyrians believed in a life after
death and were buried with objects
such as weapons, jewellery, pottery _.
and tools which would help them in **
the after-life. *>
After meticulous examination, it was
discovered that the Bronze Age tumuli

FROM ILLYRIA TO ALBANIA (Continued)
on the Pazhok plain bore a remarkable
resemblance to later, lllyrian Iron Age
tumuli at Kruma and Këneta in northern
Albania and at Vodhina and elsewhere
in the south. Both Bronze and Iron
Age tumuli had been built in the same
way and identical funeral rites had
been performed in each period.
Furthermore, there was a close simi¬
larity between the contents of the
Bronze and Iron Age graves. All this
indicated that the people buried in the
tumuli at each period belonged to the
same tribe.
Some extremely important middle
and late Bronze Age objects were
unearthed at Pazhok: bronze swords,
spears, daggers, oold and bronze
ornaments, and earthenware. The
pottery revealed several features of
the earlier Aeneolithic tradition and
suggested that the people who lived
there during the Bronze Age were
indigenous.
The experts' observations and con¬
clusions from their discoveries at
Pazhok and Maliq may be summed up
as follows.
First of all, the late Neolithic civi¬
lization discovered at Maliq (and at
another prehistoric site at Kamnik in
the Kolonja region) is in many ways
similar to contemporary cultures in the
nearby south and must be seen as
part of the great Balkan-Anatolian
cultural complex. This means that the
Maliq Neolithic civilization originated
in the southeast.
Secondly, the Aeneolithic popu¬
lation of Maliq also came from the
southeast. Thirdly, the Bronze Age
inhabitants of the region were the
direct descendants of the Aeneolithic
Age population, and the distinguishing
feature of their culture, their pottery,
inherited many characteristics from
that of the previous era.
Finally, this pottery has many new
features which have been found on
other Bronze Age sites in Albania and
which are also characteristic of lllyrian
Iron Age pottery.
All this evidence supports the
hypothesis that the Bronze Age civi¬
lization discovered in Albania is lllyrian,
and that the lllyrians were formed in
the Balkans and already existed as a
people by the beginning of the Bronze
Age. In other words lllyrian civilization
in Albania is much older than had been
thought.
One of the main fields in which
Albanian archaeologists have been
active has been research into lllyrian
civilization during the Iron Age, when
it reached its apogee. They have
concentrated mainly on excavating
necropolises and fortified settlements
and have made particularly important
discoveries in tumuli on a site in the

Mati river valley, at Vajza in the Vlora
district and at Upper Dropull near to
Gjirokastra.
In the Mati valley archaeologists
excavated thirty-five tumuli while a
dam was being built for a hydro¬
electric power station. Most of the
tumuli dated from early in the last
millenium B.C., although others were
more recent and some were even put
up during the Roman Empire.
The necropolis belonged to an
lllyrian tribe known to history as the
Pirusts. They were renowned as
tough fighters, and the excavations
produced evidence that they were
equally proficient as metalworkers.
For the Mati valley tumuli yielded a
surprisingly large number of bronze
and iron objects: spearheads of
various sizes, swords, daggers, helmets
and other weapons, as well as

ornamental objects clasps, necklaces,
buttons, bracelets and diadems.
The earliest fortified settlements in
Albania date from the transitional
period between the Bronze Age and
the Iron Age. Their ruins can be seen
scattered throughout southern Albania.
These early fortresses are usually
found in strategic positions on high
ground, dominating fertile plains and
river valleys and surrounded by good
pasture land. They conform to no
standard layout since they were skil¬
fully adapted to local topographical
conditions so that building was reduced
to a minimum. Remains of wattle and
daub huts have been discovered
within walls made of huge blocks of
rough stone put together without
mortar, and in some places more than
ten feet thick.
Detailed study has revealed conclus¬
ively that the early Iron Age forts at
Gajtan, Tren and Rosuja were used
by lllyrian tribes for defensive pur¬
poses. There is no evidence of any
economic activity worth speaking of;

they were simply strongholds where
the people and their flocks could take
refuge in time of war.
The second half of the Iron Age in
Albania saw the birth of a group of
lllyrian kingdoms and the development
of a system of economic production
based on slave ownership. A number
of castles and fortified settlements in.
southern lllyria date from this period.
Many of these settlements have now
been discovered and studied. Some
of them were added onto existing
forts; others were entirely new. The
walls of these late Iron Age forts were
built with remarkable technical sophis¬
tication of rectangular blocks of skil¬
fully hewn stone laid perfectly flush
without mortar.
A major discovery was a rectangular
stadium dating from the 3rd-2nd cen¬
turies B.C. It was found in the ruins
of the ancient lllyrian city of Amantia,
which is mentioned by fourth-century
Greek geographers and stood on the
site of the present-day village of Ploça.
Seventeen tiers of stone seats have
been uncovered on one side of this
well-preserved stadium, eight on the
other.
In the ruins of the ancient lllyrian
city of Dimale (present-day Krotina),
a portico with seven entrances has
been excavated, and at Byllis, once
so powerful that it minted its own
coinage, the remains of a theatre have
been found.
For several years now work has
also been going on in the imposing
ruins of Antigonea in the Drino valley
in southern Albania, near the modern
town of Gjiroka'stër. Visitors to the
excavations can stroll along the
straight streets and walk into the
houses of this once-great lllyrian city.
In Lower Selenica four monumental
graves hewn into the rock have been
discovered among the remains of an
lllyrian settlement whose name is still
unknown. The burial vault of one of
the graves contained dozens of
weapons, bronze and earthenware
vases, and many gold and silver
ornaments, including a remarkable belt
made of a thin strip of silver carved
with three horsemen and a warrior.
In the same grave was a pair of iron
shackles attached to the legs of a
skeleton a slave who had been put
there to serve his master in the next
world.
Although there is relatively little
monumental building in lllyrian cities,
they have yielded an abundance of
objects which have given historians
a profound insight into the economic,
social and cultural development of
lllyria.
Numerically, pottery such as con¬
tainers large and small for storing and
transporting wine, oil and grain takes
pride of place among the findings,
along with metal tools and building
materials. There are fewer weapons,
ornamental jewellery and other decor¬
ative objects.
An interesting feature is that some
pithoi, or wine-jar's, bear their makers'
seals, and we can still read on them
lllyrian names like Trito, Bato, Pito,
Genthios and Plator. Metal picks,

wealth of artifacts that throw new light
on its mythology and ancient cultures The
5,000-year-old Neolithic earthenware figu¬
rine (1) found at Kamnik, in south-east
Albania, is a symbol of the earth-mother
cult. In burial mounds at Kuçi Zi, in the
same region, many bronze objects have
been found In the form of birds (2) and
human figures (3) as well as bracelets and
clasps. They are believed to have been
used as amulets and ornaments. They
reveal the skill of Albania's metal crafts¬
men in the 8th century B.C. The small
bronze figurine (4) portrays Poseidon,
Greek god of the sea. It dates from the
2nd century B.C. and was unearthed at ft

the end of the Bronze Age. Below, remains of the dwelling site,
showing the piles on which were built rectangular-shaped huts with
walls of wattle and daub. FROM ILLYRIA TO ALBANIA
(Continued)
sickles, scythes, pruning knives and
ploughs have also been discovered in
these late Iron Age fortified towns,
along with tiles and bricks in such
enormous quantities that given the
transport difficulties obtaining at that
time we can conclude that they were
manufactured locally.
The rise of lllyrian cities during the
4th century B.C. was followed by a
period of prosperity which lasted
roughly from the 3rd to the middle of
the 2nd century B.C. This was a time
of intense political, economic and
cultural activity in lllyria. Several
settlements which had hitherto been
little more than villages now expanded
and became in a real sense cities.
The great coastal cities of Dyr-
rhachion, Apollonia and Bouthroton
became the main centres of Hellenistic
culture in southern lllyria and as such
they boosted the region's economic
and cultural development. Commercial
and other contacts between the
lllyrian tribal aristocracy and these
Greek cities further accentuated
the economic inequalities and social
differences in lllyria. But at the same
time, trade expanded and the new
society based on slave-ownership
began to forge ahead.
The great age of lllyria stretched
from the 4th to the 2nd centuries B.C.,
and during this period she made a
sizeable contribution to the life of the
Greek cities on the coast.
The sequel to the dynamic expansion
of lllyrian society between the 4th and
2nd centuries B.C. came with its
vigorous resistance to the impact of
the Roman world. After a bitter
struggle, the Southern lllyrians manag¬
ed to maintain their individuality as a
people virtually intact, although from
this time their culture begins to bear
the marks of Roman influence. The
Northern lllyrians were less fortunate:
they lost their ethnic identity and were
assimilated by the foreign invaders.
The course of lllyrian history cannot
be properly understood without detailed
knowledge of the Greek and Roman
civilization of Albania's coastal cities,
a subject on which Albanian archae¬
ologists are currently concentrating.
It is a mistake to consider the
Hellenistic civilization of the slave-
owning cities of Apollonia, Dyrrha-
chion, Bouthroton and Orichon in
isolation from the lllyrian territory
which surrounded them. As time

### 50277: Illyria of yesterday, Albania of today; archaeological excavations over the past 30 years at hundreds of ancient sites have thrown new light on the earliest ancestors of the Albanian people
went by, more and more lllyrians went
to live in these cities and made a
distinctive contribution to their life.
The architecture of Apollonia is that
of a typical slave-owning city. The
aristocracy led a life of ease and
luxury, as we can see from the
sophisticated 1st-century B.C. houses
excavated in the northwest of the city
opposite the modern village of Pojan.
There are floors of brightly-coloured
mosaics, some of which are decorated
with geometric and floral motifs, while
others depict mythological scenes,
such as Achilles fighting the Amazons.
One of Apollonia's most magnificent
and best-preserved monuments was
unearthed during systematic exca¬
vations carried out north of the city
between 1964 and 1968. This is the
nympheum, or monumental fountain,
which was put up during the city's most
prosperous period, around the end of
the 4th century B.C.
Recent work in Dyrrhachion has
also brought to light a number of
important buildings, including the city's
amphitheatre, which is comparable in
style and size to the biggest Roman
amphitheatres found elsewhere in the
Mediterranean world. Excavations at
Bouthroton and Orichon have like¬
wise provided information about Alba¬
nia's ancient history and lllyrian in¬
volvement in the life of the Greek
cities on the Coast.
During the last 28 years, Albanian
archaeologists have also made a
detailed study of early medieval Alba¬
nia and have drawn particular attention
to two points. Firstly, they stress that
although Albanian civilization extended
over a wide area, it had a pronounced
degree of cultural unity. Secondly,
they point to the persistence of lllyrian
influences, particularly as reflected in
metal ornaments of the period.
The lllyrian tradition mainly survived
where mining and metal-working contin¬
ued without a break, and in fact traces
of the lllyrian cultural heritage still
exist today in those parts of Albania
where there are rich mineral deposits
and where metals are mined and
worked on the spot. But ¡t is hardly
surprising that the medieval Albanians
should have Inherited this and other
traditions. They were after all the
direct descendants of the lllyrians.
This is not to say that early medieval
Albanian civilization was Immune to
outside influences. It was not. Alba¬
nians learned much from their contact
with the Roman and Byzantine worlds.
Yet the crucial fact remains that the
medieval Albanians were the direct
descendants of the ancient lllyrians.
They even owed their name to their
lllyrian ancestry, for Byzantine chroni¬
clers used the name of one small llly¬
rian tribe, the Albanoi, to describe the
whole lllyrian people.'
During the early Middle Ages this
term and its derivatives such as
Alban, Arban and Arber gradually came
to denote the whole area occupied
by the old Indigenous lllyrian popu¬
lation. It is just one more proof to
add to the multitude unearthed by
archeologists, of the ancient roots of
the Albanian people.

MASTER OF FANTASY
AND REALISM
A 16th-century Albanian painter
of icons and frescoes
virtually unknown outside his country
by Theophan Popa
WrHEN Michelangelo, Titian
and Tintoretto were producing works
of art in Italy which became famous
in their day, another great artist, only
a few hundred kilometres away on the
other side of the Adriatic, was painting
masterpieces. which are still practically
unknown today outside his country.
The artist, an Albanian priest, whose
only name known to us is "Onufri",
produced a large number of frescoes
and icons of rare quality and powerful
originality. It is only now that he is
beginning to find his place in the world
of art as one of the great painters of
his age.
Onufri, most of whose works
fortunately remain intact, worked
chiefly at Elbasan, a small town in
central Albania. He injected new life
into the Byzantine pictorial art of his
time which was until then shackled
to medieval tradition. His influence
led to a search for realistic human
expression and movement, and to an
THEOPHAN POPA, Albanian art historian, has
devoted numerous studies to the work of

never before appeared in Albanian
painting.
Albania was for many centuries part
of the Byzantine empire. During the
Middle Ages the Albanian Church
observed Greek Orthodox rites, Greek
became the country's literary language,
while Byzantine art and architecture,
spreading from Constantinople, took
root and flourished there.
In the 13th and 14th centuries, under
the Byzantine Paleologus dynasty,
Albania enjoyed a period of remarkable
economic and social progress. The
feudal chiefs formed principalities
which became independent of the
Byzantine empire and less subjected to
the political, religious and cultural
authority of Constantinople. Artistic
expression began to assume certain
distinct characteristics of its own.
One of these was a search for true-
to-life art, but the movement was
arrested at an early stage by the
Ottoman conquest in the second half
of the 15th century.
A period of turbulence ensued
during which the length and breadth
of the land were torn asunder by
insurrections against the invader.
Struggling to defend their language
and culture against the arbitrary rule
of the Ottomans, the Albanians joined
forces with their neighbours, Greeks,
Serbs, Bulgarians, Macedonians and
Montenegrans who were all trying to
rid themselves of the common yoke.
It was during these sorely trying times
that Onufri appeared.
We have very little information about
the artist's life neither the date of his
birth nor that of his death are known.
He worked during the first half of the
16th century, and a few autographic
inscriptions appear on some of his
frescoes covering the walls of the
churches of Elbasan, Shelcan and
Valsh. Some of these inscriptions are
simple prayers, and one of them dates
the fresco as 1554. His son Nicola,
who was also a painter, left some
clues on a fresco painted in '1578
scraps of information indicating that
Onufri married, had children, was
ordained and became archpriest of
Elbasan.
Information about his artistic training
is no more plentiful. He was probably
able to study frescoes and icons at
leisure, for at the time there were in¬
numerable and very fine examples of
both. Some can still be seen today,
but a great many have been lost. It is
almost certain that Onufri must have
begun work in Berat, a lively centre
on the river Osum. He presumably
studied in the studio of a master-
painter who, according to the custom
of the times, passed on to his pupil
the secrets of his art.
The life-like expressions of Onufri's
characters were a distinct departure
from traditional Byzantine painting, and
lead to the supposition that the painter
visited Italy and gained inspiration from
the various Renaissance schools which | Q
in the early 16th century were at the **
height of their brilliance. However,
Onufri restricted his art to large-scale

Towards a fresh realism
A painter who deserves to be better known outside his
country is the Albanian 16th-century artist, Onufri, who
produced some of the most astonishing icons and frescoes
of the late Middle Ages. Onufri, who had a keen eye for
colour and form, often broke away from traditional Byzantine
painting and took delight in enriching his works with realistic
and shrewdly observed details of the landscapes, architec¬
ture, clothing and other everyday objects of different parts
of Albania. On this double page we present Onufri's
magnificent icon painting, "The Nativity" (1) and four details
from the same work: (2) a shepherd; the drinking gourd
at his belt is exactly the same as those used today by
Albanian shepherds. (3) One of the Three Kings. (4) The
bathing of the Infant. (5) The archangel announcing the
birth of Jesus; the shepherd's bonnet and musical instrument
are still seen in Albania.

easel work
THE PRESENTATION IN THE TEMPLE, another icon painting by Onufri.
Note how skilfully the artist manages to incorporate vaulted ceilings,
pavilion roofs, balconies and other architectural features of his time
into this work, depicting Mary, mother of Jesus, finding her son among
the doctors in the temple at Jerusalem. The narrow coloured bands on
the stole worn by the archpriest greeting Mary (detail below) are still
a feature of Albanian folk art weaving.
His admirable frescoes cover the
walls of the churches of St. Nicholas
at Shelcan, St. Venerand at Valsh,
near Elbasan, and St. Theodore at
Berat. Other churches at Berat are
richly decorated with his icons. He
is known to have worked in Greece
where he painted the fresco of the
Holy Apostles' Church in the Mace¬
donian town of Kastoria. His com¬
prehensive work embraces hundreds
of single figures and scenes of a rich
variety of compositions.
Onufri observes the tradition of
pictorial narrative which sought to
provide religious instruction in works
of art, but his compositions are power¬
fully original and the expressions of
his subjects have a strong element of
realism and imagination. This is
particularly exemplified in an icon
of the "Presentation in the Temple",
where the Virgin Is met by the arch-
priest and a number of women.
Onufri likewise gave a new sense
of realism to the treatment of accessory
motifs. His "Entry into Jerusalem" has
an architectural background showing
red-tiled house-roofs with two eaves
to drain off rain-water, just as they
were in Elbasan during the painter's
lifetime and just as they still are today.
Another example is the "Last Supper"
at which the Apostles have table-
napkins decorated with narrow red
bands. These motifs are still used
today on table napkins in Albania.
Again in the "Nativity" (both fresco
and icon), Onufri paints a shepherd
with a gourd attached to his belt just
like the drinking gourds used today by
Albanian shepherds.
Right up to the 19th century all
Albanian religious painting bore the
stamp of Onufri's influence: his
plasticity of form, transparency and
contrast of colour, dynamic compo¬
sition and intense spirituality in facial
expression all played a decisive role
in the subsequent trends followed by
Albanian art.
Besides Onufri's son, Nicola, a whole
line of anonymous 17th century painters
followed in the master's fotsteps, but
none of them grew to his stature. The
18th century produced another Alba¬
nian master, David of Selenica, who
reached a remarkable degree of per¬
fection, but creative originality in
religious painting died with him.
Onufri is now not only recognized
as a great master of Albanian painting,
but his name is beginning to take a
deservedly prominent place among
those artists who throughout the
ages have enriched the cultural heri¬
tage of humanity as a whole.

In some of his icons,

depicting hallucinating

### 50281: The World's oldest painting on silk; visions of heaven, earth and the underworld in a 2,000-year-old Chinese tomb
THE WORLD'S
OLDEST PAINTING
ON SILK
Visions of Heaven, Earth
and the Underworld
in a 2,000-year-old Chinese tomb
by Wen Pien
18
I|N April 1972 an early Han-
dynasty tomb dating from the second
century B.C. was discovered at Ma-
Wang-T'ui in the eastern suburb of
Ch'ang-sha, In Hunan Province. Ma-
Wang-T'ui is a mound more than fifty
metres across and more than twenty
metres in height. In the tomb beneath
the mound was discovered a woman's
body in an astonishingly good state of
preservation. The body, swathed with
twenty layers of silk and gauze, was
half immersed in a reddish fluid.
The layout of the tomb is fairly
elaborate. Its burial chamber lay
20 metres below the top of the mound.
Inside, at the centre of a triple
enclosure of wooden planks was a
triple coffin. Funerary objects were
found between the wooden enclosures.
Outside this was a covering of charcoal
more than 30 cm. thick, weighing over
10,000 chin (5 tons). This in turn was
sealed with white clay 60 to 130 cm.
thick. The charcoal and clay pro¬
tecting the coffin from damp and the
means of embalmment used no doubt
account for the extraordinary state of
preservation of the body and burial
accessories.
When the body was removed from
the coffin, the skin and flesh were
found to be so firm and supple that one
could have believed the woman had
only recently died.
All three coffins are remarkable
works of art. The outer casket, lac¬
quered black, has paintings in white,
red and yellow of clouds or mist and
strange beasts and birds wrestling,
chasing each other and playing music
or dancing. The middle casket, lac¬
quered red, is decorated with vigorous
paintings of two dragons and two
tigers fighting together. The innermost
casket is- covered with silk having
a "satin-stitch" embroidered border
and ornamented with lozenge-shaped
designs of golden, black and emerald
feathers. This is the first discovery of
a silk coffin-covering of this kind.
Between the wooden enclosures
were found over a thousand funerary
objects, including silken fabrics, lac-
querware, wooden, bamboo and pot¬
tery utensils, grain and other foodstuffs.
Among the silk objects were more
than forty garments, slippers and
stockings, all in good condition, as well
as more than twenty embroidered pil¬
lows, aromatic pouches and wrappers.
There were also lengths of fabric
38.5 cm. to 50 cm. wide which represent
most of the varieties of Han-dynasty
silk known to us: satin, silk, gauze,
embroideries, brocade and damask.
The designs, woven, painted or
embroidered, depict animals, clouds,
plants, flowers and variously shaped
geometric designs. The gauze is so
light that one white inner garment,'
128 cm. in length with sleeves measur¬
ing 190 cm. from cuff to cuff, weighs
only 49 grammes. No thicker than
the wings of a cicada, its texture is as
fine as modern nylon. A brocade with
a thick short pile on one side is another
example of the high quality of Han-
dynasty weaving.
The colours of these fabrics, derived
for the most part from vegetable dyes,
include brown, crimson, grey, red,
fawn, buff, yellow, green, blue and
white. Discovered for the first time
are some lengths of silk dyed with
cinnabar or painted in gold and silver
with printed designs. There are also
linen fabrics of different textures, the
finest having 36 cross-threads to each
square centimetre. This has a smooth
glossy surface and is as strong as new
linen today.
The most precious find, however, is
the painting on silk draping the in¬
nermost coffin. Before the invention
of paper it was usual for artists to
paint on silk. This silk painting is
T-shaped, 205 cm. long, 92 cm. wide
at the top and just over half as wide
at the bottom, with silk tassels attached
to the corners.
The objects depicted cover a wide
range including human figures, the sun
and moon, birds, beasts, reptiles and

COLOUR PAGES
The 4 colour pages that follow are devoted
to the oldest example of painting on silk
found so far. The painting was discovered
in China in an early Han Dynasty Tomb
(2nd century B.C.) unearthed at Ch'ang-sha
in Hunan Province. Everything inside the
tomb was in an almost perfect state of
conservation including the embalmed body
of a woman preserved for 2,000 years.
The painting on silk, the most precious
find among over 1,000 objects, covered the
innermost casket of the woman's triple
coffin. The painting comprises three
sections representing the universe: Heaven,
Earth and the Nether Regions, and is filled
with creatures and representations from
Chinese legends and mythology. The
complete painting is shown on page 20.

OLDEST PAINTING ON SILK (Continued irom page 18)
legendary monsters, as well as sacri¬
ficial vessels and musical instruments.
The whole painting is divided into three
sections, representing the Heavens,
the Earth, and the Nether Regions.
The upper section depicts a scene
in heaven. In the upper right-hand
corner is a round sun, inside it a crow
and under it eight smaller suns with
spreading foliage between them.
According to an ancient Chinese myth
there were once ten suns and ten
golden crows on a huge tree known as
fusang in a place called T'ang-Ku.
These ten suns circled the sky in turn.
When one sun came out, carried on
the back of its crow, the other nine
would rest under the boughs of the
tree. A sun being carried by a crow
may have symbolized the cycle of day
and night.
Once all ten suns came out at the
same time, so that plants and crops
b.egan to shrivel. Then the sage king
Yao ordered a famous archer, Yi, to
shoot them down, and Yi shot down
nine suns and nine crows. This
painting shows eight small suns only.
Perhaps the artist deliberately con¬
cealed the ninth behind the leaves.
II N the upper left-hand
corner is a crescent moon with a toad
and a white hare in it, while a woman
on a winged dragon is ascending
towards it. This is a scene from
another ancient myth which relates how
the woman, Ch'ang Ngo, wife of the
archer Yi, stole the elixir of immortality
which her husband had obtained from
the Queen Mother of the West and
fled to the moon.
Between the sun and the moon
hovers Ch'u lung, a deity with a man's
head and a serpent's body, who has
authority over heaven and earth. Five
stork-like birds are flying towards him.
Further down in the middle hangs a
bell. The two capped and robed figu¬
res with folded hands below it are
either the musicians who sound the
bell or guardians of the gate of heaven.
Flanking them are two horizontal
beams each supporting a vertical
board, and on these boards are two
leopards spotted red. The wooden
structures probably represent the gate
of heaven which the leopards are
guarding. On either side of the bell
are monsters riding on horses towards
the sun and the moon, beneath which
winged dragons with claws and fangs
are breathing out red flames.
In the middle section, the main part

of the painting, is a dignified and
elegant old lady with elaborately
dressed hair who is walking slowly
with the help of a stick. Two kneeling
figures in front are welcoming her with
trays of food in their hands, while
behind are three maidservants.
This old lady, the central figure in
the painting, is a noblewoman. The
curtain above her may represent some
hangings in the sacrificial hall, while
the horizontal line with coloured
lozenge designs below the figures
presumably stands for the ground.
The lower section of the painting
appears to represent the earth and the
ocean. Under the horizontal earth-line
is a jade pendant, a symbol of nobility,
from which two dragons are issuing
and rearing upwards. Strings of beads
suspended from the pendant fan out
on either side above a jade chime, and
on them perch winged birds with
human heads.
Below these are two short tables
beside which, facing each other, sit
two rows of seven neatly dressed
figures with folded hands. The tripods,
boxes, pots, bowls and other utensils
on the tables may be the sacrifice for
the dead lady.
Underneath, supporting the tables
with both hands, a mighty monster, half
man and half bear, stands astride two
fish-like monsters. Beside it are two
tortoises with two owls on their backs.
Since owls come out only at night,
shunning the light of day, they are
usually depicted as creatures of the
Nether Regions.
At the very bottom are the two sea
monsters with protruding mouths, fish
tails and spotted intertwined bodies.
These may be the creature called Ao
which, according to early Chinese
mythology, could support the heaviest
weights. That would explain why they
form the base of the whole compo¬
sition.
Thus the striking scenes painted on
the silk were inspired by myths and
legends or represented the life of that
period. Whether imaginary or based
on life, they have been arranged by
this unknown artist into one perfect
whole, a gem of ancient pictorial art
reflecting the high level reached by the
Chinese painters of old.
The composition, though so rich in
content, is no mere jumble of objects
but pleasingly presented. The chief
subject, the dead lady, has the central
position to give prominence to the
main theme, while the sun and moon
and other accessories form an integral
part of the whole.
The lines are fluid and vigorous and
the objects depicted are remarkably
lifelike. The garments of the dead
lady, for example, are painted with
exquisite delicacy of touch which
conveys the texture of silk, while we
can see that the monster supporting
the earth is flexing its powerful
muscles. The sun and moon, the
dragons, leopards, tortoises, birds and
sea monsters appear thoroughly vivid
and lifelike.
The use of such mineral dyes as
cinnabar, azurite and malachite has
produced glowing and resplendent
colours, while the perfect symmetry of
the composition induces a sense of
order and harmony.
The tomb has also yielded more than
180 pieces of lacquerware retaining
their original lustre. Some of the lines
on the surface designs are as fine as
silken threads. Most of these wares
are inscribed inside or outside with the
name of the owner or with the purpose
and capacity of the utensils. When
first unearthed some of them contained
lotus-root, or food made of rice and
flour. On some lacquer plates were
ox-bones, chicken-bones and fish.
HE objects made of
bamboo and wood include 162 wooden
figurines, 312 bamboo slips and 48
bamboo vessels. The wooden fi¬
gurines are dressed in coloured gar¬
ments or have clothing painted on
them. Twenty-three of them are giving
a performance of music and dancing;
opposite them are lacquer stands,
screens, a walking-stick, a scented
pouch, a powder-box and lacquer trays
heaped with food. This evidently
represents a feast during the dead
lady's lifetime.
Slips of bamboo were used for
writing on before the invention of
paper. Those found in the tomb were
inscribed in elegant calligraphy with
the number, size and name of different
objects in the tomb. These ink in¬
scriptions are still clear and unblurred.
The woven bamboo vessels with covers
contained silk, pendants, meat, veg¬
etables, eggs, fruit and medicinal herbs.
Among the musical instruments are
a 25-stringed zither 1.16 metres long
with four pegs; a pipe-organ 90 cm.
long with 22 pipes in two rows; and
twelve bamboo pitch-pipes. These
well-preserved musical instruments
provide valuable material for the study
of ancient Chinese music.
There were 50 pottery objects in the
tomb including tripods, food containers
with lids and wine-pots, some with
a yellow glaze or painted surface.
These contained cereals, pickles and
fruit.
Inscriptions in ink or clay seals on
the funerary ware indicate that these
objects belonged to the family of the
Marquis of T'ai. According to Han-
dynasty histories, the hereditary title
of Marquis of Tai was created in
193 B.C. and the title remained in the
family for four generations. The
woman in the tomb was probably the
wife of the first marquis. This
nobleman, who was chancellor of the
Prince of Ch'ang-sha, ranked relatively
low in the Han aristocracy.

ANCIENT POTTERY
Did it receive the imprint

LDDRESSING the Royal
Geological Society in London just
over a century ago, Sir Roderick Mur-
chison, a well-known British geologist
declared: "There was human civiliz¬
ation... in South America at the time
of the older Stone Age in Western
Europe."
Sir Roderick based his statement
on the discovery of some ceramic
vessels and gold figurines that James
S. Wilson had unearthed two years
earlier, in 1860, at an archaeological
site on the coast of Ecuador.
The site of the discoveries was the
scene of the first known "geological
tragedy" in that part of the South
American continent which was destin¬
ed to become Ecuador. It consisted
of a stratum of vegetal loam covered
over with a thick layer of marine
deposits, indicating that the Ecuadorian
coast was once inhabited but then sank
into the sea, only to rise again
thousands of years later.
We do not know exactly what the
objects were that Wilson discovered
or where they are today. What we do
know is that the "biography" of the
Ecuadorian people goes back to the
Valdivia culture which dates from 3200
to 1800 B.C. A number of ceramic
pieces of this period are to be seen in
JORGE ENRIQUE ADOUM, Ecuadorian poet
and writer, was formerly National Director
of Culture in Ecuador. Among his works
are a 4-volume poetic cycle, "Los Cuadernos
de la Tierra' (Notebooks on my Country,
1952-1962), and a play on the fall of the Inca
Empire following the Spanish Conquest
entitled "El Sol Bajo las Patas de los
Caballos' (The Sun Trampled by Horses'
Hooves). He is now a member of the
editorial staff of the 'Unesco Courier'.
a magnificent exhibition of pre-Colum¬
bian art from Ecuador that has been
travelling through Europe since 1973.
How Ecuador was given its name it
mean "equator" in Spanish makes an
interesting story. It was originally a
confederation of tribes which 16th
century chroniclers baptized the King¬
dom of Quito. In the Spanish colonial
period it was known as the Real
Audiencia de Quito (the Judicial Dis¬
trict of Quito under the authority of
the Spanish Crown), and afterwards
the Presidencia (Presidential District)
of Quito.
By 1736 it was well known that the
earth was round and measurements
had been made of the terrestrial
meridians in the polar regions. That
year the French Royal Academy of
Science sent a mission of geodesists
to Quito to ascertain whether, as a
result of its rotation, the earth was
flattened at the equator as Giovanni
Domenico Cassini, director of the
Paris observatory, had claimed, instead
of at the poles as Newton had main¬
tained.
The surveyors found the equinoctial
line to be twenty kilometres north of
the capital, Quito. This is -probably
the only place where the line is not
just an imaginary one: it has been
drawn on the concrete base of a
commemorative pyramid. The country
then began to be called the "Land of
the Equator" and subsequently this
name was officially adopted, though it
was somewhat ambiguous and could
suggest that the country lay in Africa
or some other place through which
the earth's longest parallel passes.
The relative isolation of South
America from the rest of the world
was originally a geological phenomenon
dating back some two hundred million
years. According to the theory of the
German geophysicist, Alfred Wegener,
South America was once a part of a
single land mass that also included
what are now the territories of
Antarctica, Africa, India and Australia.
This mass had in turn broken off from
the primeval land mass that further
comprised present-day Europe, North
America, Greenland and Asia.
The future continents separated and
moved westward, and as they did so
they left behind telltale traces of their
breakaway. The Red Sea, for example,
is a vestige of the sundering of Africa
from Asia, and North America seems
to have left Greenland behind as it
migrated ever farther to the west.
Meanwhile South America had worked
itself loose from the vast continent that
Wegener called Gondwana, and form¬
ed an immense island drifting away
from the rest of the world.
If we look closely at a map of the
world, we see that the eastern coast
of South America fits perfectly into
the western coast of Africa, like a
piece in a jigsaw puzzle about to be
set in place. (For an earlier treatment
of Wegener's theory of continental
drift, which he formulated in 1912,
see the "Unesco Courier", October

Science, however, is not content,
to rely on such superficial evidence.
It has dug deeper and found convinc¬

ECUADOR'S ANCIENT POTTERY

ween animal species that are now
extinct on the New Continent such as
the woolly mammoth and the sabre-
toothed tiger and those, past and
present, of the African continent.
Here let us note that the oral
history of peoples always begins with
a legend. Throughout South America
there is a legend, first recorded by the
Spanish Chroniclers of the Indies,
about an invasion of giants who came
from the sea, destroyed the indigenous
towns and raised megalithic monu¬
ments along the Pacific coast.
This legend may have its origin in
the discovery of large-sized bones
which, according to Alexander Hum¬
boldt, the German scientist and
explorer (1769-1859), must have
been "the remains of enormous un¬
known cetaceans"; according to some
more imaginative archaeologists, they
were the bones of the Andes masto¬
don or "carnivorous elephant".
But anthropologists are also per¬
plexed by the enigma of America.
They are not so much concerned with
giants as with knowing how man first
came to South America. The mon¬
goloid features that are still apparent
in the New World Indians seem to
point to an Asian origin.
Professor Juan Comas, a leading
authority on Latin American anthropo¬
logy, asserts and it is now consider¬
ed an established factthat 40,000
years ago wanderers from Asia cross¬
ed the Bering Strait on an ice bridge
about fifty miles wide that then linked
the two continents (See article by
Prof. Comas, in the "Unesco Courier",
August-September 1972, p. 46). By
that time the land bridge of Central
America had emerged from the ocean
and thus enabled the nomads from
the north to travel as far south as
Tierra del Fuego.
Other theorists, such as Professor
Paul Rivet, former director of the
Paris Musée de l'Homme, who carried
out research in Ecuador, claim that
there was a twofold current of mi¬
gration, a northern one made up of
Mongolians and Eskimos who came
by way of the Bering Strait, and a
southern one consisting of Malayan-
Polynesians who crossed the Pacific
Ocean in fragile open sailing-craft.
Characteristics of the australoid
race of Lagoa Santa in Brazil are
also exhibited by the first-known
"Ecuadorian", Punin man, whose skull
was unearthed some 50 years ago in
central Ecuador. Punin man is 6,000
years old according to carbon-14 tests.
DOUBLE-CONE CERAMIC JAR
Bartholomé Ruiz, the first Spanish
navigator to reach the coast of
Ecuador in 1526, described with
wonder a sea-going craft used by
the Mantas Indians (a raft with a
lateen sail) and the objects it carried.
Dating from 500 B.C., the Mantena
culture on the central coast of Ecuador
was noted for its outstanding
craftsmanship in metal and stone.
Its pottery, usually coloured black,
featured superb animal and human
figures, realistically depicted or
stylized in shapes as unexpected
as this double-cone vessel topped
with a human head.
Pre-Columbian remains found along
the coast of Ecuador have been seen
by some as evidence that Asians
came to Ecuador 2,500 years before
the Christian Era, blown off their
course by a storm, and exerted a
strong influence on the aboriginal
cultures.
Dolico-cephalic skulls (long narrow)
belonging to a fishing people were
found in a lower stratum in Valdivia,
whereas a more recent level has
yielded the remains of a brachy-ce-
phalic people (round headed) who
introduced agriculture and a technique
of baking clay so highly developed
that the Valdivia culture may be
considered the first ceramic centre in
the New World.
Moreover, their ceramic "Venuses"
have certain traits in common with
the statuettes of the Jomon culture
in Japan, and both types may possibly
be related to some fertility cult
common to both sides of the Pacific.
The figurines aiso suggest that an
early matriarchal society existed in
Ecuador. Some of the coastal tribes
worshipped the goddess Umiña, "god¬
dess of the green stone", which may
be a reference to jade.
Additional evidence of links with
Asia comes from the Chorrera culture
of Ecuador (1800 to 500 B.C.) with

### 50283: The Enigma of Ecuador's ancient pottery; did it receive the imprint of an Asian people 4,500 years ago?
VENUS
OF VALDIVIA
These three figurines are
believed to represent female
divinities. They are works
of pottery of the Valdivia
culture which developed on
the southern coast of Ecuador
from 3200 to 1800 B.C.
Valdivia potters produced a
great variety of ceramic
"Venuses" (rarely over
5 cm. high) using finger-nails
to shape eyes and eyebrows,
mouths and hair. Certain
scholars have advanced the
hypothesis that pottery was
introduced to Ecuador by an
Asian (Japanese?) people
who reached the Ecuadorian
coast by 2500 B.C. and under
whose influence the modelling
and baking of clay developed.
its figures displaying typically oriental
features and its finely-drawn ceramic
work decorated with an iridescent
metallic paint the technique of which
remains unknown subjected to tem¬
peratures of 1,000 degrees in labora¬
tory tests, the metallic film still clings
to the underlying pottery.
Other Asian associations are seen
in the Chorrera clay models of build¬
ings on truncated or stepped pyramids
that are reminiscent of pagoda struc¬
tures, and, most particularly, in a large
number of "neck rests", similar to the
type of, oriental pillow made of fine
porcelain or willow branches that could
still be purchased in antique shops in
Peking or Shanghai when the author
was there a few years ago.
The most convincing piece of
evidence, however, for certain advo¬
cates of the Asian hypothesis is to be
found in the similarity between the
rudders of rafts still used for navig¬
ation in South America, Viet-Nam and
Taiwan. Since such rudders existed
in China five centuries before the
Christian Era, it has been assumed
that they could have come from Asia
to South America.
But the sea can be crossed in both
directions. In 1947 Thor Heyerdahl,
the Norwegian anthropologist and
explorer, built one of these rafts, the
Kon-Tiki, on which he sailed from the
Peruvian port of Callao to the atoll
of Raroia in an attempt to prove that
the islands of Polynesia were origin¬
ally inhabited by aborigines from
South America, remote ancestors of
the mythical "noble savage" imagined
by Montesquieu and discovered later
by the French navigator, Louis de
Bougainville, and by Captain James
Cook.
Whatever the point of departure
may have been, there is no doubt
that there were trans-Pacific and
inter-American contacts. The gigantic
sculptures of Chile's Easter Island are
parents or children of Polynesian
wood sculpture. The cultivation of
maize spread from Central America
to the southernmost part of the South
American continent. Utensils indispu¬
tably made in Ecuador have been
found in Panamanian graves. In Ecua¬
dor and Peru there are place-names
of Arawakan-Caribbean origin, and
the great variety of human types
found in the statuettes of the La
Tolita culture in northern Ecuador
either reflect striking ethnic differen¬
ces or are the exaggerated, grotesque
or even caricatural rendering of the
features of strange invaders who
landed on the coasts.
Some clay models represent houses
on stilts for protection against floods
and wild beasts; others, built like
sanctuaries on platforms, seem to
imply the existence of a hierarchized
and stratified society where political
and religious power was in the hands
of priest-chiefs and shamans whose
dignity was easily recognized by their
pectoral ornaments and nose-rings.
Ocarinas, whistles, rattles and drums
no doubt played an important part
in the religious rites performed to
appease the gods. From mollusc
shells they made recipients, orna¬
ments, and strings of beads as fine
as two millimetres in -diameter which
served as a kind of money for trade
with the Andean peoples who acquir¬
ed them in order to compel their own
gods to give them rain.
All these cultures had different
languages and different customs,
though they had some features in
common. For example, they all equat¬
ed art and craftsmanship. The artist
was considered a useful member of
society because he wrought vessels
and utensils for domestic use, and
the artist, feeling the community's
need for art, produced artifacts that __
were aesthetically pleasing to behold jl
and to live with. **'

urines found in La Tolita lead neces-

ECUADOR'S ANCIENT POTTERY
(Continued)
sarily to the conclusion that many
people, perhaps the entire population,
were engaged in making and selling
their artistic well-crafted products.
These were cultures whose oral
traditions escape us. Centuries of
imagination, creative effort and spiri¬
tual turmoil would be needed in order
to develop systematic religion with
mythical concepts of bird-men or
leopard-men and idofs which did not
merely represent divinities, but actually
incarnated them.
No one knows how this ideological
process evolved or how long it went
on. It must have culminated in a
belief in some sort of survival of the
soul, otherwise why would they have
placed the bodies of their dead in a
foetal position and buried them with
jewels, pottery, clothing and food, as
though replacing them in the womb
of earth to be reborn to another life?
What intense hope must have gone
into the effort to replace realism by
a more abstract representation, and
led to the unbridled "baroque" decor¬
ation on the vessels known as
"witches' cauldrons", and the overly
ornamented costumes still worn
by dancers in solstice celebrations
and on other high days. These co¬
incide with the major feasts of the
Christian calendar, though their signi¬
ficance has been forgotten. Perhaps,
like all popular festivities, they are a
way to cast off all restraints, perhaps
nothing more than a manifestation of
the humble human need to be "king
for a day".
It is important to remember that
since the wheel was unknown in these
early cultures, they had no wheel on
which to mould pottery. But nothing
has ever prevented any people from
developing the noble and all-embrac¬
ing art of pottery in which man takes
a handful of earth and fashions his
own creations.
Perfectly symmetrical whorls for
spindles were made by craftsmen of
the Guangala culture of Ecuador (500
B.C. to 500 A.D.) and its jars have
been compared to those of Crete.
Olaf Holm, the German archaeologist,
maintained that the ancient potters
must have used large disk-shaped
platters which they rotated with one
hand while modelling the vessel they
were making with the other.
The road from clay to metal was
also a long one. No doubt gold was
more elegantly wrought in other coun¬
tries, but it was in La Tolita, from
500 B.C. to 500 A.D., that man first
worked with platinum. The Danish
scientist, Paul Bergsoe, discovered
that the secret lay in softening the
platinum by mixing it with molten
gold a technique that only began to
be used in Europe in the 18th century.
These cultures lacked the plough
in addition to the wheel. They sur¬
vived as some still do on cereals
and potatoes. From one period to
the next, and from one region to
another, they doggedly waged their
dramatic struggle against the environ¬
ment, though not always successfully.
Along the coast they were plagued
with eruptions of now extinct volca¬
noes, long periods of drought, and
the formation of saltpetre beds that
make agriculture impossible.
In the mountains there was the
bleak paramo with its scrubby vege¬
tation, its drizzly rain and the mist
which envelops the two Cordilleras of
the Andes that double backbone of
the land, made up of volcanoes and
snow-covered peaks rising as high as
six thousand metres above sea level,
with warm, temperate valleys between
them like hollows in the vertebrae of
a continental spinal column.
And on the other side of the moun¬
tain range were the Amazonian
jungles, the domain of wild monkeys
and jaguars, where snakes laid their
eggs on leaves that had been piling
up since primeval times.
The diversity of climates gave rise
to a wide variety of products and
cultivation techniques, but man was
first of all, here as elsewhere, a
hunter. The deer was not only a
figure in the mythology and art of
primitive man but also provided his
basic food and bony material with
which to manufacture tools.
The tutelary and totemic animal of
the South American Indians was
the llama, a symbol of the silent
wastes of the Andes. From time to
time fish crop up as decorative motifs
on their pottery, but this was the mark
of other cultures which sooner or
later began to influence them, or a
result of the descent of mountain
tribes to the coast.
The desolation of the brushwood
tablelands, the stillness scarcely bro¬
ken by the wind and the mountainous
landscape with its double barrier that
acts like a set of blinkers preventing
man from seeing beyond them all
those forced the individual to look
either down at the ground or up at
the stars, both of which prompted him
to ask questions about himself.
The plateau-dweller had the same
aesthetic feeling for utensils of current
use and the same desire to decorate
functional objects as his cousins on the
coast, but the austerity of his environ¬
ment caused him to express himself
in more severe art forms.
The Carchi culture had a clear pre¬
ference for negative painting. The
hieratic attitude of their sculptured
figures was emphasized by the use
of black, and a dramatic facial
expression was obtained by using
substances that made the eyes seem
to shed tears of colour.

northern end of the Ecuadorian
coast, show a highly
developed form of art. They
may represent religious,
human-animal figures to

the terracotta figure
(21.5 cm. by 25.5 cm.) is a
fragment of a pottery of
unknown shape. Right,
earthenware head, half feline,

So many of these objects

that it would seem that the

was engaged in pottery-making.

From 1800 B.C. to 500 A.D. a great culture extended over much of Ecuador.
Specialists consider this civilization (known as Chorrera) to have been the cradle
of indigenous Ecuadorian culture. Below, two typical pottery figures of Chorrera.
The vessel in the shape of a man lying on his back, left, and the bottle, right,
are characteristic of Chorrera ceramic art, with such distinctive
features as the so-called "coffee-bean" eyes.

I|T grows but does not
grow old." This motto, displayed on
the arms of Sofia, capital of Bulgaria,
is an apt description of the evolution
of that ancient city in the heart of the
Balkans which continues to modernize
and look to the future while preserving
its 7,000 years-old links with the past.
The central part of the city, which is
still in the process of change above
ground, extends over the buried
remains of several civilizations, com¬
prising strata of ruined cities to a depth
of 10 metres.
From the now scarcely identifiable
traces of an ancient Thracian settle¬
ment to the vestiges of later cultures,
the whole of this archaeological
complex records the troubled history
of a city often besieged by invaders
and destroyed several times.
Lying at the crossroads of the
Balkans peninsula, set in a fertile well-
watered plain surrounded by mountains
and forests filled with game, and famed
for its mineral springs and baths, Sofia
has often paid dearly for its privileged
situation.
The "heart" of the city is still the
same: it is the Forum of the Roman
town of Serdica, the centre of medieval
Bulgarian Sredets and the main
square of the Sofia liberated less than
a century ago from foreign domination
a square today named after Lenin.
Every epoch built on the ruins of the
past and each layer of ruins left its
mark. Little by little, century after
century, reality fused with legend.
An unusual subway has been built in
Sofia. To cross the busy central
square, the pedestrian has to go thirty-
five steps down below the ground.
Nothing above ground could lead one

to guess the extraordinary surprise
awaiting the passer-by who for the first
time goes down the granite steps
flanked by marble walls, under the
bright lights of a glass and aluminium
ceiling.
At the foot of the steps, he enters
the hall of what appears to be a
museum of archaeology. At the
entrance he passes through the main
east gate through the wall of the
ancient fortifications which defended
the city for more than twelve centuries.
The gate, built of great limestone
blocks, now stands hospitably open.
It originally had two metal doors which
were closed at the onslaught of in¬
vaders. Its pentagonal towers on
either side, built of red brick upon a
plinth of large stone blocks, formed
part of the 6th century wall that en¬
circled the citadel. When they were

built, the towers were about 10 metres
high. Today their ruins reach the
ceiling of the hall at a height of about
four metres.
Behind these fortifications the ruins
of another wall, built in alternating
layers of stone and brick, were also
unearthed. Fortifications and wall are
both four metres thick. It is not by
chance that Serdica's fortress was
claimed to be impregnable and that
only a long siege could force the city's
defenders to open its gates.
The second wall dates from the time
of Constantine (4th century) but an
inscription cut in a great stone slab
displayed in the hall indicates that
Serdica also had a defensive wall as
early as the 2nd century, at the time of
the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. These
fortifications protected the city even
after its occupation by the Slavs and
inclusion in Bulgaria in the 9th century,
but were destroyed in 1382 when the
Turks besieged and captured Sredets,
as it was known by that time.
The outer gate leads to an enclosed
space in which are entrances to the
towers, well preserved up to their
arches. There is an inner gate on the
opposite side of the enclosure. On
the threshold of both gates traces of
the ruts left by the passage over many
centuries of innumerable iron-rimmed
wheels of carts and patricians' chariots
are still visible.
The small court between the two
gates is paved with thick stone slabs.
Most of them are parts of the magni¬
ficently ornamented cornices and
architraves, with their sculptured sides
face downwards. They once adorned
the facades of buildings and porticos
around the forum of Serdica.
The Roman city, which grew and
prospered in the second to fourth
centuries, was devastated in the fifth
century by the Goths, the Huns and
other invaders. In the sixth century,
under Justinian, the city regained its
importance, but during the vicissitudes
of the ensuing centuries much of its
magnificence was to be trampled under
foot and buried. Today men of the
20th century are again walking on the
original stone slabs.
The finds were not unexpected,
because archaeologists had the plan
of the ancient lay-out of the city, and

already been explored before work on
the subway began.
But as soon as the work of excava¬
tion started, archaeologists realized
that the old east gate would be
unearthed in an exceptionally good
state, considering that the town had
been destroyed and rebuilt so many
times. So it was decided to modify
the course originally planned for the
passage and to allow more time and
money for its construction.
The finds which came to light are
now preserved in the passage hall.
They surpass in their monumental
structure and archaeological signifi¬
cance all earlier discoveries, proving
that the effort was well worthwhile.
Special laws for the protection of
cultural property and painstaking
efforts by archaeologists working
closely with architects produced a bold
and original solution that reconciles
urban modernization with the needs of
cultural preservation.
The citizens of Sofia have taken the
habit of using the passage. Hurrying

lessly pass between the massive ruined
walls. Others stop to telephone in

But for the newcomer the subway is
a fascinating step backwards into
history. Blow-up photos of the exca¬

archaeological monuments and help to
explain them. Niches in the walls
contain fragments of sculpture, original
mosaics and even a small altar de¬
dicated to Artemis by the priestess,

exhibits, one can see the inner side

of the fortified wall and the steps up
which the sentinels climbed. A relief
map shows the layout of ancient
Serdica.
There are also on display earth¬
enware containers out of which the
defenders of the citadel poured boiling
pitch onto the invaders. Nearby are
amphoras discovered in the ruins of a
small shop on the ancient way where
today souvenirs and post-cards are
sold from a small kiosk.
Constantly the visitor notices other
links between Sofia past and present.
The vestiges of antiquity no longer
seem to be dead. Fittingly, Sofia's
coat of arms with its inscription, "It
grows but does not grow old," in¬
scribed between two olive branches,
has been placed on one of the walls.
The four quarters of the coat of arms
bear the ancient symbols of the city:
the image of Tyche, patron goddess of
cities, copied from a Serdica coin; the
magnificent 6th century basilica of
St. Sophia, which gave its name to the
city in the 14th century; the little
temple of Apollo Medicus incarnating
the beneficent thermal springs; and the
Vitosha mountains, their massive peaks
forming an unchanging back-drop to
the city.
Nearby is the great stone at one
time embedded in Serdica's gate above
the arch, still welcoming the visitor
with the traditional greeting, "Good
luck", inscribed above the names of
ancient emperors and governors.

ECUADOR'S ANCIENT POTTERY
This curious object is a whistle-bottle
of the Bahia culture of Ecuador,
composed of three round
inter-connected vessels of polished
grey earthenware decorated with
human-animal heads. The Bahia
culture produced earthenware
headrests and structures with
pagoda-shaped roofs. These and
other objects have been seen by certain
specialists as evidence of direct
early contact between Asia
and South America.
Half tortoise, half ¡guana, the vessel
immediately below was produced by
the Bahia culture during Ecuador's
so-called "Period of Regional
Development" (500 B.C. to 500 A.D.).
The tripod with human feet belongs
to the Carchi culture of northern Ecuador.
It is of the so-called "Period of
Integration" (500 to 1500 A.D.).
The geometric motif is produced by
painting the background and leaving
the pattern the colour of the original
clay, a technique known as "negative
painting". The two works bring to mind
similar Chinese objects.

Physical anthropologists may sigh
when they come upon skulls that have
been deformed into the shape of a
cone (probably for ritualistic reasons),
and when figurative representations
depart from strict realism and do not
portray the typical physical traits
that they are looking for. But the
gradual development of art is the
result of changes in man's way of
looking at himself.
The Cashaloma and Tacalshapa
cultures, the last ones to survive
before the invasion of the great
Inca armies, had worked out a theory
of form and colour, mass and line,
in harmony with their environment.
Here we find an early manifestation
of artistic freedom with a breakaway
from stylized forms, the use of free,
arbitrary shapes, the asymmetrical
application of colours, and the transfer
of textile designs onto the nude bodies
of the miniature caryatids that sup¬
ported their fruit dishes. Could this
be the origin of.tatooing in Ecuador?
These cultures possessed no writing.
But their masks seem to indicate that
they had developed a rudimentary form
of theatre. The features are usually
very expressive, contorted, grimacing
or wrinkled, and sometimes sardonic.
I wonder whether the masks found
in tombs, on skulls ten or twenty cent¬
uries old, are meant to capture the
true essence of the departed, faceless
and unknown. Or were they intended
as a disguise so that the divinities
could not recognize the person enter¬
ing heaven? Or were they simply to
frighten off evil spirits and demons?
True art never really answers ques
tions; on the contrary it gives rise to
them. The axiom that aesthetics has
precedence over logic, or that a sense
of form came before speech was
developed, may apply to the Pre-
Columbian civilizations in Ecuador.
The examples of Pre-Columbian art
touring Europe are a retrospective
exhibition of the works of the Ecua¬
dorian artist covering slightly more
than three thousand years. A whole
people left the sign of its hand on
these, plates, pitchers and statuettes,
and thus created a cultural identity
that can be recognized not only
through the objects but in the works
of art themselves.
The Incas arrived from the south in
the middle of the 15th century. Theirs
was one of the great great civilizations
of history: theocratic (they worshipped
the sun), an absolute hierarchy (the
Inca was considered the son of God
and his mediator on earth), imperialist
(they called their Empire "The Four
Corners of the Earth", encompassing
the entire universe).
When they conquered the aboriginal
tribes they made Quito their second
capital. They amazed the Spanish
with their mathematically hierarchized
social organization, their dignified and
forbidding demeanour, and their gift
for town-planning based, as an Ecua¬
dorian archaeologist recently wrote,
"upon a respect for ecology and the
introduction of Nature into the urban
environment and the architectonic
space." This briefly, is a description
of the colossal sacred citadel of
Machu Picchu the mystery of whose
construction may never be deciphered.
But that is another story.

Letters to the Editor
POP OR NO POP?
We thank the many readers who
replied to our query "Want an issue
on pop music?" The replies
show a majority in favour of an
issue on pop and other forms of
modern music. A large percentage
come from young people, but a
significant proportion are from older
readers who want to know more
about pop, including its origins,
meaning and social significance. An
issue on pop is planned for late
next year. Space permits us to
publish only a few of the many
letters received.
Sir,
An issue on pop and other forms
of modern music would have a
universal appeal. I shall look forward
to its publication.
Mary Dewhurst
Burlington, Ontario
Canada
Sir,
My reply is No I This is not a
suitable subject for a serious magazine
such as the "Unesco Courier". Pop
music gives a harmful slant to the
moulding of young minds and tastes.
It also turns young people away from
the beauties of our folk-music and
from the classics the finest music of
all.
L. Carrion
Sao Gabriel
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
Sir,
I suggest you include articles dealing
with the origins of pop music and its
different forms and styles. The issue
will help people to understand this
kind of music, which has become so
obviously a part of present-day culture,
and no form of culture should be
looked down upon.
Matti Palomäki
Turku, Finland
Sir,
I enjoyed your June 1973 issue devot¬
ed to "Music of the Centuries" and
I would welcome an issue on pop. I
am not an expert on modern pop, but
I think that as time goes by it will
be seen as something unique and
revolutionary in the history of music.
Raymond Laberge
Villeneuve, Quebec
Canada
Sir.
Bravo for your idea. I teach music
to 300 young people at a technical
education centre and believe me, pop
makes a far bigger impact on them
than classical music or jazz. The
young are seeking a language for the
20th century. I try to understand them,
but it is not easy for an adult. So
let the specialists enlighten us on the
pop craze.
Ch. Tripp
Belfort, France
Sir,
Because I was made to practise the
piano from the age of 5 to the age
of 18, and because I was saturated
with Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Mendels¬
sohn, etc., I found myself, as an adult,
addicted to Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky,
Messiaen, etc. Now at the age of
61, I am a fan of King Crimson, Pink
Floyds and other pop stars and collect
their records. I confess that for me
pop has blotted out all other music.
With its violence and despair, its
planetary use of instruments from every
continent and played by the teen-agers
who are the world of tomorrow, it is
the real pulse of our times. Thank
you for the June 1973 issue devoted
to non-European music.
N. Provins
Paris, France
Sir,
Please, Please, NO pop issue. The
British Broadcasting Corporation and
all the world's record companies cater
for ALL mankind's needs in this respect.
G. England
Porthcawl, United Kingdom
Sir.
Pop is not a subject that should
concern Unesco. With so many other
media, pouring it out, it is practically
impossible not to know something
about it.
Why not wait another ten years by
which time the controversy will have
died away if pop still exists. By then
it will have become part of the world's
musical heritage whether one likes it
or not.
Robert Daigneault
Montreal, Canada
Sir,
A great idea, but please include an
article on "Música Contesta" (Protest
Music) or "Canción Protesta" (Songs
of Protest) now so popular throughout
Latin America.
David Gonzales Gross
Palma Soriano, Cuba
Sir,
Why not take a retrospective look
at young people's music since 1950:
rock, twist, pop, folk-songs, etc.
Alain Charmillot
Besançon, France
Sir.
By all means devote an issue to pop
music as well as to modern music in
general. As a music teacher in a
secondary school, I had been intend¬
ing to prepare a course on the origin
of pop music and on how electronic
music is "made".
M. Trancart

PAKISTAN 5.000 YEARS
OF CIVILIZATION
Sir,
In your December 1973 issue the
history of civilization in Pakistan has
been captivatingly presented in 40
pages of informative articles and
photographs on ancient sites, antiquities
and historic monuments.
I am sure this commendable effort
will go a long way in giving the world
a distinct glimpse into the cultural
heritage of Pakistan and the treasures
of art and culture in this ancient land
of the Indus.
Dr. Mohammad Ajmal
Pakistan Ministry of Education,
Islamabad, Pakistan
Sir,
In your issue dedicated to Pakistan,
I must congratulate your for highlighting
the salient features of Pakistan's
ancient art and culture in a most
appealing manner.
Taswir Hussain Hamidi
Superintendent,

Karachi, Pakistan
THE ICELAND SAGA
Sir,
Congratulations on giving your
readers those excellent articles on the
life and culture of the Icelanders
(February 1974). As Jónas Kristjánsson
rightly says, in the sagas "are to be
found answers to all the problems of
human life".
To the sagas and Eddas of Iceland
we are indebted for the preservation
of the faith that guided the actions of
all northern Europe until the coming
of Christianity. I hope readers of the
"Unesco Courier" will have been
encouraged by your articles to discover
for themselves the magic of the sagas.
They will not regret itl
Paul Vavasour

WHEN CHILDREN
CAN TEACH ADULTS
Sir,
I would like to endorse what Rosa
Maria Pérez Mirabent had to say in
the letters column of your January 1974
issue. I really enjoy your publication
but I hate to feel that people younger
than myself (I am in college) are being
deprived of a good resource because
they cannot understand the material.
Many children and young people are
very concerned about their world and
I think publications like yours should
encourage this. I suggest that you
regularly publish a supplement that can
be used in the classroom. As a beginn¬
ing, I would like to see a supplement
dealing with World Population Year,
the problems, the solutions, and espe¬
cially some ideas for younger folks on
how they can help to solve the problem.
You would be suprised to see how
often children can educate adults.

African science
and technology
By 1980 African states should each have
between 1,000 and 2,000 scientists per
million inhabitants and should be spending
at least one per cent of their gross national
product on research and development.
These targets were set by 38 countries at
the recent CASTAFRICA Conference in
Dakar (Senegal) on African science and
technology. Commenting on Africa's
progress in this field, Unesco's Director
General, René Maheu, told the conference
that 24 out of Unesco's 38 African member
states today have ministries of science
or other bodies to direct national science
policies.
Universal Postal Union
centenary
1974 marks the 100th anniversary of the
Universal Postal Union. In this connexion,
Unesco's Director-General, René Maheu,
has suggested ways for Unesco member
states to promote the international flow of
information through postal communications.
These cover cheaper postal services (by
suppressing or reducing taxes, extending
rates for printed matter, etc.) for books,
newspapers, and a wide range of edu¬
cational, scientific and cultural materials.
The Icelanders and the Sea
The Editors wish to draw readers' atten¬
tion to the following observations with
regard to the article "The Icelanders and
the Sea" by Dr. Unnstein Stefánsson of
the Marine Research Institute in Reykjavik,
which appeared in the February 1974 issue
of the "Unesco Courier".
1. The last paragraph of Dr. Stefánsson's
article referred to the decision taken on
September 1, 1972 by the Icelandic Gov¬
ernment and the Althing (Parliament) to
extend the Icelandic fisheries jurisdiction
to 50 miles. The final sentence of the
article originally read: "Behind this decision
the entire nation stands united." In the
published text on page 30, this sentence
was inadvertently omitted, when, for
B rn
complementary clarification purposes the
following sentence was added by the
editors: "This decision has not been
accepted by all nations and has been the
cause of some tensions and disputes with
certain European fishing nations."
2. The sentence on page 30 "No single
nation relies as heavily on the sea for
its economic prosperity as do the Iceland¬
ers" originally read : "No independent
nation relies as heavily on the sea, etc."
The author had in mind certain nations that
have not gained full independence.
The Editors regret these discrepancies.
Architecture, sports
and popular culture
Unesco's new international quarterly,
Cultures, devotes its second issue, just
published, to a series of themes: "Aspects
of Popular Culture", "Architecture" and
"Sports and Culture". Cultures, (annual
subscription 75 Fr F; single copy 22 Fr F)
can be ordered from Unesco national
distributors (see next page).
Flashes...
The following information is taken from
the latest edition of Unesco's Statistical
Yearbook, just published:
Leading book producers in 1971 were
U.S.S.R. (85,487 titles), U.S.A. (80,569) and
the Fed. Rep. of Germany (40,354).
Da/7y newspapers increased from 7,860
in 1969 to 8,050 in 1970, but at the latest
count 44 countries and territories still had
no daily.
(n J 970 radio transmitters numbered
22,000 and radio receivers 728 million;
there were over 17,000 TV transmitters and
261 million TV sets.
Industrially-developed countries have
25 times more scientists and engineers
than developing countries and spend
between 30 and 120 dollars per head on
research and development compared, for
instance, with only one to two dollars per
head spent by Africa.

ECUADORIAN TWO-HEADED PITCHER
The double-spouted pitcher was a popular form of ancient Ecuadorian craft. The one shown here is a highly
original example of Andean pottery of the 5th century A.D. The heads of different sizes forming its spouts
probably represent those of an Indian mother and the child she carries on her back. Discovered in Ecuador's
southern province of Cañar, it was modelled by a craftsman of the Tacalshapa culture which flourished on
the Andes at that period. (See article on the Pre-Columbian cultures of Ecuador, page 24.)
