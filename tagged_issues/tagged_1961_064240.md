ABU
SIMBEL NOW OR NEVER
The fate of Abu Simbel ls now In the balance.
Unesco has addressed a "now or never"
appeal to Its 100 member nations for voluntary contribu¬
tions to save the two colossal temples of Abu Simbel from
destruction under 200 feet of water as a result of the
construction of the High Dam at Aswan. The temples,
hewn out of the solid mountain rock in the 13th century
B.C., are considered to be among the great architectural
glories of Pharaonic art.
Before the end of October of this year, Unesco's
Executive Board will be in a position to know whether
these testimonials of a former civilization are to be
considered Irreparably lost to mankind, or whether a
joint international effort will save
them from disaster.
The appeal is contained in a
special message on the present
state of the Nubian International
Campaign to save the treasures of
Nubia, addressed on August 4 by the
Acting Director-General of Unesco,
Mr. René Maheu, to all of Unesco's
member states. It calls for voluntary
contributions totalling $67,000,000 to
save not only Abu Simbel but other
temples and monuments in Egypt and
the Sudan which are threatened by
the future Aswan Dam when in a few
years' time it backs up the waters of
the Nile in a 300-mile long artificial
lake. Unesco has asked all countries
to guarantee a contribution, extending
over the next seven to nine years, in
the same proportion as their present
assessment for the Unesco budget.
The two temples of Abu Simbel are
to be preserved by what has been
described as "the most daring
engineering project of modern
times." They will be sliced from the
mountainside into which they were
built three thousand years ago,
encased in concrete boxes, and raised
by giant jacks over two hundred feet.
(See story page 10).
The call to Unesco's 100 member
States was made on the recommenda¬
tion of the International Action
Committee which is advising and
helping the Director-General of
Unesco in fund-raising. The Action
Committee, made up of representatives
from all continents, met in Paris last
June to examine the present state of
the campaign. They found that the
rescue operations except the Abu
Simbel project are now almost
assured, and stressed the urgency of
obtaining the funds needed If the
two temples are to be saved in time.
The overall contract for Abu Simbel must be signed by
January 1, 1962. Before then, preparatory work must get
under way, and the main work must begin not later than
May 1962.
Before the end of October 1961, enough money must
therefore be guaranteed from international sources over
the next seven to nine years to enable Unesco's Executive
Board to give the United Arab Republic the go-ahead
signal. It is estimated that $20,000,000 will be needed for
the preparatory operations and the first payments to the
contractors in 1962, and a further $13,000,000 in 1963.
President Gamal Abdel Nasser in a statement made on
June 20 of this year described Abu Simbel as the "most
important relic of civilization in Nubia... this undertaking
represents the most serious phase In the salvaging of the
Mediterranean Sea
monuments of Nubia, a phase that calls for collective
effort."
The cost of the entire Nubian rescue operations
(exclusive of archaeological and prehistorlcal excavations)
has been estimated at $87,000,000. This will provide for
the dismantling and transfer of 23 temples, tombs, early
Christian churches and rock-hewn chapels in the U.A.R.
and the Sudan (estimated cost $10 million); the preserva¬
tion of the temple-group on the isle of Philae ($6 million) ;
and the preservation of the temples of Abu Simbel
($70 million).
Four miles south of the present Aswan Dam in central
Egypt, the new High Dam (Sadd el Aali) is being built
across the Nile by the United Arab
Republic with Soviet aid. It will
contain the river above that point
and form a gigantic artificial lake
drowning the Nile valley of Nubia in
both Egypt and the Sudan.
For Egypt the new lake will mean
the beginning of an era of great
regeneration. It will increase the
total food production of the country
by nearly one half; some 2,500,000
acres of desert will be brought under
cultivation, and an additional 750,000
acres now flooded will be reclaimed.
Egypt's hydroelectric output will be
increased by the dam something like
ten times.
The new dam is an economic
necessity for Egypt. But there
remains the fact that everything
within the Nubian lake area will be
obliterated by 1968. In 1959, the
Governments of the U.A.R. and the
Sudan turned to Unesco for help to
save the temples and monuments
menaced by the impending flood in
both countries. On March 8, 1960,
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. Vitto¬
rino Veronese, launched the now
famous International Campaign to
save the treasures of Nubia (1).

This map of the Nile valley shows the vast
artificial lake (shaded) which will be formed
when the new Aswan High Dam is complet¬
ed in 1 968. Its waters will submerge
numerous historical treasures and monu¬
ments in Nubia in both Egypt and the Sudan.
The response thus far has been both
generous and heartening. As the
President of the United States
recently said, it is "an international
effort which has captured the
imagination and sympathy of people
throughout the world."
Support has come from govern¬
ments, from private and public
organizations and from private
citizens in every part of the world.
Even children from different
countries have organized collections
to help. The world's press, radio,
television and cinema have all joined
voluntarily to help make the campaign a success. In
some 20 countries national committees have been formed,
made up of noted archaeologists and other leaders in the
fields of science and the arts, as well as important
officials, businessmen and members of civic groups.
The United Arab Republic has guaranteed a sum of
$20,000,000 for Abu Simbel. The United States Govern¬
ment has offered (subject to Congressional approval)
010,000,000 $6,000,000 to cover the costs of saving the
temples of Philae, $2,500,000 for the removal of certain
temples, $1,500,000 for archaeological expeditions and
research in Nubia.
Announcing the United Arab Republic's contribution,
President Nasser declared last March:

NOW OR NEVER
INGENIOUS
"The world's conscience has now awakened to a deep
awareness of the importance of safeguarding the monu¬
ments of Nubia in response to the international appeal
launched by Unesco on March 8, 1960. Through thts
appeal Unesco has sought to arouse the energies and
goodwill of all peoples in a cause deeply rooted in the
ancient history of civilization and symbolic of the hopes of
mankind.
"We pin our hopes on the High Dam for the
Implementation of our plans of economic development;
but likewise we pin our hopes on the preservation of the
Nubian treasures in order to keep alive monuments which
are not only dear to our hearts we being their guardian
but dear to the whole world which believes that the
ancient and the new components of human culture should
blend in one harmonious whole.
"The preservation of the legacy of mankind is no less
important than the construction of dams, the erection of
factories and the greater prosperity of the people...
"Unesco has contributed much to the creation of this
sense of solidarity and to the action undertaken to
safeguard the monuments through the facilities and funds
it has made available and through the co-operative spirit
which has guided the specialists and the groups of
scientists who have taken an interest in this unique
endeavour.
Reflecting similar sentiments, the President of the
Sudan, Ibrahim Abboud, recently reaffirmed his country's
responsibility to the rest of the world for the ancient
monuments within his borders, "... since the history of
the Sudan ls but a part of the history of mankind."
Tïhe enormous tasks of the campaign were
divided into three categories. First there was
the urgent job of carrying out systematic surveys and the
organization of expeditions to excavate archselogical and
prehistoric sites the threatened area of both Egypt and
the Sudan.
As André Malraux has said, "Nubia, like Chaldea,
belongs to the dawn of our own history." It was the junc¬
tion point at which the cultures of inner Africa met with
the cultures of the Mediterranean world. In the region
to be flooded, scientists feel, may well lie some of the im¬
portant clues to the riddle of man's unknown past.
Today, Nubia has become a vast archaeological camp, with
almost 30 expeditions at work or about to work.
The second category comprises the dismantling and the
removal of ancient temples and other historic monuments
to safety beyond the flood area. These operations are
now under way and are progressing satisfactorily. The
U.A.R. has already removed the three temples of
Kertassi, Debod and Taffeh, while the Federal Republic of
Germany has offered to assume the task of removing the
great temple of Kalabsha, and France the temple of
Amada. (See details page 30.)
The last category includes the two most important
projects of the campaignthe preservation in situ of the
temples on the isle of Philae, and the Abu Simbel temples.
If the United States Congress approves the $6,000,000
appropriation for Philae recommended by President
Kennedy, the future of Philae will be definitely assured.
In his message to Congress, Mr. Kennedy stated:
"I consider it to be in the interests of the United States
to assist in rescuing these historic remains of a former
civilization from destructionand to join the international
effort to conduct exploration and research in the
threatened area of Nubia before it is submerged.
"The United States, one of the newest civilizations, has
long had a deep regard for the study of past cultures,
and a concern for the preservation of man's great
achievements of art and thought... I recommend that
we now join with other nations through Unesco in
preventing what would otherwise be an irreparable loss to
science and the cultural history of mankind."
Thus the Unesco campaign has almost reached its goal
6 for the two temples of Abu Simbel. The "now
or never" battle to save Abu Simbel will be decided in the
next few weeks.

MASTERPIECE IN PERIL. Built more than 3,000 years ago in the XlXth dynasty of the New Empire, the Great Temple of Abu Simbel is of colossal
scale. It measures I 08 feet in height, I 24 feet in width, and extends 200 feet in depth. On the façade are four colossi of Rameses II (seen here in a
striking night photo made by floodlight). They are 67 feet high, their mouths are 42 inches wide and their huge heads are I 3 feet from car to ear
(the head of the second colossus disintegrated centuries ago). Left a statue of Queen Nefertari (wife of Rameses II) standing between a pairs of colossi.
O
1he greatness of Egypt is popularly identified
with the petrified geometry of the pyramids,
those remarkable examples of civil engineering, veritable
mountains of masonry. Experts, however, would agree
that the sublimation of funerary art, combined with
shrewd scientific insight, were the rock temples.
There are great free-standing Egyptian temples, superb
in their proportions, In their pillars and their sculptures,
but the architects of these were able to choose the best
artificial site, and the masons to select or discard the
quarried blocks for their building and ornamentation.
A sculptor, carving a statue, would pick the most suitable,
most enduring and most flawless stone for his purpose.
The architects and the masons of the rock temples had
no such latitude; instead of choosing blocks of stone they
had to discover an escarpment or a mountain which 7
would conform to their exacting requirements. Once com¬
mitted, their artistic ingenuity was hostage to the site.

ABU SIMBEL (Cont'd)
ART & SCIENCE
CONSPIRED
WITH NATURE
Among the greatest of these temples hewn from the
living rock were the Great Temple and the Small Temple
of Abu Simbel In which the immortality of the Gods and
of Rameses II was embodied in the indestructible rock.
They were planned by Seti I but executed in all their
grandeur by Rameses II during his prodigious reign of
67 years, from 1300 to 1233 B.C.
Modern geologists who have examined the site of Abu
Simbel are unstinted in their tribute to their unknown
predecessor (or predecessors) who chose this particular
location 3200 years ago.
Thirty miles north of the Second Cataract, on the left
bank of the Nile, where the river turns east, were two
rocky prominences divided by a gully. Here was a site
which met a first elementary requirement: that the
temple, dominating the river, face the rising sun.
In the vicinity, the left bank of the valley is
steep, a cutting by the river exposing about 400
feet of sandstone cliff, which could have shown the
ancient geologists the structure of the rocks. But this
evidence was merely superficial.
How did they know, as can be determined nowadays,
that there was little or no distortion of those sandstone
beds? How did they establish that the interior of the
mountain could architecturally house the Great Temple
which they were proposing to excavate? How did they
satisfy themselves that the consistency of the sandstone
would lend itself to the carving of colossi and of the
friezes?
How much did they know about the chemistry of
minerals and how the elementary granules of the sand
were bound together by a cement of iron oxide, which
gives the rock its colour-gradations, ranging through all
shades from pink to dark mauve? What did they know
of the porosity of the rock and the highly solvent power
of the Nile water, and hence of the water-table below the
mountain, which, when the rocks were exposed to heat,
would be pumped upwards by capillary action? This
"pumping" would mean the dissolving of minerals in the
rocks, a chemical reaction, and the precipitation of salts
all likely to alter the characteristics of the rocks.
The carved immortality of their Pharaoh would
depend upon the durability of the rocks they found. How
much did they know about weathering? How did they
determine from external evidence that the rocks within
the mountain would lend themselves to the structural
engineering of an ambitious temple such as Rameses
would certainly demand? On decisions like these not
only the reputations of those ancient geologists and
engineers depended but, one would guess, their very Uves.
To quote one of the technical reports drawn up by
engineering experts last year: "The temples of Abu
Simbel are a wonderful achievement. Apart from the
importance of the monuments themselves, we are struck
with admiration at the deep knowledge of geology which
the ancient Egyptians possessed. The presence of hard
sandstone banks alternating with softer ones was used
to advantage in creating the temples and the statues.
The more compact layers were chosen for the ceilings of
the temples and inner rooms, or to support the greater
weight of the sitting statues. They also made the most of
the fissures in the rock: th« facades of the two temples
run parallel to the more fissured lines."
On what we would nowadays call the "feasibility report,"
the ancients went ahead with the construction of the
Madeleine Pottier
two temples some 300 feet apart overhanging the banks
of the Nile. But they did something more; they contrived
the design of the temples to fit in to the natural landscape
so that art and science conspired with nature to make
Abu Simbel one of the wonders of the world.
The larger of the two rock temples, facing to the east
and to the rising sun, has a façade 33 metres (over 107
feet) in height and 38 metres (over 123 feet) in width.
It was dedicated by Rameses to Ra-Horakhti, Amon-Ra
and Ptah, the most important gods of Egypt. In its
proportions and structure It equalled a temple that might
have been built on the surface instead of underground.
On entering the underground temple one finds a large
hall, or temple court. It is divided into three aisles by
quadrangular pillars eight of them each with a statue
of the King 34 feet high. There even remain fragments
of colour paintings; and the bas-reliefs covering the walls
tell in life-like sculpture the story of his victory over the
Hittites and similar battles. The ceiling has paintings of
winged vultures and tablets in praise of Rameses.
This gives on to a vestibule, the ceiling of which is
supported by four quadrangular pillars adorned with
carvings of war exploits and the protector gods.
A narrow passage leads to the inner sanctuary where
are seated the statues of the three gods to whom the
temple is dedicated, and Rameses himself. And here is seen
the purposeful ingenuity of the architects and engineers.
Like' skilful stage-lighters, they contrived that the rising
sun would penetrate 200 feet into the heart of the
mountain and illumine the faces of only three of the
immortals. The fourth, the god of the Underworld, Ptah,
on the extreme left remained eternally in darkness. This
essential feature of Abu Simbel was one of the things
taken into account in deciding how the temple should be
finally preserved from the rising waters of the High Dam.
Eight smaller chambers are irregularly disposed on
the right and left of the central ones presumably so
that they would not impair the foundations of the main
halls and these were apparently functional parts of the
temples, storehouses and treasure chambers, although
whatever valuables they may once have contained have
long since disappeared.
Tio Nefertari, his wife, Rameses dedicated the
Small Temple, several hundred feet away
across a sandy gully. Its façade measures 88 feet in width
and 39 feet in height. It is ornamented by six colossal
statues, each 33 feet high. They are In two separate
groups in each of which the queen stands between figures
of the Pharaoh with, at their feet, their sons. One of the
pillars states: "The King built this Temple by hewing it
from the rock of the hill of the country of Takens."
In the interior of the hill, there is a hall large and low
supported by six columns. Three doors lead to the
vestibule and through it to a modest sanctuary.
To quote the engineering experts once again: "The
inspiration of the Abu Simbel monuments rises above and
beyond the traditional conception of the ancient
Egyptians, for whom the pyramid was the maximum of
architectural perfection, as the only conclusion of a long
process tending to geometrical abstraction. What
prevails here is the plastic sense of the mass; the
monument merges into its environment, the architecture
marries with sculpture, and sculpture actually acquires a
dominant character in the ensemble."

Unesco-Van der Haagen
At any hour of the day the Great Temple of Abu Simbel
is an impressive sight, but at dawn it offers its most
breathtaking spectacle. There was nothing haphazard
about the choice of its site or in the construction of the
multiple galleries and chambers deep in the mountainside.
At dawn the purposeful ingenuity of the architects and
engineers of ancient Egypt is fully revealed. Like skilful
stage-lighters, as the photos on these pages show, they
contrived that the rays of the rising sun after first illumi¬
nating the pantheon of statues on the façade of the
temple (opposite page) would penetrate deep into the
interior. Above, from left to right, through the temple
portals, the sun bathes the huge Osirian pillars with its
golden light and at certain times of the year reaches
200 feet into the heart of the mountain to the inner sanc¬
tuary. Here it picks out from the Stygian darkness the
seated figures of divinities like Amon, (left) "The God
of Thebes ". Below, the four immortals seated at the
far end of the sanctuary: Ptah, whose statue remains
eternally in darkness for he is king of the underworld ;
Amon, Rameses II and Ra-Horakhti, morning sun god.

ABU SIMBEL (Cont'd)
JACKING UP
A
OF STONE

T:he temples of Abu Simbel are part of
mankind's heritage, irreplaceable heirlooms
from the culture of 3,200 years ago. Modem needs and
modern technology may compel and produce the High
Dam of Sadd el Aali but the Present cannot afford to
squander the Past. Confronted by the achievements of
the makers of Abu Simbel, of the scientists (and they were
scientists as we have seen from the testimony of modem
geologists); of the craftsmen; and the artists, who were
dedicating their work not only to their gods but to
posterity, the least that our modern civilization can do
is to turn minds and resources to the rescue of their
creative handiwork.
As the trustee, for the Future of the Past, Unesco has
intervened. How much of the perishable antiquities, like
the great mud brick forts of Nubia, will be explored and
their stories deciphered before the waters rise, Is a chal¬
lenge which has been thrown to the archaeologists and
the conscience of the world.
B ut Abu Simbel Is a special case and Unesco,
with the agreement and support of the
Government of the United Arab Republic, has taken steps.
For the preservation of the Abu Simbel monuments, four
proposals were given serious consideration:
1. Raising the temples and surrounding rocks above the
level of the waters;
2. Building an earth and rock fill dam, to protect both
temples;
3. Building a protective concrete dam in front of each
temple;
4. Building a large dome concrete dam, to protect both
temples.
Of all these possibilities for preserving the temples from
the flood, two schemes remained at the end of 1960. One
was a proposal submitted by a French engineering con¬
cern, the Bureau d'Etudes André Coyne et Jean Beliier
(Paris), to build a rock fill dam to enclose the two temples.
The size was planned to allow a clear space In front of
the temples but the dam itself would tower above the
façades and, among other things, would defeat the ingen¬
uity of those ancient engineers who contrived that the
rays of the rising sun would penetrate into the heart of
the mountain.
Technical difficulties of water seepage would have
meant, in perpetuity, an annual cost of $370,000 for
pumping. The capital cost of the dam construction would
be $82,000,000. Another objection raised was that, with
the filling of the High Dam, the water-table of the land
around would rise and that, even though enclosed by the
TREASURES CAPTURED ON FILM. The massive structures of Abu
Simbel and its figures are completely carved from the solid rock. Impos¬
sible to dismantle, they must be moved in one piece as they were built.
Their soft red sandstone is particularly vulnerable to dissolution by
water. Even a brief submergence would remove completely the colour¬
ful paintings which still survive on walls and ceilings. Long before the
bold plan to raise the temples out of reach of the invading Nile was pro¬
posed every square inch of the great Abu Simbel group was being mi-

nutely examined. Black and white and colour photographs, photogram-
metric negatives (from which exact models of objects are reconstituted),
architects' notes, casts and copies of hieroglyphic texts, graffiti and in¬
scriptions have gradually been amassed. Photos show, above, Jean Jacquet,
Swiss architect, working on a survey of the great temple; below left,

for making photogrammetric shots between colossi on temple façade.
Surveys of Abu Simbel were virtually completed this summer.
E
<
protecting dam, the rocks of the Abu Simbel mountain
would become saturated and the seepage would affect the
temples Imbedded in it.
The second proposal was of a very different kind. Con¬
ceived by the Italian architect and archaeologist, Plcro
Gazzola, it was prepared by three Italian civil engineering
firms Italconsult, Impresit and Lodlglani and put for¬
ward to Unesco by the Italian Government in October
1960. This suggested encasing each of the two temples In
concrete boxes and raising the rock masses 60 metres
(200 feet) above the present level of the waters and
reconstructing the original hill landscapes so that the
final position of the temples would bear the same rela¬
tionship to the Nile as it does at present but on a
higher elevation.
In January 1961, a Committee of Experts appointed by
Unesco in conjunction with the Government of the Unit¬
ed Arab Republic unanimously recommended the accept¬
ance of the Italian project for lifting the temples. Tech¬
nical questions were raised and were referred to another
committee consisting of experts from Norway and Sweden.
They confirmed the feasibility of the Italian scheme and
in June 1961 It was accepted by the Government of the
United Arab Republic. It will cost $70,000,000.
The Italian scheme ls bold, Imaginative and grandiose
and has transferred into twentieth-century idiom some¬
thing of the ancients' massive thinking, which could con¬
template the Great Pyramid, with its 2,300,000 separate
blocks each weighing 2 1/2 tons; or the Giant Sphinx,
240 feet long and 66 feet tall, hewn out of a left-over
rock of the Great Pyramid; or Abu Simbel, the disem¬
bowelled mountain itself.
Indeed one might compare this twentieth-
century concept to the ziggurats of Mesopota¬
mia. These ziggurats began as altars on the ground-
level, but successive generations of the priesthoods
surpassed each other in raising the altars higher and
higher, by superimposing one ziggurat upon another,
producing a man-made mountain with the temple, each
time, on top.
At Abu Simbel, the two temples will be lifted separately
and each will be supported by a honeycomb of concrete
supports, forming two massive pedestals. The lifting will
be an engineering feat, raising, in the case of the Great
Temple, a wedge of mountain-rock, weighing a quarter of
a million tons, with a delicacy of movement never before
attempted.
Consider again the site. The two temples are imbedded
in solid rock. The façades with their massive statuary are
poised on the escarpment above the river. The platform-
rock on which they stand ls 120 metres (390 feet) above
sea-level. When the High Dam is completed, the water
will rise to 182 metres (591 feet) above sea-level. So to be
above water-level the rock-sections embodying the tem¬
ples will have to be raised at least 200 feet, and under¬
pinned.
Before the lifting operations begin a whole series of
precautionary measures will have to be taken. The area
in front of the temple will have to be protected by a
cofferdam, an embankment 134 metres (440 feet) high, so
that the operations can be protected as the dam-waters
rise. A pit as long as the temple façades will be dug down
to the 105 metres level, that ls, about 50 feet deep, from
which the excavation and clearing of the galleries
beneath the temple blocks will proceed.
At the same time, the temples themselves will be care¬
fully reinforced an operation almost as delicate as the
mending of cracked porcelain. The structures, Including
the colossi, have already been carefully examined for
fissures. Some of the cracks probably existed when the
temple was first built. They have caused damage to the
Ramessid colossi In front of the Great Temple and in the
case of one statue have led to the shearing off of a head
and arm.
Inside the temple there are natural pipes, hollowed out '*
by percolating water, and veins which were closed with

After every foot of lift they will be replaced by pre-fabricated
concrete supports. (8) FACADE ROCK FISSURES. Every
inch of the temple and the colossi have been examined and all
fissures recorded. Before any lifting is done the temple will
be carefully reinforced an operation almost as delicate as
the mending of cracked porcelain. The operations illustrated
here will be repeated, though on a reduced scale, for the smaller
Temple of Queen Nefertari a few hundred feet away.

Boxed in concrete
mortar when the temple was built. There is the risk of
scallng-off of weathered rock when work begins. Of the
eight columns in the main hall of the Great Temple, two
are not carrying any load because of cracks between the
roof and the column head, and two others have been
weakened by fractures.
The \talls and roofs are in pretty sound condition but
the greatest precautions will have to be taken to preserve
intact the inscriptions and painting. (This could be done
by covering them with adhesive textiles.) All this work,
which would have amounted to a major piece of restor¬
ation even if the temples were not due to be moved, will
have to anticipate any disturbance of the rock blocks In
which the temples are encased.
The proposal is that the blocks, and the temples they
contain, once cut out of the hill, should be enclosed in a
reinforced concrete box so rigid that the separation ot
one block from the surrounding rock and the subsequent
lifting will not introduce any stresses or strains. This box
would have a bottom and four sides and binding ties
across the top.
The bottom ls a matter of special engineering concern
because it will have to take the lifting forces. The pro¬
posed bottom grid structure will be 16 1/2 feet high (this
may be reduced to 13 feet), which will involve the excava¬
tion of three groups of five parallel tunnels. The side and
rear walls of the box will be of heavily reinforced con¬
crete. They will be constructed in three groups of vertical
shafts, excavated and concreted, and each wall section
will be rigidly connected to the bottom-girders.
T:he front walls have to take care of the façades
of each of the temples. The space between
the wall and the façade will be filled with compacted,
crushed sandstone like packing a fragile present for
dispatch.
But, first, the mountain above the rock-blocks has to be
removed, to reduce the weight and facilitate operations.
This will mean shifting the overlay from 155 metres (about
500 ft) above sea-level upwards. This may sound like
nothing more than a rather elaborate piece of landscape
gardening (since it is planned to restore the contours
around the lifted temples), but it actually is an extremely
tricky operation. Explosives cannot be used nor any
method which might cause vibrations likely to disturb
the temple-rocks.
That applies to the whole process of cutting out the
blocks. Apart from explosive shocks being entirely barred,
any tools which would cause serious vibrations would be
dangerous. However, experiments carried out In Norway,
on rocks which would vibrate more than the Nubian
sandstone, have shown that compressed air tools for
boring and breaking can be safely used.
In rocks within twenty-four feet of any decorated parts,
mechanical hammers weighing not more than 30 kilo¬
grammes and giving a thousand blows per minute may be
used. ' At closer range electric saws and chisels will have
to be used.
But before anything ls done, experiments will be carried
out reproducing similar conditions to those at Abu Simbel.
And the experts have recommended that during the oper¬
ations microseismic warning systems super-sensitive
earthquake meters should be installed. In effect, It will
be a matter of the doctor feeling the patient's pulse the
whole time, one of the "patients" in this case weighing
a quarter of a million tons!
Once the blocks are cut and boxed the most delicate
operation of all will begin. This ls the edging upwards,
two millimetres at a time, of the concrete "crates" and 13
their massive contents. This will be done by mechanical
jacks on the same principle as those used to hoist a car

when you have a punctured tyre. Outsized versions of
those will be installed within the grid of the bottom struc¬
ture in a lattice so contrived that the points of upward
pressure will be evenly distributed.
The original proposal was to use hydraulic jacks. A
later suggestion was for mechanical jacks with a maxi¬
mum lifting capacity of 2,000 tons each, driven by
hydraulic stroke cylinders moving a turnable nut through
a ratchet system. The number of jacks and their lifting
power are still a matter of debate among the experts.
Some want more of them250 with 1,000-ton lift each and
even duplication of that, so that one set of jacks would
always be taking the load while the other was being
retracted.
Although the edging upwards will be done less than
1/16 of an inch at a time, one complete lifting cycle will
raise the temple by one foot. At this stage of the lift,
prefabricated reinforced concrete blocks of 30 cms will
be slipped into position to form permanent supporting
pillars. All this will be carefully synchronized and the
functioning of each jack will be recorded on a central
control panel so that the chief supervisor can make sure
that there is no risk of warping, which would produce
stresses in the temple blocks.
As the blocks rise upwards, the jacks will follow on
taller and taller concrete pillars which will form part of
the final supporting structure. The stability of all this
stilt-like erection will be guaranteed by horizontal rein¬
forced concrete beams joining the continuous walls. Thus
in the end, each temple will be standing on the crest
of what will, externally, be an enclosed pillar, surely the
biggest of pedestals which museum exhibits have ever had.
This, the direct engineering process, does not take into
account the vast "housekeeping" programme involved.
Already surveys have discovered where the huge supplies
of suitable sand and aggregate can be obtained in the
neighbourhood.
There will be a floating quay, which will rise with the
waters of the Nile. There will be a network of supply
roads; an electricity generating station; a settlement with
a working population, and with civilized amenities which
will be desperately needed in this tract of desert; work¬
shops, etc., commensurate with one of the biggest en¬
gineering enterprises; and when the "surgical" operation
of cutting out and transplanting the temples to the point
where they will be safe from the encroaching waters of
the High Dam of Sadd el Aall is performed, there will be
the further job of "plastic" surgery.
The . "scalped" mountain will be restored and the fea¬
tures, even the parting, the gully, between the temples
will be reproduced, as a replica, on the higher level, of
what they are today. This is not merely "beauty treat-

commendable; it is also a question of the future preser¬
vation of the monuments.
We talk about "living rocks," transferring a biological
simile to geology; but it is certainly true that these
monuments have survived with remarkable durability
because^ they have "lived" in balance with their natural
surroundings.
The present day experts have a healthy respect for the
foresight and judgment of their predecessors of 3,200 years
ago. The Ancients chose the site well, for all the reasons
which have already been discussed, but they also chose
an environment in which exposed masonry could endure.
This involved factors of temperature, humidity, shelter
from the sand blast, of erosive desert wind and a subtle
communion with the waters of the Nile. (Only since the
building of the original Aswan Dam with the resulting
raising of the water has chemical disintegration, in the
base of the Small Temple, begun to appear; this minera-
logical gangrene will be halted by the proposed "surgical"
operation.)
When the dam is filled the Nile will be approximately in
the same relationship to the temples as it is at present,
and at the higher elevation, contours similar to the pre¬
sent ones will recapture the environment. The orienta
tion of the temples will be precisely as now and the
morning sun will continue to bring out of the darkness
the faces of the Ancient Gods.
MISSING LINK SOUGHT IN NUBIA: An American anthro¬

The leaders of the expedition, Dr Ralph Soleckl, Associate
Professor of Anthropology, and Dr Rhodes W. Fairbridge,
Professor of Geology, both from Columbia University,
consider the Nile Valley the only well-watered corridor by
which ancient man might have migrated from the northern
to the southern hemisphere. They are therefore investigat¬
ing silt deposits which probably contain artifacts dating back
much further than the Egyptian civilization. The Columbia
expedition, financed by a $38,500 grant from the US National
Science Foundation and supported by the Sudanese and
U.A.R. Governments and Unesco, plans to save such relics
of ancient man before they are submerged by two hundred
or more feet of water that will rise behind the Aswan Dam.

### 64242: How Philae will be saved

HOW PHILAE
WILL BE SAVED
by Michel Conil Lacoste
Mr. Conil Lacoste is fine arts columnist for the Paris daily newspaper
"Le Monde". He has also been a frequent contributor to the "New
York Times Sunday Magazine", and the French art magazine, "l'sil".
From 1951 to I 953 he was a teaching fellow at the University of Cairo.
or 60 years the island of Philae has been
waging a desperate battle against the waters
of the Nile. This famous shrine of antiquity which, with
its temples dating back to the Ptolemies and the Caesars
has long inspired historians of art and religion and tra¬
vellers the world over, has thus far escaped the death
which Pierre Loti predicted for it years ago. But now its
reprieve from the waters of the Nile is gravely threatened
for all times.
The crux of the problem can be summed up in a few
words:
The island of Philae is located between the old Aswan
dam downstream (that is, to the north) and the new High
Dam under construction upstream. When it is completed
the island will be permanently covered by water and the
temples will be submerged all year long to half their
height, the water level fluctuating daily by as much as
20 feet.
Unless protective measures are taken the temples, which
at present emerge completely from the waters of the Nile
for three months each year, will never again be visible
in their entirety and the harmonious ensemble will be
permanently destroyed. But even more important, the
erosion caused by the daily rise and fall of the waters will
be more harmful to the monuments than their nine-
month total immersion now caused by the old dam. In
the long run the movement of the waters will cut into the
buildings like a knife, causing them to crumble and
spelling their certain destruction.
A;disaster of such magnitude appeared unthink-
-able. As soon as the dangers were realized,
technicians set about to seek ways of saving Philae. In
1955, an Egyptian engineer, Osman R. Rostem, formulated
a plan which was afterwards to serve as the basis for the
adopted scheme to preserve the island. In a study entitled
The Salvage of Philae he wrote: "The most effective solu¬
tion to the question of Philae is the Isolation of the island
from the rest of the reservoir by building a series of small

dams round it and thus preventing the water from sub¬
merging the temples without disturbing them by removal
or raising" (1).
The plan put forward last year by the Netherlands
Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) on the initiative of
the Government of the Netherlands is inspired by the
same principle (2). It was adopted earlier this year by the
United Arab Republic Consultative Committee concerning
the safeguarding of the sites and monuments of Nubia.
Coming up the Nile, the traveller finds Philae about five
miles upstream (or south) from the city of Aswan, a little
beyond the First Cataract. This "City of Temples", as
Champolllon called it, seems to be floating on the Nile
near the eastern bank where the river forms a small bay
strewn with tiny islands, each rich in history, beneath
rocky heights which rise from the shore.
Just west of Philae lies the islet of Agilkia, and beyond
it the large island of Biga. The two Islands together form
a north-south chain which almost isolates this area of the
river from the rest of the waterway, and Philae lies
within their protective shield.
Mr. Rostem's scheme, carefully studied and
elaborated by NEDECO, completes this natural
isolation by a series of three dykes or dams, linking the
islands together and each one to the river bank. The
entire system of islands and dams would thus form a
continuous protective arc to the west of Philae separating
it from the main stream of the Nile. The level of the
reservoir within the protected area would not be affected
by the fluctuations of water between the two dams, and
could thus be kept as low as required so that the island
of Philae would always be visible in its entirely.
It was Herodotus who first referred to Philae as the
"Pearl of Egypt", but the phrase has now become a cliché,
and it is perhaps time we dispensed with it. But there
can be no doubt that the spectacle offered by the sacred
island of Isis with its pylons, its porticos and temples all
reflected in the irridescent waters of the Nile is a sight
which never fails to move the beholder.
Poised on the edge of the Aswan desert, Philae, the first
stop in Egyptian Nubia, is unequalled in beauty except for
Abu Simbel, the last stop before entering Sudanese Nubia
if I can be permitted to compare such widely differing
examples of architecture.

The monuments of Phi¬

by Netherlands experts.
Unesco - Albert Raccah
Before the first Aswan dam was built, a palm grove
(now ruined by the waters) added a note of cool enchant¬
ment to this "Vision of Paradise", as the French Egypto¬
logists, Georges Bénédite and Canon Drioton, called It.
Though deprived of Its vegetation, Philae has maintained
its grace and youthful beauty "like a bird perched on an
island pointing straight south."
Philae is young not only in beauty but also in time,
for none of its temples dates back beyond the 4th century
B.C. This is a short period indeed when compared to the
470 million years of the natural granite amphitheatre
which forms the setting for the "pearl" which is Philae.
But the island is not merely a prodigious site; It is also
a sanctuary, and "an open air museum of Egyptian archi¬
tecture and art."
A sanctuary, because it was from here that the cult of
Isis, the universal goddess and mother of Horus, spread
during Roman times far beyond the realms of Egypt ;
here that "the last refuge of dying paganism" knew its
long twilight and defied the Christian faith long after the
triumph of the new religion had closed the gates of all
other temples along the Nile.
At every step one stumbles upon the sacred at Philae,
on nearby Biga and even beyond, on the large island of
Hesa where funeral steles mark the remains of an ancient
necropolis In which the faithful were buried at a respect¬
ful distance from the tomb of Osiris.
Philae is a museum, or more exactly a city of five
temples, the largest of which is dedicated to Isis. It is
fronted by two gigantic pylons and the famous mammisi
or "birth house" devoted to the annual mystery of the
birth of Horus, the Son-God.
To the east lies Trajan's celebrated Kiosk, to the south
the Kiosk of Nectanebo from which an avenue of sphinxes
(or dromos) leads to the first pylon of the Temple of Isis.
These buildings are completed by the famous gate of
Hadrian with its chapels and three colonnades.
All these monuments with their delicately moulded pil-
.jg lars, their exquisitely intercolonnaded walls, recall the
influence of Greek architecture and form a unique ensem¬
ble in Egyptian art.
In the light of its artistic and cultural importance, it
is not difficult to understand that the experts who
examined the various proposals for saving Philae were as
often swayed by aesthetic considerations as by the tech¬
nical factors involved.
One project proposed that a giant wall or earth dam
30 to 40 feet high be built to isolate the island from the
rest of the Nile. This was rejected as unaesthetic, for the
charm of Philae as a floating island would have been
destroyed. Besides, the scheme was as costly as the pro¬
posal to create an artificial lake.
A second idea proposed the silting up of the area
around Philae by building a low dam between the nor¬
thern end of the island of Biga and the shore, but if
adopted, half of the monuments would have probably
been buried in silt. A third solution called for dismantling
the temples and re-erecting them on the same site after
the ground level had been raised 30 to 40 feet. Such an
operation would have been very costly and difficult, and
entailed risk of damage for the sculptures and inscrip¬
tions. Furthermore it could not have been completed
within the required time limit.
A;Nother plan involved dismantling the temples
-and transferring them to the island of Biga or
to the mainland. In addition to the disadvantages just
indicated, this scheme was ruled out for aesthetic and
archaeological reasons. As Mr. Rostem pointed out as
early as 1955, removing all the temples was out of the
question, while choosing two or three of the most beau¬
tiful ones meant destroying the present architectural
ensemble of the island. Philae's unique character lies in
its subtle blending of stone and water against the back¬
ground of fantastic stones and "elephant-feet" boulders
on the neighbouring islands and river banks. To disturb
this balance and association would be to ruin everything,
or almost.
As to the tränier of the monuments to Biga ; it would
have destroyed the precise historical and mythological

relationship between the two islands. Philae was the tra¬
ditional abode of Isis, Biga the sacrosanct realm of Osiris,
unapproachable to humans. Regrouping the monuments
of both divinities on Biga would have been an act of
sacrilege in the eyes of Egyptologists, and at the very least
would have deprived them of their present significance.
Actually two of the proposed solutions mentioned, i.e.
the raising of the monuments and their dismantling and
re-erection elsewhere, had been envisaged at the time of
the construction of the first Aswan dam in 1902. Fortu¬
nately, the final decision was to leave the island as it was
despite the risks involved, which were further increased
by the successive raisings of the dam in 1907-1912 and
1929-1934. But this brave decision resulted in two vital
measures being taken on the initiative of the then director
of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, Gaston Maspero: the
systematic recording of all the monuments and inscrip¬
tions on the island (just as this is now being done in the
whole area threatened by the new Aswan Dam); the
consolidation and reinforcement of the foundations of all
the monuments. It is to this latter, providential precau¬
tionary measure that Philae probably owes its survival.
Egyptologists were for a time panic-stricken when the
first effects of the temple's long months of submersion
became known. When the monuments emerged from the
waters, the sandstone walls had become "so soft that a
finger could be stuck into them", and the tourist boats
indeed caused a certain amount of damage by scraping
against the supporting columns of this artificial Venice.
But this damage was insignificant compared to the havoc
which might have resulted had not the foundations of the
temples been solidly reinforced.
All in all Philae has stood up well to the waters. And
in one sense the annual immersion has even done some
good. For though the flood waters have effaced the poly¬
chrome blues and whites which formerly adorned certain
capitals, the same waters have cleansed the stone of
destructive salts.
Thus, paradoxically, the total immersion of the temples,
which was expected to lead to disaster, now appears less
harmful than the partial immersion which will result
from the construction of the new High Dam. What is
more, the 1902 decision to allow the temples to be sub¬
merged part of the year, taken only as a last resort, now
proves to have been the one solution which did not com¬
promise the future. Had the monuments been raised or
removed to another site, today's "ideal" solution (which
apparently was not studied or foreseen 60 years ago)
would now be out of the question. Thus the drama of the
1900s has made possible the rescue operation of the 1960s.
The NEDECO plan, submitted by the Netherlands
Government and now adopted, will safeguard the Isle of
Philae in its original setting and splendour by the cons¬
truction of three dykes, creating a low lying artificial lake
within the high Aswan reservoir. In other words Philae
will be protected by an artificial lake within an artificial
lake something like a "double-boiler". The "inside boiler"
will be the protective barrier formed by the continuous
chain of islands and dykes abutting on the shore.
In the summer of 1960 a Netherlands team carried out
a preliminary investigation on the site gathering prccLse
data on topography, water levels, meteorology, geology,
building materials, and the alignment of the dams. Valu¬
able topographical data, results of soundings and aerial
photographs were made available to the mission by
various Government ministries of the U.A.R.
T,he team also took advantage of the prelimi¬
nary studies previously carried out near the
Sadd el Aali dam site. They examined vital questions such
as water evaporation, wind speeds and the resulting waves
in Aswan lake, water seepage and capillary action. The
local Nilometer -was called upon to furnish much informa¬
tion concerning water levels, while the river bed was thor¬
oughly sounded and vertical exploration carried out
systematically in the vicinity of the sacred island.
On the basis of this preliminary research, the following
proposals were put forward. The level of the Philae lake
was set at 323 feet, the top of the works at 330 feet. The *q
north and south dykes would be built first from the bank
abutments outward. Rock fill would be used near the

banks and sand in the centre part, reinforced by concrete
caissons or a double row of steel sheet piling.
Last of all, the dyke joining the two Islands would be
built. Though presenting less problems from the tech¬
nical point of view, this dam is the one that will close
the lake and it will have to withstand currents of 10 feet
per second. As the gap ls reduced, at the final stages, the
pressure of water will steadily Increase. So this centre
dam will be of the rock fill type. During the actual
closing, the authorities will be asked to keep the level of
the Aswan Dam constant.
The alignment of the dykes proposed in the draft pro¬
ject is a tentative one; the final alignment can be deter¬
mined only after further soundings have been carried out.
At the end of last year the authors of the report were
in favour of the shortest span for the northern dyke
(though this ls not always the cheapest in public works).
This dyke would join Agilkla Island to the mainland at
Tabyet el Sheikh. They were even more strongly in favour
of this course for the centre dyke the one joining Agil¬
kla and Biga Islands. For the southern dyke further
soundings will be required to determine whether a slightly
crooked alignment may not be technically preferable.
This is a question to be discussed and carefully studied.
The plan Mr. Rostem prepared' six years ago provided for
somewhat different alignments from NEDECO's.
WATERTiGHTNESs is another problem. Up to a
point seepage can be prevented by protective
blankets on the upstream slopes. Grout-curtains will also
be used to filter out sand and silt. But the Dutch consider
that it would be more economical to allow for a pumping
station than a costly array of devices to prevent seepage,
for these would raise the costs considerably. Having re¬
gard to the water balance due to infiltration and evapora¬
tion closely calculated for the proposed Philae Lake
works the engineers have determined that a pump
discharging 350 litres a second would be the most
economical solution for the annual surplus of from 50 to
100 million square feet of water seepage over evaporation
losses. Similarly, the lake waters could be changed, and if
the pumping capacity were increased to 465 litres a second,
the pump could also be used for discharging seepage from
Shellal on the east bank, in the event that the Egyptian
authorities decide to put that area under cultivation.
The Netherlands plan, briefly described here, will thus
be executed under optimum conditions. Elaborated by
engineers of a country specialized by its geographical
situation in hydraulics, it has been unanimously approved,
and no alternative plan is under consideration. The
Government of the Netherlands has offered to perfect it
and the estimated total cost of TJS56 millions now seems
assured since the President of the United States last April
recommended that the equivalent of this sum in Egyptian
currency be appropriated for the salvage of Philae. And
yet, actual operations are not scheduled to begin before
1968...
This may appear to be an astonishingly long delay, until
one realizes that at present the island and its sur¬
roundings are under water for most of the year. It is
only when the new Aswan dam is finally completed in
1968 that the waters of the Nile will be contained and
engineers will be able to pitch their tents on dry land
and move forward their equipment.

### 64243: Nubia today; a vast archaeological camp

ALL OF NUBIA IS TODAY AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL CAMP. HERE EXCAVATORS ARE SEEN AT WORK AT THE ANCIENT SITE OF ANIBA.

NUBIA TODAY: A VAST
ARCHAEOLOGICAL CAMP
by Louis A. Christophe
Louis A. Christophe, a well-known French Egyptologist, is
Unesco Representative for the Nubian Campaign in Cairo,
and Assistant Secretary-General of the Institut d'Egypte.
H UNDREDS of archaeologists from more than 15
countries are today working against time to
survey, explore and excavate the complex and long-buried
vestiges of countless civilizations which, from the be¬
ginnings of man's history, have left their marks upon the
Nubian valley. As early as 1955 when the announcement
was made that the Aswan High Dam would be built, both
the Governments of the United Arab Republic and the
Sudan Immediately began to consider ways in which the
archaeological sites situated in the area to be flooded
could be fully exploited before they are covered by the
lake waters.
A priority list of sites to be excavated In the Sudan
was drawn up on the basis of a thorough aerial survey.
In Egypt, excavations which had been halted 25 years
ago along the Nile near Ballana and Qustul were resumed.
At the same time, the Egyptian Antiquities Department
suspended excavation work in other areas in order to
concentrate solely upon the Nubian valley. A request
was sent out to all foundations and institutions already
engaged in work at Pharaonic sites in Egypt to concen¬
trate on the Nubian portion of the Nile valley.
The first response was disappointing. Only two scien¬
tific expeditions were sent to Egyptian Nubia one by the
German Institute at Cairo, and the other by Milan Uni¬
versity. In addition, the Egypt Exploration Society of
London undertook excavations at Buhen In the Sudan.
With dozens of other sites still to be excavated, it
became more and more apparent as the months passed
that some new action was needed to ensure that all
archaeological features oí Nubia would be thoroughly
explored In the relatively short time which was left.
The Minister of Culture for trje UAR, faced with this
pressing problem, out of all proportion to his nation's
resources, appealed to Unesco. The Sudan, whose sites
in the Nubian valley have been scarcely touched before,
made a similar appeal.
In answer to this appeal, a Unesco mission of experts
was sent to Nubia and on the basis of their report, the

TOMB

CLUE
TO NUBIAN
PRINCE
Prince Heka Nefer of Miam,
spent his childhood in the
palace of King Tutankhamon
three thousand years ago and
has long been known to Egyp¬
tologists because of inscrip¬
tions telling his life's story and
a well-preserved painting on
the wall of Huy's Tomb at
Thebes (right) which pictures
and names him as the foremost
in a long column of tribute
bearers before the monarch.
But the whereabouts of his
kingdom in Nubia and his
burial place had never been
discovered. Recently, an expe¬
dition from' Yale and Pennsyl¬
vania Universities, whileexplor-
ing and excavating ancient
ruins in the Aniba area which
will be flooded when the Aswan
dam is completed, discovered
a tomb which is believed to be
that of Heka Nefer. Although
it was long ago plundered of
its treasures, Yale archaeolo¬
gist William Kelly Simpson
discovered five small funer¬
ary statues (inset) bearing the
name and title of the prince.
Inscriptions on the wall of the
tomb, as well as rock carvings
nearby also identified the tomb
as that of the Prince of Miam.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL CAMP (Cont'd from p. 2I)
Dividing up the sites
among the searchers
appeal was made by the Director-General to save the
monuments and sites of ancient Nubia.
This appeal met with an Immediate response. Both the
UAR and the Sudan received generous offers of co¬
operation. Archaeological work began almost at once and
now, less than 18 months after the appeal, the results are
so encouraging that It ls almost certain that the great
bulk of archaeological work will be accomplished before
the lake waters bury this area forever.
Because Sudanese Nubia ls less well known than
Egypt, the Sudanese authorities decided to begin with a
general archaeological survey of all the threatened
territory. The Antiquities Department, with the help of
three experts made available by Unesco, has now pros¬
pected the whole of the west bank from the Sudanese-
Egyptian border down to Buhen. A general survey of the
east bank from the border down to the northern outskirts
of Wadi Haifa was made by a Joint mission from the
Scandinavian countries. By the end of the forthcoming
winter campaign, all the archaeological sites of Upper
Nubia threatened with submersion will very probably have
been explored and Identified.
When the original Aswan Dam was raised, first In the
years 1907 to 1912, then again In 1929-1934, the Antiquities
Department in Egypt excavated all the ancient sites In
Lower Nubia. (The Sudan was not affected then as It will
be by the new dam.) Nevertheless, as an additional pre¬
caution, another general archaeological survey was
recently organized In collaboration with London Univer¬
sity to make sure that no sites still remained burled under
the sand. As a result of this survey four Important sites
have already been discovered between the Sudanese
border and Korosko. Next season the expedition expects
to complete Its survey In the northern part of Lower
Nubia.
Yiet another vital problem had to be solved.
Nubia's prehistoric cultures had never been
thoroughly Investigated on the spot. Now, Columbia
University, USA, has organized an expedition which will
make a general survey of the prehistoric sites of Sudanese
Nubia and the southern reaches of Egyptian Nubia.
This mission ls expected to cover the whole of the
threatened area before the flood waters arrive.
These general surveys are invaluable. Not only do they
give a true picture of the archaeological terrain, but they
serve as a guide to Institutes and foundations which have
not as yet participated In excavations in Nubia.
As offers of help have streamed In from all over the
world, most Institutes and foundations have already been
allotted the concessions they requested. Nearly all the
sites in Egyptian Nubia have already been conceded and
In Sudanese Nubia the position will doubtless be the same
long before the time for submersion.

### 64245: Floating laboratories on the Nile

FLOATING LABORATORIES
ON THE NILE
by Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt
Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt, Curator of the Egyptian Antiquities
Department at the Louvre Museum, Paris, is Unesco Consultant to
the Egyptian Documentation Centre set up by the UAR In Cairo.

the beginning of 1955, the normally all
but deserted banks of the Nubian Nile
suddenly quickened with life. Archaeologists arrived and
commenced operations. Teams from the Documentation
Centre on Ancient Egypt in Cairo worked unremittingly
from dawn to dusk, winter and summer alike, oblivious to
their isolated surroundings.
For the past fifteen years or so, Egyptological studies
had been at a standstill in the region above the First
Cataract of the Nile, stretching as far as the Second
Cataract close to the Sudanese frontier. It seemed as
if no excavation or archaeological survey had the power
to lure the successors of Champollion. Only a sparse
handful of archaeological missions were at work, either
in the Sudan to the south of the area threatened by the
High Aswan Dam or in the north of Aswan in that land
so richly strewn with temples.
The launching of Unesco's appeal brought a sudden
change in the scene of operations. Investigators working
in accessible sites wound up their studies, packed their
equipment and, spurred by a sense of duty, feelings of
loyalty to a common cause or an urge to equal or excel
their fellow archaeologists, set off for parched and mys¬
terious Nubia. From now on they were initiating them¬
selves into the archaeological story of Nubia which,
though often seeming to be a distorted image of the
Egyptian parent state, had also many lessons to teach
them.
Those who today follow the course of the Nubian Nile
are no longer likely to have the same feeling of solitude
which, even a few years ago, was a common experience
for anyone returning to the camp of the Documentation
Centre where Egyptians and Europeans, latter-day
pioneers In a modern adventure, together built the
foundations of a new collaboration in Egyptology.
Nowadays it is hardly possible to travel 15 to 20 miles
without finding a boat moored to the bank. Passengers
in the regular weekly mailboat which serves this distant
land are always surprised and fascinated by these floating
camps, which also excite the curiosity of tourists who,
thanks to the international appeal for the safeguarding
of Nubia's monuments, are now rediscovering the great
forgotten sanctuaries.
E1 ach boat encountered is practically certain to
i be the floating home of an archaeological
expedition: Spanish, Italian (from Milan or Rome);
Austrian, Yugoslav, American (from Chicago, Yale or
Pennsylvania) ; Polish, Swiss, German, Dutch, Czecho¬
slovak, Belgian, English (from Oxford, Cambridge or Lon¬
don), French (from Paris, Cairo, Lyons or Strasbourg).
Others again have been chartered by fact-collecting
missions Russian, Japanese, Indian and others.
The teams from the Documentation Centre are thus no
longer working alone in Nubia. Many other investigators
have brought unaccustomed animation to the sun-parched
river banks. Today too the activities of the Centre
have been redoubled. Though it has entrusted the
Oriental Institute of Chicago and the French Institute
of Oriental Archaeology in Cairo with the completion in
extenso of the final surveys of the temples of Beit el
Wadi and Wadi es Sebua, it has itself shouldered the
immense task of surveying, down to the smallest detail,
all the other sanctuaries of Nubia.
During the first meeting of the Consultative Committee
of Experts set up by the Government of the United Arab
Republic, the Egyptologist members spontaneously under¬
took to follow a set of rules designed for the common good.
The system used by the foreign missions for recording
information about the various monuments is based on the
techniques developed and perfected by the Cairo Centre
and follows the demands of Egyptological fact-finding.
The Documentation Centre which is, in fact, the na¬
tional archives of Egyptian archaeology, is to receive a
copy of all the monument surveys completed by foreign
missions, the missions naturally retaining the publica¬
tion rights for these reports for a pre-determined period.
The Centre, however, is making itself responsible for
nearly all the surveys. It has already boosted its activities
tenfold thanks to the construction of a magnificent
floating-laboratory in which it is possible to go on working
in the hottest weather (summer temperatures sometimes
reach 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and which also solves the
water problem. Heavily impregnated with silt in summer,
the water must be constantly filtered and cooled for all
purposes including photographic development.
D| uRiNG every season nowadays there are always
several of the Centre's missions operating
from fully equipped vessels. Egypt's technical and scien¬
tific teams, well versed in this specialized and delicate
work of collaboration, also are receiving help on an
appreciable scale from other countries. Unesco continues
to provide an adviser and several specialists. At this
phase of the campaign foreign assistance comes indivi¬
dually from countries responding to the appeal. They
have sent specialists in philology and archaeology and
also technicians, and have provided the funds to maintain
them.
The results of all the surveys are centralized at the
Documentation Centre and following the 1961 summer
missions a satisfying volume of work has been achieved.
Surveys on the temples of Abu Simbel are virtually com¬
pleted as are those on the small temples of Abu Oda and
Jebel Shams. The list of other surveying results is im¬
pressive: the tomb-chapel of Pennut at Aniba, the Amada
temple, part of the Dakka temple and the rock-hewn
chapel at Ellesya, part of the Wadi es Sebua temple and
the temple of Gerf Hussein; the immense cliff of Ka¬
labsha with its adjoining chapels, the Beit el Wali temple,
the Taffeh chapels and those of Kertassi (not forgetting
the astonishing Kertassi quarries) and finally the Debod
monument.
At the gateway to Egyptian Nubia, the island marvel
that is Philae, with all its sanctuaries, has not yet been
completely surveyed. Long before the Aswan High Dam
created a threat to the island a French mission and then
a German one had begun to publish the results of their
surveys. But these results were minute in comparison
with all that remains to be done.
Now, at any rate, the work of systematically examining
the island, is under way. Last year two French epigra¬
phers sent by the French National Council of Scientific
Research, joined their Egyptian colleagues in making as
complete an inventory as possible of the Greek epigraphs
on the Sacred Island.
At the same time a mission from the French National
Geographic Institute, including five photogrammetry

specialists worked alongside the team of the Docu¬
mentation Centre and an Egyptian photogrammetry tech¬
nician, to make a complete record (architectural mea¬
surements and photographs) of all the monuments on
the Island and of the Island Itself.
Working In the oppressive summer heat, they continued
their task in the temples which are only freed by the
Nile waters during this season. They finished making
surveys of the sanctuaries of Debod, Taffeh North and the
small kiosk of Kertassi only a few days before these
monuments were dismantled for removal. This would
have been the last year in which these sanctuaries would
have appeared above the waters.
They went on to make surveys of all the quarries
at Kertassi, and of Belt el Wall; they completed the work
at Kalabsha, begun two years earlier, and continued
operations at the temple of Dendur, at Gerf Hussein
and at Dakka.
They even made full surveys of the Byzantine citadel at
Sabagura which had only been brought to light a few
weeks earlier. Classical epigraphers carried out research
and verification work, made impressions, photographed
and copied all the Greek inscriptions in the Kertassi
quarries and on the temple of Dakka.
In this race against time the work has called for perfect
precision and has raised multiple problems. It has
demanded from all those engaged upon it a rigorous sense
of accuracy, great physical resistance and, above all, an
attitude of complete unselfishness the ability to sink
all personal interests in a task for the common good.
Altogether it has been an extraordinary example of Inter¬
national collaboration producing unhoped for results.
Some of Nubia's sanctuaries can only be pre¬
served in the hallowed sites chosen for them by
priests and deities for they fit so perfectly into their
surroundings that It would be difficult to imagine them in
any other lieu. But there are others, less famous or whose
meaning is not so closely associated with their settings,
and these can be moved and preserved for posterity.
In contrast to the two major monuments of Philae and
Abu Simbel there are other temples which must be
uprooted and taken away if they are not to be lost for
ever. Some are hewn from the solid rock and their trans¬
fer raises multiple problems, some of which have already
been resolved. Others are built on the banks of the Nile
and can most likely be removed piece by piece along with
their foundations.
Yet even this operation is not as simple as it sounds,
particularly when a building is made up of regular stone
blocks coated with plaster. The plaster, moulded on the
outlines of the ornamental reliefs, is itself covered with
paintings which do not correspond in size or form with
the surfaces beneath them.
It is thus impossible to remove the stones one by one
without destroying an essential decorative element or at
the very least seriously damaging something that has-
come down to us, despite religious feuds, wars or neglect,
through thousands of years. A case in point is the

charming temple of Amada. To plan the safety of this
rare treasure France recently set up a special mission
supervised by an Inspector General of Historic Monuments.
Another country, the Federal Republic of Germany, has
decided to carry out the complete removal of the great
Graeco-Roman temple of Kalabsha an ambitious
operation likely to pose many problems. Kalabsha, like
other temples dating from the Graeco-Roman period in
Nubia, is built close to the river bank and for the past
50 years or so it has been swallowed up for nine months
out of every 12 by the waters of the Nile. The fact that
its paintings have not survived the annual immersion has
at least disposed of one of the dismantling problems.
It was to monuments of this type that the Antiquities
Service of the United Arab Republic turned its attention
when it discovered that two small Graeco-Roman temples
situated near the spot height 100 metres above sea level
would be freed by the waters for only a few days during
the next two or three summers. They had to be saved
while they were still accessible.
Without waiting for a foreign mission to embark on the
rescue of these sites, the Antiquities Service, helped by
the Documentation Centre and several Polish, Belgian and
French specialists, undertook to dismantle the Debod
temple and to uncover in a basin at the Kalabsha channel
the remains of the Taffeh North chapel which had long
since collapsed and was hidden under the mud of the Nile.
Between July and September 1960 the teams hastily sur¬
veyed and collected information at these two sanctuaries,
while specialists numbered the blocks of stone, traced
their positions on reconstruction plans, packed every
painted or inscribed stone in cases, established index cards
for each piece and then took away all this material.
In many cases the cement used in the restoration work
dating from earlier this century and supervised by Gaston
Maspero, the then Director of the Egyptian Antiquities
Service, which held the blocks together during their
annual immersion, was found to be more solid than the
rocks. This made dismantling even more delicate.
Working all day under the pitiless sun in the stifling,
airless desert atmosphere, harassed by the knowledge that
the waters would soon rise again and forced to live In
overcrowded conditions on their boats, the teams never¬
theless finished their task in time and brought to Ele¬
phantine Island the cargos of stones in their wooden cases.
These temples of Debod and Taffeh have been design¬
ated by the Government of the United Arab Republic as
gifts for countries which contribute actively to the work
of saving Nubia's monuments. They are not to be recon¬
structed in Egypt. Instead their stones together with all
the scientific and technical documentation concerning
them will be handed over to new guardians.
In addition, the Ministry of Culture decided to dis¬
mantle and carry away the Kertassi chapel, taking advan¬
tage of the equipment that had been brought to Nubia
for the original removal operations (boats, scaffolding,
etc.) and of the presence of specialists used to handling
large blocks of masonry.
This operation was completed in September 1960, but
before any of the walls and colonnades were dismantled
teams of photogrammetric specialists made complete
recordings of the chapel. Kertassi is now carefully stored,
stone by stone, in packing cases. It will be raised again
not far from its original site on a cliff on the west Nubian
bank, overlooking the great lake.
All that can now be seen on the former sites of these
three sanctuaries are traces of their foundations and
beneath these the remains of earlier temples.
It is now the turn of the diggers. The recording, inch
by inch, of these buildings ls to be followed by studies
and searches on and under the ground.
Thus a new archaeological phase is due to begin.
Fresh facts in the story of the great religious edifices
of the Egyptians kings in Nubia are about to be revealed.
And whether or not the archaeological prize Includes gold
and precious stones does not really matter. Those who
search are pledged to rescue priceless artistic treasures 29
from oblivion and to bring to light the buried pages of
history.

KALABSHA
One of the finest examples
of Roman Egyptian art.
Known as the "Luxor of
Nubia". Temple raised to
Mandulls, the Nubian Sun
God. The reliefs are
connected with his cult.
Almost as large as Notre-
Dame de Paris. The German
Federal Republic has agreed
to dismantle and remove it.
DENDUR
Known as the Temple of
Augustus, Dendur was dedi¬
cated to two heroes who
were drowned. It still has
its landing-stage on the
Nile and its monumental
doorway. Richly decorated
inside and out with intaglio
and low reliefs. Offered
by the Egyptian Government
in recognition of foreign aid.
MAHARRAQAH
Colonnade similar to those of the Roman Ptolemaic period (Philae,
Kalabsha, Dendur, etc.). First described by the Swiss traveller and
orientalist, John Lewis Burckhardt, who discovered the Great Temple
of Abu Simbel, almost buried in the sand, in 1813. To be transferred.
WADI ES SEBUA
Temple dating from the time of Rameses II. Hemi-speos (that is,
partly hewn out of the rock). An avenue of tiaraed sphinxes leads up
to the pylon. Incised and low reliefs abound. Many Christian
paintings attest to the transformation of the temple into a church.

Thutmosis III. The inside
walls are entirely covered
with reliefs. Offered by
Egypt in recognition of
foreign aid. It will be
excavated and placed else¬
where in the cliff face.
KASR IBRIM (Church)
The church stands within
fortress. Some of the stones
were doubtless taken from
an earlier Egyptian temple.
A column of Aswan granite
is still standing near the

ABU ODA
Temple hewn out of the
rock in 1325 B.C. Con¬
verted into a . church in
Christian times. Some of
the paintings that covered
the Pharaonic reliefs still
exist, including a large Christ
on the ceiling. Will be
transferred in separate parts
to a specially prepared site.
JEBEL
Tiny rock-hewn chapel dedi¬
cated to the Nubian Prince
Poeri some thousand years
before our era. Poeri was
known as the Royal Son of
Kush. He occupied the
important post of Royal
Fly-flapper. A statue of
Rameses the Great was set
up in the chapel. All the
figures face this statue.
SEMNA WEST
Imposing fortress built two thousand years before Christ. With Semna
East ¡t defended the southern frontier of Egypt under the Middle
Kingdom. Temple built by Thutmosis III. Numerous coloured
incisions and reliefs. To be transferred to a nearby cliff on the
opposite bank of the Nile.
SEMNA EAST
Temple of Sudanese sandstone built under Thutmosis III. Inscriptions
and reliefs. In the West basement, hieroglyphs cut into the rock
recall the fact that in I 800 B.C. the flood level of the Nile was 26 feet
higher than it is today. It is assumed that the oldest dam in history
existed towards the rocky spurs ofSemna. The temple will be removed. 31

### 64249: Journey to the land of Kush

JOURNEY TO THE
LAND OF KUSH
by Rex Keating
Our train was running slowly across a plain; it
was a sandy plain blown into wavelets by the
strong north wind which whistled through the cracks in
the carriage windows. The train travelled slowly other¬
wise it would have torn up the tracks. Inside the
compartment, choking dust hung in the air like a mist.
Outside, through the carriage window, tinted as a protec¬
tion from the harsh light, three colours were dominant,
the yellow of the sand, the blue of the sky and the purple
of the rocks lining the horizon. Harsh colours all. In
this stretch of desert south of Wadi Haifa in the Sudan,
nothing grows, because here it rains perhaps only once
in ten years.
Over to the west of the railway flows the river Nile,
through landscapes no less harsh and forbidding. This
land was known to the ancient Egyptians as Kush :
today we call it Sudanese Nubia. The great lake which
will build up behind the new High Dam at Aswan will
flood far south through Egyptian Nubia, across the border
Into Sudanese Nubia, where it will engulf first the Wadi
Haifa district, then the Second Cataract, finally to end
just short of the Third Cataract, which is the extreme
limit of the flood, some hundred miles inside the Sudan.
What makes Sudanese Nubia so Important to
archaeologists? Professor W.B. Emery of Lon¬
don University has answered this question. "It is the an¬
cient towns, the cemeteries and the old fortresses of Nu¬
bia," he says, "which cannot be considered beautiful but
which are absolute treasure houses of Information about
the life, conditions, hopes and aspirations of our fore¬
bears. These remains must be explored and excavated
without fall."
A few months ago, I found myself in one of those for¬
gotten fortresses high above the Cataract. It was Shelfak,
picturesquely named by the ancient Egyptians "Curbing
the Foreign Countries." In this timeless setting the past
assumes almost tangible form and I found myself pictur¬
ing an Egyptian sentry of long ago looking out over the
river to the hostile desert beyond.
The wind was blowing strongly, whistling among the
rocks and sending up swirls of black dust from the mud
bricks of the sentry-walk below my shoes. With the
wind in my face, I looked towards the north along the
length of the Nile, and there about a mile away, was
a rocky Island, b'igger than most and rising to a peak.
Growing out of the peak was another fortress, its every
detail visible clearly in the crystal atmosphere.
My ancient Egyptian sentry would have seen the rocky
peak, but he would not have seen the fortress, because
this was built some 3,000 years after his time by a Chris¬
tian kinglet of Nubia. Neither would he have seen yet
another fortress, built at the end of the nineteenth
century A.D. by Kitchener in his advance against the
Dervish armies.
From this remote Nubian fortress, one can span four
thousand years of history. Forty turbulent centuries of
life along the banks of this stretch of the Nile. For this
was always a great highway between the Mediterranean
civilizations of the north and Africa to the south.
Armies have struggled along it for close on 5,000 years,

GUARDIANS OF THE NILE. On their southern frontiers,
in present-day Sudan, the ancient Egyptians selected this
site, where the Nile narrows sharply between granite cliffs,
to build two forbidding fortresses 40 centuries ago. Semna
West (top of aerial photo) is clearly visible amid the light-
coloured sandy wastes of the more arid western bank of the
river. Directly opposite is the fortress of Semna East dis¬
tinguishable from the surrounding maze of rock gulleys
by the straight lines of its fortified walls. Both fortresses
will be submerged, but their important temples, dating from
between I 500 and I 400 B.C., are to be removed to safety.

From the ruined walls of this ancient Egyp¬
tian fortress at Shelfak in Sudanese Nubia
the eye spans 4,000 years of turbulent
history along the stretch of the Nile it
once guarded. On a rocky island (upper
centre) are the remains of a fortress built
.about 1,000 years ago by a Christian king¬
let of Nubia. Away on the horizon is
yet another fortress, built by troops of
General Kitchener in his advance against
Dervish armies in the late 1 9th century.

LAND OF KUSH (Cont'd)
The discovery a few years ago of the great fortress of Buhen
near Wadi Haifa revolutionized previous conceptions of
Pharaonic military architecture. Here, workers continue
the excavation of its vast fortifications which once
kept careful watch over the strategic area around the
Second Nile Cataract, dividing Upper and Lower Nubia.
The people who dwell today near the Second Cataract of
the Nile offer living examples of Nubia's remote past. Their
lives are rooted deeply in unbroken threads of tradition.
Below, typical portal decoration of a contemporary Nub¬
ian house containing symbols and emblems some of which
date back through the Christian era to Pharaonic times.
HIDDEN SECRETS
OF THE SECOND
CATARACT
the soldiers of Pharaoh, the dark-skinned warriors from
the kingdoms to the south, Greek mercenaries, sweating
Roman legionaries, the troops of Islam, the helmeted men
of Kitchener's army5 000 years of marching and count¬
ermarching.
I reflected that at last peace was to come forever to
this land, for Nubia with its rocks, its temples, its
fortresses, its memories of a past incredibly remote, is
doomed to vanish beneath the rising waters of
the Nile, the river which has given it life from the
beginning of time.
But Sudanese Nubia holds more than monuments and
relics: it contains the people of the Second Cataract and
they are a living example of life in Nubia's remote past,
as Mr. L.P. Klrwan, Director of London's Royal Geogra¬
phical Society, recently told me.
Towards the end of the 19th century the railway from
Wadi Haifa struck off across the eastern desert, leaving
these people In a great bend of the Nile and creating
an archaeological museum filled not only with monuments
but with memories of the past.
Their folklore is fascinating In this respect and it links
up with archaeological discovery and literary evidence
but, as Klrwan pointed out, the people of the Second
Cataract must leave their ancient land before the waters
close over It. They are to be moved to an area some hun¬
dreds of miles away and Inevitably the unbroken threads
of tradition rooted deep In their homeland will be severed.
Within a generation or so the folklore and traditions will
be lost so It ls important for a social anthropology survey
to be made before the exodus gets under way.
Klrwan feels that any such survey should note carefully
the architecture and decorative designs of modern Nu¬
bian houses: some of the emblems used date right back
through the Fung Kingdom of the 15th century to the
early Christian era and earlier still to Pharaonic times.
I myself found an example of these enduring
traditions in the heart of the Second Cata¬
ract. From the Semna fortresses I had followed an
ancient wall running north along the river bank for about
seven miles to a point opposite the island fortress of
Uronartl ("Arti" is Nubian for "island"). I shall never
forget the setting.
The island is long and narrow, close on a mile In
length, and the fortress springs from a crag high above
the Nile at the northernmost Up of the island. The black
rocks dazzle the eyes, their surfaces polished to a metallic
hardness by immemorial floods. Here the Nile runs swift
and deep.
We crossed in a boat as broad as it was long, flat-
bottomed, and of a construction unfamiliar to me. And
here the Second Cataract yielded up one of Its many
secrets. Professor Torgny Säve-Söderbergh of Upsala
University, Sweden, with whom I was travelling, explain¬
ed that this boat was built in the tradition of ancient
Egypt as depicted on the walls of the tombs. So we
sailed across the Nile to the Island of the King, Uro¬
nartl, on a craft that would have been familiar to a sol¬
dier of the Pharaoh Sesostris, looking down from the sen¬
try-walk high above our heads.
Another fortress on the horizon, built some 3,000 years
after Sesostris' day was a reminder that Christianity
endured In this part of Nubia for close on 300 years, until
the Increasing pressure of Islam finally overwhelmed it
and the many churches and monasteries fell into ruin.
A few days later, in Khartum, Professor P. Shennle of
the University of Ghana spoke to me about this fascin¬
ating period of history. He pointed out that the Christian 35
kingdoms of Nubia, lasting from roughly the middle of
the 6th century till at least the 14th, are hardly known.

ISLAND WORKSHOP OF STONE AGE MAN

They begin with the coming of missionaries from Byzan¬
tium, sent by the Emperor Justinian in the middle of
the 6th century, who came up through Egypt to the then
pagan peoples of Nubia.
Still in existence are the writings of the Syrian, John
of Ephesus, which give a vivid account of the coming of
one of these missionaries, of how he suffered from the
heat and hid himself in a cave with his feet In a basin
of cold water to keep cool during the hot weather, an
action with which many of us who know the Sudan
during the summer months will be in great sympathy.
On many of the little ruined churches of the area are
frescoes of gods, of the Virgin, of saints, all showing very
strong Byzantine characteristics. The pottery of the peo¬
ple is also of extremely good quality, a fine painted ware
with many motives derived from the Mediterranean.
It is also interesting to see that this State maintained
its theological links with Byzantium and did not sub¬
scribe to the Monophyslte heresy of the Coptic Church
in Egypt; as a result of this we And gravestones written
in Greek, although in many cases a very bad Greek, right
up until the 12th century.
Professor Shennie pointed out that these are the most
remote Greek inscriptions known anywhere In the world,
and It is quite clear that those who were writing them
could have had no contact with Greece itself, prob¬
ably for many generations.
The Nubians live in a valley of the Nile, which, since
the continent of Africa attained the shape we recognize
today, has been the main overland route between north
and south between the Mediterranean coast and the
vast ethnic group of the Negro peoples of Equatorial
Africa. Man must always have used the Nile valley as a
convenient highway. Anthropologists have even sug¬
gested that Central Africa may have seen Man's first
triumph over his material surroundings. This is a
measure of the importance of the prehistoric sites which
have yet to be discovered on the banks of the Nile.
Only two years ago near the extreme southern limit of
the area to be flooded, a discovery of the first impor¬
tance was made on the prehistoric terraces of the Nile:
among many animal bones, lay the jawbone of a Nean¬
derthal man.
Traces of prehistoric man are plain to see on all sides
in the Second Cataract. On the island of Uronarti, for
example, Professor Soderbergh showed me what he des¬
cribed as a "Stone Age workshop." There lying on the
surface were typical mesolithic Implements. Professor
Soderbergh remarked that Uronarti must have been
inhabited for tens of thousands of years and that before
It was lost it must be surveyed and excavated so that
its whole history might be revealed.
This deserted island in its harsh and lifeless, yet aus¬
terely beautiful, setting, induces a fascination that Is
curiously disturbing. On all sides are tangible signs of
the generations of men and women who once lived here,
stretching back to the shadowy dawn of history and far
earlier, for possibly fifteen thousand years and more. By
comparison, the Middle Kingdom fortress on Its crag is
a manifestation of the modern world.
The earliest of the peoples of ancient Egypt regarded
the area south of Wadi Haifa with awe. Its inhabitants
were the fierce cattle owners against whom they built
the Immense fortresses which still stand along the length
of the Cataract, spectacular even in their ruin. Yet a
thousand years before the fortresses frowned over the
river, travellers and expeditions from Egypt came this
way.
Standing back from the river Nile ls an isolated hill;
a shoulder of rock fallen from the hill above and standing
a yard or so away from it, conceals on its inner face on
Inscription. This is by far the earliest Inscription in
Sudanese and Egyptian Nubia and it records in archaic
hieroglyphs that an expedition sent by King Djer of
Egypt passed this rock on its way to the south. King
Djer was the third king of Egypt's first dynasty, an Incre¬
dibly remote figure who ruled at the very dawn of Egypt's
history some 5,000 years ago. Yet here, in effect, is his
signature, a clear Indication that he did once exist.

between the Mediterranean civilizations to the north
and those of Central Africa to the south. Here, along
the length of the Second Cataract, the peoples of
Ancient Egypt built a series of immense fortresses.
Ancient hieroglyphs and carvings on this rock slab at Jebel Sheikh cl Suleiman,
in the Sudan, are the oldest inscriptions yet found in Sudanese and Egyptian
Nubia. Some 5,000 years old, they record that an expedition sent by King
Djer, third monarch of Egypt's first dynasty, passed the rock on Its way south.
On the rocks round about are other inscriptions, left
by travellers, armies, expeditions, traders, who passed this
way during the next 2,000 years or so, but it is the Djer
Inscription with its archaic lettering that stirs the ima¬
gination. Who led the expedition of King Djer and how
big it was, we shall never know. But we do know that
they were very brave men. They believed, In those early
days, that they were venturing into what they called
"the Land of Ghosts," a territory of nameless terrors,
where giants and pygmies lived and monstrous animals.
Worst of all, they were venturing to the very edge of
Amentat, the dreadful "Abode of the Dead." How many
similar rock inscriptions remain to be discovered?
On the site of an archaeological excavation in Suda¬
nese Nubia, I watched the workmen carrying away the
sand and singing with the voice of Africa. They could
hardly have known the significance of the objects they
were helping to uncover, yet these objects may one day
reveal knowledge of profound importance to scholars
wishing to trace the Influences which have fashioned
Africa. I suddenly recalled that a few weeks earlier, in
south-west Sudan, a thousand miles from Nubia, I had
recorded a mountain people singing with rhythms that
carried faint echoes of the Nubian song.
All over West and Central Africa strange similarities of
form have appeared In widely separated areas. The
ancient name of Kush is still preserved in the names of
Nubian-speaking peoples living today in south-west
Sudan. There are the Kagiddi, for example, who believe,
they came from the east under the leadership of a queen,
who they say is buried in a large mound grave In Jebel
Meldot. The queen was probably one of the last monarchs
of defeated Kush, in other words the Nubian Kingdom of
Meroe, which lasted nearly 1,000 years from about 600 B.C.
The Kushites were great iron workers. Their capital,
Meroe, has been called the "Birmingham of the ancient
world" and from their factories, weapons and objects of
iron spread across Africa, influencing profoundly the
neighbouring African cultures of that day. They have
left many Indecipherable inscriptions: it is possible that
in Nubia lies burled the key to the Meroitic tongue.
To this day in Benine City, Nigeria, bronze objects are
being made which recall strongly some of the bronzes
made in Meroe and Egypt to commemorate the Egyptian
god, Amon. From Ghana too. come two bronze lamps
which strongly resemble the lamps found In burial
mounds of the 5th Century A.D. In northern Sudan. These
are faint hints, but significant.
The link, Professor Säve-Söderbergh maintains, Ls to
be found in Nubia, on the banks of that 300-mile stretch
of the Nile which the High Dam will submerge.
Professor Emery described Nubia to me as the cockpit
of the ancient African world. From the north, the Egyp¬
tians, representing the highest civilization of that time,
were pushing south to exploit the gold mines and to
trade in ivory, precious woods and other products.
"The people of the south, whose culture, as wc arc
beginning to realize through recent excavations and
research", Professor Emery added, "was by no means
negligible, were pushing north to the more fertile parts of
the valley of the Nile. Consequently there was an almost
continuous state of warfare between the peoples of the
north and the south, and the results of the battles be¬
tween them, small as they were In comparison with our
modern conflicts, have greatly influenced the course of
European civilization and, through European civilization,
that of the world at the present time."
At the University in Khartum, L.P. Klrwan explained
why he considered the excavation of new sites in Sudanese
Nubia to be of the greatest importance.
"This is going to produce world history," he said. It
is going to add to the history of Africa, not only of the
Sudan but also of Africa as a whole. This Ls a subject
which is of Increasing interest to African students and
African peoples as they emerge into independence.
"The time for all this work is extremely short and every
effort will have to be made by the nations of the world
to save history from the floods, so to speak, and to preserve
the cultural heritage of this part of Africa for future
generations."
We should indeed be grateful for the building of the
High Dam for it has drawn the attention of scholars
the world over to this forgotten reach of the Nile. Of
the slow progress of man from his first faltering steps on
the tortuous path towards civilization, every foot of the
river's banks bears evidence, either above ground or below.
Here truly is an opportunity unique in the fields of pre¬
history, anthropology and archaeology. We now await
the testimony of the spade.

### 64251: Nubia's Christian age

NUBIA'S CHRISTIAN AGE
by L. P. Kirwan
Laurence Patrick Kirwan first began exploring and excavating in Nubia
In 1929, when he became Assistant Director of the Archaeological
Survey of Nubia undertaken by the Egyptian Department of
Antiquities. He later participated in numerous expeditions. Since
1945 he has been Director of the Royal Geographical Society, London.
When we think of Nubia, and the famous historic
monuments that are now in danger from the
High Dam, most of us think mainly of the great temples
of Abu Simbel and Philae, built by the Pharaohs several
thousand years ago. Certainly, these rank with the most
splendid monuments of the ancient world. But they, and
other smaller temples and buildings of similarly ancient
date, are not the only relics of early Nubian civilization in
danger of being submerged by the rising waters of the
Nile.
In style and origin, these memorials of the Pharaohs
are not Nubian at all. They are Egyptian; projections of
ancient Egyptian art and architecture into a conquered
land; a land which belongs, unlike Egypt north of the
First Cataract, to the African rather than to the Mediter¬
ranean scene.
By contrast with these Pharaonic monuments, there are
many other relics of ancient and mediaeval times, more
truly Nubian in character. Some belong to the Sudanese
kingdom of Meroe, which ruled during the Graeco-Roman
Age over most of the Sudan and most of Lower Nubia
from its capital, Meroe, a hundred miles or so north of
Khartum.
Others belong to Christian Nubia, to the era of the
Christian Nubian kingdoms. These flourished from 542 to
1323 A.D. and thus endured for seven hundred years after
the Moslem conquest of neighbouring Egypt.
This age of Christianity in Nubia was one of great
prosperity and power. Thriving cities and townships,
churches and monasteries, were thickly clustered along
both banks of the Nile. The administration of. Church
and State alike was elaborately organized, largely on
Byzantine lines. A Nubian school of painters flourished
and adorned the walls of the domed and vaulted white¬
washed Nubian churches with religious scenes in brilliant
colours.
Seldom, in the course of their long history, had the
Nubian people, in architecture, in art, in civil and mili¬
tary organization, in the independent development of a
national consciousness, achieved such a high level of
advancement as during this Christian Nubian age.
If further evidence of the strength of these Christian
kingdoms is needed, then it can be found in the obvious
respect which the Arab rulers of Moslem Egypt paid to
the Christian Nubian kings, and in the formidable barrier
which Christian Nubia presented, over the centuries, to
the southward flowing tide of Islam.
The first of the Nubian kingdoms to be converted to
Christianity, between 542 and 545 A.D., was the northern¬
most, and the most powerful, kingdom of Nobadia. It
extended from the First Cataract, the southern frontier
of Egypt in mediaeval times, as far south as Akasha,
beyond the Second Cataract. It thus covered the three
hundred miles or so of Nubia which will be flooded by
the High Dam.
The Nobades, as the people of Nobadia were called,
ST PETER (below) replaces Egyptian gods to which
Rameses II (still depicted on right of niche) is offering
flowers in the temple of Wadi es Sebua. Nubia was
christianized in the 5th and 6th centuries and the temples
were often converted into churches. Much of the former
decoration was left alongside the Christian imagery.

EARLY CHURCH which was built inside a Middle
Kingdom fortress at Serra East in the Sudan. The archi¬

the Gospel in Nubia. The Christian kingdoms of Nubia
held out some 700 years after Egypt's conversion to Islam.

### 64251: Nubia's Christian age

CHRISTIAN NUBIA Is
being thoroughly excavated.
Coptic churches, monaste¬
ries and fortified towns will
undoubtedly contribute to
our knowledge of the me¬
diaeval Christian world. Fa-
ras, left, was once the capital
of the Christian kingdom of
Nobadia. (See page 38.) In
the background, are ruins of
a Dervish fort and a church.
Unesco-Keating
were a warlike people; armed tribesmen riding horses and
camels who had often in the past been a menace to the
Egyptian frontier garrisons. In the years immediately
preceding their conversion to Christianity, however, the
Nobades appear to have been on reasonably good terms
with their Christian neighbours in Byzantine Egypt.
They traded with Egypt, and their tombs in Lower
Nubia contained many remarkable treasures of sliver,
bronze and gold from the Workshops of Alexandria and
the Hellenistic world. Perhaps because of this, they were
sufficiently well-disposed to accept peacefully the closing
of the pagan temples at Philae on the Egyptian frontier
in 535 A.D., though the shrine of Isis there had been the
Mecca of Nubian pilgrims for generations.
When the first Christian missionary, Julian,
arrived in Nubia from Turkey a few years
later, bearing letters from the Imperial Court at Byzan¬
tium, he and his companion, Theodore, the aged bishop
of Philae, were received not with hostility but with con¬
siderable ceremony by the Nubians and their king.
The task confronting Julian, as we know both from
archaeological discoveries and from a contemporary
account of his adventures, was far from easy. The cli¬
mate, torrid and rainless, he found exceptionally trying
after the cooler airs of Istambul.
Then there were the Nubian people themselves. Like
their predecessors in the days of the kingdom of Meroe,
they were still fervent worshippers of Isis and other
Egyptian deities. Even at this late date, moreover, when
their neighbours in Egypt and Ethiopia had been Chris¬
tian for two centuries, the Nobades continued to indulge
not only in animal but in human sacrifice, in the primi¬
tive belief that horses and camels, slaves, courtiers and
wives alike must die when the king died, so that they
might continue to serve their master in the After World.
However, despite the rigours of the country and the cli¬
mate and such deeply rooted pagan practices, Julian, his
successor, the missionary, Longlnus, and other missionaries
whose names we do not know, spread the Gospel, through¬
out Nobadia, and even beyond, across the desert, and
as far as the distant kingdom of Alodia, the Arabic Aloa,
whose capital, Soba, lay near the junction of the Blue and
the White Nile.
The first visible result of their preaching, as archaeology
shows, was the conversion into churches of the pagan
temples of Lower Nubia; the small temple of Rameses II
at Wadi es Sebua, for example, and the temple at Dendur,
built by the Roman Emperor Augustus, which was rededi-
cated as a church in 559 A.D. Then, or soon after, came
the building of the first churches in Nubia, at Faras, near
the present Sudanese-Egyptian border, and at Kasr Ibrim,
both influential centres in earlier times.
Radiating from such ancient centres, destined to be
included among the sites of the six or seven Episcopal sees
of Nubia, Christianity spread to the countryside and by
the early years of the seventh century Nubia, outwardly
at least, was a Christian land.
Greek was probably the language of conversion and of
the liturgy and prayers of the early Church and this, like
the distinct traces of Byzantine influence in religious
painting and architecture, reflects the predominantly
Byzantine rather than Coptic (or Egyptian) character of
Nubian Christianity In Its earliest phase. Probably after
the middle of the seventh century, however, as the result
perhaps of a great influx of ChrLstlan refugees from
Egypt, Nubia swung over to Coptic Church doctrines.
The student of Christian Nubia has some rich sources
of information to rely upon: literary, and archaeological
too, in the churches, monasteries, palaces and walled cities
whose Impressive ruins can be seen today all along the
banks of the Nubian Nile. Many of these were explored
by the eminent Italian scholar, the late Professor Ugo
Monneret de Villard. Ills pioneer work before the last
War laid the foundations of the history and archaeology
of Christian Nubia.
His explorations, illuminating as they were, were of
necessity often superficial, being carried out with few
resources and in haste, in anticipation of the last raising
of the present Aswan Dam.
Now, under the infinitely greater and Imminent threat
of flooding from the High Dam, more than superficial
exploration is needed if we are to solve the remaining
mysteries of Christian Nubia. At least one of the princi¬
pal centres of occupation should be fully excavated: a
centre such as Faras, the early capital of the Christian
kingdom of Nobadia, where I myself made some trial
explorations early last year. The need to date chrono¬
logically the very remarkable painted pottery of Christ¬
ian Nubia would alone make this worth while.
R;tuned churches must be surveyed, planned and
.studied architecturally. The delicate remains
of frescoes, like those which adorn so brillantly the walls
of the little church of Abd el Kadir near the Second
Cataract, must be removed and preserved.
Tombs, some of them pillared, and cupola tombs like
those at Kasr Ibrim, must be explored and their skeletal
remains studied so that we may learn something of the
racial origins and characteristics of the Christian Nubians.
Tombstones too must be rescued from the flood for these
often contain prayers for the dead of great Interest to the
student of the liturgy of the early Church.
Since archaeology is almost Impossible during the
Nubian summer, little time remains in which all this must
be done. That it should be done, that it should not be
overlooked at a time when the flood-lights play prin¬
cipally on the world-famous monuments of Ancient Egyp¬
tian Nubia, is urgent. Then, a new chapter will be added 39
to the history of Christianity in Africa and a new page
to the history of the mediaeval Christian world.

### 64243: Nubia today; a vast archaeological camp

TWO MAGNIFICENT MURALS, their colours
as fresh as when they were painted, have been
discovered at Faras West by Professor Michalowski
heading an expedition from the Polish Centre,
Cairo. One picturing St. Michael (left) is now
at the Wadi Haifa Museum. The Polish expedition
also unearthed two Christian chapels in this area
dating from the fifth century. Below, recently
excavated Christian pottery kilns at Faras North.

On the other hand, some finds have filled important
gaps in history generally or the history of art.
While excavating cemeteries of various periods at
Aniba, Professor Abdel Moneim Abu-Bakr of Cairo Uni¬
versity made some interesting discoveries concerning
methods of burial and the occurrence of epidemics which
ravaged Nubian villages. The most diverse objects were
retrieved from tombs. Unsophisticated in style and cru¬
dely finished, they tell us much about the beliefs and
artistic talents of the people who made and used' them.
The discovery of the tomb of Heka Nefer, Prince of
Miam, at Toshka East, was a disappointment. It proved
to be in a very bad state of preservation. It did at least
yield some details concerning a high-ranking contem¬
porary of Tutankhamon whose name was known to us
solely by a rock inscription, also at Toshka, and a picture
on Huy's Tomb at Thebes. Now we know that Prince
Heka Nefer was buried in Nubia as was Pennut two
centuries later, under the 20th dynasty. The leader of
the Yale and Pennsylvania Universities mission, Mr.
William Kelly Simpson, was unable to find the Prince's
remains at the bottom of the tomb well, but he did
unearth five of the funerary statuettes. The two finest
are of stone and bear classical inscriptions. (See p. 24.)
The lengthy list of allotments (see p. 25) gives some idea
of the importance archaeologists attach to excavating in
Nubia. Egyptologists all over the world interrupted lec¬
ture series and personal research and even sacrificed
vacation time to respond to the Unesco appeal. The
main attraction, was the possibility of filling in some of
the gaps in our knowledge of a region which has harboured
so many different civilizations.
Very often new cities were built on top of or beside old
ones. After Debod and Taffeh Temples were removed,
for instance, excavations were begun under their found¬
ations. Cemeteries and fortresses are also being excav-
40 ated with the hope of bringing to light older buildings.
As a result of international co-operation the history of
Nubia's various civilizations may at last be elucidated.
No extraordinary finds were expected at least in
Egyptian Nubia. The excavations carried out from 1907-
1912 and from 1929-1934 undoubtedly yielded the most
important in Egyptian Nubia. Similarly, at Buhen fort¬
ress in the Sudan, Professor Walter B. Emery had already
been excavating over a number of years. Furthermore,
Nubia was never the centre of an original civilization,
except when the rulers of Ballana-Qustul controlled the
route between Upper and Lower Nubia. Yet already
within a few weeks the efforts of scientific expeditions
produced archaeologically interesting results.
Some results have been negative in the sense that so
little was discovered e.g. Khor Dehmit-Kalabsha, Wadi
es Sebua, Amada, the east bank of Abu Simbel but it
was at least proved that the previous excavations had
been thorough.
Fragments of a long inscription were also found at
Akasha, in the Sudan, by the Franco-Argentine mission.
Professor Rosenwasser believes that it is a copy of the
famous decree of Ptah engraved on the wall between two
pillars in the Osirian hypostyle hall of the Great Temple
of Abu Simbel.
The main finds made by Professor Leclant, leader of the
Strasbourg University mission at Tomas, concern the
Meroitic culture (6th century B.C.), of which much evi¬
dence had already been brought to light, especially at
Ballana-Qustu, and even in the Sudan. Professor
Leclant's finds include a big stele with a 24-line inscrip¬
tion and a sacrificial table inscribed on its whole circum¬
ference. These texts are still being studied, but it is as yet
impossible to judge their importance.
At Faras, Professor Michalowski, head of the Polish
Centre in Cairo, found two Christian chapels. Of the
four steles he discovered, two indicate that Sudanese
Nubia was being Christianized at the end of the 5th cent.
The oldest commemorates the first bishop of Faras or
one of the first. It is dated 606.
Archaeologists are understandably reassured with every
season. Their enthusiastic response to the Director-
General's Appeal was not inspired by a desire to rewrite
the history of Nubia, already known in outline. Their
sole aim was to salvage the remaining documentary
material and to elucidate certain obscurities by con¬
ducting thorough excavations before a field so rich in
vestiges of successive civilizations was forever engulfed.
In this they will soon have succeeded.

Letters to the Editor
Sir,
What a joy to receive your June
issue, at long last devoted to Latin
America. What a disappointment to
note once again the total lack of
knowledge concerning my country.
Argentina, which according to the
literacy statistics published on page 33
is in front place ahead of all of its
sister nations of America, is referred
to only four or five times in the
whole issue and then only in a
passing manner. San Martin gets a
mere "postage stamp" photo, and
you overlook completely his interview
with Bolivar at Guayaquil. Buenos
Aires, the largest capital city south
of the Rio Grande and one of the
most populous cities of the world,
is portrayed by its underground
"tube" with the worst, out-of-date
photo when there are so many other
stations artistically decorated with
painted tiles which are our pride and
admiration. Buenos Aires, modern
buildings, its theatres (among these
the General San Martin Theatre just
completed, probably the largest and
technically most modern of all South
America), its throbbing cultural life
all these do not exist for your
magazine. The Colon Theatre, on
a par with the Paris Opera and the
Metropolitan of New York, our
enormous agricultural and cattle
potential, the growth of our indus¬
tries, particularly automobiles, our
iron and steel industry, in a word, our
fantastic economic development has
been omitted, I hope, for a future
issue. Congratulations to your
photographer Almasy. But it is a
pity that no one showed him some
of the things which we here consider
essential to know.
Julio Cesar Saenz
Hurlingham
Buenos Aires Argentina
Sir
Congratulations for your issues in
general and the Latin-American
number in particular. But why
devote several pages to General
Simón Bolívar and say so little about
General José de San Martín.
The eternal glory of the great
"Captain of the Andes" is not, of
course, affected in the least by this
"mistake" of The Unesco Courier.
But your magazine has a world-wide
circulation and in countries where
the history of Latin-America is little
known or unknown, the impression
will be conveyed that the Venezuelan
hero is the main historical figure
of the continent, or "the liberator of
Latin-America" as you call him.
And this is false.
The greatest figures of the Ame¬
rican continent were San Martin in
Latin America and George Washing¬
ton north of the Rio Grande. Both
reached the pinnacle of power and
withdrew with their moral greatness
and prestige intact. The same can¬
not be said of Bolivar, whose military
genius covered him with glory, but
whose at times turbulent life saw
triumph mixed with tragedy and
defeat.
Let it be clearly understood that
I am not denying the greatness of
Bolivar, but I do deny that he is the
greatest and best known historical
figure of Latin America; this honour
must go to the Liberator of Argen¬
tina, Chile and Perú, for whom the
Cordillera of the Andes was no
obstacle and who is appropriately
called "The Saint with the Sword".
Roberto Lavagna S.
Morón, Province of Buenos Aires
Argentina
Sir
Your issue on Latin America
contains gross errors, either in¬
voluntary or deliberate, though I
am inclined to believe the latter more
likely because of the authors you
have chosen. This is a delicate
matter, since The Courier circulates
all over America and Europe; in the
former it will arouse justifiable anger;
in the latter it will add to the
confusion that generally exists with
regard to Latin America.
In your map of Latin America the
Falkland Islands are omitted. These
belong to Argentina and the South
American continent, to which they
are linked by a submarine platform.
The antarctic areas of Chile and
Argentina, which are part and parcel
of both countries, are also omitted.
In this same page Andrés Bello is
described as "the man who was to or¬
ganize the juridical systems of the
Republics which had won their
independence from Spain". Nothing
could be less exact, at least as far
as Argentina is concerned. Our
Constitution, drawn up in 1853, was
inspired by the U.S. Constitution, and
our Civil Code was based on the
work of the Brazilian jurist Frcitas
and the Napoleonic Code.
O'Higgins is described as Chile's
liberator. Wasn't it really San Martin?
You state that San Martin was
forced to seek asylum in Europe
when he fled the anarchy in Argen¬
tina. Nothing could be farther from
the truth. You devote three pages
to Bolivar, and write, "there is no
more famous name than his in the
history of Latin America". I think
this is biased and misleading. Much
as we may acknowledge Bolivar's
merit, it is to San Martin's initiative
and courage that Argentina, Chile
and Perú owe their freedom (not only
the first two countries, as you state)
and his renunciation in Guayaquil is
what permitted Bolivar to crown
South America's liberation.
You publish only a poor photo¬
graph of Plaza Mayo in Buenos Aires
but many large photographs of other
countries. In an issue on Latin
America, you should have considered
the continent as a whole, and not
referred almost exclusively to three
or four countries which are not the
most important. The only really
impartial article in the issue is the
one by Dr Alfred Métraux, perhaps
because he is foreign to South
America, and to a lesser degree those
of Oscar Vera and Tibor Mende..
I feel that Argentina, all Latin
America and historical truth deserve
a rectification and clarification from
you not only to satisfy our national
pride, but because of the repercussion
that your errors and incomplete
information may have, and if you
are not to lose the confidence of
your regular readers in the material
you publish in future issues.
Jorge Miguel Aguilar
Mufilz, Province of Buenos Aires
Argentina
Sir,
As a Latin American, I am grateful
that an international publication such
as The Unesco Courier has sought
to let people from distant corners of
the earth know about the aspirations
and ambitions of a continent in
process of constant renovation.
Latin America expects, not charitable
help from stronger nations, but under¬
standing and recognition of her ideals
by all peoples.
Speaking as an Argentinian,
however, I have several reservations
to make about the lack of know¬
ledge of my country displayed in
the articles of your Latin American
issue. Surely Buenos Aires itself and
Argentina in general present aspects
far more important than the photo¬
graph of the entrance to an under¬
ground station, even if that under¬
ground be unique in the continent.
People of other nations can hardly
have any idea of what my country
is like from the articles in your June
issue.
Gonzalo Fernandez
Buenos Aires
Argentina
Sir,
I have just received issue n° 7-8 of
The Unesco Courier.
1 think this issue deserves a special
mention. I found it excellent as re¬
gards both substance and appearance.
May I take this opportunity of ask¬
ing you to convey the congratulations
of the National Commission to all
those who contributed to the produc¬
tion of this issue.

From the Unesco Ne
UNESCO PAYS TRIBUTE TO DAG HAMMARSK JOELD
Tribute was paid
to Hie memory
of Dag Ham-
marskjoeld. Sec¬
retary - General
of the United
Nations, in a
short and mov¬
ing ceremony
held in Unesco
House in Paris
o n September
19. It was
opened by Mr.
Akale -Work
Apte Wold, Am¬
bassador of Ethiopia to France and
President of the Eleventh Unesco Gen¬
eral Conference. Then Dr. Mohamed
Awad, of the United Arab Republic,
chairman of the Unesco Executive
Board, took the floor to express "a
feeling of consternation and grief for
the loss of one who literally belonged
to the whole world."
Dr. Awad singled out some of Mr.
Hammarskjoeld's achievements: "At
the time of his appointment, the Unit¬
ed Nations Organization was facing a
difficult situation in Korea, and he was
able to emerge with enhanced reputa¬
tion from that experience. A few
years later, the question of Suez was
one of deep concern to all the world.
To that period belong two very great
achievements: the opening of the Suez
Canal in record time and far ahead
of schedule and the creation of the first
international force which helped pre¬
serve peace in a very troubled region."
Mr. Hammarskjoeld, said Dr. Awad,
"was able to bring about a conciliation
within the greater part of the Congo,
and was well on the way to complete
the task entrusted to him when he fell,
in the field of duty, a courageous and
indefatigable warrior whose achieve¬
ments qualify him for a secure place
among the immortal servants of man¬
kind."
Dr. Awad was followed by Mr. Rene
Maheu, Acting Director-General of
Unesco, who paid a warm personal
homage to Mr. Hammarskjoeld, with
whom he had often worked closely:
"... far higher and more lasting than
the flame which charred those horrible
debris on Sunday night in the African
bush", said Mr. Maheu, "the flame
of that inextinguishable hope which
drove him and consumed him will
continue to shed light for us in our
night and in our jungle.
"We shall no longer hear his voice,
a soft 'voice restrained by a reserve
which threw a veil of delicacy and
kindness over the sharp-edged expres¬
sion, not devoid of irony, of one of
the clearest minds and most incisive
wills ever to exist. But, until the end
of our days and our tasks, we shall
hear the call which he tirelessly echo¬
ed even in that desert where he was
lost forever: the call of freedom, of
human dignity and of concord."
"History will record the décisive
contribution made by Mr. Hammarsk¬
joeld to the building of the United
Nations and its efforts for peace and
economic and social progress," said
Mr. Maheu. "It was he," added Mr.
Maheu, "who said one day... 'The man
does not count, the institution does'.
No man in our time has left a more
lasting mark upon the Organization to
which he consecrated himself with his
exceptional talents."
Well over 1,000 people attended the
ceremony, including members of the
United Nations Information Centre in
Paris, members of Unesco's Executive
Board, permanent delegates to Unesco,
representatives of the Diplomatic
Corps in Paris and members of the
Unesco Secretariat,
M UNESCO SALUTES PROBE INTO
SPACE: The following message was sent
by Mr. Alvin Roseman, Acting Director-
General of Unesco, to the Chairman of
the Soviet National Commission for
Unesco in Moscow on the occasion of
the Soviet Union's second successful
manned cosmic flight:
"The latest outer space achievement
of the Soviet Union has deeply impress¬
ed Unesco. / beg you to convey to
tlie Soviet National Commission our
warmest congratulations for this further
magnificent contribution of Soviet scien¬
tists and engineers."
T,EMPORARY IMPORTATION:
The Customs Co-operation Council in
Brussels recently adopted two international
conventions designed to ease the temporary
admission of professional and exhibition
equipment. These conventions are open
for signature until March 31, 1962. The
first covers materials needed by repre-
42 sentatives of the press, radio, cinema and
television visiting a country for purposes
of reportage, broadcasting or film pro
duction and instruments required by
experts, scholars, physicians, artists,
theatre groups, orchestras, etc. The second
convention covers material for display or
use at exhibitions, fairs, conferences, inter¬
national meetings such as films, sound
recordings, interpretation equipment, film
projectors. In collaboration with the
GATT, Unesco and the International
Chamber of Commerce, the Customs Co¬
operation Council is preparing an ad¬
ditional convention establishing a carnet
which would replace national documents
when the conventions on temporary
importation are being applied.
TEACHING GHANA'S GRAND¬
MOTHERS: If you educate a woman,
you educate a family, says the old
adage, and this is particularly true in
rapidly developing countries where very
often it is in the family, and particu¬
larly among the older women, that
new ideas must take root if they are to
be effective. This is why Ghana has
introduced a large-scale programme of
adult education for women, with classes
designed to make a special appeal to
older women. Results are already being
felt in home and family circles. By
persuading the grandmothers and older
women to accept basic new ideas the
teacher is helped to implant these ideas
more firmly in the minds of the young.
O NE NEWSPAPER TO 100
PEOPLE: Nearly 70% of the world's
people lack the barest information faci¬
lities. That is the state of the press in
some of the less developed countries of
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Unesco
has suggested that all countries should
aim at providing for every 100 persons
at least ten copies of daily newspapers;
five radio receivers; two cinema seats and
two television receivers. Poverty of the
mass media, Unesco points out, hinders
the spread of education and, hence, eco¬
nomic and social progress. A 45-page
report, Mass Media in the Developing
Countries, just published by Unesco,
surveys the problem and suggests action
which could be taken by governments,
international organizations and private
agencies.

LIFTING A MOUNTAIN 200 FEET
The two temples of Abu Simbel, carved out of solid
rock over 3000 years ago by Rameses II, are the most
impressive monuments of Nubia in the area to be flooded
by the new high dam at Sadd el Aali. To save them,
one of the most daring engineering feats of our century
will lift two mountains of rock 200 feetthe height of the
clock-face of London's "Big Ben". Here, in an artist's
conception, the smaller temple of Queen Nefertari (below)
and the Great Temple of Rameses (front cover) are seen
as they will appear during the ifting process, encased
in their concrete boxes (cut away to show the façades).
The Great Temple is probably the largest man-made rock-
hewn structure in the world and weighs in all 300,000 tons.
Front and back covers are not intended to be viewed
as a unit. Queen Nefertari's temple is on the right of
the Great Temple and separated by a sandy gully.
