When a group of thinkers and leading figures in
cultural life meet to discuss questions relating to the
future of humanity, the event is likely to be
noteworthy and its results interesting. If most of
them happen to be distinguished members of the
world scientific community, the discussions should
be particularly fruitful, since the destiny of
mankind is largely determined by modern science
and its offspring, technology. Such a gathering was
held earlier this year in Paris, when a Conference of
Nobel laureates met at the Elysée Palace between 1 8
and 21 January, on the invitation of Mr. François
Mitterrand, President of the French Republic, the
American writer Mr. Elie Wiesel (Nobel Peace
Prize, 1986) and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for
Humanity.''1" The title of the Conference was
"Facing the 21st century: threats and promises".
With the kind permission of the hosts, the
Unesco Courier presents in this issue contributions
from eight of the seventy-four Nobel Prize winners
who took part in the Elysée meeting. The texts,
which have been lightly edited, are a foretaste of a
forthcoming book in which all the papers and
reports presented to the Conference will be
published.
Readers will note that most of the Nobel
laureates whose contributions appear on the
following pages are from Western countries. In this
instance, the Unesco Courier's obligation to give a
hearing to writers from as many parts of the world
as possible has been inevitably qualified by the fact
that the overwhelming majority of Nobel Prize
winners are from the West.
To introduce the issue we publish a short text by
the Director-General of Unesco, Mr. Federico
Mayor Zaragoza, who writes both as the head of
Unesco and in his personal capacity as a scientist
particularly concerned by the proceedings of the
Elysée Conference.

### 79183: A New ethical outlook
A new ethicaloutlook
by Federico Mayor Zaragoza
Director-General of Unesco
/ £*\ CIENCE without conscience
* ^^ spells the ruin of the soul". Much
K-J water has flowed under the
bridges of history and science since François
Rabelais wrote those premonitory words in
the.early sixteenth century. The author of
Pantagruel can scarcely have imagined the
extremes to which the moral contradiction
that he so shrewdly pinpointed has been
taken in our own century. In Rabelais' time,
the dawn had hardly broken on what was to
become in the ensuing centuries the dazzling
sun of modern experimental science. And
nobody except perhaps Leonardo da Vin¬
ci, with his prophetic vision could then
have suspected the extent to which the world
would be conquered by science and technol¬
ogy and the promise of a radiant future
which they hold out, still less the dangers
that might loom for mankind as the result of
so exhilarating an enterprise.
The result is plain for us to see. Never
before, until now, has the tension between
science and the human conscience, between
technology and ethics, reached a point where
it has become a threat to the world as a
whole. Molecular genetics and nuclear ener¬
gy, to cite only two outstanding examples,
can, depending on how they are used, gener¬
ate great benefits or wreak great havoc. It all
depends on the use to which scientific know¬
ledge is put and on whether it is applied
correctly or incorrectly. For instance, so-
called "industrial civilization", which has in
so many respects been beneficial to man¬
kind, can, when economic criteria alone pre¬
vail, adversely affect that precious entity
known as the environment, which people
were scarcely conscious of only a few de¬
cades ago.
This is the other side the one we are
reluctant to contemplate of the gleaming
coin of progress. We are so dazzled that we
do not perceive the threats hanging over our
heads, warning us of the pressing need for a
radically new and universal ethical outlook
on the future of present-day science. We
have to bear in mind the negative aspects, the
dark underside of science which appears
when its applications are at variance with
profound and far-reaching cultural re¬
quirements, when basic human needs in
keeping with the principles of equity are
disregarded, or when science is not regulated
as it should be by the interests of society.
Although science and technology can contri¬
bute to wisdom, it would be very dangerous
if they were to try to supplant it. Bertrand
Russell made that point perfectly clear when
he wrote that thanks to science and tech¬
nology, mankind is united in evil but not yet
united for good; that people have learnt the
technique of mutual destruction, but not the
more desirable technique of worldwide co¬
operation. Russell believed that wisdom be¬
comes increasingly necessary with every
advance in knowledge and technology, and
that although our age has surpassed all others
in knowledge, it has not enjoyed a correla¬
tive increase in wisdom; and he called for a
"new moral outlook".
Without such a new moral outlook, the
wholesale slaughter that threatens us could
become inevitable. Whence the need for a
scientific revolution which can take place
when knowledge acts as a counterweight to
power instead of being subordinated to it.
Today, knowledge is increasingly becoming
a prop for power, and science is unduly
subservient to force whereas it should
work exclusively in the service of reason.
The revolution lies in making wise use of
knowledge. Thus it is necessary to establish a
scientific order which will produce the
wherewithal, in the form of nutrition,
health, culture, for the survival in dignity of
all mankind. Such a new scientific order will
undoubtedly entail making far-reaching
changes in the course taken by technology,
and steering the applications of science in a
new direction, far removed from the nuclear
landscape and the rampant consumption of
the present day.
Ensuring that science goes hand in hand
with conscience, and technology with ethics,
is our responsibility if we are not to see that
"ruin of the soul", which would now be
tantamount to the annihilation of humanity.
We all bear that responsibility, since we are
all in the same boat. But a special responsibil¬
ity is borne by intellectuals and by the think¬
ers and scientists on whose work the flower¬
ing of theoretical and practical knowledge
depends. By virtue of the very nature of their
work, scientists and intellectuals should be
open to what is universal this is the very
essence of science capable of reflecting on
the grave problems of the modern world
with the necessary knowledge and breadth
of vision and in a spirit of equity, without
being influenced by political expediency or
cultural particularities, however legitimate.
They are sentinels, capable of thinking
ahead, of predicting what will happen and of
sounding the alarm.
It is not easy to determine how scientists
can exert their influence to change the direc¬
tion in which powerful interests steer and
indeed manipulate their work and the re¬
wards derived from it. However, it is their
responsibility to speak out about the dangers
stemming from the wrongful use of scientific
knowledge, a misuse which fails to measure
its social, economic and cultural conse¬
quences in other words, its human impact.
Indeed, it is their responsibility to highlight
those dangers.
Ever since it was founded, Unesco has
endeavoured to be a sounding-board for
serene and rigorous thinking by the world
scientific and intellectual community and an
instrument of peace and development. It is
therefore bound to give a warm welcome to
any venture that will contribute to a better
knowledge of the benefits and risks, the
positive aspects as well as the dangers, to
which mankind as a whole is likely to be
exposed as a result of technological and in¬
dustrial growth. This is why Unesco took
such a keen interest in the deliberations and
conclusions of the Conference of Nobel
Prize winners held at the Elysée Palace in
Paris from 18 to 21 January 1988, at the
invitation of Mr. François Mitterrand, Presi¬
dent of the French Republic, and Mr. Elie
Wiesel, the writer, who was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. Seventy-four
leading scientists, intellectuals and political
figures who had been recipients of the presti¬
gious Nobel Prize, discussed the threats and
promises facing mankind as it approaches
the threshold of the new millennium. This
issue of the Unesco Courier is devoted to the
ideas and analyses they put forward, and
presents the declarations made by eight of
the participants. Its publication is a con¬
tribution to Unesco's task of paving the way
for that new ethical outlook without which
peace and genuine human progress are not
possible, and never will be.

### 79185: Science, technology and human welfare
Science, technology
andhuman welfare
Rosalyn S. Yalow
IN a list of discussion topics for this
Conference, it is stated that "Ours is a
century dominated by science and
technology". None of us could disagree
with this statement. Nevertheless we should
also agree that the achievements of science
should not be denigrated by an overempha¬
sis on new problems which these achieve¬
ments may, in some cases, have introduced.
Unfortunately, the problems that persist are
those resulting from the unwise use of the
gifts of science and technology by govern¬
ments and those in positions of authority
and power.
Apart from the threat of war, the risks to
our collective health and wellbeing have
fallen strikingly during the twentieth centu¬
ry. The First World War claimed almost 9
million lives and the Second World War
more than 50 million. The fact that there has
been no war between the major powers
since 1945 may well be attributed to the
existence of nuclear weapons. We continue
to be reminded about the 110,000 who died
in the Second World War as a result of the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, but we
do not hear about the comparable number
who died in the attack on Okinawa, or the
80,000 who died and the million who were
made homeless in one night by the fire-
bombing of Tokyo, or the comparable loss¬
es during the destruction of Dresden.
In spite of the heavy radiation doses suf¬
fered by the survivors of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombings, it is not generally real¬
ized that the increase in cancer mortality up
to 1 982 was less than 7 per cent of the cancer
mortality expected had there been no irradi¬
ation. High technology was not required to
build the gas chambers that destroyed mil¬
lions of Jews. However scientific insights
and technology did make possible the rapid
development of radar which helped the
United Kingdom to survive the Battle of
Britain and was a crucial factor in the Allied
victory in the Second World War.
What of the role played by science and
technology in our daily lives? At the begin¬
ning of this century life expectancy in the
developed Western countries was about
forty-five years; today our lifespan exceeds
the biblical prescription of three score years
and ten. We are constantly being frightened
by the so-called cancer epidemic, supposed¬
ly due to environmental pollution. What are
the facts? Statistics from the United States,
which are probably similar to those from
Western Europe, show that of the 440,000
persons who died of cancer in 1983, 380,000
or almost 90 per cent were about fifty-five
years of age. At the turn of the century,

when most people did not live until the age
of fifty-five, cancer was obviously less com¬
mon. If we examine the age-adjusted cancer
death rates since 1930 in the United States,
we find that the incidence of cancer of the
stomach has fallen more than fivefold, can-

### 79185: Science, technology and human welfare
Widespreadpublic concern about the safety of
nuclear energy was aroused by the 1979 acci¬
dent at a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island,
Pennsylvania (USA), and increased by the
Chernobyl (USSR) reactor accident in April
1986 (left). The proponents of nuclear energy
seek toput such events in perspective bypoint¬
ing to other, less publicized types ofpollution
that may be more dangerous.
Industrial society has polluted the oceans as
well as vast areas of the planet's land surface.

Health and Medical Research), Paris.
cer of the liver threefold, and cancer of the
uterus fourfold. Unfortunately there is a
cancer epidemic but the cause is smoking.
The incidence of lung cancer in both men
and women has risen more than tenfold in
the United States over the past fifty years
and now accounts for almost one-third of all
cancer deaths.
That environmental factors, presumably
related to diet, are important in cancer is
indicated by the fact that although deaths
due to stomach cancer have fallen strikingly
in the United States, a similar fall has not
occurred in Japan. On the other hand,
breast cancer is four times less common in
Japan than in the United States. However,
the cancer death rates among second-gener¬
ation Japanese immigrants to the United
States approach those of the population
among which they live, showing a striking
decrease in stomach cancer and equally
striking increases in breast and colon cancer.
According to a study on the causes of cancer
and estimated avoidable risks in the United
States, about one-third of cancers are due to
tobacco, more than one-third to diet, less
than 10 per cent to reproductive and sexual
behaviour, and only 2 per cent to pollution
and less than 1 per cent each to food addi¬
tives and industrial products. In view of
these figures, the idea of a cancer epidemic
attributable to the changes in our envi¬
ronment as a consequence of science and
technology is a myth.
Let us consider the fear of "toxigenic
bacteria". Although it is possible to alter
bacteria by genetic engineering, is there rea¬
son to believe that these altered bacteria
would be more toxic than the multiplicity of
bacteria that Nature has providedpartic¬
ularly in view of the ability of bacteria to
mutate continuously so as to produce new
antibiotic-resistant strains? Recently our
greatest concern has not been bacterial dis¬
ease but rather those diseases caused by
infection with retroviruses.
The world is now confronted with a ma¬
jor health problem, Acquired Immunodef
iciency Syndrome (AIDS), that affects peo¬
ple in the most productive portion of their
lives and increasingly is being transmitted to
children by infected mothers. In the present
state of knowledge, medicine can offer nei¬
ther a vaccine nor a curative therapy. There
are no really firm estimates of the total
number of people already infected with the
virus, nor of the fraction of those infected
who will go on to develop the lethal disease
itself.
The problems associated with AIDS
appear to differ in Western countries and in
Africa. In the Western nations AIDS is
transmitted primarily by homosexuals and
drug addicts, and an educational campaign
appears to be slowing the rate of transmis¬
sion among the homosexual population.
However, in Africa, where it is now esti¬
mated that 5 million people may be infected,
the spread of AIDS is associated with hete¬
rosexual practices and infection through
commonly used syringes for blood trans¬
fusions. We have barely begun to appreciate
the social and economic costs of this terrible
disease whose rapid spread has been a con¬
sequence of major changes in lifestyle. This
complex new disease is not a by-product of
science and technology. Let us hope that
science will find a way to prevent the spread
of this modern plague.
Concern about the possibility of nuclear
accidents has had a major impact on deci¬
sions to open new nuclear power plants in
the United States. It is of particular interest
that in our host country, France, nuclear
power accounts for 70 per cent of electricity
generated. Equivalent figures are 67 per cent
for Belgium, 39 per cent for Sweden, 30 per
cent for the Federal Republic of Germany,
25 per cent for Japan and only 17 per cent
for the United States.
Over the past forty years a sixfold in¬
crease in the Gross National Product of the
United States has been associated with a
sixfold increase in electricity consumption.
The use of nuclear power in place of oil for
the generation of electricity has resulted in
the reduction of oil consumption by utilities
to one-third of the 1 973 level, in spite of a 30
per cent increase in demand for electricity.
There is general agreement that until the
next century the increased demand for elec¬
tricity must be satisfied by coal or nuclear
power.
There was widespread public concern
about the accident in 1979 at the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, al¬
though it resulted in no morbidity or mor¬
tality. Fear of radiation was further acceler¬
ated as a consequence of the Chernobyl
reactor accident in April 1986, in which
there were thirty-one immediate deaths.
To put this number in perspective let us
not forget the 4,000 who died in London in
December 1952 as a result of dense air
pollution associated with the burning of
fossil fuels, or the 350 dead, 500 injured and

In the United States smoking causes one-third
of the cases of cancer. Right, a lifelong addic¬
tion to tobacco often begins as a gesture of
adulthood.
"There is general agreement that until the next
century, increased demandfor electricity must

thousands made homeless by a Mexico City
gas-storage tank explosion in 1984. The use
of coal for electricity production results in
an average of 300 accident-related deaths
each year in the United States, as well as the
associated problems of acid rain and the
"greenhouse effect", i.e. the gradual warm¬
ing of the Earth due to the burning of fossil
fuels.
What are the likely delayed radiation ef¬
fects attributable to Chernobyl? One
hundred thousand people were evacuated
and had cumulative radiation exposures of
about 5 remcomparable to the difference
in background radiation associated with liv¬
ing in Switzerland for fifty years rather than
in Paris, London or Rome.
The most highly exposed group included
about 25,000 people living between 3 and 15
kilometres from the reactor, who received
an average dose of about 50 rem. These
doses were comparable to the acute doses
received at Hiroshima and Nagasaki but
they were delivered at much lower dose
rates.
Studies of radiation leukemogenesis in
these 25,000 people during the next decade
should provide answers concerning dose-
rate effects in man. It has long been known
from animal studies that X-ray and gamma-
ray radiation is far less carcinogenic when
delivered at a lower dose rate.
In spite of the concerns of the general
public, the scientific community uniformly
agrees that for the foreseeable future the
nuclear fuel cycle remains the safest way to
generate the electricity required to maintain
our standard of living.
Science and technology have been har¬
nessed to improve the well-being of people
in the developing as well as in the developed
countries. Unfortunately there remain po¬
litical and social problems which are not
amenable to the laws and rationality of
science.

### 79185: Science, technology and human welfare
The new convergence
ofscience and culture
llya Prigogine
SCIENCE is a cultural phenomenon.
In his remarkable writings on Chi¬
nese science and technology, the
British biochemist and historian of science
Joseph Needham asks why modern science
did not emerge from China.1 China was, in
fact, particularly well placed to become the
cradle of modern science and technology.
From China came such key inventions as
the compass, gunpowder and printing, to
name but a few, and Chinese algebra and
astronomy had made several promising
advances.
Many reasons have been put forward in
reply to Needham's question. Among those
most frequently proposed are the highly
bureaucratic organization of Chinese socie¬
ty and the absence of a sovereign, law-giving
God, a concept deeply entrenched in Eu¬
ropean thought at the end of the Middle
Ages. Whatever specific answer may be giv¬
en, it is clear that the problem raised is one
of culture in all its complexity. It is my firm
conviction that the notion of a god who is
the guarantor of the laws of nature and their
rationality played an essential role at the
time of the first stirrings of European
science.
What today we call classical science was
born in a culture dominated by the notion
of an alliance between man, situated at the
interface between the divine order and the
natural order, and a law-giving, apprehen¬
sible god, a sovereign architect conceived in
our own image.
The correspondence between the German
mathematician and philosopher Gottfried
Leibniz and the English philosopher Samuel
Clarke, acting as Isaac Newton's mouth¬
piece, is very revealing in this respect. The
correspondence followed a criticism made
by Leibniz in which he accused Newton of
having a very poor opinion of God, since,
according to Newton, his handiwork was
less perfect than that of a good clockmaker.
Newton had, in fact, spoken of the con¬
stant intervention of God, the creator of a
world whose activity he unceasingly nour¬
ished. In reply, Newton and Clarke accused
Leibniz of reducing God to the status of a
Deus otiosus, an idler king, who, after a once
and for all act of creation, retires from the
stage. In classical science, dominated by the

### 79189: The New convergence of science and culture
One of the most important research tools in
nuclear physics is the particle accelerator, a
device which produces beams of fast-moving
electrically charged atomic or subatomic par¬
ticles. Photos above show the behaviour of a
beam ofoxygen particles emergingfrom a colli¬
sion with a lead target during an experiment at
CERN (the European Organization for Nuc¬
lear Research) in Geneva where the highest-
ever beam energies in laboratory conditions
have been achieved. The data revealed by such
experiments may help us to know more about
the origin of the Universe.
notion of the possibility of an omniscient
power indifferent to the passage of time,
Leibniz' view prevailed. The present deter¬
mined the future, just as it could serve to
reconstruct the past.
The almost inconceivable nature of this
idea of dynamic reversibility should, per¬
haps, be stressed. The question of time, of
what maintains, creates, disrupts the flow of
time, has always been one' of mankind's
central preoccupations. Many mystics have
denied the reality of this changing, uncertain
world and have postulated the ideal of at¬
tainment of a state of knowledge that would
make it possible to escape from the treadmill
of life. However, none of these speculative
postulations has gone so far as to affirm that
there is an equivalence between what is done
and what is undone, between a plant that
burgeons, flowers and dies and a plant that
comes back to life, grows younger and re¬
gresses to the original seed. Classical sci¬
ence, and in particular classical dynamism,
forcefully affirms this equivalence.
Einstein, perhaps, best represents this vo¬
cation of physics, this ideal of a body of
knowledge that strips our conception of the
world of those accretions which, for him,
were merely indicative of human subjectiv¬
ity. It has always been the ambition of
certain mystics to escape from the torments
of a changing, deceptive world. Einstein
made this ambition the very vocation of the
physicist and, in doing so, expressed it in
scientific terms. The mystics sought to live
this world as though it were an illusion;
Einstein, on the other hand, aimed to dem¬
onstrate that it was merely an illusion and
that reality consists of a transparent, intelli¬
gible Universe, purged of everything that
touches on the lives of men, of painful,
nostalgic memory of the past, of fear or
hope for the future.
Within the context of such a conception,
irreversibility, the notion of things happen¬
ing, is reduced to mere illusion, resulting
from the approximations that we introduce
in our description of the world.
Important as it may have been for the
progress of knowledge, the triumph of clas¬
sical science entailed a rift between the
world and man the importance of which
cannot be over-estimated. The external
world appeared to be an automaton, a
clockwork mechanism that had been regu¬
lated once and for all; it was in absolute
opposition to our inner world in which,
rightly or wrongly, we live in a time rhythm
which creates novelty, new events, and in
which we are conscious of having a freedom
of choice on which is based the notion of
rationality. Herein lie the roots of the di¬
chotomy that has coloured the whole of
Western thought since the emergence of
modern science. I cannot here enter into the
development that this problem deserves;
but students of the history of ideas will
already have noticed the irreducible dualism
it entails and which is manifest in works
such as those of Immanuel Kant and Henri
Bergson. This dualism results inevitably in a
precarious insertion of science into culture
which persists to this day.
My aim in this paper is to attempt to show
that we are slowly getting closer to a more
unitary vrew of things in which our descrip¬
tion of the Universe and our existential
experience are once more converging. We
are, perhaps, thus coming nearer to the
realization of Karl Popper's dream, which
he expressed in these words: "...the aim is a
picture of the world in which there is room
for biological phenomena, for human free¬
dom and human reason."
The twentieth-century contribution
It is not my intention to list here the
details of the immense contribution that has
been made during the twentieth century to
scientific and technological research. I
would, however, Tike to lay stress on the
revision of those ideas that have had a deci¬
sive impact on the relationship between sci¬
ence and culture. I shall start with the field
of classical dynamics, the discipline which
marked the emergence of Western science.
We are living through a revolution in
classical dynamics which began with Henri
Poincaré, continued with A.N. Kolmogo-
rov and has become one of the most active
fields of research in physics and mathemat¬
ics. Of what does this revolution consist? A
landmark observation made by the meteo¬
rologist Edward Lorenz pointed the way.
Lorenz noted that two time sequences of
temperature variation could diverge spec¬
tacularly, however superposable they were
at the starting period. This is the hallmark of
unstable dynamic systems. Thus it is pos¬
sible to predict the position of the Earth
over a period of five million years, because
the movement of the Earth is essentially (if
we ignore disturbances due to other planets)

an element of a dynamically stable system.
We can, however, only predict the evolution
of the Earth's temperature over relatively
short periods of time because here we are
concerned with an unstable dynamic sys¬
tem. This notion of instability turns out to
be basic to the understanding of the major
laws of physics.
The notions of instability, of chaos and of
amplification are today among the central
preoccupations of a growing number of
researchers in areas ranging from mathemat¬
ics to economics. The notorious "black
Monday" of 19 October 1987 (the day on
which share values crashed on the world's
money markets) may one day be remem¬
bered as a date in the history of science, not
in memory of the victims who saw the value
of their shares melt away, but because since
that day leading newspapers in the United
States have published articles on chaos dy¬
namics as a result of which such notions as
fluctuation, amplification and bifurcation
have come to the attention of the general
public, in much the same way as did, a few
years ago, the notions of the "Big Bang" and
"Black Holes".
Having said that, it should be noted that
to talk of fluctuation, amplification, sur¬
prise, is to evoke the negative aspect of
dynamic instability. There is, however, a
positive side; unstable systems subject to the
constraints of non-equilibrium are capable
of producing structures to which systems in
thermodynamic equilibrium can offer no
equivalent. What seems to me to be impor¬
tant in all this is that it reveals the limitations
of the classical, reductionist conception of
the Universe whose aim is to describe the
Universe in terms of groupings of stable
entities, established once and for all, wheth¬
er they be elementary particles, atoms or
molecules. We are now aware that there are
global phenomena which cannot be ana¬
lysed in this manner.
Rethinking the notion of complexity
The twentieth century will go down as
the century of surprises. It is true that quan¬
tum mechanics and relativity drew oh the
achievements of the nineteenth century. It
was such men as Ernst Mach and Ludwig
Boltzmann who, in turn of the century
Vienna, asked the questions which were to
give rise to these two prodigious theoretical
constructs. Yet as well as building on the
science of the nineteenth century, the twen¬
tieth century has witnessed discoveries that
constitute a fundamental break with the
past. Who would have predicted that time
would become a key element at the most
fundamental level of matter in the trans¬
formation of elementary particles as well as
at the cosmological level? Who would have
thought that determinism and reversibility,
which formed the bases of physical intelligi¬
bility in the classical sense, would be over¬
turned by new phenomena and new theo¬
ries? As William Golding put it,
determinism represents for us a form of
"cultural defeatism"; yet it is precisely on
this point that twentieth-century science is
diverging from classical science.
Today we can no longer identify certainty
and reason, or probability and ignorance.
For classical science, order was associated
with equilibrium and disorder with non-
equilibrium. It might now be said that this
relationship has been reversed. Non-equi¬
librium creates structures whose coherence
largely surpasses that of equilibrium struc¬
tures as described by classical science.
Movements such as those of a falling body
would have been described unhesitatingly
by classical science as simple, and phenom-
Photos © CERN, Geneva
ena occurring in the brain or within human
societies would have been considered
complex.
Today, however, we know that, even
where gravitational phenomena are con¬
cerned, when we pass on from study of the
movements of a system comprising two
bodies to examination of a system involving
three bodies, new patterns of behaviour
appear which have much in common with
that of systems that were traditionally con¬
sidered to be complex. As a result, the gap
between systems that used to be called sim¬
ple and those said to be complex has largely
disappeared. This new state of affairs means
that it is now possible to make transfers of
knowledge that would have been inconceiv¬
able only a few years ago, as witness such
areas as information theory and artificial
intelligence.
With the development of new means of
observation, ranging from radioactive iso¬
topes to artificial satellites, we have discov¬
ered that ecosystems are unstable; and this
has occurred at the very moment when
non-linear dynamics has supplied us with
the theoretical tools to understand the am¬
plification of fluctuations and the appear¬
ance of bifurcations that can occur within
such systems. Better understanding of the
instabilities of ecological systems and study
of the future prospects for our planet are
clearly priority matters. We have to go be¬
yond the conservation concept. We know,
for example, that some 10,000 years ago our
planet enjoyed optimal climatic conditions
and the Sahara and the Gobi, now both
deserts, supported flourishing civilizations.
There is nothing to exclude hopes of a
return to such a Utopian situation.
This new vision of Nature has also
changed our understanding of our position
within it. The consequences of progress

made in molecular biology were stated with
unprecedented clarity in Jacques Monod's
book Le Hasard et la Nécessité: "The old
alliance is broken; man knows at last that he
is alone in the uncaring immensity of the
Universe from which he emerged by
chance."
Thus classical science seemed to point the
way to disillusion, if not alienation. Howev¬
er, the conflict described by Monod be¬
tween the unchanging laws of an inanimate
world and the evolutionary phenomenon
described by biology is today largely resolv¬
ed. The image we have of the outside world
is converging with the image we have of our
own interior activity. The twentieth century
has brought us the hope of cultural unity, of
a non-reductionist, more global vision. The
sciences are not the reflection of a static
rationality to be resisted or submitted to;
they are furthering understanding in the
same way as are human activities taken as a
whole. They alone cannot tell us what is
man, what is Nature, what is society. They
are exploring a complex reality in which are
inextricably intertwined what we tend to
place in opposition under the headings of
what is and what ought to be.
Action plans for the 'silicon age'
The new picture that we have of the
Nature that surrounds us and of our posi¬
tion in it is beginning to have repercussions
in the field of culture. A new naturalism is
emerging and we are aware of a new sense of
solidarity between man and other living
creatures, indeed, with the entire biosphere.
Moreover, this transitional phase in science
coincides with a period in which mankind
itself is going through an age of transition.
The original contribution of the twentieth
century is that it has proposed some un¬
expected solutions to the contradictions in¬
herited from the nineteenth century.

Strangely enough, what is true for science
is also true with regard to the history of
mankind, for the great dramas of the two
world wars were above all due to ideological
hangovers from the past, and in particular
from the nineteenth century. It is no doubt
rather rash to make a judgement about a
century in which we are still immersed. It is
my hope, however, that historians of the
future will recognize, as we do, the signs of
the break with the past which were traced
out after the Second World War, a rupture
which seemed to herald a more naturalistic
vision, a new alliance between man and
Nature and greater respect for human
dignity.
The rapid phase of development on which
we are now embarked bears with it the
danger of the creation of a rift between
those with knowledge and those deprived of
it, and between those who are taking part in
and benefiting from the current scientific
and economic revolution and those who
have no share in it. The scandals of disease,
famine and the inequitable distribution of
wealth have been referred to on several
occasions during this Conference. Never¬
theless, science has made possible the emer¬
gence of a kind of society in which individu¬
al responsibility is greater than it has ever

been, and has created a universal language
by means of which men can communicate.
The programme of action which emerges
from the analysis I have put forward corre¬
sponds with some of the points raised in
other papers presented. The importance of
knowledge, at all levels, has been stressed
(the fight against illiteracy, reform of ele¬
mentary education, restructuring of re¬
search systems in the developed countries to
make them more oriented towards the man/
Nature interface). This implies that support
should be given to programmes such as
Global Change2 and to the Japanese Gov¬
ernment's proposed Human Frontiers* pro¬
gramme, which could lead to the establish¬
ment of a worldwide network of scientific
collaboration. In the same spirit, it is vital to
press for pooling of the resources of the
oceans, of space and of information.
The new rationality that science is devel¬
oping is far from having the weight it should
have in the decision-making process if we
want to look beyond the short term. This is
why I recently proposed the creation of a
European Scientific Assembly which could
assist the Commission of the European Eco¬
nomic Community in the conduct of its
policies. Many other initiatives need to be
taken if the objectives mentioned here are to
be attained.
Science today has the potential to im¬
prove the overall situation of the world;
what is still needed is the political will to do
so. Here I must underline what Wassily
Leontief4 has said: we need a new Marshall
Plan for the developing countries. As Chan¬
cellor Willy Brandt has said, we must also
seek to reduce international tensions, for
example by encouraging the overtures made
by countries such as the USSR and the
People's Republic of China.
The science of today promotes a plural¬
istic outlook. We must henceforth combat
reductionist ideologies within the human
sciences, in economics and in culture in
general. This change in attitudes has already
manifested itself over recent decades in such
fields as music and literature. We rightly
deplore the danger of the destruction of our
cultural heritage by the mass media. On the
other hand, the media are making possible
an unprecedented level of cultural exchange.
One of the essential lessons that the twen¬
tieth century has taught us is that the strug¬
gle for the control of territory and raw
materials no longer plays its age-old role in
the history of human societies. It has often
been pointed out that, in what might be
called the "silicon age", the critical scarcity
is no longer the scarcity of raw materials.
I have always been struck by the syn¬
chronism that seems to mark human history
on the planetary scale. The great technical
advances of the New Stone Age, such as
pottery and agriculture, have always ap¬
peared at comparable periods of history in
various parts of the world. This synchro¬
nism, however, has been disrupted, with the
nineteenth century marking the high point
of this process of cultural disequilibrium. It
was the century of inequality, of savages and
civilized man, of colonizers and the colo¬
nized.

In the twentieth century, an attempt has
been made to move away from this sit¬
uation, to seek behind all the conflicts a
more universal conception of human digni¬
ty that is less subject to the constraints of
history. In this respect too, the twentieth
century has marked an irreversible turning-
point in the history of mankind a turning-
point that heralds a new age, a bifurcation.
Will this be a new point of departure to¬
wards Karl Popper's dream of an open so¬
ciety? One of the fundamental lessons that
twentieth century science offers us is that
time is not fixed, determined; it is a process
of construction in which our future lies. It is
to be hoped that this Conference will make
a significant contribution to that process of
construction.

### 79191: The Labyrinth of knowledge
The labyrinth ofknowledge
Baruch S. Blumberg
I should like to discuss two strangely
interrelated subjects. The first deals
with an aspect of the scientific process
that tells us that it is difficult or impossible
to obtain perfect knowledge about a subject.
The second is concerned with problems of
medical care which require a strong measure
of personal responsibility.
In one construction of the scientific proc¬
ess, hypotheses are formulated from obser¬
vations, or from theory, and laboratory or
observational experiments are designed to
test the hypotheses. After the conclusion of
each experiment, a decision is made as to
whether the hypothesis is supported or re¬
jected. The data collected to test the first
hypothesis can then be used to generate new
hypotheses which, in turn, generate more
answers, but also more questions. The more
we know, the more we know about what we
don't know. If perfect knowledge means
that we know everything possible about a
subject, then the scientific process, as I have
described it, does not achieve that goal.
When a problem is solved it raises another
problem, the solution of which in turn cre¬
ates new problems. The story of Daedalus, a
hero of Ancient Greek mythology, is an
interesting metaphor for this process.
Daedalus was an architect, a sculptor, an
engineer, an artisan and a problem solver.
But each time he solved a problem, other
problems were generated. While serving at
the court of King Minos of Crete, he solved
the problem of Queen Pasiphae's love for a
great white bull. He designed and built a
model, a life-size hollow cow. When the
Queen was placed inside, she became im¬
pregnated. However, this solution to her
problem raised another one, namely, the
issue of this union, the dreaded man-mon¬
ster, the Minotaur.
Daedalus solved this problem by design¬
ing and constructing the Labyrinth, a maze
in which the Minotaur was secured. This in
turn created another problem: Athenian
youths and maidens had to be offered to the
Minotaur each year, which caused Daedalus
much grief since he himself was an Athe¬
nian. To resolve this situation he helped
Theseus and Ariadne (daughter of the King
and Queen and therefore half sister to the
monster) to kill the Minotaur and escape
from the great maze. But this led to Daeda¬
lus' imprisonment in the Labyrinth along
with his son Icarus. The solution to this
problem the escape of Daedalus and Ica¬
rus, using wings that Daedalus had designed
and made of feathers and wax led to the
death of Icarus. Daedalus, however, flew on
to other adventures and to the solution and
creation of new problems.

Thus the product of scientific creativity
and problem solving often seems to be a
new problem, even though the overall result
may be satisfactory. It is valuable to keep
this possibility in mind as we use science to
solve new social problems arising from ad¬
vances in technology, such as improvements
in health care.
The World Health Organization has set
itself the goal of achieving "Health for all by
the year 2000". Measures to achieve this will
include those taken by governments and
civic organizations, and those which are the
responsibility of the individual. The former
are particularly important in developing
countries. Primary among them are ensur¬
ing the purity of food and water, appropri¬
ate management of the disposal of human
wastes, control of disease carrying insects,
and mass vaccination programmes. In the
developed countries, because of the general¬
ly high standard of living, good housing and
sophisticated infrastructure, many of these
problems have been solved. If these achieve¬
ments can be extended to countries where
life expectancy is shorter, dramatic im¬
provements can be predicted.
Both in the developed and the developing
countries, the individual's participation in
the process of health care is essential.
Changes in everyday behaviour are essential
requirements ' for a healthy community.
Cigarette smoking, excessive use of alcohol,
diets which lead to obesity and a high level
of cholesterol, and lack of regular exercise,
are responsible for a major part of the dis¬
ease load. Accidents, often caused by auto¬
mobile drivers under the influence of alco¬
hol, and violent behaviour, homicide and
suicide, are major contributors to premature
death. Obviously, society plays a large part
in helping to alter behaviour along lines
acceptable to it, but ultimately it is the

individual who must give up destructive
habits.
There is evidence that society responds to
useful information produced by research
and can bring about changes in people's
lifestyle. In the United States, and to a lesser
extent in other countries, the number of
smokers has decreased dramatically in the
past decade, and this is reflected, in part, in
the plateauing and decrease in the curve of
lung cancer incidence in male's. During the
past few years there has been a dramatic
decrease in cardiovascular disease in many
population groups in the USA and else¬
where. These results are partly due to im¬
provements in medical and hospital care,
but they can be largely attributed to health¬
ier diets and the popularity of vigorous
physical activity approaching near mania
in some communities.
Another dramatic behaviour change, al¬
most certainly due to the application of data
derived from research, has occurred in one
of the high-risk groups for the current tragic
epidemic of AIDS. In one of the areas where
AIDS is most prevalent, the virus which
causes the disease has now infected about 60
per cent of the population, and many of
these individuals will die. But among those
who are uninfected, the incidence of new
infection has decreased to about 1 per cent
per year. This also appears to be a conse¬
quence of changes in behaviour which de¬
crease the probability of infection.
It is encouraging to note that society
often responds in an intelligent and reason¬
able manner when provided with the neces¬
sary information in an acceptable form. As
more is learned, largely through research, it
is likely that there will be an even greater
improvement in public health, and people
can enjoy a longer period of disease-free life.
BARUCH SAMUEL BLUMBERG, of the Un¬
ited States, shared the 1976 Nobel Prize for Phy¬

on population genetics led to the discovery of the

Tomorrow's medicine
Jean Dausset
THE concept of science, which re¬
lates to knowledge, is often con¬
fused in the public mind with the
concept of technology, which concerns the
utilization of knowledge.
Man, himself derived from matter, is be¬
ginning to "know" and understand his envi¬
ronment and the great forces which control
it, and to apprehend the mechanisms of life.
Knowledge is the glory of man. Knowledge
frees man, while ignorance restricts and
constrains him. The progress of science as a
fundamental cognitive acquisition cannot
and must not be halted.
Technology is the tool which enables
knowledge to be used. This is how, down
the centuries, man has slowly but gradually
acquired a certain mastery over his envi¬
ronment, while at the same time developing
his psychic and spiritual capacities.
Then, suddenly, in a few decades in¬
deed, during our generationwe have wit¬
nessed and, in the case of some of you,
actively participated in, man's acquisition of
tremendous powers. Through atomic fis¬
sion he has acquired an almost inexhaustible
source of energy. Computer science has
increased almost to infinity his powers of
calculation, analysis, indeed of prediction
and even decision. Thanks to the application
of molecular biology to genetics, he is ac¬
quiring control over life itself.
We thus have the remarkable privilege of
living at a unique moment in the history of
our species, certainly the most exciting, but
also the most dangerous, period in the hu¬
man adventure. This means that our gener¬
ation bears a heavy responsibility to which
we cannot remain indifferent and from
which we must not try to escape.
The possession of this knowledge and this
power imposes new duties on man. He must
cease to be the plaything of chance and to
submit passively to his fate, for he is now
capable of guiding his destiny towards a
well-thought-out future in other words,
of assuming control of his own destiny. We

have no right to be either optimistic or
pessimistic. We owe it to ourselves to be
clear-sighted.
In the first place, we must not try to hide
from ourselves the fact that we have already
inflicted serious damage on the biosphere,
nor the fact that the very survival .of our
species on this planet with its limited re¬
sources is seriously threatened.
Fortunately, this situation is not irrevers¬
ible, since it is largely due to the time-lag
between the rapidity of material changes, as
discoveries are made at increasing speed,
and the inertia of mental attitudes whose
slow rate of evolution is counted in gener¬
ations. This significant time-lag is causing
the current malaise or crisis which, we
hope, is only a crisis of growth. An enor¬
mous effort of adaptation is thus urgently
necessary.
Up to now, thanks to his intelligence,
ingenuity, tenacity and dynamism, man has
been able to adapt to every situation, how¬
ever critical or extreme. Why should this
not be so again?
Scientists and all thinking people must
mobilize to promote this adaptation by the

most rapid and effective means. Indeed that
is why we are here today.
As a biologist, I am proud of the enor¬
mous benefits that modern medicine has
brought to millions of people, but I cannot
hide from myself the fact that the improve¬
ment in health has resulted in an almost
insupportable growth in the world's pop¬
ulation, with its accompaniment of poverty
and suffering.
Nevertheless, medicine must unremit¬
tingly continue its work. Let us not forget
that at least 1,000 million people are still
affected by parasitic diseases: 200 million by
malaria, leading to between 8 and 10 million
deaths per year; 200 million by bilharzia; 10
million in South America by Chagas' disease
(American Tripanosomiasis); not counting
the blind, the crippled and the outcasts who
are victims of other forms of parasitosis.
In this already serious context which
must not be disregarded a previously un¬
known (or little known?) disease appeared
only a few years ago: AIDS, which now
affects both industrialized and developing
countries, particularly those in Africa.
The figures speak for themselves. The
World Health Organization (WHO) esti¬
mates the total number of AIDS cases at
between 100,000 and 150,000, possibly un¬
derestimating the countless number of vic¬
tims in Africa, most of whom are not rec¬
orded or even treated. The number of cases
is doubling every year. Five to ten million
people throughout the world will probably
be infected by the virus by 1991.
AIDS is, therefore, a major challenge to
mankind. Since the time of Pasteur we have
become accustomed to the virtual disap¬
pearance, at least in the industrialized coun¬
tries, of the danger of fatal infectious dis¬
eases, but now a new killer disease is
spreading. Charles Nicolle1 warned us that
"Perhaps this is the noblest accomplishment ofour
century: as we abolish distance, men everywhere
recognize one another as brothers. For, let us
confess, on a moral level our society is merely
groping forprogress. Ourpriorities seem without
real focus. We are more preoccupied with prob¬
lems of space than with any ethical quest, or any
quest for an ethic. Concrete matters interest us
more than humanity's heart and soul. Man walks
on the Moon, but remains distant from his fellow
man. He explores the depths ofthe sea, the limits of
the Universe, but his next-door neighbour re¬
mains a stranger. We live to become very old, but
old age has become a burden and a curse. "

Medicine, 1928
new diseases would appear through the nat¬
ural play of the agents of infection, causing
ravages before their hosts became adapted
through selection of the most resistant
individuals.
The challenge of AIDS concerns psychol¬
ogists, sociologists and politicians, as well as
medical doctors and research scientists.
The challenge to doctors is all the greater
since they are practically helpless at present
and the deaths of their patients are the more
distressing because most of them are young
people in the prime of life, fully aware of
their condition and prospects. Their lives
are broken, and the distress of their families
is total. In most cases these patients are
looked after by doctors and nurses with
exemplary dedication and compassion.
Although an agent of infection has never
before been identified, isolated, studied and
analysed so rapidly, the challenge to re¬
searchers and biologists is extremely severe.
The AIDS virus or viruses have proved to be
particularly formidable adversaries because
they penetrate and destroy the very cells
whose role is to defend the organism. Any
immunity protection is thus annihilated and
the patient becomes a prey to many other
infections which he or she is no longer
capable of resisting.

tional Red Cross feeding centre for refugees in
Ethiopia.
The stakes are therefore very high. Scien¬
tists have been mobilized on a world-wide
scale. This mobilization should, and must,
lead as quickly as possible to means of
curing and preventing the disease.
The challenge to psychologists and so¬
ciologists is no less serious. It stems from
our thorough understanding of the method
of contamination by sexual channels or
through the blood. The number of infected
but apparently healthy persons is growing
rapidly, and in the social categories most
affected, such as drug addicts and homosex¬
uals, it has reached the alarming rates of 20
to 40 per cent. It is primarily among the
high-risk groups that action must be taken
to try to check the spread of the disease.
Efforts must be made to convince those
already infected, the sero-positive, of their
enormous responsibility to society, for the
spread or restriction of the epidemic de¬
pends solely upon their sexual behaviour.
It must also be pointed out that the atti¬
tudes of psychologists and sociologists nec¬
essarily varies considerably with cultures,
customs, ideas and taboos. Thus, these atti¬
tudes differ greatly in Africa and in Western
societies. Likewise, such apparently simple
means of protection as condoms are readily
available to some people and practically
inaccessible to others. Here injustice in the
face of disease reaches its peak.
But perhaps the greatest challenge is that
facing politicians, because in this situation
the individual interests of the sick and the
sero-positive do not always coincide with
the interests of society. Sometimes these
interests are even opposed hence the enor¬
mous difficulty in setting up effective bar¬
riers to the spread of the virus. Jurists and
politicians are thus faced with a challenge of
exceptional dimensions. It remains to be
seen whether their response to it will be
adequate.
Of course, society has a duty to protect
its citizens, but this must be done with due
respect for the freedom and dignity of the
individual. Should authoritarian measures
which alienate certain individual freedoms
be taken if the interest of the community
calls for them? Such measures have been
proposed and even applied in certain coun¬
tries. All of them are discriminatory. They
consist of compulsory notification, system¬
atic screening, jsolation or segregation of
AIDS cases and even of those infected with
the virus, their exclusion from certain types
of employment, sanitary restrictions, and
sanctions.
But it seems that wisdom is prevailing and
that, with a few exceptions, governments
have concluded that authoritarian measures
would probably be ineffective and would in
any case be largely unacceptable.
Naturally, once an anti-AIDS vaccine has
been proved effective, vaccination can be
made compulsory, as in the case of some
other vaccines.
What should be done? In the present state
of our knowledge, the fight must be con¬
fined to the most intimate domain of indi¬
vidual behaviour, that of sexual life. Only
clear, calm, credible, objective and complete
information, free from excessive prudery
and sensationalism, is likely to have any
effect. This information must combat
myths, alarmist rumours and falsehoods. It
must demonstrate the seriousness and- fre¬
quency of the risk, causing fear but not
panic which could lead to irrational, unjust
and even violent attitudes. The role and
responsibility of the media in the field of
information and communication are of fun¬
damental importance.
AIDS is a social phenomenon which caus¬
es the pendulum to swing backward. For
centuries the sexual behaviour of our fore¬
bears was conditioned by fear of syphilis
and pregnancy. The contraceptive pill has
liberated our children's morals. AIDS may
restrict them again, demonstrating the ex¬
tent to which morality and physiology are
linked.

### 79192: Tomorrow's medicine
We hope that the authorities who take
measures against this scourge of modern
times will do so in a spirit of scientific
precision and tolerance.
The second subject about which I should
like to speak, as a biologist, is the major
impact which new developments in the
study of genetics are bound to have on
tomorrow's world.
In this field man has acquired the fab¬
ulous capacity to decipher and modify the
genetic programme which governs the con¬
struction of living beings. I wonder whether
it is generally realized that all forms of life
on Earth are programmed and coded by an
extraordinarily limited number of chemical
structures, the four nucleotides adenine,
thymine, cytosine and guanine, which are
the four letters A, T, C, Gof the al¬
phabet of life. It is only the order of se¬
quence of these four letters that causes a
rosebush or a maize plant to differ from a
bacterium, an elephant or a human being.
Man's genetic programme comprises
3,000 million of these four characters, form¬
ing an enormous molecule curled up in the
thousands of millions of cells in our bodies.
If it were given the means, molecular biol¬
ogy would now be capable of reading this
enormous text which would fill 1,000 vol¬
umes of 1,000 pages each and whose compo¬
nent words are the genes which code the
constituent elements of the organism.
Highly sensitive chemical tools now en¬
able us to identify indicators throughout the
length of this long filament, which can be
compared to milestones and between which
we can locate the genes of many diseases.
Thus it has become possible to know
whether or not an individual is a carrier of a
defective gene or whether a child is certain
to be born handicapped, in which case ap¬
propriate measures can be taken. The same
procedure can be applied to more complex
diseases such as cardiovascular ailments,
high blood pressure, diabetes and even
cancer.
The medicine of the twenty-first century
will be predictive medicine. It will be pos¬
sible, to a much greater extent than at pre¬
sent, to predict and therefore prevent rather
than cure. The dream of a long life with all
one's faculties intact to the end is, perhaps,
no longer unattainable.
But the geneticist's power is often feared
by the public. Geneticists are admired when
they succeed in modifying a plant or animal
species in order to obtain a better yield, but
people also fear that one day the same meth¬
ods will be applied to man. Biologists have
long been regarded as benefactors, but
they now risk being seen as sorcerer's
apprentices.
Rather like physicists in the years 1945 to
1950, geneticists are faced with a very seri¬
ous moral dilemma. Should they continue
their research regardless of the conse¬
quences, or should they set limits to it, and
create a sanctuary that must not be violated?
"/ wonder whether it is generally realized that
all forms of life on Earth are programmed and
coded by an extraordinarily limited number of
chemical structures, the four nucleotides ade¬
nine, thymine, cytosine andguanine A, T, C,
G of the alphabet oflife. It is only the order of
sequence of these four letters that causes a
rosebush or a maize plant to differ from a
bacterium, an elephant or a human being."
Above, diagram ofthe "double helix" structure
of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic
material of all living things.
Personally, I believe that there is no limit to
the acquisition of knowledge, evenper¬
haps especially knowledge about the hu¬
man genetic inheritance, but I am absolutely
convinced that all attempts to modify this
inheritance must be strictly forbidden.
Here a distinction must be made. To
insert a normal gene into a patient in order
to correct his or her disorder is highly
desirable provided the gene is inserted into a
cell which does not participate in the repro¬
ductive process. On the other hand, to in¬
sert a gene into a germinal cell or into a very
young embryo is a criminal act because the
result could be transmitted to posterity and
the human genetic inheritance would be
modified.
It is easy to imagine what such practices
could lead to if they served a totalitarian
ideology. As the late Peter Medawar2 once
said, false eugenics of that kind would
"smell horribly like a gas chamber".
Man's genetic inheritance is a treasure
that belongs to all humanity and it must not
be traded or modified. Any interference
with it could disturb its admirable harmony.
We are collectively responsible for this jewel
of evolution, the human species, for the
wonderful potential we bear within us and
which too often is still allowed to lie fallow,
for the marvellous capital contained in the
brain of everyman. Responsiblewhat a
beautiful word, instantly conjuring up lu¬
cidity, moral force capable of decisions, and
the willpower to execute them.
I am honoured to be the current chairman
of the French branch of the Universal
Movement for Scientific Responsibility.
The purpose of this movement is to make
people aware of the responsibility of science
with regard to the future of mankind, of
ensuring that our children's lives will not
only be preserved but enriched in peace,
thanks to the mutual tolerance of our phys¬
ical and cultural differences.
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was not a
member of the Universal Movement for Sci¬
entific Responsibility, but the entire spirit of
the movement is expressed in his story Le
petit prince, by the fox who said to the Little
Prince: "There is one truth that men have
forgotten. But you you must never forget
it. You become responsible for ever for what
you have tamed."

»«i Co-operation

John Vane J\.lL)o

The problem of AIDS requires a
threefold solution. The first, which
should certainly reduce the inci¬
dence of the disease, is that of prophylaxis
by education. However, the results of the
campaign waged against cigarette smoking
in the United Kingdom during the last
twenty years suggest that educational action
will take time to bear fruit.
The other two solutions are prevention
through vaccination and treatment with
drugs. Both of these need enormous re¬
search and development resources. Aca¬
demic research is, on the whole, being well
funded. The scientific competition is enor¬
mous but it is also healthy because it leads to
rapid publication and dissemination of
knowledge on which others can build.
A different kind of competition is in¬
volved in the development of vaccines
against AIDS by the pharmaceutical indus¬
try. Here profit rather than kudos becomes
the motive.
"Research into theprevention and treatment of
AIDS must be pooled and encouraged, rather
than slowed down and overly partitioned, in
particular with the co-operation of the phar¬
maceutical industry. " This was one of the con¬
clusions reached by the Nobel Laureate Con¬
ference held at the Elysée Palace in Paris (see.
page 34). Above, still from Sharing for Survi¬
val, a short videofilm produced by the United
Nations University.
In the last twenty years more and more
drug companies have opted out of research
into human vaccines because of the risks
involved, mainly the potential high costs of
damages claimed by patients and others
against the companies for what are per¬
ceived to be side-effects of the vaccines.
These risks have come to outweigh earnings
from profits. Thus, only a few multinational
pharmaceutical companies are now capable

### 79194: Co-operation: the best way to combat AIDS
of developing and testing vaccines. Of
course, the case of AIDS is a special one
because of the frightening prospects and so
we can expect governments to relax their
stringent safety regulations to speed a vac¬
cine to the market. Nevertheless, the indus¬
try will (and indeed must) look for ways
whereby the liability for perceived side-
effects is carried by others. This usually
means the governments which sponsor vac¬
cination campaigns.
The third solution is to find and develop
effective drugs against AIDS and it is here
that we may have to look for new ways of
solving old problems. Clearly new effective
anti-AIDS drugs are urgently needed and
will be for many years to come, to treat the
millions of people already infected and all
those who will become infected, because of
lack of proper prophylaxis.
New drugs are a means of making new
profits, and their development and market¬
ing is a highly competitive and expensive
business. One company makes a break¬
through based upon research either in house
or in academia, puts large chemical re¬
sources into optimizing the desired activity
and protecting the patent and then begins
the laborious business of development.
With the present legislation for safety, effi¬
cacy and lack of side-effects at least ten
years may elapse between the discovery and
marketing of a drug. In the meantime, as
soon as the breakthrough is sensed, other
companies put parallel chemical, pharmac¬
ological and developmental resources into
finding their own patentable and profitable
copy, albeit with some improvements such
as less side-effects, better delivery or better
patient compliance.
On the one hand, it is argued that this free
competition between drug companies is
healthy and, through the profit motive,
leads to better and better remedies for more
and more diseases. On the other hand, it is
said that there are too many drugs on the
market and that the World Health Orga¬
nization (WHO) list of 200 essential drugs is
sufficient. These contradictory views will
continue and there will be a constant con¬
flict of interests between the need of the
drug companies to preserve profits and the
need of governments and patients to contain
their drug bills.
My purpose in raising this issue is simply
to point out that under the present system
of free enterprise a new drug therapy for
AIDS will not be produced because drug
companies wish to cure the disease, but
because they wish to make a profit from it!
My question is whether we can afford, both
in time and monetary terms, to allow the
commercial competitive process to run its
course or whether we can find new solu¬
tions which will speed up the acquisition of
effective drug therapy.
Certainly, governments around the world
have shown that they realize the urgency of
the problem by giving product licences for
the only existing drug, A2T or Retrovir,
with a remarkable and unprecedented ala¬
crity. What can the industry do now?
I would suggest that this is not the time
and this is not the disease for following
conventional pathways. We need to find
new solutions. One of these could be co¬
operation rather than competition between
pharmaceutical companies. Already there
are some areas in which there is loose co¬
operation between the multinational drug
companies. Surely here is another one where
an experimental approach could be tried.
For instance, an Institute for AIDS Re-

disease.
search, dedicated to the discovery of anti¬
viral drugs to combat the disease, could be
funded as a co-operative venture by the
pharmaceutical industry. In such an Insti¬
tute the chemical skills needed to synthesize
the many thousands of new compounds that
may be needed before the right one is found
could be co-ordinated, rather than pitted
against each other. Kudos and profit would
be shared equitably between the contrib¬
utors to the funding of the Institute. I am
sure that, given good-will between the com¬
panies, the licensing and patent lawyers
would find ways of enabling co-operation
to exist in the anti-AIDS field and this could
well speed up the process of discovery and
development.
There is another area in which the drug
industry could make an unusually generous
contribution. At present, a course of Retro¬
vir costs around $200 per week and some
patients will be taking an anti-AIDS drug
for the rest of their lives. We are told that
there are already 5 million people in Africa
carrying AIDS and this clearly poses a spe¬
cial problem, for neither they nor their
governments will be able to afford expensive
treatments. However, a precedent has al¬
ready been set: one far-sighted company has
made the inspired policy decision to give the
drug Ivermectin to Africa to treat river-
blindness. By taking only two oral doses a
year, untold numbers of people will prob¬
ably be prevented from becoming blind.
This remarkable and courageous decision
will not only make a major contribution to
the struggle against a crippling tropical
disease, but will also pass over to the gov¬
ernments concerned the responsibility for
any incidental environmental damage.
Perhaps this precedent could be a model
for the pharmaceutical industry when it
finds an effective anti-AIDS vaccine or
drug. Let the medicine be donated to those
in Africa and perhaps elsewhere who would
never have a chance of buying it!
My plea, therefore, is for the drug indus¬
try to adopt a "club" approach to the con¬
quest of this terrible disease. Pharmaceutical
companies already fund academic research
units in areas of discovery on an individual
basis. In the case of AIDS, let them club
together and do it on an industry-wide
basis. They do not have to eschew the profit
motive but only to modify it by jointly and
generously funding chemists and biologists
in a large Institute dedicated to ending this
new affliction..

### 79195: A 'Silent genocide'
A 'silentgenocide'
Abdus Salam
OUR planet is inhabited by two
distinct types of human beings.
According to the United Na¬
tions Development Programme (UNDP)
count of 1983, one quarter of mankind,
some 1,100 million people, are "developed".
They inhabit two-fifths of the land area of
the Earth, while 3,600 million "developing"
humans Les Misérables live in the re¬
maining three-fifths. I shall call them the
rich and the poor respectively, although
some of those in the developing world are
not exactly poor in pure economic terms. It
is not just the level of poverty which dis¬
tinguishes one type from the other, it is also
a question of ambition and dynamism, and
the differing contribution made by each
type to "present day culture" and to science
and technology.
During 1983, the rich countries enjoyed a
total Gross National Product (GNP) of
$10.5 trillion, $9,500 per year and per cap¬
ita, or around $800 per month. For the same
year, the poor countries had a total GNP of
$2.6 trillion, an average of $60 per capita per
month. The part of the world I come
fromSouth Asiawhich consists of Af¬
ghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakis¬
tan and Sri Lanka and has a population of
1,000 million, had a GNP of $250 per cap¬
ita. This means on an average $20 a month
or 70 cents a day. These 70 cents are sup¬
posed to provide us with two daily meals,
clothing, shelter, health care and education,
if any.
The rich quarter of humanity "lead" the
"North-Centric" world of today through
their economic superiority and their mil¬
itary prowess. They include the two super¬
powers, the USA and the USSR, with pop¬
ulations of 235 and 272 million (and GNPs
of $3.3 trillion and $1.85 trillion, respec¬
tively). The "leaders" as a whole suffer from
two problems: a nuclear psychosis and un¬
employment. They seem to have conscious¬
ly chosen to keep 10 per cent of their active
population unemployed feeding and
clothing them at subsistence level.
The remaining three-quarters of human¬
ity includes some of the peoples who built
up the oldest civilizations of the planet the
Chinese, the Hindu, the Buddhist and the
Islamic. Their basic problems are lack of
food (some countries are wracked by recur-
"Unfortunately, there are fewpoints ofcontad
between the two types of human beings, the
rich and the poor. "
ring famines); of shelter; of clothing; of
health care; of education. Their situation is
aggravated by the problems of unemploy¬
ment; adverse terms of trade; chronic indeb¬
tedness (to the tune of $1 trillion); over¬
crowding; and lack of security.
I am not referring to the obviously shel¬
terless, the obviously needy. I have in mind,
rather, the uncomplaining hungry millions,
whoand I speak from experience sel¬
dom get two regular meals a day; the mil¬
lions who must often choose between buy
ing badly needed food or a Schoolbook for
their child. They live in a crushing poverty
of the kind that has not been known in
Europe and the United States since the time
of Dickens. I never cease to be amazed that,
despite this "silent genocide", the human
spirit does not break and that most of the
needy are still able to keep up a dignified
appearance.
Lack of security is today one of the most
unsettling aspects of life in the developing
world. The causes include: military dicta¬
torships (perhaps, as one dictator succeeds

Unfortunately, there are few points of
contact between the two types of human
beings. Some of these are historical in nature,
a consequence of the Imperial past. Others
include a shared environment most of the
tropical forests which are the "lungs" of our

developing countries. The rich countries are
just beginning to appreciate the biological
importance of tropical forests for all human¬

their upkeep. Another point of contact is
the need for raw materials, substitutes for

and gas, as well as food items such as ba¬
nanas.

but it is not. All the developing countries

together account for no more than 20 per
cent of world trade. A recent study points
out that "the thirty-six countries the 'Real
South'with a per capita income of less
than $400 and half of the world's population
(including China, India and Pakistan) sur¬
prisingly account for no more than 3 per
cent of world trade".1
For all practical purposes, the "Real
Poor", like Frantz Fanon's2 oppressed
Blacks, make no mark on the present world.
Like all poor anywhere, they could dis¬
appear from the face of the Earth without
leaving any trace. What can be done about
their predicament?
There are two contrasting answers to this
question. Either to eliminate all the poor on
the lines of what the Irish satirist Jonathan
Swift suggested in his famous "modest pro¬
posal" to solve the problem of famine in
Ireland two centuries ago.3 Or if the con¬
science of the world will not accept a "final
solution" (and fortunately there are people
in the rich countries who would oppose
this), then the only other alternative is to try
to restore some measure of human dignity
to this assortment of peoples.
My thesis is that the situation of the
developing world can be improved in the
long term only through an assisted and
massive importation of modern science and
technology, the possession of which is the
basic difference between the North and the
South. Such a step may incidentally also
solve the unemployment problem of the
rich countries through the demand for
goods and services it would generate.

### 79196: Overarmament and underdevelopment
Overarmament and
underdevelopment
Willy Brandt
DEVELOPMENT and peace are in¬
terdependent questions of such
vital international importance
that, especially if the ecological aspect is also
taken into account, the destiny of our planet
and that of humanity hinges on adequate
solutions being found for them.
In scientific analyses and in political prac¬
tice these interdependences often go unrec¬
ognized. Although the close relationship
between peace and development is immedi¬
ately obvious in the countries of the South,
it is also true that disasters in the South have
an immediate impact on the countries of the
North.
The reports submitted by the Brandt
Commission (.1977), the Palme Commission
(1980), and the Brundtland Commission
(1987)1 were firmly based on the concept of
common responsibility for the future of our
planet and also attached importance to the
concept of interdependence though with
varying emphasis.
The notions of "common interests",
"common security", and "common future"
demand that uncompromising confronta¬
tions should be ended throughout the world
and give way to harmonious coexistence.
None of the major problems prevailing
between industrialized nations and devel¬
oping countries can be effectively solved by
means of confrontation. Reasonable solu¬
tions can only be based on dialogue and
co-operation.
However, this will not be possible with¬
out a new understanding of mutual depend¬
encies. There are many positive sides to this
interdependence: all countries would bene¬
fit from a strengthening of the world econo¬
my involving a reduction of national debts
and an improvement of the climate for
growth and investment.
All of them would also benefit from a
more careful use of non-renewable raw ma¬
terials and greater respect for environmental
1. The Brandt Commission on International Devel¬
opment Issues and the Palme Commission on Dis¬
armament and Security Issues were founded, respec¬
tively, on the initiative of Willy Brandt (Chancellor of
the Federal Republic of Germany, 1969-1974) and of
Olof Palme, formerly Prime Minister "of Sweden. Dis¬
tinguished figures from a number of countries served on
these Independent Commissions set up to study major
international problems. The World Commission on En¬
vironment and Development, chaired by Mrs. Gro Har¬
lem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, was com¬
missioned by the General Assembly of the United
Nations in 1983. Editor

resources; and all of them would benefit
from stabilization of the world population.
Objectively speaking, all countries be
they North or South, East or West, indus¬
trialized or developinghave an obvious
interest in more security and less defence
spending. And they are equally interested in
an improved capacity to tackle global
problems.
Children are still dying every minute be¬
cause they do not have enough food or
water, or because they lack basic medical
care. Over 500 million people throughout
the world still suffer from hunger. In these
circumstances, it is not much consolation to
be told by experts that at international level
food production has continued to increase.
On the contrary, it is all the more scanda¬
lous that such a vast number of people are
condemned to starve in a world that seems
obviously capable of providing enough food
for all. And who would deny today that
hunger and poverty could be more effective¬
ly overcome in large parts of the world if
some of the funds wasted on overarmament
could instead be used for productive and
humanitarian ends?
We possess relatively reliable estimates on
worldwide arms expenditure. In future
agreements on arms reductions, serious ef¬
forts should be made to use at least part of
the funds thus saved for economically, so¬
cially, ecologically and thus politically
useful purposes.
We are also aware of the external debt
burden that many developing countries are
suffering from. An increasing portion of
their export earnings has to be spent on
servicing foreign debts. For a number of
years now, the flow of funds from the South
to the North has been greater than in the
opposite direction.
Excessive arms spending has not made
peace any less precarious, and the desperate
position in which many developing coun¬
tries find themselves is certainly not an
adequate basis for future-oriented economic
and ecological decisions.
According to the findings of the World
Commission on Environment and Devel¬
opment (WCED) and of the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), human¬
ity is now able to bring about radical
changes on the planet Earth, which may
either take a destructive or a constructive
course.
The crisis observed in large parts of the
developing world is due to both worldwide
structural changes and to internal and ex¬
ternal mismanagement. The United Nations
Conference on Disarmament and Devel¬
opment held in 1987 also came to the con¬
clusion that disarmament, development and
security are interdependent.
Up to now there have been no sufficiently
high level talks on the interrelationship be¬
tween overarmament and underdevelop¬
ment. Instead, intergovernmental North-
South negotiations in a "multilateral"
framework have all but petered out. But

All those who see other peoples as neigh¬

put pressure on their governments to initiate
a process of systematic and future-oriented
negotiations. More specifically, I would like
to ask for your support in passing on a
message to all those who are currently in
government. The message is that they
should finally recognize that an objective
interrelationship exists between peace,
development and the protection of the
environment, and that they should act
accordingly.
This interdependence long unrecog¬
nized no longer be underrated.
There must be a growing realization that all
countries are linked by their common in¬
terest in survival and that solutions to our
problems will only be achieved by adopting
a far-sighted and global approach. Our
"mutual obligation" requires the adop¬
tion quickly as possibleof a new ethic
of human survival.

### 79197: Nuclear roulette; 'conventional' thinking on nuclear weapons is a recipe for mutual suicide
Nuclear roulette
'Conventional' thinking on nuclear weapons
is a recipe for mutual suicide
John C. Polanyi
-, m '
THE existence of nuclear weapons
has, so far, resulted in restraint in
the use of force on the part of the
nations that possess them. This may well
have prevented a war at some time during
the past four decades. Notwithstanding this,
recent history cannot be our guide in plan¬
ning for the future.
An international group of military, scien¬
tific and political figures who met in Toron¬
to a few years ago gave the reason: "Our
overall conclusion", they said, is "... that,
while the avoidance of nuclear war up to the
present time was a testimonial to good man¬
agement, it was a still greater testimonial to
good luck".
If it is true that we have been engaged in a
game of nuclear roulette, then we carry a
heavy burden of guilt. If, having come to
this realization, we persist in the same pol¬
icies, we lay ourselves open to the charge of
criminal folly.
All too often we have been closing our
eyes to the fact that we have entered a new
age, as differentprobably more differ¬
ent the preceding one than the Iron
Age was from the Stone Age.
In the 1950s it was acknowledged that the
delivery of a hundred nuclear weapons
against any nation would cause such suf¬
fering and such a rending of the social fabric
as to constitute an intolerable tragedy the
death of a civilization.
There followed from this the truism of
our times, namely that the only sane and
moral purpose for nuclear weapons was to
ensure that they should not be used: that is,
their purpose is for deterrence. The num¬
bers of deliverable weapons should, there¬
fore, be held to a few hundred.
This was the prevailing view at the first of
the Pugwash International Conferences on
Science and World Affairs that I attended,
twenty-seven years ago in Moscow.
The subsequent policies of the nuclear
powers spoke louder than our words at that
time, and differently. The numbers of nucle-

ar weapons were permitted to escalate into
the tens of thousands. Nations chose, it
would seem, to treat nuclear weapons con¬
ventionally, as instruments of war.
The essence of sanity is to recognize the
world for what it is. Our policies in regard
to nuclear weapons have repeatedly failed to
pass that test.
Let me give what appear to me to be three
clear examples of this failure. Between them
they cover the major areas for military
debate.
The first concerns what is referred to
rather loosely as the defence of Europe. It
should be evident, following military exer¬
cises repeated over decades, that Europe is
defended by what the American futurol-
ogist Herman Kahn once termed (in another
context) a Doomsday Machine.
Even after the extremely welcome mea¬
sures of disarmament now coming to frui¬
tion, the war-time task of a commander in a
European conflict will be to ready thou¬
sands of nuclear weapons for use without
inadvertently using them, and also without
giving the impression that they may be
about to be used, since that would invite
nuclear pre-emption by the opposing side.
This task would have to be carried out in a
conventional war in which beleaguered sub¬
ordinates were crying out for reinforce¬
ments, and in which nuclear weapons sites
were being disabled or overrun.
The task of holding nuclear forces in
check under such conditions gives every
evidence of being impossible. The task of
saving Europe from destruction once nucle¬
ar war has been engaged is almost certainly
impossible. Add these two propositions to¬
gether and it is apparent that we have opted
to defend ourselves and Europe by holding
a gun to our heads.
This is a consequence of treating nuclear
weapons conventionally.
A second, similar folly underlies the com¬
petition in intercontinental ballistic missiles.
These awesome and awful devices are com¬
monly thought of as being the embodiment
of deterrence, since they are so evidently too
terrible to use. Conventional thinking in
regard to these "weapons" is nonetheless
evident in the compulsion to match oppos-

### 79197: Nuclear roulette; 'conventional' thinking on nuclear weapons is a recipe for mutual suicide
ing systems with missiles of comparable
range, yield and numbers.
Such thinking is still more evident in the
competition for accuracy and multiplicity of
warheads seen in current debates over pro¬
curement. These weapons are sought after
for their ability to destroy the missile silos
on the opposing side. The opponent nat¬
urally and correctly supposes that the in¬
tention would be to destroy the silo before
rather than after the missile that it housed
was launched.
Far from deterring the enemy from using
his missiles, this threat provides him with a
strong incentive to use his missiles while he
still can.
The logic that leads to the development
and deployment of such weapons, on both
sides, involves a commitment to the conven¬
tional aim of warfare, namely, to emerge
victorious. The aim is sufficiently at var¬
iance with reality that it has been thought
advisable to recast it into the less readily
identified need to "prevail".
The aspect of deterrence that is most to be
feared is the temptation to extend it beyond
the restricted aim of deterring war, to that of
deterring an opponent from actions one
deplores. This constitutes "compellance",
not deterrence. It is, in the oft-quoted
phrase of the Prussian theorist of warfare
Karl von Clausewitz, "Diplomacy pursued
by other means". Deterrence is something
different. Neither Clausewitz nor anyone
else has suggested that mutual suicide serves
the purposes of diplomacy; it merely obvi¬
ates the need.
Finally, in this gallery of horrors, each a
product of conventional thinking in a trans¬
formed world, I include the recourse to
magic as a means of repealing the nuclear
age. I do not of course really mean magic,
but illusions achieved by the use of mirrors.
The mirrors in the current Strategic De¬
fence Initiative scenario will be lofted into
space within a minute of the warning being
received that the opposing side is launching
a missile attack. The function of the mirrors
will be to direct laser beams at the enemy
weapons as they rise from their silos thou¬
sands of kilometres away.
Why have the majority of the U.S. scien¬
tific community, possessed of relevant ex¬
pertise, expressed scepticism as to the tech¬
nical feasibility of the Strategic Defence
Initiative? The two most prominent reasons
are as follows. First, in order to provide
convincing protection against nuclear weap¬
ons, given their enormous destructive pow¬
ers, one needs a highly effective defence.
This is absurdly difficult to achieve. Second¬
ly, it should be evident that the same tech¬
nologies energy weapons, lasers,
X-rays, particle beams, and so forth that
lure us in the direction of developing so¬
phisticated defences, will be even more ef¬
fective in the simpler task of undermining
those defences.
Experts in the experimental sciences will
confirm that it is easier to mess up a highly
sophisticated experiment than it is to make
it work.
In what sense do antimissile defences rep¬
resent an outgrowth of conventional think¬
ing? By rendering intercontinental missiles
"obsolete", they seek to turn the clock back
to an era now firmly lodged in pre-history;
a time when we could settle our differences
by a vast blood-letting, secure in the knowl¬
edge that as a society or species we would
stop short of bleeding to death.
That can never be true again, since we
know now how to shatter civilizations, and
the knowledge will forever be with us. It is
understandable therefore that, as the French
sociologist Raymond Aron put it, the world
is increasingly one of "virile weapons and
impotent men". To vary the metaphor,
there is no winning move in the internation¬
al chess game as presently constituted. We
must have the courage to change the rules.
There is nothing new in that statement.
World leaders frequently make it. Their
problem is to act upon it. That requires not
only that they believe it, but, no less impor¬
tant, that they believe that others believe it.
That is why actions such as the making of
the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile (ABM) Trea¬
ty, that stand outside the previous pattern of
history, are of such critical importance. In
1972, with the signing of the ABM Treaty,
sworn enemies solemnly renounced their
defences. Not only did they admit that in
the nuclear age the emperor had no clothes,
they legislated for this nakedness and made
it the object of round-the-clock inspection.
The agreement on medium- and short-
range nuclear missiles in Europe is of almost
comparable importance, since it presents the
world with the spectacle of two great pow¬
ers with substantial unresolved differences
destroying a part of their weaponry on the
grounds that they are safer without it.
This is a lesson that will not be lost upon
the world. It is the right lesson, though an
incomplete one. At the outset of these re¬
marks I spoke of the overwhelming danger
that nuclear weapons would be used if a
nuclear power felt that its vital interests or
continued existence were threatened.
Even if one makes the implausible as¬
sumption that disarmament might proceed
to the point at which nuclear weapons cease
to have military significance, that overall
picture does not change. The route to esca¬
lation, in our world of abundant fissile ma¬
terial, will remain wide open. A hint that
one side might "go nuclear" would result in
a race to be the first to do so.
Copernicus waited until he was close to
death before declaring his belief that the
Earth is not, after all, at the centre of the
planetary system. He delayed out of fear.
Not fear of the wrath of the Church, but of
the more terrible prospect of being laughed
at by his colleagues. A similar fear prevents
many from saying what is evident today,
namely that the political constellation no
longer orbits around the hallowed concep¬
tion of nationhood.
Nations came into being when those who
were linked geographically banded together
for protection, spiritual sustenance and.mu¬
tual comfort. Today a nation can only offer
to protect its citizens by means that invite a
barbaric level of violence, likely to destroy
them physically or morally.
We cannot base international order on
such lethal behaviour. Means short of war
must be found to resolve national differ¬
ences. Before too long this must be done
within an organizational framework, one
that makes visible the need, facilitates the
process, and institutionalizes precedents for
compromise.
The attempt to make international beha¬
viour subject to agreed guidelines will de¬
pend ultimately on the demonstrated wil¬
lingness of nations to accept the rule of law
at home. A nation that claims absolute pow¬
er within its borders cannot be trusted to
relinquish it abroad. Similarly a nation that
is careless of the plight of those threatened
by starvation, or unconcerned about the
rape of the environment, is unlikely to carry
conviction in its renunciation of mass de¬
struction as an instrument of policy.
If the agenda before us is so daunting, it is
easy to despair. The risks in attempting to
achieve a new international order are indeed
formidable, being exceeded only by the
risks in not doing so. Rather than lamenting
human folly, we should count ourselves
fortunate that the force of reason is compell¬
ing us along the path towards a more civi¬
lized world.

### 79198: Sixteen conclusions
The Nobel Laureate Conference reached
the following sixteen conclusions:
1. All forms of life must be considered as
mankind's essential heritage. Destroying the
ecological balance is therefore a crime
against the future.
2. The human species is one, and each indi¬
vidual who belongs to this species has equal
rights to freedom, equality, and brother¬
hood.
3. Mankind's wealth also stems from its
diversity. This diversity must be protected
in all its aspects cultural, biological, philo¬
sophical, spiritual. To this end, the virtues
of tolerance, listening to others, and refus¬
ing- ultimate truths must be unendingly
reiterated.
4. The most important problems mankind is
faced with today are both universal and
interdependent.
5. Science is a form of power, and access to
science must be equitably shared among
individuals and peoples.
6. The gap that in many countries separates
the intellectual community from the politi¬
cal establishment must be bridged. It is a
matter of each acknowledging the role the
other plays.
7. Education must become the absolute pri¬
ority in all budgets and must help enhance
all aspects of human creativity.
8. Science and technology must be made
available to developing countries in partic¬
ular, to help them gain control over their
own future and define the knowledge they
deem necessary to their development.
9. Assuming television and new media are
an essential means of education for the fu¬
ture, education must contribute to the de¬
velopment of critical attitudes towards what
the media broadcast.
10. Education, food, and preventive health
care are essential tools for population pol¬
icies and the reduction of infant mortality.
In particular, the generalized use of existing
vaccines and the development of new vac¬
cines must be the common task of both
scientists and politicians.
11. Research into the prevention and treat¬
ment of AIDS must be pooled and encour¬
aged, rather than slowed down and overly
partitioned, in particular with the co-oper¬
ation of the pharmaceutical industry. Once
developed, the corresponding vaccine will
have to be endorsed by governments.
12. Molecular biology which has, through
its recent developments, given rise to new
hopes in the field of medical science and
helped determine the genetic dimension of
some diseases, must be encouraged in order
to help foresee and perhaps cure these dis¬
eases.
13. Disarmament will give economic and
social development significant impetus, be¬
cause of the limited resources of our planet,
presently drained by the arms industry.
14. We urge that an international conference
be held to deal with all aspects of Third
World debt, which hinders economic and
political development.
15. Governments must make unambiguous
and binding commitments to respect human
rights, as well as the treaties they have
ratified.
16. The Nobel Laureate Conference will
meet again in two years to consider these
problems. In the intervening time, whenev¬
er crises are perceived as requiring urgent
action, on-site visits will be made by a
number of Nobel laureates (can you imagine
five Nobel Prize winners in Bhopal or in
Chernobyl?) as they will to all places where
human rights are threatened.
