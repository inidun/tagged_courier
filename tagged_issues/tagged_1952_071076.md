FROM THE UNESCO
NEWSROOM
* France : Secondary schoolchildren in
Brest have just marked the first anni-
versary of their Unesco Club with a
celebration devoted to the principles of
international understanding. The chil-
dren presented a programme which
included Indian dances, Spanish music,
a Tchekov comedy, Breton folklore and
a Slav dance by Dvorak. Costumes,
decor and music were all provided by
club members. During the year, the
club organized lectures, cinema shows
and discussions on cultural subjects.
Meetings were arranged with similar
clubs in England during the Easter
holidays. This summer, the youngsters
plan to organize trips abroad and to
welcome schoolchildren from other
countries visiting Brest. Similar Unesco
groups are being set up elsewhere in
Brittany, at Morlaix and Quimper, and
in other French schools.
* Yugoslavia : An international camp
for young people from Austria, West
Germany, Switzerland, France, Great
Britain and the United States of Ame-
rica is to be held this summer on the
Dalmatian coast by the Yugoslav Young
Workers'Organization.
* Hawaii : Ten thousand Hawaiian
schoolchildren are sending letters to
their young Japanese colleagues as part
of a campaign for greater international
understanding. This letter-writing drive
is sponsored by the Hawaii Chapter and
Pacific Division of the World Bro-
therhood Organization. The letters are
being delivered by the president of the
World Brotherhood Week in Honolulu
during a goodwill tour of Japan.
* United Kingdom : The number of
students from various British colonies
studying in the United Kingdom has
increased from 300 in 1939 to 5, 154 at
present, according to the Earl of Mun-
ster, Under-Secretary at the Colonial
Office. About 1, 200 of the students hold
scholarships.
* Finland : For visitors to the Twenty-
fifth Olympiad in Helsinki this month,
the Finnish Government is providing an
international art exhibition of a unique
kind. Each country participating in the
games has been asked to send three
paintings, three scultpures and three
architectural models or drawings dealing
with sports.
* Yugoslavia : Thanks to scholarships
which the Yugoslav Government is giv-
ing to foreign students, 16 Africans
from trustee territories and ten Indians
will this year carry out their studies in
Yugoslavia.
* France : An International Centre of
Adult Education has been established in
France by Unesco at the Chateau de la
Breviere in the Compiegne Forest on the
outskirts of Paris. On June 14 it began
a series of international seminars and
courses on the development of workers'
education. Several hundred experts
from many different countries are
exchanging information and comparing
experiences and views on methods of
improving teaching methods.
* Turkey : An educational film centre
has been established in Turkey through
the operation of Unesco with the Tur-
kish authorities. The production of
educational films has been started with
the help of the Austrian specialist Pro-
fessor Adolf Hubl, and the technician
Walther Stoitzner. In addition to shar-
ing other costs, Unesco granted two
short-term fellowships to Turkish film
workers for study in Austria with Pro-
fessor Hubl.
* International : Twenty-five Dutch
workers, members of the Netherlands
Union of Building and Wood Workers,
have gone from the Lowlands to the
Alps to study building projects in
Switzerland as guests of the Swiss
Christian Feci'eratio'J1 of Building Work-
ers. This follows a similar study of
building and housing conditions made
by Swiss trade unionists in the Nether-
lands. In each case, the travelling
workers enjoyed the hospitality of the
respective unions at Utrecht (Nether-
lands), and Lungern (Switzerland), and
shared in the home life of their hosts.
This exchange was one of 42 which had
been arranged under Unesco's plan for
group travel grants.
* EI Salvador has decided to reduce
by half the postage rates on all Sal-
vador publications mailed abroad :
This includes books, printed music,
newspapers and magazines. The go-
vernment has also expressed its readi-
ness to adhere to the Paris international
postal agreement which authorizes the
payment on delivery of suõscriptions to
all publications.
* International : A popular science
exhibition on plastics, new metals and
other synthetic materials was organized
by Unesco in Paris last month, prior to
its departure for Yugoslavia in October.
This is the third science travelling exhi-
bition arranged by Unesco in the past
year. The first on physics and astro-
nomy has been touring Latin America
and has already been seen by over
600, 000 people in six countries. It is
now in Venezuela. The second exhibi-
tion"Our Senses and Knowledge of the
World has been on tour in nine
South-East Asian countries since
November.
* France : A cortege transported the
remains of Louis Braille to the Panthéon
in Paris on June 22. Louis Braille, who
died 100 years ago, devised a system
whereby the blind could read, and
France is honouring hin by placing his
body in the resting place for the
country's great. The work that Braille
started is continuing around the world,
especially under the auspices of the
Unesco-sponsored Consultative Com-
mittee to the World Braille Council.
* Western Germany : The owner of a
news-stand at the Cologne railway
station has organized literary discussions
every Wednesday among passengers
waiting for their train. After a difficult
start, his venture is attracting much
attention. Literary personalities take
part in these discussions whose purpose
is to make German literature a question
of general public concern.
* InternationaJ : The Kalinga interna-
tional annual prize for the best work in
the field of popularization of science has
been awarded to Prince Louis de Broglie
by Mr. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, in a ceremony at
Unesco House, Paris. The world-famous
French scientist, who won the Nobel
Prize in 1929, was chosen as the first
recipient of the Kalinga grant of one
thousand pounds sterling for his out-
standing contributions to popular inter-
pretation of science. The ceremony
took place in the presence of Mr. M. B.
Patnaik, a leading Indian industrialist,
who established the award last year
under the auspices of Unesco as a means
of focussing attention on the need for
greater understanding and broader use
of science for human welfare.
* India. : The application of the tradi-
tional arts and crafts of Rajasthan (In-
dia) to the various industrial needs of
today is being studied by the Indian
Institute of Art and Industry. As part of
its campaign to fight the deterioration
or extinction of craftsmanship, the In-
stitute plans to prepare a complete dic-
tionary of Indian designs and an ency-
clopedia of certain Indian crafts.
* Denmark : A Danish library has
extended its service to include the lend-
ing of reproductions of paintings by the
great masters. A borrower, who belongs
to the library, can on the presentation
of his ordinary card take home and keep
for four weeks copies of works by the
greatest of modern and classic artists.
COUNT STEFANO JACINI
Senator Count Stefano Jacini, a
member of the Executive Board of
Unesco, died in Milan, the city of his
birth, on May 31 at the age of 65.
He had been a member since 1948,
was chairman from 1950-51 and in
1950 was elected president of
Unesco's fifth General Conference
held in Florence. He was well-known
in many countries as a historian,
writer, statesman and organizer of
humanitarian work. In Unesco he was
a stout defender of international aid
for writers and artists and of granting
larger numbers of fellowships for
them. Emigration problems interested
him particularly, and for 20 years he
toured Europe to organize aid for
Italian emigrants. He was a recogniz-
ed authority on the Italian Renais-
sance and wrote a seven-volume
history on this period. In a tribute to
his life's work, Professor Paulo
Carneiro, chairman of the Unesco
Executive Board, recalled Count
Jacini's"many years of political and
intellectual activity on behalf of
international ideals"and the loss that
his death would mean to Unesco and
internotionohsm.
THE bazaars of Baghdad on ahot summer day are not as
romantic as some of us may
have been led to think. There is
colour enough, it is true. Vendors
move leisurely about selling their
gay and exotic wares. The costumes
and the strange music weave much
the kind of spell the average tourist
expects. But it is really poor stuff
compared to the glory and glamour
which once belonged to this part of
the world.
For in its heyday, this region
was the centre of a great civilization
and power. Some 70 miles to the
south lay the ancient city of
Babylon, with its magnificent imper-
ial palace, its priceless art treasures
and the famous Hanging Gardens
said to have been one of the Seven
Wonders of the World. Somewhere
to the south of here, too, is reputed
to have been the Garden of Eden-
the cradle of mankind.
Once, the whole region between
the Tigris and Euphrates was rich,
green and productive. A system of
canals carried water wherever it
was needed. At the height of its
glory, Babylon was even called the
"granary of the world". But there
is little evidence of it now.
Today the canals are gone-
broken, destroyed and buried
beneath the advancing sands. The
rich alluvial soil has drifted away,
carried off by the hot winds blowing
up from the Persian Gulf and by
every other wind that blows. Now
the desert presses in on all sides.
There is nothing unusual about
this. The same story could be told

in Syria, which holds some of the
grandest ruins of the ancient world
such as Baalbeck and the graveyard
of a"Hundred Dead Cities", an
area of about 1, 000, 000 acres lying
between Aleppo, Antioch and Hama.
It could be told in the Lebanon,
where the Forests of the Cedars
retreated before axe, fire, hoe and
the voracious black-eared goat, until
today only a few remnants of the
famous extensive forest are left.
The same story could be told in
Egypt and indeed wall over the
Middle East, in India, in China, in
North Africa and in the New World.
It happens everywhere that men
take from the soil and fail to replace
the vegetation that binds the soil,
or where the water is allowed to
rush indisciplined across the land.
As Dr. W. C. Lowdermilk, land
erosion consultant of the U. N. Food
and Agriculture Organization has
said, the problem is not so much one
of conquest of natural deserts as of
reconquest of man-made deserts
that have resulted from neglect and
misuse, where"the recklessness,
ignorance and hunger-drive of man
have supplemented the process of
wind and water erosion in destroy-
ing vegetation and soils, resulting
ill regional suicide."
"Mankind has strode across the
face of the earth for 7, 000 years,"
Dr. Lowdermilk adds,"reaping
where he has not planted and
destroying what he has not made.
In occupying new lands one after
the other, one section of mankind
has looted his fellows and'skimmed
off the cream'and left thin milk for
generations that follow. Man has
tended to destroy the sources of his
existence."
Thus, ancient Cyrenaica used to
produce three harvests a year ;
today it is largely unproductive, In
Australia, the semi-desert areas
are creeping forward and engulfing
the good land because of the
overstocking of cattle and deforesta-
tion. Every year, rivers in South
Africa and Latin America carry
millions of tons of top-soil into the
sea ; one can actually watch the
soil being carried away. Through
careless exploitation in the past,
vast areas of formerly good land
in the United States have become
unproductive"dust bowls". In
South Africa, the situation is
critical because of the merciless
exploitation by farmers and land-
owners. And according to conserva-
tion authorities, a national catas-
trophe due to soil erosion is perhaps
more imminent in South Africa
than in any other country.
Today more countries in the world
are confronted with problems caused
by aridity than by any other
characteristic of climate. It is
estimated that the arid and semi-
arid regions of the world make up
more than a quarter of the land
surface of the globe. There are
the extreme instances-like the
Central Sahara or Libyan deserts,
the Takla Makan in northwest
China, or the Rub'Al Khali in Saudi
Arabia-where practically nothing
grows and where a few nomads
survive under the most primitive
conditions. Only radical scientific
discoveries may some day make
these areas productive to man.
But fringing these deserts are
semi-arid areas which, except for
short rainy periods each year, are
dry as dust. They support a heavy
population whose people live only by
the most careful use of the water
and sources of power available.
Because of the enormous pressure
of increasing population, it is more
urgent than ever before that
the unproductive lands should be
brought back into the service of
mankind.
It is the same problem which
inspired the prophet to say :"In
the wilderness shall waters break
out, and streams in the desert. And
the glowing sands shall become a
pool, and the thirsty land springs of
water ; in the habitation of jackals
where they lay shall be grass with
reeds and rushes. And a highway
shall be there..."
The ancient prophets were the
wise men of their time. They kept
an eye on the community and it was
their business to see that provision
was made for the welfare of
future generations. They may have
lacked the scientific knowledge of
our days but they had judgment and
wisdom.
And now in the 20th century, the
call has gone out again to bring
water to the thirsty ground. For
at a time in history when popula-
tions are increasing at the rate of
some 55, 000 a day, civilization is
running a race against time and
famine.
The call is being answered,
however, with all the resources of
scientific knowledge and engineer-
ing. Governments in many coun-
tries are giving the problem
high priority. But unrelated local
attempts to wrest production from
the dry lands cannot be expected to
achieve the best results. This is a
case, if ever there was one,
for international co-operation and
exchange of experience.
At the General Conference of
Unesco at Beirut in 1948, the Indian
delegation put forward a proposal
which led Unesco to set up an
advisory research committee to
guide Unesco's arid zone pro-
gramme. This committee consists
of nine scientists from Australia,
Egypt, France, Great Britain, India,
Israel, Mexico, Peru and the U. A.
The committee saw two major
difficulties today impeding the world
struggle to make the lands of the
arid zones productive : lack of in-
formation on what is being done,
and insufficient research on the in-
ternational level. Unesco therefore
set itself two objectives :
First, to seek out and make
available all the experience and
expert knowledge gained from the
many experiments and projects
carried out in many parts of the
world.
Second, to help the development
and expansion of desert research
stations, so that they would devote
time and study to certain problems
affecting several countries at least.
Each year, Unesco selects a par-
ticular field of research for study.
The first field chosen, in 1951, was
water-the one problem common

THE MYTH ABOUT THE TROPICS
O ! \LY horses sweat : gentlemenper per·pire and ladies glow.
There can never be product-
iw life in the Tropics
until humanity emulates the
horse. Bv all scientific indica-
tions man is a tronical animal.
Physiological tests have hitherto
failed to show that the black man
is any more suited to life in the
heat than the white, yet the myth
that the Tropics are no place for
a white man and that sojourn
there saps the mental and phy-
sical energy of men from temper-
ate climates still remains. In
defiance of that myth, however,
Queensland has been success-
fullv settled and there are many
prosperous parts in the southern
States of America which would
he rated as"tropical"from their
climates were they anywhere else.
The term"tropical"has come to
have a psychological rather than
a geographical or climatic mean-
ing : do people complain more of
Tropical Fatigue in Rio de Janeir,)
than they do in Bahrein ? They
ought to, if such a thing existed,
as Rio is withi. n the Tropics and
Bahrein outside.
Human laziness is responsible
for this myth. Man, like other
animals, produces heat as he lives
and the harder he works the more
heat he produces. In warm cli-
mates the body's problem is to get
rid of this metabolic heat. To
do so, the superficial tissues warm
up to the internal temperature of
the body and blood flows into the
skin'so that it becomes flushed
and hot. This hot skin radiates
heat to cooler surroundings and
nooler air moving over the skin
takes up heat from it.
The heat loss by these two
routes is adequate at first, but it
becomes more difficult as the
temperature rises until at 88° F.,
only if a man is naked and in-
active can he get rid of his meta-
bolic heat ; if it gets warmer his
temperature rises and the third
mechanism for heat loss, the
evaporation of sweat, becomes
important. The sweat glands. begin
to produce sweat and as this
evaporates from the'skin it takes
up the heat that could not be got
rid of by convection and radiation.
by Dr. W. S. S. LADELL
Anything impeding heat loss
bv these two routes will reduce
the temperature at which the
sweating mechanism comes into
play ; for example, a poor flow of
air over the skin, or, of course,
clothing. Similarly an increase in
the total amount of heat to be lost
win necessitate sweating sooner ;
this extra heat may be from
working muscles-twice as much
heat is produced when strolling
at two m. p. h. as when sitting
quietly-or it may be acquired
externally, as by standing in the
sun when the heat gained from
solar radiation may be more than
that produced by walking at
4 m. p. h.
However, by suitable clothing,
by keeping out of the sun and in
the breeze, and by not putting up
heat production by working, a man
can usuat) y avoid sweaiing, but for
1 productive) life in the Tropics
a man must be willing to sweat ;
in vast areas of the world there
is poor nutrition caused in part at
least by man's temperamental
unwillingness to do so. The same
physiologically induced laziness
leads to economic difficulties and
to dirt and disease and a vicious
circle is set up. It is dirt, disease
and malnutrition that kills in the
Tropics, not the climate.
Man's cooling system involves
two d'stint physiological func-
tions. The first concerns the
heart and the blood flow through
the skin bringing the metabolic
heat to the surface, and the other
the production of sweat, the eva-
poration of which removes heat.
Tests show that a temper-
ate climate man reacts badly to
work in heat when he is first
tried out ; the opening up of blood
vessels in the'skin drains blood
from other parts so that his heart
begins to race and he may vomit
or faint ; sweating is low in start-
ing and not profuse. But with
training the body compensates for
the extra blood vessels to be fined
by increasing the amount of blood,
so that those dangers pass ; then
he begins to sweat sooner and
more freely, and thus becomes
"acclimatized to heat". Tests on
tropical men. both in Asia and
Africa, have shO\vn,. surprisingly,
that the-se men react more like
untrained temperate climate men
than like"fully acclimatized"in-
dividua) s, and with training they
show the'same changes.
This is because indigenous
tropical man rarely works hard in
the heat ; he prefers to take life
quietly, to move slowly and take
no exercise, and to catnap fre-
quently ; he avoids sweating and
keeps his agricultural activities to
the minimum, living when possible
as Adam did in Eden. The immi-
grant to the Tropics, however, who
works hard and plays hard be-
comes nearly completely acclima-
tized, and-thus the paradox that
he is better able to work in the
heat than the locally-born.
But then all around him the
immigrant sees the indigenous
man cultivating inactivity, sleep-
ing when he can and avoiding
hard physical work. Surely, the
immigrant asks himself, the local
inhabitant must know best ; so he
too begins to work short hours,
and to take a long midday sleep
from which he arises confused
rather than refreshed to restart
his broken day.
When a man sweats he loses
water which must be replaced.
Physiologically it is best to drink
as one sweats, but drinking when
at work is often frowned upon ; so
by evening men have substantial
water deficits. Pure water is dull
stuff, so the tendency is to make
good the deficiency with more
interesting alcoholic drinks ;
compatriots and friends gather
together to exchange news and
gossip ; nostalgia stimulates more
drinking : so insidiously an immi-
grant community becomes mildly
but chronically alcoholic and thus
develops"Tropical Neurasthenia".
Possibly the best tropical settlers
are the Moslems who are for-
bidden by their religion to touch
alcohol. But prohibition is not
necessary, merely the recognition
that to drink water as one sweats
is natural and desirable, a sign
not of weakness, but, of good sense.
The salt tosses in the sweat
must also be made good, otherwise
grave disorders will result. Man
needs half-an-ounce of common
salt per day and even more in very
hot climates or with strenuous
work. Part of tropical man's
unwillingness to sweat may pos-
sibly be an expression of a salt
lack or a recognition of the diffi-
culty of replacing salt.
Improved living and working
conditions, with or without air-
conditioning, will help to reduce
the heat load, but the settler
cannot avoid the heat of the air.
Sweat is only praiseworthy when
it is the outcome of useful effort ;
so tractors should be fitted with
canopies, and hats should be wide-
brimmed enough to shade the
whole body from the sun.
The way to productive life in the
Tropics is the same as anywhere
else : eschew sloth. A tropical com-
munity must be prepared to work
as hard as it would do in a tem-
perate climate and no. t be frighten-
ed of the heat ; by hard work food
production can be increased and
indigenous diseases eradicated.
Tropical men must be t1\ugllt
that they are not like cattle who
cannot sweat well and have to rest
for half the day to prevent being
overheated, even at the risk of
starving themselves ; men are born
with sweat glands so that they
may safely work in the heat. The
brunt of the day's work. must be
done before taking a nap. Let
communities in these areas deve-
lop into fully integrated societies,
where isolation and boredom are
no longer the lot of every man
when his day', s work is done, and
separation from wife and family
the rule rather than the. exception
for the immigrant.
Recreation must be provided,
so that alcohol can revert to
its correct role from being a uni-
versal hobby to a useful social
lubricant. With a real home life
and the development of cultural
facilities the brain worker too can
play his part. But the key above
all is the willingness to sweat, and
only when much sweat has flowed
will a community be able to afford
such extravagant luxuries as
improving its local climate by air-
conditioning...
PUSHING BACK THE FRONTIERS OF THE DESERT
(Continued from"revious"age.)
to all arid and semi-arid areas.
Hydrology concerns itself with both
water on the earth and below it,
but less is known about underground
water resources than surface water.
Scientists do know that there are
vast seas of underground water in
almost all areas of the world
including deserts, but much is
still to be done on studying these
resources.
Unesco therefore commissioned
eight scientists to study and report
on current research on this subject.
Last April, an international sympos-
ium of scientists met at Ankara,
Turkey, to discuss their findings.
The results will provide research
workers with the first comprehen-
sive picture of what is being done
to find out how underground water
behaves, and the possibilities of
using it effectively in arid zones.
But water is not the only problem
or the only answer for the parched
lands of our planet."The signi-
ficant characteristic of the arid
zone,"said the Indian delegate at
Unesco's Beirut Conference in 1948,
"is that it is constantly expanding
and is sterilizing the adjacent fertile
and cultivable areas at a consider-
able pace."The search for improv-
ed plant species for agriculture to
halt the world's marching sands is
one of the most important problems.
That is why Unesco has chosen
plant ecology-the relation of
plants to their environment-as
the special arid zone research theme
for this year. A group of ten plant
ecologists are surveying this ques-
tion and assembling experimental
and research data on promising
species and strains which thrive
under dry conditions in one area
and which may be profitably
introduced into others.
Australia offers an interesting
example of the introduction of
plants native to other areas.
Dr. B. T. Dickson, plant physiologist
from that country, pointed this out
at a symposium on desert research
held in Jerusalem last May under
the auspices of the Research Council
of Israel, in co-operation with
Unesco. He made the following
revealing statement :"Every cereal,
vegetable and fruit crop now grown
has been introduced, none is
indigenous. So too have been many
pasture grasses and legumes, parti-
cularly for better rainfall areas.
"One may hear joking reference
to the need to find pasture plants
which will remain green all the
year round without water, and
which can be sown from a saddle
bag and can establish themselves
readily. The point is that new
plants, to have a bare chance of
establishment, must be in equili-
brium with the environment, in
other words, immigrants capable of
ready naturalization. To expect
more is to end in frustration."
Unesco is also interested in
research projects for developing
sources of power in arid zones by
utilizing wind and solar energy, and
will probably study this question
fully next year.
The U. N. expanded technical
assistance programme for economic
development has provided a large
number of missions directly
concerned with the development of
the arid zone. In the arid Marbial
Valley of Haiti, the World Health
Organization and the Food and
Agriculture Organization have
joined Unesco in demonstrating
how to improve agricultural and
health methods, avoid erosion and
care for the soil. In Libya, a joint
FAO-Unesco mission is studying
plans for the expansion of the Sidi
Mesri arid zone research station.
The FAO is now engaged in a
gigantic international battle with
desert locusts. The most dangerous
plague of desert locusts for more
than a century has attacked crops
from the Nile Delta to India, 1
threatening to destroy the whole
food supply of half-a-dozen agricul-
tural countries. The locusts have
made a single feeding ground out
of extensive areas in French
Somaliland, Eritrea, the Sudan,
Aden, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Iraq,
Iran and Pakistan.
To meet this threat, international
action has been organized on a scale
unprecedented in peacetime, the
FAO reports. From Turkey, Syria,
Lbanon, Irak, Saudi Arabia and
Egypt aid has come to help save the
crops of Jordan, one of the most'seriously infested lands. India,
Pakistan, U. S. A. and U. S. S. R. have
sent insecticides and equipment to
Iran where more than 200, 000, 000
acres are infested with desert locust
eggs.
Reports reach Unesco from all
corners of the earth telling of
national governments sponsoring
projects to save or reclaim their land.
In Cyprus, large-scale erosion has
been checked by destroying herds of
wild goats and planting trees on the
steep hillsides. Turkey is establish-
ing an institute of hydrology and
geology which will organize research
and teaching on problems of the use
of underground water for its semi-
arid central region.
Research work on the arid regions
and research stations are being
strengthened in places as far distant
as India and Chile, Australia and the
Sahara desert. Eight of these have
now been linked up directly with
Unesco's programe of research de-
velopment. They are in Algeria,
Egypt, French West Africa, India,
Israel and the United States. In
addition to co-ordinating their re-
search with Unesco, these centres
will accept visiting scientists and
fellowship holders in arid zone ques-
tions. By also exchanging their
scientists and technicians with other
institutions carrying out related
work, they will become the nucleus
of the first team of internationally-
trained arid zone specialists.
By the sharing of engineers and
scientific knowledge on an interna-
tional scale, all nations have a chance
of turning a world of want into a
world of plenty. For all nations are
interdependent in the fight for food
and life.

SANDS :
"IT
A report
by Ritchie CALDER
U. N. photographs by Eric Schwab
At Kotri, the massive ramparts of the barrage
being built across the Indus River are rising
out of the drab, tawny desert of the Sind.
Water from the completed barrage will fertilize
a vast desert area and make practicable the
construction of a model city for 100, 000 people.
FAR out in the desert is the Lower SindBarrage, which is being built across the wide,
sluggish Indus.
Standing on top of the massive masonry of one
of the spans, we looked out on a depressing land-
scape. Stretching to the horizon was the drab,
tawny desert, dead flat except for a few low, table-
topped hills, and with practically no vegetation
apart from clumps of camel-thorn and a few stunted
trees. The Indus itself Was at low water, just
branching streams crawling round massive sand-
banks.
It took a lot of imagination to see this as a land
of flourishing farms and well-cropped fields. We
just had to take the word of the experts that one
day it would be so. After all, most of what is now
West Pakistan, including the Punjab, the Land of
the Five Rivers, was once desert just like this.
The rivers flowed through the Thirstland, with-
out slaking its thirst. Then in the past century,
great irrigation schemes farther up the Indus-
like the Sukkur Barrage, the world's biggest-
watered the desert and it blossomed.
That is what can happen to the Lower Sind desert
when this barrage at Kotri is completed. It is a
government enterprise using direct labour. It has
the services of British engineers, but they are
employed directly by Pakistan.
The Pakistani engineers are very proud of the
fact that, breaking with a tradition which used
abundant cheap manual labour, they have brought
in the latest modern equipment for barrage
construction. They took a pride in showing us, for
example, the giant shovel (its arm towers 200 feet
above the bed of the river), which scoops up tons
of earth at a bite-and which walks.
It is like a fantastic Disney cartoon. When it
moves, two enormous flippers lift the giant engine,
drop it belly-fist on the ground, lift it again and
keep moving forward, With a curious hopping
motion.
They showed us the crushers which break up the
sandstone rocks for mixing with cement in the
pumpcrete machine. This electrically-driven appa-
ratus forces the liquid concrete through pipes, like
squeezing tooth-paste out of a tube, and a couple
of men can direct the nozzle of this hose into the
masonry casings of the barrage.
But modern engineering has not abolished the
picturesque. Trains of donkeys with panniers pick
their way through the modern machines into the
more inaccessible parts of the operation.
The barrage will consist of 445 spans, compared
with the 665 spans of the Sukkur. Each span is
60 feet. It is being built in sections. A great earth-
work encloses each section, diverting the river and
forming an enormous caisson within which the
building goes on.
As each span is completed, a similar earthwork
protects the work on the next span. The first bund
is then broken and the river takes that channel.

AT WORK IN
THE DESERT
(Continued from previous page)
When is it completed, the barrage,
which is not a storage dam but a
gigantic weir, will divert the water
into irrigation canals on either side
of the Indus, and will generate elec-
tricity.
As a contribution to the develop-
ment which will follow the bringing
in of water to the desert of the Sind,
FAO has provided experts to help
with the careful soil-analysis and
soil-mapping. They will advise on
drainage and on underground water
This area has not only the dis-
advantage of being dry, but the soil
is salted. With enough water and
proper draining, it should be pos-
sible to leach or scour out the salt.
I went into one desert section of
10, 000 acres which will be watered
from the barrage, and which has
been mapped out and the soil
classified with the help of FAO.
Some of it was covered by a crust
of salt. The soil looked pretty un-
healthy to me, but Mr Le Vee, the
U. S. soil conservationist of FAO
assured me it was not.
To prove it, he took me down to
a pit dug in the desert, and showed
me a cross section of the soil. These
pits are desert"classrooms"for Pa-
kistan agriculturalists to learn how
to sample soil. In the middle of the
desolation was a market garden,
where a Sind farmer had used well
water to wash out the salt, and was
growing vegetables which would be
a gardener's pride.
But agriculture is only one aspect
of what will be possible in this area.
Between Kotri and Hyderabad (not
to be confused with the state and
city of that name in Central India)
they are planning a city of 100, 000
people. I suggested it ought to be
called"Unobad", because from the
outset it will be planned and deve-
loped with the help of Technical
Assistance experts.
Originally the scheme was to
provide homes for thousands of
Moslem refugees from India, most
of whom were craftsmen, traders
and artisans. But the Pakistan
Government decided instead to
make it a model city, which would
have a cross section of all classes,
professions, industries and interests.
They asked U. N. Technical As-
sistance to provide a social and a
town planner, who will both be
British.
In addition, the International
Labour Office is providing experts
who will help in the setting-up of
industries, organising labour ex-
changes, industrial relations and
co-operatives, and on technical
training.
The World Health Organization
and Unicef are to help on the
medical side, and Unesco has been
brought in on the educational.
FAO will play its part in seeing that
this new city has a proper relation-
ship with the agricultural develop-
ment of the area.
The city will be the embodiment

of Pakistan's belief in U. N. Tech-
nical Assistance. The U. N. technical
mission here is the biggest in the
world. It covers practically the
whole range of the country's in-
terests, from economic planning to
cottage industries.
Mr. Tom Hibben, * leader of the
mission, is economic adviser and
works with the Department of Eco-
nomic Planning, so that the pro-
gramme is related not only to the
vast possibilities, but to the imme-
diate needs and present capacities
of the country.
For instance, when one is told
that Unesco has supplied experts in
geodesy, terrestial magnetism, seis-
mology and atmospheric physics, it
may sound academic ; but geodesy
and terrestial magnetism are meant
for the training of Pakistanis to dis-
cover their still unknown natural
resources.
Baluchistan is in the earth-
quake belt, so they want to know
about seismology. West Pakistan is
an arid zone and depends for its
water on rivers which have their
sources outside the country. So
atmospheric physics means the study
of the possibilities of cloud precipi-
tation, oar'''artificial raindrop" (see

and radar systems and other as-
pects of air communications.
The World Health Organization
and Unicef are giving substantial
assistance on the medical side, parti-
cularly in the development of
mother-and-child health.
ILO is already in the field advis-
ing on the setting up of labour
exchanges and vocational training.
Pakistan needs a lot of trained
technicians quickly and wants to be
able to move workers to new centres
of development. That is only a be-
ginning. This year there will be
30 ILO experts in Pakistan.
FAO is not only helping with the
opening up of new lands, but with
animal disease and (most interest-
ing) deep sea fishing.
In East Pakistan, communication
is by water. Over 1, 000, 000, 000 tons
of goods a year are carried through
the Ganges Delta by boats of one
type or another. There are over
30, 000, 000 boats, and the government
has asked for technical advice on
the mechanization of craft for East
Pakistan.
They have also got international
experts to help with the develop-
ment of telephone exchanges. Com-
munications are poor, but they
are taking modern short cuts. They
are bringing in experts on ultra
high frequencies. A chain of U. H. F.
radio stations will be strung across
the country, providing radio tele-
phone links.
Another encouraging sign of
co-operation is the tying in of U. N.
experts with schemes. going forward
under the Colombo Plan.
Pakistan, after partition, found
itself desperately short of trained
experts. It fortunately has the help
of the United Nations in making
good that shortage.
Pakistani engineers constructing the barrage at Kotri have brought in the latest equipment for the job : giant mechanized
shovels, rock crushers and"pumpcrete"machines which mix the cement and force it into the masonry casings of the barrage.
What is an
Arid Zone ?
EXTIiE ; \IE ARID ZONE : An
area in which at least 12
consecutive months without
rainfall have been recorded,
and in which there is not a
regular seasonal rhythm of
rainfall. Aden, at the
southern end of the Red
Sea, Thamed near its nor-
thern end, and several
places along the Egyptian
coast of this sea are among
the zones which fully com-
ply with this rigorous defi-
nition. Hurghada, on the
west coast of the Red Sea,
had no rainfall during
four years of observations.
In the United States, a few
areas in the Colorado desert
and Death Valley also fulfil
these requirements. The
longest dry period recorded
in the U. S. was at Baghdad
(California), where during
the three-year period from
February 1917 to January
1920 the total rainfall
amounted to a tenth of an
inch. Over 23 years, Bagh-
dad's mean annual precipi-
tation was 2. 28ins.
ARID ZONE : From on agricul-
tural point of view, the arid
zones are those in which
the rainfall over a given
piece of land is not enough
for crop production.
SEMI-ARID ZONE : Rainfall is
sufficient for certain types
of crops, and grass is an
important element of the
natural vegetation, unless
overgrazing has replaced it
with brush.
PRECIPITATION : The essen-
tial characteristic of an arid
zone-and it is the one on
which all other things
depend-is its small rainfall.
There is no general rule'
indicating just how small
this must be to place a
climate in the desert or
steppe category. Taking a.
specific annual rainfall
(such as 13. 8ins as the
outer limit of the arid, or
29. 5ins as the outer limit of
the semi-arid) is often mis-
leading. A given amount
of rainfall which dries up
quickly is of less value to
plants than the same
amount which evaporates
more slowly and so can be
used by animals over a
longer period.
TEMPERATURE : The right
amount of heat, as well as
of water, is essential for the
growth and ripening of
plants. Thus perennial
plants are limited in distri-
bution by the coldness of
winter, and annuals by both
the cold season and the hot.
While the date flourishes in
even the hottest deserts, the
common European grains
such as wheat, rye and oats
will not germinate at tem-
peratures over about 85°F.
But it is not so much the
mean monthly temperature
that affects life as seasonal
extremes-and this applies
especially to the arid zones.
The map alongside there-
fore indicates the average
for the. coldest and warmest
months.

world's driest desert,
but paradoxically Chi-
le's greatest wealth. It
contains the only large
nitrate deposits (used
for fertilizers!) and
largest copper ore re-
serves in world. Rain
would dissolve nitrate.
DISTRIBUTION OF
ARID CLIMATES
FOR more than 2,000 years
scientists have been con-
cerned with the classific -
tion and world distribution of
climates. Of the many classi-
fications devised, the one that
has been used the most was de-
veloped in the fourth century
B. C. by Aristotle. His Meteoro-
logica divided the earth up
into five zones of latitude cor-
responding to three types of cli-
mate-tor id, temperate and fri-
gid-based n the different in-
clination of slant of the sun's
rays at dif nt latitudes. Our
word climate comes from the
Greek klimata, coined out of
the verb klinein, meaning
"to incline". Much later scien-
tists realized that latitude was
not he only basis for climate ;
that temperatur does not vary
only because of latitude, and
that such things as rainfall and
wind correspond even less to la-
titude. By 1879, climate special-
ist had broken away from the
ancient Greek concept, and in
1900 a German scientist, W. Kop-
pen, made the first attempt at a
modern map of world cli tes.
Since then, other factors ha
been discovered to be equally
important, such as the degree to
which rainfall is lost to the land
through evaporation.
When Unesco's arid zone pro-
gramme was set up, one of the
first things scientists needed
was an accurate, up-to-date
map of the world's dry climates.
Dr. Peveril Meigs, chairman of
the Arid Zone Committee of
the International Geographical
Union in Washington, was asked
to prepare it. Dr. Meigs's maps,
published on this and the fol-
lowing pages, are based on the
most recent information today
available and on the various
factors which are now studied in
connexion with aridity. They
represent the most accurate
world maps of the arid zones
available today. For this issue,
the maps have been slightly
simplified for the non-technical
reader, but their essential con-
tents remain unaltered.
Deserts have different degrees
of dryness. Terms such as arid,
desert, semi-arid, semi-desert,
and extreme desert are still used
in many ways by many autho-
rities. Mr. Meigs found it ne-
cessary, therefore, before deli-
miting the zones, to define the
terms he was going to use to
classify them.
On the opposite page are the
definitions used by Dr. Meigs for
his classification of extreme
arid, arid and semi-arid zones,
which are shown on the maps
as "E", "A" and "S". The dry
climates are shown to occur in
five great regions separated
from one another by oceans or
by wet equatorial zones. The
largest is the North Africa and
Eurasia dry province. The other
dry provinces are the North
American, the South African,
the Australian and the South
American. In each of these a
core of desert, partly surround-
ed by semi-arid lands, borders
the west coasts of the contin-
ents and extends inland and
toward the pole.
It is interesting to note that
narrow strips of coastal desert
border all five of the world's
dry regions. The west coastal
desert-widely found in North
and South Africa, North and
South America and Australia-
is cool for its latitude, and in
many areas is marked by fre-
quent fogs from the sea. The
east coast type, along the Red
Sea, Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf
and Gulf of Oman, has very
high humidities along with in-
tense heat.
The Unesco maps are very im-
portant for the fight against the

desert. First they show the lands involved in the
"arid zone"and at the same time suggest some of
the principal differences and similarities between
different parts of the zone. Here is an example of
how a scientist can use them.
Suppose an arid zone specialist wants to know
what results other areas with a similar environment
have had with certain new plants or with different
methods of land development. He can find on the
maps the other localities of êhe world which have
broadly similar climates. Having narrowed down
his search to areas of general similarity, he can
then, if he wishes, look into the climatic records of
the individual regions for more details of tempera-
ture and rainfall, as well as, other factors such as
winds, clouds and humidity.
For instance, a scientist in northern Venezuela
finds his climate is classified as Sb33. Looking over
the map, he sees there are similar rainfall and
temperature areas in North-East Brazil, a corner of
Ecuador, North Yucatan, near Dakar, parts of East
Africa, and North-East Australia. If further detail-
ed investigations showed these areas to be similar
in other respects too, he could safely introduce the
same or similar plants or animals bred in those
regions with success.
The Unesco map, while useful for general world-
wide comparisons, cannot show the numerous local
variations of climate, particularly in mountainous
areas where climate differs greatly in short dis-
tances. More detailed local maps are still urgently
needed on such factors as humidity, cloud, fog,
wind intensity and solar radiation, in order to add
to science's knowledge of the climate resources of
the arid zones.
According to a list prepared by the International
Geographical Union and revised by the Unesco Ad-
visory Committee on Arid Zone Research, the fol-
lowing countries have arid and semi-arid areas.
Groups I and II list countries in which extreme arid
and arid land together comprise more than one-
third of the total land area (semi-arid not being
taken into account). Groups III, IV and V con-
tain countries in which extreme arid and arid land
together comprise less than one-third of total area
and in which semi-arid land has also been taken
into account. Countries are grouped in descending
order of magnitude of percentages :
I.-Extreme arid and arid totalling 67 per cent
or more : Spanish North Africa, Egypt, Libya, Aden,
Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan,
French North Africa, Iraq, Jordan.
II.-Extreme arid and arid totalling from 33 to
66 per cent : Somaliland, Iran, Israel, French West
Africa, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, South-West Africa,
Afghanistan, Eritrea, Australia, Chile.
III.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
33 per cent or more : Syria, Bechuanaland, Ethio-
pia, Kenya, Mongolia, Union of South Africa, Ar-
gentina, Mexico, French Equatorial Africa, India,
China, Turkey, United States.
IV.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
from ten to 33 per cent : Spain, Bolivia, Nigeria,
Angola, Tanganyika, U. S. S. R., Madagascar, Peru,
Mozambique.
V.-Extreme arid, arid and semi-arid totalling
less than ten per cent : Southern Rhodesia, Brazil,
Cameroons, Canada, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Domi-
nican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Venezuela.

, From northern Africa across the Middle East
to India, Pakistan and Mongolia stretches a
dry belt larger than all the other dry areas of
the world combined, The great Sahara is the
world's largest single desert. It is made
up not only of the extremely arid stretches
where practically nothing grows but also of
arid areas which have some vegetation and
animal life. To the south is the semi-arid
tropical belt of the Sudanese Sahel. The east
African offshoot includes the intensely hot
"horn"area where Lugh Ferrandi, in Italian
Somaliland, has the highest mean annual tem-
perature of any weather station in the world.

IThe map shows that most the Middle East is
extremely arid or arid. The Mediterranean
coastal area and Iran are characterized by mild
or cool winters while northward and eastward
are the vast deserts and steppes of U. S. S. R.,
Chinese Turkistan and Mongolia with sub-
freezing winters and warm or hot summers.
) The South African dry area consists chiefly ofthe narrow elongated coastal desert of the
Namib in South-West Africa and Loanda in
Portuguese Angola, as well as the Karroo and
Kalahari deserts. Two other dry areas, often
omitted from world climatic maps, are found
in Madagascar and Mozambique. Dry cli-
mates with cold winters are not represented
in any of the continents south of the equator.
IThe entire island continent of Australia, com-
prising just under three million square miles,
is dry except for small fringes along the coast.
The central one-third of the nation has less
than ten inches of rain a year and only the
peripheral zone (a quarter of the total area)
has sufficient rain to grow crops. The semi-
arid zone in between is a great grazing area.

FRESH WATER
FROM THE SEA
By Maurice GOLDSMITH
THE Dutch people have a great problem. The saltcontent in the water coming from their rivers and
underground is increasing. This is causing diffi-
culties in agriculture, horticulture and in the home.
For the past few years, scientific workers in the Nether-
lands have been engaged in research to find an economic
method of taking the salt out of sea water.
But this problem is not peculiar to the Netherlands. Nor
is it the only problem about supplies of water. As indus-
trialization develops and the standard of living for many of
the underprivileged rises, so the demands for more fresh
water will grow. But the supply is definitely limited.
Many methods have been used over the centuries to
increase water supplies. Water works have ranged from
well-drilling and cistern-building to the diversion of large
rivers, and the construction of vast storage dams. Today,
many million acres of otherwise uncultivable land are being
irrigated, and furnish, especially in Asia, the principal food
supplies for millions of families.
But these methods are concerned basically with ensuring
a better use of existing resources. What is urgently needed
is a regular supply of good water from new sources. That
is why eyes are turned longingly to our greatest natural
water hole-the sea around us.
If we can cause the sea to yield fresh water at our
demand, then we shall be able to transform the barren
lands Into productive areas for man.
Distillation is the most ancient method of obtaining fresh
water from the sea. Aristotle noted that pure water can
be obtained by evaporating sea water ; and St. Basil, in his
fourth homily on Genesis, commented :"Saitors, too, boil
even sea water, collecting. the vapour in sponges, to quench
their thirst in pressing need."
During the last century, although distilling apparatus
became comparatively more efficient, it was installed pri-
marily on ships and at naval bases. One at Aden, for
example, was the main source of supply of domestic water
until the completion of 0 deep well in 1927.
The process is howewer too costly to use for domestic
supply ao town dwellers.
An advanced technique developed in recent years is that
of distilling fresh water by compressing steam. It consists
in heating water to produce steam, which is then mecha-
nically compressed. This causes the temperature of the
steam to. be raised, and raises the temperature at which it
condenses into water. The heat produced is used to eva-
porate more water.
As long as the pressure is maintained, the process is
continuous. The fuel that is used is not needed to heat the
water, but to maintain the pressure.
This process of vapour compression distillation was tried
out on a large scale during the second world war. Over
1, 000, 000 men were supplied with fresh water from sea
water on islands in the Pacific. Stills with capacities of
1, 000 gallons a day are now manufactured for the process,
and one with a daily capacity of 50, 000 gallons is being
made for use in Bermuda.
At Kuwait, on the Persian Gulf, a plant with a capacity
of many thousand gallons a day supplies practically all
the drinking water for this developing oil centre. This
process, however, is basically for use in an emergency,
where it is cheaper to make fresh water from sea water than
transport the fresh.
The late President Roosevelt was fascinated by the bri-
quettes that were used during the last war by shipwrecked
or airwrecked servicemen. These briquettes contained
chemicals which could turn sea water into something
immediately drinkable.
The basis for this is a method known as ion exchange.
It is this process which is used to soften ordinary water and
to purify the water entering into the home. The term ion
exchange describes exactly what happens in the process.
tons are atoms, single or in groups, that carry an electric
charge. When salts are dissolved in water, they break up
into ions. It is possible to take one kind of ion out of the
solution and to replace it by another kind. In this way, for
example, salt can be removed completely from a solution.
But to do this on a large scale has been prohibitively
expensive.
Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel claim that
they have perfected an inexpensive method of purifying the
underground brackish waters by using an adaptation of this
chemical approach.
What is stated to be a significant advance in the use
of this process is the technique developed by Dr. Walter
Juda, of the Harvard Medical School, and his associates.
He uses special ion exchange materials. These are manu-
factured in the form of membranes, and are continuous
films of inexpensive synthetic plastics, less than forty-thou-
sandths of an inch thick. They are made largely of
cheap coal-tar and petroleum chemicals. The process is
simple because there are no moving parts, no artificial heat,
and no chemicals except the natural salt.
When a stream of water is fed to a unit using the mem-
branes, it emerges in two forms-a fresh-water stream made
up of two-thirds of the original stream and containing
practically none of the salt ; and a. brine stream, containing
the salt and other chemicals :
The fresh water may be used in the home, in industry, and
in agriculture. The brine stream may be further treated to
yield salt, magnesium or other chemicals obtained from
sea water.
This technique is still in the experimental stage, but if
it fulfils its developmental possibilities it will prove of high
significance in the revitalization of the arid zones.

COAXING RAN OUT OF
THE CLOUDS
By Dr. Gerald WENDT
To cox from a cloud the rain that greens the fields
and gives man food was in earlier days a task
for holy men, because the clouds were beyond
man's reach and could only be touched by divine aid.
But the aeroplane has now scaled the clouds and
rainmaking has become a science. The tiny droplets
of water that compose the white mist of cloud can be
made to grow into large drops that are too heavy to
drift in the sky and must fall to earth.
Cold does it. Pellets of"'dry ice", which is the
solid, frozen form of carbon dioxide and has a temple.
rature of 110°F. below zero, are scattered (or"seeded")
on a cloud from a plane flying above it. They cool
the air in the cloud, condense the moisture, and the
high mist turns to rain.
Another method is now being studied which requires
a machine on the ground, preferably on a hill, to make
a smoke of microscopic crystals of silver iodide. These
float into the moist air and also induce the drops to
form.
These methods are often successful and many mil-
lions of dollars are spent each year in efforts to make
rain by them. Even when rain is not wanted they are
sometimes used to empty a towering thundercloud
before it can become violent and drop its water as'a
destructive downpour or as hard hailstones. In both
ways crops have been saved.
But this is not an adequate answer to the problem
of getting rain where and when it is needed. It can
only be used when the right kind of cloud formation is
drifting by. But no man can make a cloud, nor can he
push or pull a cloud to the place where he wants rain
to fall.
A desert is arid primarily because clouds do not get
there. Instead, the air is dry and the sun burns hot
and steadily. If man would bring rain to such an
area, he must learn to bring clouds, and therefore to
control the circulation of the atmosphere. This is at
present an impossible task.
Two great forces are involved which are literally
astronomic. One is the power of the sun to evaporate
water, which is immense in the tropics where the rays
of the sun come down vertically, less in the slanting
rays of the temperate zones, slight in the arctic zones
where the sun shines weakly and nearly sideways from
the horizon.
Nearly all clouds contain water that came from the
ocean and most of it from the warm seas. The energy
required to vaporize the ocean water and lift it into
the sky is enormous.
It takes only about a tenth of an inch of rain
falling over 100 acres to produce 1, 000 tons of water.
To vaporize that much water with coal would require
more heat than is obtainable from 100 tons of this
fuel. A good rain one inch deep would need more
than is obtainable form 6, 400 tons of coal for each
square mile.
This energy is obviously beyond man's capacity, at
least until he learns to utilize atomic energy instead
of coal. Yet the sun lifts millions of times that
amount of water into the air from the sea every day.
Only the sun can do it.
Once the water is evaporated it is spread over the
earth by the circulation of the atmosphere, which is to
say, by winds. The first part of the motion is easy
enough to understand, for the moist air of the tropics
rises as it heats in the sunshine because warm air is
lighter than cold.
But it cannot go upwards for ever. Like a vast
fountain, it spills to the north and to the south, pushed
onward by more hot air rising behind it. Thus it
flows into the temperate zones, carrying its moisture
with it, both to the north and to the South.
Now the second great astronomical force shapes the
course of the moving air. The two great currents,
northward and southward, do not continue straight
north or south. The rotation of the earth sends them
both eastward. This is because the motion of the earth
at the equator is faster than either to the north
or to the south, so that at the north and south poles
the rotation involves no motion at all.
At the equator the earth turns on its axis once a day
- 25, 000 miles in 24 hours. The tropic air rotates
with that same speed. But as it moves away from the
equator the earth beneath it moves more slowly in
miles per hour. Retaining its momenta, the air seems
to move faster and thus blows eastward. The prevailing
winds, both in the north temperate zone and in the
south temperate zone, are western. Away from the tropic
areas most weather comes from the west for this reason.
But in the tropics, air must flow toward the equator
to replace the rising column. These are the trade
winds, and since they flow southward they are rotating
more slowly than is the earth at the equator. So they
drift westward as they go south. Thus the tropical
trade winds blow from the north-east.
There are many local modifications of these general
winds because of ocean currents, large bodies of warm
water such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean,
and mountain ranges. It is these that contribute
variety both to the climate and to the day-by-day
weather. It is the winds as modified by these factors
that determine where the clouds go.
But to condense the clouds into rain requires one
effect : cooling. Water vapour can remain in warm
air indefinitely, but when the temperature goes down,
the air can no longer keep the water in vapour form.
It condenses, first into tiny drops and then these
grow into larger drops. A very common cause of
cooling is the rise of a stream of air over a range of
mountains. As the altitude increases, the air cools and
if there is enough moisture in the air it falls as rain
on the near side of the mountains.
In the temperate regions, where the prevailing wind
is from the west, it is usually the western side of a
mountain range that is wet and rainy. On the other
side, the air has been drained of its water, and many
arid zones thus lie just east of the hills. On the other
hand, in the tropic zones where the trade winds carry
the moisture, the wet areas are to the east and north-
east of mountains and the dry zones lie beyond. Cooling
is also accomplished by cold winds from the arctic
regions that often flow under the warm moist air and
lift it upwards to bring rains and storm.
These forces-the heat of the sun, the rotation of
the earth, the cooling of vast masses of atmosphere-
are beyond man's control. One possible way to distri-
bute rainfall more evenly would be to level down the
mountains, but even this is beyond man's feeble powers.
In time the mountains will be washed away by the
rain itself. It has happened many times in the history
of the earth. But it takes millions of years and in that
time new mountain ranges will be raised elsewhere.
So the problems of getting water to the extremely
arid deserts are not likely to be solved by rainmaking.
If man wishes to bring water to them it must come
from the ground or direct from the sea, not from the
sky. There is hope, however, of increasing rainfall
in the arid and semi-arid areas fringing the world's
deserts.

### 71071: Is artificial rain possible in the parched lands of Baluchistan? Pakistani scientists and a UNESCO mission study the question
) TRIER JULY 1952. Page I I
PAKISTANI SCIENTISTS AND A UNESCO MISSION STUDY THE QUESTION
IS ARTIFICIAL RAIN POSSIBLE IN THE
PARCHED LANDS OF BALUCHISTAN ?
A TRAVELLER passing* through theBaluchistan desert of West
Pakistan begins to realize what
scientists mean when thev talk of
the"problem of the arid zone".
Mile after mile, on both sides of the
North western Railway, there is
nothing but cracked ground, tor-
tured bv thirst. On the rim of the
bowl of desert outside the train
windows rise up mountains stripped
to their very bones, with foothills
re. sembling gravel dumps left by a
Brobdingnagian construction crew.
woe had an opportunity to see this
"arid zone"at first hand ourselves
on a recent trip from Karachi to
Quetta, 500 miles to the north and
only 600 miles from the Khyber
Pass and the Afghanistan frontier.
The purpose of the trip was to
obtain a glimpse of what the
Meteorological Department of the
Government of Pakistan, with the
help of a Unesco technical assistance
mission, is proposing to do about
the weather.
The men who had the answer to
our question were Mohammed
Aslam, the 36-year-old director of
the Meteorological Department, and
Dr. Edward Fournier d'Albe, a Lon-
doner who was sent to Karachi-and
subsequently to Quetta-by Unesco.
In Western Pakistan, Mr. Aslam
explained, meteorQlogists have two
distinct tasks on their hands : the
arid zone in Baluchistan where
little more than five inches of rain
falls in an average year, and the
problem of river floods in rich
Punjab in the north which may
ause heavy damage. In East Paki-
wotan, there is the job of keeping
track of cyclones which sweep the
country in the monsoon season,
playing havoc with the river naviga-
tion upon which much of its econo-
mic life depends.
Quetta, in Baluchistan, Mr. Aslam
explained, is a key-point in the
Meteorological Department's pro-
By Daniel BEHRMAN
gramme to learn more about what
goes on in the atmosphere above
Pakistan. Part of this programme
consists of the establishment of a
chain of stations in six cities to
track thunderstorms by taking
bearings on lightning fia. shes. These
bearings are needed by flood control
authorities to obtain advance warn-
ings of heavy monsoon storms which
may dump as much as ten inches of
rain in one day upon certain
regions.
All in all the Government of Paki-
3tan has undertaken what amounts
to a nationwide inventory of all its
resources.
This inventory, part of which is
being conducted by the Meteorological
Department, Mr. Aslam said, has
resulted in the plan to establish a
geophysic and atmospheric research
centre to help survey Pakistan below
the earth, on the'surface, and in the
air. Since April, 1951, an inter-
national team of geophysicists re-
cruited in Australia, Denmark, Ger-
'many and the United Kingdom by
Unesco, has been working in Pakistan.
One of these scientists is Dr. Four-
nier d'Albe, a pleasant soft-spoken
man with a decided coolness towards
newspaper reporters who, ever'since
he conducted his first"cloud-seeding"
experiments in 1948 in the mountains
of France's Massif Central, have
persisted in calling him a rainmaker.
Strictly speaking, Dr. Fournier
d'Albe is a cloud physicist, which
seems a rather ethereal term until
you realize that his studies may help
solve the problem of increasing
rainfall in this water-starved land.
"Newspapers have a weakness for
rainmakers,"he told us sadly.
"According to some published reports,
we're on the verge of turning Balu-
chistan into a green and smiling land
of vegetable gardens."
Actually. Dr. Fournier d'Albe and
a team of Pakistani meteorologist
working at Quetta do not intend
to make any"cloud-seeding"
experiments for a long time to come.
They are more interested in finding
out exactlv to what extent such
experiments can bring permanent
. benefits.
The British physicist explained
that certain factors involved in rain-
fall-such as the thickness, up-
draught and water content of clouds- cannot be changed artificially.
However, through"seeding"of
clouds, it is possible for scientists to
add to the air quantities of"conden-
sation mlclei,"the tiny particles upon
which water vapour condenses to
form cloud droplets.
The head of the Quetta Meteoro-
logical Station, Mr. Ama Lateef, and
Dr. Fournier d'Albe have begun tests
to count these hygroscopic nuclei
from selected points throughout
Pakistan, beginning with Quetta.
Equipment used is inexpensive and
much of it i's produced by skilled
Pakistani instrument makers at the
Meteorological Department's work-
shop in Karachi.
We were able to watch one of
these experiments at Quetta where
Mr. Lateef and his assistants had set
up their instrument, a"cascade
impactei", outside the meteorological
station. For several minutes the
impacter, suspended from a gallows-
like stand, fluttered in a steady
breeze with a vacuum pump on one
end sucking in air for sampling (we
weren't allowed to smoke during the
test ; no-one was interested in count-
ing tobacco particles). Then glass
slides, which had collected the
samples, were removed from the
instruments and carefully labelled
for study under the microscope.
Pakistan is interested in counting
the"big"particles-about 1/100the
of a millimeter in diameter-in
her atmosphere. If the survey shows
that these water-collecting nuclei
are not in the air, then it may be
feasible to put them in frnm the
ground on a large scale. And if they
are already there ?
"In that case, we will have learned
that cloud seeding doesn't have much
chance of success here-and we
will learn the truth at a much lower
cost than if we had tried experiment-
ing with airplanes for 365 days a
year,"Dr. Fournier d'Albe declared.
Linked with the particle-counting
is the photogrammetric study of
cloud behaviour-a form of aerial
mapping from th"ground. The
purpose of this work is to help
answer the most perplexing question
arising in any rainfall experiments :
"Would it have rained anyway ?"
"No-one is'making rain'in
Pakistan,"Dr. Fournier d'Albe em-
phasized,'''But we hope to be able to
tell the Government exactly what
the chances are for large-scale
attempts at raising rainfall in the
future to succeed."
The geophysical research centre at
Quetta is still in its beginnings
because Pakistan has preferred to
build slowly and soundly. After its
first year of operation, the basic
preliminary work has been accom-
plished. A site for the centre has
been chosen-this itself was no
easy task-certain instruments have
been procured while others are on
order and, above all, a long-term plan
of action has been adopted and is
now being put into practice.
Unesco's scientists in the field at
Karachi and Quetta have accelerated
the programme, Pakistani officials
believe, and also have made a lasting
contribution by training personnel so
that the work may go on when the
mission has ended.
With one-third of the vast area of West Pakistan a desert, Pakistan and Unesco have joined forces in a research effort to determine just what the possibilities
are of increasing rainfall. Dr. Edward Fournier d'Albe (photo right) British physicist sent to Pakistan by Unesco, goes over plan for equipment with an instrument-
maker in Karachi. Fish-tailed apparatus (photo ! eft) hanging from gallows-like stand is"cascade impacter"used to collect air samples for analysis
by scientists of tiny particles which help form rain. Conducting the experiment is Ama Lateef, director of Pakistan's meteorological station at Quetta.

### 71072: What people in Delhi like to read: contrasting tastes of East and West
Page JULY952. UNESCO
WHAT PEOPLE IN DELHI LIKE TO READ
CONTRASTING TASTES OF EAST AND WEST
by Frank M. GARDNER
Unesco Consultant, Delhi Public Library ; Borough Librarian, Luton, England
WHO are the potential library readers, and what do they want toread ? What subjects are they interested in ? What are their
demands for information as <lfainst recreation ? Most import-
tant of all, do they want books at all ?
The Delhi Public Library, opened by the Prime Minister of India
last October, and sponsored jointly by the Indian Ministry of Education
and Unesco, is able to give a partial reply to some of these questions.
of interest not only to librarians but also to publishers, booksellers and
authors. It can, in the process, also ask a few more. The last
(Illeslion. at any rate. will be easily answered. In rust over four
months, over 28, 000 books have been
lent for home reading, and over
130, 000 people have visited the various
departments. The total would have
been greater if the premises had been
larger and bookstocks bigger. Seldom
can an experimental institution have
met with such an overwhelming res-
ponse.
Answers to other questions are
naturally affected by the available
stock of books, which is still small,
but already there are some interesting
contrasts with the public library user
in England, and they raise some im-
portant problems for the future.
Although the library stock is in
three languages, demand for books in
Hindi predominates, to the extent
of two-thirds of the total. And
almost two-thirds of these, in turn,
are fiction, which is almost the same
proportion as in English libraries. Is
that a good thing or bad ? Without
expressing an opinion on the quality
of the novel in Hindi, I should say it
is good. Imaginative expression is a
sure sign of cultural virility, and
having had my greatest pleasures in
life through reading for entertain-
ment, I should be the last to deny
others the same opportunities.
Turning to fact instead of fiction,
the Indian library reader has very
different tastes from the English one.
In Hindi, the most wanted subject is
literature, then sociology, biography,
and philosophy, in that order. Few
books are borrowed on history, fine
arts, languages and science, and the
demand for technical books is only
moderate.
The Delhi Library, only a few
months after its inception, is lending
as many books on philosophy as my
own library in England, and over
half as many on sociology, but only
a tenth as many on technical subjects,
and less than a fortieth on fine arts.
The interest in philosophy is a
tribute to India's pre-eminence in the
field, but the interest in sociology is
not so good if it is at the expense of
other subjects. One reason for the
unbalance is, of course, the lack of
books. One notices in lists of books
from Indian publishers and book-
sellers a preponderance of works on
theoretical subjects-politics, econo-
mics, accountancy, statistics and law.
There seems to be more interest in
politics than people, more in manage-
ment than making, more in social
conditions than social life. There
seen to be few books, indigenous
either by language or by subject, on
the subjects that in England form the
bulk of library reading : home-mak-
ing, sports, gardening, hobbies, nature
study, popular science, travel.
Why is this so ? With very inadequate facts to go on, it seems
to me that the educated library reader is at the university level, and
mainly interested in pursuing a set course of study. Below that level,
the wants of the reader have either not yet been expressed or realized
by publishers, except to some extent in fiction. The cultural oppor-
tunities ofl'ered by the public library will become of greater importance.
It is necessary that the nature of the problems is realized early in library
development.
MODEL FOR AN ENTIRE CONTINENT
PEOPLE in many countries are seeking the information, education and enter-
P tainment which public libraries offer. This has been demonstrated by the
Delhi Public Library, a pilot project begun by the Government of India and
Unesco last October. Since then thousands of readers have used its
services. If it had not been created, most of these people would have been
unable to obtain the books they need and obviously want. Flocking into the
library every day are all sorts of people : rich and poor, educated and those
who have never been to school, adults and children. All of them are served,
but the library staff gives special attention to people with little formal
education-those who have recently learned to read. They will get even more
help in the months to come as the library begins a mobile service and expands
its programme of sub-branches in literacy centres. The Delhi Public Library
is doing a job of serving many people in one city, but there are thousands of
other cities, towns and rural districts which need this kind of service. Unesco
lacks the funds to help start public libraries in all of these places, but it
points to the pilot project in Delhi as a model which could be followed
elsewhere, especially throughout India and other parts of Asia. In view of
the success of the Delhi Library, Unesco has decided to set up a similar project
in Latin America., in co-operation with the Government of Colombia.

English women read more than men
TT ow does the Indian reader use a library ? He uses it very well,probably better than his British counterpart. He certainly returns
his books more promptly, and handles them as carefully. I have
personally been most impressed by the quietness of readers and their
general behaviour, and have even had the experience of being asked
by a reader to talk more quietly to a member of the staff-something
that never happened to me in England.
Do they steal more books ? There is no evidence of that as yet,
but even in England, after a hundred years of libraries, some people
Another striking contrast is in the
age of readers. In England, the pro-
portion of the child population using
the public library is very high, run-
ning up to 75 per cent in my own
town. Then it declines sharply as
children leave school, and the age
groups 15 to 25 are least strongly
represented.
Efforts are made to attract ado-
lescents to library use through the
youth organizations, but without much
success. In Delhi, no such problem
exists. It is obvious to the most
casual reader that young people
around 18 are the public library's most
devoted users. What they read, and
what they would like to read, will be
an interesting topic for closer study
in the future.
Helping the writers
BUT a library needs books as wellas readers, and children's books
are woefully inadequate, both in
quantity and quality. Quantity is
a problem that will solve itself as
demand increases, but quality in
children's books is a recent develop-
ment even in the U. S. A. and England.
If children's libraries can estab-
lish a firm market for well-printed
and well-illustrated books, they wn !
do a great service to education in India
generally, and. co-operation here is
most important.
In fact, the problem is a more
general one. The potential library
readers in India already exist, and
will increase enormously in the next
decade. I have already mentioned
the new class of readers that will
arise. Where will the books come
from ? In the English language, the
number of titles in print must be
more than 250, 000, and the annual
output must be 30, 000 or 40, 000,
Although one can make no more than
a guess at the availability of Hindi
titles of books suitable for a public
library, there are probably not more
than 7, 000 to 10, 000, and the annual
output cannot be over 2, 000, including
pamphlets. Of these many are badly
printed in unsuitable editions. In the
west, the growth of public libraries
followed the production of books in
quantity. In India, the two things
must grow together. Libraries can
have a direct influence on supply by
creating a firm market for suitable
books.
Here is a new problem for a lib-
rary ; net merely to buy the books
for its readers, but to assist in creat-
ing the books themseives by encou-
raging authors, publishers and book-
sellers to place on the market more
and better works.
If public libraries in India are to
play their full part in democratic
development, they must meet this challenge and turn it into an oppor-
tunity. It is an opportunity far greater than that facing the public
libraries of England a hundred years ago, because the need is more
urgent.
Libraries will naturally assist in the spread of literacy, but literacy
is a means not an end. In the use of libraries lie the prizes that are
beyond literacy.
To gain these prizes, certain necessities must be faced, The library
must be free and open to all. Its purposes must be to inform and
entertain, as well as to educate, and readers must be encouraged to use
books for leisure as well as vocation. And it must be realized that a
library is a continuing institution. If not allowed to expand it dies,
as a plant dies without water. Too many libraries have been estab-
lished in India with the best of intentions but with no provision for
sustenance, and inevitably they have withered.
To see the readers at the Delhi Public Library, young and old, is a
soul-satisfying sight to everyone who believes that books are the prin-
cipal agents of true civilization. Behind every one using the library
there are thousands without such facilities, and preparations must be
made to help them.
still steal what is in fact their own. what misplaced ingenuity I have
seen so far has been mainly devoted to what is in a sense the laudable
objective of acquiring an extra ticket. One method of achieving this,
which it would be unwise to disclose, had never occurred to me in
25 years of administration, and filled me with unwilling admiration.
One contrast, however, is regrettable. In England, the fairer sex
predominates in the library, even among the staff, and vives get the
library books for their husbands. In Delhi, the women are shy, or
maybe they have less time for reading. At any rate, they are compa-
ratively rare visitors to the lines of bookshelves.

There is a striking contrast between public library readers in England and India. In the average
English public library (above) women predominate and wives tend to borrow books for their husbands.
In India, women are comparatively rare visitors. In English libraries (below) the proportion of children
is very high, declining sharply as children leave school. The age group between 15 and 25 is least
represented. In Delhi, teenagers are a library's most devoted users. (CO ! Photos. British Crown copyright.)
One of Unesco's aims is to encourage the development of public library services for ail people
whether they live in cities or rural districts. Delhi's Public Library project will shortly include a
mobile rural service, It will be similar to the bookmobile (below) in British Columbia, Canada.
ONE WOMAN
STARTED IT ALL
Two years ago the Greek island
of Aegina had no public library.
Today it has. This is largely due
to the initiative of one woman.
by Beatrix COLLlNGHAA1
FIVE minutes'walk up the village street from Aeginaharbour, on a corner to the left, the visitor may
notice an interesting-looking old house standing
back from the road. In the garden of the house, which
was once the home of John Capodistrias, the first Presi-
dent of modern Greece, there stands a new building, small
and plain, of island stone. It is the first modern public
lending library in Greece. And the emphasis is on the
words modern and leading.
Most towns in Greece have a public library. Occa-
sionally, as at Salonica, Patras, Corfu and Chios, they
have very fine ones, but they are only public in the sense
that they are property of the municipality. The main
concern of the librarian is generally to conserve his books,
rather than to facilitate their use. Readers may not
borrow, nor are they free to browse amongst the shelves.
It was, I believe, Chios which took the initiative in open-
ing a small lending section-but the arrangement is
regarded as a conce. ssion, whereas at Aegina the outlook is
quite different. You can see that at a glance.
Its bright room-tastefully decorated with pictures
and the odd vase of flowers, with shelves arranged accord-
ing to the international Dewey system and well sign-
posted-is a revolution in Greek library practice.
Entering behind a village boy with the usual close-
cropped hair, I was greatly moved at seeing him go
through the routine of returning his book, taking his
ticket, choosing one or two volumes, and sitting down to
sample a little of each before making up his mind which
to take home. A simple act, but, to my eye, historic.
It all began two years ago. The initiative came from an
official of the Ministry of Education, Mrs. Peppa Xeflouda,
who, since long before the war, had followed with lively
interest the development of the public library movement
throughout the world.
In 1948, she had an opportunity to see for herself. As
a guest of the British Council, she took a course of study
at the University of London School of Librarianship and,
subsequently, with a Unesco Fellowship, visited libraries
of many kinds in Britain, France and Scandinavia.
Rural library methods seemed best suited to her country,
and on her return home she sought an opportunity to
experiment. The chief obstacle was lack of money, but,
even so, much might be done with the existing libraries,
given the will.
By 1949, the outlook was encouraging. A General
Council of Libraries was formed with the object of pro-
moting the study of modern methods of librarianship, and
shortly afterwards an Act of Parliament authorized the
Minister of Education to allocate money for libraries.
The amount was small, but the principle was established.
About the same time, a hundred or so librarians from
all over Greece attended a fortnight's course at the United
States Information Service Library. There were useful
discussions, and various plans were formulated, but months
went by and nothing actually happened. Mrs. Xeflouda,
however, was not discouraged : she determined to produce
a working example of a modern library. And her thoughts
turned to her own island home of Aegina.
The mayor, schoolteachers, tradesmen, all kinds of
people came forward with offers of help when she made
her plan known. The Ministry of Education also gave its
blessing, and provided money for roof, windows and doors
to be added to a half-completed building left with un-
conscious forethought by the Germans.
Old book-cases were found in the town hall and re-
modelled like last year's hat. The carpenter who did this
also constructed a professional-looking periodicals rack,
and an issue counter with the right kind of drawers and
fittings. The necessary wood was given by the mayor,
Mr. Hadzis, and Mrs. Xeflouda presented the catalogue
cabinet.
All was ready now for the books. In the circumstances,
these had to be donations, and they came from far and
wide. Many were the gift of interested people in Aegina
and Athens, including publishers and writers, but in
addition there arrived sizeable contributions from overseas
through Unesco, notably from the New York Public
Library, the CARE Children's Book Fund, the Lord Mayor
of London and the British and Foreign Bible Society.
Especially useful was the gift of $50 worth of Unesco
Book Coupons, which sufficed to purchase a complete set
of Greek classical text. s and a variety of reference books.
Months. of preparatory work had to be done before the
public could be admitted. Mrs. Xeflouda and the present
(unpaid) librarian, Miss Georgia Elia, dealt with these
preliminaries at weekends, with enthusiastic help from a
band of capable boys and girls who labelled and numbered
the books, and even scrubbed the floor in readiness for
the opening ceremony which took place last October.
Now the public library is a feature of everyday life in
Aegina, and its future is assured because the Ministry of
Education and the General Council of libraries are making
a n ()'u ! i ! r p-ontribution towards its runnins exnenses.
Nor is this the whole story. Access to books quickens
curiosity, and so the suggestion was made quite spon-
taneously that classes should be held in the library. The
majority of people wanted first of all to learn some
English, so a teacher was found to come and give lessons
every Sunday morning. Other classes are being planned.
Thus Aegina is demonstrating how a public library can
be not only a store-house of knowledge and ideas, but also
a power station generating new intellectual activity in
the community it serves.

### 71075: UNESCO's 'free trade in knowledge' pact comes into force
Page 14. JULY 1952
UNESCO'S'FREE TRADE IN KNOWLEDGE
PACT COMES INTO FORCE
A few years ago, a well-known
scientist received a letter in-viting him to attend an im-
portant conference in a foreign
country. He accepted the invitation
and a few days later packed his
suitcase and boarded a train for
his destination.
While he was noting down some
of the things he hoped to reveal to
his colleagues, his train pulled to a
halt at the frontier.
There, he became so terribly em-
broiled in customs formalities over
an educational film he had brought
along that he left it in disgust at the
frontier post !
On May 21 of this year, ten coun-
tries agreed that this sort of thing
will no longer happen at their front-
iers. On that day, Mr. Trygve Lie,
Secretary-General of the United Na-
tions, declared :"I hereby proclaim
the entry into force of the Unesco
Agreement on the Importation of
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Materials."
He was presiding at a ceremony
at UN headquarters in New York to
mark the first day of operation of
the Unesco treaty which abolishes
import duties on books and period-
icals, works of art, educational
films, scientific equipment, articles
for the blind, and many other ma-
terials which are vitally important
for the educational and scientific
progress of nations.
So far, the treaty affects
165, 000, 000 people in 11 countries.
It went into force on May 21 when
Sweden became the 10th nation to
ratify the agreement. An addi-
tional 19 countries have signed too,
and many of their ratifications are
expected in the months ahead (1).
The Times of London has describ-
ed the new treaty-which is the
first to come into operation under
Unesco's auspices-as"an admir-
able step backwards into a more
sensible world."It is a"step
backwards"in the sense that cus-
toms barriers to knowledge are a
20th century innovation. A hun-
dred years ago, it was quite easy to
get books from abroad or send them
to other countries. Transport by
sailing ships was slower than today
but free trade was the general rule.
Customs officials nearly every-
where paid no attention to book
parcels, and educational materials
moved around the world un-
hampered by duties, taxes and other
obstacles. Some governments even
made special arrangements to make
sure that trade in these materials
would not be obstructed. In 1860,
for example, the United Kingdom
and France signed a treaty provid-
ing for free untaxed trade in books.
Then came the First World War.
Governments adopted tariffs and
licensing systems to limit trade to
"essential"goods and most educa-
tional articles suffered. The eco-
nomic depression of the 1930's
brought many new restrictions in
the form of import quotas and cur-
rency and export regulations. With
the Second World War and the
big disruption of shipping, com-
merce and industry, came the final
blow to the free trade system.
Educational materials, w h i c h
were needed more than ever before,
suffered more than most com-
modities. Books, paintings, music,
science equipment were caught up
in the web of restrictions along with
other products. Today, trade res-
trictions to knowledge exist every-
where.
These were summarized last year
by Unesco in a closely set volume of
167 pages entitled Trade Barriers to
Knowledge (2). It shows that more
than 50 countries impose duties and
an assortment of other taxes on the

importation of books. By some
strange logic, certain countries tax
imported film by the foot, others tax
sculpture or paintings or maps by
the pound-like refrigerated beef.
Science equipment is taxed as high
as 40 per cent of its value.
Trade Barriers to Knowledge re-
veals many strange practices. Thus,
for example, the customs laws of
Czechoslovakia provide that wood or
metal statues can enter duty-free
provided they are"not less than life
size", while stone statues are not
subject to duty if they weigh more
than 11 lbs. In the United States,
printed music, maps and charts
can enter duty-free if they are more
than 20 years old. In Iceland, ordi-
nary gramophone records pay an 11
per cent import tax, but those used
for foreign language study pay 14
per cent-three per cent higher !
Recently, a university professor
wrote a letter to Unesco explaining
that because of the new, heavy im-
port duties charged by his country,
an essential textbook had become so
expensive that his students could
not afford to buy it any more. Exhi-
import licences and foreign ex-
change for books and publications
required by libraries. They also
agree to speed up and simplify
clearance through customs of all
materials of an educational, scienti-
fic and cultural character.
Unesco is publishing a simply-
worded manual to show how the
treaty operates, which will be dis-
tributed in participating countries.
The treaty works quite easily. For
individuals, no special formalities
are needed. A book-seller imports
books in the same way as he did be-
fore but he no longer pays duties
and some of the other taxes pre-
viously charged. To be classified as
"recognized", institutions have to
obtain approval from their govern-
ments.
Here are some specific examples of
what the Unesco treaty means for
the student, teacher, artist, scientist
and the average person generally in
the eleven countries which have
ratified it.
The agreement prevents future
duties from being levied on books,
The Unesco Free Trade Agreement entered into force on May 21 when Mr. Sven
Grafstrom (left), Permanent Representative of Sweden to the U. N., deposited
his country's instrument ot ratification. At right is Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-
General of the United Nations, who presided at ratification ceremony,
and with them is Mr. S. Arnaldo, Director of Unesco's New York office.
bitions and collections for schools
languish in customs warehouses
while their sponsors try to raise the
heavy bond required by the autho-
rities. In another letter to Unesco, a
museum director wrote telling how
he had planned to send a collection
of paintings abroad for a special ex-
hibition. Because of the heavy bond
asked by the importing country, the
exhibition never got past the foreign
frontier.
The treaty abolishes import duties
on the following five categories of
materials :
1) PUBLICATIONS : books, newspapers,
magazines, music (printed and
manuscript), maps, charts.
2) WORKS OF ART : paintings, sculp-
ture, antiques, scientific collec-
tions or specimens used by zoolo-
gists, anatomists, botanists, mi-
neralogists, paleontologists, ar-
chaelogists and anthropologists.
3) VISUAL AND AUDITORY MATERIALS :
educational films, filmstrips,
newsreels, sound recordings, mi-
crofilms, slides (if imported by
schools, universities, libraries,
broadcasting organizations and
other recognized institutions).
4) SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT : all cate-
gories (if imported by laboratories
and other recognized institu-
tions and unavailable domestic-
ally.)
5) ARTICLES FOR THE BLIND : all cate-
gories.
Governments which have ratified
the treaty also undertake to grant
magazines and newspapers in most
countries where they already enter
duty-free. But in Sweden and
Yugoslavia books will now be cheap-
er. A duty amounting to $0. 19 a kilo
(2. 2 ibs.) on illustrated books and
children's picture books will end in
Sweden. Yugoslavia will abolish im-
port duties ranging from $0. 26 to
$0. 33 a kilo on books in the Yugoslav
languages as well as on magazines
and manuscripts.
Swedish school teachers now save
$0. 29 a kilo formerly imposed on cer-
tain imported maps and charts.
The saving on these articles to
Yugoslav educators runs from $0. 09
to $0. 18 a kilogram.
When a 300-metre (980-foot) edu-
cational or scientific film enters Pa-
kistan, Thailand or Yugoslavia, it
is no longer subjected to duties
amounting to $19. 60, $1. 57 and
$1. 12 respectively in these countries.
The saving on the same length of
newsreel is $24. 00 in Ceylon, $19. 60
in Pakistan and $28. 56 in Israel.
Research workers and science
teachers in Pakistan, where science
is mobilized in a vast national deve-
lopment plan, are spared a 30 per
cent customs levy on imported
equipment. Swedish scientists will
save 15 per cent as a result of the
treaty. These duties often ran into
hundreds of dollars for a single
instrument.
Many other groups will benefit.
Art importers will no longer pay a
35 per cent duty on sculpture in Is-
rael, 30 pe'cent in Pakistan or 45
per cent III Ceylon. Life, too, will
become simpler for Swedish customs
officials who have have had to com-
pute the duty on paintings based on
the width of the frame and picture
combined with the total weight.
Gramophone record users will no
longer pay 20 per cent duty in Thai-
land, 45 per cent in Ceylon and 50
per cent in Pakistan. In Ceylon, a
27 per cent duty on radio sets for
the blind is abolished.
The Unesco treaty thus constitutes
a kind of indirect subsidy to educa-
tion, the arts and the sciences. It
means that governments have agreed
to forego revenues which they have
derived in the past from the pockets
of lovers of art, readers of books, or
from the limited budgets of educa-
tional institutions importing essen-
tial equipment from abroad.
Most of the revenue derived by
governments from such duties is
relatively small anyway. As the
Manchester Guardian has said,
"No country would suffer economic
disaster if most of these regulations
were swept away."In reality, no
governments ever wanted to cripple
education with its customs laws.
They were prepared to drop their
. carriers, but some kind of interna-
tional machinery was needed to pro-
vide them with a way of doing so.
This Unesco has done.
As early as 1946, it assumed the
leadership of a campaign to abolish
trade barriers to knowledge. Unes-
co's General Conference agreed that
an international treaty, to be adopt-
ed by as many nations as possible,
was the best answer. In 1949, Unes-
co sought the advice of the Contract-
ing Parties to the General Agree-
ment on Tariffs and Trade which
met at Annecy, France. Thirty-four
countries, including 26 Unesco mem-
bers, took part in this trade confer-
ence which set up a special com-
mittee to draft the treaty. The men
on this committee succeeded for the
first time in establishing a common
international standard.
The Unesco treaty was opened for
signature in Noverilber 1950. Since
then, in addition to the eleven coun-
tries which have now ratified, 19 na-
tions have signed the agreement.
Most of them are now seeking rati-
fication by their parliaments.
The pact has received widespread
support from the world press, from
official agencies and voluntary
groups. The Manchester Guardian
declared that"there is no reason for
criss-crossing the world with bar-
riers against the spread of know-
ledge,"and urged governments to
ratify. The UN Economic and Social
Council, the Brussels Treaty Powers
and the Council of Europe have
stressed its importance.
At Uppsala, Sweden, a conference
of European newspaper editors call-
ed on"liberal-minded people in all
countries"to support the treaty.
And the New York Times wrote :"In
a world in which freedom of infor-
mation has become constantly more
restricted, the United Nations pact
is a welcome and encouraging move
which the United States ought to
support."
Some 20 international non-govern-
mental organizations have also en-
dorsed it. The International Fede-
ration of Newspaper Editors and
Publishers and the International
Exchange Committee (a free trade
body) have urged their national as-
sociations to support ratification. So
also have the League of Red Cross
Societies and the International
Council of Women.
When the treaty came into force
on May 21, Unesco's Director-Gen-
eral made the following statement :
"On behalf of Unesco I congratu-
late the first adherents to this inter-
national instrument of cultural ex-
change, and sincerely trust that they
will soon be jDined by others. The
readiness of Governments to ratify
and implement the agreement will
give the world fresh proof of their
refusal to turn geographical front-
iers into intellectual barriers. It
will show that they are determined
to promote that intellectual and mo-
ral solidarity of mankind which
strengthens peace through the com-
munion of minds."

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
THE BARRIERS
TO FREE TRADE
IN KNOWLEDGE
ARE FALLING
Modern technology has made it possible for books, scientific equipment and other
educational material to move across frontiers on an unprecedented scale. Yet we
are worse off now than 60 or 100 years ago, when book parcels could travel unhampered
to almost any country. Since the end of the first World War, thousands of little threads
of complex regulations, tariffs and import taxes have woven themselves into a formidable
web criss-crossing the entire world with barriers to the spread of knowledge between
nations. Today over 50 countries impose custom duties and other trade restrictions
on books alone. Scientific equipment, needed in research laboratories, is taxed as
high as 40 per cent of its value. And by some strange twist of logic certain countries
tax imported film by the foot and sculpture by the pound ; others exempt handwritten
manuscripts but tax typewritten ones ; allow paper-backed crime novels to enter duty-
free but tax scientific and technical works if they happen to be bound in leather. An
important step to break this formidable web-at least in part-was made on May 21,
when a treaty sponsored by Unesco entered into force in the first ten countries to
ratify it. This ends import duty on materials of a scientific and educational character
ranging from books, periodicals and works of art to gramophone records, scientific
apparatus and articles for the blind. (Story on page 14). COI photo British Crown copyright.
