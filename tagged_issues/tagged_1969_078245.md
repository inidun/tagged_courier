Water-carrying centaur
Man has always fashioned noble recipients for water as the remains of all ancient civi¬
lizations testify. Medieval artists and craftsmen and those of the Renaissance (including
Benvenuto Cellini, the famous Italian sculptor) perpetuated the tradition with aqua-
maniles (religious or secular water vessels for washing one's hands) that were exquisite
examples of sculpture and metalwork. Aquamaniles were often given the form of a
horse, a rider or a fabulous animal such as this centaur (a creature of Greek mythology,
half man, half horse) on whose back stands a boy flutist. A 1 3th century work of engrav¬
ed bronze, it was discovered in Hungary.

### 58109: ILO 50th anniversary: building the international foundations for true human rights in work
by Cian Franco Pompei
Chairman of the Unesco Executive Board
%£>J
1919 1969
w.'E are in the year 1919.
The world has just been ravaged by
a war, the like of which had never
been known before, but less than
three months after the armistice, men
we're beginning to look to the future.
On January 25, the Paris Peace
Conference decided at its first session
to appoint a Commission on Inter¬
national Labour Legislation, composed
of fifteen members, whose task was
to make a survey of labour conditions,
study the international measures
needed to ensure joint action on
questions concerning labour conditions,
and make proposals for setting up a
permanent organization to carry out
these studies and surveys in collabora¬
tion with the League of Nations and
under its supervision.
The Commission, under its chairman
Samuel Gompers, President of the
American Federation of Labour, took
as the basis for its discussions a
British project for creating a permanent
Labour Organization as part of the
League of Nations.
While it was meeting, the Com¬
mission learned that the International
Trade Union Conference meeting in
Berne, had adopted a Labour Charter
setting forth a number of general
principles on international labour
legislation.
It drew inspiration from the Charter
in preparing the text which was sub¬
mitted to the Peace Conference and
adopted on April 11, with a few minor
amendments. This text, divided into
two parts one concerning the Inter¬
national Labour Organization and the
other dealing with general principles
became part of the Treaty of Versailles.
Such were the modest beginnings
of the ILO.
It was this vision of a better, more
humane world which enabled the ILO
to survive the dark years before and
during the Second World War, and
which gave it a new lease of life
in 1944, with the adoption of the
Declaration of Philadelphia which,
President Roosevelt said, "embodies
the hopes of an era which has known
two world wars ... it may one day
exercise an influence equal to that of
the Declaration of Independence of the
United States of America."
Strengthened in its motivations and
in its principles, the ILO was thus in
a position to assist in the recon¬
struction of the post-war world. With
this end in view, in 1946 it amended
its Constitution and concluded the
Agreement which established it as a
Specialized Agency of the United
Nations.
Firstly, on the organizational level,
the ILO has played a major rôle in
the genesis of the modern concept
of balanced economic and social
development, one of the fundamental
aims of all the organizations of the
United Nations family.
This dynamic concept, radically
opposed to the static approach of the
19th century, is the basis of the
principles of social progress set forth
in the preamble to the ILO Constitution.
These principles are even more clearly
expressed in the Declaration of Phila¬
delphia, which of.ates on the one hand
that social progress is the result of
economic progress, whose fruits must
be equitably shared; and on the other
hand, that social progress must be
based on a world policy which excludes
economic advantages obtained at the
expense of the conditions of workers.
IHE ideas of the founders
of the ILO were revolutionary for, in
those early days when governments
and peoples lived in constant fear of
recessions and economic crises, which
seemed unavoidable, they were imbued
not with Utopian dreams but with the
vision of a world where steady and
continuous growth would be a reality.
Secondly, while the ultimate aim of
social justice proclaimed in the ILO
Constitution expressed the aspirations
of a world conscience sharpened by
the privations and sufferings of the
war years, it also constituted a major
innovation in international life.
Those who strove, in 1919, to
translate the ideal into reality had few
precedents on which to build: in all,
two international conventions signed in
Berne in 1906, one prohibiting the use
of white phosphorous in the manu¬
facture of matches and the other
making the employment of women for
night work illegal.
This was very little when one
compares this embryo of international
labour legislation with the impressive
legal work the ILO has since
accomplished.
But it was a great deal when one
considers the obstacles which had to
be overcome to achieve these first
steps in drawing up a truly inter¬
national code of labour legislation,
which the ILO undertook on the
initiative of its first Director-General,
Albert Thomas. With unflagging
energy, he devoted himself whole¬
heartedly to the task which was
pursued and consolidated, year by
year, at each session of the Inter¬
national Labour Conference.
From this painstaking effort, carried
out pragmatically without any striving
for spectacular results, has emerged
the modern concept of human rights,
a concept which in addition to the
political rights proclaimed by the
Declaration of the Rights of Man and
of the Citizen in 1789, affirms the
economic and social rights set forth
in 1948 in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. It is this concept
which embodies the highest aspira¬
tions of mankind today. Here again,
the ILO has broken new ground,
making possible slow but steady
progress towards the ultimate goal of
social justice.
The new approach which character¬
ized the Constitution of the ILO
contains a third aspect which is unique
of its kind. This is the tripartite
structure of the Organization (com¬
prising governments, workers and
employers) which is reflected in the
composition of the International Labour
Conference and in the Governing Body
of the International Labour Office.
The formula proposed by the
founders of the Organization seemed p
so self-evident that the only points at H
issue were how it should be applied.
Should governments have a one-third
representation and be on the same

ILO 50TH ANNIVERSARY (Continued)
On an equal footing: workers, employers, and governments
6
footing as workers and employers?
Or should government representation
equal the two other groups combined?
The solution finally adopted was the
second.
This structure clearly reveals the
desire to ensure what we are
accustomed to-day to call "participa¬
tion." What, indeed, is the purpose
of gathering together in the Organiza¬
tion's deliberating bodies, repre¬
sentatives of the three groups, each
with its own particular interests which
may at times coincide if not to ensure
the effective participation of all three
in the discussions and decisions which
directly affect them?
Obviously the need for communica¬
tion and dialogue, which we seem to
have rediscovered only recently, was
then considered vital for establishing
that atmosphere of confidence without
which the Organization would have
laboured in vain.
This, perhaps, is the key to the
success of the ILO in overcoming the
difficulties and crises which are
common to all young organizations.
In any case, the practice of participa¬
tion and dialogue [as an integral
feature of the organization] has by no
means exhausted all its possibilities
and is as relevant today as it was
50 years ago.
From the very beginning, the ILO
recognized that it could not accomplish
its mission within a restricted geogra¬
phical area, that the countries outside
Europe were bound to play an
increasingly important rôle in inter¬
national affairs, and consequently that
its activities and influence must be
world-wide.
The founding member states were
countries signing the Treaty of Ver¬
sailles plus the thirteen States which
were invited to join the League of
Nations Covenant. The concept of
broadening the geographical frame¬
work of the ILO as a first step towards
"universality" was given particular
emphasis by Harold Butler, who in 1932
succeeded Albert Thomas as Director-
General. And it was during his term
of office, in 1934, that the United States
of America and the U.S.S.R. became
member states. The Organization's
capacity to play a world rôle was thus
established long before the era
of international organizations which
began after the Second World War.
In pursuing its aims, the ILO has
developed new and unusual methods
of international co-operation. Firstly,
the technique of international labour
legislation, from the drawing up of ILO
conventions and recommendations to
their entry into force and control of
their application, has become a model
of its kind.
In the first place, there are elaborate
procedures for consulting member
states before the adoption of texts by
the International Labour Conference.
Even more unusual are the provisions
foreseen once texts are actually
adopted.
For example, at a period when the
sovereign rights of States were far
more jealously protected than they are
today, member states undertook to
submit any convention adopted by the
Conference, not later than one year
afterwards (or 18 months in exceptional
circumstances) to "the authority or
authorities within whose competence
the matter lies for the enactment of
legislation or other action." This pro¬
cedure applies, mutatis mutandis, to
recommendations adopted in the same
way by the Conference.
The technique for controlling the
application of conventions, reinforced
in 1946 in the light of experience,
provided for the submission of
reports by member states in clearly
defined conditions, and includes pro¬
visions for appeals, that is, the pro¬
cedure to be followed in the case of
complaints which may be made
against states which have failed to
ensure that conventions adopted have
been carried out satisfactorily.
These -rules governing international
conventions and recommendations,
which have had a profound influence
on practices adopted by other organ¬
izations, including Unesco, represent
a major innovation in the conduct of
international affairs.
There is a tendency to contrast the
ILO's legal work, which has been a
conspicuous feature of its action since
the earliest days, with its operational
activities, which sometimes appear to
take second place. Until the Expanded
Programme of Technical Assistance
was launched in 1949, the United
Nations Specialized Agencies indeed
lacked the means to give direct
assistance to their member states.
But before this programme was in¬
troduced, technical co-operation had
become standard practice among inter¬
national organizations. Indeed, as far
back as the 1930s the ILO began
sending technical missions to its
member states, at their request, to
advise them in drawing up social
legislation.
These first technical assistance
missions, though in no way comparable
in complexity and scope to those
carried out by technical missions we
know today, have contributed, however
modestly, to creating a new concept
of the rôle of international organiza¬
tions.
One could quote other examples of
methods utilized by the ILO which
have proved their merits and have
subsequently become general practice
in international life: the study of
specific technical problems, exchanges
of information and publications but
the ones I have described seem to me
to illustrate very clearly the pioneering
rôle played by the ILO in this field...
The above text is taken from an address
delivered before the Unesco Executive Board
on May 8, 1963 by its chairman, commemorat¬
ing the 50th anniversary of the International
Labour Organization. On this occasion, the
Executive Board welcomed Mr David A.
Morse, Director-General of the ILO.
The first session of the International Labour Conference,
opens in Washington, D.C, on October 29, 1919, four months
after the signing of the Versailles Peace Treaty.

The world has some
16 million teachers. Four
million more will be needed
by 1970, and between
34 and 44 million by the
end of the century.
Everywhere recruitment and
training pose crucial
problems. All countries
are tackling the problem of
teacher-training colleges.
Here, U.N. agencies are
playing an important part.
The ILO and Unesco have
also studied ways of
improving the status of the
teaching profession itself.
A joint world-wide survey
was carried out a few
years ago, and what
amounts to a universal
Charter for teachers was
drawn up and adopted
unanimously in 1966. The
Charter outlines teachers'
rights and duties, stressing
the need for professional
training and the general
principles of the status of
teachers, security of tenure,
hours of work, social
security, advancement.

### 58111: A World Employment Programme
ILO announces
A WORLD
EMPLOYMENT
PROGRAMME
by David A. Morse
Director-General
International Labour Office
I

WO harsh facts of the
modern world underlie the need for a
world employment programme. These
are:
Economic progress in developing
countries though perceptible, is slow;
the gap between poor and rich gets
wider every day.
The population explosion in these
countries impedes progress, and in
most of them more than half of the
benefits of increased production is ab¬
sorbed in merely maintaining existing
levels of living, low as they are, for
ever more people.
Opportunities for work have not in¬
creased as fast as the numbers of
workers. Scores of millions are entirely
bypassed by economic development.
And the prospect for the future is
even more grim. United Nations and
ILO projections indicate that in 1970
the world's population may be about
3,600 million and the labour force some
1,510 million.
During the present decade the lab¬
our force has been increasing by
about 20 million persons per year and
during the next decade it is expected
to grow by about 28 million a year.
Between 1970 and 1980 more than
280 million people will be added to
the world's labour force, 226 million
in the less developed regions of the
world and 56 million in the more dev¬
eloped regions.
Of these 280 million and more, about
173 million will be added to the labour
force in Asia, 32 million in Africa,
29 million in Latin America, 18 million
in the Soviet Union, 17 million in North
America, 12 million in Europe and 1.3
million in Oceania. The net increase
in the world's labour force under the
age of 25 will amount to some 68 mil¬
lion workers, nearly all of whom
(64.5 million) will be added to the lab
our force of the less developed
regions of the world.
It is figures such as these that
caused one writer Manfred Halpern
to describe the situation in these
words: "For the great majority of pea¬
sants, the benefits of the modern age
can be summed up by saying that it
has become harder to die. As a result,
more peasants are probably kept alive
to suffer misery than ever before in
history. With appetites whetted by
the hope of a better life, their present
suffering seems all the harder to bear."
Happily, there is a third basic fact
which is more promising. It is that,
although the volume of international
development assistance has hardly
increased in recent years, a measure
of international solidarity exists, a
solidarity that impels the richer coun¬
tries to assume some of the burdens
of economic and social underdevelop¬
ment.
The aim of the World Employment
Programme is to reverse the trend
towards ever-growing masses of peas¬
ants and slum dwellers who have no
part in development. It will do so partly
by providing them with the skills need¬
ed for productive work and partly
through measures of rural develop¬
ment, industrialization, youth employ¬
ment schemes, investment and interna¬
tional trade. These will enable
developing countries to use more of
their human resources, and so achieve
the prime object of development, which
after all is to bring about a better life
for the people.
The World Employment Programme
will be one of the ILO's principal tasks
for the 1970s our part in what has
already come to be referred to as
the Second Development Decade.
It must be an employment pro¬
gramme because the only path to a
better life in the poorer countries is
productive work by the people them¬
selves. And it must be a world pro¬
gramme because, while the main
burden will be on the developing
countries, the Programme cannot
succeed without help from the indus¬
trialized nations individually through
bilateral programmes and collectively
through the ILO and other international
organizations.
Moreover, the industrialized nations
are themselves faced with some diffi¬
cult employment problems which may
also come within the scope of the
World Employment Programme.
A positive approach to the problems
of employment creation is not new to
the ILO. During the depression of the
1930s the International Labour Confer¬
ence adopted recommendations about
public works and other policies to
increase demand as methods of fight¬
ing unemployment, mainly in the
industrialized countries.
s,llNCE the Second World
War the problems of developing coun¬
tries have come to occupy the centre
of the stage. Training workers and
managers in modern skills has been
the principal and fastest-growing ILO
contribution to the technical assistance
and co-operation programmes of the
1950s and 1960s. Some of the ILO
technical co-operation projects have
had as their aim a direct increase in
employment.
In 1964 the Conference adopted a
convention and a recommendation
concerning employment policy, which
placed special emphasis on the prob¬
lems of poor countries. In 1966 the
Eighth Conference of American States
Members of the ILO adopted the

Hundreds of millions of new jobs must be created before world unemployment can be
brought under control. In Asia alone, it was forecast that 300 million jobs would need
to be found between 1960 and 1980 just to keep the gap from growing wider. This year,
the ILO is launching a World Employment Programme which may help change the pattern of
world employment by training unskilled workers for new types of jobs. In 1963, it created an
International Centre for Advanced Technical and Vocational Training in Turin, Italy (below
left), in which Unesco also collaborates. Geared particularly to the developing countries,
the Centre provides advanced training for workers as well as technicians and managerial
staff. Below right, engineers at the Korean Productivity Centre, Seoul, discuss plans for
developing the electronics industry in the Republic of Korea. Six hundred ILO labour
experts are at work on more than 250 technical co-operation programmes in over 90 countries.

### 58111: A World Employment Programme
WORLD EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMME (Continued)
Changing the global pattern of jobs and skills
10
Ottawa Plan for Human Resources
Development, on which work has
begun.
In this plan, as in a proposed Asian
Manpower Plan and a Jobs and Skills
Programme for Africa, the central
preoccupation is with providing work
and the skills needed for work. These
plans will in fact form the regional
components of the World Employment
Programme.
The World Employment Programme
itself reflects the preoccupations
expressed by the International Labour
Conference in 1967 in a resolution on
ILO technical co-operation for eco¬
nomic and social development. Propos¬
ed by the Workers' Group, that reso¬
lution calls for plans to intensify ILO
action to include "the formulation of
targets in the field of employment and
human resources development and
improvements of conditions of work
and life, as well as the periodical
publication of progress reports in order
to make international action for the
period after the Development Decade
a concerted international attack on
world poverty."
The 50th anniversary of the Interna¬
tional Labour Organization should, the
resolution says, be marked by the start
of "a world plan for employment and
human resources development, setting
forth the objectives and the concrete
measures required by the Internation¬
al Labour Organization to meet urgent
universal economic and social develop¬
ment needs and calling for intens¬
ive and co-ordinated tripartite action
to develop and employ human resour¬
ces, improve conditions of life and
work and develop social institutions."
IT is important, I think, to
stress the social as distinct from purely
economic goals of the World Employ¬
ment Programme. Productive employ¬
ment by itself is very much an econo¬
mic concept. But it leads, through a
better distribution of wealth, to a wider
sharing of the fruits of development
food, shelter, some frugal comfort.
Where poverty is widespread, these
elementary material gains are the first
and almost the only meaning of social
progress.
Methods of economic development
that bring social benefits by providing
work and income for the highest pos¬
sible number of people are infinitely
more attractive than those that do not
do so. Even if it means slower eco¬
nomic growth, employment-oriented
development is to be preferred on
social grounds so long as it does
not result in actual economic stag¬
nation. The World Employment Pro¬
gramme is to explore and exploit all
the existing possibilities of such
development.
There is no clearer and more con¬
crete form of social participation in
development than fruitful employment.
This is not to deny that social particip¬
ation should go much farther and ex¬
tend, for instance, to some form of
consultation on the direction that a
country's development should take.
But for many of the common people
in the developing countries, a chance
to work is the need of the moment.
The adoption of the World Employ¬
ment Programme as the mainspring of
action during the sixth decade of the
ILO's existence is bound to entail
some changes in habits of thought and
work. The main concern will be with
those who do not have work rather
then with those already in employment.
Questions of rural development are
likely to become far more important.
Since other international organiz¬
ations are also concerned with the
factors affecting employment, new
patterns of inter-organizational co¬
operation may be called for. If the
International Labour Conference is to
play its full part in the Programme,
special arrangements may have to be
made for the Conference regularly to
review progress and to make recom¬
mendations for implementation of the
World Employment Programme.
How are the objects of the Pro¬
gramme to be attained? First, a state¬
ment will be drawn up indicating what
is desirable and possible in the way
of employment creation and skill form¬
ation, and proposing the measures
that must be taken by individual coun¬
tries and international organizations to
achieve it.
Next, all the means available to the
ILO will be applied to see that these
measures are in fact taken. Thus,
there will be a first phase in which
a programme of action will be drawn up
and a second phase in which it will
be carried out.
The first phase will involve the sett¬
ing up of targets or, in other words,
hard figures. It will not be a mere
proclamation of the desirability of more
employment and a better qualified
labour force. Rather, it will give
provisional numbers of workers to be
gainfully engaged in specific types of
work by certain future dates from
five to 15 years from now.
Such an estimate cannot be very
precise or detailed, but that does not
mean it must be vague. Within limits,
it will show to what extent the social
evil of unemployment and under¬
employment might be contained and
eventually reduced, if not, five years
from now, then in ten or 15 years.
IHIS quantitative approach
is crucial to the concept of the Pro¬
gramme. It marks the difference bet¬
ween vague intent and firm resolution,
between international charity and true
co-operation for development. The
intention is to help in shaping a clear
and healthy future rather than in
merely relieving present burdens. It
is calculated to inspire modest confi¬
dence in place of resignation and
defeatism.
To set up targets and to develop
concrete programmes of action, many
facts and figures are needed. This
will inevitably take time and effort.
First, there must be some idea of the
trend of population growth, employ¬
ment and unemployment, training and
education, movements of workers bet¬
ween town and country and many
other aspects of the use, non-use,
underdevelopment (and occasionally
overdevelopment) of human resources.
Then comes the task of determining
what can be done to improve future
prospects. Many methods of creat¬
ing work and providing skills are
known in principle, but practical policy¬
making calls for more precise inform¬
ation. For example, certain types of
agrarian reform and of small-scale
industry development may be expect¬
ed to increase employment but ap¬
proximately how much new work are
they likely to create, by what time,
and at what cost? What will the
increase in production be, and how
likely is it that this higher output can
be marketed?
It is essential that certain forecasts
be made for a relatively distant future.
For instance, one cannot know how
to adapt primary education to the true
needs of developing countries without
some notion of what most pupils' later
working life will be like. Nor can
there be a large programme of public
works to absorb idle rural manpower
without some estimate of sales pros¬
pects for the extra output that the
programme would make possible.
How much work and bread a coun¬
try can give its people, and what skills
its workers need, depend largely on

The harsh poverty of seven million Indians who live in the high Andean plateaux led the ILO to
launch the Andean Programme in 1954 in co-operation with other U.N. specialized agencies. This
far-reaching rehabilitation operation attacks the root causes of poverty through a system of
20 "action bases", each one a miniature international operation in itself: the FAO expert teaches new
methods of farming, the WHO medical teams instruct on hygiene, fight disease and improve health
conditions, UNICEF tackles the problem at the children's level, Unesco and the ILO design schools
built largely by the Indians themselves, and ILO specialists teach vocational courses. Under a formula
of "Each one teach one", the ILO trains community leaders to carry on the work after the . .
international experts leave, and gradually national experts from the six countries involved Bolivia, 1 1
Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Argentina are taking over key positions. Encouraged by the I I
positive results of the Andean Programme, the ILO in 1966 inaugurated the Ottawa Plan for Human
Resources Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the first of a series of regional
programmes included in the World Employment Programme. Above, a Peruvian farmer.

WORLD EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMME (Continued)
ILO targets in Second Development Decade
its economic and social structure
on the investments that have been
made in years gone by in the land,
and in the transport, educational and
manufacturing systems. These things
cannot be built up quickly, and once
there they last a long time.
We know that existing structures
in the developing countries do not
enable high levels of employment to
be attained. Better structures can
only be designed in the light of a
fairly clear image of their long-term
use and functions.
The ILO is setting up teams in the
Latin American, Asian and African
regions to assemble and consolidate,
country by country, the existing data
and estimates, and to fill the numerous
gaps. When this information is com¬
plete, programmes of action will be
drawn up for each region, for a number
of sub-regions, and, if requested, for
individual countries. The regional pro¬
grammes will then be consolidated and
presented as the World Employment
Programme a programme of national,
regional and worldwide action.
O,
12
IBVIOUSLY, plans for em¬
ployment creation and skill formation
will have ramifications in the whole
area of economic and social develop¬
ment, in education, agriculture and
general rural development, industrial¬
ization, international trade.
It is for this reason that the World
Employment Programme is regarded
as part of a Second United Nations
Development Decade the ILO's con¬
tribution to the concerted attack of the
United Nations family, during the
1970s, on the problems of under¬
development. This aspect of the
Programme is well illustrated by the
composition of the team already at
work on the Ottawa Plan.
After the regional teams have been
at work for about two years, the first
proposed regional plans will be ready.
They will be crude and incomplete,
subject to continuing review, calling
for further studies. But although
imperfect they will provide something
that does not exist now signposts
showing the directions of policy lead¬
ing to the highest possible level of
employment consistent with approved
economic and social goals and present
and potential skills.
They will propose action by govern¬
ments, by employers' and workers'
organizations, by the ILO and other
international agencies in the fields of
industrialization, rural development,
youth employment, wage policy, train¬
ing and education and international
trade.
They will also indicate what further
efforts will be needed if the expected
results of the proposed programmes
are thought inadequate. And they will
try to show the tragic consequences
that may be expected if the recom¬
mendations are not followed.
It will then be for the ILO to apply
all its means of action to get the
programme carried out. First, there
is the power of the International
Labour Conference to recommend and
persuade. The 1969 anniversary
session of the Conference will be
asked, when discussing my Report, to
examine and give guidance on the
detailed aims and methods of the
World Employment Programme (1).
Next, the 1970 session will examine the
work accomplished in 1968 and 1969.
The Conference will be invited to
endorse the broad lines of the propos¬
ed action programmes. With the full
weight of its prestige, it will then
recommend implementation of these
programmes by all ILO member coun¬
tries. From that moment onwards both
the Conference and the Governing
Body will receive periodic progress
reports showing how far the Confer¬
ence's recommendations have been
followed, and with what results.
Should the targets fail to be attain¬
ed, the Conference and the Governing
Body will be invited to examine the
causes and to propose means of cor¬
rection and improvement. On the other
hand, should results go beyond expec¬
tations, the sights will be set higher
and the targets revised upwards.
Similiarly, in each region, plans and
progress reports will be submitted to
the' ILO Regional Conference and
Advisory Committee concerned. The
influence of these regional bodies can
then be brought to bear on countries
or groups of countries to secure full
and vigorous implementation.
It is obviously on the developing
countries that the main responsibility
will fall in the first instance. But much
will also depend on the industrialized
States, on their multilateral and bilater¬
al assistance programmes and their
trade and investment policies.
The programmes of recommended
action might indeed become the frame¬
work national, regional and world¬
wide into which national bilateral aid
activities could be fitted. Given the
relatively large volume of bilateral aid,
this unifying and co-ordinating function
could be of enormous importance.
The ILO's technical co-operation pro¬
gramme, supported by its research
work, will of course be available at
all times to help countries carry out
the proposed programmes of action.
A certain amount of technical co-oper¬
ation can be provided from the ILO's
own budget. But during the 1960s a
much larger volume of funds for tech¬
nical co-operation has become avail¬
able through the United Nations Devel¬
opment Programme (formed on Jan¬
uary, 1966 by the consolidation of the
Special Fund and the Expanded Pro¬
gramme of Technical Assistance).
I
(1) This issue went to press before the
opening of the Conference.
HE bulk of these latter
funds, insofar as they were available
for ILO action (i.e., currently at an
annual rate of about $20 million), has
always been devoted to training and
other activities that help in increasing
employment. In the years ahead these
funds should constitute a major aid
in the implementation of the Employ¬
ment Programme.
The practical participation of other
international organizations and bilater¬
al aid programmes might also reason¬
ably be foreseen. If other agencies
have taken part in the formulation of
the programmes of action they might
choose to use some of their resources
to help implement the proposed pro¬
grammes. And even in their own work
in the fields of education, agriculture,
investment, trade and so on these
agencies will no doubt want to take
account of the guidelines in the World
Employment Programme for employ¬
ment-oriented development.
Only on this broad front of truly
concerted action does the World
Employment Programme stand any
chance of achieving its goals. So far,
the signs are encouraging. Many
countries and international organiza¬
tions have already expressed their
willingness to join in this world venture.
At the same time, we should be
under no delusions as to the magni¬
tude of the task. The World Employ¬
ment Programme is a most ambitious
undertaking requiring prolonged and
determined effort first and above all
by the ILO and its member countries,
but also by others. Yet a less ambi¬
tious project for advancing social
justice would not have been worthy of
the Organization's 50th anniversary.

### 58116: La Participation': the new language of labour-management relations
The new language
of labour-management relations
'LA PARTICIPATION'
IHE world of labour-man¬
agement relations has been marked
by many changes in the course of the
past five decades. Three major devel¬
opments stand out above the others.
First and foremost, is the new atti¬
tude toward the worker as a human
being in his own right, as an individual
or recognized member of a working
group rather than an impersonal unit
in a production schedule. With this
has come the encouragement of per¬
sonal initiative, the decentralization of
responsibility and increased efficiency.
The second major development has
been the series of important changes
in the basic structure of industry it¬
self or steps leading thereto. The
nationalization of certain industries
and public utilities, the participation
of workers in running publically-owned
enterprises, worker-management and
joint-management systems as well as
other formulas for giving employees
a voice in management all point to a
new interest in structural reforms that
have modified the wage earner's rôle
and indeed the capitalist system itself.
The third major development in
worker-management relations has been
the institution of various procedures
to prevent arbitrary action on the
part of management, such as the right
to organize and bargain collectively,
the right to strike, the right to air
grievances freely and without fear of
reprisals, the right to be protected
against dismissal without due cause,
and the right to a voice in running
an enterprise. All these add up to
a virtual Bill of Rights for working
people in industry.
Like the present-day monarchies,
modern industry has gradually evolved
from the absolutism of the past to a
"constitutional" system under which
authority is exercised in accordance
with a set of principles, criteria and

A share in responsibility at all levels

rules that have been discussed and
agreed upon in advance.
These basic principles are funda¬
mental to any lasting improvement in
human relations in industry. David
Morse, Director-General of the ILO,
underlined this when he told the Inter¬
national Labour Conference in 1954
that, "The essential thing is to give
men a sense of purpose in their work...
Only when they understand how by
their work they contribute to the well-
being of society can they have that
confidence in their own true worth
which is the mark of freedom."
Over the past 50 years, a great deal
of thought and ingenuity has gone into
creating a more human atmosphere
in industry and improving day-to-day
relations between management and
employees. Working people now
know more about such things as their
company's policy and its position in
industry because managers increasing¬
ly recognize that a worker's respect
for his employer and his achievements
has a definite bearing on how efficient¬
ly an enterprise can be run, and
employees who take pride in the know¬
ledge that their work is worthwhile and
who know what their products will be
used for have a better attitude toward
their jobs and get more satisfaction out
of them.
Such a climate of understanding and
confidence, which increases plant effi¬
ciency and improves the worker's sit¬
uation, was emphasized by the Inter¬
national Labour Conference in 1967,
when it urged management to co¬
operate with employees in drawing up
policies of intercommunication that
would ensure a complete and objective
exchange of information.
A successful intercommunication po¬
licy cannot be an afterthought; it
should permeate industry at all levels,
instilling in all concerned the feeling
that they are working together with
a common aim. According to socio¬
logist Richard F. Behrendt of the
Federal Republic of Germany, "Men
living in the last third of the 20th cent¬
ury cannot be expected to do any more
than obey their orders in a mechanical
way unless they understand them and
feel they are justified." They will
respond to leaders with whom they
feel they can work together, and the
ability to kindle this kind of collabor¬
ation is a major quality of success¬
ful management today. Carried further,
this team spirit becomes "participative
management," a concept that stimulates
individual creativity and initiative by
encouraging workers to participate in
company activities.
P,ARTICIPATIVE manage¬
ment flourishes when industry is organ¬
ized so that as many people as possi¬
ble, at every level, share in responsib¬
ility. Two principles often used by
modern industry as guidelines are that
decisions should be taken at the
lowest possible level where the
problems are encountered and that
those who shoulder responsibility
should also be given corresponding
authority. This approach calls for
some basic rethinking by many execut¬
ives who still tend to hoard their
power.
Nevertheless, private enterprise is
undergoing far-reaching changes, and
the promotion of the status of workers
and their increased influence in man
agement are firmly established prin¬
ciples, although it is still not clearly
understood how they should be
applied.
A totally different approach to
labour-management relations has oc¬
curred in countries which have either
done away with private enterprise
altogether or at least made far-reach¬
ing changes in its character. In the
U.S.S.R. and the countries of Eastern
Europe, for example, industry and com¬
merce operate under a system based
on a centrally planned economy and
a unified trade union movement. Yet,
several of these countries differ con¬
siderably in the way they run their
industries.
In the U.S.S.R., the director bears
sole responsibility for the plant's
operation although in most personnel
matters he shares his authority with
the trade unions, and the workers have
a say in planning and production.
Yugoslavia introduced a system of
employees' self-management in 1950
with all workers sharing in manage¬
ment through their elected delegates
a fundamental right that is embodied in
the Yugoslav constitution of 1963.
Poland has had a worker-manage¬
ment system since 1958. The worker-
management conference, made up of
members of the works trade union com¬
mittee, the Communist party executive
committee and the Workers' Council
(elected by the employees), super¬
vises the overall running of the in¬
dustry, and takes general policy de¬
cisions.
Since 1968, industrial management
boards in Romania have been compos-

AGAINST RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
For 50 years, the ILO has fought to win equal
pay and conditions for all workers irrespective
of race and colour. In 1958, it adopted
a convention against discrimination in
employment that has been ratified by 67 member
states. Similar action by Unesco led to the
adoption of a convention against discrimination
in education, now ratified by 50 member states.

ed of the manager, senior supervisory
staff, engineers and other specialists,
as well as the chairman of the trade
union committee and workers' repre¬
sentatives elected for two years.
But in other countries, workers are
assured a place on managerial or
supervisory boards of industry, some¬
times on an equal basis with share¬
holders, such as in the coal mining
and iron and steel industries of the
Federal Republic of Germany. And
in the United Arab Republic, employees
have equal representation on the
boards of public industry.
In other cases, workers have the
right to occupy only a minority of the
seats on boards of management or
supervision, such as under the general
system in force in the Federal Repub¬
lic of Germany, in Austria, and in the
French nationalized industries. Other
schemes guarantee worker representa¬
tion in the management of public in¬
dustries in the Syrian Arab Repub¬
lic and Mali.
In the past few years, industrial
reform has been widely debated in
many countries, particularly in Western
Europe. Trade unions in the Federal
Republic of Germany have run into
stiff opposition from employers, as they
call for the extension of joint-manage¬
ment to ail large companies. In Austria,
despite the efforts of the unions, joint-
management in industry has not yet
been introduced, while in the Nether¬
lands, the three main trade union
organizations urge that boards of
management should reflect the in¬
terests of investors and labour alike.
And in the United Kingdom, the Trades
Union Congress has gone into this
problem in a number of proposals
to the Royal Commission on Trade
Unions and Employers' Associations.
In France, the whole question of
workers' participation has been in the
forefront of political discussion for
some years. After the événements
of May, 1968, and the announcement
of widespread reforms which followed,
there was strong reaction to a plan
to introduce a new approach to in¬
dustrial organization. It involved three
separate elements: a worker's co¬
operative, an associated shareholders'
company, and a board of management
which would be responsible to a super¬
visory board representing both the
shareholders and the workers.
T,HE French National Em¬
ployers' Council opposed the plan,
stating that participation was insepar¬
ably bound up with efficiency and did
not include sharing control of the
company or becoming embroiled in
arguments which would hopelessly
mire efficiency. They felt that effi¬
ciency required one chain of command
under the control of the head of the
firm, who either owns it or is res¬
ponsible to the shareholders. They
admitted, though, that he had to de¬
legate a great deal of authority to his
supervisory staff and keep his em¬
ployees informed at all times.
Despite the fact that these some¬
what tentative developments have rais¬
ed the working man to a new position
in industry, the question of his parti¬
cipation in management has not yet
been completely settled.,.
In tackling the problem of labour-
management relations, the International
Labour Organization has been able to
isolate certain constant factors, despite
political and economic differences in
various countries. Over the past
50 years, it has played a decisive rôle
in promoting labour legislation through
international labour conventions and
recommendations. Most of these legal
instruments have set down minimum
standards of protection for workers
which, in the case of conventions,
must be followed by member states
that have ratified them, or which serve
as guidelines if incorporated in re¬
commendations.
The problems raised by changing
employer-worker relations are of
direct concern to the International
Labour Organization which, since it
was established, has stimulated recog¬
nition of the trade union movement and
contributed to its growth: international
standards adopted in 1948 and 1949
(the first ratified by 76 States, the
second by 84) were conceived to
protect freedom of association and
promote the right to organize and
bargain collectively, and in 1970, the
International Labour Conference will
draw up regulations to protect workers'
representatives in industry and pro¬
vide facilities for them.
Today, workers in industrial countries
are anxious to find new methods of
collective bargaining which would
strengthen trade union influence in
industry. The Royal Commission on
Trade Unions and Employers' Asso¬
ciations (1965-1968) went into the ques¬
tion in some detail, pointing out that
the United Kingdom has two systems
of industrial relations.

'LA PARTICIPATION' (Continued)
Protection against unjustified dismissal
One is the formal, industry-wide col¬
lective agreement concerned with
settling pay, hours of work and
employment conditions, while the other
is an informal system born of the
actual behaviour of trade unions and
employers' associations, of managers,
shop stewards and workers. These
systems are often at odds with each
other since bargaining that takes place
within factories is mainly outside the
control of employers' associations and
trade unions.
The Royal Commission strongly
favours collective bargaining at the
factory level to regulate pay, form
negotiating committees and draw up
grievance procedures according to
local conditions, as well as deal with
such questions as reductions in per¬
sonnel, discipline and the rights and
obligations of shop stewards.
T,
16
HERE is a tendency in
some countries with long experience of
collective bargaining at this level like
the United States and Canada to
extend negotiations to include matters
that used to be decided exclusively by
management, such as the introduction
of technological change. When the
employees of Canadian National Rail¬
ways went on strike in October, 1964,
the investigating commission re¬
commended that management should
postpone technological changes until
the unions had been informed and
given the opportunity to negotiate
on them.
The right to strike is not dealt with
specifically in international labour
conventions. However, it is clearly
affirmed in the legislation and even
the constitutions of a number of
countries, and it is embodied in the
European Social Charter, drafted in
co-operation with the ILO and signed
in 1961 by the member states of the
Council of Europe. It is not surprising
that there are no international regula¬
tions on the right to strike: even on
a national level, they are difficult to
formulate.
The concept of the strike is difficult
to pin down in precise legal terms
because of the variety of situations
and purposes that can be involved.
And in addition to strikes called by
unions in support of claims put for¬
ward in collective bargaining, there
are "wildcat" or "unofficial" strikes,
not backed by trade unions.
To exercise the right to strike,
especially where essential services
are involved, presents problems which
are sometimes out of proportion to the
issues at stake. Because of the lack
of universally binding standards to
postpone or settle industrial strikes,
there is a great deal of interest in the
methods used in different countries,
and the International Labour Office is
preparing a comparative study of
these procedures.
Labour legislation and trade union
efforts have not only secured certain
rights for workers' representatives to
negotiate with management on an
equal footing, but they also shield the
workers themselves against arbitrary
action and defend their right to fair
treatment and protection against undue
loss of their jobs.
In 1967, the International Labour
Conference formally recognized that
any worker has the right to submit
his grievances without fear of reprisals,
and have them dealt with according to
accepted procedures.
The second point that no worker
should be arbitrarily deprived of his
job was internationally recognized
in 1963 when the International Labour
Conference adopted a recommendation
stipulating that no employee should
be dismissed without a valid reason
connected with his capacity or
conduct, or based on the operational
requirements of his employer.
This was a major step forward from
the traditional belief that an employer,
having hired a worker for an indefinite
period of time, did not have to justify
firing him, so long as he gave sufficient
notice.
The principle that dismissals must
be justified, already written into the
laws of countries like the Federal
Republic of Germany, Norway and the
U.S.S.R., has made definite progress
since the 1963 recommendation was
adopted and has been incorporated
in new laws passed in Italy and Cyprus.
In the United Kingdom, the Royal
Commission on Trade Unions and
Employers' Associations, in outlining
the safeguards that workers should
have to protect themselves against
unjustified dismissal, felt that voluntary
procedures should be developed and
extended. In addition, a majority of
the Commission members also re¬
commended passing legislation similar
to the ILO recommendation against
unfair dismissal.
This recommendation maintains that
any working man "who feels that his
employment has been unjustifiably
terminated" should be entitled to
appeal within a reasonable time "to a
body established under a collective
agreement or to a neutral body such
as a court, an arbitrator, an arbitration
committee or a similar body" with
the power to examine the case and
decide if the dismissal was justified.
If it decides against dismissal, it
should also have the authority to order
that the worker concerned, unless
reinstated (and, where appropriate,
with back payment of wages), should
be paid adequate compensation or
awarded some other form of relief.
However, the ILO recommendation
does not advocate that such bodies
should have a say in determining the
size of a firm's work force. In other
words, even if an employee's conduct
and work are satisfactory, he can be
dismissed simply because the work
he does is no longer necessary.
At a time of accelerated technical
change and increased competition, it
is generally recognized that an
industrial society must extend its
manpower mobility in order to keep
expanding: under a social policy
aimed at the greatest good for the
greatest number of people, the
principle that a worker must be kept
in the same job is no longer considered
justified; guaranteed earnings and
employment security in general are
more important than job security.
According to the International Labour
Conference of 1964, structural changes
should be made for two reasons:
"to obtain the greatest benefit from
economic and technical progress; (and)
to protect from financial or other hard¬
ship, groups and individuals whose
employment is affected by structural
changes."
To help unneeded workers to
maintain their incomes, find new work
and, if necessary, acquire the skills for
a different type of work is now
becoming an essential objective of
employment policy.
IN the industrial battle that
goes on in modern society where
groups of workers may suddenly be¬
come innocent victims just because
they are "surplus" or their skills have
become obsolete, there is a humane
obligation to help the unemployed on
the grounds that "we owe it to them".
The new principle of social justice that
now seems to be gaining acceptance
is that since society as a whole bene¬
fits from economic progress it is only
fair that it should also bear the social
cost.
The right of workers to participate
in running the firm they work for is
another feature of their improved
position in industry. Employees have
become more closely associated with
plant operations through such bodies
as works committees or councils
which are usually advisory in character,
at least in economic matters. In some
European countries, laws on such
worker-participation were passed after
the First World War, but it was only
during and after the Second World
War that the movement developed on
a large scale.
In 1952, the International Labour
Conference adopted a recommendation
which called for the promotion of
consultation and co-operation between
employers and workers at company
## [Page 17](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/078245engo.pdf#page=17) 0
### 58116: La Participation': the new language of labour-management relations
level on matters which did not fall
within the scope of collective bar¬
gaining or that was not normally dealt
with by other existing methods of
settling terms and conditions of
employment.
Some years later, in reviewing this
recommendation, the ILO predicted
that consultation and collaboration
schemes in industry could be expected
to grow and play an increasingly
important part in management.
L,.EGISLATION now provides
for such collaboration in Austria, Belg¬
ium, the Congo (Kinshasa), Finland,
France, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many, Iraq, the Netherlands, Spain,
Tanzania and Tunisia. In other coun¬
tries where there are no binding laws
on the subject, there are nation-wide
agreements between central trade
union organizations and employers'
confederations as in Denmark, Norway,
Sweden and Italy, or agreements on
a voluntary basis, as in the United
Kingdom, Canada and India.
The workers' right to a share in the
profits of industry, safeguarded in a
number of countries by law, collective
agreements or on a voluntary basis,
is further proof of the change in
relationship between employers and
employees. One method is to assist
them to buy shares either in the firm
they work for or in another company
so that they can join the ranks of
shareholders and further the spread
of "people's capitalism".
A recent example of this trend is
a French law passed in 1967 which
makes it compulsory to give wage
earners a share in the benefits of the
expansion of any industry employing
more than 100 persons. This gives
the workers a "new right" based on
the idea that progress through common
efforts should be for the common
benefit if an employer uses the need
to plough back profits as a reason for
refusing wage increases, workers have
a certain claim to the resulting
increase in assets.
This legislation is similar to statutory
and contractual schemes introduced in
the Federal Republic of Germany to
encourage workers to invest.
There is a strong reaction against
the dehumanization of the worker
caused by conditions In modern
industrial plants. But if the ration¬
alization of production contributes to
reducing the working man to the level
of a tool, then his new rights help to
guarantee his dignity and a genuine
human existence.
Many observers acknowledge that
it is not necessary to abolish private
enterprise in order to improve the

FREEDOM TO ORGANIZE
AND THE RIGHT TO STRIKE
Over the past few decade«, labour legislation and trade union action
have combined to win recognition for the working man's rights so
that he can bargain with management on an equal basis. Workers now
also have safeguards that protect them against arbitrary action
such as unjustified dismissal, job insecurity and excessive working hours.
There are no international regulations governing the right
to strike, but the ILO has implicitly recognized the right

'LA PARTICIPATION' (Continued)
workers' lot fundamentally. The
French sociologist, Pierre Drouin,
maintains that "The evidence goes to
show that it is not the system of
industrial ownership that alienates
man . . . but quite simply the system
of production itself." Despite the fact
that some recent reforms have been
enacted to make shareholders out of
employees, the problem nowadays in
labour-management relations is as
much, if not more, a question of
"power" as of "ownership", and there
is a growing feeling that workers
should have a certain power in industry
by virtue of the fact that they are
employees.
But the problem remains whether
additional power for workers should
be exercised from outside the plant
through trade unions, or from inside
through worker representation on
management or supervisory bodies, or
by both methods simultaneously.
Once trade unions begin to operate
at the plant level and are able to
conclude collective agreements cover¬
ing questions formerly considered the
sole concern of management, the
workers' influence on management's
decisions will be much the same as
if they sat on managerial or super¬
visory boards.
H.

IOWEVER clear-cut it may
seem at first sight, the choice between
sharing responsibility and defending
the workers' interests does not. mean
that the two alternatives are strictly
separated. The fact that workers take
part in management does not rule out
the need for machinery to defend their
interests as employees. The emphasis
now placed in Yugoslavia on the
autonomy of the trade union movement
and on the fact that its chief responsi¬
bility is to protect the workers'
interests vis à vis the state and mana¬
gement, clearly shows that the aboli¬
tion of private enterprise and the
transfer of managerial power to the
workers do not necessarily exclude
conflict between those who give
orders and those who take them.
Even when trade unions are con¬
cerned only with their members'
interests, they tend to enlarge the
scope of bargaining to include prob¬
lems whose compexity forces them
to take the interests of industry into
account: if they didn't, the success of
future bargaining would be impaired.
One conclusion that clearly emerges
from the analysis of the three major
developments that have marked
employer-worker relations in the
past five decades is their growing
interaction. In order to bring about
more lasting improvements, isolated
measures are usually not enough; what
is often needed is to operate on all
three levels at the same time: the
reorganization of industry, better
methods of protecting the worker and
the human factors involved.

SAFETY AND HEALTH
ON THE JOB
The ILO continues to wage, a world campaign for more
and better safety devices and health precautions
on the job to meet new problems caused by today's
technological development. Since 1930, the ILO has
adopted a series of recommendations aimed at
eliminating silicosis, an occupational disease of miners.
Below, miners take a break at the pit bottom.
Measures proposed by the ILO have effectively reduced
other industrial hazards including lead poisoning,
a menace to painters and typesetters, and phosphorus
poisoning, once a threat to workers in the match-making
industry. But each year, the production and use of
new chemical substances creates fresh toxic dangers.
New measures are needed also to control noise
and improve poor working and living conditions which
cause tension and increase psychic and cardiovascular
illness. On the other hand, many dangerous jobs
have become safer: In the construction industry, rivetters
working on skyscrapers are protected by security
nets (photo left), and in the iron and steel industry,
special heat-resistant suits protect workers near
to high temperature steel furnaces (below left). An
international occupational safety and health information
centre was set up under the auspices of the ILO in
1960, and this summer it is organizing an international
congress to study fire protection in the factory,
safety and health in small firms, on farms and in the timber
industry, and safety and health training.

PEOPLE
NO LONGER
MACHINES
IN LABOUR
RELATIONS
by Jean de Givry
F,
20
IFTY years ago, the Pre¬
amble to the ILO Constitution laid its
chief emphasis on the need to improve
working conditions. Twenty-five years
later, the Declaration of Philadelphia
adopted by the ILO General Confer¬
ence in 1944 reaffirmed this principle
and proclaimed that "labour is not
a commodity."
No one can deny that the situation
of workers, especially in the industrial¬
ized countries, has improved consid¬
erably in terms of wages, working
hours, safety and health and holidays
with pay. The number of international
labour conventions adopted and rati¬
fied in many countries points to the
advances made in all these fields.
But surely the principle that labour
Is not a commodity has far wider
implications than the improvement of
working conditions. Does it not also
mean that the worker is not merely
an instrument, that he refuses to be
treated like a machine or buffeted by
forces or decisions over which he has
no control.
It is clear that considerable progress
will be needed before working peo¬
ple take their place as full-fledged
members of industrial society and con¬
sider that they have an effective say in
running it instead of being caught up
in its coils and suffering the conse¬
quences of its fluctuations.
During the French student revolt of
May 1968, which sparked off an unpre¬
cedented wave of social upheaval, the
walls of university faculties were
blazoned with slogans of all kinds.
Alongside many of doubtful merit
there was one that said: "a proletarian
is someone who has no say in the
use made of his life, and knows it."
A statement that defines a prolet¬
arian not in terms of lack of wealth or
possessions, but as someone denied
the power to choose freely, should
give us cause for reflection. Doubly
so, since it shows quite clearly that
one of the basic claims of working
people in the second half of the
twentieth century may well be and
already is in certain countries for a
share in economic power, the right
to a say in running the economy
and thereby means of controlling its
repercussions on their employment.
This demand goes far beyond a mere
Improvement in living standards or
working conditions, for it affects the
motive force of the whole economic
system. It is therefore far more diffi¬
cult to meet and is not likely to lend
itself to the kind of simplified or uni¬
versal solution prescribed by certain
ideological slogans.
In the field of industrial relations, as
in others, there may be "different but
equally effective ways and means of

handling a specific problem, depending
on the historical development, the
political system, the level of economic
and social development, the concepts,
values and overall structure of labour
relations in a given country."
This was the conclusion reached
recently by an ILO meeting on the
rights of trade union representatives
and the participation of workers in
decisions in Industrial plants.
With the evolution of labour-man¬
agement relations, there is now a better
understanding of the different func¬
tions of workers' representatives, and
it is recognized that in order to carry
out these duties they are entitled to
certain safeguards and facilities.
There is also a clearer apprecia¬
tion though this is still by no means
universal of the economic and social
realities of the industrial plant itself
and of the obligations its management
must respect in order to produce more
and better quality goods at lower
prices.
The emphasis now laid on the in-

AUTOMATION Row uP°n row of machines200 in allare controlled by a single woman
in this textile factory. Since 1955, the ILO has studied the social
implications of automation, created by the rise of the industrial society. As automation is
introduced in plants and factories workers face new problems; some will have to learn different
working methods or transfer to other jobs. Many young people looking for work often lack the
qualifications now demanded by industry. The need to retrain workers for the industries of tomorrow
will become a growing problem as automation develops.
dustrial plant is a distinctive feature
of modern industrial relations. The
trend in this direction was noted as
long ago as 1956 by a meeting of spe¬
cialists called by the ILO to draw up
guidelines for dealing with problems
of industrial and human relations.
Observers of the industrial scene
have also pointed out that in systems
of industrial relations as different as
those of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.,
collective agreements however dis¬
similar their content are reached in
both cases at the factory level. In
the developing countries, with few
exceptions, collective agreements are
also concluded at this level.
In certain European countries, too,
trade union action at the factory level
has been steadily re-enforced during
the past decade. The most recent
example is the recommendation by
the Royal Commission on Trade Unions
and Employers' Associations in the
U.K. that the centre of gravity of col¬
lective bargaining should be shifted
down to the plant level.
In any case, the economic and social
character of the factory has changed
radically since the First World War.
At that time an industrial plant was
nearly always a privately owned con¬
cern. But today we find a tremen¬
dous number of publicly owned indus¬
trial and commercial businesses side
by side with those in the private indus¬
trial sector.
This applies not only to the social¬
ist countries which have abolished
private ownership in industrial pro¬
duction, but also to a number of Wes¬
tern countries which have nationalized
major sectors of industry, and to the
developing countries where the State,
as the driving force behind develop¬
ment, is often the principal employer.
Reporting to the governing body of
the ILO in 1955, the Committee on
Freedom of Employers' and Workers'
Associations noted: "the fact that a
business is being run profitably or at
a loss is one of the factors on which
the efficiency of its management should
be judged. It is probable that the pro
fit motive operates more directly and
actively in a privately owned business
than one in public hands, whatever
form the public control may take.
"Yet the profit motive is not absent
in socialized industry, and it is clear
that in most countries steps are taken
to see that directors and managerial
staffs of public Industries are held
directly responsible for the efficient
running of the industry in their charge.
In doing so, they undoubtedly exper¬
ience many of the problems faced by
employers and managers In private
industry."
The number of common problems
encountered by management in social¬
ized industries and management in
private firms has been growing since
several socialist countries introduced
economic reforms designed to give
greater autonomy to industries within
the structure of the national economy.
That managements of factories
under public and private management
alike are now seen to have increasing¬
ly similar objectives is surely of great

PEOPLE NO LONGER MACHINES (Continued)
The growing separation of management from ownership
22
significance from the standpoint of
future developments in industrial rela¬
tions at the factory level. The reason
Is that it inevitably focuses attention
on the similarity of production and
development problems facing factory
managements rather than on differen¬
ces arising from forms of ownership.
One of its first effects should be to
promote a better understanding of the
specific function of the factory, without
which it would be unrealistic to hope
for any lasting improvement in rela¬
tions between staff and management.
All too often the factory is thought
of in terms of the "profit" it must
earn in order to subsist. But the
term profit is ambiguous. In some
cases it is used to indicate how much
the factory has earned, that is, the
income represented by the difference
between receipts from sales and the
cost of goods or services supplied.
In others, it may be used to designate
the returns from capital invested, and
in this case it conjures up In many
minds the image of working people
being exploited and even defrauded.
One employer recently summed up
the views of certain factory executives
on this question as follows: "To talk of
profits is sordid and debasing. It is
best left to the managing director who
has to talk in terms of 'profits' when
explaining to shareholders how his
'business' is doing."
But on the whole, executives and
still more so technicians and working
staff influenced by trade union views
do not feel so strongly about the
question. They make a distinction
between the factory where the talk is
exclusively on technical matters, and
the "business" where, unfortunately,
the only thing talked about is profit.
Yet profit, or to use a word with less
emotional overtones, viability is some¬
thing no factory can do without. One
might reasonably object to the way
it is allocated or shared out, but not to
its existence, for it is the yardstick
of efficiency and good management.
Indeed, one of the first qualifications
for the director of any factory is his
ability to make it pay.
The fact that recent economic re¬
forms in the socialist countries have
stressed the decisive importance of
profits as a criterion of output and an
incentive to production (1), may help
employees, to see more clearly that
(1) E. G. Llberman : "The role of profits
in the Industrial incentive system of the
U.S.S.R., International Labour Review,
No. 1. Jan. 1968.
profits are positive symptoms of a fac¬
tory's state of health.
But in view of the way some work¬
ing people instinctively react to the
mere mention of the word "profit", it
might be as well to revise our voca¬
bulary and, with a double advantage
of clarifying the true function of the
factory, substitute the idea of "econo¬
mic creativeness" recently proposed
by one economist. According to his
definition, "economic creativeness is
the efficient and increasing production
and distribution of goods and ser¬
vices . . . This concept comprises cur¬
rent production and future progress,
the methods used and their results,
the individual and social aspects of
entrepreneurship." (2)
A second consequence of the
changing concepts of factory manage¬
ment is acceptance of the fact that,
irrespective of the economic system,
management is now a science requir¬
ing special aptitudes and skills. Proof
of this is seen in the great number of
management schools opened in the
last 15 years in industrial and develop¬
ing countries alike.
A third consequence, which stems
directly from the second, is that man¬
agers, conscious of their position and
responsibilities, are increasingly set on
freeing themselves of excessively
strict controls exercised by the owners
of the factories they direct.
In the socialist countries, as already
mentioned, there has been a move
towards reducing State control over
certain industries, to give them In¬
creased powers of decision and
greater autonomy. In a number of
highly industrialized Western coun¬
tries, many observers have remarked
on the increasing separation of owner¬
ship from management. This has led
to the gradual emergence of a new
class of managers, who regard them¬
selves as professional directors with
a responsibility to the employees and
the public as well as to the owners.
In other Western countries, heated
discussions on industrial reforms re¬
flect a desire for the factory and its
managers to be given a status that
would make them something more
than mere tools of the owners. It is
a significant sign of the times that
shortly after last year's social upheaval
in France, the French Young Employers'
(2) Philippe de Woot: "Pour une Doctrine
de l'Entreprise" (Editions du Seuil, Paris,
1968).
Centre decided to change its name to
Young Managers' Centre, and issued
a statement declaring that "the powers
of management are not derived from
ownership alone."
In this search for a new status for
the industrial plant one thing at least
seems to be beyond dispute the need
for unity of command as a condition of
efficient management. Recognition of
this imperative has been a major fac¬
tor in the gradual evolution in recent
years from the Idea of joint manage¬
ment to that of joint supervision of
management. The real crux of the
problem seems to be not so much the
authority to be exercised by manage¬
ment as whether it has earned the
confidence of all who have a stake in
the prosperity of the factory, to whom
it should feel responsible for its ac¬
tions, and by what means it should
keep the staff informed on the way
it runs the business.
This brings me to my last point.
Until now, the paramount concern in
industrial relations has been the prob¬
lem of sharing out the benefits of
production. The organization and

than one-quarter of

participate in a great

and has elaborated
various conventions

health conditions on the
job, to mention only

a special study on the
effects of automation

as industry (see also

purpose of production has usually
played a minor rôle in relations bet¬
ween employers and workers.
Without overlooking the need for a
fairer distribution of benefits (a pre¬
requisite of which is full acceptance
in the factory of mechanisms to defend
the workers' interest), should we not
also seeks ways of associating all
parties more closely with the control
of production which would make
easier its adaptation to the needs of
the community and the demands of a
balanced economic and social develop¬
ment, nationally and internationally.
It is surely significant that whereas
50 years ago, in the Preamble to the
ILO Constitution, peace was defined in
terms of "justice" ("whereas univer¬
sal and lasting peace can be establish¬
ed only if it is based upon social
justice"), nowadays it is Increasingly
defined in terms of "development".
There Is nothing surprising about
this, for in most countries development
is clearly the fundamental prerequisite
of justice. As a key factor in deve¬
lopment,' industries have therefore a
new and worthwhile task to accom¬
plish: the promotion of greater jus¬
tice for all. Viewed in this perspec¬
tive, they are no longer merely the
source of profits to be shared out in
the fairest way, but also an instrument
of progress to be utilized for the bene¬
fit of the greatest number and in the
interest not of a single nation but of
the whole world.
This new rôle of industry is bound
to affect the pattern of relations bet¬
ween all those engaged in production.
It will still be necessary, of course, to
make sure that production benefits are
distributed fairly, and a key task for
labour representatives will be to see,
through labour-management agree¬
ments, that the interest of working
people as regards job security, work¬
ing conditions and wages are properly
safeguarded.
But today, international economic
relations are intensifying, common
markets are being formed, industries
are merging or forging links across
frontiers, and throughout the world the
needs of developing countries have
forced themselves on the conscience
of all men, whether statesmen, em¬
ployers or workers. At such a time
it Is surely vital for working people
to express their views through direct
participation in boards of management
where production policy is decided.
Such participation should aim not
only at protecting the interests of
workers in the factories concerned. It

should reflect the common Interests
of all workers so as to give a posi¬
tive orientation to economic develop¬
ment and lay the foundations for a
more just society in which the needs
of all can be satisfied.
In countries which are planning
their economic and social develop¬
ment, workers already have a voice
in the councils where national policies
are drawn up. But if this voice is to
speak with authority, it should surely
be backed up by experience acquired
in industry, and particularly in large-
scale industrial enterprises.
To put these principles into prac¬
tice will not be easy. It is clear that
new structures and systems will have
to be established, new outlooks fos¬
tered and a vast enterprise of educa¬
tion and training set in motion. But
it would not be surprising if the search
for these solutions became a key fac¬
tor in worker-employer relations bet¬
ween now and end of the century.

In most civilizations and throughout
history, women were considered
to be the intellectual and moral
inferior of men and laws relegated them
to the status of a perpetual minor.
They were expected to devote
themselves to having children and to
household chores and only rarely were
they given a chance to distinguish
themselves in the arts, sciences, letters
or politics. Although many new
vocations have been opened up to
them 27 out of every 100 women
work outside their homes working
women still face enormous problems to
achieve equality of treatment. Their
new rôle in society and economic
life has still to win wider recognition.
But nowadays, in families where
women work outside the home, the
husband lends a hand more willingly
than in the past. Above, a
helmeted woman engineer working in
a coal and steel complex. Right, a
young father whose wife also
has a career takes his turn at

### 58122: Real and pseudo problems of the working woman
by Pierrette Sartin
Real and pseudo problems
of the working woman
T,_ HE history of the work¬
ing woman is pretty much fami¬
liar to the specialist but not too
well known by the vast general public.
While no attempt will be made here
to trace this history, I should like to
touch on one or two major aspects
of the problem as it affects the working
woman in the modern world.
Paradoxically, while many of the
working woman's real problems are
either ignored or shrugged off by
governments and others concerned
with their status, the pseudo-problems
seem to have aroused most debate
thereby retarding the real solutions.
The history of the working woman
has been a long, drawn-out struggle,
often carried on silently and behind
the scenes, against prejudice, privi¬
lege, vested interests, and force of
habit. Despite all his advances,
scientific and otherwise, 20th century
man has not lost all his cave-man
attitudes and socially speaking he still
has a long way to go.
I believe there has never been a
full, objective analysis made of the
working woman's contribution to the
economic structure of society, but
even in this context it really boils
down to a question of ethics indi¬
vidual and social ethics, the struggle
for equality, for the dignity of the
individual person and respect for
human values as defined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and defended for decades by the U.N.
agencies, and first of all by the ILO,
now celebrating its 50th anniversary.
In our present age of science and
super-rationalism, equal rights for all
persons regardless of sex or race are
still opposed by strong economic
forces and age-old notions of male
privilege. This opposition is not
always openly expressed so that it
is not easy to combat. It hides behind
indirect statements with an ideological
flavour, distorted facts and fictitious
PIERRETTE SARTIN is a French sociologist
teaching at Laval University, Quebec (Cana¬
da). She has written widely on the social
status of women and industrial employment.
Her latest book "La Femme Libérée T has
¡ust appeared (Editions Stock, Pans, 1969).
Among her other works: "La Promotion des
Femmes" (Editions Hachette, Paris. 1962)
and "La Fatigue Industrielle" (Editions
Sadep, Paris, 1960).
evidence which help to fan passions
and perpetuate foggy thinking.
Any serious study of the position
of the working woman in modern
society reveals this picture of pre¬
judice, distorted views, irrational and
illogical attitudes.
The fact is that there is not just one
problem of the working woman but a
whole mosaic of problems, some
technical, others moral, social and
economic. All of them interlock and
cannot be dissociated from the deve¬
lopment of modern society as a whole.
They demonstrate the great disparity
that exists between the extraordinary
advances in science and technology
and the narrow-minded, cautious
conservatism of man's thinking.
The working woman and her place
in society have become a sort of
geometric focal point where contra¬
dictions and half-truths, hasty generali¬
zations and unfounded conclusions are
all concentrated in one jumble.
E,.VEN the expression "work¬
ing woman" is misleading. Women
have always worked from time imme¬
morial, and many city women who stay
at home work at least 54 hours a week
if they have no children and as much
as 77 hours a week if they have three
children (1). This has been corro¬
borated recently by two separate
studies carried out by Alain Girard and
Henri Bastide, both of France.
No social legislation in the world
would tolerate such working hours
imposed by an employer.
Yet because the work is done in
the seclusion of the home, and is
unpaid, it is accepted without argument
and even encouraged, even though
the level of productivity is low and
in certain cases of doubtful usefulness.
The phrase "working woman" should
therefore be understood as meaning
paid work performed outside the home
in our analysis of some of the real
and pseudo problems involved.
What then is the present situation
as regards the working women and
how does it differ from that of pre¬
ceding generations?
(1) Corresponding figures for rural women
are 63 and 82 hours a week respectively, and
as high as 80 and 87 hours for farmers' wives.
In virtually all societies the pattern
has been the same, following a course
from work in agriculture to the
so-called secondary sector of industry,
and from industry to the tertiary sector
of commerce, office work and services.
Industrialization has created a
growing number and variety of jobs
suited to an increasing army of women.
It has also led to a reduction in heavy
manual labour in favour of jobs requir¬
ing skill and dexterity.
More and more jobs, however, are
now opening up to women in the ter¬
tiary sector of commerce and other
services.
This increase in the number of
working women is not limited to
Western countries. In Japan the pro¬
portion of women holding jobs has
risen 100 per cent in 10 years as
compared to only a 40 per cent rise
for men; in Morocco, radical changes
are affecting the mass of the population
and one woman out of eight now holds
a paid job; in Tunisia, a bold
programme launched by President
Bourguiba has opened up professional
education and training to women; in
India, where women have long
campaigned for a change in economic
policy that recognizes their right to
work, the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira
Gandhi, has come out openly in their
support and taken measures to
guarantee them increased educational
opportunities as a first step in their
liberation.
In Latin America, the big birth rate
plus the often high percentage of
illegitimate children, obliges many
women to look for work. It is to be
hoped that the economic and social
development of this region will go
hand in hand with a real programme
of professional training for Latin
American women.
In certain Asian and African
countries, the position of women has
risen sharply and in recent years they
have even reached the top of the
political ladder in contrast with West¬
ern countries where women neverthe¬
less have long been put on a pedestal.
The improvement of the status of
women, despite the great differences
obtaining in different countries, is thus __
a world-wide phenomenon that cannot j*s
be denied. This trend is bound to *
continue. But for the moment it
affects only a tiny minority of women.

WORKING WOMAN (Continued)
Cutting off one's No's, to spite one's case
26
In the Moslem countries of Africa and
Asia, women who occupy posts
habitually held by men are the
exception; ingrained tradition still
keeps the great majority in a position
of inferiority or subordination.
So, contrary to the generally held
belief, women have not invaded
the labour market. Although precise
figures are not available for a com¬
parative study it can be said that dep¬
ending on the country and the social
system, women now represent 20 to
30 per cent of the world's total labour
force with peaks of about 40 per cent
in the socialist countries.
Even when one person out of three
happens to be a woman this does not
constitute an "invasion" or a threat
to the stability of the labour market.
But it is enough (or at least should
be) to convince any State to take
practical steps as opposed to mere
lip service to solve the economic and
social problems of those women who
want to be wives and mothers and
at the same time help increase their
family income. Or to put it another
way, who at the same time want to
put their knowledge and skills at the
service of their community.
The biggest change that has taken
place in recent years in the world
picture of the working woman is the
extraordinary increase of married
women and mothers in employment in
all countries and the fact that women
who do not have to do so for financial
reasons are flocking into professional
and other work.
Here, the example of what has been
taking place in Canada is worth special
mention. All over Canada, a formi¬
dable number of women with large
family responsibilities are going back
to school or college, attending courses
and taking degrees in order to prepare
themselves for jobs and professions.
The Canadian Government has encou¬
raged this movement by offering spe¬
cial retraining courses and other adult
education programmes at hours of the
day or evening particularly geared to
a woman's family obligations. This is
an experiment that certainly deserves
attention in other countries where it
could well inspire similar efforts.
The tremendous influx of middle-
class women into professional life has
brought with it a marked change in
attitude to work itself: it has ceased
to be regarded as an inescapable
necessity and has become a self-
chosen activity freely and willingly
accepted. As it gradually shed its
coercive character the stigma formerly
attached to it by years of exploitation
slowly vanished.
Despite this, however, there is still
an aura of guilt attached by the
average man in the street to mothers
of children who decide to take a paid
job. But by the same token the mother
who stays at home now also feels ar¡
element of guilt because the work she
does is no longer fully appreciated.
So we see that one of the first
results of the entry of women into
professional life has been to create
a climate of uneasiness in both groups
which society is doing little to over¬
come. By its wishy-washy attitude it
is even making matters worse.
But the married working woman, less
harried as she is by financial pressures
and better armed because of her edu¬
cation and professional background to
defend herself, has come to under¬
stand the real dimensions of the prob¬
lem. She has furthermore given
ample proof (and this is not the least
of her many achievements) that women
are not intellectually inferior to men,
and that if given half the chance men
have from the start which usually
they aren't women can be as career-
minded as men are and lacking in
none of their skills and ability for
executive and managerial posts.
' HAT also characterizes the
working woman in modern society is
not only that she is paid for her work
but that the work she does is becoming
increasingly independent of her
husband's or father's. For centuries,
a wife was little more than her
husband's unpaid helper performing
all his minor jobs and chores for him.
Even today certain vocational guidance
counsellors still seem to assume that
the wife who can help her husband
in his own work and remains, as it
were, in his shadow, achieves the
best compromise between her desire
to work and the interests of the
household. But fewer and fewer
women are now prepared to accept
such an unrealistic solution.
The subject of unequal pay for men
and women is a whole story in itself
and entire books have been written
about it. The picture that emerges
shows how difficult it is to get reality
to coincide with noble principles.
The ILO has been wrestling with this
problem for years, and it came to the
forefront of debate in Europe when
the European Common Market went
into effect several years ago. In five
out of the six Common Market
countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Fed. Rep. of Germany
and Italy) wage differences between
men and women have been partially
reduced. But in France, the first of
the Six to try to apply the principle
of equal pay, the gap has actually
widened from 6.8 per cent to over
10 per cent in most sectors of the
nation's economy.
One also finds that the higher one
goes in the echelons of responsibility
the greater the inequalities. French
women's salaries in the middle exe
cutive echelons are 35.7 per cent
lower than men's; and in the U.S. up
to a few years ago, the difference
was as high as 50 to 60 per cent.
While the principle of equal pay for
women is now no longer questioned,
it is by no stretch of the imagination
equally applied. To make matters
worse, women's salaries have fallen
so far behind men's in certain indus¬
tries with a high percentage of female
employees that a realignment is now
virtually out of the question except
by gradual stages.
And yet many employers expect a
woman candidate to hold more degrees
and other qualifications than a man
applying for the same position.
Notwithstanding their qualifications
and their increasingly recognized pro¬
fessional capacities, women are still
being sidetracked into subordinate
posts with little or no chances for
advancement. In Western countries,
the executive echelons in private
industry and commerce are- almost
entirely taken over by men. And this
is equally true of banking, even in the
United States where at least 76 per
cent of the country's monetary assets
are in the hands of women.
In the U.S.S.R. the change in the
position of the working women has
been particularly interesting to follow
for women have been able to take
their place in almost every sector of
the national economy. This has been
due to two chief reasons: on the one
hand, the equalitarian social system
developed in that country; on the
other, the extremely high percentage
of women available for work.
Nevertheless, progress did not come
without a fight, for at one period when
the principle of the equality of both
sexes was too narrowly applied certain
injustices to women followed. As a
result, protective laws were rein¬
troduced as of 1956 exempting women
from physically strenuous jobs and
granting them a number of advantages
including retirement at the age of 55,
a six-hour working day on certain
types of jobs, etc.
More interesting than these protec¬
tive laws, which in the U.S.S.R. as in
every other country have their draw¬
backs, are the recent changes in the
working pattern of the active popula¬
tion. This shows a shift towards the
tertiary sectors of commerce and
services, and in industry, a reduction
in the number of women working in
strenuous, badly paid jobs in favour
of the mechanized industries.
Since 1962, moreover, 54 per cent
of the jobs requiring a secondary or
university education with specialization
in a particular field, are filled by
women. Compared to the negligible
number of women engineers in
Western countries, one engineer in
three in the Soviet Union is a woman.

### 58122: Real and pseudo problems of the working woman
But whereas in 1962 almost half the
working population of the U.S.S.R.
(48 per cent) was made up of women,
they made up only 12 per cent of
industrial management and 28 per cent
of the top administrative posts.
Even in the U.S.S.R., then, the
advances of women remain limited.
Despite all the principles and
recommendations adopted by countries
all over the world, one fact stands out
as a general rule: as soon as an
occupation depreciates in status the
gates are opened up wide to women.
We must face the fact that women
are merely tolerated in the world of
employment. They slip in through
half-opened doors to fill the jobs
scorned by men either because they
are badly paid, monotonous or
unpleasant. . . or because they are too
difficult to perform.
The magistracy in France is a good
case in point: women were excluded
until. such time as the salaries were
considered too low for men. Medical
doctors, librarians and jurists in the
U.S.S.R. are other instances, these
professions being part of the civil
service were less well paid than pro¬
ductive" jobs in industry.
I could quote many other examples
from many other countries.
We also find that once an industry's
personnel becomes predominantly
feminine working conditions begin to
deteriorate and salaries drop.
Legislation is highly useful, but it
can only put an end to the most crying
abuses; it cannot solve all the prob¬
lems. That is why women have found
it necessary to join forces and form
their own groups within trade unions
and professional organizations.
As for the criticism that working
women are prone to absenteeism and
instability and are likely to break off
their careers for marriage or other
reasons, these allegations are lame
pretexts that do not stand up to
serious investigation. It would be
fairly simple to dispose of them if it
were admitted that women, just as much
as men, have the right and indeed the
duty to work, and if, instead of pro¬
tective measures which perpetuate dis¬
crimination, girls were given educa¬
tional opportunities on a same footing
as boys, conceived in terms of future
careers, not just in terms of marriage.
This of course would require a total
rethinking and revamping of our eco¬
nomy so that it is planned for the indi¬
vidual and not as an end in itself or
for society. It would also require a
new approach in which social invest¬
ment was no longer considered an

unproductive investment which in fact
it is not.
But in the final analysis, behind all
the barriers and impediments raised
against the working women lurks
man's unavowed and unadmitted fear
of losing his job and the no less vivid
fear of competition.
During the Great Depression of the
1930s, the International Labour Organ¬
ization had already come to grips
with this problem, and an article
written by Marguerite Thibert in 1933
neatly disposed of all the arguments
usually advanced on the subject (1).
Despite the many years that have
elapsed, this study still remains per¬
fectly valid today; but it seems to be
unknown to those responsible for the
promotion of labour.
As Marguerite Thibert reported, all
the studies carried out by the ILO in
the United States, Austria and Ger¬
many showed that to eliminate women
from jobs was like sweeping the pro¬
blem under the carpet, solving nothing.
Realistic solutions had to be sought
elsewhere, by creating new jobs and
job opportunities and not by putting
those persons who had jobs out of
work.
A.IS strong as the fear of
unemployment is the fear of competi¬
tion. For women are less of a real
threat to men's employment per se
than a threat to their promotion and
their traditional notion of masculine
superiority (2).
If we are to be totally frank we
cannot fail to recognize that in a great
number of cases men try their hardest
to cut the ground from under women
who want to work. They belittle their
professional ability, glorify their rôle
as wives and mothers, and use various
other means to undermine their
chances of pursuing a career.
But by doing so they defeat their
own purpose, for they virtually compel
women thereby to put their best foot
forward to prove how good they
really are, and this in turn forces men
to vie with them in order try to
catch up so that they can save their
reputations ... or even their jobs. As
a matter of fact, the only persons who
really benefit from this rivalry are their
employers.
Society, rather than the men and
women directly Involved, bears the
basic responsibility for these contra¬
dictions and absurdities. Modern
society has virtually made a fetish of
"efficiency" and "output", yet it deli¬
berately accepts to deprive itself of
the enormous storehouse of intelli¬
gence, devotion, energy and creative
imagination, not to speak of good

common sense that women represent.
And this at a time when we are heading
toward a broader policy of co-opera¬
tion and participation where the work¬
ing woman's understanding, sense of
justice and humanity as well as her
practical realism are needed by society
more than ever before.
By placing so many obstacles in
the path of the working woman the
nations of the world have accepted
with a surprising nonchalance the
prospect of increasing the unproduc¬
tive element in their communities.
This will only magnify the danger that
already exists of our destroying the
balance between the active population
and the total population at a time
when the world is searching for a new
type of society and both the developing
countries and the highly industrialized
ones must face the important issues
of hunger and poverty, war, disease,
illiteracy and exploding populations.
Today, with our world in the throes
of fundamental transformations, with
scientific advances offering a choice
of greater well-being or destruction,
when all our action, ingenuity and
resolve are needed to solve so many
new problems, why do we still have to
put up with silly, child-like attitudes
and social pressures that perpetuate
outmoded ways and run counter to the
needs of the modern couple and
family?
Today, professional training for
women is still far from adequate, and
when it is made available career
opportunities are often sorely lacking.
In many countries a large proportion
of women have little or no chance to
put the costly education they receive
to good use. In Belgium, to cite only
one example, 43 per cent of women
graduates make no professional use of
their degrees. Even post-graduate and
special training courses often lead
nowhere since the hurdles for entering
or returning to professional work are
in many cases more psychological
than technical. This ridiculous wastage
could be avoided at infinitely less cost
if the measures advocated by women
were accepted once and for all so as to
allow women to satisfy both their
desire for a family and a career.
Women have often been called the
custodians of civilization, culture and
the home, and they cannot be that in
the isolated framework of the family
shell, but only by emerging as full-
fledged members of society. Having
a job is just one of the ways of achiev¬
ing such integration but it best answers
the needs of the nations of today.
Human solidarity is no longer just a
family or national matter; it is fast
developing as an international, world¬
wide reality. The new humanism of
tomorrow will be built on this universal
human solidarity and a new awareness
of the dignity of the individual. This
means that there is now a greater need
than ever for men and women to join
forces so that the children of tomorrow
can see a better world and a civiliza¬
tion really worthy of the name.

### 58130: The International migration of workers; a smouldering issue of our time
THE INTERNATIONAL
OF WORKERS
A smouldering issue of our time
by Pieter Kuin
IN recent years the inter¬
national migration of labour has swell¬
ed to enormous proportions. This is
particularly true of continental Europe,
where in 1964 alone over a million
workers legally crossed the various
frontiers. At the same time the vol¬
ume of illegal immigration is also tend¬
ing to increase as the authorities
endeavour to channel and limit the
flow of migrant workers.
This action on the part of the au¬
thorities is an indication of the growing
anxiety about massive migration; in
some countries aliens now constitute
a considerable slice of the labour force
in Switzerland the figure is already
as high as 30 per cent and every
year workers flock across the fron¬
tiers of France, Switzerland and the
Federal Republic of Germany in their
hundreds of thousands.
The prevalence in the press and
other mass communication media of
terms like Überfremdung, "inundation
by foreigners," also bears ample wit¬
ness to this anxiety. Although immi-
PIETER KUIN was formerly Professor of
Economics and Industrial Organization at
the Free University of Amsterdam, Nether¬
lands. Both he and Prof. Samuel Parmar
(see article page 32) discuss the problems
of the migratory worker, but approach the
subject from quite different viewpoints. Their
texts are based on studies they originally
wrote for "Migration Today" (No. 6, May
1966), a bulletin published by -the Secretariat
for Migration, Division of Inter-Church Aid,
Refugee and World Service, World Council
of Churches, Switzerland.
gration in countries like Holland and
Belgium has not yet reached alarming
proportions, people there are already
becoming disturbed about it; they are
all the more worried in view of the
difficulties foreigners have in becom¬
ing integrated and the desperate short¬
age of housing for their own nationals.
The list of problems created by the
mass movement of workers is long
and dismal. It includes hardships
endured by the workers themselves,
who have to spend a large proportion
of their wages on rent (often sharing
tiny rooms) and other personal ne¬
cessities; wives and fiancées left be¬
hind; engaged couples and newly-
weds unable to find a home while
employers provide foreign workers
with accommodation.
Are all these difficulties really un¬
avoidable? Can we find no better
synthesis of economic and social
needs? Are we not standing idly by
while some territories' economic
growth remains stunted and others
enjoy a growth rate far beyond their
real potential? Rather than uproot so
many people from their familiar
surroundings and resettle them in areas
with overcrowding problems of their
own, would it not be better to disperse
economic activity?
It is because of the economic dis¬
parity between different parts of the
world that countless people are having
to choose between unemployment or
a very low-paid job at home and fac¬
ing up to the drawbacks of migrating
to one of the larger centres of industry.
It would of course be preferable to
disperse economic activity, but is it
feasible?
The first questions that present
themselves are inevitably: What causes
this disparity? And how does it
manage to survive and even to in¬
crease? Is there no mechanism for
ensuring a balanced pattern? Were
not our school text-books on economics
full of explanations of equilibrium
showing how any disturbance produces
a pressure that counteracts it? Why
does this mechanism fail to operate?
Why does production not flow to
where there is plenty of space, labour
and once people start earning
demand, until economic activity is
spread more evenly? There are var¬
ious factors and forces that act against
such equilibrium . . .
Is there any hope at all for areas
where economic development has
lagged behind? Must the disparities
continue to grow? For the immediate
future this seems inevitable, but the
long-range prospects are not quite so
gloomy.
The continued accumulation of acti¬
vity in one area ultimately causes
congestion and releases dispersive
pressures. Typical examples are the
shortage of housing and office space,
labour shortages, traffic congestion, __
long distances between home and yO
work, failure of public services to keep ^*»
up with the rapid growth of demand,
lack of unspoiled countryside and rec-

MIGRANT WORKERS (Continued)
Real advantages, to be sure, but...
reational facilities, waiting lists and
overcrowding in schools and hospitals,
and a tendency for the individual to
lose his identity among the masses
and become frustrated.
All these factors will make for a
more even distribution of economic
activity and a drift towards areas now
at a low economic ebb, but they alone
will not be enough. If development
is to proceed along the right lines
before it is too late there must be
plenty of realistic planning, great
discernment in administration and will¬
ingness on the part of the authorities
and industry to co-operate at national
and international levels.
Some may feel that long-range
solutions are all very well, but do not
help people who are in great distress
now. They may perhaps wonder
whether appropriate redeployment of
industry might not bring more imme¬
diate relief, and whether it is not time
to start taking the work to the people
instead of attracting the people to the
work.
This can be achieved on a modest
scale if the projects chosen are kept
within the range of present possibili¬
ties. Over-ambitious projects for
which the necessary infrastructure and
other facilities are not available can
only result in loss and disappointment.
We must be content with small,
sensibly planned and well-executed
projects employing a fair-sized labour
force. A well-run local handicrafts
industry, for instance, might with good
marketing find a ready market in more
advanced countries, particularly if the
products were not too heavy or bulky...
I
30
HERE are some steps
which can be taken to bring about a
more even distribution of economic
activity, to raise prosperity and em¬
ployment levels in areas that are at
present lagging behind. But the
opportunities are only limited and we
should beware of growing too optimis¬
tic, particularly regarding short-term
improvements.
When migration is banned or restrict¬
ed, even with the aim of eradicating
the resulting evils, the effect is to
deprive people in the less developed
areas of potential employment and
income and to cut back production in
prosperous regions without any corres¬
ponding increase elsewhere. For
years to come, therefore, we shall
have to rely on workers migrating from
one district or country to another.
However evenly economic activity
is distributed throughout the world,
there could never be complete affinity
between the industries located in a
given place and the type and volume
of skills possessed by the local in¬
habitants. If we are to safeguard a
man's right to settle where his talents
will best benefit himself and society,
therefore, the opportunity for migra¬
tion must always remain open.
The less developed areas, in parti¬
cular, have much to gain from migra¬
tion. Their future depends to a consid¬
erable extent on the workers who
return home, bringing with them know¬
ledge of new processes and techni¬
ques, of social and political life and
how they are organized in more
advanced areas.
It is for reasons such as these that
recent economic and social thinking
and legislation has laid much stress
on the free movement of labour. The
Treaty of Rome, for instance, which
set up the European Economic Com¬
munity, institutes a common market
for labour as well as for capital and
commodities.
We must therefore conclude, despite
all the difficulties and hardships caus¬
ed by the mass movement of workers,
that we are right to remove barriers
to migration. In accepting migration,
however, we do not have to accept
its evils along with it.
Migration undeniably can bring di¬
rect economic rewards, not to mention
other advantages like the satisfaction
of working and the new experiences
that broaden the workers' outlook and
enable him to live a fuller life when
he returns to his homeland.
More often than not, however, he
has to contend with hardship and
suffering. However poor a man is,
however miserable his social position,
leaving his homeland means losing its
protection, its familiar surroundings,
the conditions he knows and under¬
stands. Separation from wife, child¬
ren, parents and other relatives is a
serious matter. In a foreign country
their absence will be deeply felt and
there is a risk of loneliness, loss of
human contacts or mixing with the
wrong people. Quite rightly the divid¬
ing of families is looked upon as the
greatest drawback to migration, but
if the family is allowed to join the
worker this causes him and the host
community additional difficulties.
In many cases migration brings with
it a loss of status. It is widely believed
in the host countries that all immigrants
come from the lowest strata of society,
people with no status or skills in their
own countries. This is by no means
always the case, for many indépendant
farmers and craftsmen are forced by
the poverty and backwardness of their
own region to go elsewhere and take
unskilled jobs that nobody else wants
to do.
Add to this the often unwelcoming
and even hostile attitude of people
in the host country, the lack of accom¬
modation, high prices and rents, exploi¬
tation of the newcomers' unfamiliarity
with local conditions and the barriers
of language and culture, and the dismal
picture is complete except for one
item: insecurity and the unlikelihood
of improvement. A man will put up
with a great deal if he is not constantly
threatened by some major disaster like
being sacked from his job or turned
out of his room at a moment's notice,
and if he can reasonably expect things
to improve. All too often, however,
the immigrant has much less security
than other workers. In factory and
boarding house he is the last to be
accepted and the first to be got rid
of. How long will he be allowed to
stay in the foreign country? If he
can bring his family over, what are
the chances of settling permanently?
What should he do after a period of
temporary residence? What will the
situation be in his homeland then?
Many questions and no answers.
Fear. Suspicion. Little hope for
the future. Sometimes it all becomes
too much for him and he suffers a
mental or moral breakdown. Who can
be surprised? Who can blame him?
But who is there to understand and
help? True, many kind and able
people do a tremendous amount of
good work in the sphere of social
welfare, but something more is ne¬
cessary if the existing problems are
to be solved and additional evils
prevented.
IF the migrant worker has
his problems, so have others: relatives
left behind, governments, local authori¬
ties, employers, trade union leaders
and the general public in the host
country. For solutions they are all
dependent on one another. How long
the worker will stay in the foreign
country, for instance, depends on:
his employer, who in turn must
know whether he can count on
foreign labour and for how long;
the government of the host coun¬
try, which is only likely to renew
work permits if there is still a
shortage of labour;
economic development back
home; planning for this calls for
some knowledge of the numbers
and skills of emigrant workers
who intend to return.
Any realistic solution requires co¬
operation and consultation between
the parties right from the outset. The
failure to realize this has led to the
social difficulties we are now facing.
When the labour force in the developed
countries was insufficient for the total
production plans, foreign labour was
called in to fill the gap. This was
often presented as a purely' temporary
measure and is still viewed in this
light by many people.
Far from disappearing as the years
went by, however, the foreign labour
force has mushroomed. It is hard now

### 58130: The International migration of workers; a smouldering issue of our time
to see how it can ever be superseded
by local labour. Where are the local
workers to take over the jobs? And
who would want the jobs anyway?
Things have now got to the stage
where many countries have a new
low-paid proletariat doing the jobs
nobody else wants.
This time the dividing line is not just
between social classes but between
ethnic groups as well, and this raises
grave social problems. They can only
be avoided by taking timely and appro¬
priate measures to bring about the
economic, social and cultural assimi¬
lation of workers who are staying
permanently or for a long period. Un¬
less they are encouraged to adopt
the language, way of life and mental
attitudes of their adopted land, and
to share In the rights and duties of
native citizens, they are in danger of
becoming displaced persons for the
rest of their lives.
Then there are the substantial num¬
bers of young people who go abroad
to work for a few years before settling
down back home with the money they
have saved and the experience they
have gained. They too need to be
looked after. If in the country where
they find work their fellow-countrymen
have already formed a new ethnic pro¬
letariat, the young newcomers are
liable to be drawn into it. Instead of
new skills they may acquire habits and
ways of life that make their return to
a better life at home difficult or even
impossible.
Another drawback confronting young
migrants is that they may receive
thorough training in some trade or
occupation which is unknown in their
own district. This can happen even
within the borders of one country.
The Calabrian who finds work in
northern Italy on the assembly line of
a car factory or at the control panel
of a chemical plant may on his return
home have difficulty in settling down
to making leather bags or canning fish.
In any case he will be used to the
better terms of employment and greater
spending power of the north.
In cross-frontier migration this can
be an even greater problem. We must
therefore think in social, economic and
technological terms and be prepared
for extensive study and consultation
at an international level. International
organizations might be able to make a
valuable contribution here. The Euro¬
pean Economic Community's plans
with regard to implementing Article 50
of the Rome Treaty ("Member States
shall under a common programme,
encourage the exchange of young
workers") may provide a useful frame¬
work...
There is a lot of talk these days
about the need for social planning as
a complement to economic planning.
If there is any field where this teaching
needs to be applied it is the field of
migration. Without a carefully devised
plan of campaign we shall inevitably
be swamped by a flood of social
problems, conflicts and all the suffer¬
ing they engender.
Is there still any prospect of chan¬
nelling the flow in the right direction?
Probably there is, but there is one
major obstacle, the same one which
started the whole process: the lack
of qualified people. It is all very well
to devise jobs, to plan what should
be done and how, but who is actually
going to do the jobs?
Here we come up against one of
the most urgent problems of our time,
which confronts industry, government
agencies, international organizations
and religious bodies: we are running
out of human resources. Perhaps this
problem lies at the root of many others,
including migration.
OVER FIVE MILLION
MIGRANT WORKERS
IN 8 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
Although the United Nations has prepared figures on the
migration of peoples across frontiers, no up-to-date statistics

The table presented here is limited to migrant workers in
eight European countries in 1967 and is based on a fuller study
prepared by the Churches Committee on Migrant Workers in
Western Europe. Establishing statistics on migrant workers
is fraught with difficulties since the definition and classification
of what a migrant worker is differs widely from country to
country. This table is therefore an approximation and
publication here is not to be taken as official endorsement
by the U.N. or its Agencies.

### 58136: Unemployment or exile: is there a third choice for the migrant worker?
UNEMPLOYMENT OR EXILE
is there a third choice
for the migrant worker?
by Samuel Parmar
IHE international movement
of labour may denote a mutually advan¬
tageous matching of "need" and
"ability" between industrialized and
less industrialized nations. The former
have work but not enough workers;
the latter have a surplus labour force
but insufficient employment opportuni¬
ties. Thus through migration it be¬
comes possible for each to help the
other, and, in the process help itself.
This is, however, a deceptive mutuality
as is evident from the complex social
and economic problems that have come
in the wake of migration.
Labour is generally looked upon only
as a factor of production. Its move¬
ment tends to be governed by cost and
output considerations. This is a purely
economic criterion. Movement of lab¬
our involves a movement of the lab¬
ourer as well. The "human" factor
becomes important. Consequently a
simple input-output calculation is an
inadequate . criterion. Considerations
of social cost should acquire primacy
over economic cost.
In his paper on the international
migration of labour, Prof. Kuin
examines some of these problems and
suggests certain lines along which
their solution should be sought. He
emphasizes the importance of both
short-term and long-term measures;
the former essentially ameliorative, the
latter structural...
I am in general agreement with some
of his suggestions, such as the need
for social planning; co-operation and
consultation between the parties con¬
cerned ; a judicious dispersal of eco¬
nomic activity internationally; etc.
However, as one looks at the question
from the viewpoint of less industrialized
nations, there is bound to be some
difference in emphasis, and, therefore,
in the priorities within a given frame
of policy.
International migration of labour has
always contained elements of exploita-

nomics at the University of Allahabad,

of Churches, Bossey, Switzerland.
tion, with greater gain accruing to the
stronger partner, obviously at the cost
of the weaker. This is clearly seen in
historical migration. It may be less
evident in contemporary situations but
exists nonetheless.
Migrant workers face a two-pronged
disadvantage: economic and socio¬
political. As they generally come in at
the "basement" of the labour hierarchy
they start as underdogs in the labour
market. They may be the last to come
and first to go. Where new techno¬
logy displaces labour, the incidence of
change is more likely to fall on them.
Thus in an era of rapidly changing
technology they have a high redund¬
ancy-quotient.
Social prejudices, narrow nationalist
sentiments, antipathy to foreigners,
ethnic stances, etc., combine to impose
social and political handicaps on this
group. These may range from mild
disapproval to acute xenophobia and
bear a direct correlation to the size and
economic importance of the migrant
working force.
Therefore, in dealing with problems
and prospects of international migra¬
tion of labour, it is necessary to trace
the genesis of most of the problems to
the exploitation inherent in the process
of migration. Remedial action would
then take the form of comprehensive
social planning whereby the generators
of prejudice and exploitation could be
brought under control.
Some of the measures for improving
the condition of migrants deal with
symptoms and not with causes. It is
not enough to provide improved wel¬
fare facilities and introduce more
"humaneness" in dealings with mi¬
grants. This is an important first step.
But more important is the need to work
for a new climate which would be con¬
ducive to greater acceptance and
equality of the outsider.
That would mean special efforts to
instruct and inform nationals so that
prejudices are gradually eroded. So
far, there has been insufficient empha¬
sis on this aspect. Measures for im¬
provement are aimed at the migrants.
This is as true of private groups and
organizations as of governments. To
the extent to which the problems of
migrants result from their own defi¬
ciencies (lack of skills, negative attitu¬
des etc.) such measures will help.
But what about problems for which
people and structures in the receiv¬
ing nations are responsible? Unless
efforts are directed towards nationals,
those problems will remain even when
the migrants have acquired skills and
developed more positive attitudes.
Some of the current welfare work
with migrant labour appears paternal¬
istic precisely because good-intention-
ed people have failed to see clearly
the responsibility of nationals. Instead
of improving matters, such efforts
tend to become fresh irritants to mi¬
grants who, not unjustifiably, may feel
that they are being treated as objects
rather than subjects.
P.ERHAPS a brief analysis
is necessary at this point to indicate
how migration denotes exploitation.
If one looks at the international migra¬
tion of labour in the perspective of the
former slave trade, the picture is clear.
Men were reduced to mere means of
production in response to the demand
for cheap labour for new products like
cotton, plantation crops, minerals, etc.
Indentured labour was a step for¬
ward from the inhuman system of
slavery but it almost invariably repre¬
sented using cheap labour for the
advantage of dominant powers. Even
when workers moved from one un¬
developed nation to another (India to
West Indies, or India to South-East
Asia, or India to Africa, etc.), the gains
accruing to these countries were less
than those to the colonial power which
had initiated the movement...
A significant by-product of the
process was the emergence of exploi¬
tation at new levels. Generally, the
migrant workers were more diligent
and skilled, and gradually gained eco¬
nomic ascendancy over the easy-going
local working force. They became a
new class which took advantage of the
economic weakness of local people.
Here one can already see the emer¬
gence of a sub-proletariat. The prole-

### 58136: Unemployment or exile: is there a third choice for the migrant worker?
tariat consisted of the migrants and the
sub-proletariat of the nationals. This
is in striking contrast to the position
in Western Europe today where
national workers are the proletariat
and migrants the sub-proletariat. The
difference is important.
Where nationals are the underdogs
their resentment against alien workers
(who are economically stronger)
expresses resistance to exploitation.
But where nationals are the stronger
group and yet resent alien workers,
their attitude has little economic justi¬
fication and is tantamount to additional
exploitation.
Contemporary migration may have
less exploitation but is by no means
free of it. Labour shortage in indus¬
trial nations shows their economic
strength; hence their need for more
workers flows out of their strength.
Existence of unemployed labour in less
industrial nations is a sign of their
economic weakness; hence migration
in search of jobs arises out of their
weakness. To say that economic
relations stemming from such unequal
positions represent mutuality and a
fair distribution of benefits would be
erroneous.
There is a tendency to emphasize
what the migrant workers receive rather
than what they contribute. It should
not be forgotten that their presence
Is vital to the growth and stability of
industrial nations which absorb them.
In fact if migrants are portrayed as
beneficiaries who would have been in
dire economic distress in their own
countries, one could easily rationalize
a lack of concern for their welfare.
For if they are already much better
off than in their national situations are
they not enjoying unaccustomed wel¬
fare? To some extent the general lack
of concern for and resentment against
migrants may result from such an
approach.
On a nation to nation basis the
relatively greater advantage of indus¬
trial nations is more evident. Gener¬
ally, the more enterprising and poten¬
tially efficient workers are the first to
migrate. A substantial portion of their
earning is spent in the country of work,
either directly by them or indirectly

MODERN MARINERS AND THE ILO
About 90,000 Asian seamen sail in foreign ships but until recently their
system of recruitment gave them no guarantee of working conditions
and welfare services. To assure minimum standards of employment,
official recruiting offices have been established with ILO assistance
in the ports of Calcutta, Karachi, Chittagong, Hong Kong and
Singapore, and welfare facilities have been considerably expanded.
Protecting sailors on foreign ships is only one aspect of the ILO's work on
the seven seas. Since it was founded in 1919, it has campaigned
to improve working conditions for crews everywhere: in all, 27
conventions and 15 recommendations affecting seamen have been
adopted by the ILO, more than for any other group of workers.
Every ten years, the maritime session of the International Labour Conference
takes place, and in 1970 its agenda will include the modernization
of ships, welfare of sailors on board and in port, minimum
wages, accident prevention and professional training. Above, sea
cadets swarm up the rigging of an Indian training ship.

### 58136: Unemployment or exile: is there a third choice for the migrant worker?
MIGRANT WORKERS (Continued)
Last to be hired, first to be fired
by their countries where a part of the
earnings are transferred. Thus their
contribution to the industrial economy
is twofold: to its production and to
its demand.
The argument that migrants return
to their countries with newly acquired
skills and thereby assist the process
of economic development, is an over¬
worked argument. Firstly, because a
majority of migrants are performing
unskilled jobs in the host country and
have few opportunities to learn new
techniques. What they learn is not
enough to make them instruments for
a technological break-through when
they return to their countries.
D
34
UE to a number of favour¬
able factors such as influence of trade
unions, interest of nations in their
emigrants, growth of a new world
conscience, etc., there is less overt
exploitation of workers today, espec¬
ially in Western industrial nations. But
the migrant worker's enhanced sense
of identity and self-awareness intensi¬
fies the psychological exploitation
which he now suffers by being relegat¬
ed to a sub-proletariat.
Because he is conscious of his
rights, because he sees a prosperous
working class (consisting of nationals)
all around him, and because he senses
the resentment and hostility of this
class from which he had expected
solidarity, he feels a strong sense of
deprivation.
It may not be unusual to find the
local labour force joining hands with
the management to safeguard its sec¬
urity and privileges against the en¬
croachment of a less-skilled group of
foreign workers. The idea of workers'
solidarity and class homogeneity seems
to be fading. It almost seems that
economic prosperity in Western Eu¬
rope is moving the national labour
force away from the magnetic field of
the proletariat and into that of the
petit bourgeois. This strange identity
of interest of various national groups
as they face the migrants is new...
Welfare measures can better the lot
of migrant labour but cannot by them¬
selves eradicate the exploitation which
is present under current patterns.
More radical structural measures are
necessary. Therefore, if Prof. Kuin's
suggestions for social planning and
inter-governmental co-operation incor¬
porate an "engagement in depth" with
the issues, one would fully agree.
But one gets the impression that
he has not given sufficient weightage
to the element of exploitation and is
relying on remedies which deal more
with external expressions of the prob¬
lem than its root causes. He seems
to emphasize the mutuality of gain from
migration and favours the idea of
recognizing migration as a basic
human right. This is an oversimplifica¬
tion. The basic human right is
protection against exploitation.
Since migration allows exploitation,
it may be more realistic to support
regulated migration rather than an
open door policy. But this regulation
will be very different from the kind
which various elements of the host
nation press for in defence of the
privileges of domestic workers. Regu¬
lation must be for the weaker section
and not for the stronger.
A few comments now .about Prof.
Kuin's suggestion for a dispersal of
economic activity. In the West Euro¬
pean situation, especially within the
Common Market this sounds workable.
Since efforts are being made to remove
obstacles to a free movement of
factors of production between "the
Six" it should be possible for capital
and technique to flow to regions with
surplus labour...
The most significant reason for the
feasibility of "dispersal" within the
Common Market is that free movement
of goods precedes the free movement
of factors of production. An industry
can be set up where factor costs (jud¬
ged in terms of social cost) are lowest
and its produce can move to all parts
of the Common Market.
Such unhampered sale possibility
will allow for full expansion of the
industry, growth of subsidiary indus¬
tries, and economic development of
the erstwhile less-developed regions.
Since these are the areas of surplus
labour, their development will obviate
the need for workers to migrate to
industrially advanced regions. A more
rational allocation of resources and a
healthier pattern of specialization and
exchange will grow. The crux of the
matter is unhampered sale possibility
for goods produced in the less-
developed region.
Now let us apply this to the inter¬
national situation, especially as obtains
between developed and developing
nations. Supposing that capital, tech¬
nique and entrepreneurial skill go to
nations with an unemployed working
force, and industries are set up. What
about the sale of the produce? Dev¬
eloped nations are notoriously shy
of importing semi-processed and
manufactured goods from the less
industrial nations.
This is the major bottleneck in trade
and aid relationships today. Without
adequate markets these new industries
will not absorb an appreciable portion
of unemployed labour. Hence the
problem of surplus labour will remain
as before...
The growth of export industries
(which are "islands of development")
in underdeveloped countries was based
upon capital, technique and enterprise
coming from developed nations. But
it should be remembered that these
products had an assured market in
the investing country. Today a satur¬
ation point has been reached in the
sales of traditional exports of develop¬
ing nations. Hence these are not
attractive areas for foreign capital and
have a limited potential for absorbing
surplus labour.
Another problem is that techniques
emanating from industrial nations are
generally capital intensive and can
seldom make a dent on the problem
of unemployment in developing na¬
tions. On the contrary, such techni¬
ques tend to convert disguised un¬
employment into actual unemployment
by attracting many people from villages
to industrial centres in the hope of
jobs, only to find that there are few
jobs, and those mainly for skilled per¬
sons. In many new industrial areas of
Africa and Asia the existence of a
fast growing urban unemployed force
has resulted from such tendencies...
If dispersal of economic activity is
suggested as a method for increasing
employment opportunities in develop¬
ing nations, it has to be shown that
it is development-oriented and not
geared to some limited self-interest
of developed nations. This calls for
an elaborate form of regulation and
international economic planning and is,
therefore, beyond the competence of
private capital and enterprise...
F,INALLY, as regards the
problem of inadequate human resour¬
ces or lack of qualified people (which
Prof. Kuin stresses in his last para¬
graph) this is only one of a number of
expressions of insufficient develop¬
ment. The history of economic de¬
velopment and industrialization shows
that productive processes begin even
without a reservoir of qualified people.
As the processes make headway,
conditions are generated which facilit¬
ate the emergence of skilled and
qualified people.
If this could happen under the
"trial and error" pattern of unplanned
economic growth, the prospects of
building up human resources is certain¬
ly better today. First, because govern¬
mental and private bodies can function
more responsibly through planned
action, and second, because of a better
climate of international co-operation.
Our effort should be to overcome
negative factors such as narrow nation¬
alism, economic and political self-
interest, etc., that come in the way
of effective international co-operation.
In the context of the problem of migrant
labour, this implies taking steps nation¬
ally and internationally to eradicate
elements of exploitation which are at
the root of the problem.
