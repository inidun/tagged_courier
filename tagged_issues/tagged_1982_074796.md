ITALY: Woman of Valcamonica
ON December 10 this year
Unesco 's Paris headquart¬
ers will becomefora day an
internationalforum from which a
score ofpoetsfrom every cornerof
the globe will speak out through
their poems against the never-
resting forces of oppression and
destruction, aplatformfrom which
the mingled voices ofpeace, poetry
and liberty can declare "War on
War".
To ourgreat regret, limitationsof
space and timeprecludepublication
ofworks by all those takingpart in
this symposium. Nevertheless, in
the works of twelve of the par¬
ticipating poets presented in this
issue of the Unesco Courier, some
hitherto unpublished, despite dif¬
ferences of tone, emphasis and
cultural background, and despite
the clouding veil oftranslation, the
anguished, universal voice of the
poet can be heard, denouncing war
and pleading for fraternity and
peace.
The centenaries of three other
poets are also honoured in this
issue those of Subramania
Bharati, the great Tamil writer who
foughtforbut didnot live to see his
country's independence, and Yànka
Kupala and Yakub Kolas, both also
sturdy fighters for freedom and
democracy who have earned the
title of "fathers" of Byelorussian
literature.
Nor could the Unesco Courier
allow theyear 1982 to elapse without
marking the anniversaries of two
other greatfigures St. Francis of
Assisi whose 800-year-old message,
as the Italian writer Carlo Bopoints
out, isstill applicable today, and the
Polish composerKarolSzymanow-
ski whose music is now being ac¬
corded the renewed recognition it
deserves.
Finally, we pay all too brief
tribute to the memory ofthe Cuban
painter Wifredo Lam, who died in
September this year, and whose
works exude the electrifying creative
forcegeneratedby the encounterof
different cultures.

WAR ON WAR
Poets of the world at Unesco
by Jean-Jacques Lebel
The walls, gardens, and courtyards of Unesco's Paris Headquarters are a
showcase for a number oí artistic masterpieces which have been donated to
the Organization. Among the works which can be admired by visitors and staff
members alike are a Calder mobile, murals by Picasso and Glazunov, ceramics
by Miró, sculptures by Moore, Giacometti and Soto, and a mural by Matta. But
Unesco is also the home of many other works of art which are equally note¬
worthy. In this issue of the Unesco Courier, on pages 4 to 21, we present a
selection of these works. Above, modern figurative statue represents a human
being reflecting on the world (Peru).

IN organizing a poetry evening at
Unesco we have accepted the chal¬
lenge implicit in the incursion of
poetry into an official institution. Our
task has not been without difficulties, but
the challenge is commensurate with the
great importance poetry should have and
the role it should play in a world in per¬
manent crisis where the fight for
culture never won, and the fight for
liberty never ended, are one. The
delayed effects of this incursion may be
considerable, especially since poetry
festivals are today experiencing a
remarkable revival in some parts of the
world, perhaps because of the collapse
of so many cultural, religious and
political values which had been thought
to be sound.
The idea was simple and inspiring: that
the vision and language of the poet as
such should be presented without con¬
straint or censorship on the stage of
Unesco, which is by definition supra¬
national. We wanted to provide an op¬
portunity for poetry, with all its spirit,
rigour, passion, and complexity, to be
read aloud to an audience by its authors
in a prestigious setting.
This is the first time that so many great
poets of different cultures from all over
the world, chosen solely on the grounds
of their intellectual quality, have
gathered for an event of such importance
in such surroundings. The great literary .
voices of our time are rarely heard
beyond the narrow bounds within which
creative and Utopian thought is confin¬
ed both in the highly industrialized coun¬
tries and in the developing world. The
societies where shamans and prophets
were actually listened to have virtually
ceased to exist.
The men and women invited to take
part in this event are here in their own
right not as representatives ofnations,
ethnic groups, political parties, churches,
tribes or classes. The concerns of poetry
go far beyond the affiliations of the
citizen who is often engaged, moreover,
in a social struggle. The poet is above all
an extraordinary being, an inventor of
language who dares to think the un¬
thinkable and say the unsaid. Every
poem begins by overstepping the bounds,
the blockages and the alienations which
JEAN-JACQUES LEBEL, French writer and
theatre and film director, is the author of several
books including: La Poésie de la Beat Genera¬
tion (Poetry of the Beat Generation), Le Hap¬
pening (The Happening) and L'Amour et
l'Argent (Love and Money). He is also the
founder of the international Polyphonix festival.
On behalf of Unesco he has organized the "War
on War" manifestation of poets to be held at
Unesco headquarters, Paris.

reduce most of humanity to despair and
silence. On this occasion, the poets will
propose visionary alternatives to the pro¬
grammed massacres and planned cata¬
strophes which militaristic futurológists
and multinational arms purveyors are
seeking to impose on all peoples.
Essentially poetry ought not to raise
eyebrows in an institution which sets
itself the goal of ending the hegemony of
ignorance. The least to be expected is that
the structural crisis which permanently
convulses all the nations both in their
cultural and their economic life should
overturn some old habits. It is not those
who express themselves in poetry but
those who wield the language ofwar who
endanger the survival of mankind. It is
not going too far to say that poetry may
bring (if only for an experimental period)
"imagination to power" . If poetry is still
there, at the very heart of the questions
facing society, it is because the other
forms of expression scientific, poli¬
tical, religious, and administrative
and the other systems of belief, percep¬
tion and expression, have proved in¬
capable of comprehending the present
world crisis.
Meanwhile, poetry uses this crisis as its
raw material, drawing its legitimacy from
its rejection of idées reçues, high-flown
speeches, dogmatic lectures, the wooden
diction ofpower, the babel of the media,
and the dominance ofcultural mediocrity
universalized by the audio-visual media.
Poetry dissents from industrial norms
and customs, it opens up a royal road,
the adventure of the indomitable and
sovereign spirit. The poet's work restores
to its adepts the use of a different kind
ofword and language, and allows the in¬
dividual to accept his individuality, an in¬
dispensable role in an age of mass
phenomena and automation. In the
nuclear age it is still possible as it was in
Antiquity, both in East and West, in
Africa or the Americas, thanks to poetry
to learn or learn again how to think free¬
ly. It is here that the objectives ofmodern
poetry and those of Unesco are not
irreconcilable.
The Director-General ofUnesco, Mr.
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, is to be thank¬
ed for having welcomed this initiative and
for giving a score of such diverse poets
an opportunity to declare together War
on War, to set the ethic of philosophy
against military aggression, whatever its
source and whatever its pretext. Perhaps
this will encourage those who love peace
in all countries to join forces against the
criminal logic of those who kill. Perhaps
this event will inspire the awareness and
the process of reflection which is the basis
of poetic activity.
I know thee...
/ know thee O image of terror
I discern thy endless wilderness
My fear-racked tomorrow, and on my cheeks
Stains of the murdered sky
The prints of my two hands
I spell thee out, I revive the flame of thy visage
I squeeze a cry from each reluctant letter
I embrace the lynx and the raven
I embrace the dead
Wakened they leave the sod resuscitated
As ant or book reincarnate
Willingly I wash them
With my tomorrow or my yesterday
True to myself
I outstrip
I fashion the others

Faith All people have their own space
Breathing is life pulsating
Whether for happiness or sorrow
We are always waiting, hoping for something
The desert has its camel bells
The ocean its siren blasts
A motorbike rides through the street
Each bears a different message
Where is paradise? There is no paradise
Or else it's a minority's freehold
But we the humble creatures of the earth
Have nought but the faith that yearns in our hearts
But faith itself is dynamic
Sometimes pulling us forward
Or pushing us into pursuit
Remaining ever remote
We are opposed to war
As people daily shed their blood in sacrifice
We beseech an end to hunger
As millions from hunger perish
Nation against nation
Class against class
Religion against religion
Close in battle every passing day
What obscure hand's operation
Turns us powerless and weak,
Can 't we gather up our splendid faiths
In a blazing volcanic explosion
Thrusting aloft the whole world
Like bright clouds ascending the sky
Turning fantasies into reality
Creating a genuine paradise?

The youngsters
of La Prensa
In the daily photo line-ups in La Prensa they appear
stretched out
Eyes half closed, half-parted lips
As if in laughter, as if in pleasure
The youngsters of the list of shame
Or else from stamp-sized passport snaps they stare
Serious, deadly serious,
The boys who daily swelled the roll of horror
This one went for a neighbourhood stroll
They found him cast aside on a rough patch of wasteland
This one set off to work from his home in the San Judas district
And never returned
Then there was the one who went to buy a Coke at the corner
The one who went to see his girl-friend and never came back
Others snatched from their homes
carried off in army jeeps that disappeared into the night
And later found at the morgue
Or at the roadside in the Cuesta del Plomo
Or on a rubbish dump
Arms broken
Eyes gouged out, tongue severed, genitals torn off
Or who simply were never seen again
Those kidnapped by patrols of the Macho Negro or the Cara'e León
And cast heaped up beside the lake behind the Teatro Dario
Of their faces nothing remains
But a bright-eyed glance, a smile, reduced to flat paper
Tiny pasteboard squares their mothers expose like treasure in La Prensa
(An image engraved on the heart's core, on the dear little pasteboard)
The one with the shock of hair
The one with the frightened-deer eyes
The one with the roguish smile
The girl with the melancholy gaze
One in profile or with head inclined
One pensive, one with open shirt

Others with curls, with hair over face, with a beret
Another, blurred, smiling out from under curlers
In graduation garb
The lass with smiling lips and puckered brow
The girl in the photo sent to her betrothed
The posing boy in the photo given to his fiancée
20, 22, 18, 17, 15 years old
Young people killed for being young because
In Nicaragua it was illegal to be between 15 and 25
And it seemed that Nicaragua would be bereft of youth
Even after the victory I was surprised
When greeted at a gathering by a youth
to find myself asking wordlessly: "How did you escape?"
For once we were afraid of young survivors
You whom the guards seized, the "Beloved of the gods"
As the Greeks used to say, those whom the gods love die young
Others will grow old, but yet, for them, the beloved ones
Will stay forever fresh and young
Smooth-browed, hair ungraying
The fair-haired Roman girl who died, in memory stays ever fair
Yet you, I say, are not of those who do not age
simply because they stay young in the brief memory
Of others who one day will die
You will stay young because there will always be young people in Nicaragua
And because of your deaths, you the countless victims of the daily slaughter,
The young people of Nicaragua will always be revolutionaries
In them you will live again, your lives perpetually renewed
New again, as each day's dawn is new.

Stockpiling The Stockpiling offrozen trees
in the deep freeze of the earth
The stockpiling of dead animals
in the exhaust pipes of supersonic rockets
The stockpiling of desiccated plants
on the death root of an abscessed tooth
The stockpiling of defoliants
in the pine forest of the skull
The stockpiling of aerosols
in the pink smoke of a human corpse
Stockpiles
of agent orange agent blue agent white acids
burning ¡ike the hot hoof of a race horse on the tongue
Look at it
through the anti-bodies in the body
through the multiple vaccines belching in the veins
through the cross-infection of viruses stockpiled
in the mouth
through the benzine vapors shooting
into the muscles of the stars
through the gaseous bowels of military fantasies
through the white radiation of delirious dreams
Look
this stockpile marries that stockpile
to mix and release a double stockpile offissions
exploding
into the shadows of disappearing space
Global incapacitations
Zero
and boom
This is the nuclear bleach of reality
the inflated thigh of edema
the filthy dampness in the scientific pants
of a peace prize
the final stockpile offlesh dancing in
the terrible whooping cough of the wind
And even if you think you have a shelter
that can survive this stockpiling

Where are you going
with the sucked liver of mustard flint
the split breath of hydrogen fumes
the navel pit of invisible clams
the biological lung of human fleas
the carcinogenic bladder of sponges
words made of keloid scars
poems in the numb section of the chromosomes
Just where do you think you 're going
with that stockpile of contaminated stink
Listen
When I think of the tactical missiles plunging
into the rancid goiters of the sun
The artillery shells of wiretapping snakes hissing and vomiting
into the depths of a colorless sky
The accumulation offried phosphoric pus grafflttied
on the fragile fierceness of the moon
The pestering warheads of death-wings stockpiling feathers
in the brain
And the mass media's larval of lies stockpiled
in the plasma of the ears
And the stockpiling offoreign sap in the fluxes
of the blood
And the stockpiling of shattered spines
in chromium suits
under polyurethane sheets
I look at this stockpiling
at this rotting vegetation
and I make myself understand the target
That's why I say I'm into life
preservation of life now
revolutionary change now
before the choking
before the panic
before the penetration of apathy rises up
and spits fire
into the toxic tears
of this stockpile

Torture / serve notice on all points of the circle of the day
of news which is brought to me hammering
of torturing points from as far away as can be reported
and beatings, neighbours of mine even in their danger
even in kinship with iron no longer endured
when their quadrilateral snaps at the edges
and I shall not cease from watching while they break the edges
nor from listening while near and far they shroud the day
and I shall try to bear word of what is not endured
I shall not muffle the earpiece while I hear the sound of hammering
I shall listen to all that endures domination and danger
and comes to me from the torturing points reported
from opposite points on the circle by that which is reported
I shall hear the broken messenger from the place of the broken edges
where they are scattered and cast to the winds and in danger
where night is abolished after all the points of day
where the blows can no longer be heard on her hammering
so you turn deaf ears to that which is no longer endured
here we shall wait for news of that which is no longer endured
and we shall hear and endure the details reported
letting them drill us, assail us, hammering
I shall outstretch my fingers to the bruised soft edges
head in the night yet walking on the day
in places where they are downtrodden and in danger
and if they are bound or threatened by danger
even shattered by news that cannot be endured
hear it pattering across night and day
bearing the unbearable assault of what is reported
putting the hand in the wound of the edge
where the bruise has come back wounding and hammering
I shall hear the report, I shall go to it hammering
raising before the lordship of danger
the hand at the root of the wound in the edge
and the eyes unblinking at that which can be endured
hearing them come from all points tortured and reported
the bodies that are spring and sustenance of the day

Plutonian ode
(excerpt)
Radioactive Nemesis were you there at the beginning
black Dumb tongueless unsmelling blast of Disillusion?
I manifest your Baptismal Word after four billion years
I guess your birthday in Earthling Night, I salute your
dreadful presence lasting majestic as the Gods,
Sabaot, Jehova, Astapheus, Adonaeus, Elohim, Iao,
Ialdabaoth, Aeon from Aeon born ignorant in an
Abyss of Light,
Sophia's reflections glittering thoughtful galaxies,
whirlpools of starspume silver-thin as hairs of Einstein!
Father Whitman I celebrate a matter that renders Self
oblivion!
Grand Subject that annihilates inky hands & pages'
prayers, old orators' inspired Immortalities,
I begin your chant, openmouthed exhaling into spacious
sky over silent mills at Hanford, Savannah River,
Rocky Flats, Pantex, Burlington, Albuquerque
I yell thru Washington, South Carolina, Colorado,
Texas, Iowa, New Mexico,
where nuclear reactors create a new Thing under the
Sun, where Rockwell war-plants fabricate this death
stuff trigger in nitrogen baths,
Hanger-Silas Mason assembles the terrified weapon
secret by ten thousands, & where Manzano Mountain boasts to store
its dreadful decay through two hundred forty millennia
while our Galaxy spirals around its nebulous core.
I enter your secret places with my mind, I speak with
your presence, I roar your Lion Roar with mortal
mouth.
One microgram inspired to one lung, ten pounds of
heavy metal dust adrift slow motion over grey
Alps
the breadth of the planet, how long .before your radiance
speeds blight and death to sentient beings?
Enter my body or not I carol my spirit inside you,
Unapproachable Weight,
0 heavy heavy Element awakened I vocalize your consciousness to six worlds
1 chant your absolute Vanity. Yeah monster of Anger birthed in fear O most
Ignorant matter ever created unnatural to Earth! Delusion
of metal empires!

Destroyer of lying Scientists! Devourer of covetous
Generals, Incinerator of Armies & Melter of Wars!
Judgement ofjudgements, Divine Wind over vengeful
nations, Molester of Presidents, Death-Scandal of
Capital politics! Ah civilizations stupidly industrious!
Canker-Hex on multitudes learned or illiterate!
Manufactured Spectre of human reason! O solidified
imago ofpractitioners in Black Arts
I dare your Reality, I challenge your very being!
I publish your cause and effect!
I turn the Wheel of Mind on your three hundred tons!
Your name enters mankind's ear! I embody your ultimate powers!
My oratory advances on your vaunted Mystery!
This breath dispels your braggart fears! I sing your form at last
behind your concrete & iron walls inside your fortress
of rubber & translucent silicon shields in filtered
cabinets and baths of lathe oil,
My voice resounds through robot glove boxes & ingot
cans and echoes in electric vaults inert of atmosphere,
I enter with spirit out loud into your fuel rod drums
underground on soundless thrones and beds of lead
0 density! This weightless anthem trumpets transcendent
through hidden chambers and breaks through
iron doors into the Infernal Room!
Over your dreadful vibration this measured harmony
floats audible, these jubilant tones are honey and milk and wine-sweet water
Poured on the stone block floor, these syllables are
barley groats I scatter on the Reactor's core,
1 call your name with hollow vowels, I psalm your Fate
close by, my breath near deathless ever at your side
to Spell your destiny, I set this verse prophetic on your
mausoleum walls to seal you up Eternally with
Diamond Truth! O doomed Plutonium.

A farewell
to hormones
Poem © Sony Labou Tan'si
Translated from the French
A man of dust
With eyes of dust
Ever fixed on the sun
Teeth of dust
Wherein lurk powder-flies
A dusty sprayed-on smile
Skin of dust
Rocketed to the outworn moon
Of racism
Apollo ninety-three
Made in Madness
Made in Hatred
Made in Vanity
The dust of shame
The hollow laugh of silence
Falling on man woman and child
On your hunter's powder-horn
On your lipstick civilization
On your heart-shaming technology
On your Herculean labouring
To construct
This monstrosity of monstrosities
And then to die
Tied to the assembly-line
Death is no longer to die
And to die is not even to bid
A last farewell to hormones

Article 8. It is decreed that mankind's greatest dolour

though powerless to give the loved one love,
to know that it is water's gift alone

Article 9. It is permitted that the daily bread

Article 11. It is decreed that, by definition,
man is a loving creature,

Kicks a ball, everyday, he kicks a ball
One day
He kicked love up high in the sky
And it stayed there
Because it didn't come down
People thought it must be the sun

Become love

### 50945: Poetry before and after Hiroshima
Poetry before
and
after Hiroshima
by Stephen Spender
T
OETS adore ruins," Auden wrote, and this is a war¬
ning to bear in mind when considering the attitude
of poets to war.
Historically they have been, to say the least, ambivalent
about it. War forms the subject ofmost epic poetry and ofmuch
poetic drama, including Shakespeare's historical plays, and
Troilus and Cressida. In Troilus and Cressida, it is true, the
Grecian warriors are depicted as half-wits, war as senseless
violence. But in the highly patriotic historical plays war is
patriotism incandescent, soldiers are, for the most part, man¬
ly and heroic.
In the past, indeed right up to the First World War, war has
had great appeal for poets. Vergil begins the Aeneid with the
words "Arma virumque cano" (I sing of arms and the man)
connecting arms with man, almost as though men become most
man in war. War in poetry is traditionally a kind of stripping
those who fight down to the essential man, like nudes in
painting.
The reason why poets have been so attracted by war is
because it provides experiences of actual living in which
people are reduced to the elemental conditions of their existing:
death; the sense of being at once isolated and belonging to a
community; the cause worth living and dying for,
camaraderie war provides a terrible testing in which, through
being made aware of their courage or cowardice men realize
some significant truth about the quality of their own physical
and spiritual nature which would never be revealed in years
of peace.
Poets , when they are being poets and not just like other men ,
see life in relation to these ultimate realities. However, most
people do not do so, except in times of crisis. They spend most
of their lives living from day to day, occupied on the treadmill
of work or being what is called "worldly", impervious to the
ultimate realities of human existence.
But war is a situation in which everyone, or nearly everyone,
is brought face to face with life and death. Thus it breaks down
the barriers between the poet and the public, poetry and the
routine of material Iiving:_barriers which mean that in times
of peace and material prosperity the poet may well be writing
about a world of whose existence the great majority of people
STEPHEN SPENDER is a noted English poet who first won recognition
in the 1 930s as one of a group of writers and poets including his friend
W.H. Auden. He is also the author of criticism, drama, fiction/transla¬
tions and an autobiography World Within World (195 1). His most recent
book is The Thirties and After: Poetry, Politics, People, published by Mac-
Millan, London in 1978.
are scarcely aware. But if, in times of war, a poet writes about
heroism, destruction, faith, the sacred cause, religious need,
camaraderie, people recognize their own condition in his
poems. War can indeed produce the sensation of life itself, as
Tolstoy in his epic War and Peace, shows in his description
of Prince Andrew lying wounded on the battlefield and con¬
templating his own death. War also has given peoples the sense
of sharing a common dream of their nationhood. The Aeneid
is about the dream ofRome shared by the soldiers and fighters
living and dying for it under the leadership of Aeneas, who is
the pattern of military and civic virtues.
Nevertheless, poets in the past whilst being very open to the
attraction of war as a kind of lived and shared poetic drama
have, in the long run, been repelled and disgusted by it. They
have seen that it leads to terrible human suffering, senseless
brutality, the breaking up of ties ofaffection between families
and friends, and the destruction of those maintained condi¬
tions of civilization which are the essential basis ofart. Civiliza¬
tion requires peace, and ultimately, war leads to barbarism.
The Iliad ends in dust and ashes. In Shakespeare's Henry VI
there is a terrible scene of civil war in which a father finds dead
on the battlefield the corpse of an enemy which, when he turns
it over, he discovers to be that of his own son: a scene perhaps
echoed by the greatest English poet of the First World War
Wilfred Owen in his poem Strange Meeting, where im¬
mediately after his death a soldier has a conversation with a
fellow soldier killed in battle at the same instant as he himself
was killed, who at the end of the poem says, "I am the enemy
you killed, my friend."
Historically I think then that poets have vacillated betweeen
praise for war, because it makes people conscious of finalities,
and revulsion at the brutality, rapine, waste, boredom, destruc¬
tion and corruption. In the First World War the poets passed
rapidly from the phase of seeing the war as an awakening from
the leaden materialist lethargy of the late nineteenth century,
with its values of scientific and industrial "progress", to the
phase of horror and disgust at the killing and destruction, and
the boredom.
In 1914, in Germany, Rilke, the least militarist of poets, saw
war as a great upsurge ofsacred life against the materialist cen¬
tury, just as in England Rupert Brooke saw it as a cleansing
from the moral decadence of the England of the early part of
the twentieth century. In the sonnets Brooke wrote at the out¬
break of the war he characterized the young Englishmen who
rushed to offer their lives to their country as "swimmers into
cleanness leaping".

### 50945: Poetry before and after Hiroshima
But the immense scale of the destruction soon put an end
to this. By 1916 the two best English poets fighting in the
trenches Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon were writing
poems describing the horror, destruction and suffering pro¬
duced by the war and attacking the triumph of the hideous war
machine over the humanity of the soldiers fighting on the
Western front, the wickedness of the political leaders on both
sides who did nothing to stop the slaughter, the callous insen-
sitivity of old men and civilians at home who accepted com¬
placently the sacrifice of the lives of the young.
These poets divided the English into the heroic victims, who
were the soldiers at the front, and the scarcely conscious
civilians of the home base. They no longer cared whether the
victims were English, French or German soldiers. For them
the real enemies were not the German soldiers but the
militarists, politicians and arms manufacturers on both sides.
When Sassoon and Owen, and other officers like them, went
home on leave, they found that they hated their civilian fellow
Englishmen. They no longer felt that England was home. Home
was their fellow soldiers on the Western front. They had come
to hate war and knew themselves to be pacifists, yet more im¬
portant to them than their pacifism was that, so long as the
fighting continued, they should endure horrors with their fellow
soldiers.
In this one can see that, despite their detestation ofwar, the
poets did feel that the suffering resultant from it had made the
soldiers in the trenches, whether English, French or German,
superior to those who did not fight. Here was a remnant of
the feeling that war brings out human virtues in those who par¬
ticipate in it. To Wilfred Owen, every soldier was Christ.
This attitude of the English war poets became a kind ofpoetic
orthodoxy which lasted into the Second World War in which
many poets fought while hating war yet feeling that they should
share the camaraderie and agony of fellow soldiers. Anti-
fascismthe fact that they were fighting in defence of in¬
dividual freedom against Hitlerismperhaps qualified this at¬
titude, but not very much. The poetry of anti-fascism was not
written by combatant poets in the armies of the democracies
but by poets of the resistance, such as Aragon and Eluard, in
France.
Hiroshima entirely altered all this. From June 1945 onwards
there was no more soldier/pacifist poetry. War had become
totally dehumanized. The only poetry that could be written
about war now was about' the total inhumanity of the
technology which could destroy whole cities, countries, perhaps
the world as we know it. The anti-war poetry of today is that
of man almost helpless against the totally destructive powers
of his own inventing. It is written\vith certainty that there can
be no heroic, just, comradely phase of any future war. War
now means nothing but destruction. The threat of the extinct¬
ion of all civilized values, perhaps of the human race and all
.life on earth.
The poetry of poets who try to write about this situation
seems to be mainly of two kinds. Firstly, that of poets who make
metaphors of destruction, as does Jayne Cortez here in her
poem "Stockpiling":
The stockpiling offrozen trees
in the deepfreeze of the earth
the stockpiling of dead animals
in the exhaust pipes ofsupersonic rockets
the stockpiling of desiccated plants
...etc.
It is a magnificent effort to make poetry out of total in¬
humanity, the metaphors having the effect ofmaking the forces
of nuclear destruction accessible to the imagination. But when,
at the end of the poem, Cortez declares:
/ look at this stockpiling
at this rotting vegetation
and I make myself understand the target
that's why I say I'm into life
preservation of life now
revolutionary change now
it is not wholly convincing. The poet has been all too suc¬
cessful in inventing metaphors for the inhuman scientific pro¬
gress of destruction for us to feel that "being into life" has
much chance to save the world; and "revolutionary change"
seems almost pathetically vague. On the other hand, what alter¬
native to the technological inhumanity is there except brave
assertions of life and humanity? We find these in the beautifully
sensitive "Football Player" of Kazuko Shiraishi and in the
declarations of faith in humanity of Ferlinghetti :
. . . and I am awaiting
perpetually andforever
a renaissance of wonder
Anti-war poetry is not only against war. It states the predica¬
ment of life against destructive technology

### 50949: To be called men'; Kupala and Kolas, poets of liberty
TO BE CALLED MEN'
Kupala and Kolas, poets of liberty
by Maksim Tank
THE years between 1905 and 1907
were turbulent, shaking 'the
feudal order to its foundations.
Harbinger of freedom and democracy,
the wind of change swept over
Byelorussia, fanning the hopes of the
millions living in desperate poverty and
backwardness, in what was familiarly
known as "that godforsaken corner' ' of
the Tsar's domains.
It was during the same period, at the
height of the revolutionary storm, that
two voices were heard, shouting into the
wind the pent-up, centuries-old anger of
the peasants against their oppressors, and
proclaiming their demand for a radical
new order of things. The voices belong¬
ed to the young poets Yanka Kupala and
Yakub Kolas, whose centenary is being
celebrated in 1982.
My bread is the fruit of my own toil,
I endure insults, the voices shouting at
me.
Holidays? I hardly know what they
are,
I'm just a peasant, a miserable
muzhik.
But today and tomorrow, andfor the
rest of my days,
Long though my life may be, or
short,
There's one thing, brothers, I'll not
forget.
A peasant I may be, but a man, too.
These lines by Kupala are echoed
by Kolas:
Muzhik, it's true, but no fool, for all
that;
I know my day will come.
Quiet though / may be now, not
daring to answer back,
One of these days I'll
Shout, Brothers! to arms!
With such protests, Kupala and Kolas
broke the silence which had been impos¬
ed for so long on the downtrodden
Byelorussian peasantry, articulating the
conditions of their daily life, their cares
and suffering: the hungry springtimes
when the last crumb of bread had been
eaten; the mare staggering with exhaus¬
tion in the shafts; the wailing children;
the worn-out and emaciated women.
MAKSIM TANK is "People's Poet" of the Bye¬
lorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. His work
has been rewarded by the award of the Lenin
Prize and State prizes of the Byelorussian SSR.
He is a member of the Academy of Sciences
of the Byelorussian SSR, a secretary of the
governing council of the USSR Writers' Union,
and Chairman of the Writers' Union of the Bye¬
lorussian SSR.
"My tongue is as dry as a bone in my
mouth", says one verse, and another:
"Poor devils, we are, our heads in the
noose... work in the fields... tears at
home..."
It is not hard to understand the impor¬
tance of the role played by the verse of
Kupala and Kolas linked as closely as
it was to their people's aspirations and
to the problems of their time in the
renaissance of Byelorussian letters. A
renaissance indeed, because although the
country had a long literary tradition
reaching back to the early sixteenth cen¬
tury, with its origins in the works of the
great humanist and philosopher Frantisk
Skorina, it had also been condemned by
history to a long, dark age of occupation
by the Poles during which all printed mat- '
ter in the Byelorussian language was pro¬
hibited and the feudal overlords impos¬
ed a campaign of assimilation on the
people. And if, at the end of the eigh¬
teenth century, Byelorussia had been
reunited with Russia a country to which
it had been linked from time immemorial
by historical, cultural and linguistic
ties it was not until the beginning of the
twentieth century that what amounted to
little more than descriptive, written-
down folklore began to evolve into a new
national literature. The distinctive con¬
tribution by Kupala and Kolas was to
enrich this new literature with progressive
and revolutionary ideas, which they ex¬
pressed to artistic perfection.
Despite its concern with the sombre
realities of the times, the poetry of
Kupala and Kolas carries a heartening
and thought-provoking message. The
way we live now, it says, is barely an im¬
provement on death; struggle offers the
only chance of escape. This leitmotif of
revolt is nowhere more apparent than in
Kupala's "Who goes there?", which
Maksim Gorki, who translated it into
Russian, described as "an eloquent,
austere piece of verse."
Who goes there, in the marshland
and the forest,
Goes in that enormous crowd?
The Byelorussian people go there!
What are they bearing, on their
skinny shoulders,
Lifting in their skinny hands
Injustice and lies, they bear!
Where are they carrying all the lies
and the injustice,
Taking them to show to whom?
To the whole world, to show!
But who was it who roused these
millions from their sleep,
Who said, Take up your burden
now, and go?
Misery and sorrow taught them so!
But what is it they seek, then, the
oppressed of the ages,
The blind and the deaf, what do they
seek?
To be called men!
In its original language, we seem to
hear in the rhythm of this poem the
heavy, breathless tread of a huge crowd
of people, carrying on their shoulders an
immense load. "To be called men..."
The laconic phrase recalls the insult in¬
flicted on a people far too long subjected
to the most terrible of deprivations and
denied the exercise of the most elemen¬
tary political and social rights. But "To
be calledmen... "is also ademand, stem¬
ming from a new self-awareness.
However it was interpreted, the poem
made a powerful impression on the
people, and found its way to all the cor¬
ners ofTsarist Russia. And if, at the time,
"Who goes there?" was translated into
ten languages, it is worth noting that in
the special centenary edition of the works
of the two poets, it is translated into no
fewer than eighty, including Arabic,
Chinese, English, French, German, Hin¬
di, Japanese and Spanish...

### 50949: To be called men'; Kupala and Kolas, poets of liberty
Familiar with the folklore of their
country, transforming imagery into sym¬
bols, linking genuine feeling with an im¬
pressive breadth of vision, Kupala and
Kolas opened the eyes of their people to
spiritual horizons which lay far beyond
the frontiers of Byelorussia, without los¬
ing sight of national realities. At the same
time, their innate creativity, nourished by
the oral traditions of the rural popula¬
tion, enabled them to reveal the richness,
the freshness and the inexhaustible
resources of their native language. Small
wonder, then, that great masters of
literature such as Gorki, Sholokhov,
Aragon and many others have paid
tribute to the contribution made by these
two Byelorussian poets to the heritage of
world literature.
Kupala and Kolas were not linked
merely by their work and the gift which
they shared of ' 'conversing with all their
countrymen". The circumstances of
their lives were very similar. Both born
in 1 882, they each learned at a very early
age what it was really like to till the earth,
to work on the land without possessing
the smallest plot of one's own, to travel

from place to place in search of tem¬
porary employment. The fathers of each
of them died young, worn out by the
struggle against poverty.
And it was not by chance that both
poets chose pseudonyms of popular
origin. Ivan Dominikovich Lutsevich
became ' 'Yanka Kupala' ' in evocation of
the festival which bore that name.
Konstantin Mikhailovich Mitskevich
selected "Yakub Kolas", thus com¬
memorating the ear of grain (kolas) pro¬
duced by his native soil.
Both poets fought for the freedom of
their people; and both experienced the
rigours of censorship and Tsarist oppres¬
sion, in their literary work and in their
public activities. In 1908, Yakub Kolas
received a prison sentence of almost three
years, for having taken part in an illegal
congress of teachers.
It is not surprising, therefore, to find
similar themes, and even similar images,
in their writing, although each poet has
his own distinctive personality. Kupala
is the more lyrical of the two. Some of
his poems, such as Kurgan (Burial
Mound) , Mogila I'va (The Lion' s Grave)
Born in the same year a century ago, the two great Byelorussian poets Ivan
Dominikovich Lutsevich (Kupala) and Konstantin Mikhailovich Mitskevich (Kolas)
took their pen names from local fertility myths, thus expressing their love of
their native land and their desire to see their country free and bom again. Kolas,
which means an ear of grain, evokes the legend of the days when the Byelorus¬
sian countryside was no more than an expanse of sand, marsh and untamed
grassland. Dropped by a bird or carried on the wind or by a horse, a grain of
barley took root and flourished in this wasteland, thus providing man with his
daily bread. Even today, in Byelorussia, at harvest-time, the first handful of
corn harvested is ceremonially knotted around the farmer's waist (see draw¬
ing left). Kupala, from the word koupat, meaning to bathe, is the name of a
pagan midsummer festival on which pagan "weddings" were consummated.
On the eve of Kupala unmarried peasant girls would each fashion two circlets
of sweet clover which they threw into a nearby river. If the two circlets floated
side by side, the maidens would soon be wed (drawing opposite page). That
same night the peasants would set out in search of a fern in flower. Tradition
had it that the fern, the symbol of happiness, flowered only once a year, on
the eve of Kupala.
and Ona ija (She and I), have a roman¬
tic tone; others are taut with dramatic
tension. His inventions, images and sym¬
bols are frequently audacious. Kolas, on
the other hand, is a more down-to-earth
poet, with a closer eye for detail:
The villages have a sad look,
Heartbreaking it is, to see them.
In a backyardfirewood, a few
planks
And a heap of rubbish.
A rickety cross at the roadside,
A pile of dry poplar trees. . .
Silence, a sort of boredom as in a
prison
Or in a cemetery somewhere.
As well as a poet, Kolas was also,
throughout his life, a distinguished
prose-writer, noted particularly for his
collection of short stories Skazki Zhizni
(Tales of Life) and for his great trilogy
Na Rostanjakh (At the Crossroads).
During the First World War, both
poets were conscripted into the Tsarist
army and served outside Byelorussia.
Understandably, they greeted the Oc¬
tober Revolution in 1917 with great en¬
thusiasm, and celebrated the event in a
number of poems. But the vicissitudes of
the post-war period were such that part
of Byelorussia remained under Polish oc¬
cupation until 1939. On the other hand,
in 1 9 1 9, Eastern Byelorussia became one
of the fifteen constituent republics of the
USSR. Factories were built; roads were
traced across the landscape; and the
scourge of illiteracy, which had been rife
throughout the population, was
eradicated. The children of the poor were
now to be found in universities and other
educational establishments. Theatres
were created, and crowds flocked, as they
still do today, to see Kupala's Pavlinka,
and other dramatic works by the two
poets. Both were among the first
members of the Byelorussian Academy
of Sciences and Letters, the foundation
ofwhich launched a new era in the coun¬
try's economic, scientific and cultural
life.
In 1941, Nazi Germany attacked the
Soviet Union. Kupala and Kolas issued
passionate calls for popular resistance
against the invader, in stirring poems
such as the former's Belorusskim Par-
tizanam (To the Byelorussian partisans).
Despite the destruction by the enemy of
entire towns and villages, and the suffer¬
ing of the people (one Byelorussian in
four did not survive the war), there was
no surrender. Yanka Kupala, unhappi¬
ly, did not live to see his country's vic¬
tory, but died in 1942. Yakub Kolas
lived until 1956, and thus witnessed the
revival which began with the liberation,
playing an active part in public life and
expressing his creativity up to the very
end.
Today, the works ofKupala and Kolas
are published in impressive quantities.
Poetic gatherings are organized in their
memory. Streets, squares, schools,
libraries, theatres, institutions ofvarious
kinds and even ships bear the two poets'
names. Indeed, the names of Yanka
Kupala and Yakub Kolas will always be
linked with that of their country, to
which they unstintingly devoted their ex¬
ceptional talents.

TAKING flight into the realms of pure
fantasy, let us imagine that one
day Saint Francis knocked at our
door. What yvould happen? No doubt he
would begin by telling us about his own
times and what he had tried to accomplish
during his life. And this would be the point
at which some real problems would arise.
Let us imagine how the conversation
would continue. Saint Francis would re¬
mind us of his guidelines for living and right
away we would come up against great dif¬
ficulties. No doubt he would speak of
poverty and invite us to live the life of the
poor, advising his brothers to accept
neither church nor even the poorest house;
he would preach the Christianity of Christ,
the Christ of the Gospels who is the inspira¬
tion of the pilgrim church of the world, of
that church which is in eternal movement
because it pursues the notion of the
spiritual prey, souls that wait to be
educated and helped, ofthat church which
over six centuries does not appear to have
gone very far in that direction.
And what about us? We are still caught
up in a totally opposed vision, one which
cannot be reconciled with this path of
adversity and difficulty. Our goal is to live
in houses which are ever more comfortable
and richly appointed, to pray in churches
which best suit our tastes. Above all, we
strive to make of this same religion, of this
religion which links us through Saint Fran¬
cis to Christ, a centre of appeasement, of
satisfaction and, indirectly, of lassitude.
We enter the church to find peace; Saint
CARLO BO, /fa/f'an writer and literary critic, has
played a leading role in a number of avant-garde
literary movements, including hermetism, in
which such great Italian poets as Ungaretti and
Móntale have taken part. He teaches French
language and literature at Urbino, where he has
been rector of the university since 1950.
This article is taken from a longer study in
which the author, writing from the standpoint
of a Christian of the West, calls for a return to
the essentials of Franciscan teaching love,
peace and brotherhood between men and bet¬
ween the peoples of the world.
From riches to rags
FEW periods in history and few places in the world could have
seemed less propitious than the Italy of the end of the twelfth
century for the birth of the "seraphic saint" , the man whose
life mission was "to follow the teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ
and to walk in his footsteps". For when Francesco di Pietro di Ber-
nardone was born, in 1182, at Assisi in Umbria, the peninsula was
torn with strifePope fought Emperor, Guelph fought Ghibelline,
bourgeois fought noble and city fought city.
The man who was later to found a great religious order whose first
rule was poverty was born rich. His father, Pietro di Bernardone, was
a wealthy cloth merchant, and with his good looks, his riches and his
romantic notions of chivalry, acquired from the chansons of the
French troubadours, Francesco soon became the acknowledged leader
of the worldly young blades of Assisi.
Thirsting for knightly adventure, in 1202 he took part in the war
between Assisi and Perugia but was taken prisoner at the battle of
Ponte San Giovanni at which Assisi suffered a crushing defeat. Releas¬
ed a year later he became seriously ill, but on his recovery he set out,
in 1205, to join the papal army. This journey was to be his "road to
Damascus". He had got no farther than Spoleto when he had a
vision in which he was instructed to return to Assisi and await a call
to another form of knighthood.
On his return to Assisi, in preparation for this call, he devoted
himself to prayer and solitude. He made a pilgrimage to Rome where
he experienced poverty at first hand, mingling with beggars and himself
begging for alms.
The call which he had been so patiently awaiting came to him at
the ruined chapel of San Damiano on the outskirts of Assisi. One day
a voice from the crucifix above the altar commanded him: "Go Francis
and repair my ruined house". Taking these words literally, he returned
home, took as much cloth from his father's shop as he could load
on to his horse and rode to Foligno where he sold both cloth and horse.
On his return he tried to give the money to the priest of San Da¬
miano, but his enraged father hauled him first before the civil
authorities and then before the bishop. Before the startled prelate's
eyes he stripped off his clothing which he handed to his father say¬
ing, "Until today I called Pietro di Bernardone my father; henceforth
I can truly say: Our Father which art in heaven". Whereupon the
astonished bishop gave him a cloak to cover his nakedness and he
set off to live in the forests of Mount Subasio. '
With family ties broken and material goods renounced he was free
to devote himself to God's work. Dressed now in rough hermit's garb
he set about restoring first the chapel at San Damiano and then the
chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli, known because of its small size

Francis enters it so as to reinforce his desire
to fight against himself, against everything
which might give him a moment of tran¬
quility, a breathing-space, oblivion.
It is clear that, broached in this fashion,
our hypothetical conversation offers no
possibility of mutual understanding, the
Saint continuing to walk the highways and
byways of the world (certainly in another
form, dressed differently, and with the face
of an asocial, marginal figure condemned
by a society that excludes him). And yet
the first words he pronounces in our
imagination and across centuries of
Catholic tradition are simply these: "the
spirit of poverty."
The very principle of our economy is in
contradiction with the evangelical ideal of
Saint Francis. It is not for nothing that his
discourse is centred on negation: not to
possess, not to hold, not to accept. We are
impelled to give, to render what we give
acceptable and to discover those who are
poorer than ourselves.
The theme of true happiness is precise¬
ly this: happy and serene is the man who.
stranded far from home on a stormy night,
knocks ¡n vain at the door of the convent.
Saint Francis makes of this domestic
parable the main instrument of his genius
for spiritual individuation man finds his
salvation in the very moment that the world
abandons him.
In the depths of misfortune, continues
the disconcerting Saint Francis, this
trouble-maker we have welcomed into our
home, we discover the unique sign of
salvation. For the Saint hope does not
come from us or from any other man, but
Saint Francis' love of nature has come to be
typified by the story of how he exhorted his
friends the birds to sing the praises of God. He
regarded nature as the mirror of God and his
sense of brotherhood which extended not on¬
ly to his fellow men but to all God's creatures
found expression in his famous Cántico di frate
sole (Canticle of Brother Sun). This poem is not
only one of the most beautiful in Italian
literature, it is also one of the first to be writ¬
ten in the vernacular. Until the 13th century
almost all Italian literary work was written in
ecclesiastical Latin. When Saint Francis wrote
the Cántico In 1 225, not long before his death,
he pointed the way to such men as Guido
Cavalcanti and Guido Guinlzelli towards the
"dolce Stil novo", the "sweet new style" of
poetry whose praises Dante sang in the Divine
Comedy. Left, Graham Faulkner as Saint Fran¬
cis in Franco Zeffirelli's film Francis and the
Way to the Sun.

as the Porziuncola, which was later to become the centre of the Fran¬
ciscan Order.
There, on the feast of St Matthias, on February 24, 1208, he heard
the words from the Gospel with which Christ sent forth his apostles:
"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip
for your journey,- neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves, for
the workman is worthy of his meat. And into whatsoever city or town
ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide until ye
go thence. " At last the meaning and purpose of his life seemed crystal
clear. Although not an ordained priest, he began preaching to his
fellow townsmen, quickly attracting around him a band of disciples.
On April 16, 1209, the rule of life he had drawn up for them received
papal sanction and the great adventure of the Franciscan Order was
launched.
Women, too, flocked to join him and three years later he founded
for them a second order that came to be known as the Poor Clares
after his first woman adherent Clare Offreduccio, a noblewoman of
Assisi. Finally, in 1221 , he formed the Third Order of Brothers and
Sisters of Penance, a lay fraternity for those who, without withdraw¬
ing from the world or taking religious vows, wished to follow the prin¬
ciples of Franciscan life.
Meanwhile the men's order had grown rapidly and was no longer
confined to Italy. In 1212 Francis had set out for the Holy Land but
was shipwrecked in the Adriatic and was forced to return home. In
1219 he went to Egypt where the crusaders were besieging Damietta,
and is said to have entered the Saracen camp and preached before
the sultan.
Ill health, which was to dog him for the rest of his life, forced him
to abandon projected visits to France and Spain. Besides, his presence
was needed in Italy where the continual growth of the men's order
made amplification and revision of the rule of the order imperative.
The new and final version of the Franciscan rule was approved by
Pope Honorius III in November 1223.
Exhausted by his many illnesses, which he called his "sisters" and
the many penances he inflicted on "Brother Ass the body", Francis
felt the need to withdraw from the external affairs of the order and
in the summer of 1224 he went with three companions to the moun¬
tain retreat of La Verna, not far from Assisi. Here, as he prayed on
the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, he saw a vision of a seraph
with six wings. When the vision faded he found that his body bore
the stigmata, the marks of the wounds of Christ, on his hands, feet
and side.
As Christmas approached Francis returned to the Porziuncola and,
despite constant illness and near blindness, he spent the first months
of the year 1225 riding throughout Umbria on a donkey preaching
to the people. With his eye condition worsening his companions took
him to Rieti for medical treatment which proved unsuccessful. Then,
after a brief stay in Siena, he was brought home to Assisi where, on
October 3, 1226, he died at the Porziuncola. In 1228 he was canoniz¬
ed a saint by Pope Gregory IX.

from God who assigns us mysterious tasks
and has us encountertragic conditions on
our way through life. Grace is not a reward,
it is only the promise of a reward, of
salvation, the promise that our terror will
be transformed into joy and jubilation.
Our poor man, or, more accurately, the
poor man as we like to imagine him and deal
with him, is a completely passive being. We
mollycoddle the poor man, we send him to
sleep, we do everything we can to relieve
him of his moth-eaten coat of glory. We
give him something in the hope that he will
move on, and we even vouchsafe him a
few words of advice so that he won't
disturb our tranquillity. Saint Francis, on
the contrary, sees the poor man as a king,
Our lives, such as we have lived and are
living them, would appearto give the lie to
the dream and the reality of Saint Francis
and suggest that the natural character, nor¬
mality and enormous importance of our
temptations constitute basic proof of the
vanity and laughable character of Saint
Francis' dream, the dream of fraternity and
of peace through fraternity.
Herein we find one of the most disturb¬
ing and at the same time splendid aspects
of the Franciscan wanderings the clear
tendency to rebellion in the saint, the
tendency to defer obedience to his own
convictions. It would have been easy for
him to place himself at the head of a move¬
ment which challenged the "Signor Papa"

and his own bishop. But it was in this very
context that Saint Francis understood that
truth is indissociable from obedience and
that obedience is very similar to the night
of storm and cold, a chastising experience
whose ultimate goal is the recuperation of
liberty. It is important to note, however,
that the obedience is not of a purely
mechanical kind, nor can it be replaced by
a facile escapism; it is an obedience, rather, .
which takes its toll in tears and blood.
The great story of Christianity has been
written with this obedience as its main in¬
strument, as Saint Francis, with his fear of
heresy and the tempting spirit of contradic¬
tion, was well aware. Nor, for that matter,
did he hesitate to bind his brothers to a
scrupulous observance of evangelical prin¬
ciples and the teachings of the Church. The
suspicion of theology arose from the idea
that carnal pride could return to our hearts
as the result of uncontrolled speculation.
What greater sacrifice could one ask of
a man than that of submitting to the
eradication of his own intelligence? We feel
that God gave us our brains to use in any
way we choose. Saint Francis, on the other
hand, absolutely denies this. For him the
intelligence is only a means of increasing
the love of God, and should be placed at
the disposal of whoever has been called
upon to act as our guide.
The precepts and recommendations
which his voice carries to us from that lost
century have been tacitly avoided, silenc¬
ed, for a long timefrom the moment, in
fact, that man began lookingto his own in¬
terest and seeking an equilibrium which
chance, our capacity for adaptation, and
the illusion of being alone in the world,
appear to have made possible. We have
stifled or, for the moment, we appear to
have stifled the cry of Cain, that very cry
that Saint Francis strove to banish from our
daily lives. Why render an account of our
acts, why renounce the spirit of liberty,
why make of obedience the very gateway
as the thorn that makes our flesh bleed and,
above all, as the face of truth.
In elaborating his teachings of love by
contrasts, Saint Francis advances the
spiritual meaning of poverty one stage fur¬
ther. He who hates us is a powerful figure,
resembling us yet menacing our property
area, trying to take from us our part of
power, of glory, of ambition. And Saint
Francis tells us that we should love him as
ourselves, as if this rich man was in reality
a poverty-stricken individual, as if in the im¬
age of this victor we could discover the
face of the beaten and insulted Christ.
It might be conjectured that God sent
Saint Francis into this world in the
footsteps of Christ in order to offer us one
more demonstration that the Gospels ex¬
tol a utopia. And this affords us the oppor¬
tunity to formulate a first objection to Saint
Francis and to Jesus: why preach things
which are so arduous, so difficult ¡n fact
as to be next to impossible to implement,
and which two thousand years of world ex¬
perience has shown to be so if not total¬
ly, at least in part?

to prayer? Saint Francis asked and con¬
tinues to ask much of us without ever
speaking to us of what we will be given in
exchange. At most he promises us
"perfect happiness", something that
nobody believes in these days. Like the
Christ of the Gospels, the Saint does not
lay before us hard and fast rules of sal¬
vation nor does he conjure up in our
anguished minds the mirage of gardens of
enchantment; we are merely men pointing
out to other men terrestrial paradises which
with time have come to form a single
"Eden" where everything is fulfilled in
murder and the exaltation of visible
conquests.
The strain of madness in Saint Francis'
preaching does not strike or affect us as it
struck and affected his contemporaries,
completely taken aback as they were by
his desire to dispossess and strip clean. The
effect on those who saw and heard him
preach in the streets and squares was one
of fury: he was at odds with the social
model of his time. As to us, we do not
remember him, we have eliminated him.
What was madness, the madness of God,
is today a curiosity. But perhaps we
exaggerate. If he has remained in our
memory for seven hundred years and if,
from Dante up to the latest' writers who
from time to time have felt tempted to rein-
voke his spirit, Saint Francis has appealed
to our intelligence, it is because his path,
temporarily dropped from our itineraries,
is not yet closed.
Will Saint Francis return? For the mo¬
ment we are limited to fantasizing concer¬
ning this possibility, to turning the question
upside down in the form of an hypothesis:
should he return. If he returns, if one day
he knocks on our paper door, what will filter
through the unending stream of other
news, of other messages? How will we
judge him and what will he himself find
most surprising?
When Saint Francis knocks at our door
(and this happens much more frequently
than we suppose), we only half open it; we
admit his legend into our homes and leave
his truths outside his patience, his par¬
don, his love. In the final analysis it is that
love alone that joins and reunites us all.
Why do we leave his truth of love outside?
Simply because we are incapable of this
love; the regime of consumerism, usury
and exploitation, the rule of do ut des (I give
that you may give) and the philosophy of
life which follows from it, have as their
primary objective the spirit of love, this
"good" that we inscribe on our standards
but which in reality we do not respect. This
"good" is only for us and we do all we can
to obtain it and to improve it on the prac¬
tical level. But, as Saint Francis saw, it is
never the good of others.
Saint Francis has lost, in the same way
that his dreams of a human community
freed from the harsh laws of economics
have not prevailed. The efforts which have
been made in other continents and which
have been inspired by his more generous
ambitions belong to written history and it
is unlikely that they will manifest
themselves again in written form. In¬
dustrialized societies have increased the
factors of social contrast which were
known in the time of Saint Francis, but let
us not forget that he foresaw the impor¬
tance of the problem and in his own way
succeeded in breaking it down to its root
causes.
Carlo Bo
jrr£was tall, raw-boned, emaciated;
Ê one ofthose men whose skeletons
JL JL seem visible through theflesh-
likeDon Quixote to whom he dedicatedhis
autobiography andfor whom he reserved
a special corner ofhis heart as the embodi¬
ment of the ideal man. Yet despite his
physicalsimilarity to and love of "TheMan
from La Mancha", Wifredo Lam was not
Spanish; he was a man of the tropics, a
Caribbean, a Cuban to his fingertips.
Lam was born in 1902 at Sagua La
Grande, Cuba, in the heart of a region
whose long and determinant history of in¬
termingling of peoples and cultures has
made it, in Lam's own words, "a privileg¬
ed geographical cross-roads, both a meeting
point andapoint ofdeparture". By his birth
Lam inherited thefourbasic elements ofthe
Caribbean ethnic intermix: African, Euro¬
pean and Indian, from his mother, and
Chinese, from his father.
After starting his study of painting in
Havana, Lam set out, in 1923, for Spain
where he was to spend a crucial period of
hislife. "When Iarrived in Madrid", Lam
recounted later, "I was like a country
bumpkin who had seen nothing. My first
visit to the Prado was a revelation ". Some
thirteen years later, in 1936 and 1937, he
played an active role in the defence of
MadridagainstFranco 'sforces, andat the
end of 1937 he moved to Paris.
Soon after his arrival in Paris Lam met
Picasso who introduced him to André
Breton and other figures of the surrealist
movement with which he wasfrom then on
closely associated. Lam 's encounter with
Picasso and the surrealists was to have a
decisive impact on his work which was to
be moulded by the twin influences of the
European intellectual and artistic avant-
garde and his deeply implanted Caribbean
roots. It was not long before this fusion
found material expression in thefirst ofhis
major works.
In 1941, fleeing the Nazi invaders, Lam
shippedout ofMarseilles with severalofhis
Parisianfriends. In ¡942 he reachedHavana
where the rediscovery, after an absence of
eighteen years, of his native land and the .
Black culture into which he had been born
galvanized his artistic imagination. In

1943 he completedhisfamouspainting The
Jungle (see the Unesco Courier, December
1981) in which the imagery and thesyncretic
cult myths of Cuba (African animism-
Spanish Catholicism) found expression
through European avant-gardeforms with
such imagination and explosiveforce that
it provoked an uproar when exhibited in
New York that same year.
Lam remained in Cuba until 1952, when
he returned to Paris which he was to make
his permanent home. He continued,
however, to makefrequent trips to his native
Cuba, especially after the 1959 revolution
ofwhich he had been afirm supporterfrom
the start.
By this time hispaintings hadearned him
a worldwide reputation and each new work
enhancedhisposition as one ofthe great ar¬
tists ofan awakening Third World and as
the voice of its oppressed and neglected
cultures. Through the magic ofhis imagina¬
tion the universe of the occult and the
mysterious took on colour and shape,
becoming aware of the fact of its own ex¬
istence. Referring to The Jungle, theFrench
writerAlain Jouffroy wrote that "it wasthe
first artistic revolutionary declaration ofa
Third World that already, it would seem,
perceived the need to place all cultures on
a common footing, and an augury of an
awakening to this need on a worldscale...
The Jungle affirmed that there were no in¬
superable incompatibilities between peoples
and that they are all intimately interlinked. "
Indeed, though Lam wasa Caribbean and
aman ofthe New World, he also belonged
to the Old World. The upsurge oftheAfro-
Cuban heritage in the works of Lam's
maturity occurredprecisely because the very
nature ofthe adventureoftwentieth-century
European art (we recall the discovery of
"primitive" African art by Matisse and
Picasso) had made it possible. Mestizo in
his origins, Lam was mestizo in his art, a
quality that brought to his works a
dynamism that kept it inperpetualferment
right to the end and imbued it with the rich
joyousness of the adventure of Caribbean
and modern art.
Wifredo Lam died thisyear in Paris under
a bright September sky.

### 50955: Szymanowski: a great composer rediscovered
Szymanowski
a great composer rediscovered
byjerzy Waldorff
and Arab music (which he discovered
while travelling in Africa). But he soon
found his own way, essentially Polish in
inspiration.
After his journey to Africa
Szymanowski visited Paris on the eve of
the First World War where he met Claude
Debussy, and London where he made the
acquaintance of Igor Stravinsky. As
described, not without humour, in Ar-
tur Rubinstein's memoirs, the meeting
with the outwardly cold and aloof
Stravinsky was not a success! Then
Szymanowski returned home by one of
the last trains in the summer of 1914. As
GREAT creative artists and their
works often have a chequered
fate. Vivaldi's music was only
discovered two centuries after its com¬
poser's death. Van Gogh, like many
other painters, lived in poverty; today his
paintings are valued at millions of
dollars. In some cases outstanding
creators are celebrated during their
lifetime but after their death their works
are temporarily and unjustly consigned
to oblivion. This has been the fate of
Karol Szymanowski, who was con¬
sidered to be one of the great European
composers in the 1930s.
Szymanowski was born on 3 October
1 882 in the little town ofTimoszowka on
the border of the Ukraine and Podolia.
It is a matter of coincidence that Joseph
Conrad (Jozef Korzeniowski) the great
English writer of Polish origin, the
famous pianist and statesman Ignacy
Paderewski, and the noted twentieth-
century Polish writer Jaroslav
Ivaszkiewicz were all born in this same
region of Poland. Two famous women,
Balzac's great love Ewelina Hanska, and
Karolina Ivanowska (later the princess of
Wittgenstein) who was the inspiration of
Franz Liszt, also came from the same
area.
Szymanowski had the good fortune to
be born into a family which was deeply
interested in the theatre, literature and
above all music. They did not stand in the
way of his vocation and allowed him to
study in Warsaw where he made friends
with the pianist Artur Rubinstein and the
violinist Pawel Kochans. These brilliant
performers later became the most
faithful champions of Szymanowski's
works in Europe and the United States.
Initially Szymanowski was influenced
by Chopin and Scriabin. In 1902 his
Study in B Flat, which Paderewski in¬
cluded in his repertoire, made him inter¬
nationally known. After 1906 his sym-

phonic work's began to be played by the
orchestras of Warsaw, Berlin and Vien¬
na. In accordance with the traditional
practice of that time, an ambitious
patron and man of taste, Prince
Wladislaw Lubomirski, offered him the
hospitality of his palace in Vienna and
recommended him to the "Universal
Edition" publishing house which was to
publish all his works except for the ballet
Harnasie, the Fourth Symphonie Con¬
certante, and the Second Violin Concer¬
to, which appeared under the imprint of
the Paris house of Max Eschig.
Szymanowski's compositions between
1906 and 1910 reflected his enthusiasm
for the work of Max Reger, Richard
Strauss, the impressionism of Debussy,
the guns began to thunder in the West he
was gripped by a fever of creativity and
began to produce a flow ofmajor works .
His First Violin Concerto, inspired by
the Polish poet Tadeusz Micinski's May
Song, is a hymn to love which .rises,
against a background of inexpressible
anguish. The Third Symphony (The
Song of the Night) for orchestra, tenor
and choir, is quite different; written to
words by the great Persian Sufi poet
Rumi (13th century AD) this .gigantic
work evokes the heaving of the ocean
through its rich canvas of sound, and
culminates in a meditation bordering on
ecstasy: "God and I are alone..."

### 50955: Szymanowski: a great composer rediscovered
piano, the best-known piece being the
demanding Fountain ofArethusa. On his
way to Africa Szymanowski had spent
some time in Sicily, still imbued with the
heritage of ' 'greater Greece" , and where
he discovered Antiquity. The Myths are
a reflection of this revelation.
After the Treaty of Versailles the com¬
poser and his family returned from
Elisavetgrad, where they had moved in
1 9 1 7, to a Poland reborn. After 1 920 his
works increasingly drew inspiration from
folklore songs, dances, fiddler's im-
provizations, especially those of the
sobriquet, "romantic of modernity",
was fully deserved. As time went by,
however, his technique became increas¬
ingly refined and rigorous. His oratorio
Stabat Mater, universally considered to
be a masterpiece, was produced when he
was at the height of his powers.
Szymanowski's growing authority was
recognized when he was appointed direc¬
tor of the Warsaw conservatory in 1 927,
but the envy of some of his fellow-
musicians and government intrigues led
him to resign in 1932. This was a blow
from which he never recovered. But
Szymanowski did not need direct
mountain-dwellers of the Tatra massif.
But when he introduces popular melodies
and the rhythms of peasant dances into
such compositions as the oratorio Stabat
Mater, the ballet Harnasie, and the
Fourth Symphonie Concertante,
Szymanowski uses the same freedom and
orchestral refinement as a Prokofiev, a
Bartok or a Stravinsky.
He rarely abandoned the tonal system.
In his rare atonal experiments he went
close to the serial writing of Schoenberg,
without however employing a complete
twelve-tone system. He was attached
above all to the originality of melodic
lines and to their scintillation and éclat,
wishing to express in music the profound
and unchanging feelings of mankind. His

classroom contact in order to influence
such musicians as Grazyna Bacewicz,
Witold Lutoslawski, Tadeusz Baird and
Krzysztof Penderecki. Although at times
they resisted Szymanowski's "roman¬
ticism" these young artists nevertheless
profited from the lessons taught them by
the work of their older contemporary.
While the master was encountering
difficulties in his own country, elsewhere
his successes were bringing him recogni¬
tion as a leading figure in European
music. In 1929 he was awarded the Order
of the Italian Crown and in the follow¬
ing year he became a member of the
Prague Academy of Sciences and Arts.
In 1931 he was awarded the French
Legion of Honour, and became an
honorary member of the International
Society for Contemporary Music, to
which Richard Strauss, Manuel de Falla,
Maurice Ravel, Stravinsky, Bêla Bartok
and others also belonged.
Between 1924 and 1926
Szymanowski's First Violin Concerto
was performed by such musicians as
Sampigny in Paris, Pawel Kochanski in
New York, Stokowski and Huberman in
Vienna. Between 1929 and 1937, the
Stabat Mater was sung in Naples, Vien¬
na, Brussels, Paris, Klagenfurt, Warsaw,
New York, Dusseldorf and Chicago. The
ballet Harnasie was performed between
1935 and 1937 in a concertante version
in Cleveland and New York, and danc¬
ed in Prague, Paris, Belgrade and Ham¬
burg. Szymanowski himself was the
soloist when his Fourth Symphonie Con¬
certante for piano and orchestra was per¬
formed in Copenhagen, Moscow,
Amsterdam, Bucharest, Stockholm,
Paris and London.
Szymanowski's last great success also
brought him great distress. In 1936 his
ballet Harnasie was staged at the Paris
Opera to choreography by Serge Lifar
who danced the principal role. The critics
unanimously showered praise on the
composer. Unfortunately, a few days
after the opening night, a fire broke out
in the corridors and the ballet had to be
transferred to the Théâtre des Champs
Elysées. But there were no offers of fur¬
ther performances.
In 1937 Szymanowski died of tuber¬
culosis, an illness he had contracted in
childhood and one which was at that time
often incurable.
Two years later the Second World War
unleashed by Hitler swept through
Europe, destroying Poland and erasing
the great musician's name from memory.
Then, with the return of peace a certain
avant-garde which was in some cases
more attached to tradition than to in¬
novation slowed down the rediscovery of
a composer who, formerly dubbed a
"romantic" had in the meantime become
a "classic" because of the vigour and
beauty of his art.
In spring 1975 Szymanowski's opera
King Roger was staged at Sadlers Wells
in London by the New Opera Company.
It was a triumphant success and set off
a chain reaction, with more and more
performances of King Roger being put
on in various parts of the world. A recent
example: Szymanowski's opera scored a
triumph at the Teatro Colón in Buenos
Aires in autumn 1981.
The centenary of Szymanowski's
birth, inscribed on Unesco's world calen¬
dar of anniversaries, is a fitting moment
to contribute to the revival of his music
in a world which more than ever stands
in need of the beauty and peace which
music can bring.

### 50956: Bharati, poet and patriot
Bharati,
poet and patriot
by K. Swaminathan
INDIA is celebrating this year the
centenary of Subramania Bharati
(1882-1921), whom Tamils regard
as a Mahakavi (Great Poet) and
Amarakavi (Immortal Poet), and whom
historians regard as one of the most
authentic voices of modern India pro¬
claiming the unity of the nation, its pas¬
sionate longing for freedom and the
human cry for universal brotherhood. In
his brief working life of two decades,
Bharati, as journalist, poet and patriot,
brought about a revolution in Tamil
literature and in the thinking of the Tamil
people. He combined profound
knowledge of and admiration for the
eternal elements in the ancient Tamil
tradition with a forward-looking accep¬
tance of the ideal of human unity. Thus
he brought Tamil prose and poetry into
close contact with contemporary reality
by using the language of common speech
in his songs and poems dealing with cur¬
rent topics like indentured labour, the
rape of Belgium, the great Russian
Revolution and the demand for national
integration and real Swaraj
(independence).
Subramania was born on December
11,1 882, in Ettayapuram in Tirunelveli
district of the then Madras Presidency.
His father Chinnaswami Iyer was in the
service of the local Zamindar or chief¬
tain. Subramanian's mother died when
he was an infant. The father wished his
first son to become an English-educated
officer or engineer. But the boy took
little interest in such "bread-winning"
studies and failed in the matriculation ex¬
amination at the end of his high school
course.
But even during school days he had
created a stir among students and
teachers by his spontaneous gift of ver¬
sification. At 1 5 , he was married to 7 year
old Chellammal. He was then provided
the sinecure job of reading daily
newspapers to the local chieftain. About
this time the title "Bharati" was confer¬
red on him by a gathering of poets at a
court function. Henceforth, literary
K. SWAMINATHAN, Indian educator and jour¬
nalist, has been since 1960 chief editor of the
"Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi", the
Government of India's project to publish a
multi-volume edition of Mahatma Gandhi's
writings and speeches.

Relations Department, Govern¬
ment of Tamil Nadu, Madras.
circles knew him as Subramania Bharati
ór just "Bharati" (embodiment of
Saraswati, Goddess of learning).
This idyll in his home-town was short¬
lived. Within a year, his father passed
away, leaving the family in straitened cir¬
cumstances. Bharati moved to Varanasi
to be with his aunt there. The two years
he spent in Varanasi brought about a
great change in his outer personality and
inner vision; he gained a sound
knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi and
English; passed with credit the Entrance
Examination of the Allahabad Univer¬
sity; and read and enjoyed the English
Romantic poets, especially Shelley.
In search ofa livelihood, Bharati went
back to Ettayapuram in 1901, where he
taught Tamil in a high school for a short
period. When Bharati was 22, he came
into contact with G.Subramania Iyer,
editor of a leading Tamil daily , Swadesa
Mithran, published from Madras. The
young man was invited to join the daily
as a sub-editor. His fluency and facility
as a translator enabled him to bring to
the Tamil public the inspired utterances
of Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo
Ghose and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Soon
the rebel in Bharati drew him into the
vortex of Indian politics. Hi's original ar¬
ticles in his inimitable style espousing
' 'extremism" were read widely. The next
and final step was the transformation of
Tamil poetry by Bharati's use of his;
unique lyrical power for the expression i
ofmodern ideas for rousing the pride and I
patriotism of the people.

bundle of palm leaves on which are inscribed,
in Tamil, the first words of one of his poems
or, as here, the invocation pronounced before
the singing of hymns of the temple of Chidam¬
baram, a shrine held In high veneration in Tamil
Nadu. Some thousand years later, another
Tamil poet, Subramania Bharati was to write:
Ye foolish folk, who roam about
In search of myriad fancied gods.
Have ye not heard the myriad scriptures
Declare knowledge alone is God?

Department, Madras
The movement against the British rule
in India gained a new momentum with
the partition of Bengal in 1905 and
engulfed the whole country. The
"moderate" Swadesa Mithran could not
accommodate the fiery writings of
Bharati. So he left it to join a new Tamil
weekly India and threw in his lot with the
extremist elements in the Indian National
Congress which the British Government
were trying to put down by arrests and
imprisonment.
To avoid possible arrest, Bharati fled
to Pondicherry which was then a French
settlement in South India, and he con¬
tinued to edit from there the weekly In¬
dia. Then followed a period ofgrim trials
and tribulations under the constant
surveillance of the British and the French
police. But there was ample recompense
for these sufferings in his friendship with
Sri Aurobindo, V.V.S. Iyer,
Subramanya Siva and other patriots who
too had sought refuge in Pondicherry.
Though Bharati experienced moments of
depression, poetry continued to be ' 'the
anchor of his purest thoughts, thenurse,
the guide, the guardian of his heart, and
soul of all his moral being".
Bharati came out of his self-exile on
November 2, 1918, and was promptly ar¬
rested and kept in police custody for 24
days. However, on the intervention of
some eminent public workers, he was
conditionally released, and was soon
back in his native district, Tirunelveli. His
"extremism" had somewhat mellowed
by then and he soon gravitated towards
the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi . It was
at this juncture that his old paper
Swadesa Mithran welcomed him back to
Madras. He lived in Triplicane, a suburb
Right, 1 1th-century sculpture from
East Bengal representing Sarasvati
the Hindu goddess of learning and
the arts. In one of her personifica¬
tions she was given the name of
Bharati, a title which was confer¬
red on the great Tamil poet
Subramania by a group of his
fellow poets as a tribute to his
talent. From then on he was
known as Subramania Bharati, or
simply, Bharati.

of Madras city, free for a while from ab¬
ject poverty.
But soon came the end. In an attempt
to befriend the temple elephant at
Triplicane, he offered as usual a coconut
to the animal unaware that it was in rut.
Struck down by the mighty trunk and
thrown aside, he suffered grave injuries.
Though he was promptly rescued and
taken to hospital, he lay seriously ill for
a few days and passed away peacefully
onSeptember 12, 1921,attheageof39.
Bharati has left behind an impressive
and imperishable mass of poetry and
prose. Beside his widely popular patriotic
poems, special mention may be made of
his exquisite love-lyrics and nature-
poems, and his three masterpieces; Kuyil
Pattu (an allegorical narrative), Kannan
Pattu (lyrics in a variety of moods on
Lord Krishna) and Panchali Sapatham
(the Vow of Panchali, an epic fragment
from the Mahabharata filled with thrill¬
ing contemporary overtones).

### 50957: Hue, a city in peril
Hue, a city in peril
The history of Viet Nam
Anew book by Mr. Le Thành Khôi,
a teacher at the Sorbonne and a
Unesco consultant, presents the
fullest portrait so far of the history of Viet
Nam from its origins to 1 858 (the date of
French intervention). Drawing on the best
Vietnamese, Chinese and European
sources, and taking account of the most
recent archaeological discoveries in Viet
Nam, the author traces the development
of Vietnamese civilization.
The earliest Vietnamese kingdom. Van
Lang, appeared during the Bronze Age,
some time in the seventh century BC. The
dispersion pattern of the famous decorated
drums of Dong-son reveals how its culture
spread through southern China and south¬
east Asia. It shared many characteristics
with other cultures of the region, including
slash and burn farming, irrigation, the use
of stone hoes and bronze ploughs,
totemism, tattooing and building on piles.
Viet Nam was invaded by the Han in the
second century BC, and for over a thou¬
sand years formed part of the Chinese em¬
pire which introduced iron and brought
Confucianism and Taoism (Buddhism
came from the south). But integration on¬
ly went so far. Thanks to a vigorous and
firmly established culture, to the economic
base offered by the Red River delta, to a
relatively numerous population and to the
solid structure of their village communities,
the Viet were able (and here, perhaps, they
are a unique case among the peoples south
of the Yangtze) to preserve their identity
and their language and finally, after many
vicissitudes, to recover their independence
in the twentieth century.
The construction of the Vietnamese na¬
tion followed a dual rhythm: resistance to
periodic invasions from the north, and the
"march to the south" of a farming people
which, pressing forward to conquer new
lands, clashed first with the Chams and
then with the Khmers. The monarchical
system, at first "patrimonial" and based
on the royal clan, became "bureaucratic"
in the fifteenth century with Confucianism
as the official doctrine and a corps of of¬
ficials recruited by civil service examina¬
tions of a literary nature.
But after a period of vigour Confucianism
lost its vitality. In the nineteenth century,
before foreign intervention, a combination
of intellectual rigidity, economic stagnation
and social tensions which resulted in
numerous peasant revolts, sounded the
death knell of the monarchy. In literature,
however, the eighteenth and early nine
teenth century saw the flowering of Viet¬
namese poetry. The author traces the
social significance of this poetry and
translates some fine examples of it.
Mr. Le Thành Khôi's work provides a
unique synthesis of the political history and
cultural development of Viet Nam. It is
richly documented and illustrated: there
are over a hundred illustrations of
prehistoric objects, Dong-son drums,
religious, civil and military architecture,
sculpture, painting, ceramics and calli¬
graphy. It is also an illuminating personal
contribution to historical debate on such
issues as the formation of Vietnamese na¬
tionality, the "feudal" or "Asiatic" nature
of the ancient system of production, and
the re-establishment of Vietnamese unity
in the eighteenth and nineteenth century.
It is an indispensable reference book not
only for specialists and teachers but forthe
general reader and all those who are in¬
terested in Viet Nam and want to under¬
stand in depth certain aspects of the situa¬
tion there today.

### 50957: Hue, a city in peril
Once the capital of the Nguyen dynasty, the city of Hue, in Viet Nam,
stands on the north bank of the River of Perfumes, twelve kilometres
from the coast. Grouped within the "Imperial City" and the "Forbid¬
den Purple City", which constituted the heart of the royal capital, are
a number of early 19th-century buildings or remains of buildings of high
artistic and architectural interest. To this huge urban architectural com¬
plex must be added the seven royal tombs, situated a few kilometres
to the south of the city, with their temples, palaces and gardens. To¬
day this shrine of Vietnamese culture is in a serious state of deteriora¬
tion. In addition to the damage resulting from the terrible fire of 1947
and the fighting which took place there in 1968, the buildings are suf¬
fering from the encroachment of tropical vegetation and the ravages
of time. At the end of the war, in 1 975, the Government of the Socialist
Republic of Viet Nam began carrying out the most urgent provisional
protection measures. In November 1 981 , within the context of Unesco's
general aim of preserving the cultural heritage of mankind, Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow, the Director-General of Unesco, launched an interna¬
tional appeal for the preservation and restoration of the city of Hue. The
initial stage of the long-term project adopted by the Unesco General Con¬
ference covers the restoration or reconstruction of fifteen monuments
and two tombs over the period 1981 to 1986. Photos show: (1) The
eastern entrance to the Imperial City; (2) The tomb of Minh Mang; (3)
The gardens surrounding the tomb of Minh Mang; (4) The Mien Lac Cac
pavilion of the Imperial City; (5) Interior of the Ta Vu, damaged by fire
in 1947; (6) The mandarin's esplanade at the tomb of Khal Dinh.

Politicaldecisions are made by governments, andresponsibility
for the arms race rests squarely on their shoulders. However,
scientists and their engineer colleagues have been depicted as
arch villains, fuelling the arms race byputting their knowledge
at the disposal of military prowess, with little or no thought
as to anti-social consequences.
This over-simplification isfalse, but to what extent? Scientists
as a group are among the most highly educated in thepopula¬
tion; many have thought profoundly and have written about
different aspects oftheir involvement in military undertakings,
especially after the advent ofnuclear weapons in the Second
World War.
In this book, a group ofeminent scientists and scholars con¬
sider all aspects of this question, particularly with reference
to nuclear weapons, under the following broad headings:
Role of science and technology in the arms race.
Role of scientists in the arms race.
Movements of scientists against the arms race.
