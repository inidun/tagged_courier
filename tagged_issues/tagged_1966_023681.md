Woman of Sumer
The civilization which flourished in Mesopotamia over 5,000 years ago in the valleys of
the Tigris and Euphrates attained its zenith in Sumer. Statuettes, pottery, jewellery, gold
plate and furnishings recovered from the sites of Sumerian cities reveal the artistry of
this ancient people. This head of a woman from Uruk (present-day Warka), a work of
rare beauty carved in alabaster, is one of the Sumerian art treasures in the Baghdad
Museum (Iraq), some of which were recently on view in the Louvre Museum, Paris. The
eyes and eyebrows were originally inlaid, like those of most Sumerian statuettes.

### 78426: The Rains that did not come

THE RAINS
THAT
DID NOT COME
4
ILLIONS of people in India are faced with a
grave shortage of food, and even starvation,
because of the rains that did not come last year.
The Indian farmer is utterly dependent on the monsoon
rains that normally fall from July to September. The baked
earth containing the newly-sown seed hungrily absorbs the
downpour to a great depth. Then, sated, it can imbibe
no more and the farmlands take on the appearance of an
area stricken by floods. But without this annual flooding
the crops wither and die in the blazing summer sun.
Last year the monsoon rains started at the usual time,
but they soon tapered off and then stopped. The failure
of the rains was of such proportions that the India govern¬
ment described it in an official white paper as "a natural
calamity of a magnitude unknown In recent times".
Some 10 million tons of rice, corn, millet and pulses
perished in the parched earth around Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Madhya, Pradesh, Mysore and parts of
Andhra and Orissa. In September and October the rains
which should have given life to the crops for harvest this
spring also failed. This has meant a probable loss of a
further two to three million tons of food.
In 1964/65 India produced 88 million tons of food grains
and imported a further 6.5 million tons, bringing food
available for the year to 94 million tons. This year the
country has been able to grow only 76 million tons and,
with population increasing by 12 million a year, she would
need more than 96 million tons to maintain last year's
level of subsistence which could by no means be described
as lavish.
Even taking into account government stocks of a little
over two million tons and about the same quantity of
private stocks, the government of India soon realized that
the country's needs would be between 11 and 14 million
tons short. In any country such a proportionate shortfall
would have been critical. In India, vast both in area and
population, it could be disastrous.
The precariousness of this situation has long been
obvious to many people, not least to the Indian government.
In 1963 the late Jawaharlal Nehru, then Indian Prime
Minister, told a meeting of the Indian National Development
Council: "Agriculture is more Important than anything
else including the big plants you may have, because that
sets the tone to Indian progress. That gives you the
wherewithal of progress. If we fail in agriculture then you
fail inevitably and consequently in industry also."
FOR a time during the 1950s agricultural produc¬
tion in India was increasing by about three per
cent per year, but recently the increase has slowed down.
If agricultural production has stagnated, the growth of
population has not. India's population is today increasing
by 2.4 per cent per year more than 12 million people
every year bringing into the world with them a need
for two million more tons of food grains. This year India's
population will reach 500 million.
The net result has been that for several years, small
improvements which have been made in India's diet have
been owed to heavy food Imports. The Indian farmer has
merely kept step with the rising population until this
season.
The government took immediate practical steps to meet
the deteriorating situation. Rationing has been introduced

and á formula prepared for ensuring not only the equitable
distribution but equality of sacrifice, so that rice rations will
be the same throughout the country.
Port and railway facilities have been geared to offload
and distribute 1.2 million tons of imported supplies monthly,
while administrative arrangements to handle such
enormous supplies have been continuously improved. The
government is equally concerned about the coming crop
for which large quantities of nitrogenous fertilizers are
needed. It requires at least an additional 150,000 tons of
nitrogen from abroad to supplement local production and
what has already been arranged for purchase. Availability
of shipping has become a key factor.
International response to India's plight has been prompt.
In a joint appeal to other countries to aid India, Dr. B.R.
Sen, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Orga
nization, estimated that 15 million to 20 million children
aged between one and 14 years were in a particularly
vulnerable position. The situation was already assuming
famine proportions and could be expected to worsen
progressively during the next few months. U Thant, United
Nations Secretary-General, and Dr. Sen reported that
130,000 tons of powdered milk were needed, besides up
to 14 million tons of food grains. His Holiness the Pope
also issued a stirring statement on India's plight,
beseeching people of all faiths everywhere to help.
The United States promised speeded-up delivery of three
million tons of grain out of its food exports to India for
the year, and Canada promised 15 million dollars worth
of wheat. Australia announced that it would give India
about nine million dollars worth of wheat and milk powder,
and Sweden offered 3.5 million dollars worth of dried

TREE OF LIFE
In India's hot weather season,
people count the sweltering
days and eagerly watch
for the first
sign of leaves on
the tree they call
"the rain tree" (>ight).
Conjured forth by the first traces
of moisture carried
in over the sea,
its leaves are the harbingers
of the approaching monsoon.
The winds which then begin
to blow from the Indian Ocean
usher in the period
from June to October
when life-giving rain drenches
the parched earth.
But there are good
and bad monsoon years.
If rainfall is uneven
or fails completely,
as it did last
September and October.
harvests are imperilled.
Indian agriculture
has rightly been called
"a gamble in rain."

skimmed milk. Britain had already made an interest-free
loan of 7.5 million pounds.
The score of countries promising aid were joined by
private donations, both organized and individual. Within
less than three weeks, for example, RAI, the Italian State
Radio and TV network, collected more than 11 million
dollars from its listeners, while in the Netherlands five
million dollars were collected from listeners and viewers
In 10 days.
Within the limits of its resources the United Nations
family was also rendering aid. At the direction of FAO's
Director-General, the UN/FAO World Food Programme
has committed 7,000 tons of dried skimmed milk for
children and nursing or expectant mothers, besides 54,000
tons of wheat. These supplies were timed to arrive in
India before the monsoon rains come and

On his return to Rome after a month's tour of India,
Dr. Sen spoke of the Indian government's gratitude for
the spontaneous manifestation of goodwill towards her
throughout the world. He said: "The fact that actual
famine has not occurred and starvation deaths are so far
not evident should not be construed as the government
having raised a false alarm. On the contrary there is real
shortage of food over a widely dispersed area and the
government have acted with commendable foresight in
taking preventive measures at an early stage. Even now,
difficult months lie ahead, and much will depend on the
speed with which foreign supplies will reach India before
the monsoons break in July."

and air transport may also be used for meeting sudden
local crises but, in general, the great quantities of food
needed, and the distances it must be carried will prevent
India from being fed by air. In short, even if India can
find an extra 10 to 12 million tons of food overseas there
will be great difficulties in the way of carrying it to the
people who need it. Even with severe rationing and every
measure conceivable to conserve the food available and
make it go the longest distance, the food situation will
deteriorate until September. Then, if the rains come this
year, there will be a new crop and new hope in India.
The present food crisis has shown how precarious is
the balance between subsistence and starvation. One bad
harvest can upset this balance and bring a severe crisis.
The government of India is fully conscious of this and
has decided to accord the highest priority to agriculture
in its fourth five-year plan.

AN ANSWER
THE VAGERIES
THE MONSOON
The possibilities that could be opened up in monsoon
Asia by properly conceived control and use of water are
well illustrated by a case study carried out by FAO of
the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra basin (1).
Although it is a region with an old civilization, densely
settled, and with heavy pressure of population on land
combined with extreme poverty, the basic resources of
land and water are grossly under-utilized. For the most
part, agricultural operations are confined to the few months
of the year when the monsoon rains provide adequate
moisture, and there is a general lack of useful occupation
for up to eight months of the year, while the vast bodies
of water carried by the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the
Megna (about 1,000 million acre feet a year) roll almost
unhindered into the Bay of Bengal.
Adequate explanation of this situation can be found in
terms of historical development but adequate justification
does not exist in terms of present-day techniques. Over
the centuries, agricultural practices have adjusted
themselves to the rhythm of the monsoon, which with 1,000
to 2,000 millimeters has made it possible to do without
irrigation, even though a late start or failure during the
critical flowering period can cause a partial crop failure.
Thus both farmers and the government agricultural
services have accustomed themselves to a system of
predominantly monocultural cropping. Such irrigation
schemes as have been developed in the postwar years
have been directed mainly at ensuring against failure of
the monsoon rather than for irrigation during the dry season.
Starting from the proposition that with cultivable land
scarce and water abundant, resources should be developed
toward a pattern which would make maximum use of the
land, the study of the Lower Ganges-Brahmaputra basin
examined the extent of the possibilities for a system of
perennial irrigation.
On the basis of a tentative assessment of water resources
in relation to irrigable land, the conclusion was reached
that it may be possible to provide an adequate water supply
throughout the year to more than half of the cultivable
area in the alluvial plain; while irrigation could be furnished
to a further area for two of the three seasons during which
crops could be grown, given favourable temperatures.

FRONTIERS
by Gordon Ash
H URRICANES, volcanic
eruptions, earthquakes
and floods are natural disasters which
make a dramatic impact on the public's
mind; they are tragic events which
immediately make headline news. But
what of drought? An examination of
the position in India and Africa today
provides a very direct answer. When
the rains fail, this does not hit the
headlines; but the consequences of
drought are certainly disastrous and
hundreds of thousands of people are
faced with the threat of famine.
In a developed country, when a
spell of drought is experienced, the
natural resources have been exploited
to such a degree that the economy
suffers little damage. However, in
a developing area where water may
well be one of the most valuable natu-

ral resources but remains unexploited,
suffering on a large scale is inevitable.
India has concentrated on harnes¬
sing water power and her many river
projects have provided irrigation for
vast acreages. With further improve¬
ments in agricultural methods, particu¬
larly in making extensive use of ferti¬
lizers to increase yields, she can
step up production in an endeavour to
defeat the problems created by popu¬
lation growth.
The reverse applies in areas of Afri¬
ca where perennial drought conditions
have been experienced. For example,
Basutoland has great water resources
and in Bechuanaland there are areas
where water courses could be exploit¬
ed. This is also true of Matabeleland
(Rhodesia), parts of Kenya and other
African countries. Surely now is the
time for an urgent examination of the
position and, no doubt, large-scale
hydrological surveys should be insti¬
tuted without delay and development
should be actively pursued so that
there will be an absolute guarantee
that when the next bad drought cycle
hits Africa, India or any other areas,
possibly at present producing man's
greatest hazard, they should be so
equipped as to take such an eventu¬
ality in their stride.
AN will find it hard to fight
against "established" des¬
erts although this is a subject worthy
of constant examination but it is
surely admitting failure in the twentieth
century if we are prepared to sit back
and permit desert encroachment on
any scale.
During an extensive tour which I
made of the drought-stricken areas of
southern, central and eastern Africa
last year, the huge dust spirals rising
from the parched land provided a cons¬
tant reminder that the long spell of
drought in some parts over five or
more years had not only caused
human suffering and cattle losses on
a large scale, but had wrought heavy
damage to the land, increasing the
dangers of extensive erosion. In the
forests, a soft wood tree would
collapse at the touch of a mere
finger-tip; the loss of vegetation in
the water courses is equally serious.
One agricultural expert in Bechu¬
analand, referring to an area in the
northwest of the country, was not wide
of the mark in suggesting we would find
areas of petrified forest.

Committee for Famine Relief, generally
known as OXFAM (1), provided many
shocks: the extreme cases of malnu¬
trition and the obvious signs of the
protein deficiency diseases like kwas¬
hiorkor and pellagra. In Bechuanaland,
100,000 persons a fifth of the popula¬
tion were destitute; crops had failed
and staggering cattle losses were being
experienced. It is estimated that herds
previously totalling 1.3 million head
will be reduced to something like half
a million by the time the next rains
are due in September.
Although heavy rains have recently
been experienced, they came too late

be destitute in this country (the total
population is 540,000) and famine relief
feeding will have to continue to some
degree until June 1967.
ATTLE are so desperate
for fodder that when the
rains arrive and green shoots appear,
many die from scour through consum¬
ing sand whilst attempting to graze.
Althrough the British Government has
provided funds to keep some breeding
stock and trek oxen alive, this is a
blow from which Bechuanaland (which
will become independent as Botswana
in September) will take years to
recover.
Conditions in the mountain areas of
Basutoland were fairly desperate and,
added to drought, the people were
facing a severe winter with sub-zero
temperatures. Since my visit, relief
supplies have been reaching these
remote mountain fastnesses.
Recently, heavy rain has filled the
dams and flooded roads but this has
not saved the bulk of the maize and
sorghum on which the people depend
for their staple food. So the Ministry
of Agriculture has launched a crash
programme to persuade farmers to
plant winter wheat and peas for food,
and barley, rye or oats for fodder.
Though there has also been heavy
rain in some areas of Rhodesia, the
worst affected region, Matabeleland,
will need several good rainy seasons
to give it a chance to recover from
five years with drought conditions.
The number of people dependent
on famine relief as a result of the
effects of last year's drought in Kenya
has fluctuated between 313,000 last
November and 230,000 in January. The
present forecast is that there will still
be 163,000 people needing famine relief
between April and September this year.

Equipped to fight
future droughts
last August finished earlier than usual
so that the "short rains" maize crop
is not up to standard. The main maize
crop which depends on the "long
rains" beginning in March, will not be
harvested until July onwards.
Meanwhile Kenya, as In the case of
Basutoland and Bechuanaland, will be
relying on food supplies provided un¬
der the United Nations World Food
Programme. Last year, the planning
involved in mounting this exercise, due
to communications and transportation
difficulties, was tremendous. I had the
pleasure of meeting one U.N. official
in Gaberones, capital of Bechuanaland,
who was faced with the problem of
arranging for shipments to be un¬
loaded in South African ports to be
railed up to points in Bechuanaland.
Needless to say, he found the answer.
Last year OXFAM spent some
£97,000 in the drought areas of Africa
and its grants included contributions to
feeding schemes, to the costs of dis¬
tributing supplies, boreholes, earth
stock dams and help with the provision
of seeds for Bechuanaland and Kenya.
The United Nations, individual govern¬
ments and the missions and voluntary
agencies all made every endeavour to
alleviate human suffering.
I was greatly moved by the fund-
raising efforts being made in each
country. Despite their serious cir
cumstances, considerable sums were
raised and devoted to relief program¬
mes. Africans and Europeans were
sitting down together to plan emerg¬
ency measures. Surely, co-operation
will continue to pay handsome divi¬
dends if the attack is maintained ruth¬
lessly. Famine relief has been pro¬
vided and will be necessary for some
time to come but famine prevention
measures must be stepped-up in the
fight against the world's most cruel
enemy: hunger.
O XFAM likes to act quickly
in providing relief following
man-made and natural disasters, but at
the same time the main part of its
programme is devoted to schemes
designed to help people to help them¬
selves in achieving better living stand¬
ards.
An agricultural demonstration farm in
the mountains of Basutoland, financed
by the organization is a certain pointer
to a better way of life for a remote
people. Outside the capital, Maseru,
it has helped the Department of Agri¬
culture to conduct experiments with
fishponds so that this activity can
safety be multiplied to provide a valu¬
able source of vital protein. Assistance

I was much impressed by the success
of the small unit African farms.
Projects being supported in Bechu¬

can be better equipped to fight against
future drought cycles. There is a need
to exploit water resources, improve
farming methods, control grazing, con¬

Since 1962, OXFAM has spent over

In helping them to eradicate the root
causes of poverty, disease and igno¬

However, a year In which OXFAM
was concentrating on providing emerg¬
ency aid for Africa ended with its
attention moving to another area facing
the threat of famine: India. In Decem¬
ber, as part of a crash programme to
increase food production in Mysore

the shipment of 5,300 tons of fertilizer
costing £105,000. This will enable far¬
mers to plant 10,000 acres of land irri¬
gated by the Tungabhadra Dam with
a quick maturing hybrid maize which
will produce an output four times
greater than the normal yield. About
30,000 tons of grain, which will provide
food for 600,000 people for six months
on a famine ration of 8 ounces per head
per day, will be produced together
with 100,000 tons of needed fodder.
This scheme will be conducted in co¬
operation with the University of Agri¬
cultural Sciences at Bangalore. Apart
from providing an additional supply
of food and fodder, it will help the
farmers concerned to demonstrate the
value of fertilizers. The farmers will
buy the fertilizer and the repayments
in rupees will be used to provide any
assistance that may be required else¬
where in India. The first shipments of
fertilizer have already arrived in
Mysore State.
As a voluntary agency, OXFAM can
only provide aid which is small when
weighed against the world's total
needs. But as the Mysore State pro¬
ject shows, it has great significance
and is complementary to the large-
scale assistance which governments,
through the United Nations or indivi¬
dually, can provide.

### 25433: Rice, mainstay of life for 1,100 million human beings

Mainstay of life
for 1,100 million
human beings
by Stanley Baron
Most of the world's
rice Is produced In Asia
where the average
person eats about
220 pounds a year.
The greater part goes no
further than the farm
where it is grown;
less than one-twentieth
moves across frontiers as
imports or exports. Right,
harvest time for Indian rice
farmers in Terai, at
the foot of the Himalayas.
O

|N any given morning this month 1,100 million
human beings will rise to face a future in which
the whole of their lives will be dominated by a single
word: rice. They are the rice-eating peoples of the world,
spread through the monsoon areas of Asia and elsewhere,
for whom rice means practically the whole of their diet,
nearly all their agriculture and much of their hopes.
Once again, like their ancestors throughout history, they
will sow the seed when the monsoon rains arrive and
before the river floods have come. As the waters rise,
the plants will grow. Later the water will drop back grad¬
ually until the paddy field is dry and the harvest can be
gathered. This is the moment of truth for which every
family has waited. Some will know a reasonable plenty
enough for modest rations lasting the year round. Many,
probably the majority, will have barely enough for an ade¬
quate standard of life. Others, having sold off their sur¬
pluses in attempts to make ends meet, will again end the
year in debt to the itinerant rice trader.
For more than a third of the population of the world
this is the round of life. Most will live it at the lowest
level of efficiency, health and comfort. It is to them that
the Food and Agriculture Organization has dedicated the
twelve months of 1966 as International Rice Year.
Supported by nearly every rice-producing country in the
world, the message of Rice Year is that the old ways
will no longer avail; men must use every device of science
to extract the maximum from the rice fields.
In 23 countries, special efforts will be made for the mul¬
tiplication and distribution of improved seeds, the expand¬
ed use of fertilizer, better water management, mechaniza¬
tion programmes, and pest and disease control. Besides
direct aid to farmers, it is hoped that rice experimental
stations will be increased and at least one apprentice
training centre established. There will be field demonstra¬
tions of machinery, equipment and cultural techniques.
An educational drive will include films and the distribu¬
tion, through extension services, of booklets, pamphlets
and monographs on improved methods of cultivation,
marketing and storage. Television and radio will be asked
to broadcast special programmes, and schools, universities
and rural centres will provide exhibitions and lectures. At
least 16 countries will hold National Rice Weeks. Four
of them, Dahomey, Japan, the United Arab Republic and
the United States, will print special postage stamps.
On the scientific side, fellowships for training and
research are being offered by India, Japan, the Nether¬
lands and the United Kingdom while, as a spur to the men
already in the fields and laboratories, there will be an inter¬
national competition for the best research papers. These

moves are especially important, for the application of
science and modern technology, rather than a mere exten¬
sion of the paddy fields, offers the best hope of a break¬
through.
Up to now, except in a very few countries, neither
science nor technology has kept pace with the plough.
In bold attempts to feed their bursting populations, Asia
has in a decade added more than 25 million acres to
her paddy, Latin America more than 4 million acres and
Africa about 750,000 acres.
It is harder to know the facts about Mainland China,
the world's biggest producer and consumer. The govern¬
ment has issued no official figures since reporting a big
increase in production in 1958, and unkind weather in
succeeding years seems to have held the country back
somewhat. But last year's harvests probably added about
90 million tons of paddy (rice still in husk) to the rest of
the world's total, making some 260 million tons in all.
Leaving Mainland China aside, world production has
gone up In less than a decade by an average of 25 per¬
cent. All of which sounds and is indeed heartening.
But one must also ask: how much more was produced
per acre? This is the acid test, for gains in yields are
fundamental to lasting progress. At present the gain is
minimal: 1.4 percent per year in the world as a whole.
The developed countries, none of them big producers
by Asian standards, have made the greatest advances in
rice production. Even allowing for the fact that their crops
are grown on prime acreage whereas Asia must use big
areas of marginal land, the following figures, showing
average yields per acre in 1961-64, tell their own story:
Europe: 800,000 acres - 4,527 lb per acre
United States: 1,792,500 acres - 3,996 lb
Latin America: 10,700,000 acres - 1,665 lb
Asia: 208,625,000 acres - 1,602 lb
Africa: 8,175,000 acres - 1,539 lb
Australia, with only 57,500 acres, has achieved a world
record of 5,958 lbs per acre.
The general gain of 1.4 percent undoubtedly covers some
big individual advances, where scientists, economists and
farmers have been able to work effectively together. The
fact remains that primitive cultural practices, poor seeds,
shortage and cost of fertilizer, and inadequate irrigation
and drainage too often rob fields of their full potential.
The reason is partly economic. The greater part of the
world's rice goes no farther than the farm where it is
grown. Less than one twentieth moves across national
frontiers in the form of exports or imports. Much will
be stored under primitive conditions, subject to damage

THE CYCLE OE RICE
A collection of 18th century engravings reproduced
through the courtesy of the Victoria and Albert
Museum, London, portrays the seasons of rice
cultivation and the labours that lead to the harvest
of the oldest of man's cultivated grains. Many of
the methods they depict are still used in Asia today
(left). The complete collection of 24 prints was
executed about 1760 by a London engraver, John
June, and was printed by three publishers. A now
unknown artist, who signed himself "A.H.", redrew
the original Chinese works, which are believed to
have been brought back from Canton by an East
India trading vessel. At that time Chinese objects
of all kinds were greatly prized as curios. The
collection was purchased by the Victoria and Albert
Museum in 1887 and is now combined in a single
volume with a similar collection illustrating the manu¬
facture Of Silk. Photos & Victoria and Albert Museum, London

BICE (Cont'd)
Spectacular results and astronomic losses
by rats, mice, insects and rot, awaiting primitive and waste¬
ful milling, before being eaten by the farm family or sent
to the town or village market.
Here again, however, it is necessary to make a quali¬
fication: what looks like waste in western eyes may not
seem so in the East, where the cost of a new technique
is usually measured first against a tried tradition and only
finally against necessity i.e., the amount of rice needed
to sustain life. Nor are all traditional practices wrong.
They have enabled the average Asian to eat about 220
pounds of rice a year.
Still, this production level does not meet the require¬
ments of a good and expanding life. To the farmer tied
to archaic ways, International Rice Year intends to convey
the point that the paddy can mean more than bare
subsistence it can mean a bicycle, a better house, better
clothes for the family and education for the children, all
the things that make life more than an endless battle
with poverty.
VEN the most sophisticated consumer usually
i knows little of rice beyond the fact that it comes
in two main sorts the indica, or long-grained, and the
japónica, short-grained. The former commonly grown in
the tropics is the kind the housewife thinks of when she
asks for Patna rice for curries.
Long, medium and short, about 7,000 varieties of rice
grow over a wider range of latitudes, climates and altitudes,
and soils than any other cereal crop. Thriving round the
equator, rice has also been cultivated profitably as far north
as Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It has been successfully
established at 10,000 feet in the Himalayas and in the
tropical swamps of Liberia. The only limiting factor, in fact,
seems to be water; for although there are drought-resistant
varieties, and research is going on in the hope of finding
more and better ones, none at present matches the yield
or reliability of rice grown in water.
The very adaptability of rice has to some extent held
back research until comparatively modern times; for when
a crop is so readily grown, there is, as has been said,
a strong temptation to cope with increased demands sim¬
ply by increasing the growing areas rather than by con¬
centrating on improvement of the yields. But, if mankind
is to be adequately fed, both must be multiplied.
The scientist's attack on the problem is four-pronged. It
includes cultivation, whether by irrigation or otherwise;
improved varieties and better seeds; efficient fertilizing;
and effective pest, disease and weed control.
The economist must find ways of making it profitable
for the farmer to use these scientific improvements.
Finally, linking farmer, scientist, government official and
economist, it is the extension worker's job to give demons¬
trations and instruction in the approved new methods.
Through a number of projects, carried out with the aid
of the United Nations Expanded Programme of Technical
Assistance or the Special Fund, FAO experts have en¬
abled some countries to produce spectacular results.
Á striking example is the United Arab Republic, where
the problem was how to increase the crop without increas¬
ing the area. With 23 million inhabitants, the country has
less than 7 million cultivable acres. Every available square
foot has to 6e used. Called on for advice, FAO sent in
Dr. C.L. Pan, a Chinese expert. Studying the varieties
of rice grown, he decided, after many tests involving crop¬
ping, controlled irrigation, response to fertilizers and
resistance to disease, that one stood head and shoulders,
or perhaps one should say awns and stalks, above all
others. It was a variety labeled Y.M.47 in the U.A.R.
Ministry of Agriculture's seed stores. At Dr. Pan's suggest¬
ion, this was singled out for cultivation. The result has
been so successful that, since 1954, rice production has
doubled.
In Sudan, three FAO experts in succession have helped
to double rice yields through the use of improved varieties.
Now, after eight years of endeavour and assistance, Sudan
is able to grow enough, if necessary, for self-sufficiency
and could even produce a surplus for export.
Other projects are going ahead in Somalia, the Liberian
swamplands and Guinea. All have an importance beyond
the countries immediately concerned, for Africa needs
rice as the next step forward to a better diet than maize,
millet, yams or cassava flour, the present staples. There
is good reason to believe her present sporadic production
can be greatly increased once some of the difficulties,
including lack of irrigation, can be overcome.
Suitable rice varieties, however, vary from latitude to
latitude, as well as by country, and breeding has there¬
fore to take account of many conditions. Rice that does
well under irrigation, for example, would be useless on
African savannas or the South American prairies, where
it must be able to resist drought.
I NTERNATIONAL Rice Year will focus attention
also on the astronomic losses caused by
inefficient storage and processing. In countries where
storage amounts to little more than piling the paddy on the
ground, it is common for up to half of the crop to be spoiled,
or eaten by insects and rodents. In humid areas with a hot
climate, up to 30 percent loss is quite normal, and when
the paddy is dried and milled by the prevailing crude
methods another 8 to 12 per cent may be lost.
In Burma, one of the world's great rice-producing and
rice-exporting countries, the storage picture has been
changed by FAO experts who came at the government's
invitation in 1955. Improved storage units there now have
a capacity of 3 million tons. Besides reducing losses, they
enable the crop to await optimum market prices. At the
same time, low milling yields were found to be due in great
part to inefficient drying techniques. A Dutch expert, Gus
Huysmans, helped to install two artificial driers and has
since gone on to set up 12 state-owned rice mills that
demonstrate the value of modern machinery and methods.
In every country aiming at self-sufficiency a ton saved is ¿\
a ton gained, with an immediate benefit to the economy.
Processing and storing are indeed so vital in the lives

Protected from pests
and market fluctuations
of the rice-growing countries of the tropics that FAO hopes
to include model projects for each as part of the Interna¬
tional Rice Year, bringing specialized knowledge and facil¬
ities down to farm and village level, where they are most
needed.
Technical knowledge and application of research on rice
in the Far East are co-ordinated by the International Rice
Commission, originally set up by FAO and now with its
own secretariat at Bangkok. Through its working parties,
dealing with rice production and protection, agricultural
engineering (including irrigation), and fertilizers, it covers
every aspect of the agronomy of rice from plant breeding
and seed production to storage.
But of course rice also means trade and must mean so
increasingly, so that developing countries can gain foreign
exchange and thus build up their economies. For several
countries, among which Burma, Cambodia, Thailand and
Viet-Nam are outstanding, rice is by far the greatest export
earner. Unlike wheat, coffee and some other key commo¬
dities, however, it is not the subject of any formal trade
agreement. Instead, FAO member countries most concerned
have preferred to approach the problems of the world
market through the FAO's Consultative Subcommittee on
the Economic Aspects of Rice. Set up in 1955, it Is
counterpart of the International Rice Commission, doing
in the world of economics what the commission does in the
field of research and practice.
Its task, among others, is to keep international trade
under constant review and to aid the rice-producing coun¬
tries, whether exporters or importers, to develop their na¬
tional production plans, for their common good as a com¬
munity of trading nations and their individual good as
producers. The Consultative Subcommittee does this
through regular meetings of national rice experts who survey
the current market situation, as well as the long range
outlook, and exchange ideas on current problems and
plans.

I NE of the peculiarities of the world rice trade
as compared with other commodités is that
three quarters of it is carried on among developing
countries. In the richer, industrialized countries, rice,
though enjoyed "as a change," plays very little real part In
the national diets. Japan is practically alone among the
developed countries in eating it in such plenty that she
imports large quantities. Moreover, exporting to developed
countries faces fierce competition from United States and
Italian rice.
But improvements in quality and grading, closer attention
to market requirements, publicity compaigns and market
research all these, together with the abolition of Europe's
preferential tariffs, have been suggested as means of
aiding the exporting countries' sales.
Still, the largest market opportunities lie among the
developing countries themselves. Here there is the knotty
problem that, while some are trying to push their rice ex¬
ports, others, for currency reasons, have to restrict their
imports. A possible solution to this dilemma, being studied
by economic experts at FAO, is some form of infraregional
trade arrangement within groups of countries that are pre¬
pared to pursue their production and marketing policies
on a regional rather than on a national basis.
Meantime, the very precariousness of the rice trade
contains its own lesson. It Is that, if man is to survive, he
must co-operate. In the world of the paddy field, of back-
breaking labour under a hot sun on too often unresponsive
soil, this is especially so, because it Is by rice that a third of
the world lives. That third, by the end of the century, will,
at the present rate of population growth, have become more
than a half. Within the working lifetimes of children now
being born, the numbers of the rice-eating Asians may
vastly exceed the population of the whole of the rest of the
world put together.
It is to take up the monumental challenge of feeding
these people that International Rice Year has been laun¬
ched.

HE world's hungry 60 to 80 per cent of whom

only when a radical transformation occurs in their present
methods of food production and distribution... Much of
the work needed to introduce and sustain these changes
is educational in character and therefore directly concerns
Unesco. The fight against hunger and the fight against
illiteracy are, in a sense, two aspects of the same struggle."
In these words, Unesco's Director-General, M. René
Maheu, underlines the direct link between education and
food and shows why Unesco has been giving increasing
emphasis to agricultural education and science in its
world programme (1).
In co-operation with other United Nations agencies,
Unesco has helped its member states to:

agricultural education.

Spread agricultural knowledge and information through
Radio Rural Forums (see page 25).
Apply scientific research (including the social sciences)
to problems of food and agricultural production.
Unesco has also promoted research in large anu for
the most part as yet unproductive areas of the globe in
such fields as earth sciences, arid zones, humid tropics,
marine sciences, oceanography and hydrology (an
International Hydrological Decade began under Unesco
sponsorship on January 1, 1965 see the Unesco Courier,
"Water and Life", July-Aug. 1964). Such research may
well prove to be of great significance for the work of
agriculturists and food experts, as it could lead to the
discovery or creation of fresh sources of food.
To speed the development of agricultural education in
its member states, Unesco has concentrated on four
basic objectives: education geared to rural social and
economic development; the training of scientists and
technicians to carry out agricultural programmes; the
training of teachers in the agricultural sciences; and the
provision at all levels of education of science teaching
linked to the needs of rural development.
Much of this work has been carried out in co-operation
with the U.N. Development Programme, Unicef and the
World Bank. Programmes in agricultural education
carried out in co-operation with the U.N. Special Fund
have helped to expand agricultural training at the
Mindanao Institute of Technology in the Philippines, at
the Rural Polytechnic Institute of Mali and at the Institute
for Higher Technical Education in Agriculture and Industry
in the United Arab Republic. Other U.N. Special Fund-
Unesco programmes are to be launched in Nigeria (to
train instructors for farm institutes) and in Brazil, Colombia,
Tunisia and other countries. These programmes provide
aid totalling several million dollars.
S OME 40 Unesco technical assistance missions
have been sent to member states in the past
few years to strengthen and develop the national institutions
where teachers and technicians are trained. The work of
Unesco specialists, the equipment provided for labora¬
tories and workshops and the fellowships granted for study
in technologically developed countries have all contributed
to the success of these missions.
In Nigeria, for instance, agricultural science is being
progressively introduced into the school curriculum, and
this movement towards multi-purpose schools is also being
developed in Ethiopia, Sudan, Ceylon and other countries,
where teachers now receive special training and school
children are given practical lessons on local farms.
Together, Unesco and Unicef are working on projects
which range from the training of teachers and the provision
of equipment for rural primary schools to the development
of rural science studies. Full use is made use of audio¬
visual aids in the classroom and special emphasis is given
to practical work, thereby creating closer links between the
school and the rural world.
The planning of agricultural education, the introduction
of agricultural subjects into general education, the
orientation of the rural primary school towards rural
development and the training of teachers create complex
educational problems that call for study and experiment.
Collaborating with specialists in many countries, Unesco
experts have been testing new teaching methods and
materials in selected schools so that the most effective
techniques can be adopted for general use.
Unesco has also organized post-graduate courses for
teachers from the developing countries in specialized
fields of agriculture, in agricultural engineering, for
example. Scientists and university teachers have benefited
from training in food technology and food processing in
Israel, Italy, U.S.A., Netherlands and other countries.
India, one of the focal points in the fight against hunger,
wishes to take urgent measures in science and education
to ensure that improved farming techniques and technical
knowledge will be available to meet any future emergencies.
In response to a request for technical help, several
Unesco missions were sent to consult with and advise the
Indian Government. Recently Unesco sent a leading
British agricultural scientist, Sir William Slater, to study
the problems of agricultural education in India and to
suggest how it could make a more direct and forceful
impact on Indian farming than in the past.
Following this mission, Sir William pointed out that in
the time available to carry out these measures a new
generation of farmers would not have grown up, so it was
essential to educate those already working the land as
well as the rising generation of farmers. As the level of
literacy among farmers was low, teaching would have to
be primarily by direct contact, involving the spoken word
and demonstrations.
Sir William expressed the view that to give real effect
to this educational effort there should be at least one
agricultural extension officer for every thousand farmers.
As there are an estimated 60,000,000 farmers in India this
meant that at least 60,000 full time extension officers would
be needed.
Parallel to its programme of food production, he said,
India faced another vital problem: food preservation. The
amount of food destroyed before and after harvesting by
rodents and other pests had been variously estimated at
between 20 and 25 per cent and even higher figures which
were far greater than that of India's present food gap.
Thus another important job for India's agricultural extension
officiers would be to demonstrate to villagers the best
ways of preserving and storing food to protect it from
animal and insect pests.

### 27246: Calling all villagers

CALLING ALL VILLAGERS
Where illiteracy may cover up to 90 per cent of the population,
radio is an all-important medium for reaching the rural community.
NE African farmer out of three works for the
birds, rodents, insects and fungi, declared
Ghana's Minister of Food and Nutrition, last year. Accord¬
ing to some estimates, nearly one-third of India's crops
are lost to rats, birds and other pests.
Thus drought is not the only cause of hunger. To
attack this problem in its ensemble, farmers must be made
aware of all the facts, and they must be encouraged to
adopt new attitudes, methods and techniques. To convince
them is often a matter of reaching the entire community
rather than addressing the individual; it is here that radio
comes into its own (1).
The use of radio for adult education in rural areas has
contributed, for some years past, to improvements in living
standards and an increase in farm output.
The organization of Radio Rural Forums which began in
Canada in 1940 under the title of Farm Radio Forums has
since spread to many other countries. In India, for instance,
the first Radio Rural Forum began in 1956 as a Unesco
pilot-project run with government collaboration. The
experiment, originally carried out in 150 villages in the
Poona region, proved to be a success from every point
of view. Its growth has been phenomenal. This year the
Radio Rural Forums cover some 10,000 Indian villages, and
each year thousands of other villages are adopting this
adult education technique.
The Government of India through All India Radio
broadcasts rural programmes from 30 stations in all the
major languages and about 50 dialects. This represents
some 30 hours of broadcasting a day. More than 145,000
receiving sets have been supplied to rural communities for
collective listening, and steps have recently been taken
to supply another 46,000 sets.
Today Radio Rural Forums are spreading through¬
out India. They are stimulating thousands of villagers
by giving them an opportunity to take part in discussions
and air their views. The success of the broadcasts over
the past few years is such that the Indian Government has
decided to make still greater use of them in order to help
the rural population meet the food crisis which now
threatens the country.
(1) See "Radio Broadcasting Serves Rural Communities" , N° 48 of
Unesco's Reports and Papers on Mass Communication; 4¡-; $0.75; 3 F.
In Africa, Togo was the first country to adapt the forum
technique to the needs of its people. By August 1965,
with the aid of a Unesco expert, some 152 villages were
equipped with collective listening centres. These centres
work on the same lines as those in India, each broadcast
being followed by a general discussion among listeners,
after which questions, comments and suggestions for future
programmes are sent to the radio station.
These questions and suggestions show how actively
the audience participates: someone will want to know how
to increase output of a particular crop; a village asks for
a visit from an agricultural team because it needs advice
before sowing time; a husband wonders if it is all right for
his wife, who is pregnant, to carry bundles weighing as much
as 100 lbs. on her head; some listeners want to know about
radio itself: how can it transmit in one place and be heard
in another?; others write in to say they have decided to
help the government by opening a village dispensary.
This sort of questioning indicates to what extent the
radio forums have entered the lives of the Togolese
villagers, and how far the forums may go toward trans¬
forming their way of living. It also explains the rapid
progress of the forum technique in this young nation: by
the end of 1965, some 800 villages were equipped with a
receiver for collective listening and this figure is expected
to exceed 1,000 this year.
Ghana also tried its first project in the technique in
1964-65 with the aid of Unesco and with the collaboration
of the Canadian External Aid Office. The results of this
project have further proved that radio forums have long
since passed the experimental stage.
The success of the forums in such widely different
countries as Canada, India, Togo and Ghana is due to the
fact that those in charge of the broadcasts have applied
education methods which correspond to basic realities.
They are addressed not to the farmer as such, nor do
they deal exclusively with farming problems; rather they
are directed to people at large and concern the thousand
and one problems of everyday life.
The use of new methods of cultivation, new tools and
new machines wiiï be possible only in so far as the oc
villager can be induced to give up some of his traditional ^"
habits and routine practices. It is towards these indis¬
pensable changes that the Radio Rural Forums are working.

### 27618: For freedom from hunger

FOR FREEDOM
FROM HUNGER
First victories
Well over $405 million had been
raised for the world-wide Freedom
from Hunger Campaign by last autumn.
Contributions came from many
countries from international organiz¬
ations, groups and individuals. Special
stamps issued in 150 countries raised
$335,000. Twenty-three million dollars
have been used to launch FAO
projects and the rest have been
allocated to programmes supervised
locally in 95 countries in Asia, Africa,
the Near East, the West Indies, Latin
America and the South Pacific.
Under the FAO programme, fertil¬
izer projects in Latin America helped
many small farmers to increase their
crop earnings twentyfold. In West
Pakistan, demonstrations of the use
of hybrid corn led nearly 20,000
farmers to cultivate this cereal. In
India the output of a new cattle food
factory has helped to boost milk
production. After their boats were
equipped with outboard motors,
fishermen in Ceylon increased their
catches fourfold in 1962. Similar
projects were carried out in Togo,
Dahomey, UAR and East Pakistan.
Short cut to better crops
More than a million farmers have
seen the World Fertilizer Programme
of FAO in action since it was launched
four years ago. Millions of others
have heard rural radio broadcasts or
read newspapers, bulletins and village
posters describing the programme.
Nearly 40,000 fertilizer trials and
demonstrations have been carried out
in 17 countries of West Africa, the
Near East and North Africa and the
northern part of Latin America.
Results of the first two years of the
programme showed average yield

YOUNG WORLD MANIFESTO
An appeal to young people everywhere to mobilize for the
fight against hunger was launched by the Young World Assembly
which met last October in Rome to commemorate the 20th anni¬
versary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Young
people from 33 countries, including leaders and representatives of
national and international youth organizations, issued the follow¬
ing manifesto whose text is being widely publicized by FAO in
the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.
H ALF the world does not have enough to eat. Each
year, as a result, many millions die young, as
surely as ¡f shot by the guns of a tyrant. Many more
are maimed for life by hunger, in body or in spirit.
We say to you, this suffering can and must be stopped. When
all of us, whether we live with it or far away in the rich, well-fed
countries, make up our minds to end this hunger, we can
do it.
The earth is ruled mainly by people out of touch with the
young world. They know that men starve and die in millions.
But they think it more Important to make guns, bombs, warships,
rockets, to send us to fight one another, than to provide seed
and water, schools and hospitals, so that we might feed and serve
one another.
Twenty years ago today, men of foresight set up the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, to lead the
attack on hunger. Many eat better than they would have done
without it. Yet, after 20 years, there are more hungry people
than ever before. In another 20 years' time, if we do not act,
there will be yet more, famine will haunt many lands and we
shall be fighting one another again. We must prevent such an
outcome through the mobilization of the young world.
Know your power and know what you must do.
If you live in a rich country, you have wealth to share. Tell
your fellow countrymen about the hunger ¡n other lands. Demand
of your governments that much more of the nations' wealth
very many billions of dollars worth should go to world develop¬
ment.
If you live in a poor country, demand adequate food for your
fellows. Do not turn your backs on the land and people who
provide the food; instead work with them for rural develop¬
ment. Plan with them, so that starting with what little they have,
they themselves can develop in body and in spirit.
If you are educated In special knowledge and skills, do not
accept the old priorities. Know that science and technology,
that can send men into space, need only to be released into
the poor lands to work even greater miracles. See that your
skills are used to help the needy.
If you are a young parent, resolve to end the suffering of
children. Know, too, how to plan the size of your family, so
that the progress of all is not compromised.
Let us all make plain to the rulers that the division of the
world into rich and poor must end and that we know that efforts
equivalent to the many billions of dollars wasted on armaments
are needed to develop the world. Let them know, too, that if
political or financial systems prevent a just distribution of food
and wealth, those systems must be replaced.
Above all we must show our willingness to work for world
development, and demand that we be given the opportunity to
do so. Mankind is one family In which each of us has the
duty to help the other.
We who are meeting at the Young World Assembly have
pledged ourselves to this struggle as countless other young
people all over the world have done. Our generation has power
and knowledge that no previous generation has ever had. With
these we must create a world in which the human spirit is set
free from hunger and want, for ever.

Unicef - Jack Ling
An attack on malnutrition ¡n the villages of India began in 1960
when a Unicef drive to increase production and consumption
of "protective" foods was launched in Orlssa. This programme
now covers 10,000 villages. In places where food is a perennial problem
it is always the nutritionally vulnerable, children
and the pregnant and nursing mothers, who suffer most. Here,
a young girl receives milk and vitamin pills at a village health centre.
increases of about 75%. Average
financial returns on the crops have
been about 2.5 times the cost of the
fertilizer itself.
French youth in action
Since it was set up in 1964, the
French national committee for the
Freedom from Hunger Campaign has
been helped by over 330,000 young
people, including students, young
agricultural and industrial workers and
state employees. More than 42 million
francs ($21 million) have been raised,
and to enable young people to
contribute modest sums, the committee
has broken down larger projects into
smaller "pilot shares". A project for
Mayotte in the Comoros Islands
which costs 200,000 francs ($400,000)
has been split up into 351 "lots",
ranging from 90 francs ($18) for three
pedigree cockerels to 1,400 francs
($2,800) for an insecticide spraying
machine.
Odds against the farmer
Discussing the difficulties faced by
the farmer in many less developed
countries, FAO Director-General, B.R.
Sen, recently wrote: "Handicapped by
ignorance, poverty and debt, he must
face great fluctuations of price, and
because of his lack of resources must
usually sell immediately after the
harvest when prices are lowest. If
he improves his methods of farming,
much of the benefit of his increased
output may go to the merchant or the
landlord to whom he is indebted.
Often he has so little security of
tenure that he has no real inducement
to improve his holding."
Training centre for Far East
food technologists
An FAO International Food Techno-
ogy Centre has been opened at
Mysore, India. A joint venture of
FAO and the Indian Government, it
is supported by funds raised by the
Canadian people as a contribution to
the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.
Trainees from Far Eastern countries
can study food processing, packaging
and storage, thus helping to prevent
losses of food through spoilage and
waste and improving the nutritional
value of preserved and processed
food. Some training courses lead to

World food programme
helps tree-planters
The World Food Programme is
supplying food to Algerian workers
who are transplanting 22 millions
saplings under an emergency afforest¬
ation programme. The saplings, now
in nurseries, are ready for transplant¬
ing and a delay until next year's
planting season could result in the
death of many trees. A World Food
Programme official said recently that
without additional food supplies
workers and their families (totalling
400,000 persons) would be without
means of support. He announced that
20,000 tons of wheat were being
shipped to Algeria.
Literacy and development
in Argentina
A national campaign to eliminate
illiteracy in Argentina is concentrating
on agricultural areas. Argentina aims
to teach some 250,000 persons to read
and write within the next four years.
A programme of education for semi-
literate persons is expected to reach
2.5 million persons, most of them in
rural areas, within six years. By 1969
Argentina hopes to increase its gross
national product by 34 per cent. To 01
achieve this the agricultural sector of ^
the nation's economy will receive 17
per cent of total capital investment

which will cover such improvements
as planting permanent livestock
pastures, mechanizing large numbers
of farms, building storage facilities and
reclaiming much of the nation's soil.
Ultra-violet radiation
to preserve grain
A combine-harvester with a built in
ultra-violet radiation device has been
designed by an agricultural machinery
factory near Moscow. Immediately
after threshing the grain is given an
"ultra-violet shower", which destroys
any bacteria that might damage the
grain during storage.
Only 10 % of land
surface is farmed
Only 10% of the world's land
surface less than 15 million square
kilometres (5,800,000 square miles)
is farmed regularly and bears crops.
Just over half the world's population
1,700 million persons gain their liveli¬
hood from the soil, and of these, 65%
live in the Far East. Rural populations
represent 35% of the total of the
U.S.S.R., 25% m Europe, 50% in
Latin America, over 70% in Africa,
almost 60% in the Near East, 65% in
the Far East and 10% in North Ame¬
rica and Oceania.
Farm schools in Venezuela
Adults and young people in rural
Venezuela are given an elementary
education supplemented by courses
in agriculture and animal husbandry
in the Escuelas Granjas Comunales
(farm schools). These schools function
autonomously and finance their work
through the sale of farm produce.
Some specialize in poultry raising,
others in bee-keeping, others again in
livestock breeding or fruit and vege¬
table farming. On leaving school,
students receive in interest-free loan
of 1,200 dollars which enables them
to farm small family plots with help
and supervision from the school staff.
Paraguay's 'self help '
schools
Working as a team, four U.N.
agencies (FAO, Unesco, WHO and
Unicef) are helping Paraguay to carry
out a national nutrition programme
which aims to increase food pro¬
duction and teach healthier eating
habits. Among the obstacles to
economic development in Paraguay
are a high illiteracy rate, low popu¬
lation density and an archaic land
tenure system. Paraguay's annual per
caput income is just over 100 dollars.
Today young Paraguayans are helping
to change this state of affairs through
a self-help programme in 100 schools,
which have received farm equipment,
sewing machines, carpentry tools and
fencing wire. These schools are now
doing forestry work, and raising fruit,
vegetables and poultry. Nearly all
have five or more acres under culti¬
vation. School clubs and other extra
curricular clubs have been started.
Fountains of milk
A vast number of programmes
aimed at increasing milk and meat
production have been launched in
countries where these two vital
sources of protein have long been in
short supply. In India the milk pro¬
duction centre at Anand has
increased its annual deliveries to
Bombay from 2,500 to 25,000 tons in
the past eight years. In addition,
26,000 cows have been taken from
Bombay to the village of Aarey
where 30 farms with modern dairy
equipment now produce pasteurized
milk for Bombay.
Vital cereal
Rice produces an average of two
and a half times more grain per
hectare (24 acres) than wheat, two-
thirds more barley, and one-third more
than maize. The food value of rice
is greatest when it is unpolished.

HOW YOU CAN HELP A WORLD CAMPAIGN
One of the first responses to the joint appeal by the U.N. Secretary-General and
FAO's Director-General for aid in the grave food emergency facing India was a
donation of $10,000 in Unesco Gift Coupons from schoolchildren in the Netherlands.
The contribution was forwarded to the Indian National Commission for Unesco by the
Unesco Centrum Nederlands, a voluntary organization in Amsterdam.
Since the launching of the Freedom from Hunger Campaign in 1960, Unesco has
co-operated with FAO by collecting funds through the Unesco Gift Coupon Programme
to help fight hunger around the world.
The wide variety of projects aided in this way ranges from nutrition programmes,
poultry raising and forestry development to literacy teaching and rural development.
Unesco Gift Coupons have made available water supply, farming, seed processing
and fishing equipment and have helped the work of child care centres, mobile veterinary
laboratories and agricultural education centres.
You can help, too. Mail your contribution today to one of the organizations listed
below, or to: Unesco Gift Coupons, Place de Fontenoy, Paris 7 , France.

"Brown rice" as this is called, retains
the fat, minerals and vitamin B which
make it a much more substantial food
than the pearly-white grains of polished
rice eaten in the West.
Beneath deserts
water in plenty
The latest oil prospecting techniques
have helped geologists in their search
for hidden reservoirs of underground
water. In this way, FAO prospection
teams have located large quantities of
subsoil waters in the Chad, El Sal¬
vador, Greece, Haiti, Israel, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Turkey and the UAR.
In certain cases enough water to
irrigate between 30,000 and 100,000
hectares (75,000 and 250,000 acres) of
arid or semi-arid land has been found.
Many a slip twixt
crop and lip
One fifth of the food produced in
the world never reaches the dinner
table. Insects and rats devour grain
stored in silos and barns. Fish rots
where no refrigeration storage is
available. Meat is wasted for lack of
transport to take it to market. All over
the world FAO is trying to reduce
these losses by helping to set up food
industries and canning factories. In
Senegal, FAO experts helped to
establish the country's first canning
plant in 1963. Less than a year later
the factory was producing 3,000 cans
of meat and peanut sauce a day (sold
at less than half the price of a similar
imported product). Senegal now has
a drying and smoking plant which
deals with 20 tons of fish per day.
FAO specialists helped Burma to
reorganize its rice-storing facilities.
Today Burma's rice storage units have
a capacity of three million tons.
From Bristol to Malawi
A remarkable fund-raising effort by
the people of Bristol, England, has
given Likuni in central Malawi a farm
institute costing $135,000. Training
courses cover a wide area of agricul¬
tural activity in support of Malawi's
national programme for increased crop
production. Bristol's support for the
institute part of the Freedom from
Hunger Campaign included a contri¬
bution of $33,000 raised by the children
of the city.
Credit for cash-crop farmers
Tanzania has received a $5 million
credit for a four-year programme of
loans for agriculture from the Inter¬
national Development Association. The
programme aims at increasing the
incomes of thousands of small farmers,
and at making possible a widespread
adoption of better production techni¬
ques. Tanzania's net earnings of
foreign exchange are expected to
increase by some $5 million annually
through greater or improved export
crops.
Changing food habits
in the right direction
Upbringing, social habits, status,
family life, religion, work and the desire
for prestige, all conspire to fix our diet,
point out FAO Applied Nutrition
experts, who have learned how diffi¬
cult it can be to change food habits
in the right nutritional direction.
As well as appealing to scientific
evidence to help bring about changes
in eating habits, the nutritionist there¬
fore looks also to the anthropologist,
the sociologist and the social psycho¬
logist to help him. Supported by their
studies of what people do and why
they do it, it then becomes possible to
persuade people not so much to aban¬
don traditional diets as to modify them
slightly.
"Incaparina", a protein-enriched food
made by mixing maize, sorghum,
cotton-seed, flour, dried yeast and
synthetic vitamin-A, is being success¬
fully introduced into the diets of
schoolchildren in Central America, pri-

Tailoring the food to their tastes called

much trial and error. Mexican experi¬
ments in introducing a small amount
of fish flour into bread, cookies, bis¬

without changing their flavour, smell

worked well.
Sharp rise in production
and use of fertilizer
A rise of over ten per cent in world
fertilizer production was achieved for
1964/65 over the" previous year's
figure reports FAO. The estimated
combined world output (excluding
mainland China) was slightly over 42
million tons. Largest increase in output
was shown by Europe (1.5 million
ton). Asia also showed a sharp
increase of about 400,000 tons. The
heaviest rate of application was found
in Europe (110 kg. of all fertilizers per
hectare of arable land). This compared
with 45 kg. in North and Central Ame¬
rica. 39 kg. in Oceania, 22 kg. in the
U.S.S.R.. 11 kg. in South America and
Asia and only 4 kg. in Africa.
Betters diets from

Home gardens and private poultry
and fish raising will be encouraged in
Western Nigeria through a Freedom
from Hunger campaign project financ¬
ed by NEDERF a Netherland founda¬
tion, set up to administer funds for
this and similar programmes in West
Africa. NEDERF will provide $200,000
and will supply horticulturists and nutri¬
tion experts, as well as $17,400 worth
of equipment, supplies and services.
The Western Nigerian government will
provide over $100,000 in services and
cash for this two-year project.

The last of six training courses
aimed at building up national staffs
to take over desert-locust control oper¬
ations was held recently In Teheran,
Iran. Modern control methods have
been taught to participants from 14
countries which will conduct their own
operations after a six-year U.N. Spe¬
cial Fund project is wound up in June.
Training co-operative staff
A five-year programme to train staff
from managers through crop fore¬
man to service personnel needed on
self-governing co-operatives is being
launched In Algeria. The project, which
seeks to train some 15,600 persons,
has been allocated $1.3 million by the
U.N. Special Fund and the equivalent
of $5.7 million by Algeria. Training
will also extend to small farmers.

### 27678: Satellites and computers may measure world's water

SATELLITES AND COMPUTERS
MAY MEASURE WORLD'S WATER
by Daniel Behrman
OMMUNICATIONS satellites querying rain and
river gauges all over the earth and then flashing
the answers into computerized data centres may finally
provide the picture of the world's hydrological cycle needed
for rational management of large-scale water resources and
for research.
A proposal to consider the feasibility of such a global
water information system (known from its initial letters as
GWIS) was discussed recently by the Scientific Committee
on Water Research of the International Council of Scientific
Unions. The committee, which met at Unesco H.Q. in
Paris, decided to study the idea further as more information
is developed.
The proposal for the study had been prepared by the
United States National Committee for the International
Hydrological Decade. It was presented by Dr. Paul Bock,
a member of the U.S. National Committee and director of
the hydrology and water resources division of the Travelers
Research Center in Hartford, Connecticut.
The idea is based on recent progress in communications
satellites which could make classical methods of gathering,
transmitting and processing data in such fields as hydrol¬
ogy and meteorology as obsolete as a stage-coach com¬
peting against a jet airliner.
In a country like the United States, for example, gauges
measuring the flow and levels of rivers punch their data
onto paper tape for a thirty-day period. These tapes are
then collected, mailed to a data centre in Washington, trans¬
ferred to magnetic tape and processed by computers.
WHEN and if GWIS becomes reality, the satellite
could simply Interrogate the river gauge while
passing overhead and retransmit its data. The gauge
could be programmed to report every twenty-four hours and
then, once the river reached a certain level, every six hours.
With existing computer techniques, such data can be
printed out by the machine to produce maps of many types,
charting river flows and levels by latitude and longitude.
With more development the same technique could be
used, of course, for the other components of the world's
water cycle that the hydrologlst is interested in measuring:
groundwater levels, soil moisture, snow cover, water qual¬
ity, atmospheric water vapour, temperature, lake levels
or salinity in estuaries.
These phenomena, Dr. Bock believes, could be observed,
analysed and disseminated to national services all over the
world as required. They would not only provide day-to-day
data needed for such operations as the regulation of reser¬
voirs and flood warning systems, but would offer a planetary
portrait that is essential for scientific understanding of the
global water cycle.
The cost of such a system would naturally be extremely
high, but Dr. Bock is convinced that it would prove eco¬
nomical in the long run. He suggested, for example, that
it could be integrated with the World Weather Watch which
has a target date in the 1970s.
This date would coincide with the end of the International
Hydrological Decade which began under Unesco spon¬
sorship on January 1, 1965. The cost of this satellite and
computer network needed for the World Weather Watch
might be increased by only 10 to 20 per cent if it were
programmed to cover hydrological information as well,
Dr. Bock estimates.
HEN there is the breakthrough in communica¬
tions represented by the satellite. An automatic
station recording rainfall or stream flow would need a
powerful transmitter to radio its results to a data station.
But only a minimum of power would be needed for it to
transmit to a satellite.
If existing conventional systems of collecting water infor¬
mation were enlarged to meet only minimum standards,
"mountains of data" no less than 70,000,000 items a year
on the basis of daily recordings would be produced. It
would be impossible to assimilate this mass of information
unless modern data processing systems were used on a
large scale.
Dr. Bock feels that developing countries could stand
to benefit in particular by the technological revolution in
communications. Often, the heart of their water problems
is to be found in tropical jungles or great deserts where
making the rounds of the instruments to take their readings
can be time-consuming and costly, if not impossible.
In the United States, the establishment of such a water
information system of the most advanced type is already
under preliminary study and, if adopted, it could become a
component of a global system.
Dr. Bock stressed that none of this is likely to happen
tomorrow or the day after. But . he feels certain that,
sooner or later, this image of satellites in outer space trans¬
mitting and even recording at a distance the data needed
to understand what is happening to the world's water
supply will become a reality through international scientific
co-operation.

Electronic computers, programmed with

the cars of traffic violators and wanted
criminals are being used by the police in
the United States. The system functions
so rapidly that in New York, a policeman
posted on one side of a bridge randomly
radioing the licence numbers of passing
cars to a computer can receive informa¬

cers on the other side before the car can
cross the bridge in 27 seconds. Over
2,000 traffic violators were traced in this
way during experiments lasting six months.
Infra-red forest firewatcher
A new device to help combat forest fires
has been developed in Canada. It con¬
sists of an infra-red detector mounted
under an aircraft. It is sensitive to the
slightest heat radiation from the ground,
and as well as operating a warning device
in the aircraft, it produces a thermal record
of the area traversed, even indicating the
exact location of barbecue fires.
Ten-year plan
to rout smallpox
A ten-year plan to wipe out smallpox in
every country where it is still endemic has
been approved by the Executive Board of
the World Health Organization and will be
submitted to the World Health Assembly
in Geneva next month. It covers 27 Africa
countries, six in the Americas, four in the

Eastern Mediterranean and five in South-
East Asia, and will involve nearly 1,800 mil¬
lion vaccinations. As vaccination has exist¬
ed for over a century and a half, smallpox
should have disappeared long ago, but
efforts to eradicate it have been hindered
by lack of funds, staff and means of trans¬
port. Nevertheless much progress has
been made, and last year four more coun¬
tries Bulgaria, China (Taiwan), Jamaica,
and Trinidad and Tobago were freed from
smallpox.
In defence of whales
The future of the world's whale popu¬
lation is in danger. Thirty years ago there
were some 400,000 blue and fin whales in
the southern seas. Today there are barely
35,000. A British scientist has now pro¬
posed that an international treaty should
be drawn up under which the United Na¬
tions would take control of the remaining
whale population and regulate catches so
as to restore whale stocks to a safe level.
Noisy underwater world
The sea is far from being the silent place
we often imagine it to be. What with the
rasping noise made by lobsters, the clicks
of whales, the whistles of porpoises and the
"cheers" of octopuses, parts of the under¬
water world have an average noise level
comparable to that of a' large busy office,
according to scientists of the American
Museum of Natural History, who are study¬
ing sea noises. These sounds, which tra¬
vel further and five times faster than sounds
in the air, can interfere with operation of
underwater sounding and listening equip¬
ment.

Norair M. Sissakian
Professor Norair M. Sissakian, who
was unanimously elected president of
the 13th Session of Unesco's Gener¬
al Conference in 1964, died last month
at the age of 58. Principal scientific
secretary of the Praesidium of the
Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.
and a member of the International Aca¬
demy of Astronautics, Professor Sissa¬
kian was a world authority on space
biology. Readers will remember the
articles which this distinguished Soviet
scientist wrote for the Unesco Courier,
analyzing the new role of international
science in solving problems of eco¬
nomic and social development. The
death of Professor Sissakian is a great
loss to his own country and to world
science; it is particularly felt by those
who had the opportunity, at numerous
international meetings, to admire the
profound culture and unquenchable
optimism of this world-renowned
biologist.
Alexander A. Petrov
Professor Alexander A. Petrov, a
member of Unesco's Executive Board
and vice-chairman of the U.S.S.R. Na¬
tional Commission for Unesco, died
last February as the result of an acci¬
dent, at the age of 46. A graduate of
Leningrad University, Prof. Petrov was
associated for many years with the
training of staff for Soviet institutions
of higher education, before devoting
himself to questions of international
cultural relations.
Flashes...
A programme to help solve the world
food problem and to stimulate economic
growth in developing countries has been
set up by industrialists in Europe and North
America. It will be operated ¡omtly by FAO
and industry.
Britain's third planetarium has been open¬
ed at the National Maritime Museum
Greenwich.
Iran has become the 50th country to
join the Unesco agreement which seeks to
promote "the free flow of ideas by word
and image" by exempting books, news¬
papers, magazines and works of art from
import duties.
557,000 co-operative societies with a
total membership of 206 million persons
now belong to the International Co-opera¬
tive Alliance, according to recent figures
published by the organization.
More than one million visitors are expect¬
ed at the first International Asian Trade Fair
to be held in Bangkok in November. This
promises to be the largest event of its
kind ever held in Asia.
UNESCO'S WORLD LITERACY
PROGRAMME ENTERS
OPERATIONAL PHASE
r OR the first time interna¬
tional funds for economic
development and pre-investment are
being earmarked on a large scale for
literacy.
The Governing Council of the U.N.
Development Programme (1) meeting
in New York has approved requests
from the governments of Iran, Mali
and Algeria for nearly $3,800,000 to help
finance the first experimental projects
within Unesco's new world literacy pro¬
gramme.
Action at this first session of the
Development Programme launches the
operational phase of the Unesco's
experimental programme.
The three projects, for which Unesco
is the executing agency, will take literacy
training beyond the traditional teaching
of reading and writing. The three
countries will apply international funds
to "functional literacy", making use of
agricultural, industrial and vocational
training and civics to train adults to in¬
crease their productivity and earning
power as well as to become more
active in the life of their community.
The experimental projects will be
closely co-ordinated with current pro¬
jects of other U.N. agencies, notably
FAO and ILO, to promote better utiliza¬
tion of development funds.
In Iran, which will receive from the
U.N. Development Programme approxi¬
mately $1.5 million and provide a match¬
ing contribution of some $1,850,000, the
project covers two pilot experiments
for a period of 4 years.- One is an agri¬
cultural area of the Province of Khuzis-
tan benefiting from a newly completed
network of irrigation canals; the other
will involve 26,000 textile workers in
Isfahan, 90% of whom are illiterate.
In Mali, due to receive approximately
$1,120,000 and to contribute about
$2,300,000, two 5-year experiments are
planned. One covers 100,000 cotton
and rice growers in the region of
Segou; the other aims to increase pro¬
ductivity among 6,000 workers in state-
owned enterprises in_ and around
Bamako.
(7) The result of the recent merger of
the Expanded Technical Assistance
Programme and the U.N. Special Fund.
In Algeria, which will receive
$1,157,000 and contribute approximately
$4,880,000, there are three sub-projects.
The first includes workers on self-man¬
aged farm estates (5,000 persons), and
the second some 20,000 illiterate per¬
sons between the ages of 15 and 35 in
the chemical and oil industries of the
Arzew industrial area. The third Is
aimed at some 50,000 illiterate persons
between the ages of 15 and 35 in an
area where a big iron and steel complex
with several subsidiary industries is
being completed.
The approved projects reflect a deter¬
mination to marshal national resources
to eliminate illiteracy as a major bottle¬
neck in development. The three coun¬
tries approved for the first pilot pro¬
jects are among those with the highest
rates of adult illiteracy, ranging from an
average of 87% in Iran to more than
95% in Algeria and Mali.
These pilot projects will also help
answer such questions as: What is the
economic value of literacy programmes?
To what extent do. they contribute to
the solution of social problems? What
are the best ways to teach adults? An
evaluation covering economic, socio¬
logical and pedagogical factors will be
incorporated in all projects.
More than forty countries have already
expressed the desire to be selected as
sites for similar pilot projects. Some
have received Unesco missions to help
them design literacy projects linked to
development needs.
This new strategy for fighting illiter¬
acy was born out of studies made by
Unesco at the request of the United
Nations in connexion with plans for the
Development Decade.
A turning point of the world-wide liter¬
acy drive was the World Congress
of Ministers of Education on the Eradi¬
cation of Illiteracy, held in Teheran in
September 1965, which unanimously
agreed on the need to integrate literacy
closely into development and gave full
backing to Unesco's experimental liter¬
acy programme. This programme re¬
ceived unanimous endorsement of the
Twentieth Session of the U.N. General
Assembly.

Letters to the Editor
INTERPLANETARY MESSAGE
Sir,
I think I detected a note of dis¬
appointment in your February issue
when you said that only 12 correct
replies were received decoding the
interplanetary message. No doubt
there were many others like myself
who in fact did decode the message
and waited for the February issue to
check their results. I am happy to
say that I did decode the message
correctly, although I had no idea that
No. 14 was in fact the formula for the
volume of a sphere.
I have been taking the Courier for
about 10 years now and still find it
very interesting. Could you devote a
future issue to the ancient history of
music, both written and instrumental.
David Wootton
Newbury, England
Our reader is mistaken. On the
contrary we were delighted to receive
so many correct answers from three
countries only. (The original publica¬
tion of the message in the 'Japan
Times" produced only four correct
solutions.) Many other correct solu¬
tions were received, but too late for
inclusion in the February issue. Vin¬
cent Claude of Le Havre, France, who
signed his name and wished us a
Happy New Year in code, sent his
solution on a greeting card showing
a junior astronaut (below) Editor.

NO TABOO ON KNOWLEDGE
In the excellent article, "Science
and the Common Man" by Ritchie
Calder (March 1965), the author did
slip up on one point: "The association
of acquisitive knowledge with evil and
punishment is to be found in the
story of the garden of Eden." Beg
pardon, please, it was not acquisitive
knowledge that was forbidden, not
the search for knowledge per se that
was punished, but the "knowledge of
good and evil". This is a Biblical
concept in which knowledge means
the total knowing by experience, as
when a man "knows" his wife in the
scriptural narratives.
It is also knowing not in the scien¬
tific sense of knowing about facts or
principles, but knowing through expe¬
rience a composite of good and evil,
which means sinning, or breaking the
moral laws of God. (I am not talking
about sex.) It is a different order of
the problem. It is possible for a man
to seek knowledge and yet yield the
ordering of his ethical and religious
life to God.
But this is hardly the place to go
any further. The rest of the article
was very good and very provocative.

BIBLICAL TRANSLATIONS
Sir,
We have reviewed the September
1965 issue of the Unesco Courier and
find, on page 34, that Shakespeare's
works were translated 207 times.
According to the count of volumes
listed on page 804 of the Index Trans-
lationum, Volume 16, we find 159 items
as compared with 181 for the Bible in
1963.
Gilbert Darlington
American Bible Society
New York, U.S.A.
The figure of 207 translations for
Shakespeare published in the Courier
was incorrect. The correct figure, as
indicated in Index Translationum, is
759. With a count of 181, the Bible
and extracts from it thus topped the
list of the world's translations in 1963.
Volume 17 of Index Translationum has
just appeared. It lists 192 translations
for Shakespeare and 228 for the Bible
during 1964. Bible translations relate
not only to the complete Testaments,
but also to individual Gospels and
extracts from them Editor.
RUMANIA'S ARCHAEOLOGISTS
Sir.
The caption to the photograph of the
neolithic figurine from Cernavoda,
Rumania (Treasures of World Art, Jan.
1966), stated that in the past ten years
Rumanian archaeologists had carried
out excavations in the Balkans and
Anatolia. Professor D. Berciu, of
Bucharest, who discovered the Cer¬
navoda figurine, has written about it
in the specialized reviews of other
countries and has often compared its
style to that of similar prehistoric
works of art found in Thessaly and
Anatolia. But no excavation oper¬
ations have been carried out in the
Balkans and Anatolia by Rumanian
archaeologists.
Valentin Lipati
Rumanian Delegation to Unesco
Paris
WHALES IN DANGER
Sir,
It is reported that the world's whale
population is being exterminated by
excessive hunting. Why not publish
an article on this problem and also
launch a campaign to protect the whale
through petitions and letters addressed
to the responsible authorities?
Roger Bengel
Vaux-sur-Seine, France
The Unesco Courier has already
published several articles on whale
hunting and measures to protect the
world whale population (April-May,
1954, May 7955, Ian. 1958). A British
expert recently proposed a U.N.
control of whaling (see page 32).
THE ABU SIMBEL STORY
Sir.
As a history teacher I enjoyed the
articles which described the rescue
of the Nubian temples, particularly
those dealing with the operations at
Abu Simbel (Dec. 1964 and Nov. 1965).
When teaching Egyptian history I have
tried to interest my students in this
great conservation project. I should
like to keep them up to date on its
progress, and therefore hope the
Unesco Courier will continue to give
us the latest news from Abu Simbel.
I am sure many readers share my
interest in this enterprise.
Bernard Hagen
Strasbourg, France
We shall of course continue to
keep readers up to date on the conti¬
nuing international operation that is
saving the unique monuments at Abu
Simbel Editor
VIVA TOURISM
Sir,
Please accept my greetings and
sincere congratulations on your
splendid magazine. Your publication
helps us to see the world far and
wide. I should, however, like to see
more articles on international tourism,
which, in my opinion, is the best way
of getting to know the life of other
peoples. May international tourism
flourish.

REVOLUTION IN BOOKS
Sir,
I had the privilege of going through
your issue on The Revolution in Books
(Sept. 1965). All the articles are fine
and throw a flood of light on various
aspects of the book industry in East
and West. It is so informative and
instructive that I really must congratu¬
late you on a fine production.

MAINSTAY OF LIFE FOR
ONE PERSON IN THREE
In volume, rice is the world's largest single crop, yet its cultivation often
takes place in the shadow of poverty and famine. In 1966, dedicated
as International Rice Year, a concerted effort is being made to help the
rice farmer and the 1,100 million people one third of mankind who
depend on him (see page 16). Here farmers plant young rice shoots.
