Kneeling in the manner of an Indian woman grinding corn, this figure represents Chalchihuitlicue,
Aztec goddess of water, whose name signifies "Our Lady of the Green Skirt." In the Aztec pantheon,
Chalchihuitlicue ruled the rivers and lakes and was the counterpart of Tlaloc, the rain god, who
governed growth and vegetation (see the "Unesco Courier", page 2, August-September 1973).
This statuette of the goddess (40 cm. high) dates from the end of the 15th or early 16th century,
when Aztec civilization was at its zenith. Its skirt may once have been incrusted with precious
stones green in hue, a colour symbolizing for the Aztecs water and the rebirth of all things.

Years of disastrous drought in the Sahel, the
vast semi-arid region bordering the southern
Sahara, from Mauritania to the Sudan, have
left destitute many of its nomad peoples. The
fragile balance between man and his environ¬
ment which enabled these nomadic herdsmen
to subsist appears to have been destroyed,
while economic and social changes introduced
during the past few decades have created a
situation that may be irreversible. This issue
of the "Unesco Courier'' examines the tragic
plight and uncertain future of the peoples of
the Sahel in the aftermath of drought and
famine. Photo shows a Tuareg nomad family
in search of a well.

kilometres ofAfrica's Sahel
by Howard Brabyn
"In less than 50 years'
time... the advancing
desert threatens to wipe
three or four countries
of Africa completely
from the map. "
Kurt Waldheim
United Nations
Secretary-General
(addressing the Inter-State Committee
on Drought Control in the Sahel, in
Ouagadougou, Upper Volta, on Febru¬
ary 21. 1974)
HOWARD BRABYN, English writer and
journalist who has specialized in popularizing
scientific and educational questions, is editor
of Unesco's quarterly "Nature and Resources"
(annual subscription 20 F). He was previously
assistant editor of the English edition of the
"Unesco Courier".
LIKE the Tuareg who roam its
northern expanses, the Sahel is
a nomad, a shifting buffer zone bet¬
ween the wastes of the Sahara and the
agricultural regions of the Sudan
whose limits stretch and contract in
accordance with the amount of rain
that falls or fails to fall each year.
"Sahel" (from the Arabic word mean¬
ing "borderland") is therefore essen¬
tially a climatic term for an area vaster
than India, almost 4 million square kilo¬
metres of semi-arid land stretching
across Africa from Mauritania and
Senegal in the west, through Mali,
Upper Volta and Niger, to Chad and
the borders of the Sudan.
In the area extending southwards
from the southern fringes of the
Sahara, nomadic herdsmen exploit the
meagre resources of a belt of land
in which annual average rainfall varies
from 100 to 350 mm. Further south,
in a region where rainfall varies from
350 to 600 mm., herdsmen and agri¬
culturalists co-exist, the peasant farm¬
er exchanging his grain for the nomad's
animal products of meat and hides.
To understand what these rainfall
figures mean it must be borne in mind
that, In the Sahel, rain falls in short,
concentrated spells and that 80 to 90
per cent of this moisture is lost
through evaporation. In the world's
temperate zones rainfall is not all that
much higher (in Paris, for example, It
is only 650 mm.) but it is more evenly
spread out over the year and losses
through evaporation are comparatively
insignificant.
Relatively slight annual variations
in rainfall can transform huge areas
of land. Thus, In 1941-42, when rain¬
fall over a 340,000-square-kilometre
area of Mauritania dropped below
100 mm., the whole area (a third of the
total area of the country) became
inhospitable desert ; ten years later,
with rainfall once again above the
100 mm. mark, nomadic herdsmen
were grazing their livestook on its pas¬
tures. Another swing of the pendu¬
lum and the situation is reversed.
Over the past decade, for example,
the Sahara has crept Inexorably south,
encroaching as much as 150 kilometres
on what was formerly nomad grazing
territory.
Against this shifting background
the peoples of the region have built
up a range of differing but interdepen¬
dent life styles adapted specifically to
both seasonal and cyclical patterns of
moisture deficiency. In other words,
semi-arid conditions are the one cons¬
tant of the Sahel and It is upon this
constant that the entire life style of
the peoples of the Sahel is based.
But if this is so, why has the drought
of recent years entailed such serious
consequences? If the way of life
evolved over centuries in the Sahel
was specifically designed to cope with
semi-arid conditions, why did It fail so
catastrophically to stand up to what
was, admittedly, a period of exception¬
ally severe drought?
The answer Is that a number of tech¬
nical and socio-economic innovations,
introduced from the outside, upset the
precarious equilibrium of the. area.
These innovations were Introduced
with the best of Intentions. What
could be of greater practical help to
the herdsman in a drought-prone region
than the digging of deep wells and the
creation of a chain of watering points
for his cattle? What could be more
logical than to control or eliminate
the periodic and endemic diseases
that regularly decimated his herds?
These innovations did not only affect
the herdsman. To help the peasant
farmer, cash crops such as cotton,
ground-nuts and rice were introduced.
Population grew and more and more
former grazing land was put under
cultivation.
With disease largely eliminated, the
nomad's herds multiplied and more
and more cattle were concentrated on
diminishing areas of grazing land.
Gathering round the newly-created
watering points the enlarged herds
soon degraded the fragile pasture.
Thus, in solving the problems of ani¬
mal health and watering, a new prob¬
lem was created as drought became
more acute, that of hunger. During
the recent five-year drought period,
over a third of the total cattle stock
died of hunger rather than of thirst or
disease.
Would It, then, have been better
not to interfere, to allow disease and
thirst to regulate the size of the
nomad's herds? In countries that
need to make use of every available
resource such a wholly negative policy
would have been unforgivably wasteful.
Indeed, the policies that were adopted
cannot, in themselves, be faulted; what
went wrong was that those who Intro¬
duced them failed to take Into account
the social, economic and ecological
consequences of their successful
implementation.
Traditionally the nomad felt obliged
to maintain the largest possible num¬
ber of cattle in order to guard against
the ravages of disease, drought and
marauding rivals. Watering points
were fewer, but their use was control¬
led by a mixture of force, agreement
and custom. When disease was con¬
trolled and watering problems reduc¬
ed, the nomad continued to maintain .
large herds as an insurance against r

Thousands of Tuareg herdsmen fled the Sahel to escape
famine, some of them crossing the Sahara in an attempt
to reach southern Algeria. Relief programmes were
launched by the Algerian government and the Red Crescent
(the Red Cross of Muslim countries), but exhaustion and
sickness have taken a terrible toll. Below, survivors of

k disasters which had become much less
of a threat.
Subsequent events have taught us
that If the improvement of watering
arrangements had been coupled with
controlled use of the new watering
points and the reduction of animal
disease had been coupled with pasture
Improvement schemes and better mar¬
keting arrangements to handle the
Increased animal production, the scale
of the recent disaster would have
been greatly reduced.
The destruction of the basic pastoral
forage and fodder resources through
over-exploitation, serious enough be¬
fore the recent drought period, had
catastrophic consequences during
years In which rainfall was significant¬
ly below average. The central prob¬
lem of the Sahel is, therefore, one
of the management of grazing lands
under marginal and fluctuating climatic
conditions in a particular social, eco¬
nomic and cultural context. It is a
problem which cannot be solved by
taking separate action on one, two
or even half a dozen individual diffi¬
culties; what is needecl is an overall
approach to the system as a whole.
This is where Unesco's Man and
the Biosphere (MAB) Programme,
with its Integrated, Interdisciplinary
approach to research aimed at Improv¬
ing man's partnership with and man¬
agement of the environment, has a
vital part to play. One of its main
objectives Is precisely to examine the
impact of changes In human popula¬
tions, settlement patterns and techno¬
logy on the ecosystems In which they
occur.
Research undertaken by MAB is
not limited to the study of grazing
lands and arid and semi-arid zones
such as the Sahel; it covers all the
major ecological systems of the world
Including both tropical and temperate
forests, lakes, marshes, rivers, deltas,
estuaries and coastal zones, mountain
and tundra lands and island eco¬
systems.
However, the problems of the Sahel
have a particular urgency and Unesco
is fortunate enough to have a wealth
of experience and research material at
its disposal thanks to Its earlier Arid
Zone Research Programme. This Pro¬
gramme, which ended in 1962, provid¬
ed the basic knowledge about the
natural resources of Africa, its water
resources, the problem of nomadism
and various aspects of the develop¬
ment of arid zones and the utilization
of land and water on which all current
research Is based. It gave rise to the
publication of the World Soil Map, a
vegetation map covering the whole
of Africa and the preparation of a map
of groundwater resources in Africa
north of the Equator.
Where the MAB research pro¬
gramme differs from what has gone
before is that it brings Man back into
the forefront of scientific research.
At a MAB regional meeting held In
Niamey, Niger, in March 1974, after
listing a number of reasons for the
comparative failure of previous deve¬
lopment schemes for the Sahel, MAB
experts concluded:
"Perhaps most Important, however,
is the fact that insufficient attention and
importance has been given to the
socio-economic and ethno-cultural
context of local populations. These
populations have an Intimate know¬
ledge of the environment and a
wealth of experience which we have
not always fully appreciated or used.
Given the need in any successful dev¬
elopment action for active participa¬
tion of local populations (thus exclu¬
ding the imposition of ill-adapted
exterior models) and given the disor¬
ganization of the pastoral system after
a period of drought, It is recommended
that:
all research and development op¬
erations take into account the social
and economic context of local popu¬
lations;
the experience and knowledge of
local populations on cattle-breeding
and on the local environment be
considered the point of departure for
studies which precede development
projects;
all research and development ac¬
tions be accompanied by educational
action so that local populations recog¬
nize their responsibilities in the use
and exploitation of their environment;
in the context of the recent drought,
a detailed evaluation of the carrying
capacity of the Sahelian zone be un¬
dertaken, as well as an examination of
the behaviour of local populations
during the period prior to the present
situation."
Pilot research projects now being
planned will be concerned primarily
with two typically Sahelian human and
ecological situations.
The first of these concerns the
zones of contact between grazing lands
and cultivated lands. In these contact
zones the main purpose of the pilot
studies will be to help develop land
management guidelines based on
mutually beneficial social and econo¬
mic relationships between nomads and
peasant farmers.
The second area for research con¬
cerns regions where rainfall Is insuf¬
ficient to support agriculture and the
main land use Is, and is likely to
remain, livestock breeding on a
nomadic pattern. The aim of pilot
projects in these areas will be to
assess the carrying capacity of the
land and to provide guidelines for its
management. They will also examine
the possibility and consequences of
a fundamental reorganization of life In
rural areas such as a change from
nomadic to sedentary cattle-raising.
As an example of what could be
done, Gabriel Boudet, a French expert
in grazing land management and a
MAB consultant, has proposed an out¬
line land management scheme which ^
would involve a change from migra-*

tory to sedentary cattle-farming (1).
The scheme would be applicable in
areas where conditions were favour¬
able for fodder production and water
supplies were adequate. It assumes,
of course, a careful preliminary study
of the carrying capacity of the area
concerned and would Involve some
7,000 head of cattle representing the
combined herds of 70 families or a total
of about 350 Individuals. The scheme
is presented diagrammatlcally on
opposite page.
The area to be managed would
centre on a deep well which would
provide a source of water during the
dry season. A village to house the
herdsmen's families would be situated
some 500 metres from the well. The
dry season pasture would consist of an
area of some 31,500 hectares forming
a circle of land with a 10 kilometre
radius around the well.
Outside the circumference of this
circle would be a ring of land, some
three kilometres wide, which would
serve as grazing land for the rainy
season. Spaced out at regular inter¬
vals In this area would be a series of
10 "guzzlers", or artificial ponds, cap¬
able of holding sufficient water between
major spells of rain to provide for the
needs of 700 head of cattle (one tenth »
of the total herd) for about 15 days.
Round each "guzzler" would be an
840-hectare grazing area.
In the dry season each herding unit
of 700 cattle would be brought inside
the "dry season circle" but would
remain towards the outer edge of the
circle. Each day the cattle would go
to be watered at the central well, being
driven along narrow well-defined paths
in order to avoid trampling the pasture
land. Later, the herds would move
again to within five kilometres of the
well, thus reducing the distance to be
covered to obtain water during the
period of greatest heat.
Simple as the scheme may sound It
would require enlisting the whole¬
hearted co-operation of the herdsmen
and an educational programme to
explain the need to adopt new habits
and disciplined control of herds.
One of the major preoccupations of
MAB In its research on the problems
of a specific area is to acquire a body
of knowledge and experience that ran
be applied to similar problems arising
elsewhere. In recent years drought
attaining disaster proportions has also
struck Ethiopia and parts of Somalia
and the Sudan. While not strictly a
part of the Sahel, these areas have
very many similarities with it and are
often referred to as forming part of a
wider entity of semi-arid land called
the Sahelian Zone. The knowledge
being acquired by MAB in the Sahel
proper jwill soon, therefore, be aiding
the drought-affected nomads and
peasant-farmers of these regions.

Biosphere Programme runs the theme
of man as a social being and his
relationship with his environment.
Nowhere can the importance of this
kind of approach be greater than it
is in an ecosystem as fragile as that
of the Sahel. Every action to be
taken must be weighed and examined
from every angle, scientific, sociologi¬
cal, economic, cultural, etc. The re¬
cent disaster in the Sahel provided a
costly reminder of the dangers of
taking short cuts.
The ecologist, that general practi¬
tioner of science, knows that whatever
he does to the smallest fraction of that

system will have its effect on the
whole organism. He must be able,

the dry season for some 7,000 head of cattle. Herdsmen's families

### 49663: Nomadsland or nomansland?

sahel By Jacques Bugnicourt
and an international research team
The texts published on the
following pages are taken from an
important study on the African
Sahel carried out in Niger as part
of a programme called " Formation
pour l'Environnement " (Training
for the environment) which
concerns Africa as a whole. The
programme was launched jointly
by the African Institute for
Economic Development and
Planning (set up in Dakar, Senegal,
by the United Nations and African
countries), the United Nations
Environment Programme and the
Swedish International Development
Agency. The study on the Sahel,
entitled Un Peuple privé de son
Environnement (A people deprived
of its environment) was carried
out by Professor Jacques
Bugnicourt of the African Institute
for Economic Development and
Planning (Dakar). It is based on
contributions from an international
team drawn from 12 countries of
Africa, Europe and America (*).
The study deals primarily with the
peoples of the Sahel from the
area of the Niger Bend who, driven
by drought and famine from their
traditional nomad trails, found
refuge in a relief camp near
Niamey, capital of Niger. What is
to become of these nomads, up¬
rooted from their homeland and
deprived of the natural environment
in which they have lived for
centuries? Can an exceptional
drought suddenly threaten the
very existence of their traditional
way of life? By interviewing the
refugees from the Sahel, Prof.
Bugnicourt and his team have
sought some tentative answers
to these questions.

### 49663: Nomadsland or nomansland?

1. nomadsland or nomansland?
THE Sahel is green again, but
along the trails where the cattle
of the Tuareg and Peul died, the grass
still grows thinly. Drought and famine,
aggravating the consequences of a
number of economic innovations and
policies, have left the inhabitants of this
arid zone without the essential means
of coming to terms with their environ¬
ment their camels and their cattle
and forced them into exile from their
homelands.
They are now a people deprived of
its environment. (*)
How did this happen? What can be
done for these people? What future is
there for them? The best place to look
for an answer to these questions is
among the refugees who fled from
disaster. The facts related in the fol¬
lowing texts are based on an inquiry
carried out at the Lazaret camp, 6 km.
from Niamey, capital of Niger, in which
13,000 nomads, nine-tenths of them
Tuareg or Arabs, were crowded to¬
gether in March 1974.
Our primary concern was the fate
of the nomads, mostly from the Niger
Bend area, who had been swept in the
course of the exodus towards town¬
ships in Niger and in particular to the
Lazaret camp. Our particular interest
was concentrated on a people's natu¬
ral environment and what happens to
them when they have been driven out
of that environment.
Recent history has made the Sahel a
threatened area. Previously, hard
though his life was, man lived here in
a kind of symbiosis with his harsh
environment; that symbiosis is now in
peril, to such an extent that it is no
longer sure whether there is any place
for man in it.
North of the 15th parallel, ecological
conditions deteriorated during 1972-
1973 to such an extent that hardly any
livestock survived and agricultural pro¬
duction was non-existent. Famine
drove out the population.
Between the 15th and 13th parallels,
surface water disappeared with the
result that cash crops could no longer
be cultivated and grazing was no long¬
er available, thus depriving the farmer
of his sources of both food and
money.
Between the 13th and 12th parallels,
on the other hand, although rainfall
was low it was still sufficient to ensure
a minimum level of production of cer¬
tain basic crops, mainly food crops,
and to maintain the pastureland.
South of the 12th parallel, where
the crops are more diversified and the
rainfall less scanty, there is reason to
believe that the effects of the drought
on farming were less tragic and that
the results will not be so lasting.
Thus, in the space of about 250 km.,
going from south to north, the situation
changed from a relatively comfortable
one to one of total destitution.
By the end of 1972, it was clear that
throughout the northern Sahel, the
herdsmen living beyond the 13th
parallel had little choice but to move
out or to die.
In Niger, "During the last months of
1972, the situation reached danger
level for the nomad and sedentary
populations of the northernmost re¬
gions, the first to be affected, whose
natural adaptability was already stret¬
ched to the limit. There was nothing
more to be done. They began to drift
slowly down towards the south, to¬
wards the towns." (1)
The situation continued to deterio¬
rate during the following months.
In the autumn of 1973, famine struck
many of the groups living in the Sahel
in all its force. Near Zinder, a herds¬
man is reported to have thrown his
wife and their two children down a
well so as not to have to watch them
die before his eyes. In the abandoned
hamlet of Hakkam, 60 km. or so to the
north of Dakoro, "medical orderlies
found the desiccated body of an old
man in rags, who appeared to have
died of hunger and thirst because the
whole population of the village had
left without his knowing." (2)
"The way things are now, a father
even has to forget his own child", said
the head of one family group from
Agadès.
These nomads who have been forced
into exile have been used to an ex¬
tremely hard life, even at the best of
times. But until famine struck they
had managed to survive, scraping a
bare living from their environment.
What has happened is that the envi¬
ronment has been destroyed, the vege¬
tation and water have disappeared,
flocks and herds have perished and
many human beings along with them.
The nomads fled from this inferno into
the unknown.
So began a pitiful exodus. Food
distribution centres were set up for
those who were strong enough to drag
themselves that far, and the refugees
settled into an environment totally dif-

ferent from the one to which they were
accustomed.
Successive waves of Tuareg, Arabs,
Peul, Wodaabe, Songhai, Zerma and
Hausa trekked down towards the sou¬
thern Sahel, some of them into Upper
Volta, Dahomey or even the Ivory
Coast, many others in the direction
of Nigeria.
These migrations were by no means
a uniform, constant movement. On
the contrary. The exodus of the Wo¬
daabe and Peul seems, for instance,
to have been quite different in char¬
acter from that of the Tuareg.
In the area stretching from the banks
of the Niger opposite Dahomey as far
as Mali, it is reported that the Peul,
"alert to and observing the warning
signs of famine, began to move to¬
wards the south with their herds much
sooner than the Tuareg. They reduced
their herds of their own accord by
selling off animals cheaply, which
enabled them to stave off disaster.
"The Bororo Peul, of the Tahoua and
Dakoro regions, had already found an
original solution to the problem of
ready cash four years previously, by
sending numerous groups of women
to Ghana and the Ivory Coast to sell
magic recipes.
"Some of the young men went with
them in 1972 and considerably more in
1973. In 1974, husbands and wives,
leaving the children in the care of the
elderly, left together. Many Peul fami¬
lies... managed to keep a few head of
cattle. This enabled them to survive
(a Peul family of four can subsist for
a year with a single cow) and to pre¬
serve, with their animals, the familiar
pattern of their existence, their familiar
surroundings and to some extent their
eating habits. " (1)
Many of the groups split up, hoping
to improve their chances of survival
by going in different directions: the
Tuareg towards Niger and Algeria while
others went elsewhere.
Once the nomads had decided to go
beyond their normal grazing territory,
a decisive step had been taken, but
that step did not necessarily lead in
the direction of Niamey.
None of them had fixed on an ulti¬
mate destination. One route was
chosen in preference to another simply
"because there was grazing". Families
set off without knowing whether they
would be coming back again: "We all
wanted to feed our families... we did
not set out with the intention of going
to Niamey but simply to find grazing
and water". "We left because we
wanted to find grazing. When the
drought hit us and our animals died,
we kept moving, looking for food for^
ourselves." V

### 49663: Nomadsland or nomansland?

K Some families did head straight for
Niamey: "Because it is a town where
we had heard that we might be able
to find food." But this was true of
only one family in four, the other three
families setting out aimlessly, not
knowing whether they would end up in
Niamey or elsewhere.
Uncertainty as to where they were
going explains the often complicated
route they followed. There were many
changes of mind and changes of plan:
some members of one group coming
from Kidal, for example, decided to
turn around and go back, taking with
them four camels, five cows, seven
goats, three donkeys and three sheep.
As long as a few of their livestock'
were still alive, the herdsmen kept on
searching for stubble that had not
completely dried up or for areas where
bushes had not been utterly devas¬
tated.
Some continued on foot after their
animals had died. Others took any
means of transport available, including
boats. "From Mangené we were taken
in vehicles towards Niamey, and we
sold everything tents, mats, silver
earrings, bracelets to pay for this
transport."
Not surprisingly, the time taken on
the journey varied considerably from
one group to another, since none of
them knew too well where they were
going or by what route. It is certain,
however, that most of the groups cov¬
ered more than 500 km.
The southward-moving nomads no
longer had anything much to offer the
villagers, with whom they quarrelled
over the often scarce water and the
scant pasturage. To begin with they
had animals to sell, but the villa¬
gers' herds had also been hard hit and
they were short of money. Later the
Tuareg and Maures bartered or sold
off their tents, jewels and other objects
which they had taken with them.
Finally, the migrants, weak as they
were, had nothing to offer but their
labour. They attempted to win the
acceptance of the local population by
doing odd jobs for them, fetching
water, grinding millet or gathering and
selling brushwood.
Relations between the nomad herds¬
men and the villagers varied, however,
during the various stages of this exo¬
dus and in some places the nomads
met with hostility. "Sometimes we
had to wait until nightfall so that we
could fetch water without being seen."
"Wherever we went the villagers would
give us food and drink, but when we
had animals the villagers would refuse
to let them have any water unless we
paid for it."
Such attitudes, however, by no
means reflect the experience of the
majority of the nomads in the course
of their migration. "They used to give
us water to drink. As to food, the time
came when there were so many people
that the villagers could no longer give
us anything to eat." ... "When some
of our people died and we had no
money left, they gave us cloth to
make shrouds for the dead."
Generally speaking, the villagers
were considered to have been hospi¬
table enough something which cannot
be over-emphasized. Two out of
three families considered that they had
been well received.
Such animals as the nomads still
possessed when they resigned them¬
selves to the idea of leaving were
almost all sold for next to nothing or
killed off by hunger or thirst some¬
where along the trail towards the
south of the Sahel.
It was a sore trial for Tuareg, Maures
or Peul who managed to take a few
animals with them to discover that their
herds, of which they had been so proud
and which they had spent their lives
building up, were no longer worth any¬
thing much. In the regions to which
they had now come, crops had been
poor, so more and more cattle were for
sale and less millet was available.
They would sell off their oldest ani¬
mals first, then their sterile cows, then
the bulls, and lastly cows in calf "for
a few kilos of the farmer's grain".
But selling off animals for grain
or even in exchange for the right to
water the rest of the herd was not
the main reason why the number of
livestock dwindled.
"We lost a camel and a donkey on
the way", said a chief from Agadès,
"and we sold two camels and three
donkeys", but for the most part the
livestock perished during the journey.
Some idea of the losses suffered by
the flocks and herds can be gleaned
by reconstructing the story of the fam¬
ilies who took refuge at the Lazaret
camp: a group of families, who at the
time of leaving numbered slightly less
than 700, lost in the course of their
exodus to the south some 3,500 ani¬
mals, including 330 camels, 690 cows,
1,300 sheep and 900 goats.
One can well imagine how painful it
must have been for people for whom
cattle-raising had been their whole way
of life to watch the slow death of
their beasts before and during the
exodus. It is almost impossible to
imagine or to describe, however, the
miseries of the long march towards
the towns further south.
Famine soon .struck. Families were
reduced to eating berries and seeds.
A few of the animals were killed.
Young children were sent to try and
beg food in the villages.
"If we were near a village and we
heard the sound of grain being ground,
we sent the children to beg for the
bran left behind after the grinding.
The children would eat it on the spot
but had difficulty in digesting it. If
any was left, they would bring it back
to us."
Here is the story of a family from
Bourem: "After we had lost our cattle,
we kept on walking for two months.
A seven-year-old boy called Issa, a
girl of the same age called Raissetou
and a twelve-year-old boy died at Wa-
tagouna, near Ansongo." All three died
of hunger. How many other families
have similar stories to tell?
It was thus not only the animals
which died off one after the other.
The way to the south is marked by the
graves of the Tuareg or Maures who
did not have the strength to continue
as far as the relief centres. They died
either from hunger and fatigue or from
some illness which, in their weakened
state, made short work of them.
Some members of the Kelahara
group from Menaka buried a third of
their number in the course of their
wanderings. A Gao family tells the fol¬
lowing story: "There were eighteen of
us to start with: six died on the way...
they were children who were used to
drinking milk, but while we were tra¬
velling they had nothing to eat but
millet bran and they suffered from sto¬
mach aches which finished them off."
Hama, aged 41, from Timbuktu, is the
head of a family of 13 of which he and
five others have survived a woman of
25 and four children aged from six to
ten. "We set off on foot to escape
from the disaster-stricken area in
March 1973. Two months later, our
little group was completely exhausted.
Two boys Momar and Mohamed
died, followed by five girls Mariama,
Asmao, Aminatou, Aisha and another
Mariama."
The head of one family told the fol¬
lowing story: "The camels became too
weak to carry us. We went on on foot.
Our old father was lagging behind
and slowing us up. Finally he sat down
in the sand and told us he would catch
us up later. That same night, my
younger brother could stand it no
longer and turned back to look for
him. We have not seen my brother
since. He must have got lost as well."
Some families, it is true, survived,
but wherever they came from, all the
groups suffered considerable losses.
Our inquiry suggests that the nomads
who ended up at the Lazaret camp
lost at least a sixth of their number
on the way.
How many died in all? We shall
never know, since some groups and
families disappeared without trace...
The nomads in the camp often do
not know how many of their group
were left behind.
In many cases more people remained
behind than left. Often, too, those
who stayed had no means of subsis¬
tence, and their chances of finding
enough food and water to survive
were very slender.
The situation of many of these peo¬
ple was summed up by Tuareg refu¬
gees from Gao: "We have no way of
getting back to those who were left
behind, and they have no means of
coming here, nor of surviving back
there where there is now no live¬
stock".
The refugees will continue to be
haunted by the thought of those they
left behind.

### 49666: The Battle for survival of the Tuareg and their herds

sahel
2. the battle for
*'Lkj»UÙ.i «¡mmm
UNCERTAINTY and danger are
the very essence of life in the
Sahel. Its immense open spaces
are sometimes a hostile desert shunn¬
ed by man and, at others, green pas¬
tures towards which the herdsmen
drive their animals.
Although the amount of rainfall in
the Sahel is the most immediately
striking factor, the timing of the rains
over the year is also important.
Other influential factors are: the
different types of soil, some of which
retain water better than others, so that
fertility varies as also do the dangers
of erosion; the subsoil, which may or
may not contain reserves of water that
can be tapped by the nomad shepherds
either directly or indirectly by means
of deep boreholes; and lastly the
vegetation cover on which the life of
the animals and the herdsmen ulti¬
mately depends.
The fact that there is grass does
not necessarily mean much in itself.
Grazing land is only of any value if
there is accessible water nearby. To
water a flock of a hundred head during
the dry season, the shepherds must
draw more than 3,500 litres of water
a day from a depth of 30 to 50 metres.
The problems of providing the Sahel
with wells have long been recognized
as crucial, especially during that part
of the year when the pools are dried
up and the animals get hardly any
moisture from the vegetation they
consume.
Sometimes parched, sometimes ver¬
dant, the great expanses of the Sahel
have a vegetation that varies not only
from year to year but also between
different seasons of the same year.
In the steppes of the northern Sahel,
every tuft of vegetation has to com¬
pete for moisture with its neighbours.
The wadis and watercourses provide
favourable ecological conditions. In
their dried-up beds and on their banks
grow plants and small trees, or bushes
whose leaves provide fodder which the
animals relish. However, these favour¬
able conditions are rare in the north
of the Sahel, most of which consists
of pasture land covered with tall,
drought-resistant grass.
The southern Sahel begins where
An ox or a cow needs to drink at least
30 litres of water daily. Deprived of this
amount it is soon reduced to the condition
of the emaciated cow seen at left. On
right, sturdy cattle slake their thirst at a
new borehole in the desert. Many Sahel
wells have dried up, and where water
was once found at a depth of 12 metres,
the nomads must now dig down as much
as 36 metres to reach it.

### 49666: The Battle for survival of the Tuareg and their herds

survival of the Tuareg and their herds
the grass at times forms a continuous
carpet of green, where trees and
bushes begin to dot the landscape and
where the alternation of the seasons
can be more clearly perceived.
There also exist a number of "ref¬
uge" areas in the immediate proximity
of aquifers, streams or rivers, such as
the central Niger delta, and the water
courses, often temporary, which con¬
verge towards it.
What must be borne in mind is the
extreme variability of the grass cover
in space and in time. In an average
year, the vegetation of the Sahel
produces a heavy but short-lived crop.
What animals can live off this
vegetation? A camel will eat whatever
it finds, including thorns. Goats, of
course, are still less hard to please
and will even eat plants which are
toxic to other animals.
In the Sahel, goats in fact play an
ambiguous role: they have, it is true,
a catastrophic effect on the poor
vegetation, but on the other hand they
are the only animals capable of finding
nourishment in certain vegetation
zones, such as on strips of rocky
ground. Cattle, though more choosy,
find food on the various types of
grazing land In the Sahel, while sheep
will eat the grass left over by the cows.
Traditionally, the nomads stay near
to ponds during the wet season.
When these dry out, they lead their
flocks and herds towards areas where
the aquifers lie at a depth of no more
than 10 metres. In the middle of the
dry season, they move towards the
banks of the river or of permanent
branch channels.
The size of the flocks and herds
which the different types of grazing in
the Sahel can support certainly varies
from year to year and from month to
month. The quantity of grass prod¬
uced in one and the same area may
be anything between 600 kg and
5.2 tons to the hectare, and sometimes
the cattle leave untouched as much as
a third of the grass available for
consumption.
With a rainfall of 300 mm., the
number of hectares required to support
one head of cattle ranges from 6 to 30.
Within these ecological constraints, it
is up to the herdsman to decide
whether to increase his herd or to keep
it at the same level.
The herdsmen have themselves been
strongly marked by the environment in
which they live as regards their patterns
of behaviour and their way of life.
Conversely, they have to some
extent transformed that environment by
drilling wells, marking out trails, and
leading their herds from one grazing
ground to another, thus modifying the
grass and bush cover of the ecosystem.
While nomadism as practised in the
north follows no regular pattern, trans¬
humance, or the passage from summer
to winter pastures and vice-versa, is
an annual cycle which allows the
vegetation resources to be used to
the maximum.
The logic of the nomadic system of
stock-rearing and, in the more southerly
regions, of the regular seasonal move¬
ment of herds has been dictated by
the basic characteristics of the Sahel.
The herd followed the vegetation, the
Tuareg or the Maure followed the herd
and the servant tended to his master's
needs and watered the cattle.
But this does not mean that no sort
of control was exercised. One of the
main reasons for the power of the
herdsmen was their skill in managing
the Sahel environment. Wars, conflicts
and fights were frequent, but there
was nevertheless a certain consensus
among the Tuareg concerning the
distribution and rational use of the
grazing grounds and watering points.
Relations between the nomads and '
the villagers were also more or less ^
Herdsmen's ties
of friendship
The Wodaabe one group of the Peul
people practise a traditional form of
aid known as "haBBanaae" (as it
is written in Pular, the Peul language).
It ¡s a kind of contract or bond between
a cattle-owner (the "kaBBanDo",
or "he who attaches") and another
person (the "kaBBanaaDo", or
"he who is attached"), who wishes to
build up a herd. The "kaBBanDo",
a man of substance, lends the
"kaBBanaaDo" one or several cows
to start off a new herd or to
increase an existing one.
The "kaBBanaaDo", usually a young
bachelor or a poor man, rears the
animals on loan to him, keeping the
milk and butter they provide and also
the first three calves born to each cow.
When an "attached" cow has calved
for a third time, it is returned to its
owner and the contract ends.
The "haBBanaae" contract is the special
form of aid for the needy provided
for by Wodaabe custom. The cows on.
loan are called "animals of
friendship", representing not only the
nucleus of a new herd, but also
symbolizing the ties of friendship
between a poor man and a person who
wishes to help him. A Wodaabe
proverb maintains that an "attached"
cow must always be at the head of
the herd: it is always the first to be
watered, it should be caressed and
never beaten. In the evening the herds¬
man must personally take it to the pen.
This love for an "attached" animal is
often held up as an example, and it is
said that one person loves another as
much as he loves the animal "attached"
to him. It is in these terms too that a
boy will express his feelings to the
girl he loves.

codified by custom. Only in areas
with year-round humidity or, further
south, where the rainfall becomes
increasingly abundant, was agriculture
practised and millet grown to be
exchanged for meat and dairy products.
There is therefore nothing here to
disturb the Sahelian environment too
seriously.
It would, however, be unwise to
regard the period of Sahelian history
preceding the colonial conquest or that
which immediately followed it as having
been relatively Idyllic. The "equilib¬
rium" which some people claim then
existed was achieved only at the price
of epidemics which ravaged the cattle
and of increasingly severe famines.
In the Niger part of the Sahel, for
instance, memories subsist from before
the colonial period of the "Ize nere"
(the sale of children) famine when
"useless mouths" were exchanged for
food; of the "Gaasi borgo" when the
people had nothing left to grind In their
mortars but gourds; of the "Yollo
morou" "stroke your mats" (because
there was nothing else to do). (1)
Famines did not end with the arrival
of the French: 1913 saw the great
"beri" ("chest") famine which ravaged
the whole of the Sahel from the
Atlantic to the Red Sea. Between
1931-1932 there was the "Doo izo
jire" the year of the locust larvae.
There was a famine alert In 1937.
Lastly, 1942 was the year of "Wande-
waasu" "Forget about your wife",
so-called because everyone was think¬
ing of saving his own skin.
It was by exacting such a heavy toll
as this that the Sahelian system
functioned. The economies of the
northern and southern fringes comp¬
lemented one another in a relationship
favouring the stock-breeders. But
when people began to tamper with
systems of exchange and dependence
of this type, they did not realize that
this endangered the whole relation¬
ship between man and environment.
Although the landscape of the Sahel
does not seem to have experienced
anything more than localized modifi¬
cation in the last 50 years, the econ¬
omic, social and political life of the
Sahel has, on the contrary, undergone
profound changes.
The most spectacular event was the
end of hegemony by the Tuareg and
the Maures. This conditioned sub¬
sequent events: a "modernization"
policy, preceding then going hand in
hand with the Introduction of a money-
economy. In this way the stage was
set for keener competition for the
different areas of the Sahel. The
survival of the peoples involved
seemed likely to hinge on their use
and mastery of these regions.
One might summarize the situation
at the beginning of this century on the
southern edge of the Sahara and in the
(1) André Salifou. "Crise alimentaire au
Niger: les leçons du passé." (Food crisis
in Niger: the lessons of the past.) Formation
pour l'Environnement (Training for the
Environment.) Niamey, 1974.
northern part of the Sahel as follows.
Firstly, there was constant pressure by
the nomads whether Tuareg, Maure
or Peul on the sedentary population;
the two groups certainly had peaceful
contacts, but there were also many
occasions when surprise attacks were
carried out by the nomads.
The settled regions, inhabited by
blacks, provided the stock-breeders
with the millet which formed an in¬
dispensable part of their diet and
with menial workers who were soon
culturally assimilated. Furthermore,
within the area usually inhabited by
the nomads, the relations between the
population and the environment were
periodically adjusted by annual epidem¬
ics of diseases which man was then
incapable of checking, by droughts and
by wars between nomad groups which
sometimes led to a redistribution of
livestock and of captives from the
southern part of the Sahel.
However, It would be wrong to
present too schematic a picture.
Tuareg and Maure societies each have
their own kind of balance, some groups
specializing in warfare, others forming
marabout religious communities, with
"captives" (servants) performing tasks
such as guarding and watering the
flocks, crop-growing in oases, and
domestic work.
The Tuareg never seem to have
practised more than a limited number
of professions. This is still the case
today: a survey of Tuaregs in the
Tahoua area reveals that only two per
cent of the population are craftsmen
and less than 0.2 per cent are traders.
The organization of the Peul groups, on
the other hand, is quite different.
Tuareg hegemony over a large part
of what is now Mali and Niger was
challenged by the advance of colonial
power. At first there was strong
resistance, then in 1916-1917, a general
uprising throughout the whole of the
Tuareg country. This uprising was
sternly put down, with the result that
most of the families who held power
were eliminated and the Tuareg confed¬
erations dissolved. The colonial era
thus signified the reversal of the
relationship based on force between
the nomad herdsmen and the villagers.
From then on, the situation changed
rapidly. Thus freed from the pressure
exerted by the nomads, the black
population of the south was able to
extend the area under cultivation,
encroaching further and further upon
the herdsmen's traditional grazing
lands, a process which In the long term
was to have serious consequences.
The colonial power was in fact based
on the areas populated by sedentary
farmers; it protected them and re¬
cruited its auxiliaries from among them.
It was the farming townships which
received the administrative facilities
set up by the colonial authorities and
it was the sedentary peoples who got
the lower grade administrative jobs,
while the Tuareg, the Maures and to
a large extent the Peul turned their
backs on the schools set up by the
French and the English, regarding them
as institutions which led the young
astray from Islam and helped to
consolidate the influence of the foreign
conquerors.
At the same time as relations
between farmers and herdsmen were
changing, profound transformations
were also taking place within nomad
societies. The relations between
groups and families, already weakened
by the measures taken by the colonial
administration, tended to become
weaker still. There was no longer the
need, as before, to come together for
purposes of attack or defence. New
wells enabled certain groups to change
their former grazing grounds and to
move away from the rest of their kin.
The former prestige of the noble
tribes and families was undermined.
Distinctive changes took place within
each group and within society as a
whole the relationship between cap¬
tives and their masters became looser.
Traditionally servants had been
either those who looked after the cattle
and gradually managed to build up
their own herd, or those who did the
household chores for the master's
family, acted as guards or, in the case
of women, fetched water, collected
seeds of wild plants, etc.
The .colonial authorities however,
abolished serfdom and the nomads'
servants gradually became aware of
their rights. Some of them took a long
time to decide to leave their masters
and set up on their own with few
means of subsistence, but gradually
more and more former captives left the
nomad camps, usually settling in the
south.
Tuareg society, which had already
suffered at its apex, was thus slowly
undermined at its base. The tra¬
ditional pastoral economy was left
with a declining work force and the
"true" Tuareg found themselves with
fewer and fewer men to guide and
guard their herds. However, there
was only a slight drop in the number
of livestock of most Tuareg families.
The total number of livestock for
a group of three households living
more or less interdependently must
consist of a herd of 11 to 20 camels
and from 50 to 100 cattle. But it
should also be made clear that the
livestock are unequally distributed
between the different herdsmen.
There are hardly any groups of
herdsmen without animals of their own.
Individuals without possessions of their
own often have to be absorbed Into
households which have a herd. Nearly
a third of nomad groups, however, have
no more than 10 camels and/or
50 cattle, while one tenth of all such
groups have as many as from 40 to
90 camels and/or 200 to 600 cattle.
Thus although they lost their power,
the Tuareg kept or built up, again herds
of by no means negligible size. To a
certain extent, therefore, they gained
from the "development policy" applied
in the Sahel.

DESERT CARGOES OF SALT
The transport of salt is a major activity of the caravans which ply within the vast region
stretching from Mauritania to Ethiopia. The rock salt they carry is found in natural
deposits in the Sahara, the Sahel and Ethiopia. Lower photo, opposite page, shows
workers prising loose the crust of salt at Lake Assale in the Danakil depression, Ethiopia.
The salt is sliced into blocks, or "loaves", and then transported by camel caravans
(left) across the Sahel and the desert, for sale in oases and markets (below) or is
often bartered for millet. Because of this transport over long distances, the salt
sometimes fetches more than 20 times its cost price when sold at market.

### 49669: The 'Outsiders' on the trail to progress

on the trail to progress
THE policies of the colonial
period were fraught with ideo¬
logical and practical contradictions.
For one thing, currency was "given to
the myth of the noble shepherd
Tuareg or Peul while at the same
time the authorities extolled the black
farmers.
Certain measures were taken to help
the herders by sinking wells and
building a few nomad schools, but
simultaneously their "refuge" areas
were reduced by encouraging small¬
holders servants or freed captives
to settle there or by systematically
peopling the Inland delta of the Niger
River.
A careful study would no doubt
show that an "anti-pastoral outlook"
usually predominated, and this became
even more pronounced with the advent
of independence.
In the first place, there was a
tendency to look upon the nomads
with suspicion. They were as reluctant
to accept the new institutions as they
had been the previous ones. They
seemed elusive, arrogant, undisciplined
and more Interested In their cattle
than in the territorial limits of their new
countries. In short, they were poor
citizens.
Secondly, nomad problems were
customarily viewed through sedentary
eyes. By and large, policies were
defined and then applied by people
who were under the impression that
the rains came every year without fail.
The striking feature of policies with
regard to the Sahel is the large
measure of continuity from colonial
times down to the present, except
that in the post-independence period
measures to enable the population to
survive the difficult years have often
been overlooked.
Former pastoral policies were mostly
continued after independence by the
various governments concerned and
were Implemented in the different
Sahelian countries along quite similar
lines. Wells were dug along the
nomad trails and commercial routes,
and they were equipped with pumping
stations to replace the manpower of
captives used In days gone by.
Administrative rules and regulations
for stock-raising were introduced in
some parts, defining forbidden areas
and fire-protection zones, though these
regulations were usually not respected.
Similarly, almost everywhere the burn¬
ing of grasses was forbidden but this
prohibition too had little effect.
Water-holes offer the advantage of
providing ample water, In some cases
without requiring any special instal¬
lation, and also of opening trails to
new pastures. But the herds tended
to flock more and more round such
watering places and ruin the surround¬
ing land. Over-grazing and trampling
killed off the vegetation and con¬
tributed to topsoil erosion.
Thus the water-hole produces a
desert In its own vicinity. This means
that daily food must be sought farther
and farther away, thereby increasing
constantly the distance between the
pasture and the watering point. The
option Is then either to let the herds
die of thirst amid rich grazing lands,
or die of hunger near a well.
While the drilling of wells and the
conservation of pasture lands have
had both positive and negative effects,
veterinary prophylaxis has been
undeniably successful In this region.
Cattle-plague and lung-plague have
diminished in a spectacular way. The
Interstate campaign to wipe out cattle-
plague has led to a great Increase in
the number of cattle, followed by
rational stock-farming, which has
resulted in social problems and a
shortage of animal fodder due to over¬
grazing.
It soon became apparent however
that the very success of certain
aspects of the "modernization" policies
in the Sahel was going to spell disaster.
The likelihood of failure was all the
greater because little thought had been
given to the training needed to match
the changes that were taking place.
The expansion of education scarcely
touched the northern Sahel, and where
it did produce some results its effect
was mostly to drain off the "élite".
Once these people succeeded In their
studies, they hardly ever returned to
their area of origin.
Furthermore, here as elsewhere,
what the schools proposed was a
fictitious environment, modelled on
that of the developed countries, and
they trained young people for the life
of city bureaucrats rather than for
mastery of their own surroundings.
This is undoubtedly an essential
aspect of what has happened In the
Sahel. The gradual advance of a
money economy, the drilling of new
wells and the improved techniques In
veterinary medicine all form part of
a "development" philosophy aimed at
bringing the Sahel peoples into the
circuit of the dominant economic
system, without any accurate estimate
of the real risks Involved In achieving
such "progress".
Neither before nor after Indepen¬
dence was there any attempt to ask
a number of vital questions: Who
makes a profit from the outflow of the
Sahel's production and the distribution
of certain products consumed by the
nomads and farmers of this region? ^
Harvest time
in the Sahel
The cultivation of millet plays a major
part in the rural economy of the Sahel.
Grown by sedentary farmers (photo
opposite page shows heads of millet
ready for harvest), millet is sold or
bartered for meat and milk provided
by nomad herdsmen (see also page 22).
Above, a farmer digs holes in which
to plant millet seeds. Top photo,

stalks preserve fertility of topsoil

What proportion of these profits is
reinvested in the region to its benefit,
what proportion leaves the region,
especially for Europe or else remains
in the hands of the urban population?
How, for example, should one view
the increasingly widespread policy of
encouraging the development of ranch-
style stock-breeding? The fact that
the task of "modernizing" the Sahel Is
divided between a number of different
bodies makes it quite easy to avoid
posing questions of this kind.
The environment is rarely considered
as a whole. The people are only taken
into account as one factor among
many. Technical success the rapid
increase in the numbers of the Sahel's
livestock obscures some highly dis¬
turbing facts. Remoteness, compart-
mentalization and failure to appreciate
the complexity and interdependence
of the various physical, social and
economic factors of the nomad's life
and environment have long charac¬
terized action taken with regard to
stock-raising in the Niger Bend area
of the Sahel. Efforts to develop this
area, whether taken by colonial officials
or by national leaders since Indepen¬
dence, have thus been predestined to
failure and disappointment.
The objective of development plans
has often been an increase in the
number of cattle without devoting
sufficient attention to the age-old
organization of pasture-lands, the
control exercised by the herdsmen
themselves over the number of animals
grazing on any one area and the
proper use of watering places.
Options have generally been deter¬
mined by calculating profits on the
basis of principles worked out in the
industrialized countries in response to
needs that were quite different.
While the technocrats were often
oblivious of the defects and dangers
implicit in these Sahelian policies, the
nomads and many farmers were per¬
fectly aware of them. It is not sur¬
prising that stock-breeders were loath
to accept the directives of the public
authorities.
In the Menaka region, for example,
the installation of a number of "mod¬
ern" watering spots produced a
paradoxical reaction among the nomad
herders: they would not alter their
"pastoral calendar" and even refused
Millet is the staple diet of the Sahel's
nomads and settled farmers. But a
diet of millet alone can cause severe
and even fatal malnutrition and must be
supplemented with proteins (milk
and meat). Right, typical millet
granary found in the villages of Zerma
farmers in the neighbourhood of Niamey
(Niger). The dome-shaped structure of
plaited millet stalks is raised on wooden
piles to keep out rodents and insects.
Yet grain losses from village granaries
are of the order of 5 to 10 per cent,
according to FAO experts.

to pasture their herds in the area
where these new wells had been drilled.
New trails were opened up in the
Gourma region by drilling wells where
there were "no customs to upset", but
"the project met with Indifference and
even suspicion on the part of the
Gourma nomads towards government
intervention in the pasturing of their
herds."
In one sense the herdsmen benefit¬
ted from what the State did, including
its health campaigns, especially through
vaccination, which brought a sharp
drop in cases of measles and smallpox.
But on the other hand, the herdsmen
see some State action as an inter¬
ference in the way they like to roam
with their cattle and an attempt to
force them into commercialization.
A fact which is often overlooked,
yet which has been responsible for the
transformation of the Sahel and Sahara
belts in the last two decades, is the
rise of speculative stock-breeding,
brought on primarily by the rapid
growth of the large coastal towns.
There are three main aspects to the
emerging trend: the proportion of cattle
In the herds has risen; efforts have
been made to increase the size of
herds more rapidly; the sale of animal
products has been greatly expanded.
Thus the Sahel, and particularly the
area in the bend of the Niger River,
has become the meeting-place for a
"backward" system of animal hus¬
bandry and a system more directly
integrated in the prevailing economic
circuit.
Most of the Tuareg practise the
first system. Their salient character¬
istics are their attachment to traditional
values, their desire to increase the
size of their herds (but not necessarily
with the idea of selling the animals)
and their preference for barter in their
business deals.
On the other hand, a market-type
system of stock-breeding is found
among the Diawambé cattle dealers,
the sedentary Songhai cattlemen and
some of the Bousous who have
become sedentary.
The persistence, among the Tuareg
especially, of an attitude that leaves
little room for contact with a money
economy does not by any means
imply stagnation or unprogressiveness
in that society. On the contrary, there
are many signs of change. "From
contact with the farmers, his neigh¬
bours and trading partners to the
south, the nomad herdsman of the
Niger Bend has learned to consume
more and discover new needs.
"Women have been the first victims
of this confrontation between two
ways of life which differ in their
approach to production and consump¬
tion. Tuareg women have the greater
share of responsibility for the running
of the household. Even when they do
not work they manage the family
budget and either provide for or decide
about daily expenses.
"To judge by the demand for jewel¬
lery, fabrics and trading-company
products, they are currently playing an
active role in the change-over now
taking place in a 'pastoral com¬
munity." (1) New consumption patterns
are developing among the Tuareg
today, largely because economic
relations have an increasingly monetary
character.
Barter has long been the practice
throughout the Sahel. Historically it
has not been very advantageous for
the small farmers since it was carried
on in such a way that they could
obtain meat and milk but could not
form herds of their own.
After the struggle between the
herdsmen and those who worked the
land died down, and the generation
of those who remembered it had
passed away, the nomads had to agree
to what they had resisted for so long:
to trade off their heifers for sacks of
millet or maize and allow the farmers
to build up their own livestock.
Thus the Tuareg lost their virtual
monopoly over cattle-raising, and in
many places the sedentary folk were
the ones who henceforth set the terms
of exchange. In this way money came
into general use and caused a break
with the old system of barter.
Everyone living in the Sahel area,
for that matter, has felt the effects of
a trading economy ,and the system of
setting aside part of the agricultural
production. This fraction of the herd
and harvest which must be sold in
order to pay taxes and purchase such
goods as tea, sugar, cloth, blankets,
etc. is constantly increasing.
Most of the Sahelian peoples have
suffered from the depreciation in value
of livestock and millet in relation to
taxes and manufactured articles; the
nomads have watched their livestock
depreciate in relation to the price of
millet. Thus the nomads are subject
to a twofold exploitation: first, when
they pay taxes and buy certain
imported goods, and second, when
they trade their animals for millet.
However, this type of exploitation
scarcely affected the nomads' particu¬
lar way of life as long as climatic
conditions were normal. In addition,
modernization encouraged some in¬
crease in the number of livestock, and
this compensated to a small extent for
the deterioration of terms of trade.
But the growth of a money econ¬
omy introduced into Sahelian life
factors whose effects were to boost
trade and draw off profits more
systematically from the herdsmen's
resources.
The increase in the circulation of
money and the possibility of organizing
trade networks over long distances,
based on livestock which could be

Afrique Sahéllenne." See footnote page 11.
bought for "reasonable prices" were
to encourage some livestock-dealers
to venture as far as the seasonal
refuges and trails used by the nomads.
These new networks appear to have
been operating for just over ten years.
From 1962 to 1967, for example,
"livestock traders from the upper delta
of the Niger travelled north into the
Gourma, where they settled along
the river." (1) These traders were
mainly Diawambés, traditional livestock
dealers, along with some Sarakolés.
They all quickly adapted to the special
conditions of sedentary livestock
rearing in the Niger valley.
One result of this intrusion by new¬
comers has been an urgent demand
for paid herdsmen, either specialized
or unskilled, in the livestock-rearing
areas of the Niger Bend. More and
more shepherds, from the Bobo and In
some cases the Sarakolé peoples, are
receiving money for their work.
The emergence of new types of
relations between "antiquated" stock-
breeding and speculative stock-
breeding, and new forms of exchange
relations, have led to keener compe¬
tition for land in the Sahel.
First of all, there has been the
movement of black farmers into the
dry agricultural area. They need more
land not only because they double in
population every thirty years, but also
because in addition to their sub¬
sistence crops they cultivate ground¬
nuts and cotton.
But it might well be asked whether
or not this extension of the cultivated
area has to a large extent been
wasteful. "Even before the drought
reached alarming proportions, farmers
were becoming increasingly careless
about cultivating their fields: techniques
were being abandoned or neglected;
the tradition of organizing mutual aid
by farmers was disappearing; and
migrants who were supposed to return
during the season to cultivate their
land did not always do so. All the
evidence indicates that the farmers
were cultivating areas that were too
large, and doing it badly." (2)
The pioneer belt is not only being
occupied by farmers from the south,
however, and by villages which were
already there and have expanded. In
the intervening areas that remain, the
Bousous have set up their huts and
tents and are tilling the soil exten¬
sively. They are able to live on a bit
of grain, wild fruits and plants, and
when they have a few animals, from
the produce of this livestock. In any
case, the nomads and transhumant
herdsmen do not have such free
access to the stubble and fallow fields
as they once did.
What is still more serious for the
herders is the closing off of areas
where water is available. These areas
have either been fenced off with
hedges to protect alluvial crops culti¬
vated in the vicinity of pools, river
banks and basins that have been more
or less developed, or they are being t

K absorbed by the expanding cultivation
of rice.
Places which are still accessible to
the herds are quickly over-grazed. The
grass disappears and it is hard to
revive it. Villagers are Increasingly in¬
clined to deny the herders access to
refuge areas, and the leaner their har¬
vest, the more reluctant they are to
tolerate strangers in the vicinity.
Thus it is difficult for the nomads to
move from place to place with their
animals and they find themselves
partly excluded from the best areas.
"Cultivation of irrigated land is being
increased to the detriment of pastures.
This Is confirmed by such signs as the
increasing number of clashes between
stock-breeders and farmers over sea¬
sonal grazing grounds and by the much
shorter time spent by livestock In the
valley." (1)
These restrictions and the gradual
pushing back of the herdsmen create
new problems. Some of the nomad
groups have been forced to migrate
farther to the north. It is estimated that
from 1940 to 1970 the northernmost
limit of the area traversed by the Peul
nomads shifted upwards from the 15th
parallel to the 18th, a distance of more
than 200 km.
This drive northward has been made
with Bororo zebus tawny cows with a
high hump and horns in the form of
a lyre which is the breed these herds¬
men prefer, though at this latitude it is
slightly outside its normal ecological
setting since it is heavier and less
resistant than the Azavaq cows raised
by the Tuareg.
Furthermore, the Peul herds are
largely made up of cattle, whereas the
Tuareg herds are more diversified and
thus take better advantage of pasture-
lands, because sheep and goats can
graze on plants that cattle leave be¬
hind. It is not surprising therefore that
the Bororo livestock has suffered more
from the effects of exposure to pro¬
longed drought.
In any event, the introduction of this
specialized breed has placed an ad¬
ditional strain on the already over¬
worked pastures and has also led to an
excessive consumption of resources,
particularly wild cereals which might
have served to feed human beings had
the livestock not got to them first.
Naturally, this intrusion has brought
about conflict with the Tuareg in the
area. The most serious consequence
of the expansion of the sedentary
people and the nomad's northward
thrust has been the upsetting of the
traditional use made of grazing ranges
and watering points. On the one hand,
in the southern part of the Sahel and
in the refuge areas, newcomers have
appeared with livestock whose num¬
bers regularly increase ; on the other,
(1) Ba Sayon Fofana. "L'élevage bovin
dans la Boucle du Niger."
various groups of the nomads them¬
selves are encroaching on pasture-
land which is not traditionally theirs.
Customs and agreements regarding
the use of routes and wells "are disap¬
pearing under the combined pressures
of new cattle-owners and the State's
re-allocation of pasture-lands." (1)
Groups which had dug their own wells
and managed them have now had to
relinquish control over the organization
of their grazing land. After being dis¬
possessed politically, they are now
being dispossessed economically, and
this has created particular hardship for
Tuareg families.
One extremely serious matter is the
fact that a well may be drilled for
anyone who requests It. This does
away with all control by the traditional
assemblies and territorial chiefs, while
at the same time the "modern" regu¬
lations and laws are not enforced very
strictly. In reality, the cattle-raisers'
geographical freedom of movement is
what leads to the disorganization of
the pasture lands.
The authorities did in fact attempt to
replace this custom with other regu¬
lations. But in most cases their move
was not well received by the stock¬
breeders.
Nevertheless, after the first few
years of drought, numerous herders
changed their attitude. Rather than be
totally excluded from some areas, they
sometimes preferred to abide strictly
by the decisions that had been taken.
Yet even if, at that stage, an attempt
had been made to reorganize the Sahel
region, it would already have been too
late.
The determining factor here which
is the result of irregular rains is the
shortening or disappearance of the
period of active plant growth. Thus
certain grasses that need large
amounts of water adapt to drought
conditions but put forth one or two
blades instead of five or six. Vast
areas have completely lost their grassy
carpet and the soil Is painfully dry.
The average length of the Senegal
acacia leaf decreased from 34.3 mm in
1971-1972 to 24.7 mm in 1972-1973.
Fruit production has shown an even
greater decline : only one tree out of
six is bearing fruit two years in a row.
Still more alarming was the death of
a large percentage of trees and shrubs
In 1972-1973. Over half the Senegal
acacia trees died off in that period.
The drought has had harmful conse¬
quences, but the Sahel has also been
badly damaged by the herders who
have had no scruples about destroying
or mutilating the remaining bushes and
trees of the region in the hope of
saving their animals.
These clumps of trees and thickets
have had an extremely important func¬
tion in the Sahel. For one thing, they
formed tiny refuges that fostered the
growth of plant and small animal life,
and from which both could spread and
recover the intervening ground. They
also offered shade to the young
domestic animals and protected the
herders themselves from the torrid sun.
Cattle-raisers have suffered untold
hardships from the drought. A succes¬
sion of lean years up to 1972 debilitated
the livestock and contributed to a higher
mortality rate.. Farmers were obliged
to cut into the reserves that they kept
for their subsistence or for sale.
Then came 1973 with its sparse and
badly-timed rains. Dry crops gave a
poor yield and irrigated ones did not
produce what had been expected,
since the large rivers, as well as small
lakes and ponds, did not receive
enough water to overflow their banks
and allow the usual alluvial planting.
Pastures are indeed vanishing. Con¬
trary to what normally used to happen,
sheep and goats are now competing
with cattle for the same grass and the
same brush. Many wells and ponds
are drying up. The reduction or disap¬
pearance of surface water has a direct
effect on the herders and farmers
because this Is the water that is most
readily accessible to them and that
they can use with the techniques and
devices at their disposal.
It is at the group level however that
the breakdown of the environment has
been having its most dramatic impact.
The nomads, as we have seen, had
adapted to their arid surroundings by
moving from place to place and using
the meagre resources that they
encountered along the way.
The settlers adapted by using the
available water to best advantage, by
trying to reduce risks to a minimum
through their system of cultivation, by
storing several years' supply of grain
for their own consumption, and occa¬
sionally by trading with the nomads.
It was by dint of such expedients that
the Sahelian peoples were able to
protect themselves from the constant
threat of famine.
This is no longer the case. The herds
have grown, and extending the nomad
range has not sufficed to provide the
cattle with minimum food requirements.
Wherever a bit of hay is still to be
found, it is often far from the watering
points whose immediate vicinity has
been laid completely bare. Nomadism
has thus ceased to play its time-hon¬
oured role in the Sahel.
Farmers, on the other hand, have
been able to maintain their traditional
system of agriculture, but crops such
as peanuts and cotton have been intro¬
duced into the southern Sahel and
have progressed dangerously towards
vulnerable areas where they are upset¬
ting the old practice of crop rotation.
By 1972 and 1973 the deterioration
of the Sahelian environment and the
displacement of the northern Sahel
societies had entered a virtually irre¬
versible phase. It became evident that
the herds had grown too large.
In 1972, the cumulative effects of

previous bad years caused a disparity
between the size of the flocks and
herds and the extent of the remaining
pasture land which was this time irre¬
mediable.
The press of cattle round certain
wells was so great that they dried up.
The distance between watering points
that had not run dry, and between
these and grazing areas that could still
be used, increased to such an extent
that the weakened, thirsty beasts could
scarcely cover It. And by now the
refuge areas, too, were falling in their
function.
But how large were the herds when
the Tuaregs decided to undertake their
exodus? Was their size really that Im¬
portant? Perhaps the fact that nearly
all the horses and two-thirds of the
asses had died off was not so serious.
What alarmed the herdsmen more than
this was the loss of over half of their
camels and goats, along with 40 per
cent of their cows.
In addition to these numerical losses,
the value of livestock is dropping from
day to day. Cattle products were
already depreciating as compared
with the produce of the settled peoples.
Exchange rates plummeted and the
herders were the losers. After three
years of cereal-crop failure an 80 kilo¬
gramme sack of millet was selling at
the town of Gao, In April-May 1972, for
between 5,000 and 20,000 Malian
francs, whereas a cow was worth only
1,000 Malian francs, a heifer 3,000 and
a calf 450.
Three words water, pasture, millet
sum up the whole basis of life in the
Sahel. Drawing on reserves of grain,
farmers are better placed than
nomad herdsmen to weather periods
of scarcity and even serious drought.

### 49670: Twenty thousand arrived but no one knows how many started out

arrived but no one knows how many started out
PURSUED by hunger and drought,
the nomads sooner or later
came to a halt somewhere at a
spot where a few refugees had
already drifted, close to some
locality where at least they could beg
and find something to drink. Some¬
times food distribution centres were
set up where these little groups of
people had formed. News got around,
and other wanderers began to gather.
A good many Mali nomads arrived
at the Lazaret camp, close to Niamey,
after making their way down either
bank of the Niger. A series of gul-
leys and branch channels of rivers
also lead in the direction of the capi¬
tal of Niger. Understandably, those
in search of water and hoping to find
grazing land in the damper regions
followed these routes.
Some also felt that only in a major
city could they hope to receive a
little help.
As a result the few groups that had
settled in Niamey, on the outskirts of
the Lazaret camp, as early as 1973,
swelled rapidly. Their numbers jump¬
ed suddenly from 4,000 to 6,000 bet¬
ween November and December. In
January 1974 this figure climbed to
10,000 and in February it passed the
12,000 mark. The high point of 22,000
was reached in August 1974.
One has the impression that the
Lazaret camp contains only the rem¬
nants of families. "None of the fami¬
lies at the Lazaret at the present time
is complete. We don't know if our
relatives who stayed behind are going
to join us here, or whether we shall
return to try to find them."
The composition of one family from
Gao is disturbing: six men aged
between 30 and 65, and only one
woman over 15. Surely these men are
married. But where are their wives?
Elsewhere, we find eleven adults (over
15 years old) with only six children
between them, none of whom is less
than five years old. What has
happened to the others?
These survivors of drought and
famine are today packed together on
an almost treeless plateau, swept by
a sand-laden wind where there is only
one dispensary and a few Zerma huts.
The moral and physical wretched¬
ness of these conditions weighs heavily
on the nomads. Water is available,
but in niggardly quantities. And what
most upsets these refugees in the
camp are the smells and the flies and
"the worms that suck our blood".
There Is little to be gleaned from
the surrounding countryside: a few
broken boughs and, with a bit of luck,
some millet stalks to build a shelter..
Yet four households out of five gather r

The Tuareg find ready-to-hand all the materials they need to produce
the fittings and furnishings for their tents : poles and posts, curtains
of fibre matting and animal hair carpets with traditional designs
which keep the cold and sand at bay (photo above). Beneath the tents,
the Tuareg unfold beds like the one shown below, its solid feet and
frame carved with skill and artistry. Strips of matting, here rolled
up ready to be carried, are used as screens against the wind. Among
the Wodaabe, a group of the Peul nomads, the women usually carry
furnishings and utensils on their heads. Opposite page, a Tuareg

^ brushwood to make cooking fires. A
quarter of the families also use millet
straw. Customarily in their home
regions, the nomads used dried animal
dung as fuel, but here only one in
twenty does so since there are hardly
any animals left to produce it.
The majority of nomads have no¬
where to shelter or to sleep on arrival.
Most of their tents, cushions and
blankets have been sold, or sometimes
simply abandoned when there were no
more animals left to carry them. Vir¬
tually the only exception to this are
the Wodaabe, whose women are used
to carrying on their heads household
utensils and sometimes even pieces
of wood for use as bed frames.
Almost all the nomads have had
something to eat daily since their arri¬
val in Niamey. Not that the distri¬
butions have necessarily provided
everyone with an adequate ration, but
at least these distributions have been
systematic and regular.
Yet the nomads are haunted by the
fear that one day these handouts may
cease. When asked what they worry
about most, half of them reply: food.
At the end of January 1974, there
were 400 graves in the camp ceme¬
tery. But now that the hardships of
the exodus are over, one can say that
fewer people are dying at Lazaret.
To cope with this swarm of refugees
from Niger and other countries, in
such a desperate state of malnutrition
and sickness, obviously poses a tre¬
mendous problem.
Nevertheless, in the month prior to
the survey at the camp, half the fami¬
lies had at least one member receiving
medical treatment. As for malnutrition,
this is serious, but perhaps less so
than one might have feared. The
worst hit are already dead.
The first signs of an awakening, of
a desire on the part of the nomads to
take their fate in their own hands are
now appearing In the camp. For the
moment only a very small minority has
reacted in this way but the new atti¬
tude nevertheless led the refugees to
make some basic improvements In the
camp early in 1974.
About that time seven schools
were opened, while a women's action
group also got down to work. These
first steps taken by the nomad refu¬
gees towards reorganizing their sur¬
roundings may well mark the end of
their attitude of resignation.
They are now utterly cut off from
their original surroundings and way of
life. In the past the meat and milk
they obtained from their livestock
provided their daily food and also
served as a means of exchange
against millet. From the hides and
the fleeces of their animals they made
harnesses, water-skins, tents and
clothing. Even the animals' dung was
used as fuel.
Now, however, food is brought from
far away in planes or lorries, along
with blankets and clothes. Waste
materials and packing cases from the
town are used for building huts or
as fuel for cooking.
Formerly, the risk of uncertain food
supplies was a problem which the
people of the Sahel coped with on
their own with varying success. Today
attempts are being made to solve It
through international aid. For the
links binding the human group to its
Sahel environment as well as those
binding the human group itself have
snapped simultaneously.
All that remains today is the debris
of a people, exposed to misery,
reduced to depending upon assistance
from others.
For those nomads who have lost
their flocks, the situation remains
bleak. "They are totally uprooted,
facing unknown horizons in a land
whose language they do not speak.
Nothing remains of their former envi¬
ronment, neither their dwellings (though
they have occasionally managed to
build makeshift homes from materials
such as cardboard or jerrycans) nor
their eating habits.
"There are no more pack animals
left. Men face the long and arduous
task of learning to work as labourers
or as craftsmen, changes their caste-
based society would never have
tolerated under normal circumstances.
So refugee families now depend upon
charity and public goodwill, both of
which are unpredictable, and on any
menial tasks others may give them
(fetching water, hewing wood or
grinding millet...)." (1)
Camp-life first strikes the nomad
refugee as unfamiliar and bewildering.
Many of those in the camp sink Into
an apparently bottomless gloom. But
most of them dream. Among adult
refugees, five out of six told us of
their day-dreams. One head of a
family group told us he "dreamed only
of famine". Others dream of "the lorry
which comes to distribute food". Many
look back over their former lives: "We
dream of having our animals and of
living In the bush as we used to."
Should they stay or should they
leave? What do the refugees really
think about this vital question? Some
of them want to return to their home¬
land. "We want to go back home If
we can have the means; the day we
have something to hold on to... If I
could, I'd stay there forever. If I
could live In my own land, I wouldn't
want to be anywhere else."
But only ten per cent of the nomads
are thinking of returning, so these
viewpoints are somewhat exceptional.
The most widespread feeling is
that the Tuareg nation has been forced
to migrate en masse and that It is
going to have to find a new land for
itself.
(1) Yveline Poncet "La Sécheresse en
Afrique Sahéllenne." See footnote page 11.
But there is another, by no means
unimportant aspect: the psychological
shock from which these nomads now
seem to be suffering. They claim they
are being exploited, and particularly in
economic terms: they say they are not
given enough millet In exchange for
their livestock in the markets of Mall.
As a result their purchasing power as
stockbreeders is constantly declining.
Others complain that when they
make enclosures of thorn bushes in
order to keep calves from their mo¬
thers, they are accused of uprooting
protected shrub species and are fined.
They also protest that they are forced
to pay an exorbitant tax every time
they want to dig a new well.
Whether or not these allegations are
true is less important than the degree
to which the Tuareg believe them to
be so, and the need to clearly under¬
stand the implications of this state of
mind. What many refugees feel about
this flight in the face of drought may
well have political repercussions.
These are men and women who, in
the final analysis, are seeking not
merely a drop of water and a mouth¬
ful of food, but also peace of mind,
a haven, a place where as a people
they may once more hope to exist.
When parents see no future for
themselves in the region they have
left, they draw the logical conclusion
and begin to hope for another way. of
life for their children.
Many of them see which way the
times are moving; they see that ani¬
mals are no longer productive. "We
don't want our children to become
nomads", they say, "now we can see
that a settled life is better than a
nomadic one."
Generally speaking, about a third
hope to see their children following in
their footsteps and taking up the same
occupation. One head of family in six
says this depends on their being able
to build up big enough herds. All the
same, a little over half of all the nomad
refugees don't want to see their chil¬
dren ending up as herdsmen.
This means that the new generation
will need a different type of education
from that given to the previous one.
AID BY AIRLIFT
AND DESERT CONVOYS
A massive international programme of
emergency aid has channelled food, tents,
blankets and medical help by land, air
and sea to the peoples of the Sahel
afflicted by drought and famine. Top
right, like ants in the giant bowl of sand
and sky, a convoy of relief trucks halts
briefly in the Sahara en route from England
to Niger. Regular airlifts have brought
food and equipment to the stricken
African region. Right, Tuaregs greet a
transport plane from Belgium on its
arrival in Niger. Belgian planes alone in
1973-1974 logged 1,755 flying hours and
flew a total of 700,000 km to bring in over
5,000 tons of relief cargoes.

Right, lessons for Sahel refugee
children at an improvised school in a
relief camp near Niamey (Niger).
The refugees spontaneously set up
seven of these schools in the camp
early last year. Now cut off from their
homeland, the vast majority of parents
in the camp see schooling as the key
to a new life for their children. Opposite
page, Tuareg shepherds of Tassili
in southern Algeria, where high cliffs
(background) have been sculpted
into fantastic shapes by wind and rain.
THE exodus suddenly improved
the standing of the few refugee
children who somehow or other had
previously managed to obtain a little
schooling. They came into contact
and began to communicate with
peoples from other ethnic groups.
Above all, they found themselves in
the best position to get the maximum
from those bringing aid, by serving
as interpreters, or most coveted of
tasks acting as go-betweens when
food supplies were being distributed.
The nomads soon realized that these
children stood the best chance of
finding relatively well-paid work and
of fitting into modern life. Some of
the adults too would welcome an
opportunity of learning, like one
Tuareg from Gao, who said, "If I had
the chance to go to school, I'd jump
at it."
This marked desire for education is
borne out by the fact that 96 per cent
of all heads of families say they would
like their children to go to school.
But what kind of schooling should they
have? The refugees themselves firmly
believe that mastery of a widely-spoken
language should be a vital part of this
education.
What do they think about the kind
of values that ought to be passed onto
the rising generations? Some believe
the child himself ought to choose
his future way of life: "Once he's
educated, it's up to the child to
decide which qualities he thinks are
important."
Does' this mean parents are drawing
the logical conclusions from their
present Inability to provide food for
their offspring and to exercise their
authority? Or are they merely becom¬
ing aware that nomad values are going
to be of little use in urban life?
Perhaps both.
So the education being envisaged
for the children thus marks a complete
break with the dreams and hopes of
their elders. In other words, the
Tuareg have given up all thought of
30
transmitting their traditional values
through education. Does this mean
they are going to abandon these values
in other aspects of their lives?
The current attitude of the nomads
towards the marriage of their daughters
is somewhat surprising. One head of
family out of ten demands that the
suitor be Muslim, while one in five
will not consider a blacksmith or a
servant as eligible. Nearly half the
heads of family, however, seem ready
to accept just about anyone as a son-
in-law.
But some consider that "even
poverty cannot justify abandoning
one's principles", like one family from
Gao which Is only prepared to. marry
its children to those descended from
a Marabout (holy man). "Even a rich
man could not marry a daughter of
mine", says the head of this family.
However, this is not a widely held
view. Most of the nomads are per¬
fectly aware of the consequences of
their altered situation upon matrimonial
choices. "Before, I only gave my
daughters in marriage to Muslims.
Now, I would marry my daughter to
anyone who brought us food."
Some heads of family avoid taking
up a stand in the face of this collapse
of traditional Tuareg attitudes to
marriage and leave their daughters
freedom of choice. "The woman must
choose for herself."
There are signs that the Tuareg
have broken with the image they
formerly had of themselves. "Now¬
adays, they are afraid of the bush, and
the townspeople make fun of them."
Many refugees feel that only re¬
ligion now binds them together as a
group, and that through Islam they
have something in common with the
population among which they have
settled.
Subordinate or dependency relation¬
ships have practically collapsed, even
though certain "captives" still cling to
their masters as offering the only hope
of protection; in other cases, however,
servants or craftsmen have taken pity
on their former masters who, to begin
with at least, have been incapable of
any task other than that of herdsman.
In the test of dire need, certain
nobles and freemen have shown their
true worth by sharing scarce water
and food between their children and
their "captives". But many, at the
point where sharing would have meant
certain death for themselves, have
preferred survival.

Life in the camp has brought with
it a mixing of all classes, and the
social hierarchy is tending to be re¬
versed. The markets in the towns
enable cobblers, blacksmiths and
jewellers to sell their wares more
profitably than in the camps. "Cap¬
tives", accustomed to heavy labour,
are better equipped than others to
render services to country or towns¬
folk In the settlement area.
Mutual help among families was a
normal practice in the Sahel; survival
depended on it and it was one of the
rules governing social relations.
At the Lazaret, 44 per cent of the
refugees say that no other family has
helped them in their everyday life,
while 47 per cent also say that they
do not help anyone. In fact, for half
the refugees the rule is now "every
man for himself".
To begin with, families now hide
a good many things from their neigh¬
bours, especially job possibilities,
meetings with people who may be able
to help them, or a little bit of extra
food they may have been able to
scrounge. Often, refugees hide under
a shelter or a tent to secretly eat food
a child or an adult has managed to beg.
A person or family suspected of
having anything more than the rations
distributed is immediately besieged by
relatives, servants or neighbours, who
sit around and demand a few scraps.
The main reason why social links
are broken is that people are no longer
in a position to fulfill their social and
economic obligations. Before the
drought, many heads of family gave
their protection and certain benefits in
exchange for work and respect. Now,
they have no flocks to look after and
they are incapable of protecting and
feeding their family and dependents.
There is no longer any basis for
respect, nor does it have any meaning.
This then is what seems to be
happening to Tuareg society. It has
been driven to disintegration, first by
defeat at the beginning of the century,
then by the introduction of a money-
based economy, and finally by drought
and famine.
Confederations, tribes, groups and
families have been broken up and only
a few vestiges of the old solidarity
remain. The dominant trend at the
present time is for everyone to try to
get by as best they can. Behaviour
born of famine continues to predomi¬
nate even though food supplies are
now reaching the refugees regularly.
As well as being biologically shat¬
tered, Tuareg society has also broken
down socially and culturally. Who is
going to write Tifinar, the alphabet of
Tamasheq, the Berber dialect spoken
by the Tuaregs, in future? And how
many children are going to live (if they
do survive) in a society where
Tamasheq will be understood?
Even so, this collapse is not total.
Some people seem to be showing a
determination to escape their situation ,
as persons dependent on aid. And
not all refugees have thrown their
traditional values overboard.
What is perhaps most important of
all is that the refugees should continue
to think of themselves as a human and
cultural entity not as a nation with
territorial claims.
What has happened In the Sahel has
not passed unnoticed in Africa or in
the world at large. The consequences
of the drought have undoubtedly been
brought home to a section of the élite
in the affected countries, leading them
to examine the human and economic
aspects of the disaster in depth and to
reappraise the policies applied in the
Sahel before the drought as well as
the way In which It was tackled.

Letters to the Editor
GYPSY LANGUAGE
AND CULTURE
Sir.
As a teacher at the first British Gypsy
Council Caravan School of 1967, I was
delighted to see the article by Arthur
R. Ivatts on the new horizons opened
by education for the Romany peoples
("Unesco Courier", November 1974),
illustrated by some of my friend Josef
Koudelka's marvellous photographs. It
is particularly good that the question
Is now being recognized as inter¬
national, and that the Rom and their
friends can reach out for a new under¬
standing across the barriers of national
frontiers.
The National Gypsy Education Council,
which is the national body In the United
Kingdom representing the views of
Gypsy parents and teachers, has been
saying since 1970 that "the Romany
culture is rich In tradition and can make
a positive contribution to the life and
work of any school."
I am slightly worried, however, that
the "Advisory Committee for the Edu¬
cation of Romanies and other Travellers",
the voluntary group with which Arthur
Ivatts is associated, remains so opposed
to any use of the Romany language In
education In Britain, and to the partici¬
pation of Gypsy parents In educational
policy formation.
Could not Unesco, as it has been
several times requested by national and
international organizations, assist in the
development on an International scale
of literature and materials for use in
Romany and Traveller Education, and do
something to encourage the blossoming
work of the novelists and poets who
have begun to appear among the new
educated strata of Romany society?

MAN AND THE BIOSPHERE
Paying high tribute to your magazine
in general, I should like to single out
the January 1973 issue devoted to the
preservation of the biosphere. I think
that your magazine should consistently,
Interestingly and scientifically deal with
these problems, to make everyone
understand that he or she and nature
are indivisible.
Metaphorically man is the most beauti¬
ful flower on earth, the most beauti¬
ful star In the sky, the most splendid
water in the ocean. You should make
upcoming generations feel the joy and
splendour of life In unity with nature,
by devoting as much space as possible
to the preservation of the biosphere.

UNIVERSAL STANDARDS
AND MEASUREMENTS
Sir.
Speaking at the General Assembly
of the International Standards Organ¬
ization (ISO) a few years ago, Mr. A.
Sundrahngham, scientific and technical
adviser on the U.N. Economic Com
mission for Africa (ECA), said that to
achieve a universal system of measure¬
ments ¡s a task of the highest priority,
in which ISO, U.N. and Unesco can
render invaluable assistance to the
developing nations.
The all-round Improvement of mer¬
chandise quality is a major problem
whose solution would In particular raise
the efficiency of production. Experience
has shown that standardization is an
effective Instrument of control over
merchandise quality. It is a catalyst of
industrial development and is called
upon to play a special role in the
developing countries.
During the past four years the
U.S.S.R. State Committee for Standards
has been holding, in Moscow, seminars
combined with practical training in
standards, metrology and merchandise
quality control. The seminars have been
attended by trainees on U.N. fellowships
from Asia, Africa, Latin America and
Europe. The classes are given by
experts from the U.S.S.R. Committee
for Standards. Some 80 persons
engineers, technicians, etc. from 26
countries have already taken the
course.
Trainees study methods and practice
of standardization in relation to output
quality control In certain industries and
in regard to ¡nterchangeability and the
fundamentals of metrology.
Practical training is carried out at
industrial plants and research centres,
at laboratories dealing with strength,
vibration, friction, wear and corrosion
and also at metrological laboratories
in many parts of the U.S.S.R.
In February 1972, speaking at a
seminar in Vienna for the directors of
such courses, Mr. Ibrahim Abdel
Rahman, Executive Director of the
United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), praised the activi¬
ties of the Moscow training course
and said that its work should be better
known.
Standardization training plays an
Important role in bringing peoples closer
together, as well as promoting industrial
development and economic progress.

A' MODERN ' GENIUS
OF THE RENAISSANCE
Sir,
Your special issue on the rediscovered
manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci
(October 1974) is an important contri¬
bution to our knowledge of the life and
work of the great Florentine artist,
whose versatile genius touched on every
aspect of human activity more than
500 years ago.
Leonardo imagined and drew mech¬
anisms which are still used today. Most
of his designs have found a practical
application in machines of many kinds,
and above all in motor vehicles. The
mechanisms and elaborate machines
drawn by Leonardo, such as brake
levers, connecting rods, pinions, cog
wheels, transmission systems, ball
bearings, dredgers and cranes would
have worked in his lifetime had a
sufficiently powerful motive force been
available.
But the most remarkable thing about
Leonardo Is his "modern" philosophical
approach. He seems more like a 20th-
century man than a man of the
Renaissance. His restlessly creative
mind ranged far beyond what was
possible In his own time, but posterity
has drawn on many of his Ideas and
given them practical form.

SAVING OUR SITES
AND MONUMENTS
Sir,
It Is always a pleasure to read in the
"Unesco Courier" articles on the world's
great treasures of art. One can ap¬
preciate your concern for the preser¬
vation of ancient monuments, as outlined
in your issue of December 1974, dealing
with the heritage of Nepal and the
15 cities around the world which are
launching major preservation operations.
In this context it would be interesting
to know what kind of solution has been
found to save the splendid ancient city
of Venice In Italy and how much
restoration has been completed already.
Thank you for the extremely valuable
work you are doing for the whole of
humanity and, in a personal context, for
giving me hours of reading pleasure.
Linda E. Spacek-Jung
New York, U.S.A.
Editor's note: The "Unesco Courier"
has published numerous articles on
the preservation of monuments in
Venice, particularly in its issues of
January 1967 and December 1968, the
latter being entirely devoted to this
subject.
THEY CALL US ' HANDICAPPED '
Sir.
Congratulations on your issue "They
Call us 'Handicapped'" (March 1974),
which makes stimulating reading.- It was
of particular Interest to me as editor of
"Mook-Dhwani", a publication of the All
India Federation of the Deaf.
I should like to publish in my magazine
some of the articles which appeared in
your issue. I wonder, too, whether you
know of an original article on noise
hazards in Industry and the deaf in
industry which I could use In a special
issue on "Industry Speaks"?
R.L. Bhat
New Delhi, India
Editor's note: The "Unesco Courier"
published a special issue dealing with
"Noise Pollution" (July 1967) including
the health hazards of excessive noise.
WINDOW ON THE WORLD
Sir,
I am a regular reader and enjoy your
magazine very much. Each new number
is, as you so rightly style it, a window
open on the worldl

Radio and TV
versus illiteracy
Educational broadcasters from 20 Arab
states met recently in Kuwait at a Unesco-
sponsored meeting to study the best ways
of using radio and TV in literacy and adult
education campaigns and how to fit edu¬
cational broadcasts Into current school
programmes. Similar regional meetings are
planned for Asia and Africa later this year,
and for Europe and Latin America in 1976.
Unesco mobile exhibits
on Oceanic art
Unesco travelling exhibitions on Oceanic
art will shortly be circulating In a number
of countries, as part of Unesco's programme
for the study of Oceanic cultures, launched
in 1971. Other recent activities in the
programme include recordings of music from
the Solomon Islands (in Unesco's anthology
of "Musical Sources") and a bibliography
on oral Oceanic traditions prepared by the
University of Auckland (New Zealand).
500,000 students
abroad every year
Some half a million students are studying
abroad every year, most of them on scholar¬
ships, grants and other forms of financial
aid. Unesco's best-seller, "Study Abroad"
which has just appeared in its 20th, com¬
pletely revised edition (see Inside back
cover) offers the world's most complete
listing of foreign studies, scholarships,
courses and general information for student
travellers. The majority of the world's
students abroad are in a dozen principal
"host countries": U.S.A. (140,000 foreign
students), France (35,000), Fed. Rep. of
Germany (34,000), Canada (31,000). U.K.
(27,000), Lebanon (21,000), Italy (18,000),
U.S.S.R. (17,000), Egypt (14,000), Argentina
(12,000), Japan (11.000), Spain (10,000),
Switzerland (10,000).
Cyclone-proof
paper houses
Houses built of paper and resin are best
suited to withstand cyclones according to
an Australian architect, Prof. Steven Winter.
He suggests the application of honeycomb-
type structures used in aircraft bodies to
withstand great pressure to produce vir¬
tually Indestructible houses. Paper, in- the
shape of accordion pleats, is coated with
resin, stretched out and heat moulded to
panels of gypsum, plyboard or other cheaply
available material. The technique has been
used in over 3,000 houses, hospitals and
factories at a cost far lower than for
conventional building.
$1,000,000 donation
from Saudi Arabia
for Unesco projects
in the Sahel
Saudi Arabia has donated $1,000,000
to finance Unesco aid projects in seven
Sahel countries: Chad, Gambia, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Upper
Volta. Following a decision by the late
King Fat'sal,$1,000,000 was presented on
March 28, 1975, to Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Director-General of Unesco, by
Mr. Hamad AI Khowaiter, Permanent
Delegate of Saudi Arabia to Unesco. The
money goes to Unesco's Funds-in-Trust
programme for the support of educational
activities in various countries outside
Unesco's regular budget.

Livestock and deforestation are two culprits
named. for current destruction of flora.
Flashes...
Grenada became Unesco's 136th Member
State on February 17, 1975.
The International Foundation for Scien¬
ce (IFS), recently established in Sweden,
will help developing countries to train their
own scientists and develop research,
through grants to enable young scientists
to undertake research projects in their own
countries.
Unesco-sponsored Book Development
Centres are being set up in 1975-1976 in
Cairo for the Arab States and Yaounde
(Cameroon) for Africa. Book Development
Centres will then exist in all the developing
regions.

LORDS OF THE DESERT
Beast of burden, provider of milk and wool for clothes
and tents, the camel has for 2,000 years been the pillar
of the desert economy for the nomads who roam
the Sahara and its borders. With its unique ability
to go without water for days or even months, the camel
can live where sheep and cattle would not survive.
Caravans of camels still wend their way along a vast
network of desert trading routes (see photo report,
pages 18 and 19.) Here, a nomad sits proudly astride
his camel in the Hoggar region of southern Algeria.
