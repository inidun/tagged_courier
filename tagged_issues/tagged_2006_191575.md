a shattered structure, most of its 
treasures having been plundered or 
wantonly destroyed. Across town at 
the Bakhtar National News Agency, 
journalists struggle with a solitary 
decrepit teleprinter to receive and 
send news. With a fledgling private 
press only now emerging, the coun-
try faces an information deficit on a 
grand scale.
 
The challenge 
of forging new nations
The Afghanistan situation is not 
unique. Wherever there is war, 
major civil unrest or new nations 
are being forged from the fires of 
conflict or political transition, there 
often exists a need to reconnect 
society, reconstruct the cultural 
fabric and tackle major issues, such 
as abject poverty, social depriva-
tion and violations of human rights. 
Cambodia had its own initiation in 
the early 1990s as it re-emerged 
from the horrors of a brutal past, 
while Timor Leste, a decade later, 
was born amid tumult and violence. 
Europe saw the depths of pain in 
the former Yugoslavia, and Africa 
has experienced the genocide of 
Rwanda and, now, the agony of 
Darfur. 
While international humanitarian 
relief and development agencies 
cannot, alone, solve societal and 
infrastructural problems which have 
been years in gestation, their im-
mediate presence in post-conflict 
situations can be crucial in assist-
ing local authorities and civil society 
in setting agendas, defining objec-
tives and goals, and encouraging 
democratic outcomes. In situations 
where ‘everything’ needs renova-
tion, prioritizing is complex. Expec-
tations by the long-suffering popu-
lace are high, while skilled human 
resources and immediately avail-
able aid funding are often limited. 
Ethnic and political fractures are 
A nation stays alive when its 
culture stays alive” reads 
a defiant banner hanging 
above the main entrance to Kabul’s 
National Museum.
Half a dozen UN four-wheel drive 
vehicles are lined-up ready to carry 
passengers the 50 kilometres to 
Kabul. I share a place with sev-
eral other new arrivals, including 
the incoming Minister of Women’s 
Affairs in the soon to be inaugurated 
administration of Hamid Karzai. She 
has not been back to Afghanistan in 
years, but her optimism and enthu-
siasm for the new-era in her country 
are infectious. Emotions overflow 
as we traverse a road littered with 
burnt-out military equipment, our 
car occasionally fording river cross-
ings to by-pass bridges destroyed 
in aerial bombing attacks. 
Winter’s shallow afternoon light 
casts Kabul’s streets as bleak and 
spare. Cyclists and donkey-drawn 
carts meander the thoroughfares, 
their riders, exhausted by years of 
conflict and harsh living conditions, 
peering expectantly at the newcom-
ers now flooding into their lives. 
In the days ahead, visits to key 
Governmental authorities and or-
ganizations tell their own story. An 
education system in chaos, where 
dusty shelves and cupboards in 
the central Ministry building are 
stacked with printed records of per-
sonnel and curricula which seem to 
match no reality. Schools lie in ru-
ins. Women, once the backbone 
of the teaching service, have been 
excluded from their duties for years 
and girls have had to rely on clan-
destine schooling. 
“A nation stays alive when its cul-
ture stays alive” reads a defiant 
banner hanging above the main en-
trance to Kabul’s National Museum. 
Once the repository of the arte-
facts and jewels of Afghanistan’s 
rich cultural civilization, it is now 
usually still apparent, while basic 
delivery mechanisms for develop-
ment programmes can be non-ex-
istent.
 
An important role 
for the International 
community
International intervention is not 
without its own problems. An influx 
of well-paid foreigners can impact 
hostilely on local economies, lifting 
the costs of basic food and ser-
vices to well beyond the reach of 
the general population. Inevitably, 
international agencies and NGOs 
source local employees from the 
already well-educated, urban elite, 
further exacerbating divisions 
between ‘haves and have nots’, 
while also draining skilled human 
resources from local enterprises. 
Without rapid and tangible change 
for the better, especially in general 
living conditions, tolerance by the 
citizenry to the presence of the 
global aid community can quickly 
turn to cynicism. 
Each post-conflict society is re-
sponsible for planning, shaping 
and re-building its own future. But it 
is also true that the global commu-
nity has an expectation that agen-
cies such as UNESCO will also be 
present as partners of goodwill and 
expertise in the renewal process. 
For development agencies, walk-
ing the fine-line between knowing 
when and how to act, and when 
to exit a post-conflict situation, is 
much like a de-mining expert facing 
the challenge of clearing another 
of Afghanistan’s minefields. Every 
step forward needs careful judge-
ment and consideration. However, 
although danger lurks, without 
those tentative steps there can be 
no successful outcome to the na-
tion-building task.

### 210790: Iraq: must cultural heritage be a casualty of war?

4The UNESCO Courier - December 2006
A
                            A symbolic target, cultural inheritance can be directly targeted during war
                       but more often than not, the most severe menace after a conflict 
                                             remains plundering.
Iraq
must cultural heritage  
be a casualty of war?
t times the destruction is delibe- 
rate. Think of the Buddhist statues 
in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, destroyed 
by the Taliban in 2001. Most often, 
though, it occurs as a target of oppor-
tunity, where criminal gangs, already 
involved in the lucrative international 
black market for antiquities, move in 
en masse in the absence of security. 
This was, and still is, the situation in 
southern Iraq where dozens of pre-
Islamic archaeological sites are be-
ing pillaged by looters searching 
for objects that can be sold, mostly 
tablets and statues from the UR III to 
mid-Babylonian periods. The looting, 
which began in the power vacuum 
that followed the 1991, accelerated 
rapidly just prior to, and immediately 
following, the 2003 conflict. 
But in these regions of ongoing in-
stability, amidst the general chaos 
Little funding 
for culture 
The entire budget 
for rebuilding 
the Iraqi National Museum 
and protecting the more than 
1700 archaeological sites 
was just $3MM; 
$1MM donated from 
the Packard Humanities Fund, 
$1MM from 
the US State Department 
and $1MM 
from Japan channeled 
through UNESCO.
and human suffering, is there any real 
hope for protecting cultural heritage?
The will to implement 
a solution
During three trips to Iraq between 
May 2003 and August 2004, I tried 
to find an answer to this question. 
To my surprise, I found that the 
problem of looting in Iraq could be 
addressed and the situation im-
proved relatively simply. 
The real test was not finding the 
solution, but finding the will to im-
plement it. 
To stop the looting in southern Iraq, 
partners had to be identified on the 
ground, and then properly supported. 
In May 2003, the necessary infra-
structure was already in place, both

Board of Antiquities and Heritage,

and in the provinces, where the sys-
tem of antiquities inspectors and ar-
chaeological site guards remained 
largely intact after the fall of Saddam. 
This fragile but functioning infra-
structure needed modest logistical 
support and funding. Abdul-Amir 
Hamdani, a courageous and dedicat-
ed Iraqi archaeologist and the local In-
spector for Antiquities in the Dhi Qar 
province, one of the most heavily loot-
ed in the south. 
Mr. Hamdani tried to patrol the hun-
dreds of sites in the province with a 
mere 150 trained guards and local 
police, who were not equipped for 
the task. They didn’t stand a chance 
against the well armed looters. 
In an increasingly dangerous post-
conflict Iraq, the archaeological 
guards needed guaranteed salaries, 
new equipment, communications 
equipment and most importantly 
greater numbers. An archaeologi-
cal site guard in Iraq is paid $100/
month, so for $2MM/year the State 
Board of Antiquities and Heritage 
could have hired 1000 equipped site 
guards, which could perhaps have 
sufficed to stop the looting through-
out southern Iraq. 
Non-profit organizations and NGOs, 
some with significant financial re-
sources earmarked for cultural pres-
ervation in Iraq, sat on the sidelines 
as the looting worsened. Some were 
stalled by the divisive and complex 
politics of the occupation itself, oth-
ers by a reluctance to fund projects 
that involved the possibility of armed 
engagement with looters. The latter 
touches on a fundamental dilemma; 
who should be responsible for po-
licing cultural heritage? While these 
questions were being debated, the 
looting continued.
What might have 
been…
One need look no further than the 
protection of Iraq’s oil to under-
stand what could have been done. 
A $30MM contract was provided 
to a security firm for a protection 
force to guard pipelines in the Dhi 
Qar province. Within one year, 
800 guards were hired and trained 
to guard the pipelines, which are 
located in close proximity to the 
archaeological sites. Outfitted with 
guns, trucks, radio equipment and 
air support from Coalition forces, 
the oil protection force boasted 
that they had not had one terror-
ist attack against the pipelines in 
their sector. Is it naïve to think that 
something similar could have been 
done for Iraq’s cultural treasures? 
Securing cultural history ulti-
mately requires three levels of 
planning; adequate protection of 
the heritage sites prior, during and 
post-conflict, addressing the basic 
economic interests in looting at a 
local level, and tackling the illegal 
trafficking in looted objects on the 
demand side. 
Cultural heritage is a finite re-
source that can disappear rapidly 
in conflict and post-conflict situ-
ations. Its protection following a 
conflict should be given the high-
est priority. 
As Winston Churchill famously 
said, “a nation that forgets its past 
has no future.” When nations col-
lapse, it is the moral responsibility 
of the international community to 
step in and protect the past for the 
sake of all our futures.

### 210791: Lebanon: the scars of war

LIbanon
the scars of war
                              continuing to live after the bombs and the trauma of war: 
                                   this is the challenge that confronts certain lebanese children. 
                           in this environment, game playing is the preferred means by which 
                                   to encourage children to express their suffering.
Fadi leaves the rubble of his house 
in the suburbs of Beruit, a box full 
of books in his arms. He’s going 
to live not far from there in the 
suburb of “Tarik Jadida” (the new 
road), with relatives. Already his 
school is too far away, so he will 
need to find a new one. He’s up-
set not to have found his drawing 
book amidst the ruins. 
Now in Cana, in the south of 
country. Souad’s black scarf re-
veals a round face and shy look. 
Souad is a survivor of the Cana 
massacre of 1996. Six years old at 
the time, she was seriously injured 
and burned. “I lost my mother and 
my five brothers and sisters. I’ve 
become accustomed to war, I’ve 
adapted. I’m no longer fearful. But 
when they bombed Cana for the 
second time in august 2006, I be-
gan to cry and to scream. It was as 
if I was reliving the first massacre. 
When I was little, I drew pictures 
to escape my fear, but since then 
I have left school and I no longer 
draw.”
A mirror of war
Fadi and Souad are two victims 
of war, traumatized forever by 
what they experienced. It is for 
them that, for the first time, aid 
programs have been implement-
ed in Lebanon. Game playing is 
the preferred means by which to 
bring them to express what they 
feel. Claire El Saïd, Bureau Chief 
for the International Movement of 
Apostolate of Children in Beirut, a 
Catholic organization that works 
in advisory capacity for UNICEF, 
says: “Children must play until 
they are tired. We are studying 
the violence that manifests itself 
in their games. Children are a mir-
ror of their surroundings.” 
The International Movement of 
Apostolate of Children is particu-
larly active in attempting to reduce 
the impact of media violence on 
children. “We must try to avoid 
the aftermath of war,” comments 
El Saïd. 
Secretary General of the Higher 
Counsel for Children (Ministry of 
Social Services), Elie Mikhail has 
coordinated her activities with 
those of humanitarian associa-
tions in order to implement a psy-
chological support programme. 
Programmes and activities have 
been rolled out to comfort chil-
dren and help them to adapt to 
a new reality. A mechanism has 
been put in place to detect trauma 
cases and put children in touch 
with psychologists. 
The Minister of Education and 
Higher Learning has also taken the 
issue on board. He has launched 
the training of 105 teachers in the 
Marjeyoun region. This seminar 
is based on providing emotional

support to children after the war. 
Moreover, the Education Minister 
has collaborated with UNESCO 
and UNICEF in the regions of 
Bint Jbeil, Nabatieh, Marjeyoun 
and Hasbaya in southern Leba-
non. Twenty-five public school 
teachers from public schools 
have participated in workshops 
organized by UNESCO’S office 
in Beirut. Their goal: help students 
to overcome the hardship of war 
with practical, artistic or theatrical 
activities, all while providing psy-
chological support.
Singing for peace
In parallel to extra curricular activi-
ties such as recreational camps 
on the weekend or excursions, 
drawing and singing activities are 
also taking place. The artist Ja-
hida Wehbeh thus chose a group 
of children to sing a song about 
peace with her. 
Line Jones, a consultant with the 
International Medical Corps (IMC) 
in the field of mental health, inter-
venes in the villages of the South. 
Using puppets, she teaches chil-
dren how to stay clear of bombs 
and gives them an opportunity to 
express what they may be repress-
ing. Upon arriving in Lebanon, 
she discovered that children in 
the South were prisoners of their 
own homes: recreational activities 
were generally taking place in ru-
ins reminding them of a childhood 
they were forced to give up. Some 
children were taking courses in 
tents. For this reason, she sug-
gested that the leaders of interna-
tional organizations build a centre 
that would provide children with 
a place to play and speak openly 
about their fears. This centre was 
built in the Khiyam area. 
Meanwhile, Claire El Saïd notes 
that this work would never have a 
significant effect if it consisted of 
short term activities. She hopes 
the Ministry of Education and 
specialized international organi-
zations will implement a minimum 
one-year action plan and have 
children in need undergo therapy 
even if they do not show any signs 
of distress.

M
                                     from schools to universities, the education system in iraq 
                             is suffering because students and professors alike fear for their safety.
Iraq
when school isn’t a safe place anymore
y friend Tariq first alerts me to 
the problem. His niece, he says, 
is angry because her parents 
want her to change her school to 
somewhere closer to their home. 
The journey, they fear, is too far 
in these dangerous times when 
teenage girls face the risk of kid-
napping, when militias roam the 
streets imposing their own laws 
and when the bombers are at-
tacking even ‘safe’ areas. He 
mentions, almost as an aside, that 
the schools are emptying of both 
pupils and teachers. 
In the way of these things, the 
conversation widens. My transla-
tor tells a similar story as does 
one of my guards. It is not just the 
schools it turns out. Throughout 
Iraq, the entire educational system 
is being hollowed out by violence. 
Professors and students say they 
no longer feel safe in their universi-
ties, that they are confronted with 
murder and intimidation. It has 
become so bad that in the worst-
affected areas, up to half the staff 
and students have left. 
As the new academic term gets 
underway, it is becoming apparent 
that education in Iraq is facing an 
unprecedented crisis.
A bleak picture
Universities from Basra in the south 
to Kirkuk and Mosul in the north 
have been infiltrated by militia or-
ganisations. “Militias from all sides 
are in the universities,” says a po-
litical science lecturer at Baghdad 
University. “Classes are not hap-
pening because of the chaos, and 
colleagues are fleeing if they can.” 
“The situation is becoming com-
pletely unbearable’” he continues.

“A large number have simply left 
the country, while others have 
applied to go on prolonged sick 
leave. We are using MA and PhD 
students to fill in the gaps.” 
“What has been happening with 
the murders of professors involved 
in the sciences is that a lot of those 
involved in medicine, biology, 
maths have fled,” says another 
professor who teaches politics in 
Baghdad. “The people who have 
got the money are sending their 
children abroad to study. A lot - my 
daughter is one of them - are de-
ciding to finish their higher educa-
tion in Egypt.” 
The same militias regularly in-
timidate female students and pro-
fessors. Almost two years ago, 
a group of women professors at 
Basra University complained to 
me of being intimidated by groups

of young men allied to the militias, 
who had bullied and threatened 
students not wearing the veil, and 
intimidated those they thought 
were taking unsuitable classes. 
Since then, this phenomenon has 
spread throughout the country.
No place is safe
But it is the security situation—and 
not just in Banghdad—that is having 
the biggest impact on education. In 
Mosul, too, professors complain of 
a system now approaching utter 
disarray. 
Mohammed U, a 60-year-old 
science professor, spoke after 
returning from the funeral of a 
colleague, the head of the law fac-
ulty, who died in an explosion. 
“Education here is a complete 
shambles. Professors are leav-
ing, and the situation - the closed 
roads and bridges - means that 
both students and teachers find it 
difficult to get in for classes,” Mo-
hammed says. “Students are really 
struggling. To get them through at 
all, we have had to lower academ-
ic levels. We have to go easy on 
them. The whole system is becom-
ing rapidly degraded.” 
The situation is reflected in many 
of Iraq’s schools. “Education in my

area is collapsing,” said a teacher 
from a high school in Amariya, 
who quit four months ago just be-
fore two of her colleagues were 
murdered. “Children can’t get to 
school because of road blocks. 
The parents of others have simply 
withdrawn them from the school 
because of the fear of kidnapping.” 
“If children have to travel by car, 
they are less likely to come,” she 
says. “When I left, we had 50% 
attendance. We see parents 
when they come in to ask for the 
children to have a ‘vacation’, and 
they admit they are too scared to 
let them attend.” 
The situation is hardest of all on 
young Iraqis, most of whom are 
desperate for an education. One 
high school student from Zafara-
niya that I spoke to had hoped to 
go to university this year. But her 
college is in Adhamiya, a neigh-
bourhood notorious for violence, 
so she has been forced to ask 
for a deferral. “The journey is too 
long and too unsafe. I don’t know 
whether I will be going to college 
or stay jailed at home.”

Recently, Iraq’s government has 
been making efforts to rehabilitate 
and reform the three main pillars 
of education--students, teachers 
and curricula. 
The government has announced 
that it will increase the total 
education budget by 600% 
in order to implement more 
projects that serve the sector. 
For example, international trainers 
have been running workshops for 
teachers, and a country-wide 
curriculum review process is 
currently underway in preparation 
for a curriculum reform. 
In addition, the government has 
raised teachers’ salaries by up to 
200 thousand Iraqi Dinars (about 
$135) per month and added 
monthly incentives that range 
between 30 - 50 thousand Iraqi 
Dinars (about $20-35). The Minis-
try of Education is also providing 
teachers with parcels of land as 
well as loans for the purchase 
of private vehicles that may be 
paid back over a period of three 
years. UNESCO and other 
international organizations have 
also played a role in implement-
ing emergency and humanitarian 
programmes that provide Iraqi 
students with decent facilities, 
textbooks and educational 
opportunities.

iraq’s education system was once among the best 
in the Arab world, with compulsory and free elementary 
education, high enrolment rates, and one of the highest literacy 
rates in the region. unfortunately, the education system 
suffered over the past few decades due to wars 
and economic sanctions.

succeeded in Rwanda, twelve years 
after the genocide which took near-
ly 800,000 victims, or 10% of the 
country’s population, from the Great 
Lakes region. 
Her case is far from isolated. Even 
if the majority of the Rwandan popu-
lation has not taken the step, a true 
revolution has taken place in the 
country over the last ten years. The 
civil war that rocked the country in 
1994, marked a social turning point, 
supported by a demographic reality: 
following the genocide, 70% of the 
population was made up of women. 
United within associations, these 
women took in children that were 
orphaned by the conflict, rallied in 
numbers to defend human rights, 
made headway against illiteracy 
and promoted microcredit.
But women are also present in 
more unexpected fields. It is not un-
heard of to see a woman on a con-
struction site, at a bank counter or 
at the wheel of a taxi. They’ve come 
a long way when we know that not 
so long ago, the legislative system 
was largely discriminatory. 
On construction sites 
or at the wheel of taxis
For example: a woman could not 
inherit goods from her parents nor 
her husband, while the contrary 
was possible. 
It has to be said that women paid 
a high price during the genocide. 
According to estimates, between 
250,000 to 500,000 were victims 
of sexual violence (Source: United 
Nations). Studies conducted on 
women who had been raped during 
the genocide revealed that two thirds 
had been infected with HIV and 
AIDS or other sexually transmitted

### 210793: Rwanda: when women set the example

diseases and 80% were “seriously 
traumatized”. Moreover, it is estimated 
that 50% lost their husbands during 
the conflict. Numerous other women, 
whose husbands found refuge in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo in 
1994, found themselves heads of 
family from one day to the next.
Rwanda, model of 
equality
Stuck hard by the genocide, women 
have not only played an integral 
role in the physical reconstruction, 
but also in the painful national rec-
onciliation process. It is true that 
far fewer women were implicated 
directly in the massacres: they rep-
resent 5% of people imprisoned 
after the genocide. 
These changes have been also 
translated into the country’s institu-
tions. The new constitution adopted 
in 2003 foresees that 30% of ad-
ministrative positions or those with-
in government bodies, are reserved 
for women. Following the October 
2004 elections, women occupied 
48.8% of seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies. In comparison, women 
occupied 45% of seats within the 
Swedish national parliament, long 
time considered a model for wom-
en’s equality. 
“This change is significant, but the 
path remains long to attain equal-
ity between the two sexes at all 
levels of political and economic 
decision-making,” says Espérance 
Murorunkwere. Meanwhile, Déogra-
tias Kayumba, Vice-President of 
the National Consultative Commis-
sion of Human Rights (NCCHR) 
hails the important breakthrough in 
this area. But he also laments that 
many Rwandans remain at the bot-
tom of the social ladder. In other 
areas, battles such as the decrimi-
nalization of abortion still remain to 
be fought. 
It should be noted that in the long 
run, the disappearance of numer-
ous women infected by HIV and 
AIDS compromises the work of 
emancipation undertaken by the 
survivors of genocide.

### 210794: Post-conflict situations can be worse than the conflicts themselves

12The UNESCO Courier - December 2006
                                      guy Debonnet, a programme specialist 
                  in charge of natural heritage at unesco’s world heritage centre, 
                             speaks about the danger facing wildlife.
Post-confLIct sItuatIons 
can be worse than 
the confLIcts themseLves 
What is the impact of conflict 
situations on wild life? 
Wild life is particularly exposed in 
developing countries during a pe-
riod of conflict because that’s when 
the usual protective structures dis-
integrate. Furthermore, the armed 
forces present are often poorly re-
munerated, or not at all. So they have 
to find their own means of subsis-
tence. That was the case in Ethiopia, 
Sudan and also in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC). 
In this context, poaching is a means 
of earning money. In addition, ani-
mals provide natural game that’s 
available. Thus, during the conflict 
that raged in DRC from 1996 on, 
the elephant population living in 
the heritage sites was decimated. 
This is an animal that is particu-
larly exposed because it provides 
not only meat but also tusks with 
a high market value. 
The white rhinoceros also suf-
fered the consequences of this 
conflict. According to the most re-
cent estimates, there are only four 
individuals left. If these figures are 
accurate, the species could die out 
definitively in the very near future. 
The paradox is that post-conflict 
situations can turn out to be even 
worse because armed groups 
are idle, often. That’s when they 
become uncontrollable because 
they still have their weapons and 
no one has any power over them 
any more.

### 210794: Post-conflict situations can be worse than the conflicts themselves

13The UNESCO Courier - December 2006
When a country is completely 
disorganized by war, are there 
measures that can be taken 
to protect certain species?
Animal protection operations can 
be supported, as we did in heri-
tage sites in the DRC, by making it 
possible for monitoring activities to 
continue. In that country, UNESCO 
took charge of paying the salaries of 
park rangers in the five World Heri-
tage sites from 2000 to 2004. 
This work paid off, because
the population of mountain 
gorillas not only didn’t drop, 
it grew slightly during 
the conflict. 
We also had good trans-border 
cooperation with some of the 
neighbouring states, even those 
who were involved in the con-
flict, like Uganda. The experience 
showed that if we limit the dam-
age, it’s possible for populations 
to reconstitute themselves. It takes 
time, but it is possible and it also 
benefits the human populations in 
the area. It’s a fact that if the park 
rangers are able to keep armed 
groups away from protected spe-
cies, it also guarantees the villag-
ers a certain security. Don’t forget 
that the poachers are also those 
who loot villages. 
In the RDC, the World Heritage 
Convention allowed us to play 
a key role in inciting warlords to 
respect the conservation areas. 
Once peace is restored, the spe-
cies can start multiplying again. 
On the other hand, when the 
populations are weakened and re-
duced, as was the case with the 
rhinoceros in Garamba National 
Park, poaching can endanger 
species and it’s very difficult after 
to reconstitute them. 
That’s why we should think about 
finding an equivalent for natural 
heritage to the Hague Convention 
for the protection of cultural pro- 
perty in the event of armed conflict.
Can biodiversity really 
be a priority during in a conflict 
or immediate post-conflict 
situation?
The problem is that the harm done 
to biodiversity is not very visible. 
The rhinoceros becoming increas-
ingly rare is much less dramatic 
than the destruction of a monu-
ment like the Bamian Buddhas. 
And too often fatalism prevails 
when it comes to biodiversity, as if 
any action would be in vain. 
On the contrary, it’s crucial to 
bring up the subject during and af-
ter the conflict because we’re talk-
ing about a common good for hu-
manity. The work we accomplished 
in the DRC proves that action is 
possible. 
We must also understand that 
it’s in the interest of local popula-
tions – first, because it represents 
a factor of food supply security. 
And second, because it can mean 
a source of income for the country 
once the war is over. 
In Rwanda, for instance, green 
tourism – motivated mainly by the 
presence of gorillas in the coun-
try – is today the second largest 
source of foreign currency after 
coffee and tea.

chronologie
born in the ashes of war, unesco embarked on the task 
of reconstruction right from its very first programmes. sixty years hence, 
it continues to bring succour to those recovering 
from conflicts or natural disasters. some highlights.
1946  
The first session of the General 
Conference sets up an information 
centre to collate data on assistance 
needs of countries devastated 
by the Second World War. 
It also establishes a programme 
of education for internationalunder-
standing. 
1947 
The Temporary International Council 
for Educational Reconstruction starts 
to mobilize and coordinate efforts 
from the private sector, comprising 
30 international and 700 national 
organizations. 
1948 
The first volume of Study Abroad 
is published, detailing thousands 
of opportunities for fellowships 
and exchanges. Some 180 students 
receive grants within 
the reconstruction programme. 
1950 
UNESCO heads the education 
department of the UN Relief and 
Works Agency, launching a school 
programme for Palestinian refugee 
children in the Near East. 
Four decades later, 400,000 pupils 
will have been taught by 11,000 
teachers in 640 schools. 
1954 
Representatives of 50 countries 
adopt the Convention for the 
Protection of Cultural Property 
in the Event of Armed Conflict 
in The Hague (Netherlands). 
1955 
The UN Korean Reconstruction 
Agency and UNESCO intensify 
rebuilding efforts, inaugurating 
a printing press able to supply 
20 million textbooks a year. 
1961
A daring programme to reform 
education in the former Belgian 
Congo (now the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo), recruits over 
100 specialists and 800 teachers 
to replace those who have left the 
country. 
2002 
The minaret of Jam is the first site 
in Afghanistan to be placed 
in the World Heritage List. 
Aside from cultural preservation, 
UNESCO has ongoing projects 
in education and communications 
across the country. 
2003 
Rwanda is the first subject 
of a series of publications 
on current efforts to restore 
and transform education systems 
in post-conflict countries. 
Among others to follow: 
Kosovo, Palestine, Timor-Leste. 
2004
The reconstructed Old Bridge 
of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), 
destroyed in the 1993 conflict, 
is inaugurated in July, thus 
concluding a UNESCO 
international fund-raising campaign. 
Two years later, it is inscribed 
in the World Heritage List. 
2005  
A massive tsunami sweeps 
through countries bordering 
the Indian Ocean. UNESCO 
proposes putting in place 
a warning system similar 
to that already 
existing in the Pacific. 
2006 
UNESCO responds 
to Lebanon’s post-conflict 
ecovery and reconstruction, 
focusingon education, 
culture and communication.

the training of school and university 
administrators and managers 
in post-apartheid Africa. 
1993 
The Programme for Education

The Teacher Emergency Package 
(TEP), a kit containing basic 
classroom materials for teachers 
and children, is tested for 
the first time on a nationwide 
scale in Rwanda. 
1996 
UNESCO is designated as lead 
agency for assistance to independent 
media during the period of 
reconstruction in the former 
Yugoslavia. UNESCO will later 
lead aid efforts in Afghanistan, 
the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and Iraq. 
2000 
The World Education Forum in Dakar 
(Senegal) adopts an action frame-
