'Choker' for a Celtic princess
(Fed. Rep. of Germany)
Celtic culture flourished in Europe and attained the zenith of its artistic achievements
during the " La Tène " period (5th century B.C. to 50 B.C.). The " La Tène " culture takes its
name from the now famous archaeological site at the eastern end of Lake Neuchâtel, in
Switzerland. "La Tène" period sites have been excavated in many parts of Europe. From
one, a Celtic tomb discovered at Reinheim (Fed. Rep. of Germany) in 1954, came jewellery
of rare beauty dating from the 4th century B.C. One outstanding find was a torque, or
ornamental open collar, of solid gold (right) fashioned for a Celtic noblewoman, possibly
a princess. Above, greatly enlarged detail of one of the twin decorative motifs at the open
ends of the collar reveals the masterly handiwork of a Celtic craftsman.

Cover
The Touaregs, the "people of the veil"
who roam the Sahara, depend for their
existence upon oases and waterholes
scattered across the desert. Yet
below the sandy wastes lies a vast
underground reservoir extending over
a quarter of a million square miles.
In co-operation with the governments
of Algeria and Tunisia, Unesco is
surveying the underground water
resources of the northern Sahara
(see pages 9 and 10). Water has
become a world problem of crucial
importance for everyone. Within the
framework of the International
Hydrological Decade sponsored by
Unesco, the community of nations Is now
facing the water problem on a scale
never before attempted (see page 4).

Man's
perpetual quest
for water
o
S

INCE the dawn of civiliza¬
tion, population growth and the expan¬
sion of human activities have depend¬
ed on man's ability to surmount the
natural restrictions of his environment,
including the amount and distribution
of water.
Water development and water poli¬
cies always have been Important, as
is evident from the many measures
taken to control its distribution and
use, beginning with the ancient Sum-
erians of Mesopotamia and becom¬
ing ever more complex with the pas¬
sage of time.
Even so, water problems are becom¬
ing Increasingly critical in many re¬
gions, including areas In developed
countries where water is relatively
abundant. The reason is that in many
regions problems are less apt to
relate to water quantity than to Its
quality.
Broadly stated, water problems are
few but basic: distribution in space
RAYMOND L. NACE, former chairman of the
U.S. National Committee for the International
Hydrological Decade, has served as U.S.
representative on the Co-ordinating Council
of the Decade. Dr Nace is research hydrolo-
gist with the Water Resources Division of the
U.S. Geological Survey, and in the U.S.A.
has worked on problems of general hydro¬
logy and on the disposal of radioactive waste.
We are now at mid-point in the International Hydrological Decade, spon¬
sored by Unesco. Since January 1, 1965 this vast programme has mobil¬
ized hydrologists the world over for man's first concerted attempt to
take stock of his diminishing fresh water resources and to co-ordinate
world-wide research on better ways of making use of them. Here,
Dr. Raymond L. Nace, the noted American hydrologist, examines the
historical and scientific background of the problem, and describes some
major areas where this international co-operation has been in action.
(too much or too little); distribution in
time (too much in some seasons or
years and not enough in others); che¬
mical quality (too highly mineralized;
lacking in desirable minerals; contain¬
ing deleterious minerals); and pollution.
Well-intentioned individuals speak
confidently of surmounting all prob¬
lems by achieving mastery of the
environment. This is an Illusory goal.
Man first must master himself. The
plain fact is that he has not done so,
and because of this he has so com¬
pletely upset the natural environmen¬
tal system in which he evolved, that
he no longer knows what his place is
in the system except as an element
of disorder.
We do know that water has a vital
role in every earth environment from
the depths of the sea to the highest
mountain; from the driest desert to
the wettest rain forest; and from the
tropics to the polar ice-caps. It also
has a role in every activity of man and
beast.
Thus far, our attempts at "mastery
of the environment" have been mere
short-sighted tinkerings with the land¬
scape. Meanwhile, other human act¬
ivity has brought on unwanted, unfore¬
seen, and poorly understood side
effects.
Human activity already has con¬
taminated the entire world ocean, the
atmosphere, and even the remote ice
caps of Greenland and Antarctica.
Most rivers are polluted to some
extent and many are nauseous open
sewers. Plant cover and soil fertility
of vast areas have been destroyed.
Parts of the story of human despo¬
liation of the earth have been told
CONTINUED NEXT PAGE
Even in countries where rainfall is
abundant there may be a lack of the
right kind of water where it is most
needed, especially in the large cities of
the world. To overcome this problem
river water is re-cycled and re-used
many times. Thus, before being
returned to the rivers, water from the
sewers of large towns goes through a
treatment process. It passes through
aeration tanks which supply the
oxygen needed by the micro-organisms
that break down and destroy harmful
organic matter. Here, at a sewage
treatment plant in the Paris area, treated
water is piped into the Seine. It will
probably be extracted, purified and
used again several times before finding
its way to the sea.

many times. But the whole story can¬
not be told because not all of it is
known and the story has not yet ended.
The problem Is not mastery of the
environment. The problem is whether
nature can be preserved in some sem¬
blance of order and whether civiliza¬
tion can survive its own impact on
nature.
The facts of history vis-à-vis the
plight of most of mankind today are
sufficient evidence that the problems
of man and his environment are not
problems of the men of individual
nations. They are problems of all men
and all nations.
This is especially true of water. The
mobility of water is one of its most
useful properties, but it also gives rise
to serious problems, both practical
and scientific, international as well as
national.
IRRIGATION IN ANTIQUITY. Over
the past 7,000 years men at some
time and place have been trying to
increase the supply of fresh water,
or at least to increase the share used
before its inevitable return to the sea.
Ancient man, like modern man,
evidently loved sunshine and dry
warm weather. But in order to prosper
and multiply in dry areas, a change
was needed more profound than the
transition from nomadic hunting and
herding to sedentary farming. Crop
farming without irrigation is precarious
to impossible in dry areas.
Extensive irrigation, however, re¬
quires community effort for water
diversion, maintenance of works, and
allocation of water, and these can be
achieved only through effective social
and political organization. Civilization
may have been a result of man's
unwillingness to accept the limitations
of geography and his search for means
to circumvent these limitations.
Following the ice age, climatic con¬
ditions identical in all essential aspects
with those that prevail now were estab¬
lished at least 5,000 years ago and
perhaps 8,000. The Near East and
Middle East already were arid to semi-
arid, and it was there that the early
civilizations arose. This was no mere
coincidence, for the reason noted
above. Climate determined the locale
for the rise of civilization.
Looking at the long history of water
management, it is surprising that the
water cycle has been a mystery to man
during most of his history. Sumerian
knowledge about hydrology is proble¬
matical. Writers of their cuneiform
inscriptions were concerned with milit
ary exploits and practical matters,
rather than with intellectual adventures.
The people, however must have had
extensive practical understanding of
running water, else they could not have
operated a large and complicated irri¬
gation system on the Mesopotamian
plain. They had such a system at least
as early as 4 000 B.C., and perhaps
much earlier. They and their succes¬
sors held sway over a region of
about 20,000 square kilometres, and
much of this was irrigated, though not
all at the same time. The Sumerian
irrigation system was a marvel, not
only because of its size but also
because of its long existence.
Salinity and siltatlon plagued the
irrigated fields in varying degrees from
very early times, but the Sumerians
learned to some extent to cope with
the problems. So did their Semitic
successors, and irrigation continued
until the middle of the twelfth century.
Hulagu Khan's invasion in the thir¬
teenth century has been blamed for
devastating Mesopotamia, but the area
had been essentially abandoned a
hundred years earlier.
Judging from experience with modern
irrigation methods, it is doubtful that
any modern system will last for a
length of time even approaching that
of Mesopotamia. In the vast and fer¬
tile Indus Plain of West Pakistan live
more than 30 million people. An enor¬
mous irrigation network supplies about
9 million hectares of land (90,000 square
kilometres). More than 2 million hec¬
tares already have been lost by salin¬
ity and waterlogging, and current
annual losses are about 40,000 hec¬
tares.
The Indus Plain is only one example
of irrigation problems. Dry areas
naturally tend to have salty soil and
ground water because not enough
water moves through the local water
cycle to flush salts away. Successful
irrigation requires application of suffi¬
cient water for flushing and sufficient
movement of ground water or drainage
water to actually remove the salts from
the irrigated area. Where drainage is
inadequate, waterlogging aggravates
the problem. Many tens of thousands
of hectares annually are lost to pro¬
duction by salinity and waterlogging,
principally in Asia, Africa and North
America.
Organized large scale irrigation agri¬
culture arose in the Nile Valley around
3400 B.C., following an antecedent
period of small scale local develop¬
ments. For a variety of reasons, the
problem of irrigation there was far
simpler than in Mesopotamia. Simple
flood-basin irrigation practice was
followed, first on the left bank only.
Later, when basining spread to the
right bank also, constriction of the river
by both banks raised serious problems
during high floods.
During the twelfth Dynasty a brilliant
plan evolved to mitigate this problem
the Fayum project. This project used
the Fayum depression as an off-stream
reservoir into which excess waters
were diverted, forming Lake Moeris in
the desert 50 miles south-west of Cairo.
During years of deficient flood water,
stored lake water was led back to the
valley.
The Egyptian irrigation system was
unique. The irrigation basins were
lavishly flooded, but only once each
year. Sand and gravel beneath the
valley soil provided good subsurface
drainage. There was no need for irri¬
gation canals or drainage ditches, and
no general problem arose of salinity
or waterlogging of soils. The annual
deposit of silt obviated the need for
fertilizer. It will be interesting to
observe the future of the Nile Valley
with a modern irrigation system, includ¬
ing a large up-stream reservoir where
much of the sediment will settle out of
the impounded water.
FLOOD PLAINS AND CITIES. Mod¬
ern peoples are not the first to build
cities on river flood plains. Mohenjo
Daro and Harappa, the archaeologically
famous cities of a civilization that
flourished on the Indus Plain during
2500-1500 B.C., got into trouble be¬
cause the people did not understand
or could not cope with the interactions
of land, water, vegetation and man in
a flood-plain environment.
The civilization deteriorated during a
long period before it finally dis¬
appeared. A common supposition has
been that the Harappan culture was
based on irrigation agriculture and that
it was defeated by soil salinization.
However, some authorities say that
evidence is lacking of any irrigation
structures in Harappan times.
A recent theory is that the Harappan
towns were destroyed by repeated
flooding. Massive masonry walls
around Mahenjo-Daro failed to protect
it and it was engulfed and filled with
silt. The nature of these floods was
unusual.
A flood plain is exactly what its
name implies a land form built by the
river during flood flows. A river is in
flood when it overtops the banks of its
channel. Overtopping is a normal
recurrent event with most rivers, and
minor flooding occurs every two or
three years. Higher floods are less
frequent. Indus floods In Harappan
times, however, seem to have been
different in nature.
According to one Interpretation,

interposed an obstruction on the Indus
River down stream from Mohenjo-Daro,
impounding a lake which engulfed the
town with water and silt. After the
lake's outlet eroded the obstruction and
drained the lake, the people returned
and built anew on top of the old
masonry. This happened at least five
times. A mound at the site contains
artifacts to a depth of 22.6 metres,
7.3 of which are below the present
water table and can be probed only by
core drilling.
The evidence proves that the town
was engulfed by silt and water, but
whether by a lake or by flood water
remains undetermined. The Indus Plain
Is very flat and a high flood would
have many of the characteristics of a
lake. At any rate, Mohenjo-Daro is an
ancient example of a problem that has
assumed major proportions in modern
times.
Human encroachment on flood plains
leads to ever-increasing damage to
property and, in some cases, to loss
of life. Modern man has not solved this
problem either, because large floods
cannot be controlled. They can only
be combated.
Other ancient irrigation and public
water works, as in Iran and China, are
equally interesting, but the examples
discussed illustrate that during many
centuries before classical Grecian civi¬
lization arose, men had a great deal of.
practical understanding of water and
how to manage it. They had invented
the principal types of water control
structures: diversion dams, storage
dams, sluices, canals and drainage
ditches; they used canals for irriga¬
tion, city water supply and navigation.
Their knowledge was largely or
wholly empirical, but it was immensely
useful. Ancient people learned also to
tap sources of ground water and to
promote groundwater recharge, but
the degree of antiquity of this know¬
ledge remains uncertain.
Ancient people also encountered the
same problems that beset us today:
maintenance of canals and drainage
ditches; necessity for dredging and
disposition of the spoil; public water
supply; navigation; flood-fighting ; pol¬
lution.
GREEK HYDROLOGY. Aside from
practical problems of water control, the
earliest coherent thinking about water
as a substance and about the water
cycle as a whole seems to have
occurred in classical Greece. The
Greek natural philosophers were intel¬
lectually methodical. They sought
rational causes for effects, rather than
invoking the caprices of gods as basic
causes.
Although mythology strongly in¬
fluenced their thinking, in principle they
rejected myths, substituted rational
deductions, and tried to reduce many
facts to a few principles. Commonly
they were wrong but, right or wrong,
they were generally logical.
The first of the natural philosophers
was Thaïes of Miletos (6407-546 B.C.).
Knowing the ubiquity of water in the
sea, on land, underground and in the
air, Thaïes supposed that all substan¬
ces originally came from water and
eventually would revert to that form.
This may have been man's first
attempt to reduce the bewildering
diversity of matter to a common deno¬
minator. Thaïes believed that rivers are
fed by the sea and that wind forces
water into the earth. Once inside, the
weight of overlying rocks forces the
water upward into the mountains, from
which it spills out to form rivers.
After Thaïes, the philosophers contri¬
buted little to ideas about water until
the time of Anaxagoras of Clazomene
(500-428 B.C.), a highly original thinker
who rejected the Milesian Idea of a
primordial element. He believed that
no transformations of matter could
occur and that all substances had
existed from eternity.
Anaxagoras formed a basically cor¬
rect concept of the gross hydrological
cycle: the sun raises water from the
sea into the atmosphere, from which
it falls as rain. Rain-water gathers in
underground reservoirs from which the
rivers flow. The earth generates no
new water, but the reservoirs fill during
the rainy season. Perennial streams
flow from large reservoirs and ephe¬
meral streams from small ones.
Democritus taught that the properties
of substances depend on the shapes
of their atoms. Water, for example,
might be composed of smooth spheres,
which would explain why it flows so
readily.
Plato (428 or 427-348 B.C.) led a
great advance in Greek thinking. He
assumed that the universe was created
by an organizing mind and that the
universe, therefore, is understandable.
The core of Plato's water cycle, how¬
ever, was mythical Tartarus. He sup-

PERPETUAL QUEST FOR WATER
(Continued)
posed that a series of interconnecting
subterranean channels communicate
with their source, the vast reservoir of
Tartarus. Perpetual surging to and fro
of waters in the subterranean reservoir
causes the flow of springs and rivers.
All water of rivers and seas returns
eventually to Tartarus.
Aristotle of Stagira (384-322 B.C.),
pupil of Plato and tutor to Alexander,
the son of Philip of Macedonia, carried
his thinking far beyond that of his men¬
tor. His vast and omnivorous Intellect
ranged the entire scope of human
knowledge and philosophy and, inevi¬
tably, included the water cycle.
Peremptorily, Aristotle rejected the
ideas of Anaxagoras about the water
cycle and Plato's Tartarus. He recog¬
nized that some springs are fed by
meteoric water, but he believed that
the main flow of water originates in
great underground caverns where
coldness transforms air Into water. He
differed with Anaxagoras also on the
explanation of meteorological pheno¬
mena, such as hail storms.
Aristotle could not conceive that rain
was any but a minor source of water
for rivers and springs. He said that
sea water turned into air under the
heat of the sun, and that air turned
back into water (condensed) In cav¬
erns under the Influence of cold.
It happens that Anaxagoras came
closer than Aristotle to explanations
that are now generally accepted.
Aristotle, however, marshalled more
observational information than had
Anaxagoras and some of these facts
conflicted with the latter's beliefs.
Aristotle's argument, therefore, was
the more compelling and it was not
successfully challenged for nearly
2,000 years.
**
FROM IMPERIAL ROME TO THE
RENAISSANCE. Before the Romans
came under the intellectual Influence of
Greece they had learned much from
the Etruscans, who were masters in
the arts of irrigation and swamp drai¬
nage. This heritage enabled Rome to
have a well-developed sewerage sys¬
tem as early as the sixth century B.C.
Romans, in general, accepted the
science of Greece and added little to
basic concepts. Their great forte was
engineering, as is evident from the
aqueducts, bridges and other struc¬
tures which still endure.
Roman engineers also invented
delivery of domestic water through
pipes to households. Curiously, they
were quite unable to measure the flow
of water in a conduit. They assumed
that flow from a conduit depends only
on the size of the orifice, ignoring the
factor of hydraulic head.
During the Dark and Middle Ages
many fanciful notions were current
about the water cycle. One of these
ideas, an elaborated inheritance from
Greece, was that ocean water pours
into submarine caverns which conduct
it to the land areas, where it Is distilled

The pancakes are tiny "oases" of palm trees made to grow by tapping zones of underground water in the Souf
region of the northern Algerian Sahara. The village can be seen at centre right of photo. The palm saplings
are planted in man-made hollows 20 to 40 feet deep (see detail next page) with palisades built to protect
them from the driving sand. It is in this region of Algeria as well as in Tunisia that Unesco is now carrying

of the U.N. Development Programme. "Regional 100" is a survey of underground water resources in the northern
Sahara and a study of the best ways of exploiting such water for future farm development. South
of the Sahara another major hydrological study is under way in the Chad Basin which constitutes
a vast reservoir of underground water. Four countries Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria have formed
a commission to plan the development of the Basin, an area of 400,000 square kilometres. Under a
U.N. Development Programme project, Unesco, co-operating with the Chad Basin Commission, is making
a general hydrological survey of the region, while FAO is studying problems of land reclamation.

and rises to the surface to feed springs
and rivers. The medievalists were
correct in that the sea is the source
of water in the hydrological cycle, but
they had the cycle turning in the wrong
direction and they called upon the
wrong distillation apparatus.
Such ideas persisted because men
accepted the Greeks, especially Aris¬
totle, as final authorities, and because
of church dogma concerning a passage
in Ecclesiastes which was interpreted
to mean that continental waters origi¬
nate by underground flow from the
sea. To believe otherwise was heresy.
Neither the natural philosophers nor
the churchmen could accept precipita¬
tion as a sufficient source for water in
the land areas.
Hydrology, like other sciences and
the arts, was bound eventually to break
with dogmatism and authoritarianism.
The break came in a curious way. The
French Huguenot, Bernard Palissy
(15147-1590), was a self-taught cera¬
mist who created the naturalistic mas¬
terpieces of enamelled pottery which
he called "rustiques figulines". His
art saved his life. Arrested and
sent to Bordeaux for trial concerning
his activity in the new religion of the
Reformation, he seemed to be doomed.
But the Queen Mother, Catherine de
Medici, intervened by naming him
inventeur des rustiques figulines du roi
(that is, of Henri III). As a member of
the king's household he became im¬
mune to the parliament of Bordeaux.
Palissy boasted that he knew neither
Latin nor Greek. He knew only what

he had seen during extensive travels
as a surveyor before he took up cera¬
mics. His observations were acute
and, in the context of his times, he was
an accomplished geologist, mineralo¬
gist and palaeontologist. Although
Palissy rejected theory and relied on
direct observation, he knew enough
about authoritarian doctrine to be
aware that it denied the adequacy of
rain as a source for springs and rivers.
Nevertheless, what his geological
eye saw convinced him otherwise. In
a book published in 1580 he declared
that springs and rivers take their origin
in and are fed by rain and by rain
alone. This may have been the first
such declaration ever published. This
was more important to mankind than
the creation of his celebrated ena
melled pottery, but Palissy received no
scientific recognition in his own life¬
time. The world waited nearly a cen¬
tury to awaken. Again, the catalyst
was a Frenchman.
In 1668, the French amateur scien¬
tist, Pierre Perrault, convinced of the
adequacy of rain as a source for run¬
off, set out to prove it. During three
years he measured precipitation in the
upper Seine basin, obtaining an aver¬
age of about 49 centimetres annually.
Calculation showed that this was about
six times the estimated discharge of
the Seine. He published this and other
information in 1674.
Measurements and calculations such
as these could have been made at any
time during the previous 2,000 years,
but science simply had not reached the
stage of testing hypotheses by measu¬
rement and observation. Perrault it
was, therefore, who initiated modern
scientific hydrology. Perrault correctly
accounted for the remainder of preci¬
pitation (the part that did not run off
in the Seine), five-sixths of it being
disposed of by groundwater recharge,
evaporation, and transpiration by
plants.
Perrault's findings were verified by
others within a few years and hydro¬
logy was launched toward its modern
course. The science is interdisciplin¬
ary, however, and could make no great
progress along quantitative lines until
the basic sciences of physics, chemis¬
try and biology were well advanced,
and until basic principles of geology
were established.

that reach the sea discharge about
30,000 cubic kilometres of water
annually, and this is about 30 per cent
of precipitation on the continents.
However, only about 50 per cent of
river discharge has been actually
measured, the rest being estimated.
The Amazon, largest river in the
world, had never been measured until
1963-64, when a joint Brazilian-United
States expedition aboard a Brazilian
navy corvette measured it three times,
once at high-water stage, once at low-
water stage, and again at an inter¬
mediate stage.
The average flow was found to be
about 175,000 cubic metres per second,
or about 5,540 cubic kilometres per
year. This is roughly 18 per cent of
the discharge of all rivers of the world.
According to these measurements,
the Amazon is nearly twice as large
as had been estimated earlier. These
measurements alone upset earlier
calculations of the world water budget
and illustrate why large-scale measure-
mejnts are important.
Water science is handicapped by
unsatisfactory techniques and instru¬
ments for measuring many hydrological
phenomena, especially on the very
large and very small scales.
How, for example, does one measure
the rate of movement of ground water
through an aquifer underground? How
does one measure evaporation from
a whole continent or from the world
ocean? These cannot be measured
directly. They can only be estimated
by measuring related phenomena from
which computed values can be derived.
Evaporation and transpiration are
important because they dissipate a
large share of precipitation on land
areas. Because of evaporation, man-
made lakes are not unmixed blessings.
In arid areas lakes may evaporate
annually a layer of water equal to their
surface area and up to three metres
or more in thickness.
Evaporation plus transpiration are
usually computed on the basis of solar
radiation, wind speed, air humidity,
temperature and other factors. Late
in the seventeenth century, the British
astronomer Edmund Halley, based on
a brief experiment in his London
quarters, estimated that annual
evaporation from the warm Medi¬
terranean sea was three feet (about
90 centimetres). The estimate was
low and the modern estimate, averaged
for the world ocean as a whole, is
about 100 centimetres.
Measurement of precipitation has
been practised systematically over an
increasingly large part of the world
during nearly two centuries. The first
European meteorological network was
established in 1780, with its eastern¬
most station in Hungary. Europe and
part of North America are now
reasonably well covered, but precipita¬
tion on vast areas in Asia, Africa,
South America, polar regions and the
seas is virtually unknown.
The last ice age ended some
10,000 years ago, but much of the
world is still locked in deep ice.
The great ice-caps of Greenland and
Antarctica contain nearly 80 per cent
of all water outside the oceans.
Alpine, piedmont and valley glaciers
are widespread; shelf-ice and pack-ice
cover vast expanses of the polar seas;
and permafrost (permanently frozen
ground) occupies vast areas of Siberia,
northern Europe and northern North
America.
The total volume of ice-caps and
glaciers in land areas is about
26 million cubic kilometres, while all
other water in the continents amounts
to only about eight million cubic
kilometres.
Evidently, much of the world is still
in an ice age, but relatively little is
known about the frozen areas.
The great ice-caps seem to be stable,
but considerable difference of opinion
prevails about whether the ice masses
are growing, shrinking or merely being
maintained. It is important that this be
determined because the ice areas are
great weather factories and their
melting would cause a rise of sea level.
The total land area of the world is
149 million square kilometres. About
15 million square kilometres is under
permanent ice cover. Another 22 mil¬
lion square kilometres is in permafrost,
comprising 22 per cent of all the land
area In the Northern Hemisphere.
Nearly 40 million square kilometres
is extremely arid to arid. Considerable
areas are high-altitude mountain
masses.
In all, more than half the world's
land area is basically inhospitable for
human occupation. Despite man's
great adaptability, he has made
relatively little encroachment In the
inhospitable areas.
Burgeoning population, however,
inevitably will place Increasing pressure
on parts of the world that are now
relatively uninhabited but which
contain a wealth of natural resources,
including water. These are the fron¬
tiers of the future and their full use
will require pushing further the
frontiers of knowledge because the
new areas are poorly known and
experience in their occupation is small.
HBIVING standards in all
societies are closely related to water
use. High living standards require
high rates of water use for agriculture,
industry, public services and house¬
holds. The extent to which develop¬
ing countries can forge ahead is link¬
ed to their ability to develop water
resources.
In some countries per capita use of
water is only about 100 litres per day.
In some industrialized countries water
use is sixty times greater. The
disparity between living standards is
even larger.
Lessening of the disparity will
require, not only more water use, but
more use per capita. In view of
prospective population growth in
developing countries, the problem is
formidable. The developed countries
themselves have serious problems.
Doubling of population may entail
doubling of water use merely to
maintain existing standards. The
situation in the United States of
America is illustrative.
Per capita use of water for all pur¬
poses other than hydroelectric power
generation in the United States is
about 6,100 litres per day. This is a
very high rate of use compared to that
of most other countries, even those
which are highly industrialized. How¬
ever, it is only a small part of the
average total national water supply.
In some areas water is re-used many

times. On the average, however,
somewhat more than 90 per cent of the
water yield of the United States is not
subjected to withdrawal uses. It ser¬
ves as a conveyor belt to send
wastes out to the sea. The cen¬
tral problem of water resources de¬
velopment and management is, in fact,
a problem of water quality, not water
quantity.
On a continental or regional scale,
water shortage in one area may be
alleviated by interbasin transfers of
water. This will not necessarily alle¬
viate pollution, however. In the basin
from which water is exported, the
amount remaining to dilute pollution is
less. In the receiving basin it may
permit additional developments that
add to the total pollution problem.
Evidently it is necessary to establish
national, and in some cases, inter¬
national objectives and policies to
control and abate pollution, not merely
to control and distribute water itself.
The real measure of progress at
mid-point in the International Hydro-
logical Decade (IHD) is seen in the
effective international co-operation
that has developed and the importance
of the activities that have been launch¬
ed or planned. The following are a
few examples.
One of the more remarkable areas
of South America is the upper basin
of the Rio Paraguay, known as the
Pantanal, which extends along the
frontiers of Brazil, Bolivia and Para¬
guay. In this vast flood plain which
extends over an area of some 400,000
square kilometres, Unesco and the
Brazilian Government are making a
broad survey on which to base a pro¬
gramme of land reclamation and dev¬
elopment (see article page 14).
When worked out, the methods of
land drainage and development will
serve also for similar operations in the
Bolivian and Paraguayan areas of the
basin. The Pantanal study, In fact,
is one of the greatest of the hydrolo¬
gical surveys now taking place in the
world. It is part of a long-term inter¬
national programme of studies for the
basins of the Rio Parana and the Rio
de la Plata.
Brazil has also set up, within her
Hydrological Decade programme, a
Centre for Applied Hydrology at Porto
Alegre. This has been done with finan¬
cial help from the Government of
Brazil, the National Bank for Economic
Development and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP).
PRE-POLLUTION ICE-CUBES
Since the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago, 80 per cent
of all water outside the oceans has been locked up in the great ice-caps
of Greenland and Antarctica. In the far North, Eskimoes store their
drinking water in the form of blocks of solid ice piled up in the open air,
above. An enterprising Danish firm is now selling "Pre-pollution era"
ice cubes taken from icebergs. Tiny bubbles of air, trapped in
the ice thousands of years ago give a sparkling effect to drinks
in which the cubes are placed.
The Great Lakes of North America
contain one of the largest concentra¬
tions of fresh surface water in the
world. Canada and the United States
have collaborated during many years
in studies of many international water
problems. Now, for the first time, the
two countries are collaborating in an
intensified study of the lakes which
will have wide implications for navi¬
gation, power generation, industrial
and municipal development, fisheries,
and recreation.
Another remarkable area is the
Chad Basin in Africa. The basin is
much larger than Lake Chad itself,
covering 400,000 square kilometres
and extending into the four States of
Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.
Studies in this area relate to the
soil, surface-water and ground-water
resources.
Although many excellent studies had
been made long before the advent of
the Hydrological Decade specifically
under the Arid Zone Research Project
of Unesco the Decade has made it
possible to collate a wide variety of
data.
Through Unesco and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), a
Commission formed by the four ripa¬
rian States obtained assistance from
the UNDP. In consultation with the
Commission, FAO administers the
reclamation studies and Unesco the

M
T
O the west of Brasilia,
stretching out over central Brazil and
extending into parts of Bolivia and
Paraguay, the Mato Grosso swamps
form a vast tableland, some 150 metres
(500 ft.) above sea level, in the very
heart of South America.
Known as the "Pantanal", this huge
region, covering about 400,000 sq. kms.
(150,000 sq. miles) is dotted with
lagoons and hillocks. Through it runs
the river Paraguay and its many
tributaries totalling over 1,300 kms.
(800 miles) in length. During the rainy
NEWTON VELLOSO CORDEIRO was formerly
President of the Brazilian National Committee
for the International Hydrological Decade and
Vice-Chairman of the Co-ordinating Council of
the Decade and was until recently co-director
of the bold development project which he
describes in this article. The project Is being
carried out by the Brazilian Government and
Unesco in co-operation with the United Na¬
tions Development Programme.
season rivers and lagoons merge into
one sheet of water.
In this enormous area, four-fifths
the size of France, the Brazilian
government and Unesco are carrying
out one of the world's greatest
hydrological studies under the auspices
of the United Nations Development
Programme. Begun in 1966, this
project will eventually lead to the
building of a new world capable of
providing food for millions of people
and will facilitate the migration into
the interior of the continent of a
proportion of the population now
concentrated along the coastlands of
Brazil.
The first attempts to populate the
region were made by the Spaniards in
the 16th century when they set out
from the La Plata estuary to reach
the rich mineral deposits of Peru.
But discouraged by lack of economic
resources, the vast distances and the
hostility of the local population, the
Spaniards fell an easy prey to other
colonists pushing westwards from Sao
Paulo. Not until the discovery of gold
in the 18th century was it thought
worth while to explore and settle the
region.
The decline of the gold mines in the
19th century brought the development
of the area to a standstill. The risks
involved in exploiting the plant and
mineral resources, the difficulty of
penetrating the Amazonian forests and
the lack of markets eventually led to
a sharp drop In population.
The Pantanal, however, offers
excellent conditions for cattle-breeding,
with its vast areas of grazing land over
which herds can wander unrestricted.
The exact number of cattle in the
region is not known, but is estimated
to be between 20 and 30 million head.
With its immense estates, or
fazendas, its stock-raising, hunting and
fishing, the Pantanal ¡s one of the

### 56860: The Pantanal: 400,000 sq. km. of swampland in the Mato Grosso

One of the world's biggest
hydrological studies is being
made in a swampland stretching
from central Brazil into Bolivia
and Paraguay. Covering
400,000 sq. km. (see map far left),
the Pantanal (as it is known,
from the Portuguese for
"marshland") is entirely
flooded for half the year.
The hydrological survey,
carried out by Brazil and
Unesco in co-operation with the
U.N. Development Programme,
is part of a programme
aimed at reclaiming the Pantanal
and developing its resources.
A famous cattle-raising centre,
the Pantanal has between
20 and 30 million head of cattle.

richest parts of Brazil. It could also
become an immensely productive
agricultural centre.
The region also possesses con¬
siderable iron and manganese deposits
in the Urucum mountains, south of
Corumba. The main obstacle to their
exploitation is their distance from
Brazil's markets and from ports
equipped for handling minerals. The
use of modern water transport could
help to overcome this problem.
Other than air lines, the only means
of communication linking the region
with the Campo Grande and Sao Paulo
is the north-east Brazil railway line.
Plans exist for the construction of a
huge road networkto serve this cattle-
raising area, whose production is one
of the largest in the world, and also
to ensure the distribution of surplus
agricultural produce in the future.
The far-reaching hydrological studies
project for the Upper Paraguay River
Basin was adopted by the United
Nations Development Programme in
January 1966 and was launched by the
Brazilian Department of Land Re¬
clamation in co-operation with Unesco
later that year. It aims to reclaim and
develop the region, and to serve as a
testing ground for new techniques
which can subsequently be introduced
in Amazonia, Bolivia and Paraguay as
well as in areas with similar conditions
in other continents.
The Pantanal survey is one of the
most significant projects of its kind
in the world, and should serve as a
model for other regions. Its scope
and the variety of activities it covers
make it an outstanding example of the
type of research project which the
Unesco-sponsored International Hydro-
logical Decade seeks to promote.
It also comes under Brazil's own
national programme for the Decade,
which includes projects for developing
the resources of the southern region,
expanding the Institute of Hydraulics
Research at the University of Porto
Alegre and the setting up of a Centre
of Research and Training in Applied
Hydrology.
Until recently no basic information
was available about the Pantanal.
There was no data relating to hydro¬
logy, hydroclimatology or surface
hydrology and it was not until 1965
that the first aerial photogrammetric
surveys were made.
To obtain the information needed as
a basis for the regional development
plan, the current project includes the
installation of a hydrometeorological
network in the Paraguay basin and
research on the hydraulic system
governing the Mato Grosso depression
and the influence of this system on
the Paraguay river.
T
HE Pantanal project com¬
prises two phases. During the first,
which is now under completion, data
obtained will be assembled for study,
longitudinal profiles of the river Para¬
guay and some of its main tributaries
will be drawn up and a preliminary
analysis made of hydrological condi¬
tions in the basins.
In addition, a number of automatic
recording stations will be set up to
measure rainfall and other climatic
data, such as the level of surface and
ground water, and then radio this in¬
formation daily to a central station.
Data collected will be used as a
basis for installing a permanent net¬
work of automatic recording stations
during the second phase. The work
of Brazilian organizations dealing
with the Paraguay basin will be co¬
ordinated, together with measures
taken by the Paraguayan, Bolivian and
Brazilian national commissions for the
International Hydrological Decade.
During the second phase, due to
begin this year, the general survey
work begun In phase one will be
completed and studies of geomorpho-
logical, hydrogeological and ecological
conditions, including processes of
erosion and sedimentation, will be
carried out.
Hydrological data obtained will be
analysed and an experimental fore¬
casting system based on a mathemati¬
cal model will be set up. Maps will
be made of certain areas suitable for
hydraulics installations designed to
promote immediate development.
The project is due to be completed
in 1973 at a total cost of some
$2,400,000. The United Nations Devel¬
opment Programme is contributing
$1,534,500 of this sum, and Brazil will
provide the rest.
The scale of operations scheduled
for the second phase may be extended
if similar surveys are carried out in the
Bolivian and Paraguayan chacos. In
that case events in the Pantanal and
the flood areas downstream could be
forecast several months in advance.
Once data on the regime of the River
Paraguay and its main tributaries is
available, it will be possible to begin
operations to regulate their flow and
levels. A navigable waterway could
be formed covering a distance of
nearly 3,000 kms. (2,000 miles) which
would link up the centres of agri¬
cultural production and mineral
deposits with the main industrial
centres in Sao Paulo and even with
towns in Argentina.
The improvement of communications
will change today's population pattern
of small, scattered groups, and will
stimulate economic development.
Better financial prospects in agri¬
culture and other activities will lead
to improved facilities for cultural and a r
technical education. This in turn will I Q
give a great many more Brazilians a
chance to contribute directly to the
development of their country.

### 56861: Originality and tradition in American culture

Originality

culture
by Charles C. Mark
W
_ _ HEN Ulysses S. Grant was
President of the United States he was
widely quoted as saying: 'I only know
two tunes. One is "Yankee Doodle"
and the other one isn't." Any discus¬
sion of cultural policy In the United
States must first come to grips with
the popularity of anti-intellectualism
and anti-culture throughout its history
that is implied by that presidential
quote.
To be sure, theatres were built and
used before the revolutionary war,
concerts were a monthly event in
many cities, travelling opera and
theatre companies found eager au¬
diences all over the American conti¬
nent. However, these events and
circumstances were almost entirely
reflections of an American need to
become part of European civilization,
to express inner appetites by feasting
on the riches of an inherited culture.
It should also be pointed out that
pockets of real creativity were active
from colonial times forward among
subculture groups. The Moravians
maintained a rich musical tradition in
the forests of Pennsylvania and North
Carolina, for instance. When events
in Europe forced political exile on
special groups as did the French

CHARLES C. MARK is Director of the Office
of State and Community Operations at the
National Foundation for the Arts, In the United
States. The author presents a complete
survey of this subject in " A Study of Cultur¬
al Policy in the United States '. published
last year by Unesco in the series: "Studies
and Documents on Cultural Policies'
Revolution and the German insurrection
of 1848, the United States received a
cultural injection as these people
carried on traditions of culture as part
of their new life.
However, the main stream of Ameri¬
can civilization before the twentieth
century did not value the arts, parti¬
cularly American manifestations of the
arts. Only a small percentage of the
population showed concern for artistic
quality and permanence. The majority
made new art as they pioneered a new
country and it was decades before
these novel expressions were allowed
stature.
Three points must be borne in mind
in order to view American cultural
history properly. Most important is
the fact that the United States was
entirely a nation of immigrants im¬
ported from other cultures. The only
indigenous culture was that of the
Indians who were driven from their
land and destroyed as a people. Amer¬
ican folk culture as it developed with
time (and it did develop) is a synthesis
of European, African, and to a much
lesser extent, Asian culture.
The second point relates to the
importation of other cultures and the
predominant motivation of the early
settlers. Essentially, the United States
was a nation of farmers until the mid-
nineteenth century, a nation which
colonized and exploited itself. Its
cities were trading and supply centres
for the trek west to new lands. People
came from small, soil-poor farms of
Europe directly to the endless rich
prairies where they could own as much
land as they could cultivate and
protect.
These were hardy, frugal, hard¬
working yeomen willing to struggle
against man and nature, but cultivated
music, dance, or painting were not part
of their lives. They brought their
peasant culture with them and practised
it in the settlements they built to
resemble "home". Europeans are often
astounded today to find that there are
whole areas of some states where
English is not the common language,
but rather German, Norwegian, Italian
or Basque.
The third factor influencing cultural
growth in the United States was the
Protestant religions. Beginning with
the Puritans whose beliefs allowed for
only service to God and one's occupa¬
tion, the other developing sects
added fine variants aimed at repress¬
ing instincts toward the arts. All of
the arts were expressly forbidden by
the Puritans, including bright colours
for clothing. As late as the 1870s,
the leaders of the Baptist, Methodist
and Presbyterian religions were
debating the appropriateness of family
recreation, not to mention theatre,
dancing, or popular entertainments.
In 1872, the Methodist Episcopal Con¬
vention passed by majority vote a
list of "amusements", including every
form of art, that were forbidden to
all Methodists.
With these three conditions against
American culture, how is it that the
arts managed to survive at all?

AMERICAN CULTURE (Continued from page 16)
From the birth of a nation to the rhapsody in blue
20
Fortunately, the new continent poured
forth riches beyond anyone's dreams
and wealth meant travel. Sons were
sent back to England to be educated,
wives went to France on shopping
trips. European merchants, craftsmen,
and finally artists found opportunities
by serving the wealthy. One German
architect designed and built over fifty
of the most gracious plantation man¬
sions in the south, training slaves at
each place to be carpenters, wood-
carvers and joiners. And taste began
to breed taste.
H
| | OWEVER, the Industrial
Revolution is responsible for the most
influential and most debatable cultural
movement. A period of 57 years, bet¬
ween 1860 and 1917, saw the founding
of most of the United States quality
institutions of the arts. The Metropo¬
litan Opera, the Metropolitan Museum,
the New York and St. Louis orchestras,
were among the earliest, but by the
time of the First World War most of
the famous schools and institutions
were established.
This was, however, imported culture.
It was an attempt to ape the capitals
of Europe, not to develop an American
cultural life. Considerable evidence
points to the fact that many of the
wealthy who established, attended,
and carefully guarded these institutions
from any infusion of the lower classes
did not really enjoy the experience
of art.
However, at the time when the
industrial barons were buying culture
packaged in Europe, other social
changes were taking place. The
country was turning from an agricul¬
tural society into an urban one. New
waves of immigrants were arriving
from Europe, this time to stay in the
cities and find places for their lives.
Whole sections of large cities became
foreign to native Americans and some
remain so today.
In addition, rural people joined the
urban migration and began fighting for
the factory jobs. It was this phen¬
omenon that struck at the village
and family-oriented Protestant reli¬
gions. Thousands were attending the
low-priced and continuous vaudeville
shows and the leading clergy were
forced to choose between retracting
their position on entertainment or
watching the American family dis¬
integrate as the younger generation
preferred the orchestra seat to the
church pew.
This was a major debate in the
nation from 1880 until 1915, by which
time entertainment was so widely
accepted that the few remaining
"village" preachers were ignored.
As one leading clergyman after
another crossed over the box-office
threshold, the vaudeville entrepreneurs
made every effort to hold their en¬
dorsement by providing elevating and
polite acts in their theatres. It was
during this period that American taste
and humour was developed and
distilled. This was also the period
when the sexless, non-controversial
content of Hollywood films was
perfected. Vaudeville added films to
the acts presented in the early 1920s.
Since the theatre-owners prided them¬
selves on the "family entertainment"
motif of their attractions, the Holly¬
wood film-makers produced films
aimed at these major markets.
Meanwhile, indigenous culture was
growing untended and unappreciated.
Theatrical and musical performances
abounded from the early seventeenth
century and were attended by reb¬
ellious Protestants, European-orient¬
ed Americans, and members of minor¬
ity religions, but native creative talent
and ideas were not valued as compar¬
able to any work or artist of European
origin. Church opposition kept many
talented people from embracing the
artist's life, although literature and
painting were not always included on
lists of forbidden pastimes, and Amer¬
ican authors and painters sometimes
found sympathetic acceptance at home
so long as they followed European
traditions. However, through the
nineteenth century, from Benjamin
West to Mary Cassatt and Henry
James, Europe had the climate that
claimed America's most original and
talented artists.
What are the uniquely American
contributions to world culture ? Only
when the contributions had been
envied around the world did Americans
recognize them and begin to believe
that this culture could produce its own
art. Three individual art forms became
labelled as distinctly American in the
early twentieth century: jazz, a unique
form of dancing, and the musical
comedy. All three came out of con¬
ditions of suppression. All three
evolved from a folk subculture that
was expressed freely, but held un¬
acceptable by the main stream of
American society until after it was
applauded wildly In other countries.
Jazz, as is widely known, was born
of a European mother and a African
father. Slaves and freed Negroes
picked up European instruments and
melodies and added rhythms and
musical organization as they felt it.
From the funeral processions and
brothels of the south, it spread north
and east until the world danced to the
blues. It influenced European com¬
posers and then serious American
composers began legitimizing its
sounds.
A jazz dancer tapped his feet to
complex rhythms and the enthusiastic
approval of audiences all over Europe,
including Queen Victoria, about 1850.
At that time no respectable American
gentleman would have admitted having
seen Juba (William Henry Lane) or
anyone who danced in his style.
Isadora Duncan, fifty years later, was
practically driven from the country for
ideas about free movement and
rhythm. These roots led to so-called
modern dance which existed as an
underground culture until forty years
ago, and only recently attracted a
stable audience.
USICAL theatre began in
America before the revolutionary war,
and evolved steadily from the first pro¬
fessional all-American musical, The
Archers, first performed in 1796. One
reason for an almost tyrannical
preoccupation with combining plays
with music was the opposition of local
governments (church inspired) to
"straight" theatre. It was assumed that
music had a certain moral tone and
no play could be really bad if it had
songs connected with it.
Minstrel shows, showboats, tra¬
velling troupes, and even circuses
found musical plays a popular part of
their repertory with the rural and
frontiersmen audiences. Partly due to
the tradition established in the east in
the eighteenth century, but also prob¬
ably because Americans have an
inexplicable love for gay melodies, the
musical grew and flourished and
became the standard of the world.
By the second decade of the
twentieth century, when the United
States came to realize its relative
strength among nations, its people at
the same time realized that a tra¬
ditional American culture did in fact
exist, or was rapidly developing. The
years of the 1920s saw an enormous
burst of artistic energy from American

artists. As evidence, Americans had
been winning Nobel Prizes in science
and peace since the beginning of the
award in 1901 (Peace Prize, 1906;
Physics, 1907; etc.); but not until
Sinclair Lewis won the Literature Prize
in 1930 had an American artist received
such world acclaim. Since then, five
Americans and one author who was
born and educated in the United States
(T. S. Eliot) have been honoured.
T
| HE point of this capsulized
social history of the arts in America is
that to speak of cultural policy as an
extension of traditional culture is a
difficult undertaking in the United
States. Many countries have under¬
gone periods of cultural encourage¬
ment and discouragement in the
course of their history. They have
seen their folk art evolve from the first
primitive tribes to settle in their
regions at the dawn of time. Other
nations Jiave seen their cities become
established as centres of culture and
commerce and remain such centres
century after century. And they have
proudly acclaimed their mature artists
as they emerged from mature artistic
institutions and societies. All these
events and circumstances are not
applicable to the United States.
Its history began with the cultures
of many countries severed from the
traditional roots. Art was officially
discouraged by the powerful and
almost universal fundamentalist reli¬
gions. The nation was scattered in
the wilderness for its first hundred
years. Cities of sophistication in the
eighteenth century became ordinary
towns as the centre of national life
moved west. (Charleston, South
Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, were
once extremely important national cul¬
tural capitals.) New Orleans lost its exci¬
tement to St. Louis; St. Louis lost its
place to Chicago as the railroad
replaced the riverboat. No repertory
theatre to date has managed to hold
together for 25 years, only two
orchestras can boast of 100 years of
existence.
Indigenous American culture did not
clearly become definable until the
twentieth century when American
composers, playwrights and authors
began to find the unique American beat
In their work. It came from the Indian
ceremonies and the restlessness of
the pioneer families, but its expression
as an instinctively understood inter¬
pretation had to wait until the land
was conquered.
All this not only affects the scope
of a cultural policy, but also affects

THE EXPANDING ARTS
IN THE U.S.A.
The United States boasts 1,200 community orchestras, 30,000 amateur
theatre groups and between 10 and 15 million amateur painters as well
as countless ceramists, weavers, lapidists, etc.
There is virtually no town in the U.S. of 5,000 population that does not
have an adequate general public library augmented by a state library
system. It is estimated that about 10 per cent (20 million) of the
population reads intensely while a larger proportion reads books only
occasionally. University publishing houses now make up an important
segment of the American book world.
In addition to commercial television the U.S. has 140 public T.V.
stations which broadcast only educational and cultural programmes.
Recent legislation provides federal funds for a quasi-public organization
to weld these educational T.V. stations into a single network.
An American Film Institute was launched in 1967 with a $5.2 million
fund made up of contributions from federal funds, private foundation
grants and commercial film corporation gifts. The Institute trains young
people for the profession and works with colleges on film-study courses
and the promotion of the film arts. Funds are provided for unusual
feature films by young directors. 150 U.S. universities offer courses
in film study and appreciation.
Resident professional theatre groups are spreading across the U.S.
By 1968, fifty cities had resident companies performing high calibre
Broadway and standard classics. Some of these companies also try
out new or controversial plays. A new emerging theatre force is the
"theatre-in-the-street" movement. The movement is concerned with
social aspects of theatre and the cultural development of lower income
groups. Standard modern works and classics, original dramas and
improvisational works are performed from mobile truck theatres, on street
corners, in churches, schools and open fields. Budgets are precarious
and support comes largely from public and private grants.
There are now 28 major symphony orchestras in the U.S. These and
an additional 40 smaller orchestras have received grants totalling
$82 million for the establishment of endowment funds.
Some 200 cultural centres have been built in the U.S. since 1950, but
a National Endowments for the Arts study estimates that $7,500 million
would be required to equip the nation with all the facilities needed for
the arts. Such centres are usually financed by contributions from local
private and public resources with occasional federal or state participation.
Some more unusual methods have been adopted: the state of New Jersey
financed the Garden Arts Center from expressway tolls; Huntsville,
Alabama is paying for its cultural centre by a municipal liquor tax; in
Tacoma, Washington, a city jail was given over for an arts centre.
About 85 per cent of all contributions to the arts in the U.S. come from
private individuals, foundations or other corporate sources. About 1,500
foundations make grants to the arts totalling about $60 million annually.
There are 350 art museums in the U.S. and about half of them have
continuing programmes in one of the art forms in addition to the
visual arts.
*
A survey of 221 U.S. cities conducted in 1967 concluded that more new
buildings for the arts have been completed in the past five years than in
any other period in U.S. history. Seventy-one cities have buildings for
the arts under way; 36 museums, 34 theatres, 23 arts centres and
7 concert halls have been built for 70 American cities in recent years. 21

Jazz is one of the uniquely American

the ability to evaluate and effectively
plan long-term programmes even if a
defined political philosophy made such
planning possible. Instead, as stated
at Unesco's 1968 Round Table Meeting
on Cultural Policies, in Monaco,
"Cultural needs are evolving more
quickly; new needs are appearing, and
public taste changes. .. One must,
therefore, avoid choosing a framework
which may become too narrow and
preserve the possibility of a flexible
adaptation of resources to the require¬
ments of a rapidly evolving cultural
scene." This must be the American
position.
The events sketched lightly here are
generally the cultural heritage for
which contemporary cultural leaders of
the United States must account as
policies and programmes progress.
By all signs, the United States is well
into a most Incredible artistic naissan¬
ce. The historical maturity has caught
up with the experiences of the world
situation. The economic strength of
the nation is capable of sustaining any
artistic effort, and its international
commitments demand an ever deeper
involvement with other countries in all
enterprises, including intellectual and
artistic. In addition, far in advance of
other nations, the United States has
encountered the extreme effects of the
Industrial Revolution, the imminent
realization that man Is or may be
mechanically obsolete. It is already
glaringly evident that America cannot
control some of the situations into
which its technology has placed it.
This is a time in American history that
cries for the humanistic influence in
life. The United States seems to be
moving toward a full realization of the
importance of culture as a counter¬
weight to technocracy.

### 56863: The Eagle, 'spacecraft' of the pre-scientific age

THE EAGLE
'spacecraft' of the
pre-scientific age
by José
Patrocinio de Souza
JOSE PATROCINIO DE SOUZA, Indian
historian and writer, is head of the Depart¬
ment of History at Elphinstone College,
Bombay, the oldest university college in
western India. Professor de Souza has made
a special study of the origins, migration
and meaning of symbols, particularly the uni¬
versal symbols of the eagle and the serpent.
He is preparing two books in this field: "The
Symbol of the Double-Headed Eagle: Its
Origin, Diffusion and Significance" and "The
Eagle and the Serpent: A Study in Sym¬
bolism. "
w
HOEVER conceived the
idea of naming the Lunar Module which
landed the first men on the moon, the
"Eagle", displayed, consciously or un¬
consciously, a remarkable sense of
history. For, man being carried into
outer space by an eagle, or man
ascending to the astral regions in the
form of an eagle, was a widespread
human fancy in the pre-scientific age.
It is true that the Athenian comic
dramatist, Aristophanes, caricatured
the belief in his play Peace, by send¬
ing his hero up on the back of a dung-
beetle. Aristophanes notwithstanding,
the eagle fancy persisted, giving
rise to a succession of myths and to
works of art illustrating them.
This flight of early man into space
was, of course, a flight of his imagina¬
tion. But the spacecraft "Eagle" has
transformed myth into reality and made
the ancient dream come true, thus
linking two principal epochs in the
history of man the Age of Faith and
the Age of Science. And, whether
real or imaginary, the object of man's
flight into space has been funda¬
mentally the same throughout history.
"Man was voyaging to the planets,"
says Norman Mailer in his forthcoming
book A Fire on the Moon, "in order to
look for God. Or was it to destroy
Him?"
But why did the ancients imagine
that the eagle would be able to carry
man into outer space? To the people,
who lived, worked and had their being
in and through symbols, the eagle was
the sky-bird par excellence. Dwelling
at inaccessible heights and soaring
higher, perhaps, than any other bird,
the eagle was flying, so it seemed
to their lively imagination, towards the
sun and merging itself with the sky.
It thus became to them a fit attribute
and vehicle of their sky and solar

Africa and Europe.

THE EAGLE (Continued)
deities, such as Zeus of the Greeks,
Jupiter of the Romans and Vishnu of
the Hindus.
The eagle as the symbol of the sky
is graphically represented on a Sas¬
sanian carved silver plate now pre¬
served In the Hermitage Museum,
Leningrad. A spread eagle is depicted
as holding by the hips a nude woman
with pomegranate breasts. In her
right hand she holds aloft a plate
of fruit, apparently pomegranates.
Scholars have identified this figure
with the old Iranian fertility goddess,
Anahit.
But Anahit also had a specific astral
significance: she was the personi¬
fication of the planet Venus, the
morning star. The motif may thus be
taken to represent the sky in the form
of an eagle "presenting its loveliest
planet." Although the design belongs
to Sassanian times, the conception of
the sky-bird synthetized with an
anthropomorphic astral deity dates
back to the second, or more probably,
the third millennium B.C.
Moving, as it seemed to the ancients,
between earth and heaven, the most
majestic of birds was conceived by
them as carrying kings and heroes
from earth to heaven, or as being sent
down to earth by the gods to take up
their favourites thither. The mytholo¬
gies of many nations are rich in
stories of high-ranking personages
being transported to the astral regions
by the eagle.
The oldest, perhaps, of these myths
is the ' much-travelled tale of the
Mesopotamian hero, Etana who was
the first man to go "where eagles
dare." According to the early
Sumerian chronology, this prototype
of the modern astronauts was the
thirteenth king of the First Dynasty of
Kish after the Great Flood.
Etana's flight into outer space,
clinging to the pinions of an eagle, is
the theme of the Legend of Etana, a
fascinating poem in cuneiform, which
has survived in a later copy, fragments
of which were recovered on some clay
tablets from the library of the Assyrian
monarch, Assurbanipal. They were
first published by George Smith in
his remarkable book, The Chaldean
Genesis, and added to later by other
scholars.
The occasion for Etana's flight into
space was his quest for "the plant of
childbirth," which would cure his wife
of her barrenness. Etana had been
looking high and low for this
miraculous herb, but in vain, so he
appealed to Shamash, the Sun-god, to
help him find It.
The god directed him to a certain
eagle, which Etana found lying in a pit
badly bruised in a fight with a serpent,
its traditional cosmic antagonist.
Etana tended the wounded bird with
all the care he could bestow on it.
Thanks to his ministrations, the bird's
wounds were healed and it regained
its strength. Out of gratitude to the
king, the eagle undertook to carry him
to the courts of Ishtar (Venus), the
goddess of childbirth, and thus
addressed him:
My friend, lift up thy countenance,
Come and let me carry thee to the
heaven of Anu.
On my breast place thy breast,
On my pinions place thy palms.

### 56863: The Eagle, 'spacecraft' of the pre-scientific age

At the eagle's bidding, Etana, old
though he was, taking courage into
his hands, "set his breast against the
breast of the eagle, and laid his hands
on the feathers of its wings." Then
the eagle took off without making
much noise unlike Apollo-11 with
the old man clinging to it for dear life,
and soared higher and higher, pointing
out on the way "the vast dwindling
panorama of earth and sea."
At last they reached heaven, and
passed through the courts of Anu,
Enlil and Ea, but the throne of Ishtar
was still higher up. It was now six
hours that they had been going up
without a stop, and Etana, either
because his courage failed him or
because he felt giddy, ordered the
eagle to halt and take him back to
earth. Unfortunately, the text is badly
defaced here, and the poem ends with
the sad account of the "spacecraft's"
crash landing.
On numerous cylinder seals dating
back to the Dynasty of Akkad, third
millennium B.C., Is depicted a strange
scene which many scholars have
interpreted as illustrating the flight of
Etana Into space, though on these
seals a bearded man is seen riding
on the back of a bird, whereas
according to the Legend of Etana, the
patriarch was carried up clinging to
the pinions of an eagle.
The bird on these seals is probably
an eagle, taking off with a bearded
man, possibly Etana, on its back.
Immediately below the eagle is a dog,
or, more commonly, two dogs seated
or standing face-to-face on either side
of a bag or vessel, evidently belonging
to the patriarch. They are frequently
depicted looking up in surprise at their
master. Another interesting feature
of these representations is the flock
of sheep.

This ancient Mesopotamian tale and
its illustrations in Sumerian art tra
velled widely, for Mesopotamia lay at
the cross-roads of the ancient cultural
world. The motif first migrated to
Iran. On an Iranian shell cylinder,
contemporaneous with the Akkadian
seals, a mythological scene is depicted.
Above a seated female figure, with
snakes emanating from her shoulders,
appears an eagle over one of whose
wings a human head is seen. This
design has been taken by some
scholars to be a rendering of the myth
of Etana in an abbreviated form.
There Is yet another, and better,
Illustration of the legend in Iranian art.
It is carved on a magnificent gold bowl
dating back to the second millennium
B.C. This rare object was discovered
by Robert Dyson in 1958 at Hasanlu,
in Iranian Azerbaijan in the course of an
archaeological expedition led by John
Dyson. In the elaborate scene de¬
picted on the bowl we see an eagle
in full flight carrying off a human
being, recalling the Mesopotamian
myth.
The tradition of Etana's flight sur¬
vived in later tales, notably in the
story of Alexander's flight into space.
Among the many wonderful exploits
attributed to Alexander the Great is
the one of his making himself small
and flying through the air perched on
the back of an eagle till he reached
the "heights of the heavens," which he
explored. From that altitude Alexander
was able to acquire a knowledge of
the dimensions of the earth, and of
the seas and mountains that he would
have to cross in his march of worid
conquest.
The Koran relates that a Babylonian
king held a disputation with the
Hebrew patriarch Abraham concerning
"Abraham's Lord". Commentators on
the Koranic text have identified the
monarch with Nimrod, who afterwards
caused Abraham to be cast into
a fire, from which, however, he was
miraculously delivered. Thereupon,
Nimrod built a tower so as to ascend
to heaven to see "Abraham's Lord"
and make war on him, but the tower
was mysteriously overthrown.
But Nimrod did not give up his
attempt and had himself carried up in
a chest drawn by four monstrous,
eagle-like birds, then after wandering
for some time in space, he fell down
on a mountain with such great force
that he made it shake.
A similar story is told in the great
Iranian epic, the Shah-nama, about
King Kay Kaus who was lifted up into
space in a car to which were harnessed
four eagles, one at each corner, which
flew upwards in their efforts to reach
the lumps of flesh attached to the
upper parts of the car. There are
several examples of the illustration of
this legend which may be referred to
a Sassanian original, the best known
of which is the marble slab inserted
in the northern wall of San Marco in
Venice.
Echoes of the Etana myth are also
to be heard in the Arabian Nights

Entertainments. During his Second
Voyage, Sinbad the Sailor tied himself
with his turban to the legs of the
fabulous Rukh or Roc, an eagle-like
bird, which flew up into the air carrying
Sinbad with it. It soared so high into
space that poor Sinbad lost sight of
the earth and it seemed to him as if
he had reached the very limit of the
sky. The bird, however, descended,
till it alighted on the top of a hill.
Great adventurer that he was,
Sinbad had yet another opportunity to
fly into space. In the course of his
Seventh Voyage, he found that in a
certain town at the beginning of each
month the townsmen were transformed
into birds and flew. Sinbad induced
one of them to carry him on his back,
but the man, or rather the bird, flew
so high that Sinbad could hear "the
angels glorifying God in the heavenly
dome."
In Tibet there is the story of a
Griffin a fabulous animal with lion's
body and eagle's beak and wings,
which rewarded the hero by taking him
upon its back and flying straight
through the "Great Golden Gate",
where it deposited the youth in the
centre of a vast courtyard round which
sat numerous gods, fairies and "other
denizens of the sky." Similarly, in
Swedish folklore the Phoenix, the
fabulous eagle-like Sun-bird, once
carried a youth on its back to "the
beautiful Palace East of the Sun and
North of the Earth."
The Etana myth found a spiritual ex¬
pression at Rome in the apotheosis
of the Emperor. We get a detailed
account of the ceremonies connected
with the deification of the Roman
Emperor from Herodian's description
of the obsequies of Severus, which
Herodian apparently witnessed. The
most significant of the funerary rites
was "the liberation, at the moment of
kindling the funeral pyre, of an eagle
which was supposed to bear the
Emperor's soul to heaven."
Apotheoses of emperors and mem
bers of the Imperial family were
recurring motifs in Roman art. The
eagle is an indispensable part of these
representations. Among the better
known examples are the apotheosis of
Titus sculpted on the Arch of Titus and
that of Augustus on a grand cameo
in the Louvre. Bronze medallions of
Antoninus Pius have "Consecratio"
inscribed on their reverse, and the
emperor with a himation (draped gar¬
ment) wrapped about his legs and a
sceptre in his right hand is shown
being carried aloft on the back of an
eagle. On some Roman coins the apo¬
theosis of Faustina is represented.
T
here is a story in the
Mahabharata which is reminiscent of
the apotheosis of the Roman Emperor.
After a brave warrior named Bhu-
rishtrava died on the field of battle
his soul was carried to heaven, on the
order of Krishna, by Garuda, the giant
eagle of Hindu mythology and the
mount of Vishnu, as of Krishna, his
incarnation. Similarly, the soul of the
Celtic hero Lugh-Llew Llaw in the
Mabinogion, flew up to heaven as an
eagle when Lugh-Llew was killed by
the tanist (his heir), at midsummer.
The archetypal myth of the eagle
carrying kings and heroes up to heaven
has its reverse version in Iranian
mythology. Rustam, a sky hero, was
brought by the Simurgh, a fabulous
bird of the eagle species, in the
opposite direction from heaven to
earth to be one of the first monarchs
of Iran.
In Greek mythology also there is
the story of the Sky-god Zeus coming
down from heaven in the form of an
eagle and abducting Thaleia, a nymph
of Mount Aitne in Sicily. This legend
is illustrated on a red-figured vase-
painting from Nola, Italy, which shows
Zeus as a mighty eagle in a blaze of
celestial splendour carrying Thaleia
from earth to heaven.
But the myth of the eagle of Zeus
coming down to earth and carrying off
a mortal, which gained immense popu¬
larity in Greece and later in Rome,
is that of Ganymede the son of Tros,
who gave his name to Troy. Because
of his dazzling beauty, this youth was
carried off from earth to heaven to
replace Hebe as cup-bearer to Zeus.
There, are several versions of this
myth, variously describing the manner
in which Ganymede was kidnapped.
But the most popular version has it
that he was carried off by the eagle
of Zeus.
The rape of Ganymede was a favou¬
rite motif in Greek art. The most cele¬
brated and, by all accounts, the most
typical representation of the myth is
the Ganymede group in bronze by
Leochares, an accomplished Attic
A bronze medallion of the

(86-161 A.D.) while the people

sculptor of the fourth century B.C.
Although the original, praised by Pliny,
has been lost, several copies of this
work have survived the ravages of
time. The best of them is the marble
copy in the Museo Pio Clementino at
the Vatican.
The presence of the dog in the Leo-
chares sculpture reminds us of the
Etana scenes on the Sumerian cylinder
seals. So does Virgil's description in
the Aeneid, Book V, of the design
embroidered on the robe awarded to
Cloanthus, the winning captain in the
boat race. In Dryden's translation the
passage reads:
There Ganymede Is wrought with
living art,
Chasing through Ida's groves the
trembling hart,
Breathless he seems, yet eager to
pursue,
When from aloft descends, in open
view,
The bird of Jove, and sousing on his
prey,
With crooked talons bears the boy
away.
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing
eyes,
His guards behold him soaring
through the skies,
And dogs pursue his flight with
imitated cries.
There are several adaptations of the
Ganymede group by Leochares in the
Graeco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. In
these specimens, Garuda is shown
seizing a Nagini after the manner of
the eagle in the Vatican copy of the
Leochares masterpiece.

youth being carried up by an eagle
seem to have been influenced, by the
Ganymede sculpture of Leochares. But
they are also in line with the primitive
Iranian tradition of the sky-eagle being
synthetized with the sky-deity.
Two examples deserve particular
notice. One is on a tenth-century
bowl in the Keleklan Collection at the
Victoria and Albert Museum, London.
A spread eagle is depicted on the
inside of the bowl, carrying off a hero
who is extended over the body of
the bird and is clinging to it. A strik¬
ing feature of this design is the dog
shown within the double border round
the eagle.
The other example is even more
remarkable. It occurs as a decoration
on a twelfth-century white silk com¬
pound cloth in the A.D. Bliss Collec¬
tion. Here the eagle is double-headed
and carries off a prince, who clasps
with both his hands a circlet passing
round the neck of the bird.
Indian mythology Is not lacking in
stories of the eagle being sent down
from on high to carry mortals to hea¬
ven. There is, for instance, the story
related in the Mahabharata of a king
called Vasu Uparichara, who was
deeply devoted to Narayana (Vishnu).
When his time was up, "renouncing
his body", Uparichara ascended to
heaven. After having had a taste of
heavenly bliss, however, the poor man
tumbled down from paradise and
"went down a hole in the earth."
This came about through the curse
of the Brahamanas, whose wrath Upa¬
richara had aroused when he acted as
an arbitrator in a dispute between
them and the gods regarding the pro¬
per method of offering religious sacri¬
fices, and had the temerity to give his
award in favour of the gods.
Although, like Lucifer, Vasu had fal¬
len so low, he did not, unlike Lucifer,
give up his faith in God (Vishnu) but
continued to worship him as fer¬
vently as before. Being highly pleas¬
ed with Uparichara who thus showed
himself to be entirely devoted to him
and dependent on him as his sole
refuge in distress, Vishnu ordered
his mount, the swift Garuda, to rescue
the fallen king.
In an unparalleled diving operation,
Garuda swooped down into the pit in
which Vasu was lying and, lifting him
up, it soared into the sky and there
released him from its beak. In this
way, thanks to the eagle of Vishnu,
Vasu Uparichara re-entered heaven
and regained his divine form.
By a strange coincidence, there is
also an intimate connexion between
the eagle and the moon in Indian
mythology. According to the Rigveda,
it was Suparna, "the fair-wing'd one",
which is but another name for Garuda,
that brought Soma to man. Now, in
the Veda, Soma means the exhilarat¬
ing celestial drink. But it also means
the moon, which was supposed to
hold the life-giving, wisdom-imparting
nectar.
Sad to relate, the moon which the
"Eagle", unlike the bird of legend,
has brought within human reach is a
dry and dusty planet without so much
as a drop of water, let alone nectar, in
its so-called "seas". And to think that
there was a time when man imagined
the moon to be a bowl of liquid, so
that Shakespeare could fancy "young
Cupid's fiery shaft" being "quench'd
in the chaste beams of the wat'ry
moon I"
Verily, the "Eagle", while it has
enabled man to realize one dream,
has shattered another. It has com¬
pleted the process of stripping the
moon of all the romance with which,
from times immemorial, man had
draped it, and has exposed it for
what it really is an ugly, pock¬
marked planet, devoid of vegeta¬
tion, unfit for normal human habita¬
tion, without the faintest resem¬
blance to its personification as the
beautiful Selene by the ancient Greeks.
Aptly did Thomas Campbell versify:
"Tis distance lends enchantment to
the view,
And robes the mountain in its azure
hue."
Garuda, a fabulous bird, carrier of
the Hindu god Vishnu and mortal
enemy of the genii of land and sea,
carries of a Nagini, a female
sprite. This Gandhara bas-relief
probably dates from the 4th
century A.D.

### 56864: The Five crises of the university

The five crises
of the university
by James A. Perkins
T
28
HERE is not just a single
crisis of the university, there are
several crises. What we must recog¬
nize is that any one of them by itself
would be enough to cause serious
trouble. The second point is that these
crises are closely related to one ano¬
ther. Thirdly, their solution will prob¬
ably require a major change in the
organization, structure and mission of
the university.
The first crisis is of course the crisis
of numbers. Throughout the world the
largest numerical increase in educa¬
tional growth is at the primary and
secondary level, but by all odds the
highest percentage increase in educa¬
tional growth is at the level of higher
education.
While experiences differ from coun¬
try to country it is safe to say that on
the average the number of students
entering higher education has doubled
in the decade from 1960 to 1970.
Even this swollen number will at
least double in the next decade. If
there were no other problems, this
astonishing growth would, by itself,
result in almost intolerable strains on
most institutions of higher education in
most countries.
The root causes of this increase are
JAMES A. PERKINS of the United States is
Chairman and Director of the Center for Edu¬
cational Enquiry, In New York. He was a
participant at Unesco's International sympo¬
sium on "Education and the Development
of Man", held in Paris in February of this
year, and presented a major study on "The
Crises of the University", on which the
present article is based.
to be found in the requirements of
modern technological society. The
need for trained or even semi-trained
manpower is unending. No country
and no people have a chance of
entering the modern world with only a
small fraction of the population attain¬
ing the equivalent of a secondary
school degree. And no country and
no people can hope to provide the
leadership necessary for a modern
society if only a very small fraction
acquire the equivalent of a college or
university degree.
It is of course unwise to be too
specific about what the threshold
figures for advanced education should
be for any particular country. But for
this writer 30 per cent of the relevant
age group going through secondary
school and 5 per cent of the relevant
age group going through the university
are the threshold figures for a modern
society.
This does not mean that with 30 per
cent acquiring secondary school de¬
grees and 5 per cent acquiring univer¬
sity degrees the country has adequate
manpower for the modern world. It
means simply that until these figures
are reached a society has today little
chance of entering on the current world
stage. Furthermore, larger percentages
than these will be necessary for those
countries who would lead.
It is a sombre note that progress
toward even those limited objectives
has not been uniformly steady. Large
parts of the world are nowhere near
these threshold figures, and in many
countries, expanded higher and sec¬
ondary education must be viewed
against the backdrop of the battle
against illiteracy, which is not being
won. This year there are almost
800 million adult illiterates in the world
a heavy anchor that the developing
countries must drag with them as they
struggle towards modernization.
Nevertheless, most countries have
democratized their secondary educa¬
tion. Heretofore, in many places,
secondary education was the selective
and narrow route through which
entrance to college and university was
determined. Admission to the univer¬
sity was really controlled by careful
selection for secondary school through
examinations taken at the ages of 11
or 12. Under these arrangements, it
was quite possible for countries to
follow a principle of permitting all
secondary school graduates to enter
the university.
With the widening of admissions to
secondary education, however, tradi¬
tional policies of automatic entry into
university have led to enrolments that,
in many cases, are almost grotesque.
Over 100,000 students are enrolled in
the Universities of Paris and Mexico
apiece.
Those countries that have tried to
regulate this tide by turning aside large
fractions of the new graduates from
secondary school have run into much
social opposition, which has been mat¬
ched only by the reaction of students
who have been admitted to find no pla¬
ces prepared for them.
The central fact about numbers is
that we have opened wide the gates to
secondary education but have planned
higher education on the traditional
bases of professional standards and
high selectivity. It is this mismatch of
numbers and of social doctrine that
is at the core of the crisis of numbers.
We are trying to pour the ocean into
our wine glasses and we are getting
wet.
The second crisis of the universities
is that of finance, which stems directly
but not exclusively from the crisis of
numbers. Because we were prepared
neither in doctrine nor in administration
for the doubling of our student en¬
trance during the decade of the Six¬
ties, we are suddenly faced with large
demands for funds, for which neither
fiscal policy nor tax structures were
adequately prepared. The result has
been shortages in every part of the
system, including both manpower and
money.
The budgets of the universities have
gone up not only to accomodate a
doubled enrolment within a decade but
also to deal with the improvidence that
comes from continuing old patterns
which are unnecessarily expensive.
The shocking fact is that the produc¬
tivity of higher education has not
improved during this decade, the per
capita cost of student education has
increased, and the effect of these mul¬
tiplying factors and soaring budgets
has fallen largely on the public trea¬
suries indeed, in most countries,
exclusively on the public treasuries.
As a result of these twin crises of
numbers and costs, there is hardly a
university in the world that is not in
financial difficulty that runs all the way
from serious to catastrophic.

### 56864: The Five crises of the university

CRISES OF THE UNIVERSITY (Continued)
The paradox of too much success
30
The consequences are not difficult
to discover. The first is an enormous
increase in the use of public funds.
Tuition rates have steadily increased.
Yet, in those countries that have
financed a substantial part of higher
education from student tuition, the per¬
centage of the total cost it is able to
support has steadily declined. Public
money has become an increasingly
important element in every budget.
Another consequence of the univer¬
sity crises has, of course, been an
increase in public surveillance of aca¬
demic expenditures which has in turn
raised deep problems about the future
autonomy of individual institutions and
of the whole educational system. It
takes no crystal-ball gazer to anticipate
that, as educational budgets increase
as a fraction of total government bud¬
gets, the public demand for surveil¬
lance will increase. Thus, a whole
new set of relationships between the
university and the central governments
stands high on the agenda of univer¬
sity managers.
For many countries, if not most,
higher education has been supported
almost exclusively by public funds as
a matter of tradition. For them the
development of new relationships
between university and state will not
be so difficult but they are already
experiencing the effects of the pub¬
lic demand that their governments
exercise tighter control over academic
expenditures.
For those countries where a large
part of higher education has been
privately financed, as in the case of
the United States, Japan and India, an
increased dependence on public funds
creates a brand of academic trauma.
To surrender independence because
of financial need is rarely a graceful
exercise.
The third crisis is that of relevance.
Several points are important here.
The first is that traditional education
offers little nourishment for the most
crucial needs of new countries, or for
the needs of some older countries
now in the process of modernization.
The Latin American universities, for
example, with their heavy emphasis
on law, medicine and letters, have not
seemed completely relevant to the new
thrust of student demands for appro¬
priate preparation for the managing of
societies that are both democratic and
technologically sophisticated.
In the U.S. as well as other countries,
it is the students who have presented
the university with the third crisis of
the relevance of its curriculum. The
problem of relevant curricula comes
under two headings. First is the rele¬
vance of general subject matter: that
is, a better balance of humanities,
social sciences, and sciences that
most universities have provided or are
even now prepared to provide. A
second problem is the applicability of
the education received. An educa¬
tional system may offer a balanced
diet of the three large disciplinary
areas but still all of them at such an
abstract level that students would find
their needs not met.
So in addition to a balanced curri¬
culum among the three great fields
of knowledge, universities are also
under pressure to provide a balance
between basic and applied studies.
Obviously the newer the country the
more pressing are the demands for
applicable knowledge, while for the
mature countries a more balanced diet
between basic and applied work is
desirable.
But the problem of applied versus
basic, or relevant versus traditional
studies in the newer countries is not
an easy one to resolve. Applied
studies do not flourish very long unless
they are attached, in fairly close
proximity, to more abstract matters.
Most scholars realize that to do this
they must have connexions with
scholars in more mature countries.
There is, in this arrangement, a
great danger of a brand of intellectual
colonialism which will keep the newer
universities from ever rising to the
same level of sophistication and in¬
fluence as those in established
countries with which they have
developed connexions.
Finally, universities in developing
countries need such contacts almost
more than established universities,
but if they are to tilt their interest
too heavily toward the applied scien¬
ces they will cut themselves off from
some of the most vigorous intellectual
growth going on in other parts of the
world. The pressure for attention to
applied work remains and will probably
have to dominate the academic scene
in developing countries, but not at the
complete expense of attention to
traditional matters.
One other point needs to be made
about the matter of relevance. As the
numbers of students have Increased,
larger and wider cross sections of our
societies have been admitted to the
universities and many of today's
students are first-generation entrants
without any family tradition to prepare
them for the rigour of their studies.
In addition, many are from minority
groups or heretofore deprived groups
of their societies, and the immediate
utility of their university experience
has to be demonstrated not only to
them but to the families who can
ill spare them. The result has been
an insistence on the part of these new
classes of students at the university
that there be a direct and visible
demonstration that what they were
being taught had a direct connexion
with the agonies of the environments
from which they came.
In the United States this has been
most vividly witnessed by the demands
of many Black students for courses
that would help them improve the city
ghettos from which many had come.
In Latin America, the Indian from Bol¬
ivia, Colombia and Peru was demand¬
ing an education that would help
rescue him and his family from the
grinding poverty of his culture. In
less harsh tones, perhaps, this case
is being stated with greater and
greater emphasis by students coming
from the industrial cities of England
as well as the southern parts of Italy.
Even a casual observer will see the
connexion between numbers, costs
and relevance. To provide education
that is relevant to a variety of demands
is a costly business, while higher costs
require demonstrably higher relevance.
And as the university meets these
demands for relevance and offers
differentiated programmes, one can
expect an increased interest in univer¬
sity attendance, which will feed the
cycle of numbers, costs, and relevance.
This brings up one of the ironic
features of the current scene, namely,
that these crises are in large part the
result of the university's successful
adaptation to the needs of its various
publics. As the university succeeds,
its problems increase rather than
decrease.
B
UT even these three inter¬
related crises of costs, numbers and
relevance do not, by themselves,
determine the atmosphere in which
the university is struggling to per¬
form its mission today. By them¬
selves they would have produced
convulsions of major proportions and
the problems of adjustment would
have been severe. But there are
deeper matters at work that have
enormously complicated the busi¬
ness of university management which
brings us to the fourth crisis: the
crisis of the new priorities.
Somewhere in the beginning of the
Sixties, at least in the more develop¬
ed countries, the leading edge of these
societies shifted its social priorities
away from attention to affluence, full
employment, and peace-keeping by
military power, and toward more pre¬
occupation with justice for the minor¬
ities and the poor, the quality of
the environment, and peace-keeping
through the subordination of national
ambitions to the idea of the inter¬
national community. Not every country
has felt this shift in priorities in either
the same manner or the same degree.
But that some glacial change began
to take place during this past decade
is hard to deny.
One feature of this shift was the
adoption of the new priorities by the

### 56864: The Five crises of the university

young, while the adult world, with
vivid recollection of the Depression
and the two world wars, was not about
to abandon its deep concern for a
rising GNP and world peace by
military means if necessary.
Much has been made of the genera¬
tion gap, and while there has always
been such a gap, something new has
been added. As societies modernize,
the individual becomes free of both
restraints and duties imposed by tribe
and family. Modern society requires
mobility and encourages it. The young
are sent to school while the adults are
drawn into the whirlpool of profes¬
sional life. Thus the young are left
to create their own culture and their
own societies.
This disjunction of the generations
would have produced a whole variety
of complicated social problems even
if the pressing concerns for justice
and peace had not been adopted by
this new generation. But independence
fuelled by zeal, alienation fed by
distrust, separatism exaggerated by
fundamental difference in philosophy
all have served to present the uni¬
versities with problems that are not
just complex, but explosive. They are
explosive because the generations
coming to the university saw their
dissatisfactions, caused by numbers,
costs and relevance, through the red
glare of anger at the society of which
the university was an Increasingly
important part.
In these circumstances it was in¬
evitable that the university while try¬
ing to deal with its internal priorities
would find the new social concerns
of its students almost impossible to
resolve. They might be resolved if
the students were content to have the
university function as a neutral forum
in which these serious external prob¬
lems could be debated.
But having become so closely
identified with the society that support¬
ed it, the university, clearly, was not
only an instrument for Investigation,
but a target for opposition. This fourth
crisis of the university stems from a
schizophrenia not yet resolved
namely, whether the university is more
valuable as a neutral arena for inquiry
and debate, or more valuable as a
lever for social reform.
In general, when societies are divi¬
ded, universities have had difficulty in
establishing their neutrality, or at least
maintaining it, whereas when a society
has a substantial consensus on its
main priorities, university neutrality
becomes the more possible.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
the countries that have had the most
difficulty with their universities have
been those with the deepest divisions
in their social philosophies and social
programmes. Universities are struggl¬
ing today with this enormously complex
problem, which has become a heavily
political issue.
Most systems are trying to plot a
course between the two extremes of
neutrality and social activism by main¬
taining the maximum of independence
from society while also making
concessions to the new concerns in
admissions policy and curricular ven¬
tures. Numbers, costs, and relevance
are terribly important issues, but the
central question is, to reiterate, the
role and mission of the university: Is
it a neutral and protected arena for
free thought, or an instrument for
social betterment? The division of
opinion on this question has produced
a crisis that has inflamed the others.
Behind even the crisis of university
identity and mission there is another
and deeper crisis that imperils the
very idea of the university itself. This
fifth crisis is the new scepticism that
denies the possibility of objective,
rational thought. It would take a whole
book by itself to thread our way
through the complexities of this cen¬
tury and to trace the widening attack
on the rationality of man and even on
his potential for rationality.
Suffice it to say that the comfort¬
able Western belief that reasoning
man in a reasonable universe would
increasingly comprehend his environ¬
ment to the benefit of a better
evolution of mankind is a notion that
has less currency with each passing
year. In its place has risen a mysti¬
cism and a belief that somewhere
in the dark reaches of the mind, in
the senses and sensations, in feeling
rather than in thought, one is more
likely to find truth than in an objective
examination of the world around us.
All this has undermined one of the
central notions upon which the univers¬
ity is based that learning is cumula¬
tive and that the opportunity for
rational discourse is its raison d'être.
With these concepts under attack, the

on the average in the last ten years and is likely to double again

educational growth is at the level of higher education.

### 56864: The Five crises of the university

CRISES OF THE UNIVERSITIES (Continued)
Idea of the university itself is in
question.
In summary, therefore, the univers¬
ity is facing five crises the crisis of
numbers, the crisis of costs, the crisis
of relevance, the crisis of priorities,
and the crisis of scepticism.
Is it surprising therefore that the
problem of university governance is
both universal and pressing? Any
institution that had such a series of
interrelated crises placed on its agen¬
da within a relatively few years would
have staggered under the load. It is
one of the miracles of the century
that the university has survived at all.
A professor who comes on stage
briefly as a distinguished president,
rector, or vice-chancellor will not even
understand the problems in a short
tour of duty, let alone be able to
handle them.
Recent convulsions on the campuses
of the world have not made university
management an attractive next step
for the distinguished professor. Con¬
siderable tradition still protects the
professor in his classroom and
laboratory, but does not serve to
protect the president or rector in his
office.
Staffing, however, 'may turn out to
be the least of the difficulties in
university governance. The redis¬
tribution of power and responsibility
between students, faculty and the
administration is bound to preoccupy
those driven by concern for relevance
and for the new priorities.
Those who are caught up in the
current social revolution are demand¬
ing the university's participation and
are not likely to find the traditional
roles of faculty, students and adminis¬
tration to be congenial to their ob¬
jectives. It would be a great error to
assume that the current redistribution
of power rises merely out of the
maturing of the entering student body.
The real fuel for this demand for new
style of governance comes from those
who are dissatisfied with the curri¬
culum and who believe that new forms
of governance may be necessary to
redirect the university onto different
paths.
We have been inclined to think of
the crisis of the university as being
the crisis of governance. This may
be so, but we will not understand the
nature of the crisis of governance
unless we realize it is compounded of
five crises of numbers, costs, rele¬
vance, priorities and scepticism. No
new organization chart will be adequate
to embrace the considerations with
which universities must now deal.
Statesmanship of the highest order,
both in and out of the universities, will
be necessary if they are to fulfil their
historic mission in our new world.

general hydrological survey. The
Chad Basin project, which got under
way in 1966, is an outstanding example
of practical, scientific co-operation.
Another example is the study of
ground-water resources in the Northern
Sahara, which will cover the area under¬
lain by principal artesian aquifers in
Algeria and the Saharan area of
Tunisia. The study is In progress
under the auspices of the govern¬
ments of the two States, under an
agreement with UNDP, with Unesco
serving as executing agency.
Quite a different type of project is
the establishment of a Centre for Hy¬
draulics and Applied Hydrological Re¬
search at Ezeiza, Argentina. This also
will be assisted by UNDP, with Unesco
as executing agency. The overall
purpose is to build up within the
State facilities for advanced studies
and research in water science and to
apply the results to practical develop¬
ment projects.
An establishment with a similar pur¬
pose is the Institute for Hydrosciences
and Water Resources Technolog/ in
Iran, established by the Government
of Iran, assisted by UNDP, with
Unesco as the executing agency.
A considerable number of similar
and varied activities may be cited:
co-ordinated planning of International
Hydrological Decade activities by the
council of the five Nordic countries ;
research on uses of saline water for
Irrigation in Tunisia; world-wide re¬
search on the uses of radio-nuclides In
hydrology (led by the International
Atomic Energy Agency) ; the interstate
hydrometeorological study of Lake
Victoria, administered by the World
Meteorological Organization, which
also directs the development of the
Central American hydrometeorological
network; development of a flood-warn¬
ing system for the Mekong River
Basin; establishment of a Natural
Resources Institute in Iraq; and many
other activities.
Decade activities have exposed the
glaring Inadequacy of Information about
water in many parts of the world and
the depressingly retarded state of
some aspects of hydrology, the only
science that can translate raw data
into water information that can guide
action to conserve and use water.
Developing countries are anxious
to see construction machinery in
action on water-development projects.
International organizations that provide
project funds also want to see dirt
fly. Planning studies have generally
been heavily weighted toward en¬
gineering and economic feasibility and
minimally toward hydrological or eco¬
logical aspects. Possible unwanted
side effects have received little atten¬
tion. Consequently, some projects
have been over-designed, under-
designed or wrongly designed.
Over-design entails excessive costs
for construction. Under-design results
in failure to achieve maximum use of
resources. Wrong design can cause
either or both results, and it may lead
to projects failing.
Circumstances are now changing
and scientific studies are being author¬
ized and carried out in advance of
crystallization of plans and beginning
of construction. An example, already
mentioned, is the organized interna¬
tional study of the La Plata River basin
in South America, involving five na¬
tions and one of the world's great
rivers. Advance studies can save
many millions of dollars of construc¬
tion cost and greatly improve the
benefit/cost ratio of projects.
Developing countries have recog¬
nized the necessity for cultivating their
own hydrological competence and
establishing observation networks.
During the Decade, various govern¬
ments and universities, with the colla¬
boration and assistance of Unesco,
have established advance-level semes¬
ter-length special courses in hydrology
and water resources problems. Such
courses have been established in
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Israel, Italy,
Netherlands, Spain and Venezuela.
These are for foreign nationals.
In addition, Unesco, WMO and FAO,
in collaboration with other organiza¬
tions and universities, have sponsored
many seminar-type short courses in
hydrology, chiefly in countries of
Latin America and North Africa. Fur¬
ther, various universities in developed
countries have offered many scholar¬
ship to foreign nationals to enable
them to enrol in regular university
curricula oriented toward hydrology.
The International Hydrological
Decade has created a new awareness
among the nations of the world that
water problems are large and growing.
Thus the Decade is taking its proper
place among the many international
programmes that aim to improve the
lot of all men°in all places.

ARMENIA'S ANCIENT PAST

Last year marked the 2750th anniver¬

capital of Soviet Armenia. This year it
will be exactly nine centuries since
Greater Armenia lost its independence
(1070). However, those inhabitants
who did not wish to submit to the
Turanian hordes, founded in Cilicia the
kingdom of Lesser Armenia, the last
Christian state of the Orient, and ally
of the Crusaders.
An Indo-European people of Traco-
Phrygian origin, the Armenians are the
heirs to a very old civilization. Armenia
was the first Christian state in the
world. Despite ravages of all kinds the
country abounds in fortresses, churches
and monasteries. This would make a
fascinating subject for treatment in the
"Unesco Courier".

MONGOLIA 1969
Sir,
I found your article on "Mongolia"
(November 1969) interesting and, I am
afraid, rather disturbingly naive.
Authors Facknitz and Kostikov state
that the people of Mongolia were
nomads because, since all the land was
held by nobles and lamas, the nomads
were reluctant to farm, and the revo¬
lutionary saviours finally opened up the
land. However, since nomads generally
like being nomadic, this argument is
unconvincing. In Tibet, where a similar
situation previously existed, those peo¬
ple who wished to farm had no diffi¬
culty in doing so and certain advantages
existed if they did.
The authors' statement that "demands
of the lamas were heavy burdens" is
nonsense in the context of the religious
philosophy of the people. Every family
had at least one member who was a
monk and thus had a vested interest
in the monasteries. An assumed schism
between Vajrayana Buddhism and the
people is a typically non-Asian point
of view and is taken only by those who
have no understanding whatever of this
religion itself.
The authors say that due to the sparse
population there must be an increase in
farm mechanization. Then, in all
seriousness, they state, "the scarcity
of people combined with rapid indus¬
trialization has created a problem which
Is probably unique in Asia : more people
are needed to keep Mongolia's economic
boom going." So now they have to
increase the population to keep going
the production which, in the first place,
is supposed to be for the benefit of
the population. Is it possible that, if
production is not suited to the existing
population density, something is wrong
with the production method? This game
of "ring-around" gives rise to a very
serious question: which is of first im¬
portance, the sense of satisfaction and
well-being of the people, or the game
called "increasing the gross national
product?"
The authors extol the virtues of
rapidly-growing Ulan Bator and its
"rival" (is there a race?) Darkhan. They
measure the well-being of the people
in terms of the number of theatres, pre¬
fabricated buildings and jazz concerts
(which means that the people of London
and New York are the happiest in the
worldl)
Why do we continue to insist that
if only everyone would be like us they
would be better off . . . oblivious to the
fact that in "being like us" we have
poisoned our environment, alienated our
youth and brought mankind to the brink
of annihilation.

PIONEER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE
Sir,
After reading your number on the
International Labour Organization (July
1969), I would like to remind you that
something had already been done to
improve working conditions before the
ILO was founded in 1919. One of the
pioneers in this field was Daniel Le
Grand, an early 19th-century French
industrialist, who has been honoured
by the ILO with a commemorative pla¬
que at the International Labour Office
in Geneva. I feel that his efforts to
promote social justice should have been
mentioned, even though the results
were not apparent until later.
Pastor Stabenbordt
La Broque, Schirmeck, France
Daniel Le Grand (1783-1859) was the
owner of a silk factory at Ban de la
Roche, in Alsace. In 1841 he played
a leading part in drawing up a law
governing the employment of children
in France. In 1811, the English indus¬
trialist Robert Owen had reported on
the working conditions endured by
children in mines. Daniel Le Grand
followed up Owen's ideas and in 1818
called on statesmen attending the
Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle to introduce
in every country "measures to protect
workmen against the ignorance and
exploitation of which they are victims."
Between 1844 and 1859, Daniel Le Grand
drew up drafts of four international laws
aimed at improving working conditions.
Other French pioneers of social impro¬
vements include Louis Blanc, Pierre
Leroux, Auguste Blanqui, Constantin
Pecquer and Dr. Louis Villermé, author
of the disturbing survey on 'the phy¬
sical and moral state of workers In
cotton, wool and'silk factories" (1840).
Another pioneer of social reform was
Chancellor Bismarck in Germany. Bet¬
ween 1883 and 1887 he introduced laws
providing for social security, limiting
woman and child labour and establishing
maximum working hours Editor.
NEW GLOBAL HORIZONS
Sir,
In "The Student of Tomorrow a
New Global Horizon" (January 1970),
René Habachi's comments on our glo¬
bal upheaval, and changing attitudes
and requirements, are almost a reflec¬
tion of the Baha'i writings, which date
back to the last century.
These writings insist on everyone
having an adequate education, freed
from rote learning, in order that man
can learn truth for himself. They also
espouse many of the concepts on which
the U.N. and its agencies are now
founded, and many which have yet
to be implemented if we are to solve
our global dilemmas. These include the
acceptance of the World Court, a glo¬
bal currency, a world police force, an
international executive body, a single
working language etc.
Perhaps your excellent journal could
inform us further on these concepts.

WHY I READ THE
' UNESCO COURIER '
Sir,
I am attracted to the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" primarily because I believe in the
fundamental need for international co¬
operation, having supported first the
League of Nations and its successor
the United Nations	despite its present
mood of discord and despair.
My second reason is that I think
the magazine is itself worthy of support.
It is pleasant to hold and read, with its
excellent paper, print and quality of
illustration. Your colour work is magni¬
ficent and the clever use of the scien¬
tific photographs of the "Sculpture of
Vibrations" issue in December 1969
(I have not forgotten the meaning of
the "S" in your title), is worthy of
comment.
Similarly I have admired the excellent
reproductions of paintings and sculp¬
ture: I can recall the African masks,
your issues on Venice and Florence,
and the Far East. These issues alone
would justify my subscription, and I
trust you will continue these.
I think you should concentrate on
issues of international interest: I remem¬
ber articles dealing with pollution (air,
water, environment). You should attack
evils such as deliberate and careless
oil pollution from tankers at sea and
refineries and carriers on shore, for
these are not local troubles; supersonic
airplanes, for the nuisance of the sonic
boom troubles the many for the selfish
advantage of the few (what DO they
do with the time they save?).
Can we have a dispassionate assess¬
ment of agricultural herbicides: whether
it is better for the world to suffer food
shortages by their non-use; whether
the abolition of malaria in Sicily by the
use of DDT is balanced by the wiping
out of certain rare birds by the concen¬
tration of DDT in their eggs.
I like stories covering examples of
international co-operation: the Mekong
Delta scheme, the India-Pakistan water
control schemes, the Aswan Dam and
removal of the Abu Simbel temples.
Many of these, as well as other subjects
mentioned above, I know you have
covered.
I am not attempting to write your
journal for you; merely expressing my
views on the type of article I like and
will read.
