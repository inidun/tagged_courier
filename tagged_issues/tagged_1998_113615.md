“The Taliban are nothing but extremists,
soldiers who impose their will on the people
by force,”he said.“They are savages who do
not consider women human beings and have
relegated them to the rank of animals.” Dr.
Shams is married but has no children.“If by
some misfortune I had a daughter, w h at kind
of future would she have?”
S h a i m a ,2 0 , feels as if her future has been

S e ated beside Shaima is her mother,M a r
Gul.A school principle until 1996,she says,
“Our life has become a prison and my
d a u g h t e r ’s future will amount to wa s h i n g
c l o t h e s , cooking and doing housewo r k .
Women do not exist.To the Taliban,all they
are good for is having babies.”
A small radio hidden under laundry in a

### 113617: A Universal responsibility
Each of us is
responsible for
replacing the
logic of force
with the logic of
reason and
respect for the
views of others
E D I TO R I A L
October 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 9
O n the threshold of a new millennium,the issue of responsibility is taking on a new
dimension.Humankind is still beset by war and violence.It also faces new global
c h a l l e n g e s.The impact of human activity on our planet is so gr e at that for the firs t
time in recorded history, we may be approaching the point of no return .The widening
asymmetry within and between countries,environmental destruction and flourishing arms
sales raise doubts about many of civilizat i o n ’s values and standards. H ow can we handle
new global threats? History shows that no situation is hopeless if risks are identified early
enough.
The conflicts that have arisen since the end of the Cold War have erupted not as a
consequence of new freedoms but in reaction to earlier oppression or repression.S u s p i c i o n ,
intolerance and hatred built up over decades,even centuries. But alongside the armed strife
of recent ye a rs , humankind has begun to demonstrate a new skill in resolving confli c t s.
M o z a m b i q u e , El Salva d o r , the Philippines, the changes in South A f rica that would have
been inconceivable just a few years ago, the efforts for peace in the Middle East and, finally,
the beginnings of a settlement in Northern Ireland are all examples proving that conflict is
not inevitable. They demonstrate that breakthroughs to peace can be made by dialogue,
mediation,negotiation and imagination—not force.
T h at is why the transition from a culture of war to a culture of peace is the foremost
challenge as the twentieth century draws to a close.To succeed we—all of us,day in and day
out—must not only do away with approaches based on force and imposition, but profoundly
change cultural attitudes and daily behaviour.
We must use imagination and resolution to go to the roots of world problems and nip
conflicts in the bud or,better still,prevent them.Learning to live together means daring to
s h a r e ,d a ring to do things differently, d a ring to dream of a better, s a f e r , more just and humane
world.It also means having the resolve and courage to transform our dreams into reality.
Here I wish to underline the pivotal role of education in promoting a culture of peace.B y
education,I mean not only formal instruction in schools but also informal training within a
whole range of cultural institutions, including in the ve ry first place the family and the media.
Who will be responsible for changing the culture of war into a culture of peace?
Governments,parliaments,intergovernmental organizations,we might reply.The answer is
correct, but it is not the only one.The transformation cannot be achieved without the active
i nvo l vement of those with financial resources and influ e n c e .This answer would also be tru e ,
though only partly so. For in the final analysis, replacing the logic of force and confrontat i o n
with the logic of reason and respect for the views of others is a responsibility that belongs to
all nations and all citizens, to each of us no matter how gr e at or small the scope of our
individual responsibility.The challenge of promoting a culture of peace is so broad and far-
reaching that it can only be accomplished if it becomes a pri o rity for the entire United
Nations system.The dream of achieving a world without strife and violence is what led the
f o u n d e rs of UN E S C O to make saving future generations from the scourge of war the
organization’s prime goal.
The Mahatma Gandhi said, “In the midst of darkness, light preva i l s.” It is that light
which is spread by the democratic values enshrined in UN E S C O’s constitution: j u s t i c e ,f r e e d o m ,
equality and solidarity. n

### 113618: The Greenhouse gas trade
Climate change:
Judging by the number of unresolved
disagreements, the next round of negotiations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions looks like it
will be poisonous. Despite the initial consensus
formalized by the Kyoto Protocol signed in Japan
last December, major divisions remain. The
United States wants to postpone any reductions
in domestic energy consumption. Europe,
although dragging its feet, has shown greater
willingness to respect commitments made under
the Protocol. And the developing countries refuse
to sacrifice economic growth to reduce a global
threat for which they do not feel responsible
The greenhouse gas t ra d e
The Kyoto Protocol to cut carbon
emissions in industrialized countri e s
is increasingly understood not as an
e nvironmental agreement but perhaps as
one of the most significant trade
a greements of the century. G i ven the
e n o rmous stakes invo l ve d , it is in the
interest of developing countri e s , like India
and China, to fully explore the implicat i o n s
of the Protocol instead of succumbing to
We s t e rn pressure to accept it.
It is important to recognize that the
P r o t o c o l , signed in December 1997, s t i l l
marks a step forward in the wo r l d ’s resolve to
a rrest the problem of human-induced climat e
c h a n g e . This is of particular concern for
d e veloping countri e s , which are twice as
vulnerable to the resulting damage as
i n d u s t rialized nat i o n s , according to the
I n t e r g ove rnmental Panel on Climate Change
( I P C C ) , set up by the United Nations in
1 9 8 8 . S e veral commentat o rs , especially in
the We s t , h ave pointed out the Protocol’s
possible ineffectiveness. But it also neglects
the long-term interests of the current and
future generations of developing countries.
Under the Protocol, i n d u s t ri a l i z e d
c o u n t ries are expected to cut their ove r a l l
emissions by at least five percent below 1990
l e vels between 2008 and 2012.The problem
is that compliance has been reduced to a
n u m b e rs game in which countries promising
a higher “percentage reduction”are seen as
good playe rs and those arguing for lowe r
percentages are the difficult ones. This is a
smokescreen drawing attention away from
the real issue at stake: the heaviest emitters of
greenhouse gases, namely industri a l i z e d
c o u n t ri e s , can continue polluting through
an accounting system which allows them to
meet their promised emissions reductions
targets without actually reducing emissions.
The key to this accounting lies in the
b a s e - year calculations which help to
d e t e rmine the “assigned amount ” o f
greenhouse gases each country can emit. If a
c o u n t ry does not fully use its assigned
a m o u n t , it can then sell the remaining port i o n
to another country. High calculations could
give countries a head start in meeting their
“percentage requirements” l ater because they
simply phase out industries which we r e
grinding to a halt regardless of the Protocol.
This system offers a perve rse incentive
for developing countries to actually increase
their emissions as fast as possible so that if and
when they do set their base-year calculat i o n s ,
they too will have a head start in meeting
their percentage reductions.This is perhaps
the worst aspect of the Protocol:developing
c o u n t ries which move towards energy
e f f i c i e n cy in a big way today will find it harder
and more expensive to meet high percentage

t he d e b a t e h e a t s u p
“Meaningful part i c i p at i o n ” has prove n
to be a vague and perhaps misleading
concept in the Protocol. For example,
A rticle 12 ostensibly promotes Nort h - S o u t h
c o o p e r ation by setting up a Clean
D e velopment Mechanism (CDM) to
encourage industrialized countries to inve s t
in carbon-efficient technology in the South.
H owe ve r , the purpose of the CDM is not to
help the South but to explicitly “ a s s i s t ”
i n d u s t rialized countries to meet their
commitments to reduce emissions. U n d e r
the plan,d e veloping countries sell “ c e rt i fie d
r e d u c t i o n ” units to industrialized countri e s
and pri vate corp o r ations in exchange for
i nvestment in carbon-efficient progr a m m e s.
The units can be used as credits in the
“balance sheets” of the Protocol’s carbon
accounting system.
The CDM is riddled with moral and
economic loopholes.One can begin by asking
reductions later when base year emissions
are set. On the other hand, those countries
which continue using high-emission
technologies and fuels will find it relatively
easy to accept high percentage reductions
and as a result will look good in front of the
world.
“Meaningful
participation”
Yet despite this fatal we a k n e s s , the North is
putting tremendous pressure on deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to take part in the Protocol.U n i t e d
S t ates Vice President Al Gore could not have
been more direct when speaking to a press
conference in Kyoto on 8 December 1997:
“In order to sign an agr e e m e n t , or in order to
send an agreement to the Senat e , we must
h ave meaningful part i c i p ation by key
d e veloping countri e s.”
Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain* 
An iceberg detaches from Antarctica. Will global warming melt the polar ice caps?
if there is no other role for developing countri e s
in combating climate change than just helping
i n d u s t rialized countries meet their
c o m m i t m e n t s. It is important to realize that
under the scheme, i n d u s t rialized countri e s
need not change anything domestically by
i nvesting in projects in the South.
At the same time, the CDM offers the
N o rth a way of buying the part i c i p ation of
the South.But at what price? It is clearly in
the interest of the North to keep the prices of
“emission reduction”units as low as possible.
The US administrat i o n , for example, plans on
buying as many emission units as possible at
the cheapest cost. So it is not altogether
s u rp rising to find A m e rican authori t i e s
offering as little as $14 to $23 per tonne for
emissions credits. In contrast, a domestic
emission reduction programme is estimat e d
to run $125 per tonne.
The CDM is designed to ensure that the
North has the cheapest array of projects to
choose from in the South. Under the CDM,
numerous cert i fic ation agencies will assess
i n t e rnal compliance and report i n g
mechanisms of countries selling emission
reduction units. This will force deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to compete with each other in
p r oviding the North with the cheapest,m o s t
efficient portfolios of projects to invest in.
One thing is clear. C l i m ate change has
been taken out of the world of the
e nvironmental lobby and placed in the wo r l d
of money. The goal is now to trade this
commodity (emissions) without limits and
without the interference of prickly issues like
the property rights of the poor.
The cheap deal
may be the most expensive
N ow let us assume that this brokering system
works in the short term and deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries do move towards more energy-
efficient technologi e s. A longer-term
perspective raises important questions.The
more efficient these countries become the
less economic incentive there is for the
industrialized countries to invest in them.It
will eventually be cheaper for the North to

P L A N E T
12 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
Down with
P O P !
An anti-POP movement is gaining strength
around the world.Nothing much to do with
m u s i c ,t h o u g h .I t ’s a trend involving a hundred or
so countries which are negotiating over the
reduction or elimination of persistent organic
pollutants (POP), substances which are
considered to be some of the most dangerous
ever produced by humankind.
They include insecticides like DDT and
industrial by-products such as diox i n , h u g e
quantities of which are produced by wa s t e
i n c i n e ra t o r s, and fura n e, which is used as a
solvent in plastics or resinous material. E x p o s u r e
to POPs can cause cancer, damage the nervous
system and interfere with the immune system.
The United Nations Environment Progra m m e
( U N E P ) , which is co-ordinating the inter-
governmental talks, points out that there is now
broad agreement on the need to cut down on the
use of such toxic materials. But this surface
consensus cannot hide the disagreement
between rich and poor countries on the subject.
The industrialized nations have already banned
or restricted the use of various POPs, such as
DDT and several chlorine compounds.
Thirty-two countries in Europe and North
America even signed, at the end of June, t w o
m e m o randums on air pollution aimed at
strengthening these measures.The intention wa s
to step up the international anti-pollution
movement to avoid the consequences of the
“ g rasshopper effect,” whereby pollutants tra v e l
from one side of the globe to the other through
the air or in the sea.Only world-wide measures
can curb the effects of this on local populations.
Against this approach stand the poorer
c o u n t r i e s, which continue, for example, to use
DDT to fight malaria,which kills more than two
million people every year. They want the rich
countries to dip into their pockets to help them
use less harmful but often more costly
alternatives.
In short, the anti-POP campaign does not have
its song ready yet.The negotiating countries met
in Montreal,C a n a d a , in July and gave themselves
until the end of the century to finish writing the
score. n
The Kyoto Protocol was endorsed at
the eleventh hour on 10 December
1998 by representat i ves of some 150
g ove rnments after adding a final point.
Since they failed to reach a consensus on
s e veral key issues, they would negotiat e
them lat e r , in particular at the fourt h
conference of the signat o ries to the United
N ations Framework Convention on Climat e
Change in Buenos Aires from 2 to 13
N ove m b e r , 1 9 9 8 . But as the conference
n e a rs , those countries are still far from
a gr e e m e n t , j u d g ing by the heat e d
discussions during a preparat o ry meeting in
Bonn last June.
Under the Kyoto Protocol, t h e
i n d u s t rialized countries (called the A p p e n d i x
One states) will have to cut their ove r a l l
greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent,
generally  below 1990 leve l s , b e t ween now
and the period 2008-2012. H owe ve r , t h i s
o b j e c t i ve masks a wide range of different
commitments.The United States has agreed
to cut its emissions by eight per cent, t h e
European Union (with different targets for
different member stat e s ) , Switzerland and
most central and eastern European countri e s
by eight per cent and Japan and Canada by
six per cent.R u s s i a ,Ukraine and New Zealand
will be allowed to maintain  their curr e n t

emissions leve l s. Some countries will be
p e rmitted to increase them, including Norway
by one per cent,Australia  by eight per cent and
Iceland by as much as ten per cent.
But the United Stat e s , which accounts for
a p p r ox i m ately one-fifth of the wo r l d ’s
greenhouse gas emissions, has repeatedly said
it will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol unless
c e rtain conditions are met.Washington insists
on the “meaningful part i c i p at i o n ” o f
d e veloping countries (see preceding art i c l e )
as well as on the swift establishment of an
i n t e rn ational market to trade “ e m i s s i o n s
permits”.
This system, the details of which have not
yet been ironed out,is intended to encourage
some countries to cut their emissions below the
assigned levels so that they can then “ s e l l ”t h e
d i f f e r e n c e .T h at would entitle major energy
c o n s u m e rs such as the United States and
countries which would find it very expensive
to cut emissions, like Ja p a n , to “ bu y ” the ri g h t
to continue polluting at home from other
countries.
Their aim is to safeguard industri a l
competitiveness by avoiding costly outlays to
reduce emissions and, in some cases, t o
preserve an energy-guzzling lifestyle.
Sources close to the White House say the
Clinton administration is hoping to meet
taken any action at home—then there wo u l d
be pressure on developing countries to cut
back yet again on carbon dioxide emissions,
this time on their own and at a higher price.
So what form of institutional co-operat i o n
will be available then?
The CDM does not answer this question.
It leaves the future of North-South co-
o p e r ation on climate change up in the air.
Even worse,it allows current generations in
d e veloping countries to sell off cheaper
emissions-control options today, leaving an

A new name
for El Niño 
It originates in the tropical waters of the
Pa c i fic . In its wa ke it leaves a trail of fla t t e n e d
crops and homes, torrential downpours,
d r o u g h t , flo o d i n g , bursts of cold weather and
hurricane-force winds. . . . In recent times,
there has scarcely been a natural disaster for
which it has not been blamed. In Latin A m e r i c a
alone, it has been the cause of at least 900
deaths and of economic losses amounting to
more than $20 billion.
It is known as El Niño—“the little one”.Th i s
was the name given by Peruvian fis h e r m e n
because its effects were felt over the Christmas
period when,according to the Christian religion,
the infant Jesus was born.
Worried by such headlines in the press as “ E l
N i ñ o :B e wa r e ! ”or “ We are being threatened
by El Niño”, the Colombian Red Cross has
launched a campaign calling for this disastrous
phenomenon to be given another name.
And there was even greater anxiety with
the arrival of La Niña,a current related to El
Niño with equally devastating effects.
At the initiative of Colombia,the national
Red Cross societies of A r g e n t i n a ,B o l i v i a ,B ra z i l ,
Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru,Uruguay and
Venezuela have signed joint petitions stating,
“it has been observed that the children of
Latin American countries are being upset by
the fact that the word by which they are known
has come to be associated with destruction
and death.” For this reason they hoped that
“the public and the specialized agencies will
realize the harmful consequences of this
misuse of language.”
Roberto Liévano Pe r d o m o, v i c e - p r e s i d e n t
of the Colombian Red Cross, is the leader of
the movement aimed at having the term “ E l
N i ñ o ” replaced by “ Pa c i fic phenomenon”,a f t e r
the ocean in which it occurs.
H o w e v e r, some people claim—and they are
not entirely wrong—that the term “ Pa c i fic
p h e n o m e n o n ” could also give rise to
m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g , since it is a destructive
phenomenon that is not exactly “ p a c i fic ” .
Even so, outside Latin America and
Colombia in particular, where the new term
is already starting to be used, it is so far only
a declaration of intent, since the Wo r l d
Meteorological Organization (WMO) has not
officially recorded any petition to that effect.

commitment by buying permits from other
c o u n t ri e s , especially Russia, which under
the Protocol is only required to stabilize its
emissions ten ye a rs from now at the 1990

fallen due in large part to the country ’s
economic recession. S o
Russia has a surplus of
pollution credits that
does not result from a
real effort to cut
e m i s s i o n s.
When this “hot air,”
as the negotiat o rs call it,
goes on the market, it is
likely to push down the
p rice of perm i t s.T h at will
ease the pressure on the rich countries to inve s t
in more energy-efficient technologi e s. T h e
Europeans are quick to point this out in raising
doubts on the system’s long-term effective n e s s.
They cite A rticle 17 of the Kyoto Protocol,
which basically says that trade in perm i t s
should only supplement countries’efforts to
reduce their emissions but must not replace
them.
W h at will happen, they ask,when the “ h o t
a i r ” runs out and the price of permits rises on
the intern ational market, if by then in d i v i d u a l
c o u n t ries have not taken steps to reorganize
hard sectors such as transport? Europe wa n t s
to see the “ s u p p l e m e n t a ri t y ” issue at the centre
of the Buenos Aires negotiat i o n s.
S e veral observe rs say the European
c o u n t ries also fear a threat to industri a l
c o m p e t i t i veness and to the durability of their
economic model. E u r o p e
is wo rried that market
forces will eat away at their

looking to raise them to
make up for lower labour

generations.
The principles of this emissions trade will
be further elaborated at Nove m b e r ’s
Conference of Pa rties in Buenos A i r e s.T h i s
is the occasion,h owe ve r , to go a step furt h e r
in recognizing and building upon the
p rinciple of “equal per capita entitlements”
in which all individuals have the right to emit
the same amount of greenhouse gases.T h i s
s t r ategy would be used to calculate emissions
entitlements based on each country ’s
p o p u l at i o n . Not only would such a step be
globally just, but it would offer the best way
to move towards the ultimate objective of the
F r a m e work Convention on Climate Change
(the ori gins of the Kyoto Protocol), n a m e l y
the stabilization of the at m o s p h e ri c
c o n c e n t r ations of greenhouse gases. T h i s
equitable approach is far more effective
than the creat i ve accounting strategy of the
P r o t o c o l .
Discussions in Buenos Aires must also
take into account the rapid rate at which
d e veloping countries are gr ow i n g . If they did
accept the Protocol, they would have “ a s s i g n e d
a m o u n t s ”of emissions.H owe ve r ,it is unlikely
they could make full use of these entitlements
in the near future. I n s t e a d , an equitable and
e nvironmental solution lies in letting them
trade this unused entitlement later as their
economies deve l o p. This provision wo u l d
i m m e d i ately gi ve them the incentive to trade—
not merely to help industrialized countri e s
meet their targets—as well as to move towa r d s
a low-emissions development path in which the
trading benefits and options stay open as long
as possible.
This economic environment would help
c r e ate a global market for We s t e rn solar
energy technologi e s — f i rst in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries and then in industrialized nat i o n s —
to help kick-start the global transition towa r d s
zero-emissions technologi e s.The faster these
t e c h n o l o gies invade the energy sector, t h e
quicker the world would be able to avert the
t h r e at of climate change. In this way,
developing countries would, to use the US
p h r a s e , enter the most meaningful form of
participation. n

study guides, financial advice for tuition and
more—all without hours or energy wa s t e d
waiting in line. If seeing is believing, w hy
not wander over to the students’ centre for
a quick visit? A few keystrokes on the
I n t e rnet and you are there.
Welcome to the world of online
e d u c at i o n . Students around the globe can
enrol in classes like Temasek’s, which cover
e ve rything from engi n e e ring to tourism and
even an introduction to Japanese Katakana
characters.Time and distance are no longer
an obstacle to learn i n g, as students dow n l o a d
specially designed courses according to their
own schedules, with tutorials and extra
m at e rials available via e-mail, CD-roms and
electronic libraries open around the clock.
E x a m s ,p a p e rs and even pri vate consultat i o n s
with professors or other students are all done
within the comfort of home.
In the last year, virtual classrooms of all
shapes and sizes have been under
c o n s t ruction around the wo r l d ,o f f e ring ve ry
real solutions for unive rsities and training
institutes threatened by dwindling public
resources and students needing more fle x i b l e
c o u rse mat e rials and schedules to compete in
t o d ay ’s job market. M e x i c o ’s Monterey
Institute of Te c h n o l o g y, for example, i s
d e veloping online courses and import i n g
them from universities north of the border.
E ven the World Bank is getting invo l ved with
plans for a virtual university in Africa.And
while it is natural to find traditional distance
e d u c ation prov i d e rs such as UK Open
U n i ve rsity breaking into this new field,
p r e s t i gious brand-name schools are also
i nve s t i n g . Duke Unive rsity of the United
S t ates has proudly opened its “ G l o b a l
Executive MBA” to a hand-picked class of
mostly intern ational businesspeople with
tuiton at $85,000.
This new distance education is a far cry
from the lowly correspondence courses of
w w w. $ $ $ @o n l i n e.
The construction boom in “virtual classrooms” is leading universitites to find
new partners and competitors in the corporate world
the past, seen as a “ s e c o n d - c h a n c e ” for those
who couldn’t make it in or have access to
regular educational channels. It also
represents not just another learn i n g
o p p o rtunity but a promising new market for
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations and computer
c o rp o r at i o n s ,vying to provide the “ p i p i n g ” —
s atellite systems, computer plat f o rms for
a d m i n i s t r ation or “ s m a rt cards” o f f e ri n g
access to electronic libraries—to delive r
s e rvices far and wide. From Germ a ny to
M a l ay s i a ,t e l e c o m m u n i c ations and computer
giants are negotiating “ w i ri n g ” costs with
public and pri vate learning institutions,n ow
seen as new part n e rs for computer companies
like Microsoft and Apple.
Consider the case of We s t e rn Gove rn o rs
U n i ve rsity (WGU) formed in 1997 by a
group of gove rn o rs from the we s t e rn United
S t at e s. C o nvinced that education was fa i l i n g
to meet the needs of employe rs and students
alike,they created a virtual university which
distributes services (courses) developed by
a s s o c i ated unive rsities and corp o r ate training
p r o gr a m m e s. The real surp rise lies in its
National Advisory Board,a powerful mix of
s t ate representat i ves and business leaders
from companies like Microsoft,Apple,Sun
M i c r o s y s t e m s , IBM and above all AT & T,
(one of the wo r l d ’s largest
t e l e c o m m u n i c ations companies), which has
donated more than $750,000.With backing
like this,the governors are broadening their
h o ri z o n s , m oving beyond the local market
by brokering co-operative agreements with
ove rseas “ s u p p l i e rs ” — u n i ve rsities and
telecom companies—in Ja p a n , the United
Kingdom,Canada,Mexico and China.
“Globalization is a term that gets used a
l o t , but just like trade and commerce,
e d u c ation is becoming more and more
i n t e gr ated across national borders ,” s ay s
Reidar Roll of the non-profit International
Council for Distance Education (ICDE),
which includes learning institutes and
c o rp o r ations in more than 130 countri e s.
“ We are beginning to see a more global
education market.”
Roll doesn’t seem to question the rise of
this “market”—a battle cry for those who see
education as a public responsibility and not
a commodity.Yet in this new electronic age of
distance educat i o n , the fine line between the
private and public sectors has been blurred
from the start .While unive rsities did much of
the research and development making online
l e a rning technologically possible—often with
c o rp o r ate support—it is the pri vate sector
which supplies the pieces needed to bu i l d
the virtual campus.
E ven the course content is market-based.
Online students are for the most part not
looking for philosophy or art history classes
but professional training in areas like bu s i n e s s
m a n a g e m e n t , financial serv i c e s , E n g l i s h ,
i n f o rm ation technologi e s , teaching and health
sciences.
In short , the incredible potential for
online learning lies in the insecurity of today ’s
job market as the eve r - s h o rtening shelf-life of
knowledge forces the “professionally fit”to
continually upgrade their skills. In Finland,
for example, 45% of employed adults
b e t ween the ages of 25 to 64 take part in
some form of career-related continuing
e d u c ation and training during a ye a r ,
according to a 1997 survey by the
O r g a n i s ation for Economic Co-operat i o n
and Development (OECD). E ven Canada’s
l ow rate of 28 per cent still represents
considerable demand.
“ People want to acquire the skills that
are applicable and enhance their mobility,”

field and consultant for the OECD. “ I n

English in numbers we haven’t seen before.
Until last ye a r ’s curr e n cy cri s i s , Asia was a
huge growth area,with more than 50 MBA
p r o grammes being offered in Hong Kong
alone,many by distance means.”
At the same time, r e gional trade
agreements in North America,Europe and
Southeast Asia are opening the door to free
trade in educational services,particularly in
professional training, which is considered
less sensitive than pri m a ry or secondary
schooling in terms of national autonomy.
“Education is considered a service like any
o t h e r ,”s ays a legal officer of the World Tr a d e
O r g a n i z at i o n , who points out that 30
c o u n t ri e s , from Ghana to Norway and
R wa n d a , h ave signed on to the General
A greement on Trade in Services (GAT S )
with specific commitments assuring foreign
p r ov i d e rs fair access to their educat i o n a l
markets.
A new market
in grey matter
For better or wo rs e , free trade in online
education is still far from a reality.A battery
of barri e rs or bu f f e rs—depending on yo u r
point of view—is firmly in place. To begi n
w i t h , academic accreditation systems are still
the preserve of national authorities and so
va ry gr e atly from one country to the next.
The lack of technological standards is another
obstacle in delive ring education from one
country or region to another.
At the same time, financial questions
remain on issues like taxation and intellectual
p r o p e rt y.For example, should an A u s t r a l i a n
c o m p a ny pay local revenue taxes for cours e s
sold in Malaysia? Or consider the case of
Mexican students attending a Canadian
u n i ve rs i t y.They usually pay higher admission
fees than local tax-paying students. Should
the same rules apply to their online
c o m p at riots? Finally, h ow can teachers
protect their intellectual property rights on
c o u rses and mat e rials beamed around the
world?
A long list of task forces and forums is
working in unive rsities and intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z ations to tackle these thorny issues.A t
the same time, the pri vate sector is more than
willing to help, by offering grants,technical
advice and other forms of support to ensure
a free flow of services.
Online learning is revolutionizing education as computer and telecommunications companies seek to develop this
new market.

Sp a n i s h
Young Brazilians can no longer be content
with learning only English; they have to learn
Spanish as well.This view,advocated by Senator
José Forgaça of the Brazilian Democra t i c
Movement Party (PMDB), has been supported
by the upper chamber of Congress, w h i c h
approved a draft law that will make it mandatory
to teach Spanish in all the country’s government
secondary schools.
According to the ministry of education, t h e
project will enrol some 6.5 million pupils and
require at least 200,000 teachers. That is why
the bill,originally drafted by a former president
and current senator, Itamar Fra n c o, will be
introduced only gradually over a five-year period.
The idea of making it compulsory to learn
S p a n i s h ,which is still awaiting final congressional
a p p r o va l , has been evolving. Senator Pe d r o
S i m ó n , also a member of the PMDB,proposed in
1995 that learning Spanish should be made
o b l i g a t o r y, although only in the states bordering
U r u g u a y, Pa raguay and Argentina which, l i ke
B ra z i l , are members of the Southern Common
Market (MERCOSUR).
In fact,ever since Brazil joined MERCOSUR,
Spanish has clearly gained ground.Classes are
in demand in the private schools that have been
sprouting like mushrooms in the country’s main
c i t i e s. M e a n w h i l e, p o r t u ñ a l, a hybrid of
Portuguese and Spanish,has become a working
language commonly used in diplomatic circles in
Brasilia and business spheres of São Paulo.
The project is not merely a question of
education but involves considerable economic
i n t e r e s t s.According to Senator Fo g a ç a , the new
law “will be instrumental in forming a true Latin
American community”which will more than ever
integrate Brazil, the only Portuguese-speaking
giant in an otherwise Spanish-speaking region.
S p a n i s h , the official language of 21 countries
and spoken by 413 million people, is the world’s
fourth most widely spoken tongue after Chinese,
English and Hindi.It is also gaining ground as a
second language in the United States. n
While it is too soon for any accurat e
forecasts of the online education market—
e s t i m ates va ry from one to four billion dollars
for the year 2000—there are gr owing fears
t h at companies will eventually take over the
role of learning institutes. “If Microsoft
wanted to, they could create a unive rsity to
c o m p e t e ,” s ays Roll of ICDE.“Or if Harva r d
wanted to, they could enter alliances to offer
them (the companies) a brand name on the
i n t e rn ational market. I think the plans are
t h e r e .”
Not so fa s t , s ays Jim Ku h r , manager of
Microsoft’s worldwide education activities.
“ We don’t see ours e l ves as an educat i o n a l
c o m p a ny — we are not experts in curri c u l u m
or pedagogy.Our focus has been to work with
p a rt n e rs who are specialists
in that.But we do have an
interest in providing the
i n f r a s t ructure pieces—like
n e t work operating systems,
share files and e-mail—
needed to make distance
learning successful.”
While Kuhr recognizes
brand-name unive rsities as
obvious marketing targets,
the real heav y weights may
lie in developing countri e s
in Asia and Latin A m e ri c a .
“The enrolment potential is going up so
d r a m atically that the gove rnments cannot
afford to build the brick and mort a r
campuses to meet the demand. T h e s e
g ove rnments see online learning and other
o p p o rtunities in the inform ation society as a
way to radically move their countries ahead—
t h at is, if they find the initial investment for
i n f r a s t ru c t u r e .”
In fa c t , “ w i ri n g ” is becoming less of a
financial burden as telecom prices fall with
deregulation.And with the current spate of
m e r g e rs transforming the industry, n e w
markets like online education are becoming
all the more competitive.
AT & T ’s interest in online education is
“ m u l t i - l aye r e d ” ,according to Marilyn Reznick
of the telecom gi a n t ’s philanthropic
f o u n d at i o n .“ We have a responsibility to make
sure that people can understand the
t e c h n o l o gies we deve l o p. It is also in our
interest to send our philanthropic dollars to
u n i ve rsities where we do bu s i n e s s , r e c ru i t
p e o p l e , train our employees and do our R&D.”
“ We might also go to a unive rsity with
which we have relations and ask, ‘are yo u
going to provide the wo r k e rs we need?’ I f
n o t , we will help provide the resources to
d e velop that training. But we would neve r
dream of telling them how to teach.We are
not competing with them.”
A sigh of relief from the ivory towers? “I
am not sure that any corp o r ation will tell yo u
their strat e g y,” s ays To ny Bat e s , director of
the Distance Education and Technology unit
of Canada’s Unive rsity of British Columbia.
“And if they did, that strategy may change.
For instance, we are actually making a profit
on some of our online courses.Who knows
what will happen once that gets out.”
The secret to the unive rs i t y ’s success lies
in cherry-picking and niche-marketing.“To
offer a basic microbiology course, we would
need some competitive advantage over the
rest of the world,like a Nobel Prize winner,
which we don’t have.But with our contacts
in the forestry department, we are offering
c o u rses in wood science, for example, i n
Indonesia and A u s t r a l i a , where there is an
e m e r ging regional market
in secondary wo o d
products.
“All of this sounds like
someone trying to run a
bu s i n e s s , and I am
s u rp rised to find my s e l f
liking this role,” s ays Bat e s.
“This is in response to a
g ove rnment which tells us
to be less dependent on
t a xe s. This is not an
inevitable result of market
forces but a political
decision.”
H owe ve r , there is a fine line betwe e n
p r o fit-making and becoming profit - d ri ve n .
“ You have to ask,‘ w h at is the role of a publicly
funded college?” s ays Bat e s.“It is difficult to
justify tax dollars spent on education if the
p ri vate sector can do the job as well as the
public sector. But I think the public needs
some independent critique and analysis of
the government and private sector policies.
Somebody has to have the independence to
ask who is benefiting in a society.”
There is also a question of equity. “ T h e r e
are areas that you just cannot make money
o n , like education for the handicapped or
social work cours e s. T h at is where the
g ove rnment has to step in to ensure that all
s e c t o rs of society are served as much as
p o s s i b l e .” n

Human rights:
the struggle
continues
Respect for human rights has come a long way, some say.
Others argue that they are still flouted almost everywhere,
and that the return of unbridled market forces around the
globe threatens the strides made in the past half-century.
Progress here, setbacks there, new demands everywhere. As
the world changes, who is fighting to defend human dignity
and fulfil the universal aspiration to a better life? And how?
What are states, citizens and international bodies doing to
promote rights that too many people still do not enjoy? Is
globalization making the struggle easier or more difficult?
One thing is sure: the long battle for “all rights for
everyone” is far from over.

The world is going through a period of fa r -
reaching upheaval.Armed conflicts, flagrant
and systematic violations of human rights and
the denial of fundamental freedoms continue to make
headlines in various parts of the globe.
W h at parameters would help us take stock of the
c u rrent situation regarding these rights and freedoms?
Let us deliberately leave aside the quantitat i ve view of
t h i n g s , which sets out to put a figure on the violat i o n s
and outrages committed eve ry day. This sort of
g u e s swork is misleading, for there can be no doubt that
there are countless situations midway between the
absence of killing, abduction and arbitrary detention
and the wholesale application of human ri g h t s —
s i t u ations where the fact that no crime has been
committed does not necessarily mean that justice
prevails. Intimidation and blackmail can also create
a semblance of order.

Major tre a t i e s,
mixed re s u l t s
If all the United Nations’ member states decided
to observe the international rules on human
rights enacted since the 1948 Universal
D e c l a ra t i o n , their citizens would be protected from
the vagaries of arbitrary power.Tens of conventions,
covenants and declarations aimed at protecting
individuals and groups from political and economic
violence have been signed and ratified in the last
half-century.
Yet living conditions are deteriorating for much
of the world’s population. C o n t rary to what that
might suggest, since the early 1950s the United
Nations has undertaken efforts to strengthen
international legislation with regard to economic
and social rights.Those are the areas covered by the
first treaties, including the Freedom of Association and
Protection of the Right to Organise Convention
( 1 9 4 8 ) , which was soon followed by the Equal
R e m u n e ration Convention (1951) and the
Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labour (1957).
Civil rights have not been left out. The Geneva
Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of
War was signed in 1949 and the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination adopted in 1965.International texts
also upheld women’s rights very early on.They include
the 1952 Convention on the Political Rights of
Women and the 1962 Convention on Consent to
M a r r i a g e, Minimum Age for Marriage and
R e g i s t ration of Marriages.
But it took the United Nations until 1966 to
adopt two crucial texts, the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and the International
Covenant on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights.
Since then, international normative action on
human rights has continued making headwa y,
from the Convention on the Elimination of All Fo r m s
of Discrimination against Women (1979) to the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
(1984) and the Convention on the Rights of the
C h i l d , which was unanimously adopted in 1989. I n
addition to the 1948 Universal Declara t i o n , t h e
two covenants of 1966 and countless non-binding
d e c l a ra t i o n s, over 30 conventions have been
adopted since 1968.
Most states have signed and ra t i fied these texts,
which they are bound to observe. But that does
not mean they do,especially since they may exercise
their right to opt out of certain clauses while
agreeing to others. For example, almost all the
Muslim countries have expressed reservations on
the conventions relative to women, e f f e c t i v e l y
making those texts meaningless. Very few states
have agreed to conventions in their entirety and
i n c o r p o rated their provisions into national
l e g i s l a t i o n .The rest have reluctantly signed on and
use all the international procedures at their disposal
to make them null and void at home. n
U n i ve rsal Declaration which continues to be the
source of inspiration and the standard by which we
measure our successes.There is not a single country
t h at denies its validity and all countries have
subscribed to it.Yet,does this signify anything more
than mere formal recognition? When countries rat i f y
the Universal Declaration,they agree to implement
the rights explicitly set forth in its articles,to ensure
t h at they are applied and to sanction those who violat e
t h e m . There is a tendency all over the world to
i n c o rp o r ate these intern ational legal instruments into
n ational law. But the weakness of national judicial
systems and the widespread corruption of political
a u t h o rities are such that the effective application of
these intern ational instruments is nothing more than
a mere aspirat i o n .T h u s , it is not so much the existence
of constitutional texts which defines democracy bu t
the establishment of the rule of law,with authorities and
means of recours e , which guarantee their applicat i o n
for the benefit of citizens.
Even so, in the face of critical and vigilant public
opinion no country, g ove rnment or political, m i l i t a ry
or judicial authority would now go so far as to deny
the existence of these fundamental ri g h t s. I n d e e d ,
the most significant progress made in recent ye a rs
lies in the level of awareness attained by millions of
individuals all over the wo r l d . As we have seen in
many peasant communities in the Andean region of
L atin A m e ri c a , citizens of the most fa r - flung corn e rs
of the earth who have never heard of the Universal
Declaration still demand “human rights”.
The existence, d ri ve and combat i ve spirit of
thousands of associat i o n s — r a n ging from the relat i ve s
of victims of violations to organizations with an
i n t e rn ational scope of activity—have led to victory
in battles which seemed doomed.We are witnessing
the emergence of a global human rights culture based
on implicit recognition of the fact that citizens’
o r g a n i z ations exercise the right to keep watch over the
behaviour of states.
This increasingly keen awareness on the part of
civil society is bound to have an impact on gove rn m e n t
policies and lays the gr o u n d work for adva n c i n g
i n t e rn ational legal machinery and instru m e n t s. O n e
obvious example is wo m e n ’s struggle to ove r c o m e
d i s c ri m i n at i o n .The United Nat i o n s ’ adoption in
1967 of a special declaration  on wo m e n ’s
rights, as well as the Beijing Conference
and the implementation of the measures
resulting from it, are some of the
i n t e rn ational milestones in the
social advancement of wo m e n .
They are largely due to the work
of activists in the field.
H owe ve r , the emergence of a
worldwide ethical awareness is
accompanied by new social

the planet’s political and economic landscape. S o m e
of the most blatant features include the stepped-up
pace of globalizat i o n , the prominence gi ven to market
forces at the expense of their social and gove rn m e n t a l
r e g u l at i o n , the superi o rity of productivity and
c o m p e t i t i veness over equity, the weakening of the
n at i o n - s t ate and the creation of new economic blocs.
For the moment,g l o b a l i z ation has not meant that
e ve rybody has access to common unive rsal va l u e s.
While exacerbating social exclusion and division, it is
also fostering a context conducive to the strengthening
of intern ational mechanisms for
protecting human ri g h t s.T h at is one of
the main ambiguities of the present
s i t u ation which will have to be borne in
mind in the future, since it is changi n g
people’s perceptions of their rights as
well as the environment in which they
can be exercised.
The question ari s e s ,t h e n ,w h e t h e r
basic freedoms and rights have made
a ny significant progress in the past ten
ye a rs of liberal cru s a d i n g . G e n e r a l l y
speaking, the answer is “no”, among
other things because the strong state is
being replaced not so much by a small
and efficient state as by a weak one,which tends to
g ove rn on the basis of political corruption and
cronyism.
In this new context, it is necessary to highlight
t wo aspects essential to the progress of human ri g h t s
in the wo r l d : the struggle to prevent human ri g h t s
v i o l ations from going unpunished and the recognition
of the indivisible nature of those rights.
It is common to find judicial and propaganda
m a n o e u v r e s , often illegal and violent, aimed at
protecting the intellectual, p hysical or political
a u t h o rs of dreadful crimes committed against
individuals and humanity. Impunity has come to be
granted by law, so that military authorities are
e x o n e r ated from responsibility. In most cases, t h e
granting of impunity has been the outcome of
n e g o t i ations between democratically elected
g ove rnments and soldiers surr e n d e ring powe r , o r
b e t ween rebel military organizations and transition
g ove rnments after periods of domestic violence.T h i s
was the case between the guerrillas of El Salvador and
G u atemala and their respective gove rnments and
a rmed forces. Practical steps must be taken to do
away with the problem of impunity,
so that the truth will be know n ,j u s t i c e
done and appropri ate compensat i o n
granted to the victims or their relat i ve s.
To turn the page, it must be read
b e f o r e h a n d .
This is likewise related to the
establishment of a new intern at i o n a l
o r d e r , since the mechanisms of
impunity and arbitrariness also act at
the intern ational leve l . The major
p owe rs often change the rules according
to their political interests or economic
i m p e r at i ves by condemning or
pardoning the crimes committed by
c o u n t ri e s , depending on whether they are “ e n e m i e s ”
or potential “ a l l i e s ” .
The principle of indivisibility implies,in the first
p l a c e , rejection of a ranking order of human ri g h t s ,a s
well as recognition of the give-and-take relationship
b e t ween individual freedoms and the conditions
essential for exercising them.In this sense, one of the
most disturbing new trends is the loss of economic,
social and cultural rights affecting wo r k e rs in almost
e ve ry country.The decline in earning leve l s ,d e p l o r a b l e
working conditions, instability and the loss of we l fa r e
b e n e fits by millions of people, all of which are refle c t e d
in gr owing social exclusion, are a significant step
b a c k wa r d s. U n d e r d e velopment creates a climat e
c o n d u c i ve to violations of fundamental rights and
inhibits the emergence of a civil society capable of
entering into dialogue with the state.Not only does
this foster individualism or an “ e ve ry man for himself”
at t i t u d e , but it hinders the development of legal
protection existing for civil and political rights.
The fiftieth annive rs a ry of the Unive rs a l
D e c l a r ation on 10 December 1998 affords an
o p p o rtunity to consider the gains made and to renew
the pledge of the intern ational community and
citizens to engage in the enormous task before us.
N e w s p a p e rs and television remind us that there is no
reason for complacency or self-sat i s fa c t i o n .T h e r e
are, however, grounds for hope in the effective and
increasingly forceful mobilization of human ri g h t s
activists in national leagues or intern at i o n a l
o r g a n i z at i o n s , often at the risk of their live s. T h i s
confirms that people are no longer prepared to leave
the fulfilment of their aspirations for a more just,
f r at e rnal and caring world to gove rnments or
international authorities. n

What kind of world are we living in today?
The start of the 1990s saw the collapse
of a global system divided into two spheres
of influ e n c e , whose only merit was that it managed to
c i r c u m s c ribe conflicts geographically for almost half
a century. But the world of the 1945  Yalta A gr e e m e n t
was rooted in terror.
In 1989 and 1990, the geopolitical system
c h a n g e d , but no new planetary vision emerged to fil l
the resulting gap.Those who thought at the time that
communism would automatically be replaced
e ve rywhere by democracy were wrong. Instead it wa s
nationalism,containing the seeds of ethnic tension,
which thri ved in the ruins of the old system.T h e
result has been an increase in the number of confli c t s
whose perp e t r at o rs escape unpunished if their actions
happen to fit the interests of the main forces at wo r k .
For the old practice of double standards—a
m o d u l ated assessment of how basic human ri g h t s
are respected in different countries—has hardly been
affected by the upheavals of the late 1980s.The 1990s
h ave marked a geopolitical transition, but nobody
has been able to respond to the new imbalances by
replacing, as far as possible,the force of arms by the
force of law.
So human rights and democracy have not adva n c e d
ve ry far as a result of the change of scene.Despite more
and more declarations and seminars on the subject, t h e y
are still not an important factor in the conduct of
i n t e rn ational relat i o n s.You still do not  have to be a
d e m o c r at to be have friends in the We s t . Before 1990,
it was enough to be anti-communist to be one of our
a l l i e s.This meant that when communism collapsed,we
were landed with a number of “ f ri e n d s ”who were both
useless and unpresentable.
Then there was the “ a n t i - t e rr o ri s t ”l a b e l .Te rr o ri s m
e x i s t s , of cours e ,and it is dangerous,but it was enough
to proclaim oneself anti-terr o rist to become one of our
f ri e n d s. I r a q ’s Saddam Hussein, backed beyond all
l o gic because he was fighting a “ t e rr o ri s t ” c o u n t ry
( I r a n ) , symbolized this new blindness in the 1980s.
These days, to be a friend of the West, you just
need to apply the rules of good governance and the
market economy. The problem is that in each case
the condition for winning Western support may be
just,and even necessary, but it is never sufficient.
At the same time, we have come up with more
and more excuses for democracy supposedly not
being possible.This is seen, for example, by claiming
that Africa is too poor to be democratic or by giving
a stamp of approval,especially in Asia,to the alibi of
cultural relativism—something which is totally
contradicted by the facts.As soon as they are given a
c h o i c e , Asians behave like eve ryone else. In 1992,
the people of Myanmar voted overwhelmingly for
Aung San Suu Kyi and against the military regime.
The ultimate altar on which we are ready to
s a c ri fice what e ver necessary is that of stability, a much
more presentable notion than a straightforwa r d
defense of our economic interests.There again, the
West is prepared to hand out good conduct cert i fic at e s
to those who look as if they can guarantee this.War is
obviously a big obstacle to deve l o p m e n t , but bewa r e
of the stability of graveyards.
So we go on making sacri fices to “ r e a l p o l i t i k ” .

22 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
Only the excuses we make for it have changed—
ye s t e r d ay it was anti-communism, t o d ay it is good
g ove rn a n c e . But is this truly realpolitik? Are we not in
reality yielding to an authoritarian illusion by being
more attracted to strong leaders than to solid
institutions?
The best example of this perve rsion is found in the
attitudes we have long had towards the Asian “ t i g e r ”
c o u n t ries and which are based exclusively on their
economic perform a n c e . It is wrong to insist, as people
d o, t h at economic gr owth automatically leads to
d e m o c r a cy. In many Asian countri e s , the kind of
gr owth policies chosen have not only underm i n e d
the chances for sustainable development but have
also reduced the possibilities of a non-violent and
legal transition to democracy.
But we do not learn the lessons of history.We had
barely stopped fooling ours e l ves about the A s i a n
“ t i g e rs ” when we came up with A f rican “ l i o n s ” —
countries where nobody says a word about the fact
t h at these new friends of ours ban political part i e s
or that some of them have even developed the quaint
notion of “democracy without parties”.
Double standards are a vital tool in this conception
of realpolitik.Ye s t e r d ay ’s enemy can become today ’s
best fri e n d , as our pri o rities change. But to my mind
true realpolitik cannot be reduced to these kinds of
c o n t o rt i o n s.Only a diplomacy based on simple va l u e s
recognized by everyone—including democracy and
respect for basic human rights—can be conducted
in the long term and defended with any dignity before
the whole world.
“Realists” are wrong when they say we must
choose between realpolitik and idealism.If a policy
is to be sustainable, it must based on an ideal.
Taking into account the extent of our economic
and political interests, I am convinced that it is in
our interest to promote democracy. Development
of economic relations calls for stability. A n d
democratic institutions are infinitely more stable
than dictatorships.
So we have to come up with new ways of coping
with geopolitical and economic constraints.W h at we
in the European Union call critical dialogue allows us
to use a panoply of diplomatic tools without resort i n g
s y s t e m atically to sanctions and isolation in a va i n
attempt to bring certain dictat o rships to heel. A n
embargo on technology can be effective , but no
d i c t ator has ever been troubled by an embargo on
food or medical supplies. Such drastic embargoes
can in fact stir up nationalist resentment among the
people who suffer under them.
Sanctions are certainly an instrument in
international relations and should be used when all
attempts at dialogue have been exhausted,but only as
one of the last resorts,when a display of firmness is
needed as part of a dialogue.
Europe has withdrawn from Afghanistan because
a ny talks with the Taliban are fruitless right now.O u r
presence there was just an alibi for them from the
moment when humanitarian organizations we r e
p r e vented from working in the country.E l s e w h e r e ,i t
is not yet time to slam the door. Leaving a country
should be the very last step in our policy.
Such a process can get bad press because it can
n e ver be straightforwa r d . It is a method which
uses gradual steps and needs to be explained
thoroughly to be clearly unders t o o d . The other
p a rty or adve rs a ry, along with public o p i n i o n ,h a s
to be kept continually informed as to what stage
discussions are at .
This is the only way we can avoid being accused
of once again using a double standard by imposing
sanctions on some and not on others.The problem is
t h at our diplomatic practices and the absence of a
common European foreign policy means we have no
clear and effective positions on these matters.
The big challenge as the end of the century
approaches is therefore to change the meaning we
h ave gi ven to realpolitik. This would be a real
cultural revo l u t i o n . We shall not be able to do it
ove rn i g h t . If we were to break off relations with eve ry
c o u n t ry which violated human ri g h t s , we would no
longer have links with about three-quart e rs of the
wo r l d ’s gove rn m e n t s.We could even find reasons
to break off relations with some European
c o u n t ri e s.
Respect for human rights is something which
grows one day at a time.Unfortunately, the political
establishment in developed countries hardly considers
it a pri o rity and major political parties are deafeningly
silent on such issues.Their silence weakens democracy
e ve ry w h e r e , including in our own countri e s. It is time
for us to make a bigger place for the rule of law in
politics.
An intern ational policy based on respect for law s ,
a greements and rules is the only one possible. We
must know its intricacies so we can promote it with
e ve ry passing day. The journey is a slow one, bu t
progress is being made.
The two ad hoc tri bunals on former Yu g o s l avia and
R wanda have chalked up modest successes, bu t
successes all the same. Perpetrators of genocide and
other war criminals can no longer mock the
international community.As human rights activists,
we must draw strength from these achievements so we
can prove wrong those who favour a short - s i g h t e d
r e a l p o l i t i k . I am convinced there is no other way
forward. n
An international
policy based on
respect for laws,
agreements and

‘A tendency towa r d s
t y ranny and mutual
oppression is an innate
part of human nature.’
Ibn Khaldoun,
1332-1406, North Africa
Bosnia,1995: refugees from
Srebrenica arriving in Tuzla. Be t ween the Leninakan earthquake in
December 1988 and the Gulf War in 1991,
the world seemed to have undergone a
fundamental change. A global society was said to
be emerging with a “new intern at i o n a l
h u m a n i t a rian order”.The United Nations General
Assembly adopted its earliest resolutions on
h u m a n i t a rian assistance just a few days before
the first intervention of this kind on Soviet soil after
the deadly tremor in A rm e n i a .The following ye a r
opened a new era, with the fall of the Berlin wa l l ,
the rising number of pro-democracy move m e n t s
in A f rica and Security Council resolutions
imposing the help of humanitarian organizat i o n s
to save the Kurds of Iraq.The end of the Cold Wa r
was supposed to usher in an epoch of peace and
d e m o c r a cy made possible and strengthened by
the inform ation revo l u t i o n .
The possibility of “ s e e i n g ” world events unfold
l i ve on television fulfilled the dream of both post-
war peri o d s. As in 1918 and in 1945, the cry
“ n e ver again” rang out in the 1990s. But it did
happen again. E ven as intern ational organizat i o n s
were celebrating the advent of a world re-united,
fascistic militias began dismembering Yu g o s l av i a
along ethnic lines while a racist gove rnment in
R wanda unleashed death squads, setting off a
frenzy of genocidal killing. Then there were the
deadly implosion of Somali society, civil strife in
p o s t - S oviet Afghanistan and the war that has
r avaged southern Sudan for 15 ye a rs , to mention
just a few of the most deva s t ating conflicts.
Could the new world order prevent these crimes
from reoccurri n g — c rimes against humanity which
the intern ational community had long thought
banished at Nuremberg after the Second World Wa r ?

### 113623: Televised genocide
Televised genocide 
Fifty years after the Second World War, the
international community is watching crimes
against humanity in Rwanda and Yugoslavia
Certainly not, unless we assume that they were just
consequences of the East-West conflict or the results
of obscure misunders t a n d i n g s. These assumptions
ignore the central importance of local political fa c t o rs.
And yet this is precisely the illusion maintained by a
We s t e rn conception of the world which is constantly
presented as universal.
This same denial of politics continued,although
in different form s , in the crises of Bosnia and Rwa n d a .
These conflicts were not a local stage for a global
p ower stru g g l e .They were about battling tribes dri ve n
by obscure ethnic impulses that seemed to date from
another age. They were no longer represented as
geopolitical conflicts in which peoples were held
hostage in a ri va l ry that had nothing to do with them.
I n s t e a d , they were presented by images of chaos and
f u r o r , in which tribes in the grip of pri m i t i ve passions
slaughter each other for enigmatic gains.
However,this perspective forgets that the world
wars started as fires ignited and stoked by Europe to
the point of suicide. Other people’s wars,like those
r a ging today, are always considered insane. It also
forgets that technology, including communicat i o n
technology, is morally neutral.In other words,it can
be used for high-minded as well as evil purp o s e s.
Lastly, it also disregards the fact that while Western
c o u n t ri e s , and more broadly the intern ational powe rs ,
cannot be held accountable for all the horrors of the
world,they bear part of the responsibility—one that
this metaphysical and moralizing vision conve n i e n t l y
avoids.
We live in virtual and widespread proximity due
to technological progress that has supposedly
t u rned the world into a “global village”. E ve ryo n e
is eve ryone else’s neighbour. But the possibility of
l e a rning about our contemporari e s ’ m i s f o rt u n e s
as they happen seems to be more overwhelming than
s t i m u l at i n g, probably because it insidiously
u n d e rmines our capacity for indignat i o n . Pe r h a p s
most import a n t l y, it underscores our we a k n e s s
all the more cru e l l y.We are simultaneously “ gi a n t s ”
in terms of inform ation and “ d wa r f s ” in terms of
a c t i o n .
The utopian dream of a world made transparent
by technology as well as the pseudo-realism
underlining the political actions and reasons of
s t ates represent two symmetrical ways of deny i n g
p o l i t i c s. We need to move beyond these two tactics
used to retreat from the wo r l d . E ve ry day, we must
r e - i nvent politics in constructing a common wo r l d
and a forum for deliberat i o n .This is by no means a
recipe for overcoming destru c t i ve impulses, but the
only way we can predict and prepare for them. I t
m ay also be called responsibility. n

### 113624: Globalization: what is at stake?
24 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
The intern ational situation in the late 1990s
d e m o n s t r ates more than ever the indivisibility
of all ri g h t s — e c o n o m i c, s o c i a l ,c i v i l ,p o l i t i c a l
and cultural—in the broadest sense.We have reached
a critical juncture where the number of rights is
increasing while their wording and practical
application are changing.The ideals which inspired
the Unive rsal Declaration may be
d e valued and the principles it has tri e d
to protect used to serve special interests
lest we focus on the stakes, p l aye rs ,
i n s t i t u t i o n s , s t r at e gies and interests
involved in defending them.
Since the 1980s, the planetary
interdependence stemming from
g l o b a l i z ation has increased debate and
media coverage of human rights in
m a ny arenas. The recommendat i o n s
t h at came out of conferences held
d u ring the present decade—Rio de
Ja n e i r o, C a i r o, C o p e n h a g e n , B e i j i n g
and Istanbu l — h ave usually been based
on an affirm ation of ri g h t s : rights to a clean
e nv i r o n m e n t , socio-economic ri g h t s , the rights of
women and the right to housing.
A gr owing number of people and organizations are
i nvo l ved in these issues, which is helping to raise
awareness of human rights and to spread more
i n f o rm ation about them in specific areas of concern .
But these sometimes powe r f u l , sometimes we a k
players have conflicting positions and interests and
a d vo c ate strat e gies that do not always coincide.
Interdependence does not necessarily mean
establishing symmetrical relationships and equal
o p p o rt u n i t i e s.The va rious forms that globalization is
taking and their destabilizing effects on social
relationships may even explain the growing concern
with human rights.
These “new rights”are appearing in a particular
context,which explains why there is an urgent need
to defend them and accounts for certain problems
r e l ating to how they have emerged. For they must be
defended without dividing up the issues and dive rt i n g
attention from the political and social relationships
that lead to violations.
We can tell if we are really looking at the
emergence of new rights or whether we are just seeing
an updating of the 1948 Unive rsal Declaration by
studying the va rious form s
g l o b a l i z ation takes and curr e n t
strategies of economic growth. More
s p e c i fic a l l y, we must focus on the new
f o rms of exclusion and margi n a l i z at i o n
t h at characterize a whole chain of
r e l ationships from the intern ational to
the regi o n a l , n ational and gr a s s r o o t s
l e ve l s. We must re-examine our
conceptions of globalization and
economic gr owth to try and
u n d e rstand the complexity of the
c u rrent process and the emergence of
new human rights demands.
Most economists argue that
g l o b a l i z ation is the outcome of unavo i d a b l e
adjustments to the new rules of intern at i o n a l
competition and to the laws of the market-place which
supposedly ensure the optimum distri bution of
resources around the wo r l d .But globalization should
be seen more as an eminently political process
i nvolving negotiations and struggles for influ e n c e
and power engineered and institutionalized by playe rs
such as gove rn m e n t s ,t r a n s n ational corp o r ations and
multilateral financial institutions.
W h at is more, the globalization of financial
markets and that of goods and services has different
s o c i a l ,economic and political implications depending
on the regi o n . E ven though they are all part of the
same worldwide process, these different situat i o n s
h ave their own special feat u r e s , which must be taken
into account when it comes to questioning human
rights and the necessity of defending them.
The liberalization underway goes hand-in-hand
Fifty years after the 1948 Universal Declaration, is there a
new generation of human rights? If so, how does it relate to
the rights enshrined half a century ago?
‘In a free nation, i t
often does not matter
whether individuals
reason well or poorly; i t
is enough that they
r e a s o n . From this
springs the liberty that
g u a rantees the effects
of that reasoning.’

orientation of its involvement in others, like

aim is to encourage special economic gr ow t h

are struggling with “structural adjustment”.
T h at has special implications for human ri g h t s.
The gr owing politicization of the
g l o b a l i z ation process, and especially the
politicization of how the crisis is managed in
the developing countries undergoing stru c t u r a l
a d j u s t m e n t , has led to a redefinition of the
s t at e ’s role. But in both the North and the
S o u t h , economic recove ry based on the pri vate sector

markets and new relationships with transnat i o n a l
corporations.
D o m e s t i c a l l y, r e f o rm programmes that seek to
create a set of economic and social relationships in
accordance with intern ational norms of productivity,
capital returns and competitiveness are directly or
indirectly attacking long-held ri g h t s ,
where they exist, such as employ m e n t

is to help redistri bute resources from
“less productive ” s e c t o rs — s o c i a l

T h at shift comes at an incalculable
social cost because it invo l ve s

has operated over the last seve r a l
decades.

some thought to the plight of  “target gr o u p s ” —
women, old people, children and the handicapped.
Special measures were adopted in their favour, but
without questioning the economic programmes which
had helped to wo rsen their situation in the first place.
More recently, the World Bank’s 1997 Wo r l d
D e velopment Report1, which focuses on the
redefinition of the stat e ’s role, contains a chart

and even less as a social or economic
ri g h t — but as a means to stabilize

only increase inequality and so lead
to potential violat i o n s.
Pove rty and the va ri o u s

for the redistri bution of power—an eminently political
m at t e r.By presenting economic,and now institutional
r e f o rms from a purely technical point of view, t h e
m u l t i l ateral and national institutions are dodging key
questions with regard to the control of the
development process.Who controls it? What is their
aim? In whose interests? It seems illusory to redefin e
measures for promoting social and economic rights,
including the aspiration to broaden their scope,b e f o r e
the content and purpose of the gr owth those
institutions recommend is made clear.
The increasingly aggr e s s i ve and multi-fa c e t e d
i n t e rvention by multilateral and bilateral aid
institutions in social and political mat t e rs is an at t e m p t
to reduce political processes to technical management.
Those institutions and their officials say there are
c e rtain “ n o n - n e g o t i a b l e ”n o rms dictated by economic
t h e o ry alone.The result is an attempt to take politics
out of the process, d e nying the legi t i m a cy of political
g o a l s.T h at is the context in which human rights must
n ow be placed and in which the gr owing role of
t r a n s n ational companies—with their freedom of
action, influence on public policy-making and thus
their power—can be understood.
But the social,political and economic impact of
outside playe rs va ries depending on many fa c t o rs ,
including domestic political situat i o n s. They range
from a state of law in which legally-recognized bodies
m ay publicly challenge rules about basic employ m e n t ,
health and environmental standards, to countri e s
where state structures have been we a k e n e d , t h e i r
legitimacy undermined,and where there are few, if
any, fora for public discussion.
In this context the major transnat i o n a l
c o rp o r at i o n s ,especially those that sell consumer goods
in we a l t hy countri e s ,h ave been busy promoting the
establishment of codes of conduct or ethics to avoid the
kind of boycotts that have occurred in Europe and
the United Stat e s. But most codes, when they exist,
h ave major loopholes, including a lack of means to
enforce them,of effective ove rsight and of sanctions in
the event of violat i o n s. C o n s e q u e n t l y, the adoption
of such codes can actually be a smokescreen for human
rights abuses by large corp o r at i o n s.
At the same time, the process of globalization and
the questions raised about the stat e ’s role in
r e d i s t ri buting resources, along with its withdrawa l
from many areas of political and social responsibility,
has underscored the emergence of new playe rs making
their voices heard for the first time. They are
mobilizing and organizing to demand new rights in
new ways, including rights for the homeless, young
p e o p l e , the elderly and the handicapped, the right to
b r e ath clean air, to drink uncontaminated water and
to eat food that is not poisoned by pesticides. In some

October 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 27
Pa n d o ra ’s b o x
Everyone agrees that the 1948 Universal
D e c l a ration of Human Rights is a sacred cow and
no one would dream—officially,at least—of replacing
it with a new version that is more in step with the
t i m e s.But the semblance of agreement on a founding
text does not by any stretch of the imagination mean
it meets with unanimous acceptance. On the contra r y,
the Declaration has come under fierce attack, a n d
the criticisms have become more pointed in the past
few years. As if to relativize the document’s va l u e,
several regions of the world have drawn up human
rights charters based on their own principles, which
do not appear in the United Nations text.The A f r i c a n
Charter on Human and Pe o p l e ’s Rights and the Islamic
Charter of Human Rights reflect a conception of
human rights espoused by leaders of countries in
those regions and by at least some of the people who
live in them.
Between the United Nations human rights
conferences in Teheran in 1968 and Vienna in 1993,
as well as in other international fora , the organization’s
D e c l a ration came under fierce criticism.At times some
have even publicly asked whether the 1948 document
could be “touched up”,since it cannot be replaced
a l t o g e t h e r. They argue in favour of including the
concerns of cultures overlooked by the text’s original
a u t h o r s, blinded as they were by a Western world
v i e w. It would be the height of irony if the 1948
D e c l a ration were made universal at last by taking
into account specific cutural features of individual
countries.
Two sides soon confronted each other. Th e
advocates of universality,who consider it dangerous
to renegotiate the Declara t i o n , have clashed with
those who would introduce clauses relating to their
specific cultures, some of which have only a distant
kinship with respect for rights of the individual.The
stand-off came to a head in the first half of the
n i n e t i e s. In Vienna and elsewhere, s e v e ral A s i a n
countries that challenged the Declara t i o n ’s universal
character in the name of Asian values joined forces
with the most conservative Muslim states to oppose
the We s t ’s efforts to have the document accepted as
universal.
Each side actually used human rights to justify its own
political tra n s g r e s s i o n s.The West has invoked them to
officially carry out international police operations since
the end of the Cold Wa r, while the opposing camp
casually violated them for the sake of “ va l u e s ”t h a t
are often their negation. Such instrumentalization has
hardly served the cause of human rights. But it has
driven home the point that a discussion on updating the
D e c l a ration would open up a Pa n d o ra ’s box of unknown
d e m o n s. The most recent international texts
acknowledge the legitmacy of “ c u l t u ral and religious
s p e c i fic i t y ” , often to the great displeasure of many
human rights groups.H o w e v e r, the universal chara c t e r
of individual rights has been solemnly upheld.
The relative lull in the confrontation between
advocates of universality and partisans of cultura l
relativism is cause for celebration but, r e g r e t t a b l y,
political exploitation of the human rights issue has
overshadowed the real debate. Many activists, in the
North and the South, believe it would be useful to
consolidate human rights by involving all the world’s
cultures in legitimizing them. By exploring all the
various facets of human rights, a common vision
might emerge of the human condition and the
necessary respect it is due that would bring peoples
together instead of drive them apart. That is the
f o u n d a t i o n , those advocates argue, on which to build
the universal human rights of tomorrow. n
Sophie Bessis
N o rth A m e rican cities, car windscreen wa s h e rs have
formed groups to defend their right to earn a little
money.
In many respects,these demands update several
articles in the 1948 Universal Declaration.Some of
them—the right to access personal dat a , to a healthy
life without genetic engi n e e ring and to a clean
e nv i r o n m e n t — r e flect technological and scientific
a d va n c e s. But again, the question
might be asked: who controls the
benefits of such technology and
science? Who decides how they shall be
used? To which ends and in whose
interests?
In this sense,we may be seeing less
the emergence of a new generation of
human rights and more the recognition
t h at , in the context of globalizat i o n ,
defending them must take into account many places
and interests in space and time. In other wo r d s , t h e
issues and the demands take different forms depending
on the place and the moment.As relationships become
increasingly complex,there is a chance that codes and
r e g u l ations will appear that seek to legitimize special
i n t e r e s t s ,methods and strat e gies in the name of human
rights while they may actually gi ve rise to the abuse of
those rights or the endorsement of a new and unjust
balance of powe r. As politicization of the issues
i n c r e a s e s , so do the chances of co-opting human ri g h t s
and seeing them used to serve the interests of a special
f e w.
The impact of human rights on the curr e n t
g l o b a l i z ation process is above all a political mat t e r
t h at requires identifiable playe rs to
build different power relationships at
different leve l s. Emphasizing the
p l aye rs and the responsibilities not
only shows that development and
defense of human rights are closely
l i n k e d , but also that the defense of new
and old rights—which are
inseparable—depends on taking back
control of development strat e gies and
of the power needed to defend them. n

‘No human quality is
more intolerable in

less tolerated than

Giacomo Leopardi,
1798-1837,Italy
28 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
“The intern ational community must treat
human rights globally in a fair and equal
m a n n e r , on the same footing and with the
same emphasis.”The June 1993 United Nations Wo r l d
Conference in Vienna added one more resolution to the
long list adopted over the ye a rs when
it reminded the signat o ry states of
the Unive rsal Declaration of their
duty to guarantee economic, s o c i a l
and cultural ri g h t s — f o o d , s h e l t e r ,
wo r k ,health and education—just as
much as civil and political ri g h t s —
f r e e d o m , s e c u rity and justice. T h e
i n i t i at i ve was critical because economic, social and
cultural rights have always been sidelined for histori c a l
and ideological reasons.
In the 1950s the debate raged over drafting a
c ovenant that would gi ve the Declaration legal force.
René Cassin of France favoured a single document,
but the We s t e rn and Communist blocs were opposed.
The We s t e rn countries emphasized political rights while
the Eastern bloc,backed by several developing nat i o n s ,
g ave pri o rity to economic ri g h t s.
A compromise was reached in 1966, when two
c ovenants were drawn up—one on civil and political
ri g h t s , to go into effect immediat e l y, another on
e c o n o m i c, social and cultural ri g h t s , which wo u l d

As the gap between rich and poor widens, the

given short shrift
and Cultural Rights stipulates that “each Stat e . . .
u n d e rtakes to take steps. . . to the maximum of its
available resources,with a view to achieving progr e s s i ve l y
the full realization of the rights recognized....”
G ove rn m e n t s ,especially in the developing wo r l d ,o f t e n
take advantage of the ambiguous wording to justify
their non-observance of the treat y,s ays Philippe Te x i e r ,
the French expert on the United Nations Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights set up in
1 9 8 5 .Most countries ignore it,he adds.
Texier, a legal expert, recommends an optional
protocol that,like the one on political rights, would
empower the committee to review complaints from
individuals or gr o u p s. But he admits that “ r e s p e c t
for political rights,such as a ban on torture,is easier
to ve rify than, for example, respect for the right to
be decently housed.”
Committee chairman Philip Alston of Australia
says,“it is essential that such a procedure be created
in order to provide the opportunity for the
d e velopment of some juri s p rudence relating to
e c o n o m i c, social and cultural ri g h t s. In the continuing
absence of such juri s p ru d e n c e , the second-class stat u s
of those rights will inevitably be maintained.”
M a ribel Wo l f, the United Nations representat i ve
of the French non-gove rnmental organization Te rre des
H o m m e s , s ays that “the purpose of being able to
process such complaints is not so much to possibly
impose sanctions but to have the opportunity to
publicly expose violations of economic ri g h t s.”
“ G ove rnments don’t like that ,”she say s ,and indeed
they seem to show scant interest in the proposal.So fa r
only six countries have responded to the draft protocol
produced by the committee. Fo u r
of them—Cypru s , S y ri a , F i n l a n d
and Ecuador—are fairly or ve ry
much in favo u r , while two —
G e rm a ny and Canada—have
expressed doubts.
“Since the gove rnments of the ri c h
c o u n t ries have abdicated their
responsibilities and hidden behind the excuse of the
market economy, and elites in the deve l o p i n g
countries refuse to redistribute wealth,it’s the job of
civil society to defend these rights,” says Wolf.
She is cheered by Amnesty Intern at i o n a l ’s recent
though small shift in that direction.Until now the human
rights watchdog has pri m a rily focused on individual
f r e e d o m s.We a ry of feeling “looked down upon” b y
political rights expert s ,Wolf claims the label “ h u m a n
rights activist” just as strongly as they do.
“We must stop thinking of political rights as an
entitlement while economic and social rights are a
mere premise or a utopian dream,” says Colombian

c r e ate the court to enter into force by the start of the
t we n t y - first century, on 31 December 2001.
n Who will bring cases to the ICC and how will the
prosecutor initiate investigations?
W. P. :I nve s t i g ations can be initiated by state part y
complaints,by referrals from the Security Council,
and by the ICC prosecutor, who would be able to
i n i t i ate a criminal inve s t i g ation subject to appropri at e
judicial scru t i ny.Testaments from victims could be the
source of inform ation from non-state sources for the
p r o s e c u t o r.H i s t o ric precedents in the rights of victims
to part i c i p at e , be protected, and seek reparat i o n s
have been achieved in the ICC statute.
n Who will appoint the ICC judges and under what
criteria will they be selected? 
W.P. :The ICC statute provides that the conference
of states parties to the ICC treaty will be responsible for
the appointment of the judges.High standards of legal
q u a l i fic at i o n s ,r e p r e s e n t ation of the wo r l d ’s major legal
s y s t e m s , and equitable geographical representat i o n
are all mandated in the treat y.
n There is a possibility that countries which have
signed the treaty can refuse to accept the war crimes
clause for seven years. Do you think this is a serious
limitation to the treaty?
W. P.: I believe very few countries will opt out for
the seven ye a rs. In the long run—no—this is not a
s e rious limitation to the treaty—presuming this
exception is not changed or extended by the
Conference of States Parties to the statute.
n What role can NGOs and pro-ICC human rights
groups play in their own countries and in nations
which have not signed the treaty?
W. P. : Our roles will be to continue to fight for
peace and intern ational justice. Our focus at the
n ational level will be to work more closely with
p a r l i a m e n t a ri a n s ,n ational bar associations and others
to advance the ratification process. Over time as the
ICC comes into being our efforts will be to support
the court and to monitor violations of international

information,research and assistance to victims,and
to demand that national courts and the ICC
investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes
against humanity.
n During the negotiations,some countries expre s s e d
a p p rehensions that the ICC may undermine national
s o v e re i g n t y.What do you think about this?
W. P.: A fundamental principle enshrined in the
ICC statute is complementarity.The new court will
not replace, but will complement national courts and
legal systems which will remain pri m a rily responsible.
A l s o, e x t r a o r d i n a ry judicial and procedural
safeguards—more than NGOs would have liked—
h ave been built into the stat u t e .They protect nat i o n a l
s overeignty and guarantee against any kind of fri vo l o u s
prosecution.
n Do you think the United States, which voted
against the treaty, will try to sabotage it?
W. P.: It is a great danger and it would be a great
tragedy if the United States were to adopt policies
and laws to sabotage the ICC. Most experts and
d i p l o m ats hope that the US will support the ICC
once US leaders better understand the adopted
s t at u t e , see what a gr e at new instrument of
international justice the ICC will be for the Security
Council and the world community, and realize how
n ations with functioning civil and military legal
systems which inve s t i g ate alleged crimes against
humanity committed by their nationals have nothing
to fear from the ICC.
n Is there any possibility of countries which voted
against the establishment of the ICC, signing the
treaty in future?
W. P.: Of course there is. South Africa played an
indispensable leadership role in this historic treat y
and five ye a rs ago South A f rica was still a pari a h
n at i o n . Scores of nations from Eastern Europe,A f ri c a
and Latin A m e rica which were ruled by brutal political
and military regimes in the recent past prov i d e d
essential support and leadership in Rome. T h e
i n t e grity and determ i n ation of these nat i o n s , i n
particular those of sub-Saharan Africa, in rejecting
great pressures from France, and the US and other
c o u n t ries to sell out the ICC, is a remarkable story of
political courage.
n During the negotiations, India said the use of
nuclear weapons should be considered a war crime.
What do you think about this?
W. P. : The list of tantalizing proposals made by
India and some other countries was irresistible,and
it seemed impossible that nations would reject them.
But governments knew that India’s goal was not to
o u t l aw nuclear weapons but to wreck the ICC treat y.
The nuclear powe rs heard the shot across their
b ows in Rome, and this issue will come up at eve ry
review conference of the ICC.But it may be even more
i m p o rtant to understand that , as the Intern at i o n a l
C o u rt of Justice stated in 1996 in its advisory opinion
on the use or threat of use of nuclear we a p o n s , it is
nearly impossible for nations to use nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction without committing
c rimes against humanity as they are defin e d .
n How would you react to the apprehensions of
certain countries that excesses by their military
forces during peacekeeping missions could also be
subjected to prosecution by the ICC?
W. P. :The overwhelming majority of nations which
c o n t ri bute peacekeeping troops did not share the
c o n c e rns about this issue expressed by France and the
U S . F i rs t , most of us expressed outrage that any
government would argue that peacekeeping troops
should be allowed to commit war crimes or crimes
against humanity with impunity or else they might not
a gree to part i c i p ate in these operat i o n s. S e c o n d ,a g a i n ,
n ational military tri bunals would have pri m a ry
jurisdiction.Thus,apprehension about the problem
of “excesses’’ is not that serious.
n When ICC becomes fully operational,do you
think it will become a supranational body and
interfere with the Security Council’s work?
W. P. : The danger is that the Security Council will
interfere with the ICC,not the other way around.W h at
has been done is to adopt a statute creating a court to
enforce violations of the Geneva Conventions on the
In the rough s t a g e s
Despite the long list of difficulties facing the
International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there is
no denying their critical role in laying the
groundwork for the ICC.
“ There is an ethical dimension to bringing
justice to the victims and to fulfilling a duty to the
collective memory,” said Claude Jorda,a Fr e n c h
judge on the ICTY, in a public discussion on the
t r i b u n a l ’s importance, which equally applies to
the ICTR. Established by the United Nations
Security Council in 1993 and 1994 respectively,
the tribunals prosecute serious violations of
international humanitarian law.
Based in The Hague (The Netherlands),the
ICTY indicted 59 individuals, and 27 were in
custody as of August 1998.Two men have been
sentenced to five and 20 years of imprisonment.
The ICTR has indicted 35 men and detained
26 of them along with five suspects, as of
September 1998. The accused include Jean
Kambanda,prime minister of Rwanda during
the genocide, along with senior government
officials, media and business leaders. Located
in Arusha (Ta n z a n i a ) , the tribunal handed down
the first judgement on crime of genocide in
September.
A lack of financial means, experience and
international support partially explains the
tribunals’ weaknesses and the slow place of
t r i a l s, particularly in Rwa n d a .Yet as many point
o u t , the courts are like laboratories offering
essential but painful lessons, such as the need to
adequately involve victims. Most importantly,
these tribunals cannot prevent war crimes, a s
seen with the Srebenica massacres of 1994,
committed one year after the ICTY began its

One can only say that the new world court will be
s u p r a n ational to the extent that these laws and the ICC
s t atute are unive rsally rat i fied and are customary
i n t e rn ational law, and that the ICC’s unive rs a l

country or a group for one year and keeps renewing it
every year, will this affect the credibility of the ICC?

and authority of the Security Council even more.

but I believe the Singapore-Canada formulation* is
one of the most important achievements of the ICC

greatly underestimate the difficulty in getting all the

### 113628: The Struggle goes global
The struggle
goes global
With economic and social rights now on the agenda, many new players have
emerged alongside older human rights organizations. In South Korea, women
are speaking out about their working conditions, and in Great-Britain the
homeless and badly-housed are voicing demands
While the unive rsality of human rights is
increasingly challenged, a gr ow i n g
number of activists is formally rejecting
any attempt to water down the principle with claims
of cultural relat i v i s m .The battle for human ri g h t s
has become universal.
“The United Nations conference in Vienna in
June 1993 shed light on a movement that had been
g at h e ring momentum since the late 1980s and
c o n f i rmed the emergence of local playe rs ,” s ay s
Antoine Bern a r d , e xe c u t i ve director of the
I n t e rn ational Fe d e r ation of Human Rights, w h o s e
membership rose from 66 in 1991 to 105 in 1997.
The gat h e rings held by non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGO) on the fringes of five United
N ations conferences between 1992 and 1995 brought
to light another major trend: the proliferation of
wo m e n ’s move m e n t s.They argue that women account
for half the wo r l d ’s population and must have the
same rights as men. Their pri o rity is fighting the
d i s c ri m i n ation and violence women endure
e ve rywhere in the wo r l d . So the community of human
rights activists has integr ated new, p r e v i o u s l y
m a r ginalized playe rs at the same time that the
movement has become global.
In A f ri c a , L atin A m e ri c a , Europe and, m o s t
r e c e n t l y,A s i a , the collapse or weakening of repressive
r e gimes has been fertile ground for a new crop of
human rights organizat i o n s.At first they were nat i o n a l
human rights groups and local branches of A m n e s t y
I n t e rn at i o n a l .To d ay they are more than just offshoots
of large organizations based in the countries of the

left off as economic and social changes spawn the
need for new forms of solidarity.
Ayo Obe,the Nigerian chairwoman of the Civil
L i b e rties Organisat i o n , s ays foreign aid and cash
helped launch such gr o u p s. But today activists,m a ny
of them vo l u n t e e rs , are legi o n . Their pri m a ry
o b j e c t i ves are to “ i m p r ove society,” to make up for the
lack of gove rnment action and to fight discri m i n at i o n ,
damage to the environment and stat e - i n s p i r e d
v i o l e n c e . Those goals are shared by most A f ri c a n
c o u n t ries which have seen the most spectacular
growth of human rights organizations.
Previously underground and exiled activists laid
the gr o u n d work for the proliferation of human ri g h t s
groups in the late 1980s.“The human rights move m e n t
in Latin A m e rica was already quite advanced before
the dictat o rships fell,but it was politically confrontat i o n a l
and centred on large organizat i o n s ,” s ays Bern a r d .
“ To d ay groups are highly dive rse and do a lot of in-
depth wo r k , especially to raise awareness of the law.”
In the former communist countri e s , the human
rights movement has also gr own by leaps and bounds
since the Berlin wall fell in 1989.“As soon as the Sov i e t
empire showed the first evident signs of collapse,
numerous NGOs sprang up all over the USSR,” s ay s
B o ris Pustintsev, c h a i rman of Citizens Wat c h .
While the first generation of human rights gr o u p s
“resisted gove rn m e n t ’s attempts to curb the
d e m o c r at i z ation process,” s ays Pustintsev, the second
wave has focused mainly on limiting the damage caused
by the ensuing social cri s i s. In Eastern
E u r o p e , as ye s t e r d ay ’s dissidents move d
into positions of powe r ,civil society wa s
left without its best defenders.G r a s s r o o t s
i n i t i at i ves did not pick up again until two
or three ye a rs ago.The still-fragile gr o u p s
c o n c e n t r ate on bu rning issues such as
the defence of minori t i e s.
The battle for human rights came later to Asia,
where dictatorships die harder. Asian activists took
a d vantage of the opportunities opened up by the
transition to democracy, especially in the Philippines
in 1986 and South Korea in 1987. Since then they
h ave stepped up their effort s. They are highly
o r g a n i z e d , use stat e - o f - t h e - a rt communicat i o n
technology and have formed regional federat i o n s.
One of their pri o rities is the dismantling of the
“national security” laws which governments use to
justify their cruellest acts of violence.
The human rights movement may be global and
r e l at i vely we l l - o r g a n i z e d , but it still has a long way
to go. E ve ry day, activists must cope with a lack of
skill and funding as well as with repression that is
increasingly multi-fa c e t e d .They must also learn how
to co-operate with the authorities while maintaining
a critical distance from them.
The Russian gove rnment may be weak and
u n r e l i a b l e , but it has taken several steps in the ri g h t
d i r e c t i o n , s ays Pustintsev. Independent NGOs must
help and advise the gove rnment and act as a link to
o r d i n a ry citizens.“But it’s hard to play this new role,”
Pustintsev say s ,because the gove rn m e n t ’s old reflex of
taking control of any initiat i ve by civil society is still
a l i ve and we l l .
Faced with new problems, human rights activists
must move ahead by trial and err o r. In North A f ri c a
they started out by imitating the European model.B u t
t o d ay, s ays Moroccan historian Driss el-Ya z a m i , t h e
m ovement has “a historically new mission: to limit the
clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and the stat e .”
He says that members of human rights gr o u p s ,wo m e n ’s
rights activists and journalists who side with the
a u t h o rities in the fight against religious fundamentalism
are missing the chance to establish unquestionable
l e gi t i m a cy in their societies.To achieve that goal,he say s ,
“they must try to play the role of pacifiers and
m e d i at o rs.”
The upheavals of the 1990s have
affected the countries of the North as
we l l . Older organizations have
s t ruggled for a new lease of life while a
n e w, younger and more aggr e s s i ve
form of activism has appeared.
As inequality has increased,
“radical activity has moved to the social arena,” says
Martine Bartélémy, an expert on NGOs at France’s
N ational Political Science Fo u n d at i o n .B ritish law ye r
Michael Ellman adds that NGOs are becoming highly
specialized and increasingly resorting to direct action.
He cites organizations defending the rights of wo m e n ,
h o m o s e x u a l s , children and the homeless.“ People are
no longer taking action because they have some ove r a l l
project to change society,” s ays Bart é l é my, “ bu t
because they have a specific goal and want to achieve
it immediately.”
N o n - g ove rnmental organizations are highly dive rs e
but moving in the same direction. N o rth and South,
economic and social issues are taking precedence.
E ven human rights groups are campaigning against
social exclusion. “Our biggest need is to make the
connection between civil and political rights and
economic and social ri g h t s ,” s ays Ja ri bu Hills, US co-
o r d i n ator of the Southern Human Rights Organizers ’
N e t wo r k . “ We can’t fight against police bru t a l i t y
without fighting against extreme pove rty and the
economic production system,” she say s.
As they continue their struggle around the wo r l d ,
activists have demonstrated that human rights really
are a unive rsal ideal. N ow they want to prove that
they are indivisible. n

Working women in South Korea have neve r
e n j oyed the same rights as their male
c o u n t e rp a rt s. In the 1960s, when men
were struggling for improved working conditions and
higher wa g e s ,women were busy defending their basic
human rights.
South Korea’s population of 45 million includes
22 million in the work force, of whom nearly nine
million are wo m e n .Yet the country ’s male trade union
l e a d e rs rarely think of the specific problems of wo m e n
in the workplace.What’s more,men are reluctant to
a c k n owledge the important contri bution wo m e n
make in the struggle to improve working conditions.
Founded in 1992, the Korean Women Wo r k e rs
A s s o c i ation United (KWWAU) is a network of six
r e gional wo m e n ’s organizat i o n s. Its main task is to
e d u c ate and organize women and to deve l o p
campaigns and policies designed to improve mother-
and-child health care and to ensure equality and
stability in labour contracts and on-the-job training.
One of the services offered is the “Equality Line”
counselling centre,which advises women on how to
deal with occupational problems and unfa i r
t r e at m e n t .Of all the women who called on this serv i c e
last ye a r , 56.6 per cent complained of delays in being
p a i d , job insecurity and unwa rranted dismissal, w h i l e
14.6 per cent reported cases of sexual harassment and
violence at the wo r k p l a c e . Some 13.7 per cent said
t h at working conditions failed to take their role as
m o t h e rs into account. Sexual discri m i n at i o n
accounted for 8.7 per cent of all complaints and
wo r k - r e l ated ailments amounted to 6.4 per cent.
In addition to these counselling serv i c e s ,E q u a l i t y
Line also organizes conferences and educat i o n a l
p r o gr a m m e s. The group has recently published a
book containing a list of all the cases it handled from
September 1996 to August 1997, with the aim of
acquainting other women wo r k e rs with the most
commonly encountered labour problems and ways of
dealing with them.
K W WAU is run by a team of six gr a d u at e
professionals with several ye a rs ’ e x p e rience in
o r g a n i z ations concerned with the legal rights of female
wo r k e rs. Its activities include inve s t i g ating wo r k
s i t u ations where women are unfairly treat e d ,
questioning gove rnment policies which do not prov i d e
for the rights of working women,organizing forums
and setting up action plans to promote awa r e n e s s
among regional groups and other associations wo r k i n g
to ensure that women have a fair deal on the labour
market.
The organization’s budget for the current year is
some $90,000.The bulk of that amount comes from
m e m b e rs ’c o n t ri butions and from assistance prov i d e d
by other national and international organizations.A
small proportion of the funding is provided by gr a n t s
from government agencies for projects proposed by
KWWAU.
The activities of KWWAU are starting to have a
perceptible impact. Fo l l owing several meetings
b e t ween the gr o u p ’s regional chapters and the
c o u n t ry ’s trade unions, an agreement was reached
to build day-care centres near workplaces. In 1993 a
c o l l e c t i ve convention was signed to open day - c a r e
centres hospitals,banks and businesses. n

### 113630: To live with dignity in the United Kingdom
While most people in the United Kingdom
e n j oy an adequate if not high standard of
living, many do not have a decent place
to live—or anywhere at all.
Though suffering from mental illness, G o r d o n
(not his real name) is responsible for looking after
his three-year old daughter. They lived in a damp,
c o l d , ru n - d own rented room riddled with wo o d wo rm .
Their lives changed when the local social serv i c e s
a g e n cy turned for help to Shelter, a British non-
governmental organization that defends the right to
h o u s i n g .The group negotiated with
social services to have Gordon
a l l o c ated a monthly sum and prov i d e d
father and daughter with a better
home.
Shelter estimates that an ave r a g e
of 470 families lose their homes in the
United Kingdom eve ry day, fin d i n g
t h e m s e l ves forced to wander the streets
in search of somewhere to live , if only temporari l y. I n
March 1998, at least one million people were living
in these appalling conditions.
C h ris Holmes, the director of Shelter, the largest
n o n - g ove rnmental organization of its kind in the
country, said it “exists for people facing these kinds
of situat i o n s. In our view, e ve rybody in society is
entitled to enjoy a proper, decent and safe home.”
Since 1996, S h e l t e r has been working to help and
s u p p o rt anyone living in dreadful conditions or on the
streets.
Shelter assists people in distress free of charge
through a network of 52 centres spread out ove r
almost the entire country. It also organizes frequent
campaigns to pressure the authorities into changing
the law and coming up with practical and fin a n c i a l l y
viable solutions. The gr o u p ’s 900 vo l u n t e e rs
p a rt i c i p ate in specific projects, field missions,
information processing and administrative work.
The results are plain to see. Holmes say s ,“ t h r o u g h
our action in 1997, 100,000 families and individuals
were gi ven advice and assistance and, in other cases,
were saved from eviction.” The different centres
p r ovide services ranging from informing people of
their rights to accompanying families when they move
into their new homes.
The organization has a budget of nearly $17
m i l l i o n .The bulk of the funds comes from individual
donations,private companies, schools and religious
gr o u p s. Shelter also raises money by conducting used
clothes drives and runs a network of shops that sells
the gr o u p ’s publications and garments bearing its
logo.
Homelessness undermines the dignity of the
individual, but Shelter points out that it also entails
considerable social and financial costs. On the basis
of statistical evidence, the organization repeat e d l y
s ays that the life expectancy of a pers o n
living on the streets is 42, c o m p a r e d
with the national average of 74 for men
and 79 for women.
Mindful that a roof is not the be-
all and end-all, Shelter is also interested
in people who have homes but live in
poor conditions. C a rri e , a 10-ye a r - o l d
gi r l , l i ves in a cramped studio
a p a rtment with her parents and baby sister. H e r
mother and father purchased the room before Carri e
was born.When they wanted to move to something
b i g g e r , housing prices had increased so much they
could not rent or buy anything else. C a rrie suffers
from serious asthma and has nowhere to play or do her
h o m e wo r k , which is affecting her performance at
s c h o o l .Her mother say s ,“There is just nowhere to put
a ny t h i n g . I am seeing a doctor for stress. I feel
constantly stressed out and that all I want to do is
murder somebody.”
Human tragedies like these inspired Shelter’s
l atest campaign,“Behind Closed Doors ” , which wa s
launched last March.The goal was to highlight the
s e riousness of such situations and raise the authori t i e s ’
awareness,thus encouraging them to treat cases like
C a rri e ’s as pri o ri t i e s.Louise Casey,the deputy director
of Shelter, s ay s , “a house is not a home if it is
dangerous and unhealthy and makes life a misery.
H aving a roof over your head does not mean you have
somewhere decent to live , and it should certainly not
disqualify people from getting help.” n

Even die-hard optimists would not have believe d
it possible when a handful of non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGOs) came together in 1992
to take landmines out of the wo r l d ’s ars e n a l s. B e c a u s e
the lowly landmine has been in widespread use by
most fighting forces in the world throughout this
c e n t u ry, the possibility of banning the weapon looked
far from achieva b l e .H owe ve r , the situation changed
d r a m atically in five ye a rs. “The campaign started a
process which in the
space of a few ye a rs
changed a ban on
a n t i p e rsonnel mines
from a vision to a feasible
r e a l i t y,” explained the
committee awarding the
1997 Nobel Prize for
Peace to the
I n t e rn ational Campaign
to Ban Landmines
( I C B L ) .
The ICBL made
wishful thinking a reality when 121 gove rn m e n t s
came to Ottawa,Canada in December 1997 to sign
the Mine Ban Tr e aty (MBT).The numbers continue
to gr ow as does the momentum towards a total
e l i m i n ation of landmines. The Nobel Committee
concluded that “as a model for similar processes in the
f u t u r e , the campaign could prove of decisive
i m p o rtance to the intern ational effort for disarm a m e n t
and peace.”
In the late 1980s and early 1990s,NGOs began to
s e riously think about trying to deal with a global
h u m a n i t a rian crisis—the tens of millions of landmines
claiming hundreds of lives eve ry year all over the wo r l d .
It became ve ry clear that to eliminate the problem, i t
would be necessary to eliminate the weapon—to ban
the production and use of landmines.
In October 1992,Handicap Intern at i o n a l ,H u m a n
Rights Wat c h ,Medico Intern at i o n a l ,Mines A d v i s o ry
Group, Physicians for Human Rights and Vietnam
Veterans of America Foundation formally launched
the ICBL with a “joint call to ban antipers o n n e l
landmines.”These organizations,which became the
s t e e ring committee of the ICBL, called for an end to
the use,production,trade and stockpiling of mines.
The call also pressed gove rnments to increase
resources for humanitarian mine clearance and for
victim assistance.
The intern ational campaign has become an
unprecedented coalition of over 1,000 organizat i o n s
working together in 60 countries to achieve a ban.
And as the campaign grew, the steering committee
expanded to represent its diversity.The Afghan and
Cambodian campaigns and Radda Barnen we r e
added in 1996; the South A f rican campaign and
K e nya Coalition in 1997; and the A s s o c i ation to A i d
R e f u g e e s , Ja p a n , Lutheran World Fe d e r at i o n , t h e
Colombia Campaign Against Landmines, I n t e r
A f rican Union of Human Rights and Norwe gi a n
People’s Aid joined early this year.
The core strength of the campaign, has alway s
been its loose stru c t u r e .There has never been a central
s e c r e t a ri at or headquart e rs.There has never been an
ove rr e a c h i n g, bu r e a u c r atic stru c t u r e . ICBL members
a lways meet regularly to plot out overall strat e gi e s
and plan joint actions,but beyond that each NGO and
each national campaign is free to develop its ow n
work best suited to its mandat e , culture and
circumstances.
The overall strategy of the intern ational campaign
has always been to press for nat i o n a l , r e gional and
i n t e rn ational measures to ban landmines. Initially an
attempt was made to persuade the nations to review
the 1980 Convention on Conventional We a p o n s
( C C W ) , which attempted to control the use of
a n t i p e rsonnel mines and to ban the weapon by
amending the conve n t i o n . While the revised CCW
did not ban them, pressure by the ICBL made many
governments take the issue seriously.
D u ring the last phase of the CCW review, t h e
campaign called on individual gove rnments to come
together in a pro-ban gr o u p. A series of meetings
b e t ween pro-ban gove rnments and the ICBL was held
in Geneva during the final sessions of the review
c o n f e r e n c e . After the conference in May 1996, t h e
Canadian gove rnment offered to host a gove rn m e n t a l
meeting in October.The hectic negotiations in the
subsequent months paved the way for the histori c
December 1997 meeting in Ottawa for the Mine Ban
Tr e at y.
At the time of wri t i n g, t wenty-eight stat e s — m o r e
than half the number necessary for entry into force—
h ave deposited their instruments of rat i fic ation at the
United Nat i o n s. Six other gove rnments have fin a l i z e d
and just have to deposit the ratification.
The ICBL,and its part n e rship with gove rn m e n t s ,
has launched a truly remarkable and historic process.
It has clearly demonstrated that civil society and
g ove rnments do not have to see themselves as
a d ve rs a ri e s. It also shows that small and middle powe rs
can work together with civil society and address
humanitarian concerns with breathtaking speed. n

Be rtrand Russell’s caution on the ethic of
science is more pertinent today than eve r
b e f o r e . But we still seem far from deve l o p i n g
an effective human rights framework to guide the
choices we , as a world community,make about the use
of emerging technologies.The sheer momentum of
s c i e n c e ,s p u rred on by the commercial entities funding
research,continues to dominate our decisions. Can
human rights instruments gi ve us the direction we
need?  Perhaps not.
The response of legi s l at o rs to the ongoing “ g e n e t i c
r e vo l u t i o n ” i l l u s t r ates the shortcomings of curr e n t
r e g u l at o ry approaches.The Human Genome Project,
an intern ational effort to sequence and map all the
human genes, is probably the most scrutinized scientific
e n d e avour in history. Most of the part i c i p ating nat i o n s
h ave set aside part of their science budgets to address
the ethical, legal and social issues invo l ve d .Yet this
analysis has resulted in only a few formal genetic policies
with any real legal teeth.
Domestic law has always struggled to keep pace
with the advance of technology. The problems are
amplified in the arena of international human rights
law with its plurality of cultures, beliefs and values.
Only the most basic principles are likely to surv i ve the
polarized debates. As exemplified by the UNESCO
D e c l a r ation on the Protection of the Human Genome,
the substance of many of the final documents seems
to hinge on the interp r e t ation of amorphous terms like
“human dignity”.
There are also more specific reasons why it is
difficult to create effective human rights “ ru l e s ”
including:the daunting task of writing scientifically
meaningful regulations and the fact that the social
n o rms which compel the implementation of
safeguards evo l ve almost as quickly as the technology
(consider in vitro fertilization).
The regulat o ry issues raised by Dolly, the firs t
cloned mammal, highlight these challenges. Fo r
e x a m p l e , a number of the pre-Dolly laws prohibiting
human cloning, such as Great Bri t a i n ’s , a d d r e s s e d
e m b ryo splitting technology. As a result, a ri gi d
a p p l i c ation of such provisions would miss the nuclear
transfer technique used to create Dolly.
More import a n t l y, Dolly highlights the need for
meticulous policy analysis. U n f o rt u n at e l y, an ill-
i n f o rmed polemic seems to dri ve far too much of the
“ b i o p o l i cy ”d i a l o g u e . One could argue that both the
eugenic laws of the early twentieth century and the
recent commentary on human cloning are based on an
i n a c c u r ate view of genetic determ i n i s m .T h at is an
ironic conclusion, since state-imposed eugenic policies
obviously offend human dignity while cloning
r e g u l ations explicitly seek to protect it. N e ve rt h e l e s s ,
if one scrutinizes the proposals to ban human cloning
it is difficult to find a sat i s fa c t o ry critique of this paradox .
A wo rrisome trend gi ven that a deterministic ethos is
arguably more threatening to human dignity than an
u n d e veloped cloning technology.
But let us consider a possibly more troubling
c o n t r ove rs y. M a ny have argued that the marri a g e
b e t ween commerce and human genetics will usher in
an era of  laissez faire eugenics in which the social
d e finitions of disease, disability and norm a l cy are
dictated by market forces.
H ow can traditional human rights instru m e n t s
address such a concern? It may be impossible.First,
the commercialization of genetics is part of a gr ow i n g,
multi-billion dollar industry viewed by many
governments as a vital part of the economy.
S e c o n d ,because the notion of autonomy remains
a fundamental human ri g h t , a ny policy seen as
curtailing the ability to choose will meet resistance.
F u rt h e rm o r e , in many We s t e rn countries individual
freedom is indistinguishable from a perceived right to
be an unrestrained consumer. In health care,
a u t o n o my has metamorphosed from a right to
determine what is done to your body into a right of
access. State imposed eugenic policies are relatively
easy to condemn, but how do you get at the aggr e g at e
effect of consumer decisions?    
F i n a l l y, the subtle attitudinal changes associat e d
with the genetic revolution are the result of social
f o r c e s , not state policies.As such they may easily pass
unnoticed.
Though I am not a “ L u d d i t e ,” some form of social
control is needed.H owe ve r ,m a ny concerns associat e d
with the genetic revolution may be beyond the reach
of human rights instru m e n t s.The genetech industry
will be propelled forward by social forces imbedded
in the fa b ric of We s t e rn culture. It seems certain that
the cumulat i ve pressure of these forces will prove too
much for the most sharply crafted declaration. n

Should drugs be tolerated, legalized or prohibited? The debate takes on
new proportions with the growing use of illicit substances
The war on drugs is a fa i l u r e .D e c l a r e d
by the United States in 1983 and
taken up by the intern at i o n a l
community in 1989, the objective was to cut
off the consumer countries of the North from
the producers of illicit drugs in the South,
which are the targets of an increasingly
e x p e n s i ve crackdow n . The United Stat e s
alone increased funding for this war from
$4.7 billion in 1988 to $12.3 billion in 1993.
Yet the participants in the United Nat i o n s
General Assembly Special Session on the
World Drug Problem, which took place in
New York from 8 to 10 June 1998,came to the
conclusion that never before have such vast
amounts of illicit substances been on the
market at such low pri c e s , which are reliable
i n d i c at o rs of ove rp r o d u c t i o n . Repression that
focuses exclusively on supply—cultivat i o n ,
production and trafficking—is a continuat i o n
of a Cold War mind-set that viewed the wo r l d
as divided into “good guys”and “bad guys”.
The blatant failure of that approach has led
to the search for new strategies. Nowadays
e ve ryone more or less agrees that drug users
are at the heart of the problem, but solutions
remain to be found.
The special session in New York was an
o p p o rtunity for renewed debate betwe e n
advocates of prohibition and supporters of
l i b e r a l i z at i o n . Such discussions among
e x p e rts are often difficult for the public at
large to fat h o m , especially because of the
confusion between the two major concepts
involved:decriminalization of drug use and
legalization of drugs themselves.
The three United Nations conventions on
n a r c o t i c s ,which provide a framework for the
i n t e rn ational prohibition system, l e ave room
for interp r e t at i o n .The authors of these accords

E T H I C S
38 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
“ u s e ” — fall within the sovereignty of each
member stat e .The 1997 World Drug Report
produced by the United Nations Drug Control
P r o gramme (UNDCP) stated that ,“None of
the Conventions requires a party to conv i c t
or punish those who commit such offences
[ a c q u i ri n g, possessing or consuming dru g s ] ,
e ven when they have been established as
p u n i s h a b l e ; a l t e rn at i ve measures may also
substitute for criminal prosecution.” In line
with this,s i g n at o ry countries to the conve n t i o n
h ave developed a wide arr ay of responses to
d rug use. In some countries of the European
Union such as France and Luxe m b o u r g, f o r
e x a m p l e ,p e rsonal drug use is against the law,
while others , such as Spain, only prosecute
d rug use in public places and possession with
intent to sell.D rug abuse or addiction should
increasingly be dealt with not by putting users
behind bars but by court-ordered rehabilitat i o n
( w h at might be called a therapeutic injunction)
within the framework of treat m e n t
p r o gr a m m e s. But major differences pers i s t
b e t ween drug rehabilitation systems. At the
same time, l aw enforcement officials
overwhelmed by the scope and increasing
s o p h i s t i c ation of drug trafficking are often
tempted to crack down on casual users in order
to achieve tangible results, thus filling pri s o n s
without disrupting the illicit trade.
This is the context in which the advo c at e s
of decri m i n a l i z ation are increasingly making
their voices heard. They recommend
l e g a l i z i n g, instead of prosecuting, t h e
possession of small
amounts of dru g s
intended for pers o n a l
u s e . The idea is gaining
ground in the European
Union, but in the rest of
the world the trend is
towards a harder line on
possession and use to try and stem the ri s i n g
tide of drug addiction, especially in the South
where it is a recent phenomenon.S o m e t i m e s
u s e rs are even sentenced to death for the
possession of a few gr a m s. Its support e rs say
that decriminalization is just one part of an
overall risk reduction policy.They argue that
it would be futile to try to eliminate the use
of illegal dru g s , which is inherent in our
s o c i e t i e s , without getting at the roots of such
problems of the modern world as loneliness,
u n e m p l oyment and other forms of economic
and emotional distress.
A b s t i n e n c e ,which is the aim of prohibition,
must therefore not be the main goal bu t , i n
the words of Dutch specialist Henk Jan Va n
V l i e t , “the final objective in a hierarchy of
o b j e c t i ve s.”The highest pri o rity is to implement
a policy that would help users kick the habit
when they decided to, not just when a judge
ordered them to.Such an approach,s u p p o rt e rs
a r g u e , would minimize the margi n a l i z at i o n
and health hazards stemming from drug taking.
The emergence of Aids and the spread of HIV
infection among heroin addicts,who inject the
d ru g, is a major argument in favour of this
a p p r o a c h .M a ny gove rnments with repressive
policies have been compelled to allow ove r -
the-counter sales of needle kits before setting
up drug substitution
p r o gr a m m e s.S w i t z e r l a n d
and the Netherlands are
e ven experimenting with
the distri bution of heroin
i t s e l f, as a way of keeping
a d u l t e r ated and dubious
products off the market
while breaking up the relationship betwe e n
user and dealer.
Another basic argument in favour of ri s k
reduction is the distinction between soft and
hard dru g s. The form e r , p ri m a rily the
cannabis deri vat i ves hashish and mari j u a n a ,
are not considered very harmful.The latter,
including heroin, c o c a i n e , a m p h e t a m i n e s
and other synthetic dru g s , c a rry
“ u n a c c e p t a b l e ” ri s k s. At present, T h e
Netherlands is the only country with
l e gi s l ation based on that distinction,a l t h o u g h
a scientific report handed in to France’s junior
minister of health in June 1998 made
headlines by asserting that “cannabis has no
n e u r o t ox i c i t y ” and “from that point of view,
is completely different from alcohol, c o c a i n e ,
ecstasy and psychostimulants.”
The Dutch exception is a model for ri s k
reduction advo c at e s. C o n t r a ry to popular
b e l i e f, the possession of drugs for pers o n a l
use is against the law in The Netherlands.B u t
the possession and sale of less than 30 gr a m s
of cannabis deri vat i ves has been tolerated since
1 9 7 2 .T h at has gi ven rise to the 200 or so
coffee shops where users can legally purchase
and consume hashish or mari j u a n a .The last
point is exactly where the risk reduction
p rinciple encounters the fiercest opposition.
The UNDCP stresses that “most of the
arguments advanced in the name of ri s k
reduction are compatible with a flexible
i n t e rp r e t ation of the prohibition policy.” B u t
in the case of  The Netherlands, the step
t owards de facto legalization of cannabis seems
to have been taken.This is a step the United
N ations refuses to recommend.
The legalization of drugs would simply
consist of allowing substances that are today
illicit to be freely sold. A c t u a l l y, it would be
difficult to find an anti-prohibitionist who
would advo c ate such a radical solution.A more
a c c u r ate term to describe what they favo u r
would be controlled legalizat i o n . In other
wo r d s , narcotics production and distri bu t i o n
would come under state control along lines
t h at could be compared to the way opium wa s
produced and distri buted in the form e r
European colonies.The pro-legalization camp
includes figures as va ried as liberal economists,

c o n s u m p t i o n ,but contend that adopting their
position would help fight cri m e .
They reason that drugs must be legalized
to limit the enormous costs of repression as
it is currently carried out; to depri ve
c ri m i n a l s , p r o h i b i t i o n ’s only benefic i a ri e s ,
of a substantial source of reve n u e ; and to
reduce public health costs by guaranteeing
the quality of the
products and by raising
t a xes that would be used
to fund dru g
r e h a b i l i t at i o n
p r o gr a m m e s.
The advo c ates of
prohibition reply on
technical and moral
gr o u n d s. H ow would the legal sale of dru g s
be organized? Who would sell them? Doctors ,
who would become “ d e a l e rs in white coat s ”
and prescribe products that have no
therapeutic value? To whom would they be
sold? If only to adults, then how would we
p r e vent a black market intended for minors
from developing? Should cannabis be the only
legalized drug? Organized crime networks are
so adept at switching from one illicit substance
to another,depending on trends and markets,
t h at all drugs would have to be legalized.L a s t l y,
they argue,the organized suicide and poisoning
by a state of its citizens would be an admission
of powe r l e s s n e s s.
C l e a r l y, the debate over anti-drug policies
raises extremely complex questions.And the
arguments voiced do not even take account of
the narcotics market’s global dimension.T h e
extremely inadequate data that fuel the debat e
only take into account the situation in we a l t hy
c o u n t ri e s.But the South cannot be left out.I t
would be hy p o c ritical to talk about legalizing
the consumption of
cannabis in Europe while
c riticizing a producer
c o u n t ry for not doing
a nything to eliminat e
illicit crops that prov i d e
a livelihood for entire
p o p u l at i o n s. And how
can we talk about
consumption while ignoring the millions of
new users who have appeared in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries in recent ye a rs? Lastly, “ ri s k
r e d u c t i o n ” cannot be mentioned without
tackling the relationship between the explosion
of the Aids epidemic in southern A f rica and
the abuse of alcohol, the We s t ’s “legal dru g ” .
One thing is clear: the time has come for a
widespread debate based on rational studies
r ather than prejudices and taboos that , in the
final analysis, help romanticize drugs and,
c o n s e q u e n t l y,boost their power of at t r a c t i o n .

D r u g s in fig u r e s
PR O D U C T I O N
• Hero i n : the poppy fields of the
Golden Triangle (Burma, L a o s,
Thailand) produce annually some
2,500 tons of opium likely to yield
250 tons of heroin. A similar
amount is produced in the Golden
Crescent (Afghanistan, Pa k i s t a n ) .
Poppy cultivation is on the rise in
Latin America (100 or so tons of
opium annually or 10 tons of
heroin) and Ce n t ral A s i a .
• C o c a i n e : according to Interpol,
coca plantations in the A n d e a n
countries (Pe r u ,B o l i v i a ,C o l o m b i a )
supply 700 to 1,300 tons of
cocaine chlorhydrate a year.
• Cannabis: cannabis resin, o r
h a s h i s h , is produced in Morocco
(2,000 to 2,500 tons) and
Pakistan/Afghanistan (over 2,000
t o n s ) .Cannabis herb,or marijuana,
is produced worldwide.The Wo r l d
Customs Organization reports the
seizure of 513 tons in 1997.
CO N S U M P T I O N
There is no truly reliable estimate of
worldwide consumption of illicit
s u b s t a n c e s. The United Nations
puts forward the figures of eight
million heroin addicts,13.3 million
cocaine addicts,141.2 million users
of cannabis derivatives and over
280 million consumers of synthetic
drugs (hallucinogens,
amphetamines) and various drugs
that are used for other than
t h e rapeutic purposes (sedatives).
IL L I C I T R E V E N U E S
The annual global turnover of the
illicit drug trade is put at
a p p r oximately $400 billion, o r
around 8% of the total value of
international tra d e. P r o fit margins
vary depending on the product.
They range from 100% for heroin
to 300% for wholesale cra c k , a
form of cocaine that can be
smoked. n
The hard
t r u t h
Just how far should doctors go in making
patients realize that they have only a few
months to live? Many physicians avoid the hard
t r u t h , fearing that they risk depriving patients
of their last chance—the hope and the will—
to survive. But they may be doing more harm
than good, according to a recent study
published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association (J A M A, 3 June 1998).
Studying the cases of 917 adults hospitalized
with the final stages of lung or colon cancer, t h e
research found that patients greatly
overestimated their chances to live six months,
even though their physicians’ less optimistic
prognoses were far more accura t e.While 59 per
cent of the patients estimated that they had at
least a 90 per cent chance of surviving six months,
the data found that only 45 per cent actually
lived that long.
This over-optimism heavily influenced patients’
treatment decisions.Convinced that they would
survive for at least six months,patients tended to
opt for aggressive life-prolonging treatment
instead of care designed to relieve their pain
and discomfort.It is important to note that the
more optimistic patients, regardless of their
t r e a t m e n t , lived longer than the more pra g m a t i c .
H o w e v e r, the patients who sought to extend life
had exactly the same median survival as those
who privileged their quality of life. In fact, t h e
former were 1.6 times more likely to suffer
adverse events like re-admission to the hospital,
attempted resuscitation or death while attached
to a ventilator.
“ We’ve got to ask: If patients better
understood their prognoses,would they choose
the same kind of treatment?”said the study’s
leading author,Dr Jane Weeks of the Dana-Fa r b e r
Cancer Institute (Boston,US) in a JAMA press
release.As the study concludes,“to achieve the
goals of making care at the end of life consistent
with patient values and minimizing futile thera p y,
we may need to change what physicians tell
patients about their prognoses and be sure that
patients hear and understand what their
physicians have said.” n
How would the legal
sale of drugs be
organized?

### 113634: Culturally correct
In Central Asia, cultural heritage policies have a single objective: to shore up
fragile national identities 
Culturally   
As the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia get down to post-
independence nat i o n - bu i l d i n g, a
major cultural issue has crystallized around
their attitudes to their past, which until
recently was designed and organized by
M o s c ow.The end of the Soviet system has
not taken the politics out of nat i o n a l
h e ri t a g e — far from it. It has actually led to
an excess of politicization as new relat i o n s h i p s
with the past have entrenched old ways of
thinking.
In the 1970s, intellectual elites in the
Central Asian republics were able to revive a
few selected aspects of their respective
n ational heri t a g e s. They were trying to do
t wo things: p r ovide historical justific ation for
the political borders established by Stalin
and prove the historical need for a deliberat e
fusion of the regi o n ’s peoples with their
Russian big brother.
To d ay, this framework is still the basis of
the new interp r e t ation of national history on
the fringes of the former Soviet Union.The
emergence of autonomous political
o r g a n i z ations in the late 1980s and the
d e c l a r ations of independence in 1991
simply reinforced the first aim and turn e d
the second upside dow n . L e gi t i m i z i n g
b o r d e rs is more important than eve r ,but now
as a means of confirming the break with
R u s s i a . At the same time, this recent
d e velopment incorp o r ates a wide range of
attitudes which va ry according to the specific
features of each national heritage and arise
from the political situation of five new stat e s
with sometimes divergent interests.
The main purpose of places of
remembrance is to provide focal points for
consensus. But the societies of Central Asia
are scarred by internal divisions inheri t e d
from a modern history riven with a host of
conflicts. So it would seem hard to promote
a sense of unity by referring to political fig u r e s
of the recent past.
For this reason,earlier history has been
brought into play, and those grey areas of
memory where the unwritten history of the
more recent past is stored have been pushed
a s i d e . The wealth of recent history wa s ,
h owe ve r ,d i s p l ayed in the Tashkent region of
Uzbekistan in 1996 during moving popular
c e l e b r ations held to mark the twe n t i e t h
a n n i ve rs a ry of the death of Ali Khan Tu r a
S a g h u n i , who led a resistance move m e n t
against the Red Army in the 1920s and then
t wenty ye a rs later headed a short - l i ve d
Muslim republic in easternTurkestan.
G r e at figures from medieval history serve
to recall the independent past of each form e r
S oviet republic, especially in relation to
R u s s i a , and its capacity to have its own healthy
political institutions.U z b e k i s t a n , for example,
which has gone far along the road to de-
Russification,has rehabilitated Amir Timur
(the Tamerlaine of medieval European
c h r o n i c l e rs ) ,who is presented not so much as
a conqueror as an epitome of the just ruler,
intent on maintaining social harmony.
M oves of this kind are sometimes frow n e d
upon by neighbouring states, which do not
a lways have fond memories of the “ i r o n
c o n q u e r o r ” . Some even see Uzbekistan’s
action as a bid for hegemony. One such case
is Ta j i k i s t a n , which was invented from scrat c h
in the late 1920s and is a largely Pe rs i a n -
speaking country whose national history is
based on glorifying resistance to the
inexorable spread of Turkish influence in
Central Asia.
Cultural history is not immune to
p o l i t i c i z at i o n . From the time of de-
S t a l i n i z ation in the late 1950s,

A giant portrait of Tamerlaine in Taskhent.
c o m m e m o r ation of gr e at national figures of the
past began to revive all along the southern
edge of the Soviet Union.This pointed up the
uniqueness of each national culture, while at
the same time stressing the need to be united
with the Russian wo r l d . Because these gr e at
figures had to be apolitical and non-religi o u s ,
they were sought in literary history and oral
t r a d i t i o n .
The Middle Ages again came in ve ry
handy for this, but the modern period could
also be re-injected into official histori e s
through the use of “ c i v i l i z i n g ” figures (know n
as p r o s ve t i t e l i in Russian) drawn from
e i g h t e e n t h - c e n t u ry Russian cultural history
and from the ye a rs of Russian populism
b e t ween 1860 and 1870. In this way, t h e
r e f o rm movements which emerged in Ce n t r a l
Asia until the area was sovietized in the 1920s,
could be presented as the triumph of
enlightenment inspired by the Russian
example.
For example, after the death of Stalin, t h e
Kazakhs revived the mid-nineteenth-century
Kazakh writer Shokan Va l i k h a n ov,r e p u b l i s h i n g
p a rts of his work which made him look like a
pro-Russian intellectual. In the 1970s, t h e r e
was much talk of the “ c i v i l i z e r ” I b r a h i m
A l t i n s a ri n , a scholar of Kazakh and Cyri l l i c
s c ri p t .Since independence, the Kazakhs have
lionized to an even gr e ater extent the
intellectuals who between 1917 and 1919 led
the Alash Orda g ove rnment of prominent
figures from the steppes with close ties to
Russian anti-Bolshevik circles.
Pe rsistently forgotten,
h owe ve r , is the party know n
as the “Three Hundreds”
(Uch Juz) which,in the same
p e ri o d , spoke for the ri s i n g
middle class and the radical
intelligentsia of the towns of
the southern steppes. T h i s
piece of history is embarr a s s i n g, since U c h
J u z practised a kind of political Islam and
also allied itself with the Bolsheviks.
Another problem was that the radical
Kazakhs in Uch Juzadvocated cross-border
s o l i d a rity between Muslim peoples.To d ay
h owe ver it is unthinkable to question the
borders traced in the 1920s and 1930s.This
also explains the deliberate neglect of a fig u r e
like President Ali Khan Tura Saghuni—born
in To k m a k , in present-day Ky r g y z s t a n ,a c t i ve
in Uzbek Ferghana and in Xinjiang,and then
exiled to Tashkent—who still has followe rs
almost everywhere in Central Asia.
The desire by the new Central A s i a n
s t ates to make the bounds of their history,
over a shorter or
longer peri o d ,
coincide with a

Tower of
d i s c o rd
Work began this summer on a new scheme
to reduce the inclination of Italy’s leaning
tower of Pisa, probably the world’s only
a r c h i t e c t u ral masterpiece famed for a
construction defect.The 8-storey,56-metre high
white marble tower, which was built between
1173 and 1350, began to lean when its
foundations shifted during construction of the
third storey, but the builders pressed on
r e g a r d l e s s. Its overhang was used by Galileo,
who dropped metal balls from the top storey to
prove the theory of gra v i t y. The tower, w h i c h
today leans about 5 metres out of true, wa s
closed to tourists in 1990 because of fears that
it might topple.
Remedies for the tower’s plight have been
proposed for centuries. Some of them come from
the wilder reaches of the imagination. O n e
proposal advocated attaching a helium balloon
to the top of the tower; another favoured
reshaping the surrounding meadow so that it
would slope in the same direction as the tower
leans and make it look upright.
The latest project seeks to raise the tower by
half a degree or 40 cm. Soil will be extra c t e d
from beneath the high, northern side of the
f o u n d a t i o n s, t h e r e b y, says Professor John
B u r l a n d ,a member of the Pisa Commission which
is in charge of restora t i o n , “reducing the
inclination in a gentle and controlled manner by
an amount that is imperceptible to the eye.”
Te m p o rary steel cables are being used to hold the
tower “in the very unlikely event of unforeseen
detrimental movements.”
L i ke other schemes before it, the current
engineering operation has aroused vociferous
c r i t i c i s m , causing the monument to be dubbed
the “ Tower of Discord” in the Italian press. A n
organization called A r t Watch International,w h i c h
monitors art restoration projects,says that repair
work has made the structure more unstable than
b e f o r e.Professor Piero Pierotti,a Pisan art historian
who has published a book entitled Una Torre Da
Non Salvare (“How not to save the Tower of Pisa”),
was quoted as saying that this work of “ s o a r i n g
imagination and symbolic beauty” is also
“unquestionably a phallic symbol” and that
“perhaps the attempt to pull it erect is another
aspect of the age of Vi a g ra .” n
are being restored and history textbooks
r e w ritten at a feve rish pace.The latest major
o p e r ations of this type were carried out with
gr e at pomp at Khiva and at Bukhara, t h e
2,500th annive rs a ry of whose foundat i o n
was celebrated by Uzbekistan in 1997.
All this shows the authori t i e s ’ c o n c e rn
for the distant past.Government ministries
in charge of heritage gi ve pri o rity to the roya l
architecture of the founding dynasties,
especially the T i m u rids or their immediat e
s u c c e s s o rs , e ven if this means neglecting
things which seem less prestigi o u s , or belong
to the more recent past and are therefore
more problemat i c.This seems to be the case
in Kazakhstan with the
r e s t o r ation of the mausoleum
of the eleve n t h - c e n t u ry
S h aykh Ahmad Ya s av i ,w h i c h
was undertaken jointly with
Turkey in 1992 and is typical
of the pan-Tu r k i s h
rapprochement which
followed independence.
The tombs of nat i o n a l
s a i n t s , which are often
symbols of unity, are being restored with
plenty of fa n fare and may also reflect a
r e gional strat i f i c ation of authori t y. I n
Ta j i k i s t a n , the restoration of the mausoleum
of Shaykh Muslih ad-Din, in Khoujand, wa s
c a rried out during perestroika, while the
Khoujandis still controlled the Ta j i k
communist party.Then the tomb of Shaykh
Yusuf Hamadani in Kulab was restored,a f t e r
the victory of the Kulabi militias in 1992.
Such operations also clearly have religi o u s
ove rt o n e s.They show a gove rn m e n t ’s desire
to keep an eye on the activities of the secret
brotherhoods, a valued rampart against the
gr owth of  Wa h h a b i s m , a strictly conservat i ve
Muslim movement that has recently arrived
in the region from Saudi Arabia and Pa k i s t a n .
The new Central Asian states are thus
taking over a pre-Soviet tradition of using for
political ends a despiritualized form of Sufi
brotherhood called “ i c h a n i s m ,” which is
traditionally opposed to fundamentalist
m ove m e n t s. One example of this is the Uzbek
a u t h o ri t i e s ’ c u rrent interest in the tomb of
the gr e at mystic Baha ad-Din Naqshband,
in Bukhara,and the government’s tolerance
of the posthumous cult which has grown up
around Ali Khan Tu r a , who until his death in
1976 even had many followe rs inside the
Uzbek communist party.
So the politicization of the cultural heri t a g e
is a crucial element in nat i o n - bu i l d i n g,
including the delicate question of borders. A
case in point is the more or less symbolic claims
of the Ta j i k
intelligentsia to Ta j i k
s overeignty over the
holy cities of
Samarkand and
B u k h a r a ,which have
been part of
Uzbekistan since the
S oviet authori t i e s ’
first ethno-terri t o ri a l
c a rve-up of Ce n t r a l
Asia in 1924.
But the rediscove ry of this heritage is
happening at several levels of awa r e n e s s ,
which are not always linked to each other by
a simple desire for logical coherence.
The official leve l , with its cult of gr e at
figures and monuments standing out against
the background of a distant past, i s
s u p e rimposed on a semi-official leve l
consisting of ideological experiments by
intellectuals.These two levels seem to have
little effect on the counter-culture or at least
on the informal approach developed by
people at the gr a s s r o o t s. O r d i n a ry citizens
remember in detail the recent and often
painful past and seem much less confused
about things than the ideological hesitat i o n s
of the new authorities might suggest. n

‘Lo o k , yo u ’re a doughnut.” P r o f e s s o r
Michael Hawley is stating his case for
embedded technology. “ Yo u ’re a
roundish little thing with a hole in the top
and you pour food in and it comes out a hole
in the bottom and you roll around a little
d u ring the day, but topologically speaking
you’re just a doughnut.And that’s about all
you know about the nature of what you eat
and what comes out.”

research group at the Massachusetts
Institute of Te c h n o l o g y ’s Media Lab, i s
t rying to make commonplace, e ve ry d ay
objects smarter to better understand and
monitor our bodies. “ We are incredibly
n a i ve about how our bodies work day to day.
. . because we don’t have any way to
measure it or sense it.”
For too long we have been forced to adapt
to technology—to make our bodies and live s
c o n f o rm to clunky desktop computers , f o r
e x a m p l e . We memorize long strings of we b
addresses to find cheap airfares but have
trouble remembering where we left our keys.
The solution to these problems, at least in
the United Stat e s , is more technology.
Embedded technology that is smaller, s m a rt e r
and,most importantly, everywhere.
Embedded technology—fitting out objects
with computational enhancements that
i n t e gr ate digital and physical wo r l d s — w i l l
m ove in two directions: out into our
e nvironment and closer to our bodies.
According to Professor Mitchel Resnick,
another TTT member, the gr owth of research
in this fie l d , which has substantial corp o r at e
s u p p o rt , can be tied to three deve l o p m e n t s :
smaller and cheaper processors , better sensors ,
and continued advances in communicat i o n
and networking technologi e s.
H awley say s ,“ I t ’s becoming miniat u ri z e d

it’s in your pockets and then it might as well
be your pockets.”

g l o o m ,the media, especially television,offer an
almost idyllic vision of the future as an era of
tremendous advances for humankind,
including gene therapy, the emergence of a
global citizenry through Internet and the
d e velopment of clean energy sources. T h e

C h e va l i e r , of the French-German public
television network La Sept/Art e ,a c k n ow l e d g e s
t h at journalists have a poor command of the
“ ve ry specific language” required by science
r e p o rt i n g, which is difficult to illustrate with
p i c t u r e s.M o r e ove r ,most television exe c u t i ve s
are more interested in high audience shares
than programme quality. And to capture the
attention of a large number of viewe rs ,s h o c k
is often more effective than rational inquiry.
“By and large, the bigger and less educat e d
the audience, the gloomier the message,” s ay s
de Cheve i g n é .
Media coverage of science also va ri e s
depending on the cultural context.A m e ri c a n s
h ave a mostly upbeat ,“ p r a g m at i c ” vision of
t e c h n o l o gical advances and cloning,w h e r e a s
ethical concerns come to the fore in Europe’s

only ‘ fa c t s ’ and less speculation about what
the implications of the facts might be,” s ay s
B ruce V. L e wenstein of Cornell Unive rs i t y.
Trench stresses another facet of the problem.
He says the media’s rosy outlook on new
i n f o rm ation technology, for example, r e fle c t s
a desire to treat computer companies, w h i c h
are major adve rt i s e rs , with kid glove s. “ T h e
media increasingly belong to corp o r at e

Charles B. Po t t e r , adding that the image they
p r ovide of the future has no inherent va l u e
but is merely one more “ p r o d u c t ” on the
m a r k e t .
S t i l l , polls conducted by Explorer-Ipsos
r e veal that the public has had its fill of simplistic
d i s c o u rs e .They would like to see more subtle,
hopeful messages about the possibility of taking
back control of their destiny.“ People are awa r e
they are living through a period of transition
and want order,” s ays Ceri a n i . “They wa n t
more rat i o n a l , less sensat i o n a l i s t
c o m m u n i c at i o n .They are fed up with the
b i z a rre and the alien. Hence the return in
design to simpler,r e a s s u ring shapes associat e d
with technology that ’s under control.” T h e
media would do well to fall into step with the
trend towards reassurance and a shift in focus
back to eve ry d ay life. By continuing to stress
the inability to find a way out of the cri s i s ,t h e y
probably help to increase the public’s anxiety
and the appeal of New Age move m e n t s ,f o rm s
of immanent spirituality considered capable of
exorcising the demons of uncert a i n t y. n

H aw l e y, health monitori n g, for those who
can afford it,will be “one of those really big
i nventions that is an indispensable part of
everyday life.So that your shoes know more
about you eve ry day than the doctor has eve r

Making this technology more intuitive and

are intimate with us phy s i c a l l y, we begin to
think about technology differently.We begin to
think that it is accessible, r e a c h a b l e , c r e at i ve

The key to many embedded technologi e s

Imagine a smart box of corn

make mundane tasks as easy and automatic

Place a can of mushroom soup, an old

more than you need? 
As with many new technologies, we will
need to balance the issues of access and
privacy.Your car company may remind you
when you need a tune-up, but by tracking
your mileage they will also know when to
send you advertisements for a new car.
Yet beyond these commercial interests,
there is a wider concern lurking in the
b a c k ground of this smart new
wo r l d . Media scholar and MIT
l i t e r ature professor Henry
Jenkins reminds us that the
h i s t o ry of technology has alway s
been coupled with fear of the
new tools. “ W h at is basic to
these fears is the sense that we
are giving over too much
control over our lives to

Although sponsors cannot dictate or initiate
research areas, they are considered collaborators in

same time, “ We have too long a history of
watching technology fail in our daily lives.”
As Jenkins explains, “ Trusting the
machine means not simply trusting the
technology itself , which seems alien and
unreliable, but also trusting the companies
which made it,which are often perceived as
out for quick profit, planning for
o b s o l e s c e n c e , disinterested in consumers ’
real needs and sloppy in their wo r k m a n s h i p.
W h at if we make our culture more and more
dependent upon machines which we do not

and do not trust?” n

### 113638: Manuel Vázquez Montalbán: writing is an act of free choice
Manuel Vázquez 
“Writing is an   
With a dose of humour, the successful Catalan author 
discusses such serious topics as society, politics, his craft—and
why he writes detective novels
Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
n Did you know there are over 200
entries for Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
on the search engines of the Internet? 
Manuel Vázquez Montalbán: I only knew of
t wo pages on the Intern e t . One of them
made me out to be an Italian and the other
an A m e rican of Galician extraction called
C o l m e i r o. I know both pages exist, but I
h ave n ’t looked any further into them. I had
the Internet installed not long ago and
I’m not yet an expert brow s e r , far from it.
n Why is it that a man like you, who
writes poetry, essays and opinion
columns and has always kept up with
international events with so critical an
eye, should suddenly start writing
detective novels?
M . V. M . : The fact is that the whole of
l i t e r at u r e , absolutely all of it, is divided into
d e t e c t i ve novels and romantic nove l s.
Quote me any title from any of the wo r l d ’s
l i t e r ature and you will find that the subject
m atter either deals with an inve s t i g ation into
the violation of a taboo, in short a cri m e ,
or else is a love story.
Detective novels,as originally invented,
with a fixed imagi n at i ve wo r l d , are a ve ry
run-of-the-mill and predictable genre.
However,the modern detective novel of the
past thirty or forty ye a rs shouldn’t be properly
d e s c ribed as such. T h e y ’re novels like any
o t h e rs in which, b a s i c a l l y, an inve s t i g ation is
conducted into the meaning of a social cri m e .
As for how the subject is handled, in my
opinion there’s no difference compared with
a novel that ’s not in the “ d e t e c t i ve ”c at e g o ry.
I regard John Le Carré and Graham Greene
as being as ambitious in their literary aims
as V i r ginia Wo o l f. I know that sounds heretical
but I firmly believe it.W h at interests me is that
it’s possible to start out from a set character
and turn the story almost into a saga about
the evolution of a society.
n How do you explain the success of
Carvalho, the private detective who is
the main character in your novels?
M . V. M . : I think he’s an intern at i o n a l
success for one reason: h e ’s been a mirr o r
not only of the transition that ’s taken place
in Spain but transition in a broader sense.
H e ’s a man who recreates the at m o s p h e r e
of the 1960s, a time which held out gr e at
hopes of ecological change and saw the
a rri val of hippies, the birth control pill,
freedom in eve ry form and gentle, l y ri c a l
r e vo l u t i o n s.T h e r e ’s also a kind of fin - d e - s i è c l e
d e s p a i r , in which people are scared of losing
their jobs and catching Aids and afraid of
f r e e d o m , a fear that the Pope in Rome and
the manipulat o rs of labour markets, a m o n g
o t h e rs ,h ave succeeded in instilling in them
through a sort of repressive mechanism.
C a rvalho has mirrored all these things in
the novels and that ’s why I think that what
he has to say can be heard in so many
p l a c e s.
n Why does cooking occupy so 
important a place in your books,
to the extent that it is almost like
a character?
M . V. M . : In the first place, i t ’s because the
only thing I can do, a p a rt from wri t e , is cook.
S e c o n d , because it is a necessary
i n gr e d i e n t , especially in the Carva l h o
s eri e s ; cooking is hardly ever mentioned in
my other nove l s.A set character has to have
t wo or three recognizable quirks. T h e r e
i s n ’t a single character who doesn’t have them.
E ve rybody who reads Georges Simenon ’s
M a i gret novels knows he’s waiting for the
f i rst seasonal dishes, the first spring peas
in the b ra s s e ri e, no matter how they’r e
p r e p a r e d , and draught beer the way they
only serve it in a particular bar.R e a d e rs wa i t
for that to happen; they wait for Sherlock
Holmes to play the violin or start sniffing.
I gave Carvalho one or two of those traits
and I’ve had to respect them from one
n ovel to the next.
I believe , m o r e ove r , t h at cooking is
also a metaphor for one’s own culture.
I ’ ve sometimes stressed this. Cooking is the
d e ath mask. In order to eat we have to
k i l l , whether it be a head of lettuce or an
a n i m a l . If the act is a direct one, in other
words if you kill and then eat , it is an act
of barbari s m . On the other hand, if you kill,
cook and then eat , the cultural aspect
a p p e a rs ; this invo l ves applying to the act
of killing a skill or technology that adds
dignity and turns it into culture.
n What about book-burning, your hero’s
other quirk?
M.V. M.: On several occasions Carvalho says
he bu rns books because literature has not
taught him how to live .T h at ’s a meaningless
e x a g g e r at i o n , but it’s a ritual the character
has to perform.
n In literary terms, is Carvalho ever going
to die?

Montalbán:
  act of free choice”
M . V. M . : This poses a serious credibility
problem for me. C a rvalho is a man I
o ri ginally shut myself up with and I
reckoned on giving him more or less a
c e rtain age, but I kept on forgetting.
H owe ve r , the character’s psychologi c a l
d e velopment corresponds to his phy s i c a l
d e ve l o p m e n t , and that makes it ve ry hard
for Carvalho to surv i ve as a pri vat e
d e t e c t i ve because aggr e s s i ve n e s s ,p hy s i c a l
strength and a whole gamut of fa c i a l
expressions are invo l ve d , and frankly he
cannot afford such luxuri e s. So in the
millennium nove l , which I hope will come
out in the year 2000, either I can pension
him off and get r id of him after he’s
r e t u rned to the world with Biscuter (a
f o rmer convict who is the detective ’s
a s s i s t a n t ) , or I can turn him into something
e l s e .
I once thought of turning Carvalho into
a spy, w h at might be called a post-modern spy
working for new powers that never had any
spies before, like autonomous regi o n a l
authorities, or a municipal, environmental,
industrial or ethnic spy.That sort of thing is
going to be big business in the future.In the
p r e s e n t - d ay division of conflicts in the wo r l d ,
as essayists like Alvin Toffler and Hans
Magnus Enzensberger have actually
p r e d i c t e d ,i n f o rm ation services will be needed
in the new climate of conflict that is liable to
t rigger future civil wa rs. So why not turn
Carvalho into a spy for the Generalitat,the
p r ovincial gove rnment of Cat a l o n i a , with all
the ove rtones of irony and symbolism of
setting that could imply? I’m thinking about
it as a possibility, but I don’t know yet whether
I shall go ahead or not.
n How do you go about creating your
books?
M. V. M.: I use a very conventional system in
which I accumulate facts and ideas.The poet
T. S . Eliot describes this creat i ve process ve ry
c l e a r l y. One stage consists of gat h e ring the
m at e ri a l s , whether consciously or
unconsciously. Sometimes you accumulate
things you initially don’t think will end up
as a book, a novel or a poem. Even so, you
keep on building them up as a reserve , a sort
of storehouse.When these mat e rials are dense
e n o u g h , they look for a way out. I t ’s rather like
the moraine of a glacier which goes on piling
up debris until the time comes for it to seek
an outlet, when a current emerges.T h at ’s
how I see the creative process.
n In your writing, how do you manage to
identify with places like Argentina or
Bangkok so closely it’s as though you
had lived there?
M . V. M . : F i rs t , t h e r e ’s the inform at i o n -
g at h e ring process I just mentioned. T h e n
there’s the fact that people’s ideological and
emotional patterns are coming increasingly
to resemble each other because we consume
the same food and the same cultural and
media products. Our living pat t e rns and
production relations are becoming more and
more alike.That means we can understand
much more about how we ourselves behave
and how other people behave.
A ristotle is supposed to have said “ yo u
are what you eat.” It’s a fact that,in cultural
terms,all of us eat virtually the same things.
The closest we can come to living in a
Barcelona suburb and watching television is
living in a Bangkok suburb and wat c h i n g
television, because all of us watch the same
American programmes in any case.
n Is that why Barcelona is almost like
another character in most of your
novels?
M .V. M . : Ye s. Barcelona is a port and a city of
t r a n s i t .I t ’s also a place where many memori e s
exist side-by-side.All that makes it a multi-
faceted city in eve ry sense. Such cities tend to
be very interesting from the literary point of
view. Many cities have literary associations
and others do not. A considerable amount
of writing has been devoted to Barcelona, a s
it has to Buenos Aires and many other cities.
In the United Stat e s , for example, a whole
imaginary world has been created by books
and films on San Francisco and New Yo r k , ye t
that hardly exists in the case of  Washington.
n What does Barcelona mean to you
personally?
M.V. M.: It’s my homeland,in the true sense
of the word. It is the place where you were
b o rn ,where your refle xes were shaped,w h e r e
you learnt that other people exist and how
much they are threatening or well-disposed
towards you.It’s the place where you learnt
codes of conduct—all kinds, not only hav i n g
to do with language—and where you also
l e a rnt to pick up a system of signals that make
you feel you belong to that particular parcel
of territory more than to any other.
As you rationalize all this, you come to
a gree with Saint-Exupéry that yo u ’re from the
c o u n t ry of your childhood, since childhood
is a piece of physical and emotional terri t o ry.
T h at ’s what Barcelona means to me.
More specific a l l y, I ’d say I’m not so much
from Barcelona as from a part i c u l a r
neighbourhood of the city.T h at ’s what marks
you in the first place,although then you tr y
to generalize and absorb other cultural
f e atures and pat t e rn s.T h at ’s what Barcelona
basically represents for me. M o r e ove r ,
because of its layout and history, i t ’s not just
one conventional city but a dive rsity of cities
because it’s an amalgam of different
a r c h a e o l o gical peri o d s. T h e y ’re not only
monumental,such as the Romanesque city,
the Gothic city, the neo-classical city, the city
of m o d e rn i s m o and of Gaudí, but represent
different periods of archaeology as they relat e
to human beings. Barcelona is a city that
attracted va rious migr at o ry movements which
g ave rise to the incorp o r ation of new strands
and to a degree of cross-fert i l i z ation follow i n g
the clash with the culture that came before.
M o r e ove r , Barcelona was largely shaped
at the end of the last century by the influx of
C atalans from the country s i d e ,wo r k i n g - c l a s s
people who flocked there to join the industri a l
r e vo l u t i o n .H e n c e , it was a gat h e ring-place for
people from the grassroots all over the
country.
n You’ve always had a sense of political
commitment. Do you think writers are
bound to be militants?
M.V. M.: Absolutely.Writing is an act of free
c h o i c e . Some wri t e rs need to get invo l ved in
social and political issues and others do not.
All we ask of a writer is that he or she should
w rite we l l . I subscribe to the theory, which is
in fact quite widespread,that there is always
something ideological in what all wri t e rs have
to offer, although they may seem to be

### 113638: Manuel Vázquez Montalbán: writing is an act of free choice
T A L K I N G  T O …
48 The UNESCO Courier - October 1998
A n o n - s t o p n o v e l i s t
Li ke his hero, the detective Pe p e
C a r va l h o,Manuel Vázquez Montalbán
(born Barcelona, 1939) looks upon
himself as taking a walk through history.
Considering his wide-ranging and varied
l i t e rary output, a journalist was not
entirely wrong when he jokingly said,
“With Vázquez Montalbán, no sooner
have you finished reviewing his last novel
than the next one is already in the
b o o k s h o p s.” Montalbán readily admits
that he is a workaholic and that he has
written more than he has lived.“One day
I shall have to stop writing in order to
remember how to live,” he once told an
interviewer.
His style, with its peculiar mix of
c r i t i c i s m , humour and ingenuity, is an
outstanding feature of his writing.Such
books as Crónica sentimental de España
( “A Sentimental Chronicle of Spain”), M i s
almuerzos con gente inquietante ( “ M y
Lunches with Disturbing Pe o p l e ” ) , E l
escriba sentado ( “ The Seated Scribe”),
M a n i fiesto subnormal ( “ The Sub-normal
Manifesto”) or Un polaco en la Corte del
Rey Juan Carlos (“A Pole at the Court of
King Juan Carlos”) reflect his penetra t i n g
vision of present-day reality.
A novelist, essayist and poet, V á z q u e z
Montalbán has never stopped working as
a journalist.In his weekly column in Spain’s
newspaper El País, as well as in Italy’s L a
Repubblica and France’s Le Monde
D i p l o m a t i q u e, he comments on the world
scene by analysing the political and social
situation or everyday events.
The sequence of novels featuring
Carvalho began in 1972 with Yo Mate a
K e n n e d y (“I Killed Ke n n e d y ” ) , w h i c h
brought the author international success.
The Galician detective, “a former CIA
a g e n t ,a former member of the Communist
Pa r t y, a capricious, self-taught and life-
enhancing figure, prone to violence in
many of his attitudes and reactions”, h a s
over 25 years of fictional life behind him
and commands the allegiance of a host of
fans who have set up clubs and e-mail
discussion groups and even opened bars
named after him.The hero of over twenty
n o v e l s, i n c l u d i n g Southern Seas ( w h i c h
won Spain’s prestigious Planeta Prize in
1979 and the Prix International de
Littérature Policière in 1981), La Soledad
del Manager (The Angst-Ridden
Executive), La Rosa de Alejandría (“The
Rose of A l e x a n d r i a ” ) , El Premio ( “ Th e
Prize”) and Quinteto de Buenos Aires
(“Buenos Aires Quintet”), C a r valho has
made several more or less successful
f o rays into fil m , television and even comic
strips.
Vázquez Montalbán has also written
semi-fictional books based on historical
f i g u r e s, including the prize-winning
Autbiografía del General Franco
( “A u t o b i o g raphy of General Fra n c o ” ) ,
Pasionaria y los siete enanitos ( “ L a
Pasionaria and the Seven Dwarfs”),and
his latest work, O César o nada (“Caesar
or Nothing”), which is set in the Rome of
the Borgias.
His poetic works include Liquidación de
restos de serie (“Sales of Last Season’s
C l o t h e s ” ) , Movimientos sin éxito
(“Unsuccessful Movements”), Coplas a la
muerte de mi tía Daniela ( “ Verses on the
Death of My Aunt Daniela”), A la sombra
de las muchachas en flor (“Within a
Budding Grove”), Praga ( “ P ra g u e ” ) a n d
Pero el viajero que huye (“But the Tra v e l l e r
Who Flees”).
A fine gourmet, a magnificent cook
and a fan of football, which he regards
as a “secular religion”, V á z q u e z
Montalbán has always upheld the
ideological tenets of the left, which is why
he spent time in Fra n c o ’s prisons when
he was a young man.
A writer who describes himself as
“Spanish-Catalan and perhaps European or
E u ra f r i c a n ” , in 1995 he was awarded the
National Prize of Spanish Letters for his
body of work.He is a graduate in philosophy
and litera t u r e, and the Universidad
Autónoma de Barcelona conferred an
h o n o rary docto rate on him in 1997.
Modest and unassuming,he is known to
his colleagues and friends simply as
Manolo. n
completely impervious to that sort of thing.
They can always be read in terms of ideology,
of taking a stand in the eyes of the world and
in our own eye s.Yet we must respect the free
choice writers make,the fact that they want
to feel they’re in touch with real-life causes
and with their inner selves.
n You recently went to Cuba and reported
on the visit of Pope John Paul II. Was
that your decision or the idea of the
editors of El País, the newspaper you
write for?
M .V. M . : I went to Cuba to collect mat e rial for
my next book and when the newspaper found
out I was going there they asked me to write
some art i c l e s. E ve rything you see before yo u
comes from Cuba—all the folders , t h e
d o c u m e n t s , the books—eve rything on the
tables has to do with Cuba,because I’m in full
c r e at i ve gear. T h at ’s why it looks like a
battlefield.
n What was the significance of that visit,
as you see it?
M .V. M . : I feel that the Po p e ’s visit to Cuba wa s
f u n d a m e n t a l , because it’s astonishing that ,
at the end of the twentieth century, no lesser
a personage than the Pope should purp o rt
to be the saviour of a Marxist revo l u t i o n . I see
it as something midway between a cari c at u r e
and a miracle.
n What do you think the future holds in
store for Europe? What role can a
united Europe play in a globalized
world?
M. V. M.: I think that whatever idea one may
have of Europe,it cannot be separated from
the idea of globalization.When the idea of a
united Europe was put forwa r d , people we r e
thinking more in terms of power blocs.T h e y
thought Europe could be a third way.T h e
first instinct was to prevent the recurr e n c e
of conflicting interests that had arisen in the
s t ruggle for the European market, which had
t riggered two world wa rs.T h at gave rise to the
image of Europe as a bloc which could
compete with the A m e rican and Asian blocs.
N ow we ’re faced with the broader issue of
g l o b a l i z at i o n . I think the idea of a united
Europe is still attractive because it includes
one distinctive feature:the fact that Europe
has a cultural substratum that ’s different from
all other possible blocs. This cultural
s u b s t r atum still weighs heavily in all the
s t ruggles for emancipat i o n , equality and
freedom that have formed part of the history
of Europe. A European interp r e t ation of the
g l o b a l i z ation of capital is bound to differ from
t h at of a culture like that of the United Stat e s ,
where policy is geared to achieving results or
to making the system run more efficiently.
On the other hand, in European policy,
e ve rything depends on the people conducting
i t . E ven so, t h e r e ’s still a backgr o u n d , a
substratum that remembers the struggle for
e m a n c i p ation and social gains. T h i s
i n t e rp r e t ation differs from that of capitalistic
development.That’s how I see things.
n What if things don’t turn out like that?
M .V.M . : If things we r e n ’t like that , I think I’d
lose interest in the whole project.But if the
Europe taking shape were to have a domestic
and foreign policy and a more committed
p o l i cy towards North-South relat i o n s , i t
would be the kind of Europe I could take an
interest in. On the other hand, if it’s going to
be just another bloc adopting the same policy
as other blocs,there would obviously be no
other course than to accept it as it is, but in
t h at case I wo u l d n ’t be interested in it. I
b e l i e ve the aim and purpose of a united
Europe will largely depend on the relat i o n s h i p
between the forces existing within it. If the
hard-line neo-liberal sectors of unbri d l e d
capitalism end up imposing their will,E u r o p e
will become an uncontrolled capitalist bloc.
n How do you feel about the new
electronic communication media? Do
you think audio-visual culture will
replace the culture of writing?
M .V. M . : Until now,e ve ry innovation that has
appeared in the media has led to arguments
over whether it was going to spell the demise
of books. All the gloomiest predictions have
been off the mark.Each medium has had its
own terri t o ry and its own basic function.
Perhaps it will be easier for the yo u n g e r
g e n e r at i o n s , who are already used to

c o m p u t e rs as working tools. But I don’t think
it’ll ever be possible to read a literary text on
a computer screen. It may be possible to
c r e ate new forms of literary expression via
the screen, but they wo n ’t have the nove l ’s
substance,time-span or length. New forms
t h at are somehow connected with computers
m ay well emerge, but I think that the
traditional forms are very closely bound up
with the formal shape of books, with the
o p e r ation that makes it possible to re-read
them and go back and forth in them, a n d
with the tactile sensation of the object, t h e
vehicle of literature epitomized by books.
n You’ve received an honorary doctorate
from the Universidad Autónoma de
Barcelona. What did that mean to you?
M .V. M . : It wa s n ’t a gr e at symbolic ceremony,
since nobody wore gowns or that sort of thing.
It was just as my Italian publisher described
it when she said it was like a “ h a p p e n i n g ”
from May 1968. E ve rybody was ve ry relaxe d
and inform a l . I hardly noticed the ritual side,
but obviously I was deeply move d . In a sense,
the work I published on the history of
communication had borne fruit.
I have ve ry special memories of that
u n i ve rs i t y. When I was in prison I wrote a
book entitled I n fo rme sobre la info rm a c i ó n
( R e p o rt on Info rm at i o n ), which I published
in 1963.All the material I used came from
UN E S C O, since that was the only source I wa s
a l l owed to read in pri s o n .T h at ’s why my book
is so much like the MacBride Report ,
although if I may say so myself my work was
published firs t , since I based it on UN E S C O’s
r e p o rts on the inequality of newspri n t
distribution,the unequal distribution of the
main news agencies,and so on.In Spain the
book was like the one-eyed man in the land
of the blind, although I wrote it when I was
t we n t y - t wo using mat e rials that were far from
a d e q u at e . At a time when access to all the
literature on communication was restricted
by the Franco regime or by the social doctri n e
of the Church, which wa s n ’t much better,
the book was a sort of healing balm. It was
used in secret by journalism schools and
scholars.
I strengthened this link with the unive rs i t y
by later becoming a lecturer in
c o m m u n i c at i o n , conducting a number of
s e m i n a rs and publishing some books.All that
f o rms part of my life’s substrat a , and my
admission to the university implies that this
aspect of my work has been recognized.
n Do you think young people can look to
the twenty-first century with hope?
M . V. M . : One should never gi ve advice to
a ny b o d y, or messages of hope for that
m at t e r. If we look at things in a fa i r l y
cynical light, in the best sense of the wo r d ,
young people are going to need hope,
although that implies self-deception. I f
you do not have a modicum of hope or
confidence in the future, e ven though yo u
h ave to deceive yo u rs e l f, you would reach
such a pitch of lucidity that the most
advisable course would be to commit
individual and collective suicide.To have
hope you have to have a certain capacity
for self-deception—or such extraordinary
faith in your future plans, whether they have
to do with religi o n ,l ove , society or ideology,
t h at you overcome eve rything in your pat h .
T h at ’s not easy in this day and age because
i t ’s ve ry hard to believe in gr e at professions
of faith after seeing what ’s happened in
h i s t o ry. As a result, we must come to the
conclusion that hope is necessary for
p u rsuing the mechanical game of existence.
W h at we do have to abide by, w h at I conve y
in eve rything I wri t e , is the fact that we ’r e
standing at a rather ominous point in time
as far as culture is concern e d . W h at the
dominant culture is now instilling in us
a b ove all is that historical knowledge and the
search for the past are pointless, and that
i m a gining utopias and thinking that things
could be different are likewise pointless.
By trying to analyse why these two
cultural trends should have cropped up at
the same time, we find that they dove t a i l
perfectly and make you attentive only to the
p r e s e n t .You never pass judgment on the
spectacle of social or economic disorder,n o r
do you seek to find out where that disorder
o ri gi n at e s. Since they’ve depri ved you of the
right to find out who in the past is to be
blamed for the present, h i s t o ry is also left
without anybody to blame. T h at ’s what
interests them.
S e c o n d ,when you say we should organize
things differently, they tell you yo u ’re a
dangerous utopian and don’t realize where
the utopian dreams of the twentieth century
h ave led us, t h at nothing forces you to accept
w h at they’re offering yo u , whether it be order,
the labour market, N o rth-South relations or
r e l ations between the centre and the
p e ri p h e ry. If you say things can be done
d i f f e r e n t l y, i t ’s almost as if yo u ’re branded
with the stigma of post-revo l u t i o n a ry
nostalgia.
So if you’re to believe in the future, first
you have to think of retrieving the past and of
k n owing the causes behind the life yo u ’r e
n ow leading, and to exercise the right to
change what you fin d ,which is inherent in any
new venture. n

‘ Tell us what you really think” a b o u t
our new form at , we asked readers
in our July-August double issue.
The question elicited so many replies that
u n f o rt u n ately we are unable to answe r
each one pers o n a l l y.And here there is only
enough space to focus on the recurri n g
themes among the comments and
suggestions you made.
In short , nearly all of you want us to
continue in the new direction the C o u ri e r h a s
t a k e n . “The project seems interesting,” o n e
r e a d e r , whose name was illegi b l e , w r o t e
c a u t i o u s l y.E ve ryone else was more cat e g o ri c a l .
“ T h a n k s. My most sincere
c o m p l i m e n t s ,” C . Bachelier commented
l a c o n i c a l l y. “I like the new form at . T h e
magazine is ve ry inform at i ve ,” said Kim
B u rn h a m . “The new layout will be much
useful for us,” noted Krishna Mani
Bhandary, a librarian.“The new format is a
s u c c e s s ,” wrote François Pat rice Fe rr o n .
From A r g e n t i n a , M a rio E. Sisti sent
“congratulations on the new design as well
as the fa s c i n ating content.” M a l ay s i a ’s
permanent delegate to UNESCO thinks “the
new C o u ri e r is ve ry at t r a c t i ve with its new
c over design and va ri e d , quality art i c l e s.”
Jacqueline Dupuis sent us a cheque to take
out a subscription in the name of any reader
we choose because,she wrote,“I increasingly
enjoy the Courier and its relevant analysis of
the issues it deals with.”
One reader,Martine Bonnaud,strongly
d i s a gr e e d . She “ r e gr e t t e d ” t h at the C o u ri e r
had turned into “just a good ru n - o f - t h e - m i l l
m a g a z i n e . Jo u rn a l i s t s , she said,were gr a d u a l l y
taking over from “ t o p - r a n k i n g ” s c i e n t i s t s ,
writers and artists.
Her criticism prompts us to make three
points. First, we want to give our readers a
theoretical overview of today’s major issues
as well as report on the grassroots realities.I n
order to do that , we must necessarily ask
qualified journalists to write feature stories.
Second, we pay close attention to ensuring
t h at articles by top-ranking experts from
around the world continue to figure
prominently in the C o u ri e r.T h at is one of the
main reasons we exist.F i n a l l y, you will notice
that leading specialists also have an indirect
voice in the articles written by our journ a l i s t s ,
because they go straight to the source for
facts and analysis.
Three recurring themes emerged from
your suggestions.Guy Langlais,who has been
a subscriber “since the 1950s,” w r o t e ,“ F i f t y
ye a rs have gone by and the same problems are
still besetting and eating away at most of the
wo r l d ’s societies. There has been some
p r o gr e s s , but in most places conditions have
d e t e ri o r at e d , often seriously and sometimes
i rr e ve rs i b l y.” He concludes, “ we must
d e n o u n c e . . . the illusions, the evils, t h e
d i s t o rt i o n s , the empty innovat i o n s , the throw -
away society. . . and support resistance,w h i c h
is vital. I t ’s up to you to wake us up.O t h e r w i s e
you will serve no purpose.”
In what areas? Mainly, s u s t a i n a b l e
d e velopment in a broad sense—equitable
and co-operat i ve deve l o p m e n t , p ri m a ri l y
between the North and the South, rich and
poor—and the env i r o n m e n t . But the C o u ri e r
is not in the business of painting the gloomiest
possible picture. The magazine also
highlights, in the words of Francis Dubois,
“the successful experi m e n t s. . .t h at encourage
us to keep on trying”.
M a ny readers also asked us to bring back
the letters page.So that’s just what we did.
