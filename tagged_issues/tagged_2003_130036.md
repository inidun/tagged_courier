861 million adults ‚Äì nearly one sixth of the 
 world‚Äôs population - cannot read or write. 
Most have never attended school or did 
so only for a brief period.  Grinding poverty, but also the 
wars, famine and natural disasters that displace populations 
for years or more, are generally to blame, but not always. 
Available evidence suggests that functional illiteracy ‚Äì the 
inability to decipher labels or the ordinary instructions 
required to fill out a form or apply for a job ‚Äì affects as 
many as one quarter of citizens in some of the world‚Äôs more 
affluent societies. More and better educational facilities 
and systems are required to help a huge number of our 
contemporaries out of the poverty trap to which illiteracy, 
among other factors, has confined them.
Making good on the promise of sound primary 
education for all children everywhere by 2015 ‚Äì the goal 
solemnly proclaimed at the Dakar World Education Forum 
in 2000 by the representatives of the vast majority of 
world‚Äôs States ‚Äì is obviously the place to start. But the 
progress recorded so far gives little cause for optimism. Of 
the 164 countries that committed themselves to achieving 
education for all by 2015, 70, it now appears, may fall short. 
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa, but also included 
are Bangladesh, China, India and Pakistan ‚Äì four countries 
which together account for 61 percent of the world‚Äôs 
illiterate adults today.
In this, its second issue, UNESCO‚Äôs new Courier, in 
cooperation with a team of international correspondents 
from The Times Education Supplement in London, takes 
a hard look at the issues to be addressed and some of the 
challenges to be overcome in the course of the United 
Nations Literacy Decade (2003-12). The picture it draws is 
sobering, but not hopeless. New approaches which seek to 
eliminate cultural and linguistic barriers, and to tie literacy 
training with activities critical to people‚Äôs daily lives, have 
shown considerable potential in the countries where they 
have been introduced. Better yet, two of those countries, we 
discovered, are Bangladesh and India.

Nobel Prizes 2002
The Swedish Academy 
awarded its 2002 Nobel 
Prizes during ceremonies 
held in Stockholm and 
Oslo on December 10. 
Jimmy Carter, president 
of the United States from 
1977 to 1981, received 
the Nobel Peace Prize 
‚Äúfor his decades of 
untiring effort to find 
peaceful solutions to 
international conflicts, to 
advance democracy and 
human rights, and to 
promote economic and 
social development.‚Äù
The Literature prize 
recognized the work 
of Hungarian author 
Imre Kert√©sz, a survivor 
of Nazi concentration 
camps, whose writing 
‚Äúupholds the fragile 
experience of the 
individual against the 
barbaric arbitrariness of 
history.‚Äù
Masatoshi Koshiba 
(Japan) and Riccardo 
Giacconi and Raymond 
Davis (USA) won the 
Physics Nobel Prize, 
for their pioneering 
contributions to 
astrophysics. In 
Medicine, Sydney 
Brenner and John 
Sulston (UK), along with 
Robert Horvitz (USA), 
were distinguished 
for their discoveries 
concerning genetic 
regulation of organ 
development and 
programmed cell death.
John Fenn (US), 
Koichi Tanaka (Japan) 
and Kurt W√ºrthrich 
(Switzerland) received 
the Chemistry Nobel 
Prize for advances 
in methods to 
identify biological 
macromolecules. Daniel 
Kahneman and Vernon 
Smith (USA) were the 
laureates in Economic 
Sciences, for integrating 
insights from psychology 
into economics and 
developing experimental 
tools for analysis.
Press freedom: 
the barometer drops
Colombia once again tops the list 
of the most dangerous country for 
journalists to work in, with ten 
assassinations in 2002, followed by 
Russia (four), Mexico (three) and 
the Philippines (three), says the 
World Association of Newspapers 
in its most recent press freedom 
review. As of November 2002, 
41 journalists had been assassinated 
in the year and at least 119 remained 
in jail. Nepal has the highest 
number of imprisoned journalists 
(24), followed by Eritrea (18), 
Myanmar/Burma (15), China (11) 
and Iran (10). The review finds 
that press freedom is increasingly 
threatened, with little or no progress 
in countries with long-standing 
freedom of expression problems. 
In some areas where progress has 
been identified (Namibia, West 
Africa, El Salvador, Honduras, 
Mexico and Eastern Europe), recent 
developments make it clear that the 
media still has a long 
way to go before press 
freedom is enforced.

Cuba honours its 
‚Äúsincere man‚Äù
‚ÄúMy job is to sing 
the beautiful, ignite 
enthusiasm for the 
noble, admire and 
spark admiration 
for all that is 
great,‚Äù wrote poet, 
journalist, diplomat 
and ‚Äòapostle‚Äô of 
Cuba‚Äôs independence, 
Jos√© Mart√≠. The 
150th anniversary 
of his birth is being 
celebrated throughout 
2003. Born in La 
Havana in 1853, 
Mart√≠ published 
extensively on Cuban 
independence, 
the unity of Latin 
American and 
Caribbean nations, 
and the notion of 
universal concord. 
Imprisoned for his 
ideas, he was exiled in 
Spain and Mexico. He 
later moved to New 
York where he lived 
for 15 years, working 
as a diplomat and 
journalist. Granted an 
amnesty, he returned 
to Cuba where he died 
in 1895, during the 
independence struggle 
waged in Spain‚Äôs 
last colony in the 
Americas.
His anniversary 
is marked by the 
publication of a 
critical edition of 
his complete works. 
Another high point 
was the ‚ÄúInternational 
Conference for 
World Equilibrium‚Äù, 
held in La Havana 
from January 27-29, 
sponsored by 
UNESCO, the 
Organization of 
Ibero-American 
States and the Latin 
American Parliament. 
Participants discussed 
global social and 
cultural inequities. 
The Cuban poet 
summed up his 
identity in one of his 
most universally 
sung verses: ‚ÄúA sincere 
man am I/ From the 
land where palm trees 
grow.‚Äù

The Arab world‚Äôs 
three defecits
Despite considerable 
progress in many 
areas, the Arab States 
are threatened by 
‚Äúinertia‚Äù, states the 
first Arab Human 
Development Report, 
published by the 
UNDP in 2002.
Over the past three 
decades, notes the 
report, health and 
education have 
greatly improved and 
the struggle against 
poverty has gained 
ground throughout 
the region, which, 
with 280 million 
people accounts for 
five percent of the 
world‚Äôs population. 
Life expectancy has 
increased by 15 years 
and infant mortality 
has fallen by two 
thirds. The levels of 
adult illiteracy and 
absolute poverty have 
also been signicantly 
reduced.
However, the report 
adds, over the past 
20 years, growth in 
per capita income 
has been the lowest 
in the world, except 
in sub-Saharan 
Africa. According 
to the report, three 
‚Äúdefecits‚Äù explain 
this stagnation: 
freedom, women‚Äôs 
empowerment and 
knowledge. In terms 
of freedom, the 
the Arab region, 
compared with 
other world regions, 
is at the bottom of 
the ladder. At least 
50 percent of Arab 
women do not know 
how to read or write. 
Treated as second 
degree citizens in 
several countries, they 
are even discriminated 
against by national 
legal systems. Finally, 
the report stresses the 
low level of research 
and development 
(scientific spending 
accounts for only 0.5 
percent of GDP) and 
the virtually inexistant 
access to information 
and communication 
technologies: only 0.6 
percent of Arabs use 
the internet.
Solidarity‚Ä¶.
When Ma Yan‚Äôs illiterate and 
impoverished mother thrust 
a letter and a diary written 
by her 14 year-old daughter 
into the hands of a French 
journalist early last year, 
she had no idea that she 
was about to transform not 
only her own family‚Äôs life, 
but also the lives of dozens 
of others in China‚Äôs remote 
north-western Ningxia 
province. 
‚ÄúHow can you condemn 
me to this misery? I want 
to study!‚Äù wrote Ma Yan, 
who, like many other young 
girls in her region was being 
withdrawn from school 
because her family could no 
longer afford to send her. 
Her letter, a veritable plea 
for the right to an education, 
was published by the French 
daily, Lib√©ration, provoking 
a wave of solidarity from 
readers in several countries 
who formed an association 
to keep Ma Yan and other 
children like her in Ningxia 
in school. Her diary has also 
been published in France 
and has become a best seller. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a dream,‚Äù she says. 
Today, 
the Children 
of Ningxia 
Association funds 
the education of 
30 children, 28 of 
them girls, and has 
become a ray of 
hope for Ningxia‚Äôs isolated 
communities.

Genetics :
data at risk
Human genetic data helps 
us to know more about 
many of the illnesses we 
suffer from and raises 
hopes of new treatments. 
But the collection of 
such data is treated with 
suspicion by many, largely 
because of fears that the 
information gleaned could 
lead to discrimination in 
areas such as employment 
or insurance.  ‚ÄúWe are 
seeing individuals who 
opt not to participate in 
research because of the 
fear that this information 
could fall into the wrong 
hands and be used to 
deny them a job or a 
promotion,‚Äù says Francis 
S. Collins, director of the 
National Human Genome 
Research Institute in the 
United States. According to 
a survey of 344 members 
of the Association of 
American Physicians, 
87 percent reported that 
their patients had asked 
that certain data not be 
included in their file, and 
78 percent had complied 
with these requests. 
Meanwhile, a Canadian 
study of 35 gene banks, 
found that less than 
40 percent of them were 
correctly protected against 
hackers.

Bemoaning 
the daily grunt
So long Dolly
Television and parents 
who no longer talk to 
their children are affecting 
British children‚Äôs language 
skills, reports the UK 
government‚Äôs Basic 
Skill‚Äôs Agency. Director, 
Alan Wells told the daily 
Guardian newspaper 
(Jan.8) that communication 
had deteriorated to the 
‚Äúdaily grunt‚Äù as families 
spent too much time 
watching tv or in front of a 
computer screen, and not 
enough in conversation 
around the dinner table.
In Wales, where the 
Agency has set up a 
programme to teach parents 
how to play creatively with 
their children, Mr Wells 
estimates that 50 percent of 
children were not ready to 
start primary school at age 
five because of their lack of 
linguistic ability.
Dolly, the world‚Äôs 
most famous sheep, 
was euthanized in 
February at the Roslin 
Institute in Edinburgh 
(Scotland), where she 
was created in 1997.  
The first mammal 
cloned from an adult 
cell had an incurable 
and progressive 
lung disease that 
commonly afflicts 
old sheep. At six 
years old, which is 
about half the life 
expectancy of her 
breed, and despite a 
normal appearance, 
Dolly also suffered 
numerous 
chromosome 
anomalies and 
arthritis.
Her relatively 
premature death 
reinforces the 
arguments of the 
many who oppose 
human cloning, 
including Ian Wilmut, 
Dolly‚Äôs ‚Äúmaker‚Äù. 
According to the 
British scientist, 
who has thoroughly 
researched the 
subject, all of the 
world‚Äôs cloned 
animals have genetic 
problems and physical 
deformities.
Off the menu forever ?
Order cod and chips, with banana 
ice cream for dessert in 2015 
and you may be told they are 
‚Äúoff the menu‚Äù. Stocks of cod in 
European waters, according to 
the International Council for the 
Exploration of the Sea (ICES), 
are likely to follow the demise 
of the Grand Bank fisheries off 
Newfoundland (Canada) that 
have never recovered from over-
fishing despite a total ban in the 
1990s. The European Union has 
introduced some controls but failed 
to impose the total ban ICES was 
calling for. Meanwhile, according 
to New Scientist magazine, the 
banana, staple crop in many 
developing countries, could be 
driven extinct. As most cultivated 
bananas are sterile hybrids and 
come from a small selection of 
original plant genomes (genetic 
blueprints), they cannot naturally 
mutate and produce varieties 
able to resist the diseases that are 
ravaging the plants worldwide. 
The only solution could be through 
genetic engineering.
Of mice and men
The common laboratory 
mouse is providing a 
bounty of new clues 
for scientists trying to 
understand and treat the 
development of human 
disease. A consortium of 
publicly funded institutes 
has unraveled the code of 
95 percent of the mouse 
genome, which includes 
about 30,000 genes, 
roughly the same amount 
as humans. Surprisingly, 
the two genomes differ 
by about one percent 
only: mice have 300 genes 
that we don‚Äôt have and 
vice versa. By comparing 
the human and mouse 
genomes, scientists will 
find it easier to identify 
natural mutations that 
cause disease. They will 
also be able to create 
deliberate mutations 
to study their effect in 
laboratory mice, commonly 
used to test potential 
drugs. The comparison 
between the mouse and 
human genomes has 
already revealed 1200 
previously unidentified 
human genes.

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003
You recently received the UNESCO Madanjeet Singh 
Prize for Tolerance and Non-Violence. Over many years, 
you have been given countless international awards, 
including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. How helpful 
have these awards been for you?
ÓÇá  It‚Äôs very helpful to the movement because 
 it‚Äôs a sign that people all over the world support us and feel 
for us. So I do not look upon these awards as something 
personal, but as something given to the movement.
What are you expecting from the international 
community and especially from the UN? 
ÓÇá We would like to see the UN standing very firmly by 
the General Assembly resolution1 on Burma and to try to 
implement the terms of the resolution as quickly as possible. 
And we would like the whole international community to 
support the UN and this. 
What has been the impact of international 
sanctions?
ÓÇá When people talk about international sanctions they 
generally are talking about the US sanctions. And I often 
have to remind people that the US sanctions simply prevent 
United States businessmen from making new investments. 
The investments that were made before the sanctions were 
implemented are still in place. From this point of view, we 
cannot say that these sanctions have had a very important 
impact economically. But they have had very important 
political impact, because they demonstrate that the people 
of the United States are concerned about what is going on 
in Burma. And the fact that the United States has imposed 
sanctions also makes other countries sit up and take notice.
Do you think sanctions can push the country 
towards democracy? 
ÓÇá I don‚Äôt think the sanctions alone will push the country 
towards democracy. I think in a complex situation like ours 
we need many, many different lines of effort before we can 
achieve the changes that we want.
What is your interpretation, your vision 
of democracy?  
ÓÇá It is something I ask people of Burma when I go travelling 
all over the country. Especially when I come to rural 
Burma, to villages, I will ask people what they mean by the 
After a 28-year journey 
as a student and 
scholar, Aung San Suu 
Kyi returned home to 
Rangoon to nurse her 
dying mother in 1988.
The then 43-year-old 
daughter of national 
hero General Aung 
San - the assassinated 
negotiator for Burmese 
independence from the 
British - found herself 
caught in the middle 
of an unprecedented 
political struggle for 
democracy in her 
homeland. Millions 
of people had hit 
the streets to put an 
end to the Ne Win 
government‚Äôs 26-year 
dictatorship, and 
thousands of pro-
democracy protestors 
were masacred.
Confronted with an 
army threatening to 
shoot her while she 
campaigned in the 
Irrawaddy Delta, and 
cheered by a crowd of 
half a million people 
listening to her call for 
democratic government 
in Rangoon, Suu Kyi 
was soon recognized as 
a symbol of democracy. 
She was elected 
General Secretary of 
the newly founded 
National League for 
Democracy, which won 
82% of the seats in the 
legislative elections of 
May 1990.  This was an 
historic success that 
the ruling military junta 
neither accepted nor 
forgot. 
The democratic 
cause, coupled 
with her immense 
popularity, earned 
Suu Kyi international 
recognition and the 
1991 Nobel Peace Prize. 
But back home the 
junta placed her under 
a total of eight years of 
house arrest. 
Aung San Suu Kyi 
continues to resist, 
saying ‚Äúthere WILL 
be change because 
ALL the military have 
are guns.‚Äù  Her latest 
19-month period of 
house arrest ended in 
May 2002. Since then 
she has been able to 
travel through different 
provinces.
A victory? A step 
closer to national 
reconciliation? The 
iron butterfly, as local 
people 
call her, is 
cautiously 
optimistic.

1. On November 19, 2002, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution 
strongly urging the Government of Myanmar ‚Äúto restore democracy and 
implement the results of the 1990 election and to ensure that the contacts with 
Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy 
move without delay into substantive and structured dialogue towards 
democratisation and national reconciliation and at an early stage to include 
other political leaders in these talks, including the representatives of the ethnic 
groups [...] to release unconditionnally and immediately all political prisoners.‚Äù

tremendous support of young people and the sense of 
solidarity between different ethnic nationalities of Burma.
How important is the ethnic coalition for you? 
ÓÇá Oh, it is most important; it is the most important thing. 
Because Burma is a Union, it is a country made up of many 
different ethnic nationalities, and unless we can achieve 
true solidarity we shall never be at peace. What we need is 
a system of a federal nature that takes into consideration all 
the aspirations of different nationalities. As I said just now, 
I found there was tremendous solidarity among the ethnic 
nationalities when I visited the states of Shan and Arakan. 
The welcome that I received from the general public there 
was most heart-warming and very, very encouraging. So I 
think we are moving very steadily towards true solidarity. 
What are the next steps? 
ÓÇá The next steps are to achieve dialogue. I think we‚Äôve got to sit 
down and to talk over matters important to this country with 
the SPDC. (The ruling State Peace and Development Council)
What is the current human rights situation in Burma? 
ÓÇá We still do not enjoy the basic human rights as spelled out 
in the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights.
What about the situation of political prisoners? 
ÓÇá They have been number of releases of political prisoners, 
but there are still hundreds of such prisoners behind bars.   
democracy, why do they want democracy. And quite often 
they just say we want to be free. So I define democracy as a 
system that guarantees both freedom and security. Of course 
people have to feel secure, but we don‚Äôt want a false kind 
of security, which allows no freedom at all. So this is what 
I mean by democracy. Of course this means there have to 
be the basic democratic institutions such as an independent 
judiciary, regular free and fair elections,  free press and so 
on. But given these basics I think we will probably find our 
own form of democracy. This has happened all over the 
world. France has its own kind of democracy, and the United 
States has its own kind of democracy, for example. 
 Do you think international support had something 
to do with your release last May? 
ÓÇá As I said, not everything is due to international support. 
But international support does play an important part. 
What are the other factors? 
ÓÇá The fact that people in our country do want change. And 
that it is better for us to be on good terms than to be on 
bad terms. I would like to give the regime the benefit of 
the doubt, and I would like to believe that they genuinely 
want to do what is good for the country. And they see that 
reconciliation is the best thing possible that can be done.
Are you really free? 
ÓÇá I am free. But freedom is relative, in the sense that I am 
free, but people are not always free to come to see me. This 
was made obvious during my last trip to the state of Arakan 
when the general public were prevented from coming to 
meet me, to demonstrate their support for me. 
When I was released, I said that I have been released but 
we have not achieved democracy. So it‚Äôs certainly nothing 
like the end of the road. We are just somewhere at the 
beginning, because we‚Äôve got to move forward. And the 
message I would like to get across to everybody now is that 
it‚Äôs important for us to move forward as quickly as possible 
for the sake of the country.
Have you been able to resume your normal 
political activities as the leader of a lawful party ?  
ÓÇá I am not yet able to operate as a normal leader of a normal 
political party, because none of the political parties in Burma 
are allowed to operate as normal political parties.  This is 
what we‚Äôre trying to achieve, this is one of the factors that is 
important for the process of change. 
The political situation has changed to a certain degree. 
The most obvious change, of course, is that the National 
League of Democracy has been able to expand operations 
to a certain extent. I‚Äôve been able to go around the country. 
But I think the most promising thing I‚Äôve discovered, 
not necessarily a change brought from my release, is the

One of our demands is that they be released unconditionally 
as soon as possible. 
How are negotiations for their release progressing? 
ÓÇá We have not had any negotiations. 
What are the main needs of Burma in terms 
of education and culture? 
ÓÇá In terms of education we need a lot of things. I‚Äôm 
especially concerned about tertiary education because too 
many young people are leaving school uneducated. The 
whole system needs to be revised. With regard to culture, we 
are made up of many ethnic nationalities, as we discussed 
earlier, and it‚Äôs very important that we try to preserve the 
different cultural strands in this country. Democracy will 
give everybody a chance to make their contribution to the 
development of educational and cultural matters. So what 
democracy does is to provide people with an opportunity 
to freely use their talents for the sake of the country. I 
think there should be flowering of cultural and educational 
institutes, organizations, activities.
What do you answer to the people who say that 
the human rights are a western concept, not relevant 
in Asia? 
ÓÇá My answer is to ask: are Asians not human beings?

### Borderless education
Borderless Education
New technology, spiralling demand and economic 
liberalization are profoundly changing education. 
‚ÄúMcDonaldizing‚Äù it say the critics. Making it accessible 
to vast new numbers of students, say others 
Is education a commercial service that can 
  be traded like any other?  Yes, says the 
 World Trade Organization, which, through 
its General Agreement on Trade and Services 
(GATS), recognized education as a tradeable 
commodity in 1995. No, say angry academics and 
student groups around the world, who, fearing 
the ‚ÄúMcDonaldization‚Äù of education, are radically 
opposed to the idea.
Fuelling this passionate debate has been the 
explosive growth witnessed in the international 
trade of education services over the last decade. 
Higher education and specialized training, 
especially have become big profit-spinners for 
private or corporate providers, and a much 
needed source of income for cash-strapped 
public universities and institutions suffering 
from declining state-budgets and ever-increasing 
numbers of students. 
According to the OECD, the higher education 
market in its member countries is conservatively 
worth some $30 billion annually. In 1999 there 
were 1.47 million foreign students studying in 
tertiary education in OECD countries, an increase 
of more than 100,000 over 1998. Education 
accounts for 3.5 percent of service exports in 
the United States, earning more than US$10 
billion annually, and two of the biggest firms 
selling higher education there, Apollo and Sylvan 
Learning, are now quoted on the stock-exchange. 
In Australia, which with the United Kingdom 
dominates the world market, education has 
become the third largest service export:  since 
1980 the number of foreign students enrolled at 
Australian institutions has multiplied more than 
13-fold.
The range of providers has also dramatically 
evolved, from traditional universities and 
institutes of higher learning to virtual 
British students

organizations specialized in e-learning, and from 
private companies and international corporations 
to partnerships between private and public 
groups, not-for-profit organizations and media 
groups. News Corporation, for example, through 
its subsidiary Worldwide Learning Ltd., has 
teamed up with a consortium of 15 Scottish 
Universities and 20 commercial companies to 
market Scottish higher education programmes 
globally, particularly in North America, the Middle 
East, Malaysia and China. The African Virtual

World Bank project, is now an independent non-

Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 1997, more 
than 24,000 students have completed courses in 
techology, engineering, business and sciences 
and more than 3,500 professionals have attended 
executive and management seminars. 
160 MILLION BY 2025
The globalizing economy and job market, with its 
need for increasingly skilled workers, and the rise 
of information and communication technologies 
that have made ‚Äúborderless education‚Äù a reality, 
are driving private sector growth, which is set to 
continue at breakneck pace. According to Merrill 
Lynch, a US-based investment bank, today‚Äôs 80 
million students will have doubled by 2025.
Developing countries or countries in transition, 
are keen supporters of these developments. The 
latest EFA Global Monitoring Report, clearly 
showed that the costs of achieving education 
for all by the deadline of 2015 (set at the World 
Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, 2000) had 
been seriously underestimated and that national 
budgets and international aid would have to 
be dramatically increased. However, many 
governments argue they simply don‚Äôt have the 
resources, and see foreign or private services 
UNESCO‚Äôs regional 
conventions regulating 
mutual recognition of higher 
education studies and degrees 
were adopted during the 
1970s and the early 1980s.  
They cover Latin America 
and the Caribbean, the 
Arab States, Europe, Africa, 
Asia and the Pacific, and 
Arab and European States 
bordering the Mediterranean. 
The conventions are legally 
binding, similar to the 
GATS in that they promote 
international cooperation 
in higher education and the 
reduction of obstacles to 
the mobility of teachers and 
students through mutual 
recognition of degrees and 
qualifications between the 
countries that have ratified 
them. The fundamental 
difference with the GATS 
lies in the fact that this latter 
promotes higher education 
trade liberalization for 
purposes of profit. 
Although the conventions 
need updating the include new 
developments in education, 
especially cross-border supply 
(the sale of courses on the 
internet or in the form of 
CD-Roms and DVDs)  and 
commercial presence (opening 
private training schools run 
by foreign firms), they serve 
as a complement to the GATS 
by setting the standards and 
guaranteeing quality control.

as a means of filling the gap, and accelerating 
the development of national university systems. 
In China, for example, 36 percent of higher 
education students are enrolled in private 
institutions. In Poland, which had almost no 
private institutions in 1989, there are now more 
than 180, providing courses for third of the 
country‚Äôs student body. According to a series 
of case studies prepared by UNESCO, such new 
providers account for 55 percent of all ‚Äúnew‚Äù and 
‚Äúvery new‚Äù universities in Jordan, Sudan, Tunisia 
and Yemen, while in Kazakhstan 70 percent of all 
universities are private. 
HORSE-TRADING
While few would criticize the vastly increased 
access to education that such developments seem 
to offer, many consider that ‚Äúhorse-trading‚Äù 
education will have disastrous consequences. 
They want it withdrawn from the list of 12 
services covered by the GATS. Iberian and Latin 
American academics, who signed the Porto Alegre 
Declaration of 2002, maintain that it will lead 
to ‚Äúderegulation of the education sector with 
the removal of legal, political and fiscal quality 
controls‚Äù, and fear ‚Äúdrastic public financial 
support cutbacks.‚Äù  The British Association of 
University Teachers adds that it will also threaten 
job security, professional autonomy and status, 
academic quality, and will have a negative impact 
on academic freedom, intellectual property rights 
and access to education. The National Union of  
Students in Europe believes that ‚Äúthe concept 
of the student as a consumer and education as 
a product fails to acknowledge the importance 
of education as a social tool and runs counter to 
the creation of a knowledge-based society, with 
democratic, tolerant and active citizens.‚Äù Their 
Canadian counterparts argue that ‚Äúit is time to 
protect the essential role of this public service, 
not to subordinate education to market forces, 
undermine its accessibility, and exacerbate social 
inequalities.‚Äù
Other GATS observers dismiss these claims 
as unfounded. Pierre Sauv√© of the OECD 
describes the agreement as ‚Äúarguably the most 
development-friendly of all Uruguay-Round pacts‚Äù 
and believes that ‚Äúit is not likely to be a driving 
force or even a major consideration behind 
changes‚Äù already occurring in the education 
sector. ‚ÄúGovernments,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúcan use the 
GATS selectively to encourage investment in 
sectors of their choice, subject to the conditions 
they wish to impose or retain [‚Ä¶] the agreement 
also permits governments to maintain foreign 
ownership restrictions in sectors where they 
have made commitments (and) promotes a

FOR
Pierre Sauv√©, who works in OECD‚Äôs Trade Directorate, says increased trade in higher education can help everyone, starting 
with developing countries that do not have the resources to meet all their students‚Äô needs.
What are the benefits of commercializing higher education? 
Technological advance allows us to spread knowledge further, so it makes sense to think about how we can maximize the 
possible benefits especially since we‚Äôve long known that investment in human capital goes hand in hand with economic 
development. So we should be glad to see increased trade in higher education. However, for the past few years, it seems 
to have become almost impossible to utter the word ‚Äútrade‚Äù without setting off loud protests. We should remember that 
trade enriches nations. The mobility of students, teachers and ideas can be important in bringing cultures closer together. 
The problem is that the North seems to have much more to gain than the South‚Ä¶
But would the countries of the South be better off if we didn‚Äôt allow their young people to study at the best Western 
universities? Some developing countries just don‚Äôt have enough money to provide the training their citizens need. A 
number of African countries have agreed to privatize education within the framework of WTO because they want to see 
foreign suppliers set up operations in their countries to add to the amount of education provided by local private or 
government suppliers.
But isn‚Äôt there a risk of making education too uniform?
Policies exist to avoid this. For example, an Indonesian law that requires education to be given in this or that language can 
be extended to foreign suppliers of education. So it‚Äôs mostly a matter of regulation and local political choice. Nobody‚Äôs 
forcing WTO member states to make any commitment in the field of education and if they do, they‚Äôre free to use local 
suppliers.
AGAINST
Nico Hirtt, a Belgian teacher and essayist, attacks privatization of universities as ensuring dominance of the Western educational 
model and widening social inequality. 
How has higher education changed in the past 20 years? 
Economic interests are now exerting great pressure on public services to adapt to their requirements. Schools are being 
asked to be more flexible so as to respond faster to the demands of the labour market. At the same time, government 
funding, on which universities mostly depend, has fallen. 
What part does the World Trade Organization play in all this? 
The commercialization of education is going to happen however the negotiations turn out. Decisions at an international 
level will simply accompany the trend. Market forces will lead the way. Preparatory meetings before the 1999 Seattle 
Summit showed how few obstacles there are to this liberalization. The only real brake to it is the issue of international 
recognition of diplomas. 
What could be the medium-term results of this liberalization?
The danger is a ‚ÄúMcDonaldization‚Äù of higher education, with the spread of a single formula and copy of the Western 
model. Faced with increased competition, universities are tempted to invest in subjects that are going to be most 
profitable for them, to the detriment of less profitable ones such as human sciences. They will also be tempted to move 
more and more towards doing research that pleases their funding sources. In the future, parents will have to spend a 
greater part of their income on their children‚Äôs education and that will only increase social inequality.
So what‚Äôs the answer? 
We can‚Äôt resist this trend if we just stick to education because all the most human aspects of our societies are being 
commercialized. It‚Äôs a worldwide battle we have to wage against the excesses of economic modernization.

greater predictability (but not irreversibility) of 
commitments, a potentially important element in 
attracting investment in developing countries.‚Äù
UNESCO‚Äôs main concern is to ensure that global 
higher education standards do not fall victim 
to the rigours of the market.  ‚ÄúQuality is the 
issue,‚Äù says Stamenka Uvalic-Trumbic, the head 
of UNESCO‚Äôs Section for Access, Mobility and 
Quality Assurance. ‚ÄúThe Organization has long 
encouraged the internationalization of education 
and the involvement of a range of partners ‚Äì both 
public and private. But we must also protect 
students from inadequate learning resources, 
low-quality provisions, degree mills and bogus 
institutions.
‚ÄúThe fast developments of the knowledge 
society demonstrate that globalization, 
particularly the globalization of higher education, 
is irreversible and cannot be stopped. It can, 
however be tamed through regulation and policy 
coordination.‚Äù
To this end, UNESCO has set up a Global Forum 
on International Quality Assurance, Accreditation 
and the Recognition of Qualifications in Higher 
Education. It‚Äôs task is to establish an international 
quality assurance framework and a code of good 
practice for providers of higher education. Its first 
meeting last October set the agenda. A second 
meeting to be held in Oslo (Norway, May 26-27) 
will further develop the Forum‚Äôs plan of action. 
The Forum will also look at ways of updating the 
six existing regional conventions dealing with 
recognition of qualifications and ratified by 130 
UNESCO Member States, and which could serve 
as a counterweight to the GATS (see box p.13). 
‚ÄúThe Forum serves as a complement to GATS, 
not a rival,‚Äù explains Ms Uvalic-Trumbic, ‚Äúand 
provides a place where people and institutions 
involved with higher education can debate the 
issues from a wide range of perspectives ‚Äì not 
just that of the market place ‚Äì and decide what to 
do about them.‚Äù

Quality, Accreditation and Qualifications
As higher education opens up to world markets and the World 
Trade Organization turns its attention towards universities, 
quality, accreditation and qualifications are becoming issues of 
major concern to universities leaders, governments, students 
and parents. What are the possibilities of dealing with these 
burning issues in a concerted way? What 
are national and regional authorities doing 
to tackle what promises to be the most 
important issue since the development of

An 18 year-old Swede from 
Lapland, fights to save her culture 
and her language, one of 
the most threatened in Europe
ensjon, a village lying under the snow 
in the region of Kiruna, northern 
Sweden: a television crew from Discovery Channel 
is filming a short documentary about the Saami 
(see box p. 20). Outside, the temperature is ‚Äì33¬∞C, 
freezing both people and movie cameras. Only 
Anna, 18 years old, is in her element.  Pouring all 
her teenage energy into defending her ‚Äúdifference,‚Äù 
this young Swedish woman is the star of the hour.
‚ÄúThe first thing I‚Äôll pass on to my children? 
The Saami language.‚Äù Anna doesn‚Äôt bat an 
eyelid before answering. On the surface, she is a 
teenager like any other: her life revolves around 
snowboarding, her boyfriend and the American 
pop-rock group Foo Fighters. But deep down, she 
feels that she has something else, that many of 
her school friends don‚Äôt. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a feeling that grows with time. The more 
the years go by, the more I feel like speaking 
Saami and following my uncle and his reindeer 
into the mountains. Living close to nature gives 
you incredible strength.‚Äù For Anna, being Saami is 
a bonus, a passport for a life that breaks with the 
ordinary. ‚ÄúI have my Swedish life, like everyone 
else, and an extra life as well.‚Äù
Anna lives with her parents in G√§llivare, a 
mining town located north of the Arctic circle. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky, because my parents always told 
me where I came from and sent me to a Saami 
school.‚Äù Along with Swedish and English, she 
learnt to read and write in her mother tongue, 
which her mother and grandmother only know 
how to speak. She also discovered how to yoik, 
the art of singing traditional melodies with 
modulations evoking the wind, which once 
carried performers into a trance. For several years 
now, she has sung in public at Saami festivals.
PROUD OF HER HERITAGE
Often, on weekends, Anna travels 80 kilometres 
to visit her maternal grandmother Ellen Maria, 
who lives in Rensjon. With this feisty 77-year 
old, Anna learns how to make traditional objects 
in reindeer skin or multicoloured threads. She 
loves listening to her grandmother‚Äôs stories about 
the past, recounted without nostalgia but with 
a definite sense of pride: a nomadic childhood 
governed by the rhythm of reindeer herding, 
the death of her own mother when she was 
barely three, her role as the family head that she 
assumed early on to support her father, brother 
and little sister, the harsh winter of 1935-36 when 
all the reindeer starved to death, the trading of 
‚Äúmilk against meat‚Äù with Finns settled in the 
region, and finally, the move to a more sedentary 
lifestyle, access to modernity and basic comforts. 
‚ÄúSaami life has changed so much,‚Äù says Anna, 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this memory to die.‚Äù 
Not that the two women would ever turn the 
clock back. Like her friends, Anna is not attracted 
to traditional occupations such as reindeer 
breeding, which employs less than 15 percent of

the Saami in Sweden: too tough and not lucrative 
enough, she says. Unless they own more than 
400 animals, reindeer herders have a below 
average living standard and must round off their 
months by working in the mining industry or in 
the tourism business.
But Anna is sure of one thing. She will continue 
living in S√°pmi (previously known as Lapland) 
and defend her language and the rights of her 
small minority. Today, Sweden counts some 
15,000 to 20,000 Saami, accounting for less than 
0.25 per cent of the country‚Äôs population. Even in 
their own region, where temperatures can drop to 
‚Äì50¬∞C, they only represent between five to ten per 
cent of inhabitants. The others are mostly miners 
from the southern part of the country lured by 
opportunities in important iron ore deposits. 
Traditionally a people of hunters and fishermen, 
the Saami became nomadic herdsman towards 
the end of the Middle Ages. They lived through 
dark hours from the 16th to the mid-20th century: 
their lifestyle and customs came under attack and 
their traditional territory split between several 
States (see box below). Colonization, taxes, 
Christian missionaries and the persecution of 
traditional Shamans, forced labour in the mines, 
the prohibition to use their language and express 
Some 60,000 to 
100,000 Saami 
(also written S√°mi), 
an indigenous people 
formerly known as Lapps, 
live dispersed across 
four countries: Finland, 
Norway, Sweden and 
Russia. Their territory 
came under the Swedish 
crown in the early 16th 
century before being 
divided between Sweden, 
Russia and Denmark a 
century later. In 1996, part 
of Sweden‚Äôs Laponian 
area, where a nomadic 
lifestyle marked by 
the seasonal rhythm 
of reindeer herding 
prevails, was inscribed on 
UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage 
List.
‚ÄúWe are the only 
wild white people in 
the world,‚Äù jokes an 
ironic Lars Anders Baer, 
president of Sweden‚Äôs 
Saami Parliament, 
underlining that ‚Äúthe 
majority, 40,000 to 70,000 
people, live on Norwegian 
territory.‚Äù It is estimated 
that 15,000 to 20,000 
Saami live in Sweden, 
around 5,000 in Finland 
and 2,000 in the Kola 
Peninsula (Russia).
The Saami language 
is generally classified in 
the Finno-Ugrian family, 
bearing similarities to 
the languages of the 
Baltic Sea like Finnish 
and Estonian. But there 
are in fact several Saami 
tongues, often bearing no 
resemblance with each 
other. Spelling can also 
vary from one language to 
the other.
The UNESCO Atlas 
of Languages in 
Danger lists 11 Saami 
languages, of which 
one is ‚Äúextinct‚Äù (Kemi 
Saami), four are ‚Äúnearly 
extinct‚Äù (Pite Saami, Ume 
Saami, Ter Saami and 
Akkala Saami), five are 
‚Äúseriously endangered‚Äù 
(Inari Saami, Skolt Saami, 
Kildin Saami, Lule Saami 
and South Saami). Only 
one is listed in the simply 
‚Äúendangered‚Äù category: 
North Saami, spoken by 
80 to 90 percent of the 
Saami who still speak their 
language ‚Äì about 30,000 
people ‚Äì living in the four 
countries concerned.
Lars Anders Baer 
asserts that an effort 
‚Äúto harmonize linguistic 
policies adopted in the 
four concerned countries‚Äù 
is necessary to save the 
Saami language. But in 
doing so, there is a risk 
of killing variants that are 
currently spoken by no 
more than a few hundred, 
or even a few dozen 
people.

their culture, racism and economic decline pushed 
the majority to assimilate into the dominant and 
prosperous Swedish society. 
According to estimates, more than half the 
Saami in Sweden cannot speak their own 
language and 90 percent can‚Äôt write it. Many 
young people know nothing about their past or 
are ashamed of it, says Anna. ‚ÄúSome don‚Äôt even

in the Sametinget (Sweden‚Äôs Saami parliament),‚Äù 
she asserts, regretting that two thirds of the Saami 
don‚Äôt take this opportunity. This parliament, 
which has an advisory capacity to the government 
according to its president Lars Anders Baer, 
was set up in Kiruna in 1993, several years after 
those in Norway and Finland. It is the result 
of the birth, after World War Two, of a Saami 
movement, which gained strength in the 1970s, 
echoing the affirmation of other indigenous 
peoples around the world.
In recent years, Mr Baer admits, Sweden‚Äôs 
Saami people have scored points on the cultural 
front, even if he feels the government does not 
invest enough money in promoting the language. 
Today, Saami children have the right to be 
educated in their mother tongue, although few 
follow this route. The most motivated attend the 
six bilingual schools in S√°pmi‚Äôs cities. According 
to the European research network Mercator, the 
number of students in these schools rose from 115 
in 1994/95 to 170 in 2000/01. Some 180 children 
spread across other schools in the country benefit 
from an ‚Äúintegrated Saami education‚Äù as part of 
UNESCO and languages
According to many 
linguists, the world loses ten 
languages every year. More 
than half the 6,000 languages 
spoken in the world are, to 
various degrees, threatened by 
extinction. Worse, the erosion 
of linguistic diversity is gaining 
speed, under the impact of 
migration, restrictive linguistic 
policies and the pressure of 
dominant languages: English 
is an obvious culprit, but 
Russian, French, Arabic and 
Chinese also deserve mention. 
A community‚Äôs language is 
considered in danger when at 
least 30 percent of its children 
have ceased to learn it.
When a language dies, a 
whole world vision, thought 
patterns and original concepts 
also disappear. In its quest 
to promote cultural diversity, 
UNESCO has taken up the 
cause of dying languages. The 
Organization first undertook 
the task of quantifying and 
documenting the phenomenon 
by producing, in co-operation 
with renowned academics, 
an Atlas of the World‚Äôs 
Languages in Danger of 
Disappearing. A study is 
underway to evaluate the 
number of speakers of each of 
the 3,000 threatened languages.
Such a publication, 
widely publicized by the 
media, contributes to public 
awareness. UNESCO also 
works with the scientific 
community to study certain 
languages. It has just launched 
an initiative in Georgia to 
record, transcribe and codify 
three endangered languages 
(Abkhaz, Bats and Laz)  in order 
to produce online grammars 
and vocabulary data bases. 
UNESCO also encourages 
multilingualism in schools. 
The Organization believes that 
all students should ‚Äúbegin 
their formal education in their 
mother tongue.‚Äù With its 
Initiative B@bel programme, 
UNESCO also supports 
multilingualism in cyberspace, 
where English counts for more 
than half of contents and where 
very few minority languages 
have visibility.
UNESCO‚Äôs action in favour 
of linguistic diversity 
recently led to an agreement 
with Discovery Channel, 
supported by the UN Works 
programme. This partnership 
aims to sensitize public 
opinion and the media to 
dying languages. It led to 
the production of spots on 
endangered languages: 
nine two- to five-minute 
documentaries were aired on 
International Mother Language 
Day, celebrated last February 
21. The television channel is 
expected to produce up to fifty 
other mini-documentaries on 
the topic.

the general curriculum. Other children take Saami 
as an option. If they wish, they can continue in 
high school and university.
LAND RIGHTS
The environment is slowly changing. National 
school curricula are starting to speak about the 
history of minorities in the country. Some media 
are introducing Saami programmes, albeit in small 
doses. On the legislative front, Stockholm ratified 
the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages in February 2000. At the same time, a 
new law was adopted on the right to use Saami 
before administrative authorities and in court, 
a decisive step in the recognition of the Saami 
minority.
The looming question of land rights remains. 
Unlike Norway, Sweden has not ratified the 
International Labour Organisation‚Äôs Convention 
169 concerning indigenous and tribal peoples. 
According to this text, these people must have 
the ‚Äúrights of ownership and possession‚Äù of their 
traditional lands and be able to ‚Äúparticipate in 
the benefits‚Äù of activities stemming from the 
exploitation of natural resources. For Anna‚Äôs 
father, Anders, survival depends on this: without 
economic autonomy that would notably enable 
his people to develop and modernize reindeer 
husbandry, Saami culture is condemned to 
disappear. ‚ÄúIf you no longer need 400 words 
to describe the quality of snow or hundreds of 
others to designate different parts of the reindeer, 
you no longer need the language,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf our 
traditions die, our language will die.‚Äù
Meanwhile, his daughter continues to sing. And 
the future will tell whether her yoik is a swan‚Äôs 
song to Saami culture or an ode to the Sun god of 
a reborn people.

UNESCO‚Äôs 30-year-old Man 
and Biosphere 
(MAB) programme has always put both people 
and nature at the centre of its concerns. The 
original reserves aimed to reconcile conservation 
with the presence of people through a system of 
zoning, where a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù zone and a ‚Äútransition‚Äù 
area surrounded a ‚Äúcore‚Äù area with high 
conservation potential, shielding it from the 
destructive influence of a modernizing world. 
But, while the need for conservation is arguably 
greater today than it was when the first biosphere 
reserves were designated in 1976, the people 
who live in or near the reserves want to prosper 
economically. The challenge, then, is to square 
these potentially conflicting goals.
Over the past decade or so, the MAB 
programme has been developing a range of 
initiatives to do just this. One approach is to use 
an area‚Äôs cultural heritage as a money-earner, 
through ecotourism ventures. Some 70 biosphere 
reserves are also UNESCO World Heritage sites. 
In the past, local people have often been chased 
out of cultural sites in an effort to ‚Äòpreserve‚Äô them. 
And, of course, tourism can be either supportive 
of or damaging to the conservation goals of 
a biosphere reserve, depending on how it is 
managed. ‚ÄúUNESCO is not introducing tourism,‚Äù 
says Francis Childe, senior programme specialist 
in the Division of Cultural Heritage, which works 
closely with the MAB programme. ‚ÄúBut tourism is 
coming. So the question is how to make sure that 
local communities are involved and in control.‚Äù
One UNESCO-backed ecotourism project in 
mountainous regions of Central Asia and the 
Himalayas (see page 23) is working with local 
NGOs to develop home-stay accommodation, 
high-quality handcrafts, traditional games and 
festivals and to involve local communities in 
protecting cultural heritage sites. And managers 
of the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve in South 
Africa (see page 25) are using its resources to ease 
the legacy of apartheid and to narrow the divide 
between wealthy (white) game lodge owners or

of 1600m. It is the largest alpine lake in Asia and 
the second largest anywhere. Last year it became 
the centre of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs second UNESCO 
biosphere reserve. Looking south, we could see 
the snow-covered Tien Shan mountains forming a 
spectacular wall, with peaks rising more than 7000 
m. Beyond them is China. And, behind us to the 
north, the more modest Kungey Alatau mountains 
separated us from Kazakhstan - and Siberia.

A long cloud stretched out like a finger just above

because the water never freezes in winter. But 
as soon as we got back on land, the late autumn 
sun was surprisingly warm again. Even Bolot had

The mountains seemed to close in with the 
evening sky as we turned our backs 
on Cholpon-Ata and its field of prehistoric rock 
drawings. Disco music blared out of the cassette 
player in Bolot‚Äôs brown Mercedes taxi as he rattled 
us between the Russian trucks on the old Chu 
Valley Silk Road back to Bishkek. ‚ÄúZanzibar‚Äù 
and what sounded like ‚ÄúOne-way chicken to 
the moon‚Äù had been thumping out for hours on 
end. Bolot only had one cassette and he insisted 
on listening to it. We didn‚Äôt want to spoil his 
concentration.
When we‚Äôd arrived in Cholpon-Ata, on the 
north shore of Lake Issyk Kul, five hours earlier, 
Bolot was in a bad mood. We never found 
out why. He seemed just to want to dump us 
anywhere and have lunch. So, we persuaded 
him to drop us off at a little marina, past the 
President‚Äôs summer dacha, and negotiated a one-
hour boat trip. The lake, which has something of 
Loch Ness about it, is over 180 kilometres long, 
60 km wide and 700 metres deep, at an altitude

Another recent initiative uses the sustainable 
practises of biosphere reserves as a guarantee of 
quality and fairness in local produce, whether 
handicrafts or food, through a system of quality 
labelling (see New Courier, October 2002, p.34).
Meanwhile, supporting the traditional 
knowledge and practices of local people can 
contribute to conservation, while encouraging 
cultural diversity. For example, indigenous 
peoples from Ghana and India to South America, 
traditionally designate special natural areas as 
sacred, restricting what can be done there. After 
countless generations, these areas have become 
havens of genetically ancient biodiversity, in 
landscapes that have been changed radically 
by human intervention. On a different tack, 
traditional practices that, to western minds, seem 
to be destructive can, in fact, be the opposite. In 
Australia‚Äôs Uluru-Kata Tjuta Biosphere Reserve, 
the Aboriginal custom of patchwork burning of 
the landscape is now part of the management 
plan. Controlled burning, it turns out, can be an 
excellent way to conserve biodiversity in arid 
areas.

perked up and was happy to follow our uncertain 
directions down a dirt track until, after a few 
false starts and mimed questions to locals, we 
found what we were looking for. Behind a purely 
symbolic 20m length of metal fence, a vast field 
opened up into the distant foothills, strewn with 
boulders. But these were no ordinary rocks. On 
their south faces, hundreds were inscribed with 
breath-taking bronze-age drawings of hunters, 
Siberian ibex, snow-leopards, horses and other 
animals.
There is no tourist infrastructure here, so 
we were free to roam, as if we were the first to 
discover the site. In a couple of hours, we only 
found a few dozen of the 5000 or so petroglyphs. 
The only other people we saw were a shepherdess 
and a gaggle of 12-year-olds. And they‚Äôd come 
to look at us, not the rocks. With Bolot waiting 
impatiently in the car, we had to hurry. Which 
is not what one wants to do in a treasure-hunt 
among drawings that are over 2500 years old. 
They were, we found out later, made by pre-
Kyrgyz nomadic (Scythian) people. With a 
shamanic spiritual tradition, the hunters would 
probably have wanted to evoke the spirits of the 
animals and make peace with them.
ECOTURISM PROJECTS
The Soviet legacy in Kyrgyzstan was sometimes 
a heavy one, with radioactive waste from local 
uranium mines dumped in the mountains. But the 
more remote countryside is stunningly beautiful 
and unknown to tourists. While ecotourism 
ventures are sprouting up, sometimes with 
UNESCO involvement, less respectful operators 
eyeing easy dollars could sound the death knell 
for what is still mostly unspoiled country. Today, 
sustainable tourism is high on the list of activities 
that the managers of the biosphere reserve want 
to encourage. Signposting the petroglyphs is 
already underway. And the biosphere reserve 
remains a sparsely populated, mountainous area, 
with an intact ecology, including snow leopards, 
brown bears, Marco Polo sheep and Siberian ibex, 
as well as rare birds and plants, just like on those 
rock drawings.

Issyk Kul
UNESCO officially endorsed the 
Issyk Kul Biosphere Reserve in 
2001. At its heart is Lake Issyk 
Kul, the world‚Äôs second largest 
high-altitude lake and a Ramsar 
Wetland site. With support 
from the German Federal 
Government and UNESCO, the 
biosphere reserve now publishes 
an information newsletter 
(‚ÄúAk Kuu‚Äù) and is developing a 
range of ecotourism initiatives. 
UNESCO is working with an 
NGO to train local people as 
guides, and use traditional 
‚Äúyurt‚Äù felt houses for home-stay 
accommodation. 
A new project focussing on 
Cholpon-Ata is cataloguing 
the petroglyphs, producing 
promotional materials in 
Kyrgyz, Russian and English and 
protecting the site against theft, 
damage (e.g. grafitti), etc. Local 
people have now been trained as 
guides, and signage has recently 
been installed.

trace of aggression or threat. And the residual 
mistrust that remains is starting to fade as the two 
communities work to improve livelihoods, thanks 
in large part to the energy and vision of a few 
individuals. Of diverse origins and outlooks, they 
represent the essential components required for a 
successful biosphere reserve: conservation, socio-
economic development and cultural heritage.
OUT OF AFRICA
‚ÄúJust 12 or 15 years ago, people in Bakenberg 
would flee when I arrived wearing a ranger 
uniform,‚Äù recalls Clive Walker, one of South 
Africa‚Äôs most famous conservationists, who 
spearheaded the biosphere reserve‚Äôs creation. 
Instead of avoiding the district, Walker returned, 
which isn‚Äôt altogether surprising. He is not your 
average white landowner but a man with a rhino 
parked in his garden, an orphan he raised with 
his wife at their home in Lapalala Wilderness, 
a private game reserve unlike the others in 
Waterberg. 
Instead of stepping ‚ÄòOut of Africa‚Äô, visitors dive 
in at Lapalala, where environmental preservation 
and education are the main attractions. For 
years, Walker has been working with landowners 
to reintroduce rhino species into the area, 
while directing a nature school for mostly poor 
pupils. But at Bakenberg, Walker realized that 
conservation had to go beyond the pristine areas 
of private lands. Rivers were running dry because 
of soil erosion through overgrazing. It was just 
a matter of time before these problems spilled 
across the entire watershed. 
Thanks to Walker, conservation has become 
a cornerstone at Waterberg. Now the biosphere 
reserve‚Äôs new chairman, Rupert Baber, is adding 
his own expertise in economic development. 
After completing a doctoral dissertation on South 
Africa‚Äôs poverty at Oxford, Baber returned to the 
farm his family has worked in Waterberg, since 
1886. This is a place where children are born and 
grandparents retire through an old-fashioned, 
paternalistic system providing healthcare, 
education and a decent salary for more than 100 
families. While maintaining the security, Baber 
and his employees are modernizing the farm, 
switching to high-value organic crops while 
developing micro-credit schemes and cooperatives 
to increase the income and independence of the 
staff. They are also shaping a role model for the 
biosphere reserve. 
‚ÄúOur challenge is to bring benefits not just to 
a select few but to everyone,‚Äù says Baber. 
‚ÄúWe must set up an incentive structure to not 
only reward environmental conservation but 
job creation. People will have to earn the 
biosphere reserve label.‚Äù Baber is setting up a 
system in which landowners would preserve the 
environment while helping to develop Bakenberg, 
whose residents are looking for opportunities, 
not handouts.

### New tracks where the rhinos tread

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003
Wide smiles and 
lunch for school 
children and foreign 
visitors alike at 
Bakenberg festival
in the area. Various organizations will participate 
in this pilot project along with individuals like 
Elias Mangwani, a guide at Lapalala. 
Tread softly with Mangwani in Lapalala‚Äôs 
rhino territory, marveling at the animal tracks 
in the sandy soil but mindful of his warning 
to climb the nearest tree should one of these 
unpredictable beasts approach. Hiking to see 
ancient San rock art, he points to the berries his 
grandmother, a traditional healer, would boil 
to kill the hunger of a three-day trek. A small 
cut in the trunk of a latex tree and he offers 
‚Äúchewing gum‚Äù with the bittersweet taste of his 
childhood. Every Christmas, he would indulge 
in the ‚Äúreal thing‚Äù, a present from his parents 
who returned from the mines for a visit. Like so 
many Waterberg children, Mangwani‚Äôs family was 
forced to leave a farm. But under the watchful 
eye of his grandmother, he learned the ways of 
his land and ancestors, knowledge with which 
he forged his career. Now instead of just leading 
tourists, boasting of their ability to identify zebra 
dung, Mangwani will guide Waterberg‚Äôs youth, 
determined to regain their heritage after more 
than a century of dispossession. 
Amy Otchet 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to create another project, but 
a business,‚Äù says Lesiba Masebe, the grandson 
of a legendary chief, who is a now a respected 
teacher in Bakenberg. Walking through the dirt 
lanes of his village, he proudly points to the 
new hall for local craft production built by the 
biosphere reserve committee before outlining 
plans to set up cultural visits, including bush 
walks with local guides, consultations with 
traditional healers as well as banquets and dance 
performances organized by local troupes. With 
pride, Masebe dreams of creating a ‚Äòtraditional 
African village‚Äô not just to amuse foreigners but to 
teach children about their cultural heritage. As the 
local mayor, Godfrey Molekwa, half-jokes, ‚Äúsex is 
the only cultural activity for youth.‚Äù Many are just 
awaiting the day they will leave to work in distant 
towns.
DISPOSSESSION
To help break this cycle, the national government 
and the biosphere reserve committee are starting 
a new eco-tourism school, under the guidance of 
Clive Walker at Lapalala. The aim is to train local 
staff to work as guides, administrators, mechanics 
and managers while developing investment plans

### Memory of the world, the key to diversity

Memory of the World, 
the Key to Diversity
UNESCO established the Memory 
of the World (MOW) programme ten 
years ago to preserve and promote 
documentary heritage, much of 
it endangered. Yet this heritage is as 
important for humanity‚Äôs cultural 
diversity as the sites and monuments 
on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage List. This 
is why the programme launched the 
World Register of documentary heritage 
of universal value
The register includes the oldest 
surviving book produced with 
moveable type, the second of a 
two-volume set of a Korean ‚ÄúAnthology of Great 
Buddhist Priests‚Äô Zen Teachings‚Äù. The Baegun 
hwasang chorok buljo jikji simche yojeol was 
printed in July 1377 in a temple in Cheongju. 
Also known as Jikji (from a phrase about the 
attainment of enlightenment by direct appeal 
to the mind), it was compiled by Priest Baegun 
when he was 75, and reflects the teachings 
of his instructor, Zen Buddhist master Seogok 
Cheonggong.
The book is one of 68 documentary heritage 
properties from 33 countries inscribed on 
the World Register. Other entries include: the 
Gutenberg Bible (Germany), the first book to 
be printed in Europe and the earliest Bible ever 
printed; the Codex Techaloyan de Cuajimalpaz 
(Mexico) whose pictorial material and Nahuatl 
text describe how indigenous communities 
were established in various places in the Valley 
of Mexico City; the Dainu Skapis Cabinet of 
Folksongs (Latria); and the Archives of the 
Warsaw Ghetto. The Register gives us an idea of 
the enormous variety of documentary heritage 
around the world worth preserving because of its 
enduring importance to scholars and because it 
testifies to cultural achievements that have had a 
far-reaching influence.
MORE THAN A PAPER HISTORY
‚ÄúOur purpose is not conservation for its own 
sake, but conservation in order to make this 
heritage more accessible,‚Äù argues the head of 
the MOW programme Abdelaziz Abid. Giving 
publicity to this heritage helps to attract resources 
for preservation. Digitalization through scanning, 
posting the collections on the Web and producing 
CD-Roms makes these documents accessible to a 
huge number of people without subjecting them 
to physical stress. Oblivion, on the other hand, 
leads to neglect, says Abid.
In 2001 the futuristic masterpiece Metropolis, 
by German film director Fritz Lang, became the 
first feature film on the Register. The inscription 
prompted numerous screenings and helped give 
a new lease of life to the work, according to 
Abid. He also says that publicity events around 
the inscription helped raise awareness of the 
importance of film preservation in general.
Also on the Register are the 4,000 or so 
recordings of the Vienna Phonogammarchiv, the 
first sound archive ever created (1899), featuring 
ethno-linguistic and ethno-musical material 
collected by anthropologists all over the world. 
This material bears testimony to many cultures 
which have since disappeared or been deeply 
changed by Western influences.
The director of Phonogrammarchiv, Dietrich 
Sch√ºller, who is also the chairman of the 
International Advisory Committee of MOW, 
explains that no single institution anywhere can 
claim to preserve enough material in any one 
field. The MOW programme, he explains, aims to 
convince tax-payers and politicians around the 
world that more effort, and a better distribution 
of labour is needed to preserve the testimonies of 
the world‚Äôs cultures.

HEAVY LOSSES LOOMING
‚ÄúMuch of the material stored in research 
institutions will disappear within the next 50 years 
and great losses have already been incurred,‚Äù 
argues Sch√ºller. ‚ÄúEighty percent of audiovisual 
documents in the anthropological field, dialects, 
musical festivals etc. are not kept in archives 
proper but in collections attached to research 
institutions and museums. Their analogue 
documents are still playable, but many of them, 
and increasingly so, are chemically unstable 
and sooner or later all magnetic tapes we have 
will deteriorate to a point they will no longer be 
playable. Another problem is that the old replay 
machines are about to disappear and then, even if 
you have the best-preserved collections, you will 
not have the machinery to play them. Unless there 
is concerted effort country by country on a grand 
scale to digitize this material, the knowledge we 
have today ‚àí especially in the fields of social 
and cultural anthropology, will fade away.‚Äù We 
stand to ‚Äúlose 80 percent of what we have in 
the anthropological field,‚Äù he insists, explaining 
that ‚Äúgenerally speaking, the more modern the 
support, the less stable it is, a wax cylinder 
recording lasts longer than a magnetic tape or 
CD-Rom.‚Äù
Similarly, old paper is more stable than the 
acidic wood pulp paper introduced in the mid-
19th century. Acidic paper poses a problem for 
collections of 19th and 20th centuries printed texts 
and manuscripts, particularly those situated in 
countries in transition, in Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union where most of the printing 
Asian Documentary 
Heritage
Asia has an ancient 
tradition of archival 
preservation, as 
exemplified by the Hor 
Tri Klang Nam (or Tri 
Pitaka Pavilion) at Wat 
Yai Suwannaram in 
Petchaburi, Thailand, 
and by Janggyeong 
Panjeon, also known 
as Tripitaka Koreana, 
at the Haeinsa 
Temple in Korea. 
Both libraries are 
outstanding examples 
of traditional mastery 
of preservation 
parameters. Both 
ensured that their 
collections remained 
dry; well ventilated 
and protected from 
excessive light. The 
Thai library was built 
on stilts in a lake 
for protection from 
rodents.
Traces of the rich 
library traditions 
of Asia can also 
be found, in India, 
Laos and Myanmar, 
according to Guy 
Petheridge, who 
has high praise for 
the Preservation of 
Lao Manuscripts 
Programme operated 
by the governments 
of Laos with funding 
from Germany. Laos 
has a rich documentary 
heritage with surviving 
literary works dating 
back to the 15th 
and16th centuries, 
many of which are yet 
to be studied. However, 
neglect over decades is 
taking its toll on tens of 
thousands of religious 
texts, learned and 
literary writings about 
history, traditional 
law and customs, 
astrology and magic, 
mythology and ritual, 
traditional medicine 
and healing, grammar 
and lexicography, as 
well as poetry and a 
huge number of verse 
epics and folktales.
These manuscripts, 
written on palm leaf 
or mulberry paper, are 
stored in traditional 
wooden caskets in 
the traditional library 
structures in some 
1,700 Buddhist wats or 
monasteries all over 
the country.

was done on the cheapest paper, says Guy 
Petheridge of AusHeritage, network in Australia√©, 
who has carried out an evaluation of the MOW 
programme.
Institutions in developing countries are hard 
put to pay for scanning technologies now used 
by Western libraries and institutions to save 
threatened material. There have recently been 
reports in the press about the sorry state of one 
of Argentina‚Äôs largest print media libraries, the 
Jos√© Hern√°ndez Library in Buenos Aires where 
110 years of Argentinean newspapers are rotting 
away, victims of the economic crisis that has hit 
the country.
INDIGENOUS DOCUMENTARY 
HERITAGE
Documentary heritage is a nearly universal 
phenomenon, with properties worth saving in 
places not generally known for their written 
culture. Thus, four sets of Philippines syllabaries 
of the 10th century AD, the Philippines 
Paleographs, are on the Register. They represent 
articulate sounds and remain in use to this day.
‚ÄúThere is a western assumption that indigenous 
people only have oral traditions‚Äù, says Petheridge, 
and ‚Äúwhen the first Spanish navigators arrived 
in the Philippines, they were amazed by the fact 
that here were people who were not credited 
with the nobility of the writing tradition, merrily 
writing away. This was also the case in Sumatra. 
We have records of systems going back to the 
7th or 8th centuries AD but which may be older. 
The Bataks in northern Sumatra still preserve 
the tradition of writing complex divinatory 
manuscripts. In the Philippines a couple of 
hunter-gatherer populations are keeping that 
script alive.‚Äù
The preservation of this documentary 
heritage should help us appreciate the wealth 
of humanity‚Äôs cultures and the programme‚Äôs 
usefulness - especially its endeavours to digitize 
material - becomes all the more apparent when 
considering the huge losses that have already 
been suffered over the past century such as the 
destruction of some of the most precious books 
and manuscripts preserved in Germany when 
a flood hit the cellars of the former Royal and 
Provincial Library in Hanover in 1946; or the 
damage by fire of about 3.6 million books in 
the former Soviet Union‚Äôs Academy of Sciences 
Library in Leningrad in 1988, described as the 
single greatest library disaster in the 20th century.

### A Leap of faith
A leap of faith
Back in the mid-1990s people 
 were fleeing the centre of 
 Frankston, a suburb 
of Melbourne on Australia‚Äôs southern coast. The 
city centre had been taken over by drug-dealers, 
addicts and beggars and was seen as a violent 
and dangerous place. The whole city, where 
nearly two-thirds of the residents are under 40, 
had a bad reputation.
Last December, Frankston staged a grand 
opening of its new Safer City Centre, a joint 
town and police effort that broke new ground in 
Australia. The scheme, which made headlines in 
the national press and received the full backing 
of the local people, was the most visible example 
The Growing Up In Cities (GUIC) 
project aims to get young people involved 
in running their neighbourhoods.

of the hard work by the city‚Äôs leaders to fight the 
lawlessness and insecurity. 
It was achieved with the help of a team from 
Growing Up In Cities (GUIC), a UNESCO project 
aimed at getting youngsters involved in improving 
their environment (see box).
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE 
AND BOREDOM
GUIC came to Frankston in 1998. What it 
found were young people who said drugs and 
violence were the main problem, restricting their 
movements and the time they spent in the streets.  
They also said they were very bored.
At the urging of GUIC, the city council set up 
a Youth Safety Management Team in 1999 as 
one of four elements of an overall security plan. 
Its 15 or so members, aged between 16 and 19, 
asked for, and got, more police patrols to chase 
away the drug-dealers.  They also saw that public 
toilets were equipped with special bins for used 
syringes and the annoyingly dim ultra-violet 
lighting (to discourage the addicts) changed. They 
got classical music piped in the streets and the 
railway station was painted and better lit.
At their skateboard park, they had a fountain 
repaired and a hole in the fence mended, to 
stop skateboards shooting out onto the road by 
accident. The municipality has also set up a Drug 
and Alcohol Action Plan, with a section for youth. 
Bit by bit, the town centre has been revived and 
the spirit of regeneration has spread to the rest of 
the town.
Above: In Frankston, 
the police and the 
Council share a 
shopfront, the Safer 
City Centre -a first 
in Australia.
Left: GUIC in 
Bangalore (India). 
The ability to listen 
is one of the most 
critical skills 
for a successful 
participation 
programme
The city council said it was pleased with the 
scheme. ‚ÄúWe often refer to the GUIC report and 
it‚Äôs still important for finding out about growing 
up in Frankston. It‚Äôs given us a very solid 
foundation to work from,‚Äù says Geoff Cumming, 
53, the city‚Äôs amenity services manager, who has 
pitched in to help the young citizens.
The youngsters themselves are less sure, 
and say the experience has sometimes been 
frustrating. Amy Lee, 21, who used to chair the 
Youth Safety Management Team, says one of the 
biggest challenges is changing adult perceptions 
and stereotyping of young people.
Last year, the council disbanded the team, 
saying it had become hard to ‚Äúrecruit and 
maintain a connection with young people.‚Äù  Scott 
Duncan, 20, who joined it when he was 17, 
said youngsters had been discouraged because 
‚Äúdecisions were not being acted upon.‚Äù
But youth participation has taken root and 
young people are on the new Community Safety 
Management Team.  They include Scott and Amy, 
as well as Helen, 19, who has been helping to run 
her city for the past four years and says she has 
gained a lot from the experience, especially ‚Äúmore 
maturity than many of my friends.  I‚Äôve seen the 
political side of things, I‚Äôve learned how to run 
meetings and I‚Äôve learned from working with 
people older than me.‚Äù
Scott attends the new Team‚Äôs weekly 7.30 
a.m. meeting and is cautiously optimistic.  ‚ÄúThe 
process might be flawed but we can make it better 
and already have,‚Äù he says.
YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERT ADULTS 
TO KEEP THEIR WORD
GUIC launched another such project in the 
South African suburb of Canaansland, near 
Johannesburg, in 1996 and children and young 
people enthusiastically took part in the survey to 
find out what they most needed, such as running 
water, toilets, better health-care, a study centre 
and an enclosed sports field.  The town hall 
backed the scheme and projects for youngsters 
began to be drawn up.
But one bright morning, the slum‚Äôs 10,000 
inhabitants were brutally evicted by property 
developers and transferred to Thula Mntwana, 
a settlement 40 kms from Johannesburg, where 
they had to build new shacks. The change was 
dramatic. Many adults lost their jobs because they 
now lived too far away, water came in trucks at 
unpredictable times, and sanitation hardly existed.

Growing up in cities, 
a travelling project
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often said 
today‚Äôs cities are 
built for middle-aged, 
middle-class men in 
cars, but more and more 
of the world‚Äôs children 
are growing up in cities 
and their metropolitan 
surroundings,‚Äù says 
Louise Chawla, 
an environmental 
child psychologist 
who is International 
Coordinator of the GUIC 
project.
In 1995, she proposed 
to UNESCO the revival 
of a research project 
done in the 1970s by 
an American urban 
planner, Kevin Lynch, on 
how children and young 
people lived in cities, 
with the aim of getting 
decision-makers to 
take notice of what the 
youngsters suggested.
Today, the Growing Up 
In Cities (GUIC) project 
has been implemented 
in several places, 
including Melbourne 
(Australia), Buenos 
Aires (Argentina), 
Johannesburg (South 
Africa), Oakland 
(United States), 
Bangalore (India), 
Trondheim (Norway), 
Warsaw (Poland) and 
Northampton (United 
Kingdom).
Lynch‚Äôs methods have 
persisted.  Researchers 
from local universities 
interview children and 
young people, get 
them to draw their 
environment and to 
talk about what they 
would like to see and 
follow them up in 
their neighbourhoods.  
Then it is for the local 
authorities to meet the 
challenge ‚Äì or not.
These efforts are 
the subject of a 
book, Growing Up in 
an Urbanising World,* 
edited by Chawla.  
Despite greatly varied 
backgrounds, children 
and teenagers talk about 
their ideal surroundings 
in a surprisingly similar 
way.
What they appreciate 
‚Äì or would appreciate ‚Äì 
above all is feeling 
accepted and valued, 
feeling part of a close 
community, in an 
environment with lots 
of places to meet and 
where they can move 
around easily and safely. 
On the contrary, they 
suffer most when they 
feel sidelined, rejected 
and bored (especially 
in rich countries), fear 
violence and experience 
a lack of basic services.
That‚Äôs the theory.  
The practical part 
is in a ‚Äúmanual for 
participation‚Äù that David 
Driskell has written 
for urban planners, 
mayors, social services 
departments, etc.  
Called Creating Better 
Cities with Children 
and Youth,* it draws on 
solid experience in the 
field to show how to get 
young people involved 
in community policy-
making.  It deals with 
all aspects, including 
how to choose projects, 
conduct interviews or 
train city officials.
Town planners in 
Sweden, Lebanon, 
Jordan and Venezuela 
are now imitating the 
project.  Canada and 
several Arab countries 
are also considering 
such schemes.

### A Leap of faith

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003
However in 1999, with help from supporters 
from the North, GUIC managed to build a 
children‚Äôs centre and playground. A video was 
also made about the settlement‚Äôs children 
(see box).
Today, Thula Mntwana‚Äôs youngsters are 
despondent and dream of having a library and 
computers. The playground needs repairing, 
though that does not prevent the youngest born 
happily playing there. The only organizations 
that use the youth centre are two church 
congregations.  The local authorities have not 
followed up the scheme.  The only thing planned 
at the moment is the surfacing of the road.
But things are moving forward on another 
level. At the town council‚Äôs request, GUIC‚Äôs 
representative in South Africa, Jill Kruger, has 
just done a report on living 
conditions for children in four 
depressed neighbourhoods of the 
town. And last December, she 
organised workshops to find out 
what children thought for the 
Gauteng provincial government‚Äôs 
Programme of Action for Children.
‚ÄúThe children explained their 
problems and made suggestions 
about how they could take part,‚Äù 
she said, ‚Äúand provincial officials 
 have promised this will happen.‚Äù
DIFFERENT TIME-SCALES
But the children of Thula Mntwana may not 
know that and, anyway, they don‚Äôt function on 
the same time-scale as the town‚Äôs officials.  This 
gap is one of the major obstacles to genuine youth 
participation in local development.
The project worked in Frankston, says Karen 
Malone, its coordinator and director of GUIC for 
the Asia-Pacific region, because its leaders were 
really committed to the scheme and immediately 
agreed to the teenagers‚Äô request to set up a special 
Youth Committee. 
David Driskell, who heads GUIC in India, says 
the focus must be on modest material goals, 
such as the study centre set up for children in 
Bangalore, and on teaching decision-makers to 
genuinely listen to the young.
This is not something you can tke for granted,‚Äù 
he says. ‚ÄúKnowing how to listen is something that 
must be learnt, and to this end, GUIC has given 
us some valuable lessons.‚Äù

Asian cinema
Korean film director 
Im Kwon-Taek and 
French producer 
Pierre Rissient were 
awarded UNESCO‚Äôs 
Fellini Medal  on 
November 25, 2002. 
Im Kwon-Taek, whose 
last film - Chihwaseon 
(Drunk on Women 
and Painting), won 
the Best Director Prize 
at this year‚Äôs Cannes 
Film Festival in May 
2002, is recognized as 
one of Korea‚Äôs greatest 
film directors. Born in 
1936, he started his 
working life repairing 
soldiers‚Äô boots before 
entering the world 
of cinema in the 60s. 
His international 
reputation grew in 
the 1980s with the 
help of Rissient, who 
received the Fellini 
Medal in recognition 
of his exceptional 
contribution to the 
growth of world 
cinema. As a 
producer, director, 
distributor, talent-
spotter, selector of 
films for festivals, 
adviser to top 
directors and a 
programme planner, 
he has introduced 
the public to many 
major filmmakers 
from the United 
States, Europe and 
Asia. In the early 
1970s, he was the 
first Westerner to 
present Asian films 
at Cannes. 
Books for tolerance
A Philosophical Autumn
Memory and rationality 
were the themes of two 
seminars organized 
in September 2002 
by UNESCO in Latin 
America and Africa. 
The first, ‚ÄúHorizons of 
Memory,‚Äù was held in 
Rio de Janeiro, where 
people flocked to attend a 
round table on ‚ÄúMemory, 
distance and proximity,‚Äù 
gathering the American 
critic Susan Sontag, the 
German philosopher Peter 
Sloterdijk and the Italian 
writer Carlo Ginzburg.
During a roundtable in 
Benin on ‚Äúthe meeting of 
rationalities,‚Äù some one 
hundred thinkers explored 
the relativity of reason 
across cultures. Half the 
speakers were from the 
African continent, the 
others travelled from  
Europe, America and 
Asia. 
Philosophy for all: 
Philosophy Day on 
November 21 was marked 
by debates on current 
issues that attracted some 
3,500 people to UNESCO 
headquarters. Some sixty 
philosophers addressed 
topics such as citizenship, 
globalisation, science, 
poverty, justice, cultural 
diversity and the media. 
Among them, the French 
philosophers Paul Ricoeur, 
Edgar Morin, Fran√ßois 
Jullien and Genevi√®ve 
Fraisse; Tanella Boni of 
C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Youssef 
Seddik of Tunisia, Ngoc 
Nguyen of Viet Nam and 
the American Richard 
Rorty. A jazz concert 
closed the day.
Celebrated in over 
50 countries around the 
world, the second edition 
of  Philosophy Day will 
be held on 21 November 
2003.
http://www.unesco.org/shs/
eng/philosophyday.shtml
Antonio Sk√°rmeta from 
Chile and Jenny Robson 
from South Africa are 
the winners of the 
2003 UNESCO Prize for 
Children‚Äôs and Young 
People‚Äôs Literature in 
the Service of Tolerance, 
which will be presented 
at the Children‚Äôs Book 
Fair in Bologna (Italy) in 
April.
Sk√°rmeta‚Äôs book, 
La Composici√≥n (The 
Composition), is about 
a boy living under a 
military dictatorship 
who saves his parents 
from coming under 
suspicion with a 
composition in which he 
reflects on the position 
of children in totalitarian 
regimes.
Because Pula Means 
Rain, is the title of 
Robson‚Äôs book, which 
tells the story of an 
albino child who lives 
in Botswana with his 
grandmother and who 
wants to be 
brown like 
everybody else 
and not be shunned by 
them.  
The prize, founded in 
1995 and awarded every 
two years, is sponsored 
by the Grupo Editorial SM 
of Spain. Winning authors 
each receive $US8,000. 
This year ºs contest drew 
353 entries from 54 
countries.

A model communications 
course for Africa
Planning it right
Prizes for Peacemakers
Remembering
Cambodia‚Äôs genocide
UNESCO has just published 
a specialized course book 
entitled ‚ÄúCommunication 
Training in Africa: Model 
Curricula‚Äù, available 
in English and French. 
Communication students 
from this region usually 
use foreign textbooks that 
are poorly adapted to the 
current social, political and 
economic context, as well 
as to local cultures. The 
cost of these books is also 
prohibitive, preventing their 
large-scale distribution. 
UNESCO hopes that 
this model curriculum, 
available free of charge on 
the Web (*), will become 
a reference and set new 
standards for training 
African communication 
specialists.

A documentary 
by Cambodian 
filmmaker Rithy 
Panh, ‚ÄúThe Khmer 
Rouge Killing 
Machine‚Äù will 
be screened next 
April in Paris. Co-
produced by UNESO 
and the French 
audiovisual institute 
(INA), the film 
evokes the 
Cambodian 
genocide. 
Rithy Panh, 
who lived 
through Pol Pot‚Äôs 
dictatorship, firmly 
believes that a 
society‚Äôs collective 
memory can be 
constructed from 
the individual 
recollections of 
both victims and 
killers. As such, 
the documentary 
presents wrenching 
testimonies 
involving survivors 
and former killers 
from Tuol Sleng, 
a torture and 
extermination camp 
in Phnom Penh.

In the course of 2002, UNESCO 
awarded several prizes to honour 
the work of individuals and 
citizens engaged in defending 
human rights and peace.
Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar 
was named laureate of the 
UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize 
for the Promotion of Tolerance 
and Non-Violence on October 4 
for her unrelenting and peaceful 
struggle to establish democracy 
in Burma. This $100,000 prize  
was created by the Indian writer 
and diplomat Madanjeet Singh, 
who is also a 
UNESCO Goodwill 
Ambassador.  
Xanana Gusm√£o, 
president of East 
Timor, became the 
2002 laureate on 
October 9 of the 
F√©lix Houphou√´t-
Boigny Peace Prize, 
worth 122,000 
Euros. A hero of 
East Timor‚Äôs freedom movement, 
Mr Gusm√£o was arrested by the 
Indonesian army in 1992 and 
held in jail until 1999. 
On November 12, the Mexican 
Academy for Human Rights 
was awarded the 2002 UNESCO 
Human Rights Education 
Prize. Founded in 1983, the 
organization has played a key 
role in Mexico‚Äôs democratisation 
process. It has notably been 
involved in training and 
establishing a national network 
of ombudsmen. UNESCO‚Äôs International 
Institute for Educational 
Planning has begun 
an intensive training 
programme for Afghan 
education managers. 
Through a series of 
workshops being held 
mainly in Kabul, education 
officials are receiving 
courses in cost analysis 
and financial planning, 
budgeting for education, 
management of academic 
staff and space and strategic 
management. By August, 
the IIEP reckons there will 
be enough people with basic 
training in these areas to 
begin work on a five year 
plan for higher education.
The project is financed 
by Germany, which has 
contributed $US150,000.

Architecture with
a Green touch
This year‚Äôs two UNESCO 
architecture prizes, 
awarded to young 
graduates, were placed 
under the mark of 
sustainable development. 
The $7,000 Prize for 
Architecture, given in 
Venice on December 2, 
focused on exploring 
sustainable ways to 
revive urban wastelands. 
It went to three Italian 
women, all young 
graduate architects from 
Italy‚Äôs Genoa University: 
Erika Bisio, Giulia and 
Irene Carpeneto. Their 
project looked at ways 
to restore Berlin‚Äôs Mitte 
neighbourhood, home 
to extensive wasteland 
belonging to the national 
railway company.
The second $3,500 prize 
for landscape architecture, 
which focused on the 
conservation and efficient 
use of water, was awarded 
on January 15, 2003 
to four young Chinese 
architects ‚Äì two men and 
two women - respectively 
Zhang Lu, Han Pingyue, 
Li Zhengping and Liu 
Yanzhuo, during a 
ceremony held at Beijing‚Äôs 
UNESCO office. 
Shaky recovery for coral reefs
Fluid goals and hard reports 
18 new biosphere 
reserves 
Eighteen new sites in 
12 countries have been 
added to UNESCO‚Äôs World 
Network of Biosphere 
Reserves, while five 
existing biosphere reserves 
have been extended. The 
Network now includes 
a total of 425 sites in 
95 countries. 
The new biosphere 
reserves vary greatly in 
size; population density, 
ecological features, land 
use and challenges. 
Benin, Burkina Faso 
and Niger created 
the first 
transboundary 
biosphere reserve 
in Africa, known 
as the ¬´W¬ª 
Region, which 
covers more 
than one million 
hectares. At the same time, 
the Dominican Republic 
inscribed its first site, 
the Jaragua-Bahoruco-
Enriquillo Biosphere 
Reserve (Dominican 
Republic), covering almost 
half a million hectares 
of a complex mosaic of 
ecosystems ranging from 
marine and coastal areas 
to various forest types and 
summits up to 2,300 m, as 
well as a unique lake lying 
below sea level. 
A new report on the health of 
the world‚Äôs coral reefs shows 
that some of the areas worst 
hit by massive bleaching 
in 1997-98 have begun to 
recover. Entitled Status of Coral 
Reefs of the World: 2002, the 
report was published through 
the Australian Institute of 
Marine Science (AIMS) and 
prepared by the Global Coral 
Reef Monitoring Network 
(GCRMN), consisting of 
governments, institutes and 
NGOs from over 80 countries. 
UNESCO‚Äôs Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC) is one of the network‚Äôs 
sponsors and implementing 
agencies.
A main threat to reefs, 
says the report, continues to 
come from humans. But it 
also warns that this year‚Äôs El 
Nino - an unusual warming 
of the surface of the tropical 
Pacific that caused most of 
the serious 1997-98 global 
bleaching events - could 
setback recovery. According 
to the report, coral reefs 
provide ¬´goods and services¬ª 
worth US$ 375 billion per year 
(e.g. fish, tourism, coastal 
protection, etc), while 500 
million people depend totally 
or partially on reefs being 
damaged.
One of the main 
events of International 
Year on Freshwater, 
2003, for which 
UNESCO is a lead 
agency, was the 3rd 
World Water Forum, 
which took place 
in Kyoto (Japan) 
in March. At the 
forum, the World 
Water Assessment 
Programme 
(WWAP) involving 
23 UN agencies and 
hosted by UNESCO, 
presented its World 
Water Development 
Report. This is the 
first of a planned 
series of reports on 
the state of global 
water resources. 
The Report 
identifies critical 
issues and problems 
as illustrated by in-
depth case studies of 
selected river basins. 
One of the aims of 
the Year is to reassert 
the UN‚Äôs Millennium 
Declaration Goal on 
Water to halve by 
2015 the proportion 
of the world‚Äôs people 
without access to safe 
drinking water and to 
stop the unsustainable 
exploitation of water 
resources. Another 
target, endorsed by 
the World Summit 
on Sustainable 
Development 
(Johannesburg, South 
Africa), is to halve 
the proportion of 
people who do not 
have access to basic 
sanitation by 2015.

Towards a declaration on 
genetic data
The ninth session 
of UNESCO‚Äôs 
International 
Bioethics Committee 
(IBC) took place 
in Montreal last 
November 26-28, at 
the invitation of the 
Canadian government 
and with the support 
of Canada‚Äôs National 
Commission for 
UNESCO. During 
the meeting, the IBC 
worked on the outline 
of the International 
Declaration on 
Human Genetic Data, 
prepared last year by 
an IBC drafting group.
The text, which 
was modified to take 
into account the 
recommendations 
made in Montreal, 
is now being 
widely circulated 
for discussion. This 
global consultation 
will culminate next 
June with a meeting 
of governmental 
experts. If all goes 
well the draft will 
be submitted for 
adoption to UNESCO‚Äôs 
General Conference 
which is due to take 
place at the end of 
this year.
During the 
Montreal meeting the 
IBC elected Canadian 
former deputy health 
minister Mich√®le 
Jean as its new 
chairperson. It also 
debated a number 
of other issues 
including:  pre-
implantation genetic 
diagnosis and germ-
line interventions;  
and predisposition, 
susceptibility and 
genomic research; 
what implications for 
the future?
The Committee also 
discussed the possible 
preparation of a 
universal instrument 
on bioethics.
No to human cloning
Science without confidence
The widespread belief in 
the benefits of science 
went unchallenged for 
a long time. For many, 
science held the solution 
to the world‚Äôs problems, 
from feeding humanity, 
to ensuring good health 
for all and such like. 
This is no longer the 
case. Doubts have taken 
hold, and the direction 
taken by science ‚Äì from 
the atom to genetically 
modified organisms - is 
increasingly contested. 
How then can we 
restore the trust between 
society and science? 
Such was the theme of 
a Youth Forum held on 
December 3, organized 
by the UNESCO‚Äôs 
World Commission on 
the Ethics of Scientific 
Knowledge and 
Technology (COMEST) 
and the Palais de la 
d√©couverte (Paris), where 
the meeting was held.
Four young scientists 
from Norway, Sweden, 
The Netherlands and 
France discussed trust 
in science and scientific 
freedom to an audience 
of students from several 
schools. The Forum was 
held parallel to two-day 
working meeting of 
the COMEST, of which 
Norwegian professor 
of mathematical logic,  
Jens Erik Fenstad, is the 
current chairperson.
A criminal act or a 
charlatan‚Äôs stunt? The 
announcement of the first 
cloning of a human being 
at the end of 2002 by a 
publicity-hungry sect did 
not convince the scientific 
community.  But it did 
provoke a wave of shock and 
outrage around the world. 
The Director-General of 
UNESCO Ko√Øchiro Matsuura 
condemned ‚Äúsuch criminal 
practices, which we can only 
regard with disapproval and 
dismay.‚Äù He recalled Article 
11 of the UNESCO Universal 
Declaration on the 
Human Genome 
and Human Rights, 
which states that 
‚Äúpractices which 
are contrary to 
human dignity, such 
as reproductive 
cloning of human 
beings, shall not 
be permitted.‚Äù 
Mr Matsuura 
added ‚Äúthere can 
be no progress 
for humanity in 
a world where science 
and technology develop 
independently of all ethical 
imperatives.  I therefore 
solemnly request political 
leaders in every country and 
the international scientific, 
intellectual and juridical 
community to cooperate 
in taking all appropriate 
measures, at the national 
and international levels, 
to respond as swiftly as 
possible to these challenges, 
which are a threat to the 
irreplaceable uniqueness of 
the human being.‚Äù

Literacy for a better world
Literacy is freedom, according to the Brazilian philosopher Paolo Freire, 
but for hundreds of millions of the world‚Äôs poorest people the 
 opposite is also true: illiteracy is a tool of oppression.
ÓÅÆ  Village revolutions   p.56
Bangladeshi lesson
ÓÅÆ Voices of change   p.60
Empowerment in India
ÓÅÆ  Slum haven   p.62
A pioneering Delhi school
Conceived and prepared by 
Brendan O‚ÄôMalley, International 
Editor of the British weekly, The
Times Educational Supplement
It means, for instance, that corrupt local officials in drought-stricken 
eastern India can withhold rations from poor farmers in favour of 
their own cronies, because the farmers can‚Äôt read the official list of 
beneficiaries; or that divorced women and their children in rural villages 
of Bangladesh are left to starve when their husband leaves them, because 
they haven‚Äôt been able to register their marriage, so can‚Äôt claim their right 
to a share of the family home.
Today an estimated 861 million adults including 140 million 15-24 
year-olds worldwide are illiterate, despite literacy being recognised as a 
human right more than half a century ago. Of course, there is much to 
debate about how illiteracy is defined in different countries. But there is 
widespread acceptance that if we are to live in a world where every man, 
woman and child can fulfil their potential as free human beings, illiteracy 
must be tackled.
The most powerful engine of change is the worldwide commitment to 
achieve Education for All by 2015, made at the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, Senegal, in 2000.
Providing a good primary education to every child is the key to 
preventing today‚Äôs children becoming tomorrow‚Äôs new generation of 
illiterate adults. But the international community has so far failed to offer 
more than a token gesture towards the Dakar promise that no country 
seriously committed to achieving Education for All would miss the goal 
for want of resources.
Without more funds, countries that abolish school fees, for example, 
will struggle to prevent a mass intake of pupils being matched by 
plummeting quality of learning as pupil:teacher and pupil:textbook ratios 
shoot up.  The United Nations Literacy Decade (2003-12) can contribute by 
focusing attention on the need to ensure that rising levels of literacy are 
achieved alongside rising enrolment.
Stamping out illiteracy is a global imperative not 
just to help individuals fulfil their potential but because 
literacy can be used as powerful tool for change 
in the worldwide fight against poverty and injustice. 
This report examines how the problem can be tackled

Schools are only part of the solution, however, because a 
massive number of adults and youths have never been to 
school and huge numbers of children who do go drop out 
before they have learned to read and write.
The record of formal adult literacy programmes shows 
that new ways of learning literacy and creating lasting 
literate environments need to be developed if the target of 
halving adult literacy is to be achieved.
This means having flexible lesson and course completion 
times, learning material tailored to the learner‚Äôs interests 
and culture, teachers or facilitators trained and supported 
in using active learning methods, and learners having a 
say in the running of their own education. Above all, as is 
shown in three very different and successful programmes 
documented in this report ‚Äì the people‚Äôs centres in 
Bangladesh, a Reflect programme in Orissa, and a slum 
school in New Delhi ‚Äì it involves learners consolidating 
their literacy by putting it to use in the most dynamic of 
ways: tackling the causes of their own poverty, challenging 
injustice and improving life in their community.

F or decades shocking rates of illiteracy, 
  particularly in the poorest countries 
 have been declining. But UNESCO and 
other international agencies warn that a great deal 
more needs to be done.
In some countries, notably the former communist 
states, the gains of the past decades may even be 
lost as resources for education fall back. In many 
African countries millions of new teachers will 
be needed to deal mostly with rising demand for 
education, but also to offset considerable losses to 
the profession from the AIDS pandemic. 
And in states emerging from severe internal 
crises, such as Afghanistan and East Timor, it is 
challenging enough to deal with the short-term

needs of reopening and rebuilding damaged schools 
without having to think of longer-term goals. 
A UNICEF study in 1998 predicted that illiteracy 
rates could even grow during the 21st century after 
declining dramatically during the 20th. Several other 
agencies have been similarly pessimistic saying that 
famine, conflicts and natural disasters have created 
huge refugee populations where children receive 
little or no schooling for long periods. 
According to UNESCO‚Äôs statistics, nearly one in 
seven of the world‚Äôs six billion people cannot read 
or write. This represents a considerable advance on 
the first survey of world illiteracy published in the 
1950s when 44 per cent of the world‚Äôs population 
was found to be illiterate. 
Women and girls make up two-thirds of illiterate 
people, although the gender gap is narrowing, and 
recent figures show that women are even gaining 
access to education and literacy at a faster rate than 
men. The trend is most evident in Africa where the 
percentage of illiterate women over the age of 15 
fell 6.4 per cent over the past decade to 49 per cent. 
Even so, the number of illiterate people is far too 
high - they are invariably from the poorest, most 
marginalized sections of society.
UNESCO‚Äôs first progress report since the World 
Education Forum is sobering: more than 70 countries 
will not achieve all the Dakar goals which include 
access to free schooling of acceptable quality for 
all children of primary school age, the elimination 
of gender disparities in schooling and a halving of 
adult illiteracy by 2015. 
Some 28 countries were not expected to achieve

years. The Bank notes that in countries such as 
Rwanda, Malawi and Zambia incremental costs due 
to HIV/AIDS will increase recurrent budgets by 45 
percent. These figures have been issued at a time 
when both bilateral and multilateral aid to education 
has been declining.
However, even poor countries have shown that 
where there is the political will, much can be 
achieved. Cuba was able to mobilize nearly 270,000 
adults to reduce illiteracy from 23 to 3 percent 
within a few years of Fidel Castro‚Äôs 1959 revolution. 
More recently, Haiti, with a 52 per cent illiteracy rate 
has opened thousands of centres to teach Creole and 
reduce illiteracy to 25 percent by 2004. 
But the challenge remains daunting.  To achieve 
universal primary education by 2015, more than 15 
million new teachers will be needed ‚Äì three million 
of them in sub-Saharan Africa alone ‚Äì requiring 
massive investment in teacher training. Developing 
countries are also having a hard time even hanging 
on to trained teachers, many of whom are being 
poached by richer countries to cover their own 
shortages.
NO COUNTRY IS IMMUNE 
TO FUNCTIONAL ILLITERACY
In many of the world‚Äôs richest countries where 
free universal primary and secondary education is 
widely seen as having wiped out illiteracy, nearly 
a quarter of the adult population is incapable of 
understanding and using information contained 
in brochures, instruction leaflets for household 
appliances or medicines. 
No country, including many with decades of 
universal public education in place, is immune to so-
any of the three essential goals, two thirds of them 
in sub-Saharan Africa, but also including India and 
Pakistan. Other high-risk countries include several 
North African and the Arab states. Some central 
and eastern European nations are even moving 
backwards from previously high rates of literacy, as 
early childhood education in particular is cut back, 
and funding for education overall reduced. 
Worldwide, 78 countries are unlikely to halve adult 
illiteracy rates. They include four of the world‚Äôs 
most populated countries: Bangladesh, China, India 
and Pakistan which alone account for 61 percent of 
the world‚Äôs illiterate adults. 
Moreover, even those countries that appear to 
be on target will not be able to reach these goals 
without substantial foreign aid. The World Bank 
has attempted to quantify the amount of financial 
assistance required, particularly in Africa. It 
estimates a minimum funding gap of US$2.5 billion 
a year over 15 years rising to US$4.2 billion in some

called functional illiteracy ‚Äì when people have either 
lost or never properly acquired adequate reading 
and writing skills necessary to function in present 
day society. In the case of the richest countries, it is 
a chilling indictment of school systems. 
The extent of functional illiteracy in rich countries 
only came to light in the mid-1990s as a result of 
the International Adult Literacy Survey, a 22-country 
study of 16-65 year olds conducted by the OECD. It 
found a clear gap between educational attainment 
and skills. But more revealing was the number of 
older people who, having learnt basic reading and 
writing skills at school, had lapsed into illiteracy 
because they did not use their skills in a way that 
was relevant to them. 
Definitions of literacy have changed over the 
years, from being unable to read and write in any 
language, to completion of five years of compulsory 
schooling. Now it is thought that to fully function 
in today‚Äôs complex society, six to eight years of 
schooling is the absolute minimum.
However, the high functional illiteracy levels in 
countries where 12 years of compulsory schooling 
exists suggest that a more reliable measure of 
acquisition is needed.
Yojana Sharma
Jail breakers
In the world‚Äôs  
wealthiest nation, 
the United States, an 
estimated 70 percent 
of the more than 
two million-strong 
prison population 
lack the reading skills 
to navigate many 
everyday tasks or hold 
down anything but a 
menial job, according 
to a National Adult 
Literacy Survey. 
With legal means of 
succeding in society 
narrowed, illiteracy 
is heavily implicated 
in the crimes landing 
many behind bars in 
the first place, says 
Raul Romero, Assistant 
Superintendent of 
Correctional Education 
in California, where 
half those incarcerated 
are illiterate.
San Quentin, near 
San Francisco, home 
to 6,000 men including 
nearly 600 awaiting 
execution on Death 
Row, is considered 
California‚Äôs best-served 
jail educationally, with 
three classrooms, 
ten instructors and 
a shifting cast of 
volunteers. Many 
inmates slipped 
through the academic 
net because they didn‚Äôt 
respond to traditional 
teaching methods, says 
education chief, Jean 
Bracey. Accordingly, 
staff deploy ‚Äúlanguage 
experience‚Äù 
techniques, asking 
inmates their life story 
and teaching them 
the words in it. ‚ÄúThey 
learn quickly because 
it‚Äôs meaningful to 
their life,‚Äù explains 
Bracey. To break the 
cycle of illiteracy, they 
are taught children‚Äôs 
stories to read to their 
kids during visiting 
hours. For external 
validation and positive 
reinforcement, 
certificates are 
awarded at ceremonies 
in the prison chapel, 
to which prisoners‚Äô 
families are invited.
San Quentin is 
hardly a nurturing 
environment for 
learning, though. 
Education-minded 
prisoners must cram 
on bunks in cramped, 
shared cells amid a 
raucous din, enduring 
frequent lockdowns 
confining them to 
their cells for weeks 
on end and forgoing 
pocket money they 
might otherwise earn 
from manual labour. 
Moreover, Bracey 
reckons she can only 
reach ten percent 
of inmates with the 
resources at her 
disposal.
Some motivated 
prisoners beat the 
odds, however. Niiboye 
Annan, 24, put himself 
through classes he 
missed as a 14-year 
old dropout, earning 
a school-leaving 
certificate.
Literacy isn‚Äôt only 
the cornerstone of 
education and learning 
marketable vocational 
skills, it‚Äôs a vehicle for 
personal growth, he 
says. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm 
from the streets, all I 
can do is sell dope,‚Äô 
Now I realize I‚Äôm a man 
with skills I can use.‚Äù
Annan credits his 
success to Patrick 
Mims, chairman 
of Project Reach, a 
cadre of 23 inmate 
tutors formed to pass 
on the benefits of 
learning. Mims, 40, a 
self-professed former 
‚Äústreet hustler‚Äù, 
serving 15 years to 
life for second-degree 
murder, earned a two-
year college degree by 
correspondence. He 
has clout with inmates 
because he‚Äôs one of 
them, showing what‚Äôs 
possible if they apply 
themselves.
Mims recalls helping 
Kermit Johnson, 37, 
who was struggling 
with writing in his 
literacy classes. ‚ÄúI 
asked him to write an 
essay about his shirt. 
Next, I showed him 
how you set an essay 
up and said, ‚ÄòNow write 
about your jacket.‚Äô Now 
he‚Äôs realised he can 
do it.‚Äù
A recent US education 
department study 
found that prison 
education programmes 
reduced recidivism 
by 29 percent. But in 
California, America‚Äôs 
largest penal system, 
just two percent of the 
annual budget is spent 
on education. That‚Äôs a 
‚Äúfalse economy‚Äù, says 
Bracey.

### The Floodgates open
focus
The floodgates open
At Ayany Primary School in a  Nairobi 
suburb, 120 pupils are huddled 
together in a classroom built for 40. 
Most are seated on the floor, their knees supporting 
exercise books, because there are not enough desks. 
The teacher, Jane Onyango, has no chalk to use 
on her splintered blackboard, so she is dictating 
science notes to her pupils. Like schools throughout 
the country, Ayany has been swamped since the 
new government dramatically fulfilled its election 
pledge to abolish school fees on January 7.
The road to Education for All is rocky and pitted 
with potholes, and nowhere more so than in sub-
Saharan Africa. Forty percent of the estimated 115.4 
million children out of school worldwide live in this 
region, the only one in which primary enrolment 
has actually fallen in the past ten years. 
Poverty caused by foreign debt repayments, 
poor investments, protracted civil wars, misplaced 
priorities, corruption and poor governance has 
resulted in a relentless decline in public spending on 
the school system. 
But there has been no loss of desire among the 
people for the benefits that literacy and wider 
learning can bring, as the new Kenyan government 
discovered on January 7, when almost 2.5m new 
pupils showed up for school. Primary enrolment 
shot up to 8.7m.  Schools that usually admitted 160 
pupils each year suddenly had to deal with more 
than 3,000 applicants.
At Olympic Primary School in Nairobi, where 
5,000 hopeful pupils turned up, riot police had to be 
called in to restore order when teachers told parents 
there was no more room.

Abolishing school fees is the first step to achieving universal 
primary education, but as Kenya and Uganda‚Äôs experience 
shows, it is fraught with difficulty. Without adequate 
international support, the quality of education may plummet

‚ÄúWe have waited for this for too long and now we 
want our children in school,‚Äù said parent Japheth 
Mureithi.
Kenya has been through this chaos before. 
Education was declared free for children in 
standards one to four in 1974 and for the entire 
primary cycle in 1978. But in the mid-1980s the 
government reneged on the reforms, demanding 
that parents and communities contribute to their 
children‚Äôs schooling. Literacy levels have been 
slipping ever since.
With no guidelines in place, head-teachers were 
given a freehand to exploit parents at a time when 
jobs were being lost and agricultural output was 
falling. According to Daniel Sifuna, a professor of 
education at Kenyatta University, corrupt schools 
unilaterally started charging all sorts of levies, 
ranging from out of school activity to extra-
tuition fees. This time round school facilities, 
resources, equipment and teachers are again clearly 
overstretched. ‚ÄúWe are aware that classrooms are 
inadequate and whenever possible, we shall make 
use of churches, mosques, social halls and tents,‚Äù 
said Raila Odinga, the minister of public works 
and housing and a leading member of the National 
Rainbow Coalition that promised free schooling. 
The government, which already spends 27 percent 
of its budget on education, estimates it will cost 
$140m a year ‚Äì some officials say $200m ‚Äì to cater 
for 7m pupils. This year the government could only 
afford to give $6.5m to schools.
The World Bank, International Monetary Fund 
and other multilateral donors had withdrawn 
support for the previous government in 1997 
because of its record on corruption.  But the Bank 
last month announced it will give $40m-$50m in 
June for education materials. But that still leaves a 
shortfall of up to $93.5m.
For now, ordinary parents are oblivious to the 
country‚Äôs predicament. ‚ÄúThe government has 
abolished the building fund and activity fees and 
will pay for books, desks and chalk, and employ 
security guards for schools,‚Äù said a vegetable 
hawker in Nyeri, the home district of President 
Kibaki. ‚ÄúNow I will only have to buy the school 
uniform for my children and everything else will be 
taken care of by the government.‚Äù 
In neighbouring Uganda, the universal primary 
education drive, is being hailed as the most 
successful in sub-Saharan Africa, but it also 
demonstrates the enormity of the task at hand. 
Unlike Kenya, Uganda first rallied massive support 
from a consortium of agencies that include the 
World Bank, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, African 
Development Bank, World Food Programme and the 
European Union.
Major donors include the government aid agencies 
of Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the 
United Kingdom and the United States. To build 
up the country‚Äôs capacity to run its own education 
system, they agreed to operate within a single 
programme led by the government in consultation 
with them as part of a national strategy to eliminate 
poverty. 
When free education was announced for the first 
four children of every family in 1997, enrolment 
doubled from 2.9m to 5.8m. ‚ÄúWe raised the 
enrolment rate of primary-aged children from 54 
percent in 1996 to 72 percent last year,‚Äù said Dr 
Khiddu Makubuya, minister of education and sports.
But the drive was hampered from the start by a 
gross shortage of adequate schools, most of which 
had been ravaged, through years of despotism or 
civil war under the governments of Idi Amin and 
Milton Obote
‚ÄúOver two million children who had been selling 
mangoes and chasing birds in the countryside 
entered school simultaneously and it was a 
huge task for us,‚Äù added Geraldine Namirembe 
Bitamazire, minister of state for primary education. 
‚ÄúOvernight the teacher:pupil ratio rose to 1:110.‚Äù
The government doubled the number of teachers 
to 125,000; built a staggering 51,203 classrooms and 
has another 36,674 more under construction; it has 
delivered 87,000 desks since 1998; and increased 
the supply of textbooks from 16,000 in 1995 to 3m 
in 1999. But even that massive investment has not 
kept up with the numbers entering school and the 
country is now struggling to recover from the initial 
drastic fall in the quality of education. 
With 7.5 m pupils in 13,332 primary schools there 
is still only one teacher per 60 pupils on average. 
Many schools are terribly overcrowded and some 
Over 
2 million 
children 
entered 
school at 
the same 
time
Left:  At the Olympic 
Primary School 
in Nairobi, 5,000 
hopeful pupils turned 
up for enrolment  last 
January, when the 
new government 
made primary 
education free.
Above: Across the 
country, many 
are still waiting for 
a classroom.

### Donors drag their heels
focus
Donors drag    their heels
One of the most significant levers 
 for eradicating illiteracy is the 
worldwide drive to achieve 
universal primary education (UPE) by 2015. It was 
backed by some 180 countries, the United Nations 
and international aid organizations, and grassroots 
representatives at the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, Senegal in 2000. 
Developing countries pledged to draw up 
national action plans to achieve Education For All 
by 2002 and the international community pledged 
that no country that was serious about reform to 
achieve these goals would be thwarted by ‚Äúlack of 
resources‚Äù.
World leaders meeting at last year‚Äôs G8 summit 
in Canada backed a Fast Track Initiative led by the 
World Bank to assess and support national action 
plans and draw in funds from donor governments 
for countries ready to carry out the reforms.
The process has galvanized up to two dozen 
countries to re-examine their education systems and 
gear up towards making primary education free. 
The most spectacular development came when

have classes crammed with 150 pupils.
Moreover, in rural schools I visited, the new walls 
and floors are cracked, there are sub-standard pit-
latrines and doors and windows are broken.
Many still have severe shortages of desks, with 
lower primary pupils having to sit on stones. At 
Kawaso Primary School in Mukono, where a teacher 
said the money for building classes had been stolen, 
I found children still being taught under a tree. 
Despite the massive injection of textbooks, three 
pupils share every textbook in the core subjects of 
maths, science, English and social studies.
The ministry spent US$14 per primary pupil 
in 1999, but this is not enough to provide a good 
quality education to every child, according to Paul 
Murphy a World Bank specialist in Kampala. He 
urged the government to clamp down on officials 
who were stealing or diverting funds from education 
to other programmes.
Dr Makubuya said Uganda is already spending 
a colossal 31 percent of its total recurrent budget 
on education with primary education taking 70 
percent of that. But the UPE drive would have failed 
disastrously without aid from the donor consortium 
which last year provided 80 percent of the US$710 
million spent on Uganda‚Äôs education strategic 
investment plan. 
Uganda‚Äôs universal primary education effort 
stands head and shoulders above Kenya, Tanzania 
and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet more than 
one in four primary-age-children are still not in 
school.

### Donors drag their heels
focus
Donors drag    their heels
school fees in January and 
millions of extra children 
flooded into school.
By November 12, countries 
‚Äì Burkina Faso, Niger, 
Mauritania, Uganda, Ethiopia, 
Guinea, Mozambique, 
Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Guyana, Yemen and Tanzania 
‚Äì had finalized Education 
Action Plans and were 
waiting for donors to turn 
their pledges of support into 
cash. 
These are relatively small- 
population countries in which 
16m children do not attend 
school compared with an 
estimated 115.4m worldwide.
But aid officials from 
industrialized countries 
gathering at the first Donor 
Consortium on Education 
for All in Brussels in late 
November agreed to give only $400m to seven 
countries with four million out of school, instead 
of the $700m extra which the Global Campaign for 
Education - grouping NGOs and teachers unions 
- says is needed to fund the 12 countries‚Äô reforms.
‚ÄúIt is a tiny amount of money and they haven‚Äôt 
worked out where it is going to come from,‚Äù said 
Oliver Buston, senior policy adviser to Oxfam, a 
leading NGO in the GCE.
This does not bode well for attempts to rally 
support for reforms in the five countries with the 
highest out-of-school populations - 50 million 
children between  Bangladesh, Democratic Republic 
of Congo, India, Nigeria and Pakistan - as they will 
require massive hikes in aid to basic education.
In a briefing paper for the consortium, the Global 
Campaign said: ‚ÄúToo many countries are falling 
through the gaps because donors do not consider 
them to be politically strategic or because the 
donors that do support them do not focus on basic 
education.‚Äù
It also highlighted the serious lack of aid to basic 
education in Francophone Africa, an issue which 
France, the main donor engaged in those countries, 
could address. 
It urged Germany to follow through on its 
commitment to support up to three Fast Track 
countries ‚Äì Mozambique, which has increased 
education spending to 18 percent of its budget 
but needs an immediate $91m to launch its plan, 
Honduras and Guinea.
And it called on the United States to offer more 
help to Nicaragua, which despite a strong record on 
raising primary enrolment, especially among girls, 
can‚Äôt fund its plan without extra cash.
In all, the GCE is demanding that 18 countries  
ready to receive aid via the Fast Track Initiative 
be fully funded by June, and that a timetable be 
drawn up to extend funding to at least 30 countries 
including the big five.
The Dakar goal cannot be met, however, unless 
education also spreads in those countries that 
so far have not drawn up credible reform plans 
‚Äì whether due to weak government, the degrading 
of infrastructure by conflict, or corruption. 
One solution suggested by the 2002 Education 
For All Global Monitoring Report, is to send in an 
international task force to work with governments 
to draw up action plans and monitor progress. 
Acceptance by the host government would be the 
condition for receiving extra funds under the Fast 
Tract Initiative.
The EFA report warned that 57 countries are 
unlikely to achieve universal primary education by 
2015. 
However, one significant development is the 
impact being made by coalitions of civil society 
groups in developing countries who are pressing 
their governments to make UPE a priority. 
And a sign that the Dakar drive ‚Äì from UN-led 
international meetings down to village parents 
committees - is gaining some momentum is the new 
respect given to education ministers in government 
Cabinets, especially in Africa.
‚ÄúThe big change is that political will is being 
generated at all levels,‚Äù said Oliver Buston.
Brendan O‚ÄôMalley
‚ÄúToo 
many 
countries 
are 
falling 
through 
the 
gaps‚Äù

### The Pleasure factor

The pleasure factor
Raising literacy levels at school is not just about investing money, 
it means changing the way children are taught so that they enjoy learning.
natural creativity and curiosity about the world as a 
route to learning. 
This has made many schools a place to fear 
rather than a joyful learning experience, providing 
an additional reason, beyond poverty, why children 
should drop out of school.
A number of education programmes have shown 
how governments can improve learning among 
the rural poor without a significant spending hike, 
giving them the realistic prospect of being able to 
scale up the improvements across the country.
One of the biggest and longest lasting examples is 
the Escuela Nueva (new school) model that began in 
Colombia in 1975. It was eventually scaled up across 
more than 20,000 schools, and its creator, Vicky 
Colbert de Arboleda, was appointed education vice 
minister. 
The model has since been replicated in a host of 
countries ‚Äì including Brazil, Guatemala, Nicaragua, 
Chile, Uganda, Guyana and the Philippines ‚Äì with 
varying degrees of success. 
Similarly, Save the Children, an NGO, has been 
working for ten years with the Chinese provincial 
government in Tibetan Autonomous Region to 
raise standards in marginal populations by bringing 
in child-centred learning techniques. So far the 
Chinese authorities like what they see and a 
second programme has been established in Yunnan 
province.  
KEEPING KIDS IN SCHOOL
The Escuela Nueva programme was designed for 
multigrade rural schools with just one or two 
teachers ‚Äì which account for four out five schools 
in rural Colombia and are common in the least 
developed or most isolated communities of many 
developing countries. 
Previously the children were learning so little and 
the system of evaluation was so rigid that many 
pupils who had to take time off, for instance to 
help with the harvest, would repeat and repeat and 
eventually drop out.
‚ÄúWe started with demonstrative schools that 
The high number of illiterate adults 
worldwide stems in the first instance 
from the failure of societies to 
make their children literate even when they sit in 
school for four or five years. So even if governments 
do abolish school fees and make the massive 
investment in teachers, classrooms and books 
required to shore up the quality of education as 
pupil numbers soar, it may not be enough to ensure 
that every pupil learns to read and write.
This is because state education systems in many 
developing countries have scarcely developed 
pedagogically from those established by former 
colonial powers. They are invariably geared to the 
needs of the ruling (male) urban elite, rather than 
the very different lives of the masses of rural poor; 
and teaching often has more in common with army 
discipline, with rows of pupils silently copying notes 
from the board, than an attempt to exploit a child‚Äôs

UNESCO | the new Courier | April 2003
focus
gave teachers a new role and materials designed 
for this type of learning,‚Äù said Vicky Colbert. ‚ÄúWe 
brought in flexible promotion, active participatory 
and co-operative learning with children working 
in small groups. We spent time building skills 
of citizenship and democracy. We had strong 
community participation and we made sure the 
schools respected the different learning rhythms of 
the children.‚Äù
The pupils study independently or in groups 
using self-learning and co-operative group-learning 
guides. These combine a core national curriculum 
with regional and local adaptations made by the 
teachers. Evolved from activity cards, they are a 
textbook, active learning exercise book and teachers‚Äô 
guide rolled into one. Teachers are initially trained 
at the demonstration schools and build on their 
techniques once employed by attending practical 
workshops and sharing ideas with their peers at 
monthly meetings at local centres where they collect 
their pay. ‚ÄúSelf learning is the key,‚Äù said Colbert. 
‚ÄúThe teacher‚Äôs role is to help those who are not 
understanding.‚Äù
In tests after the model  had  been extended to 
more than 8,000 schools,  Escuela Nueva pupils 
outperformed control group pupils in Spanish, the 
official national language, at grades three and five 
by 19 and 8.5 percent respectively. 
At the same time the number of pupils dropping 
out or repeating years was significantly reduced. By 
1993 this was a $3.5 billion a year problem in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, where nearly one in 
three primary pupils were repeaters and only half 
the fourth grade pupils taking state tests were able 
to understand what they read. 
The Save the Children methods have a lot in 
common with those promoted by Escuela Nueva.
‚ÄúIn most schools in the world you see children 
sitting passively, brain dead, never moving, never 
asking questions,‚Äù said Marion Moreno, a global 
education advisor for Save the Children-UK. ‚ÄúIn a 
Save the Children class you will see them actively 
engaged, playing games to learn things, talking, 
moving about - and their learning shoots ahead.‚Äù
In Tibet, in partnership with provincial govern-
ments and the British Department for International 
Development, Save the Children introduced child-
centred learning methods in municipality schools in 
the snow-blown mountain valleys north of Lhasa, 
where previously two out of three children dropped 
out before completing nine years of education.
Teachers are given 16 days‚Äô training in 
questioning, group work, using games in the 
Teachers as guides
Inside the classroom 
at Poveda II primary 
school, 70km North-
west of Bogota, 
students‚Äô artwork and 
a painted map of the 
local area decorate 
the walls.  The school, 
situated just outside 
Tenjo village, adopted 
the Escuela Nueva (EN) 
teaching model for its 
70 pupils  two years 
ago and the desks are 
grouped to encourage 
collaboration  work. 
Bertha Bolonos, 
the headteacher, 
gives groups a box 
filled with words cut 
out from magazines.  
Students, aged 7 to 
16, pick five that are 
used as stimuli to 
write a creative story. 
Students correct 
each other‚Äôs work 
while Bolonos helps 
individuals. Laura 
reads her story to the 
class, urged on by 
enthusiastic applause.
The pace of the 
lesson is quick, 
intermingled with 
different activities and 
subjects. Bolonos next 
dictates three number 
puzzles. Juan finishes 
first and is eager to 
share his work with the 
class. He confidently 
approaches the 
board and writes 
his calculations 
while explaining his 
answers. 
In the playground, 
the hands-on learning 
emphasis continues.  
Bolonos instructs 
students to find a 
striking natural object. 
Flowers, wood and 
stones are collected 
and brought into the 
classroom.  Pupils 
write a description of 
the object they have 
chosen, saying what 
they see and feel. 
Bolonos reminds 
students of a story 
read last lesson and 
prompts them to 
analyse its characters, 
plot and meaning. 
‚ÄúThis helps to raise 
literacy levels as it 
links reading, writing 
and oral expression,‚Äù 
Bolonos explains. 
Democracy and 
citizenship are 
promoted at Poveda 
II through a student 
elected council giving 
pupils a role in the 
running of the school. 
Susanna, 16, who  
missed four years of 
school, points to a 
diagram on the wall 
showing branches of a 
tree representing the 
parts of the student 
body. ‚ÄúAs President of 
the Student Council,‚Äù 
she says, ‚ÄúI help 
teachers organize 
community events 
and our suggestions 
box and I make 
sure that everyone 
behaves properly.‚Äù 
For Bolonos, these 
structures ‚Äúcreate 
leaders and foster 
mutual respect‚Äù. 
She says this style 
of teaching is more 
rewarding than in 
traditional schools. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to the 
children. I form more 
personal relationships 
with them because 
I am not stuck in 
front of the board,‚Äù 
Bolonos says. She 
finds multigrade 
classes are easier to 
teach, because the 
older students take 
more  responsibility 
by helping younger 
students with their 
work. ‚ÄúPupils work at 
their own pace using 
the self-instructional 
guides,‚Äù she says.

 literacy
in schools
The 
language 
barrier
Dramatic inroads can be made 
on illiteracy by offering bilingual support 
to minority language children
Secondary pupils at North 
Westminster community 
school in inner London face a barrier to learning 
literacy that is familiar to hundreds of millions of 
minority children the world over ‚Äì the language they 
are learning to read in is not their mother tongue.
‚ÄúSeventy percent of our intake speak English as an 
additional language (EAL), and 60 percent of these 
are at the very early stages of English acquisition,‚Äù 
said literacy coordinator Frank Monaghan. 
This means that they do not have enough English 
to follow lessons and must be helped by a bilingual 
classroom assistant.
Research has found that pupils learn more 
English if they attend normal classes with special 
EAL assistants ‚Äì of which there is a severe shortage 
‚Äì rather than removing them for special language 
lessons as was common in the 1980s.
Even now some of North Westminster‚Äôs 2,000 
pupils ‚Äì often new arrivals from troubled regions 
such as Iraq, Afghanistan Somalia and the Balkans 
‚Äì need special support outside the classroom. Large 
numbers arrive at secondary school illiterate even 
in their mother tongue and another 12-15 percent 
classroom and using real local objects as teaching 
aids. Children are encouraged to learn, investigate, 
experiment and articulate their discoveries.
Save the Children evaluations in Tibet show 
the approach can markedly improve exam results 
without requiring investment in vast numbers of 
extra teachers.
‚ÄúTraining teachers in being affectionate and 
child friendly costs just a short training course 
and it keeps children in school,‚Äú Moreno said. ‚ÄúSo 
there is a big untapped potential for working with 
governments to change the system.‚Äù
However, the attempt to scale up the Escuela 
Nueva innovations across rural schools in Colombia 
shows how difficult this can be.
The 500-school pilot project was extended to 
3,000 schools between 1978 and 1986. Then, 
following the landmark decision by the government 
to make primary education compulsory and free, 
the target was raised to cover all 27,000 rural 
schools by 1992. But, during the upheaval caused 
by a concurrent national decision to federalize 
government, teachers were transferred on a massive 
scale and in many areas training slipped back into 
the traditional model, or the new learning materials 
did not arrive.
Colbert left the ministry to set about reviving the 
model through the Volvamos a la Gente (Back to 
the People) foundation, this time using partnerships 
between people, government and businesses. With 
coffee grower associations funding innovations 
including in information technology, and the state 
paying for materials, she focused on five regions to 
form a centre of excellence backed by these alliances.
Since then the recovery has gone from strength to 
strength. An international comparative study of 11 
Latin American countries carried out by UNESCO 
in 1998 found Colombia was the only one in which 
results in rural state schools were better than their 
urban counterparts. The World Bank selected 
Escuela Nueva as one of three education reforms in 
the world that had demonstrated success on a large 
scale. And Vicky Colbert was named as one of Latin 
America‚Äôs top 20 social entrepreneurs in 2002 by the 
Schwab Foundation.
‚ÄúIf you change the method and have the right 
materials, teachers can tackle a larger number of 
pupils,‚Äù Colbert said, ‚Äúand with the money saved 
you could even pay them more.‚Äù

Left: At North 
Westminster 
community school 
in London, bilingual 
teacher‚Äôs assistants 
help children who 
don‚Äôt have enough 
English to follow 
lessons. 
Above: Theatre 
rehearsals at the 
same school
have suffered a disrupted education that puts them 
many years behind what they would normally be 
achieving even in their own countries.
‚ÄúWithdrawal‚Äù for non-English speakers ‚Äúwas 
a slippery slope,‚Äù said Dr Monaghan. Pupils lost 
the vital link with their peer communities and 
many, particularly the younger ones, began to lose 
their own language while not properly mastering 
the new one, sending them into a spiral of 
underachievement.
But with 40 languages spoken at the school, 
some of them by only one or two pupils, bilingual 
assistants are only a partial solution. Instead 
North Westminster makes as much use as it can 
of ‚Äúpartnership teaching‚Äù where a mainstream 
subject teacher and a qualified teacher specializing 
in English as an additional language jointly plan 
and deliver lessons. Partnership teaching, pioneered 
in London 15 years ago is being copied in other 
countries with diverse minority groups with some 
success.
An estimated 476 million of the world‚Äôs illiterates 
are speakers of minority languages ‚Äì many of them 
with no written form ‚Äì in countries where schooling 
takes place in another (often colonial) language.
However, in many such countries bilingual 
programmes with initial teaching in the mother 
tongue have helped children become literate in both 
languages. 
Research has shown that learners can generalize 
the skill of reading and writing in the mother tongue 
to any other language the learner speaks.
In one project run by Save the Children in 
Mali, children start to acquire skills in their own 
language (Dogoso) and switch to French after a 
year or two. ‚ÄúQuite a few children who attend these 
schools are doing much better than children who 
attend ordinary state schools where French is the 
medium of instruction from the outset,‚Äù says Marie-
Madeleine Savitzky of the London Language and 
Literacy Unit at South Bank University.
In Peruvian Amazonia, where illiteracy was 
once the norm, 15,000 pupils speaking 28 different 
indigenous languages have benefited from the 
region‚Äôs 600 bilingual schools. Pupils whose mother-
tongue is an indigenous language and who attended 
bilingual programmes, all finished with a mastery 
of Spanish beyond that of mother-tongue speakers 
of a similar ability and social background who 
had attended a school where Spanish was the only 
medium of instruction, a 1987 study found.
Bilingual programmes particularly make sense 
in countries where speakers of diverse indigenous 
languages far outnumber speakers of the majority 
language. 
But raising literacy skills worldwide means 
tackling the problems of minority language groups 
wherever they occur.

The United Nations Literacy Decade will promote 
action for literacy everywhere and for all, especially  
those left behind by national education systems
The United Nations Literacy Decade, 
launched in February, and 
coordinated by UNESCO, will focus 
on reducing the number of adults and youths who 
cannot read and write.
These are the people whose national education 
systems have failed to reach, despite literacy being 
recognized as a human right more than half a 
century ago.
‚ÄúIt is a scandal that this right continues to be 
violated for such a large proportion of humanity,‚Äù 
said Ayogi Shigeru, chief of literacy at UNESCO.
The decade will bring to the fore the current 
debate about what exactly illiteracy is, how it can be 
measured and how it should be tackled. 
The new thinking as espoused by adult literacy 
experts such as Alan Rogers of Nottingham 
University and David Archer, head of education at 
ActionAid, an NGO, is that it is the continuing use 
of literacy that should be measured rather than its 
acquisition at one point.
They also advocate removing key barriers to 
learning such as the imposition of alienating 
teaching methods or even alien literacies on people 
by their own societies.
For instance, a significant obstacle to both 
literacy and development for the poorer non-English 
speaking people in Orissa, eastern India, is being 
lifted by the state government‚Äôs decision to abolish 
the use of English in government forms used to 
apply for drought rations and low-income subsidies. 
Instead they will use the state language, Oriya.
Increasingly government donors and aid agencies 
are tying literacy programmes to the eradication of 
poverty, rooting learning in the use of literacy in 
activities critical to people‚Äôs lives, to maximize their 
An ActionAid adult literacy 
programme in Uganda. The new 
thinking is that learning should 
be rooted in activities critical 
to people‚Äôs lives to maximize its 
impact

motivation and the impact of the skills acquired. 
There is also a growing recognition that learning 
and texts must be adapted to the particular needs 
and interests of individual villages. 
 ‚ÄúGovernments and teachers, literacy facilitators 
and project managers, should all think seriously 
about providing learner-centred tailor-made learning 
that is sensitive to the culture and language of the 
learners,‚Äù said Aoyagi. 
Similarly, schools targeting children in the poorest 
communities, where parents may be illiterate and 
children are often needed to work during the day, 
can adapt their timetable and methods to surmount 
the obstacles to children attending lessons.
An international plan of action on literacy has 
been drawn up by UNESCO for the Decade with the 
aim of achieving the international goal set in 2000 of 
raising literacy rates by 50 percent by 2015. 
With the Food and Agriculture Organisation,  for 
example, UNESCO launched a flagship programme 
last November to promote basic literacy in 
rural areas where learning is linked to people‚Äôs 
livelihoods as a tool to acquire and use knowledge 
on health, income-generation, small-scale credit, the 
empowerment of women, environmental degradation 
and other issues the learners want to pursue.
UNESCO has promoted this model in a host of 
Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, 
Indonesia and Thailand. ‚ÄúThese are multi-purpose 
learning centres that provide helpful education to 
villagers, where they can learn at any time, at any 
level according to their needs,‚Äù Aoyagi said.
Through the Asia Pacific Programme of Education 
for All, UNESCO is providing know-how on how 
to establish CLCs, design teaching methods and 
curricula, and train local learning facilitators 
(guides). 
The aim is to show donors that CLCs can produce 
tangible results and that, because they are owned 
and run by and for the community they serve, they 
can become self-sustaining.

Village revolutions
Hira Akhtar, 30, has invited me 
into her new house to see how 
her life has changed. She lives 
in one of hundreds of homesteads scattered amid 
clumps of coconut and date trees in Baniyar Kandar, 
a village surrounded by a watery patchwork of paddi 
fields in Jheneidah region, western Bangladesh.
Ten years ago, Hira explained, she and her 
husband, lived in a simple thatched hut, choked 
on smoke from cooking on an open fire, and awoke 
with the aches and pains that come from sleeping 
on a thin mat on a hard dusty mud floor.
It was all they could afford on the 1,000 taka 
(US$17) a month her husband Moslem Uddin made

as a share-cropper working rented fields. 
Today Moslem still earns the same amount 
working the land, every inch of which is cultivated 
in this densely populated area.
But Hira now earns 4,000 taka a month by 
using skills she picked up in a new style of literacy 
programme that is making inroads where traditional 
adult learning programmes have failed. 
Six years ago a non-governmental organization 
called Dhaka Ahsania Mission started classes in 
her village. They allotted a room in the house next 
door to Hira‚Äôs for people to meet and called it 
Ganokendra (The people‚Äôs centre). Soon her women 
friends were asking her to come along.
It was a big step to take. The women in her village 
were not allowed out, they could not meet strangers 
even if they visited their homes and most had never 
been to school.
‚ÄúBy tradition we could not even pronounce our 
husband‚Äôs name,‚Äù said Hira.
When she asked permission from her husband, 
who could barely pen a signature himself, he threw 
up his hands. ‚ÄúWhat will happen by reading all 
these books?‚Äù he asked.
But these were not ordinary books and the classes 
were not like at a school.
The NGO opened membership of the Ganokendra 
to representatives of the 250 poorest families out of 
the 311 families in the village - those earning less 
than 2,700 taka (US$47) a month - and ensured that 
75 percent of them were the most disadvantaged 
members of those families: women. 
The classes concentrate on literacy, numeracy, and 
subjects relevant to the learners‚Äô lives. These might 
include how to: reduce sewage pollution of water 
supplies by using latrines, stave off deforestation by 
planting useful trees, and make fuel-efficient ovens 
to use less wood and reduce smoke in the house. 
There is training in skills that could bring in an 
income such as needlework, gender development 
education to secure for women a say in the running 
of the village, and leadership training to make 
community action more effective.
 ‚ÄúEducation can transform their whole life,‚Äù 
said Shuelie Aktar, 24, the local facilitator - a 
guide, rather than a teacher, who is paid 1,000 
taka a month - at the Baniyar Kandar‚Äôs Twilight 
Ganokendra, which Hira attends. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only 
important to them, it‚Äôs important to their children, 
because they will send them to school.‚Äù
There is also a strong emphasis on social 
mobilization on issues such as education rights, 
fighting child trafficking and child marriages, and 
anti-drugs awareness and support work.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt just give literacy only,‚Äù said Shuelie 
Aktur, who has a master‚Äôs degree in management.  
‚ÄúWe also provide cultural programmes and micro 
credit. Members make regular savings and from the 
central fund created they give loans to members to 
help them rear poultry, do tailoring or other small 
business activities.‚Äù
At the heart of the literacy is flexible and co-
operative learning and the creation of literature that 
Ganokendra members think will be useful once they 
can read. 
Inside the Baniyar Ganokendra, which is now 
housed in a building built by the local community, 
the walls are covered from ceiling to floor in 
awareness posters and charts related to local issues.
About 15 women are practising reading exercises, 
such as completing word-making matrices, in their 
activity books. They are arranged in three groups 
according to their reading grade - five grades, A 
to E, which are determined every month. Grade 
A students can read a newspaper. Each of the 
low-grade groups are assisted by a member from a 
higher grade, who helps learners with any text they 
can‚Äôt understand.
Fatema Khatun, 55, wearing a faded green shawl 
and cheeks full of laughter lines, didn‚Äôt go to school 
when she was a girl because of the social taboos. 
But she is an enthusiastic learner.
‚ÄúThis Ganokendra has taught us lot of things. 
Now we can take care of our health and I‚Äôm an 
expert in making and using the unnatachula (a fuel-
efficient oven with a chimney drawing the smoke 
out through a hole in the wall). I teach the others 
how to make them.‚Äù
She said in an earlier adult education centre 
the whole class was taken by one teacher and the 
textbooks were too dominated by pictures and were 
too easy, but now they have group teaching.

Rajapur village, who

business after 
receiving training 
from the Ganokendra.

 literacy
in communities
A literate environment
At their Dhaka headquarters 
the Ahsania Mission maintains a 
library of more than 200 books it 
has published for new literates 
in the villages on a range of 
topics. These include legal rights, 
such as the benefits of marriage 
registration and how to go about 
it; tree plantation; child health 
care; embroidery patterns for 
dress-making; story books; 
biographies; comics; cookery 
books and a popular book on how 
to avoid ‚Äòbad hair days‚Äô using 
herbs and natural ingredients 
such as tamarind root paste. 
There is also a collection of 
posters and literacy games tied to 
development issues, for instance 
a snakes and ladders game in 
which you throw dice to progress 
along squares on a board, but 
might slide backwards if you land 
on one saying ‚Äúfall ill after taking 
food without washing‚Äù or leap 
ahead by landing on one saying 
‚Äútake iodised salt, free yourself 
from goitre‚Äù.
A database of the titles and 
contents (www.ahsania.org.blrc) 
is being linked to UNESCO‚Äôs Asia 
Pacific Cultural Centre, so that 
NGOs across the region can share 
ideas for materials.
The books are graded to 
match different learner abilities. 
Ganokendra members can 
borrow them for nothing, though 
many centres charge two taka to 
generate funds to plough back 
into the community activities.
The startling result is the 
creation of a literate environment 
in the villages, the lack of which 
has been a major cause of lapsing 
literacy among adult learners in 
other programmes. Without books 
and posters and signs, literacy 
may never be used in daily life 
and can be forgotten.
‚ÄúWe are the largest producer 
of easy to read books,‚Äù explains 
Eshanur Rahman, deputy director 
of Dhaka Ahsania Mission. 
‚ÄúEven BRAC (Bangladesh Rural 
Advancement Committee), the 
largest NGO in the world, uses 
our books.‚Äù
Her grade D group is being helped by a grade C 
16-year-old schoolgirl Somtto Bhan, who says it 
gives her good practice in reading. 
For Somtto the real attraction of the Ganokendra 
is the range of literature it gives her access to, 
including different types of books and newspapers. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of things to learn in them,‚Äù she said.
This is perhaps the unique contribution of the 
Dhaka Ahsania Mission‚Äôs Ganokendra work, which 
is based on a Community Learning Centre concept 
promoted by UNESCO throughout Asia and the 
Pacific over the past decade. Government adult 
literacy projects have been criticized in the past for 
using texts suited to urban middle class learners that 
don‚Äôt relate to life in rural areas.
Radical projects such as the Reflect programmes 
inspired by ActionAid (see next story) use crude 
self-made texts, which are mainly representations of 
villagers‚Äô analysis of various problems they face. 
But Dhaka Ahsania has found a third way, 
by creating a national resource centre that can 
respond to local interests. The subjects are chosen 
in response to surveys carried in the rural villages 
and are tested on pilot groups before being mass 
produced.
Most of them are information books geared to 
awareness campaigns or particular skills or fields of 
knowledge that Ganokendra members say they want 
to know more about. But, crucially, they are not

written as dry manuals. Instead the information is 
imparted through stories about people carrying out 
the same tasks, making them an enjoyable read.
Across Bangladesh more than 50,000 of the 
poorest people will this year be using Dhaka 
Ahsania Mission self-learning guides to learn how 
to read and write. After a five-month course and 
one month reinforcement learning at one of 800 
Ganokendras, they will reach out for the books, 
skills training and small-scale credit that will help 
them improve life in their community.
A crucial factor in the success of the centres is 
that each one is run by a committee of members 
and comes together to discuss issues concerning the 
whole village.
A survey of Rogaghurampur, a 100-household 
village of 450 people in Jessore district, where 
63 families had been active members of the 
‚ÄúIn the early days, 
many of the women who 
returned home late 
from classes were beaten. 
Now attitudes have 
changed completely.‚Äù
Ganokendra since 1998, has documented the 
dramatic changes since the centre began its work 
(see table, far left).
By December 2002, the percentage of families 
using literacy had more than doubled from 30 to 65, 
the number using latrines and fuel efficient ovens 
had soared; the practice of marrying children off at 
13 or younger had been wiped out with expected 
knock-on effects on the number and spacing of 
pregnancies; the role of women in decision-making 
and earning an income had been completely 
transformed and the percentage of girls going to 
school had jumped from 30 percent to 100 percent.
The same kind of records have not been kept in 
Baniyar Kandar, but Hira‚Äôs new 60,000 taka home 
is just one example of the village-wide changes that 
have taken place. 
Hira built up a steady pile of savings from sewing 
work she developed at the Ganokendra and with 
the help of a loan was able to replace the mudhut. 
The spacious rough red-brick bungalow, complete 
with a brand new corrugated iron roof, has a broad 
verandah overlooking the courtyard where a carpet 
of pulses has been laid out to dry.
In her bedroom the sleeping mat has been 
replaced by a wooden-framed double bed with 
a futon-style mattress and brightly coloured 
cushions. Poster adorn the walls and on the covered 
sideboard, in pride of place, is a television. Eighteen 
poor families in Baniyar Kandar now have a house 
like Hira‚Äôs and 100 have a television.
But perhaps more significant is the ebullience 
and confidence of the women of the village, 
characterized by the fact that Hira did not have to 
think twice about inviting a group of outsiders to 
look around her family compound. Through her 
use of literacy she has liberated herself from the 
constraints of male-dominated traditions, as well as 
from many aspects of poverty, and now her husband 
asks her to borrow books for him to read.
‚ÄúIn the early days, many of the women who 
returned home late from the classes were beaten. 
Men didn‚Äôt think we should leave the house for 
anything,‚Äù said Hira.
‚ÄúBut now attitudes have changed completely. 
The status of women has been raised a lot. Now if 
someone says your wife needs to go for training in 
Dhaka, the husband will gladly agree.‚Äù

 literacy
in communities
Their 
weapons 
are home- 
made 
aps, 
matrices 
and flow 
charts
Thirty four villagers have gathered on a 
rug laid on the dusty earth in front 
of a thatched mudhouse in Bubel village, in drought-
prone Orissa, eastern India. The women‚Äôs leader, 
Jangyabata Suna, rouses them from the fatigue of a 
day‚Äôs labour with a song about taking on the money 
men. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt pay off all the bribes they demand 
of us, but we must stand on our own two feet,‚Äù 
she sings. ‚ÄúRise up poor people of our country, we 
should not have to live like this.‚Äù
It is a revolutionary movement, but their weapons 
are not the forks and cudgels of peasant revolts: they 
are homemade maps, matrices and flow charts, used 
to  campaign for justice. 
These are ‚Äúuntouchables‚Äù or poorest-caste people 
who by tradition are shunned by  other castes and 
forced to live in a separate quarter of the village. 
They used to accept their lot with grim fatalism, 
until a new type of development and literacy 
programme began in Bubel. The programme is 
called Reflect and is being run by NGOs, ActionAid 
and the India Rural Reconstruction Movement. The 
technique, which is being used by 350 organisations 
in 60 countries involves villagers analysing and 
taking collective action against the causes of their 
poverty. In the process literacy is taught and used 
as a key tool. it is the most radical example of the 
new thinking in adult literacy. The learning is geared 
very specifically to an immediate use they have for 
it. Here this means challenging officials who have 
exploited their illiteracy in ways that have kept them 
poor.
‚ÄúThe literacy activity starts with the development 
of the people‚Äôs own plans in a way that demystifies 
the power of literacy,‚Äù says David Archer, head of 
education at ActionAid, ‚ÄúThat shows it can be used 
meaningfully by people to assert their voices.‚Äù
Typically a village facilitator helps create charts 
and matrices examining how a chosen issue affects 
participants. A village map, for instance, can be 
drawn in the soil with berries representing each 
person in each home, then copied, so that the

illiterate group members get used to the idea of 
encoding and representation used in writing.
The facilitator then helps them analyze the key 
words from the discussion, breaking them down 
into syllables and looking at what other words 
could be made with these syllables. In Bubel the 
villagers went straight from planning to taking 
action, picking up literacy where it is useful as an 
aid on the way. But the ability to record information 
and read govenment documents are time and again 
proving critical in challenging local politicians and 
institutions to give them aid they are entitled to.
Dhekel Singh Mona, the facilitator rolls out a map 
on the rug which depicts each road and house in the 
village and other buildings and services in coloured 
felt pen. One by one the villagers tell me how they 
have used literacy to claim their rights.
‚ÄùBefore we didn‚Äôt know what we should know,‚Äù 
says group member Ayli Mona. ‚ÄúDay by day we 
came across new things, became aware of the 
outside world and what we should be getting - and 
now we are fighting for these things.‚Äù
By drawing up the map and carrying out a survey 
of the 284 households in the village they found 
out which families were prone to suffering periods 
of great hunger when drought sets in. Using these 
figures they persuaded every family in the village 
to set aside a bowl of rice each day as a food 
contingency and have created a seed bank to help 
families whose stocks are wiped out. ‚ÄúWe have 
drought every year, but now whoever is needy we 
are giving it to them,‚Äù explains Jangyabata. 
The survey showed that the 
102 families listed as below 
the offical poverty line and 
qualifying for ration cards 
were not all the poorest. A 
local politician had been 
handing out favours at the 
expense of those genuinely 
in need. By presenting 
their findings to the village 
assembly, they ensured 
deserving villagers could buy 
rice at a reduced price.
A bigger battle was 
fought over the issuing of 
food supplies by the Public 
Distribution System after a 
serious drought two years 
ago, when the villagers found 
there was no grain for them at 
the local distribution point.
A group of the women 
members went to protest to the panchayat 
(parish) leader, at one point setting on him in their 
desperation. When he claimed there was no grain, 
they took the matter to the Block (local district) 
Development Office, demanded access to the grain 
store records and found that grain had arrived in 
their name during the two months that they had 
been denied it, but had been falsely signed for. 
Now they are pursuing a case of corruption and 
demanding compensation.
LITERATE WITHIN TWO YEARS
Other Reflect groups are involved in conducting 
audits of how aid is spend in their community.
A strength and weakness of the Reflect method 
is the heavy reliance on the capabilities of the 
facilitators, who meet regularly to share ideas and 
discuss issues that need wider mobilization.
They are supplied with specialist materials such 
as a picture booklet about the rights of migrant 
workers, pamphlets about the rights of non-timber 
forest producers, a booklet on local government 
structures. 
Independent evaluation of pilot Reflect 
programmes in Bangladesh, El Salvador and 
Uganda, found that 60 to 70 percent of participants 
became literate within two years. This  compares to 
World Bank findings that only 12 percent of adult 
learners become functionally literate in traditional 
programmes. 
Dhekel Singh Mona carries with him a chart with 
each member‚Äôs name and a list of skills against 
which they mark their own level of achievement. 
These include being able to listen, speak in a 
meeting, speak in a meeting of outsiders, read and 
write. For instance grade two writing means being 
able to make rough notes from dictation but not 
without mistakes.
Eighteen of the group never went to school at 
all and six women can‚Äôt write their name, but that 
doesn‚Äôt stop them playing a full role because in 
meetings the literate members share the information 
with other members. 
Of 22 people listed on the chart, 15 can now read 
and write, but more significant is the use to which 
the skill is being put. Reflect member Shakan Bari 
says he forgot how to read because he never needed 
to after school, but now that documents are central 
part of their struggle in local elected assemblies it 
has become a part of his daily life.

### Slum haven
Slum haven
Schools for communities where 
children work can succeed if they adapt 
to the needs of the parents
More than 150,000 migrants live in the 
Govinpuri slums in south Delhi. 
Their homes are mainly windowless concrete 
rooms boxed on top of each other with no toilets 
or running water. They move into the city from the 
desert villages of Rajasthan and other nearby states 
to escape drought, and survive on about US$80 per 
family a month.
Government schools have not adapted to the 
needs of children in this transient community. Many 
of them work in day time - in makeshift shops, 
collecting public lavatory fees, or delivering patties 
‚Äì and may disappear when the rains return. But if 
literacy is to spread in this giant of a country, where, 
in New Delhi alone, 4.5m children live on the street 
or in slums, these problems have to be tackled.
Govinpuri‚Äôs Katha public school, set in former 
block of one-room dwellings,  is showing how 
it can be done. Walk through the school‚Äôs iron 
gates and you can see a giant children‚Äôs mobile of 
planets overhanging a narrow courtyard, night blue 
skies glistening with gold paper stars on the tiny 
classroom walls, pre-school children testing an iron 
rocking machine to its limits in a play corner, and 
a harmonium and tabla drums being squeezed and 
patted in the theatre room while students act out a 
satirical play.
The school is a haven of creativity and child 
friendly learning. It was set up by Katha, an NGO 
dedicated to promoting Hindu and tribal literature, 
and wherever possible subjects are taught through 
stories. The natural curiosity of children is what we 
encourage and the learning grows from that,‚Äù Katha 
founder Geeta Dhamarajan said.
Yet when it first opened, parents were reluctant to 
send their children to school, because they needed 
them to work or help at home. Dhamarajan coaxed 
them in by setting up parent forums, so that local 
people feel the school is really theirs, can use the

facilities and see just how good the school is. There 
is a creche so children don‚Äôt have to stay at home to 
mind their siblings while their parents work. There 
is skills training in baking, packaging and marketing 
food. Health and sanitation awareness campaigns 
help to reduce days lost through illness. And the 
school operates a shift system so children can fit in 
lessons around work if they need to.
Poor children don‚Äôt have to buy textbooks to go 
to this 1300-pupil school, because instead they use 
activity guides, peer group research and a reference 
library. Younger pupils use flashcards, games, 
singing and miming, and a colourful cartoon story 
book called Tamasha.
Having started 12 years ago, Katha is about 
to see just how good it is at competing with 
government schools. Last year, ten pupils passed 
the government‚Äôs class 12 school leaving certificate 
and six went to college. This year, 150 are sitting 
the class 10 leaving certificate and 30 are sitting the 
class 12 exam. Next year the school has asked for 
100 seats in the class 12 exam.
One award this slum school has won already, 
however, is a global laureate for information 
technology for humanity from California‚Äôs Tech 
Museum. Through a partnership with British 
Telecom and Intel and donations, Dhamarajan

secured 50 computers and designed two child 
friendly computer labs where children investigate in 
clusters. They learn to use all kinds of software as a 
by-product of mapping, surveying and investigating 
the sanitation and water supply problems of their 
own community - and designing ways to solve them. 
‚ÄúThe secret to achievement here is learning 
by doing, by exploring, by investigating,‚Äù said 
headteacher Parvinder Kaur.
So the school has gone full circle, having first 
worked hard to draw in parents, it is now sending 
out the pupils to help them solve the problems of 
their daily lives and the statistics they gather can 
be used to put the case for improvements to city 
authorities.

Basic education: 
a first in Haiti
In 1947, Julian Huxley, 
 UNESCO‚Äôs first 
 Director-General, 
declared that basic education 
is an essential part of 
‚Äúthe wider and fuller human 
understanding to which 
UNESCO is dedicated‚Äù.
The same year, UNESCO, 
at the invitation of the 
Government of Haiti, started 
a pilot project on basic 
education, the first of its 
kind, in the Marbial Valley. 
The objective was to reduce 
illiteracy and to bring 
knowledge and skills to the 
30,000 people living in the 
valley, thereby enabling 
them to improve their living 
conditions. This project was 
carried out in collaboration 
with other United Nations 
agencies, such as WHO and 
FAO.  
The global idea with the 
pilot project was to find 
ways of ‚Äúimproving the lot 
of that three-quarters of the 
world‚Äôs population which is 
under-housed, under-clothed 
and under-fed‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Haiti 
Pilot Project‚Äù, UNESCO, 1951). 
There is a clear continuity 
from this early vision to 
UNESCO‚Äôs contributions to 
the fight for eradication 
of poverty at the beginning 
of the 21st century.

SUEZ
Water for all
HRH Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud
A prince for blue gold
Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, Director-
 General of UNESCO, and 
G√©rard Mestrallet, Chairman and 
CEO of the company SUEZ, have 
signed a cooperation agreement to 
improve access to water for all. The 
agreement, signed last october 14 
at Headquarters, outlines several 
areas of action for which SUEZ, a 
global corporate leader providing 
water services in industrialized and 
developing countries, will provide 
about 300,000 euros for the first 
three years. The first concerns 
a new UNESCO initiative to 
rehabilitate the Volga-Caspian basin. 
Home to more than 60 million 
people, the basin‚Äôs environment is 
suffering from decades of massive 
industrialization and urbanization. 
Today, 42 million tons of toxic 
wastes accumulate in the basin 
every year, out of which only about 
13 percent are neutralized and 
re-used. SUEZ will contribute  to 
the UNESCO initiative financially 
and by offering expert advice in 
improving drinking water quality.
SUEZ will also help to finance 
activities in the UNESCO-IHE 
Institute for Water Education in 
Delft (The Netherlands), launched 
late last year. It will mark a new 
chapter in the development of 
the International Institute for 
Infrastructural, Hydraulic and 
Environmental Engineering (IHE), 
which is world-renowned for its 
training of post-graduate students, 
especially from developing 
countries, in all aspects of water 
management. 
The new partnership will 
also benefit the UNESCO Chair 
for ‚ÄúIntegrated Water Resource 
Management‚Äù, based in Casablanca, 
Morocco. This chair has been 
extremely active throughout North 
Africa, by working closely with 
non-governmental organizations, 
university students and journalists 
to raise public awareness about 
water governance. The company 
has also agreed to set up several 
bursaries for researchers from 
developing countries in water-
related fields.
UNESCO‚Äôs Director-
 General appointed 
HRH Prince Talal Bin 
Abdul Aziz Al Saud, 
of Saudi Arabia, as the 
Organization‚Äôs Special 
Envoy for Water on 
December 18, 2002. 
Prince Talal is President 
of AGFUND (Arab Gulf 
Programme for United 
Nations Development 
Organization), which he 
helped create in 1980 
with the support of the 
Gulf States. Since then, 
AGFUND has contributed 
more than $22 million to 
64 UNESCO projects and 
has supported more than 
740 development and 
humanitarian projects 
with diverse partners. 
As UNESCO Special 
Envoy for Water, during 
the 2003 International 
Year of Freshwater, HRH 
Prince Talal will help 
to draw the attention 
of heads of states, 
specialists, civil society 
and youth to the need 
to solve the world water 
crisis. 
‚ÄúFor almost a 
quarter of a century, 
AGFUND has focused 
its work on human 
development because 
we are convinced that 
this is the best means 
to protect against the 
risk and dangers of 
war,‚Äù said the Prince. 
‚ÄúI therefore appeal to all 
global decision-makers 
to seize the occasion 
to assure peace to all 
of the world‚Äôs peoples 
[‚Ä¶] . Under the aegis of 
peace, it is possible to 
find solutions to all of 
the world‚Äôs complex and 
chronic problems.‚Äù

Air France Foundation
Every picture tells a story
So it is for Eric Dexheimer‚Äôs
photos of street children. 
For almost a year the French 
photographer plunged into the 
world of street children from 
Fortaleza (Brazil), Paris (France), 
Ougadougou (Burkina Faso), 
Casablanca (Morocco), Manila 
(Philippines), Bucharest (Romania) 
Thi√©s (Senegal) and Cambodia, 
sharing their intimate existence.
A prize-winning photographer 
and author, Dexheimer was 
chosen for the project by the 
Air France Foundation in 
collaboration with UNESCO‚Äôs 
Programme for the Education 
for Children in Difficult 
Circumstances.  The result, an 
exhibition entitled Un enfant dans 
ma rue (A Child in My Street) and 
curated by Andre Deho, went on 
show at UNESCO Headquarters 
from November 18 to December 
6, 2002. 
Through images, texts, 
sculptures and objects, the 
exhibition presented the approach 
taken by associations and teachers 
who work with these children. 
In Burkina Faso, they help them 
to find a job or learn to dance. 
In Senegal, they go to the rescue 
of children who‚Äôve suffered 
abuse in Koranic schools and 
run away to join street gangs. In 
the Philippines and Cambodia, 
teachers help children to structure 
their lives, proposing foster 
families, setting some ground 
rules, and getting them into 
school. In Brazil, former ballerina 
Dora Andrade runs a dance school 
and centre for social integration 
(EDISCA) for children from poor 
families in the favelas of Fortaleza. 
One of their award-winning 
troops performed a contemporary 
ballet entitled ‚ÄúTwo Seasons‚Äù at 
UNESCO last November 20.
‚ÄúTo take good photographs, you 
need to understand, to get under 
the skins of the people you want 
to speak about through images,‚Äù 
says Dexheimer, who shared the 
sleeping quarters of the children 
he photographed, 
living with them 
in sewers ‚Äúunder 
the street‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt 
seemed as though 
the world was 
upside down,‚Äù 
he says. ‚ÄúA 
closed spaces. 
But the children 
welcomed me 
just as if they 
were inviting me 
into their apartment. 
I celebrated my 
birthday there.‚Äù 
Which explains 
why those working 
with these children, 
and the children themselves 
considered him one of their own.

T wenty-eight thousand 
scouts aged from 14 to 
17 years old, coming from 145 
countries, met at Sattahip in 
Thailand from December 28 to 
January 7 for the 20th World 
Scout Jamboree.
The World Organization of 
Scout Movements (WOSM), 
which defines itself as a non-
formal education organization, 
boasts 30 million members 
and is considered the world‚Äôs 
biggest youth movement. 
Closely linked to UNESCO, 
it shares the Organization‚Äôs 
ideals of universal access to 
education and peace between 
cultures.
This year, UNESCO Director-
General Ko√Øchiro Matsuura 
inaugurated the WOSM Global 
Development Village aimed 
at making young people 
aware of the world‚Äôs problems 
and some of the solutions 
proposed for solving them. A 
film on inter-cultural dialogue 
was screened and UNESCO 
hosted several workshops 
dealing with issues such 
as AIDS and 
inter-religious 
dialogue, which 
were attended by 
some 2000 young 
people 
from all of 
the world.

Isthere a link 
 between jazz and 
philosophy? Yes, say 
musicians Herbie Hancock 
and Thelonius Monk 
Jr: jazz is a universal 
language, that can be 
understood by all and 
which transmits the 
values of tolerance, peace 
and liberty. Which is 
why they enthusiastically 
accepted to become 
partners in Philosophy 
Day activities organized 
by UNESCO last 
November 21, offering 
a dazzling concert to a 
delighted audience at the 
close of a day of cerebral 
overdrive.
The musicians 
explained their presence 
to a rapt public: ‚ÄúThere is 
a generosity and respect 
in this music,‚Äù declared 
Herbie Hancock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 
also music that creates 
unity between people. It‚Äôs 
difficult to be at a jazz 
concert and not to feel 
part of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúPlaying is constantly a 
learning process,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúJazz is improvis@ed, 
that‚Äôs the key component, 
you‚Äôre constantly creative. 
This needs a lot of 
courage and tolerance 
because jazz explores new 
territories, which is not 
always easy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúJazz is the R&D 
department of western 
music, spontaneous, 
unknown, which needs 
a certain vocabulary 
and cooperation,‚Äù added 
Thelonius Monk Jr.
He explained how, 
with Hancock, they 
toured high schools in 
the US and elsewhere, 
as part of the Thelonius 
Monk Institute of Jazz, 
founded in 1986 by the 
Monk family and the late 
opera singer Maria Fisher. 
This non-profit institute 
develops introductory 
jazz programmes with 
the aim of developing 
the musical culture of 
children, encouraging 
their creativity and 
their respect for cultural 
heritage. It also offers 
college level training by 
American jazz masters 
to promising young 
musicians the world 
over. And their work 
is bearing fruit, proven 
by the performance 
that evening of the 
Thelonius Monk Jazz 
Ambassadors, a group 
of young Americans, a 
Korean, a Hungarian and 
a Brazilian, all from the 
Institute.
The president of 
the Russian 
Federation, Vladimir Putin, 
met with UNESCO Director-
General Ko√Øchiro Matsuura 
during an official visit to 
France last February 10, and 
presented him with the first 
volume of the first Russian 
edition of UNESCO‚Äôs 
History of Humanity, 
published in Moscow.
Also on the agenda of 
this third meeting between 
the two men was the 
importance of reinforcing 
the dialogue between 
cultures and civilizations, 
the rehabilitation of 
Chechnya‚Äôs education 
system and the programme 
of festivities planned for 
the 300th anniversary of 
Saint Petersburg, where Mr 
Matsuura will visit in May.

After wrestling access to the Baltic 
Sea from Sweden, Peter I ‚Äì  known 
as the Great - brought architects 
from Italy and Holland to raise an 
idealized European city from the swamps of the 
Neva River. Until the Soviet era, the city - founded 
on May 16, 1703 (May 27, according to the modern 
calendar) ‚Äì was the centre of Russian power, its 
commercial, artistic, and intellectual gateway to the 
West.
The many foreign communities established in the 
city, Dutch shipbuilders, French craftsmen, Italian 
artists, German engineers, helped shape the new 
capital‚Äôs social environment, which in turn affected 
them and their imported cultures. The Russians and 
foreigners of St Petersburg created an imperial city 
with wide avenues and canals lined with Italian 
palaces that look different for being built on Russian 
soil.
Aligned side by side, the historic buildings of St 
Petersburg offer a panorama at once diverse and 
homogeneous, with its own brand of classicism and 
baroque. The heritage of the Old City Centre and the 
many royal residences in the suburbs are inscribed 
on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage list.
As the city prepared to celebrate its 300th 
anniversary, large scale work was undertaken to 
restore the monuments of St Petersburg, which saw 
flourish some of Russia‚Äôs greatest literary talents 
(Pushkin, Gogol and Dostoievsky, to name but 
a few). Out of favour with Stalin, St Petersburg 
was largely spared the remodeling that took place 
in Moscow during the decades that followed the 
Revolution, but the city and the palaces outside it 
suffered hugely from 900 days of intense bombing 
during World War II. St Petersburg itself withstood 
the siege, but several of the palaces outside were 
occupied and reduced to a shell.
Sisyphean restoration work began immediately 
after the War and continues to this day. Impressive 
results were achieved at Peterhof and Tsarskoie Selo, 
for example. Others, like Oranienbaum - which 
were not occupied during the War, and therefore not 
as badly damaged - are in dire need of funds for 
restoration to make up for the decay caused by the 
passing of time.
As it celebrates its 300th anniversary, St 
Petersburg has much to show and share: a great 
many outstanding monuments, including the 
stupendous wealth of the Hermitage and Russian 
Museums; the acclaimed musical performances of 
the Marinsky Theatre; and the sweetness of life 
during the White Nights of summer when the sun 
does not set on the Venice of the North.

Prussia‚Äôs Frederick the Great in 
1716. One of the original panels, 
all of which were stolen when 
Tsarskoe Selo was occupied 
during World War II, was 
recently found and returned 
to the palace. The Chamber, 
painstakingly recreated according 
to old photographs with the 
sponsorship of the German 
company Ruhrgas AG, was to be 
opened in the spring, coinciding 
with St Petersburg‚Äôs anniversary 
celebration.
The main architect of the palace 
was the Italian Bartolomeo 
Rastrelli, who by 1756 created an 
architectural masterpiece, Catherine 
Palace, named after Catherine I. 
Later in the 18th century, it became 
the favourite residence of Catherine 
II who had some of the Palace‚Äôs 
original Baroque rooms remodelled 
in the classical style.

Calder: 
capturing movement
‚ÄúA mobile is [ . . . ] 
like the sea, and 
is equally enchanting, 
forever rebeginning, 
forever new.‚Äù 
Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher
On March 15, 1957, the 
committee responsible for 
the choice of artworks for UNESCO‚Äôs 
Headquarters approved the maquette 
for Calder‚Äôs mobile. Installed on 
August 22, 1958 in the Organization‚Äôs 
gardens, ‚ÄúSpiral‚Äù was inaugurated 
the following day in the presence of 
the artist. The ten-metre high work, 
made of two tonnes of black steel, 
and with five branches, dominates 
the gardens facing the avenue de 
Suffren.
Alexander Calder was born into 
a family of artists in Philadelphia 
in 1898. He invented the mobile 
as an art form.  In doing so he 
created a sculpture, of little mass 
but occupying a large space, whose 
movement changed the work at each 
instant, letting hazard play its part.
Before putting a painting to 
movement, Calder had tried during 
his first years in Paris to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù in 
three dimensions with sculptures 
of wire. The young American was 
well integrated into the artistic 
avant-garde. ‚ÄúMy entrance into the 
field of abstract art came about as 
the result of a visit to the studio 
of Piet Mondrian in Paris in 1930. 
I was particularly impressed by some 
rectangles of color he had tacked on 
his wall [‚Ä¶] I told him I would like 
to make them oscillate.‚Äù
‚ÄúMobiles have no meaning 
[‚Ä¶] They are, that is all; they are 
absolutes. There is more of the 
unpredictable about them than in 
any other human creation‚Äù said 
French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre 
of Calder‚Äôs work. 
The artist‚Äôs vision was grandiose. 
‚ÄúThe underlying sense of form in 
my work has been the system of 
the universe,‚Äù he said. For Calder, 
the idea of detached bodies floating 
in space seemed to be ‚Äúthe ideal 
source of form‚Äù. This same quest 
for the extreme can be found in the 
minimal use he made of colour. ‚ÄúI 
have chiefly limited myself to the use 
of black and white as being the most 
disparate colours. Red is the colour 
most opposed to both of these ‚Äì and 
the finally, the other primaries. The 
secondary colours and intermediate 
shades serve only to confuse and 
muddle the distinctness and clarity.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust as one can 
compose colours, 
or forms, so one can 
compose motions.‚Äù
Alexander Calder, 
1933

Not on track
Some 164 countries committed themselves two and a half years ago 
to achieving Education for All by 2015. But on present trends, more than 70 
of them may not make it
‚ÄúThis report shows that 
while, in many 
countries, good progress towards 
the goals set at the Dakar Forum 
is being made, in many others 
it is insufficent. It reconfirms 
the Forum‚Äôs diagnosis that 
almost one third of the world‚Äôs 
population live in countries 
where achieving the EFA goals 
remains a dream,‚Äù says Professor 
Christopher Colclough, an 
eminent British education and 
development expert who is also 
Director of the 2002 Education 
For All Global Monitoring 
Report: Is the World on Track?, 
commissioned and published by 
UNESCO. 
According to the Report, 
28 countries, accounting for 
over 26 percent of the world‚Äôs 
population, may not achieve any 
of the three measurable goals 
(universal primary education or 
UPE, gender equality and the 
halving of illiteracy rates) set 
at the World Education Forum 
in Dakar, Senegal (2000): Two-
thirds of these countries are in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Another 43 
countries, covering 35.6 percent 
of the world‚Äôs population, risk 
falling short of at least one of 
these three goals. 
Poor planning and a lack of 
resources are proving major 
hurdles, claims the report. 
On funding, for example,the 
Report finds that the cost of 
providing Education for All has 
been seriously under-estimated, 
largely because the impact of 
HIV/AIDS and conflict (affecting 
some 73 countries) has not been 
budgeted for. Along with bigger 
national budgets and a sizeable 
jump in external aid, the Report 
estimates that an extra 15 to 
35 million more teachers will be 
needed by 2015 ‚Äì three million 
of them for sub-Saharan Africa 
alone. 
The annual Education For 
All Global Monitoring Report 
is prepared by an independent, 
international team based at 
UNESCO in Paris (France) as 
part of the follow-up to the 
Dakar Forum, to show countries 
how well ‚Äì or otherwise ‚Äì they 
are doing, and indicating those

Notes: Official Development Assistance (ODA) consists of grants or concessional loans to developing countries.
Commitments are defined as firm obligations, expressed in writing and backed by the necessary funds, undertaken by a specific donor to provide specified assistance to a recipient country. 
Bilateral commitments are recorded as the total amount regardless of the time required for the completion of disbursements.
In the majority of cases, data for each year in a given period was available to calculate average annual commitments. Where this is not the case, average annual total and education 
commitments are calculated using the same years to ensure consistency.

As with total aid, the 
trend of bilateral aid flows 
to education has been 
downwards ‚Äì from around 
US$5 billion at the start 
of the decade to less than 
US$4 billion by 2000 (see 
table below). France, Japan, 
Germany, United States and 
United Kingdom accounted 
for between 75 and 80 
per cent of all bilateral aid 
commitments to education 
between 1990 and 2000 
(see below). With the 
exception of Japan, where 
commitments remained 
relatively unchanged, real 
commitments to education 
for the ‚Äúbig five‚Äù countries 
declined dramatically 
between the early and the 
late nineties. The United 
States, for example, cut 
its official development 
assistance for education 
by 58 percent, the United 
Kingdom by 39 percent 
and France by 22 percent. 
Even smaller donors 
slashed their education aid. 
Switzerland reduced its 
development assistance for 
education by 63 percent.

Water for People, 
Water for Life
The United Nations World Water 
Development Report
Arts and Artists 
from an economic 
Perspective
ÓÅ∑ Xavier Greffe, professor 
of Economics of Arts at the 
University of Sorbonne, in 
Paris, examines in this book 
the relationship between the 
fine arts and economics. He 
identifies the economic factors 
that can affect the emergence, 
success and disappearance of 
artistic activities, beginning with 
an analysis of the art market, 
where the players involved 
cannot be measured by standard 
economic yardsticks. He 
further explores the various 
dynamic processes influencing 
the development of the artistic 
sector: a revolving compromise 
between heritage and creation, 
a continous passage between 
an original work of art and the 
products of cultural industries 
and a constant shift between 
for-profit and nonprofit 
institutions. Greffe provides 
a way to evaluate art from 
an economic perspective that 
explains both the creation 
and development of creative 
movement without judging the 
existence of works of art purely 
in terms of economic logic.

ÓÅ∑ For the first time, 23 
United Nations agencies and 
convention secretariats have 
combined their efforts and 
expertise to produce a collective 
World Water Development 
Report offering a global 
overview of the state of the 
world‚Äôs freshwater resources. 
This first edition provides the 
foundation for subsequent 
editions. It concentrates on an 
assessment of progress since the 
Rio Summit and on developing 
appropriate methodologies. 
Its scope encompasses three 
linked components. First an 
assessment of human water 
stewardship that leads into an 
assessment of the state of the 
global water system, leading 
then to an assessment of critical 
problems. These components 
are used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of societies to 
manage water in a sustainable 
fashion.
An important output from 
this analysis is the production of 
a number of indicators of water-
related stress. They will provide 
a simple yet effective means of 
comparison between different 
regions of the world. 
In this first edition of the 
WWDR, the three-component 
analysis are applied to a 
limited set of case studies, 
supported and informed by 
previous evaluations. They will 
be extended towards global 
coverage in subsequent editions.

The Art of Living 
in Peace
Guide to education for a 
culture of peace
ÓÅ∑ In the current tense 
international context, UNESCO 
reaffirms its ideal of peace. 
Providing the foundations for 
a peaceful society requires 
more than directives. It needs 
an in-depth understanding 
of values, respect for others 
and a thorough awareness of 
the importance of sustainable 
development and protection 
of the environment. Education 
for peace is a process of 
safeguarding humanity. This 
guide is aimed at both teachers 
and educators worldwide, as 
well as the public at large. 
Pierre Weil is the Rector of the 
International Holistic University 
of the City of Peace Foundation 
in Brasilia (UNIPAIX). He has 
elaborated a transdisciplinary 
programme for peace education. 
UNESCO has contributed to 
the spread of the method, 
successfully used for more than 
ten years in several countries 
throughout the world and has 
lost none of its relevance.

World Heritage
The notion of heritage 
explained to younger 
generations
ÓÅ∑ Not only wars, but also 
pollution, the destruction of 
forests, galloping urbanization, 
mass tourism‚Ä¶ nearly all 
aspects of the modern world, 
if not controlled, threaten to 
endanger the natural, cultural 
and intangible heritage of 
peoples everywhere. A short

ÓÅ∑ Research into Islamic science 
and technology is still in its 
early stages, but there is now 
sufficient material available for 
a preliminary study. Volume IV 
of this series is intended to fill 
a gap which deserves a major 
multi-volume work.
Part I is a review of the history 
of science in Islam. It deals 
with the contribution of Islamic 
civilization to mathematics, 
astronomy, and physics, which 
have long been acknowledged, 
but also advances made by 
Muslim scientists in the fields 
of cosmology, geology and 
mineralogy, zoology, veterinary 
science and botany.
Part II deals with agricultural 
science, alchemy, chemistry 
and chemical technology, 
mining and metallurgy, 
military technology, textiles 
and manufacturing industries, 
mechanical technology, civil 
engineering, navigation and 
ship-building, medicine and 
pharmacy. Historians of Islamic 
science tend to limit their studies 
to the period up to the 16th 
century, but Part II also deals 
with the continuation of science 
and technology in the Ottoman 
Empire, India and Iran.
