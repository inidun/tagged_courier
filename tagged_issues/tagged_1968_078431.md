Gateway to 33 million divinities
This colossal mountain of sculptured stone, 52 metres high, on which innumerable figures
and forms appear to be ascending heavenwards, is a monumental gateway, or gopuram, at
the temple in Madurai (southern India) dedicated to Meenakshi, one of the wives of the Hindu
god Siva. Meenakshi was the daughter of King Pandya from whose dynastic emblem, the
fish, she took her name, signifying "eye of the fish." Assembled on richly sculptured
temple buildings is the entire Hindu Pantheon of 33 million divinities. Built between 1560
and 1680, the Temple of Meenakshi covers 240 metres by 250 and has nine gateways and
two sanctuaries adorned with remarkable sculpture. It is repainted every 60 years (see p. 28).

SPECIAL NOTICE
This issue of the UNESCO COURIER (June 1968) is published
with considerable delay because of the widespread printing and
postal strikes which affected France during the months of May and
June. The strikes seriously affected our Paris printers which
remained closed during this entire period. We ask our readers'
indulgence for these delays which have also prevented our lan¬
guage editions printed outside of France from being serviced
from Paris.
In order to permit the UNESCO COURIER gradually to re-establish
its normal production schedule, it has been found necessary to
date the next number JULY/AUGUST. This issue, which will be
devoted to the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, will contain an
additional 16 pages.
Our regular annual double number, usually dated August/Septem¬
ber, will appear this year as SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER, and will be
devoted to the Meiji Cultural Revolution and the Modernization
of Japan. It will contain 68 pages plus eight pages in full colour.

These colossal stone figures (above, on
Easter Island in the central Pacific; right,
at Tula, Mexico) are impressive monuments
to two ancient civilizations, unknown or
unappreciated for centuries but now
treasured as part of the rich cultural
heritage of both countries. On Easter
Island the Chilean Government is launching
a vast programme, in co-operation with
Unesco, of archaeological research,
monument restoration and tourist
development (see map page 8). The island
has about 150 ancient stone platforms on
which there are from one to 15 statues.
Until 1960, the seven shown here, each
over four metres high and weighing 15 tons,
were half burled in the earth. The Island
will be systematically explored by
archaeologists for further remains that will
throw light on its early history. Ninth-century
basalt figures (right) from Tula, ancient
capital of the Toltecs, central Mexico, once
supported the roof of a temple dedicated to
the planet Venus. Exploration of Toltec
remains began only 30 years ago.

He formerly taught in the Department of

elsewhere in thousands of others of
equal or lesser importance, has been
a matter of chance, but today threats
to the existence of all sites and monu¬
ments are steadily increasing.
Even in the past, for varied reasons,
efforts were made to preserve histor¬
ically and artistically important sites
and monuments. Their continued
existence served to inspire and contri¬
bute to the development of later civil¬
izations.
During the 14th Century, for exam¬
ple, the Italian Renaissance derived
much of its inspiration from Classic
Greece and Rome. The rise of human¬
ism which resulted eventually contri¬
buted to the climate leading towards
the voyages of discovery and an inter¬
est in science, thus changing the
history of the world. Subsequent
discoveries of the past, Pompeii and
Herculaneum, Ancient Egypt, Mycenae,
Babylon and Nineveh, and of the
"lost" cities in tropical forests in
Yucatan, Cambodia, and elsewhere
stimulated imagination.

Early archaeologists were partially
motivated by curiosity and were par¬
tially treasure hunters. The measure
of their success was the amount of
material they could find which could
be sold to collectors, or accumulated
for museums.
Many objects were, of course, in
fragmentary condition and brought
less on the market. The restorer, part
craftsman, part forger, then carried
out his trade. Parts of different statues
were assembled together and breaks
skilfully concealed. Pottery fragments
were sawn apart and reassembled
to make wholes, fakes were made and
sold to the credulous and some were
so skilful that even experts were
taken in.
At the same time, even when legiti¬
mately found, many objects which had
lain undisturbed for centuries began
to disintegrate upon exposure to air
and the restorer also applied his skills
to arrest such changes.
Interest also developed in the
conservation of sites and monuments.
In France, Vio!let-le-Duc (1814-1879)
initiated programmes for the conser¬
vation of national monuments, particu¬
larly of the medieval period, and was
responsible for the restoration and
reconstruction of the Cathedral of
Notre-Dame and other Gothic master¬
pieces as well as of assemblages of
historic buildings, and towns such as
Carcassonne.
However, at this early date archi¬
tects frequently replaced missing ele¬
ments some of which had not even
existed in the historic building and
the amount of rebuilding frequently
resulted In a monument "as good as
new" if not "better" than the old.
A counter movement developed,
partially based on romanticism, to
preserve the appearance if not to
enhance the look of age of objects
of art and of monuments. Again a
reaction occurred against such decep¬
tive practices, and during the early
20th century, restorers instead of
renewing the old or faking the
appearance of age separated the old
from the new by restored areas so
that pottery, statuary or buildings all
had a patched look.
Today, a compromise is usually
sought where the restored sections
blend in with the old, but close inspec¬
tion reveals the restored areas. Care¬
ful records of restoration are also the
rule, amply documented with photo¬
graphs for the use of the scholar and
the specialist.
The manner of presentation is,
however, only one aspect of restora¬
tion. Sites and monuments, as with
all material things, are subject to
change and degradation. Objects
which are recovered from archaeolog¬
ical excavation may have rested for
centuries in a very stable environment.
Upon exposure and perhaps transport
to a new environment, the object or
the monument is once more subject
to diurnal and seasonal changes of
temperature, humidity and, in tempe¬
rate zones, the action of frost.

### Saving our heritage in stone: a world-wide challenge
SAVING OUR HERITAGE (Continued)
The bulldozer in the path of history
As a result, exfoliation, or flaking
of stone and brick surfaces takes
place. Wood and other organic mater¬
ials are even more friable, and what
may appear to the inexperienced eye
to be solid when first found, rapidly
shrinks, warps or crumbles after
recovery.
Natural processes of the conversion
of stone to soil, such as the action
of moulds and bacteria, the growth
of roots of woody plants, also contri¬
bute to the destruction of sites and
monuments. Added to this are the
effects of the atmosphere. Free
oxygen and naturally occurring gases
such as carbon dioxide (which forms
carbonic acid with rain water) all
contribute to the process of weather¬
ing.
A new dimension has been added
with industrialization however. The
combustion of fossil fuels has added
a host of other compounds which
are not only deleterious to human
health, but also attack stones, wood,
glass and other building materials.
Solutions of nitrous and nitric acids,
of sulphurous and sulphuric acids,
diluted though they are, react with
the compounds making up the mate¬
rials used in construction. Limestone
and marble, sandstone and other soft
stones, wood and other organic mater¬
ial used for building purposes reveal
the results of atmospheric contamina¬
tion. With time even the more resis¬
tant materials are subject to attack.
s<
6
JOCIAL and economic
forces also affect the scene. Warfare
is a conspicuous cause for destruction,
but more insidious and equally if not
more dangerous to our cultural
heritage are all of the many elements
which contribute to material progress.
The roar of bulldozers, the crash
of wreckers at work, mark the dis¬
appearance of many historically or
artistically important buildings, as they
remove old neighbourhoods, to be
replaced by the still waters of an
impounded lake, a broad highway, or
the impersonal frontage of a glass-
sheathed multi-storied office building
or apartment house.
Monuments and sites, officially pro¬
tected by the State, may survive as
lonely archaisms within a complex of
modern buildings with all sense of
their scale and importance lost.
Squares which were once designed
to set off public buildings or served to
enhance the prestige of important
families and trading houses are now
filled with motor cars and serve as
car parks. The rumble of lorries, the
passage of trams or large buses
provoke vibrations which also contri¬
bute towards the deterioration of old
buildings not designed to meet such
stresses.
Since the end of World War II there
has been a tremendous rise in indus¬
trialization and in population. Changes
have been 'taking place oh an
unprecedented scale and never as
before has our cultural heritage been
so menaced. Inevitably Unesco's
programme for the conservation of
cultural property has been influenced
by this threat, and over the coq'rse
of years a coherent programme has
been developed.
Perhaps the firsj: Unesco interna¬
tional project of importance in this
field was the sponsorship of the "In¬
ternational Convention on the Protec¬
tion of Cultural Property in the Event
of Armed Conflict", adopted at the
Hague in 1954 and now ratified by
57 Member States.
Other international instruments
include Recommendations of the
General Conference to Member States
on: international principles applicable
to archaeological excavations, adopted
in 1956; safeguarding the beauty and
character of landscapes and sites,
adopted in 1962. A Recommendation
on "the preservation of cultural
property endangered by public and
private works" is to be submitted to
the General Conference in November
of this year for adoption.
In 1950 an earthquake destroyed
much of the ancient Inca and Spanish
Colonial capital of Cuzco in Peru and
a team oT experts was sent to advise
on a programme of reconstruction
the first Unesco project to aid a mem¬
ber state in conservation. Subse¬
quently the despatch of experts,
awards of fellowships and equipment
became part of the regular programme
of Unesco.
<
Missions were undertaken to exam¬
ine and recommend treatment on the
stones of Persepolis, on the preser¬
vation of the mural paintings at Bon-
ampak in Mexico, on the problems
of the desalinization of Mohenjo-Daro
in Pakistan, on the preservation of the
tesserae making up the mosaics found
in Morocco, on restoring statuary in
Libya, on the restoration of monuments
in Afghanistan, on factors contributing
to the deterioration of the stones in
the Borobudur monument (see p. 23),
on the restoration of frescoes in
Yugoslavia, on problems of the pre¬
servation of the wall paintings of the
Thracian tomb at Kazanluk in Bul¬
garia (see page 35), etc.
Since January 1965, Unesco conser¬
vation and restoration missions have
been sent to 33 countries (see world
map pages 8-9).
These missions have underlined the
Palace guards advance in
serried rank in this striking
te!ephoto picture of one
of the famed stone friezes
at Persepolis, 2,500 years
ago the capital of the
Achaemenian rulers of the
Persian Empire. Over
the years each successive
king added some new
edifice to the splendid
ensemble of palaces and
adjacent royal tombs (see
"Unesco Courier",
December 1966). Modern
Iran sees in Persepolis the
continuity of its national
heritage, and conservation
of its monuments (and
in some cases their
restoration) has a high
priority in Iran's
programme to "safeguard
historic and cultural
treasures, now being
carried out in co-operation
witch Unesco. Under this
programme, at Persepolis
itself," excavations and
conservation work are now
being carried out by an
Italian mission led by
Professor Giuseppe Tucci
of Rome.

fact that today conservation and
restoration are vastly different from
the type of work carried out during
the 19th and early 20th century.
Major scientific laboratories exist de¬
voted to the analysis of factors lead¬
ing to the deterioration of building
materials, paints used, identification
and the best type of treatment against
attacks of moulds and fungi, and a
whole host of synthetics now exist for
the consolidation and repair of cultural
property.
The data is so great in quantity
that one of the most important func¬
tions of the International Centre for
the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property in
Rome (established by Unesco in co¬
operation with the Government of Italy
with 34 Member States), is to act as

a clearing house for this sort of infor¬
mation as otherwise even the spe¬
cialist cannot keep up with the flood
of information and new products.
The results of the missions under¬
lined the need for improved training
facilities since the number of trained
personnel is far below the required
level and new projects are now under
way to meet this need (1).
The reports of the experts served
as a basis for "first-aid" action. In
(1) The Rome Centre, in co-operation with
the University of Rome, now has a course
to train architect-restorers. A training labor¬
atory is being planned for 1969-1970. Two
non-governmental organizations have worked
closely With Unesco in the programme for
the enhancement of sites 'and monuments,
including the recruitment of experts. They
are the International Council of Monuments
and Sites and the International Union of
Official Tourist Organizations.
some instances national services were
started, whose staff were trained as
a result of Unesco missions and the
co-operative effort of bilateral aid.
Nevertheless, the effect was piece¬
meal, for whenever a meaningful pro¬
gramme was discussed the sums
involved were so important running
into millions of dollars that most
countries could not afford to carry
out the work required. Besides, there
were many other priorities, such
as increasing food production, improv¬
ing educational facilities, introducing
industrialization, all of which would
contribute to the material benefit of
the peoples concerned.
Meanwhile, public works of vast
importance, the building of dams for
irrigation and the development of
power, the demolition of old buildings
to make place for new structures, the
replacement of old historic bridges by
new bridges capable of carrying
several lanes of automobiles continued
apace.
The decision of the United Arab
Republic to construct the High Dam
near Aswan was one of hundreds of
similar decisions. However, the Nu¬
bian-area of the Nile was marked by
many sites and monuments including
the rock-cut temple built by Rameses
II at Abu Simbel.
In 1959 the United Arab Republic,
followed by the Republic of the Sudan,
requested the aid of Unesco in under¬
taking an extensive programme of
salvage archaeology, and the transfer
of several monuments, including the
possibility of saving the temples of
Abu Simbel.
Unesco agreed and, in answer to

Ouro Preto, etc. (See article page 12).
Three Unesco missions 1966, 1967.
a world appeal in 1960, twenty-four
countries sent teams of archaeologists
which methodically excavated the area
to be submerged. Twenty temples
were transferred and sufficient contri¬
butions received to pay for the cost
of cutting up and re-assembling Abu
Simbel. Unesco is now planning the
salvage of the Temples of Philae,
located between the High Dam and
the. Aswan Dam.
A second dramatic incident happen¬
ed. On November 4, 1966, while
Unesco's General Conference was
meeting in Paris, floods occurred in
Italy, devastating large areas of
Tuscany and Venetia, and submerging
much of the older sections of Florence,
and also the city of Venice. The
dramatic- danger to the works of art in
Florence and to the architectural
treasure of Venice aroused the im¬
agination of the world. On behalf of
Unesco's General Conference the
Director-General launched an inter¬
national campaign for the two cities
and the surrounding areas.
The success of the Nubian Cam¬
paign, the world-wide interest in Flor¬
ence and Venice, strongly affected
Unesco's programme. It demonstrat¬
ed that the peoples of the world are
alive to, and are prepared to respond
to, programmes for the conservation
of our material cultural heritage. The
experience gained also showed that
Unesco, with the support of such
interest, was capable of enlarging its
role and responsibility.
0 NE of the unlooked for
results in the Nubian Campaign was
the rise in tourism in Nubia. Formerly,
only the most adventurous visitor and
the scientist went there. Today fast
hydrofoils, new hotels, and other
services enable thousands to go to
Nubia and as a result there has been
a considerable improvement in the
overall economy of the region.
Coincidentally, constant improve¬
ment in means of travel, increased
leisure, and the ability of people to
afford visits to distant places they had
read of and which, had excited their
imagination, has resulted in a tremen¬
dous growth in tourism. In the so-
called "developed" countries where
tourism is a well established industry
it is by no means a negligible factor.
In the United Kingdom it has been
rated as the fourth most important
industry in the "export" trade and the
biggest dollar earner for several
consecutive years. In other countries
tourism has become the first industry.

### Saving our heritage in stone: a world-wide challenge
megalopolis can teach us
This has meant that those countries
which have important sites and monu¬
ments, or have communities preserv¬
ing traditional styles of architecture
illustrating a way of life which may
have disappeared or is undergoing
rapid change, now can consider them
to be economic assets instead of
costly encumbrances slowing down
progress.
While tourism tends to be seasonal
but patterns are changing so that
all-year tourism is gradually becoming
a reality a number of secondary
effects or fall-out results from invest¬
ments made for tourism. Highways
and airports, besides making sites and
monuments accessible, open new mar¬
kets for local farmers and industry.
New sources of employment result
from the different service industries
such as hotels and restaurants. The
introduction of electricity and mo¬
dern communication also offer
employment for skilled labour and
trained technicians.
I N countries including Iran,
Peru, Indonesia, and many others, this
has meant that the Department of
Antiquities, formerly understaffed,
poorly equipped and lacking a meaning¬
ful budget, is now sustained by the
Ministry in charge of Planning or of
overall Economic Development Pro¬
grammes. Instead of being a "luxu¬
ry", conservation is now becoming, as
it should be (for moral and ethical as
well as economic reasons) a necessi¬
ty. Three patterns are beginning to
develop:
1. Among countries able to finance
such programmes independently, as
one of several other programmes for
the development of their economy,
Unesco's contribution would be either
through its Programme of Participa¬
tion or through the use of funds from
the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme in the form of experts and
fellowships.
2. In some countries, in addition to
missions of experts and fellowships,
Unesco has helped to negotiate inter¬
national financing loans from banks.
3. In some instances there is also
a possibility to develop a project
involving the United Nations Deve¬
lopment Programme and other Specia¬
lized Agencies of the United Nations
such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization, International Labour
Organization, World Health Organi¬
zation and the International Civil Avia¬
tion Organization In which all of the
different elements contributing to
tourism such as the construction of
highways, airports, changing agricul¬
ture pattern, the training of staff, etc.,
can be carried out co-operatively.
The difference between the present
Unesco programme and that of the
past is one of scale. In the case of
Iran, the Government has recently
decided upon a budget of $80 million
for a programme to develop the
infrastructure required (hotels, high¬
ways, etc.) of which over $4 million
will be for the conservation and
monuments including:
in northern Iran: the famous funer¬
ary mosque of the Mongol sultan
Oljaitu Khodabendeh at Soltanieh and
the 11th-century Oara Kilissieh church
at Maku;
in Isfahan: the Jumai mosque and
the Maidan e Shah (Royal Square);
in the province of Fars; the palaces
of Firouzabad and Sarvestan and the
Oala-ye-Dokhtar, or "Castle of the
Daughter".
In turn Unesco will contribute,
through the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme, experts required for
planning and consultations and will
be responsible for the co-ordination
of the different elements involved.
The possibility of the conservation of
sites and monuments as part of an
overall tourism development pro¬
gramme to be financed under the Uni¬
ted Nations Development Programme
and possibly the Banks, is under con¬
sideration in Peru and several other
member states of Unesco. In these
countries the overall budget will also
be substantial and emphasize that the
preservation and the development of
sites and monuments as tourist attrac¬
tions is being considered as central to
programmes which will stimulate the
overall economy.
In countries where tourism is just
beginning to have an effect or where
there is a real potential for its develop¬
ment, a government may be prepared
to invest in the conservation of monu¬
ments and to establish the legislation
and services required to ensure the
investments made. The problem,
paradoxically, may be more serious in
countries from which the experts have
been recruited and where national
legislation and services have existed
for a number of years.
The size of the staff and the budget
at the disposal of the different ser-
. vices are, all too frequently, still
based on requirements of the first
half of the 20th century. Demo¬
graphic, social and economic changes
are taking place on such a scale and
so rapidly that unless the governments
concerned are prepared to adapt to
the requirements of this and the
following decades, ¡rremedia! losses
will occur.
This has been the lesson in mega¬
lopolises such as New York and
Tokyo, and similar losses are taking
place in hundreds of other major
urban centres. Land costs, traffic
requirements, the pattern of real es¬
tate taxes may outweigh tourism as an
economic factor in such large cities.
As a result modern sectors of growing
major cities throughout the world
resemble each other more than they
do the historic quarters within their
boundaries.
B UT is the multi-storied
structure, utilizing standardized ele¬
ments for look-alike buildings, the
most suitable environment for modern
man? Isn't the scale, the variety and
the uniqueness of historically or
artistically important groups of buildings
a more fitting environment for man?
These are part of the problems
involved for the future well being of
man. Too little is known about the
totality which makes up our environ¬
ment. Specialists in air pollution and
land management, biologists working
on the continental shelf, urban plan¬
ners, are all convinced that changes
are taking place very rapidly and that
measures must be taken before it is
too late. Within this totality, the
problem of the conservation of our
heritage also has its part and will be
one of the new Unesco projects pro¬
posed for 1969-1970.

### A Bold plan for cultural tourism in Brazil
A BOLD PLAN
FOR CULTURAL TOURISM
IN BRAZIL by Michel Parent
I

HE very name Brazil has
a universal fascination. It evokes
images of virgin forests, colourful,
rhythmic folklore, and a history rich
MICHEL PARENT is senior inspector of
historic monuments in France and has
special responsibility for the preservation
and restoration of historic sites. He has
worked on a plan for the creation of a
series of national and regional parks, and
has carried out special operations for the
preservation of historic monuments in Bur¬
gundy and the Paris area. He is the
author of several books on art history:
"Cathédrale de Strasbourg", "Bourgogne",
"Histoire de l'Architecture" (published by
Ed. Quillet, Paris). His other written works
include plays for the experimental theatre
and studies on scenographical research.
He recently carried out a Unesco mission
to assist Brazil in drawing up a broad
programme of restoration and protection of
its cultural resources and natura/ sites
within the ' framework of a national plan
for tourist development.
in fabulous tales of adventures and
. discovery. In a word, a tourist's
paradise.
Opposed to this vision we also
find one of the most audacious exper¬
iments in town planning in the new
capital of Brasilia, . looked upon by
many as a model for tomorrow's cities
(see "Unesco Courier", June 1961).
This is so true that people now ask
not "Have you been to the Carnival
of Rio?" but "Did you get a chance
to see Brasilia?"
None of the marvels of Brazil,
however, from its magnificent scenery
to its bold, contemporary architecture
has been decisive enough to make
tourism a major factor for the develop¬
ment of Brazil.
In 1966, Brazil could boast no more
than 100,000 foreign visitors, and of
these a fourth came from the neigh¬
bouring countries of Argentina and
Uruguay. The figure also includes
foreign travellers who come to Brazil
for business or other purposes not
directly connected with tqurism.
Even domestic tourism is extremely
limited. Brazilians from Sao Paulo or
Rio de Janeiro who can afford to
travel prefer to go to Europe, North
America or even far-off Asia instead
of trying to discover the beauties of.
their own land.
But all this may well change in the
years ahead in Brazil (as in other
parts of the world), with faster inter¬
continental air travel, lower fares, and
the overcrowding of certain European
coastal summer resorts, In contrast to
the endless ocean beaches of Brazil
offering sunshine and shade all the
year round.
But two things are necessary if
this radical change is to come about.
First Brazil must possess an adequate
network of roads and hotels without
which no real expansion in tourism

of the late 18th century. Left, head of one of the prophets, Joel, seen against a backdrop

is possible. Secondly, everything
must be done to preserve the natural
beauty and architecture of the country,
still little known abroad. At the rate
things are going now these are likely
to vanish before the rest of the world
has a chance to get to know them.
If this plan is to succeed three simul¬
taneous operations must be carried
out. One, a survey of Brazil's artistic
and natural treasures summarized in
adequate form for the tourist. Two,
administrative and legal measures to
preserve these treasures, with the
expansion of existing services to carry
them out, and the promotion of public
opinion in Brazil to support these
measures. Three, the maintenance
and restoration of the sites and monu¬
ments themselves and the develop¬
ment of their touristic possibilities.
During the past two years, at the
request of the Brazilian Government,
three Unesco missions (with the aid of
the U. N. Development Programme),
have co-operated with Brazilian spe¬
cialists in mapping out a programme
for the development of Brazil's cultu¬
ral resources within the framework of
a nation-wide plan for economic deve¬
lopment. The "overall plans for the
preservation of natural and artistic
treasures" which the Brazilian Govern¬
ment seeks to promote can only take
place if incorporated into "plans for
economic development as a whole."
But the integration of cultural deve¬
lopment into economic development
can only be accomplished by incor¬
porating economic development into
cultural development. Let me explain
what I mean. As a country's standard
of living rises we find that cultural
questions tend to occupy a greater
place in the individual's and indeed the
whole of society's leisure activities.
At least we hope so.
Too often, however, we find that
cultural matters are looked upon and
dealt with in piecemeal fashion and
rarely, if ever, viewed within the frame¬
work of an overall plan for cultural
development. The development of
theatre or music, for example, is
rarely seen in conjunction with that
of architecture or cultural monuments.
What is needed is a general plan
for the cultural development of a na¬
tion, and this should be integrated into
the broader plan for general economic
development.
Brazil, a nation endowed with
exceptional natural and cultural wealth,
could well lend itself to such' an
approach, on condition that certain
problems of general development are
solved, such as town and country
planning, improvement in communica
tions, professional training, and that
tourist facilities are provided for.
With its eight and a half million
square kilometres, Brazil is a nation
of vast open expanses. Once con¬
sidered a drawback, these empty
stretches are now a boon. Overcrowd¬
ing and lack of space are a feature of
many countries today with air and
water pollution and other incon¬
veniences that go with them. But
Brazil could accept a large increase in
its population and a sharp rise in
tourism without any difficulty.
Certain areas of Brazil, it is true,
are heavily populated while others are
witnessing what is tantamount to a
full-scale exodus. The causes are
both underdevelopment, as in Recife
and Salvador in north-east Brazil, and
overdevelopment as in Sao Paulo.
What is called for here is the decen¬
tralization of the economy, the disper¬
sal of industry and modernization of
agriculture. The growth of tourism
depends on these fundamental struc¬
tural reforms. But tourism itself can
spur economic growth and a rise in
living standards, and thereby promote
and open up new avenues ror eco¬
nomic development.
This is the background against
which we must examine the expansion
of Brazil's future tourist development.

### A Bold plan for cultural tourism in Brazil
CULTURAL TOURISM IN BRAZIL (Continued)
Reviving the glory of Brazils sumptuous mansions
14
Brazil's great attraction, apart from
a number of famous, breathtaking
sites, lies in her spectacular expanse
of territory and her 3,600 miles of
unbroken coastline. But Brazil's
natural wealth is much- more fragile
than would appear. In the past two
hundred years the tropical forest has
suffered such a gigantic onslaught
that it now represents only eight per
cent of the territory, Amazonia exclud¬
ed (Amazonia accounts for 30 per
cent; open scrub land for 62 per cent).
The remaining coastal forest belt as
well as the interior forest areas must be
preserved at all costs. On this will
depend the choice of future sites for
seaside and tourist resorts to be link¬
ed with the nation's lovely cities and
historic sites so that the two insep¬
arable facets of the Brazilian scene
nature and the arts are easily
accessible to the visitor.
When the Portuguese arrived in
Brazil in the 16th century they found,
unlike the Spaniards in Mexico and
Peru, that the Brazilian Indians had
developed no great architectural civil¬
ization of their own. In the settlements
they founded they Introduced the
European style of architecture, and
throughout the 16th and 17th centuries
the Jesuit priests were to be great
builders of churches, monasteries and
other edifices, all strongly marked by
the influence of Europe.
This was not to be the case for the
"fazendas", the great country houses
built during the "Colonial" period,
especially in the region of Sao Paulo,
which signalled the emergence of a
truly original Brazilian style.
This was followed in the 18th and
19th centuries by the eruption all over
Brazil of Baroque architecture, again
influenced by Europe but enriched,
revitalized and inspired anew by the
lush tropical vegetation and environ¬
ment. The magnificent sculptures of
Aleijadinho in particular reached a
height of mystic expressionism un¬
matched in Europe except during the
Middle Ages.
Clt would be a mistake, however, to
imagine that Brazilian art is purely
religious in nature. The era of the
rural "fazenda" architecture was soon
followed by the city "sobrado", large,
typically Brazilian mansions, several
stories high, built to form a homoge¬
neous unity. The "sobrados" are found
in many cities of north-eastern Brazil
and elsewhere, and the ones in Sal¬
vador de Bahia are particularly beau¬
tiful and striking. It was within the
urban framework of this city of art, as
well as in Sao-Luis and Olinda, near
Recife, and in the cities of Minas
Gerais, that the sumptuous Baroque
churches sprang up.
Today, the magnificent "sobrados"
have been abandoned by the upper
classes that built them (as have the
"fazendas") and have become the
most decrepit sections of each town
(as decrepit and insalubrious as the
"Favellas" of Rio de Janeiro) grimy,
over-crowded slums, neglected, falling
in ruin, or else threatened by awkward
attempts at modernization or half
measures for sanitation improvement
that do little to better the lot of the
poor who now dwell in them.
Less than fifty years ago these
sumptuous mansions were the pride
of Brazil's cities. Even today, amidst
their tropical surroundings, they stand
as some of the foremost examples of
Brazilian architecture. Steps must be
taken to make them the harmonious
settings they once were this time for
the inhabitants now living there. For
there can be no question today of
evicting them without depriving the
"sobrados" of much of their signifi¬
cance. It would obviously be unfair
to evoke their cultural and touristic
value as an excuse for removing the
sobrado-dwellers from everthing that
attaches them to their towns and
ancient districts.
In other words, tourism must be
looked upon as only one of the
reasons for the future renovation of
these ancient districts. The tourist
will then be able to take part in and
hence better appreciate the daily life
going on around him. It is in this
way that "cultural tourism" can help
to bring different peoples closer to¬
gether, not by turning these areas
into empty shells devoid of life.
B
UT here I ought to point
out that the problem of saving the
cultural heritage of Brazil's cities, and
particularly a city like Salvador de
Bahia, calls for a global policy of
urban renovation. This demands a
co-ordinated effort to restore large
sections of the big cities and even
entire small towns, not merely by
repairing the buildings but also by
modernizing the whole urban infra¬
structure (water and sewage systems,
electricity, roads, etc.).
Brazil's heritage in stone is found
not in great ruins and monuments of
past civilizations but in its living cities.
Thus its cultural heritage cannot be
divorced from the life in these cities.
This heritage draws its vitality from
popular lore and customs, from the
beliefs, rites and festivals, the music
and literature which are all anchored
in tradition and in the Brazilian pattern
of life.
In this respect Brazil is privileged
in being the meeting point of three
currents of thought and culture: In-
dianism, Africanism, and Latin Chris¬
tianity. These currents have become
so intermingled that, though they may
be discernable to the scientific eye, for
the people of Brazil they are fused
into an inseparable whole englobing
many fine shades of differences.
Just as the past fifty years have
seen the deterioration of Brazil's mon¬
uments, so the rapid modernization
and changes now taking place (and
which are of course indispensable for
the country's development) constitute
a threat to Brazil's rich traditional
heritage. Fortunately, the Brazilian
people possess great vitality and have
managed to adapt and incorporate their
traditional patterns to the new, modern
ways. Furthermore, they are adept
at adjusting modern trends to fit their
environment (as they have skilfully
done in fashion and the use of modern
fabrics) and in pioneering in moder¬
nization (as in architecture).
Despite this, Brazil's traditional tech¬
niques are in extremely grave danger
of disappearing much more so than
its monuments or its natural scenery.
If this heritage is debased to serve
only as a tourist attraction it will have
lost all authenticity and meaning. We
must not fail to realize that once
started this process is irreversible,
changing what were once techniques
and customs rooted in the life and
work of the community into "manu¬
factured objects". Steps must be
taken at once to preserve the authen¬
ticity of these traditions before it is
too late, and a programme of ethno¬
logical study needs to be undertaken
with this in mind concurrently with the
actual restoration and preservation of
Brazil's monuments.
A repository of local tradition and
arts and crafts can be built up by
such scientific studies, with the aid of
museums, and this in turn will help
to foster new interest in and support
for these traditions. The study of
traditional techniques, furthermore, is
in itself a means of preserving their
authenticity, and the imaginative use
made of them by contemporary artists
and craftsmen can prepare the way
for the universal, yet diversified, civili¬
zation of tomorrow.
Everywhere today it is important
that monuments and traditions of the
past be more closely linked to modern
life so that contemporary culture can
draw inspiration from traditional
sources. The vitality of the Brazilian
theatre, the many folk and popular
festivals that take place all over the
country enrich and give sparkle to
Brazilian life, attract foreign tourists
the year round, and promote easier
contacts between people.
It is a striking fact that Baroque
art in general and the form it has taken
in Brazil in particular stem' from this
notion of social life exalted by the
institution of the festival.
If architecture is the art of rhythm
in space, for the eye and body it has
the added function of providing rhythm
to man's life not only in his work and
day-to-day affairs but also in his
festivals and other celebrations.
Leisure activities usually take place
within a certain architectural or struc¬
tural framework, and if separated from

### A Bold plan for cultural tourism in Brazil
SPLENDOUR AND DECAY are neighbours in
the city of Salvador de Bahia (northeastern
Brazil) which boasts many hundreds of churches,
gems of architecture and decoration. The
Church of St. Francis (above) was built in the
typical Brazilian Baroque style of the early
18th century. Right, air view of the Barrio
Jésus in Bahia. Here, the Brazilian Government,
with aid from Unesco, has launched a programme
for the restoration and enhancement of an
entire section (Pillory Square) of the city's
ancient buildings and churches, as part of
a nation-wide plan to preserve and protect
monuments and artistic treasures.
this framework they often lose much
of their quality. Hence, in those
countries where traditional ways are
still alive and have not been perverted
we should see to it that all data
concerning these traditions are re¬
corded so as to encourage the devel¬
opment of contemporary forms of
culture based on them.
Brazil's gift for spontaneous festivals
has emerged within the context of its
architectural surroundings. The de¬
velopment of such festivals will cer¬
tainly help to make Brazil's architec¬
tural heritage better known, once its
buildings and monuments have been
restored to their full glory by the
preservation operations now planned.
For the tourist the attraction will be
more durable and meaningful than the
"exotic" Brazil he now finds against a
backdrop of misery and dilapidation.
The deterioration of Brazil's monu¬
ments and buildings is paralleled by
the degradation of the countryside,
deforestation, the whittling away of its
agricultural zones and the new
invasion of wild undergrowth, the
pauperization of Its citizens and the
exodus of whole populations to the
coastal areas and the large over¬
crowded cities.
Undisciplined deforestation further
accentuates this disequilibrium, and
with the weakening of the soil that
ensues, seriously hampers the devel¬
opment of Brazil's road network. The
Brazilian writer Miran do Barros Latif
has pointed out that the luxuriant
vegetation of the tropics, the profuse
flora and fauna, are so intricately
linked together that they tend to
crowd out man. It was only by sub¬
mitting to its rigid laws that man was
able originally to settle there; and
later, when European civilization did
break through, this was possible only
by continually hacking, chopping and
struggling every foot of the way
against the ever-encroaching jungle.
But the situation is quite different
in the Brazil of today, and we must
completely revise our thinking about
the relation between nature and civil¬
ization in that country. Today, both
are interdependent and call for recip¬
rocal utilization and respect.
I might add that of the technical aid
operations considered most useful for
the cultural development of Brazil, I
would place first and foremost the
assistance of soil scientists to draw
up a programme for the stabilization
of the soil if only to prevent certain
monuments from collapsing.
This would be the most effective
type of assistance since Brazil, with
its long humanistic tradition, possesses
the necessary infrastructure for its
cultural action. What is. needed is to
develop this action. The Brazilian
historic monuments and fine arts
service has a top-rate staff of archi¬
tects and archaeologists. But their
work is not yet integrated into an
overall plan for national development.
Brazil's schools of architecture must
also be equipped to train a larger
number of restoration technicians who
could then be usefully employed for
a nation-wide programme of restoration
and maintenance of historic monu¬
ments. For the various reasons outlined
above, all of Brazil's cultural activities
would gain by being strengthened and
expanded at the Federal level as the
historic monuments and fine arts
service has been.
The launching of a broad programme
for the protection and exploitation of
Brazil's cultural heritage would be no
vain enterprise. Brazil has a rich cul¬
tural life rooted in tradition and a
great thirst for science and humanism.
It may need international co-operation
to carry through its project success¬
fully but this success will be a price¬
less gift that Brazil will offer to the
whole world community.

### The Parthenon in peril
THE PARTHENON
IN PERIL
by Georges Dontas
The Parthenon is in danger. The world-famous Greek temple
is slowly disintegrating and threatened with collapse unless
urgent measures are taken to save it. Greece's archaeological
services, after a stone by stone examination of the Parthenon,
are taking steps to meet the situation. In addition, a Unesco
mission is scheduled to fly to Athens in October next
to work with the Greek authorities. Here the Director of
the Acropolis describes the present plight of the greatest
masterpiece of Greek architecture.
Trapped by a tumbled section of cornice, the
horse of Selene seems to cry aloud the
distress of the Parthenon, which today faces
new perils. The whole of the eastern pediment
(photo right) was once decorated with
sculpture by Phidias and his school depicting
the birth of Athena (the original sculpture
of horse of Selene is now in the British
Museum, London). Yet even in its ruined
state the Parthenon seems to be the very
embodiment of perfection, with its noble lines,
harmonious proportions and the purity of
its stones the smooth and close-grained
marble of Attica on which the hand of time
has gently laid a golden patina. Left, some
of the shafts of the outer colonnade. Doric
columns, each with 20 grooves, they average
10 metres in height, and have a base diameter
of 1.9 metres which diminishes to 1.5 metres
at the top. For an explanation of how optical
illusions were corrected by Greek architects,

### The Parthenon in peril
ORE than 2,000 years have
passed since the last mason picked up
his tools and left the temple of the
Parthenon, dedicated to Athena, the
patron goddess of Athens. Situated
on the high rock of the Acropolis,
the temple's fresh-hewn marble and
magnificently coloured sculptures
then gleamed in the warm Greek sun.
Today, the simple, majestic silhouette
of the temple still dominates the busy
modern city of Athens sprawled at its
feet. Across the centuries it has

resisted the ravages of time and the
many depredations of- men blind to
its immortal beauty.
Three centuries before Christ,
Demetrios Poliorcetes, King of Mace¬
donia, took up his quarters there with
his large retinue; the Christians turned
it into a church in the 6th century; the
Turks, in the 15th, into a mosque.
But the greatest disaster came in
1687: the Venetian doge, Francesco
Morosini, was laying siege to Athens,
and the Turkish army, which controlled
the city, had converted the Parthenon
into a powder magazine. In the
bombardment that ensued, a Venetian
shell hit the Parthenon and the powder
magazine exploded, slicing the Doric
temple in two and causing heavy
damage. In 1803, Lord Elgin had most
of the sculptures removed and taken
to England. They are now in the
British Museum.

Mutilated though it was, the Par¬
thenon has nonetheless remained
better preserved, for all its changing
fortunes, than many other temples of
Greek antiquity. The soaring columns
still proudly enclose what was once
the "sekos" of the goddess Athena;
part of the frieze is still in place; some
of the original sculptures on the
entablature have survived.
Yet in 1830, just after the liberation
of Greece, all that remained of the
Parthenon were two separate groups
of ruins, one to the west the other to
the east. The temple regained its
structural unity as a result of the large-
scale restoration work undertaken by
the Greek archaeological services in
the 19th and 20th centuries (especially
between 1922 and 1933).
But today the Parthenon is once
again seriously threatened. Major
restoration, however, cannot be

### The Parthenon in peril
PARTHENON (Continued)
The seven plagues that have smitten the Acropolis
envisaged without adding a large
number of new elements which would
be tantamount to what is known as
"reconstruction". And any "recons¬
truction" of an ancient monument,
even if only partial, is now condemned
as a technique except in very, very
rare cases where it is the only possible
hope of saving the structure.
There are now seven dangers
threatening the Parthenon and these
come from two sources: internal
structural deteriorations of the edifice
itself and external factors. The Greek
Archaeological Service has made
plans to try to meet both types of
danger.
First, there is the problem of the
foundations of the monument. The
Parthenon rests on a relatively soft,
calcareous stone, known as tufa, which
poorly resists long-term humidity.
Until a few years ago, the marble
flagging was missing in many places,
18
OPTICAL CORRECTION. These drawings
of the east front of the Parthenon show
techniques used by Ancient Greek
architects to correct optical illusions.
1. The temple as it appears to the
viewer; its lines seem to be perfectly
horizontal or vertical, though in fact they
are curved and inclined as in figure 3.
2. The temple front as it would appear
if it had been built as in figure 1 without
optical correction.
3. The temple as it is actually built with
vertical axes inclined inwards and with
convex stylobate, architrave, entablature
and pediment so as to produce the optical
impression shown in figure 1.

the Comparative Method" by Sir Banister Fletcher,

Ltd., London, 1948.
allowing the rain water to seep through
to the foundations and exposing the
tufa stone to a slow but inexorable
process of disintegration which under¬
mined the stability of the whole
temple. Almost all the flagging has
now been restored and sections that
have not will shortly be completed.
One of the most serious dangers
now threatening the Parthenon is the
alarming amount of wear and tear to
the horizontal flagstones caused each
year by the thousands upon thousands
of shuffling feet. This is a problem
that of course affects not only the
Parthenon itself but all the other sites
on the Acropolis, as well as the rock
platform itself. But as regards the
Parthenon, it is greatly feared that the
convex curvature of the horizontal
lines will be worn down, especially at
their point of maximum rise, unless ur¬
gent protective measures are taken (1).
Perhaps the most radical solution
would be to exclude all tourists from
the interior of the temple. Aesthetic¬
ally, the interior is now far less
impressive than the outer façades
since the Parthenon has lost the
cohesive unity it formerly had when
the original walls of the "naos" (the
principal chamber inside the temple
containing the statue of the deity)
were standing. From the naos the
visitor could not actually see the
exterior landscape through the
long rows of columns. The Greek
archaeological services are at present
considering the implications and con¬
sequences of closing the interior to
the public.
The original sculptures still in
position present another problem: how
to protect them from the ravages of
wind and weather. A few years ago,
the Greek Archaeological Service had
worked out a plan to protect the west
(1) It is well-known that the Parthenon
does not have a straight line in its archi¬
tecture. If a raised edifice is built with
perfectly straight horizontal and vertical lines
it will appear to the viewer to curve outward
and downward. To correct these optical
illusions many refinements were practised
in the great period of Greek architecture.
The Parthenon is the supreme example
of such refinements. The long horizontal
lines of such features as the architraves,
cornices, and stylobates (the horizontal base
or substructure on which the columns stand)
were formed with slightly, almost impercep¬
tible convex outlines. If straight they would
appear to the eye to sag or drop in the
middle of their length. The stylobate of
the Parthenon had an upward curvature
towards its centre of 2 61 inches on the
east and west façades, and of 4.39 inches
on the lateral façades. Similarly, the vertical
shafts of the columns were inclined inwards
towards the top to correct the appearance
of falling^ outwards and also give a subtle
convex curvature towards the bottom to
counteract the hollow appearance which
results from straight-sided columns (this latter
correction is known as "entasis"). It has
been found that in the Parthenon the incline
is such that the axes of all the columns, if
continued, would meet at a distance of a
mile above the ground.
frieze by restoring the ceiling which
originally covered the frieze on
the western façade along the
outer colonnade. The scheme was
abandoned for fear that the addition
of new blocks of marble, with their
tremendous weight, might jeopardize
the stability of the edifice.
It is now proposed to use blocks
of much lighter materials (made of
wood or plastic) and to retain the lines
of the original architecture. In the
meantime, the figures on the frieze
were consolidated a few years ago by
the use of cement, glue and other
ordinary techniques.

MASTERPIECE OF RUSSIAN ART. This 15th-
century ¡con carved in wood, long a material
used in Russian sculpture and folk arts, is from
Galitch, 400 kilometres north-east of Moscow.
It depicts Saint Paraskyeva, patroness of
women, home life and fairs, who inherited her
attributes from the ancient Slavic goddess Lada.
This remarkably well-preserved icon is now in
the Galitch Ethnographical Museum. The largest
Soviet centre for the restoration of monuments
and works of art is in Moscow. A research
institute, it was founded in 1918 by Igor Grabar,
of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, who was
also responsible, in 1949, for setting up a special
central council to develop and evaluate
techniques for the conservation and restoration
of works of art and cultural monuments.
Similar councils now exist in the 15 republics of
the Soviet Union. To take care of 10,000 historic
monuments spread over a country covering
one-sixth of the earth's surface, the U.S.S.R.
has had to train a vast number of inspectors and
specialist teams of historians, archaeologists,
architects and artisans.

ON LOOKING INTO A THRACIAN TOMB. This
mural, painted some 2,200 years ago on the
cupola of a Thracian tomb unearthed at
Kazanluk, Bulgaria, is a striking pictorial record
of the life of a Thracian chieftain in the
Hellenistic period (see page 35). The sumptuous
garb, elegant furnishings and table appointments
of the chieftain and his wife (central figures),
who as they feast enjoy the music of flute
players, exemplify the refinements attained by
this civilization in south-eastern Europe.
In upper portion of cupola, distorted by
photographic perspective, several groups of
horses are being led by grooms; mural painted
around apex of cupola depicts a chariot race.
Above it can be seen the granite cap to the
cupola. Style and quality of murals ' show they

Top, on the three upper terraces of the
great temple of Borobudur (Indonesia)
stand three symetrical rings of stupas
(bell-shaped shrines) with perforated walls,
the whole encircling a single giant stupa
(seen on right of photo). Each of the
small stupas enshrines a statue of the
Buddha in - a pose of eternal meditation.
But down the centuries many statues
have been damaged and even decapitated
by vandals. The buddha in foreground
no longer has a stupa to protect it from
the elements. Bottom, one of the 1,460
bas-reliefs covering six kilometres of
terrace walls on which unfolds the rich
imagery of Buddhist cosmology.
Encroaching mosses and lichens, erosion
and shifting of stonework, seen in photo,
threaten to destroy the entire temple.

BERNARD P. GROSLIER is in charge of
archaeological research at the Ecole Fran¬
çaise d'Extrême-Orient at Siem Reap, near
Angkor, Cambodia. As chief custodian of
monuments at Angkor, he has directed the
vast restoration and conservation pro¬
gramme at this world-famous site for many
years. This year he led a Unesco mission,
in collaboration with the Dutch geologist
Caesar Voute, to Borobudur to survey the
damage In the great temple, and elaborated
a detailed plan for rescuing it from des¬
truction. He also studied other important
sites in Central Java and has put forward
a project for their restoration and develop¬
ment. Two of his books have been trans¬
lated into English: "The Art of Indochina",
Methuen, London, 1962 (republished under
the title "Indochina" by World Publications,
New York, and Müller, London, '1967); and
"Angkor, Art and Civilization", Praeger,
New York, J 966.
I N the heart of Java, sur¬
rounded by volcanic peaks that rise
up beyond the clouds like thrones
for the gods, stands Borobudur, a
reminder to men of Buddha's eternal
message of compassion and serenity.
Borobudur was the greatest sanc¬
tuary in the world in the closing years
of the 8th century, when it was built
by the powerful Sailendra kings who
reigned over the island empire of the
Southern Seas. And to this day it
represents the climax of the extraor¬
dinary odyssey of Buddhism, which
was born in India, spread through¬
out the whole of Asia and finally dis¬
appeared from its native soil at the
very moment when its most noble
monuments were being raised in coun¬
tries where it had become the living
faith.
Perhaps no other temple is so literal¬
ly an "act of faith" as Borobudur.
From its base, 1 1 7 metres square, rise
four terraces, identical in design but
each smaller than the preceding one,
forming a pyramid. The supporting
walls of the base and those of the
rectangular terraces are covered in
bas-reliefs.
Along the edge of the walk which
encircles each terrace stands a high
balustrade decorated on both sides
with sculptures and crowned by a
series of niches containing statues of
the Buddhas, masters of the four points
of the compass.
When a pilgrim climbs the narrow
stairway between the terraces and
walks along these open-air galleries,
with nothing above him but the sky, he
is completely cut off from the outside
world and its temptations, and can
meditate more deeply on the message
carved out by the sculptor. But the
pilgrim looking up from ground-level
sees only the Buddhas, rising into the
sky as the first symbols of hope.
Once he has completed this long
spiritual journey, the pilgrim reaches
the three upper terraces, perfect
circles and entirely undecorated, on
which stand like a triple crown of
jewels the seventy-two stupas, through
whose delicate stone tracery he
glimpses statues of the Buddha in
meditation.
Crowning Borobudur is a GreatStupa,
its apex 40 metres above the ground.
Sealed, hollow and empty, the stupa
enshrines the Supreme Truth Nirva¬
na inaccessible to all since it can be
perceived only at the instant when the
Sage renounces his quest to attain it.
Step by step, the pilgrim is guided
and upheld in his spiritual quest by
this rosary of stone. The base of
the pyramid was originally ornamented
with reliefs depicting worldly desires
and pleasures. These have been hid¬
den by a second foundation of heaped-
up stones, which has never been
finished and whose purpose is still a
subject of controversy.
Some see it simply as a reinforce¬
ment made necessary, even in those
times, by an ominous subsidence of
the building. For others it is a ritual
"screen" to hide the actual evocation
of sin from the eyes of the monks,
yet reminding them of the presence of
the reliefs as symbols of the ali-
pervasive threat of evil. Another pos¬
sible explanation is that a later ruler
"reappropriated" the sanctuary, wish¬
ing to embellish and enlarge it and
thus acquire on easy terms the merit
due to the founder of such a monu-
Many such examples are to be found J -I
in Asia and I am inclined to agree
with this last explanation. Whatever
the reason, this later addition has

BOROBUDUR (Continued)
A labyrinth of stone,
figures infused with life,

24
deprived us not only of a very fine
series of sculptures but, above all, of
the original architectural design, which
was infinitely more powerful than the
one we see today. It would be no
mean achievement if a rebuilding of
Borobudur restored it to its original
majesty.
On the walls of the four rectangular
terraces unfolds the story of Gautama
Buddha, episodes from his previous
existences that were to shape his
destiny, events from the epic story of
his life. Then, for further meditation,
comes the example of the Bodhisatva
Sudhana visiting the greatest Sages,
the sublime visions of Maitreya, who
is to be the future saviour of mankind,
and finally the thirty-two Buddhas
attaining' Nirvana.
After this long journey along the
paths of self-discipline, the pilgrim
emerges transformed into the "pure
lands" of the upper terraces, a world
without form and consequently with¬
out desires. He is in mid-air. The
path he has just followed is completely
hidden from him by the subtle patterns
of the architecture, a,nd he is isolated
from the world.
A sea of light surrounds him and
his gaze encompasses the great chain
of volcanic peaks rising on the horizon.
Close at hand, yet still out of reach
in the half-light of the fretted stupas,
he can just distinguish the meditating
Buddhas. Before him, dominating the
universe, the central stupa encloses
the inaccessible truth.
A labyrinth of stone leading to sal¬
vation in an admirable synthesis of
form and image this is Borobudur: the
largest and most complete ensemble
of Buddhist reliefs in the world, un¬
surpassed in artistic merit.
The material used is andésite, a
bluish-grey volcanic rock, porous and
rough like cinders. And yet the Java¬
nese sculptors have succeeded in
carving it with astonishing dexterity.
The line is incisive and clean, even
sharp, for every tiny roughness in the
surface catches the light.
But the subtle curves of the reliefs
breathe life into the bodies and the
lips. The sculptors have noted the
smallest detail of clothing or orna¬
ment with the precision of an ethno¬
grapher. Yet the composition has
immense simplicity and grace: a few
figures skilfully grouped like a scene
from a shadow-theatre, with a tree, a
bird or a flower to suggest the setting.
The ritual and the conventional
themes of Buddhist iconography de¬
picted along these hundreds of panels
could easily have been monotonous.
But with inventive genius and limit¬
less verve, the sculptors have produc
ed infinite variations on these themes,
whose interplay of pose, gesture and
facial expression makes each scene
an individual masterpiece.
Borobudur is in all respects the
largest, the most ancient and most
beautiful monument in the Southern
Hemisphere, and ranks among the
finest in Asia: Sanchi and Ajanta in
India, Angkor Wat and the Bayon in
Cambodia; the Great Wall of China
and the Kondo of Horyuji in Japan. It
is no less the peer of the finest master¬
pieces of its kind in the West, from the
Pyramids to Persepolis, from the Par¬
thenon to the Pantheon, from Saint
Sophia to Chartres and Saint Peter's.
Yet Borobudur is threatened by
imminent and inescapable destruction.
It is true that since its rediscovery at
the beginning of the 19th century it
has been protected, notably by major
restorations carried out between 1907
and 1911. But time has revealed their
inadequacy; and the process of decay
has accelerated so much during the
last few years that Borobudur Ls
doomed unless steps are taken at
once to save it.
Built on a hilltop a far from ideal
foundation the temple consists of ter¬
raced walls built of small blocks of
stone fitting perfectly together, but
not held in place by mortar or other
forms of bonding. The inside of the
temple is simply a great hard mound
of earth, piled up gradually during the
building.
The rains, which are particularly
heavy in this equatorial climate, seep
through the joints of the façades and
especially through the paving-stones,
into the central mound and wash away
the earth. Once the earth is loosened
in this way, the walls bear down on
the weakest spots, settle and lean out¬
wards, all the more rapidly for having
to carry the weight of the balustrades.
Obviously these movements go
through the whole structure, gathering
force as they go down, like a cascade.
Today the lowest terrace is on the
point of collapse, and would have
already given way, had the Indonesian
Archaeological Service not lightened
the load on it by dismantling some of
the balustrades. Needless to say, if
the bottom terrace collapses, like a
dam, Borobudur will come down in an
appalling avalanche of earth and
sculptures.
Not only is the structure of the
building threatened in this way, but
also the finely-chiselled ornamenta¬
tions. The water seeping through into
the inner mound cannot flow away
naturally into the earth and tends
therefore to rise again and evaporate
through the joints, and even through

Borobudur, undoubtedly the largest and
most significant monument in the
Southern Hemisphere, was built 1,100
years ago around a hilltop in
Central Java. It has been calculated
that tens of thousands of labourers,
craftsmen and artists must have
worked for scores of years to hew,
transport and place in position its
two million cubic feet of stone, carve
its 504 Buddha ¡mages and 2,500
square metres of reliefs and decorative
panels. Below, model of temple
showing basic architectural features:
four terraces with richly sculptured
galleries, triple crown of 72 perforated
stupas around the central stupa,
40 metres above ground level. Here
we see how the circle (symbolizing
the heavens) and the square
(symbolizing the earth) are
combined in the ancient design of
the temple.

the stone itself, which is particularly
porous.
The moisture has set off a series
of physical and chemical changes,
which disintegrate this friable material,
especially the reliefs. A growing blan¬
ket of mosses, algae and lichens, and
vast colonies of bacilli flourish in the
damp and are hastening the process
of disintegration. Already, complete
sets of bas-reliefs have been badly
damaged and even if the rest miracu¬
lously escape collapse, they will perish
in the same way.
However immense the undertaking,
Borobudur must be saved. Experience
already gained in the restoration and
protection of stone and the success
of similar and equally vast enterprises
now being completed in different parts
of the world prove that the operation
is feasible.
It is certainly a colossal task, for
the only solution is to dismantle the
temple and reconstruct it stone by
stone. It will be rebuilt on a sup¬
porting structure of reinforced con¬
crete, designed to distribute the weight
evenly over the whole foundation and
to compensate for every kind of
movement, even that of earthquakes.
At the same time this structural frame
will stop water seeping into the cen¬
tral mound and consequently into the
stone. Morever, an adequate drain¬
age system will catch most of the
rain and channel it away before it
can do any damage.
In short, Borobudur will be treated
like an earth-fill dam, properly cov¬
ered by a water-tight shell. Once
the task is finished, none of these
protective works will be visible and the
temple will regain its true grandeur,
and even its original magnitude if the
first foundation-wall is cleared and the
reliefs uncovered. It is certain that
existing techniques for the protection
of stone surfaces will make it pos¬
sible to reduce the effects of climate
to a minimum.
The project to save Borobudur is
technically and scientifically feasible,
given the determination and adequate
means to see it through.
The Republic of Indonesia and its
highly qualified Archaeological Survey
Service recognize that Borobudur is
doomed, and despite the substantial
efforts they have made, they have had
to call, through Unesco, for the aid
and support of the international com¬
munity.
There can be no doubt that effec¬
tive means will be found to preserve
one of the most ¡Illustrious and mov¬
ing messages from1 our past, for sel¬
dom has mankind been called upon
to respond to a nobler or more un¬
selfish cause.

### Borobudur: the colossal Javanese sanctuary, the world's largest ensemble of Buddhist reliefs threatened by imminent destruction
PRECARIOUS
SLANT
These photos clearly reveal the
tragic plight of Borobudur where
serious dislodgement of the
stonework threatens to bring
down the temple in an. appalling
avalanche of earth and sculptures.
Along the first terrace (left and
right) walls lean dangerously,
and stones in the magnificent
sculptured reliefs are splitting
and shifting. Large-scale
remedial measures are, urgently
needed to halt this process of
disintegration. Buddha figures
facing the wall have been
removed from niches and put
here In temporary security.

On each of the four sides of -the
temple, a stairway leads directly to
the summit and the Great Stupa
enshrining the Supreme Beatitude. As
the visitor mounts the stairway under
the gaze of the Buddhas in their
niches, he passes all the phases of
the Buddhist Way of Salvation,
symbolized by the architectural plan
of the temple and its myriad sculptured
decorations. From the sphere of
earthly existence and desires (the
foot of the base terrace) one passes
to the sphere of forms or ecstatic
visions (the four galleries with their
Buddhist reliefs) and finally to the
highest heavens of the future Buddhas
(the crowns of fretted stupas).

MAMMOTH TEMPLES
OF SOUTHERN INDIA
In the 17th century, Madurai (Madras State) was the capital of a
principality whose ruler, Tirumala Nayak, a renowned patron of the
arts, gave his name to a style of architecture elaborately embellished
with sculpture, outstanding examples of which are the gopura
(gate-towers) of the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. Photo below,
taken from the summit of the tallest gopuram (see also photo inside
front cover) shows griffon sculpture crowning the gateway and
below it, steps leading to the Golden Lotus pool in which pilgrims
wash their feet before entering the sanctuary. Beyond the two other
temple gateways is the wall enclosing the temple precinct and in the
background the city of Madurai, today a large industrial centre.
Photo right, shows temple's Hall of a Thousand Pillars through which
processions pass to reach the sanctuary. Sculptured figures on the
monolithic pillar in foreground are believed to symbolize the Iron Age,
and the domination of man by woman.

### Mammouth temples of southern India
TiHE vast Indian sub-continent teems with art
treasures and monuments, heritage of an illustrious past
encompassing 20 centuries and more. In India, successive
peoples, philosophies and religions created cultures of
infinite complexity, leaving a profound imprint on the whole
nation.
It is in the perspective of this rich historical and spiritual
evolution that the unique artistic significance of southern
India's temples should be seen. After adopting Brahmanism,
the Dravidian peoples of the southern regions created an
architecture different from' that of northern India. Their
mammoth temples are veritable tomes of sculptured stone,
narrating the lives of gods and men.
This architecture took flight and flourished towards the
11th century A.D. As the square-shaped temple shrines,
called "vimanas", became less lofty, so the great temple
gateways, or "gopura," increased in size and by the end
of the 18th century had taken on the aspect of skyscrapers
(see photos on these pages and inside front cover).
Striving to attain ever greater heights, architects and
builders renounced the use of stone and extended the
already towering edifices with brick and wood, enriching
them with a multiplicity of stucco figures and brightly
painted decorative motifs.
As the number of the faithful increased, the temples grew
in size, extending their enclosures and multiplying their
"gopura" to the point where the outer enclosures were
occupied by the streets and houses of the city, as at

### Mammouth temples of southern India
The large temple of Sri Ranganathaswami, in Madras State, India, has suffered much
damage and decay over the centuries. At the request of the Indian government,
a Unesco mission in 1966 carried out a survey of the deterioration of the temple
and formulated proposals for Its conservation. Water infiltrating through stucco
coverings, and extremes of temperature have damaged numerous structures; stone
"disease" has defaced sculptures; cracks have appeared in many roofs. Some
temples are defaced by posters and hoardings, and by power and telephone lines.

Three towering gateways of the Meenakshi Temple
dominate the skyline in this panoramic view of
Madurai (Madras State). Characteristic features
of temple architecture in southern India, these
tapering towers are sometimes 50 metres high.
Comparison with the pyramids of the ancient
Maya temples in Guatemala is striking. Photo

Srirangam, whose "temple-city" of Sri Ranganathaswami
comprises no less than seven enclosures and 21 "gopura".
Construction of this monumental edifice between two
rivers near Tiruchinapalli (Madras State) probably began
in the 10th century. Today its structure and sculptures
show signs of serious wear and weathering.
At the request of the Indian Government, Unesco has
made an on-the-spot investigation of the problems of
renovating and conserving the Srirangam temple. One of
the largest in India (its outer wall is four miles in circum¬
ference), it is perhaps the most representative of the
Vijayanagar dynasty architectural style (1350-1565) with
its multiple monolithic columns adorned with stone sculpture
and decorative carving (see photos pages 30-31).
Several other temples of southern Jndia are also to be
restored, among them the 10th century Brihadiswarar
Temple (Great Temple) at Tanjore, whose central shrine,
27 metres high, is crowned by an octagonal dome carved
from a single stone block weighing 80 tons. Built on the
bank of the Cauvery River in troubled times, the temple
was designed not only as a place of worship, but as a
fortress in which the population could seek refuge when
danger threatened.

### Mammoth temples of Guatemala
MAMMOTH TEMPLES OF GUATEMALA
I N 1853, the ruins of an immense Maya city
(Tikal) were discovered deep in the rain forest of Guate¬
mala. Tikal is one of the most remarkable centres of the
great civilization which spread over Central America many
centuries ago, and whose origins are still a mystery.
Until recently these origins were never placed earlier than
the 3rd or 4th century A.D., but new discoveries at Tikal
suggest that they go back much farther. Since 1956, when
the Government of Guatemala and the University of Penn¬
sylvania jointly launched a full-scale programme of exca¬
vation and restoration, the astonishing riches of the city
buried in the tropical forest have slowly been revealed.
Clearing the jungle and debris that obscured Tikal for
1,000 years has confirmed the extent of Maya knowledge
in mathematics, astronomy and architecture, and the wealth
of their artistic creations. In the 16 square kilometres
covered by the city, 3,000 temples, colonnades, triumphal
arches, ball courts, observatories, houses and other struc¬
tures have been brought to light. Most impressive, by the
sheer magnitude of their architecture, are the mighty
limestone temple-pyramids, from 47 to 70 metres high.
Photo shows a 9-storey temple, uncovered in 1957, with
a single stairway climbing unbroken to the sanctuary at its
summit, 47 metres above the ground. Tikal's pyramids rise
above the treetops of the surrounding jungle of El Peten.
Most structures uncovered on the site of this ancient city
were built between 500 and 900 A.D. in the "Classic
Period," when the Maya civilization was in full bloom. But
excavation of temple foundations has revealed a series
of superimposed platforms which show that people were
living and building at Tikal by at least 600 B.C. As the
U.S. archaeologist, William R. Coe, of the University of
Pennsylvania, has said, "Tikal is like an iceberg with only
a tiny part showing compared to the mass still hidden."

### The Parthenon in peril
THE PARTHENON IN PERIL (Continued from page 18)
The sculptures still in position on
the two pediments of the Parthenon
present a far more serious problem.
Unlike the figures on the frieze, they
are so placed that no measures can
be taken to protect them. They
should, I feel, be removed to the safety
of a museum and replaced by copies,
as was done after the carvings at the
ends of the east pediment were taken
down and sent to the British Museum.
Even more complicated is the
problem of the metopes the carved
marble slabs set between flutings
located on the frieze, just below the
pediment supporting the sloping roof
of the Parthenon. To remove the
metopes and replace them by copies
would be such a delicate operation
that it is preferable to leave them
where they are and include measures
for their protection in the plan for
saving the temple as a whole.
For the temple as a whole is
threatened by other dangers. One is
the damage caused by the iron clamps
applied during construction of the
temple or during later restorations for
consolidating the stonework. These
iron clamps have become so rusted
with time that they have lost all
usefulness, and what is worse, they
have expanded and caused the marble
to split. It is thus absolutely vital to
remove all the old clamps and replace
them by new ones made of bronze or
some other rust-proof alloy. This is a
vast undertaking which has only just
begun and will no doubt take several
years to complete.
The countless fissures in the marble,
caused by the 1687 explosion as well
as the ravages of time, are a
permanent cause for concern. Water
infiltrates into the marble through
these fissures, and on cold winter
nights the water freezes and expands,
thereby splitting the stone.
On the morning after such freezing
spells our people go around picking
up the fragments of marble, carefully
noting the precise, spot where they
belonged or where they fell. Later
they are stuck back again, as are the
fragments that become detached from
the iron clamps. Steps are now being
taken to seal up all fissures in the
hope of reducing such damage.
But by far the biggest predicament
of the Parthenon today is its steady
disintegration before the onslaught of
the elements. This of course is more
or less true of any monument, but it
is particularly serious in the case of
the Parthenon because of the heavy
calcification of the marble. This
calcification (known as the Parthenon's
"disease") has been brought about by
the fires and exposure to inclement
weather the temple has suffered across
the centuries, further aggravated by
industrial fumes from the many
factories going up around Athens.
How can this slow, relentless
process of deterioration be stopped?
The only answer would seem to be to
coat the entire marble surface of the
Parthenon with a transparent film to
protect it from the eroding effects of
the atmosphere. But this technique
is also fraught with danger. If the
liquid film is too strong it could eat
into the marble and accelerate the
fragmentation of the stone; some films
could give the monument an ugly
veneer or alter the present colour of
the marble.
Much caution and experimentation
will therefore be needed before a final
decision can be taken. At present
various chemical products are being
tested on samples of ancient marble
found on the Acropolis and known to
have come from the Parthenon. But
so far, I regret to say, no miracle
substance has been found that offers
full protection and no drawbacks.
Certain products recently introduced
on the market and believed to be
effective, have proved, on testing,
either useless or actually harmful.
Finally, there is the new problem
of jet planes and helicopters flying
over the Parthenon. The vibrations
from these aircraft are so strong that
it is feared they will cause fragments
of marble to come loose or even shift
the position of the big stone blocks.
Steps have been taken to alert the
authorities to this danger and to halt
such overflights.
Time and the hand of man have
inflicted on the Parthenon serious
wounds which call for constant,
vigilant attention. Greek archaeolo¬
gists are deeply conscious of these
grave responsibilities and are doing
their best to preserve their most
cherished artistic heritage for the
benefit of all mankind.

PROTECTING EUROPE'S CULTURAL HERITAGE
IHE 18 member coun¬
tries of the Council of Europe (1)
have launched a continent-wide
programme to safeguard the cul¬
tural monuments, historic cities, and
natural sites that enrich Europe's
cultural heritage.
As a first step, a systematic in¬
ventory of this heritage is being
made in many countries. Details
of each monument and each his¬
toric, artistic or archaeological site
will be recorded. When a complete
"card-index" of Europe's monu¬
ments and sites has been compiled,
a summary of each "case history"
will be published.
This survey on a continental
scale might serve as a guide for
(1) Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark,
France, Fed. Rep. of Germany, Greece,
Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzer¬
land, Turkey, U.K.
other regions which are syste¬
matically taking stock of their cul¬
tural heritage and making plans for
its protection.
Since 1965 the Council of Europe
has organized international sym¬
posia at which specialists have
examined different aspects of the
problem:. conservation and enhance¬
ment of Europe's monuments and
sites; co-ordination of modern town
planning with the preservation of
historic monuments and sites; pro¬
blems of many historic cities faced
with the tremendous increase in
motor traffic and growing real
estate speculation.
Unesco views the problem of pro¬
tecting man's cultural heritage in
the broader context of action on a
world scale. In June 1964, it launch¬
ed an International Campaign for
Monuments which sought to foster
greater public and official aware¬
ness of the need to safeguard our
monuments and cultural treasures
of the past (see "Unesco Courier,"
Jan. 1965).
More recently, in February and
March of this year, two Unesco-
sponsored international meetings
for specialists and observers from
many specialized organizations as
well as the Council of Europe and
the League of Arab States were
held at Unesco, Paris.
The first meeting aimed to co¬
ordinate, for international adoption,
the principles and scientific, techni¬
cal and legal criteria for the effec¬
tive protection and enhancement of
monuments and sites. The second
meeting approved the text of an
international code drawn up by
Unesco to ensure better protection
for cultural property threatened by
public and private works. The text
of this code will be submitted to the
Unesco General Conference for
approval in November 1968.

KAZANLUK
Detail of mural in domed burial chamber of the great Thracian tomb unearthed in
1944 near Kazanluk, Bulgaria (see colour photo, pages 20-21). Here, a groom
leads four horses harnessed to a chariot. The motif also figures on many funerary
monuments and sarcophagi found in the Near and Middle East.

### Kazanluk: on looking into a Thracian tomb
On looking into a Thracian tomb
In April 1944, soldiers digging near Kazanluk (Bulgaria),
100 miles east of Sofia, came across the entrance to an
ancient tomb. Outwardly it resembled other graves found
in the tumuli that dot the region which was inhabited by
the Thracians before the Christian Era. But on being
opened, the Kazanluk tomb was revealed as a unique
discovery the first known Thracian tomb whose walls and
ceiling are entirely covered by murals. These masterpieces
of antique art have been termed the most perfect example
of mural painting of its kind and period known to man.
They show the intermingling of Thracian and Hellenistic
Section drawing of the Kazanluk tomb discovered in an
earth mound over 7 metres high and 42 metres in diameter.
It consists (from right to left) of a lobby, a corridor
and a burial chamber which is 3.25 metres high and
2.65 metres in diameter.

cultures in the late 4th and early 3rd century B.C. when
the tomb was built for a Thracian chieftain and his wife.
Murals in the passage leading to the domed burial chamber
depict ancient battles which probably relate to episodes
from the chieftain's life. Those on the walls and ceiling
of the burial chamber, masterpieces of grace and vivacity,
show a chariot race and a funerary banquet at which the
chieftain and his wife occupy the central places. Around
them are servants, a cup bearer, flute players and a groom
leading four horses harnessed to a chariot. For the
archaeologist and the historian the murals of Kazanluk
throw new light on Thracian life and culture, dress and
customs. The farewell feast offers a detailed pictorial
record of one aspect of the life of the Thracian nobles in
the Hellenistic period following the death of Alexander
the Great. Yet hardly 25 years after revealing to modern
eyes images of a long-vanished age, Kazanluk is already
in peril. Removal of the earth which covered the tomb
for 2,000 years disturbed the "climatic" stability which
had preserved the monument. Temperature and humidity
are now subject to considerable variations which have
produced harmful physical and chemical changes. Some
paintings are beginning to flake away and cracks are
appearing. The monument has been closed to visitors to
prevent the humidity produced by the presence of persons
in the tomb from causing further damage. But the master¬
pieces of Kazanluk are not doomed to disappear. The
Bulgarian authorities have carried out detailed studies for
their protection with the aid of Unesco. A Unesco
mission of six specialists has exhaustively analyzed the
physical and chemical causes of the damage and has
suggested several techniques that could help to preserve
this unique cultural monument.

GREAT MEN
GREAT EVENTS
KARL MARX
Born in Trier (Germany) in 1818, the
son of a jurist, the man who was to
become the founder of "scientific socia¬
lism" inspired many revolutionary move¬
ments that have marked world history in
the 20th century. In his early years
Karl Marx aspired to an academic career,
and studied law, history and philosophy
at Bonn and Berlin. He devoted his doctor's
thesis to Epicurus and Democritus, but
after his hopes for a university career
failed to materialize, he turned to jour¬
nalism. At the age of 24 he was editor
of a radical newspaper in Cologne, which
was suppressed a year later. He then
went to Pans where he began his life-long
association with Friedrich Engels, the Ger¬
man socialist theoretician. Together they
collaborated on numerous critical studies
and notably the "Communist Manifesto",
published in London in 1848. Marx, now 30,
had written that he would embark on the
"realization" of philosophy. Philosophers,
he affirmed, had only interpreted the world,
the time had come to change it. For
the rest of his life, Marx sought to explain
the workings of the economic system and
to change society. The vicissitudes of
politics led him to move from Paris to
Brussels and then to Cologne, but finally,
in 1849, he settled in London where he
remained until his death in 1883. Here,
in 1864, he helped to found the First Inter- ,
national and became its theoretician and
guide, and here, in 1867, after studies
that had engaged him for 15 years, he
published the first volume of his major
work, "Das Kapital". The second and
third volumes appeared after Marx's death
through the devotion of Engels, who spent
the rest of his life collating the various
manuscripts and supervising new transla¬
tions and editions. The written works of
Marx, books, essays', articles and his volu¬
minous correspondence, have never ceased
to stimulate a world-wide torrent of analyt¬
ical studies, commentaries and polemics.
To mark the 150th anniversary of the
birth of the great German thinker, the
International Council of Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies and the International
Social Science Council organized a sym¬
posium on "The Role of Karl Marx in the
Development of Contemporary Scientific
Thought", in Unesco House, Paris, last
month. "Whether we accept Marxism or
reject it", declared Mr. René Maheu, Di¬
rector-General of Unesco, at the open¬
ing of the symposium, "whether we adopt
it as a dogma or combat it as an evil,
whether we use it as a method or de¬
nounce it as propaganda. Marx lives on
among us by virtue of the questions he
makes us ask ourselves about the age
we live in, in. our twofold search for truth
and justice".
MUHAMMAD
IQBAL
Muhammad Iqbal, Pakistan's greatest
poet-philosopher, died at the age of 65 in
1938, nine years before the creation of
the State whose independence he was
amongst the first to advocate. But his
fame extends far beyond the frontiers
of Pakistan of which he was one of the
founders. He is revered as a spiritual
guide by millions of Muslims in the Indo-
Pakistan sub-continent and throughout the
Islamic world. A distinguished writer of
prose and a great lyric and philosophic
poet, he wrote with equal wealth of
expression in English, Urdu and Persian.
Some of his most profound works are
written in Persian because it is a lan
guage familiar to cultured Muslims in the
region, and lends itself admirably to the
expression of certain philosophical concepts
and the symbolism of poetry which is
in turn familiar ana transcendent. ,ln
a thousand forms, Iqbal expressed -the
free creative movement of life in time,
despite the inevitable approach of death.
"The possibility of changing the present
conditions", he wrote, "is the greatest
attribute and the greatest gift of man."
In his view the Koranic faith and the
evolution of science join forces in the
perspective of mankind's liberation. His
writing constantly attests to his belief in
the destiny of man whatever criteria may
be used by different civilizations in their
search for a more perfect world. As
one whose immense scholarship encom¬
passed all the philosophical systems of
Orient and Occident, he was pre-eminently
qualified to be a builder of bridges bet¬
ween East and West. His outstanding
works are those composing his trilogy
The Secrets of the Self, The Mysteries of
Selflessness and The Javid-nama. An
English translation from the Persian of
The Javid-nama has been published In the
Unesco Collection of Representative
Works (see Bookshelf, page 37).
JOHANN
GUTENBERG
Europe's father of printing was Johann
Gutenberg, who was born in Mainz (Ger¬
many) and died there just five centuries
ago (1468). Printing the art which serves
all arts actually began in China and the
technique of using movable type cut in
metal was developed and perfected there
early in the 11th century A.D. Several
centuries before this, the Chinese had
already been the first people to use
engraved wooden blocks for printing texts,
which were reproduced on rice paper.
Nevertheless, Gutenberg's achievements
amply justify his renown. The outstand¬
ing discovery he made was how to cast
movable type in quantity, accurately and
quickly. His invention freed the West
from its dependence on the laborious and
costly copying of manuscripts by hand
and brought about an economic and cul¬
tural revolution. A master glodsmith, Gu¬
tenberg was living in Strasbourg in 1436
when, it is believed, he conceived the
idea of speeding up the reproduction of
the texts that were hand copied by the
monks of St. Arbogast. A Dutchman,
Laurens Coster, had already had the idea
of printing from movable letters of wood,
but Gutenberg rightly considered that
letters engraved in metai would give
better results. On his return to Mainz
he published the so-called Fragments of
the Last Judgement, several editions of a
Latin grammar and some calendars. He
cast a full set of type from which in 1456
he printed the famous 42-line Bible, follow¬
ed by a 36-line Bible (1460). From then
on printing quickly spread throughout
Europe. Gutenberg's enterprises ran him
deeply into debt and he died a poor man
whose name remained unknown for cen¬
turies.
CARLOS
REYLES
The first outstanding novelist in modern
Uruguayan literature, Carlos Reyles, was a
cattle rancher who devoted himself to
writing. Reyles, who was born and died
in Montevideo (1868-1938), travelled widely
and spent the best part of his life In
Seville and Paris. In his first successful
novel Seba and In La Raza de Cain (Of
Cain's Stock) he strikingly depicts the
transformation of life in the countryside of
Uruguay at the end of the 19th ce,ntury.
And in El Gaucho Florido (1932), he recalls
his country's harsh . and austere past.
Carlo Reyles also wrote many short stories
and essays on the philosophical and
aesthetic trends he, found in Paris at the
turn of the century. His masterpiece,
inspired by his love for Seville, is El Embru¬
jo de Sevilla (Seville's Bewitchment).

Flashes...
Spain's illiteracy rate has been reduc¬

campaigns during which, up to December
1967, 818,000 adults were taught to read
and write.
Seventy-eight per cent of the people
living in the world's originally malarious
areas are now protected from the disease
or will be in the next few years, reports
WHO.
The Soviet Union is to extend its road
network by one fifth (63,000 kilometres) in
the next five years.
A college of satellite communication
technology has been opened in Ahmedabad
(India) to provide training and research
facilities for engineers and technicians
from India and other countries.

Letters to the Editor
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE SCIENTIST
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" has always
tended to give me some hope for the
future of mankind. But all this has
been overshadowed by the grim reali¬
ties as seen on TV and in the news¬
papers. It is not of course the duty
of the "Unesco Courier". to underline
or even dwell on this aspect but it
cannot be ignored. Looking with des¬
pair at all the ' miseries and horror
makes one wonder what science has
done to relieve this, and at the same
time what science has done, is doing
and might do to worsen the position.
Your February 1968 issue shows
us that some scientists, at least, feel
deeply that science can bring bless¬
ings. Yet, and what a big "yet",
science is being used in ways that
are inimical to the Good Life.
Emile Zola wrote "J'accuse" indict¬
ing Frenchmen for their treatment of
a human being. It is time that an¬
other "J'accuse" be written indicting
scientists for what they are doing to
millions of human beings. For Govern¬
ments are helpless in their war pre¬
paration without the aid of experts.
Therefore, it is vitally urgent that
these experts are stopped before it
is too late. If mankind is to call itself
mature then it can only do so when
no one can be found who will work
on any project which will be to the
detriment of mankind of whatever
colour, class or creed or indeed,
"ism".
Wilbur Schramm's article, "The New
Music of the Spheres", may not turn
out to be the music he hopes for. My
guess is that satellites will be used
for trivial and pernicious ends, adver¬
tising and propaganda. Not that there
is anything wrong with propaganda
per se but what nation is going to
waste a heaven-sent (sic) opportunity
of disseminating its particular point of
view?
Of course, scientists will turn round
and say that they cannot be held
responsible for the ways in which
their discoveries are misused. Possi¬
bly not, but they can use all their
authority as scientists to shout aloud
and warn of any dangers. As for
those who deliberately work on inhu¬
man projects, these men must be
made to feel the strong disapproval
of their fellows. Utopian? I do not
think so. Doctors of medicine have
a code, The Hippocratic Oath. Why
not a scientific oath which will solemn¬
ly bind a scientist to work only for
humanity? An oath which will ethi¬
cally bind a man to care for his fellow
humans and never allow him to deve¬
lop his discoveries or the discoveries
of others to the detriment of mankind?
Gordon Hey
Solihull, U.K.
Scientists are shouting aloud and
warning of dangers. See the "Unesco
Courier", Aug-Sept. 1967, article by
Philip Noel Baker, and the Nov. 1964
issue on Disarmament, notably article
on Pugwash, a world movement on
the responsibility of the scientist in
world affairs Editor.
TOO MANY WHITE CORPUSCLES
Sir.
The caption on page 13 of your
March 1968 issue on "Our Health
38
FLOWERS
THAT
STOPPED
A WAR
Sir.
I enclose two of the paintings done
by children in a holiday camp to whom
I read the story "Tistou of the Green
Fingers" ("Unesco Courier", Aug-Sept
1967). I suggested that they illustrate
passages from this tale about a young
boy who stops a war by using his
remarkable gift for making plants grow.
Christiane, aged 12, chose the phrase
"The weapons flowered like acacias
in the sunshine" (above right), and
Daniel (12) painted "a rain of foxglo¬
ves, bluebells and cornflowers falling
on the Go-its positions." As a teacher,
may I say what a pleasure it is
to be able to read such stories to
children, stories which help them to
think for themselves, uninfluenced by
adult prejudices, stories which encou¬
rage them to draw their own conclu¬
sions. "Tistou" has a special advan¬
tage since it interests children of all
ages between five and fifteen. People
today hope their children will build
a peaceful world, and to help pave
the way, educators have need of
material to promote international
understanding. A first-rate story on
peace ¡s all too rare.
Mme M.F. Gazounaud
Toulouse, France
Tomorrow" reads: "a laboratory count
on a single drop of blood normally
reveals 5 million red corpuscles,
8 million white corpuscles and 200,000
platlets..." The number of white cor¬
puscles should be 8,000, not 8 million.
Guy Couteau
Dreux, France
HUMAN RIGHTSAND DUTIES
Sir,
People talk a great deal about
Human Rights (as did the January 1968
number of your interesting magazine),
but no attention whatever is given to
Human "Duties". Naturally, the idea
of "duties" is less attractive since it
implies burdens and restrictions. Yet
each right is simply the counterpart
of a duty. And the first duty should
surely be to respect the legitimate
rights of others. What is the point
of affirming that all men have rights
without acknowledging the obligation
of others to respect them.
J. Quignard
Paris, France
NOISE POLLUTION
Sir,
Your issue on Noise Pollution (July
1967) was a valuable spotlight on this
menacing "side effect" of our modern
advances.
However, I submit that a second
look is needed at parts of Dr Bera-
nek's Informative article. He says
(p. 14) that 25 per cent of the people
near airports seem "unperturbed" by
the noise, and about 10 per cent seem
generally dissatisfied people who dis¬
like any noise "not of their own
making". The others are presumably
normal, levelheaded people, who are
perturbed. But this surely significant
group, of some 65 is passed over
In this context in silencel
The author says: "People... must
adapt in some measure to the noises
of modern civilization." (Original Ita¬
lics.) He can hardly mean that we must
accept more noise than we already
do, if he expects the agreement of
reasonable peoplel He presumably
means that we must learn to insist
more strongly that noisy machines are
socially inefficient machines, and
should not be bought or used by
responsible people; and that we must
learn to treat a person who makes
needless noise just as we would if
he threw his house sewage into the
city streets. This makes sense and
will, let us hope, induce our educa¬
tionists to give thought to the matter.
The citizens of Amsterdam, Bombay,
London, Paris, Rome have advanced
on their medieval ancestors in respect
of sewage, and we must do likewise
with noise.

This sculptured ceiling from a church in Oaxaca, Mexico, near the
Guatemalan border, is one of Latin America's many masterpieces
of 17th and 18th century Baroque art. It depicts the "tree of
Jesse", a religious decorative theme popular in Christian countries
since Medieval times. From the sleeping figure of Jesse, father
of King David, springs a tree bearing in its branches the chief
figures in the line of descent down to Jesus. But the sculptor
at Oaxaca has somewhat developed the genealogy by adding Saint.
Louis, Christopher Columbus, Pizarro and Cortez. A Latin American
centre for the conservation of cultural property, set up near
Mexico City with Unesco assistance, is aiding in the restoration
and preservation of monuments and works of art throughout all
Latin America.
