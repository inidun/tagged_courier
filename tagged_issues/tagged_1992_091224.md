### 91203: Rediscovering 1492

Rediscovering
THE year 1492, whose fifth centenary we
are now commemorating, marked the
beginning of a sequence of events in
which all the peoples of the world came to
know and relate to one another. It was a year in
which a number of portents signalled the
coming of the modern age. History, hitherto
fragmented, would come to be universal, and
the human condition would be seen as one and
the same everywhere and as transcending the
differences between cultures and civilizations.
From that year onwards, man, now par excel¬
lence "historical man", would be identified with
the "essential man" sought by thinkers and phi¬
losophers ever since Classical Antiquity.
A variety of myths, presentiments and irre¬
sistible scientific imperatives all led inevitably
to the day, 12 October 1492, when the two
hemispheres linked their destinies across the
"Mare tenebrosum" which filled mariners
with such dread but whose secrets cosmogra-
phers and poets had long guessed at. The two
halves of the Earth were joined together and
by discovering others man began to discover
himself. This first encounter was to be fol¬
lowed by countless others, whose successive
reactions would lead peoples and nations into
a pattern of change and growing interdepen¬
dence that is still developing today.
With every day that goes by, such encoun¬
ters continue and multiply: encounters be¬
tween emigrants and those who welcome
them; between haves and have-nots; between
those who walk the paths of knowledge and
those who cannot find their way. We now live
on a planet in whose future we are all
involved, whether we like it or not. We are all
aboard the same spaceship Earth, and we must
keep it on a steady course if we do not want it
to founder. More than ever before, the world
is all of one piece. . . .
We should speak frankly about the major
global challenges social, cultural and ecolo¬
gical which all human beings, whatever the
colour of their skin, whatever their language,
must face on the eve of the third millennium.
None of us can be indifferent to the com¬
memoration of the fifth centenary of the
encounter between two worlds. Arguments
over the nature of the event whether it was a
discovery, a clash of cultures, an encounter, or
a missed opportunity add fuel to a contro¬
versy that is not only semantic but reflects a
concern to make a just assessment of the past
and, above all, to adopt an imaginative
approach to the future from a present whose
astonishing diversity is expressed in American
culture its art, literature and music.
It is for the sake of the future that reflection
on the American past should dwell on the cou¬
rageous and honourable aspects of all those
who lived through the events both violent
and peaceful of these five centuries. No useful
purpose would be served by passing retroactive
judgement on them, by lamenting bygone days
or deeds that cannot be undone. History must
be accepted in its totality, with its areas of
darkness and light, so that the wounds inflicted
in its most terrible episodes may heal as quickly
as possible.
The past is ever-present in the forty million
indigenous people who have kept alive their
ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity in the
continent's archaeological heritage, in national
emblems and symbols, artistic signs and repre¬
sentations, architecture and textile design,
musical rhythms, traditions and customs and
varied culinary practices. This legacy is not
only part of the American identity and the
sense of nationhood of each people, it contri¬
butes to the diversity of the human heritage as a
whole.
The greatness and posterity of Indian America
do not lie in withdrawal and isolation, but in
the fraternal coexistence of the American
peoples in a spirit of unity that at the same time
guarantees diversity. Culture, like love, can
only grow when it is shared. Mestizo America,
shining like a beacon with a myriad different
facets, bears striking witness to the truth of this
process of creation and re-creation.
The intermingling of cultures can be seen in
the Ibero-American landscape, in cities like
Cuzco, where the achievements of Inca, Spa¬
nish and republican art all meet; in the superim¬
posed styles and influences that can be seen in
the "Square of Three Cultures" in Mexico City,
in the syncretic religious practices of Chichicas-
tenango in Guatemala, in the beauty of the
Baroque architecture of Ouro Preto and Chi¬
quitos, and in the outstanding writings of the
Inca Garcilaso or Felipe Guarnan Poma de
Ayala.
The uniqueness of America stems from the
intermingling of all the peoples whether they
be indigenous, Iberian, African, European,

## [Page 5](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/091224engo.pdf#page=5) 0

### 91203: Rediscovering 1492

1492
Arab or Asian that have made the continent
what it is. It is the product of those who were
there, of those who came from outside
whether by chance, attracted by ambition or
hope, or brought against their will, and of those
who were born in the New World, the children
of history.
Thus, racial and cultural intermingling
became the mainspring of integration and
enrichment; of converging creative energies
and novel insights into the human condition;
of the disinterested sense of abnegation dis¬
played in defending a faith; of multifarious
relations between cultures marked by con¬
frontations, resistance, assimilation, learning
and borrowing. José de Vasconcelos wrote in
La Raza cósmica that "the calling of the Ibero-
American race" was primarily to become the
melting-pot in which "all cultures will merge
into one".
America is a melting-pot which can be seen
to prefigure the only possible future for the rest
of the world a future in which human beings
from different cultural backgrounds will live
side by side in peace and join their voices in
unison, mixing and intermingling to weave the
complex fabric of the human future.
Telecommunications have made it possible
to reveal to the world the complex events of
our time as and when they happen. Spanish and
Portuguese, the common languages of Iberian
America, possess qualities that are particularly
suited to communication and have made a
signal contribution to this miracle. Some people
have spoken of the "imperial" power of lan¬
guage, as did Antonio de Nebrija when he
claimed before Queen Isabella of Castile that
his Grammar of the Spanish language would
make it possible to "conquer a world". But
Latin America has long since been spared the
rule of metropolitan powers which imposed
their language on it. It is today a place where
language is being reshaped as a medium of
expression, and an arena of international com¬
munication that is open to the great events of
history.
Thanks to the Iberian vehicular languages,
the Latin American countries are now claiming
and upholding their own ethnic and linguistic
heritage, both among themselves and in the
eyes of the world. Their voices are blending in
the complex harmonies of contemporary cul¬
ture, especially in literature. "A writer's home-
By Federico Mayor
Director-General of Unesco
land is his language", said Francisco Ayala in El
escritor de la lengua española. Only a common
language can prove effective in building "a
great homeland", while at the same time
contending with the challenges of the modern
age.
Simón Bolívar wrote that "Education is the
foundation stone of freedom". Bolivar dreamt
of a united Latin America, but his dream could
not come true without the connecting thread of
language and intellect or without respect and
support for the original cultures. It was a dream
that was dashed by more than one hundred and
fifty years of discord and is only now being
revived through political determination to
move towards the unity of the continent. The
establishment of free trade areas and regional
common markets, together with co-operation
in education and science, mark the starting-
point for a series of developments which found
political expression at the First Ibero-American
Summit Meeting held in Guadalajara, in
Mexico, on 18 and 19 July 1991.
On that occasion, the Heads of State of the
countries of the Region and of Spain and Por¬
tugal embarked on a process of economic, edu¬
cational and scientific co-operation, to be fol¬
lowed up in the cultural field by measures
designed to ensure the free circulation of goods
and services, while situating the problems of
Latin America in the world context and taking
action to deal with the many world problems,
notably those concerning the environment, that
lend themselves to national solutions.
In all these areas, courage and determination
are needed to correct inequalities. Although we
may speak of the moral debt owed to Latin
America by the more advanced countries, we
must also stress the "internal social debt" of
those countries where economic and social dif¬
ferentials condemn vast sectors of the popula¬
tion to extreme poverty. Courage and imagina¬
tion are needed to create "new models" that
will be capable of erasing the bitter memories
of the past and the inequalities of the present
and of paving the way for a brighter future.
This common task faces not only Latin
America but humanity as a whole. Accepting
this challenge is the best way of commemora¬
ting 1492 the anniversary of an encounter not
only between two worlds but between modern
man and his universal destiny, in other words
with himself. D

AKED as the day they were born. . . .
Handsome men with well-propor¬
tioned bodies and fine faces, hair
almost as thick as a horse's mane and cut short.
. . . Neither white nor black." This was how
Christopher Columbus described in the log of
his first voyage the indigenous people who
came to meet him on the island of Guanahani,
which he christened San Salvador. Convinced
that he was near the Indies, he called them
simply "Indians".
The inhabitants of these islands, and of
larger neighbouring ones such as Haïti, Cuba,
Jamaica and Puerto Rico, were Arawaks, while
the Lesser Antilles were peopled with Caribs.
These "Indians" and their counterparts in the
Paria region of Venezuela and Darién in
Panama engaged in hunting, gathering and agri¬
culture, and lived in small villages of mud huts

with roofs made of branches. The Spaniards
quickly learned that they belonged to "tribes"
and obeyed one or several chiefs.
There were other surprises in store for the
Europeans in their encounters with the peoples
of this extraordinary continent. Columbus
himself on his third voyage was told of Mayan
merchants who travelled by boat along the
Honduran coast. An even more impressive
spectacle awaited the shipwrecked sailors who
were washed ashore on the Yucatán peninsula
in 1511, and the navigator Juan de Grijalva
when he landed on the same coast in 1518 and
saw "a settlement that seemed at least as big as
Seville, with houses of stone, towers and a large
square. ..." This was the Spaniards' first
contact with one of the Mayan cities of Meso-
America, a region encompassing all of central
America and part of Mexico.

CEMANAHUAC: A LAND BETWEEN
TWO OCEANS
Meso-America, or Cemanáhuac, was the cradle
of a civilization which for thousands of years
had boasted great cities richly endowed with
palaces, temples and monuments, paintings and
inscriptions, and schools where books were
written on figtree bark or deerskin treated in
the manner of parchment. Besides the great
cities, several states flourished in this region of
more than two million square kilometres. Each
one was virtually an empire in itself with its
own political, economic and religious centres.
In 1492, the Mexicas or Aztecs, heirs to the
Toltecs, governed the region from their capital,
Tenochtitlán, which stood on the site of what
later became Mexico City and was even then
one of the world's greatest cities. Their ruler
Ahuitzotl, the predecessor of Montezuma, held
sway over a realm stretching from the Atlantic
to the Pacific and from the Panuco Basin to
Guatemala. A network of trade routes linked
the high plateaux of central Mexico with the
Mayan territories, reaching as far as the most
remote northern districts of the empire, in what
is now the southwestern United States.

Columbian cultures of Mexico
have been translated and
published in several
languages.



The power and culture of the Aztec empire
extended over much of the continent. A variety
of languages were spoken within it, including
Náhuatl, Otomí, Huastec, Tlapanec, Totonac,
Mixtee and Zapotee. The Meso-Americans
were remarkable agriculturalists. Their ances¬
tors had domesticated maize almost 7,000 years
earlier and had acclimatized it to almost all the
region. But maize was by no means their only
gift to the world. From Meso-America and the
Caribbean also came cocoa, groundnuts, cas¬
sava root, tomatoes, red peppers, tobacco,
various kinds of squashes, haricot beans and
cotton, as well as such fruit varieties as water¬
melon, papaya, avocado, guava, mammee apple
(or Saint Domingo apricot), soursop, chayóte
and prickly pear, not to mention a large
number of medicinal plants. Their domestic
animals included a species of hairless dog and
they also reared the turkeys which, along with
the cuetlaxóchitl, or poinsettia, grace the tables
of the year-end festive season in many parts of
the world.
To the north of the Aztec lands, many other
groups lived in mountainous areas, on the great
plains, close to rivers and lakes, or on the coasts
of the two oceans. These "Indians" were fewer
in number than in the southern part of the
continent and had managed to adapt to every
kind of climate, from the frozen wastes of what
are now Canada and Alaska to the torrid deserts
of California and Arizona and the Sonoran
desert. Today's Inuit (Eskimos), Athapascans,
Iroquois, Algonquins, Sioux, Navajo and
Papago are all descended from these peoples,
who from the closing years of the fifteenth
century had to contend with the inroads made
by the Spanish, and subsequently by the
English, French and Dutch.
In South America there were many other
groups including tribes which lived in small vil¬
lages in the vast forests of the Orinoco,
Amazon and Paraná basins. The civilization of
the Incas, which rivalled that of the Aztecs and
also drew on a tradition dating back thousands
of years, had developed in the foothills of the
Andes and along the Pacific coast.
TAWANTINSUYO: THE REALM OF
THE FOUR PARTS
From 1493 Huayna Cápac ruled over the Inca
empire, which was known to the Incas them¬
selves as Tawantinsuyo, the Realm of the Four
Parts, and stretched from the south of present-
day Colombia to northern Argentina and
Chile, taking in a large part of Ecuador, Peru
and Bolivia. This vast area was studded with
towns and villages, temples and palaces, and
countless monuments. The seat of Inca power
was the splendid city of Cuzco, almost 4,000
metres up in the Andes.
The roads criss-crossing the empire, from
the Chibcha lands in present-day Colombia in
the north to the territory of the Araucanians in
Chile at its southern extremity, were used by
the Incas for their intensive trading system. In
the Andes region, various animals belonging to
the camel family, such as llamas, alpacas and
vicunas, had been domesticated to serve as
beasts of burden and for their wool. Among
the loads they carried were potatoes, the
Andean peoples' great gift to the rest of the
world. Other products cultivated in the region
that would also later become widely known
included quinine, a remedy for fevers, and the
coca shrub, whose leaves, when chewed, pro¬
vide a powerful stimulant and can also be used
to make cocaine, a pain-killer, which drug traf¬
fickers, unlike the Incas, have since turned into
a source of ill-gotten gain.
The Andean cultures boasted remarkable
craftsmen who created unique alloys like tum¬
baga, which combined silver, gold and copper.
The works of decorative and sacred art they
produced over the centuries commanded the
admiration and provoked the greed of Euro¬
peans. Their metalworking techniques spread
as far as Central America and Mexico. Some of
those, like the painter Albrecht Dürer, who saw

the "golden Sun and silver Moon" sent by
Cortés to the Emperor Charles V thought them
the most remarkable objects they had ever set
eyes on.
THE ENDURING HERITAGE OF THE
AMERINDIANS
The Aztecs, Maya, Zapotees and other Meso-
Americans, like the Incas and Aymarás of the
Andes, were the heirs of highly developed and
ancient civilizations whose cultural influence



extended over the greater part of the continent.
They all had a number of features in common.
They were deeply religious. They shared the
same love of the soil, which they saw as sym¬
bolizing motherhood, and worshipped the Sun
as the source of all life and as a paternal symbol
radiating light and warmth. They respected old
people, whom they regarded as the repositories
of time-honoured wisdom. Their myths, sto¬
ries, festivals, songs and music show how spi¬
rits and the supernatural were part of their
daily lives. They strove to live in perfect har¬
mony with nature and all its creatures, whether
plants, animals, mountains and rivers, lakes or
the sea.
It is not known exactly how many they
were when the two worlds came into contact in
1492. A figure of 100 million indigenous inha¬
bitants of the Americas has been advanced, but
some people think this is far too high. What is
certain is that the culture shock and the spread
of previously unknown diseases subsequently
decimated the Amerindian population. But
they were by no means wiped out, and their
descendants are still fighting vigorously to keep
their cultures and languages alive. Today, 500
years later, forty million people of Amerindian
descent are living evidence of the force of their
creativity, their tenacity and their courage. O
Aztec painters and colourists
are shown at work in this
modern fresco in the
Museum of Mexico City.

èt> We, peoples
ofAmerica»,
To mark the Fifth Centenary of the
Meeting of Two Worlds, Unesco has
organized a number of meetings for
representatives of the indigenous peoples of
America. People of Amerindian descent who
met in June 1991 at San Cristóbal de Las
Casas, where Bartolomé de Las Casas,
the "Ápostle of the Indies", once exercised
his ministry, adopted the following
declaration:
"Fully conscious of the fact that we share a
common destiny, we know that the future of
our peoples depends on our ability to create an
America based on solidarity, andthat the
America ofour dreams is Indian and will
remain so, for the original peoples of the
continent are at the very heart of its identity.
"We are the heirs to civilizations which
flourished on the highlandplateaux and in the
tropical regions ofour continent and have
continued to contribute to the enriching of its
culture.
"We assert the enduring strength and vitality
ofIndian identity, as borne out by the
increasing extent to which it is taken into
account in drawing up nationalprojects	 We
invite the leaders ofour countries to heed the
many voices crying out for dignity, justice and
solidarity for all the peoples of the continent".
At their Summit meeting held in Guadalajara,
Mexico, on 19 July of the same year, the
Presidents and Heads of State of all the Ibero-
American countries made the following
declaration:
"We recognize the enormous contribution the
indigenous peoples have made to the
development and pluralism ofour societies,
and we reiterate our commitment to their
economic and social well-being and our
obligation to respect their rights and cultural
identities".

Prophecies and
presentiments
By Fernando Ainsa
«
What Columbus found
in the New World seemed to
embody many old European myths
anddreams
THE fact that Christopher Columbus stum¬
bled by chance upon the vast continent of
America whilst en route for Cathay
(China), Cipango (Japan) and the East has
given rise to a great deal of speculation. This is
not so much because of the chance nature of his
discovery attempting to reach the East by
sailing westward was a bold venture in itself
but because it took Columbus himself several
years to realize that he had indeed discovered a
New World.
The truth of the matter is that nothing in his
training and experience as a sailor and none of
the accumulated knowledge of the cartogra¬
phers and cosmographers of his day could have
given him an inkling that the Atlantic Ocean
concealed in its grey expanses a continent
extending virtually from the Arctic to the
Antarctic. The Spaniards, and Europeans in
general, were quite unprepared for such an
incredible discovery. As Francisco López de
Gomara declared in his Historia General de las
Indias ("General History of the Indies", 1516),
"The greatest event since the creation of the
world, with the exception of the incarnation and
death of its Creator, has been the discovery of
the Indies, which is why we call them the New
World. ... It can also be called 'New' because it
differs from our own in every respect."
A SEED-BED OF IMAGERY
Finding an explanation for all these "different"
things called for a great effort of imagination
based on the accumulated knowledge of the
day. In an attempt to digest and assimilate all
these novelties, explorers, historians and chro¬
niclers turned for guidance to notions that 11

### 91205: Prophecies and presentiments

A late 18th-century Spanish
engraving depicting an
Indian from the Orinoco river.
could be found in the Western world's own
scientific and historical past.
What they discovered in the New World
seemed to them to hark back to the most dis¬
tant well-springs of human memory the
Garden of Eden of the Book of Genesis, the
Golden Age of ancient mythology, the Lost
Tribes of Israel, the rustic Arcadian paradise of
the classical era as seen through Renaissance
eyes, the Land of Cockayne and medieval
variants on the theme of the earthly paradise
fabulous countries peopled with animals and
fantastic creatures, with Amazons, giants and
headless monsters. In the New World the Old
World found its own origins and echoes of
happy times of which it had nostalgic memo¬
ries. Far from discovering a new reality, the
Western world was returning, via the West, to
its own oriental origins.
During the years that followed the
"encounter", the chroniclers and others who
accompanied the conquistadors set to work to
authenticate their own myths as seen through
the American prism. "The Spanish," wrote
Claude Lévi-Strauss, "set out less to acquire
new knowledge than to authenticate ancient
legends the prophecies of the Old Testament,
12
Graeco-Roman legends such as those of
Atlantis and the Amazons, medieval legends
such as those of the kingdom of Préster John
and the Fountain of Youth."
There was, however, much more to it than
this. More than simply a setting for the verifica¬
tion of ancient myths, once it had become
incorporated into the imaginary universe of the
West, America became, to use the Cuban poet
José Lezama Lima's happy phrase, a new
"seed-bed of imagery".
In America this surge of unbridled imagina¬
tion triggered a process of association and, at
the same time, of recognition of those real dif¬
ferences that existed. This left the chroniclers of
the day free to transpose tales of chivalry to the
American landscape whilst still turning to the
old bestiaries, fables and treatises on plants with
magical powers for the flora and fauna with
which they adorned it. Imagination forged a link
between the known and the new and unknown.
"Countless and eternal are the Americas of the
imagination", wrote the Venezuelan writer
Arturo Uslar Pietri when discussing the myth of
Eldorado.
When Bernai Díaz del Castillo arrived at
Tenochtitlán with Hernán Cortés and first
caught sight of the white edifices of the Aztec
capital rising from a flower-strewn lake, he
declared that he might have been looking upon
the wonders recounted in the chivalric romance
Amadis de Gaula. Gonzalo Fernández de
Oviedo affirmed that the Antilles, where
Columbus made landfall, were the Isles of the
Hesperides, the sanctuary of the Golden Age
and the birthplace of humankind, which the
ancient Greeks thought were located at the wes¬
tern edge of the world, a forty-day sail from the
Gorgon Isles (the Cape Verde Islands).
It was not simply the urgent need to explain
the novelties of a strange new world that
induced the transposition to it of European cos¬
mogonies. The heavy symbolic weight of pro¬
phecies and presages also turned Western eyes
towards the vast unexplored space extending
westward from the Straits of Gibraltar, the non
plus ultra of the Roman Empire marked by the
pillars of Hercules.
OTHER PEOPLES,
OTHER WORLDS
Indications of the existence of a "fourth region
of the world" in addition to the three regions
of Europe, Asia and Africa that were already
known to Antiquity have been noted some
2,000 years before the discovery of America. In
the Egypt of the Pharaohs, the "Kingdom of
the Dead" was believed to be situated in the
"Land of the Setting Sun" and there were ref¬
erences to it in the legends and travellers' tales
of medieval poets and navigators and in the
speculations of astronomers and cartographers.
Columbus himself referred to them in his Book
of Prophecies (1501) in which he declared that
he had found this famous "fourth region of the
world", this site of the earthly paradise, long

by beings "different from us" is to be found
in Plato's Phaedo. "I am convinced," Plato
wrote, "that the world is immense and that we
occupy only a small part of it. There can be no
doubt that, on the surface of the Earth, there
are many other peoples living in lands similar
to our own." In his dialogues Timaeus and
Cridas, he writes of an island [Atlantis] "larger
than Libya and Asia combined", situated
beyond the Mediterranean, and of whose exis¬
tence there had been traces since the time of
Solon. The mighty people who lived there had
continually sought to extend their sway, until
they had been defeated by Athens. Many years
after this defeat, the island of Atlantis had
disappeared, abruptly engulfed by the sea. This
was why, Plato explained, the ocean remained
impenetrable and unexplored, since the shallow
sedimentary remains of the submerged island
made navigation there impossible. In the
middle of the sixteenth century, this forgotten
myth resurfaced again in Pedro Sarmiento de
Gamboa's Historia de los Incas ("History of
the Incas"). This book propounded all kinds of
argument to prove that the empire of Peru was
the remnant of the civilization of Atlantis
which, following a catastrophic earthquake,
unrecorded until the discovery of America, had
survived in the high Andes.
Other speculations about the existence of
the American continent, whilst claiming a his¬
torical basis, were in fact of mythological
origin. In his epic Works and Days, the Greek
poet Hesiod recounts that "Zeus had estab¬
lished a divine race of heroes, whom we call
demi-gods, in a distant corner of the Earth,
where they live an untroubled, carefree exis¬
tence" on islands where "the fertile soil brings
forth a fine abundant harvest three times a
year". Other classical texts evoke the Isles of
the Blest, the Hesperides, where the trees bear
apples of gold. Sometimes these islands are
depicted as immense and continental in size.
In his Epodes, the Roman poet Horace
declared that true patriots should leave Rome,
then a prey to internal strife and civil wars.
Though the Golden Age could not be revived
in a Roman empire given over to the Iron Age,
there were other places where a pristine inno¬
cence still reigned, and it was in one of them
that the new Rome should be built. As later
essayists and philosophers were to maintain,
the lands reserved by the Creator from the
beginning of time for the "pious people" of
whom Horace spoke could be the American
continent.
A PROPHECY FULFILLED
According to Graeco-Latin tradition, the Phoe¬
nicians were the first to explore the Atlantic,
setting off from the trading-post they had
established at Gades (Cadiz). In his Bibliotheca
Histórica, a jumble of fabrication and authentic
travellers' accounts, Diodorus of Sicily refers to
the Phoenicians as the discoverers of a world
"which is said to be the dwelling-place of gods
rather than of men".
Arab historians also refer to the Phoenician
presence in the Atlantic. The geographer Al-
Idrisi describes six huge statues erected by the
merchants of Sidon and Gades at strategic
points in the Azores and the Canaries, all facing
towards some unknown destination to the west
and seeming to urge men on to further voyages
of exploration.
These prophetic legends were later repeated
about the Carthaginians, the heirs of Phoeni¬
cian civilization. The most astounding of these
legends relates that the Carthaginians had a
plan, should war come, to evacuate the inhabi¬
tants of Carthage to an island in the Atlantic
where, according to Diodorus, they would find
refuge should Carthage suffer defeat.
The Mirabilis Auscultaciones, a book of
wonders attributed to Aristotle, contains an
account of an amazing voyage made by mer¬
chants to the lands of the setting Sun. "It is said
that in the sea which stretches beyond the
Pillars of Hercules, the Carthaginians dis¬
covered an island, now deserted, where forests
and navigable rivers abound, which is rich in
fruits of all kinds and which is several days'
sailing distance from the continent." Signifi¬
cantly, similar descriptions are to be found in
many chronicles and accounts of the discovery
of the New World. Gonzalo Fernández de
Oviedo, for example, speaks of merchants who,
in their journeyings, found a rich and "very
large island never before seen and on which
nobody lived".
Montaigne also evoked the legendary land
found by the Carthaginians in his essay Des
Cannibales ("On Cannibals"), in which he gives
an allegorical account of how some Carthagi¬
nian seafarers who had ventured beyond the
Straits of Gibraltar came across an island far
from the mainland, covered in forests and
watered by great, deep rivers. They had emi- 4 m
grated to this place with their wives and children JLO

14
and, captivated by the fertility of the land, they
became so used to their new life that they
forgot their European origins, and thus redis¬
covered the happiness they had lost.
No text, however, more clearly foretells the
discovery of America than the end of the
second act of Seneca's Medea, in which the
chorus announces that: "In a number of years,
the time will come when the ocean will open its
barriers and a vast land will be discovered.
Thetis will unveil a new world and Thule will
no longer be the last outpost of dry land."
Although a purely literary work, Seneca's
play, written during the first century AD,
seems to have been one of the supports on
which medieval and Renaissance cosmogra-
phers, cartographers and navigators based their
theories. Strabo and such fifteenth-century
sages as the Toscanelli of Florence and the
German Benhaim maintained that they had
taken the prophetic words of the chorus of the
Medea into account when elaborating the geo¬
graphical aspects of their projects for sailing to
the west.
Seneca's poetic prophecy was to have impor¬
tant political consequences. Columbus died an
almost forgotten man, known merely as a sea¬
farer who had come by chance across a new
world while sailing westward. Thanks, however,
to Seneca's prophetic writing, Columbus was to
recover the credit for a discovery that history
seemed to have snatched from him. His son
Hernando wrote these words in the margin of
his copy of the Medea: "This prophecy was ful¬
filled by my father, Admiral Christopher
Columbus, in the year 1492."
Later, historians as Francisco López de
Gomara, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, Bar¬
tolomé de las Casas and Hernando Columbus
himself searched among the authors of the past
for those whose literary or quasi-scientific wri¬
tings foretell the existence of a "fourth region
of the world". Each of them added his word to
the chorus that gave Columbus the credit he
deserves for the events of the twelfth of
October 1492 Aristotle, Strabo, Pliny, Marco
Polo, Sir John Mandeville, Isidore of Seville
all authors that the discoverer of America had
himself carefully enumerated in his Book of
Prophecies.
These prophecies and presages have been so
long and so firmly present in the European
imagination that it may well be asked, in the
words of the Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes,
whether America was not "a region longed for
before it was found", since "searched for in
every direction, America was both a scientific
and a poetic intuition before it became a verified
fact". The discovery of America, then, was not,
as has been claimed, a matter of chance. So many
myths and legends accompanied Columbus on
his voyage to the west that it must already have
been inscribed in the book of history, with
Columbus merely turning it into accomplished
fact. As the Mexican philosopher Leopoldo Zea
has written: "Europe discovered America
because it was necessary for her to do so." O

sources, and hence might be considered "Euro¬
centric" in character. But they represent almost
diametrically opposed intellectual conceptions,
one reflecting medieval thought, the other
Renaissance thought.
The medieval map is the product of a
Europe wedded to the ideals of Christianity, an
inward-looking vision of man's corrupt nature.

### 91206: A New image of the world

The Renaissance map is the product of a
Europe excited by the possibility of escaping
from such a grim fate to a more optimistic
future defined by space rather than time and
controlled by man rather than God.
It is true that those Europeans who, like
Columbus, sought to go beyond the bounds of .
the unknown, often. stated their motives in
terms of Christian ideals. But there was an
inevitable mixing of worldly and pious
motives. On the one hand, Columbus was
always conscious that his given name "Christo¬
pher" signified "Christ-bearer". On the other,
the wealth that he hoped to obtain (for his
sovereigns and for himself) by his great enter¬
prise of sailing west was to be obtained largely
by trade.
In the eastern portion of the medieval T and
O maps so called because their outline form
resembled the letters T and O was located the
Christian Paradise. The stylized land masses of
Asia, Africa and Europe were grouped around
the centre of the map where Jerusalem was
located. The Mediterranean Sea separated
Europe and Africa, and a band of water a cir¬
cumambient Ocean Sea surrounded the three
land masses, which made up the oikoumene or
orbis terrarum, the inhabited world known to
Europeans.
Although some ecclesiastical figures and
many ordinary people assumed the Earth to be
as flat as their senses perceived it, knowledge of
the sphericity of the Earth was widespread
among the learned. The circle of the T and O
maps can represent an attempt to depict a globe
as well as a flat disc. The narrow river of ocean
encircling the oikoumene can be imagined to
extend around the unseen portion of the globe.
A SEA ROUTE TO ASIA
The sphericity of the Earth was, of course, the
underlying basis for assuming that one could
reach the east by sailing west Columbus's
guiding navigational principle. The practical
basis for believing in the possibility of such a
voyage was the comparatively short distance
between the western shores of Europe and the
eastern shores of Asia. Classical writers such as
Seneca had anticipated the time when the
Atlantic Ocean would be crossed and Thule
(Iceland) would no longer be "ultimate", that



is, the end of the European world. The
fifteenth-century Florentine scholar Paolo
Toscanelli encouraged King John II of Portugal
as well as Columbus to try to sail across the
Atlantic because he believed it could be done
in a matter of days. Convinced by this and
by many other arguments and "proofs",

Columbus would for years beg support for his
scheme from a succession of sceptical European
monarchs.
In order to counter the argument that he
had probably underestimated the distance to
Asia via the western route, Columbus argued
that he would be able to replenish his ships at
known offshore islands' of Europe (such as the
Canaries), unknown but imagined islands like
Antillia, and islands such as Cipango (Japan)
known to exist but never visited by Europeans,
to say nothing of the myriad isles reported by
Marco Polo in the ocean south and east of
India. Some of the latter, which can be equated
with the Indonesian archipelago and other
Pacific or Indian Ocean islands, were reported
by Polo to be occupied by naked people.
Hence, when Columbus found islands inhab¬
ited by naked people in America, he could
confidently assume that he was in Asian waters.
Columbus continued to believe that he had
reached Asia, even after concluding, on his third
voyage, that he had discovered in South America
a "new" or "other" world. Columbus's under
lying Christian assumptions also led him to
speculate on whether he had not also found the
location of the Terrestrial Paradise the
Garden of Eden in South America, and to
postulate that the globe was not precisely
round like a ball, but formed with a slight pro¬
tuberance which he compared to the nipple
on a woman'-s breast which would bring
Paradise closer to Heaven, as it was reported in
the theologically-tinged travel literature of the
time.
The French scholar Abbé Raynal wrote in
his Philosophical and Political History of the
Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the
East and West Indies (1770) that "No event has
been so interesting to mankind in general, and
to the inhabitants of Europe in particular, as
the discovery of the new world, and the passage
to India by the Cape of Good Hope."
The cartographical results of those two
events are illustrated in the manner in which
the narrow surrounding sea around the orbis
terrarum on maps of the medieval period
explodes and forces cartographers to redraw

## [Page 17](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/091224engo.pdf#page=17) 0

### 91206: A New image of the world

their maps with new projections and new lands
to emphasize the existence of what increasingly
came to be called a "New World", separate and
distinct from the "Old World" of the medieval
oikoumene. Among the many myths that were
discarded was the medieval assumption of a
torrid equatorial zone that could not be crossed.
NEW LANDS AND NEW
PROJECTIONS
The map that marks the transition between the
medieval past and the Renaissance future is the
large wall map made by the monk Fra Mauro
in Venice in 1459, and which is now in the
Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana in that city.
Extensive legends on the map provide informa¬
tion and speculation about the outlying regions
of the orbis terrarum. Notable is the absence of
a closed Indian Ocean, which was a feature of
the world maps incorporated in the late-fif¬
teenth-century editions of the text of the first-
century-AD Greek scholar Ptolemy's Geo¬
graphy. That text, already known to the Arabs,
was translated from the Greek into Latin in
1406. Soon manuscript and, later, printed edi¬
tions appeared throughout Europe.
Ptolemy's text, as it comes down to us from
the original Greek through various sources,
suggests that the Indian Ocean was a closed sea,
though a strong case can be made for the oppo¬
site view. It is significant that both Arabic car¬
tography of the period for example the
twelfth-century cartographer Al-Idrisi's map
and the 1459 Fra Mauro map, compiled long
before the actual doubling of the Cape of Good
Hope by Bartolomeu Dias, assumed an Indian
Ocean open to voyagers from Europe hoping
to reach the east.
When Bartolomeu Dias returned to Lisbon
afteiTounding the Cape of Good Hope on his
1487-1488 voyage, Columbus was in Lisbon
still hoping to convert King John II to his plan.
According to Columbus, he was with the king
when Dias presented his findings that the way
to India was open in this direction. The voyage
effectively meant defeat for Columbus's efforts
to enlist Portugal's support for his proposed
western route; another monarch would have to
be persuaded.
The actual results of the voyage of Dias, the
culmination of the long Portuguese effort to
send vessels down the coast of Africa (well
recorded in fifteenth-century portolan charts),
is best seen in the map of Henricus Martellus
Germanus, a German working in Florence,
from about 1489. The map records, on its
African portion, the experience of actual Portu¬
guese navigators. Further east it reflects the
more speculative Asia represented on the world
maps of the Ptolemaic atlases of the fifteenth
century. The long Golden Chersonese penin¬
sula on Ptolemaic maps represents the Malay
peninsula, which Columbus was trying to sail
around during his last voyage, as Marco Polo
had done when he returned from China to
Europe by ship in the thirteenth century.
Perhaps the best representation of the world
as visualized by Europeans on the eve of
Columbus's first voyage is the globe of Martin
Behaim of 1492. Behaim, a native of Nuremberg,
spent much of his life in Portugal, where he was
involved with the royal court, apparently in pro¬
moting and/or evaluating schemes for explora¬
tion and discovery. His globe makes understand¬
able the confidence of Columbus in believing
that he could cross the Ocean Sea with the aid of
stops on the way at the islands of Antillia and
Cipango.
THE FIRST TRUE MAPS
The origins of the scientific cartography that
rapidly developed in this period derive jointly
from the theoretical work of ancient Greeks
like Ptolemy, the development of portolan
charts by Mediterranean mariners, and the evo¬
lution of scientific instruments such as the
compass, the quadrant and the astrolabe. The
understanding of much of the theoretical and
practical geographical knowledge of the ancient
Greeks was conveyed to medieval Europe by
the recovery of Ptolemy's Geography.
The two most notable features of Ptolemy's
work were his sophisticated instructions for
projecting the Earth's curved surface accurately
on a flat surface, and the conceptual framework
by which any point on the globe could be repre¬
sented as the intersection of two geographic

of the United States, is
director of the American
Studies Programme of the
Smithsonian Institution,

noted expert on the history
and culture of the American

co-ordinates. For this purpose, the Earth's sur¬
face was divided into 360 degrees of longitude
and latitude, a technique devised by Ptolemy's
predecessors. Ptolemy's Geography was, in
large measure, a listing of places on the face of
the Earth recorded according to their geogra¬
phical co-ordinates.
The oldest surviving example of the portu¬
lans or marine charts that were heralded by
Charles Raymond Beazley as "the first true
maps", date from the late thirteenth century
and are contemporaneous with the medieval T
and O maps and religious mappaemundi such
as the famous Hereford Cathedral world map



of about 1290. The new form, the product of
the Mediterranean sailors' firsthand experience,
continued to evolve for the next three centu¬
ries. The Mediterranean Sea is the focus of vir¬
tually all such portolan charts, although they
increasingly incorporate the Atlantic coastlines
of Europe and Africa, as well as the islands
immediately adjacent to both.
As befitted their practical purpose, the por¬
tolan charts were usually accompanied by a scale
of miles and a network of rhumb lines. The
emphasis on coastal navigation from promon¬
tory to promontory and from port to port is
evident in the care with which the coastal
regions are recorded while the interiors are
normally left blank. The marriage of the navi¬
gational chart and Ptolemy's graduated maps
begins with an anonymous Portuguese chart of
about 1500, the first upon which is incorpo¬
rated a scale of latitudes.
With the breaking of the chains of the ocean
sea by seamen like Columbus, the portolan
charts gave way to larger mappaemundi, world
maps increasingly combining the meridians and
latitudes inherited from the Greeks through
Ptolemy with the careful attention to precise
location made possible by astronomical obser¬
vations of the Sun and stars by use of the astro¬
labe, and calculations of lunar eclipses. The
invention of printing allowed astronomical
tables, such as Abraham Zacuto's Almanack
Perpetuum (1496), showing the declination of
the Sun at particular times and places, to be
more widely disseminated than when they
remained in manuscript.
Columbus and Dias, and many other early
explorers, were badly "off" in their calculations
of latitude in both western and southern hemi¬
spheres. More accurate (but still imperfect) cal¬
culations were made by learned men of the
period, such as Mestre José Viwinho, the Jewish
astronomer who sat on the Portuguese commis¬
sion that turned down Columbus's proposal in
1485. Even more difficult was the determination
of longitude, a problem that was not finally
solved until the invention of the chronometer,
or marine clock, by John Harrison in 1761, in
response to the prize announced by the British
parliament in 1714 for a practical way of finding
longitude at sea. Until that time estimates of a
ship's longitudinal position on the face of the
globe depended largely on "dead reckoning",
the subjective estimate of speed and distance
travelled. Little wonder then that early maps
reflect the limitations of determining both lati¬
tude and longitude accurately!
Cartographic examples of the increasingly
accurate vision of the globe are illustrated in
maps like Abraham Ortelius's world map of
1570 from the first edition of his Theatrum
Orbis Terrarum (the first modern atlas),
Gerhard Mercator's world map from his atlas
of 1595, issued after the great cartographer's
death, and Jodocus Hondius's Novissima ac
exactissima totius orbis terrarum, published in
Amsterdam in 1634.
The growing prominence of English, Dutch
and French exploration and colonization activi¬
ties in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries, challenging Spanish and Portuguese
claims in both western and eastern hemi¬
spheres, and the development of printed rather
than manuscript maps by the cartographers of
the northern European countries, resulted in a
shift of the cartographer's craft from the sou¬
thern Mediterranean countries to the northern
European countries, and were additional fac¬
tors in the increasingly accurate rendition of
the Earth's surface.
It was not until the eighteenth century,
however, particularly as a result of Captain
Cook's voyages to the Pacific and the use of the
chronometer, that the form of the entire Earth
including the Pacific as well as the Atlantic
basins began to take on the cartographic preci¬
sion with which we are familiar todajr. G

The welcome extended to
cosmographers and navigators from
other countries was one
of the glories of Renaissance Spain
B
ETWEEN the late fifteenth and the early
sixteenth centuries, Spain was host to a
large number of illustrious foreigners.
Some of them were only passing through, but
others eventually settled there permanently and
in many cases their adoptive country profited
from the qualities they may not have been able
to use in their land of origin.
The presence of foreigners in a country may
sometimes be a pointer to the existence of cer¬
tain failings in it and, as happened in Spain, help
to bring these failings out into the open. At the
end of the Middle Ages, Spain was a country of
many shortcomings and weaknesses which
belied its outstanding achievements and may be
seen as part of the alternating pattern of dark¬
ness and light that is a characteristic feature of
Spanish history. It seems inconceivable that a
country like Castile, which was capable of pro¬
ducing such an accomplished work of literature
as Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina, should be
lacking in humanists. And yet nobles and
royalty alike went off to Italy in search of Latin
tutors for their children. It was in this capacity
that scholars like Pedro Mártir de Anglería,
Lucio Marineo Sículo, the Geraldini brothers,
and many others came to Spain, while Antonio
de Nebrija and Rodrigo de Santaella journeyed
to Bologna to complete their education at the
college founded by the Spanish cardinal
Albornoz. Similarly, many of Spain's printers
came from Germany, the most outstanding
being the Combergers of Seville, who carried
on the family tradition in the New World by
setting up the first printing shop of the Indies in
Mexico early in the sixteenth century.
Many of Spain's shortcomings were plain to
see and it was only natural that the country
should have looked elsewhere in order to com¬
pensate for them. Sometimes, however, when
such a course did not really seem necessary,
foreigners were welcomed and accepted with an
alacrity that surprises us today, given as we are to
more insular ways in spite of the apparent cos¬
mopolitanism of the modern world. In those
days perhaps Spain was more flexible and accom¬
modating than it is now. We certainly did not
lack for generals in the sixteenth century, and yet
the French Constable de Bourbon was summa¬
rily appointed Captain-General of the Spanish
armies which took Rome in 1527 and in which
German, Spanish and Italian soldiers fought side
by side. Some decades later, it was the turn of the
Genoese military commander Spihola to win
fame fighting in Flanders in the service of Spain.
AN OUTWARD-LOOKING AGE
Indeed, one of the most striking features of the
great age of the Spanish discoveries was the
number of foreigners who played a decisive part

in them.. The list of names is impressive. The first
Admiral of the Indies, Christopher Columbus
(1451-1506) was from Genoa. Magellan (1480-
1521), who discovered the Straits bearing his
name and gained access to the "South Sea", the
ocean mistakenly called Pacific, was of Portu¬



guese origin. The three great pilots of the Casa
de la Contratación de las Indias^ were foreigners:
Amerigo Vespucci (1454-1512), who went by
the name of Américo Vespucio in Spain, was a
Florentine who acquired Castilian nationality;
Juan Díaz de Solís (who died in 1516) was Por¬
tuguese; and Sebastian Cabot (1476-1557) was
an Englishman whose father was Venetian.
Spain was certainly not lacking in good
navigators and reputable cosmographers.
Vicentiáñez Pinzón was as good a sailor as Soli's
and proved as much in 1492 and in 1499, when
he discovered the mouth of the Amazon, and

Juan de la Cosa was as skilful a cosmographer
as Américo Vespucio. Yet the fact remains that
preference was given to competitors from other
countries than Spain.
Considerations other than the intrinsic quali¬
ties of the individuals concerned were clearly
taken into account when the Spanish Crown
chose its servants. It was not advisable to be
proud or ambitious: Vicentiáñez Pinzón and
Juan de la Cosa both made the mistake of seeking
office as Governors of the Indies. Another
factor that may have gone into the reckoning
was the prestige of a navigator's country of
origin, as in the case of Américo Vespucio, who
basked in the glory of Renaissance Florence.
Cabot was a persuasive talker who claimed to
be the recipient of divine inspiration. His elo¬
quence and distinguished bearing may have
stood him in good stead. Monarchs or their

advisers may also have simply been blessed
with good fortune when they took foreigners
into their service; they certainly did the right
thing in welcoming Columbus and Magellan
with open arms. The ambassadors of the period
were not mistaken when they remarked on the
wisdom with which the Catholic Monarchs
chose their associates.
To my mind, this open-minded and out¬
ward-looking attitude was one of Renaissance
Spain's finest qualities. Today the idea of an
Italian becoming a Spanish minister is almost
unthinkable, whereas Columbus in his time
rose not only to the rank of Admiral but
became Viceroy of the Indies. It is not so long
since professors in the Spanish university
system were required to be of Spanish nationa¬
lity, as though our lecture theatres were being
used for trafficking in highly secret matters
that should on no account be allowed to leak
out. Five hundred years ago, a Portuguese
citizen, Barbosa, could teach at Salamanca
without having to go through any tiresome
bureaucratic formalities, yet he was, in theory,
a national of a rival power.

and settled in Spain had in common was a wish

to be integrated into the society of their time.
Their first concern was to cross the language
barrier, and the men who embarked on the
voyages of discovery all successfully overcame
this obstacle, even though they may have
retained the slight trace of an accent and the
occasional peculiar turn of phrase. However,
they were deeply influenced by their newly
acquired language and the large number of Spa¬
nish borrowings which crept into the letters that
Américo Vespucio wrote to the Medicis in the
Tuscan dialect bear witness to the considerable
extent to which he had assimilated Spanish cul¬
ture. Columbus acquired an excellent command
of Castilian Spanish and seldom used Italian,
apart from a celebrated note scribbled in the
margin of his copy of the works of Pliny.
ENTRANCED BY SPAIN
If foreigners were to be well received, it was
politic for them to take a Spanish wife. Almost
all the navigators mentioned above made a
point of fulfilling this requirement, even
though they tended to club together by natio¬
nalities and form clans. The one exception was
Columbus, who did not marry his Cordobán
mistress Beatriz Enríquez Harana, perhaps so
as not to jeopardize his prospects at Court.
Columbus, the most austere of them all, was
the only one whose descendants were to
achieve distinction. Vespucio and Cabot left no
offspring, and Magellan's wife died in child¬
birth, as did their new-born child, while
Magellan himself lost his life on the Philippine
island of Mactán at more or less the same time.
Nothing is known of the fate of Cristus de
Solís, the son of Juan Diaz.
The main thing is that almost all these for¬
eigners ended up, sooner or later, by identifying
themselves with Spanish values, which differed
in many respects from those of other countries
at that time.
Columbus himself is an excellent example
of this. In adult life, Cristoforo Colombo the 21

Genoan became Cristóbal Colón the Spaniard.
Keen to promote trade, taciturn and grumpy,
something of a miser, a stubborn defender of
his rights and at the same time an inveterate
dreamer Columbus was all of these. Even¬
tually he came to adopt the way of thinking of
the Spaniards, wanted to be like them and to
compete with their heroes.
It was under this "Castilianized" exterior
that the Admiral of the Ocean Sea faced one of
the most tragic moments of his life, when he
was removed from office as Viceroy in 1500.
After being humiliated by the Franciscans and
stripped of his powers, Columbus wrote to
Doña Juana de la Torre, the governess of Prince
Don Juan de Castilla, not to demand that he be
paid back the millions of ducats he was owed
but rather to plead that he "be reinstated in his
honour" a splendid phrase worthy of the dra-
matiát Calderón de la Barca.
A few paragraphs later, the great navigator
went back on his words and, although not a par¬
ticularly enthusiastic warrior, boasted of his



heroic deeds in battle, saying: "I should be
judged as a captain who set out from Spain for
the Indies bent on conquering many warlike
peoples with very different customs and beliefs
where, through God's will, I have placed another
world under the rule of Their Highnesses, the
King and Queen". Hence, Columbus wanted
to go down in history less as an admiral, or
even a discoverer, than as the conqueror of
boundless lands, where he purported to have
subjugated fierce and and restless peoples. This
statement is particularly incongruous since
these terrifying enemies were in reality the
kindly and peaceable Tainos, who formed the
human cargo of Indians he dispatched in chains
to the Spanish monarchs, by the same token
burdening Queen Isabella of Castile with an
uneasy conscience.
Magellan, another non-Spanish navigator,
was also captivated by Spain. No sooner had he
arrived in Seville than he submitted a plea to
the Emperor Charles I, asking to be allowed to
join the military order of Santiago. His request
was granted almost immediately and may per¬
haps indicate even more strongly than in the
case of Columbus a desire to belong to the Spa¬
nish nobility.
After 1492, Spain had to contend as best it
could with the many challenges brought by the
conquest and colonization of territories situated
hitherto unimaginable distances away. However,
before it was caught up in this whirlwind, and
even afterwards, it welcomed many foreigners
who made major contributions to its glory and
gave them a social status which they had been
denied in the countries where they had been
born. Cabot never received in England the cor¬
dial reception which Columbus enjoyed in
Spain. This is a highly topical lesson in an age
like ours, when some disturbing xenophobic
tendencies are emerging. In the past, Spain had
the magnanimity to welcome Columbus and
Magellan. Had it not done so, it would not have
become the country it is today. D

### 91212: Discovery and self-discovery

Discovery
and self-discovery
By José Augusto Seâbra
rv
The quest of Spanish and Portuguese navigators who
plied the oceans and explored unknown lands had a
universal significance
Above,

parchment manuscript, the
Codex Azcatitlán, showing
Hernán Cortés being saved
from drowning by an Indian.
Opposite page,
the Stone of the Sun, a
massive monument (height
3.35 metres, weight 24
tons) also known as the
Aztec calendar (Mexico City,
early 16th century).
EVEN today, when we live in an intercon¬
nected world that is reaching out into
interplanetary space, it is hard to contem¬
plate dispassionately the achievements of those
who, by crossing the oceans five centuries ago in
search of other continents, other peoples and
other civilizations, gave, in the words of Camoes
in The Lusiads, "new worlds to the world".
What took place in those times can be des¬
cribed either as a discovery or as an encounter,
depending on the point of view of the observer.
Be that as it may, the impulse behind it was a
quest, a search for knowledge, a reconnaissance
of other people and their ways. In its anthropo¬
logical and cultural effects the movement was
two-way. The navigators who set out from
Europe came back enriched by new values and
symbols that set the beliefs and thought-pat¬
terns of the Old World in a fresh context.
There is still fierce debate over the correct
interpretation to put on this turning-point in
the history of civilizations. Therein lies the
proof of its continuing relevance. The historical
record, with its areas of light and darkness, is
there for all to see: even if, alongside their ack¬
nowledged goal of Christian evangelization, the
Portuguese and Spanish navigators were also
driven by selfish motives that sometimes led
them into terrible aberrations, it was nonethe¬
less in search of a universal humanity that they
rode the waves and explored unknown lands.
Some recent commentators have attempted to
rank the great discoveries in terms of the degree
of distance between the civilizations which they
brought into contact. On this score Columbus's
discovery of America rates, according to the critic .
Tzvetan Todorov, as the only one in which what
he calls "the discovery of the other" could be
considered to be total. "There was never the same
sense of radical strangeness in the 'discovery' of
other continents and other peoples," he writes.
"Europeans were never entirely unaware of the
existence of Africa, India or China"1.
THE NATURE OF THE QUEST
Certainly "there was no European or African
element in the indigenous American civiliza¬
tions," as the Portuguese historian Vitorino
Magalhaes Godinho has pointed out, and "reci¬
procally, there was no American contribution
to the civilizations of Europe or of Africa until 23

## [Page 24](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/091224engo.pdf#page=24) 0

### 91212: Discovery and self-discovery

the fifteenth century". But Magalhaes Godinho
also notes that there was definitely a link
between the Amerindian peoples and the civili¬
zations of the Far East by way of the Pacific.
"There were frequent contacts and migrations
between the two regions; what is more, cultural
property travelled from west to east." 2 In other
words, virgin civilizations, totally isolated from
the rest of the world, may never have existed,
even if examples of relative insularity can be
found at certain times and places in history.
Nonetheless, the urge towards the unfamiliar
that underlies the process of discovery has varied
in intensity from people to people, or more accu¬
rately between the civilizations to which they
belonged. For to discover others is ultimately to
discover or rediscover oneself. To paraphrase
the French philosopher Paul Ricceur, it is always
a quest for "oneself in the guise of someone else".3
That is why the anthropologist Claude
Lévi-Strauss sees in "Afnerindian dualism" the
explanation for "a receptivity to other people
that revealed itself strikingly at the time of the
first contacts with the whites, although the
latter saw things very differently." 4 He thereby
reverses, in a sense, Tzvetan Todorov's pers¬
pective: in his view it was really the indigenous
peoples who discovered the Spaniards rather
than vice versa. Even if Columbus could write
of his adventure in 1492, "What I want is to see
and discover as much as I can. . .", one must
also remember, as the French writer Régis
Debray has reminded us, that the Spanish navi¬
gator also sought inspiration from Old Testa¬
ment prophecies to justify his conquests. "We
too easily forget," Debray writes, "that the
'great discoveries' were seen by contemporaries
as rediscoveries of things hidden in the
memory, as a verification of the archives".5
Such, at any rate, are some of the interpreta
tions put upon the "encounter between two
worlds" whose anniversary is being celebrated
this year. There are others too, if one extends
the canvas to include the other lands the Spa¬
niards and Portuguese shared out between
them, with differing intentions, under the
sponsorship of Pope Alexander VI at the
Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494.
TOWARDS A UNIVERSAL
CIVILIZATION
Despite certain obvious similarities, the beha¬



viour of the Portuguese and Spaniards was in fact
very different throughout the era of discovery.
While the Spaniards tended to emphasize their
own culture, the Portuguese, whether in Africa,
Brazil or Asia, were more sensitive to the interac¬
tion of peoples, notably as symbolized by racial
intermixing. Even the Portuguese language aided
the process; its flexibility encouraged the forma¬
tion of Creole dialects, the so-called papiamento
tongues, while it was concurrently serving as a
lingua franca on both sides of the Atlantic as well
as in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
Jaime Cortesao, the historian of the Portu¬
guese discoveries, brings two crucial points to¬
gether when he writes that, "In exploring the
oceans and discovering the techniques necessary
to cross them, the Portuguese not only gave
European civilization its most powerful instru¬
ment for establishing global hegemony: they also
opened up the path to the unification of human¬
kind." In this way "the first step towards the
creation of a universal civilization was taken".6
A universal civilization what René Maheu
and Leopold Sedar Senghor called the civilisa¬
tion de l'universel lay at the end of the great
quest for oneself in others that inspired the dis¬
covery of "new worlds". sFor as Fernando
Pessoa reminded us, the most important of all
discoveries is the concept of discovery itself. O

The American continent was
inhabited by several thousand
groups of Indians speaking
between 1,500 and 2,000
different languages. These
peoples were dispersed over vast
cultural regions in which there
was a wide variety of ecosystems
and types of social organization.
The situation could scarcely have
been otherwise in this enormous
landmass in the two
hemispheres, stretching 16,000
kilometres from its northern to its
southern extremity, a distance
almost double that which
separates the furthest reaches of
eastern Asia from the Atlantic
seaboard of Europe.
There was no direct contact
between the hunting, fishing and
gathering peoples living in the
frozen wastes of Alaska and the
great plains at one end of the
continent, or between their
counterparts living in Tierra del
Fuego and the Argentine pampa at
the other end. However, this
multitude of scattered independent
groups were constantly on the
move. They had spiritual resources
that compensated to a great
extent for the seeming simplicity of
their material culture, and
displayed considerable
technological ingenuity that was
extraordinarily effective in enabling
them to make the most of the
fragile ecosystems in which they
lived.
Clearly, these peoples could
not dominate the vast expanse of
America. Even so, some of them
seem to have been capable of
covering great distances. Some
migrant groups of the Tupi-
Guarani tribes crossed the
thousands of kilometres
separating the Paraná-Paraguay
basin from that of the Amazon.
Migrations and trade were made
easier by the continent's network
of rivers and lakes, which formed
natural highways to which the
road system built by the great
empires was only an adjunct.
However, mastery of space
depended primarily on the
numbers of people and the
dynamism of their societies. At its
peak, the Inca empire extended
between the Pacific and the
Andes for a distance of 4,000
kilometres from north to south.
Some 20 to 25 million people
lived on the central plateau of
Mexico. Between 10 and 12
million people were subjects of
the Inca empire. Perhaps as many
as 6 to 8 million people lived on
the large Caribbean island which
was to become Hispaniola (Haiti
and the Dominican Republic) and
1.5 million Guarani may have
lived in Greater Paraguay. All
told, Indo-America had some 60
to 80 million inhabitants.

The Aztec Empire
at the height of its power

Below: The Avenue of
the Dead and the
Pyramid of the Sun at
Teotihuacán, northeast
of Mexico City
(300-700 AD).
The cultural fabric of the valley of
Mexico was the product of the
successive peoples which had
settled there from the beginning
of the early Pre-Classical period
around 1800 BC until the time of
the Aztecs.
The first significant sign of
development was the .
construction, in the north-east of
the valley, of the city of
Teotihuacán, which in the early
centuries of the Christian era saw
the emergence of one of the most
remarkable civilizations of Meso-
America. Between 200 and
100 BC, the inhabitants of
Teotihuacán raised the imposing
pyramids of the Sun and the
Moon along the Avenue of the
Dead. Around these austere,
geometric edifices, a great
ceremonial centre and the biggest
Meso-American city of the age
were built.
The people of Teotihuacán
had a calendar and a system of
numbers, and practised a form of
hieroglyphic writing. They made
astronomical observations which
they applied to the orientation of
their monuments and their
system of divination. They
possessed notions of planning,
the organization of urban
settlements, and civil engineering.
They knew the properties and
medicinal uses of many plants.
Their arts, especially architecture,
low-relief sculpture, fresco
painting and ceramics, were
distinguished by a style that was
sober but also highly expressive
and rich in symbolism. They
worshipped Quetzalcóatl, the
plumed serpent, and their
cosmogony had an important
influence on later cultures.
Then came decline. Between
650 and 700, the city seems to
have been looted and
demolished. Around 726, groups
of people from a mysterious place
called Tamoanchán arrived in the
valley, and ceremonies to
celebrate the coming of the Fifth
Sun were held in the sacred city
in 751. This date marked the
beginning of a new historical era,
that of the Toltecs. The Toltec
period, which reached its apogee
between 752 and 1200, was
regarded in later centuries as a
legendary period of peace,
abundance and development of
the arts, crafts and sciences.
After long wanderings from a
region called Aztlan or "place of
herons", the Mexicas (or Aztecs
as they are generally known)
settled on an island on a lake in
the central valley of Mexico. In
1325, on the order of their tribal
divinity, Huitzilopochtli, they
founded what was to become the
powerful city of Tenochtitlán,
whose splendour captivated all
who set eyes on it.
This nomadic tribe mercilessly
extended Its control over the
neighbouring peoples. Its
dominion covered the central and
eastern region of present-day
Mexico, and it established
enclaves on the Gulf of Mexico
and the Pacific Coast. But there
were still pockets of resistance
within this territory, and the
hostility of the peoples who lived
in them, above all those of what
is today the state of Tlaxcala,
would play a decisive role in the
Spanish conquest.
The Aztec empire, or Culhua-
Mexica, was based on a triple
alliance between Tenochtitlán,
Texcoco and Tacuba. At the end
of the fifteenth century it
26

### 91214: America before Columbus

controlled some thirty-eight
provinces extending over almost
half a million square kilometres, a
quarter of the area of modern
Mexico. Nahua was the lingua
franca and the people shared
common religious practices.
Estimates of the population of
central Mexico when the Spanish
arrived have ranged from 4.5
million to 25.2 million. For
Tenochtitlán the figures vary
between 72,000 and 300,000.
The vast empire the Aztecs
governed from their little island
was highly organized. Tribute in
food, clothing and precious
objects from the subject peoples
reached the capital by water
across the lake or over
causeways. Thousands of people
thronged the city's great markets,
where a huge variety of products
could be found. The right to own
property was guaranteed, and
priests and warriors occupied
privileged positions within the
castes. Everything that had been
created by the people of
Teotihuacán and the Toltecs was
taken to a high degree of
development by the Aztecs:
calendar systems and
astronomical calculations,
techniques of civil engineering
and urban planning, education,
the preparation and interpretation
of historical books and rituals,
cosmology and religion, methods
of divination, arts and crafts.
However, Aztec society at every
level was permeated by a
messianic religion which provided
a pretext for imperial conquest
and a justification for human
sacrifices, which were deemed
necessary to nourish the life of
the Sun through blood.

The Mayan Empire: city-states in decline
The Mayan world was at the
height of its power during the
Classic period, between 250 and
900 AD, when cities such as
Yaxchilán, Bonampak and
Palenque were built in Chiapas,
Quiriguá and Copan in Honduras,
and Piedras Negras in Guatemala.
These cities were remarkable for
their architecture, low-relief
sculptures, frescoes, ceramics,
steles and altars. During the
same period, astronomy,
mathematics, calendrical
calculations and a system of
hieroglyphic writing also
developed. Political power was
exercised by a priestly caste.
Around the middle of the ninth
century, for reasons still not fully
understood, perhaps connected
with the exhaustion of the land
and the outbreak of armed
conflict, these centres of
habitation and ceremony were
abandoned. During the same
period, Toltec influence began to
be felt, the cult of Quetzalcóatl
appeared and, at the beginning of
the eleventh century, the new
cities of Chichén Itzá, Uxmal and
Kabah were built. The Mayapán
League was created and brought
together the forces of the city of
that name and those of Chichén
Itzá and Uxmal.
Mayan culture declined
between 1200 and 1517. Once
the League was dissolved, around
1450, the major population
centres were transformed into
minor states, and human sacrifice
became a very common practice.
The arrival of the Spaniards
marked the end of a brief period
of cultural splendour.
In the classical and post-
classical periods, the big cities
were a model of sumptuous and
harmonious design, with palaces,
temples, courts for ball games,
observatories, baths, archways
and tombs.
The most outstanding
expression of Mayan sculpture
was in low-relief, notably on steles
where it was used to depict
divinities, human beings and
minutely rendered columns of
glyphs. The most successful
example of the art of fresco from
the point of view of composition
and design is at Bonampak,
where battles, processions and
prisoners are depicted.

### 91214: America before Columbus

The Inca realm of the four parts
In 1492 Túpac Inca Yupanqui
(1471-1493), the tenth emperor
of the dynasty, had ruled for
twenty years the "realm of the
four parts", Tahuantinsuyo, which
covered almost 900,000 square
kilometres.
Strictly speaking the Inca
state was not so much an empire
as an assemblage of highly
diverse regions and peoples, in
many cases jealous of their
autonomy yet united by strong

language.

political and economic links
maintained by a state apparatus
whose seat was at Cuzco in the
south of present-day Peru.
Yupanqui had succeeded to the
throne on the abdication of his
father Pachacútec. He wore the
mascapaicha (a scarlet headband
which was the insignia of his
supreme power) and his authority
was virtually absolute.
However, Inca absolutism was
more apparent than real. The Inca
was at the head of a complex
centralized administration. A large
corps of officials travelled
endlessly through the subject
territories, keeping an eye on
affairs, carrying out censuses,
making sure that work exacted as
tribute was carried out, and
maintaining social order. All the
threads of this vast web led back
to the political and symbolic
centre of the state at Cuzco, a
splendid city with vast squares
and imposing buildings, palaces
and temples. The dozens of
settlements and fortresses
scattered through the realm were
remarkable for the purity of their
architecture and rigorous ground-
plan and for the quality of their
masonry.
However, the power of the
Incas was very recent. In less
than two centuries it had been
imposed on over eight million
people.
To maintain the cohesion of
this immense conglomeration, the
emperor had four main
resources. The subject peoples
were obliged to use a common
language, Quechua. Some of the
inhabitants of potentially
troublesome regions were
deported to areas where Inca
influence was strong, and
replaced by more docile people,
who helped to promote integration
in this mosaic of cultures and
peoples. A gigantic network of
roads, estimated at almost
20,000 kilometres, covered the
entire country. These carefully
maintained Inca ñan (Inca roads),
which ran in a straight line,
crossed mountains and canyons
by means of liana bridges or
staircases (the wheel was
unknown). Travelled by chasqui
(relay runners) who could spend
the night at the tampos (shelters
and storehouses), located at
intervals along them, they were
the ubiquitous symbol of Inca
authority. The cult of the Sun Inti,
the tribal god of the Incas,
became the state religion.
In 1492, the reign of Tupac
Yupanqui was drawing to a close.
He was assassinated in the
following year and one of his
sons, Huayna Cápac, succeeded
him and began a troubled reign
(1493-1527). His rule was
marked by new conquests and by
the struggle of his sons Huáscar
and Atahualpa, between whom he
unwisely divided the empire,
which collapsed in 1532, five
years after his death. The
Spanish were the main architects
of this collapse, but the empire
bore within it the seeds of its own
destruction.

A maritime network of
communication between three
continents
THE German geologist Alfred Lothar
Wegener (1880-1930), who died in
Greenland while attempting to prove his
theories on continental drift, claimed that at the
beginning of geological time there had been a
single large protocontinent. He believed that at
some time there had been an enormous convul¬
sive fracture and that what is now America had
become detached from the main block and had
drifted westwards to take up a position in the
middle of the ocean between the Euro-Afro-
Asiatic "West" and the "East" of Asia. If this
theory is correct, America might be said, geolo¬
gically speaking, to have "chosen" to look out
across the Atlantic towards Europe, and to
back onto the Pacific, being positioned to the
west of Europe and to the east of Asia. The sole
purpose of this rather literary digression is to
shed some light on the human affairs that have
been superimposed on these mysterious phy¬
sical processes.
Millions of years after the displacement of
continents, three small ships with a great des¬
tiny ahead of them, crossed the ocean deeps
created by that ancient gash in the face of the
Earth, stumbled across the enormous detached
fragment and, in a manner of speaking, brought
it back into the lap of Europe again.
Paradoxically, the Spanish had set out in
search of the countries of the Orient, which at

that time were shrouded in a legendary aura.
Columbus's voyage was supposed to take him
to the Indies, which were already being visited
by the Portuguese in the long sea voyages they
undertook in the opposite direction, towards
the mythical land of Ophir. As a result of their
extraordinary maritime expeditions, the Portu¬
guese and Spanish alike were to show that the
Earth was round just like the globe which
Martin Behaim had constructed in his work¬
shop in Nuremberg! rather than an enormous
flat surface bounded on the west by the
Atlantic Ocean and on the east by the remote
seas of Asia. They sought successfully to prove
that it was spherical and hence inherently one.
A year after Columbus's epoch-making
voyage, Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a soldier and
adventurer from the Andalusian city of Jerez,



began to look for a route to the Pacific Ocean
through Central America. Pitting himself
against the difficulties of the wild and unex¬
plored terrain, he led his troops through the
tropical forest and, after countless hardships,
succeeded in crossing what is now known as
the isthmus of Panama. At dawn on 26 Sep¬
tember 1513, from the top of a promontory, he
saw, glistening in the rays of the rising Sun, the
vast ocean that would come to be known as the
Pacific. On reaching the shoreline, he waded
dramatically into the water dressed in his suit
of armour, with the standard of Castile in one
hand and his sword in the other, and solemnly
took possession of it in the name of his
monarch.
'PRIMUS CIRCUMDEDISTI ME'
Then began what might be called Spain's cen¬
tury in the Pacific, with the voyage of Magellan
and Elcano (1520-1521) who sailed across the
Atlantic, and then crossed the newly discovered
Pacific. Magellan died in the Philippines, but
Elcano continued across the Indian Ocean,
rounded the Cape of Good Hope on his way
back to Spain and completed the first circum¬
navigation of the globe in history. Following
30
his exploit, he had a terrestrial globe placed on
his coat of arms, with the Latin inscription
Primus circumdedisti me ("You were the first to
sail round me"). In addition to the great
voyages of all those who crossed the Pacific in
one direction or the other, or in both directions,
such as Loaysa, Elcano and Salazar in 1526, Saa-
vedra in 1527-1529, Villalobos in 1542-1545,
Legazpi and Urdaneta in 1564-1565, Arellano in
1565, Mendaña and Sarmiento de Gamboa in
1567-1569 and Fernández de Quirós in 1605-
1606, a host of other less ambitious Spanish
expeditions which set out to explore the vast
expanse of the ocean.
By the end of this "Spanish century", Spa¬
nish sailors had discovered and named the
archipelagos of the Philippines, Marianas,
Carolinas and Marquesas, New Guinea, the
Santa Cruz Islands, the Solomons, Hawaii,
Wake Island, Guam, Iwo Jima, the New
Hebrides, Guadalcanal, the Gilbert islands and
the Marshall islands, the Galapagos, Juan Fer¬
nandez, Flores and Bikini, as well as the Torres
Strait and Austrialia or Australia, named in
honour of the Spanish kings of the House of
Austria, not to mention many other lands with
whose names we are no longer familiar.
At the same period, gallant English sailors
also ventured into the Pacific, but their main
purpose was to attack Spanish galleons and
their rich cargoes, and to report to their sov¬
ereigns on the activities of the Spanish crown.
In spite of these forays, the Pacific remained a
Spanish preserve.
In the eighteenth century, when her power
was starting to wane, Spain was still dispatching
naval and scientific expeditions along the coasts
of British Columbia and Alaska, the "Califor¬
nias of the North". The place-names of the
region perpetuate the memory of the Spanish
sailors and scientists who, between 1773 and
1793, methodically explored the western coast
of North America and investigated its physical
contours, its fauna and flora and its human
populations up to latitude 60° North, beyond
the Aleutian islands not far from the Bering
Strait.
THE FIRST
REGULAR MARITIME SERVICE
IN HISTORY
It is no exaggeration to speak of the "Spanish
century" in the Pacific, when it is borne in mind
that during this period the Spanish established
their presence in the region over a period of 250
years through the creation, for the very first
time in history, of a regular maritime service
connecting two oceans. This service was pro¬
vided by the celebrated "Manila galleons".
Between 1565 and 1569, another Spanish
soldier, Miguel de Legazpi, conquered the Phi¬
lippines, so named in honour of Philip II, on
behalf of the Spanish crown, which made it one
of its most substantial possessions and its main
base in the Pacific. This large archipelago was

## [Page 31](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/091224engo.pdf#page=31) 0

### 91216: The Pacific shuttle

an enduring legacy of the Spanish presence in
the Far East, since it belonged to Spain for
more than three centuries, until 1898. The Spa¬
nish came to display close affinities with the
Asian world in their outlook and even in some
of their customs.
Manila, in the Philippines, was the home
port of the Spanish galleons that plied regularly
across the Pacific to Acapulco on the Mexican
seaboard.
The first crossing to Mexico took place in
1573, the last in 1811, 238 years later. The gal¬
leons, some of which had a displacement of as
much as 2,000 tons, were designed in Spain but
were built in the shipyards of Cavité, south¬
west of Manila, of tropical hardwoods capable
of withstanding the difficult sailing conditions
to which they were exposed.
The voyage from Acapulco to Manila,
which followed the trade-wind route, took
about sixty days, However, the return trip
from Manila to Acapulco took much longer
and was more dangerous. It was necessary to
sail northwards, almost up to the latitude of
Japan, in order to pick up the westerly winds
and then make for the coast of Mexico across
regions that were frequently swept by heavy
storms. The outward and return voyages
totalled some 18,000 nautical miles. For nearly
two and a half centuries ships came and went
with almost perfect regularity. And that was in
an age of sails and the compass, navigation
charts that left a great deal to the imagination,
the trade winds, the Kuroshio or Japan current,
typhoons, solitude, heat, scurvy, beri-beri and
pirates.
The Manila galleons provided a regular
link between Asia and Latin America but also
with Europe, since their voyages were syn¬
chronized with the movements of the Spanish
Atlantic fleets that plied between Spain and
the Central American isthmus. Hundreds,
indeed thousands of ships sailed the two
oceans and formed transport networks that
linked the three continents.
The Spanish port of Manila came to be a
centre of world trade through which goods
from Japan, Borneo, Java, the Spice islands,
India, Ceylon, Siam, Cambodia and Malaysia all
transited, either directly or via China. The gal¬
leons came there to take on board fabulous trea¬
sures that fascinated Westerners, such as gold,
pearls, sapphires from Siam, ivory, lacquers,
Chinese silks, amber, sandalwood and camphor,

jade, Ming porcelain, musk, cinammon, cloves,
pepper and curry. Along with these precious
cargoes, however, they also carried away the
ideas, tastes and traditions of the Asian Orient,
which left their mark on Spanish America and
captivated Europe, helping to arouse European
interest in trading with Asia. A large number of
"East Indies Companies" were founded, then
and later.
A BRIDGEHEAD
BETWEEN
EAST AND WEST
It is true that prehistoric Asiatic peoples settled
on the American continent by crossing the
Bering Strait or by sailing to America from
Polynesia, but it was the "discovery" of the
Pacific in modern times that really opened up
the gateway to America.
As the Mexican writer Eduardo Espinosa has
noted, America has suffered from a loss of a
sense of direction. Since Americans inherited the
European outlook, they speak of Asia as being
the Far East, although the east is actually
situated to the west of America and America
itself lies east of China and Japan. This unques¬
tioning acceptance of geographical and cultural
concepts specific to Europe has prevented Ame¬
rica from seeing that Asia, which it regarded as
being a long way away, was actually "some¬
where else" and was coming ever closer to it
across the Pacific, seeming to tap America on the
shoulder and remind Americans of its existence.
Indeed, there it is, dispatching to the shores of
America wave upon wave of immigrants, whose
burgeoning communities are contributing to a
new racial mix and perhaps to the formation of a
new ethnic and cultural melting pot with conse¬
quences that cannot be foreseen.
America is coming to realize at last that its
position between two great oceans, the Atlantic



and the Pacific, midway between Europe and
Asia, is making it a bridgehead between East
and West. These are two conceptual rather than
geographical entities, which for centuries were
thought to be at the opposite ends of a kind of
huge rectangle, whereas in reality they are
located on a sphere where the perspective keeps
on changing according to one's viewpoint. As
America looks out on one side on to a purely
conventional "West" and on the other on to a
no less conventional "East", it may one day be
in the position to amalgamate the two, just as
when it was discovered five centuries ago it
contributed to the world the idea of its own
sphericity, in other words of its possible unity.
Will America, after having been settled by
people from Asia at the dawn of the human era
and then resettled later by people from Europe,
eventually become the ideal birthplace of what
the Mexican philosopher José de Vasconcelos
called "the cosmic race"? O

By Vera Kuteischikova
Surprising affinities link two
regions separated by geography
and history
THE lands of America set alight by the
Conquest were still blazing when, at the
other end of the world, in distant Mus¬
covy, a theologian by the name of Maximus the
Greek (1475-1556) had already recounted the
exploits of the Spanish and Portuguese. His
information was inaccurate, to say the least, and
he did not even mention the name of Columbus.
Nevertheless, he grasped the significance of the
Discovery and predicted that a new human com¬
munity would emerge from the coming-together
of the Europeans and the indigenous peoples.
News from America was slow to reach
Russia and what little there was came piece¬
meal from European sources. It was not until
the eighteenth century, during the reign of

Peter the Great, that the Russians set up trading
links with the American territories and came
into contact with the inhabitants of California,
which at that time was a province of the Vice-
royalty of New Spain. They were thus able to
add to their geographical knowledge and gain a
clearer picture of America.
Russian society was above all interested in
the Conquest as an event of global significance,
and it was as such that it came to feature in the
works of such leading authors as the poet and
scientist Mikhail Lomonosov (1711-1765), the
dramatist Aleksandr Sumarokov (1718-1778),
the great fable-writer Ivan Krylov (1769-1844),
and the poet Gavrila Derzhavin (1743-1816).
Sumarokov puts forward a highly personal
view of the Conquest in his "Conversation in
the Kingdom of the Dead", consisting of a dia¬
logue between Cortés and Montezuma, in
which the conquistador claims that he owes his
victory to the hatred for the Aztec emperor felt
by his own' subjects. The moral which the
author, as a freethinker and fierce critic of
absolutism, draws is perfectly clear: rulers must
take care not to lapse into tyranny.
BOLIVAR'S HAT
These eighteenth-century writings bleed with
compassion for enslaved and oppressed indige¬
nous peoples. They denounce the shackles of
colonialism, but what their authors are really
doing is to use America to point an accusing
finger at Russian serfdom, which is likened to the
institution of slavery in the American colonies.
This analogy is also drawn in the celebrated
Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow, by
Aleksandr Radischev (1749-1802), the first plea
for the abolition of serfdom in a country where
two-thirds of the population were deprived of
all rights. Inione passage, Radischev recalls the
summer afternoons when he lingered on the
quayside, watching the ships from America that
had brought back their rich cargoes of sugar,
coffee, dyes and other precious fruits of the
earth, still damp from the sweat, blood and tears
of the people who had grown them. In this
connection, the author makes an oblique allu¬
sion whose meaning only later becomes plain,
when he writes: "Remember, as a friend once
told me to do, that the coffee you pour in your
cup and the sugar you dissolve in it were the
cause of the martyrdom of your fellow-men and
the reason for untold torture and outrage".
Radischev's pamphlet incurred the wrath of
the Empress Catherine II and he was hauled
before the courts. It was only then that the
name of the unknown friend who had
denounced the fruits grown with the sweat and
blood of the American slaves became known.
Radischev admitted that he had drawn inspira¬
tion from the Philosophical and Political His¬
tory of the Settlements and Trade of the Euro¬
peans in the East and West Indies, which had
been published in 1770 by the abbé Guillaume
Raynal, a French philosopher. It is hardly sur¬
prising that Radischev should have referred to a
thinker of the French Enlightenment, since
Russian culture in the eighteenth century was
profoundly influenced by that movement and
embraced the ideas of Voltaire, Rousseau,
Montesquieu and Marmontel, among others.
The Enlightenment reached Spanish America
at the end of the eighteenth century, at the very
outset of the anti-colonialist movement, which
made Raynal's work the spearhead of its struggle
against Spain. Here again, France was the go-
between in the dialogue that was established
between Russia and the Ibero-American world.
In Russia, Simón Bolívar became an almost
legendary figure and enjoyed a vast reputation,
which gave rise to a widespread fashion for a
type of broad-brimmed hat imported from
France. This exotic headgear is even mentioned
in one of the masterworks of Russian literature,
Eugene Onegin, the verse novel by Aleksandr
Pushkin (1799-1837). The structuralist and
semiologist Yuri Lotman has pointed out that
the hat, which had been taken as a symbol by
the Spanish American rebels, was used for the
same purpose by the French liberals and was
sported by the freethinkers and dandies of St.
Petersburg, where it was known as a bolivar.

However, their fascination with the splendour
of the landscape did not prevent them from
voicing their opposition to slavery. The exalta¬
tion of nature and the urge for freedom that
were the characteristic features of nineteenth-
century Romanticism profoundly influenced
their view of the Latin American world.
As well as the logs kept by mariners, which
are full of vivid although necessarily brief des¬
criptions, there are more substantial accounts
whose authors have not so much attempted to
describe the landscapes as to analyse their views
on the new social, political and ethnic issues
which they encountered.
Aleksandr Rotchev, a writer who visited
several Caribbean countries at this period, saw for
himself the danger which North American expan¬
sionism represented for Central America and was
appalled at "the cruelty of the customs and the
intolerable treatment which the North Americans
meted out to the natives of the country".
In the meantime, at the other end of the
continent, Russian travellers repeatedly
expressed their astonishment at the gauchos. In
his "Voyage across the pampa of Buenos Aires",
Platon Chikhachov, who crossed the vast plains
of La Plata, admitted to feeling a mixture of
admiration and fear for these proud, intrepid
horsemen, with their haughty independence.
The accounts of Russian travellers in the New
World are so varied that it is difficult to draw any
general conclusions from them. However, nearly
all of them, no matter how great their sense of
wonderment at the landscapes, were unable to
stifle their nostalgia for their far-off homeland.
There are insistent echoes of the siren call of
Russia in "Through South America", a monu¬
mental work by the writer and diplomat Alek¬
sandr Ionin, who lived in the region from 1892 to
1896. Ionin had a sharp and enquiring mind and
described his experiences with a somewhat lofty
detachment, although without losing sight of the
finer points of detail. However, the interest and
originality of this major work lies in the ideas he
developed in it. These are encapsulated in his
prose poem "Lake Titicaca", in which he departs
from the Eurocentric view of history. At an alti¬
tude of 4,000 metres, beside a lake close to the
sky, he experiences a kind of revelation. As he
contemplates the natural wonders, he suddenly
realizes that nature and culture are inseparably
linked and that rational thinking stands
condemned because it has been unwilling to
recognize that fact. He writes: "I then saw that
my native steppes, like these high plateaux, do
not conform to the theories of life drawn from
the writings of the Old World and that they
both have to inspire us to look for new ways of
thinking and reasoning."
Another illustrious visitor to the New World
was the Symbolist poet Konstantin Balmont

immersed himself in the atmosphere of the
ancient Indian civilization which, he confessed,
filled him with "feelings of magic". Like Ionin,
he calls on his readers to acknowledge the limita¬
tions of the self-absorbed European view of
things and urges them "to look out on plains and
valleys, not from little Mont Blanc swarming
with tourists but from the volcanic heights of
gigantic Chimborazo and its snow-capped peaks,
at the feet of which the Peruvians built temples of
gold to the Sun and of silver to the Moon".
A NEW DIALOGUE
At the end of the nineteenth century, what had
hitherto been an embryonic dialogue really
began to take shape with the publication of the
classics of Russian literature in Latin America,
where the works of Turgenev, Tolstoy and
Gorky aroused considerable interest. The Latin
Americans discovered the harsh predicament of
the Russian people, weighed down by the
burdea of social and spiritual bondage, and suc¬
cumbed to the attraction of the "naturalist mysti¬
cism" in which "these vast and mysterious- fast¬
nesses" are steeped. The Venezuelan writer
Arturo Uslar Pietri sees the Russian people as
having "secret affinities in terms of their sensibi
lity, fatalistic outlook and taste for the tragic",
which links them to the people of Latin America.
It is perhaps in these affinities that we should
look for an explanation for the extraordinary
commotion which the Russian Revolution of
1917 caused in Latin America. It was not by
chance that Pablo Neruda and Jorge Amado
should have been the first to acquaint the Rus¬
sians with their wild continent and its tragic
beauty and life-enhancing energy. Russian rea¬
ders were enthralled by Amado's Terras do
Sem-Fin (The Violent Land) and moved by the
exuberant poetry of Neruda's Canto General,
in whose stanzas the entire history of Latin
America unfolds.
The creative freedom of the new novel, as
practised by Alejo Carpentier, Carlos Fuentes,
Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cortázar and Gabriel
García Márquez, was a source of fascination to
Soviet writers. Chingiz Aïtmatov said that,
after having read García Márquez, he could
no longer write in the same way as before.
Whereas some fifty years earlier Latin Ameri¬
cans felt a spiritual kinship with the characters
of the Russian novel, Russians now see some¬
thing of themselves reflected in the Latin
American novel.
The publication of the Russian translation
of El señor Presidente (The President) by
Miguel Angel Asturias, with its gripping por¬
trait of a small country ground down by dicta¬
torship, alerted us to the machinery of death
operated by tyrannical Latin American
regimes. In the 1970s, three other novels on the
same subject had a resounding success. These
were El Recurso del método (Reasons of State)
by Alejo Carpentier, Yo, el Supremo (I, the
Chief) by Augusto Roa Bastos, and El Otoño
del Patriarca (The Autumn of the Patriarch) by
Gabriel García Márquez. No matter how
exotic Russian readers may have found the cha¬
racters and settings of these novels, they still
saw something chillingly familiar in their histo¬
rical plots and the unfolding of the action.
The Autumn of the Patriarch has been read
all over the world, but the Russians were the
only ones to shed tears when they recognized the
features of the diabolical and insane dictator as
those of the totalitarian regime that was tram¬
pling them underfoot. Only the Russians or
rather the Soviets have had to submit to myth-
making and mendacity raised to a system of
government.
The phenomenal success of García Márquez
in our country reminds me of the words of the
Russian linguist and literary critic Mikhail
Bakhtin, who claimed that "a culture only reveals
itself in its full magnitude and depth when it is
looked at by another culture". He also stressed
that dialogue between cultures is the driving
force behind the spiritual progress of mankind.
This idea is a very topical one for, as humanity
approaches the five-hundredth anniversary of the
encounter between two worlds, it is at last begin¬
ning to realize that the world to which it belongs
is actually one and the same. O 35

### 91218: The Guadalajara Declaration: extracts

If the present situation persists, ideological
bipolarity may give way to a division between
the North, rich in capital and technology, and
the South, poor and without prospects. To
overcome the problem, it is necessary on the
one hand to develop effective forms of recipro¬
city and solidarity and, on the other, to ground
them in an ethical plan, guided by social justice
and freedom and offering new patterns that
will spur genuine co-operation among the
countries of the world	
Faced with world-wide ecological deterio¬
ration, closely linked to the development
models that have thus far prevailed, primarily
in the industrialized countries, we call for
action to renew multilateral co-operation. That
will be the means of stopping the ecological
deterioration and overcoming poverty. It is
imperative, through this kind of international
co-operation, to establish effective procedures
for transferring more funds and appropriate
technology to the developing countries on pre¬
ferential, non-commercial terms, bearing in
mind that the responsibility for a solution
should fall basically to those who are doing the
most damage	
In the face of poverty, war, intolerance,
famine, illness, environmental degradation and
ignorance, we propose a new culture of inter¬
national co-operation as the only path to a just
and stable world. We understand this to mean
genuine, concerted action which takes account
of the common interests and objectives of the
Ibero-American nations and which goes
beyond mere give-and-take relations	
Only an international community governed
by law can ensure peace and security for all
peoples. The United Nations will have an
essential role to play in that area a revitalized
and renewed United Nations whose attain¬
ment of the goals for which it was created
should be facilitated by the new international
situation.
The strengthening of the bases of interna¬
tional coexistence and justice in conformity
with the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations is a responsibi¬
lity which must be shared by all states; it is not
the exclusive prerogative of a few. That pro¬
cess should be open to universal participation
and should uphold the interests of the interna¬
tional community as a whole. We are resolved
to make our contribution	
In order to achieve the above-mentioned



objectives, we have decided to institute a dia¬
logue among the countries of Ibero-America at
the highest level. The Heads of State and
Government, meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico,
have decided to establish the Ibero-American
Conference of Heads of State and Government
consisting of the Spanish- and Portuguese-
speaking sovereign states of America and
Europe. To that end we shall meet initially in
Spain next year, in Brazil in 1993, in Colombia
in 1994 and in Argentina in 1995. These
meetings will enable us to embark on a poli¬
tical, economic and cultural process which will
help our countries together to achieve greater
and more efficient integration in a changing
global context. O

rHE Letters of Amerigo Vespucci were
published at a time early in the six¬
teenth century when printing was
becoming widespread in Europe, making it
possible for ancient Greek and Latin manus¬
cripts to be reproduced and studied for the first
time, and thereby ushering in the Renaissance.
In them, Vespucci writes of new worlds popu¬
lated by hitherto unknown beings and crea¬
tures, which cast serious doubt on such emi¬
nent works as Ptolemy's Cosmography,
published in Rome in 1478, the Historia plan-
tarum of Theophrastus, published in Venice in
1498, and even Aristotle's Mechanics.
A vast body of knowledge, painstakingly built
up over the centuries, had to be subjected to a
searching reappraisal. Many long-held proposi¬
tions and assumptions turned out to be false,
while others were proved correct. Most had to be
brought up to date. There was a crisis but at the
same time it compelled a radical rethinking, her¬
alding an age that was open to all manner of intel¬
lectual curiosity and capable of imagining a uni¬
verse composed of a variety of differing worlds.
Fresh ways of representing human beings and
the world they lived in had to be devised. The
humanists began to speak of universality and
humanity, a new concept for designating a world
inhabited by men and women who were similar
yet also different. This idea of humanity marked
the beginning of the modern age in the West and
gradually imposed a new imago mundi.
THE NOBLE SAVAGE
However, these new ideas were by no means
accepted by everybody and it was a long time
before they gained wide currency. Sceptics in
the universities poured scorn on the accounts
of the extraordinary discoveries of the Spanish
and Portuguese navigators and treated them as
baseless figments of their imagination. In 1512,
the scholar Alessandro Achillini was still
teaching that the Equator was a barren and
unpopulated desert region. In 1539, J. Boemus
published his Recueil des diverses histoires des
trois parties du monde, a work whose very title
denies the existence of America, although this
did not prevent it from being regularly studied
and republished until the seventeenth century.
Vespucci's Letters were not alone in cap¬
turing the imagination of Europeans. The wri¬
tings of the explorers and conquistadors began to
circulate discreetly in the royal courts of Europe,
among shipowners and thinkers. Columbus's
correspondence with the Catholic Monarchs
gave a first-hand word-picture of the peoples of
America as being handsome, good-natured, free
and uninterested in material things, as though
they were living in an age of innocence.
This impression was borne out by Vespucci,
when he wrote: "They have no captain to lead
them and do not march in step, for every man
is his own master. . . . They have no king or
chief and they answer to nobody. They live in
complete freedom". This first impression of the
indigenous peoples of the Caribbean gave rise
to the myth of the noble savage, the first Euro¬
pean legend about the New World.
This first image of "the Other" had a consi¬
derable impact. Rabelais wrote with a mixture
of curiosity and admiration of the Indians
"who prize a piece of iron more highly than a
gold nugget", and the ideas set forth in Mon¬
taigne's Essays about people with different cul¬
tures and customs made a pioneering contribu¬
tion to comparative anthropology.
It would be possible to speak of two forms
of rational thinking or two systems of develop¬
ment, each trying to grasp what the other is
saying but constantly getting bogged down in
misunderstanding.
The idea of the "natural" condition of the
Indian as merely being an extension of the state
of nature gave rise to a discriminatory and
inegalitarian ideology so influential that it
prompted a thinker like Hegel to deny the his¬
torical dimension of American man, as though
pre-Columbian America belonged to the realm
of nature rather than to that of reason.
The myth of the noble savage died hard,
although it was soon paralleled by that of Eldo¬
rado, whereby America was imagined to be a
land of precious gems, the horn of plenty and
eternal youth, the garden chosen by Providence
to feed the rest of the world.
FROM ELDORADO
TO THE BLACK LEGEND
Another myth, known as the black legend, was
soon to emerge. Under its seemingly innocuous
exterior, the image of Eldorado as a Garden of
Eden concealed the grim reality of the large-
scale exploitation of the New World's gold and
silver mines to fill the coffers of Europe. The
French economist and politician Raymond
Barre has rightly recalled that this gold was the
basis for the commercial power of Europe,
brought mercantilism into fashion, and was
instrumental in the founding of banks in
Lyons, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and
Seville, and in the opening of the first stock
exchanges. It made possible the extraordinary
commercial and entrepreneurial activity which
shaped the destiny of Europe. The myth of
Eldorado closed people's eyes to the heavy toll
of Indian lives that was taken in wresting gold
and silver from the bowels of the earth.
In 1533, Father Bartolomé de Las Casas
caused a sensation when he published in Seville
with the authorization of the King of Spain his
celebrated Apologética historia sumaria (Apolo¬
getic History), in which he fiercely denounced
the abuses perpetrated by the conquistadors.
This polemical work, which was approved by
those responsible for propagating the black
legend, aroused great interest in Europe. It had
an enormous influence on humanists, the phi¬
losophers of the Enlightenment and the ideolo¬
gists of the French Revolution.
However, the turn of the century saw the 39

Vega's Comentarios Reales.
publication of another book that was to have
even greater influence on shaping Europe's image
of America. This was the Comentarios Reales of
the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, which was pub¬
lished in Lisbon in 1609. The feelings of compas¬
sion which Las Casas had aroused in his Euro¬
pean readers turned to admiration for the culture
and society elegantly described by the Inca Garci¬
laso. In this well-thought-out, methodical and
balanced view of the Inca Empire, America is
seen in a new light. Garcilaso's Comentarios can
be said to have left its mark on all the leading
European thinkers and writers of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries.
THE LAST TESTAMENT
Why was Garcilaso's account so appealing and
fascinating to European readers? He was born
in Cuzco, the capital of the Inca Empire, in
1539, five years after the city had fallen into
Spanish hands. As a high-born mestizo he

generation of Latin American
writers and thinkers. His
recent publications include:

was the son of an Inca princess and a distin¬
guished Spanish captain from early childhood
he was taught Latin and given a literary and
scientific education. Yet at the same time, he
was well placed to witness the tragic collapse of
the Inca Empire. Every evening he listened
spell-bound to the stories recounted by the
members of his mother's family about the glo¬
ries of the Inca past and he attended some of
the ritual ceremonies that had survived the Spa¬
nish conquest. When he was twenty-one, he
travelled to Spain to complete his studies and
claim his hereditary rights. He then embarked
on a military and literary career. On retiring to
Montilla and subsequently to Córdoba, he
spent his time reading the Greek classics and
Roman historians and took a keen interest in
agriculture, music and architecture. He closely
followed the publication of the chronicles of
the Indies, in which he found many errors and
misrepresentations, and resolved to write the

### 91219: The Birth of the modern age

Comentarios to correct the accounts of earlier
writers and to "clarify and elaborate on many
things of which they had barely begun to speak
or had left unsaid".
He therefore embarked on the daunting task
of historical reconstruction in order to demon¬
strate to the Spanish and Europeans that the
Incas "were civilized and not barbarians" and to
dissuade Spain from using the force of arms to
rule a nation which had already suffered military
defeat and whose outstanding culture deserved to
be treated with proper consideration.
After the Spanish edition had first appeared
in 1609, translations were published in French
(1633), English (1688) and Dutch (1705). These
were followed by many later editions, including
an abridged version in French in 1744, complete
with copious annotations and commentaries by
leading scholars and travellers of the Enlighten¬
ment. A learned and rewarding dialogue took
place symbolically between the Inca Garcilaso
and La Condamine, Godin, Frézier and many
others.
Garcilaso introduced Europe to the Inca
Empire, with its unbending social organization,
its collective agrarian system and strict mono¬
theism, and its achievements in agriculture, irriga¬
tion, architecture, urban development, the domes¬
tication of plants and animals, and the fastidious
workmanship of its jewellery and woven fabrics.
This picture he painted of a planned egalita¬
rian society, coming under the authority of an
all-powerful State, was a source of wonder to the
Utopian thinkers and reformers of the seven¬
teenth and eighteenth centuries. Europe, in its
thirst for social justice and reform, saw Inca
society as proof that a different form of society
was possible and that the redistribution of goods
and wealth was not an unattainable dream. The
"New World" had succeeded in forging a new
relationship between people, nature and the state.
FROM REFLECTION TO REALITY
The view of the Incas presented by Garcilaso
can be found in Campanella, in Bacon and in,
Morelly, the French Utopian thinker whose
Code la Nature (1753) was to influence the
thinkers of the French Revolution and the Uto¬
pian socialists of the nineteenth century. Garci¬
laso also left a mark on Montesquieu, Voltaire
(whose play Alzire is set in Peru), Rousseau,
Marmontel (who wrote a historical novel
drawing heavily on the work of Las Casas and
the Inca Garcilaso) and Rameau (the composer
of the famous opera-ballet Les Indes galantes).
All these philosophers, moralists, political think¬
ers, artists, poets and musicians, whether they
were monarchists or members of the bour¬
geoisie, found in the Incas and their social orga¬
nization a source of inspiration or a means of
giving voice to their own aspirations. The
"Other" was no longer a mere reflection of
their own image but had become an intrinsic
part of the European vision.

Academy of Lyons held an essay competition on
the resolutely universalist subject of "The
influence of the discovery of America on the hap¬
piness of the human race". Many of the essays
submitted reflected the teachings of Garcilaso,
especially that of the winner, the Abbé Genty,
which set him at the heart of the debate that trig¬
gered off the Revolution. Genty considered that
collective ownership had made the Incas a
contented people, but that the lack of any form of
private property had sapped their social structure
and had ultimately led to the collapse of their
empire.
And so America, that "other" world whose
peoples, landscapes and culture were all so diffe¬
rent, found itself in the midst of another histo¬
rical process, the French Revolution, which in
turn sent to America its own universalist mes¬
sage embodying innovative ideas drawn from
Las Casas and Garcilaso. The wheel had come
full circle and was starting to turn again. O

### 91220: The Invention of a culture

The invention
of a culture
By Leopoldo Zea
«
Five centuries since the shock of
conquest have seen the creation of
an American identity based on
racial and cultural intermingling

^ 18th century. 1967
DISCOVERY? Encounter? Conquest? Colo¬
nization? Many more such words could
be cited, but the one people choose will
depend on their point of view. For Europe the
event to which they refer was an expression of its
need to project itself outward by imagining Uto¬
pian worlds. Columbus's voyage brought such
worlds into the realm of the possible. As Fernand
Braudel put it, America is the invention of
Europe: "Did it not discover and invent America
and celebrate Columbus's voyage as the greatest
historical event since the Creation? . . . Europe
patiently created America in an image and a like¬
ness that gave substance to its desires."'
America was the realization of the utopias of
More, Bacon, Campanella and many others.
Europe reborn projected itself into the world
Columbus discovered. The most complete
expression of this phenomenon was North Am¬
erica, the United States, where the European
peoples' dreams of freedom became reality. There,
it is easy for Europe not only to commemorate
but to rejoice in the realization of long-felt aspira¬
tions: Europe and North America can celebrate
their own specific universalization in history.
The process of conquest and colonization
initiated by Columbus in 1492 was something
quite different. The region in which it took
place was something more than vast open
spaces inhabited by wandering tribes. Unlike
the Puritans who arrived later on the May¬
flower, the men who followed Columbus
found themselves face to face with people
whose cultures were different from their own
and changed their view of the world. This was
why it was necessary not only to enslave the
bodies of these people but to take possession of
their souls. The Puritans who settled the prai¬
ries of North America felt no such need to
impose their culture, religion and habits on
those whom they regarded as unconcerned by
such matters. Thus there were two quite diffe¬
rent forms of expansion: one involved the
conquest of bodies and souls while the other
was content to domesticate the natural
resources of a new world and the people living
there, who were regarded as part of Nature.
The Iberian expansion initiated by
Columbus was a response to mercantile consi¬
derations, but it also reflected an obligation to
preach the Gospel. Had Columbus met the
Great Khan of Cathay, he would certainly have
attempted to convert his subjects to Christia¬
nity. Unlike its counterpart in North America,
the Iberian conquest set out not only to amass
wealth but to save souls. There was greed on
both sides, but in a bid to curb the greed of the
Spanish, the missionaries set out to understand
the peoples they encountered and wanted to
welcome them into the bosom of Christianity.
Since they wished to conquer souls, they
first had to destroy the heathen cultures
imposed by the devil, or at least push them out
of sight. They organized mass baptisms,
although these ran counter to the views held by
Father Bartolomé de Las Casas (1474-1566),
who argued that the indigenous peoples were
capable of rational thought and should first be
intellectually convinced of the truth of Chris-

tianity. In order to save their souls, a "just war"
would be waged against them, and they would
pay the price by serving masters who would
have been justified in exterminating them
because of their barbarity. As Juan Ginés de
Sepúlveda (1490-1573) said: "What fate could
be more fitting for these barbarians than to be
the subjects of an empire whose qualities of
prudence and uprightness can make civilized
people of them?" What should they give in
exchange? It was only right, he continued, that
"they should pay for the endeavours devoted
to redeeming them by working for the masters
to whom they had been entrusted." Bartolomé
de Las Casas and other missionaries denounced
the falsity of this argument and the genocide
perpetrated in its name.
It was no mere coincidence that two far-
reaching historical events the fall of Granada
and the discovery of America should have
both occurred in 1492. The surrender of Gra¬
nada marked the completion of the reconquest
of Spain and the end of Arab dominion, which
dated back to the year 711. Those eight centuries
of dominion taught the inhabitants of the penin¬
sula to live side by side with other races and civi¬
lizations and produced the men who were to
spread far and wide through the unknown
continent. In spite of arrogance, greed, and the
atrocities that, incidentally, the Spanish them¬
selves were the first to condemn, there would be
racial intermingling in the New World.
During the colonial period, the Spanish
attempted to impose their culture on the van¬
quished peoples, but the latter turned the tables
on their conquerors through countless forms of
cultural and racial cross-fertilization. African
peoples uprooted from their homes to perform
the thankless work that had decimated the ori¬
ginal population would later contribute their
blood and their cultures to those of Ibero-Am-
erica. Later still, other peoples and cultures would
come to be added to this gigantic melting pot.
In this year of 1992, five hundred years after
Columbus's exploit, America is not commemo¬
rating an event that marked the beginning of its
servitude but its significance in shaping the conti¬
nent's special identity. Latin America cannot
repudiate its past, for there was a clash of cultures
between the conquerors and the conquered. But
there was also coexistence and give and take. As
José Vasconcelos put it: "It is in the mingling of
blood and cultures that we must look for the true
features of our individuality." O

### 91221: Five hundred years from now

Five hundred
44
THIS is a year of great historical significance,
since it enables us to look back and take stock
of a remarkable series of events which took
place 500 years ago. The passage of time has brought
a new perspective on these events, the effects of
which can now be fully appreciated. The capture of
Granada on 2 January 1492 by the Reyes Católicos
the "Catholic Monarchs" as Ferdinand and Isabella
were known had a European-wide impact. Spain
had abstained from taking part in the Crusades and
had instead devoted its energies to its own reunifica¬
tion. When engaged on research in the archives of
Genoa, I came across a decree signed by the Doge of
that maritime republic ordering that the taking of
Granada should be celebrated not only with the
usual artillery salute but with a three-day holiday.
On 31 March the Edict expelling the Jews was
signed. And Spain, the melting pot of European and
Mediterranean cultures which she transmitted to the
western hemisphere, has the privilege of having been
named by Arabs and Jews in their own languages as
Al-Andalus and Sefarad, respectively.
Had these two historical events, with their far-
reaching geographical and political consequences,
not taken place, Christopher Columbus would pro¬
bably have not been able to secure the signature by
the King and Queen on 17 April 1492 of the Capi¬
tulaciones de Santa Fe, that extraordinary contract
(or so it seems today), between a government and a
private individual who demanded advance recogni¬
tion of his rights to something which no-one yet
knew existed. Without this agreement, Christopher
Columbus and the Pinzón brothers would not have
been able to fit out the three vessels in which they
set sail from Palos, in Huelva province, on 2 August
and lost sight of land off La Gomera, in the Canary
Islands, on 9 September.
In his letter of 15 February 1493 to the Catholic
Kings, Columbus reported that, after thirty-three
days' sailing, he had made landfall on the previous 12
October, the date that has since been regarded as that
of the birth of a New World through the encounter
between the indigenous peoples of America and
voyagers from the old continent. Apparently,
however, Columbus's discovery did not make the
same impact as the capture of Granada: in the
Genoese archives I was unable to find any trace of a
reaction to his exploit, although the letter describing
it had circulated widely in Europe. Of course this
does not necessarily mean that the event had not
been reported, especially in view of the relations that
then existed between Genoa and Barcelona, where
the Catholic Kings received Columbus on his return
to the peninsula after his first great voyage.
Little must have been known in Genoa of the
approaches made to European monarchs by
Columbus, who, it is true, had more links with Por¬
tugal than with his native city. How different was
the impact of the letter sent later to Florence by
Amerigo Vespucci, then in the service of Spain,
which was so considerable that the name of the Flo¬
rentine navigator would be given to the newly-dis¬
covered lands. Columbus had little influence on the
political life of the Republic of Genoa, where he was
only remembered many years later.
A GRAMMAR FOR AN EMPIRE
It would scarcely have been possible for
Columbus's caravels to have taken with them the
"Grammar of the Castilian language" which Elio
Antonio de Nebrija published at Salamanca on 18
August. The date is worth mentioning, because if
Nebrija thought that a language can play a role in
strengthening an Empire, he was of course thinking
of the Holy Roman Empire and certainly not of the
Spanish Empire, which did not then exist.
It is also sometimes forgotten that Nebrija's
monumental work, the fruit of many years' study,
was on a language that had already existed for 500
years. Today, fortunately, the language has ceased to
be an instrument of domination and has become a
vehicle of international co-operation and solidarity.
This year, Spanish-speakers will have the satisfaction
of seeing their age-old language being used for the
first time officially at a World Fair, EXPO 92 at
Seville, a city dear to the heart of Nebrija.
If the modern communications media had
existed at that time, what account might have come
down to us of the events of 1492, that annus
mirabilis which saw Spain transformed into a
modern nation-state like France and England, if
only because the political union concluded between
Castile and Aragon was extended to lands whose
size and importance were still unknown, and were
seen in terms of a logic specific to Europe at that
time which nothing seemed likely to contradict. It
would have been fascinating to know how the Taino
Indians reacted to their discovery of Columbus and
to the arrival of men whose apparel and customs
were so unlike theirs.
Of all these events, and the many others that
occurred in Europe in the same year, the discovery
of a new continent was to have the greatest geogra¬
phical, scientific and historical impact. As Seneca
had predicted, Thule would no longer mark the end
of the Earth. The European countries with an
Atlantic seaboard began to compete with each other
overseas. Spain and Portugal would carve up much
of the New World between them, and England and
France would contend with each other for the north
of the continent. Curiously, these voyages of dis¬
covery, which were prompted by political and, later,
by economic imperatives, did not all have the same
impact on Europe. Much time would elapse before
historical and geographical atlases took full account
of the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of explora¬
tion. Columbus's landing on the island of Guaha-
nani was profoundly important, but the dreaded
crossing of the African Equator was no less so. It is
accepted today that 1492 can only be seen in the
context of the maritime expansion of the Iberian
peoples in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a
process whose effects were so far-reaching that they
can still be felt five centuries later. One need only
think of the exhibition UNESCO organized last
spring on the theme of "The Encounter between

YEARS FROM NOW
By Félix Fernández-Shaw
Two Worlds in the Written Word," in which over a
thousand recently published volumes in many lan¬
guages were presented to mark the fifth centenary.
To the best of my knowledge this encounter was
commemorated for the first time on its fourth cente¬
nary. On that occasion the Uruguayan Minister Ple-
nipoteniary, Zorrilla de San Martín, speaking in the
name of the Ibero-American diplomatic corps as a
whole, made a speech at Palos which is still remem¬
bered. At the same time the important Raccolta
colombina was appearing in Italy, while in the
United States too, on the initiative of Italians, the
anniversary of 12 October 1492 was celebrated for
the first time. Today the time is ripe to make an
assessment of all the studies that have been pub¬
lished on the subject, including a number of docu¬
ments that have recently come to light, and to relate
them to the age in which we live. It is both
constructive and necessary to examine certain
aspects of history more closely.
In my opinion, however, it would be wrong to
dwell exclusively on what has happened between
then and now. I reel that we should also think about
the future and ask ourselves how future generations
will judge us in 500 years' time. Shall we have been
capable of taking the giant strides needed for history
and humanity to move ahead, or shall we have clung
to our old ways, forgetting that they can only
remain valid if they are geared to the future and
thus have fallen victim to a historicist narcissism
which it is hard to excuse?
For the history of international relations no
event has ever been so rich in consequences as the
encounter between two worlds. Christopher
Columbus used the word "discovery" in his letter
to the Catholic Kings and it has been accepted ever
since as being perfectly normal by generations of
teachers and students on both sides ofthe Atlantic.
From discovery to encounter
Since that time perceptions of the world have
changed, as can be seen from the fact that one fea¬
ture of this fifth centenary is a preoccupation with
the "Other". In the context of an age dominated by
communication it is essential to listen to and respect
the "Other". The encounter between two worlds is
a fact that cannot be denied. It is clearly something
that transcends the notion of discovery which
(whether we are thinking in terms of geography,
biology or chemistry) is invariably associated with a
specific date, and needs to be complemented by the
more timeless concept of encounter, which implies a
continuing process. On the eve of the third millen¬
nium, this is a concept that is attractive to all
concerned, since it expresses a common desire for
unity and integration that, with all due respect to
minorities and their past, opens the way to dialogue
and harmony.
The word discovery gives prominence to the
heroes of the enterprise; the word encounter gives
more emphasis to the peoples who actually
"encountered" each other and gave substance to a
New World. Whereas discovery marks a happening,
an event, encounter conveys better the idea of the
political journey that has brought us to the reality of
today, spanning the five hundred years since 1492.
As I have written elsewhere: "Every commemo¬
ration has both an historical and a political meaning.
It is not enough simply to recall an event, all its
implications must also be thrown into relief, since,
generally speaking, we remember only what is
important. We always associate an event with a date
for this is how we pass it on to the next generation.
A commemoration is a historical act since it forms
part of a chain of events. These historical and poli¬
tical milestones are valuable because they relate the
present to both the past and the future." It was
inevitable that history written from a Eurocentric
standpoint should speak in terms of discovery and it
is equally inevitable that, as history has now come
to be seen in universal terms, we should have
adopted so evocative a term as encounter.
What legacy shall we hand down to the genera¬
tion living five hundred years from now? What pro¬
gress will have been made between now and then to
understanding how people live and what their aspi¬
rations are? What contribution will those who cele¬
brate the sixth, seventh or eighth centenaries make
to the complex pattern of historical and political
developments? Will the attempts made today to
achieve a better understanding of the events of 1492
be of any interest five centuries hence? Take as an
example my own country in which it took so much
effort and such great sacrifice to restore democracy
and to work out a Constitution that would bring all
Spaniards together. Who would have thought that,
before 1992, Spain would have altered its political
and historical dimension by espousing the cause of a
European Community, or that, on 1 January 1993,
she will turn the page on ancient rivalries? Who
would have thought that in July 1991, for the first
time in their common history, the Heads of State
and of Government of the Spanish- and Portuguese-
speaking countries would hold an Ibero-American
summit conference at Guadalajara, Mexico? Who
would have thought that, before the end of 1991,
Arabs and Jews would meet in Madrid for a peace
conference and would return after so many years, to
discuss their problems on soil once so familiar to
them?
Some anniversaries cannot be overlooked, for
they form part and parcel of the history of peoples.
Even so, we should take advantage of them to bring
the event being commemorated into sharper focus
against its particular political and social background.
For myself, I should prefer to be thinking of the 500
years that lie ahead. We must go forward with a
greater awareness of the past but in the full know¬
ledge that we in the present have to look to the
future. The anniversary of 1492 will come round
again in a hundred years' time and it will again be
imperative to take stock, for history constantly has
to be rewritten. It is up to us to ensure that the event
is an ever-richer source of hope. The year 1992 can
only make sense if we find in it a justification for the
future. G

Unesco
and the fifth
centenary
uNESCO is commemorating 1492 with two projects:
Amerindia 92 seeks to create opportunities for reflection and dialogue
with the indigenous peoples of America, with a view to establishing new
forms of intercultural relationships. Two meetings have already been held
in Ottawa (Canada, November 1991) and in San Cristóbal de las Casas
(Mexico, June 1991), and others are scheduled to take place in Oaxaca
(Mexico, September 1992), in the Caribbean countries and in South
America. An Amerindian film festival will be held in June at UNESCO
Headquarters in Paris, and will be followed by an exhibition of photo¬
graphs, concerts featuring Latin American music, and a series of lectures.
A Series of Encounters is a project designed to illustrate the universal
scope and richness of the exchanges between the cultures of the indige¬
nous peoples of the continent and islands, of the Europeans and of the
Africans and Asians from whose fusion new nations emerged. On 8 May
UNESCO is sponsoring a literary competition on the theme of "extraordi¬
nary travellers" at the St. Malo (France) Book Festival. In the same month
a symposium is being held under UNESCO's auspices at Praia (Cape Verde)
on "The Encounter between Two Worlds: the African contribution and
its repercussions".
These activities and many more publications, seminars and cultural
events are all designed to encourage the widest possible participation in
the commemoration of an event which profoundly marked the course of
human history. They are also intended to give a new picture of the possi¬
bilities of cultural pluralism and cross-fertilization, and to show the
contribution that America has made and continues to make to the rest of
the world. D
Unesco at EXPO 92
One hundred and ten countries and hundreds of artists
from all over the world are participating in Expo 92,
the World Fair which opened at Seville, Spain, on 20
April. It is estimated that eighteen million people will
have visited the Fair before the gates close for the last
time, on 12 October. In the year of the five hundredth
anniversary of the first encounter between Europe and
America, Expo 92 has taken as its theme the Age of
Discovery and provides a fascinating panorama of the
evolution of human knowledge. UNESCO has co-ordi¬
nated the participation of the entire United Nations
system in this event.
Built thanks to the sponsorship of the Bank of
Bilbao Vizcaya and of the Spanish authorities, the
United Nations pavilion has been allotted an attractive
site beside an artificial lake. Designed by the Spanish
architect José Ramón Rodríguez Gautier, the thou¬
sand-metre-square building takes the form of a cube of
glass and concrete, representing humanity, within a
double-structured metal quarter of a sphere symboli¬
zing the universe.
Some six hundred visitors an hour will make their
way through a series of rooms where information
panels outline activities of the thirty-seven specialized
agencies of the United Nations family. Then follows,
on a succession of video screens, a film featuring a car¬
toon of an extraterrestrial creature who arrives by
chance on our planet and is first pleased by its natural
beauty and then horrified by the misery caused by pol¬
lution, war and disease. Finally the creature sees an
answer to the problem in the form of international
solidarity, expressed notably in the action of the
United Nations. The motto of the United Nations
pavilion is "Creating a Better World". _

Ecuador. Movements outward from Latin America are also explored:
Nicaraguan paintings in Denmark, Chilean art in Stockholm and
pre-Columbian inspiration in the works of Joan Miró.
