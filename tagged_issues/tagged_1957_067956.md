REVOLUTION IN
LIBERIA'S SCHOOLS
Thirty miles west of Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
lies the village of Klaythe end of a two-hour jeep
ride over dirt roads and through jungle fords. Klay
reckons its population simply as "two hundred and
fifty huts", but it is the capital of a district where a
slow revolution in education is taking place. Since
I 952 it has been the centre of a joint Unesco-Liberia
project to introduce modern methods of fundamental
educationfrom health and hygiene measures, agri¬
culture, reading and writing, to needlework, domestic
science and homecraftinto the district's bush
villages. Above, two of Klay Centre staff discuss the
building of a school with the people of Godi, a typical
bush village. Under its technical assistance pro¬
gramme Unesco has also sent specialists to form the
nucleus of the new science faculty at the University
of Monrovia, and has organized a teacher training
programme. Left, students attending a teacher

SPIRITUAL ANCESTOR OF UNESCO
When last November the Czechoslovak delegation to
the ninth session of Unesco's General Conference
held in the capital of India proposed that this
Organization be associated "with the celebration of the
three hundredth anniversary of the publication of John
Amos Comenius' Didáctica Opera Omnia, by publishing a
volume of his selected "works, the resolution was voted
unanimously not only by the programme commission but
by the plenary session of the conference. Such unanimity,
rarely achieved in intergovernmental assemblies, is more
eloquent than any commentary.
It testifies to the common will of 79 member states of
Unesco to celebrate, at the same time as the Czech nation
is doing so, a memorable date on which there appeared,
among his other works, The Great Didactic, today recog¬
nized as the first complete presentation of a science of
education and the inception of modern theories of
teaching.
Why is it that Unesco has deemed it so important to
take part in the celebration of this anniversary? It is in¬
teresting to quote a few axioms from The Great Didactic
and The Pampaedia (The Education of All) which might
well be inscribed at the head of the principal chapters of
Unesco's programme.
"'Just as the whole world is a school for the whole of the
human race, from the beginning of time until the very
end, so all life is á school for every man, from the cradle
to the grave." Is this not the Unesco principle of never-
ending education, the education of adults as well as youth?
"First of all, it is essential that all persons learn to read
and write." Is this not the motto of the struggle against
illiteracy?
"All young people of both sexes should be sent to public
schools/' Is this not what Unesco has translated as the
development of universal, free and compulsory primary
education?
"No one should be excluded, even less prevented, from
pursuing wisdom and cultivating the mind." Is this not
the principle of equal access to education and culture,
without distinction of race, fortune, creed or social origin?
And did not Comenius go so far as to conceive of a
"Council of Light," an international organization for
education, science and culture, which represents a distant
préfiguration of Unesco?
These ideas, spread across a receptive Europe three hun¬
dred years ago by the great precursor, have lost nothing
of their force or their efficacy. But though they are
commonly accepted in our time they are far from being
an established fact. A gigantic effort still remains to be
made, by all peoples uniting their resources, so that they
are ultimately applied by all institutions and for all man¬
kind the world over.
It is because his message is still so timely that Unesco,
in response to the wish expressed by the Czechoslovak
nation, is attempting to make Comenius better known and
appreciated. Unesco's contribution on this occasion is
designed as an homage of respect and gratitude towards
a man whom it recognizes as its spiritual ancestor.

Apostle ot modern
education and of
world understanding
by Marie-Madeleine Rabecq
Curator of the Musée Pédagogique, Paris
Just three hundred years ago, in 1657, there appeared
in Amsterdam the first complete edition of the didactic
works of a Moravian bishop-philosopher named John
Amos Comenius, regarded by his contemporaries as one.
of the greatest minds of his epoch.
His Didáctica Opera Omnia, as the work was entitled
was to have the most far-reaching influence on the think¬
ing of educators from the 17th century up to the present
day and the principles of his philosophy were to be
reflected in the major plans elaborated in the course of
the past centuries to achieve peace and international
collaboration in the world.
Yet the name of Comenius was to remain practically
unknown in most countries for some 200 years. Although
a Letter on "Comenius the Humanitarian" by the German
thinker Johann G. Herder appeared in 1795, and a few
essays were published in Germany, England and the
United States between 1828 and 1868 on the life and work
of this great educational reformer, little came of these
efforts.
It was not until 1871, the bicentenary of Comenius'
death, that an international movement of any size took
form and resulted in the foundation of the first "Comenius
Societies" and the translation of his works into different
languages. Since then the name of Comenius has grown
steadily in international stature until today he is recogniz¬
ed as the father of the science of education and one of the
great apostles of the brotherhood of men and nations.
This year the world of education is celebrating the three
hundredth anniversary of the publication of his didactic
works, particularly The Great Didactic.
In commemoration of this occasion Unesco has just
published a volume containing selections from Comenius'
major works (1) ; a film strip on Comenius has been
completed for use in schools, and Unesco's quarterly
review Museum has published a special study on the
Comenius Museum at Uhersky Brod, where he spent
much of his childhood and early youth (2). Comenius
scholars from many lands recently met in Czechoslovakia
at an international congress to reassess the importance
of the Moravian thinker in modern life.

educational writings, the influence he has had on

modern educational thinking all help to explain the
considerable efforts now being made to make Comenius
better known to both the general public and specialists
alike. The mass of Comenius' writings our knowledge
of which has been greatly enriched by the . discov¬
eries of the group now working at the Comenius
Institute in Prague is a highly complex and original
body of material from which we have still much to learn.
But the guiding ideas of Comenius' system and their true
significance are difficult to appreciate fully without some
prior knowledge of his life. Comenius' life and. work are
as closely interwoven as his ideas on world brotherhood
and his religious precepts are inseparable from his
educational reforms.

little town in Moravia (today Czechoslovakia). His father,
a miller, belonged to the Moravian Brethren, a Protes¬
tant sect following the teachings of Jan Huss, and sent
the boy to a parish school at Uhersky Brod. Orphaned
at an early age he was shipped off to Stranice, at the time
a terribly war-ravaged area, where he was placed in the
care of an aunt and began manual training in accordance
with the Moravian Brethren custom. It was not until he
was 16 that he began his secondary education and learned
to read Latin. He later travelled to Herborn in Nassau,
Germany, for his higher studies where he worked under
the guidance of two remarkable teachers, Johann Fischer
and Johann-Heinrich Alsted.
This first period in Comenius' life the period of his
intellectual formation was to have a decisive influence
on his later philosophical and educational views. From
the Moravian Brethren he was to learn the deep sense of
religion, the dignity of labour and the importance of help¬
ing one's neighbour which formed the basis of their
doctrine along with their love for their native Bohemia.
From Herborn, his efforts to make up for lost school time
and his unpleasant memories of the ill-organized schools
inspired him to look toward improved methods of teaching
and for a school system accessible to everyone.
It was at this period that he conceived the plan for his
Linguae Bohemicae Thesaurus, "a complete glossary fol¬
lowed by an exact grammar of elegant phrases, figures of
speech and proverbs" such as existed in no other language.
The ardour of his patriotism and his sorrow at seeing so
many of his countrymen neglect the Czech language led
him at the same time to compile an encyclopedia which
he called the Amphitheatrum Universitati Rerum. Thus
Comenius while still a young student was instrumental in
making Czech a literary language and in this respect his
role in his own country can be considered analogous to
that of Calvin in France and Luther in Germany.
The Thirty Years' War and its terrible aftermath were
to give a new orientation to Comenius' thinking. In 1618
he was serving as pastor at Fulnek, Moravia, when the
town was captured and put to the torch. Comenius'
manuscripts and entire library were destroyed. Then his
wife and children died, victims of a plague epidemic. As
a Protestant preacher he was proscribed by the Counter-
Reformation party which had triumphed throughout the
lands of the Bohemian crown. For ten years he lived in
hiding in remote districts of Bohemia, before leaving his
country for ever.
Accompanied by Moravian Brethren
followers he fled to Poland, taking refuge
in the town of Leszno where he was named
headmaster of the secondary school. It was
at Leszno that he began his extensive
Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris-UNESCO filmstrip, "Comenius"
1657-1957. A great collection of didactic works entitled
Didáctica Opera Omnia was published In Amsterdam in 1657.
The works had been written some thirty years earlier In
the Czech language by J.A. Comenius, while the author was
still living In his native Moravia. This year the third cen¬
tenary of the publication In Latin of this volume Is being
celebrated throughout the world. (Below, an original copy of
the volume). Comenius was one of the first men to propagate
the ideas which Unesco took for its guidance at the time
of its establishment. Above, frontispiece of the volume

centenary, the Czechoslovak Government has minted a

correspondence with scholars in foreign countries and
wrote some of his major works. In addition to The Great
Didactic, he produced the Labyrinth of the World and the
Paradise of the Heart, a Guide for Infant Schools, and his
lanua Linguarum Reserata which was so successful that
ii was translated into twelve European languages, into
Arabic, Turkish, Persian and Mongolian, and soon won him
world renown.
He was working on his Prodromus Pansophiae (a work
on education which attempted to organize all human
knowledge within the reach of everyone, and which
attracted the attention of Descartes) when he was invited
to go to England by Parliament to set up a College of
Universal Knowledge. But fate seems always to have been
against him. When he arrived in London, England was
on the verge of civil war and he found that the project
had been put off by Parliament. Comenius then accepted
another offer to reform Swedish schools which he had
received from a Swed¬
ish philanthropist,
Louis de Geer, who was
to be his lifelong pat¬
ron and friend. Again
dogged by misfortune,
however, he resumed
his wandering life.
Named Bishop of the
Moravians, Comenius
returned to Leszno, but
in 1650 left for Saros
Patak in Hungary
where he hoped to
found a pansophic col¬
lege. He worked out a
plan for educational
reform but his efforts
were frustrated by the
lack of appropriate
textbooks and the
shortcomings of teach¬
ers and students alike.
It was at Saros Patak,
however, that he wrote
his famous Orbis
Pictus.
After a further peri¬
od at Leszno, during
which he again lost all
his property, Comenius,
now 65, once again
took up his pilgrim's
staff and set off for
Amsterdam by way of
Stettin and Hamburg
to stay with Laurenz de
Geer, the son of his
former patron.
It was during this last stage of his life that he succeeded
in publishing his complete didactic works under the title
Didáctica Opera Omnia ab anno 1627 et 1657 Continuata.
At the head of the great collection, Comenius placed his
monumental Didáctica Magna or Great Didactic. First
written in Czech, Comenius later translated The Great
Didactic into Latin. It is this version which first appeared
in print in 1657.
On November 15, 1670, Comenius died at Naarden, in the
Low Countries at the age of 78. He had written more than
140 works, travelled the length and breadth of Europe,
discussed his ideas with Descartes and Hartlib, formed
groups of disciples around him, and never relaxed in his
effort to apply everywhere he went the great principles
he had evolved during his lifetime.
Comenius' great principles concerning education stem
naturally from his conception of the world. For Comenius,
as for Rousseau a century later, man is capable of infinite
perfection, and education is the path that leads to his
development. Comenius believed that the one sure way
to the heart and confidence of a child was through love;
UNESCO filmstrip, "Comenius"
THE MASTER WILL STAND BEFORE THE CLASS on an elevated
platform, keeping the scholars in his sight, allowing none of them to
do anything but attend and look at him. Just like the sun he will send
his rays over them all, while the scholars must direct their ears, eyes
and thoughts towards him, and attend to everything that he tells them
by word of mouth or explains by means of his hand or of diagrams.
This, in part, was the solution proposed by Comenius to the problem,
"How can a single teacher teach a number of boys, no matter how great,
at one time?" In this engraving of an early ¡9th century classroom
the top-hatted teacher has brought out a pupil to continue the lesson.
that the one sure method of success in teaching was the
observation of nature and respect for its laws. He
advocated that school lessons be carefully adapted to the
different aptitudes of children and that a child's
spontaneity and dignity be fully respected. Whereas Eras¬
mus did not hesitate to recommend the use of the rod
(and even John Locke praised it as an educational ins¬
trument) Comenius denounced corporal punishment at a
time when it was so widely practised and so rigorously
administered that schoolchildren were sometimes left
permanently crippled.
Comenius did not envisage education only at school.
He saw it as beginning in early infancy, "the age when
learning is absorbed most naturally" and described the
education of pre-school children in his Informatorium
(Guide for Infant Schools). His Great Didactic and other
textbooks were designed for different school ages, and
he arrived, finally, at the conception of all human life as
a school, calling it the
Pampaedia (The Educa¬
tion of All).
Comenius went on
the postulate that
children are malleable
and flexible beings,
that as they develop
in body and mind their
horizons can be con¬
tinuously enriched and
expanded, but that to
develop a real sense of
awareness the teacher
must start with those
elements which the
child's senses can
grasp, and attempt
always to associate
"the word and object
referred to ." "Words,"
he said, "should be
taught and learned
only in association with
things for what are
words but the husks
and coverings of
things?"
"Whenever instruc¬
tion is given in any
language, even though
it be in the mother
tongue itself," Comen¬
ius wrote, "the words
must be explained by
showing the child * the
object denoted. 0:-.i the
other hand, everything
that the child sees,
hears, touches or tastes,
he must be taught to express in words, so that the
command of language and development of the mind pro¬
gress uniformly side by side." Thus Comenius in the 17th
century challenged the sterile verbalism prevalent in the
schools of his time, and was a forerunner of sensory educa¬
tion which has achieved notable results in our own day.
Since the acquisition of all knowledge presupposes some
effort of attention on the pupil's part, the Czech educator
stressed the idea that the child's attention would be
spurred by his natural interest in his immediate surround¬
ings and therefore condemned exercises in a vacuum in
favour of activity based on interest. "Do not undertake
any teaching," he wrote in his Great Didactic, "without
first arousing the interest of the pupil." And again :
"Always offer something which will be both agreeable and
useful; the pupils' minds will thus be prim¬
ed and they will come forward eagerly,
with ever-ready attention."
The development of the mind, Comenius
said, is based on a love of learning. "Before
setting about making of his pupil a

were not very different from the disorderly, unmethodical institu¬
tions satirically depicted by Breughel the Elder in his "Donkey
in the Classroom", about a century earlier. Realizing that the

ence of education. Though he does enter fully into practical
details he handles his subjects systematically. A school, he said,
should as far as possible be in a pleasant spot, green and shady
with gardens or trees and decorated with pictures. In school
architectural design and decoration today, (as shown by class¬
room below) the great educator's ideas have come to fruition.

THE 'ORBIS PICTUS'
WORLD'S ORIGINAL
PICTURE TEXTBOOK
Comenius was responsible for a brilliant innovation
when he added pictures to some of his books and dir¬
ectly linked word and ¡mage for education. His most
outstanding work In this field was the Orbis Sensua-
lium Pictus, an original kind of illustrated encyclo¬
pedia of human knowledge In the early 17th century.
To illustrate two of its chapters entitled "God" and
"The World" he used the engravings on the opposite
page (6 and 7). Numbering of the details in each
picture made the Orbis Pictus a school textbook
of a kind hitherto unknown. In the chapter on
"metals", for example, each object depicted in the draw¬
ing on the left-hand page (4) bears a number which
corresponds to the numbers and descriptions on the
opposite page. As this example shows, the Orbis
Pictus was also an illustrated Latin-German lexicon.
The two engravings from the chapter on "Man"
(2 and 5) show that this linking of the objects and
their descriptions was often done in great detail.
For the teaching of anatomy, Comenius was a firm
advocate of the maxim "seeing Is believing". He
called for "ocular demonstrations with organs such
as intestines, lungs, the heart and the liver, made of
leather and stuffed with wool". Plastic cutaway
models of the human body and its organs (I and 3),
which can be taken apart and handled by the class,
are modern versions of those proposed by Comenius.
Explaining how a dummy human body could be built
for teaching purposes, Comenius declared: "If you
take the student of medicine to this construction and
explain each part to him separately, he will grasp all
the details without any effort, and from that time forth
will understand this mechanism of his own body."

WORDS ARE BUT THE HUSKS OF THINGS
UNESCO filmstrip, "Comenius"
"Words," said Comenius, "should always be taught and learned In combination with
things... just like a tree with its bark and a fruit with its skin. For what are words
but the husks and coverings of things ?" In his illustrated textbook, Orbis Pictus, he
outlined a system for teaching children to read which resembles the "global method" widely used today. Following this system, the first pages of
Orbis Pictus show drawings of different animals and alongside each one the noise it makes. Modern education has absorbed much of his system.
Opposite page, two engravings from the same work. Above, left, illustrations from a present-day textbook. Modern out-of-school lessons such as
visits to places of Interest (above, right) were also recommended by Comenius: "In Spring they may be taken into the garden or into the country and
taught the various species of plants, vying with one another to see who can recognize the greater number." Below, in a Chicago Natural History
Museum showcase, scientists and artists have skilfully recreated the natural habitat of the animals, thus giving a "real life" emphasis to the exhibit.

well-cultivated mind by cramming him full of rules, the
teacher should make him eager for learning, and better
still, capable of receiving learning. But who takes the
trouble of doing this with kindness and love? Generally
speaking, the teacher takes his pupil as he finds him,
each one setting about at once turning, tanning, carding,
weaving and modelling him as he thinks fit. The child
is expected immediately to become a well-formed product,
a polished jewel. And if the miracle does not take place
in a hand's turn... the teacher grows indignant and storms
and rages."
Comenius therefore emphasized the need for attractive
lessons given in pleasant and harmonious surroundings by
teachers who were both gentle and understanding. This
was a far cry from schools "littered with fragments of
blood-stained birch" and resounding with "the cries of
children tortured by rage-impassioned masters" one
horrifying description of which Montaigne has left us.
In this new type of school, set amid gardens where the
children "will enjoy the beauty of the trees and flowers,"
Comenius pioneered a system of progressive education
adjusted to the stage of development of each pupil. He
distinguished four different schools or "cycles in which
the children would be separated according to age," and
which we should now call the four major periods of
education : infancy, childhood, adolescence and youth.
But Comenius did more than this. With remarkable
intuition, he grasped the fact that the same forms of
knowledge are necessary at the different levels, the differ¬
ence between the levels lying mainly in the way in which
the forms of knowledge are presented. Thus each stage of
learning covered a complete Meld of knowledge with each
succeeding stage going deeper and covering a wider area.
"Though these schools be different," Comenius wrote,
"we do not wish them to teach different things but rather
the same things in a different manner. I mean, all things
which can make men truly men, and the learned really
learned; they should be taught in consideration of the
pupil's age and the standard of his prior preparation,
which should always tend gradually upward."
Open up the living book of the world !
Comenius' idea of progression by "'concentric circles"
was based on the precept that the first step in
training the mind was instruction in the elementary
principles essential for acquiring "universal knowledge".
His aim was to get his pupils to believe nothing without
prior reflection and to do nothing without prior reasoning.
As he put it, the aim of education was not only the acqui¬
sition of knowledge but also the development of character,
the training of judgment and the progressive awakening
of sensibility.
"Let no man exhaust his desires, his senses and his
energy, submit to the desires of others, subordinate his
feelings to those of others or let himself suffer compulsion
from without," he said. "Each of us must realize that he
bears his own happiness within himself."
Having thus so clearly defined the spirit and aims of
education, Comenius then went on to seek the methods to
be used. His suggestion: one which "will enable the
teacher to teach less and the pupils to learn more." Since
children were capable, in the eyes of the 17th century
educator, "of examining everything by themselves without
surrendering to adult authority," their education should be
based on direct activity methods. The pupil's role should
be to search, discover, discuss and repeat; the teachers'
merely to supervise and guide them in their efforts at
discovery. He recommended that the teacher should take
his students on visits to manufactories and on field trips
to study the land, plants and animals. In this way, he
said, "the children will be engaging in studies which will
give them as much pleasure as if they had spent the day

Children should study nature whenever possible,

dead books, why not open the living book of Cont'd

pleasure and benefit than any person could on
ever give us? ... Men should learn by study- next page

COMENIUS

Theologian enamoured of metaphysics,

the beech trees." The objects referred to should be
actually shown to them ; anatomy should be taught by
dissection. And when it is not possible -to show pupils the
real viscera they should be given "ocular demonstrations,
of livers, lungs, intestines, etc., made of leather and stuffed
with wool."
The textbooks of Comenius are conceived in this same
spirit. Two are of unusual importance: his Gate of Lan¬
guages Unlocked, already referred to, and his Orbis Pictus
(The World in Pictures). Though not the world's first
illustrated textbook it is the first school book in which
the pictures are not merely illustrations added for attract¬
iveness and interest but basic to the whole conception
of the work. In this sense Comenius is the father of the
illustrated textbook.
The Orbis Pictus is a great pioneer work for other
reasons too. Comenius shifted the emphasis in instruction
from words to things, and taught language by means
of pictures. The book tied the thing, shown in the picture,
with the word forming part of a sentence, passing from
word to thing to new word. Furthermore it provided the
Latin words and sentences and their translation side by
side. The subject matter was not the world of classical
antiquity but everyday, useful information and scientific
knowledge. Comenius thus broke completely with the
sterile traditions of Ciceronianism that afflicted the schools
of his time and for hundreds of years afterwards, and
abandoned the method of teaching language by grammar
and by rule.
Young scamps no longer raised the devil
CC"T"*his book," he said, "will provide small children with
I a marvellous device for learning to read with far
greater ease than heretofore." He explained that
he intended to use the Orbis Pictus as a miniature ency¬
clopedia serving as both a primer and a lexicon for
learning Latin and German. His device was a picture
alphabet in the form of animals followed by individual
letters imitating the sounds the animals make. In this
way, he said, a child "only just beginning to learn the ABC
or to spell will bethink himself and immediately call to the
mind the sound and force of each character merely on
seeing the animal from which it is derived, until such time
as his imagination, strengthened by use and daily practice,
leaves him with full and ready knowledge..."
Once familiarized with the alphabet, the child could
then examine the illustrations above each chapter heading.
The image would tell him what the title indicated. When
he had scanned through the whole book, "he will auto¬
matically have learned to read from the mere titles of the
pictures without having had to make use of a tedious and"
boring syllable presentation which is both mental torture
and a strain for young minds." Thus Comenius, who was
the father of education through pictures, was also the
precursor of the global method of teaching reading.
It was also Comenius who first formulated the monitorial
system of teaching, highly in vogue during the 19th
century, and the idea of team-unit activity which stems
from it. In The Great Didactic he advocated the division
of classes into "groups of ten" each led by a monitor,
with a head monitor in charge of several groups, "so as
to stimulate attention and give all the pupils the benefit
of what any one of their number says." Describing a
written translation exercise (he pointed out that it could
equally apply to other lessons) he wrote : "As soon as the
14
leaders of divisions have secured attention, one scholar
should be called upon to stand up and choose as his
adversary any other scholar that he pleases." The pupil
then reads out his exercise sentence by sentence while the
entire class listens. "At the end of each sentence the
scholar stops and his adversary has the opportunity of
pointing out any mistake... Then other scholars in the
division, and after them the whole class, may make
criticisms on the rendering, and finally the teacher sup¬
plies any point that has been omitted... Then the adver¬
sary should read out his in the same way... Individual
words and phrases are then criticized as before. After this,
a second pair of adversaries is chosen and the same proce¬
dure is repeated for as long as time permits. Those who
are still uncertain about a passage may bring forward
their difficulties, or those who think that their rendering
is better than that given may read it and receive criticism
on it."
LEARNING BY SEEING. The use of visual aids In education for which
Comenius was one of the pioneers, opened the road to the publication of
many other illustrated textbooks. Above, illustration from a 19th century
In this way, collective teaching based on both emulation
and the team spirit was substituted by Comenius for
teaching imparted by the master to each pupil individually
a system which gave scamps left with nothing to do a
magnificent opportunity to "raise the devil."
A whole study could still be written on all of Comenius'
influences on modern teaching methods. One of his pleas,
for example, was that classroom walls should be hung
with pictures representing famous men and events of
history, maps and other illustrations, as well as "models
of all kinds to assist the memory to retain ideas and facts."
The attractive appearance of the classroom, he said,
"teaches the child, when he grows up, to beautify his home
and make it more pleasant."
Comenius insisted that art education should be included
in the curriculum. He protested (even at that time!)
against over-work at school and held that children should
not attend classes for more than four hours during the

mornings, leaving the afternoons free for singing, drawing
and dancing.
In an age when education was limited to the privileged
few and had neither a coherent body of doctrine nor
firmly-established rules, Comenius conceived a systematic,
comprehensive doctrine of school organization and laid
the foundation for the modern ideals of universal, demo¬
cratic education which is such an important part of
Unesco's world programme today. To Comenius must go
the credit for writing the Charter of Free and Compulsory
Education: "Not only are the children of the rich and
the noble to be drawn into school, but alike gentle and
simple, rich and poor, girls and boys, in great towns and
small, down to the country villages. Everyone who is born
a human creature should be educated." With his com¬
prehensive ladder system of schools he saw a Mother
School in every home, a Vernacular School in every ham¬
let and village, a Latin School in every city, and a
University in every province. Centuries were to pass
before these ideals were to be incorporated in the.
educational policies of nations.
Free schooling for all, an educational system based on
the harmonious and progressive development of all the
child's faculties up to the end of secondary education,
vocational guidance, the application of activity and
intuitive methods of teaching, the proper eauipment of

schools, teacher-trainingsuch in brief are some of the
major reforms which the Moravian philosopher set forth
in The Great Didactic and which Unesco has espoused.
Comenius, however, was not content just with the
provision of educational opportunities for all. He believed
that universal education must be informed with know¬
ledge garnered from all the world, and that education
must become a way of light so that "men's minds should
be gradually raised from darkness to light and withdrawn
from the vague and casual opinions to the one straight¬
forward way of everlasting truth."
In his Via Lucis (Way of Light) written when in London
in 1641, he recognized that his plans for the reform of
education could not be carried out without newly organized
collaboration on an international scale, including the
foundation of a world academy. This led him to his plan
for the General Consultation on the Reform of Human
Affairs, the bulk of the manuscript of which was long
thought to have been lost and was rediscovered only at the
beginning of the Second World War by a Comenius scholar,
D. Czyzevsklj, at Halle, in Germany. The Pampaedia
and The Panorthosia (a treatise on a Universal Improve¬
ment of Human Affairs) form the keystone of this huge
unfinished work.
Comenius dreamt of closer links between all the coun¬
tries of Europe and, once this union was solidly established,
between all parts of the world. He did not underestimate
the difficulties in the path of international collaboration,
and preached tolerance and understanding to overcome
them: "Let no one be blamed for the errors of the past...
As in educating the young, what matters Is to lead men
from the known to the unknown; and 'to lead' like
'to educate' means to use peaceful means and never violent
ones." He advocated therefore that men join together in
the cause of peace, that they gather together in a great
unified assembly of human solidarity, a community of
minds and knowledge set up in a "Council of Light", an
international organization where education, science and
culture could be employed for the good of all mankind.
Are these not the very principles, upon which Unesco was
founded?
The success of Comenius' works at the time of their
publication was no doubt due in part to his skill in rework¬
ing and assimilating ideas which others had formulated
before him. Comenius obviously knew of the educational
doctrines propounded by Luther, Calvin and Melanchton
who, while striving to reform the church had also proposed
programmes of broad popular education. Nor was he
ignorant of the reforms proposed by men such as Erasmus,
Rabelais, Montaigne and even Milton. The revival of
classical studies and discoveries in science had opened
up new vistas for the human mind and created a new
thirst for knowledge. There was a demand for new
educational methods so that this vast, new body of know¬
ledge might be included.
Genius synthesized a complex character
But historical perspective is not enough to explain the
enduring interest of Comenius' work. Though the
Czech educator owed much to pre-Renaissance and
Renaissance thinkers such as Vives, Campanella, Aisted
and particularly Bacon (from whom he derived his deep
love of scientific progress, his ideas of collaboration
between societies of learning, and his interest in the
inductive method and its development) he also combined
the abstract, deductive thinking of Central Europe with
the more down-to-earth and individualistic philosophy of
the English.
As Jean Piaget writes, "he was a theologian enamoured
of metaphysics and imbued with the speculative spirit of
the seventeenth century... This explains the twofold
impression of outmoded form and up-to-date substance
which one continually receives when reading the great
educationist's works. In this respect, Comenius' meta¬
physics lies between scholasticism as Inspired by Aristotle
and the mechanicalism of the seventeenth century."
In a word, his character was highly complex. An ardent
patriot, he dreamt of a peaceful federation of all nations.
A methodical rationalist, he was imbued with the mystical
theology of the Hussites. But these apparent contra¬
dictions in no way mar the deeper unity of his work, and
are to be explained by his family background, his education
and his life experience. Only a mighty genius could have
merged them into a vast synthesis, the essential principles
of whichat least as far as education and international
affairs are concernedhave an amazing actuality. Leib¬
nitz, Buisson and Raumer marvelled at his extreme
breadth of mind; Michelet called him "the Galileo of
Education"; and the American educator, Nicolas Murray
Butler said of him that his relation to our present teaching
is similar to that held by Copernicus and Newton toward
modern science, and Bacon and Descartes toward modern
philosophy.

THE MUSIC OF THE ORIENT
IN REACH OF WESTERN EARS
by Yehudi Menuhin
One of Unesco's major undertakings is to encourage a better mutual
understanding between Asian countries and those of the Occident through
cultural exchanges. This is a question which concerns the International
Music Council and also one of the world's great violinists, Yehudi Menu¬
hin, who is President of the Asian Music Circle. While in Paris recently
for a concert engagement, Yehudi Menuhin discussed these questions
with representatives of Unesco and the International Music Council
in an interview which has been broadcast in many parts of the world
through Unesco's radio services. We reproduce below some of the
points which were made by Yehudi Menuhin during this interview.
about the civilizations they have
achieved, the ways of life, of music,
of literature, of dance, they have de¬
veloped on their own.
Unesco has said there are no peo¬
ples "beyond our reach". That is
theoretically true, but nonetheless,
for the inhabitant of Paris or Lon¬
don or New York, Indian musicians
(I mention India simply because I
have had personal relations with In¬
dia and its musicians whom I have
helped to bring to New York) are
normally beyond the reach of the or¬
dinary person who is interested in
music in New York or in any of the
other large cities of the Western
world. I have seen such wonderful
response based largely on curiosity
and the desire just to know what
extraordinary shapes and forms
sound has evolved in the course of
thousands of years in the absence of
our own scales and our own instru¬
ments and our own thoughts.
I am sure radio and film are im¬
portant, and recordings as well, but
primarily the initial impact should be,
in my opinion, with the living person.
In the experience of the Asian Music
Circle those artists who have been
brought over from the various East¬
ern countries have found understand¬
ing and response in England and,
from my own personal experience, in
New York as well.
I feel that music, too, offers almost
the best means and road to the un¬
derstanding of other people, precisely
because one is not side-tracked by
misleading words or symbols which
have already acquired so many mean¬
ings. I have seen, for instance, the
American audiences go mad with the
rhythm of the Indian drummers
and that has done more to establish
contact with India among those peo¬
ple who experience the performance
than all the words that might be said
or the books distributed which peo¬
ple might, or might not read.
There is something compelling
about the music once the people
are there they have to listen and if
the personality of the performer is
sufficiently strong and his dedication
as is the case with the great Indian
musicians is persuasive and
compelling, the audience never fails
to respond. The Asian Music Circle
has achieved quite a considerable .
gain with each year over the preced¬
ing year in numbers of performances,
numbers in attendance. The ambition
now is to have permanent headquar¬
ters in London, because it is a func¬
tion which is bound to continue and
to increase regardless of who will
take it over. It is a function which
in the world we live in today is
part of the very essence of the
twentieth century that we get to
know each other.

A SEARCH OF SCIENTISTS. Some 1,200 scientists from 61 countries took part in the Unesco International Conference on Radio-isotopes, at
the Sorbonne in Paris. Rarely has a congress brought so many branches of science together. This was achieved because, as Sir John Cockcroft remarked
In his preslcential address (above), radio-isotopes hive unique properties as research tools and are applicable to every branch of experimental science.

### 67962: New tools for scientific research; uses of radio-isotopes studied by UNESCO international congress
NEW TOOLS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
Uses of radio-isotopes studied by Unesco International Congress
Twelve hundred scientists from 61 countries and 25 inter¬
national organizations met in Paris recently at a Unesco
International Conference on Radio-isotopes. For two
weeks they discussed the uses that can be made of man-made
atoms that can "rival atomic power in the benefits they confer
on humanity."
Their discussions ranged over the entire face of nature,
from the structure of the planets in space to mysteries of the
living cell ; from weather-winds to unravelling the secrets of
how plants capture the sunlight and use it to turn carbon- -
dioxide into our essential foods; from what happens in a blast
furnace to the exclusive chemistry of antibiotics. This was
science setting out on many new voyages to make many
new discoveries. And its pilot for all of them was the
radio-isotope.
It was appropriate that the conference was held in Paris,
where Becquerel first discovered radio-activity, and Pierre
and Marie Curie isolated radium, the natural radio-active
element. The roll of participants was impressive. There was
Frederic Joliot, who with his wife, the late Irene Curie, first
produced an artificial radio-active element, and Sir John
Cockcroft, President of the Conference, who with Walton
first split the atom by man-made methods. There was
F. Strassmann, who, with Otto Hahn, discovered uranium-
fission, which made possible chain-reaction and the release
of atomic energy. Four distinguished scientists were Confer¬
ence vice-presidents: Willard F. Libby, member of the United
States Atomic Energy Commission; Prof. Topchiev of the
Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.; Prof. Kenjiro Kimura
of Japan and Prof. Louis Camille Bugnard of France. Besides
these there were hundreds of others who are already famous
or are making their names in the new fields of scientific
endeavour that radio-isotopes are opening up.
Rarely does a scientific congress cover such a diversity of
subjects or bring so many branches of science together. The
reason was that they were discussing a laboratory tool, as
common to all of them as the microscope
has been in the past. Cont'd
This was highlighted by Sir John Cockcroft
in his presidential address, when he said:

### 67962: New tools for scientific research; uses of radio-isotopes studied by UNESCO international congress
NEW TOOLS FOR RESEARCH (Continued)
"It is not often that a single tool or technique is the uniting
factor to bring together scientists and specialists in such
different fields... The radio-isotopes have achieved this because
they have unique proporties as research tools and are applicable
to every branch of experimental science. That Unesco should
undertake responsibility for organizing and presenting this
conference is a tribute to the international importance of these
new techniques."
The interpreters, simultaneously translating the proceedings in
English, French, Spanish and Russian, were at the same time
wrestling with a new language, the terms of which did not
exist a few years ago, because a new dictionary was born when
the atom was split and new words gain currency almost daily.
The terms were difficult and so were many of the subjects,
but the principle of the radio-isotope techniques is not so difficult.
As a result of atomic energy, there are available to research-
workers man-made atoms which emit particles or rays which
can be detected or measured by various devices. These are
radio-active twins of all elements which exist in nature such as
gold, silver, iron, copper and carbon. Some isotopes radiate
for only a split second; some like radio-aluminium for 800,000
years. The shortlived ones are too ephemeral to be of much
practical use but, with fast aircraft today, useful versions of
most elements can be delivered from the atomic reactors which
produce them to laboratories all over the world.
From cat's whisker to transistor
These man-made versions behave chemically exactly like
their natural twins. They form alloys, combine in chemical
compounds or take part in the living processes of plants,
animals or humans. But, since they are labelled by their detect¬
able rays, they can be followed through those processes so that
scientists can discover exactly what happens in circumstances
which nature has so far kept a close secret.
For example, science and industry have employed catalysts
to speed up the combination of elements in chemical reactions.
The catalyst is another chemical but does not itself combine.
It is like a parson at a wedding, hastening the bonds of matri¬
mony, but remaining a third party. But how? With radio¬
isotopes, as the conference was told, the mechanism is now being
measured and defined.
Or consider the old "cat's whisker" crystal set which preced¬
ed the radio-tubes in the early days of broadcasting. A finger
of wire would seek out some point in the crystal and, somehow,
sounds would be snatched out of the ether. Today, the primi¬
tive crystal has evolved into the transistor, the midget valves
of pocket radios. It is known that the "trick" is to have a
crystal of pure germanium or silicon with an infinitesimal trace
of impurity. In Paris, it was explained how radio-isotopes could
"place" that impurity and measure the behaviour.
Again, consider the human brain and the processes which go
on inside it. What is the chemistry of human thought and action?
Again at this conference there were reports on the "labelling"
of atoms which take part in those processes. It is possible to
track alcohol or sleeping drugs into the brain and measure their
action. That was only one aspect of the brain-chemistry men¬
tioned by the researchers.
The living processes of the plants depend on sunlight, trap¬
ped by the green-pigmented chlorophyll cells and used to convert
the carbon-dioxide of the air and the water and minerals of
the soil into the food which animals and men eat. This is one
of the most important lines of research because it is the basis
of all survival. With radio-isotopes, the complicated and incred¬
ibly fast-moving processes of photosynthesis, this light-induc-

A VISIT TO 'SATURN' The major nuclear research centre of the
French Atomic Energy Commission, lo¬
cated at Saclay, near Paris, was visited
by scientists attending the Unesco International Conference on Radio¬
isotopes. Here they inspected "Saturn" (I) as the centre's giant proton-
synchrotron Is called. This powerful generator accelerates electrlcally-
ed chemistry, are being "blue-printed". Chlorophyll (and what
it means when a plant turns green and withers into yellow) is
being studied. So is the carbohydrate cycle and how the plant
turns carbon into sugars and starches. And how the chemicals
are built up into amino-acids and protein.
Scientists have known about photosynthesis for 150 years but
only now, with labelled atoms, are they learning how it works.
The implications are profound because, in the long-run, engi¬
neers-may take over from the radio-chemists and build factories
to reproduce the processes of the living-plant, to make food
from the elements as it does. Meantime, the knowledge will
help plant-biologists to improve the efficiency of plants.
Plants also need minerals from water and soil. Great interest
centred on the discussions at the conference on how the chemi¬
cals were transferred through the roots to the stems and leaves
of flowers. By adding labelled atoms to fertilisers, scientists can
detect the amounts, and movements, of minerals in plants. The
findings are of great importance to agriculture. For example,
it was shown that in cold soils, essential chemicals were not
absorbed by the roots sufficiently, but if fertilisers were applied
to the leaves, they would nourish the plants. This can mean
much in the cold regions where crops have been restricted

impact of the particles enables physicists to study its structure and the
nature of the forces existing within the nucleus. Scientists also inspected

are used for many kinds of experiments classed in two major groups

the structural materials and the reaction of living organisms, for example).
by soil-temperatures. It was also shown that contrary to the
previous belief that the sap-circulation of the plant moved by
-, absorption from the soil and transpiration through the leaves,
without anything equivalent to the heart-pump in the animals
h or humans, there is, in fact some energetic "pumping" system,
still undefined.
'Atoms in overalls' save $406 million yearly
Studies of meteorites, by radio-active tracers, are revealing
new information about the shattered planet from which they
came. The movement of tritium radio-active hydrogen in
the weather system is teaching how the air-currents move and
mingle and how the moisture evaporated from the sea is deposit¬
ed as rain on the land or how much comes from inland waters.
The bottoms of the oceans are being examined. Scientists are
reassessing the age of rocks and re-dating the world. With
radio-active carbon measurements they provide a calendar for
the relics of past civilizations.
So through forty sessions, scientists compared notes. In the
corridors, they "did each other's homework" because, as Prof
essor Bugnard pointed out, the human contacts were as impor¬
tant as the papers or formal discussions. Scientists formed new
friendships and obtained "new tips".
After the scientific sessions, public lectures were delivered
each evening by the leading authorities attending. In those, the
practical applications of radio-isotopes were illustrated.
There are thousands of ways in which those man-made atoms
are being supplied to industry, agriculture and medicine.
Dr. Willard F. Libby reported that a careful review in Novem¬
ber 1956 showed that the savings produced in American industry
by isotopes amounted probably to $ 390 millions a year. By
July 1957 it was $406,000,000 and by 1962 it will be more
than ten times as much $ 5,000,000,000 a year.
All this is a by-product of atomic energy. Sir John Cockcroft
suggested that radio-isotopes would rival atomic power in the
benefits they confer on humanity. These are "the peaceful uses
of atomic energy" which many fear is fraught with hazard. But
Dr. W.G. Marley, the leading British authority on health physics,
said that after a careful review of all the risks and precautions,
the use of radio-isotopes in scientific research, in medicine and
in all branches of industrial technology can be greatly expand¬
ed without risk to the public health.

GIRDLING THE EARTH at a speed of 8,000 metres a second (about 18,000 m.p.h.), "Sputnik" makes a complete orbit in one hour 36 minutes.
Diagram shows the path of the satellite on each of its trips during 24 hours. The satellite's orbit is 65° away from the plane of equator.

### 67963: A Soviet scientist looks at 'Sputnik'
o A Soviet Scientist looks at 'Sputnik'
by K. Staniukovich
Member of the Interplanetary Communications Commission
of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union
October 4, 1957, can be considered as
the date marking the beginning of
the era of man's conquest of cosmic
space. A scientific problem of foremost
importance has now been solved but its full
import is not easy to grasp in our time.
The launching of the artificial satellite
demonstrates the progress that has been
made in a number of sciences and techni¬
cal domains. This has resulted in the
achievement of what only recently was
considered to be an unrealizable dream.
The mere perfection of rocket techniques,
however, would not have been enough to
launch artificial satellites with certainty
into the upper layers of the atmosphere.
For that, additional factors were needed:
the development of the construction of in¬
struments, the creation of electronic
calculating machines capable of determin¬
ing the most advantageous trajectory of
the satellite and a high standard of science
and modern techniques generally.
The event of October 4, 1957, is impor¬
tant for several reasons: first, proof has
now been furnished of the possibility of
launching a satellite into a relatively stable
orbit; second, men the world over can
proudly observe that an object now exists
whose movements do not seem to be govern¬
ed by the force of gravity in the sense
that this body will not fall to earth for a
very long period and that its fall will occur
only as result of resistance to the medium
in which it is moving.
As early observations have shown, the
"Sputnik's" period of rotation around the
earth has been reduced by several seconds
in several days. This observation alone
makes it possible to draw many conclusions
of the utmost importance to geophysics.
The density of the air at an altitude of 500
or 550 miles (the height of the satellite at
its furthest distance from the earth) is so
small that it evidently does not exceed 10

miles before colliding. As the orbit of the
satellite is in the form of an ellipse, it
passes through more dense layers of the
atmosphere at its closest point to the earth.
It is here, where the density of the air is
greater, that the slowing down of the satel¬
lite is chiefly taking place. There may
however, be other causes for a change in
the rotation period of the satellite. One of
these may be the fact that our planet is
not a perfect sphere. When an object re¬
volves around a flattened sphere, its rate of
rotation varies periodically. The uneven
distribution of the masses inside the earth
may also influence the rotation period.
At altitudes of 400 to 600 miles, there
exist large quantities of cosmic dust which
penetrate the earth's atmosphere. Observa¬
tions made in certain countries during the
launching of rockets have shown that the
density of meteoric substances at altitudes
above 120 miles is almost in no way com¬
mensurate with the density of the air. As
a result, collisions with these cosmic parti¬
cles will also slow the satellite. Whether the
earth's magnetic field can serve as another
brake is also a question of interest.
Thus, the observations made from the
earth of the first artificial satellite are
of enormous scientific interest. These ob-
, servations, especially those made by optical
methods, are now being carried out in
many countries of the earth. After careful
comparative analysis, they will give inform¬
ation on the feeble density of the upper
SPUTNIK photographed before take-off.
Facts about it have been given as follows: dia¬
meter, 22.8 In.; weight, 184.3 lbs. A sphere

layers of the atmosphere including the
cosmic fields, and will also make it possible
to reach scientific conclusions on the form
and structure of the earth's inner layers.
It seems to me that one of the most im¬
portant tasks of astronautics is to undertake
a more precise study of the quantity of
minute meteors and of the number of me¬
teors of larger dimensions cruising through
space. Of great importance, too, is the
study of the speeds at which these meteors
may collide with the body of a rocket.
When a meteor strikes the body of a rocket
or any other object at a speed exceeding
one kilometre (.621 of a mile) per second,
a sharp explosion occurs. The mass of the
rocket is greater than that of the meteor.
At a collision speed of 30 kilometres a
second, calculations have shown that the
mass of the materials in the body of
the rocket is several thousand times greater
than that of the meteor.
. Even the impact of a meteor weighing
only a few milligrammes can therefore be
dangerous for an artificial satellite. True,
the probability of meeting such a meteor is
small but over a period of weeks or months
an encounter may nevertheless occur. By
studying the information obtained as a
result of the launching of "Sputnik" and by
determining the true danger of these colli¬
sions, it will be possible to discover means
of coping with them, such as the construc¬
tion of two or more protective sheaths for
either artificial satellite or rocket.
The quantity of meteoric dust showering
down on to the earth varies according to
the seasons. There, are periods when
meteoric activity is at a maximum and
periods when it is almost completely absent.
In order to observe meteorites and their
collisions, satellites in the near future will
be equipped with apparatus to report on
such phenomena by radio.
Another very important task is the study
of the earth's electro-magnetic fields, the
ionization of the upper layers of the atmo¬
sphere, cosmic rays and cosmic radiation.
Animals, sent aloft equipped with transmit¬
ters, will furnish information on how
creatures are affected by space flight.
Thus, for example, it will be possible to
study the influence upon them of cosmic
rays coming from the sun and not absorbed
by the earth's atmosphere, or the behaviour
of animals in the absence of gravity.
Finish in flame & dust
There is a great deal of interest in what
will become of the artificial satellite
"Sputnik" and of the final-stage
launching rocket which now accompanies it.
It is possible that within a few weeks the sa¬
tellite will penetrate the lower layers of the
atmosphere and will be increasingly brak¬
ed by the air's slowing friction. At this
point, the speed at which it approaches the
earth will increase. At an altitude of about
sixty miles, its speed will be such that its
aluminium body will disintegrate in a burst
of flames and drop into atmospheric layers
in the form of fine dust. The launching
rocket, as its movements observed in the
skies show, has for some time now out¬
distanced the satellite.
Astrophysicists are interested in many
complex problems, -in particular those
connected with the study of the sun. Like
all men on earth, astrophysicists who study
the planets are interested in learning
whether oxygen exists on Mars. Observa¬
tions made on earth have been unable as
yet to detect an oxygen spectrograph line
on the planet Mars, but it is possible that a
very weak line may be absorbed by the
earth's own atmosphere, for there is prob¬
ably less air on Mars than on Earth. It re¬
mains to be seen what the spectrographic
observations of the satellite will tell us.
In a few years, the orbits of the earth's
artificial satellites will approach the moon.
The artificial satellite which will fly to the
moon will be equipped with special appa¬
ratus. This will be the stepping stone for
man's future voyages into outer space. We
are convinced that the launching of artifi¬
cial earth satellites, equipped with non-
military instruments will enable scientists
to serve the cause of peace.
SATELLITE'S ORBIT brings it over a diffe¬
rent part of the globe (due to earth's rotation)
on each of its completed circles. Its orbit is
so steady and it has lost so little speed that
its path in relation to the earth can easily be
computed in advance. These five diagrams
show different orbits, the first being the one
taking the "man-made moon" over Moscow.

### 67965: The Challenge of the spaceship
This timely article was written long before the launching
of the world's first artificial satellite. It is a revised
version of a paper originally read to the British Inter¬
planetary Society in 1946 and published in 1953 in Unesccs
quarterly scientific review, "Impact of Science on So¬
ciety. The author is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical
Society, and has written several books on the subject, in
particular "Interplanetary Flight" and "The Exploration
of Space". This article is copyright by the author and
may not be reproduced without permission.
An historian of the twenty-first century, looking back
past our own age to the beginnings of human
civilization, will be conscious of four great turning
points which mark the end of one era and the dawn of a
new and totally different mode of life. Two of these
events are lost, probably forever, in the primeval night
before history began. The invention of agriculture led to
the founding of settled communities and gave man the
leisure and social intercourse without which progress is
impossible. The taming of fire made him virtually in¬
dependent of climate and, most important of all, led to
the working of metals and so set him upon the road of
technological development that road which was to lead,
centuries later, to the steam engine, the Industrial Re¬
volution, and the age of steel and petrol and surface
transportation through which we are now passing.
The third revolution began, as all the world knows, in
a squash-court in Chicago on December 2, 1942, when the
first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was started by man.
We are still too close to that cataclysmic event to see it
in its true perspective, but we know that it will change our
world, for better or for worse, almost beyond recognition.
And we know too that it is linked with the fourth and in
some ways greatest change of all the crossing of space
and the exploration of the other planets.
22
The first spaceships capable of reaching another world
may still lie half a century ahead, but the giant rocket is
already with us and will soon be carrying men to the
limits of the atmosphere and beyond. Nor will it be many
years before a guided missile reaches the moon and blazes
the trail along which men will travel a generation later.
An attempt to construct a philosophy of astronautics is
therefore far from premature: it is, if anything, a little
belated. In the last few years we have seen the political
and ethical chaos produced when a great technical de¬
velopment comes into a world which is unprepared for it.
If our civilization is to have a future, then we must see
that it does not repeat its earlier mistakes. I do not
suggest as some have done that lawyers need start
worrying immediately about the ownership of the moon,
but the ownership of space will soon be a matter of acute
practical importance. If country A fires experimental
rockets across its neighbour B, what does B do? The air
above B is admittedly its own property, but how far does
that jurisdiction extend? There will have to be some
equivalent of the three-mile limit; otherwise in the course
of a day every country will, by virtue öf the earth's rota¬
tion, lay claim to a large portion of the universe! This
problem will be of grave concern in another decade, when
long-range research projectiles begin to travel far outside
the atmosphere with a supreme indifference to the geo¬
graphy beneath them.
The ideals of astronautics are new, but the motives and
impulses underlying them are as old as the human race.
There was a time not long ago when those who advocat¬
ed interplanetary travel were always being asked. "How?"
Even before the war that question could be answered in
general terms, but there had been no large-scale engineer¬
ing achievement to support the claims put forward. It
is amusing to recall that in those days which now seem
so remote there were many people who refused to believe
that a rocket could work in a vacuum or would ever be
able to rise more than a few miles from the earth.

### 67965: The Challenge of the spaceship
The Unesco Courier. November 1957
Today, the power of the rocket has been demonstrated,
only too thoroughly. "How" is a question one seldom
hears in discussions concerning space-flight: the common¬
er query is now "Why?" And it is much more difficult
to answer, for it involves the motives underlying all
human conduct.
The urge to explore, to discover, to "follow knowledge
like a sinking star," is a -primary human impulse which
needs, and can receive, no further justification than its
awn existence. The search for knowledge, said a modern
Chinese philosopher, is a form of play. If this be true,
then the spaceship, when it comes, will be the ultimate toy
that may lead mankind from its cloistered nursery out
into the playground of the stars.
When the oceans begin to boil
However, it is not hard to think of entirely valid
"practical" reasons why one should wish to cross
space, and some of these we will discuss later. There
is no doubt that eventually sheer necessity would bring
about the conquest of the other planets. I do not believe
that it is possible to have a -virile, steadily-advancing
culture limited to a single world, and taking the long-
term view, we know that our earth will one day become
uninhabitable.
In his book, The Birth and Death of the Sun (1), the
physicist George Gamow points out that before its evolu¬
tion has finished, our sun will become 100 times as lumi¬
nous as it is today. I am glad to see that he draws the
obvious conclusion and visualizes the migration of
humanity to the outer planets before our earth's oceans
have begun to boil.
But the human race will not wait until it is kicked out.
(1) Viking Press, Sew York, 1940, and MacMillan, London, 1941.
Long before the sun's radiation has shown any measurable
increase, man will have explored all the solar system and,
like a cautious bather testing the temperature of the sea,
will be making breathless little forays into the abyss
which separates him from the stars.
To support my argument, I now have to develop some
sort of time-scale. I do this with much reluctance, since
prophecy is a dangerous and thankless business, frequently
fatal to those who practise it. We have, however, learned
by past experience that even the most extravagant fore¬
cast seldom overtakes the truth. H. G. Wells once wrote
and was no doubt laughed to scorn for his follythat
the aeroplane might have some influence upon warfare by
1950. Even Wells never imagined that by that date
aircraft would not only have become of supreme import¬
ance but would have been challenged by still newer
weapons.
The advances in rocket research since the 1940's have
been phenomenal, but they have merely laid the founda¬
tions for what is still to come. Nevertheless, it is worth
recording present achievements to fix the position of
astronautics as it is today.
Heights of 385 kilometres and speeds of over 8,000 kilo¬
metres an hour have been attained by a "two-step" rocket
fired from White Sands, main centre of American rocket
activity. A large number of missiles, some more efficient
and with higher ceilings than the original German V.2,
have been developed. (For example the Viking, which
though a single-stage rocket, should ultimately have a
ceiling of over 300 kilometres)
A great deal has been learned about the upper at¬
mosphere by means of instruments carried
in such rockets, which send their readings
by radio to ground stations. In this way
physical recovery of the rocket is un¬
necessary though recently this has been
achieved by means of special parachutes.

### 67965: The Challenge of the spaceship
CHALLENGE OF
THE SPACESHIP
(Continued) Lunar round-trips by atomic rockets
In addition, manned rocket vehicles, such as the Douglas
Skyrocket; known to have flown at well over 2,000 kilo¬
metres an hour have also been developed. These ma¬
chines can hardly be called aircraft, since they operate
at altitudes so great that conditions around them are
almost the same as in (airless) space.
During the next decade, the techniques necessary to
send small, radio-controlled rockets to the moon will
become available. Such rockets would weigh about 50
tons at take-off and have a payload of a few kilogrammes.
They could make astronomical reconnaissance flights of
great scientific and also psychological importance.
There is no reason why such flights should not take
place by 1960. The public, not realizing the problems
still to be faced, will expect human beings to follow in a
very short time. It will be disappointed. During the sub¬
sequent years there will be innumerable short-range flights
beyond the atmosphere by man-carrying ships reaching
heights of a few thousand kilometres and, as I have
mentioned earlier, raising all sorts of petty legal problems.
But if we have to rely on chemical fuels, It may require
at least 20 years of further experimenting before the first
true spaceship lands on the moon and returns to earth.
That brings us to the late 1970's. Any chemically-
fuelled spaceships will be unwieldy, fabulously expensive
machines with fuel consumptions measured by the
thousand tons for a single voyage. Not more than one
or two countries will be able to build them, and they will
be of scientific value only. There will be no question, for
a very long time, of colonization or of voyages to the
other planets. But; and it is a very large butany
prophet would indeed be rash if he based his predictions
upon the use of chemical fuels alone.'
Coasting flights halfway round the sun
Here, as in other fields, the great question-mark is
atomic energy. In theory, a few kilogrammes of
uranium could take a ship weighing 1,000 tons to the
moon and back. In practice, we have a very long way to
go before this can be done. At the moment one possible
solution is that some form of enriched, high-temperature
pile or reactor could be developed to accelerate a "working
fluid" such as hydrogen, helium or some other gas of low
molecular weight and so give a propulsive jet. Very great
engineering difficulties will have to be overcome before
this can be done, and an alternative solution is to use
what has been called the "ion rocket." In this device
charged particles would be accelerated by electric fields
to produce the jet; the necessary fields being generated
by nuclear energy. Such a scheme would have many ad¬
vantages, but it could only operate In airless space and
it could only produce such low thrusts that it could not
possibly lift a spaceship up from the earth's surface
against the direct pull of gravity.
This is by no means a fundamental disadvantage, and
indeed fits in very well with current ideas on astronautics.
The fact that it is not possible for any spaceship to carry
enough fuel for a voyage to another planet and back has
long focused attention on what have been called "orbital
techniques." Once a rocket is above the atmosphere and
therefore no longer subject to air resistance, it becomes
theoretically possible for it to turn itself into a sort of '
"artificial moon." All it need do to achieve this is to
reach the necessary speed in horizontal flight, and from
there on it will stay in its orbit without using any more
power just as the moon itself does. It could wait
effortlessly until "tanker" rockets were sent up to refuel
it: then, when its supplies had been replenished, it could
continue on its way.
In this manner any Interplanetary journey can be
broken down into a number of stages, with refuelling
between them, and this procedure is believed to be the
key to space-flight. It seems likely that we may use the
present-day "chemical" rockets to climb up from earth
into the refuelling orbit, and then continue from there
using atomic or "ion" rockets.
Atomic power is hardly likely to advance the conquest
of space by more than 10 years, but it may make it
24
practical almost from the beginning, which otherwise
would certainly not have been the case. What is equally
important, it will mean that the whole solar system, and
not merely the moon, will be immediately accessible to
man. It requires little more power to reach the planets
than it does to go to the moon, but the most economical
voyages involve months or even years of free "coasting"
along orbits curving halfway round the sun. With atomic
power these journeys could be cut to a fraction of the
time. For example, the "cheapest" journey to Mars as
far as fuel is concerned lasts 258 days. With an atomic
ship, travelling by a more direct route at quite a moderate
speed, it need take only a few weeks.
The last quarter of this century will be an age of
exploration such as man has never before known. By the
year 2,000 most of the major bodies in the solar system
will probably have been reached, but It will take centuries
to examine them all in any detail. Those who seem to
think that the moon is the goal of interplanetary travel
should remember that the solar system contains eight
other planets, at least 30 moons, and some thousands of
asteroids. The total area of the major bodies is about
250 times that of earth, though the four giant planets
probably do not possess stable surfaces on which landings
could be made. Nevertheless, that still leaves an area
10 times as great as all the land "surface of the .'earth.
This, then, is the future which lies before us, if our
civilization survives the diseases of its childhood. It is a

future which some may find terrifying, as no doubt our
ancestors found the hostile emptiness of the great oceans.
But the men who built our world crossed those oceans and
overcame those fears. If we fail before the same test, our
race will have begun its slide into decadence. Remember,
too, that when the great explorers of the past set sail
into the unknown they said goodbye for years to their
homes and everything they knew. Our children will face
no such loneliness. When they are among the outermost
planets, when the earth is lost in the glare of the sun
and. the sun itself is no more than the brightest of the
stars, they will still be able to hear its voice and to send
their own words in a few hours back to the world of men.
Let us now consider the effects which interplanetary
travel must have upon human institutions and ideas. The
most obvious and direct result of the crossing of space
will be a revolution in almost all branches of science.
I shall not attempt to list more than a few of the discov¬
eries we may make when we can set up research stations
and observatories upon the other planets. One can never
predict the outcome of any scientific investigation, and the
greatest discoveries the ones which will most influence
human life may come from sciences as yet unborn.
TV relay stations circling the earth
Astronomy and physics will, of course, be the fields of
knowledge most immediately affected. In both these
sciences there are whole areas where research has
come to a dead end, or has never even started, because our
terrestrial environment makes it impossible.
The atmosphere, which on a clear night looks so trans¬
parent, is in reality a coloured filter blocking all rays
beyond the ultra-violet. Even in the visible spectrum the
light that finally struggles through the shifting strata
above our heads is so distorted that the images it carries
dance and tremble in the field of the telescope.
An observatory on the moon, working with quite small
instruments, would be many times as effective as one on
earth. Far greater magnifications could be employed, and
far longer exposures used. In addition, the low gravity
would make relatively simple the building of larger tele¬
scopes than have ever been constructed on this planet.
In physics and chemistry, access to vacua of unlimited
extent will open up quite hew fields of investigation. The
electronic scientist may well look forward to the day
when he can build radio tubes a kilometre long, if he
wishes, merely by setting up his electrodes in the open!
We may learn more about gravity when we can escape
partially or wholly from its influence.
The prospect of building stations in space, circling the
earth like tiny moons in orbits beyond the atmosphere, is
one that has a peculiar fascination. Such stations were
first proposed by the Germans as refuelling depots for
spaceships, but even if that need never arises they would
have other most important applications. Meteorological
observatories in space could see at a glance the weather
over half the planet, could watch in detail the movement
of storms and rain areas. The wonderful photographs of
the earth from V.2 rockets give a hint of what may be
done in this direction. Indeed, really accurate forecasting
may have to wait until meteorologists get out into space.
The space station has one other application of the
greatest importance, for it provides perhaps the only
means of worldwide television broadcasting. As is well
known, the reliable range of a television transmitter
extends barely beyond the horizon. A dozen stations at
least would be needed to cover completely a country as
small as Great Britain, and continental or world services
would be completely out of the question. Yet three relay
stations circling the earth could provide a steady, reliable
service from pole to pole with no more power output than
a single present-day station.
However, the first direct results of astronautics may be
less important than its indirect consequences. This has
proved true in the past of many great scientific
achievements. Copernican astronomy, Darwin's theory of
evolution, Freudian psychologythese had few immediate
practical results, but their effect on human thought was
tremendous.
We may expect the same of astronautics. With the
expansion of the world's mental horizons may come one
of the greatest outbursts of creative activity ever known.
The parallel with the Renaissance, with its great flower-
The Unesco Courier. November 1957
ing of the arts and sciences, is very suggestive. "In
human records," wrote the anthropologist J.D. Unwin,
"there is no trace of any display of productive energy
which has not been preceded by a display of expansive
energy. Although the two kinds of energy must be care¬
fully distinguished, in the past they have been . . . united
in the sense that one has developed out of the other."
Unwin continues with this quotation from Sir James
Frazer: "Intellectual progress, which reveals itself in the
growth of art and science . . . receives an immense impetus
from conquest and empire." Interplanetary travel is now
the only form of "conquest and empire" compatible with
civilization. Without it, the human mind, compelled to
circle forever in its planetary goldfish bowl, must event¬
ually stagnate.
We all know the narrow, limited type of mind which
is interested in nothing beyond its town or village, and
bases its judgments on parochial standards. We are
slowly perhaps too slowly evolving from that mentality
towards a world outlook. Few things will do more to
accelerate that evolution than the conquest of space. It
is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nation¬
alism can long survive once men see the earth in its true
perspective as a single small globe among the stars.
The solar system is rather a large place, though whether
it will be large enough for so quarrelsome an animal as
Homo sapiens remains to be seen. But it is surely rea¬
sonable to hope that the crossing of space will have a
considerable effect in reducing the psychological pressures
and tensions of our present world. Much depends, of
course, on the habitability of the other planets. It is not
likely that very large populations will, at least for many
centuries, be able to subsist outside the earth. There may
be no worlds in the solar system upon which men can
live without mechanical aids, and some of the greatest
achievements of future engineering will be concerned with
shaping hostile environments to human needs.
We must not, however, commit the too common mistake
of equating mere physical expansion, or even increasing
scientific knowledge, with "progress" however that may
be defined. Only little minds are impressed by sheer size
and number. There would be no virtue in possessing the
universe if it brought neither wisdom nor happiness. Yet
possess it we must, at least in spirit, if we are ever to
answer the questions that men have asked in vain since
history began.
Every thoughtful man has asked himself: is our race
the only intelligence in the universe, or are there other,
perhaps far higher, forms of life elsewhere? There can
be few questions more important than this, for on its out¬
come may depend all philosophyyes, and all religion too.

### 67965: The Challenge of the spaceship
Is ours the only abode of life in space?
The first discovery of planets revolving round other
suns, which was made in the United States in 1942,
has changed all ideas of the plurality of worlds.
Planets are far commoner than we had believed: there
may be thousands of millions in this galaxy alone. Few
men today would care to argue that the earth must be the
only abode of life in the whole of space.
It is true it is even likely that we may encounter no
other intelligence in the solar system. That contact may
have to wait for the day, perhaps ages hence, when we can
reach the stars. But sooner or later it must come.
There have been many portrayals in literature of these
fateful meetings. Most science-fiction writers, with
characteristic lack of imagination, have used them as an
excuse for stories of conflict and violence indistinguishable
from those which stain the pages of our own history.
Such an attitude shows a complete misunderstanding of
the factors involved.
Remember the penny and the postage stamp which Sir
James Jeans in the Mysterious Universe (1) balanced on
Cleopatra's needle. The obelisk represented the age of
the world, the penny the whole duration of man's existen¬
ce, and the stamp the length of time in which he has
been slightly civilized. The period during which life will
be possible on earth corresponds to a further column of
stamps hundreds of metres perhaps a
kilometrein height.
Thinking of this picture, we see how

CHALLENGE OF
THE SPACESHIP
(Continued) We may meet superhuman races
infinitely improbable it is that the question of interplanet¬
ary warfare can ever arise. Any races we encounter will
almost certainly be superhuman or subhuman more likely
the former, since ours must surely be one of the youngest
cultures in the universe. Only if we score a bull's eye on
that one stamp in the kilometre-high column will we
meet a race at a level of technical development sufficiently
near our own for warfare to be possible. If ships from the
earth ever set out to conquer other worlds they may find
themselves, as they arrive, in the position of painted war-
canoes drawing slowly into New York Harbour.
But if the universe does hold species so greatly in
advance of our own, then why have they never visited the
earth? There is one very simple answer to this question.
Let us suppose that such races exist: let us even suppose
that, never having heard of Einstein, they can pass from
end to end of the galaxy as quickly as they wish...
That will help them less than one might think. In 10
minutes, a man may walk along a beach but in his whole
lifetime he could not examine every grain of sand upon
it. For all that we know, there may be fleets of survey
ships diligently charting and recharting the universe.
Even making the most optimistic assumptions, they could
scarcely have visited our world in the few thousand years
of recorded history.
Man-made worlds creeping from star to star
Perhaps, even at this moment, there lies in some rather
extensive filing system a complete report on this
planet, with maps which to us would look distorted
but still recognizable. That report would show that
though the earth was teeming with life, it had no domi¬
nant species. However, certain social insects showed
considerable promise, and the file might end with the note:
"Intelligence may be emerging on this planet. Suggest
that intervals between surveys be reduced to a million
years."
I have mentioned before how limited our picture of the
universe must be so long as we are confined to this earth
alone. But the story does not end there. Our impressions
of reality are determined, perhaps more than we imagine,
by the senses through which we make contact with the
external world. How utterly different our cosmologies
would have been had nature economized with us, as she
has done with other creatures, and given us eyes incapable
of seeing the stars! Yet how pitiably limited are the eyes
we do possess, tuned as they are to a single octave in an
endless spectrum. The world in which we live is drenched
with invisible radiations, from the microwaves which we
have just discovered coming from sun and stars, to the
cosmic rays whose origin is still one of the prime mysteries
of modern physics. These things we have discovered
within the last generation, and we cannot guess what still
lies beneath the threshold of the senses though recent
discoveries in paranormal psychology hint that the search
may be only beginning. These are deep waters, and it is
time to turn back to the shore, to leave the distant dream
for the present reality of fuels and motors, of combustion-
chamber pressures and servo-mechanisms.
The desire to give a comprehensive picture of the
outcome of astronautics has compelled me to range not
unwillingly over an enormous field. However, I do not
wish anyone to think that the possibilities we have been
discussing need come in this century, or the next, or the
next. . . . Yet any of them may arise, at any time, as soon
as the first ships begin to leave the earth. Man's first
contact with other intelligent races may lie as far away in
time as the building of the Pyramids or it may be as near
as the discovery of X-rays.
Of this, at least, we may be fairly certain: barring
accidents the most obvious of which I need not specify
the exploration of the planets will be in full swing as this
century draws to its close. To examine them in any de¬
tail, and to exploit their possibilities fully, will take
hundreds of years. But man being what he is, when his
first ship circles down into the frozen wastes of Pluto, his
mind will already be bridging the gulf still lying between
him and the stars.
26
Interplanetary distances are a million times as great as
those to whijh we are accustomed in everyday life, but
interstellar distances are a million-fold greater still. Be¬
fore them even light is a hopeless laggard, taking years
to pass from one star to its neighbour. How man will
face this stupendous challenge I do not know: but face it
one day he will. Professor Bernai was, I believe, the first
to suggest that one solution might he in the use of arti¬
ficial planets, little self-contained worlds embarking upon
journeys which would last for generations. Olaf Stapledon
has expanded this theme in Star Maker, one of the great¬
est of his fantasies, but the thought of these tiny
bubbles of life, creeping from star to star on their age-long
journeys, carrying whole populations doomed never to set
foot upon any planet, never to know the passage of the
seasons or even the interchange. of night and day, is one
from which we might well recoil in horror. However those
who would make such journeys would have outlooks very
different from our own. These speculations intriguing
though they are, will hardly concern mankind in this cen¬
tury. We may, I think, expect that it will be at least years
before confinement to the solar system produces very
marked signs of claustrophobia.
Our survey is now finished. We have gone as far as is
possible, at this moment of time, in trying to assess the
impact of astronautics upon human affairs. I am not
unmindful of the fact that 50 years from now, instead
of preparing for the conquest of the outer planets, our
grandchildren may be dispossessed savages clinging to the
fertile oases in a radio-active wilderness. Yet we must
keep the problems of today in their true proportions. They
are of vital indeed of supreme importance, since they
can destroy our civilization and slay the future before
its birth. But if we survive them, they will pass into
history and the time will come when they will be as little
remembered as the causes of the Punic Wars. The cross¬
ing of space even the sense of its imminent achievement
in the years before it comes may do much to turn men's
minds outwards and away from their present tribal
squabbles. In this sense the rocket, far from being one
of the destroyers of civilization, may provide the safety-
valve that is needed to preserve it.
This point may be important. By providing an outlet
for man's exuberant and adolescent energies, astronautics
may make a truly vital contribution to the problems of
the present world. Space-flight does not even have to be
achieved for this to happen. As soon as there is a general
belief in its possibility, that belief will begin to colour
men's psychological outlook. In many ways, the very
dynamic qualities of astronautics are in tune with the
restless expansive spirit of our age.
Day-time dreamers are dangerous men
I have tried to show that the future development of
mankind, on the spiritual no less than the material
plane, is bound up with the conquest of space. To
what may be called using the words in the widest possible
sense the liberal scientific mind, I believe these argu¬
ments to be unanswerable. The only real criticism that
may be raised against them is the quantitative one that
the world is not yet ready for such changes. It is hard not
to sympathize with this view, which may be correct, but I
have given my reasons for thinking otherwise.
The future of which I have spoken is now being shaped
by men working with slide-rules in quiet offices, and by
men taking instrument readings amid the savage roar of
harnessed jets. Some are engineers, some are dreamers
but many are both. The time will come when they can
say with T. E. Lawrence: "All men dream; but not equally.
Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their
minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the
dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may
act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible."
Thus it has always been in the past, for our civilization
is no more than the sum of all the dreams that earlier
ages have brought to fulfilment. And so it must always
be, for if men cease to dream, if they turn their backs
upon the wonder of the universe, the story of our race
will be coming to an end.

SPARKING COMMUNITY EDUCATION in Liberia's bush country villages is now the job of this young man (above, left) and scores like him
from the National Fundamental Education Centre at Klay, near Monrovia, the capital. Graduates from training courses at Klay, where a joint Liberia-
Unesco project works to improve living standards through community education, go to work in villages throughout the Republic. Above all they
learn how to approach the villagers, who have been encouraged to tackle community problems and to build schools and clinics, like the model
one at Amina where Dr. P.P. Mayer, of Germany (above, right) examines one of the 3,500 patients who have registered there in the past two years.

### 67966: Tale of four villages
TALE OF FOUR VILLAGES
by Alexander Shaw
Mr. Alexander Shaw, a British film¬
maker who has worked six years for
Unesco in Africa and the Middle East,
is now developing audio-visual aids
to teaching in Liberia. Here, he tells
the story of the establishment of
a national fundamental education
centre in the West African Republic.
The village of Be-Sao is all that
the romantic traveller could
wish for. You leave the main
road and take a minor one leading to
one of the new rubber developments
and then you leave that and follow a
track through the bush and then you
walk. You come to a swamp which
you cross precariously on a very long
bridge made of two narrow tree stems
and you pass through a grove made by
an enormous, soaring cotton tree.
While travelling this path no woman
may speak. And then you come to
the village with its round mud houses
and its good-looking people and its
feeling of remoteness from the world
and its cares.
Yet the village has its problems. A
woman has a swollen and infected leg
from a scratch on a nail, a baby is
slowly dying because its mother is
giving it the wrong food, and a man
has been unconscious for two days
and no one knows what is wrong.
Three months ago the villagers would
have begged a lift to the distant
clinic for their sick and they would
have got it, but it would only have
helped the individuals and not the
community. Now, in this first week
of February 1957, they have begged
that two of their women be sent away
for training in first-aid and midwifery.
This request came from
women who would ne¬
ver normally leave their
homes for more than
twenty-four hours.

FOUR
VILLAGES
(Continued)
Planning & patience work wonders
in changing the age-old ways
The village of Weiawolo is much
further. You leave your transport
and you walk. You cross swamps on
logs half sunk in the mud or on
rickety bridges six feet above a river.
Perhaps you swim if there has been
rain further up and the river is ten
times its normal width. You walk
until the heat blinds you and you are
but a pair of legs plodding along a
trail on which you hope there is not
a bush cow, the most feared of
all the fauna of Liberia. You get to
Weiawolo and they squeeze pineapples
for you and you are happy that you
made the journey.
Angry villagers and
a closed school door
But on one visit the village was very
angry. The school-master had
not appeared for two weeks.
One old and important man was very
vexed indeed. Every day for two
weeks he had walked three miles from
a nearby village to accompany his
grand-daughters to school only to find
it closed.
A pointless story? Only three
years ago Weiawolo had to be
persuaded to build a school and
persuaded with hard argument over
many days. Of course, it was a
school for boys and the villagers never
dreamed that a girl could possibly
attend. Now they are angry because
the teacher has had to go to a funeral
and the school is shut.
The third village is. the last of a
series of villages connected to the
main road by a track. You pass
Vazalon and Baaja on the way to it.
All the villagers grow something that
they would like to send to market in
Monrovia. From the point where
their track joins the main road it is
only one hour by truck to the capital,
but it is three hours' walk to the main
road and even then they may have to
wait a day for a truck that can carry
them and their load of cassava or
coffee or fruit. Sometimes in the dry
season a truck will manage to get
through and buy the produce on the
spot and more would come regularly
if they could get there. But the
bridges get broken and the rain makes .
swamps and for the most part the
villagers either walk and chance a lift
on the main road or they let the fields
run down as being not worth the
trouble. But this is how it was
28
yesterday. Today trucks can run all
the way in any weather. All the
villagers needed was the idea that it
was possible and a little practical help
and encouragement.
These three villages are typical of
thirty or forty in the Lofa-Gola-Vei
territory of Liberia. Soon they will
be typical of villages all over the
country and this perhaps more quickly
than we now suspect.
In 1949 the Liberian Government,
aware that one part of the country
was forging ahead of the rest, that
their ever-growing rubber and mining
industries needed skilled workers, that
their plans for the development of the
country needed educated people and
that this meant teachers and that this
in its turn meant educated villagers,
embarked on a bold plan for funda¬
mental education in rural areas.
Happily they started slowly. With
Unesco's aid they sent one man on an
exploratory mission then another
and another. Here was wisdom, for
no great onslaught is going to
persuade a peasant in any country in
the world that other ways may be
better, that other attitudes may bring
a richer life. The peasant way is a
slow way and is not measured by hours
or days but by crops and seasons and
realities.
Gradually this pioneering work
resulted in the setting up of a National
Fundamental Education Centre at
Klay. Again, many people from
Unesco and the Liberian Government
worked hard and how hard they
worked can only be understood if you
try and do something in a land where
Nature fights against you with her
timeless weapons of heat and rain and
ever-attacking vegetation and they
built slowly but surely.
Needlework, housekeeping &
ideas on women's rights
Today the Centre takes forty-
two students from all over
the country. They must have
reached a certain standard at school
not necessarily a very high one they
must come from villages, and most
important of all they must return to
villages to work when they have
graduated. This year the Centre has
four women students and next year
it is hoped to increase this number.
There is one important factor: the
students are not boys, they are young
men and they bring their wives with
them. They too receive training
training in child care, in needlework,
in housekeeping and in nutrition.
Perhaps, too, they unconsciously
acquire a certain idea about the rights
of women.
The men receive training as primary
school teachers so that, if it is
required of them when they go to their
future stations, they can open a school.
They learn all aspects of fundamental
education as well. Road-building,
sanitation, agriculture, hygiene and
first-aid go side by side with arith¬
metic and English and geography.
Finally, they learn how to teach other
people to be literate.
But perhaps the most important
thing that they learn is how to
approach the villagers. The dual
approach to fundamental education is
soundly taught: learn from the villagers
things that you can take to other
places, give to the villagers that which
you have learned in other places.
Moses had great charm
Siafe was good-humoured
When the present batch of
students has graduated there
will be about 100 fundamental
education workers spread across the
country (it is not a very big country),
and they will be followed every year
by an increasing number of men and
women who have learned simple
things that could transform the whole
land.
Now let us take a look at our fourth
village Ghangbanma. A surprise visit
was paid to this village recently.
There were two ex-students working
there. At the Centre neither was
particularly good, neither particularly
bad. Moses had a great deal of
charm. Siafe was good-humoured.
Moses did indeed have a very bright
wife, Fata. Siafe had no wife, at
least not officially.
They had both been in Ghangbanma
for four months. First of all, the
villagers, although looking upon them
as strangers, found them agreeable
strangers. This was the important
first step. Moses and Siafe had not
sat down and spent a lot of time
finding out the real needs of the
villagers which is one approach to
the problem. They had simply put

ROUGH TRACK becomes an all-weather road as villagers of Dimeh, a Liberian bush village apply "self-help" with some aid and encouragement
from trainees and instructors of the fundamental education centre. Previously villagers carried their produce for three hours to reach main road
and then often waited an entire day for a truck going to Monrovia. Now trucks come directly from market to collect fruit and vegetables.
into practice everything they had
learned at the Centre.
First of all they had transformed
their own ordinary homes provided by
the villagers, into reasonable models
of what homes should be. Not ideal
homes, of course, but the sort of home
that any village women could achieve.
Fata's children were always reasonably
clean and neatly dressed, her house
was clean, bedding was put out to air,
food was covered and so was the
water pot. Simple things about which
they did not boast but just did them
every day quite naturally. Then
Moses built his wife a high stove and
every day when she cooked the open
windows were lined with people
watching and commenting.
Moses and Siafe started a school.
It was not a great success for a week
or two; then, suddenly, the idea caught
on and they had to turn away pupils
from other villages. The village
caught on too and cut sticks, promised
labour and gave land. Very soon
there will be a new school with
dormitories for those children from far
away. Nobody knows how the two
men will run a boarding school, but
they will manage.
They built soak pits for the place
where their washing is done so that
they do not make a small swamp every
time they wash their clothes. And
they built pit latrines and bath houses.
They were rather clever about this as
they built two types of bath houses
one for the richer people and one for
the poorer. All the prosperous people
built the better ones so that they could
prove they were important and all the
others built the other type because it
was the thing to 'do.
'Do it yourself teachers
made education work
The important point was that
everyone used them when they
were built. Moses and Siafe
helped one man with his coffee
pruning and everyone wanted to learn
the new method. They said that the
nearby bridge was a disgrace and
started to repair it themselves and
everyone joined in. In fact, funda¬
mental education worked.
It is no good pretending that
everyone in the village has rushed to
do all these things but some have.
And some will lead to many.
The Centre has been handed over
to Liberian direction but Unesco has
its heart in the affair and will continue
to support it by sending specialists
when they are required. Indeed, two
will continue to work there under the
directorship of the already legendary
Miss Wilhelmina Bryant. Under a
Unesco . fellowship, New Zealand,
Samoa, India and Egypt were visited
by Miss Bryant and happily gave up
the deepest secrets of their funda¬
mental education techniques. She has
taken them all, added them to Liberian
methods and out of this mixture will
develop still newer and more suitable
approaches to the task of raising the
level of understanding of her country
people.
This is a chronicle of small events
and you may have read it all before in
a different setting. But it is the total
of these small events that could
change the world change it quickly
and for the better.

### 67967: The Unusual whistle language of the Canary Islanders
THE UNUSUAL WHISTLE LANGUA6E
OF THE CANARY ISLANDERS
by André Classe
Lecturer on Phonetics, University of Glasgow
The word "Speech" for most of us means a method of
communication based on a system of sounds produced
by the action of the throat, tongue, lips, etc. We know
of course that there are other processes used for special pur¬
poses : writing, for instance, is a useful substitute in certain
cases, and gestures can adequately replace vocal noises when
some physical defect of the ear impedes sound-perception.
What is less well-known is that there exist in the world a
number of languages which have an acoustic basis but never¬
theless do not use the normal sound material of speech, that
is to say vowels and consonants as we usually understand
these terms. For example, in La Gomera (one of the smaller
and less-developed islands of the Canary Archipelago) the
inhabitants can converse by means of articulated whistles. For
ordinary conversation they use normal
spoken Spanish, but whenever distance
makes speech inconvenient or impossible,
they resort to the silbo, as this whistled
form of speech is called.
The configuration of the island is such
that walking from one point to another,
not necessarily distant, may be an ar¬
duous and slow process. Gomera is of
volcanic origin and exceedingly moun¬
tainous. It is almost circular in shape,
with a high peak in the centre, the Alto
of Garajonay. From Garajonay deep
and narrow gorges separated by rocky
ridges reach down to the coast like the
spokes of a wheel. There are no plains.
Moving over such ground involves the
expenditure of much time and energy.
This is why the silbo is of such cons¬
tant utility to Gomeros : a message can
be whistled effortlessly over a couple of
miles which it might take an hour to
cover on foot. And two miles is by
no means an exceptional figure. A good
whistler (silbador) will be heard and
understood five miles away or more when conditions are
favourable, that is to say if there is little or no wind. I was
informed that the record was fourteen kilometres, about nine
miles, and any one who has heard a first-class silbador will
realize that there is no inherent improbability in this figure.
The point is that a whistle is practically a pure tone of un¬
changing quality and the only significant variables are pitch
and duration, so that there are no weak overtones and tran¬
sients to be lost, and if the tone is perceived at all it will be
intelligible. So the silbo scores over shouted speech in two
major respects: articulation does not suffer in any way when
an effort is made to increase loudness, and sounds which in
speech have a low level of audibility, as most consonants
have, are as easily heard a thousand yards away as at close
quarters; and it is superior to visual "codes" in that it is as
rapid as spoken Spanish.
30
There are a good many methods of whistle emission in use
at Gomera. The only one never employed is the common
lip-whistle which is insufficiently loud for the purpose. Nor¬
mally one inserts one or two fingers, or a bent knuckle, into
the mouth, the front of the tongue being immobilized, and
the lips kept spread and rigid. With some practice it is
possible by these means to produce a tone of astonishing
loudness, purity and carrying power over a compass of some
three octaves.
Not that this range is ever used by any one silbador; the
limits are invariably a couple of octaves. In the east, the
tendency is to whistle in the upper range, elsewhere in the
lower. Some practitioners do not use the fingers at all but
form a groove in the front part of the tongue which is in
contact with the upper incisors, and they
use the hands to form a kind of mega¬
phone. The volume of tone thus pro¬
duced is comparable to that obtained by
other methods.
'There is nothing very striking about
all this and anyone with a sound set of
teeth can learn in a couple of days to
produce a sound reminiscent of a steam-
whistle. What is more extraordinary is
that this simple noise can be modulated
in such a way as to fulfil all the func¬
tions of the spoken language, although
it lacks all the variations of tone quality
which one has come to regard as the
very essence of speech. And this is
achieved by the simplest of means.
Briefly, the silbador, while producing
the whistled tone, attempts to perform
exactly the same movements with his
speech-organs as if he were actually
talking.
Of course his articulation is bound to
differ in several respects from the nor¬
mal one. In the first place the lips cannot move, so that
two vowels like ee and oo, which in speech are pronounced
with spread and rounded lips respectively, will have identical
labial articulations; in the second place the front part of the
tongue cannot move because of the insertion of the fingers,
and the tongue movements are performed exclusively by the
two posterior thirds of the tongue; in the third place, the
glottis remains open as there is no "voicing" (some whistlers
do produce a laryngeal grunt but this is inaudible a few
yards away, and without significance); finally, movements
of the soft palate, although they do take place, have no effect
on the tone.
Normal articulation is aimed at but only a
rough approximation is achieved. This is,
however, quite sufficient for the purpose of
complete intelligibility, and anything that can

WHISTLE LANGUAGE (Continued)
CONVERSING ACROSS
MILES Or TERRAIN
The people of La Gomera, in the Canary Islands, con¬
trived a whistled language so they could speak to each
other across their steep hills and ravines. The island has
the general shape of a large tent, sloping down from a .
central peak to sheer cliffs at the sea's edge. Deep gorges
radiating from the centre cut up the terrain like the
spokes of a wheel. In this difficult mountainous country
two points only 500 yards apart as the crow flies may be
as much as an hour apart in walking time. That is why
the si/6o, as the whistled form of speech is called, is of
constant utility, enabling the ¡slanders to converse quite
easily and distinctly across several miles of terrain.
\jimf*
be said in Spanish can be whistled and understood perfectly.
Without giving a complete description of the phonetic structure
of the silbo (1) we can see how this works if we consider one
or two elementary cases.
If we whistle a few notes, say doh, mi, soh, we notice that
as the pitch goes up the tongue rises in the mouth. This is
because the pitch of a whistle depends on the volume of air
in the mouth cavity, and tongue movements cause this volume
to vary. So if we attempt to pronounce the vowel ee (as in
beat) the free part of the tongue rises towards the palate,
reducing the size of the mouth-cavity, and the pitch of our
whistle will be high. If we repeat the performance with ah
(as in psalm) the tongue will go down, the cavity will become
larger, and our whistle-pitch will be much lower than in the
first case. Thus the tongue position associated with a given
vowel will be associated with a certain pitch instead of a
certain tone-quality for the spoken vowel.
Psalm-whistling shepherds
locked out of church
The case of consonants is somewhat more complex but
fundamentally identical. One example will make this
clear. If we attempt to whistle the group oto, the ton¬
gue starts from the o position, which is low, then rises until it
touches the palate for the /, and finally goes back to the o
(1) Such a description will be found in my article "The Phonetics of
the Silbo Gomero," in Archivum Linguisticum, Glasgow, September,
1957.
position. In terms of mouth-cavity volume, this varies pro¬
gressively from a maximum to zero and back to maximum. In
terms of pitch we start at a low level which rises abruptly for
the first part of the t articulaion, then the tone is interrupted
by the contact tongue-palate, and finally we have an abrupt
glide down to the o level. (See graph on page 31). In point of
fact, some onsonants produce very similar sound-patterns, but
because of ihe phonetic structure of Spanish, ambiguities could
only occur in isolated words. In a complete sentence the
context makes everything clear, and when recordings were
played back to them silbadores were invariably accurate in
their translations.
However unlike ordinary speech the silbo may sound, it has
in fact many of the characteristics of. the spoken word. For
example each silbador has his own individual style, as when
he speaks: you can recognize him by his manner of whistling
as you would from his speech peculiarities. For the Gomero,
the silbo is clearly a perfectly natural mode of expression. It
is even on record that on Christmas Day, 1862, the Alcalde of
San Sebastian (the capital of Gomera) had the doors of the
church locked to keep the shepherds out because they persis¬
ted in ignoring his injunction not to whistle the words of the
Psalms during mass.
So the silbo is not purely utilitarian or useful only for
transmission of elementary messages. Anything that is speak-
able is also "whistlable". That this should be possible,
given the poverty of the material of the silbo, is due to the
simplicity of the sound-system of Spanish, the preponderance
of vowels over consonants, and the relative rarity and simpli¬
city of consonantal groups. It would not work nearly so
weir with a language like English.

The Unesco Courier. November 1957
Letters to the Editor
Sir,
Ever since I have received The
Unesco Courier I have found it most
interesting and enjoyable. However,
it is your issue of May, 1957 which
finally moves me to write: it was
superb.
Two of your articles I found of
such interest and beauty that I 'should
like to have the material in more
permanent form than the pages of the
magazine. "Forty Jumps Through
the Universe" seems to me a most
skilful and original presentation, espe¬
cially valuable for teaching purposes,
but fascinating to anyone. As men¬
tioned in your article, that will be
available in book form. However, I
wonder if it might be possible to
obtain either through you or directly
from the artist, some of the wonderful
pictures of Axel Poignant's "Lost in
the Australian Bush"? There indeed
was photographic poetry; I should be
most delighted if it were possible to
obtain prints of some of his pictures,
especially that of the little girl with
the lizard.
Even if that should not be possible,
permit me to express my great appre¬
ciation for your magazine.

Connecticut, U.S.A.
Editor's Note: Mr. Axel Poignant in¬
forms us that his photo feature "Lost
in the Australian Bush" has been de¬
veloped into a full-length volume with
text and photographs and will shortly
be available in book form under the
title "Piccaninny Walkabout" publish¬
ed by Angus and Robertson, Sydney
and London, price 12/6d.
Sir,
...I am much interested in the letters
published in The Unesco Courier
recently... It is not conducive to world
peace to make out any people or any
country as having no poverty, no igno¬
rance, no sickness, no problems, no
unemployment. If you run a series of
photos on mass feeding in Italy, Lon¬
don, etc. why not show children in
America being fed on government
surplus; if you picture adults learning
to read and write in far-off lands, why
not those attending our evening
schools ; if you describe diseases of
malnutrition in India, why not among
our mountain whites?
We must admit that there are Ame¬
ricans who make a show of their
wealth and their standard of living
but every country has those. I agree
with the correspondent who suggested
that your articles and pictures would
make us believe that only dark-skinned
races are at a disadvantage economi¬
cally, in culture, in health, etc. That
breeds smugness in some and envy and
resentment in others, We need to
develop a sense of the weaknesses and
failures of our own culture and work
on these even while we send Care
packages and aid to refugees-

Sir,
It is always with great pleasure that
I receive my copy of The Unesco
Courier. Each issue is a precious
source of facts that every teacher
should possess. I read some of the
articles to my older pupils and they
are shocked to find there is so much
misery in the world.
The April 1957 issue dealt with the
problem of hunger. As you may
know Canadian children have plenty
in eat; some even have four meals a
day. It is far too much, isn't it?
After I had read Melville Hardiment's
article, "The Year the Rains Failed",
one pupil wrote, "When we compare
our standard of living with that of
these people, we find we are favoured
to the greatest possible degree. We
get three good meals a day, and no
one dies of hunger. But we often
hear it said, 'he is ill or he has died
because he ate too much'. We ought
to thank Providence and think of
other less fortunate people."
On page 14 of the same issue
(French edition only) you say that the
Canadian national dish is pea soup.
My class says that it should be pork
and beans and apple pie. I think they
are right.

Sir,
I am a young reader of your maga¬
zine. I find the anieles extremely
interesting and I like the appearance
of the magazine. In the July issue
which I have just received I was espe¬
cially interested in the article dealing
with Unesco's work in the field of
translating classical works from the
Orient and the Occident. I think
Unesco should see about making
direct translations into Russian of the
classical works of the Orient and Asian
countries. The Russian reader who
does not know French or English has
no chance of getting to know these
masterpieces of world literature.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
I NDIA'S FARM FORUMS: Radio
Farm Forums, started on an experimental
basis in Bombay State last year, have proved
remarkably successful and have provided
an incentive for large scale community
action. The experiment was financed by
Unesco and carried out by the Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting. The Radio
Forums of 20 members each were organiz¬
ed in 150 villages, and a series of 20 spe¬
cial programmes were broadcast which
people later discussed. The forums were en¬
thusiastically received by the villagers and
stimulated community action from the
opening of reading rooms to widespread
vaccination of cattle.
H ATOMIC RADIATION DANGERS:
The World Health Organization (WHO)
Study Group on the Effect of Radiation
on Human Heredity reports; "All man-
made radiation must be regarded as
harmful to man from the genetic point
of view." Sources of man-made radia¬
tion are principally X-ray tubes and
nuclear reactors, and artificial radio¬
active elements distributed by man in
nature, such as waste products from
reactors. Particular concern was expres¬
sed about genetic hazards of radiation
from atomic materials used in medi¬
cine, industry, commerce and experi¬
mental science. The dangers of exces¬
sive exposure to X-rays is also stressed
in a special issue of the WHO Chronicle,
entitled "Challenge of Atomic Energy."
MiUSICAL YOUTH AT WORLD'S
FAIR: For ten days next July Brussels will
become the world's music capital when
more than 2,000 young people from 20
countries will meet there at the XHIth
Congress of the International Federation of
Musical Youth which will be held in the
grounds of the great Brussels International
Exhibition. An orchestra from a different
country will play each evening, and the
closing concert will be given by an inter¬
national orchestra of young musicians from
the Congress all amateurs and all under
30 years of age. Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Music Council will be represented at
the Congress.
H A WOMAN'S NATIONALITY: The
U.N. Convention on the Nationality of
Married Women has now been signed
by 19 states and ratified by two the
United Kingdom and Israel. Adopted
by the U.N. General Assembly last
January, it will come into effect 90
days after six states have ratified or
acceded to it. It provides that a
woman's nationality is not affected by
the fact of her marriage or by its
dissolution, or a change in her husband's
national status. Contracting parties also
agree to speed naturalization formalities
to enable a woman of foreign nationality
to acquire her husband's nationality if
she wishes.
TiHE NEWS ALLIANCE: Major news
agencies in 16 European countries recently
founded the European Alliance of News
Agencies with temporary headquarters in
Brussels. The Alliance will encourage the
wider exchange of news, promote co-opera¬
tion among its members in developing news
techniques, and safeguard their common
interests. Members have associated them¬
selves with Unesco's programme to pro¬
mote the free flow of information.

the postal despatch of books, newspapers
and other printed materials, at its recent
Congress in Ottawa. Under the new
provisions books may be sent in packets
of up to 5 kilograms instead of 3 kgs.,
and this may be increased to 10 kgs. by
special' arrangement. Books will enjoy
the reduced airmail rate now conceded
to newspapers. Publications for the
blind will be exempt from all postal
taxes and registration charges. The new
provisions are expected to go into effect
in October 1958.
rPJ NDERSTANDING EAST AND
WEST: A one-week, study course for jour¬
nalists on the theme of East-West under¬
standing has been organized in Zurich by the
Swiss National Commission for Unesco.
The course was designed as a contribution
to Unesco's major project to increase under¬
standing between Orient and Occident, and
was open to professional journalists cover¬
ing foreign news for newspapers with a
maximum circulation of 12,000 copies, serv¬
ing rural areas. Journalists attending the
course have had an opportunity of studying
various aspects of news coverage for Asian
countries and the services available in
Switzerland, of visiting the offices of a Swiss
daily newspaper to see the documentation
kept on Asian countries, and of meeting
Asian press representatives and students in
Switzerland.
EDUCATIONAL TRAVEL CON¬
CESSIONS: In response to a proposal
by Unesco, the Pan-American Railway
Association at its recent Congress in
Buenos Aires urged member govern¬
ments and railway systems to grant the
greatest possible rate reductions and
facilities to educational travellers and to
educational, scientific and cultural mate¬
rials. Fourteen Latin American coun¬
tries and the United States of America,
representing the major railway systems
of North and South America, took part
in the meeting.
M. N THE COMMON INTEREST:
Twelve years of international effort to solve
common problems were celebrated on Octo¬
ber 24, the day officially set aside as Uni¬
ted Nations Day whose theme this year
was "in the common interest." Since the
charter was signed in 1945, by 51 nations,
3 1 other states have pledged themselves un¬
der its terms "to maintain international
peace and security, and to ensure... that
armed force shall not be used, save in the
common interest." Six new member states
have joined the U.N. since the last U.N. Day:
Ghana, Japan, Malaya, Morocco, Sudan and
Tunisia. Progress in the development of
the peaceful uses of atomic energy is noted
in the unanimous approval, by eighty-two
governments, of the constitution for an
International Atomic Energy Agency, under
U.N. auspices.
