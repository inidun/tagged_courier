RITY
In recent months we have received many letters
from students, teachers and librarians in the schools
and universities of Africa and Asia enquiring about the
possibility of free subscriptions to the Unesco Courier.
The writers had been introduced to the magazine as a
result of a free distribution of numbers published in
1989, 1990 and 1991. In many different countries the
discovery aroused the same interest and occasioned
the same insistent appeal.
The fact is that the extent of the response took us
by surprise. We do our best to produce a magazine
that reflects the humanist and universalist ideals of
Unesco. But we never imagined the depth of the need
to which these ideals are a response. In countries
faced with the problem of sheer survival we were
inclined to think that food and nutrition were the sole
priorities. However, the letters we have received let us
know in no uncertain terms that while rice and wheat,
vaccines and antibiotics are urgently needed, it is
equally important to create the future.
The letters tell us that young people everywhere
are not satisfied with mere survival; they want to
build a better future. To do so they must be aware of
what is happening, not only in their own immediate
neighbourhood but in the world at large. They need to
learn to think for themselves about the problems they
face, while at the same time remaining faithful to
their own values. But they must also come to terms
with the problems of the wider world they are helping
to shape, and that means looking out to other cultures
than their own and adopting universal norms and
values.
We feel honoured that these students, teachers and
librarians from Bangladesh and India, from Senegal
and Benin, think that the Unesco Courier can help to
show them the world in all its diversity and its
fundamental unity. In return, they have helped us to
realize that everywhere, even in lands where life can
be extremely hard, people continue to dream, to hope
and to look further than their own immediate
situation, regarding themselves as members and
creators of a single humanity.
We have
already provided
a certain number of
free subscriptions and
will continue to do so.
But our limited resources
prevent us from doing this on
a large scale.
As a result we are appealing to
subscribers in the more affluent
countries and asking them to help in two
different ways.
First we appeal to those of you who may be
willing to offer a "solidarity subscription" to a
school, university or library in a country of the
South we shall be happy to give you the address and
other details of the recipient of your subscription.
But you can also help in another way. The requests
we have received from the countries of the South for
free subscriptions to the Courier are only the tip of the
iceberg. They bear witness to a desire for intellectual
solidarity that is an extraordinary manifestation of
optimism in a time of widespread disarray.
Solidarity is urgently needed, but it has traditionally
taken the form of emergency aid, attempts to halt
massacres, cure epidemics and overcome famine. It is
now time to go further and by direct, personal action
build bridges between peoples in new areas in culture,
images, books and ideas.
This appeal is an invitation to explore this territory.
You can take part by writing to us and letting us know
about your ideas, however tentative, and experiences
of these forms and areas of solidarity. We shall be
happy to publish the most interesting of your comments
and thereby provide a forum for an international
exchange of ideas.
Help us to build new bridges.

### 93427: Interview with José Carreras
INTERVIEW
JOSE CARRERAS
talks to
Serafín García
José Carreras is one of the
leading lyric tenors of our time.
His operatic repertoire
comprises some 60 roles which
he has performed all over the
world under the direction of
outstanding conductors, notably
Herbert von Karajan. He is also
a brilliant singer of lieder and
folk songs. During a career
which has been interrupted by
serious illness, he has won
many national and international
honours. The creator of a
medical research foundation
which bears his name, José
Carreras is one of today's great
servants of music.
Didyoufirst become interested in músicas
a child?
I had a rather happy childhood. There was
one very revealing moment I particularly
remember. I was only four when my family left
Barcelona where, by the way, I was born
on 5 December 1946 and emigrated to
Argentina. Times had become very hard in
Barcelona, which was still suffering from the
after-effects of the Spanish Civil War and the
Second World War. For political and financial
reasons, my parents had decided to try their
luck on the other side of the Atlantic. But
they were soon disappointed, and we came
back to Spain after a year.
But what I chiefly remember about our
expedition was the crossing. I had a great time
on the boat and, I think, amused the other
passengers with my imitations of tango singers
and dancers.
Were you just havingfun, ordoyou think
it was already a sign that you had a vocation
for music? How didyou become a singer?
Through a whole chain of circumstances, of
course, and not because of some sudden in¬
spiration. Like all other five- or six-year-old
boys in Catalonia, I dreamed of playing foot¬
ball and scoring more goals than anyone else.
I also wanted to spend as much time as possible
in the cinema. In those days there wasn't much
else to do in one's spare time. We had a season
ticket to the cinema and would sometimes sit
through two showings in succession.
I enjoyed taking off a very popular singer
called Luis Mariano. But what really encour¬
aged me most to take up singing was the film
The Great Caruso, with Mario Lanza in the
title role. The day after I saw the film I started
imitating Mario Lanza, and I noticed I was able
to reproduce almost all the arias in The Great
Caruso, which I'd never heard before, with
startling accuracy. My parents weren't exactly
great opera-lovers, but they were so impressed
they started wondering whether my love of
music was not after all a sign that I really had
a vocation. They gave me a record-player and
records of The Great Caruso and Neapolitan
songs sung by Giuseppe di Stefano. I was
absolutely thrilled.
I was eight when my father enrolled me at
the Barcelona Conservatory and took me for
the first time to a performance of Verdi's Aida
at the Teatro del Liceo in Barcelona. It was
pure magic! Attending a live performance of an
opera, with all the singers, the orchestra, the
sets, the atmosphere and all the rest, was a
decisive experience for me. Three years later,
when I was eleven, I got a chance to appear on
the stage of the great Teatro del Liceo when I
played a child in Manuel de Falla's ElRetablo
de Maese Pedro. It was a difficult part to sing
as it was written for soprano.
After this promising debut, my parents
began to take serious advice on whether or not
I should embark on a singing career. They
made such a fuss over me that the pianist and
conductor José Iturbi thought it wise to
dampen their enthusiasm a bit by pointing
out that they would have to wait until my
voice broke before coming to any decision. In
the meantime, I was encouraged to specialize
in science and began to study chemistry. But I
found it pretty hard going. All I could think of
was singing. In the end, on the occasion of
my twenty-first birthday during the 1967-
1968 academic year, I finally decided to take up
## [Page 5](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/093440engo.pdf#page=5) 0
### 93427: Interview with José Carreras
the career that was clearly closest to my heart.
Shortly afterwards I made the acquain¬
tance of someone who was to become one of
my closest friends, Montserrat Caballé. She
had great confidence in me from the very start.
She arranged for me to sing with her at the
Teatro del Liceo in 1970. It was there too that
I played Gennaro in Gaetano Donizetti's
Lucrezia Borgia. After that, I was asked to
appear at all the world's great opera-houses.
What does music mean to you?
It's first and foremost my profession, which
is in itself important to me. But above all it is
the only channel through which I can express
some of my deeper emotions. Although I'm
someone who tends to keep himself to himself,
when I sing I discover private feelings within
me which I try to communicate to the
audience.
Singing is all about communicating. That's
why technique is important. The better your
technique, the more likely you are to be able
to communicate. But that's not enough. A
singer must also be able, through technique, to
inject life and substance into music, to give it
a soul. Technique and a fine voice can never
suffice on their own.
That's why I think the "perfection" of a
recording, obtained after a lot of technical tin¬
kering, can never surpass a live performance,
for all its inevitable imperfections. As I've
often said, when you're a tenor you must start
singing in the heart, move up to the head, then
let it out through the voice. Your heart, which
wants to express a number of emotions, is the
point of departure. But it wouldn't serve much
purpose unless your head took charge and
warned you not to overdo it or, on the
contrary, to let rip a bit more. It is by that
subtly circuitous route that the voice, work¬
ing hand in hand with technique, can genuinely
express the emotions of the heart while at the
same time obeying the instructions of the
mind.
Is opera the only kind ofsingingyou like?
What do you think offlamenco, for example,
a popular art based on cante jondo, or "deep
song, " which seems outlandish to some and is
a delight to others?
When well performed, cante jondo is an
extraordinarily sensitive, sophisticated and
expressive form of singing, especially when
the emotional charge is such that the singer, just
as he seems to have given his all and is on the
point of collapse, somehow manages to
summon up enough strength to lend his final
burst of song a timbre so personal it becomes
unique.
I'm a great fan oleante jondo, and by that
I mean genuine cante jondo. What I can't stand,
however, is the watered-down version that is
so often served up to us.
Do you also appreciate other types ofmusic,
like jazz or rock?
Please don't imagine that professional clas¬
sical musicians, and especially those who work
in opera, spend all their time listening only to
Wagner or Verdi. I love classical music, I love
symphonic music, but I also love pop, rock and
other types of music it all depends on what
mood I'm in.
I like pop music when it's well performed.
And sometimes I really adore it. Take the
Beatles, for example. They first began to be
widely played when I was still in my teens.
They left a deep impression on my generation.
I still regard them as great musicians. When it's
good, their kind of music is something that I
respond to with intensity.
When it comes down to it, then, the only dis¬
tinction you make is between good music and
bad music.
Absolutely. While we're on the subject, let
me anticipate a question I'm often asked
whether operatic tenors should sing so-called
popular music or not. I think they should,
first because I like listening to that kind of
music and singing it, and then because it may
also be a way of attracting a new audience to
opera.
I was about to ask you what you think
about the charge ofelitism that is often levelled
at opera and classical music in general.
It's true they are often accused of being eli¬
tist. In the old days that kind of accusation
might have seemed justified. But times have
changed. Nowadays, classical music and opera
are appreciated by an ever-wider public from
an increasingly broad social background. That
is partly due to the performers themselves,
who are much less likely to behave like prima
donnas nowadays. But the main reason for
the change is the influence of the audiovisual
media, which have enabled hundreds of thou¬
sands of people to get to know and enjoy this
kind of music. Like any other form of artistic
expression, music needs an audience. It can
only be decoded and become accessible if it
reaches the public you can't love anything
until you know it.
How would you relate music to other añs
likepainting, sculpture and literature?
Music has one specific characteristic, which
has both advantages and drawbacks, but which
makes it livelier than many other forms of
artistic expression: it is produced instanta¬
neously. That means that in certain circum¬
stances it has an extra emotive force and a quite
extraordinary expressive power. Having said
that, I should add that I also adore literature.
Do you think that a painting, say, can in¬
spire a range of emotions, from the deepest
gloom to the wildest euphoria, as powerfully
as music?
It's not impossible. But it's literature, of
course, that comes closest to music in this res¬
pect. After all, opera is a marriage ofwords and
music.

J
7fyou were marooned on a desert island and
could take only one work by each great com¬
poserwithyou, which ones wouldyou choose?
What an agonizing choice that would be! I
would definitely take Mozart's Marriage of
Figaro and Bellini's Norma with me. I couldn't
do without Rossini's The Barber ofSeville or
Donizetti's The Elixir of Love. I'd also take
Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, Bizet's Carmen
and Puccini's La Bohême. As for Verdi, how
could one possibly choose between Rigoletto,
La Traviata and // Trovatorel
Which are yourfavourite operatic roles?
Rodolfo in La Bohême and Don José in
Carmen are two of my favourites. I also like
Nemorino in The Elixir ofLove.
Do you still ever get first-night nerves?
don't know whether what I feel is really
nerves. All I do know is that on the day of a big
premiere I start giving myself a check-up the
moment I wake up. I examine my instrument,
that is to say my voice. I try to reassure myself
that all is well, physically and psychologically,
and that my voice is responding properly to the
instructions it is getting from my brain. Why
does one have nerves like that? Perhaps
because if you're a member of the chorus, a
small mistake can go unnoticed, whereas a
single muffed note by a tenor can be of
momentous importance.
People often say that opera is going through
a crisis. Do you agree?
It seems always to have been the case but
this is a very controversial subject. I myself see
a crisis looming on the horizon because there
isn't enough young blood at the moment to
keep the complex structure of opera firmly
on its feet. This shortage of talent has attained
alarming proportions. Unless a new generation
emerges soon, opera is in danger of going into
terminal decline.
You 're a man ofgreat curiosity anda wide
range of interests. Is there another field in
which you wouldhave liked to excel?
When I was very small, as I told you, I was
mad about soccer. Like countless other Spanish
boys, I dreamt of playing centre forward for
Spain, or for Barcelona. But I think it would be
going too far to talk of frustration. If I hadn't
gone in for singing and classical music, I'd
certainly have chosen some other activity to do
with art.
Does yourprofessionalwork leaveyou time
to devote yourselfto your other activities?
I try not to perform more than two or three
times a week. I strive to reconcile my profes¬
sional life with my private life. It's not always
easy, especially now that I have a third activity
on top of all my other commitments the
foundation which bears my name, and whose
purpose is to fight leukaemia.
Whatgaveyou the idea ofsetting up theJosé
Carreras Foundation?

### 93427: Interview with José Carreras
I got the idea of setting up the Foundation
after my personal experience of leukaemia.
As you may know, I was ill for almost a year.
During that time, the great support and encour¬
agement I got from lots of people helped me
fight and, eventually, beat the disease. It was
then that I discovered that the tenors usually
described as my rivals, Luciano Pavarotti and
Placido Domingo, were not just great singers
but also wonderful human beings. When it
was time for them to leave after paying me a
visit, one of them would say "Bon courage,
champ! " and the other "José, you've got to pull
through, otherwise there won't be anyone left
for me to match myself with." It was words
like that, and a host of others from much less
well-known people, that helped me through
the ordeal. And that's what gave me the idea
that if I ever recovered I would set up a
Foundation to help fight that terrible disease.
What has the Foundation achieved so far?
It has already become very well known,
and several distinguished people are involved
in it. Its technical committee is headed by
Professor E. Donald Thomas, who won the
Nobel Prize for medicine, and several leading
Spanish and American scientists. The
Foundation, which was set up in Barcelona in
1988, already has offices in the United States,
Switzerland and Austria. We have some very
ambitious plans and programmes. Our main
aim is to help scientific research with funding
and grants. Scientists believe that the best way
to help fight the disease is to step up research
efforts.
Where does it get its money from?
The Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
González is the Foundation's honorary pres¬
ident. His support has been very valuable.
Many public and private institutions have
taken their cue from him and given us moral
and financial support. We've also raised finance
for the Foundation in recent years by organiz¬
ing gala performances around the world in
which I have sung. Then there have been dona¬
tions from the public. When they are well
informed, people are extremely generous.
Is there anyparticular message you would
like to pass on?
suffered from leukaemia and recovered
from it. Leukaemia is a very serious disease, but
there was nothing exceptional about my re¬
covery. Scientists now say people have an increas¬
ingly good chance of recovery. But you have to
want to recover. So I'd like to say to those
suffering from the disease that, even if there's
only a chance in a million of getting better, that
chance could be yours. You have to fight, and
fight by drawing on all your inner resources.
You'll be surprised how great they are.

Editorial by Bahtjat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat
Vióleme
VIOLENCE today seems to be all around us. It is something we cannot ignore. Is
it more widespread than it once was, or is it simply appearing in more blatant
forms? Even if we are not directly confronted with violence it is impossible to
shut our eyes and ears to its existence. If we are spared violence in our homes, it lies
in wait for us elsewhere, when we take the subway, perhaps, or travel by air. We see
it every day on the screen, in news and current affairs broadcasts and in fiction. We
end up by expecting to encounter violence on every street corner.
Something in the terrible twilight of our century seems to call forth violence as
inevitably as storm-clouds herald a storm. With the collapse of European commu¬
nism, the balances that reposed on the East-West bipolar system have been upset.
But when the great wind of freedom began to blow through the world, fear also
began to spread, an insidious fear of the new, the unknown, the unexpected.
We live in a world in the throes of change, a world of multifarious possibilities, a
world in which everything must be reinvented. But as things stand at present, not
everyone has a chance to participate in this rebirth. The disparities are too great be¬
tween those who can contribute to the forces of change and those who are
condemned to passively endure their repercussions. The disinherited far outnumber
the privileged, the powerful are infinitely stronger than the weak. Confronted with
too many challenges at once, individuals, minorities and nations are tending to turn in
upon themselves, to reject others and to reject change itself. Tensions, conflicts and
rigidity seem to be reappearing, both in our personal lives and in the communities to
which we belong.
Violence, then, is near at hand. Since it has existed since the dawn of history and is
so deeply rooted in the unconscious, how could it fail to find, in the prevailing cli¬
mate of disarray, increasing opportunities to show its face and appear in new guises?
What are the origins of violence? Some scientists, and not the least distinguished,
have suggested that the causes of violence are specifically biological a thesis which
was convincingly rejected at a meeting of leading scholars held in Seville in 1986.
Does violence have a socio-economic basis? Is it a consequence of the insoluble
contradiction between individual and social experience? In what conditions does it
cease to be latent and erupt? Do the mass media report it accurately or do they give
overdue attention to it and make it worse?
These are some of the questions that are posed in this issue. Underlying them is a
concern to know whether, and if so how, it is possible to respond to violence other¬
wise than by further violence. Some answers to these questions are to be found in
ethics, in politics and in art. They are based on the imperative of respect for the
person, for personal rights and freedoms, on a course of political action that looks to
negotiation and not repression, and on a form of co-operation that everywhere
honours justice and solidarity.
The task involved is immense and never-ending. It is more urgent than ever today.

Los Angeles (1992).
OCTOBER 1990 in Vaulx-en-Velin, a quiet,
depressed working-class town in the
suburbs of Lyon, France: several hun¬
dred youths, many of them second-generation
immigrants from the Maghrib, take to the
streets and confront police after a neighbour¬
hood teenager dies in a motorcycle accident
caused by a patrol car. For three days, they
clash with law enforcement officials and riot
troops hastily dispatched by the government,
stoning police vans, ransacking stores and set¬
ting 200 cars on fire. When calm finally returns,
dozens of injured are counted, damage is esti¬
mated at some $120 million, and the country is
in shock. The long-simmering rage of the ban¬
lieues declining peripheral areas with high
densities of degraded public housing tops the
political agenda.

identical chain of events triggers several nights
of rioting on the Hartcliffe estate, a poor

killed in a collision with an unmarked police

on the rampage through the local shopping

urban guerrilla zone. Similar disturbances
break out that summer in Coventry, Man¬
chester, Salford, Blackburn and Birmingham.
April 1992 in Los Angeles: the acquittal of
four white police officers in the brutal video¬
taped beating of Rodney King, a defenceless
black motorist arrested after a car chase, sets
off an explosion of civil violence unmatched in
American history this century. In the black
ghetto of South Central, white motorists are
snatched out of their cars and beaten, stores
vandalized, police cars overturned and set
aflame. The Korean-owned licquor outlets,
swapmeets and markets that dot the area are
targeted for systematic destruction. So over¬
whelming is the eruption that neither firefighters
nor the police can prevent the torching of
thousands of buildings. Rioting promptly
mushrooms outwards as scenes of mass loot¬
ing multiply. A state of emergency is pro¬
claimed and 7,000 federal troops, including
1,200 Marines, are drafted in. Sniper fire and
shootings between rioters, police and store-
owners who take up arms to defend their
shops bring the death toll to forty-five. By the
end of the third day of upheaval, nearly 2,400
have suffered injury and 10,000 are under
arrest; a thousand families have lost their
homes and twenty thousand their jobs. Total
destruction is estimated at a staggering one bil¬
lion dollars.
These outbursts of collective violence are
but three drawn from a list of urban distur
bances too long to enumerate. For the past
decade has witnessed a spectacular increase in
public unrest and rioting at the heart of the
large cities of the First World. Most of the
disorders, big and small, that have shaken up
the French banlieues, the British inner cities
and the ghettos and barrios of America have
involved chiefly the youth of poor, segregated
and dilapidated urban neighbourhoods and
appear to have been fuelled by growing "racial"
tensions in and around these areas. Thus the
dominant interpretation in media accounts and
political debates has been that they are essen¬
tially "race riots" expressive of animosity
against, or between, the ethnic and/or immi¬
grant "minorities" of these countries.
There is much to support this view. The
Europe of the 1980s has indeed been swept by
a seemingly unstoppable wave of racist senti¬
ment. In France, long-covert "anti-Arab" hos¬
tility has burst out into the open and fuelled an
increase in racist assaults, and it has found its
political expression in the xenophobic popu¬
lism of the National Front. In the United
Kingdom, antagonism between black West
Indians, Asians and whites has flared up in
repeated street confrontations and grown
more acrimonious, so much so that public
unrest and violence are increasingly perceived
as essentially "black" problems. Meanwhile in
the United States a society-wide backlash
against the gains made by so-called minorities
(mainly African-Americans but also Latinos

sharp deterioration of race relations revealed

of the poor rising against economic depriva¬
tion and widening social inequalities with the
most effective, if not the only, weapon at their
disposal, namely direct forcible disruption of
civil life.
The 1980s may be the decade of the slow
maturing of mixed riots mixed in terms of
their causes or goals as well as by virtue of
their multi-ethnic composition. For, contrary
to media portrayals, neither the French ban¬
lieues nor the British inner cities are solely or
even predominantly populated by immigrants,
and those who partook in unrest there were
more often than not recruited across ethnic
lines. Moreover, their demands are the
demands of working-class youths everywhere:
jobs, decent schools, affordable or improved
housing, access to public services, and fair
treatment by police. Similarly, in South-Cen¬
tral Los Angeles, the thousands who pilfered
merchandise from burning supermarkets and
mini-malls during the riot were far from being
all blacks: over half of the first 5,000 arrests
were Latinos and another 10 per cent whites.
The uprising was not exclusively an Afro-
American outcry against gross racial discrimi¬
nation; it was also a revolt against poverty,
hunger, and the severe material aggravation
brought on by economic recession and cut¬
backs in government programmes. As one of
the city's most astute observers puts it, "the
nation's first multiracial riot was as much'
about empty bellies and broken hearts as it
was about police batons and Rodney King."
VIOLENCE FROM ABOVE
It is tempting to view outbreaks of collective
violence "from below" as symptoms of moral
crisis, pathologies of the lower class, or as signs
of the impending societal breakdown of "law

and order". But close comparative analysis of
their timing, makeup and unfolding shows
that, far from being irrational, recent public
unrest by the urban poor of Europe and Amer¬
ica is a (socio)logical response to the massive
structural violence unleashed upon them by a
set of mutually reinforcing economic and poli¬
tical changes. These changes have resulted in a
polarization of classes which, combined with
racial and ethnic segregation, is producing a
dualization of the metropolis that threatens not
simply to marginalize the poor but to
condemn them to outright social and eco¬
nomic redundancy.
This violence "from above" has three main
components: mass unemployment bringing in
its wake pervasive material deprivation, relega¬
tion to decaying neighbourhoods, and height¬
ened stigmatization in public discourse, all of
which are the more deadly for occurring
against the backdrop of a general upswing in
inequality. Unlike previous phases of eco¬
nomic growth, the uneven expansion of the
1980s, when it occurred at all, failed to "lift all
boats" and instead led to a deepening schism
between rich and poor, and between those
stably employed in the core, middle-class sec¬
tors of the economy and uneducated indivi-

duals trapped at the margins of an increasingly
insecure low-skill labour market.
For the residents of flagging working-class
areas, the reorganization of capitalist econo¬
mies visible in the shift from manufacturing to
education-intensive services, the impact of elec¬
tronic and automation technologies in factories
and offices, and the erosion of unions and the
reduction of government outlays in the areas of
welfare and low-income housing have translated
into unusually high rates of long-term jobless¬
ness and a regression of material conditions.
Simultaneously, advanced countries have had to
absorb a fresh influx (or the definitive settle¬
ment) of immigrants from the Third World who
are typically channelled into these very neigh¬
bourhoods where economic opportunities and
collective resources arc already diminishing.
Such spatial segregation intensifies hardship by
concentrating in degraded and isolated enclaves
downwardly-mobile families of the native work¬
ing class and immigrant populations of mixed
nationalities who are young, economically frag¬
ile and equally deprived of skills that are readily
marketable in the core of the new economy.
Such an accumulation of social ills explains
the oppressive atmosphere of drabness, ennui
and despair that pervades poor communities in

many large Western cities. Residents of these
cramped neighbourhoods feel that they and
their children have little future other than the
life of misery and exclusion to which they
seem consigned at present. Added to this is the
rage felt by poor urban youths as a result of
the cultural discrimination and stigmatization
imposed on residents of decaying urban areas.
Lastly there is the curse of being poor in the
midst of a rich society in which active participa¬
tion in the sphere of consumption has become a
sine qua non of social dignity a passport to
citizenship even among the most dispossessed.
As testified by the proliferation of "mugging"
in the British inner city, la dépouille (the strip¬
ping of fancy clothes under threat of force) in
the estates of the banlieue, and gold-chain
snatching and drug dealing on the streets of the
American ghetto, violence and crime are often
the only means that working-class youths with
no employment prospects have of acquiring the
money and the consumer goods indispensable
for acceding to a socially recognized existence.
THE DILEMMAS
OF POLICING
If direct forms of infra-political protest by way
of popular disruption of public order, direct
seizure of goods and destruction of property
have spread, it is also true that formal means of
pressure on the state have declined along with
the decomposition of traditional machineries
of political representation of the poor.
The widening gulf between rich and poor,
the growing self-closure of political elites, the
increasing distance between the lower class and
the dominant institutions of society all breed
distrust and disaffection. They converge to

undermine the legitimacy of the social order. In
the vacuum created by the lack of political link¬
ages and the absence of legitimate mediations
between poor urban populations and a society
from which they feel excluded, it is no wonder
that relations with the police have become both
salient and bellicose, and that incidents with the
"forces of order" are invariably the detonator
of explosions of popular violence in the cities.
Trends in all countries converge to show that,
whenever the police come to be considered as
an alien force by the community, they become
unable to fulfil any role other than a purely
repressive one and can only add to further
disorder and violence.
Political responses to urban violence and to
the civil disruption it causes vary significantly
from country to country depending on
national ideologies of citizenship, state struc¬
tures and capacities, and political conjuncture.
They span a continuum between outright crim¬
inalization and repression at one end, and
politicization of the problem via the collective
renegotiation of social rights at the other.
The recent upsurge in popular violence at
the heart of advanced urban societies has deep
roots in the epochal transformation of their
economy, cities, and state policies. The govern¬
ments of rich nations have, to varying degrees,
been unable or unwilling to stem the growth
of inequality and to prevent the social and spa¬
tial cumulation of economic hardship, margi-
nality and stigmatization in deteriorating work¬
ing-class enclaves of the changing populace.
The continued conjugation of ethnic iniquity
and class exclusion in the same fragile areas
promises to produce more unrest and to pose a
daunting challenge to the very idea of citizen¬
ship in Western cities for years to come.

### 93429: The Ruses of racism
Ihe ruses
of racism
by He/ Wieviorka
Racist violence has recently resurfaced.
What conditions encourage its growth?
RACISM is not always overtly, brutally vio¬
lent it does not always kill. Racial dis¬
crimination, expressions of prejudice and
racist tracts can all carry ominous overtones of
violence, but they cannot be ranked alongside
the physical violence perpetrated in pogroms,
lynchings, immigrant-bashing, murders and
other types of assault, which is what I wish to
discuss.
What is more, the most violent. forms of
racism do not necessarily grow out of other
varieties of racism. Contrary to popular belief,
prejudice does not invariably and inevitably
lead on to acts of violence. Deep-seated racism
may be widespread in societies where there is
no outward sign of naked violence.
For racist violence to erupt, a certain set of
conditions must exist. One conditioning factor
is the attitude of those in authority: what they
are willing and able to do in order to deal with
those who engage in racist acts. When a
government is weak or remote, or even tinged
with racism itself, it encourages political
groups and forces wishing to turn their mes¬
sage of hatred, contempt, subordination and
rejection into deeds. It may even become active¬
ly racist itself or manipulate racist violence,
as happened in the Russian Empire at the turn
of the century, where the Czarist regime was
largely instrumental in setting off the pogroms.
But there are other factors. Some institu¬
tions particularly the legal system and the
police may use methods which, although not
deliberately or explicitly racist in themselves,
nevertheless contribute to the spread of serious
outbreaks of violence. Many official enquiries
have found that when police behaviour has
exacerbated ethnic and social tensions instead

of defusing them, it has often led to an escala¬
tion of violence in which racism occupies a
prominent place.
Yet another factor is the existence of poli¬
tical forces capable of providing racist violence
with an organized structure and an ideological
foundation. As long as such forces do not exist
or are relegated to the sidelines of society, vio¬
lence is always possible and sometimes erupts,
but it crops up in the form of sudden out¬
bursts and short-lived explosions, in other
words of acts which, numerous though they
may be, are not linked by any apparent uni¬
fying principle.
When such forces do gain a political foot¬
hold, however, the violence for which they
provide a structure, even if it is not directly
organized by them, nonetheless becomes more 13

cold-blooded, methodical, and active. It
becomes a matter of schemes and strategies; it
channels popular feelings of hatred and hosti¬
lity towards the group marked out as a racial
target, but does not allow them to be
expressed spontaneously. It may even prevent
them from being expressed at all, on the poli¬
tical grounds that any act of violence should be
consistent with the aims and thinking of the
party or organization.
This is why the emergence of a political
force with a racist ideology and plans does not
necessarily mean that there will be an imme¬
diate increase in violence, for violence, may
actually be detrimental to its attempts to
achieve legitimate political status. Violence
may create an image of disorder and accord¬
ingly be played down until the movement
achieves power, when it will be able to indulge
in violence in its most extreme forms. Con¬
versely, there may be an increase in violence

political future. The end of apartheid in South
Africa is providing scope not for more racism
but for more racial violence.
Since the beginning of the modern era,
racism has been linked to patterns of domina¬
tion, especially those of colonialism set against
the background of empire-building. But it has
also informed trends in thinking which, from
the nineteenth century onwards, influenced
aspects of physical anthropology and other
doctrinaire intellectual movements. When the
14
term "racism" emerged in the period between
the two World Wars, some of the theories
from the past were refurbished. Above all,
racist attitudes spread all over the world in the
wake of the social upheavals that are at the
root of various forms of racial violence.
Racial violence is no longer only the crude
expression of colonial-type domination. It
may also stem from an economic crisis, in
which a deprived group, threatened with a
decline in social status or exclusion from the
mainstream, turns against another group in an
attempt to oust it, on racial grounds, from a
shrinking job market. The racism of the poor
whites, which led to the lynching of blacks in
the southern United States at the end of the
nineteenth century and to race riots in the big
cities of the northern United States in the first
half of the twentieth century, came about
when the whites saw their black neighbours as
dangerous competitors on the industrial job
market.
But racial violence may also occur among
more affluent classes, which want to maintain
the gap separating them from the less privi¬
leged. The method they use is a combination
of social and racial segregation, which may in
fact lead to more cold-blooded and calculated
forms of violence. At the beginning of the cen¬
tury, well-to-do white citizens in the southern
United States organized lynching parties to
punish black men accused of raping white
women or of theft.
However, racist violence does not always
stem solely or directly from social factors. It
may originate in a real or imagined threat to
the identity of a group, or it may accompany
the expansion of a state or religion, sometimes
claiming to represent universal values, as often
happened during the colonial period.
The urge to uphold a particular identity
can lead to unlimited violence, fuelled either
by an obsessive fear of "racial intermingling"
or by reference to an absolute difference that
prohibits all social intercourse and all contact
between races except in war. Such forms of
racism are intended to keep others at bay, to
ensure that they are segregated or even
expelled or destroyed. The aim is not so much
to establish the inferior status of a given group
on the grounds of its physical attributes as to
ensure that a community remains homogeneous
or a nation remains pure, or to justify their
unimpeded expansion.
Identity-related racism and the violence
that goes with it can have three quite distinct
motivations.
In some cases, this form of racism is
founded on the affirmation of an identity that
claims to be universal and seeks to crush every¬
thing that opposes it. The history of coloni¬
zation contains many instances of this pheno-

hated modernity. The explosive violence of the
pogroms and the more methodical violence of
the gas chambers largely grew out of criticisms,
-phantasms and rumours that reproached the
Jews on the grounds of their cosmopolitanism,
wealth, political power and influence in the
media.
Thirdly, this identity-related racism may
flare up as a result of a clash between two or
more communities within the same political
entity or a multiracial or multicultural society.
In such cases, violence results from strained
relations between communities, from a process
of interaction in which one group's real or ima¬
gined attempt to assert itself prompts reactions
from other groups and triggers off a spiralling
power struggle that may end in an outburst of
violence and political chaos. The civil war in
Lebanon and the breakup of Yugoslavia are
recent examples of conflicts where overt or
implied references to race can be sensed behind
rhetorical appeals to the nation or to the cul¬
tural, confessional and historical community.
When violence is associated with racism,
therefore, it is governed by various conditions
that dictate the course it takes and is rooted in
a wide range of social and identity-related fac¬
tors. But the important thing about violence is
that it compresses into a single action factors
that may be not only different but contradic¬
tory. Perpetrators of racist violence may wish,
for example, to exclude a specific group from
their society, and also assign it an inferior posi¬
tion in society so as to exploit it. This happens
frequently in industrialized countries, where
immigrants are employed to do low-grade jobs
and rejected on account of their culture. Or to
take another case, in Czarist Russia and central
Europe at the beginning of the present century,
it was the rich, assimilated Jew, symbol of
modernity, who was regarded as an intolerable
threat, yet the victims of the pogroms were the
culturally conspicuous and poverty-stricken
Jewish masses.
This is the paradox of violence: not only is it
unembarrassed by its inherent contradictions, it
also creates its own logic and its own dynamics,
so that in the end it alters the conditions that
allowed it to emerge in the first place. 15

THERE is a science-fiction story in which
an inventor succeeds in reviving sounds
that have long since died away. If we
could do that in real life, I fear that the sound
which would stand out above all others would
be the scream of human suffering, and that it
would reverberate endlessly throughout the
world. True, wild animals kill. But they do so
speedily and because they need to eat, and not
because they want to torture their victims.
Human beings behave differently.
The history of the world bristles with
examples of tyrannical and brutal acts com¬
mitted by the strong against the weak, by
crowds against isolated individuals, by the
armed against the defenceless. Even today, as
the second millennium draws to a close, and
even in the most prosperous and civilized coun¬
tries, there are still manifestations of violence of
all kinds, which are often unspeakably cruel
and are, unfortunately, increasingly common.
Now our "country" as we still call the
ex-Soviet Union out of habit could hardly be
described as a wealthy nation. And on the evi¬
dence of what is going on in the trouble spots
of our shattered empire, one may perhaps be
forgiven for wondering bitterly whether it can
still be described as a civilized country,
however considerable its past cultural achieve¬
ments, many fragments of which are still in
evidence today.

heritage as rich as ours relapse into barbarity
and become so chillingly indifferent to the suf¬
ferings of others? Unfortunately ours is not
the first case of this kind in history nor, I sus¬
pect, will it be the last. The development of a
great culture is always a slow and gradual pro¬
cess, whereas regression to brutality is swift. It
happens with all the suddenness of an ava¬
lanche, to use our current buzz word.
But the term avalanche may be misleading
if it is interpreted to mean what is more
usually called an "outbreak of violence", or if
it is seen as just the result of a regrettable act or
climate of opinion. In the mountains it is per¬
fectly possible to trigger off a devastating ava¬
lanche just by coughing; but that is no reason
to recommend cough mixture as the only way
to prevent avalanches.
Violence has broken out in our so-called
"zones of interethnic conflict". I say "so-
called" because there is a steadily increasing
body of evidence that ethnic differences alone,
like many other kinds of difference in areas
such as race, religion, class, gender, age and
taste, do not in themselves cause conflicts. Such
differences can trigger off disputes, hatred and
bloodshed only when they are combined with
certain individual or collective forces such as
greed, hunger for power, stupidity or unscru-
pulousness on the part of individuals or groups.
Economic difficulties, impoverishment and
other serious problems have all been cited to jus¬
tify the ferocity that is now raging. But why,
when whole villages of Ukrainian peasants were
starving to death in the early 1930s, did they not
hate the Russians, even though the famine in the
Queuing in a St. Petersburg

Ukraine was a direct result of Kremlin policy
(whose architect, it is true, was a Georgian)?
Besides, the first bloody interethnic clashes
that swept the country took place well before
the present "avalanche" of pauperization, at a
time when we were still living in the kind of
poverty we were used to. It is of course easy to
incite the poor to behave irresponsibly and feel
hatred for others. But it would be a mistake, I
believe, to regard poverty as the root cause of
such behaviour. Poverty simply helps to create
a situation that provocateurs can exploit.
THE STREET IN ARMS
It would be equally unfair to pin the blame
for interethnic clashes as violent as those we
have experienced solely on ambitious politi¬
cians, intriguing mafias or scheming clans. An
accumulation of snow, rocks and mud cannot
turn into an avalanche until it has attained a
critical mass and acquired all the physical cha¬
racteristics that will enable it to start moving.
A people is never putty in the hands of history.
Moscow News recently published a photo¬
graph taken in Dushanbe, in Tajikistan, which
showed a group of armed civilians frisking
their fellow citizens, who were docilely stand¬
ing there with their hands up (see photo page
18). The caption read: "While politicians carve
up power, a third force is taking shape: the
street in arms."
Violence is nothing new for humanity,
especially for our country. But to understand the
nature of the violence now sweeping through
the republics of the ex-Soviet Union a violence
which, alas, has probably not yet peaked, hence
its very real threat to world civilization we
must be clear in our minds about what we mean
by "the street in arms". What is at issue is the
use of weapons on a massive scale, participation
in politics by large sections of the population as
part of a spontaneous phenomenon which is
prompted by widespread discontent and is out
of government control. But that is not all.
It is also, and perhaps above all, a specific
qualitative state at once social, moral and psy¬
chological of our people, which has lost many
of its finest qualities and whose behaviour is
gradually deteriorating to the point at which it
displays the familiar characteristics of the mob.
The mob, as we all know, is never the sum total
of the moral, psychological and intellectual
qualities of the individuals who comprise it.
Almost all the regions of our country are
now suffering from the consequences of the
Bolsheviks' criminal "policy of nationalities".

groups and anti-Semitic campaigns disguised 17

as a struggle against "cosmopolitanism" were
part of the strategic logic of that policy. But,
contrary to that logic, the peoples of this
country lived on the whole in harmony with
one another until very recently at least
without any manifestation of hysterical hatred.
The most ruthless cases of repression of ethnic
groups were depersonalized administrative
acts. Several Caucasian peoples and the Cri¬
mean Tartars were deported beyond the Urals
with cold-blooded cruelty. The operative word
is cold-blooded. It goes without saying that no
one dared protest or come to the aid of those
peoples. If an order to shoot them on the spot
had been issued, they would have been shot.
On the whole, those who carried out cri¬
minal orders and those who were on the receiv¬
ing end did not hate each other personally. If
the orders had been countermanded, most of
those whose task it was to carry them out
would probably have been delighted. What
happens nowadays is very different: hordes of
normally peace-loving, hard-working peasants
storm into their neighbours' devastated vil¬
lages and their prisons not just to destroy and
loot, but to give free rein to their hatred by
brutalizing and humiliating.
During the darkest hours of the Stalinist
terror, the regime often used the people to per¬
petrate crimes. But then the people was an in¬
strument, not the author. Today the situation
has radically changed. While itself still the
target of violence, the people not the whole
people (though that is little consolation) is
increasingly instigating acts of violence as a
benevolent executioner.

### 93430: A Looming avalanche
This is what is meant by the expression
"the street in arms."
But how did this sorry state of affairs come
about? Must we accept that only a reign of
terror by dictatorial regimes can cause a people
to behave in a friendly and tolerant manner
towards other nations, religions and tradi¬
tions? After obtaining a degree of freedom, a
more liberal regime, and a chance at last to
for itself, is it really possible that this
people can regress to a state of savagery or at
the very least be willing to act as a docile in¬

I cannot oblige. Recent events in our society

to prove even more disastrous. It would be sad
indeed if we failed to draw the necessary
conclusions from them, however unpalatable
they may be.
Any normal person regards the notion of a
people as sacred. Its capacity for moral regen¬
eration is enormous, but not unlimited. It
would be naive to assume that the effects of
seventy years of systematic attempts to stifle
the nation's healthy moral and intellectual
forces have been negligible, or that they have
been corrected by a few years of waffle about
universal human values and the virtues of
democracy.
At a time when our country is poised to
enter the civilized world of modern demo¬
cracy, ninety per cent of its people are vegetat¬
ing below the poverty line (today it would be
more accurate to describe them as destitute). A
similar percentage of the population have lost
social status and lapsed into the state of a
lumpen proletariat. Not only workers and
peasants, but the intelligentsia, shopkeepers,
army officers and politicians have lost their
class awareness, social structures, spirit of soli¬
darity, self-respect, sense of honour and even
basic professional skills. As for the new class 19

of business people, it is unfortunately still only
embryonic. One of the effects of a growing
lumpen proletariat has been that the mecha¬
nisms of public opinion no longer function
normally, and that moral standards and sets of
values have been lost.
"The worst thing is that people get used to
killing each other," said Nursultan Nazarbayev,
President of Kazakhstan, in a recent interview.
Murder and even collective killings have
become commonplace. Between news about
spring sowing and a report on the latest
fashions, radio and television journalists trot out
the daily death toll without batting an eyelid.
"That's where your perestroika and your
democracy have got us!" the diehards chant
gleefully. But they forget, or pretend to forget,
that for over seventy years the notion of loving
one's neighbour was steadily erased from the
hearts and minds of our people. Everything in
the system worked to that end, from social and
state institutions to the army, the secret police,
party ideology, education, the propaganda
system and the arts.
In comparison with the noble ideals we
were told to aim for, human life was presented
as something insignificant, a mere trifle. The
murder of one's neighbour or the death of this
or that individual in the name of those "lofty
aims" used to be glorified as an act of heroism.
That official attitude prompted people, once
they had been "freed from prejudice", to take
an active part in a multifarious enterprise of
humiliation, violence and extermination. At
least fifty million people ended up in gulags.
One person out of three in the Soviet Union
was either a victim or an executioner. And only
recently more than a million youngsters learnt
the rudiments of their trade, so to speak, on
the bloodstained battlefields of Afghanistan.
But our collective experience of this phe¬
nomenon is even more comprehensive than I
have just suggested. Several generations of men
and women lived, from the cradle to the grave,
in a society where absolutely everything, from
the structure of power and the economy, cul¬
ture, ideology, religion and education, was
founded on coercion, violence, fear and the res¬
triction of freedom. Sadly, the self-destructive

Lying deep in the individual unconscious,
the seeds of conflict can be germinated
bypropaganda
WHY, in time of war, do a large number
of usually peace-loving and inoffen¬
sive people allow themselves to be
overcome by hatred and cause death and de¬
struction with terrifying determination and
anger?
Freudian pyschoanalytical theory locates
the source of this aggressiveness, which erupts
and becomes widespread above all during war¬
time, in the individual unconscious. The
unconscious may be compared to a kind of
Pandora's box where aggressive impulses which
originate at the time of a person's first contacts
with other people are repressed and confined.
Freud defined it as the place "where the germs
of all that is evil in the human soul are stored".
The regression to barbarity that manifests
itself in wartime is, then, made possible by the
presence of that barbarity in our unconscious.
Here Freudian thought tallies with Christian
demonology, whose basic postulate is neatly
encapsulated in this excellent phrase by the
Swiss writer Denis de Rougemont: "The enemy
is always within us."
Two main conclusions may be drawn from
this. First, people in wartime do not surrender
their individuality and become swamped by a
collective feeling of aggression whose psy¬
chical nature may differ from that of individual
psychology. It is true that the "normal" person
only takes part in the atrocities of war when
encouraged to do so by the massive participa¬
tion of other members of the community. But
such participation is in a personal capacity. The
person has an unconscious subjective motiva¬
tion for joining in. 21

### 93431: Undertones of war
If the origins of aggression are to be found
in the unconscious of each individual, it fol¬
lows that the disposition to make war is uni¬
versal. It does not spring from the innate cha¬
racter of any ethnic group or nation. As the
celebrated French psychoanalyst Marie Bona¬
parte remarked, "Any people, even one which
in time of security behaves in the most humane
manner, is capable of regressing to a state of
primal barbarity."
Thus people are sufficiently motivated to
make war by their unconscious aggression,
which seeks to discharge itself onto external
objects to avoid becoming a self-destructive
force. However, this aggression is not so much
the first cause of wars as their main weapon, or
rather the essential "natural resource" without
which a war economy cannot function.
Since this resource is of strategic impor¬
tance for the state, the latter has a fundamental
interest in controling and monopolizing it.
"Each citizen of a nation," wrote Freud in his
"Thoughts for the times on war and death"
(1915), "can in this war realize with horror . . .
that the state has forbidden the individual to
use injustice, not because it wishes to abolish
injustice, but because it wishes to have the
monopoly of it, like that of salt and tobacco."
Marie Bonaparte makes a comparison between
hatred and capital which follows the same
lines: "Hatred, in the heart of men, is a capital
that must be invested somewhere."
MYTHS
AND THE SUPEREGO
What procedures does the state use in wartime
to efficiently exploit its monopoly of its citizens'
aggression and to reap profit from its capital of
hatred? It should be said at once that these pro¬
cedures are full of contradiction and ambiguity.
It is not simply a question of lifting the ban on
pillage, torture and killing. Perhaps people have
always been, as Freud also pointed out,
"tempted to satisfy their need for aggression at
their neighbours' expense ... by martyrizing
and killing them. But opposition to this tempta¬
tion comes from the superego . . . which is the
psychical location of models and prohibitions."
The normal individual's superego must be
deceived before his or her repressed aggression
can be fully unleashed. It is not a matter of neut¬
ralizing or eliminating the pressure of moral
censorship, of anaesthetizing the superego, but
of increasing the pressure, of inflating the
superego. For a mobilized soldier, to kill in war
is not a licentious act, the satisfaction of a hidden
desire. It is a duty, a sacrifice, a heroic gesture.
By the same token, it is those who refuse to take
part in war who are regarded with the contempt
due to those who are criminally irresponsible
and think only of their own pleasure.
This apparent paradox stems from the pro¬
cess of identification, described by Freud as
"the assimilation of one ego to another, with
the result that the first ego behaves in some
respects like the second, imitates it and in a
sense accepts it within itself." The individual's
capacity to "receive within himself" someone
else is first exercised in the interiorization of the
paternal model, in other words in the form¬
ation of an ideal image through which the
person seeks self-affirmation.
This ambiguity also appears in the projec¬
tion of the child-father relationship onto the
social and political plane. In the child who

becomes an adult, writes Franco Fornari in his

Psychoanalysis of War, "the loyalty he feels
towards his leader, or the group personifying
his ideal, will be counterbalanced by the hatred
he feels for some other chief or some other
group. He is thereby disposed to make war. . . .
Another effect of the cleavage of the image of
the father into two figures is that the gods of
one people are the devils of another."
Individuals are motivated by their psycho¬
logical structure and the nature of their rela¬
tions with other members of society to trans¬
gress the prohibition to kill. If they are to
violate this law, as' they do in wartime, without
becoming criminals or madmen, recourse to
extreme violence must be presented in an
acceptable form.
There are two main ways of doing this.
First of all by endowing acts of war, and
notably the destruction of the enemy, with an
extraordinary, even sacred value. Victory in
arms becomes a matter of supreme impor¬
tance; on it depends the survival of the nation
and the physical existence of a people. Every¬
thing must be done to eliminate the danger of
defeat. Valiant soldiers must attack and kill the
foe as a sacred duty.
War always forced on us and thus defen¬
sive brings us into conflict with one or
several specific enemies. But it is also pre¬
sented as the continuation of earlier wars
which our ancestors waged against their ene¬
mies, and this gives a mythical dimension to
the current conflict. The ego participates in an 23

### 93431: Undertones of war
"us" which is present in the historical arena
but also belongs to a collective entity in Mo
tempore (at that time in the past). War provides
people with an opportunity to identify with
their ancestors, to experience great moments
when mythical heroes come to the fore.
In the same mythical perspective, the pres¬
tige of the leader (of the nation and/or the
army), which is psychologically speaking a
projection of love for the father, is increased
because he appears as the incarnation of the
founding hero of the community. "Charisma,"
notes the psychosociologist Serge Moscovici,
"has the characteristics of an evocation of the
past.
THE SNARES
OF PROPAGANDA
It is, then, not surprising to find this myth-
oriented line of thought in the tricks of war
propaganda. The "media war" currently being
waged on the territory of the former Yugo¬
slavia is an example of this. The aim of paint¬
ing the adversary as a "wild animal", a
"monster" or a "barbarian" is not merely to
humiliate him but to transform the destruction
of such an inhuman creature into an exploit
worthy of mythical heroes, of saviours of
humanity carrying out a duty imposed by the
highest moral authorities, that is in accord
with the superego.
This accord with the superego can also be
made in a totally different way by bana-
lization rather than dramatization, by using
war propaganda to make horror seem pleasant,
perhaps even amusing, but certainly unexcep¬
tionable. Euphemism is the instrument of this
type of propaganda, which has a number of
variants, as the Yugoslav conflict reveals. One
form glorifies outdoor life, physical effort,
comradeship, humour and singing around the
camp fire. Another takes up more or less the
same cheering refrain but concentrates on the
idea that war offers boys an opportunity to
prove their virility and achieve adult status.
And those who refuse the opportunity to
undergo the rite of passage into the ranks of
virile warriors are rebuked and ridiculed as
mother's pets.
Alternatively, war may be presented as a
highly rational and sophisticated operation, a
technological process controlled by profession¬
als, masters of the soldier's art. In this case,
the blood and terror of war simply do not
exist. There is no hatred, no killing, no suffer¬
ing. The adversary is "neutralized" but no
enthusiasm is shown. The ideal would be a war
without human losses, won or lost "on
points". There is nothing here to embarrass the
superego, and the individual can set out, reas¬
sured, for the battlefield, feeling that he has in
no way compromised his humanity. And so
the devil's work is done. B

The brazil-nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) needs a
regular support group to produce the delicious nuts
that are exported around the world. A species of bee
capable of covering 20 km in an hour is in charge of
pollination. If the trees are not themselves in flower,
the bees feed instead on a species of orchid that
grows on them. In charge of cracking the nuts, which
would otherwise be too hard to permit germination,
is a squirrel-like rodent called the agouti. If any link
in this chain were to go missing, the others would
also disappear and that would be bad news for
Brazil.

The World Congress for Education
and Communication on Environ¬
ment and Development (ECO-ED)
was held in Toronto, Canada, from
16 to 21 October 1992. Its purpose
was to share the messages of the
Earth Summit in Rio with a large
public of people working in educa¬
tion and communication. The
Congress, which was sponsored by
Unesco and the International
Chamber of Commerce in co-op¬
eration with the United Nations
Environment Programme, was
hosted by the North American
Association for Environmental
Education, the Council of Outdoor
Educators of Ontario, the Unesco
Canada Man and the Biosphere
Environmental Education Aware¬
ness and Training Network and the
Ontario Association for Geographic
and Environmental Education.
More than 3,000 people from 84
different countries attended its
sessions. Related events included a

senting an international showcase
of resource materials for environ¬
ment and development education.

technique de coopération agricole et rurale, an inter¬
national agency created by the Lomé Convention to
spread scientific information in the countries ofAfrica,
the Caribbean and the Pacific, and based in Ede-
Wageningen (The Netherlands), measures 81 cm by 66
cm the size of a coffee-table. Although the popula¬
tion of the Sahel countries is only 25 million just 6 per
cent of the total population of Africa their livestock
represents 14 per cent of the continent's total animal
count. The atlas depicts the background and environ¬
ment in which livestock rearing takes place, covering
soil analysis, water resources, and localized informa¬
tion on animal nutrition and veterinary services. This
magnificently illustrated work, which is divided by
country into six sections, each of which can be bought
separately, is only available in French.
Some developing countries are mindful of the environ¬
ment, and one that is doing something about it is India.
According to the magazine India Today, Bombay's mul¬
titudinous fleet of taxis will gradually convert to use
compressed natural gas. So far, 2,000 have been equipped
to do so, and halfof the remaining 28,500 will be fitted out
by June 1993. The move is expected to produce two
advantages: a reduction in air pollution and a 20-per-cent
saving on passenger fares, given that a kg of natural gas
costs only half as much as a litre of petrol.
Shortly after the Second World
Climate Conference, held in
Geneva in 1990, the World Meteo¬
rological Organization inter¬
viewed several world leaders and
published the interviews in a
book called Climate Change. In it,
Begum Khaleda Zia, the Prime
Minister of Bangladesh, pointed
out that on average the monsoon
floods 20 per cent of her country
every other year and 37 per cent
once every ten years. Records
were broken in 1987 and again in
1988, when floods respectively
covered 40 per cent and 60 per
cent of the country. With the
population doubling every 30
years and food needs constantly
growing, social and economic
development has top priority. In
this context, putting money aside
exclusively for environmental
protection is currently out of the
question.

Kalimantan is the Indonesian part
of the island of Borneo. The area
contains immense sources of
wealth, including petroleum, gas,
coal, gold, diamonds and hard¬
wood. Studies have turned up
3,000 different species of trees in
the eastern part of Kalimantan's
primary forest alone. About 30
million cubic metres of wood are
lumbered each year, representing
60 per cent of Indonesia's output
of marketable timber. The surface
area which is cleared or farmed
each year is of the order of
900,000 hectares, while only be¬
tween 90,000 and 250,000 hectares
are reforested. No one knows if a
forest can recover its original
balance under these circum¬
stances, but it is hard to pass
judgement on a country that has to
devote 40 per cent of its income to
servicing debt.
In the Lao People's Democratic
Republic, the energy situation has
undergone a spectacular change
over the past ten years. Electricity
has been taking over from the burn¬
ing of wood, and now accounts
for 50 per cent ofhousehold energy
consumption in Vientiane, almost
as much as in Bangkok or Manila.
Two out of three families cook with
electricity, and ownership of inex¬
pensive electrical appliances has
mushroomed. One problem is that
surging demand for electricity for
domestic use is sapping Lao PDR's
ability to trade electricity, the
country's leading export, for much-
needed foreign exchange. An energy
sector management assistance pro¬
gramme, partly sponsored by the
World Bank, in co-operation with
the national utility, Electricité du
Laos, seeking to encourage the
population to adopt more rational
consumption patterns while obtain¬
ing maximum energy efficiency
from the imported appliances.
A canal linking the Rhine, at Bam¬
berg, to the Danube, at Kelheim,
was inaugurated last September,
thereby opening an unbroken
waterway from Rotterdam in the
Netherlands to the Rumanian port
of Constanza on the Black Sea.
The entire route covers 3,500 kilo¬
metres and links 13 countries.
Supporters call it the engineering
achievement of the century, while
its detractors have described it as
the most ridiculous project since
the Tower of Babel. In particular,
the canal link was opposed by
German environmentalists seek¬
ing to protect the wildlife of the
Altmiihl Valley in southeastern
Germany, between Bamberg and
Kelheim. The canal provides a thor¬
oughfare for trains of large-capac¬
ity barges, a form of transport that
is three times less expensive than
rail and six times cheaper than
road haulage. Environmentalists
might also acknowledge that it is
safer than either alternative and
causes less pollution.
1 CLEANUP
Ships unload 58 million tonnes of
ballast water and sediments in
Australian ports each year. In the
past, much of it was drawn from
other harbours, but since February
1990 ships that have loaded ballast
water in any port have been
required, by order of the Minister
for Resources, to replace it with
water from the high seas. The
reason is that micro-organisms
from the open sea are not likely to
adapt to the sea-water found in
ports, which for the most part has a
much lower salt content. The pre¬
vious practice of transferring bal¬
last water from one port to another,
however, carried the risk of intro¬
ducing into local environments
foreign organisms such as fish, algae
or toxic micro-organisms that could
contaminate shellfish intended for
human consumption. Australia is
one of the first countries in the
world to adopt such measures to
protect its marine environment. 27

and business organizations in 123
countries. It also speaks for the
world of business at the United
Nations and in specialized govern¬
ment agencies. Its Business Charter
for Sustainable Development, launch¬
ed in April 1991, sets forth 16
principles for environmental man¬
agement. The object is for every busi¬
ness to put environmental protec¬
tion among its highest corporate
priorities by improving its environ¬
mental policies and performance,
training employees, advising cus¬
tomers, assessing the environ¬
mental impacts of its activities,
developing emergency plans,
contributing to the transfer ofenvi¬
ronmentally sound technology, and
fostering openness and dialogue
with its Board of Directors, its
employees and with the public.
At first glance, the Charter may
seem somewhat vague. Article 5, for
instance, reads: "Prior assessment:
To assess environmental impacts
before starting a new activity or pro¬
ject and before decommissioning
a facility or leaving a site." Jan-Olaf
Willums, Executive Director of the
ICC, explains: "Our purpose is not to
impose directives, but to set forth
principles that should raise busi¬
ness leaders' awareness and lead to
voluntary initiatives. We also wish to
show through specific examples
that it is possible to respect the
Charter without any loss, and even
profit from it. In addition, we want
to provide tools for the achievement
ofsustainable development, which
is indispensable."
Will the Charter contribute to the
transfer of technology that the devel¬
oping countries are hoping for?
"That is one of its goals," says
Willums. "We would like industrial
co-operation to increase, not only
from North to South and West to East
but also from East and South to
South and vice versa. We are not only
addressing industrialists, but govern¬
ments too. We are not asking them to
change their rules. We are merely
suggesting some improvements."
Any manufactured product is a
source of pollution. Even so, busi¬
ness initiatives to reduce it, however
small, can have tangible and bene¬
ficial effects. In From Ideas toAction,
published by the ICC in 1992,
Willums and Ulrich Golüke report
the example of the German firm
Mercedes Benz, a company which
supports the Charter. A car body
can be considered as a mass of raw
material that can be recycled at
some future date. The metal can be

used again. Plastic is specially
marked during production so that it
can be easily identified for recy¬
cling. In the past wire cable was dis¬
tributed through the car in seg¬
ments (there might be up to 50
pieces in a door), making it hard to
recover. Merce'des Benz has de¬
signed the electrical layout so that
the entire length of cable, which
may be as long as 3 km and weigh
up to 50 kg in some top-end models,
can be pulled out in one piece.
Robert Bosch, another German
manufacturer, has developed a
"super" electronic control chip which
transfers all the driver's instructions to
the vehicle through a single cable,
with a second cable sufficing for the
entire electrical system. This cable-
efficient design decreases the weight
of the vehicle considerably, thus
saving fuel and reducing pollution.
Eastman Kodak also supports the
Charter. Concerns about single-use
throwaway cameras led company
engineers to redesign them so as to
be recyclable. Kodak pays photo
developers for each used camera
returned for recycling. By December
1991 over three million cameras had
been returned for recycling in the
United States, Canada, Europe and
Japan, thus diverting 250,000 kg of
waste from disposal facilities. The
firm recycles or reuses all of the
parts, sometimes as many as six
times, to manufacture "new" dis¬
posable cameras.
DIAPER WARS
Despite these encouraging examples,
Carlo Pesso, a consultant with the
Organization for Economic Co-oper¬
ation and Development (OECD),
remains cautious. He notes that pol¬
lution is usually invisible to the
naked eye and that scientific ana¬
lysis is the sole key for ascertaining
the state of the environment.
Products must be scrutinized "from
the cradle to the grave", that is
throughout their entire life-cycle of
production, distribution, use and
disposal. A document published by

On this car,
parts that can be
recycled are
shown in green.
OECD in 1991 entitled Ecological
Labelling in OECD Countries notes
that "comparing and assessing dif¬
ferent types of environmental
degradation is extremely difficult
to do in a satisfactory manner. . . .
How to compare a product which is
durable but difficult to dispose of to
a product which has a shorter life
but which breaks down less harm¬
fully after disposal?"
In fact, this is precisely the kind of
comparison which is being made
by countries that have adopted
ecological labelling. In Canada, for
example, there has been a veritable
duel between disposable and
washable diapers. Each year, 1.7
billion disposable diapers end up in
landfills, representing a total mass
of about 250,000 tonnes of solid
waste. In Canada, the manufacture of
disposable diapers consumes
approximately 65,500 tonnes ofpulp,
8,800 tonnes of plastic and 9,800
tonnes of packing material a year.
On the other hand, less than 1 0 kg of
cotton is needed to produce all the
reusable diapers required by a baby,
but washing them requires large
quantities of water, detergent and
energy.
Canada's Environmental Choice
programme studied the problem in
depth. "Some people are concerned
that exclusive use of reusable cotton
diapers would increase cotton pro¬
duction and therefore the use of
pesticides," it reported. However, it
came to the conclusion that "even if
all disposable diapers were replaced
by 100% cotton diapers, the impact
on the cotton industry would be
minimal." (A pity for the countries
of the South that have problems sel¬
ling their cotton, one might add.)
The Canadian EcoLogo was finally
attributed to cloth diapers pro¬
vided they are able to endure a
minimum of 75 uses.
Jan-OlufWillums would like "eco-
products" everywhere to be subject
to the same standards. As Executive
Director of the World Industry
Council for Environment, an orga¬
nization founded at.the beginning
of 1993 which aims to become a
forum of co-operation for sustain¬
able development, he will surely
bear in mind this analysis from the
Brundtland Report: "We have
become accustomed to a sharp
increase in economic interdepen¬
dence among nations. We are now
forced to accustom ourselves to an
accelerating ecological interdepen¬
dence among nations. Ecology and
economy are becoming ever more
interwoven locally, regionally,
nationally, and globally into a
seamless net of causes and effects."

A Vietnamese tale of the Muong people
The story on this
page appears in an
anthology entitled
Compagnons du
Soleil C'Companions
of the Sun") co-
published (in French)
by Unesco, Editions
de la Découverte
(Paris) and the
Fondation pour le
progrès de l'Homme.
The anthology was
prepared under the
general editorship of
the African historian
Joseph Ki-Zerbo, in
collaboration with
Marie-Josephe Beaud.
They say that once upon a time, when Heaven and
Earth still touched, men and animals could come
and go as they wished on Earth as in Heaven.
Man was more intelligent than the other animals.
One moment he would clear the land, the next plant
one variety of tree, then another. And everywhere he
worked hard to have enough food to eat. Animals,
on the other hand, had no feeding places of their
own, and they devastated plantations and harvests.
Man made all sorts of traps, nooses, pitfalls, crossbows
and slings so that he could kill the animals that caused
such damage.
All the animals, both furred and feathered, hated
man, but did not know how to take revenge on him.
So after taking counsel together they decided to go and
see Heaven-King and try to bring man to book. . . .
Heaven-King listened to them, then summoned man
so he could pass judgement. Man came. Heaven-
King asked him:
"Why are you nasty to the animals?"
When he heard the question, man guessed that the
animals had gone to complain to Heaven-King. He
immediately answered:
"I beg Your Majesty to listen to me. It's the animals
that are nasty. When we cultivate our fields and gar¬
dens, hedgehogs and boars come and destroy them;
when we plant maize and beans, crows and turtle¬
doves come and dig up the seeds; when we raise pigs,
dogs, buffaloes and cattle, tigers and panthers catch
them and eat them. We men are always on the alert.
Even when we eat or walk, ants and bees come and
sting us."
Heaven-King was in a terrible quandary. He could
not decide which partywas right or what ruling to give.
So he decided to send man away. A little later, he
worked out a stratagem that would test the loyalty of
both man and the animals. He had a coffin made and
lay down inside it. But the coffin had a little hole in it,
so he could see what was going on outside without
anyone knowing. He sent a messenger to announce
. . . that Heaven-King was dead, and that all living
creatures ofall species, wherever they lived, near or far,
should come and mourn the passing of the Heaven-
King. . . .
When they heard the news that Heaven-King had
died, all the species, from dogs and foxes and birds to
tigers and panthers, came to mourn his passing	
Only the human species was incapable of moving
fast. By the time all the animals had arrived, man was '
still walking.
On the way, he met a yellow tortoise that was trying
in vain to clamber over a tree-trunk which had fallen
across its path	When it saw man coming, the tor¬
toise said:
"Help me get over this tree-trunk, and I'll tell you
something very interesting	"
Man helped the tortoise, which said:
"Once we arrive, we shall have to be on our best
behaviour. Heaven-King is pretending to be dead
but it's only a way of testing the world."
When he got to Heaven-King's abode, man saw that
all the animal species . . . were squabbling, while at the
same time gorging themselves very noisily. . . . The
man and the tortoise, who were in the know, were
the only ones not to scramble for food. Theywaited to
be served. As for Heaven-King's death, some wept
and others did not. Those belonging to the human
species unanimously agreed to sit by themselves and
mourn together. Some of them, who were embar¬
rassed about mourning without being able to produce
any tears, moistened their eyes with saliva. But as
they had been chewing betel, their saliva was red. So
their noses and faces became red too. After savouring
this spectacle, Heaven-King raised the lid ofhis coffin
and said:
"The moment I was dead, all the animals I now see
before me started foraging and eating to their heart's
content. If I had really been dead, just imagine the
pillaging theywould have done! Only the human spe¬
cies, when mourning, weeps tears of blood. What
cheek of the other species to come and complain
that humans are horrible!"
. . . Heaven-King then passed judgement: he ruled
in man's favour. The animals' retribution consisted of
man being entitled and empowered to eat all animal
species.
Heaven-King declared:
"Henceforth, man, with thy face to the ground thou
shalt eat everything, and with thy face turned
heavenwards, thou shalt eat everything."
On hearing that, the tortoise asked:
"What about me?"
"He will eat everything!" the Heaven-King declared.
The Muong, however, do not eat tortoise flesh. This
is because they are grateful for being told that Heaven-
King was pretending to be dead	 H

By removing
violence from its
context, the media
risk turning it into a
spectator sport
by Oaniel Herman!
Intervision (1955), oil on
canvas by Victor Brauner
and Roberto Matta.
WHENEVER the question of violence
comes up, the media tend to be
attacked on two grounds, one poli¬
tical, the other sociological. The political com¬
munity takes a very close interest in violence,
knowing as it does that violence and power are
directly linked. The stakes are so high that
politicians not only use direct coercion and
violence to govern, but have come to realize
that in a media-dominated society they also
need to look after their public image. Journal¬
ists are directly implicated in what might be
called the media strategy of political leaders
because it is through them that governments
get their message across.
The second reason for suspicion of the
media has more to do with society at large.
The media are made out to be the main vehicle
for the spread of violence and, because of their
amplifying effect, are thought to be respon¬
sible for an exaggerated perception of violence
on the part of the public. The growing feeling
of insecurity in cities may partly be the result
of violence itself, but it arises above all, or so
we are told, from the image of violence put
across by television. The image of violence that
is proposed perhaps "imposed" would be a
better word by the media influences behav¬
iour and encourages acts of violence, particu¬
larly by young people. According to this
thesis, the cult of force and the admiration of
brutality which are increasingly common
today have largely been spawned by the media.
The media, then, come in for wholesale cri¬
ticism from politicians, and are often used by
them as a scapegoat. For the sake of clarity, let
me start by making a distinction between two
situations relating to the representation of

Paris and of the journal
Cultures et Conflits. He has
published many articles on
political violence, conflict
situations and terrorism.
violence: the media's relationship with govern¬
ment, and the media's attitude to terrorism.
The first set of criticisms focuses on the
nature of the links between journalists and
government. Journalists operate within a media
strategy which, like any other strategy, can be
analysed in terms of effectiveness, resources and
goals. They are cogs in the machinery of govern¬
ment. Government can use their activities as an
extension of its own, and thus bolster its ability
to put pressure on the population. In authorita¬
rian countries, the role of the media is to put out
the officiai news that is the monopoly of the
authorities. In other countries, including the
democracies, they are often skilfully influenced,
not to say manipulated, by governments.
When the problem is examined in greater
detail, it becomes clear that news manipulation
is a well-established and versatile technique
which can range from mere omission to disin¬
formation and pure invention. Let us take an
extreme case, that of war. Over the last decade,
armed forces everywhere have developed com¬
munications strategies that have taken into
account the effect on public opinion, disastrous
from the point of view of the military, of the
American government's laissez-faire attitude
towards the media during the Viet Nam War.
Typical examples of such new strategies include
the strict control of journalists' reports filed
during the Falklands War, the absence of on-
the-spot reporters during the US expedition to
Grenada, and the mustering of a team of jour¬
nalists by the American military command
during Operation Desert Storm. In such situa¬
tions, cutting the media down to size has
become standard procedure.
The second criticism is connivance with ter¬
rorists, of which the media have often been
accused. Take the spectacular hijackings of air¬
craft that took place in the 1980s, especially that
of a TWA Boeing in 1985. Three American
television channels, ABC, CBS and NBC,
fought tooth and nail to get the most specta
cular pictures. They baulked at nothing, hand¬
ing out bribes and making deals with the mili¬
tias that called the tune in Beirut. The weekly
Newsweek even nicknamed ABC the "Amal
Broadcasting Corporation".
In France, when there was a controversy
over whether or not a girl pupil should be
allowed to wear an Islamic headscarf at school,
or when Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against
the writer Salman Rushdie triggered off
demonstrations, some journalists whipped up
public interest by broadcasting comments
from people who spoke only for themselves,
but whose impassioned declarations had an
effect on audience ratings because they
involved viewers emotionally. The fact is that
neither ideological sympathies nor constraints
enter into media connivance with terrorist
groups, which is guided purely and simply by
such considerations as ratings and sales.
Now let's look at an extreme case. When the
French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and a
crew from the television channel Antenne 2
were kidnapped in Beirut, they were trans¬
formed, whether they liked it or not, from hos¬
tages into de facto protagonists of terrorism.
For almost three years, Antenne 2 opened its
main 8 p.m. newscast by displaying a list of all
the Beirut hostages and the number of days
they had spent in captivity. L'Evénement du
Jeudi, the weekly Kauffmann worked for, orga¬
nized campaigns to mobilize public opinion,
and its editor-in-chief made several trips to
Beirut to negotiate Kauffmann's release. The
media, which normally act only as a mouth¬
piece, an instrument for the transmission of
messages, here grabbed all the parts: it played
both the victim, the political protagonist (since
it tried to solve the problem), and the observer
reporting on the distress of the victim and his
family as well as on various attempts to get him
released in other words it commented on its
own activities.
DANGEROUS LIAISONS
Where the relationship between government
and the media is concerned, the point at issue is
not the exaggeration of violence but distortion
or censorship. Governments have always tried
to control the news media. What is more, it is
not regarded as shocking when they succeed,
for a certain form of violence is vested in the
state. Many think it normal, especially at times
of crisis, for government to control communi¬
cations, and therefore journalists.
What is open to criticism is the wider
application of that policy to every kind of
situation and every type of news, an approach
typical of countries under a dictatorial regime.
Fortunately, there are structural limitations to
this approach. News, like power, can rarely be
monopolized in a democracy, and the relation¬
ship between the authorities and the media can
be likened to a propaganda war between poli¬
tical forces, with journalists often managing to
maintain their independence. In the case of
## [Page 33](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/093440engo.pdf#page=33) 0
### 93433: A Story too far?
authoritarian states, the plurality of news
sources is provided from outside.
The second problem the relationship be¬
tween terrorism and the media originates in a
more complex set of factors. Two kinds of inter¬
ests are involved, one political, the other com¬
mercial, which require the parties concerned to
co-operate rather than to seek to dominate. This
co-operation is based on the expectation of gain.
However, the interests of terrorists and the
interests of the media are not pursued at the
same pace or in the same way. So connivance
between them is possible only in the heat of the
moment. It is shortlived and hinges on the pos¬
sibility of getting a scoop. In 1979, in order to
secure a brief interview with one of the hostages
in the American embassy in Tehran, ABC tele¬
vision agreed to broadcast a twenty-five-minute
anti-American harangue. President Jimmy
Carter appeared on other channels, ostenta¬
tiously switching off ABC.
President Carter's symbolic gesture, which
highlighted the conflict between the two inter¬
ests, is a good illustration of the limitations of
the connivance that is possible between the
media and terrorism. The blatant opposition of
the political impact of ABC's scoop to the poli¬
tical position of the American government
robbed the device and those who used it of legi¬
timacy. ABC was vigorously attacked in the
American press for overstepping the mark.
Eventually, if tardily, the media rediscovered the
basic rules of journalistic practice.
In the final category under examination
that in which the journalist is a victim of vio¬
lence the distance between the message and
the messenger is blurred and even abolished.
Such a situation makes it difficult, if not
impossible, to distinguish between ends and
means, and thereby precludes any analysis in
terms of strategy or responsibility. This
explains why the notion of human rights has
come back into prominence in such cases.
In the difficult context of the relationship
between the media and violence, criticism of
journalists is justifiable in the first two cases.
Whether journalists are bought by govern¬
ment, or are happy to accept its prerogatives of
their own free will, or simply respond to their
concern as professionals to increase ratings and
earn money, they know what is at stake and
should assume their responsibilities. When
they oppose government, they can resist pres¬
sure by pleading the right to inform and the
freedom of the press. It would be dishonest of
them to put forward the same argument when
they yield to the siren voices of the scoop.
Some have tried to apply that interpreta¬
tion to the case of terrorism. They argue that
the enduring media interest in the hostage
issue is the equivalent of the scoops obtained
during the hijacking of aircraft. The media
have even been accused of keeping the news
value of the Beirut hostages at an artificially
high level which amounts to accusing them
once again of exaggerating violence. But mat¬
ters are not as simple as that. In this case it is
not possible to point to the interest factor
which had earlier played an important role:
surely viewers grew weary of the way atten¬
tion was focused on the hostages over such a
long period of time? In order to interpret this
type of relationship between violence and tele¬
vision a different approach is needed.
Up to this point, I have concentrated on the
people involved, and tried to gauge the effects
of their action on violence considered as a poli¬
tical or media resource. Now I should like to
broaden my analysis and take into account the
functioning of the media, which has its own
logic and creates effects that have nothing to do
with what journalists specifically intend.
The media constitute a self-contained world
whose function is to transmit pictures or news.
This world is not completely cut off from real¬
ity, since reality provides it with raw material.
But the key issue is the process whereby reality
is apprehended and then transferred to that self-
contained world. The only reality then becomes
that of the media, not that of the world, which is
simply chopped up and reused. A story achieves
its media existence and thus its "truth" when it
is picked up by several papers, radio stations
and television channels. The world of news-
gathering is largely self-referential. A story is
given wide coverage only if it has been assessed
according to the values of the system, and not
according to its source. Before being received,
news needs, so to speak, to be "formatted", to
use computer terminology. This approach is
encapsulated in the expression "making news".
INFORMATION OR SPECTACLE?
This process has several perverse effects. The
first of these is that violence loses its meaning.
In real life, violence is rational in the sense that
it serves a specific short-term purpose. In the
media in general, on the other hand, violence
has come increasingly to be treated as suffi¬
cient unto itself: the image is the thing that
matters and the accompanying commentary is

### 93433: A Story too far?
a pointless embellishment. Violence presented
to individual viewers in this way enables them
to identify with what they see, just as they do
with fiction. This transition to a different level,
one of sensibility and spectacle, goes hand in
hand with the kind of trivialization of violent
images that inevitably results from following the
news non-stop. We get more and more images
from television, and less and less explanation of
them. They no longer have any definite mean¬
ing. They float in a media continuum.
In this continuum and this is another per¬
verse result of the system violence is removed
from the context which produced it, which gives
it meaning and which forms part of a story, a
social situation. Violence here becomes part of a
game or show, and like a game or a spectacle,
fascinates but does not create anything. The
spectacle of violence is a dead end. However
often it is repeated, it remains meaningless.
When the former President, and former actor,
Ronald Reagan said, after viewing the film
Rambo, that now he knew what he had to do,
there began to be some confusion in people's
minds about the difference between fictional
and actual violence.
This confusion has now become widespread,
with the advent of improved technology which
makes live television a fact of everyday life.
Many, for example, will remember the captain of
the TWA Boeing mentioned earlier being threat¬
ened with a pistol, which was in fact just a piece
of theatre, or the celebrated hoax of the Timi-
soara mass grave. The Gulf War, or rather its fic¬
tionalized media version, which was regarded
by Western public opinion as a gigantic war
game in which the enemy was no longer even
present, was highly symptomatic of that rela¬
tionship between violence and television.
Criticisms of the media treatment of violence
are, then, based on a number of misunderstand¬
ings. To begin with, the relationship between the
media and violence does not obey a single
schema. It may be analysed either in terms of the
people involved or in terms of the way the
media system functions. In the first case, the role
of journalists in the distortion or censorship of
acts of violence should be examined on a case-
by-case basis. Journalists belong to a social
group whose interests, ulterior motives and
honesty may vary. A hasty assessment of their
role is bound to lead to oversimplification.
When the way in which the media function
is analysed, however, a distinction must be made
between the media's role as purveyor of spec¬
tacle and its role as a provider of information.
Spectacle does not exaggerate violence; it simply
garbles its meaning, disconnects it from its poli¬
tical or social context, and removes it from the
real world. Information, on the other hand,
strives to put violence back into the context that
engendered it, to look at it in perspective and to
explain it.
Spectacle encourages viewers to remain pas¬
sive, while information spurs them to adopt a
more critical, judgemental stance. The whole
point of discussing the relationship between
violence and television is less to meditate on the
contagious effect that television images of vio¬
lence may or may not have than to encourage
information as opposed to media hype.

Rock 'n' Revolt
Above, Rap fever. ROCK, a musical and social phenomenon of
unprecedented scope and intensity, raises
in acute form the question of the relation¬
ship between music and violence. Its history
has been fraught with violence. Jim Morrison,
leader of The Doors, apostle of sex, alcohol and
LSD, died young, of a heart attack in his
bathtub in Paris. Stars Jimi Hendrix and Janis
Joplin both died of drug overdoses. Acid rock
has become synonymous with punks and
English football riots. The fans of Metallica and
Guns and Roses have burned cars, and during a
recent concert in Montreal they wrecked a sta¬
dium and injured twelve people. The Sex Pis¬
tols proclaimed in their song "Anarchy in the
UK": "I wanna destroy passers-by, for I wanna
be anarchy". John Phillips, a member of The
Mamas and The Papas, was reported by musi¬
cologist David Tame as claiming that any rock
group can whip a crowd into a hysterical
frenzy by carefully controlling a sequence of
by isabelle leymarie
rhythms. In 1967 he went ahead and did just
that in Phoenix. When Hell's Angels roughed
up spectators during a Rolling Stones concert
in California, rocker Mick Jagger remarked
that "Something like this happens every time I
play that song".
Although physically less conspicuous, vio¬
lence is also expressed in the lyrics of urban
music such as rap (a recent hit by star rapper
Ice T is entitled "Cop Killer") and free jazz
("We are not angry young men, we are
enraged!" proclaimed saxophonist Archie
Shepp in the late 1960s). Here, violence is palp¬
able in lyrics, song titles, public statements by
musicians, and in the music itself: the mega-
volumes, "fuzz" effects and distortions of
rock, the hammer beats of rap, the shrieking
saxophones and cascading notes of jazz, and
the amplified bass of reggae. Violence is also
associated with other types of music. In

the hero, Alex, driven crazy by the sounds of
Beethoven, jumps out of a window. In Cuba
during the 1920s and 1930s, concerts by rival
bands playing the popular music known as son
degenerated into brawls which had to be
broken up by the police.
Violence, in more controlled forms, is pre¬
sent in many musical traditions, old and new:
in the wailing of women in the funeral lamen¬
tations of Macedonia; in certain Senegalese
songs whose lyrics pour out a stream of bitter
invective against new wives brought into a
household; in the drumbeats of African griot
storytellers which once stimulated the ardour
of warriors and today perform a similar role
for the participants in traditional wrestling
matches. It is found in martial music, in hunt¬
ing calls, and in filmed thrillers where it plays a
crucial role in setting the mood.
Violence is also present in classical music
such as Handel's "Saul", Beethoven's Eroica
Symphony, in operas generally, such as those of
Verdi, who once said that he sought to express
"passions above all else" and almost all of
whose heroines die tragic deaths, in Mahler's
Fourth Symphony, in Berlioz's Symphonie Fan¬
tastique, with its dramatic Dies irae, and in Stra¬
vinsky's The Rite of Spring, in which a virgin,
sacrificed to the gods, dances herself to death (a
riot broke out during the first performance).
One could continue the list indefinitely.
AN EXTRAORDINARY POWER
Is it possible, asks musicologist Gilbert Rouget
in his book on music and trance, that music
may be endowed with a magical power capable
of whipping people into the state of madness
which the ancient Greeks called "mania"? Or
does it have no objective reality? Rouget cites
Timotheus of Miletus, who lived in the fourth
century BC and once said that music "was
capable of tempting Alexander away from a
banquet to take up arms, and then of luring
him back again to his guests with a lilting har-
mony". Rouget also quotes Boethius, who
claimed that the Dorian mode inspired virtue,
whereas the Phrygian mode aroused passion
and violence, and refers to Aristotle's theory of
the ethos of modes, which was similar to that
of Boethius. He concludes that music can
induce a trance in some cases and calm in
others, and that it "derives its power from its
integration into a given set of representations".
It is true that in order to grasp the symbol¬
ism in a particular type of music it is essential
## [Page 37](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/093440engo.pdf#page=37) 0
### 93434: Rock'n' revolt
to be familiar with the set of representations
into which it is integrated and the context in
which it is performed. In the West, for
example, the major modes evoke elation and
rejoicing and the minor modes inspire melan¬
choly, while in the East other modes such as
Arab maqam and Indian ragas evoke totally
different emotional moods. Similarly, drums
and trumpets are regarded as martial instru¬
ments and flutes are associated with pastoral.
All this is bound up with mental associations
that are to a large extent culturally determined.
Leibniz spoke of the "anxiety-causing
effect" of dissonance, and yet today disso¬
nances, which have become commonplace in
contemporary music, have lost much of their
disquieting character (even Chopin's
mazurkas, when first performed, were criti¬
cized for their "dissonance"). Verdi's use of
double basses to introduce the final scene of
Othello, Berlioz's use of percussion instru¬
ments in the Symphonie Fantastique, and
Alfred Hitchcock's use of violins to heighten
dramatic tension, are all illustrations of the
way in which musical choices are both per¬
sonal and culturally determined.
And yet music, when considered as a group
of organized sounds and hence as a purely
acoustic phenomenon, is also known to pro¬
duce certain physiological and psychological
effects which have been scientifically docu¬
mented. Certain rhythms and sound frequen¬
cies, for example, can accelerate or slow down
the human metabolic rate and even induce
hypnosis. John Diamond, a specialist in behav¬
ioural physiology, has shown how the relative
strength of certain muscles, a function which is
easily measurable, varies according to the type
of music to which people are listening. Ani¬
mals and plants are also known to react physi¬
cally to music. According to studies carried
out in India, Russia and the United States,
plants seem to hate "heavy metal" rock music
and twist themselves as far away as possible
from the offending loudspeaker, while they
adore classical violin and will grow even more
lushly to the sounds of disco.
Noise engenders violence; it can even drive
people to suicide. Some artificial noises, espe¬
cially those which emanate from continuous-
frequency engines, have been found to have a
pathological effect on the body's cellular struc¬
ture, and can sometimes cause cancer, while
natural sounds, like those of waves, the war¬
bling of birds and certain types of classical or
African music, can create a sense of well-being
and even a healing effect by harmonizing with
our biorhythms.
In recent years, the practice of music ther¬
apy has enjoyed considerable popularity.
Members of the Research Group in Pediatric
Anaesthesiology at the Hospital for Sick Chil¬
dren in Paris and doctors in many American
hospitals have used carefully selected types of
music to reduce their patients' dependency on
tranquillizers. In The Burmese Harp (1956), a

kawa, a soldier-musician saps his comrades'
will to fight whenever he plays and sings.
Study of the relationship between music
and violence also raises the question of the
political aspect of music. In many parts of the
world, musicians such as the bards of Nepal,
the griots or the musicians of Ethiopia are per¬
ceived as pariahs or as socially inferior, and are
believed to lead dissolute lives and be addicted
to drugs and alcohol. Music has often been
used as an instrument of domination. In some
African societies, mirliton reed pipes and other
instruments provide a musical accompaniment
during the ritual parading of masks, which
women and children must not see and which
perpetuate male dominance.
The French writer Jacques Attali has
observed that in Western societies the upper
classes have always encouraged artistic cre¬
ation, but only in order to maintain the estab¬
lished order and legitimize their own authority.
In the 1950s, the Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo y Molina encouraged the practice of
the merengue, a dance closely related to the
samba, but gave orders that the musicians
should sing his praises and exiled those who

opposed him. In many countries, music has
become a form of propaganda or been appro¬
priated by the Church, and judgements about
music have been an endorsement of manipula¬
tion and intolerance.
Authoritarian colonial regimes arbitrarily
associated drums with violence and debauch¬
ery, and long banned black music. The "New
Age" writer Corinne Hélène claims that jazz
and juvenile delinquency go hand in hand. But
this baseless claim is fraught with prejudice,
for how can the beautiful and expressive phras¬
ing of a Sarah Vaughan or an Ella Fitzgerald
be associated with juvenile delinquency?
Why should jazz as a whole be connected with
this social problem when most young jazz
musicians are now graduates of music conser¬
vatories and universities and the overwhelming
majority of jazz fans are intellectuals? How
indeed, when music, for many deprived black
and Hispanic adolescents of America's urban
ghettos, far from leading to delinquency, is
often a lifeline?
In the United States, moral-majority pres¬
sure groups have stigmatized some rock
records as "obscene", in the hope of getting
them withdrawn from the market, but they
also tried to ban the Robert Mapplethorpe
photo exhibition and other artistic events
which did not correspond with their ideals.
On the other hand, some kinds of music such
as "muzak", which supposedly increase
consumer sales and induce people in restau¬
rants to eat more but are actually a form of
audio-brainwashing and noise pollution, are
broadcast all day long in shopping centres and
other public areas.
Jacques Attali has also remarked that
"show business, the star system and the hit
parade are signs of deep-rooted institutional
and cultural colonization". In this context
music, through a sometimes violent protest
against official art and the mechanization of
society, becomes a means of fighting authority.
"Music exists," adds Jacques Attali, "to help us
hear the sound of change. It forces us to invent
new categories, to come up with a new
momentum capable of rejuvenating a view of
society that has become ossified, trapped,
moribund." This is partly true of rock and its
rebellious anti-establishment stance, and of
jazz, rap and reggae all musical forms which
proclaim their black identity and have rejected
old models along with the hypocrisy and inhu¬
manity of materialism. In certain ritualized set¬
tings, notably during festivals, subversive
songs are often used to express grievances
against the establishment.
A YEARNING FOR HARMONY
Does music engender violence or does it
express violence? And if it does express vio¬
lence, does it, by sublimating violent impulses
and dissipating tensions, play a cathartic role
and "soothe the savage breast"? Music, for
Attali, is the "audible tape of society's vibra¬
tions and signs." It is undeniably deeply
rooted in the collective psychology: rock, rap,
free jazz and reggae all express the violence of
the cultures which have bred them. But people
and their environment are inseparable: the
pent-up violence in the individual affects
society and vice versa. While music reflects the
collective gestalt of a society, its particular
form of expression also reflects the emotions
of the musician.
In China, Egypt, India and ancient Greece,
music was believed to possess a certain ethical-
value and the power to uplift or debase the
soul. In ancient China, the imperial govern¬
ment existed in harmony with the twelve
celestial tones, and during the Confucian Chin
dynasty, certain "virtuous" songs and musical
instruments were reputed to temper the harsh¬
ness of the regime. Classical music is also
imbued with spirituality: Mozart's Don Gio¬
vanni brings down divine vengeance upon
himself by assassinating a nobleman and burns
in hell for it. Liszt aspired to compose

Guinea.
inspirational works, and although Wagner's
"Tetralogy" (the four-opera Ring cycle)
expresses both the fall of humanity cut adrift
from the gods and the distress of the artist
faced with the world's misfortunes, Wagner
had a deeply moral view of art.
The French sociologist Jean Duvignaud has
written that art expresses "nostalgia for a lost
form of communication in the shape of a for¬
bidden dream that is continually revived by
the irrepressible desire of the human emotional
impulse". He goes on to say that a successful
work of art "rebuilds behind the self a unity
which pieces together the shards of a divided
humanity". Now that idealism has been demo¬
lished and the philosophy of music has
become a thing of the past, while the media
(which tend to put the visual image before the
musical message) bombard us with vulgar and
iconoclastic music, it is more than ever incum¬
bent on musicians and artists in general to
adopt an ethical position. The most influential
creators of the twentieth century, notably the
film-makers whose art is one of our era's most
powerful forms of expression artists such as
Kurosawa, Ozu and Satyajit Ray have been
passionate humanists.
Musical eurhythmies presupposes both
inner and outer harmony, peace with oneself
and with the universe. Violence, in its latent
form, is an intrinsic part of human nature and
of the universe generally. But when violence is
unleashed and expressed, often in a paroxysm,
in music or other art forms, it is a symptom
either of social unrest or of inner imbalance or
torment, emotional deprivation and arrested
development.
And just as the wind can rise from a gentle
breeze to a raging hurricane, so music can
enchant or destroy us. It is for musicians to
create works which enrich life, which contrib¬
ute to the harmony of humanity, without com¬
promising the quality of their art (some forms
of therapeutic music, such as "New Age"
music, do not really have any aesthetic value).
However, when music achieves perfection,
it allows us to catch a glimpse of the divine; it
becomes, according to a Buddhist belief, the
most refined art, the path to enlightenment.
According to the Taoist sage, Zhuangzi,
"Music allows man to remain pure, simple,
sincere and in this way to rediscover his primi¬
tive emotions". (A few centuries later, Wagner
would also use music to explore primitive
forms of expression.) The great violinist
Yehudi Menuhin once observed that "music
creates order out of chaos". Nietzsche's humor¬
ous conclusion was that "Without music, life
would be a mistake".

### 93436: The Seville Statement
The Seville Statement
Peace is possible. War is not a biological
necessity but a social invention, and
peace must be invented to replace it. This
is the message ofthe Seville Statement,
which was drawn up in 1986 by an
international team ofspecialists
(biologists, psychologists, ethologists,
geneticists and others) on the initiative of
the Spanish National Commission for
Unesco as part of the International Year
ofPeace sponsored by the United
Nations. The Statement has been
endorsed by many organizations of
scientists around the world, and in 1989
was adopted by Unesco, which is
disseminating it worldwide in theform of
a brochure published in English, French,
Spanish and Arabic. The Statement
attracted considerable attention at the
second World Congress on Violence and
Human Coexistence which was held at
Montreal (Canada) in July 1992.
Salient passagesfrom the Statement are
published below.
INTRODUCTION
We, the undersigned scholars from around the
world and from relevant sciences, have met and
arrived at the following Statement on Violence.
In it, we challenge a number of alleged biolo¬
gical findings that have been used, even by some in
our disciplines, to justifyviolence and war. Because
the alleged findings have contributed to an atmos¬
phere ofpessimism in our time, we submit that the
open, considered rejection ofthese mis-statements
can contribute significantly to the International
Year ofPeace.
We state our position in the form of five pro¬
positions. We are aware that there are many other
issues about violence and war that could be fruit¬
fully addressed from the standpoint of our disci¬
plines, but we restrict ourselves here to what we
consider a most important first step.
FIRST PROPOSITION
It is scientifically incorrect to say that we have
inherited a tendency to make war from our animal
40 ancestors. Although fighting occurs widely
throughout animal species, only a few cases of
destructive intra-species fighting between orga¬
nized groups have ever been reported among natu¬
rally living species, and none of these involve the
use of tools designed to be weapons. Normal pre¬
datory feeding upon other species cannot be
equated with intra-species violence. Warfare is a
peculiarlyhuman phenomenon and does not occur
in other animals.
The fact that warfare has changed so radically
over time indicates that it is a product ofculture. Its
biological connection is primarily through lan¬
guage which makes possible the co-ordination of
groups, the transmission of technology, and the
use of tools. War is biologically possible, but it is not
inevitable, as evidenced by its variation in occur¬
rence and nature over time and space. There are
cultures which have not engaged in war for centu¬
ries, and there are cultures which have engaged
in war frequently at some times and not at others.
SECOND PROPOSITION
It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any
otherviolent behaviour is genetically programmed
into our human nature. While genes are involved
at all levels of nervous system function, they pro¬
vide a developmental potential that can be actua¬
lized only in conjunction with the ecological and
social environment. While individuals vary in their
predispositions to be affected by their experience,
it is the interaction between their genetic endow¬
ment and conditions of nurturance that deter¬
mines their personalities. Except for rare patholo¬
gies, the genes do not produce individuals
necessarily predisposed to violence. Neither do
they determine the opposite. While genes are co-
involved in establishing our behavioural capacities,
they do not by themselves specify the outcome.
THIRD PROPOSITION
It is scientifically inconect to say that in the course
ofhuman evolution there has been a selection for
aggressive behaviour more than for other kinds of
behaviour. In all well-studied species, status within
the group is achieved by the ability to co-operate
and to fulfil social functions relevant to the struc¬
ture of that group. "Dominance" involves social
bondings and affiliations; it is not simply a matter
of the possession and use of superior physical
power, although it does involve aggressive behav¬
iours. Where genetic selection for aggressive behav¬
iour has been artificially instituted in animals, it
has rapidly succeeded in producing hyper-aggres¬
sive individuals; this indicates that aggression was
not maximally selected under natural conditions.
When such experimentally-created hyper-aggres¬
sive animals are present in a social group, they
either disrupt its social structure or are driven out.
Violence is neither in our evolutionary legacy nor
in our genes.
FOURTH PROPOSITION
It is scientifically inconect to say that humans have
a "violent brain". While we do have the neural appa¬
ratus to act violently, it is not automatically activated
by internal or external stimuli. Like those of higher
primates and unlike those of other animals, our
higher neural processes filter such stimuli before
they can be acted upon. How we act is shaped by
how we have been conditioned and socialized.
There is nothing in our neurophysiology that com¬
pels us to react violently.
FIFTH PROPOSITION
It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused
by "instinct" or any single motivation. The emer¬
gence ofmodern warfare has been a journey from
the primacy of emotional and motivational fac¬
tors, sometimes called "instincts", to the primacy of
cognitive factors. Modern war involves institu¬
tional use ofpersonal characteristics such as obe¬
dience, suggestibility, and idealism, social skills
such as language, and rational considerations such
as cost-calculation, planning, and information
processing. The technology of modern war has
exaggerated traits associated with violence both in
the training ofcombatants and in the preparation
of support for war in the general population. As a
result of this exaggeration, such traits are often
mistaken to be the causes rather than the conse¬
quences of the process.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that biology does not condemn
humanity to war, and that humanity can be freed
from the bondage of biological pessimism and
empowered with confidence to undertake the
transformative tasks needed in this International
Year of Peace and in the years to come. Although
these tasks are mainly institutional and collective,
they also rest upon the consciousness of indivi¬
dual participants for whom pessimism and opti¬
mism are crucial factors. lust as "wars begin in the
minds of men", peace also begins in our minds.
The same species which invented war is capable of
inventing peace. The responsibility lies with each
of us.

'Politics is by
definition the
antidote to naked
violence'

I wo responses need to be kept under
control in the face of violence: fear and
moral revulsion. But this is extremely dif¬
ficult, because fear and moral revulsion are
healthy reactions to an outbreak of violence.
Healthy, but unfortunately unequal to the act
of violence itself; they are reactions to the
effects of the act, not actions affecting the
conditions that allow violence to occur.
Fear and moral revulsion are generated by
different feelings. Fear accompanies aware¬
ness of danger to the human body, to its phys¬
ical integrity. Moral revulsion arises from the
feeling that, since the notion of good is the
foundation of the social order, violence,
which is the embodiment of evil, must under¬
mine that foundation. In the first case, the
response is legitimate (this is the instinct of
self-preservation identified by Spinoza and
Freud) but irrational, for it cannot be propor¬
tionate to the extent of the act of violence. In
the second case, the reaction is not legitimate
(because it presupposes that the act of vio¬
lence is alien to the social order) but rational,
because it is based on an awareness that vio¬
lence destroys that order. But the two reac¬
tions lead to the same result: they answer vio-
jle Thviolence. Ihis is the opposite tothelence with
what is desired.
So another, more realistic attitude to the
problem of violence is required. Its starting
point is the familiar notion that human beings,
when left to themselves, will set in motion the
bellum omnium contra omnes, or "war of all
against all". The realistic approach, as opposed
to the moralistic one, takes for granted that
violence is central to human life, the social
order and human relationships. The problem is
how to control, eradicate or transcend it.
To transcend human violence is, in a sense,
to transcend humanity itself. But there is no
need to seek the principle of that transcendence.
It is not the kind of magic formula that pro¬
phets discover as a result of revelation (though
it has to be said that all religions are based on
this precept), nor is it a personal decision that
individuals are free to impose on themselves.
There is no need to look for a solution because,
paradoxically, it already exists. It resides in the
fact that any human being is also a social being,
or a "political animal", to use Aristotle's term.
In other words, the solution already resides in
the imperative necessity of the social order. The
social order requires individual human beings 41

to transcend themselves, because it has struc¬
tured them into a community, into an organized
society. The historical form taken by that orga¬
nization, at least in the tradition of volatile
societies in both East and West, has been the
state.
A STATE MONOPOLY
The state is the starting point of society. It
may well also be its end product but only
those who, like Hegel, claim to be the mouth¬
piece of absolute knowledge can be absolutely
certain of that. Experimental research has
shown beyond doubt that the violence of indi¬
viduals is incompatible with the state and that
the state cannot effectively perform its role as
guarantor of the social order unless it dispos¬
sesses individuals of their violence, or unless,
in Max Weber's phrase, it holds a legitimate
monopoly of violence.
The way in which this monopoly is created
is neither abstract nor straightforward. In each
case, specific historical conditions, power
struggles, conflicts and the clash of vested
interests combine to produce a certain type of
state or form of domination. Their degree of
legitimacy depends on the relationship that

unites them or sets them against human
society and the individual within that society. I
shall therefore not examine here the historical
question of the formation of the state. I shall
examine the problem of the transcendence of
human violence from a purely theoretical
standpoint, which of course has repercussions
on one's day-to-day outlook on violence.
Paradoxically, the transcendence of indivi¬
dual violence in the state comprises both the
abolition and the maintenance of violence.
Abolition, because through the exercise of the
general will violence becomes a norm, en¬
shrined in the legal system. No state, however
dictatorial it may be, can afford to ignore the
will of the community. History is of course lit¬
tered with examples of states whose sole legiti¬
macy has depended on their possession of arms,
but even in such cases there is constant refer¬
ence to the community and to its will. This is
what always gives legitimacy to the prohibition
of individual violence (which in turn becomes
necessary in the face of oppression). Rousseau
and Kant had opposing views on this matter.
Rousseau held that if the social contract is not
respected, and since it is based on the principle
of the general will, then the individual is

entitled to opt out of it and rebel, whereas Kant
urged the individual to submit to the moral law,
which he held to be superior to the general will.
And that moral law stipulated an absolute
rejection of violence.
Let us be quite clear about this: the usual
form taken by the transcendence of violence is
the transformation of violence, its inversion
into a legal norm. But violence is also, by the
same process, maintained, in the form of the
coercion exercised on those who oppose the
established community, whether they be
internal opponents who wish to use violence
to question the prevailing order, or external
opponents (other states), which strive by force
to impose their violence on the state.
And so there is an eminently complemen¬
tary relationship between the abolition and the
maintenance of violence; but violence has a
different form in each case. It would be a big
mistake ever to assume that violence has disap¬
peared, or should disappear, from the state,
and that the era of the "perfect citizen" has
dawned. In fact violence never disappears from
life. Its emergence is a sign, a symptom, a har¬
binger. But of what?
Of a deregulation of the social order. The
more an organized system is perverted by vio¬
lence, the more its capacity to integrate the
community is weakened. In this respect,
recourse to violence is an attack on the social
order rather than a justification of it. It always
reveals .the weak points in the system. This
point is valid both for individual and for group
violence. The French social scientist Emile
Durkheim showed how the normative order is
called into question by the act of suicide,
which is the most radical form violence can
take since it is directed against the self. Need¬
less to say, if violence heralds a weakening of
the social order, the latter cannot be rescued by
the power of the state alone. For as it weakens,
the state can and often does lose its legitimacy.
To that extent, an outbreak of violence is a
straw in the wind, an invitation to the social
order to turn inwards and take stock of itself,
to find out what has made violence possible.
POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
The state cannot put an end to violence either
by decree or by force of arms. The latter
course soon leads to bloodshed, and people
will imagine the blood to be that of their near¬
est and dearest. Such situations can be resolved
only through discussion, in the sense of com¬
munication between individual wills. This
form of communication is what politics is all
about. Politics is by definition the antidote to
naked violence. When Clausewitz said that
war is the continuation of politics by other
means, he did not imply that politics is the
continuation of war by other means. He was
simply saying that war is limited by politics,
and vice versa. In other words, that between
violence and discussion, and between force
and consensus, there is no continuity, but a
break. Politics is incompatible with force: it is
the realm of shared decision-making through
collective communication.
Here too, starry-eyed optimism should be
avoided, first because debate can be manipu¬
lated (how many demagogues has the world
seen since the time of Cleisthenes of Athens!),

### 93435: The Political solution
and secondly because in Western civilization,
which probably now gives priority to the
image over the printed word, people are tend¬
ing to become passive consumers of powerful
images to the detriment of their role as citizens.
The view that politics is the antidote to vio¬
lence has far-reaching implications. It implies
first of all that politics is the only way to
contain outbreaks of violence within the social
order. When violence begins to break free
from and destroy the social order, it becomes a
counter-society. On careful examination, this
can be seen to be the case of all movements of
those who are rejected or relegated to the side¬
lines of the social order. Fundamentalism in
Islamic society, for example, has all the charac¬
teristics of a politically antisystemic move-
' ment. However, the function of politics is to
integrate, not to exclude, to institutionalize
conflicts, not stifle them.
This brings me to the second consequence
of my argument: if politics is to be effective
and that should be its sole aim it must inter¬
face with actual reality, with the empirical
generality of divergences, contradictions,
interests and conflicts, as well as the infinite
range of passions that underlie them. In other
words, politics must be democratic.
But democracy in this context should not be
taken to mean simply the exercise of freedom.
For freedom is also more often than is usually
imagined a source of violence. It should be
regarded as that which encourages the equality
of all citizens equality here being taken to
mean, at least in democratic systems, satisfying
the minimum aspirations of each person.
Only democratic politics can get to the
roots of violence. It alone can decipher its
codes and reveal its underlying causes, because
it alone can extend the legal rights enjoyed by
men and women. And what is violence if not a
desperate appeal for such an extension?

Hadrian ]$

Above, a view of Hadrian's Wall (United
Kingdom), the barrier that defended the
northern frontier of Roman Britain. The
monument was placed on Unesco's World
Heritage List in 1987.
IT snakes for 117 kilometres across the
neck of England, from the River Tyne to
the Solway Firth, a fifty-six-kilometre-
long inlet of the Irish Sea that still marks the
border between England and Scotland.
Nowadays the frontier is an open one; only
roadside signs welcoming drivers to a new
country mark the passage from one land to the
other. But when Hadrian's Wall was built, in
the second century AD, the situation could
hardly have been more different.
Britain was then a congeries of mutually
hostile tribes, only partly subdued by the
legions of the Roman Empire. The wall was
constructed to draw a permanent line be¬
tween the conquered lands of the south, where
the pax Romana ran, and the turbulent lands
to the north that had not been drawn into the
Roman orbit.
The wall marked the northernmost frontier
of the Roman Empire, which stretched away to
the south and east as far as the Sahara Desert
and the sands of Arabia. The ribbon of stone

that still bisects this rolling, grey-and-green,
austerely beautiful northern landscape remains
the best-known and best-preserved of all the
empire's artificial frontiers. The strategic think¬
ing that lay behind it is succinctly summarized
in the only surviving Roman comment on its
construction, from an anonymous life of the
emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138): "It was he
who first built a wall, eighty miles long, to
divide the Romans from the barbarians".
Rome's interest in Britain had first been
aroused by Julius Caesar himself, who had
invaded the island in 55 BC, returning the fol¬
lowing year to accept the submission of the
local tribes. The invasion, involving a risky
sea-crossing, helped cement Caesar's reputa¬
tion as a military magician in Rome, where the
island had previously been regarded as semi-
legendary, an Ultima Thule about which
almost nothing was known. Although the vic¬
tory was not followed up and the legions left
after what amounted to little more than a
reconnaissance in force, the campaign won
Caesar a greater number of days of public
thanksgiving in the capital than had been
accorded him for the conquest of Gaul.
It was not until ninety-seven years later
that the Emperor Claudius, needing a military
triumph to shore up an insecure hold on
power, decided to complete what Caesar had
begun. Britain was invaded again in AD 43,
and this time the occupation was to be lasting.
Yet only the southern portion of Britain was
brought under Roman rule. Attempts were
subsequently made to subdue the entire island,
most notably by Cnaeus Julius Agricola,
father-in-law of the historian Tacitus, who
carried the Roman flag up to the highlands of
Scotland before being recalled to Rome in AD
84 or 85. At some point in the ensuing decades,
however, the legionary base he established in
Scotland was abandoned for reasons that his¬
tory does not record, and the Roman frontier
was pulled back to the Tyne-Solway line.
When Hadrian made the decision to build
the wall that bears his name, its exact siting was
largely determined by a chain of forts the so-

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
called Stanegate system that had already"
been established in the area by Agricola's men.
Its building marked an implicit limitation of
Rome's ambitions the entire island of Britain
would not be conquered. Once that decision
had been made, the lack of natural boundaries
in the rolling moorlands of northern England
made the erection of some permanent barrier
almost inevitable.
The wall was built by legionaries, which is
to say by a foreign army of occupation, for at
the time of its construction only Roman citi¬
zens could join the ranks. The legions were not
merely peerless military instruments, but also
employed surveyors, masons, carpenters, gla¬
ziers, engineersall the skills needed by colo¬
nizing forces.
In later centuries, however, the auxiliaries
employed to man the wall were very much
men of the region. The job often passed from
father to son, and whole communities abutting
the wall must have relied on sentry duty as
their main source of employment from gen¬
eration to generation.
In its final state, the Wall consisted of two
courses of dressed stone sandwiching a core of
rubble. The infill was usually bonded with
mortar, though clay was sometimes used when
locally available. The parapet's original gauge
of ten Roman feet almost three metres by
present-day measures was reduced in later
sections to two-and-a-half metres, which made
it just wide enough for two sentries to cross but
not large enough to serve as an effective fight¬
ing platform.
A DEFENSIVE SYSTEM
Although the building of the wall itself was an
extraordinary achievement, the defensive
system surrounding it required even greater
efforts. To the north the side from which
attacks were expected there was a ditch that
was on average about eight metres wide. The
earth removed in digging it was ramped ahead
of it to increase the drop for any would-be
attacker. On the wall's less-exposed southern
flank, a communications artery known locally
to this day as the Military Road was backed by
a rearward earthwork six metres wide and
three metres deepthe vallumthat clearly
delineated the military zone surrounding it.
More significantly still, the Wall system
incorporated a chain of sixteen garrison forts,
each capable of housing between 500 and 800
men. These were the guardians of the wall who
would respond to the sentry's alarum at the first
signs of trouble. In addition, fortlets known as
milecastles interrupted the fortifications at
intervals of one Roman mile roughly one-
and-a-half kilometres. Each contained twin
sets of guarded double doors the wall's access
points with barracks for guards in the walled
courtyard between them. And between mile
castles rose two observation towers, each about
six metres square, spaced with military preci¬
sion equidistantly from the towers and one
another. Each turret enclosed a single room, in
which a raised platform provided space for a
single sentry to set his bedding.
The planning of the wall reflected both
the strengths and weaknesses of off-site deci¬
sion-making. On the one hand, its construc¬
tion was a triumph of military efficiency; the
bulk of it went up extremely rapidly, pro¬
bably in less than a decade. On the other, the
rigorous logic of the layout allowed little room
for flexibility or adaptability to local condi¬
tions. To correspond rigorously to the mile
measure, some milecastles had gates that
opened onto steep drops, while others were
constructed on an inconvenient camber even
though flat land lay close by.
The frequency of these guarded gateways
meant that no traveller would have had to stray
more than half a mile off route to pass through
the wall, and this fact provides a clue to the
strategic thinking behind its construction. This
much-pierced line was no impregnable bul¬
wark, intended to repel attackers by its massive
strength. Rather, it was a physically defined
frontier line whose purpose was primarily
border control. Far from seeking to hide
behind its defences, the commanders who
built it would have viewed the number of
gates as an advantage, enabling them to deploy
their own troops rapidly at different points and
permitting unexpected sorties by units
manoeuvred into position under cover of the
curtain.
Ironically, the wall had barely been fin¬
ished when it was abandoned by its builders.
Within a decade of its completion, a new
Emperor, Antoninus Pius (AD 138-161),
decided once again to advance the Roman
front line into Scotland. A new turf-and-
timber construction went up 1 60 kilometres to
the north along the still narrower isthmus be¬
tween the estuaries of the rivers Forth and
Clyde. The forward frontier was held for little
more than two decades, however, and by the
160s Hadrian's Wall was back in commission
as the point at which the Empire stopped.
It was to remain so for the rest of the
Roman occupation of Britain. Though no
exact date can be fixed for its abandonment, it
seems not to have been long before 410, the
year in which the Emperor Honorius finally
told the people of Britain to look to their own
protection after the last of the legions had
been withdrawn.
In the three centuries during which it was
in use, the Wall proved less than infallible as a
defence against invaders. There were repeated
incursions by raiders from north of the border.
Yet for all that, the wall for the most part
served its builders' purpose well. The incur-

sions through it proved in each case to be
temporary, and the structure itself survived
with little more than local damage to show for
the fighting. As long as Rome had the resources
and the will to retain the colony of Britain, the
stone bulwark of the wall survived as its nor¬
thernmost shield. After the Roman withdrawal,
the wall faded from history.
The coming of the automobile age made
the wall easily accessible, and now its venerable
stones attract visitors from all over the world.
Tourism has caused some conservation wor¬
ries, but the main problems faced by the staff
of twenty-four permanently employed on its
upkeep are posed by an older enemy: the harsh
weather of the wild border region in which it
lies. With the wall's original coping long gone,
rain and rising damp saturate the stone, and the
frosts of winter cause uneven uplift that can
fracture the mortar sections that hold the core
together.
As so often in conservation matters, the
way ahead turns out to lie in looking back. The
cement infilling used since the 1 940s to consol¬
idate the core has proved brittle and friable,
and is now rarely employed. Instead, the wall's
conservers have taken their cue from the Roman

lime-kilns archaeologists have discovered along
the wall's length; natural lime flexes more than
concrete and so is better equipped to cope with
the asperities of the northern climate. With its
aid and a policy of careful supervision, there
now seems little reason why Hadrian's extra¬
ordinary defence should not endure for another
millennium.

### 93439: The Indus Valley civilization: cradle of democracy?
The Indus Valley
civilizationcradle of
democracy?
by Syed A. Naqvi
IN all the highly developed civilizations of
the past Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley,
Anatolia, China the pervasive influence
of an imperial authority can be felt, providing
patronage for the arts and directing the evo¬
lution of society. A close examination of the
archaeological discoveries made in the Indus
Valley seems to belie the presence of such an
imperial authority in this civilization, which
flourished some 5,000 years ago and covered
almost twice the area of the civilizations of
Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley combined.
Yet although it seems to have lacked an autho¬
ritarian regime, the Indus civilization had a
well-disciplined way of life, civic controls and
an organizational system which could only
have stemmed from the kind of "rule by the
people" that was exercised in some Greek
city-states some 2,000 years later. Did Greece
give birth to democracy, or did Greece simply
follow a practice developed earlier?
The fact that the Indus Valley script has not
yet been deciphered is certainly a handicap to
attempts to draw any final conclusions, but
there is a vast array of material evidence avail¬
able to help archaeologists, social scientists and
other scholars to analyse the social and admi¬
nistrative structure of this civilization. In spite
of the absence of grandiose structures acting as
centres of authority such as forts, palaces or
great temples, all the discoveries made so far
suggest that the rule of law extended over an
area measuring roughly 1,600 kilometres from
north to south and more than 800 kilometres
from east to west.
The main argument in support of this
thesis is the existence of well-established norms
and standards which would have required the
consensus of the people if they had not been
imposed by an authoritarian regime. It is
impossible to ignore the evidence furnished by
the perfect planning of the great city of
Moenjodaro and the use in its construction of
standard-size burnt bricks 27.94 cm long,
13.96 cm wide and 5.71 cm thick. Most of the
houses had a standard layout and size, and

only special structures, possibly public build¬
ings, were treated differently within the frame¬
work of a city plan which also provided for
separate residential and commercial areas. In
the two major cities of Moenjodaro and
Harappa, which are about 600 kilometres
apart, the gridiron pattern of street layout
uncovered by archaeological excavations shows
how much consideration was given to the
safety and security of the residents and suggests
the existence of a highly developed and well-
monitored civic control system. In their plan¬
ning, the city architects and engineers of that
time avoided the risks from heavy and fast
traffic on the main thoroughfares by giving
access to the houses from side lanes.
The grid layout and residential architecture
are not the only evidence of an organized
planning and control system. Never before
and not until Greek and Roman times was so

much attention paid to sanitation and civic
facilities as in the Indus Valley civilization.
Water discharge sluices from the houses
drained refuse into small cesspits lined with
bricks at the base of the walls, from which
the dirty water was led through conduits to the
main drains which ran along the streets below
pavement level and were covered with sturdy
bricks. This drainage system was connected to
larger sewerage outlets which were also
covered over and discharged waste and dirty
water outside the populated area.
Another striking aspect of the rule of law
imposed by the population has been revealed
by the discovery of a virtually complete series
of highly polished stone weights. Their shapes
are cubical, half cubical, cylindrical and spher¬
ical, and very few of them are reported to be
defective, They provide yet another proof of
a civic authority maintaining consistent com¬
mercial standards.
It will, of course, be difficult to prove
conclusively the existence of such a sophisti¬
cated concept of democracy until the Indus
Valley script is deciphered and provides written
evidence on the subject. But the signs are there,
and further research in this direction may well
establish that "rule by the people" originated
in the Indus Valley.

TRADITIONAL MUSIC
Unesco Collection
Syrian Orthodox Church. Anlioch Liturgy
Anthology of Traditional Musics
Unesco CDD 8039
These ancient liturgies of the
so-called "Western Syrians"
(Suryoye Ma'arboye), which are
sung in the Suroyo dialect, a
derivative of Aramaic, consist of
versified (syllabic) singing and
ornamented (melismatic)
singing, the latter ofwhich is
more influenced by Arab and
Iranian music. They include the
solemn tradition of Urfa, which is
of Turkish origin and has survived
in Aleppo, the more decorative
tradition of Tagrit (Iraq), the
tradition ofAmid, which has all
but died out today, and the
tradition of Mardin, near Aleppo.
It is encouraging to think that
despite all the trials and
tribulations of the Syrian
Orthodox Church this splendid
music has survived.
Australia. Aboriginal Music

Unesco CDD 8040
When listened to outside its
socio-cultural context which,
alas, is fast disappearing this
rhythmical music, which is often
monotonous or based on a form
of bourdon, and accompanied by
a didjeridu (big wooden trumpet),
lap-slapping and one or two
percussion instruments, is chiefly
of ethnological interest. Most
of the pieces are associated with
rites and specific symbols, and
they obey aesthetic criteria of
which we know nothing. They do,
however, serve as a reminder that
before the advent of modern
technology humanity respected
its myths and its dreams, was in
_ - harmony with the cosmic order,
ww and communicated with animals
and the natural world. Like
ancient rock paintings, this music
conjures up an almost nostalgic
image of lives which, although
primitive and difficult, are
probably more harmonious than
our own. For they are imbued
with the magic of the earth, where
the dividing line between reality
and the supernatural is blurred.

May May. The Introduction
CD Scot« Bros 51 2 51 5-2
May May, Muhammad Ali's
pretty daughter (who bears a
striking resemblance to the
former boxer), is a newcomer to
the musical scene. She sings an
invigorating form of rap that is
better to dance to than to listen
to. The numbers are more
interesting for their skilful cross-
rhythms and May May's drive
than for their lyrics. It is hard for a
woman to break into the macho
world of rap, but May May has
plenty of determination. She has
inherited her father's punch, so
be prepared for a first-round
knockout.

CDSeecoSCCD9104
This is a delightful collection
of Puerto Rican and Cuban hits of
the late 1950s. At a time when
Puerto Rico was awash with the
kind of insipid popular music
that appealed to the tastes of
American tourists, percussionist
Rafael Cortijo and singer Ismael
Rivera gave the island's folk
music, which is of African origin,
a new lease of life. They
enlivened salsa with the exotic
rhythms of bomba and plena and
with vigorous popular lyrics
("Chongolo", "El Pilón de
Tomasa"). Sonora Matancera was
the band which kept alive the
typically 1940s and 1950s Cuban
dance rhythm, son, in New York.
It accompanied a lot of singers
successfully, including, on this
disc, Celio González, Nelson
Pinedo and Johnny López, who
even tries his hand at a calypso,
"Linstead Market". Joe Valle, a
Puerto Rican like Cortijo and
Rivera, made plena popular in
New York dance halls. His lively
combo modelled itself on
contemporary Cuban bands.

Eddy Louiss, who is regarded
as one of the finest European jazz
organists, here offers us several
funk numbers, most of them
modelled on the African funk, or
"Afro-funk", popularized by Manu
Dibango ("Funk Set", "Sax Fun").
There is also a religious
composition ('Miserere") and
several more personal tracks with
a dreamlike atmosphere
("Souvenirs d'une Autre Vie",
"Djawa Dénam"). This is such an
original disc it is hard to know
which category of contemporary
jazz to assign it to.

CD Sony Classical SK 47 183
These are brilliant
performances of Rachmaninov's
Second and Third Piano
Concertos by the young Russian-
Israeli pianist Yefim Bronfman
and the Finnish conductor Esa-
Pekka Salonen. Rachmaninov,
who is so often accused of
excessive romanticism and
technical complexity, is here
ethereally graceful, poetic and
full of Slav charm. The allegro ma
non tanto and the more serious
intermezzo oí the Third Concerto
are particularly moving.
Bronfman has a remarkable sense
of contrast and phrasing, while
Salonen is careful to render every
nuance of the score.
Mozart. Piano Sonatas K.310, K.331
andK.533/494
Murray Perahia (piano)
CD Sony Classical SK 48 233
Murray Perahia combines verve
and clarity in these sparkling
versions of three Mozart piano
sonatas. The A minor, K.310, was
composed in Mannheim and
Paris; the A major, K.33 1 , was also
thought to have been written in
Paris, but this now looks less
certain; and Mozart composed
the F major, K.533/494, in Vienna.
Perahia is to be congratulated on
having had the courage to tackle
these frequently recorded sonatas
(particularly the A major, which
has been massacred by
generations of conservatory
students). Murray Perahia, who
was born in the Bronx but is
descended from an old family of
Sephardic Spanish Jews, is, with
Alicia de Larrocha, probably one
of the subtlest performers of
Mozart's piano music.
