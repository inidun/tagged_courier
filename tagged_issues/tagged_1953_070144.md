FROM THE UNESCO NEWS ROOM...
* France : After next July, residents
of France will be able to subscribe to
foreign newspapers and magazines
through their own local post offices,
and in their own currency. This
procedure was first conceived in 1947
by the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
It also permitted dispatch of the
publications at low postal rates. The
service was only, however, effectively
applied by Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
the Federal Republic of Germany,
Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, French
Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland.
When the Universal Postal Congress
met at Brussels last July, it adopted
a proposal, inspired by Unesco's aims
for the freer flow of information,
whereby the scheme was broadened
and simplified. Under these liberaliz-
ed arrangements, residents in a parti-
cipating country will, in general, be
able to subscribe to publications of
any other country taking part in the
exchange.
* India : Assam has introduced com-
pulsory social work in its secondary
schools. From now on, 250, 000 students
and 8, 000 teachers will visit villages
every Saturday to do social work.
The primary object of this programme
is to impress upon villagers the import-
ance of clean and healthy living.
Students, teachers and villagers will
tackle the cleaning of villages and
their surroundings by the digging of
ponds, making compost, and assisting
in the construction of houses.
*Norway : Bergen is to hold an inter-
national festival of music and dramatic
art from June 1 to 15 under the
patronage of King Haakon. It will be
dedicated to the memory of Edvard
Grieg, who was born in Bergen in 1843.
In addition to concerts, there will be
plays and folk music and dancing
recitals. The festival will coincide
with the conference of the Interna-
tional Confederation of Authors'and
Composers'Societies, which, under the
presidency of Arthur Honegger, in-
cludes writers and composers from
54 countries.
* United States : America has been
celebrating children's book week.
Parents, teachers and book-sellers all
over the country arranged festivals
and book fairs for the event. In
Washington educational and literary
groups, in co-operation with a local
newspaper, assembled an attractive
display of over 2, 000 books for children
of all ages. Their selections included
many American childhood classics, as
well as children's books of other lands.
* International : The United Nations
Technical Assistance Programme has
entered a new phase with the conclu-
sion of an unprecedented three-way
agreement between the United Nations
and the Governments of Norway and
India. Under this agreement the Nor-
wegian Government will provide
10, 000, 000 Kroner ($1, 400, 000) for
various technical assistance projects in
India, including the development of
industries, improvement of agriculture
and road construction. The Norwegian
people will be asked to contribute an
equal amount through a public cam-
paign. The Indian Government will
also provide funds for the carrying out
of agreed projects, and the United
Nations will contribute technical as-
sistance.
* Italy : To refer to Oslo, Italy, will
soon no longer be a sign of ignorance
or carelessness. A village now being
built near Rovigo, in the Italian pro-
vince of Venezia, is to bear that name-
because it is to consist of prefabricated
houses from Norway brought with
contributions which the Norwegian
Red Cross made after the disastrous
floods in the Po Valley.
* Norway : Oslo's new student town
can now accommodate 350 students.
When completed, it will house 1, 200.
The work is financed by contributions
and by municipalities throughout Nor-
way which, in this way, secure accom-
modation for students from their dis-
tricts who go to Oslo to study. An art
collector, Rolf Sternerson, has given
his collection of modern Norwegian
art, comprising over 600 works, to this
new student town.
* International : Catholic, Jewish and
Protestant leaders meeting in Stras-
bourg at the European Division of
World Brotherhood have urged sup-
port for the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the European
Convention on Human Rights. Tak-
ing part in the meeting were delegates
from Austria, Belgium, France, Ger-
many, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether-
lands, Switzerland, the United King-
dom and the United States.
* East Africa : A college for higher
education in arts and science, open to
students of all races and creeds, is
being built by the East African Indian
National Congress at Mwanza, capital
of the Lake Province of Tanganyika.
It will also be a memorial to Gandhi,
and leading figures in Kenya, Uganda,
Tanganyika and Zanzibar have helped
in its planning.
* United Nations : Women in 23 coun-
tries have been granted full or limited
political rights since the United Na-
tions Charter was signed in 1945. ac-
cording to the latest United Nations
annual report. There are now 57 na-
tions that grant women eqjal voting
rights with men.
* International : An international sur-
vey on foreign news reporting and pre-
sentation has been launched by the
International Press Institute, to dis-
cover what one country least knows
about another. The Institute hopes to
be able to recommend methods in
news presentation most likely to in-
crease understanding between nations.
* Turkey : Some 620 more primary
schools have recently been opened in
Turkey, raising school registration to
more than 1. 500. 000 students. This is
one of several educational and cultural
achievements reported by the Turkish
Government to the Unesco General
Conference, which ended last month.
The report also noted that f9, 000, 000
is being spent on building still more
rural schools, and that several adult
educational courses have been launched
in the villages. The Government has
organized special conferences, film
shows and radio broadcasts as part of
this rural educational programme.
50, 000, 000 ASIANS
LACK VOCATIONAL
TRAINING FACILITIES
No fewer than 50, 000, 000 young
people in Asia lack facilities'for voca-
tional training and employment, accord.
ing to an International Labour Orga-
nization report prepared for a confer-
ence on the needs of Asian youth,
held from December 1 to 10 in Kandy,
Ceylon. Delegates discussed such
questions as the role of Asia's youth
in industry and agriculture, vocational
training, child labour, and the connec-
tion between Fundamental Education
or compulsory schooling programmes
and training Asia's youth for employ-
ment.
* Far East : Fuller use of such substi-
tute housing materials as bamboo and
secondary wood species for Asia's
housing programmes were strongly
recommended at a housing conference
organized in New Delhi by the United
Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East. Several other
methods were recommended for reduc-
ing building costs and finding solu-
tions for Asia's severe housing pro-
blems. Attending the conference were
representatives from the United Na-
tions and such Specialized Agencies
as Unesco, FAO and WHO.
* Unesco : Burma became the first
country to be assisted by UNUM Gift
Coupons-a new Unesco form of in-
ternational currency-when a stock
of these coupons was purchased by the
Dutch World University Service and
donated to the war-damaged Univer-
sity of Rangoon. Earlier types of
Unesco Gift Coupons already have
benefitted educational institutions in
some 29 countries. Japan has now
joined the Unesco Coupon scheme,
both as a buyer and as a supplier of
educational and scientific materials,
and $100, 000 worth of coupons have
been earmarked by Unesco for cir-
culation in that country.
* United Nations : The United Nations
postal administration has made its
second commemorative issue-a blue
and green postage stamp which will
mark the General Assembly's adoption
in 1948 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. Demand for the
stamp has proved very heavy, and
several hundred thousand first day
covers were sold.
* Philippines : Following recommen-
dations from a United Nations Tech-
nical Assistance Mission, the Philip-
pines Government is now planning to
develop a large scale pulp and paper
industry. It is estimated that, in
15 years, the Philippines will be able
to export 400, 000 tons of wood pulp a
year. This new industry will help
improve Filipino living standards, as
well as easing paper shortages in
South-East Asia.
* Unesco : A detailed survey of women's
participation in the political life of
four European countries is to be made
by the International Association of
Political Science. The survey will be
sponsored by Unesco as part of its
campaign to further the realization of
the principales of the Universal De-
claration of Human Rights. Plans for
the study were completed recently by
a committee of social scientists meeting
at Unesco House in Paris.
* Czechoslovakia : A school for train-
ing puppeteers has been opened at
the Prague Academy for Musical and
Dramatic Art. Offering a four-year
course in this neglected art, the school
is said to be the first of its kind in the
world.
* International : The United Nations
Children's Emergency Fund has
approved a $7, 000, 000 programme for
maternal and child-care projects in
31 countries. A large share of the
money will be spent to help children
in Asia. Funds have also been provid-
ed for assistance programmes in the
Middle East, Latin American and
Europe.
* France : Paris shop windows last
month featured artistic displays on
international cultural themes in
honour of Unesco's General Conference
in the French capital. Another Paris
event honouring the Conference was
an international exhibition of children's
books at the Bibliotheque Nationale.
Organized by the French National
Commission for Unesco, it displayed
the best books for young children now
being published in 35 countries. A
special section groilped works that
foster better international understand-
ing.
* International : Eight European coun-
tries, as well as India, Canada and the
United States, took part in the second
international art film festival in New
York. The purpose of the festival was
to increase production and distribution
of films on art throughout the world.
* Netherlands : Noordeinde, the former
Royal Palace at The Hague, has opened
its doors to students from all over the
world. Now turned into the Institute
of Social Studies, it concentrates
mainly on research and training in
public administration. Among the
diversified student body are people
from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Cey-
lon, Iraq, Israel and Lebanon. Courses
are given in a number of languages.
* International : An international
conference on the problems of educa-
tion in relation to the mental health
of Earope's children was held last
month in Paris. Organized by Unesco
in collaboration with the World Health
Organization and the United Nations
Division of Social Affairs, it set out
to discover how nd where Europe's
educational systems present special
points of strain to children, and where,
on the other hand, they offer real
opportunities for improving mental
health.
* Latin America : The Ministry oÏ
Education of Peru has appointed a
commission to organize the first Latin-
American Theatre Conference, which
is to take place this year in Lima.
Main aims will be the establishment
of a Latin-American Theatre Institute,
organization of theatre festivals, au-
dience and player training and
education, censorship and children's
theatres.
* France : To obtain practical experi-
ence, building trade students in the
French town of Felletin have built
their own school. Under the supervi-
sion of instructors, they erected the
framework and built interior walls,
staircases and workshops, as well as
doing the necessary paintwork. Their
studies at the new school, through
which they will perfect the practical
experience they have already gained,
will range from stone cutting to lock
making.
* Unesco : Professor Claude Levi-
Strauss, the French social scientist and
anthropologist, has been appointed
Secretary to the Provisional Interna-
tional Council of Social Sciences. The
Council was set up recently under
Unesco auspices to encourage the pro-
gress of the social sciences, and their
application to the main problems of
contemporary life.
* U. S. A. : A large-scale laboratory
devoted to solar research is to be
constructed this year in Yellow
Springs, Ohio. The laboratory will
investigate photosynthesis, the process
by which the sun's energy is utilized
by plants, and will study its possi-
bilities to help humanity. Solar
research work is also going on in India,
the Soviet Union, Great Britain and
many other countries. Investigations
are concentrating both on photo-
synthesis and the conversion of the
sun's energy into industrial and do-
mestic heating.
* International : Almost a thousand
observers and delegates from North
America, Europe and Asia attended an
international conference of Social
Work in Madras, India last month.
Their main theme was the role of
social service in raising living standards
in underdeveloped areas.
* Mexico : Seventy-eight centres to
combat illiteracy have been created in
the Otomi Indian villages of the Mez-
quital Valley. Three thousand men
and women are attending the courses
and learning to improve their work-
ing and living conditions.

### 70142: Jaime Torres Bodet leaves UNESCO after four years of creative leadership
JANUARY 1953. Page 3
After four years of creative leadership
JAIME TORRES BODET LEAVES UNESCO
n w R. JAIME TORRES BODET, Director-Gene-ral of Unesco since 1948, has resigned his
post. He announced his. decision to leave on
November 22, 1952, during the seventh session of
the General Conference of Unesco which was
meeting in Paris. His resignation went into effect
on December 1, and Dr. John W. Taylor, Deputy-
Director, was appointed Acting Director-General
until the naming of a new Unesco head, probably
in April or May.
Mr. Torres Bodet's resignation, which followed
the General Conference discussion on the pro-
visional budget ceiling for 1953-54, was accepted
by the delegates of Unesco's Member States with
expressions of profound regret. Unanimously, the
Conference adopted a resolution paying tribute to
the departing Director-General"for four years of
creative leadership of Unesco".
Mr. Torres Bodet, the resolution declared,"has
rendered in every way the most admirable services,
to develop with his tireless devotion and energy
and with all his great talent, education, science
and culture among all the Member States of
Unesco.
"Thanks to his great leadership, our Orga-
nization has developed in a few years as. a bastion
of peace and a modern symbol of international
co-operation, and of the advance of all races
towards a future of agreement and happiness."
"It was with profound regret that the Con-
ference learned of the irrevocable decision of the
Director-General, Mr. Jaime Torres Bodet, to
submit his resignation ; and the Conference
wishes to pay a deep and genuine tribute to him
for four years of creative leadership of Unesco."
During his"four years of creative leadership"
Mr. Torres Bodet saw Unesco grow from an orga-
nization of 46 Member States in 1948 to 68 in 1952.
He saw its action and influence extend across
frontiers to increasing numbers of men and
women in the various fields of human thought :
in the arts, in education, in the sciences.
He saw the Unesco ideals and the Unesco
principles assume deeper significance for the
ordinary man in the street and among young
people in different parts of the world.
Under his leadership, he saw Unesco embark
on one of its boldest and most far-reaching
enterprises : a programme to help half the
population of the globe who are the victims of
ignorance and illiteracy to achieve a higher
standard of living by providing them with at least
a minimum of general, technical and civic
education now known as fundamental education.
The opening, at Patzcuaro (Mexico) in 1951, of
the first of a world-wide network of Fundamental
Education laboratories and training centres,
marked one of the significant milestones in this
programme.
During the past four years, Mr. Torres Bodet
saw Unesco assume leadership in a world
campaign for free and compulsory primary
education ; in a scientific campaign against racial
prejudice ; in a campaign which helped in
alleviating the world's newsprint crisis ; in a
campaign for greater educational opportunities
for workers through increased fellowships and
study tours and the formation of an International
Centre of Workers'Education in France.
He saw Unesco assume leadership in the difficult
task of unifying the conflicting Braille systems of
writing for the 7, 000, 000 blind people of the world,
which ultimately led to the creation last year of
the first World Braille Council.
As Director-General, he guided the day-to-day
efforts which culminated in the drafting of the
first Universal Copyright Convention, now signed
by 35 countries ; in the establishment of the first
European Council for a nuclear research centre to
serve the cause of peace ; and in the drafting of
an agreement abolishing many impart duties an
educational, scientific and cultural materials.
This agreement, which eliminates some of the
serious obstacles to the movement of ideas
between countries, has now entered into force in
13 countries.
Today, the effect of Unesco's practical efforts is
felt in almost every Member State of the Orga-
nization, whether it be in the training of
industrial workers in Guatemala or the im-
pravement of harbour installations in India ; the
modernizing of a school system in Thailand or the
training of badly-needed science teachers in
Liberia ; the showing of a travelling exhibition of
art reproductions in Peru or an exhibition an the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in
France ; the development of library services in
Turkey or aid in desert research work in Israel
and Pakistan ; the purchase of $75, 000 worth of
Unesco Gift Coupons by 500, 000 school children
and other groups in seven countries, or the issuing
of $2, 500, 000 worth of Unesco Book Coupons in 30
countries.
*
These are but a very few of the achievements of
Unesco during the four years of Mr. Torres Bodet's
leadership. They were made possible by the
devotion, the deep inspiration and great
dynamism of Unesco's Director-General, by the
faith and sincerity of Unesco's Member States, and
the combined efforts of hundreds of thousands of
men and women throughout the world who
believe that the progress of mankind and the
cause of peace and understanding between peoples
can effectively be fostered through education,
science and culture.
Thus, this moment in the history of Unesco
when Mr. Torres Bodet resigned is marked by
sadness and regret, but also by hope and regard
toward the future. This is the deep significance
of the homage paid to the departing Director-
General by the delegates at the General Con-
ference last November, when they spoke in the
. name of the different cultural, linguistic and
geographical regions of the world which make up
Unesco.
"Unesco is the conscience of the people",
M. Paul Montel of France said, quoting the words
of the French Minister of Education."For four
years, Mr. Torres Bodet has embodied the
conscience of Unesco."
In  the final words of the resolution unani-
mously adopted by the delegates representing the
Member States of Unesco, the General Conference
wished to express its deep conviction"that the
devoted and indispensable services which Mr. Tor-
res Bodet has rendered to peace, security and
social progress will be an inspiration to all those
in the Organization and within Member States
who will endeavour to continue the splendid work
on behalf of international understanding and
solidarity which he has so ably and self-
sacrificingly carried out."
It is this same regard for the future and the
continued success of Unesco that Mr. Torres Bodet
himself expressed in his final words to the
General Conference :
"May Unesco one day develop its programme as
we who had the privilege of being present at its
birth in London, in 1945, dreamed that it might.
And notwithstanding all obstacles, may peace
assure for the world, through education, science
and culture, a destiny worthy of mankind."
Before his election as Director-General,
Mr. Torres Bodet was well known in his native
country of Mexico, in Latin America generally,
and in many other countries, as a man of broad
and comprehensive culture. Before he was 23,
he had published five volumes of verse and had
won himself a secure place as a poet of
importance.
While still in his twenties, he occupied the Chair
of French Literature at the University of Mexico.
During this period, his literary work had become
still more widely known and when, in 1929, he
entered the Foreign Service of his country as
Secretary to the Mexican Legation in Madrid, he
was already regarded as one of the foremost
literary figures of the New World. His literary
and diplomatic careers advanced harmoniously,
winning for him the respect of critics and of
diplomats in many countries.
A new phase began with his appointment as
Minister of Education in 1943. While serving in
this capacity, he began a campaign for mass
literacy which led to the establishment of more
than 60, 000 collective teaching centres in
Mexico, staffed largely by volunteers-pro-
fessional teachers, industrialists, farmers, land-
owners and even new literates.
By this means and by ambitious programmes
for school building and teacher training, he helped
launch his country on a crusade for basic
education, under the slogan"Each one teach
one."In the course of two years, more than
1, 200, 000 Mexicans were taught to read and write.
While still Minister of Education, Mr. Torres
Bodet led his country's delegation to a meeting
of the Unesco Preparatory Commission in London,
in November 1945, and was one of the signatories
of the Constitution of Unesco.
On his appointment the following year as
Foreign Minister of Mexico, he won distinctions
from his country and from various international
organizations. Finally, in 1948, he was chosen as
Director-General of Unesco, to succeed Dr. Julian
Huxley, Unesco's first Director-General.

### 70143: Letter to a schoolboy on UNESCO's General Conference
Page 4. JANUARY 1953
LETTER TO A SCHOOLBOY
on Unesco's General Conference
YOUR school club, you say, wantsyou to give a short talk on
"Unesco and its recent General
Conference"and you ask me to tell
you what you could say about this
Conference which ended a few weeks
ago.
Frankly, your question calls for
more than a brief answer and my
reply to you may be rather long. I
think there are a few basic facts you
might want to note down from the
start.
I ought to begin by explaining
that the General Conference is the
chief governing body of Unesco and
in the past has met once a year
either in Paris or some other capital
city. It is the General Conference
which decides on all matters con-
cerning the policy of Unesco, its
programme and its budget. Each
of the countries belonging to Unesco
can send official delegates to the
Conference, and each nation has
one vote.
As you know, the recent General
Conference was held in Paris and
lasted from November 12 to De-
cember 11. When it opened there
were 65 Member States in Unesco ;
of these, 60 sent a total of 400 offi-
cial delegates. In addition, various
other international organizations, as
well as important private and semi-
private groups, sent 80 observers
who could follow all meetings, but
not, of course, vote.
The delegates came to Paris from
all parts of the world to decide on
many questions concerning Unesco,
but principally they met to examine
its programme of work and to de-
termine exactly what activities
Unesco should undertake in the next
two years, and how much money was
required to pay for these activities.
The Conference elected as its
President, Professor Sarvepalli Rad-
hakrishnan, one of the leading
thinkers of modern Asia, who is to-
day Vice-President of the Republic
of India. But a few days later, he
received a message recalling him to
India for urgent matters of State.
The Conference then elected the
head of the Pakistan delegation, Mr.
S. M. Sharif, as Acting President.
After these introductory remarks,
I want to tell you something about
the new Unesco budget since you
specifically asked me to do so. The
money to pay for Unesco's activities
comes from its Member States, each
of which contributes a part of the
total, the percentage varying accord-
ing to countries. In addition, cer-
tain sums are also obtained from
outside sources, but since they do not
affect any member's percentage con-
tribution they are called"non-bud-
getary income."
For the two years 1953 and 1954,
the General Conference voted a
Unesco budget of 18 million dollars,
adding $ 712, 964 from non-budgetary
income. But there is a catch to the
figure of 18 million dollars. It is
the real budget of Unesco in name
only. For when they voted this
sum the delegates realized that
Unesco's working budget for the
next tVTo years would be really
$ 17, 056, 964. Let me explain why this
is so.
As you know, there are always
people who fall behind in paying the
money they owe. The same is true
of countries and governments. From
past experience, the General Con-
ference had worked out that 9. 2 per
cent of a given budget was not re-
ceived from Member States. It
therefore decided that in order to
avoid a financial crisis toward the
end of every year, only the amount
that could be counted on would be
spent by Unesco. This explains
why only 17 million dollars can be
spent instead of 18.
You say you have read in the
newspapers about the resignation
of Mr. Torres Bodet as Director-
General. You know then that his
departure followed the discussion by
the Conference of the budget for the
next two years, and that pending the
appointment of his successor next
April or May, the Deputy Director-
General, Dr. John W. Taylor of the
United States, was named Acting
Director-General. You also know
that the Conference accepted Mr.
Torres Bodet's resignation with the
sincerest regret and that all the
delegates praised his leadership of
Unesco during the past four years.
You may have seen that three
new members were admitted to
Unesco by the Conference-Spain,
Nepal and Libya-and that after
Poland decided to withdraw from
Unesco, the Conference asked the
Polish Government to reconsider its
decision and join once again in
Unesco's work.
You have probably also read that
the permanent headquarters of
Unesco are to be built not far from
the Eiffel Tower of Paris, and that
from now on, Unesco's General
Conferences will be held every two
years instead of every year, the next
one in 1954 to take place in Monte-
video, Uuruguay.
The information I have given you
so far will, I hope, help you in pre-
member governments to improve
their schooi systems through special
missions of educators, technical
experts and advisors, as well as by
conducting international seminars
so that teachers from different
countries can exchange their infor-
mation and techniques.
Half of the people of the earth live
in ignorance, poverty and disease.
Unesco will continue to help many
of its member countries to give
their people the"fundamental
ducation"that will enable them to
achieve a decent standard of living.
A Fundamental Education Centre
to train teachers is soon to be
opened near Cairo, Egypt, similar to
the one now operating at Patzcuaro,
Mexico. Graduates return to their
home countries to instruct more
Fundamental Education teachers,
so that the thousands of men
and women who are needed to carry
on the fight against poverty and
illiteracy can be provided.
JOHN W. TAYLOR APPOINTED
ACTING HEAD OF UNESCO
FOLLOWING the resignation of Mr.Jaime Torres Bodet, the General Con-
ference of Unesco appointed Dr.
John W. Taylor as Acting Director-Gene-
ral of Unesco. Dr. Taylor, who has served
Unesco for the last two years as Deputy
Director-General, will head Unesco until
a new Director-General is appointed by an
Extraordinary Session of the Conference,
probably next April or May.
A distinguished American educator
with international experience, he was born
in Covington, Kentucky, 46 years ago,
and studied at the universities of Paris,
London, Berlin and Vienna, as well as at
Columbia University, New York, where he
gained his degrees of bachelor of arts,
master of arts and doctor of philosophy.
His widespread career as a teacher has
included holding various posts at Teachers
College and New College, Columbia Uni-
versity ; Louisiana State College and the
Kaiser Friedrich Realgymnasium, Berlin-
Neukolln. He has also been director of
foreign study at Columbia University.
After the Second World War, Dr. Taylor
served as chief of the education and relig-
ious branch of the United States Milit-
ary Government for Germany. In Africa,
he was director of studies of the Military
Government School. In England, he was
in charge of the United States group
preparing plans for German education, in
association with the Council of Allied
Ministers of Education-the group whose
efforts resulted in the establishment of
Unesco.,
In 1947, Dr. Taylor became president
of the University of Louisville, Kentucky,
and remained there until he was appoint-
ed Deputy Director-General of Unesco
from January 1, 1951. Under his admin-
istration, the university was the first in
the American southern states to suppress
the racial barriers to the admission of
students. Negroes were allowed into the
graduate and professional schools of the
university, and plans were made for the
acceptance of undergraduate students.
Dr. Taylor is a member of the Ame-
ricon Council on Education, the National
Education Commission, the American Educa-
tional Research Association, the Com-
mittee on Internotional Understanding of
the Southern University Conference, the
Louisville Committee on Foreign Relations
and the Council on Christians and Jews.
He is holder of the United States
Legion of Merit and the French Legion of
Honour.
Following Dr. Torres Bodet's resignation,
the General Conference of Unesco in-
structed the Executive Board of the Or-
ganization to invite Member States to
suggest the names of people who might
be considered as his successor. In addition,
it instructed the board to convene an
extraordinary session of the General Con-
ference for the election of a new Director-
General.
paring part of your talk, but you
will still have to speak about the
essential point of the General Con-
ference.
*
What is this essential point ?
Simply this : the programme of
Unesco-the programme as it was
shaped with infinite precision and
exactitude by all the delegates dur-
ing weeks of careful study, in com-
mittee and small group meetings. If
you would study this programme it
would enable you to measure the
work of the Conference, and perhaps
more important, the future work of
Unesco in 1953 and 1954. For the
talk you are preparing for your club,
you cannot, of course, and I don't
think you will want to, go into any
great detail about Unesco's future
activities. Here though, are a few
things I believe you may be inter-
ested to report.
Education will continue to play a.
major role in the work of Unesco.
Unesco will continue to help its
Such expressions as"free and
compulsory education""equality of
education for women"and"adult
education"may make you and the
members of your club think of dry,
unending scholarly reports. In real-
ity they mean more schools for
young Arab refugee children in the
desert sands of Palestine, a mission
to help Korea rebuild its destroyed
school system, and the efforts of
ordinary men and women to give the
people of Latin America, Africa, the
Middle East, and South-East Asia
their right to education.
The members of your club, like
most people today, are probably in-
terested in science. In your talk
you might want to tell them of some
of the great scientific questions of
our modern world with which Unes-
co will be dealing in the coming
years. There is the work on the
Nuclear Research Centre in Europe,
which will try to harness atomic
energy for peaceful purposes so that
it can enrich our daily lives ; there
is the effort which will be made to
find ways of pushing back the front-
iers of the deserts and making the
semi-desert lands fertile ; and then
there is the less spectacular but
nonetheless important example of
the continuing work of the Unesco
Science Co-operation Offices which
form a network across all the conti-
nents to help scientists, industries
and universities.
One of the great problems of our
troubled times is to forge an instru-
ment capable of bringing nations
together, of fostering true collabora-
tion amongst them, and an aware-
ness of their interdependence.
This, Unesco has made it its duty to
work for in the past and will con-
tinue to do in the years ahead.
During 1953-54, Unesco will promote
a special programme of interna-
tional discussions dealing with the
cultural relations between peoples,
bringing together leading thinkers
and creative artists. It will pursue
its campaign against racial prejudice
and for the application of human
rights in the different regions of the
world, and will continue the social
studies it has undertaken on the
causes of national and international
tensions and on the prevention of
conflicts. It will continue to work
for the increase of international
fellowships and travel possibilities
abroad.
In this respect, I believe you will
be particularly interested to hear
that Unesco will soon launch a new
"Travel Coupon Scheme"to make it
easier for students, teachers and
research workers to study or carry
on their work abraad.
. *
This letter has grown rather long,
but I hope I have been able to give
you at least a few indications con-
cerning Unesco and its recent Gene-
ral Conference which may help you
in preparing your talk.
I think, too, that you will be able.
to form your own opinion about the
'''crisis''which you read of in con-
nection with the Conference.
It is true that the discussions
during this Conference revealed a
great variety of opinions on a num-
ber of serious problems ; and there
were moments when it seemed dif-
ficult to reconcile the various view-
points touching the very principles
of the Organization. But as the
days went by the delegations suc-
ceeded in achieving a unity of pur-
pose and in harmonizing their di-
vergencies.
In his closing speech to the Confer-
ence, the Acting President, Mr.
Sharif spoke of"the great crisis that
was overcome, thanks to the faith
in Unesco of the representatives of
the Member States and thanks also
to their determination that Unesco
should pass bravely the temporary
hesitations and falterings that are
inevitable in the life of any vital,
growing and developing Organiza-
tion."
He went on :"I am happy that the
Conference has adopted the reso-
lution presented by the Indian Dele-
gation and supported by the Delega-
tions of the United States and
Pakistan. This resolution stresses
the immensity and urgency of the
task lying ahead and calls upon
Member States to increase their
efforts for the development of
Unesco's work. I sincerely hope
that the Member States will recog-
nize the vital importance of Unesco
and give it their support in an
increasingly greater measure.
"let us hope that the crisis we
underwent has strengthened our
inner convictions, for Unesco's vital-
ity will depend on the force of that
conviction even more than on any
outward action we may take."
I think you would find it fruitful
to ponder this address for it might
well suggest to you"what you could
say about the General Conference".
For does it not show that what
counts above all is the programme
of Unesco, the work that still re-
mains to be done by all of us, includ-
ing the members of your club and
you yourself ?

JANUARY 1953. Page 5
Pakistan subscribes to the Declaration of Human Rights with its insistence on the equality of women, but it has, through religious habit, although not by Koranic
precept, the problem of"purdah". There are lady members of parliament, but barely one per cent of the women of Pakistan are literate, and women have in the past
been kept out of the country's economic and social life. Here, Tabinda and other Pakistan nursing trainees find new opportunities for emancipation through service.

Symbol of the emancipation
of the women of Pakistan
by R) tch ! e CALDER
T ABINDA Is nineteen-and very lovely. Babanda claims to be a hundredyears old and is as ugly as a witch. Like characters in a fable, these
two are wrestling together for the lives of the mothers and infants of
the Punjab.
.. Behind Tabinda are the forces of new enlightenment and modern
science ; behind Babanda is dark superstition and the black arts of spells
and potions. One is the trained maternity nurse ; the other is a dai, or
traditional midwife.
Babanda lives in the dim, cave-like recesses of a back-street hovel in
Lahore ; it just needs the flapping of bats'wings to complete the picture.
There she crouches, a toothless crone, her white hair yellowed by smoke
and filth, hanging in wisps about her eyes. On a leaf on the dirty clay
floor she is mixing a strange concoction for childbed fever. If the baby
lives she will claim her reward, so much for a girl, so much more for a boy.
If the mother and infant die, it will be"Allah's will", not Babanda's fault.
She sneers at modern hygiene and cackles her lies-like the one of how the
arm of the infant presented itself first ; how she touched the hand with a
live coal, so that the baby instantly withdrew it and, five minutes later,
arrived normally.
She croaks her ill-will towards girls like Tabinda, shameless hussies
going around with naked faces.
For Tabinda is more than a nurse. She is the new Continued on
emancipated woman of Pakistan. When she arrived next page

a burqua or hood which covered her head and
face. Through its lace visor she glimpsed the
world.
Her father has three wives, of whom her'mother was the first, and three families. He is a
Moslem traditionalist but her mother is not.
When he took a girl as his third wife, she moved
Tabinda and her elder sister away, to give her
daughters the advantages which purdah had
denied her. One has graduated as a doctor ;
Tabinda is qualifying as a nurse, to go out into
the villages.
When Tabinda raised her burqua for the last
time and unveiled her beauty, she joined a
sisterhood of pioneers. Only five years ago the
first Moslem nurse was recruited to a hospital in
Lahore. Before, in pre-partition days, nurses
were mainly white girls or Christian Indians.
Since maternity nursing is"pollution"and
midwives less than the Sweeper Caste, Hindus
were infrequent in that branch of nursing.
Segregation and purdah which strictly applied
means that no Moslem woman should reveal her
face to any man except her husband (and for the
first time to her bridegroom at the wedding)
kept Moslem women out of nursing and the
medical profession generally.
These things are changing. The violent
upheaval of partition which meant the movement
of millions of refugees in and out of Pakistan.
created a volume of human misery and a need
for desperate measures. Refugees arrived wound-
ed, without food and without clothes. Then the
women of Pakistan who had never had an
opportunity of going out and doing any social
service, rallied. Although they were not trained
they volunteered in their thousands-mothers,
grandmothers and daughters went into the
refugee camps. At the same time, Pakistan
women formed a para-military organization in
which they drilled and trained to act in self-
defence. A nursing service on a voluntary basis
was started and these part-trained volunteers
now give regular help in the hospitals.
In addition, a college for women doctors was
opened in conjunction with the Fatima Hospital
at Lahore where 260 women are in training for
their degree in medecine. Women patients must

be treated by women doctors, which means a
duplicate service-one for men and one for
women-so that only an intensification of train-
ing and recruitment can remedy the lot of suffer-
ing women.
In this the international agencies, WHO and
Unicef, are playing their part. Heading the team
is a remarkable, white-haired Scotswoman, Dr.
Jean Orkney, who has spent nearly 20 years in
the service of the women of the subcontinent.

Returning to hospital after day's work.
Around her she has gathered an enthusiastic
team of international nurses, specialists in mid-
wifery, public health and district nursing. Each
has her'"opposite number"in the equally
enthusiastic Pakistan women who will take over
when the UN staff moves on.
They are teaching an increasing number of
girls like Tabinda who very often come, as she
did, veiled to the training college to start their
course which consists of 3 months'preliminary
training ; a year in hospital which includes ward-
training and going out in batches to get experi-
ence in the villages ; then 2i months'nursing
sick children and nine months of public health
nursing.
Until there are enough of these community
midwives, with up-to-date training, the Govern-
ment has still to rely on the untrained dais or
traditional midwives.
Fortunately, they are not all like Babanda.
They may be illiterate and they may. depend more
on lore than on skill, but they are willing to learn.
And there is another inducement-15 rupees a
month scholarships if they attend the Public
Health Centre twice a week for lectures and
demonstrations.
Some like AlIa Raki work with the international
team just for the love of their fellow-beings.
AlIa Raki is poor, young and cheerful. She lives
in an abandoned Hindu Burning Ghat, with
50 other families. The Ghat was the crematorium
where the Hindu dead were burned. The pyres
are still there but around them are the mud-
brick, one-roomed homes of the refugees who
have sheltered there.
With Tabinda, the educated, and AlIa Raki, the
uneducated-both of them the new hopes of Pa-
kistan-I went to the Burning Ghat to see a few-
hours-old baby, born in a stupa or bell-shaped
chapel of a Hindu god. This was dimly lit by
the sunlight through the narrow doorway but the
clay floors had been carefully swept and covered.
Primitive ante-natal preparations had been made
and there was lots of hot water, boiled-up on
fires under the peepul-tree in the temple court-
yard. The delivery had been made under
reasonably safe conditions. The Pakistan nurses
with the coaching of their international tutors
were indoctrinating the mother in child-care.
It is a beginning but women are needed by the
thousand to go out into the villages, where
health services barely exist.
Mother and child services are not just a system
of care and treatment ; they are an education
service as well-a means of breaking through the
isolation of the women, which has meant in the
past that only one woman in a hundred is
literate.
"teach a man", said the Begum Liaquat Ali
Khan, widow of the assassinated Prime Minister
and herself a leader of the women's movement
in Pakistan,.'and you teach one person. Teach
a woman and you teach a whole family."
And Tabinda, her vivid face uncovered, is one
of the teachers. Her example will inspire others.

M'Boumba is a village in Senegal, French West Africa. Its 1, 800 people have no school nor medical service.
For five months of the year, M'Boumba is cut off from the outside world by the flooding Senegal River. The French
authorities have chosen this placeto conduct a three-month fundamental education experiment. Results will guide
education campaigns in other villages. Above, African women fetching water. Left, general view of M'Boumba.
E I L LA EA SENEGALESE VILLAGE
REFUSES TO GO TO SLEEP
WHEN we arrived at M'Boumba it was
already dark, so we expected to see
W nothing of the life of this Senegal vil-
lage until the following morning. But
it was not long before we heard some rhythmic,
mechanical noises and saw an electric light come
on at a street corner-probably the only one
shining in the darkness of the brush country
within a radius of 50 miles or more.
Then we heard the unmistakable sounds of a
village coming to life, and we wondered whether
we were going to be treated to some sort of
group spectacle or entertainment-whether we
should soon be hearing the beating of tom-toms
by André BLANCHET
and the chanting of ritual music in the night.
If so, this was hardly what the organizers of
our trip had led us to expect. We had come to
M'Boumba to see the work of an educational
mission led by M. André Terrisse, head of the
Education Service, Dakar, French West Africa.
It came as a surprise then to learn that the
noises we had heard in the night were the prepa-
rations for a class which the village was due to
attend.
It had not taken M. Terrisse long to realize
that day classes brought poor results. The heat
and lack of shade (for there was no school
building) discouraged both teachers and pupils.
Also, the able-bodied men were busy in the
fields or tending their nocks, so that only the
old men, the women and the children attended
the classes.
Moreover, in a Moslem social environment
(hierarchic, and divided strictly by a caste sys-
tem), it is easier to bring together at night in a
single group the chiefs, the workers and the ser-
vants. The members of the supe-C t. d. h. I.. h on mue on

can attend without being seen,
Continued from and the timid, who by day
prevIous page would hesitate to answer ques-
tions, find courage in the darkness.
And, what is probably more important, teaching
aided by the film screen and loudspeaker com-
mands attention ; eyes and ears strain to see and
hear, and there are no distractions to take them
from the subject.
So the members of the mission, now living in
clay huts 400 miles from their homes, changed
their working hours. The discovery that the
night time was the best period for teaching was
exactly the sort of knowledge the mission was sup-
posed to obtain through practical experience.
Theirs was a pilot mission for testing practical
methods and techniques, a preliminary to funda-
mental education campaigns on a large scale.
These were eventually to be undertaken in the
eight territories of French West Africa as a
"federal experiment."
By definition, fundamental education is design-
ed to help the least-favoured rural populations.
The best field for experiment would have been a
village which had never had contact with the
outside world. M'Boumba almost met this quali-
fication, for, situated on a road which leads
nowhere, and isolated by heavy rains from July to
January, it has seen few Europeans since its
almany or supreme chief, the sovereign of Fouta-
Toro, negotiated with General Faidherbe nearly a
century ago.

. ! te zone* viHage
ON a scholastic and medical map of Senegal, itis shown as a"white zone,"meaning it is
not served by any school, and is much too
isolated to benefit from the services of the nearest
dispensary.
The truth is that M'Boumba itself is partly
responsible for this situation as, on two occasions,
in 1897 and 1924, when schools were established,
they were boycotted by the people. The town
has no public scribe, no trader, not even a market.
The 1, 800 inhabitants are virtually self-sufficient ;
they cultivate their millet, and raise cattle, their
artizans spin cotton, and women make pottery by
hand.
One mystery is where the women get the neck-
laces of flat keys which they wear. To be on the
safe side, M. Terrisse's helpers took care to hide
their own motor car keys
It took a jeep and a lorry to bring the mission
and its equipment to the town. In addition to
teaching, film, sanitation and farm materials, the
five members of the party had to transport sup-
plies for their two-month stay : camp beds, tables,
chairs, stove, dishes, pots, and the indispensable
refrigerator, none of which could have been ob-
tained in M'Boumba. Fortu.
nately, the largest house in the
village was available for them.
The three Africans who
came with M. Terrisse as
members of the mission all
spoke the local Toucouleur
dialect. The teacher, Ibrahim
Ba Ibrahama, was himself a
Toucoul. The farm monitor
knew the dialect well. The
African doctor, Amadou Gueye,
was helped in his task by his
prestige as a hadji (a title given
to Mohammedan pilgrims who
have been to Mecca).
I wondered what would be
the role of these three special-
ists in the kind of night ses-
sion which we were about to
attend. To give medical care
would surely be difficult in
darkness, I thought, and writ-
ing, as far as I knew, had
seldom been taught by a film.
It was later when I saw the
doctor's clinic, besieged by a
crowd of natives, in daylight,
that the marvellous possibili-
ties of the epidiascope, and the
value of film strips, were
brought home to me.
I soon learned that the
prospect of seeing a pro-
remarks to the needs of the audience, the speed
of the changing images is partly balanced.
Voice from the past
By the end of the evening, each of the threeAfrican officials had talked himself hoars .
They spoke with typical African eloquence,
never hesitating, never pausing, and keeping up
with the rhythm of the film. But all three, the
doctor, the teacher and the farm monitor, spoke
so easily and convincingly that a political orator
would have envied their skill.
The only respite any of them got from their
duties at the microphone was during the playing
of musical records, which greatly appealed to the
villagers. Indeed, the records seemed magical to
the people of M'Boumba, for they heard and re-
cognized the voice of a famous singer from a
neighbourhood village, who died several years ago.
As they listened to the song, the tears coursed
down their cheeks.
How much of what the audience see and hear
remains in their minds and affects the life of the
community ? The head of the mission at
M'Boumba believes that audio-visual methods
alone are not adequate for the effective teaching
of reading. They make it possible to teach the
Using the cinema screen and the microphone, a French
screen help to take some of the strangeness out of this
gramme of film strips attracts the village people
like a tom-tom call. At the first show they
had been alarmed by the mechanical sounds made
by the projector, but this had long since been
forgotten.
The programme was varied. M. Maillet, the
team's technician, used the screen to'''converse''
with the audience. A lesson in spoken and writ-
ten French included local place names and simple
words. The first person to read and pronounce
them was applauded and received a small gift.
An envelope addressed to someone in the village
was flashed on the screen, and ther were shouts
of pleasure when the addressee recognized his
name and came to claim the letter.
In chorus, the villagers called out words from
the pages of a spelling book. The best writing
exercises submitted by pupils were shown. Draw-
ings and sketches explained new words, spoken
aloud by the teacher over the loudspeaker, and
then repeated in chorus by all the spectators.
When the doctor wished to explain what a mi-
crobe was, and why mosquitoes are harmful, he
used the epidiascope to show microscopic slides
while he repeated again and again in Toucouleur
the significance of what was being shown.
The possibilities of this apparatus, which unfor-
tunately is large and costly, are manifold. Opa-
que images, flat objects, drawings, photographic
plates, film strips, can all be projected and any
illustrated magazine, even a technical one, can fill
the screen with attractive pictures.
That evening, for example, coloured photo-
graphs of cotton fields and markets and samples
of cloth gave visual substance to an educational
talk. For a public which finds it hard to follow
the fast pace of a film, it is a great advantage to
be able to maintain such images in view long
enough to have their meaning understood.
A good film strip, with commentary in the lan-
guage of the region, always gives better practical
results than a film. In M'Boumba, at any rate,
even the most amusing and instructive animated
cartoons have been failures with the public.
M. Terrisse pointed out that the natives, whose
interest and response is aroused primarily
by concrete facts and objects, and to whose
eyes the projected images are'''new'', remain
quite unmoved by"this super. abstraction of the
modern world".
Even the most didactic documentary films
always hold the natives'attention and can appa-
rently be shown again and again without loss of
interest. Such documentaries as those on cattle
feeding and on pottery-making, for example,
aroused so much excitement that I thought they
were being seen for the first time. Yet they were
already well known to the spectators.
Repetition, it would seem, is welcomed by the
natives, and provided that a commentator explains
the film in the local dialect and adjusts his

alphabet, a few common words, and names of
persons and places. Yet even knowing how to
read and write his name does affect a person's
personality and attitude.
"What is important,"says M. Terrisse,.'is that
the adult, in becoming aware of the usefulness of
reading in terms of practical existence, will now
favour the education of the children."
In this respect, the activities of the mission have
been effective. Not only did a few children,
brought together for a few hours a day, learn
within three weeks to read simple texts and write
short letters, but the whole village decided to
build a school and went to work on it at once.
In comparison with the unfortunate experiences
of 1897 and 1924, this is significant progress.
The Senegal Government responded by pro-
mising the construction of a permanent building
and the provision of a teacher. Meantime, a
former official, now in retirement at M'Boumba,
will act as monitor.
Moreover, the inhabitants of the village have
subscribed 180, 000 francs, and promised to furnish
labour, sand and gravel'for the building of a
dispensary. A male nurse, trained by Dr. Gueye,
: will meantime give first aid to the sick, and help
women in childbirth.
These are not the only promising changes in
the village. Others, however, will not become
obvious until the trees planted during the last
two months have grown to full size. Some will
provide fruit, or wood for carpentry, others will
be merely ornamental.
Much depends on whether the natives continue
to water the plants. Most Africans, of all races,
have still to learn that trees need careful tending.
Another type of improvement, already notice-
able, is in the comfort and sanitary arrange-
ments in the houses. Refuse, for example, is now
being burned.
Films stimulate arts
IT ESSONS in personal cleanliness and in methodsof improving agriculture were the counter-
parts to those given at night. It was
however, the effect of film strips on African arts.
and of films on the making of pottery, that
aroused the artistic feelings of some of the
villagers.
In a village where previously not the slightest
trace of decoration existed, potters, carpenters and
blacksmiths have suddenly found their vocations
and set to work making objects that are not only
useful but also attractive. I remember, in par-
ticular, a surrealist spoon that was given, to
M. Terrisse. And the children are making extra-
ordinary stylized and geometric drawings, which
strikingly recall some of the paintings done by
the bushmen.
The members of the mission tried to liberate
the women from their dawn-to-dusk drudgery of
pounding millet to make the family meal. When
the mission suggested that the village buy a millet
crusher, the response at first was enthusiastic,
But the strict feudal system soon became an
obstacle. There were such strong 9bjections to
using the same apparatus for the chiefs and the
inferior castes that the project had to be dropped.
Thus M'Boumba will continue to resound all
day with the heavy rhythm of the pestles, as the
women, using the traditional graceful movement,
make two pestles dance together in the same
mortar.
It is probable that teams like M. Terrisse's
will be formed to work all over French West
Africa. Thus M'Boumba will not be the only
village to benefit from the demonstrations, the
conversations under the stars, and the 120 films
shown during 60 nights when no one in the village
slept.
A technique has been found which can help
other disinherited villages of Senegal, and directly
or indirectly influence the evolution of 16, 000, 000
human beings.
education mission at M'Boumba"converses"with its audience. During the reading lessons, familiar names-those of local places or people-which are flashed on the
new skill the villagers are learning. Commentaries in the local dialect which accompany films and filmstrips often bring an appreciative smile from the audience.

A WORLD-W) DE WATCH
ON THE ATMOSPHERE
by Maurice GOLDSMITH
FROM August 1957, for a period of 12 months, hundreds of scientists at keypoints throughout the world are to keep a day-and-night watch on the earth's
atmosphere. It will be one of the greatest multi-national efforts ever made to
gather data that will enable us to understand more about the physical influences
governing our daily lives.
All sorts of different scientists will work at it because 0 study of the atmosphere
will help us to find out-among other things-not only what affects our weather
and radio communications, but also something about the earth's fundamental nature.
Systematic scientific study of the atmosphere started in the 17th century with the
works of Italians like Torrieetti. Since then, we have learned a great deal about the
atmosphere immediately around us, but very little about the upper atmosphere, and
almost nothing about the relationship between them.
The lower region of the atmosphere is known as the troposphere. It extends up
to seven or eight miles on the average. In this region the air is never still : in fact,
the prefix tropo means a turning over of the air. The weather that we enjoy-or
complain about-consists of changes in the troposphere.
Above this region, and separated from it by a boundary area known as the tropo-
pauses, lies the stratosphere. This region has in recent years become familiar because
its lower part has become the'''roadway''for our fastest aeroplanes.
The average thickness of the stratosphere is about 50 miles, and the first half of
this is l1Jade up of an ozone layer. This filters out much of the sun's ultraviolet rays,
and allows only as much as we can tolerate to get through to the earth. Our weather
is directly affected by the fluctuations that vccur in the amount of ozone.
It is in the stratosphere, too, that there exists a warm layer directly influencing
radio broadcasting. Short radio waves are absorbed here, especially during the day.
Above the stratosphere lies the vast region of the ionsphere. It derives its name
from the fact that free ions (that is, electrically charged atoms or groups of atoms)
exist there. It is mainly this region that the scientists want to know more about.
Within the ionosphere there are two distinct layers : the E-tayer which is important
because it reflects radio waves back to the earth and makes long-wave broadcasting
possible, and the F-tayer.
It is in the lower part of the ionosphere that the aurora borealis or northern
lights, and the aurora australis or southern lights occur most frequently. This fasci-
nating natural phenomenon, in which streams of different colours dance through the
skies, is even today in parts of the earth regarded as a warning of impending doom.
There are a number of theories explaining the origin and nature of the aurora,
but many problems of the utmost cemplexity and importance await solution. Involved
also is the whole field of magnetic storms, about which more data is needed.
In 1882, scientists co-operated in studies which they called the first International
Polar Year. This was concerned with the investigation of such geophysical phenomena
as magnetic storms and the aurora.
It was believed at that time that the aurora was 0 reflection of light from
icebergs at the North Pole, but this was disproved when it was found that aurora
did not increase in frequency as one went further north.
The second Polar Year was arranged 50 years later, principally to gather data
about magnetic storms. Facts ascertained at that time are still being studied.
Now it is planned in 1957/8 to change the name to the International Geophysical
Year, reflecting the more comprehensive purposes of the studies, and to have about
150 ionosphereic observatories ready for action. The original idea for this Geophysical
Year came from the British scientist, Sydney Chapman, and the American, Lloyd V.
Berkner.
The investigation is so vast that a central planning committee is being set up,
with a secretariat that will remain in being for five years afterwards to organize analy-
sis of the data.
And from all this will emerge knowledge necessary for the international institutions
which serve us continuously. Thus, there will be something for the scientists working
at the International Seismological Observatory in Kw, England, where earthquakes
are mapped ; for those at the International Isostatc Institute in Helsinki, Finland
concerned with the ever more exact determination of the changing shape of the earth ;
for the International latitude Service in Turin, Italy ; and for the Bureau de I'Heure, in
Paris, that gives us our internationally accepted time signals.
These, important as they are, constitute only a small part of the service which
will be rendered to all of us, directly or indirectly, through one of the most massive
co-operatives efforts in the history of science.
CEYLON'S'DRY ZONE
PROSPERITY TO AN
mrwniles out of Colombo,
the counh'yside of Ceylon
undergoes a sudden change.
The palm trees of luxul'iant
plantations thin out, passing cars
kick up little clouds of. dust and
villages grow rarer. Though the
road remains excellent, the jungle
slips up on its borders.
The reason for the sudden change
is that you have passed into the
"dry zone"of Ceylon, so called
because its rainfall is concentrated
in three months. This dry zone
covers three-cjuarters or the island,
but supports only 3, 000, 000 of Cey-
lon's population of 7, 500, 000 which
is growing at the rate of 100, 000
new mouths to feed each year.
Until 20 years ago, much of the
"dry zone"was a waste of malarial
jungle, although, more than 1, 000
years ago, it was here that the
kings of ancient Lanka tamed the
swollen rivers of the rainy season
and put them to work irrigating
paddy fields. But invaders from
the north wrecked the "tanks"
(artificial lakes) which were the
heart of the irrigation system, and
the jungle moved in.
In 10 : \. Ceylon began an irriga-
tion and settlement programme to
put this dry zone back to work
producing rice-Ceylon's staple
food, \vhich she must now import.
In the area of Polonnuruwa alone
(ancient capital of Ceylon and now
a ruined city), 5, 000 families from
all parts of the island have been
settled on new land reclaimed
from the jungle. Ancient tanks
have been restnred and their water
by Daniel
channelled into the green paddy
fields of the colonists.
In order to raise living standards
in this region, whose population
includes 35, 000 colonists, 10, 000
"squatters"who have moved in on
new land, and 1U, 000 villagers
whose ancestors refused to sur-
render to the jungle, Ceylon and
L'nesco have set up a Fundamental
Education centre at the crossroads
village of Minneriya.
Head of the centre is Dr. Duane
Spencer Hatch, an American edu-
cator'who has spent most of his
life doing exactly this sort of
work, beginning in India in 1922,
and whose energy wears out men
half his age, although he will
admit to being"around sixty".
The centre itself kvas opened in
temporary offices while its build-
ings were made ready on the site
of an old Royal Air Force aero-
drome at Minneriya.
The programme of the centre
has two main objectives : to provide
the people of the region'with
opportunities to learn what they
must know to lead better lives, and
to train teachers who can carry on
its work throughout the island.
The foundation of this programme,
Dr. Hatch believes, must rest upon
the people themselves, who live in
17 cotonies and 39 villages dotted
over the 90 square miles which
form the centre's field of activity.
Two of the villages are inhabited
by \'eddahs, the aboriginal peoples
Only two years ago the reservoir below-now forming a vast lake-was covered
by jungle undergrowth. The transformation was effected by the restoration
ofasystemofirrigation tanks, (actually lakes), built in the 12th century A. D. under
the reign of King Larakramabahu the Great, whose statue (above, right) stands
over the ruined royal city of Polonnuruwa. This king built himself a seven-
storyed palace of which only the ruins (above, left) are left standing today.

of Ceylon. Ceylon's two main
linguistic groups are reps'resented
by 2U villages speaking Sinhalese
and 11 speaking Tamil. Many of
the villages lie along jungle trails
accessible only by jeep and, during
the wet season, rising waters
convert some into islands inhabit-
ed mainly by wild animals.
Schools are going up in these
villages, and often the school is the
site of one of the adult education
centre which the Ceylon Unesco
team has opened in the area.
The 17 irrigation colonies are
the homes of the dry zone pioneers ;
in a way, they have many of the
characteristics of boom towns.
Villages like IIingmakgoda have
busy main street lined by shops
selling everything from sarongs to
cameras. At night, a cinema with
its own generator sends a green
glow of neon over the land'wrested
from the jungle.
Although life may be easier in
the colonies nowadays, the land is
not as generous. In the begin-
ning, colonists working newly-
clenred paddy fields could count
on, 40-bushel-per acre rice crops
twice a year, but now yields may
drop as low as 1U bushels per acre.
The CN team earrying out the
programmes of the centre under
Do. Hatch is as international as its
parent organization. Srinavasa
Hao of India is its deputy director ;
Lemon J. Bickham, an American
sent to Ceylon by WHO, is in
charge of health education, and
fore Hakansson of Sweden, an ILU
expert, is responsible for vocation-
al training. The FAO is also
participating by sending an agri-
cultural extension worker to join
its staff.
The most important part of the
centre's work is bringing these
skills to the places where they are
needed. Every other night on a
regular schedule, the centre's staff
loads a motion picture projector,
a filmstrip viewer, an epidiascope
(this device projects picture direct-
ly from a book onto a screen) and
a portable electric generator into
a jeep, and takes them to its adult
education centres.
We accompanied Mr. Rao and
My. Bickham on one of these,
trips, which took us to Sungawila,
a village of 2UO Tamil-speaking
Moslems two hours fw'ay over
jungle trails. As we arrived in
the village, dusk was tailing and
men were lighting fires at the edge
of stockades to draw insects away
from their cattle.
They set up shop at the village
school, a modern cement structure
open on all sides. A string of
coloured lights had been hung
across the school compound and
children were assembling outside,
taking front row seats on the
ground before the screen. A
loudspeaker, hooked up to the
generator, was blaring Tamil mu-
sic to a fascinated audience.
The village headman, U. L. Mo-
hamed Sheriff, was anxious for
the team to set. up an adult educa-
tion centre in the village.
"Every child in this village goes
to school and it's a good school,"
he said,.'but there are some of the
grown-ups \who never had the
chance and they want to learn to
read. You can become an import-
ant man in the village if you know
how to read. You can deal with
shopkeepers and you might even
become a vel t'ÎdanÎ." (The zcl
vidal1i is responsible for allocating
irrigation water to farmers, and is
one of the most respec1cd members

Thirty-five thousand colonists coming from at parts of Ceylon have joined the 10, 000 villagers in the region covered by the
Minneriya Centre. One of the Centre's first goals is to help train more skilled craftsmen like Janis Appuhamy, a carpenter,
(left) for they are needed to build homes in the fast developing region. The staff at Minneriya, whose area includes
17 colonizes and 39 villages, maintains close and friendly contact with their inhabitants. Mrs. Hatch (right) wife of the

light flicked off and the show
began with two entertainment
shots. Then three health films,
with Tamil sound-tracks, were
shown, covering malaria, disease-
carrying insects and vaccination
against smallpox. After the show
ended a question and answer ses-
sion got under way.'
The village shopkeeper, T. S. M.
Sheriff, had a ready answer to a
question on how to get rid of ma-
laria.
"Bring out the pump, put oil on
the \vater in the swamps, clean up
your home and you won't have
malaria."
The village listened and nodded
in unison.
A young man stood up and
asked..'Does it do any good to
be vaccinated ? That boy we saw,
he didn't want to be vaccinated."
The headman rose majestically
and answered slowly :"The man
who refuses to be vaccinated is
afraid. I know now that'when
1 am vaccinated, I am protected
against disease. The man who is
not vaccinated is a coward."
The questions and answers
continued to fly, but Mr. Bickham
and Mr. Rao decided to put an end
to the session..'They've grasped
the point very well,"Mr. Bickham
to ! d us,"We don't want to try to
cram in too much at once-we'll
be back again."
The loudspeaker played the Cey-
lon national anthem, and then the
village went to bed. So did the
Unesco team, on small beds in the
open schoolhouse, after a supper
of sandwiches washed down with
coconut milk.
It was a quiet, cool night with
no uninvited visitors. The next
morning, the team broke camp and
began its trip back home. The
school teacher had no use for the
two rifles he kept loaded beside his
own cot.
Thisisagtimpse of \vhat, in
three years, is to become a"rural
univel'sitv"at Minneriya. One
training seminar has already
been conducted at the centre and
these courses are to be ù regular
part of its programme. Progress
is slow and that is the way it
should be, for quick, spectacular
achievements are not what edu-
cators are seeking. This Ipro-
gramme is aimed at all sides of
peoples'lives-spiritua), mental,
physical, social and economic-
and all sides must move ahead at
the same pace.
As Dr. Hatch put it,"there is no

### 70150: The Teacher who tamed the 'fruit birds' of Lima
Page t2. JANUARY 1953 UNESCO
THE TEACHER WHO
TAMED THE'FRUIT
BIRDS'OF LIM. A
by Rona ! d FENTON
IF you should find yourself in thet magnificent capital city of Peru
and heard some one mention the
Fruit Birds of Lima, your curiosity
would probably be aroused. But it
would be useless to ask the way to
the nearest zoo if you wanted to see
them. The chances are that you
would be told, with a knowing smile,
to visit the home of a teacher named
Bernardino Gines.
The fact is that, up to several
years ago, there were no Fruit Birds
in Lima, or anywhere else in Peru
for that matter, and so no-one could
have told you what pajaros fruteros
were anyway.
It all started when the large
wholesale food market was built just
outside Lima. Like so'many other
cities of Latin America, Lima has
been growing rapidly in population
since the last World War, and the
new market was designed to central-
ize the sale and distribution of the
huge quantities of foodstuffs needed
by the capital.
Around this new market a floating
population soon congregated, made
up chiefly of peasants who had ori-
ginally come to Lima only to sell
their farm produce, but who had
decided to stay on because of the
apparent attractions of city life.
Most of these peasants, however,
quickly learned that city life was
not so glamorous after all.
Ill-prepared to compete with the
city dwellers, they were rarely able
to find permanent jobs or establish
settled homes. Almost all their time
was spent in a desperate attempt to
eke out even a miserable existence.
So they allowed their children to
run wild or abandoned them com-
pletely. And as a result, the Fruit
Birds were"born".
Left to themselves and forced to
find their food and shelter where
they could, groups of boys banded
together into gangs to carry out
large-scale raids on lorries and other
vehicles transporting food from the
provinces in the early hours of the
morning. They concentrated their
attention on loads of fruit, (although
every kind of food vehicle was sub-
ject to their attacks) so that the
people of Lima referred to them as
the Fruit Birds. They constituted a
serious social and police. problem as
well as a costly menace.
When groups of Fruit Birds were
caught by the police, they were
taken into court and the most
serious offenders confined to a refor-
matory. But the pillaging and
early-hour attacks continued. New
gangs continued to spring up to
replace those boys sentenced by the
courts, and new Fruit Birds were
readily found among the numerous
vagabond children nicknamed Palo-'mills (night butterflies).
To one young teacher, Bernardino
Gines, the reformatory was not the
answer. What these delinquent boys
needed more than anything else, he
felt, was understanding and help
rather than punishment and con-
finement.
Bernardino Ginés knew that most
of the Fruit Birds were the sons of
country peasants. Since he himself
had been born in a small farming
community in the interior-a village
called Muquiyauyu, about 60 miles
east of Lima-he was sure that he
could win their confidence and
goodwill by mingling and associating
with them directly.
So he began to spend much of his
time in and around the food market.
Slowly and patiently he gained the
friendship of the Fruit Birds, and
was finally"'accepted"by them.
Then, after living among them for
a whole year and getting to under-
stand them thoroughly, he broke
through their veneer of callousness
and cynicism to convince them that
there were better things in life than
stealing and pilfering, and that as
their friend he was ready to help
them.
Senor Ginés was acquainted with
the results obtained at the children's
reformatory run by the Ministry of
Justice. These had clearly shown
the difficulty of rehabilitating
youths once they had reached the
age of 18. Ginés thought that an
effort to readapt younger children
between the ages of seven and 15
might give more promising results.
His own first-hand experiences
with the Fruit Birds had given him
a thorough knowledge of their pro-
blems and an understanding of the
psychology of their behaviour and
attitudes. These were due to the
mental and physical effects of priva-
tion, and the deep shock at finding
themselves without protection and
forced to struggle on their own
to keep alive. Without this
background of knowledge, it would
have been useless to attempt to
readapt the boys to a normal way of
life.
So Senor Gines was armed with
appropriate rehabilitation methods,
and plenty of potential pupils, but
he had nowhere to work. After
much effort on his part, he was
finally granted a piece of land in
Magdalena del Mar, and immediately
he began his attempt to change a
group of problem children into
healthy, happy youngsters.
Ginés and his pupil friends still
had no school, so they just went
ahead and built one themselves !
They dug the foundations, learned
to lay bricks, became skilled car-
penters and did a score of different
jobs before the building was complet-
ed. This work proved to be a useful
introduction to the new life that
Ginés was planning for the boys.
All this time they were being shown
that they belonged somewhere and
were developing a group spirit and
group action that were now applied
to something worthwhile.
Anyone seeing the completed in-
stitution at Magdelena del Mar, a
suburb of Lima, for the first time
finds it hard to believe that this
spacious building is the handiwork
of the boys for whom it is today a
school and a home. As they worked,
The"Fruit Birds"of Lima and Senor Bernardino Gines, the teacher (wearing
white cap) start consttuction of their new school building in a suburb of the city.
new friends gave them effective aid.
One organization, SECPANE (Pe-
ruvian-American Co-operative Ser-
vice for Education), paid the cost of
installing a water supply system and
the director of SECPANE, Mr. Sulli-
van, became one of the most regular
and devoted helpers of the school.
Finally the school received officials
recognition and was named Escuela
Especial de Readaptacion (Special
School for Rehabilitation)-but not
for long. Senor Ginés rightly pro-
tested that in the minds of the boys
this name would tend to set them
apart from other youngsters, and
that it would create an inferiority
complex. So the name was changed
to El Hogar del Nino (The Child's
Home) which exactly expresses the
purpose and the atmosphere of the
scliool.
Open to children and youths
between six and 16, El Hogar del
Nino gives them a complete element-
ary education and also offers basic
technical training, so that on leaving
they are equipped with a trade that
will enable them to earn a living.
Today the problem children who
once hung around the market of
Lima, and the palomillas whose
homes were in the streets, have
found a new way of life and new
homes in an attractive building sur-
rounded by flower and vegetable
gardens and rows of fruit trees.
To re-educate boys in whom vi-
cious habits and practices have
already become ingrained often
raises special problems. But with a
proper psychological approach and
an infinite faith in the receptive
qualities of young minds and
personalities, Senor Ginés has so far
overcome such obstacles.
There is no rigid system of control
and discipline in his school. Order is
maintained by the students them-
selves. Through a free and demo-
cratic system of elections, which
helps to develop a sense of freedom
as well as of responsibility, the boys
choose their own leaders.
One of the basic principles they
learn is that the rights of every
individual are conditioned by res-
pect for the rights of others, and in
this way they soon realize that co-
operation, not individual selfishness,
brings the best results.
Children remain at the school
just because they wish to do so.
Taking into account the background
and origins of most of them, the
remarkable thing is that so few have
ever run away The reason is that
most of Senor Ginés pupils have now
learned the real meaning of free-
dom.
It is hard to believe that this beautiful school-home, now surrounded by flowers
and fruit trees, was built by a teacher assisted by one-time delinquent boys.
Inside the school there are no servants. In turn, students take charge of tile
various chores in the house. Meals are prepared and served by student teams.

### 70185: Chile: on the threshold of a major transformation
CHILE
JANUARY 1953. Page 13
ITS HEAD IS IN THE TROPIC SUN,
ITS FEET AMID ANTARCTIC SNOWS
THE vast, dry desert region in the north
of the country is the source of Chile's
greatest source of wealth-nitrates.
In fact, rain in Chile's Atacama desert
1t'ould wash away the world's largest
nitrate deposits. Nitrates are used
mainly to produce fertilizers, but they
give a number of important by-
pl'oducts, especially iodine, of which
Chile produces 75 per cent of the
world's needs.
*
NINE-TENTHS of the people of Chilelive in the fertile central region.
Nineteen of the 26 towns having popu-
lations of over 10. 000 are situated there.
*
AT Punta Arenas, in the extreme south,there are 17 hours of daylight each
day during December and January.
*
No one knows exactly how Chile gotits name. Some think it comes from
a quechua Indian word meaning
"snow"or"eoM". Others believe that
it it was originally the name of a valley
which the conquistadores later applied
to the entire country. Another Iheor'l
is that this two-syllable word stems
from the name of a native bird. Or its
origin may be from Aymara Chilli.
1cllich means"the place where the land
ends".
WITH "its head burning in the
tropical sun, while its feet are
freezing", Chile is one of the longest
countries in the world - 2.800 miles,
or more than half the entire length of
the Latin American continent. In width,
however, it rarely exceeds 200 miles -
and in places less than 40 miles.
*
THE Araucanian Indians have anextraordinarily rich musical folklore.
In fact, they have a song appropriate
to every occasion. There are songs for
children, and choruses and ritual songs
which are used in religious and social
ceremonies. Their music has remark-
able rhythm and melody.
*
CHILE has one of the best school
systems in Latin America, with
kindergartens, provision for vocational
training, and other features of modern
education.  One of the oldest pro-
fessional training colleges in America is
the School of Art and Commerce in
Santiago.
*
CHILE has given Latin America one ofits greatest poets : Gabriela Mistral,
winner of the Nobel Prize for literature
in 1945. A diplomal and form/'
teacher, she won her first success in

FOR a number of years, university
groups have led the movement to
give Chile a high standard of drama.
Not only does the National University's
experimental theatre present high
quality productions of both classical and
modan plays in Santiago, but also
sends its troupe throughout the country,
to appear in schools, military camps,
tmde union building and rural centres.
In 1945, this theatre set up a school off
dramatic art. In addition, it runs a
library and provides scholarships for
study abroad. To encourage literary
activity, an annual experimental theatre
prize is also atvarded.

DURING the war between the Spaniardsand the recalcitrant Araucanian
Indians, a young captain named Alonso
de Ercilla wrote verse on scraps of
paper, on bits of teather- on anything
he coulrt lay his hands upon. When
he went back to Spain, he made these
up into a long poem, the first part of
which was published in 1569. La
Araucana, which deals with the early
days of Chile as a nation, was to
become one of the greatest sources
of inspiration to Chilean writers
throughout the 16th and 17th centuries,
and is one of the foremost epics in
llispano-American literalure.

CLAUDIO ARRAU. one of the greatest
pianists in the world today, is a Chi-
lean. Since his first audition in the United
States in 1924, he has been acclaimed
wherever he has played. Other famous
Chilcan pianists include Arnaldo Tapia
Caballero, Armando Palacios, Alfonso
Montecino and Oscar Gacilua.
A trainload of nitrates from the northern deserts of Chile wends
its way through the country's steep mountain slopes bound for a
seaport. The refined nitrates are shipped to all parts of the world.
Juan Fernandez stand, west of Valparaiso, was the scene of an
adventure that inspired the story of Robinson Crusoe. An 18th
century Scottish sailor was stranded there for over four years.
Santiago de Chile is a fine, modern capital, with 1, 200, 000 inha-
bitants-a fifth of the country's population. It is the fourth largest
city in South America, and was founded just over 400 years ago.
For Chile the sea was the earliest and is still the most service-
able highway. Some 30 ports, like Puerto Montt, shown
here, are visited by ships engaged in international trade.
Separated from Punta Arenas-the world's most southerly town-
by the Straits of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego remains the homeland
of a number of Indian tribes who live in the most primitive way.

ON THE THRESHOLD OF A MAJOR
TRANSFORMATION
worse, for there were
already insufficient
schools for all the
hildren entitled to
free and compulsory
education.
The Chilean people
knew that as long as
25 per cent of its
members were handi-
capped by illiteracy,
many plans for indus-
trialization and pro-
gress would remain
unfulfilled. Spurred
by the need for urgent
action, the Govern-
ment therefore em-
barked on a large-
scale educational pro-
gramme, which is now
showing good results.
The situation which
existed in Chile at the
end of the Second
World War was not a
reflection on the ef-
forts made in the
educational fields.
Chile has, in fact,
one of the best school
systems in Latin Ame-
rica, with kindergar-
tens, provision for
vocational training,
and other features
for modern education.
Education is free and
compulsory for all
ODAY Chile stands on thethreshold of a major trans-
formation. In the last few
decades the nature and extent of
the country's hidden wealth have
been more and more seriously ex-
plored. Chile is full of potential
wealth, for it possesses immense
deposits of minerals. Alone among
South American countries, it has
both abundant mineral ore and
native coal. As the existence of im-
portant mineral resources has been
revealed, so industrial development
has forged ahead.
New installations which have shot
up include enormous nitrate and
copper plants. New industries have
begun to develop around Santiago
and in the South. One of the most
important events in this expansion
was the opening of one of South
America's two steel producing plants
at Huachipato near Concepcion, one
of Chile's four main industrial cities.
Even though it is
estimated that 40 per
cent of Chileans still
derive their living
directly from the land,
the industrial way of
life has already made
a strong penetration
into the country. On
a per capita basis, the
new urban Chile now
makes use of more
energy supplied by
water, oil and coaj
than any other Latin
American country.
And as they begin
their march towards
a new industrial fu-
ture which they hope
will mean better
homes, more food and
happier and healthier
lives, Chileans have
not overlooked one of
the basic require-
ments for this trans-
formation-adequate
education for all.
The full realization
of their educational
problem was revealed
to the people of Chile
by a post-war stock-
taking of the nation's
resources, which
showed that some-
thing like one quarter
of the nation's
6, 000, 000 p o p u I a-
tion was illiterate.
With an annual po-
pulation increase of
100, 000, and a total of
25000 children reach-
ing school age each
year, the situation
was bound to become
children betwen the ages of 7 and 15.
But this law is difficult to enforce
because the people in some regions
are widely scattered and funds, due
to fluctuating economic conditions,
have frequently been inadequate.
As far back as 1840, when only
13 per cent of Chile's 1, 500, 000 peo-
ple were literate, the Chilean Repub-
lic was organizing classes at mili-
tary barracks, and opening libraries
where citizens were provided with
free instruction in health and sani-
tation, as well as being taught
reading and writing.
Despite the efforts that were made,
the literacy rate, for a population of
2, 500, 000, was still only 32. 8 per cent
in 1895. Forty-five years later, in
1940, 48 per cent of the population
of 5, 000, 000 could read and write.
It had been hoped that the
introduction of compulsory primary
education in 1920 would remove the
need for adult education, but this
assumption proved to be raise. And
by Tibor MENDE
the revision of ideas about the need
for adult education came simul-
taneously with the opening up of
broader economic horizons for Chile.
The nation was shocked when
Senora Amanda Labarca, head of
seasonal schools and extra-mural
studies, declared in 1939 :"Of every
10, 000 Chileans, 2, 219 are illiterate
adults ; 2, 168 are of school-going
age ; 588 are enrolled in primary
schools ; 61 complete their schooling ;
47 enter secondary schools ; nine
complete their secondary education ;
three enter universities ; only one
receives a degree."
Of all these statistics, the one
which showed that only 61 out of
every 10, 000 Chileans completed
their elementary education produced
the greatest effect. It meant that
in 1939 there were still 250, 000
children who should have been
receiving free and compulsory
elementary education, but who did
not attend classes, either because
their parents needed their services to
help raise the family budget, or
simply because there were no schools
within walking distance of their
homes.
Of the 191, 000 children who
entered elementary schools in 1939,
only one-seventh went through all
the six forms. In reality, a total of
468, 000 children did not get any
schooling at all, despite the compul-
sory education law.
The Government took action to
change the situation revealed by
these statistics. In 1942 it set up the
Anti-Illiteracy and Adult Education
Section (Seccion Alfabetizacion y
Educacion de Adultos) and placed it
under the immediate control of the
Director-General of Primary Educa-
tion.
To increase the number of adult
education schools-then only 38-
many obstacles had to be overcome.
It was difficult to work out a nation-
wide plan, as the Chilean provinces
had educational autonomy. Equip-
ment was lacking, and there was no
administrative machinery for carry-
ing out a large-scale campaign.
The money available seemed
totally inadequate. The amount for
each adult to be educated was only
a fraction of that spent on each child
of school-going age.
Southern Chile possesses many watercourses and a labyrinth of fiords with steep rocky margins.
Large ferries, like this one at Carahue, are used to transport livestock and produce across rivers.
However, thanks to the energy and
enthusiasm of the officials and
educators in the Anti-Illiteracy
Section, a programme was drawn up
and put into action, and it soon led
to an energetic campaign in all parts
of the country.
By the middle of 1951, the number
of adult education schools had grown
to 387, or over ten times the 1942
figure. They were set up for both
general and specific studies. Some
gave instruction in reading and
writing, others taught applied
science, and still others provided
instruction on subjects of practical,
everyday use.
Of the total, 309 ran evening
classes for people over 16. A further
42 were organized in prisons, while
nine were held in hospitals and
sanatoria. Some were begun as
experiments to meet special local
needs. Five of these, for instance,
were mobile schools, two were
devoted to the dissemination of the
arts, and two more taught domestic
economy.
In addition, a symphony orchestra
of teachers was formed, and between
1942 and 1950 it gave 361 concerts in
various parts of the country to over
250, 000 people. Moreover, 223 li-
braries were organized within the
adult education schools, and over
350, 000 readers have taken advantage
of the facilities they have offered
during the past five years. A recent
innovation is a travelling cultural
exhibition which is to visit all parts
of the country.
The adult education classes them-
selves were organized on a three-
term basis. Students who passed
through all three were given a
special certificate so as to increase
their chances of obtaining suitable
employment.
But as fewer than 900 teachers
were provided, all these results could
not have been achieved without
volunteer help. A magnificent res-
ponse came from the general public
to an appeal asking them to take
part in the education of the illiterate
hiembers of the community.
Volunteers came forward in large
numbers. They taught without pay,
and took an active part in a nation-
wide collection of books, educational. aids and equipment which were
then distributed locally by municipal
authorities.
Altogether, over 21, 000 volunteer
teachers came to the aid of the
literacy campaign between 1945 and
1950, nearly half of them being
professional teachers prepared to put
in a few hours'extra teaching each
evening. The remaining 11, 000 were
students and private individuals
who had been inspired by the aims
of the campaign.
The results were encouraging. In
1945, the first year, over 5, 000 people
learned to read and write. Of these,
only 755 were taught in classes, the
remainder being helped by volunteers
at home. These numbers doubled in
the second year of the campaign,
and were trebled in 1947. Altogether,
over 88, 000 people became literate
between 1945 and 1950, thanks to the
educational drive.
However encouraging these results
may be, they are still not sufficient
to solve Chile's illiteracy problem.
The Anti-Illiteracy Section recently
stressed this fact in a poster which
reminded Chileans that the number
of illiterates still equalled the popu-
lation of Santiago, the capital. The
addition of illiterate children under
15 to this figure brings home the
problem more forcefully.
So the campaign is being
expanded, and the radio and cinema
have been mobilized to publicize and
stimulate interest in it. To keep up
their present progressive tempo, the
organizers must rely on help from
teachers'colleges, be allocated in-
creased funds and receive continued
volunteer co-operation. With such
help and resources they are likely to
go far in the next few years towards
their ultimate target, which is to
enable the Chilian people to take full
advantage of their country's econo-
mic possibilities-possibilities which
are now almost within their reach.
The Catholic University of Chile, whose facade is shown
above, is one of the country's four institutions of higher
education, the largest of which is the National University.
Most of Chile's high schools and technical institutes
are situated in Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepcion.

TABINDA
REMOVES
HER VEIL
(Photos Eric Schawb.)
Pakistani women are lifting their heads. As a result of the terrific upheaval which followed partition,
in which millions of refugees poured into Pakistan, women like the Begum Liaquat Ali Khan, wife of
the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, led a movementto bring women out of"purdah"and into social
and public life. It began with women going into the refugee camps to help nurse and serve these unfor-
tunates. This has been followed by the training of women in the hospitals and the establishment of
training in midwifery, hitherto left with lethal results to uneducated and insanitary"dais", or native
midwives. Photo above shows Tabinda, a young Moslem girl, presenting herself at a midwives'school
in Lahore and wearing a"burqua"to cover her face. Below, she pushes aside her veil to register
as a nurse. For the story of Tabinda, symbol of the emancipation of the women of Pakistan, see page 5.
