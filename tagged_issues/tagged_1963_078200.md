MAN vs. STRESSES
OF ANTARCTICA
Men who live hidden like hibernating animals in the
scientific stations of Antarctica (above, an ice tunnel
leading into a research base) undergo severe stresses and
strains. A relentless climate, deprivations of all kinds,
utter isolation and the enforced seclusion that comes
with the long winter night all try mental and physical
resistance to the full. As a leader of Australian Antarctic
expeditions, Phillip Law has been able to study at
first hand the psychological and physiological ills that
affect these polar teams. (See article on page 26)

### 62788: History of mankind: a global view of scientific and cultural development
ORY OF MANKIND
A global view of scientific
and cultural development
i he publication this month of the first volume
of the monumental six-tome History of
Mankind, subtitled Cultural and Scientific Development,
sponsored by Unesco, marks an important date for histor¬
ical science and for International understanding.
Many of the differences that still divide mankind go
back far into the distant past. Yet, as Professor Paulo
E. de Berredo Carneiro, of Brazil, points out In the preface
to the History, a study of the historical antecedents of
its peoples reveals links which draw them nearer to one
another.
"Beyond differences of race, climate, economic structure
and systems of ideas," writes Professor Carneiro, who is
President of the International Commission responsible
for the preparation of a history of the scientific and cul¬
tural development of mankind, "history shows the funda¬
mental identity of the various human groups, making it
possible to discern, in many cases, profound analogies
among the transformations they have undergone from
the Palaeolithic era down to the present time. If we
consider the human species as a whole, we perceive that
the course of its evolution has been accomplished from
one region and from one people to another by way of a
series of oscillations, greater or lesser in extent, longer
or shorter in duration. The different civilizations which
have arisen in the course of the ages correspond to dis¬
tinct phases and patterns of this general movement.
Almost every one them is to be found somewhere in the
world of today. Contemporary society appears as a
mosaic in which the most widely differing cultures adjoin
and confront each other."
Volume One of the History of Mankind, which appears
first in its English edition, deals with prehistory and the
beginnings of civilization. But neither this volume nor
the five others to follow trace the national history of any
country or people in particular. Instead, what they
present is a detailed study of economic and social events,
religious and emotional life, the forms of artistic expres¬
sion and the scientific thinking, and a comparison of these
with the forms taken by the same experiences in other
countries during the same period.
S ir Leonard Woolley, writing in Volume I on
the urbanization of society, for example, exa¬
mines this economic and social process as it occurred In
Egypt, Sumeria, the Indus Valley and China. But he
does not describe in the traditional way the thousand
and one ups and downs in the fortunes of these countries.
From the first volume to the last, and whether authors
are dealing with prehistory or the 20th century, the
chapter headings follow a similar pattern. First an
introduction gives a chronological picture of the histor¬
ical events forming the background to the development
of the great cultural and humanistic institutions. Then
the life of the people, the social structures, economic
activities (crafts, production and trade), the development
of spoken languages, of writing and teaching, religious
life, the development and applications ot science and the
forms of artistic expression are all examined In turn.
The study of the origins of language made by Jacquetta
Hawkes in the first part oí Volume I is followed by Sir
Leonard Woolley's survey on the formation of and dif¬
ferences between spoken languages in Sumeria, Egypt and
China. The subject is taken up again In Volume II, this
time by Professor Lulgl Paretl, who surveys the chief
languages of the period between 1200 B.C. and 400 A.D.,
amongst them Greek, Latin and Sanscrit.
Similarly, It will be possible for the reader to follow the
development of science and Its applications down the
road of history from Its origins in far off antiquity up to
the present 20th century. But once again this is not a
history of French science or Russian science or American
science, but of the development of science as a whole in
which contributions made throughout history by French¬
men, Russians and Americans as well as by scientists from
other countries are given full acknowledgement.
need for a global history of mankind was
Lmade clear at the conference of Ministers of
Education held In London while the world war was still rag¬
ing. The idea was again put forward in 194G, this time by
Dr. Julian Huxley, then Executive Secretary of the Prepa¬
ratory Commission for Unesco, In his report, "Unesco: Its
Purpose and its Philosophy." In 1949, Unesco's General
Conference examined the project and after many prepa¬
ratory meetings and studies, decided on the form the
work would take.
In 1951, and under the aasplces of Unesco, the Interna¬
tional Commission for a History of the Scientific and Cul¬
tural Development of Mankind was formed with its own
executive body and secretariat. The Commission's work
went on for more than ten years during which time
scholars the world over were asked to Join the team
working on the project.
Those closely associated with the work realized the im¬
mensity of the task. From the start it was clear that,
like all works of great originality, it too could expect to
come under rigorous scrutiny. And the final result mast
fully justify the expectations of a world public. Further¬
more, scholars who normally work in private and seclusion,
would here be very much in public view: not only would
the Unesco General Conference periodically discuss the
execution of the project, but historians and scholars
throughout the world have also have to be kept Informed
of the progress of the work.
Since 1953 the editorial plan of the History has been
presented in the pages of the Journal of World History, a g

quarterly review initiated and published by the Interna¬
tional Commission. This review has also published some
chapters from the History as well as major articles cover¬
ing a wide range of subjects relating to scientific and
cultural development. Commissioned by the authors of
the different volumes from their colleagues in all parts
of the world to assist them In compiling this work, these
articles represent the thinking of scholars , from many
countries and with every kind of ideological background.
In all cases scholars were given the widest possible
bounds in which to develop their subjects: the bounds
of human experience. By limiting itself to cultural and
scientific development, the History seeks to attain the
universality which brought Unesco into being and which
guides it today. For, at every stage in the ascent of
humanity and in varying degrees of complexity and
intensity, culture and science have made their contribu¬
tions.
The prehistoric man described by Jacquetta Hawkes in
Volume I was more or less consciously applying certain
scientific principles each time he used a sling, shaped a
flint or discovered the advantages of irrigation and crop
rotation in agriculture. The complexity of the Sumerian
civilization, as seen in its involved structures, scales of
values and Internal relationships, made it a very different
one from that of Egypt. Yet the very existence of both
Sumer and Egypt was conditioned by similar factors: the
fate of both was linked to rivers.

FANTASTIC
BESTIARY
The civilization of Sumer
which flourished 4, 500 years
ago produced a rich art in
which the animal -world is
portrayed in striking poetic
fantasy. The shell plaque
(left) decorated an ornate
lyre unearthed from the
tomb of a ruler of Ur (about
2500 B.C.). It bears a grace¬
fully executed series of little
scenes engraved on a black
enamel base, depicting ani¬
mals with human attributes :
gazelles with bearded human
heads, a dancing bear, a lion
bearing a vase, a dog carrying
a dagger in its belt and
pushing a table, and a donkey
musician. Not only does the
bestiary show animals behav¬
ing like humans, as in the
fables of Aesop and La Fon¬
taine, but it also depicts men
metamorphized as animals,
like the scorpion man (enlar¬
ged at right) who is attend¬
ed by a roguish young goat.
To attain the goal set by the International Commission,
editors of the different volumes worked in clos-3 co-opera¬
tion. Every manuscript was drawn up according to a
plan prepared by Professor Ralph Turner and approved
by the Commission, and each was meticulously revised
after having been widely circulated among Unesco's
National Commissions in all the Member States. Com¬
ments, criticisms and additional facts supplied by spec¬
ialists were used to correct and complete the texts.
Thanks to Unesco's support, this method was used on
a world-wide scale. The long list of historians whose
comments were used in the revision of Volume I includes
Soviet specialists, American and British prehistorians,
French, Italian and German archaeologists and scholars
from Japan, Spain, Mexico and India. In editing this
first volume, Jacquetta Hawkes and Sir Leonard were able
to make use of more than eighty comments from scholars
of world-wide reputation.
Where comments have not been embodied in the texts,
for reasons of historical or even ideological interpretation,
they have nevertheless been included as notes prepared
by the editorial advisers.
In the chapter dealing with intellectual development
for example, the theory advanced by Jacquetta Hawkes
on the origins of languages is supplemented by comments
from an American specialist, Dr. W.C. Sturtevant, who
has different views on this subject. Similarly, from
detailed notes and comments, Sir Leonard Woolley was
able to record his discussion on the origins of Aryan
civilization with Indian scholars. He was also able to
exchange views with Marxist scholars regarding some
social institutions which, in dialectical materialism, are
given a prominence contested by other schools of thought.
The International Commission has used these notes,

without in any way disturbing the continuity of the nar¬
rative, to show readers the great wealth of historical
thought in the 20th century and the differences In inter¬
pretation which it has produced. On controversial ques¬

cular philosophy of history, the Commission carefully
avoided adopting a definite position.

In their texts viewpoints with which they dlsgreed, but

A.G. Bandi. of the University of Berne, and a French
scholar, Professor Jean Leclant, of the University of Stras¬
bourg.

20th century at a key moment in history when there is a
growing consciousness of a civilization embracing all
mankind.

Unesco, In the forward to Volume I; "For the first time
an attempt has been made to present, with respect to the
history of consciousness, the sum total of the knowledge
which the various contemporary societies and cultures
possess... It departs from the traditional approaches to
the study of history, which, as we know, attach decisive
importance to political, economic and even military
factors... This historical study is itself a cultural achieve¬
ment, calculated to Influence, by its spirit and methods,
the present trend of culture. And that, no doubt, Is its
ultimate end."

HISTORY OF MANKIND (Cont'd)
Volume I of the Unesco-sponsored ' History of Mankind ", which appears this
month in its first English edition, is divided into two parts: Prehistory " by
Jacquetta Hawkes, and The Beginnings of Civilization " by Sir Leonard Wool-
ley, both archaeologists of world-wide reputation. In 920 richly illustrated pages
the first volume takes the reader on a fascinating journey into man's earliest
past through the Bronze Age to the development of civilizations in Sumer,
Egypt and Elam, in Phcenecia, Crete, Anatolia, in India and China. Prehistory
and the Beginnings of Civilization " describes what it was like to be a cave
dweller and Stone Age hunter, a weaver, metal worker and farmer, how tech¬
niques, arts and crafts grew, and how languages and writing systems developed.
It takes the reader back to the first gropings of the early ape-men in Africa and
Asia in their efforts to make tools, control fire and forma language, to the mystery
of the Indus Valley civilization at Mohenjo Daro and Harrapa, to the famous wal¬
led Great City of Shang " which set the foundations of Chinese civilization.
On the following pages, The Unesco Courier is privileged to offer its readers
a few selected passages from the vast colourful tapestry of Volume I of " History
of Mankind ", an international publishing venture of unparalleled importance.

THE AWAKENING
he expansion of consciousness is a main
theme of history. Nothing has greater signi¬
ficance than the development and exercise of the human
greatness. This must be the estimate of the humanist;
If it were added that it is through these gifts that God
has made us aware of divinity, then there are few people
in the world who would challenge it.
In man's animal past as one of the primates, the sharp¬
ening of sight at the expense of the more lowly sense
of smell that went with living in trees, contributed to
a heightening of mental faculties; only birds, carnivores
and primates are equipped with a specially sensitive
spot on the retina which provides for great acuteness of
eyesight. When to this sharpness of sight the stereo¬
scopic vision was added, while that habit of grasping
branches and seizing insects and fruit produced a flexible
hand, the way was open for further advance. An ape
or monkey fingering at the same time as it scrutinizes
some unfamiliar object offers a good symbol for the dawn
of both conscious apprehension and skill.
Much has sometimes been made of the great Impor¬
tance for human evolution of the hand with its opposable
thumb; it was important, certainly, but only as the ser¬
vant of a waxing brain. The hands of the higher mon¬
keys would be perfectly capable of the finest skills had
they a mind to set them to work; monkeys could be
watchmakers had they ever conceived the notion of time.
A further stimulus to mental growth was given our
(1) Professor A.C. Blanc (Italy) points out that many authors
have challenged the view that our ancestors left the trees and
only then began to adapt themselves to living in relatively open
country; instead, they consider that life in trees of apes is a
form of specialization which the human species never went
through.
(2) Professor G. F. Debetz (U.SJSJi.) suggests that the use of
the hand in the process of labour activity and of the practical
transformation of objects of nature for the purpose of satisfying
the material requirements of man, conditioned the formation
and development of his spiritual faculties: thinking, attention,
memory; it complicated and improved such psychic function as
sensation and perception. And our ancestors' requirements for
communication, ensuing from joint activities, conditioned inevi¬
tably the beginning and development of speech.
ancestors when they left the trees and a mainly vege¬
tarian diet and began to adapt themselves to living in
relatively open country and eating meat (1). It may be
that the actual chemical constituents of meat were of
benefit to their brains; undoubtedly its nutritive value,
so much greater than that of herbs and fruit, relieved
them of the necessity of perpetual eating.
More important, the need for a creature with a rela¬
tively flat muzzle and lacking sharp claws of canine teeth
to kill, skin and break up animal food must have led
first to the use and then to the manufacture of tools.
Once manufacture had begun, our forebears had stepped
to an altogether higher plane of concentrated visual
attention and manipulative skill. It may be that the
controlled use of the hand helped to develop another
essential human faculty, that of speech (2).
It has been found that movements of the hand pro-

For many years it was thought that the earliest human species
originated in Asia, but it is now generally agreed that Africa
was the birthplace of mankind. It is in Africa that Australo¬
pithecus (reconstructed above with chimpanzee) the most
man-like of the fossil apes has been found. Australopithecus
walked upright and shaped stone tools a million years ago.

voke a sympathetic movement of the mouth, and it may
be that a habit of communicating by gesture helped to
Induce the controlled emission of sounds.
Here again, however, there is need to be chary in any
recognition of cause and effect. Just as monkeys and
some other primates have hands capable of executing
skilful tasks were their brains equal to it, so, too, their
lips, palate and vocal chords are probably capable of
speech. It is brain power that is lacking.
It is easy to say that the need for acute vision, the
ability to manipulate, the necessity of cutting up meat,
the purposeful concentration required to make tools all
led to the multiplication of brain cells in hominid and
human skulls, while each multiplication of cells led In
turn to a further advance in functions.
To this we can add the further Idea favoured by many
biologists that "man is a fcctallzed ape," that is to say
that the direction of human evolution was towards
resembling the young and not the mature primate, and
that this postponing of physical maturity gave opportun¬
ity for a longer period of learning and experiment and
further increase in brain size.
AH this Interplay of cause and effect can be made to
seem very convincing after the event. Yet we should
remember that for thousands of years the Egyptians
seemed to have very good reason for thinking that the
rising of Sirius caused the Nile to Hood. It may be that
the ultimate cause of the waxing of the human brain,
of the expanding of consciousness within It remains as
remote from our knowledge as the mountain sources of
the Nile were to the Egyptians.

have been found in some numbers in the Choukoutien caves
near Peking. Cave deposits proved the ancient human
inhabitants were capable of chipping rough tools and of
maintaining fires for warmth and protection. Their skulls
had a brain capacity just within the modern human range.
F causes are best treated with caution, there
is no doubt that the strengthening of mental
power came with the vast expansion of the cerebral cortex
of New Brain in man. The two hollow hemispheres of the
human cerebrum are so large that they have become
deeply folded and convoluted to house them within the
plates of the skull.
The great size of the frontal and temporal lobes Is
particularly characteristic of man, and they include
among their millions of nerve cells many groups not
enslaved to exact functions but with the storing of
memories and their association. Memory, association,
leading to image-making powers, these are the capacities
necessary for full self-consciousness, for the awareness
of past and future, intelligent anticipation and the build¬
ing of traditions to bind the long life of the race . . .
The self-consciousness that Intensified with the ela¬

more aware of his actions and of his separation from
nature, was to take two main and opposing directions.

accelerating course of our technical and scientific
advance. Here analysis, the breaking down of the whole
into manageable parts, has been the means, and the
ends are wholly practical and material.
The other direction is towards reuniting the part with
the whole, man with the universe from which his
consciousness seemed to divide him. This way led to
ritual, art, religious faith, mysticism and some aspects
of philosophy. Metaphor, simile, symbolical enactments
and other unifying forms have been the means, and the
ends, essentially, are not practical or material.
The very evident weakness of archaeology as a proper
basis for history Is its helpless dépendance on material

The beautiful shape of the hand-axe Itself can, indeed,
be used as a proof of the early emergence of an aesthetic
sense. It has even been suggested that the finest of
these tools, those which seem so much more exquisitely
worked than practical necessity demanded, may have
become cult objects like the ceremonial axes of the Cale¬

of all kinds. It may well be that man's feeling that
certain proportions are right or beautiful has always been
derived from his participation in the natural world,
animate and inanimate, organic and mathematical, from
which he emerged.
But beyond that there is a widely held and also
strongly contested view that human beings are born with
certain innate mental forms which have come into being
through the experience of the evolving species. They are
inherited just as the similarly evolved bodily parts are
inherited, but as they are mental they tend to be
expressed in cultural forms, most obviously in religious
fO myths, which although they differ in outward form With
the tone of the culture concerned, often appear to have
an underlying unity that is world-wide and timeless.
These archetypes might correspond on a higher, more
complex plane to the undoubtedly innate sense of aesthe¬
tic Tightness and such universal tendencies as the
grotesque in art, animal forms, dragons and other recur¬
rent artistic manifestations.
Although many people cannot accept this idea of the
inheritance of mental forms, it is surely far more likely
than that we are born with a mental carte blanche.
At the level of instinct we accept the idea readily enough,
even though the instinctual bequest from the past may
be highly complicated.
Weaver birds, for example, after six generations of
having been reared among other birds and deprived of
their own proper nesting material, can still in the
seventh generation weave their ingenious nests when
given the opportunity. At some time in the remote past
this species gradually perfected a most unusual form of
dwelling construction, and the pattern for it has become
fixed in the brain and central nervous system so that it
can be repeated at any time by reference to this "ins¬
tinctive" pattern book.
Surely, then, it cannot be Impossible for man to inherit
patterns at a more imaginative level from the repetitive
experience of twenty thousand generations? Or, having
Inherited them, that he should find expression for them
in myths and other cultural forms?
At least the possibility is strong enough for it to be
unscientific to ignore it, particularly when considering
the diffusion of cultural traits. When two peoples at some
distance from one another possess some peculiar imple¬
ment, design, myth, In common it may well have been
transferred by trade, migration or a spreading Influence.
These contacts should always be looked for, but If they
cannot be detected, then there remains the alternative
that the trait represents two independent expressions
of a common mental pattern.
Whether or not human beings
inherit mental furniture of this
kind, there is no doubt that we
bring with us from the past very
much more than our bodily parts.
Forty thousand years after the
death of the last Neanderthaler,
Homo sapiens still carries with him
a most powerful inheritance of
passions and emotional tendencies
acquired through the ages. Even
inquisitiveness, the desire to explore,
is an emotion proved to exist already
in animals.
Some modern men have liked to
think of themselves as wholly
rational and their fellows as poten¬
tially so, yet others have concluded
that our species is never capable of
carrying out a rationally formed
intention.
The Sorcerer, part
man, part beast, part
divinity, painted and
engraved on a cave
wall in S.W. France.
(From a drawing in the
Musée de l'Homme, Paris)
The whole course of human
history in which so many great
peoples have hurled themselves to self-destruction,
seems in many ways to support this second point of view.
Some rationalists might be happier to have it otherwise,
but if we lost our emotional inheritance with its ener¬
getic power to galvanize the imagination, the whole
creative life of our kind would soon be withered, parched
as a mummy.

There was a rich artistic flowering among the Palaeolithic, or Old Stone Age, peoples whe produced
works of art that can rival anything that has been achieved in the last ten thousand yean. Paliolitluc
paintings and engravings on the walls of caves and cave shelters have been found In great numbers
in parts of Europe and Africa. Above, the Masked Hunter, an African rock painting from the Sahara

THE DAWN OF ART
i T has been said that Palaeolithic art can claim
'to be the most improbable event in history,
and fundamentally it is as impossible to explain why it
occurred as any of the other sudden upsurges of creative
genius in the arts that, happily for us, have marked the
course of our human existence. The tides of the human
psyche ebbing and flowing in society remain largely
mysterious. Yet at a rather more superficial level there
are explanations and interpretations to be made. On the
one hand there are the permissive factors. While material
prosperity can never be the cause of artistic genius, a
society cannot support its artists without an economic
margin.
Thus there is no doubt that the abundance of game to
be hunted in south-west Europe in late Pleistocene times
made a necessary foundation for the development of
Palaeolithic art. Although the artists were probably
themselves hunters, it seems very likely, particularly as
skill and professionalism grew, that in exchange for their
artistic services to the community they only had to hunt
part-time and were supplied with food while at work in
the caves.
On the other hand there are the uses of art meaning
its uses to society and not the satisfaction It gives to its
creators. A healthy artistic tradition Is seldom without
some more or less practical function, and in primitive
societies where there Is no recognized division between
intellectual, practical and religious activities, art always
must be an Integral part of everyday life.
There'is long-standing dispute between those who have
wished to see cave-palntlng and Its related forms as an
activity undertaken for its own sake, for self-expression
and the creation of beauty and those who see it as a
purely practical activity undertaken to secure good
hunting. This conflict is entirely in the minds of the
disputants. Even in the twentieth century, when life is
lived so much in watertight compartments, no one even
thinks of asking whether the painters of easel pictures u

HISTORY OF MANKIND (Cont'd)
A Stone Age art unsurpassed

their canvasses. To try to separate art and magic and
religion in the unified life of early man shows the folly
of the over-analytical mind.
here is no doubt at all that cave art had its
maglco-rellglous function. In particular it
served that form of it known as sympathetic magic, which
depends upon a belief that similarity or relationship Is
identity, and that anything down to an Image or related
part of a thing will affect the thing itself. It is an idea
which has constantly recurred even in civilized life. Pota¬
toes, when first introduced into Europe, were thought to
cause leprosy because the appearance of some of the tubers
suggested the disease.
It is well known that in modern Europe and America
people still make Images of their enemies and stick them
with pins to secure their death, and this practice makes
an exact analogy to one aspect of the Palaeolithic
hunters' magic.
A considerable number of paintings have spears or darts
drawn or scratched on the animals' flanks. There are
many instances at Lascaux. At Niaux there is a famous
example in which three little pits, naturally formed, have
been enclosed by the outline of a bison, and each
furnished with a dart to give the semblance of wounds...
If one form of sympathetic magic was used to ensure
successful kills, another was to cause an increase of Ufe.
Some of the painted beasts are undoubtedly intended to
be gravid, while the careful representation of bull and
cow bison at the Tue d'Audoubert, and the signs of rites
having been celebrated in the cave, is very suggestive of
¿ fertility magic. That this conception went far beyond
sympathetic magic to form the basis of a fertility reUgion
with a great history before it in Eurasia is shown
unequivocally by the Venuses and other crystallizations of
the mother goddess concept ....
A third type of evidence for the close association of
cave art with magico-religious activities is that provided
by the various drawings of men with animal disguises and
possibly of beings that are part man, part beast, part
divinity like the great Sorcerer of Les Trois Frères himself.
Indeed this cave as a whole proclaims its ritual use as
obviously as any chapel. Passages deep in the rock lead
into a small chamber with walls thickly netted with
engravings of many kinds- of animals, including the
strange group of a man with bison head and other animal
attributes dancing behind two weird hybrid beasts,
apparently in a state of sexual excitement. From this
chamber a tunnel with further engravings curves upwards
to give access to a window opening into a chamber some
twelve feet above the floor, a place where an officiating
medicine man could appear with dramatic effect and
dominate participants gathered below him. It is
extraordinarily stirring, then, to find that the antlered,
phallic, hypnoticaUy staring figure of the Sorcerer has
been painted and engraved on the rock face just beside
this opening.
This magical element in cave art must have had less
force in the home art. It is quite likely that when deer,
mammoth and ibex were carved on spear-throwers, it
was beUeved that these Images might help to make them
effective against the animals represented.
OI N the other hand no one can doubt that the
carving was done partly for the pleasure of
doing and regarding it, for it is pre-eminently decorative.
StiU more is this true of such Uttle carved objects as the
fish palette from the Grotte de Rey and the bone

silhouettes of animals and even the superb horse head
from Mas d'Azil and the horse from Espelugues, Lourdes.
What conceivable purpose other than decoration can the
artist at La Mouthe have had when he engraved an ibex
on his lamp?
There is no doubt that cave art, and to a lesser extent
the home art as well, served the animal cult, part magical
and part truly religious, that underlay the lives of these
hunting peoples. The status of the individual and the
life of the tribe was wholly dependent on the multiplica¬
tion of the game herds and success in hunting them, and
a/t responded to the urgency of these two great needs.
Utilitarian in themselves, they cannot be s parated from
a religious impulse towards a form of co: munion with
animals and nature, a "participation myst.que."
And in this religious aspect we rediscover PalseoUthlc
art as genuine imaginative expression, its creators as true
artists. Just as mediaeval painters could work entirely in
the service of the Christian Church, just as modern
painters work to sell their canvasses to furnish houses and
galleries, so too (and indeed much more consistently)
could the painters of the last glaciation work in the
service of hunting and fertility magic and still remain
artiste.
From that time to this there have been great numbers
of primitive peoples living throughout the world, yet none
has had a representational art to approach theirs. Peoples
who, like some of the AustraUans, make strikingly
effective pictures in connexion with hunting magic lack
their realism and technical skill. More often no attempt
at realistic representation is made, and symbohc designs
or enactments supply the identification needed for
sympathetic magic. A visual identity between the image
and the object has never been considered necessary.
Yet in the whole range of Palaeolithic material only one
example is known with anything of the inartistic and
grisly character often found among the properties of the
primitive magic worker . . . that is the dummy bear with
the real head that had been set up in the sanctum at
Montespan.
All the rest may have been Intended for magical usages,
but was at the same time a true art, and an art In what
we have come to call the humane tradition. In fact it
comes closer to Chinese drawing and painting than to
any other, and the Chinese were inspired by a mystical
conception of the relationship between man and nature.
The art Itself makes It abundantly clear that the Stone-
Age artists knew an intense self-identification with the
animals they portrayed. Perhaps with a strengthening
self-consciousness due in part to the development of fully
expressive language, a factor which would also have
heightened their Image-making powers, these people felt
a need to re-affirm their participation in nature.
modern poet has said that "the poetic image
ishows the artist seeking to express unity with
all that Is and has been," and this was true of the first
artist as of the latest. Various attempts have been made
to suggest that the cave-painters used dead beasts as
their models, or that the sight of shadows suggested the
idea of painting shapes on the cave wall. Such ideas are
entirely misleading. Anyone with any understanding of
the creative process must know that the artiste working
in these fastnesses so remote from the outer world carried
with them intense and emotionally charged Images of the
animals on which their Uves were centred.
The creative act, as in all true art, had already taken
place In the imagination; the pigments, the gravers, served
only to give it material expression. With all utilitarian
magical functions apart, this element of communion
with their animal subjects made the activity of these
artiste at one with the religious life of their societies.

HISTORY OF MANKIND (Cont'd)

### 62791: A Schoolboy in Sumer
A SCHOOLBOY IN SUMER
by Sir Leonard Woolley
he literate element of the Sumerian and Old
Babylonian population was proportionately
larger than in Egypt. There were "junior" and "high"
scribes, scribes of the temple and "royal" scribes of the
palace, scribes who served as leading officials in the gov¬
ernment and scribes specialized in particular cate¬
gories of administrative work, schoolmasters and notaries
public, the latter being the more in demand because of
the immense importance of foreign and domestic trade
and because the law required documentary evidence in
any civil action that came before the courts.
It may well be that apart from all these professional
writers, who numbered many thousands, the business¬
man also might acquire at least a smattering of literary
education for his own purposes; in any case it is clear
that there must have been numerous scribal schools... the
best example of a school is one in a private house of the
Larsa period (c. 1780 B.C.) at Ur . . . .
It was a small school it could scarcely have accom¬
modated more than two dozen boys but presumably it
was typical of the schools of the time, and certainly it
was not just an elementary school but one catering for
pupils of all ages.
The bun-shaped tablets [found here], bearing on one
face the teacher's fair copy and on the other the pupil's
attempt to reproduce it, start with single syllabic signs,
then have lists of words beginning with the same syllable,
and go on to proper sentences and extracts from the
classics. Of the other tablets found here many were
religious texts which were probably used for dictation
or for learning by heart; there were numerous mathe¬
matical tablets multiplication tables, rules for extracting
square and cube roots, etc., problems in practical geome¬
try, e.g. land surveying or the calculation of the amount
of earth to be moved, given the measurements of an
excavation, and there were also what one must call belles
lettres, amongst them a favourite classic describing school
life 	
Only boys attended the schools. Women scribes exist¬
ed, and examples of their work have come down to us,
but how they received their education we do not know;
girl students are never mentioned in the literature of
the schools ....
Cases are known in which a charitable person
who had adopted an outcast baby "rescued him from
the jaws of a dog" crowned his benefaction by sending
the child to school to "learn the scribal art . . . ."
The full school course was a long one, lasting for
many years, "from the time of childhood to maturity",
but after about two years a lad might qualify as a
dubsar tur, a junior scribe, and would be entrusted with
the task of helping in the education of one of the smaller
THE SCRIBE
14
The scribe, even if he
were not in government
employ, had the intellec¬
tual arrogance of the
better-educated man and
his contempt for the man¬
ual labourer. There is
an amusing illustration of
this In the Teaching of
Khety, Son of Duauf, an
Egyptian work perhaps
dating as early as the Eleventh Dynasty
but current in much later times, in which
a father taking his son to school exhorts
him to industry by passing in review all
the other occupations and trades and
showing how ill they compare with the
blessings of the scribe's calling:
"I have never seen the smith as an
ambassador, but I have seen the smith at
his work at the mouth of his furnace, his
fingers like the crocodile's, and he stank
more than fishes' eggs ....
"The stonemason finds his work in every
kind of hard stone. When he has finished
his labours his arms are worn out, and
he sleeps all doubled up until sunrise.
His knees and his spine are broken . . .
"The barber shaves from morning till
night; he never sits down except to meals.
He hurries from house to house looking
for business. He wears out his arms
to fill his stomach, like bees eating their
own honey ....
"The farmer wears the same clothes for
all times. His voice is as raucous as a
crow's. His fingers are always busy, his
arms are dried up by the wind. He takes
his rest when he does get any rest in
the mud. If he is in good health he shares
good health with the beasts; if he is ill
his bed is the bare earth in the middle of
his beasts. Scarcely doeo he get home at
night when off he has to start again.
"Therefore, apply your heart to learning.
In truth there is nothing that can compare
with it. If you have profited by a single
day at school it is a gain for eternity."

Thirty-seven centuries ago the city of Ur pos¬
sessed numerous schools. Above, the plan of
a typical one which comprised several classrooms,
a courtyard and a lavatory and could accomodate
25 pupils. Sumerian schools were originally
attached to temples but in time became secular¬
ized. With an ever-widening curriculum, the
Sumerian school became a real seat of learning.
"Within its walls", the Sumerian scholar, S.N.
Kramer, has written "flourished the scholar

gical, botanical, zoological, mineralogical, geogra¬
phical, mathematical, grammatical and linguistic
knowledge was current in his day, and who in
a number of cases added to this knowledge".
boys, setting his exercises, instructing him in the way
in which they should be done, correcting them (prior to
final correction by the headmaster) and flogging him
when he deserved punishment.
Discipline was strict. Boys might be "kept in" over long
periods; probably already they were given impositions,
though it is only in the Neo-Babylonian time that we
find actual examples of pupils having to write "fifty
lines" or "a hundred lines" by way of punishment: but
for the most part correction was by the stick, and the
stick was used freely, by masters and by pupil-teachers
alike.
This is made very clear in the "Schooldays" essay.
"What did you da at school?" "I reckoned up [or.
'recited'] my tablet, ate my lunch, fashioned my
[new] tablet, wrote and finished it; then they assigned
me my oral work, and in the afternoon they assigned
me my written work. When the school was dismissed.
I went home, entered the house, and found my father
sitting there. I told my father of my written work, then
recited my tablet to him, and my father was delighted."
This must have been a lucky day, but on the morrow
the boy was to be less fortunate. "When I awoke early
In the morning I faced my mother and said to her: 'Give
me my lunch; I want to go to school.' My mother gave
me two rolls and I set out. In the school the 'man on
duty' said to me: 'Why are you late?' Afraid, and
with my heart pounding, I entered before my teacher
and bowed."
But the teacher was correcting the student's tablet of
the day before and was not pleased with it, so gave him
a caning. Then the overseer "in charge of the school
regulation" flogged him because "you stared about in the
street." and again because he was "not properly dressed"
and other members of the staff caned him for such
misdemeanours as talking, standing up out of turn and
walking outside the gate; finally the headmaster told him,
"Your handwriting is unsatisfactory." and gave him a
further beating.
The luckless youth appeals to his father to mollify the
powers above In the orthodox way, so the father invites
the headmaster to his home, praises him for all that he
has done to educate his son, gives him food and wine,
dresses him In a new garment and puts a ring on his
finger; the schoolboy waits upon him and In the mean¬
while "unfolds to his father all that he has learnt of
the art of tablet-writing."
The gratified teacher reacts with enthusiasm: "Of your
brothers may you be their leader, of your friends may
you be their chief, may you rank the highest of the
schoolboys. You have carried out well the school's acti¬
vities, you have become a man of learning," the schoolboy,
claiming now the proud title of "Sumerian..."
The picture Is, of course, satirical to the point of cari¬
cature. Admittedly, In the private schools at any rate,
the headmaster had to make his living by means of the
tuition fees collected from the students and may have
been glad enough to receive something in addition;
admittedly methods of Instruction were primitive and
sometimes brutal; yet the Mesopotamian schools did pro¬
vide a sound education and did uphold the general res¬
pect for learning as such.

THE FIRST

OF CHINA
& BABYLON
"opular opinion has mistakenly ascribed
to the Mesopotamians and, still more,
to the Egyptians, a profound understanding of astronom¬
ical phenomena. It is indeed a fact that various buildings
in Egypt and elsewhere were oriented on heavenly bodies;
and to people for whom those bodies have no particular
significance this seems to be a mysterious fact implying
scientific knowledge of a very abstruse sort. It really
implies nothing of the kind; it is simply the result of
careful observation of what could not safely be dis¬
regarded.
Mere observation of the heavenly bodies, if carefully
maintained, will suffice to show that their relative posi¬
tions change and repeat themselves in a definite space
of time, and such movements can be related to the agri¬
cultural seasons or may themselves determine the times
for religious celebrations. The sun, the moon and the
planets were gods who, as such, directly influenced man's
fate.
Civil life depended upon the regular succession of days
and months and years, all of which are fixed by the
course of the sun and the moon, and similarly the gods
moving about In the upper spheres bring peace or war
upon earth, destruction or prosperity; their movements,
therefore must be watched and, if possible, interpreted
In the light of experience or analogy.
onsequently from a very early time such
'phenomena were observed and recorded, but
that Is not the same as saying that astronomy begins
early; men's interest in the celestial bodies was calendral
on the one side and astrological on the other. Professor
Neugebauer has defined that matter succinctly and
authoritatively: "Astronomy does not originate with the
recognition of irregular configurations of stars or the
invention of celestial or astral deities. Scientific
astronomy does not begin until an attempt is made to
predict, however crudely, astronomical phenomena such as
the phases of the moon." That attempt came later . . .
Only in the course of the first miUennium B.C. did
Babylonian astronomers succeed in predicting the lengths
of the lunar months and it was only from Babylon that
the Egyptians subsequently acquired such knowledge.
The advance from observation to prediction was reaUy
made impossible for the Egyptian by the elementary char¬
acter of his mathematical system which could not cope
with the elaborate calculations demanded by astronomy.
It would appear that, having once obtained, by very simple
observations, the agricultural and ritual data necessary
to an ordered Ufe, he had no urge to pursue the matter
16 further.

which shows an interest, and possibly a knowledge, ante¬
dating anything of the sort in Egypt. The Inscription
by itself is insufficient to prove that the Interest went
beyond the recording of a striking phenomenon, and the
fact that the record figures in an oracle-text may well
raise doubts as to its scientific value.
But In the Chou records we are told that In the thirty-
eighth year of the reign of the Shang "emperor" Ti-hsin
(1137 B.C.) the Chou ruler Chou-wen-wang ordered a
sacrifice to be offered because "the eclipse happened not
on the right day": it occurred on the sixteenth day of the
month, according to the calendar, instead of on the
fifteenth.
This, If the construction put upon it be correct, surely
implies that as early as the twelfth century B.C. Chinese
astronomers were able to calculate the lunar ecUpses in
advance, and that with such confidence that an error
of twenty-four hours was enough to alarm the authori¬
ties. The Anyang inscription may possibly Imply know¬

he Babylonians, possessing a mathematical
basis for astronomical calculations much
superior to that of the Egyptians, made far greater
progress in the astronomical field and started at quite an
early date to amass a corpus of information which would
ultimately supply the material for science. The earliest
computations were concerned with (a) the duration of
day and night in the different seasons (b) the rising and
setting of the moon, and (c) the appearance and
disappearance of Venus.
From the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 B.C.)
onwards the omen tcxLs, which combine astrological fore¬
casts with astronomical observations, prove the careful
attention paid to astral phenomena. (3) Thus the sixty-
third tablet of the great astrological series "Enuma, Anu,
EnlH" which was put into shape between 1400 and 900
B.C. contains a list of the heliacal risings and settings
of Venus during twenty-one years of the reign of Am-
mizaduga; the observations must have been made at the
time, I. c. In the late seventeenth or early sixteenth
century B.C. But what we have here Is simply observa¬
tion which was carefully conducted over a considerable
period; it docs not involve any scientific theory...
The evidence that wc possess Justifies us In saying that
by 1200 B.C. in Babylonia the foundations of real astro¬
nomical research, as defined by Professor Ncugcbauer,
had been well and truly laid. Further it appears likely,
though it cannot be definitely affirmed, that already the
first tentatives steps had been taken in the direction of
scientific thinking over the data which careful observation
had amassed, and that certain rather crude and elemen¬
tary results had been achieved which in the course of the
following mllennlum would be developed into the astro¬
nomical science inherited by the Greeks.

(3) The character of the "omen texts" can be illustrated here
by two examples; one, dated to the time of the First Dynasty of
Babylon, reads, "If the sky was dark on the first day the year
will be bad. If the sky was clear when the new moon appeared
the year will be happy." A more elaborate text, taken from the

MEDICINE
... More perhaps than any other art
was medicine in the ancient world
internationalized. A famous Egyptian
doctor might travel far afield to treat an
important patient. Thus Parimachu the
Egyptian was summoned to Asia Minor
to the sick-bed of the king of Tarkhuntash.
Ramses II, according to a late story,
sent his court physician to Hattusas to

Hittite king Hattusilis it is interesting to
note that, when the doctor failed to drive
out the demon that possessed her,
Pharoah was constrained to send the
holy image of the god Khonsu, by
whose aid the cure was duly effected.

treaty with Kadashman-Enil II of Babylon,
was at pains to explain away the
embarrassing fact that a Babylonian phy¬
sician who was visiting the Hittite coun
try had been forcibly detained there.
Personal visits of the sort were really
not uncommon, but what more than
anything proves the universality of
medicine is the fact that medical books
circulated freely from one country to
another; Hittite copies of Babylonian
medical tablets have been unearthed at
Bogazhöy, and it is evident that the phar¬
macopoeia and the prescriptions based
upon it .were in some measure the
common property of doctors throughout
the Middle East.
It is this internationalization of medi¬
cine, and the great reputation won by
Mesopotamian physicians, that account
for the adoption by European peoples
(through Greek and later through Arabic)
of numerous Mesopotamian plant-names,
while, on the other hand, the tablets
definitely explain certain plant-names as
being foreign and the herbs consequently
imported, as, for instance, ricinus from
Elam and cardamom from Anatolia.
But while the evidence shows that in
the art of healing there was throughout
the Middle East a certain amount of free
trade in medical service and in medical
knowledge, it must still be remembered
that by common consent the actual drug
was held to be less potent than the magic
rites with which it was administered.
The successful physician was he who
knew both sides of his profession, and it
was because of this duality that there was
a limit to the international character of
medicine. The gods of the different
countries were not the same, and a
charm that worked satisfactorily in Baby¬
lon might fall upon deaf ears in Memphis...

### 62793: Birth of glass
BIRTH OF GLASS
FROM a very early date the Egyptian potter had,
as a side-line to his ordinary business, prac¬
tised the making of vessels in glazed frit.
Glaze had been known at the beginning of the
Dynastic Age and was applied to small objects cut
out of steatite or moulded in frit (or siliceous paste)
and soon vases were made in the same way; the tech¬
nique spread quickly, and beads of glazed frit occur
fairly freely in Sumer in the Early Dynastic period.
The glaze, was, of course, glass, and about a
dozen objects (nearly all small beads) made of real
glass can be assigned to relatively early times in
Egypt to the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties and in
Mesopotamia to about 2100 BC and on the whole
it seems that Mesopotamia may here have been
the first in the field, especially as an example of
glass from Eridu is a fair-sized lump, unshaped, a
piece of the manufacturer's raw material.
But shortly before 1600 B.C. the discovery was
made that slender rods of coloured glass, half-
melted, could be twisted round a core into the
form of a bottle, then re-heated so that the rods
should coalesce, and then polished; during the second
stage the soft surface could be "combed" so as
to produce waves in the rods, thus variegating the
pattern at the craftsman's pleasure; the result was
a little polychrome vase, lustrous and semi-translucent,
unlike anything else known and certain to command
a high price.
THE earliest examples of such come from Syria,
to which country the invention may be credited,
but by the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty
the Egyptians had taken it over and were making
vases finer in quality than the Syrians had ever made.
The same technique was used for manufacturing
beads, large balls with polychrome inlay in the
form of "eyes" or rosettes.
These gaily attractive ornaments, easily portable
and not too fragile, were ideal objects of trade
with the peoples of less civilized or of barbarous
lands, and they were exported widely, westwards
to Italy and across the European continent, to come
to light again ¡n graves in Britain, while the eastern
trade took them to China and to Indonesia "eye-
beads" from Loyang (the Chou capital) are proved
by spectrographs analysis to be identical with others
from Qau in Egypt.
The Chinese imitated such imported beads with
great success so much so that the polychrome
beads made in South China are only to be distin¬
guished from the foreign examples by their marked
barium content, whereas the Egyptian and Syrian
glass contains no trace of barium, and also by the
presence of lead, which in the west is not found
in glass until shortly before the Christian era.
The facts seem to show that lead glass "flint
glass" as It is often called was a Chinese invention;
it is an invention that has had far-reaching results
in glass manufacture, but it was due to experiments
prompted by the beads of silica-soda-lime glass
coming from the Middle East.

" For three days I have been looking after the wounded
from the battle at Solferino and I have tended over a
thousand of these unfortunate men. We have had
40,000 in all, both Allies and Austrians. There are not
enough doctors, and in their place I have had to make
the best use I could of a few local women and the
prisoners who are fit enough to help ..."
Henry Dunant (1828-1910)
here were tears in the eyes of the young man
who was feverishly writing these lines at the
corner of a blood-stained table. Henry Dunant, Just turn¬
ed 31, was the eldest son of a well-to-do Genevese family.
He was an enterprising young man and a great traveller
always on the look-out for profitable transactions. But
he had not come to the battlefield to open cases of lint.
His purpose was to put before the Emperor Napoleon III
a plan for building mills at Mons Djémila in Algeria.
But the Emperor, caracoling on horseback in the
distance in the midst of his brightly-uniformed staff, had
other things to think of at that moment. It was the
evening of the day of battle, June 24, 1859, and from all
sides came the groans of the dying and the agonized
screams of the wounded stricken with gangrene. Forget¬
ting what had brought him there, the stylishly dressed
-traveller hurried about the field of slaughter trying to
ease the human agony that had upset his plans.
There was only one dressing-station in a church at
Castiglione, the Chiesa Maggiore. Here, Dunant organiz¬
ed volunteers for first-aid. He got the village women to
bring linen, water, and lint. He himself helped to wash
wounds, distributed lemons and tobacco to the wounded
and gave them water to drink. Thanks to his efforts,
Austrian doctors among the prisoners of war were
"freed" to treat the wounded. Helped by the Piedmontese
peasant women he tended and comforted over a
thousand wounded and if he still found time In the small
hours to pen some lines. It was because sleep had deserted
him and he felt somehow Impelled to tell the Influential
people living peacefully at Geneva about the horror of the
battlefield he himself had Just left, exhausted with fatigue
and emotion.
The terrifying memory of the Chiesa Maggiore haunt¬
ed him and it was only by writing what were to be the
first lines of a memoir that he could find some peace
of mind again. Entitled "A Memory of Solferino", this
booklet of 128 pages was at first intended only for his
family and his numerous friends. It was a private edition
limited to 1,600 copies; its subject, "the battle and its
horrors, the suffering of the wounded left to die, their
cries, their tears, their agony which remain fresh and
piercing in the author's memory". In conclusion Dunant
proposed the setting up in every country of "relief
societies" to give aid to the wounded In time of war.
The book was published In 18C2. Dunant sent it to the
leading citizens of Geneva to governments, to men of
letters, to princes. Europe was shaken by Its revelations.
The Goncourt brothers hailed it as "liner, a thousand
times finer, than Homer", and declared, "one puts down
this book cursing war". Dickens published extracts from
Dunant's book In his "All the Year Round" review.

THE RED CROSS (Cont'd)
Henry Dunant, a practical idealist
The king of Saxony asked Dunant to visit him and told
him: "A nation that does not take part in this human¬
itarian work will be censured by European public opin¬
ion." Queen Isabella II of Spain organized a "Permanent
Committee for Help to the Wounded". The king of
Prussia and Sweden, the Tsar, and the Emperor of France
all gave Dunant their support.
Having made a triumphant tour of all the Courts of
Europe, Dunant felt that the moment was ripe for inter¬
national action. With the collaboration of four Swiss
friendsGeneral Gulllaume-Henri Dufour, Gustave Moy-
nler, a barrister, and two doctors, Théodore Maunoir and
Louis Appla he set about persuading the different coun¬
tries to set up national societies for help to the wounded
in time of war.
The five friends held their first meeting at Geneva on
February 17, 1863, under the chairmanship of General
Dufour, a veteran of the Napoleonic wars, a well-known
figure whose presence was an International guarantee
for the movement. They decided to set themselves up as
a "Permanent International Committee for Help to the
Wounded of the Armed Forces." Eight months later, the
Committee succeeded in bringing about an "International
Conference" to remedy the inadequacy of medical services
with armies in the field. Unofficial delegates from 16
countries met at Geneva to approve the suggestions of
the "Committee of Five."
The neutrality of the wounded and of medical personnel
was discussed, and it was decided that thenceforward
they should be protected by a distinctive sign a red cross
on a white field a reproduction of the Swiss flag with
the colours reversed. This symbol was eventually to win
recognition from all governments, except Arab countries
which chose the Red Crescent, and Iran which took the
Red Lion and Sun as its emblem.
But this was not enough, as the Prusso-Danlsh war
1864 was soon to prove. The delegates of the Committee
to the warring countries found themselves reduced to the
role of observers. They could do little more than collect
facts, though valuable use was made of this information
in pressing home the aims of the Committee. The
convening of an international conference of delegates
who would sign specific engagements in the names of
their respective governments was now considered. The
Swiss Confederation invited 25 states to take part in a
diplomatic conference at Geneva, starting on August 8,
1864.
here was, however, a great deal of suspicion to
be allayed, vanity to be soothed, and opposition
to be overcome. Bavaria and the Vatican did not send
representatives. At the outset, the Russians were reluctant.
Austria was convinced that her medical services were
faultless. More than once, negotiations ground to a halt.
Finally, after seven laborious meetings, the first Geneva
Convention the basic charter of the Red Cross, called
the "Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition
of the Wounded in Armies in the Field" was signed by
12 countries on August 22, 1864, and was left open for the
accession of powers which did not sign.
As war swept over Eur¬
ope in 1939 millions

scattered and countless
men, women and chil¬
dren were deported and
interned. More often than
not the Red Cross was
the last resource for tra¬

ing persons. Into the

tives, combatant and non-

Red Cross-Anpfoto, Amsterdam Today when a catastrophe strikes anywhere in the world where local resources are too small to
relieve suffering, the Red Cross goes into action. In 19 53 dykes In the Netherlands gave way and
the floods this caused (above) affected 80,000 people. Red Cross help was given to thousands of
destitute people. That year, 129 million Swiss francs (Nearly $'30 million or over Jl10 million)
worth of aid went to the world's victims of natural calamities, which Included floods In Yugoslavia,
Japan and India, and earthquakes in Greece and Turkey. In the past 10 years 97 appeals have been met.
However, the event passed practically unnoticed. As
for Dunant, who had for the last five years been travell¬
ing from one end of Europe to the other, he had some¬
what neglected his private affairs. His business in Algeria
had been doing very badly and eventually he went bank¬
rupt. Ruined and faced with scandal, he chose exile.
Unlucky in finance, he was later to admit that "as a man
of letters, he knew nothing about business".
At the same time, Gustave Moynier succeeded General
Dufour as President of the International Committee.
Dunant now severed all links with Geneva. Shortly after¬
wards, the Prusso-Austrian War of 1868 broke out. Serious
difficulties arose. Critics said the volunteer service was
badly organized and that delegates were ill-informed
about the situation and the real needs. Help came much
too late, or very often, too lavishly where It was not
required. There were not enough nurses on the first
hospital trains. The wounded were not always cared for
in proper time.
Meanwhile, Dunant had settled in Paris. When the
Franco-Prussian War broke out, he did his best, with
mixed success, to remind the French ministers of the
existence of the Geneva Convention which France had
signed. He also suggested that certain towns in the Paris
area should be neutralized and designated as "cities for
the wounded".
B.y now however, his ideas were being adopted.
'For the first time in history, 25 national socie¬
ties offered their help to the belligerents. Here and there
on the front, field dressing stations and military hospitals
protected by the sign of the Red Cross, were saving thous¬
ands of wounded from death. Despite great difficulties,
34 field dressing-stations had been organized at the front
by the French Society for Relief of the Wounded. This
was still far too little, of course. At Worth, at Gravelotte,
at Sedan, barns filled with wounded, resounded to the
groans of the dying, just as they had at Solferino. In
Germany, where the funds collected had reached the sum
of 70 million marks, there were still only two doctors and
ten nurses to a thousand wounded!
Nevertheless, the International Committee sent off
7,000 parcels, organized a mail service between the
wounded in enemy hands and their families, and forward¬
ed up to 1,000 letters a day. Governments made hand
some contributions to the national societies and gifts
flowed In. Lists of the French wounded In Germany and
of the German wounded In France were drawn up and
published for the benefit of their families. Numerous
convoys of wounded were repatriated through Switzerland.
Dunant was to save some other victims from death the
following year at the time of the Commune of Paris,
before he sank Into a life of abject poverty which took
him across Europe. Sometimes he slept on a bench In
some railway waiting room or else took advantage of the
temporary hospitality offered by his few remaining
friends in London, Paris, or Stuttgart.
|uring this period, he attempted to found a
"Universal Alliance for Order and Civiliza¬
tion", lectured In London on the conditions of prisoners
of war, outlined a plan for an "International High Court
of Arbitration", and preoccupied himself with the cam¬
paign against slavery. Then, one day, unobtrusively, he
drifted Into a poorhouse at Helden In the Swiss canton
of Appenzell where he was to live mlsanthroplcally on
three francs a day the gift of a friend. lie was not then
70 years old but he looked 80.
Nevertheless, he started once again to launch pacifist
appeals and humanitarian programmes, and at the same
time worked unceasingly on his memoirs which are
nothing but the long complaint of a tortured man. There
he remained, forgotten by his country and the world at
large, until the day he was discovered by a Journalist,
who had believed him long dead and burled. Dunant
was sitting In his armchair with his long white beard and
his gentle, sad eyes, but his former eloquence was un-
dlmmed.
Long-denied recognition came at last. In 1897, he was
awarded the Prize of the International Congress of Medi¬
cine, and in 1901 the first Nobel Peace Prize which he
shared with Frédéric Passy. On October 30, 1910. the
"Man in White", as the soldiers at Solferino had called
him, died peacefully. He went almost furtively to his
grave, for by his own request, there was no funeral pro¬
cession. It was the village carpenter who alone trundled
the coffin to the graveyard on a simple handcart.

THE RED CROSS (Cont'd)
Ready to help disaster victims everywhere
Cross and Its International Committee were already active
throughout the world. The International Committee is
an independent collégial authority of which all the
members (a maximum of 25) are Swiss citizens elected
every three years. Aided by State contributions, collec¬
tions, and gifts from private individuals, the Red Cross
was able to lend Its services everywhere, including the
Boer War and the war between Russia and Japan. On the
eve of the first World War, It was ready and equipped to
resolutely put into practice its basic principles of human¬
ity, Impartiality, neutrality, and independence.
From 1914 to 1918, the Central Prisoner of War Agency
received information from the belligerents about prisoners
and filed 5,000,000 index cards. As many as 18,000 replies
were sent each day. Four hundred and fifty thousand
sick and wounded were exchanged. Two million parcels
were distributed. Between the years 1919 and 1922,
500,000 prisoners of war were repatriated. Each national
society worked to the limit of its resources; by 1918, the
British Red Cross, for instance, was spending £20,000
($56,000) a year.
When civil war broke out In Spain, only skilled diplo¬
macy won the Red Cross the right to act In an Internal
conflict. It had already worked in other conflicts: the
Gran Chaco war and wars in Ethiopia and in China.
HThen came the second World War. For
five years, the International Committee
gave help to prisoners of war and to
civilians who had been interned or
deported. Red Cross representatives,
some of whom met their deaths while
performing their duties, even succeeded
in making their way into concentration
camps. Four thousand people worked at the Central Pri¬
soner of War Agency which dealt with 40,000 documents
each day, and received in all some 53 million letters.
Through the International Red Cross Committee, 10
million civilian messages were exchanged between belli¬
gerent countries; 36 million parcels to a value of 3,000
million Swiss francs were sent to prisoners of war in
Germany alone. Forty Red Cross ships travelled all over
the world carrying sick and wounded, as well as food
supplies.
Shortly after the end of the second World War,
"Geneva Law" was codified, and the four Conventions of
August 12, 1949, are now its legal basis. They concern:
the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and
sick in armed forces in the field;
the amelioration of the condition of the wounded, sick
and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea;
the treatment of prisoners of war;
the protection of civilian persons in time of war.
The Red Cross has carried out its work
through all subsequent conflicts, wher¬
ever blood has been shed: In Greece,
Palestine, Suez, Cyprus, Indo-Chlna, the
Lebanon, Cuba, Rhodesia, Algeria, the
Congo, Laos, Nepal, Yemen. Every¬
where, It raises its voice against suffer¬
ing and brings effective relief.
In 1919, just after the end of the first World War, Henry
P. Davidson, President of the American Red Cross, pro¬
posed that a federation be formed of all the national
societies so that the impetus of their work during the
war should be carried on Into peacetime. On May 5, of
that year, there was born the League of Red Cross, Red
24 Crescent, and Red Lion and Sun Societies.
Since that time, the League has given help all over
the world wherever there is suffering, and whenever a
disaster is too great to be met by a country's own
resources.
Thus, practical form has been given an idea put
forward by Henry Dunant, who appealed for the organi¬
zation of international help when floods ravaged the south
of France in 1875. Today, the League groups 88 societies
totalling some 155 million members. Its aim is to en¬
courage the formation of national Red Cross Societies in
countries where there are none, to contribute to the well-
being of humanity, and to co-ordinate help in times of
national disaster.
The work of the League is co-ordinated by the Advisory
Committee on International Disaster Relief which has its
offices in Geneva. There are international centres, and
a telecommunications service ensures constant liaison
with the technicians of each national society. An Inter¬
national Relief Handbook (a complete guide to disaster
relief) defines in detail the work of specialists when wide-
scale action has to be taken to help refugees, or the
victims of epidemics, floods, earthquakes, and other
natural disasters, and covers, in fact, all kinds of inter¬
national relief.
Between 1947 and 1957, the total value of the relief
co-ordinated by the League amounted to 400 million
Swiss francs. These international activities are a new
proof of the co-operative spirit which guides the Red
Cross.
Not a year goes by without appeals for help being made
to the member societies. In 1953, the sea burst through
the dykes in Holland and thousands of people were left
destitute, losing their houses and the land they had cul¬
tivated. When the water receded ,salt had made the soil
unfit for agriculture. The Dutch Red Cross received help
amounting to 14,639,000 Swiss francs ($3.4 million or £1.2
million) from 39 national societies.
The year 1960 brought a series of
disasters: there were floods In Greece,
an earthquake in Peru, and famine in
Brazil; the earthquake at Agadir in
Morocco left 18,000 people homeless. Red
Cross societies sent staff, and gifts of
over 10 million Swiss francs ($2.3 million
or £820,000) to meet these catastrophes.
During the last 10 years, the League has responded to
97 international appeals from 47 countries all over the
world in order to help victims of all kinds of disasters.
The aim is not to duplicate what others are doing already,
but to give emergency aid whenever the need arises.
The wide field of the societies' activities, which range
from nursing instruction to training first-aid workers
to tend the victims of as terrible a disaster as an atomic
war, has given them the status of public services, indis¬
pensable both on national and international levels.
Though born on the battlefield, the Red Cross is above
all a great force in time of peace which must be cons¬
tantly ready to relieve human suffering and to safeguard
human values. It is not an institution but a movement
able to adapt itself to all circumstances.
Today the International Red Cross must adapt Itself
to the changing conditions of our contemporary world
and with the development of atomic weapons has felt
that it cannot blind itself to the consequences of a possible
nuclear conflict. Recently the head of the Japanese Red
Cross posed the problem openly and squarely and
suggested that doctors should be given special training
in radioactivity and also stressed the need for a co¬
ordinated study by all Red Cross societies of radioactivity,
its dangers, and methods of treatment.
As Ernest Renan wrote when he sent Henry Dunant a
letter of congratulation on the Red Cross: "You have
created the greatest undertaking of our century. Europe
may have greater need of it than We think."

### 62795: The Mental strains of Antarctic solitude
Life at an Antarctic station is life In a test
tube; the environment is one in which men
and their behaviour can be subjected to searching
scrutiny. Observations which are made on small teams
in this remote region will provide valuable material for
the social scientist concerned with man In his more
complex urban society and are not the least important
Antarctic investigations (1).
Men who winter at an Antarctic station are cut off from
all except radio contact with the civilized world for many
months. Their sense of utter isolation is increased by a
number of deprivations the lack of female compan¬
ionship, of comforts and luxuries, of variety in food,
liquor and amenities, and of daily contact with a wide
range of different human beings.
The main stresses at such a station are psychological
stresses those between individuals, those between groups
and those between the leader and his party. The mental
stresses are aggravated by physiological factors resulting
from the disturbance of diurnal rhythms in the body
during periods of continuous daylight or darkness; in
addition there is the depressing effect of high winds, dull
cloudy weather and intense cold.
In a large city a man with peculiar characteristics,
strange prejudices, or embarrassing weaknesses, can often
escape from stress situations merely by avoiding them.
At a remote station a man's avenues of escape are consi¬
derably restricted, and his chances of hiding his
weaknesses are almost nil. Even the desire to hide them
disappears.
Deeply ingrained social or intellectual differences in
(1) We remind readers that our January 19C2 issue was entirely
devoted to "Antarctica, International Land of Science."
men present some of the worst problems In such an
environment. They tend to occur mainly amongst men
of low intelligence and Inferior educational qualifications.
A man with a strong sense of inferiority may tend to be
aggressive and difficult In his relations with other men
and therefore become unpopular. There Is thus a
descending spiral of deterioration in his morale, often
accompanied by a developing persecution complex. Exam¬
ples of superiority complexes, on the other hand, are not
Infrequent. Intellectual arrogance is common among
young freshly graduated scientists, but the Influences at
a station tend to correct this fault rather than to
accentuate It as the year goes by.
Most men at an Antarctic station instinctively realize
the need for holding their emotions on a tight rein. For
instance, quarrels serious enough to end in a brawl back
home rarely terminate In physical violence in Antarctica.
Men seem to be innately aware of the Irrevocable nature
of an actual blow in an environment where for months
to come one must dally meet one's antagonist face fo face.
C. S. Mullin and H. J. M. Connery, writing in 1959 of
United States Antarctic bases, noted that headaches were
the most common psychosomatic complaint and that they
occurred more frequently amongst the scientists and
officers than amongst the navy enlisted men. They
reported that the headaches were apparently related to
the sharply felt need for careful control of aggression and
they ascribed the difference between the two groups to
the more complete repression of their hostilities by the
former group.
At Australian stations the commonest psychosomatic
symptoms have been those associated with the digestive
tract, such as dyspepsia" and various abdominal pains.

### 62795: The Mental strains of Antarctic solitude
ANTARCTIC SOLITUDE (Cont'd)
The torment of the long polar night
Headaches rate far lower on the list and are not more
common amongst the intellectuals. When headaches have
been notable amongst Australian intellectuals they have
been associated with over-worked, over-conscientious
men struggling day after day with heavy routines of
observation and instrument maintenance in the face of
numerous difficulties, rather than with the repression of
aggressive tendencies.
Other ills are insomnia, with its consequent ailments,
and rheumatic "aches and pains." Both these have been
noted at French and Argentine bases. Argentine investi¬
gators also report that at their stations changes in diet
and water produce mild gastro-intestinal troubles in more
than 40 % of men shortly after reaching Antarctica. It
is possible that some of their trouble is psychosomatic.
Ac
f
graph of the morale at a station shows a
»fairly regular pattern each year.. It starts off
at a low level during the relief period, when the men who
have just arrived, unsure of themselves in their new
environment, feel ill at ease in the presence of the pre¬
vious, experienced party and look forward to the departure
of the ship so that they can be completely alone with their
new possessions and responsibilities. When the ship sails
their morale surges up to its highest point and for several
months the general activity and enthusiasm is maintained
at this level.
Then the long winter night, with its limitation of
outdoor activity and its absence of sunshine, causes a
general deterioration in morale, varying in degree with
different parties. The graph rises again when the sun
returns and men can busy themselves preparing for
spring and summer field trips. Another high point is
finally reached in the last two months, when the prospect
of relief looms attractively close and the contemplation of
unfinished work spurs men who wish to complete their
tasks to renewed efforts.
During the return voyage, the men's behaviour is in
marked contrast with that exhibited during their outward
trip. They tend to be lethargic, lacking in exhuberance,
cynical, more individually isolated, drained of intense
feeling and interested in little except their early delivery
to a home port.
The mid-winter low in morale is generally accompanied
by Insomnia in a large proportion of men. In a big party
this is not serious; as most suffer from it, it becomes
accepted as normal.
However, in a small party, the situation can be more
serious. As we all know, the worst thing to do about
insomnia is to worry about it, and a man who is the only
"insomniac" amongst four or five sound sleepers is hard
to reassure.
The interesting feature of insomnia is that it tends to
occur more during the mid-winter period of 24-hour
darkness than during summer's continuous daylight. No
doubt the high peak of outdoor activity which coincides
with summer is the differentiating factor here.
O(ne of the most difficult subjects for study at
an Antarctic station is that of sex. We know
very little of the sexual disturbances and abnormalities
caused by the deprivation of woman's company suffered
by men at these bases. We do known that no single
deprivation counts as greatly as that of women. However,
this matter is much broader than the narrow question
of the lack of natural sexual Intercourse. I venture to
say that, for a number of reasons, sexual deprivation in
28 the narrow sense Is not nearly as important as many
people might expect; while the lack of female compan¬
ionship in the wider sense is felt very greatly.
In our experience men seem to accept the absence of
any sex life realistically ; their attitude can be summed
up by the sentence: "There is nothing you can do about
it, so the less you think of it the better." Ameliorating
factors are, first, the absence of the constant sexual
stimulants which abound in a civilized environment
(pretty girls, advertisements, sexy magazines and films,
and so on), and, secondly, the sublimation of sexual
energy into hard work which undoubtedly occurs.
Food becomes an item of the greatest importance in
Antarctica. This is not only because the climate and the
hard work encourage healthy appetites; in addition food
acts as a psychological compensation for other depri¬
vations.
The incidence of severe mental Illness at Antarctic
stations Is very low, owing to the care with which men
açe selected. Neuroses of varying degrees of severity,
however, are fairly common. Frequently they occur
amongst ,men who are brought face to face in this
exacting environment with their own ineptitude In some
field or other and who suffer from an acute feeling of
insufficiency in the face of problems from which there Is
no escape other than a neurotic one. Aggressive, blustering
behaviour is often adopted by such men to hide their
feelings of inadequacy.
Homesickness, fear of the dangers of the environment,
family problems at home, violent personal antipathies
between men these can all produce neurotic symptoms.
The anxiety state of the authoritarian type of leader
who fails to obtain the support of his party is another
example of neurotic behaviour. This is a complex matter
in which offended ego, a sense of failure, a tendency to
drive himself to the limits of his physical strength, and
the reaction upon him of the resentment of the
antagonised members of his party all play a part.
J. H. Rohrer has stated that all six people evacuated by
U. S. authorities from International Geophysical Year
bases in Antarctica for psychiatric reasons developed
symptoms of mental disturbance In from one to four
weeks after arriving. Experience of Australian stations
has been similar, the worst cases of mental disturbance
occurring within from two to eight weeks of the departure
of the relief ship which landed the men. Apparently the
impact of the environment is immediate and severe.
Serious breakdowns in Antarctica occur mostly in young
men less than 25 years of age.
he greatest obstacle to the building of a happy,
contented, well-adjusted party is the diffe¬
rence in cultural levels of various men. What topics
of conversation can be common to all? How does a leader
prevent the development of an intellectual clique at meals,
when the more erudite men gather at one end to discuss
philosophical profundities, and the less informed mem¬
bers, tiring of the continual highbrow conversation, sit
and jeer and try to break it up?
It is here that the cinema proves its worth as an
amenity; not so much because it provides an escape from
the environment, but because it creates talking points for
conversation. A cinema is also a source of group
enjoymentmen congregate together to partake of what
the evening has to offer.
A very marked feature of the psychology of Antarctic
stations is the hunger for recognition and praise exhibited
by many of the men. This is most apparent amongst
those with strong inferiority complexes to whom I have
already referred. This desire is a perfectly normal one,
which is accentuated when the man down south counts
up the hardships, the deprivations and the dangers he
has to face in carrying out his work.

Life in an icy wasteland with buffeting blizzards
and all the rigors of the Antarctic winter ¡s a
severe trial for the polar teams even when
they are housed in a "village" like the one shown
above at the Australian base of Mawson. Right,
a great moment in the life of a polar station:
a relief team takes over (in this photo, at the
French Dumont-d'Urville station in Adelie
Land). One group will soon begin the long
voyage home; the newcomers are at the
start of a grand adventure. Meantime, they
exchange news and experiences. Below, unex¬
pected polar scene. Moscow music hall artists
on tour near the North Pole entertain scientists

every effort is made to maintain the morale of
the men during their long period of isolation.

NATURE'S ICE-BOX.
The conservation of food
stocks presents no problem
when a natural refrigerator
can be built from blocks of
ice. Food becomes an item
of the greatest importance
in Antarctica. This is not
only because the climate and
hard work encourage appe¬
tites; food also becomes
a psychological compensa¬
tion for other deprivations.
Jacques Masson-French Polar Expeditions
The ideal expedition man
When the task is completed he quite naturally expects
a pat on the back. It is possible, also, that in Antarctica
he suffers from the lack of such everyday recognition and
praise which back at home arises normally in the home
environment the commendation and the loving adulation
of mother, wife and children.
A good leader can go far towards gaining the loyalty
and goodwill of such men by the judicious use of praise,
by making sure that other members of the party are
notified of the special achievements of Individuals, and by
guaranteeing that published reports will give adequate
recognition of the personal achievements of the separate
men.
Obviously, the selection of the personnel for an Antarc¬
tic station is a task of the greatest importance. The man
I have learned to avoid most in choosing an Antarctic
team is the group-disruptive egoist. Overweening egoism
is always dangerous, but a certain amount of ambition
and pride is essential to produce the driving force which
urges a man on when the going is toughest. If one can
find a man with ambition, who is proud of his accom¬
plishments and is eager to excel, but who is humble in
spirit and self-critical in outlook, then one has a very
powerful combination indeed.
The first and most Important requirement in an expedi¬
tion man Is that he shall love his job. A man is judged
in Antarctica by his companions largely on the basis of
his efficiency in his work. The man who won't pull his
weight, and slacks or Is incompetent in his specialized
3Q job, is highly resented. A good man, on the other hand,
experiences a double sense of accomplishment the reali¬
zation of having done his job well, and the gratification
of knowing that his competence has been appreciated
by his fellows.
The second essential is unselfishness, which embraces
thoughtfulness for others. Closely behind unselfishness
I would place tolerance tolerance of other men's views,
other men's idiosyncrasies, other men's failings.
Optimism, I think is also important. Pessimists I avoid
like the plague, also cynics. A sense of adventure and an
avid curiosity are desirable, but we have had good men
who possessed neither.
Character, guts and "stickability" are basically essential,
for a year is a long time and the difficulties which
confront a man are many.
Nevertheless, a year in Antarctica can be a most reward¬
ing experience. Apart from the more obvious rewards
such as broadened experience, real adventure and magni¬
ficent scenery, one may experience the true companion¬
ship of men working together, in humour and kindliness
courage and unselfishness, towards a common goal.
Phillip Garth Law has been director of the Antartic
Division of Australia's Department of External Affairs since
1949. He led the Australian National Antarctic Research
Expeditions which established the first permanent Australian
station at Mawson, MacRobertson Land, in 1954. His article
is based on an address he delivered to the British Medical Asso¬
ciation in Melbourne, later published in the "Medical Journal" of
Australia (Feb. 20, 1960).

Letters to the Editor
THE CASE
FOR ESPERANTO
Sir,
One has often seen nonsense written
about the International Language and
about the contemporary world lan¬
guage problem in general. Yet rarely
does one find such a concentration of
absurd statements as in Mr. Robert
H. J. van Kuyk's letter which you
published in your March 1963 issue.
Mr. van Kuyk says "Esperanto is
an artificial language itself a
contradiction in terminis..." It would
perhaps be permissible to use the word
"natural" as a figurative description
of the spontaneous creation of lan¬
guage up to a certain stage in its
development, although from a strictly
scientific point of view it is absolutely
erroneous to apply the term to lan¬
guage. Language did not arise and
does not evolve as something "natural":
it is a product of human society.
The world-famous linguist Antoine
Meillet has written: "Language is an
institution belonging to the social
group", while the Russian linguist A.
S. Cikobava states straightforwardly
that "language is a social pheno¬
menon." There are no serious
contemporary linguists or sociologists
who would deny this fundamental
truth. And a society, in the sense of
a group of people who use a given
language to satisfy the needs of mutual
comprehension, may be as history
shows a tribe, a nation, a religious
community, even a class or caste, or
some other social grouping, not
excluding an international collective
using the International Language for
the purposes of international commu¬
nication.
There are no "natural" or "un¬
natural" languages, but only languages
as instruments of social communica¬
tion. For this reason the term
"natural", if applied to language, is
erroneous, leading as it does to the
unscientific treatment of a social
phenomenon as biological and,
consequently, to fatal mistakes and
false conclusions. By the same token,
the a priori formula "artificial lan¬
guage a contradiction in terminis" is
completely meaningless.
Furthermore I find myself quite
unable to understand how a person
who asserts that Esperanto, as an
"artificial" language, is a "contradic¬
tion in terminis", and therefore
impossible, can at the same time state
that he has spoken it. If the word
"logic" still retains its normal mean¬
ing, it would seem utterly impossible
to learn a language which simply does
not exist, since, being "self-contradic¬
tory", it cannot function as a lan¬
guage.
Mr. van Kuyk alleges that the
International Language is not "viable
because it lacks the cultural and
spiritual foundations that give to a
language its quality of language". So
at first, language is something "natu¬
ral", whereby the "artificial" Espe¬
ranto is a "contradiction in terminis";
but by the next line language is based
on "cultural foundations", that is on a
purely social category which, accord¬
ing to Mr. van Kuyk, even gives it its
quality of language.
It is not clear what the author
understands by "cultural and spiritual
foundations", since language as such
even that of the most primitive
stages of development represents the
greatest single cultural value, linked
to which are all of mankind's other
cultural values. He seems to mean
not this, but rather the cultural values
created in a language, probably mainly
those of literature.
Now if this were the case there
would not be very many languages in
the world. According to Meillet and
Cohen's major work Les Langues du
Monde, the number of languages, not
counting the "local forms of lan¬
guages" is between 2,500 and 3,500.
Of these, only about 25 are important
by virtue of being widely disseminated
and in view of the works written in
them, whilst only 40 to 50 languages
have any literature at all, important
or unimportant. If the criterion for
the definition of a language were
really "cultural foundations" in this
sense, thousands of languages which
exist in the world today or which have
existed in the past would simply not
be languages.
Esperanto, on the other hand in
which a relatively rich literature,
translated and original, has already
been created (the library of the British
Esperanto Association in London
contains more than 30,000 items), in
which various magazines and literary,
scientific and specialist periodicals arc
published regularly throughout the
world, and which is widely used in
broadcasting, in international con¬
gresses and conferences, for scientific
exchanges and for all manner of other
international contacts Esperanto,
then, probably belongs with the 25 or
so languages which are important by
virtue of being widely disseminated,
and certainly, at the very least, with
the 40-50 other "cultural languages".
The General Conference of
Unesco, by its resolution of Decem¬
ber 10, 1954, noted, amongst other
things, "the results attained by Espe¬
ranto in the field of international intel¬
lectual relations and the rapproche¬
ment of the peoples of the world"
and recognised that "these results cor¬
respond with the aims and ideals of
Unesco."
Knowing nothing of the cultural
values already created and constantly
being created in the International
Language, and knowing nothing of the
spirit of humanism which animates it,
Mr. van Kuyk has attempted to define
language in such a way as to force
the exclusion of Esperanto.
In fact, it was included even by his
extremely narrow and quite unac¬
ceptable idea of language, while at
the same time thousands of "natural"
languages were excludedprecisely
those which one line higher up were
the only "real" languages, since if the
word "natural" is to be used at all
when speaking of language, clearly it
could possibly be applied, with all
appropriate reservations, only to the
languages and "local forms of lan¬
guages" which have not reached the
stage of being literary languages, as
observed by the famous linguist Max
Müller as many as 100 years ago.
Mr. van Kuyk would have us believe
that his "study of Esperanto" has
convinced him that "this language is
not suitable for general use and thus
can do little to build practicable roads
between the nations". It is not bare
"study", but rather practical utilization
of the International Language in all
aspects of international relations,
which has convinced hundreds of
thousands of men and women of all
nations and in all five continents that
the opposite is the case, as acknow¬
ledged further by the previously
mentioned resolution of the General
Conference of Uni.sco.
Unlike Mr. van Kuyk, the great
Russian author Leon Tolstoy, who
"was able after no more than two
hours of study, if not to write, at
least to read this language with case"
(Vol. 67, p. 101 of the Russian edition
of his "Collected Works"), wrote in
1889 that "this language satisfies the
requirements fully" and that he would
"endeavour to spread this language"
(Vol. 64, p. 34) to the best of his
ability.
Lastly Mr. van Kuyk advises us
that preferably wc should learn
English, Russian, Chinese, Arabic,
French, and Spanish, rather than
Esperanto. Foreign national languages
have of course been taught for many
years in schools in all countries of the
world. Millions of working hours arc
devoted to this end every week, with
the net result that in the vast majority
of cases the pupils, after several years'
study, arc just capable of saying, in
the language they have "learnt", that
they cannot speak it, or possibly a
very little more than that.
Has all this effort of learning
foreign languages solved the language
problem? Clearly no: prior to the
First World War, French was more
or less the only language of diplomacy,
the League of Nations had two official
languages; the U.N. has five, and
Unesco itself, at its General Confe¬
rence, has eight official languages, of
which four are working languages.
Such is the reality, and it costs man¬
kind limitless effort and vast material
resources. Esperanto does not aim to
do away with the national languages,

but to resolve this chaotic situation in
the interests of international under¬
standing on all levels and at the same
time in the interests of all the national
languages, both great and small, which
represent the most valuable cultural
treasures of all nations.
Besides, a knowledge of Esperanto
in no way hinders the learning of
other languages by people who have
the talent and the inclination to study
foreign languages. On the contrary,
experiments conducted in schools of
various countries have shown that a
knowledge of Esperanto, by virtue of
the logical structure of its grammar
and its syntactical transparency,
facilitates not only the learning of
foreign national languages, but also
an improved understanding of one's
own literary language.
I myself have active command of
seven languages (in five of which I
have written books or specialist studies)
and passive understanding of another
seven; on the basis of this personal
experience I can say that (I) knowledge
of Esperanto has helped me greatly
in the acquisition of those languages,
and 00 even with such a relatively
wide mastery of languages I constantly,
almost every day, face all manner of
difficulties due to the language prob¬
lem.
On reading Mr. van Kuyk's letter I
recalled part of the brilliant foreword
by Prof. P. Bargellini, one of the
foremost contemporary Italian art
critics, to the Esperanto edition of
Dante's complete Divine Comedy, to
be published shortly in the Universal
Esperanto Association's "Orient-Occi¬
dent" series.
Prof. Bargellini, describing the
situation with regard to Dante at the
end of the fifteenth century, remarks
"the humanists, too, had changed
their attitude towards the 'vulgar
poet', and a scholar such as Chris-
toforo Landino, who lectured on
rhetoric at the Florence 'Studio'...
was entitled to deliver a commentary
on Dante's poem without violating his
dignity as a scholar and a latinist."
Nearly two centuries had to pass
before the scholars of that day dared
to acknowledge this masterpiece of
the world's literature without the fear
that in dealing with a poem written
in a "vulgar" language they would
jeopardise their dignity, prestige and
reputation. The International Lan¬
guage is not the only language that
has had to face, and still does face,
the barriers of prejudice and supersti¬
tion.

From the Unesco New
sUBMARINE VILLAGERS: A team
of ten men from the French océanographie
vessel "Calypso", now on a research
expedition in the Red Sea, will spend about
two months on the sea bed, working from a
"submarine village" of three houses which
will be built for them and their equipment.
The divers will also explore the sea bottom
to a depth of 6,500 feet.
( FOR IMPROVING EDUCA¬
TION: A grant of $200,000 from the
Ford Foundation and another of $150,000
from the International Bank for Recons¬
truction and Development have been made
to help establish an International Institute
for Educational Planning in Paris. Due to
open this year, the Institute will provide
training courses for civil servants, educ¬
ational planners and economists and will
co-ordinate knowledge and experience of
value to countries developing their
educational systems. The establishment
of the Institute was authorized by Unesco's
General Conference last December.
K ALINGA FILM PRIZE 1964: The
Kalinga Film Prize (the equivalent of
£ 2,000 offered through the intermediary of
Unesco by the Indian industrialist, Mr. B. J.
Patnaik, creator of the Kalinga Science
Prize) is to be awarded, for the second
time, in 1964. To be eligible, films must
have been made between lanuary 1, 1963
and June 30, 1964 and must deal with
an outstanding achievement in education,
science or culture resulting from inter¬
national co-operation. Entries may be
submitted only through National Com¬
missions for Unesco from whom full
information can be obtained.
T«OYS FOR TEACHING: Girls and
boys in Ibadan, Nigeria, recently flocked
to a fascinating exhibition of educational
toys, ranging from building blocks to
model railway trains. Entitled "Learning
to Live", the exhibition stressed the special
importance of the educational toy in
newly-developing Africa where many
children lack experience with mechanical
and manipulative toys which can be of
value from the age of three to adolescence.
M.OSCOW FILM FESTIVAL: The
third Moscow Film Festival which is held
"to" choose and award prizes for the best
productions of the cinema art, to develop
co-operation between cinema workers of
different countries and to strengthen
friendship between nations", will take
place from July 7 to July 21. At the
first festival in 1959, 44 countries took
part and 134 films were shown. At the
second, in 1961, 55 countries participated
and 251 films were shown.
TiECHNICAL TRAINING IN TURIN:
An international centre where workers from
developing countries will take advanced
oi technical and vocational training courses
will be set up by the International Labour
Organization in Turin. For the first two
years about 600 candidates will be
accepted annually for training as skilled
workers, technicians, instructors, foremen
and administrators. Italy is contributing
about $7,500,000 towards costs for the first
ten years and is to provide 300 fellow¬
ships annually.
K.ANGAROO SOS: A campaign has
been launched in Australia to protect the
kangaroo from wholesale slaughter. The
kangaroo is killed for its meat, and in
1961-62 over two and a half million pounds
of kangaroo meat were exported. Professor
A. J. Marshall, the Australian zoologist
who started the protection campaign, aims
to protect the kangaroo from the same
fate as the other 35 species of Australian
marsupials animals which carry their
young in their pouch which he says are
now extinct.
S COUTS FOR HEALTH: A group of
Nigerian boy scouts has been working
alongside a team of World Health Organiz¬
ation and U.N. Children's Fund health
workers. They took part in a campaign
which has practically wiped out yaws, a
disease which once attacked between 10%
and 20% of the population. During a
smallpox vaccination drive the scouts
checked on 140,000 people, 86% of
whom were vaccinated.
SiJEA-BED ARCHAEOLOGISTS: Divers
working with archxologists have been
making exciting discoveries around the
coasts of Finland. Wrecks of historical
interest have been charted, including a
ship dating back to the 16th or 17th
century in a perfect state of preservation.
The work has been done by members of
a Finnish organization affiliated to the
World Underwater Federation. This inter¬
national body, grouping 29 nations, aims
to protect submarine archaeological sites
of historic and scientific importance.
M.. OBILE EDUCATION TEAMS: Four
mobile Unesco teams composed of three
educators and a woman specialist in home
economics, hygiene, and mother and child
care (supplied by the U. N. Children's
Fund), have been travelling through seven
Congo provinces, giving refresher teacher
training courses. An average of 100 to
120 teachers has been attending each
course. A fifth team in Leopoldville is
supplying the roving teams with audio¬
visual teaching materials and textbooks.
It is hoped to extend this operation
throughout the Congo's 21 provinces.
GirUIDEBOOK FOR INTERNATIONAL
UNDERSTANDING: To help Australia's
teachers over the problems of a relatively
new subject in the curriculum education
for international understanding the Aus¬
tralian National Advisory Committee for
Unesco has recently issued a newly revised
and expanded guidebook to the subject.
This manual proposes different classroom
approaches to such subjects as the meaning
of race and nuclear energy, and presents
bibliographies and quizzes.
Protecting night fliers: To
prevent night-flying migrant birds from
being dazzled so that they- collide with the
Empire State Building in New York, the
all-night beacon at the top of the 102-
storey skyscraper was blacked out from
April 9 until June 1.
NATURE'S WONDERS: "Harmonies
Universelles", a magnificently-illustrated
two-volume work, recently published
under the patronage of the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature,
opens a window on the infinite aspects
and beauties of nature. For further
information and to order, write M. Francis

A. ID FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS:
Young people from Norway, Sweden, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Austria,
the United Kingdom, France, the Nether¬
lands, among other countries, have
volunteered to rebuild the Iranian village
of Dusaj, destroyed by last year's devastat¬
ing earthquake. The project is being
carried out in co-operation with youth and
voluntary work camp organizations,
including Service Civil International.
F/ashes
Thirty-eight million people suffering
from the crippling disease of yaws were
treated with penicillin during internation¬
ally-aided campaigns carried out between
1950 and 1962, reports the World Health
Organization. In campaign areas active
cases dropped from between 10% and
20% a decade ago to about 0.5% by the
end of 1962.
Out of 40,500 persons who lost their
lives on U.S. highways last year (a 7%
increase on 1961), 32,300 died in accidents
caused by driver error and traffic law
violations.
Soviet scientists are planning to raise
wind power stations by balloon or airship
to the tropopause a thin layer of the
atmosphere about 6 or 7 miles above the
earth's surface to make use of regular
windspeeds between 1,000 and 2,000 times
greater than those of atmospheric layers
nearer the earth. It is thereby hoped to
produce cheap electricity for rural areas.
At the end of 1952 Unesco had 445
professional staff members at Headquarters
as against 223 officials and experts in the
field. By 1962, the proportion had been
completely reversed: 790 in the field as
against 460 at Headquarters.
Fifteen years ago the annual fish catch
of all western South America was 130,000
tons (1% of the world total). Today, the
waters off Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Chile give six million tons annually. Peru,
with 5.2 million tons is the world's second
greatest fishing power, after Japan with
6.7 million tons.

The Red Cross, which celebrates its centenary this year,
was born of a personal experience. In June 1859, Henry
Dunant, a Swiss citizen who witnessed the battle of
Solferino, was horrified by the suffering of the wounded.
Thereafter he worked for the creation of societies in
each country to succour wounded soldiers. In 1863 an
international conference in Geneva created the Red
Crosstoday a movement of 150 million people. (See
article page 20). This scene from the film, " The Man in
White ", shows Henry Dunant at the siege of Paris in 1870.
