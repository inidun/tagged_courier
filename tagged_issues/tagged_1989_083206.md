Gaudi and Dalí, the art of excess
by Daniel Giralt-Miracle
If the architects of the Pyramids of Giza had bequeathed
to us the sketches, rough drafts and plans which they
made as their ideas were gradually transformed into
stone, they would perhaps have provided us with keys for
understanding the innermost workings of Egyptian
society five thousand years ago.
But these precious records have disappeared, like the
early drafts of many writers and composers, and the
preliminary sketches of many painters and sculptors,
effacing all trace of the doubts, hesitations, and tensions
which can help us to feel the pulse of life at a given time
and place.
Even when such traces have survived, they have
often been inaccessible, neglected, or misinterpreted.
Today, however, they are increasingly prized as precious
evidence by scholars who are following in the creative
footsteps of modern writers and retracing the
development of works of literature from the author's
initial idea to the completion of the published text and
its reception by critics. This return to the original
sources coupled with a determination to preserve the
fragile heritage of modern manuscripts has given rise to
a new branch of study called manuscriptology.
The purpose of manuscriptology, which might be
described as textual archaeology, is to establish fully
authentic texts of works of literature and to respect the
intentions of their authors and the cultural memory of
the group to which they belong. The publication of
rigorously documented critical editions is the
culmination of this process. One recent initiative in this
field is an international co-publication project, described
in this issue by Amos Segala, which has led to the
creation of the "Archives Collection", a series of critical
editions of literary works by 20th-century Latin
American, Caribbean and eventually African writers.
It is sometimes said that such research is an
encroachment on authors' privacy and that the act of
creation should be inviolable. However, this issue of the
Unesco Courier ¿5 not so much a contribution to the
lively debate that has arisen around this question as an
attempt to show how modern scholarship and technology
are using original manuscripts to throw light on the
complex gestation of works of modern literature.

### 83186: The Written word...
THE WRITTEN WORD..
BY LEOPOLD SEDAR SENGHOR
THE fire which destroyed the
Library of Alexandria is often
cited as one of the natural catas¬
trophes which have afflicted humanity.
Many other fires have impoverished for
all time the memory of mankind. They
are mentioned less often, but we who
have suffered their effects at first hand
know that these irreparable losses have
been instrumental in permanently distort¬
ing the contribution of our peoples to
universal civilization.
Today our identity and our heritage
are faced with the threat of a form of des¬
truction which may be less spectacular
but is quite as pernicious and is taking
place more insidiously. So insidiously, in
fact, that the international cultural com¬
munity does not yet seem fully aware of
it and ready to take action. This form of
destruction, which is jeopardizing the
safeguard of the written heritage of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, today
not only concerns the developing coun¬
tries; it has become a serious and urgent
global problem. The fragility of the
material on which manuscripts are writ¬
ten, the inadequacy of the resources allo¬
cated to national libraries, legal loopholes
and the lack of facilities for training
specialists, are all misfortunes which are
shared, albeit unequally, by all countries
and institutions.
It is to the credit of a non¬
governmental organization entitled "As¬
sociation Archives de la Littérature
Latino-Américaine, des Caraïbes et Afri¬
caine du XXe Siècle" (ALLCA, the La¬
tin American, Caribbean and African
20th-century Literary Archives Associa¬
tion), of which I was president for ten
years, that it has tried to make Unesco
member states aware of the need for con¬
certed action in this field, on a par with
the measures they have already taken to
save other aspects of the cultural heritage
of humanity such as monuments, mov¬
ing images and oral traditions. Initially
such measures should be taken by in¬
dividual countries, but they cannot be
limited to the national level.
To preserve the testimony of creative
thinkers and to render their manuscripts
accessible to international research is an act
of profound civic importance whereby we
affirm our identity and maintain the life
and continuity of our cultural heritage. The
cultural heritage is not a dusty monument,
a souvenir of the past restricted to a scho¬
larly élite, but the focus of a form of
"ancestor-worship" which vitalizes and
enriches later generations.
LEOPOLD SEDAR SENGHOR, Senegalese
statesman and writer, was president of the Repub¬
lic of Senegal from 1960 to 1981. The author of
many poems, essays and other literary works, he
has been a member of the Académie Française since
1983. As former president of the "Association Ar¬
chives de la Littérature Latino-Américaine, des
Caraïbes et Africaine du XXe Siècle" (ALLCA), he
has a special interest in the safeguard and study of
contemporary manuscripts.

...A FRAGILE HERITAGE

BY JUAN CARLOS LANGLOIS
UNPARALLELED "producers"
and "consumers" of manu¬
scripts, the nineteenth and twen¬
tieth centuries witnessed an explosion in
writing and literary creation.
The mass of notebooks, jottings,
sketches and musical scores that their cre¬
ators have bequeathed to us are a heritage
of extraordinary diversity. They testify
to an age of intense intellectual activity
and creative expression which shaped the
modern outlook and will leave a mark on
the people of the twenty-first century and
beyond.
Systematic study of original manu¬
scripts has enriched our understanding of
contemporary literature. It enables
specialists to trace the creative process
by making a kind of X-ray of an author's
activity.
Unfortunately there is a risk that
most of these documents may have less
chance of survival than older manu¬
scripts. They are endangered on many
counts. To take one example, since the
middle of the last century wood pulp has
been the main material used in the
manufacture of paper. The end product
yellows, becomes brittle and deteriorates,
and the life of contemporary manuscripts
is today reckoned at between thirty and
fifty years. The use of carbon paper and
photosensitive material makes preserva¬
tion even more difficult.
Some inks contain acid products
which attack paper; others are too solu¬
ble and are diluted by humidity. New
types of pens and pencils are inimical to
certain preservation techniques.
The effects of air pollution in the big
cities where museums, libraries and
archives are concentrated, compound the
traditional threats caused by inappropri¬
ate lighting, damp and adverse tempera¬
ture conditions. With the growth of literary
and historical research, manuscripts are
more widely consulted. This poses an
additional preservation problem.
Several international meetings have
been held to examine this problem,
notably a symposium on the safeguard of
the written heritage of the twentieth
century organized at Unesco's request by
a non-governmental organization,
ALLCA, which was held in Paris in Sep¬
tember 1987 and attended by specialists
from twenty-one countries. These meet
ings have concluded that this priceless
heritage is threatened all over the world
and have recommended that urgent meas¬
ures be taken.
It has emerged from these meetings
that the systematic drawing up of inven¬
tories is one preliminary step to action
at national or international level. Such in¬
ventories would make it possible to iden¬
tify and locate manuscripts whose
safeguard should be given high priority.
An assessment should be made of their
state of preservation and of the measures
most needed to protect them. At the same
time, the specialized facilities available
should be listed.
Such initiatives should bring home to
the international community that its ac¬
tive co-operation in this field is needed
before the end of the century. Various
forms of action could be envisaged, such
as the launching of safeguard campaigns,
the exchange of information, the
strengthening of infrastructures at nation¬
al and international level, the standardi¬
zation of cataloguing methods, the use of
micro-reproduction techniques and the
establishment of an international system
of exchange of reproductions thus
produced.
No specific international resolution
has so far been adopted for the preserva¬
tion of contemporary manuscripts, and
experts have concluded that suitable in¬
struments for their protection must be
drawn up as soon as possible.
Thus the preservation of contemporary
manuscripts can become an important field
of international cultural co-operation. It
would be paradoxical if our generation
cannot protect a precious heritage which is
common to all cultures and is the basis of
the historical memory.

was for several years director of Unesco's Interna¬
tional Fund for the Promotion of Culture. He is
currently serving on the editorial committee of the

### 83188: Libraries to the rescue
LIBRARIES TO
MANUSCRIPTS are unique and
fragile things, which are still far
from being protected as part of
the national heritage, despite the fact that
they are the focus of widespread interest.
Although their importance may be ac¬
knowledged, the resources allocated to
safeguard them are in many cases slender.
And yet collections of manuscripts are
surely just as much a part of any nation¬
al heritage as the monuments which states
pay large sums of money to preserve, as
the works of art amassed by museums,
and the areas of outstanding natural beau¬
ty which are protected by their status as
national parks.
Seeing the creative impulse
at work
The literary, scientific, social or po¬
litical history of a people can only be
written objectively if it is based on the
original sources, and those sources are
manuscripts or archival documents. In¬
deed, one meaning of the word "source"
is precisely that of "original document".
Manuscripts are the lifeblood of history.
In them it is possible to trace the develop¬
ment of writers and their work, the lives
of statesmen, the manifold activities of
peoples. Their value is impossible to cal¬
culate, and even if it is perceived as rela¬
tively slight in the world context, within
each culture and each country it is
absolute.
National libraries have long under¬
stood the importance of this heritage, es¬
pecially since manuscripts constitute
natural additions to their holdings and
form part of their mission to acquire,
preserve and provide access to printed
works. Although not all national libraries
possess a manuscripts department as such,
most wish to acquire private archives and
to safeguard them as far as their means
permit.
Such collections enable those engaged
in literary research to consult in one place
the documentation on a writer, ranging
from drafts and manuscripts to printed
editions of his or her work, as well as
reviews in newspapers and magazines, ra-

This late 2nd-century manuscript of the Book
of Isaiah (detail above) is one of the famous
Dead Sea Scrolls. With several other
remarkable biblical manuscripts, it was
dio and television interviews, records, let¬
ters, notes of all kindsin order to follow
the evolution of a work or its creator, and
to see the creative impulse at work. These
primary sources are particularly in¬
dispensable because only they are entire¬
ly reliable, since secondary sources are
too often marred by errors which are
then repeated and multiplied from one
edition to the next. The French political
philosopher Montesquieu wrote in his
Lettres persanes (Persian Letters, 1722) : "I
have a little room full of very precious
and very dear manuscripts; although I
ruin my eyesight reading them, I much
prefer to use these rather than printed
works, which are less reliable...". Final¬
ly, the existence of complete collections
of manuscripts makes possible the prepa¬
ration of critical editions and the discov¬
ery of unpublished material.

Faced with such confusion, a second
question springs to mind: what role can
and should be played by national
libraries? From the legislation which
created them and from the nature of their
mission, it is clear that these institutions
enjoy a stability and permanence that,
theoretically, guarantee the sound
management of the heritage of printed
works entrusted to them. However, na¬
tional libraries, like other institutions, are
at the mercy of the fluctuations of the
economy. But conservation remains their
primary purpose and is generally en¬
shrined in the legal provisions of their
mandate. This is why budget cuts or staff
reductions have less impact on conserva¬
tion policies than on other library
activities.
The task of conservation necessarily
leads national libraries to hire highly
qualified staff and acquire highly special¬
ized equipment to ensure that their col¬
lections will withstand the ravages of
time. Their activities include rigorous
control of atmospheric conditions, the
deacidification of books and documents
and of their containers, the reproduction
in facsimile or on microfilm or
microfiche of those which are at most
risk of deteriorating, and the elimination
of external threats.

Qumran, on the site of a monastery destroyed

The role of national libraries
The importance of public archives
has long been widely taken for granted.
If we accept that private archives are
equally deserving of preservation, then a
fundamental question arises: who should
be responsible for preserving them? So
far, few countries have come up with a
very satisfactory solution to this problem,
as indicated by the number of manuscript
collections that are still dispersed. Regret¬
tably, conflicts even arise between nation¬
al archives and national libraries,
university libraries and public libraries,
and the private libraries of foundations
and associations.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
As well as taking these costly and es¬
sential measures, national libraries must
acquire manuscripts to complement their
collections of printed works. It is small
wonder, therefore, that they have always
taken a keen interest in the development
of manuscript collections, even setting up
special departments for the purpose. This
trend was, and still is, part of the logical
evolution of their responsibilities, a path
from which they cannot stray without
detrimental consequences both at the na¬
tional level and worldwide.
This does not necessarily mean cen¬
tralization at all costs. Modern technolo¬
gy provides long distance and virtually
instantaneous access to the reproduction
of a document and to information relat¬
ing to it. Data banks that can be consult¬
ed at any time have become part of daily
life, as has the transmission of images or
texts. This new technology should allow
national libraries to accept an even greater
measure of responsibility for
manuscripts, since their primary aim is
to encourage consultation and even co¬
ordination among depositories of private
archives. They should act as advisers to
other libraries and provide technical and
financial support where necessary, so that
the national collection of manuscripts,
even if dispersed around a country, may
be preserved in the best possible condi¬
tions, and be well catalogued and univer¬
sally accessible.
Through their direct or indirect con¬
nections with the government, to which
they are largely accountable, national

libraries should also try to make the
authorities aware of the value of the writ¬
ten heritage, and induce them to adopt
appropriate legislation and regulations.
Much still remains to be done in this
direction, if only in the form of tax con¬
cessions granted by several countries to
donors, legatees or even sellers of
manuscripts.
A universal heritage
Bodies such as the International Fed¬
eration of Library Associations and Insti¬
tutions (IFLA) cannot, for their part,
abdicate responsibility for national collec¬
tions of manuscripts, which are all too
often threatened. Like areas of outstand
ing natural beauty, these collections
represent riches that all humanity has a
duty to preserve; together, they consti¬
tute a world heritage on whose behalf
Unesco and its member states should
adopt the measures that are urgently
needed.
Manuscripts should be recognized
forthwith as part of our universal
heritage, and countries should sign a
declaration undertaking to provide the
legislative, financial, human and techni¬
cal support necessary for their preserva
tion. Each national library should
establish its priorities and defend them in
its relations with governments and inter¬
national organizations.

### 83190: Microwaves that save manuscripts
MICROWAVES THAT SAVE
MANUSCRIPTS
BY DENIS SERGENT
DEACIDIFICATION of manu¬
scripts, books and archival docu¬
ments is necessary today for two
main reasons: the inferior quality of cer¬
tain types of modern cellulose-based
papers (dating from the second half of the
nineteenth century); and atmospheric
pollution. Paper was formerly manufac¬
tured from textile fibres (linen, hemp or
cotton) obtained from rags. Since 1850,
cellulose fibres from broadleaf and
coniferous trees have been used. The
wood pulp is produced either by chemi¬
cal or mechanical methods. Chemical
pulp is of good quality, but paper made
from mechanical pulp acidifies, especial¬
ly when treated with sizing agents such
as alum. This type of paper, used for
newspapers or paperbacks, turns yellow,
hardens, becomes brittle and finally
disintegrates, a process that is aggravated
by atmospheric pollution.
A method of deacidifying paper, dis¬
covered by an American and tested in
Canada, has been adapted and improved
at the French research centre for the
preservation of illustrated documents in
Paris, resulting in the design of the first
assembly-line deacidifying plant in
Europe. In 1988 a prototype was installed
in the French Bibliothèque Nationalen
preservation centre at Sablé-sur-Sarthe.
The main advantages of this appara¬
tus are that whole books can be treated
and it is no longer necessary to take a
book apart and soak the pages one by one
in the treatment solution. Several books
or documents can be treated at a time (as
many as 250 a day).
The bound books are vacuum dried
and heated, and the acid is then eliminat¬
ed by soaking them in a basic alcohol
solution. Subjected to a pressure of 4 bars,
this solution penetrates all the pages.
In any attempt to preserve paper in¬
volving deacidification in an aqueous
medium or strengthening by thermal
sizing, or to restore flood-damaged paper,
problems arise when it comes to the
drying process. The paper is either dried
in the open air on racks, or by means of
traditional heating devices which are not
really suitable (hot air blowers, heated
plates or rollers, or infrared radiation).
But these methods toughen the cellulose
fibres and thus partially cancel out the
effect of the previous treatment.
J
Traditional heating devices work by
conduction, convection or radiation.
Water is evaporated by purely thermal
effects which act indiscriminately on the
water and on the paper. For rapid dry¬
ing (a few minutes), the wet paper has to
be heated quite fiercely, and the thermal
energy may alter the mechanical proper¬
ties of the paper or even burn it.
The electrical energy of microwaves,
on the other hand, acts selectively on the
molecules of "free" water that have not
seeped into the paper. It is thus possible
to eliminate the water without unduly
raising the average temperature of the
paper and without extracting its constitu¬
tional water (sometimes known as residu¬
al moisture). There is then no danger of
destroying a document through drier
malfunction or operator error.
By using microwaves it is possible to
dry both old and modern paper while
preserving its chemical and physical qual¬
ities, and in particular its mechanical
resistance to stretching and tearing. The
drying is homogeneous, so that no "hot
spots" are created, and it takes place at
a low temperature (30° C to 43° C). The
drier can be adapted to the dimensions of
the material to be treated. During treat¬
ment, paper flow can be regulated (from
a few sheets to 10-20 sheets per minute),
and the belt on which the paper is spread
can be run with a backwards and for-

### 83191: France's Bibliothèque nationale: a library in action
FRANCE'S BIBLIOTHÈQUE NATIONALE
A LIBRARY IN ACTION BY FLORENCE CALLU
M*'-
FROM the time when Charles V,
king of France from 1364-1380, as¬
sembled a thousand manuscripts in
his library at the Louvre, French monarchs
dreamed of building up an encyclopaedic
library as witness to the culture of their
times. Collectors of books and patrons of
the arts have shared this concern and
amassed treasures which, whether or not
they ended up in the royal library, are part
of the heritage of France.
The descendant of the first royal
library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris
has a prestigious collection of manuscripts
which it is dedicated to enrich and preserve.
Outstanding collections of
modern manuscripts
Through an active acquisitions policy,
the Bibliothèque Nationale seeks to com¬
plete its existing holdings when the occa¬
sion arises, and to build up new collections
through donations, purchases and gifts
received in lieu of payments to the state.
Gifts or bequests made by writers or
their families, or by collectors, are a very
important source of manuscript acquisi¬
tions. Exceptional bodies of work by
nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers
have been added to the collection in this
way, including manuscripts by Victor
Hugo, Flaubert, Zola, Apollinaire, Barres,
Anna de Noailles, Romain Rolland, Roger
Martin du Gard, Jules Romains and Miguel
Angel Asturias.

paper and pasted them over earlier drafts. The layers of paper have been separated and stored in
muslin envelopes at the Bibliothèque Nationale'; restoration workshop, so that the changing text

The main difficulty as far as purchases
are concerned is that forward planning is
rarely possible. In most cases documents
suddenly appear on the market at an auc¬
tion. If the pre-sale estimated price of a
manuscript is high, beyond the library's or¬
dinary budget, there is little time to obtain
extra funds. The Bibliothèque Nationale
was very fortunate in 1988, when special
funding from the Ministry of Culture and
Communication made possible the acqui¬
sition of the precious manuscript of Mon
coeur mis à nu by Baudelaire, Apollinaire's
poems Alcools, and a collection of poetry
by Verlaine.
The Bibliothèque Nationale has the
right to pre-empt a document offered at
public auction at the price paid for it by
the highest bidder (without itself taking
part in the bidding). Moreover, before a
manuscript can be taken out of the coun¬
try an export licence must be applied for
and submitted to the library for agreement.
If the library is interested, it can order the
work to be held by the customs and buy
it at its declared price. A microfilm copy

of the manuscript must be made in any
case before it leaves the country.
Among the great collections of con¬
temporary manuscripts bought since the
1960s are the papers of Proust, Valéry,
Claudel, Bernanos, Colette and Sartre.
In 1968 a law concerning donations to
the state in lieu of death duties provided
an additional safeguard to the French liter¬
ary heritage. Under this law, the heirs to
objets d'art may, after having them valued,
take them before a legal commission which
makes a ruling. Valuable additions to the
Proust and Martin du Gard collections
were acquired under this procedure.
In the strict sense, conservation of col¬
lections consists in keeping them in good
condition in surroundings where complete
security and freedom from pollution are
guaranteed.

todian of a valuable and fragile heritage,
brought together by the kings of France,
enriched with Church property confiscat¬
ed during the Revolution and by gifts and
purchases of quality made in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. Vigilant manage¬
ment is necessary in order to carry on a
tradition which has remained unbroken for
over five centuries.
FLORENCE CALLU, of France, is director of the
Department of Manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Na¬
tionale, Paris. She has published many articles and
essays on the preservation of manuscripts.
New techniques for
conservation and safeguard
Two basic problems arise in relation
to the manuscripts themselves their bind¬
ings and the surface on which they are
written or printed. Damaged bindings are
repaired by the Central Restoration Work¬
shop at the Bibliothèque Nationale. The
most valuable are placed in ventilated can¬
vas boxes, thus avoiding contact with the
shelves. Parchments, which are very resis¬
tant to wear, pose few problems, nor does
paper manufactured before the mid
nineteenth century. But paper made after
that date is at risk from a process of acidifi¬
cation and requires the use of recently de¬
veloped techniques to halt the damage (see
page 9).
These preservation techniques are
backed up by protective legislation passed
by the French government in 1977. Provid¬
ing access to information is one of the vo¬
cations of the Bibliothèque Nationale, but
a policy of accessibility to original
manuscripts, which would be seriously
damaged by too frequent handling, has to
be reconciled with conservation policy. A
special photographic workshop was opened
in 1983 in the Department of Manuscripts,
in which certain documents can be record¬
ed systematically on microfilm. These are
chosen on the basis of exceptional quality,
and the amount of use to which they are
subject. Microfilms, in monochrome for
text and in colour for illuminated
manuscripts, are gradually replacing the
originals for consultation purposes, and
readers are available in the microfilm
room opened in 1985.

FROM THE WORLD'S ARCHIVES
The Vatican Library
THE Secret Archives of the Vatican (so
named because of the practice where¬
by the archives of sixteenth-century
European sovereigns were usually described
as "secret") are by virtue of their universal
nature, a documentary source of exception¬
al interest not only for religious and political
history but also for the social and cultural de¬
velopment of many nations. In 1880 they
were opened to the public, without distinc¬
tion of nationality or religious persuasion, by
Pope Leo XIII, and since then they have been
used by scholars from all over the world. Each
day some eighty researchers study in the Ar¬
chives, while some 120 more use the Vati¬
can Library.
The documents in the Vatican Archives
originate from the bishops, priests, monks
and laymen and women of local churches,
and from the nunciatures of the Holy See.
They contain ecclesiastical, historical, social,
cultural, economic and political information.
Also in the Vatican Archives are the records

The Soviet Union,
a scattered heritage
RICH holdings of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century literary manuscripts
are preserved in the great libraries and
research institutes of the USSR Academy of
Sciences such as the Institute of Literature
(Pushkin House) in Leningrad and the Insti¬
tute of World Literature in Moscow. The Cen¬
tral State Archives of Literature and Art
specialize in preservation work.
But facilities for the preservation and use
of twentieth-century literary manuscripts
leave much to be desired. Holdings cannot
be efficiently consulted because they are not
computerized. And in most cases the basic
conditions for preservation do not exist.
Attempts to constitute the literary ar¬
chives of Soviet authors are confronted with
many obstacles. The manuscripts of great
writers who were victims of Stalinist oppres¬
sion were either destroyed or have been lost
without trace. As a result of emigration, es¬
pecially during the Civil War, the Soviet Un¬
ion lost many of its leading creative artists and
their manuscripts are today scattered all over
the world, notably in the United States.
A comprehensive history of twentieth-
century Russian literature is being prepared

The safeguard of manuscripts
in Africa
THE art of the manuscript has been prac¬
tised for several centuries in Ethiopia, in
the Maghreb, in Muslim Black Africa
and in southeastern Madagascar. But only
relatively recently, during the period of Eu¬
ropean colonization, did written records be¬
gin to be kept throughout the continent.
Today manuscript archives are found in all
African countries. Some Ethiopian gospel-
books and other illuminated manuscripts
written in Amharic and Geez (right) and cer¬
tain Arabic manuscripts from the Maghreb,
date as far back as the fourteenth century,
but most of the remainder are contemporary
or recent.
In spite of a growing awareness of the
incalculable value of these manuscripts, few
effective measures have been taken to
safeguard and preserve them. The situation
is in many ways disturbing because complete
and systematic inventories have not been es¬
tablished at the national level, because of the
slender resources of institutions in which
manuscripts and documentary sources are
kept, and because of lack of personnel
specializing in the analysis, treatment and
preservation of manuscripts.

African manuscripts are housed in a var¬
iety of institutions ranging from libraries,
research centres, archives services and pub¬
lishing houses, to Ethiopian churches and
monasteries, and mosques and Koranic
schools in the Maghreb, Mauritania and
Senegal. Many documents are in private
hands. Writers and their families usually keep
the manuscripts of their published works. Not
only should the institutions where
manuscripts are preserved be provided with
adequate facilities; other holders of these cul¬
tural treasures should be identified.

cases, courses on the restoration and preser¬

schools are excessively theoretical and the

tury both in the USSR and elsewhere. Where
the manuscripts of works written outside the
USSR are concerned, the gaps are very seri¬
ous. If this project is to be brought to a suc¬
cessful conclusion, scholars engaged on it
must at least be able to consult copies of
manuscripts by these writers who produced
their work outside the Soviet Union and use
them as a basis for research and future criti¬
cal editions.
The ideal solution would be to provide
for the exchange of copies of manuscripts be¬

countries. A comprehensive agreement on
this point is needed to provide for mutual as¬
sistance in the collection, preservation, study
and possible publication of literary
manuscripts. Such an agreement should con¬
cern the manuscripts of all authors in all
countries. The Central State Archives of Liter¬
ature and Art, the repository of the most im¬

to work towards this goal.

India: a new conservation policy
In contemporary India literary manuscripts
are usually destroyed after publication, and
authors rarely keep their manuscripts and
other material related to their work. (One
notable exception was the Bengali poet
Rabindranath Tagore, whose manuscripts are
preserved at Visva-Bharati University.)
Recently, however, India's National Academy
of Letters (Sahitya Akademi) has adopted an
acquisitions and conservation policy for
contemporary literary documents, and the
state has granted financial assistance to
libraries for the preservation of rare
manuscripts in their keeping. Below, reading

### 83193: The Quest for authenticity
THE QUEST FOR AUTHENTICITY
DURING the past few years, there
has been a heightening of interest
in the question of textual authen¬
ticity, a question to which little attention
had been paid previously except by phi¬
lologists, who studied only classical,
medieval and Renaissance texts. Such
scholars believed that contemporary texts
lacked the value and distinction which an¬
cient documents possess because they be¬
long to a recognized literary tradition.
The writer betrayed
Most readers were indifferent to the
question of authenticity, and cared little
whether the novel, poem or essay they
were reading corresponded exactly to
what the author had written and intend¬
ed to publish. And almost invariably the
published text not only did not represent
the author's intention, but altered and oc¬
casionally even betrayed it. In the past,
it was easy to blame a scatterbrained cop¬
yist or compositor, or the interference of
a censor. It was up to the philologist to
restore the text to its original form, or at
least produce a version as close as possi¬
ble to the presumed intention of the
author. This task consisted in detecting
and eliminating the interferences, addi¬
tions and alterations to which these texts
had been subjected for centuries due to
faulty transmission and inaccurate trans¬
lations and interpretations.
In the case of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century literature, scholarly in¬
difference and threats to freedom of
speech and opinion have introduced more
distortions into original texts than those
inflicted on medieval works. Ideological
intolerance, overt or concealed censor¬
ship by writers and editors, the disappear¬
ance or wanton destruction of
manuscripts and rough drafts
occasionally even their acquisition by
booklovers who jealously hoard them
piracy or the publication of works
without the author's control, have often
altered the conditions in which these
works were conceived, written, transmit¬
ted and published.
Readers and scholars have now
changed their attitude. Some have under¬
stood the importance of the integrity of
literary works and increasingly demand
accurate editions endorsed by informed

criticism. Othersfrom the outset or af¬
ter a life dedicated to the laborious recon¬
stitution of texts ravaged by timehave
discovered the satisfaction of working on
texts for which, in most cases, the process
of elaboration from the first draft to the
final version can be reconstituted.
The establishment of real or pre¬
sumed authenticity is of fundamental im¬
portance. A civilization like ours, based
essentially on books, that is on the writ¬
ten word, requires a text to reflect,
without excessive distortion or deforma¬
tion, all the conventions of the social con¬
tract, the ideologies, the cultural
traditions, the very structure of society.
Law books and holy scriptures, classical
and contemporary literature, historical
documents and music scores, must all be
error-free if clear and precise norms are
to be set and the legacy of which we are
the beneficiaries and the guardians is to
be preserved intact.
The text transformed between
1st draft and final proofs
There is a big difference between con¬
temporary literary texts and those of the
past. In the case of the latter, manuscripts
and printed versions rarely correspond to
what the author wished to say, because
they were copied or printed without his
control, often long after they had been
written. In the case of the former, one or
several versions usually exist, all original,
corresponding to different stages in the

For want of a horse
The pre-text consists of everything
that goes into the creation of a work of
literature, everything that reflects the
writer's imagination and vision. This
complex and ever-changing pattern of ele¬
ments abandoned and retrieved, of frag-

Puccini (1858-1924),

composition of the text.
This difference reveals one charac¬
teristic of a work of literature which has
been hitherto ignored or neglected.
Manuscripts which show how many
transformations it undergoes while it is
being created indicate that a work of liter¬
ature is never one-dimensional and is
something more than the current edition
or even the fair copy that the writer
delivers to the printer. On the contrary,
every work of literature has several
dimensions. It takes shape slowly, some¬
times very slowly, as a result of a series
of transformations and variations which
form what might be called the "pre¬
text" all the textual material and docu¬
ments, from the first draft to the proofs
corrected by the author, and subsequent
editions where further changes occurred.
IV-
ments of writing covered with later
additions or abridged to the point of ob¬
scurity, of dissected and reassembled state¬
ments, of passages which themselves do
not change but whose meaning changes
as they are moved around, is a source of
valuable information. It is possible to find
in the pre-text not only clarification of
the published work, but also the mechan¬
isms of its creation. A reading of the
rough drafts allows us to verify, for ex¬
ample, the extent to which the author's
modifications of a work can be useful for
its interpretation, and how well they har¬
monize with or modify its context and
in which sense.

The first stanza of Alfred de Musset's
poem Venise, which originally read Dans
Venise la rouge /pas un cheval qui bouge
/pas un pêcheur dans l'eau /pas un falot
("In Venice the red / nary a horse was
moving / nor a fisherman in the water
/ nor a lantern") was modified by the
poet who, perhaps realizing that horses
are not to be seen in Venice, replaced
"horse" by "boat" (nary a boat was mov¬
ing). In so doing, as a modern critic has
pointed out, "he substituted an incoher¬
ent image for a coherent one which
opened the poem with a synthesis deve¬
loped in the following stanzas", and this
substitution "eliminates the contrast of

body of original material and making a
chronological classification of the
author's alterations to the text through
the analysis of paper, ink, pens and hand¬
writing. The methods and techniques of
this procedure have given rise to a new
discipline: manuscriptology.
These operations are often so com¬
plex that they are beyond the capacities
of a single person, and most critical edi¬
tions of contemporary literary
manuscripts are the work of teams which
almost invariably use computers to help
them perform a task which nevertheless
takes several years. Cases of this kind in¬
clude the Corpus Flaubertianum on which
Giovanni Bonaccorso and his collabora¬
tors are currently working; the drafts of
Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps
perdu (Remembrance ofThings Past) which
a team of scholars at the Institute of
Modern Texts and Manuscripts at the
French National Centre for Scientific
Research has been studying for several
years; James Joyce's Ulysses; Franz Kaf¬
ka's Schriften, Tagebücher, Briefe ("Writ¬
ings, Diaries and Letters") in addition to

troys the totalizing function of the first

A service to the reader
Of course, if all variants are signifi¬
cant, they do not all necessarily modify
only a short segment of text, as in the case
of de Musset's boat. The alterations may
involve entire sentences, even paragraphs
or chapters. Sometimes, the minor vari¬
ants, in addition to the modifications that
each one independently introduces in the
text, may be so numerous that they re¬
quire, no less than the major variants, sus¬
tained and constant attention. A modern
edition of a literary work cannot ignore
this textual mobility. Manuscripts, rough
portunity to grasp its dynamism. In the
case of censored or self-censored texts, a
return to the pre-text usually makes it
possible to establish the authentic word¬
ing through the identification and elimi¬
nation of superfluous additions and the
re-establishment of fragments of text
banished by the censor's blue pencil.
The new science
of manuscriptology
The first problem raised by rough
drafts is that of decipherment. A glance
at the manuscript of Gustave Flaubert's
story Un Coeur Simple is enough to show
that decipherment is not alwayi easy. A
second problem, in this case of a strati-
graphic nature, is that of retracing the his¬
tory of the text by taking the complex
The tribulations of Ulysses
It required seven years of work to
produce the critical edition of Ulysses and
correct the 5,000 errors of the current edi¬
tion, which reproduces the very corrupt
text of the eighth edition (1960). The mis¬
fortune which has pursued this text since
the first edition of 1922 is not unusual in
the history of printing. Joyce's complaint
in a letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver"I
am extremely irritated by all those
printer's errors ... Are these to be per¬
petuated in future editions? I hope
not."is of a kind frequently found in
writers' correspondence, even with seem¬
ingly less justification, such as matters of
punctuation, which is more often subject
to the house style of printers, rather than
the author's wishes. Thus, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau wrote on 17 June 1758 to Marc-

Michel Rey, with regard to his Lettre à
d'Alembert sur les spectacles: "there are
however suspension points added after
certain words on pages 27 and 48. I un¬
derstand why they have been put there,
especially the last ones, but I don't like
them, and would ask you not to do so
again, unless found in the copy. I also find
too many commas. Different divisions
within the same sentence should not be
marked by the same punctuation. It com¬
pletely obstructs the meaning"2.
These examples reveal how persis¬
tent authors can be in their quest for the
ideal printing which entirely respects
their stylistic requirement. This ideal to¬
day's critical editions aspire to achieve.
They also illustrate the value of writers'
private correspondence for re-establishing
the authentic textual order wished by
them.
Authentic scores
ofgreat operas
It is obvious that the problem of re¬
establishing the authenticity of a text is
not limited to literature, but concerns all
creative works, including music scores.
For the past thirty years, original scores
(or at least transcriptions controlled
directly by the author) have been reco¬
vered and critical editions prepared by
research teams working directly on the
manuscript sources and first editions, in
order to locate alterations and additions
introduced by the transcribers and the
performers, to eliminate them and to
bring the text back to its original form.
This tremendous undertaking has begun
to bear fruit. Critical editions of // Bar¬
biere di Siviglia, Cenerentola, La Gazza
ladra, L'ltaliana in Algeri, Tancredi, Il Sig-
nor Bruschino, and // Turco in Italia have
recently been published by the Fondazi-
one Rossini at Pesaro, and editions of
Verdi's Rigoletto, Emani and Requiem
Mass have been published by the Institu¬
to di Studi Verdiani at Parma, the Ricor-
di publishing house and the University
of Chicago. A critical edition of Pucci¬
ni's La Boheme and of Bellini's Norma are
in preparation.
Texts restored by musicologists are
usually favourably received by the pub¬
lic and critics. The critical edition of The
Barber ofSeville was performed 192 times
in 1984 and 178 times in 1985, while the
traditional score was only used for 44 and
57 representations respectively. Prefer-

ence is given to the authentic score even
if fairly correct traditional editions are
available.
The question of access
In order to decipher rough drafts and
prepare critical editions, researchers must
clearly have easy access to manuscripts.
It is vital that documentation on writers
(and composers) should be assembled in
special departments of public libraries,
where it can be consulted by manuscrip-
tologists and philologists. The situation
in this respect is far better today than it
was thirty years ago. Collections of
modern manuscripts began to appear at
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
but their proliferation has only taken
place in recent decades, coinciding with
the growing interest in authentic texts.
Foundations have been created to bring
together the manuscripts of writers or
composers. University institutions and
research centres are also taking action,
and most national libraries have created
departments of modern manuscripts,
which are now treated with the care that
was formerly reserved for ancient
manuscripts.

mem of a critical edition led to a com¬
plete reassessment of the work.
We made sure that we had learned all
we could from this initial experiment be¬
fore recommending its extension to the
works of other Latin American writers,
and eventually to the literatures of other
parts of the developing world.
At the World Conference on Cultur¬

Above, the
Guatemalan writer
Miguel Angel Asturias
in 1956. His
manuscripts, which he
donated to France's
Bibliothèque
Nationale, were the
nucleus of the
"Archives Collection"
(see article). The final
page of the
manuscript of his
novel El señor
presidente, right,
shows that the work
was written between
1925 and 1932, and
not around 1945 as
critics once believed.
FIFTEEN years ago, the Guatemalan
writer and poet Miguel Angel
Asturias (1899-1974), winner of the
1967 Nobel Prize for Literature, donat¬
ed his manuscripts and archives to the
Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, so that
they could be preserved there and used
in the preparation of an international edi¬
tion of his work using modern methods
of textual analysis and criticism.
The results have been highly instruc¬
tive. In the first place, despite the ex¬
pressed wish of the author, many of his
manuscripts were not made available to
the Bibliothèque Nationale, and other
documents essential to the understanding
of his work were dispersed and perhaps
lost for ever. Secondly, where documen¬
tation was available, as in the case of the
novels El señor presidente (The President,
1963) and Hombres de maíz (Men ofMaize,
1975), methods of textual analysis have
evolved so radically that the establish-

Senghor called on Unesco member states
to take international action for the preser¬
vation, evaluation and study of twentieth-
century manuscripts. At the time, Mr.
Senghor was president of ALLCA, the
Latin American, Caribbean and African
20th-century Literary Archives Associa¬
tion, which had grown out of the Friends
of Miguel Angel Asturias.
In 1983 and 1984 international meet¬
ings were held in several countries to dis¬
cuss these issues. The gatherings were
organized by the National Centre for
Scientific Research and the Bibliothèque
Nationale in France; by the Consiglio
Nazionale delle Ricerce (CNR) in Italy;
and by the Instituto de Cultura e Lingua
Portuguesa (ICALP) in Portugal.
Specialists in philology, linguistics, histo¬
ry, Latin American literature and com¬
parative literature took part in
interdisciplinary workshops, and a "Mul¬
tilateral Agreement on Archival Research
and Co-Publications" was drafted and
then signed in September 1984 at Buenos
Aires (Argentina) by four European
countriesFrance, Italy, Portugal and
Spainand four Latin American
countriesArgentina, Brazil, Colombia
and Mexico.
An international agreement
The aims of this "Archives Agree¬
ment" are to promote:
philological and linguistic analysis
of texts on the basis of manuscript or
published versions approved by the
author, and the transcription and study
of variants, i.e. the establishment of a
reliable, authentic text and the history of
its creation;
the compilation of dossiers on each
author, his or her writings, and the
problems they raise;
textual and contextual analyses by
critics from the same country or region
as the author or from elsewhere;
the systematic examination of texts
from an international and interdiscipli¬
nary viewpoint; this approach is not in¬
trinsically new but it is innovatory in the
case of the Archives Agreement because
of its scope and long-term nature.
As a result of the Archives Agree¬
ment, a number of literary works began
to be published in a series known as the
Archives Collection (Colección "Archi¬
vos') in several cities of Latin America.
Each year ten or so titles are scheduled
for publication in the Collection. All the
countries of the region and four languages
(Spanish, Portuguese, French, English)
are represented. The project is thus con¬
tributing to the recognition by interna¬
tional scholarship of each country's
classic authors, to a reassessment of the
literary history of Latin America in the
twentieth century, and to the establish¬
ment of a distribution network for
Latin American literature which will
be as wide-ranging as the intellectual,
technical and financial efforts that have
gone into it.
The scientific direction of the Collec¬
tion is in the hands of an international
committee of twenty-seven specialists in
the relevant literary disciplines. ALLCA
also has a publishing committee consist-

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
A recent survey carried out in Latin America
under the auspices of Unesco's International
Fund for the Promotion of Culture concluded
that there was a need for legal instruments
whereby states would preserve contemporary
literary manuscripts as part of their national
heritage and, in a region where many library
personnel are trained in preservation
techniques, for improved technical facilities jn
this field. The survey also suggested that
manuscripts should be made more easily
accessible to scholars. As a response to the
study, Venezuela has passed legislation on the
protection and preservation of manuscripts.

and add new titles to the Collection, tak¬
ing into account the results obtained so
far.
With the publication of 120 titles by
authors from twenty-two countries in the
pipeline, the Archives Collection
represents the cultural and linguistic
wealth and diversity of an entire region.
Its scale and timespan are unprecedented
for a programme of cultural and scientif¬
ic co-operation of this kind.
The Latin American countries which
were or are unused to working together
in this field, and lacked the opportunity
for mutual understanding despite their
common history, have thus embarked on
a long-term sharing of literary experiences
which will bring them closer together.
Another interesting aspect of the Ar¬
chives Agreement is the participation in
it of four European countries which are
profoundly and irreversibly linked to La¬
tin America. The Agreement thus breaks
new ground both in Latin America and
in the Latin countries of Europe, herald¬
ing new forms of international scientific
co-operation and cultural solidarity.
What are the underlying reasons for
this Agreement which mobilizes 500
specialists from a wide range of dis¬
ciplines, eight governments, many insti¬
tutions and considerable resources? The
answer is that Latin American literature,
currently one of the world's richest, is an
extreme example of the isolation and
neglect that in some cases afflict the liter¬
ature of developing countries. The Ar¬
chives Collection is not only an
instructive experience in itself, but a test
case from which other regions can learn.

### 83197: Literary detection and Latin American writing
LITERARY DETECTION
AND LATIN AMERICAN WRITING
IN 1915, at the height of the Mexican
Revolution, the writer Mariano Azuela
published a serial in an obscure
newspaper in El Paso, across the US
frontier in Texas. At the time he was
writing for the paper, El Paso del Norte,
his stories reflected developments in the
Revolution. Some months later he col¬
lected the episodes of the serial and turned
them into a novel, which by 1925 was
recognized as a classic of twentieth-
century Latin American literature under
the title Los de abajo (The Underdogs).
The fate of The Underdogs
The novel went through several edi¬
tions, and by 1983 had sold more than a
million copies, but the text had been
repeatedly changed. Azuela had amend¬
ed and expanded the short original novel
in each of the successive editions pub¬
lished during his lifetime. Only after his
death in 1952 at the age of seventy-nine,
when he was already a famous writer, was
the "definitive" edition of the novel pre¬
pared. It was finally published in 1958.
BY FERNANDO AINSA
Azuela had begun by changing the
verbs in the 1920 edition from the present
to the past tense, altering adjectives, and
correcting punctuation, spelling and syn¬
tax. After Los de abajo became the estab¬
lished "novel of the Mexican revolution",
Azuela decided to rewrite it extensively.
In the 1938 edition he introduced a new
character, Valderrama, who brought a
humorous touch to the austere original
version. He modified his Manichean
representation of the revolutionary gener¬
al, Pancho Villa, and made important
ideological changes in the behaviour of
other characters, such as the cynical Luis
Cervantes. The novel which he had writ¬
ten in the sound and the fury of the Revo¬
lution became a more detached reflection
on Mexican history. Times had changed.
The revolution had become "institution¬
alized" and Mariano Azuela had become
an established author.
Meanwhile, the newspaper in which
Azuela's original text had been published
had disappeared without trace. Surpris¬
ingly, the paper was not registered, even
in the United States, and not a single copy
had been kept. Thus for over sixty years
only the second and third editions of Los
de abajo were known, while a semi-
mythical legend grew up around the lost
first version. Then, thanks to the per¬
severance of an American researcher,
Stanley R. Robe, an incomplete set of El
Paso del Norte was found in a private
collection in 1979.
Only then did most of the original
text of Los de abajo become available,
allowing the comparison and collation of
different editions and the publication of
a critical edition indicating important
changes in the text. Apart from the aca¬
demic interest of such an enterprise, crit¬
ics now had a great opportunity to make
a genealogical study of the text and a com¬
parison of the different versions from a
linguistic and semiotic point of view.
Literary critics and Azuela specialists
jumped at the chance.
The fate of the text of Los de abajo
closely resembles that of other works of
Latin American literature, where all trace
of manuscripts, drafts, or simple annota¬
tions indicating the author's creative
process has been lost. But it is also an
example of the confusion that can arise
when successive editions pick up mis¬
prints or spelling mistakes from a care-

lessly produced first edition, afterwards
reproduced without anyone checking the
originalsomething which is not always
feasible.
A revaluation of César Vallejo
One of the most striking examples of
this process is the work of the Peruvian
poet, César Vallejo, which has had a
chequered fate even though Vallejo is one
of the major figures of Latin American
literature. The two collections of poems
published during his lifetime, Los heral¬
dos negros (1918; "The Black Heralds")
and Trilce (1922), were quickly forgotten.
Reprints and anthologies published after
his premature death in 1938 were full of
inaccuracies. His publishers' use of arbi¬
trary chronologies and indiscriminately-
chosen titles, such as Poemas humanos
(1939; "Human Poems"), has led to his
work coming out in a distorted and frag¬
mentary form.
Moreover, as often happens to
writers whose estates give rise to bitter
dispute among their heirs, the excessive
zeal of Vallejo's widow resulted in most
of the poet's output remaining unpub¬
lished for thirty years. Only in 1968,
when Vallejo's fame was established
beyond doubt, did his widow agree to the
publication of this body of work. Once
again an arbitrary chronology and title
were usedPoemas en prosa ("Prose
Poems"). As if this were not enough,
other typescripts and manuscript origi¬
nals in her possession disappeared mys¬
teriously after her death in 1984. But the
saga of Vallejo's work did not end there.
Some years ago, the first edition of the
poems inspired by the Spanish Civil War,
España, aparta de mí este cáliz ("Spain,
take away this cup from me"), which was
thought to have been lost at the time of
the Republican defeat in 1939, was
discovered hidden in the monastery of
Montserrat in Catalonia.
The task of retracing the develop¬
ment of Vallejo's work from such incom¬
plete and unreliable elements was a great
challenge. The absence of drafts, notes,
manuscripts or first versions made it im¬
possible to undertake a complete genea¬
logical study of the kind which is possible
when writers bequeath their papers to a
national library. But a philological and
genealogical study of the "internal" fea¬
tures of Vallejo's work could be made
which goes beyond mere conjecture.
Proceeding from recurring themes and
the evolution in style, an international
team led by the critic Américo Ferrari has

Paradiso has been published in the Archives
Collection.
succeeded in "deconstructing" existing
anthologies and "constructing" an ap¬
proximate chronology which throws
light on unpublished parts of the poet's
work and relates them to the whole, thus
necessitating a reassessment of the defini¬
tive texts.
'Paradise' regained
A similar case is that of the Cuban
writer José Lezama Lima. The first edi¬
tion of his voluminous novel Paradiso
("Paradise") was full of typographical er¬
rors which for many years were taken to
be deliberate mistakes made by the
author, since he had checked the proofs.
Seventy per cent of the errors which he
had inadvertently overlooked were at¬
tributed to his style, to indiscriminate use
of quotations and references and to the
full stops and commas which he scattered
in time with "the rhythm of his asthmatic
breathing", as he ironically remarked,
and not according to the prevailing rules
of grammar.
An attempt was made several years
later to correct the innumerable errors in
the 1966 Cuban edition in a second, Mex¬
ican, edition supervised by the writer Ju¬
lio Cortázar. But a new problem arose.
Not having the original manuscript from
which to check the text, the publishers
introduced new errors, changed Lezama
Lima's idiosyncratic style to the extent of
altering the meaning of some passages,
and corrected the author's spelling of per¬
sonal and place names. Lezama Lima him¬
self lost interest. Letters addressed to him
by his publisher remained unanswered
and he claimed that checking the proofs
of the text against the manuscript would
tire him.
Over twenty years went by before
the published texts could be compared
with the manuscripts deposited in the
José Martí National Library in Havana.
This painstaking task, carried out by
Lezama Lima's old friend, the poet Cin-
tio Vitier, made it possible to establish the
definitive text of Paradiso. There were
many surprises, and thanks to the result¬
ing critical edition, many judgements of
the novel are being revised.
The examples of Azuela, Vallejo and
Lezama Lima show how important it is
to apply an adequate methodology when
studying the "itinerary" of literary texts
in regions like Latin America and the
Caribbean, where insufficient importance
has hitherto been attached to the preser¬
vation, evaluation and study of manu¬
scripts and to the variations which can
exist between different editions of the
same work. Literary manuscripts have
not received the same attention as
historical documents, and there are few
countries whose national libraries have
a department specializing in the pre¬
servation and study of their writers'
"archives".
29 years from 1st edition
to 'definitive text'
An interesting example is provided
by the Literary Archives of Uruguay's
National Library, thanks to which it was
possible to prepare a critical edition of
Enrique Amorim's La carreta ("The Wag¬
on"). The problem here was quite differ¬
ent from that posed by César Vallejo's
work, in that Amorim's widow, Esther
Haedo, had donated all her husband's per¬
sonal papers, which included a lot of
material relating to his work. There were
enough manuscripts, drafts, plans, typed
copies corrected by hand, and published
texts (different editions of the novel) and
a large dossier on matters relating to La
carreta, such as correspondence and crit¬
ics' reactions. The task was to classify and
interpret all this material.
Its analysis brought other facts to
light. Amorim's novel, published in 1932,
was an amalgam of four short stories
which appeared between 1923 and 1927..
The first of them, Las Quintanderas, con¬
tained the "genetic seed" or nucleus of
the novel, so that all the statements by
the author, letters and controversies aris¬
ing from its publication, would be of fun¬
damental importance for a genealogical
textual criticism.
22

### 83197: Literary detection and Latin American writing
Despite the novel's success, and the
fact that the first two editions were sold
out immediately, Amorim was not satis¬
fied with the structure of La carreta, feel¬
ing that it was too dependent on the
original short stories. A couple of years
later, he changed the order of the chap¬
ters, made stylistic changes in order to
achieve greater unity, and published a
third, revised edition.
Although he was still dissatisfied with
La carreta, Amorim dashed off other nov¬
els and stories which he published at this
time. Obsessed by the "imperfect", "un¬
finished" character of this first novel, he
made further changes in the text of ev¬
ery edition. In 1942 he even added a new
chapter, which had been published as a
short story entitled Carreta solitaria a
year earlier. It was not until the sixth
edition of 1952 that the "definitive" text
of the novel was established. Like Bou¬
vard et Pécuchet, the structure of which
greatly preoccupied Gustave Flaubert,
Amorim's novel, put together from
"remnants" and worked upon during a
large part of his life, became its author's
favourite.
This creative process lasting twenty-
nine years has left over 1,500 differences
between the first and last editions of La
carreta. Their inventory is of interest be¬
cause the "deconstruction" of the novel,
from the definitive 1952 edition back to
the short story of 1923, has made it pos¬
sible to study the development of the
work.
The paradox of La carreta is that the
critical edition of a work that is imper¬
fect but laboriously prepared is more in¬
teresting than that of one which is
theoretically perfect but was written "at
one go". Amorim could have agreed with
the German thinker Walter Benjamin,
who said that "for a great writer, a
finished work is of less importance than
a fragment on which he has been work¬
ing all his life".

In the development of genealogical

which an initiative like the Archives

The children's game of hopscotch (Spanish
Rayuelo) inspired the structure of Argentine
writer Julio Cortázar's eponymous novel as
well as providing its title. Sketches of the
game, two of which are reproduced here, are
scattered throughout El cuaderno de bitácora
de Rayuela, the notebook he kept while
writing the novel.
Argentine author Julio Cortázar has in¬
voluntarily provided excellent material
for researchers. When he began writing
his novel Rayuela (1963; Hopscotch) on 7
November 1958, he decided to keep a sort
of diary of the creative process which he
significantly called El cuaderno de bitácora
de Rayuela, or "the log book of Rayue¬
la", to which he committed at random
outlines of scenes, lists of characters, suc¬
cessive plans for the arrangement of the
work, diagrams and sketches, all of which
represented the development óf the nov¬
el he was to publish five years later.
The career of this log book did not
end with the publication of Rayuela in
1963. Exactly twenty years later, in 1983,
El cuaderno de bitácora de Rayuela was
published in Buenos Aires and in turn be¬
came an object of genealogical study.
Whether they deal with incomplete
or carefully preserved manuscripts, scat¬
tered literary archives or those deposited
in public or private collections, studies of
this kind are attracting more and more
interest in regions like Latin America and
the Caribbean, whose "voices of identi
ty" are raised in the cause of safeguard¬
ing our heritage, of which the written
word is one of the essential pillars.

THE BIRTH OF A LANGUAGE
The many occupations an Aztec boy could choose are shown in this page from the "Codex
Mendoza", a 16th-century record of Aztec life. At top centre, a father describes them to his son.
LATIN American writers have de¬
veloped a complex about the lan¬
guage in which they write because
they have always felt that it was not their
own. Many writers of metropolitan
Spain, especially purists, have encouraged
this feeling by assuming proprietary
rights over the Spanish language and
relegating Latin American literature to
the status of a mere offshoot of Spanish
literature. This attitude was summed up
by the Spanish essayist and novelist
Azorin (1874-1967), who frankly declared
at the beginning of the century that "we
are the souls of the language".
Philologists and linguists have tried
to explain this phenomenon which simul¬
taneously united and separated writers on
each side of the Atlantic. There is a lin¬
guistic "system" which for obvious
historical and political reasons is called
Castilian or Spanish. This system has
variants within Spain and, with much
greater justification, in Latin America.
The substrata of Amerindian languages,
the influence, in regions such as the
Caribbean, of African languages and of
contributions by immigrants, as well as
the language of creative writers, have
profoundly marked the phonetic modu¬
lations, word-structures, syntax and
vocabulary of Latin American Spanish.
They have strongly influenced and
impregnated this language which has been
used for centuries, but they have not
destroyed the unity of the system. It is
the same Spanish language, variegated and
enrichedwhy not?by contributions
which reflect the cultural and historical
context of Latin America.
This situation is the result of a long,
hard struggle, often waged in obscurity,
to achieve and assert a cultural identity.
The struggle finally bore fruit in the
twentieth century. The theory of the
Spanish linguistic system and its variants
is the expression of a linguistic situation
that clearly appeared at a specific moment
in the history of Latin American
literaturethe moment when Latin
American writers lost their inferiority
complex vis-à-vis their Iberian colleagues
and dared to assume their language. This
turning point marked the emergence of
a literature, initially poetic but later
predominantly narrative, which asserted
the continent's cultural identity through
works of exceptional quality which
testified to an original presence on the
contemporary literary scene.
Language is not the only determin¬
ing factor in the flowering of Latin
American literature in recent decades. But
in my opinion it is a decisive factor, if not
the principal one, because the full as¬
sumption of one's own language shapes
the balance of expression and the prac¬
tice, without complexes or culpability, of
letters.
The Archives Collection (see article
page 18) is revealing this decisive stage in
the evolution of twentieth-century Latin
American literature, through its mission
to represent the entire continent, and
through its methodology which en¬
courages the study of the original text and
its variants. "Readings" by specialists
representing a variety of trends in con¬
temporary literary criticism highlight
different aspects of each work. A mul-
tidisciplinary approach is used in the

preparation of critical editions in which
the study of details is combined with an
analysis of the wider significance of the
work in question.
Since the Archives Collection com¬
prises works produced since the begin¬
ning of the century, it enables the reader
to follow the development of Latin
American writing from its last stage of in¬
security to its affirmation as a literature
which has discovered its mode of expres¬
sion. Since all Latin American countries
are represented, the reader has a com¬
plete, comparative view of the variants
which exist within the linguistic system
outlined above. The Collection also illus¬
trates a basic fact about the linguistic sit¬
uation in Latin America. What, by
reference to a narrow, repressive critical
tradition, was once regarded as a form of
inadequacy, a blameworthy fault, a vice
that contaminated the "purity" of the
Castilian tongue, is actually a source of
enrichment to a changing language. Few
languages, in fact, are nourished from so
many sources as Spanish. This fact is now
accepted by the writers and even by the
academics of Spain, and is helping the
members of both communities to under¬
stand each other more fully and to feel
that they belong to the same cultural
community.
The Archives Collection is contribut¬
ing to the search for, or rather to the
affirmation of, the Latin American iden¬
tity. One area unexplored in this search,
although it concerns the roots of Latin
American identity, is that of the Amer¬
indian literatures. At the first plenary
session of ALLCA, the Latin American,
Caribbean and African 20th-century
Literary Archives Association, a proposal
was approved for the publication of texts
from this deep-rooted, predominantly
oral form of expression before it disap-

### 83202: A Thousand years of Catalan history
A THOUSAND YEARS
OF CATALAN HISTORY
BY FRANCESC VALLVERDU
TEN centuries ago, the Count of Barcelona severed the
ties of feudal loyalty that bound him to his liege lord,
the King of France. From then on, a territorial, social
and political entity centred on the ancestral house of Barcelo¬
na grew in strength and, from the thirteenth century onwards,
was known as Catalonia.
As a marchland and the outpost of Carolingian Europe in
Muslim Spain during the High Middle Ages, and the driving
force behind Catalan and Aragonese expansion between the
twelfth and fifteenth centuries, Catalonia has a historical con
tinuity of which even many Spaniards are unaware. Hence, the
commemoration of its "birth" a thousand years ago is more
than a strictly political event.
Catalonia is a small territory of some 32,000 square
kilometres which is situated in the north-eastern corner of the
Iberian peninsula and forms part of the kingdom of Spain.
However, historical Catalonia included part of southern France,
and even today some people think of Catalonia as encompass¬
ing the Catalan-speaking regions of Valencia, the Balearic Is¬
lands, Andorra, and the French Departement of Pyrenees

Orientales. But let us leave polemics aside. The region referred
to in this article is the autonomous community of the "Gener¬
alität de Catalunya", whose capital is Barcelona.
In geographical terms, present-day Catalonia is a triangular-
shaped region bounded in the north by the mountain chain
of the Pyrenees, in the east and south by the Mediterranean,
and in the west by the provinces of Aragon and Valencia, which
are irrigated by the River Ebro. There is a wide variety of cli¬
mate and relief. In the north are the Pyrenees, whose limestone
spurs extend southwards. The transversal north-eastern cor¬
dillera and the Mediterranean coastal ranges make a contrast
with the Ebro basin and the coastal plains. Although the cli¬
mate is predominantly Mediterranean, the high mountain areas
are Alpine in character.
From barely two million in 1900, Catalonia's population
has risen to six million today. The increase is primarily due
to immigration, which has compensated for the low birth rate
of the Catalan population.
Catalonia is one of Europe's most economically dynamic
regions. It occupies a pre-eminent position in the Spanish econ¬
omy, along with Madrid and the Basque region. The industrial
sector is particularly strong and is concentrated on textiles,
paper and the graphic arts, chemicals and metallurgy, and
tourism.
A dynasty that ruled for 5 centuries
Some 3,000 years ago the region was settled by Iberian tribes
with which the Phoenicians and Greeks established trade rela¬
tions, and in the third century BC it became part of the Ro¬
man province of Hispania. As elsewhere in Spain, Roman
civilization left an indelible mark on the language, culture and
law of Catalonia, which even inherited its agricultural and fish¬
ing techniques from Rome.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Hispania was invaded
by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors. In the eighth cen¬
tury AD, Charlemagne set up a number of vassal earldoms in
the eastern Pyrenean region of France as marchlands facing Mus¬
lim Spain. When the Count of Barcelona became independent
of the French kings in the tenth century, he established a dy¬
nasty that would govern Catalonia for the next five centuries.
In the twelfth century, the Count of Barcelona became, through
marriage, the king of Aragon. From then onwards, the Catalan-
Aragonese confederation, also known as the Crown of Aragon,
expanded into the eastern part of the Iberian peninsula. It con¬
quered Valencia, the Balearic Islands and later Sardinia, Naples
and Sicily, and eventually reached Greece and North Africa.
This was a splendid period of Catalan culture. Among its artis¬
tic and intellectual highlights were its Romanesque (see page
29) and later Gothic, art and architecture and in literature the
work of the thirteenth-century philosopher and mystic Ramon
Llull and the fifteenth-century poet Ausiàs March.
Crisis and loss of independence
In the fifteenth century, Catalan society experienced a
demographic crisis owing to the great plague, and an econom¬
ic and political crisis when the dynasty of the House of Barce¬
lona came to an end. The Crown of Aragon passed to rulers
of Castilian origin. During the reign of the Catholic monarchs
Ferdinand and Isabella at the end of the fifteenth century, the
kingdoms of Aragon and Castile were united, although each
maintained its political autonomy. This de facto confederacy
lasted until the eighteenth century when Philip V, victor of
the War of the Spanish Succession and the first Bourbon king
of Spain, conquered the former territories of the Crown of Ara¬
gon and annexed them to the Court of Castile.

The philosopher,
mystic and poet
Ramon Llull (c.
1233-1316), one of the
founders of Catalan
literature. Often
referred to as the
"Visionary Doctor",
Llull devoted his life
to meditation and
missionary work. This
18th-century portrait,
an engraving by the
Italian artist
Domenico Rossetti, is
based on an earlier
painting by Jan-Frans
van Douven.
In 1714, Catalonia lost its political independence and self-
governing institutions, and the Catalan language was banned
from education and public administration. At the same time,
the region began to recover from the economic decline into
which it had fallen between the fifteenth and the seventeenth
centuries. The contrast between economic expansion, based on
advances in agriculture and industry, and a lack of political
decision-making powers was the fundamental reason for the
Catalonia's instability during the nineteenth century and one
of the decisive causes of the political crisis in Spain.
The recovery of autonomy
Although, with the proclamation of the Catalan Republic
in 1931, it seemed that the crisis in the Spanish state could be
resolved by democratic means, while respecting the autonomy
of Catalonia, that illusion was soon dashed by the terrible Civil
War which lasted from 1936 to 1939. After General Franco's
victory, Spain was subjected to a fascist-inspired dictatorship
which, for Catalonia and the Basque region, entailed the loss
of their national liberties and their governing institutions.
The situation began to change again with the restoration
of democracy in 1975. Two years later Catalonia recovered its
traditional self-governing institution, the Generalität, and since
1979 it has enjoyed self-governing status as an autonomous com¬
munity within the Kingdom of Spain.
Over a period of ten centuries, then, Catalonia has deve¬
loped into a viable national community and a strong-willed peo¬
ple which has asserted itself through the vicissitudes of its
history.
A cultural boom

### 83202: A Thousand years of Catalan history
Today Catalonia can celebrate the thousandth anniversary
of its political independence with serenity and optimism.
Although only twelve years have passed since 1977, it is worth
recalling that Catalonia has not enjoyed such a long period of
political autonomy and democracy for three centuries. The
Catalan language has recovered its status as an official language
alongside Castilian Spanish, it is taught in all educational es¬
tablishments and it is increasingly heard on radio and televi¬
sion. There is a boom in Catalan literature not only within the
region, where over 4,500 books a year in Catalan are published,
but elsewhere, owing to the translation into Spanish, English,
French and other languages of the works of our great medieval
and classical writers such as Ramon Llull, Bernât Metge, Au-
sias March, Joariot Martorell, as well as those of contemporary
authors like Josep Carner, Salvador Espriu, J.V. Foix, Mercè
Rodoreda and Joan Perucho.
Catalan art, which in this century has produced such world-
famous figures as the architect Gaudi, the musician Pau (Pab¬
lo) Casals, and the painters Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and An-
toni Tapies, has brought extraordinary stature to our culture,
which will surely be appreciated by the visitors who will at¬
tend the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992.
Certainly there are problems which cast a shadow over
some aspects of this positive report, but perhaps their very ex¬
istence is a sign of the vitality of Catalonia and its ability to
take up the challenges of the next thousand years.

### 83203: Romanesque treasures of Catalonia
ROMANESQUE TREASURES
OF CATALONIA BY EDUARD CARBONELL I ESTELLER
IK < *^
An outstanding
example of Catalan
Romanesque
architecture, the 11th-
century monastery of
Sant Père de Rodes is
located in a
mountainous setting
near Gerona.
ARTISTIC styles tend to be strongly associated with the
countries where they originated (as in the case of Renais¬
sance art in Italy or the Gothic style of northern France)
or with the countries where their most important works were
produced (such as Baroque painting in Spain).
But styles are also associated with certain countries for other
reasons. Thus the Romanesque style is associated with Catalo¬
nia although, judged in terms of the numbers of high quality
works found there, Gothic would seem to be a more represen¬
tative Catalan style. Furthermore, many works of architecture,
sculpture and painting from the Romanesque period in Catalo¬
nia are largely inspired by foreign models from southern France
and, especially, from northern Italy.
Catalonia's association with Romanesque art stems from
the fact that the country's historical origins and the affirma
tion of its nationhood date from the tenth and eleventh centu¬
ries. There are two factors in the art of this period which, I
believe, explain this sense of beginning and affirmation. These
are an early form of Romanesque based on the indigenous forms
of a previous tradition, and an internationalist ambition.
The pre-Romanesque tradition
Apart from the main trends in Romanesque architecture
represented by the Lombard style of northern Italy, remarka¬
ble buildings were being constructed in Catalonia in the early
decades of the eleventh century which continued an earlier style.
29
## [Page 30](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/083206engo.pdf#page=30) 🆗
### 83203: Romanesque treasures of Catalonia
A major monument such as the monastery church of Sant Pere
de Rodes at Gerona, consecrated in 1022, represents a continu¬
ation of the great international architecture of the previous cen¬
tury, the most typical example of which is the church of Sant
Miquel at Cuxa, on the northern slope of the Pyrenees, which
was associated with the Benedictine abbey of Cluny in Burgun¬
dy, France.
Sant Pere de Rodes church is notable for the presence of
classical architectural features, such as the superposed order of
the columns and the monumental quality of the construction.
This continuation of pre-Romanesque art is also represented
by two outstanding early eleventh-century illuminated bibles
from the monasteries at Rodes and Ripoll, which are preserved,
respectively, in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the Vati¬
can Library, Rome.
Meanwhile, the architectural trend from Lombardy reached
Catalonia and became widely influential. The Lombard type
of construction dominates the architectural landscape of the ear¬
ly Romanesque period in Catalonia with such remarkable build¬
ings as the church of Sant Pere de Casserres, the monastery of
Santa Maria at Ripoll, and the building which is to my mind
the paradigm of this style, the collegiate church of Sant Vicenç
at Cardona (Barcelona).
Inspiration from Italy and France
The international character of Romanesque art is another
feature which associates it with Catalonia, whose outward-
looking spirit during the Romanesque period was an expres¬
sion of political and religious assertiveness. This is reflected in
the importance of religious centres such as Ripoll and Cuxa
Left, Romanesque frescos in the apse of the church of Sant Climent de
Tahull, Lérida. The central figure of Christ Pantocrator (All Powerful)
rests His feet on the world. On either side of His head are inscribed
the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and omega,
symbolizing the beginning and end of Creation. These paintings,
executed in 1123, rank among the finest examples of Catalan
Romanesque art.
and the cathedrals of Vich, Gerona and Barcelona. These were
cultural centres of European importance frequented by people
like Pietro Orseolo (991-1008), Duke of Venice, and the monk
Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 945-1003), who became Pope Sylvester II.
Catalan Romanesque sculpture and the best Catalan
Romanesque painting also reveal foreign influences. The chief
examples reflect Italian and French styles but sometimes there
is also a short-lived Islamic influence.
The splendid series of paintings in the church of Sant Quirze
de Pedret, and the wall paintings from the churches of Santa
Maria and Sant Climent de Tahull, were undoubtedly the work
of artists who followed the great Italian school of mural paint¬
ing. In sculpture, the influence of the workshops of Roussil-
lon, southern France, and later of those of Languedoc, especially
the great centre of Toulouse, is manifest in the capitals of
columns at Vich cathedral and in the imposing portal of Santa
Maria monastery at Ripoll.
International influences are also evident towards the end
of the twelfth century, in the cloister of Tarragona cathedral
which is possibly the work of artists from the last Toulouse
workshops. Like the Daurade in Toulouse or Master Antela-
mi's work in Parma, northern Italy, the Tarragona sculpture
represents the swan song of Romanesque art, which was to give
way to Early Gothic from northern France.

### 83203: Romanesque treasures of Catalonia
Catalan Romanesque art produced many works of outstand¬
ing beauty. Apart from those already mentioned, typical ex¬
amples include the cathedral of Seu d'Urgell at Lérida,
completed in 1175 by Raimundus Lambardus according to
Italian models, the collegiate church of Sant Joan de les Abadess-
es at Gerona, consecrated in 1150, and the magnificent cloisters,
rich in sculpture, in Gerona cathedral, the church of Sant Pere
de Galligant, also at Gerona, and the Benedictine abbey of Sant
Cugat del Valles near Barcelona.
This late style can also be observed in painting, especially
panel painting, but in this case with a Byzantine influence from
southern Italy which reached the studios of Roussillon painters.
Church iconography and the decorative arts
After such early works as those of Sant Joan de Boi, which
recall the Carolingian style, a high point was reached around
1100 with the paintings at Sant Quirze de Pedret and, a little
later, with the Tahull ensemble which dates from 1123 and is
executed in a more geometrical style. The link with stylistic
trends from the other side of the Pyrenees is evident in such
works as the apse paintings from Santa Maria de Mur (now in
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, USA) and in the paintings
preserved in the church of Santa Maria de Barbera.
Sculpted figure of Christ in Majesty adorns the tympanum of
a mid-12th-century doorway in the monastery church of Santa Maria
at Ripoll, Catalonia.
Catalan panel painting of the late twelfth and early thir¬
teenth century is in some respects comparable only to that of
Italy in the rich decoration it provided for liturgical furniture,
altar frontals, canopies and apse beams.
Also outstanding are the great carved wooden figures such
as that of Christ in Majesty, rendered with great intensity, lean¬
ing on the cross, attired in noble garments; the Mother of God
on the sedes sapientiae; and sculptured groups including those
representing the Descent from the Cross.
The most important centres for the production of illumi¬
nated manuscripts were at Vich and Ripoll and, later, in the
cathedral of Tortosa, at Tarragona, and in Barcelona cathedral.
A high degree of excellence was also achieved in crafts, es¬
pecially textiles (in such works as the eleventh-century tapes¬
try of the Creation in Gerona cathedral), and the
Limoges-inspired art of enamel-making, most of whose products
are preserved in the two richest museums of Catalan
Romanesque art, the Museum of Catalan Art in Barcelona and
the Episcopal Museum at Vich.
EDUARD CARBONELL I ESTELLER, professor of art history at the Au¬
tonomous University of Barcelona, has published many studies on medieval
and Romanesque art, and notably on Catalan art of the high Middle Ages. He
is currently serving as director-general of the cultural heritage of the autono¬
mous region of Catalonia.
The late 12th-century cloister of Tarragona cathedral may have
been built by stone-masons from Toulouse in southern France.

THE architecture of Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926) and the
painting of Salvador Dalí (1904-1989) have a distinctive
aesthetic power which raises many questions for those
who seek to understand the innermost meaning of their work.
Both artists have been described as geniuses, as creators
afflicted by madness, men whose minds were caught in the
hallucinations created by certain forms arising from the
subconscious. Admired and contested by their contemporaries,
they mocked the cultural tenets of their time and succeeded,
with bravado and originality, in creating an extraordinary world
of novel ideas which are now internationally acknowledged as
high points in the annals of art.
Both Gaudi and Dalí were natives of Catalonia, a region
which prides itself on dividing its people into two categories:
those who are balanced, serious-minded and well-behaved; and
those who are consumed by a kind of rage, who are impulsive,
' quick-tempered and wilful.
In their own region, Gaudi and Dalí are generally thought
of as belonging to the impulsive category, most probably
because, at some point in time, with the clearsightedness born
Antoni Gaudi was born into a family of craftsmen, from
whom he learned the secrets of the traditional trades and familia¬
rized himself with the techniques they used. He studied architec¬
ture in Barcelona, where he was awarded his diploma in 1878,
at a time when, in the wake of a cultural and political revival,
"modernismo" was starting to emerge in Spain as a movement
in architecture and the decorative arts contemporary with Art
Nouveau which spread throughout Europe in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Although he was rejected by the public opinion of his time,
he enjoyed the support of a prosperous and enterprising mid¬
dle class, which sought its identity in the extravagant buildings
he designed.
The secret of Gaudi's art is that he succeeded in grasping
the patterns present In nature and the organic world and was
capable of selecting from their infinite variety of shapes those
that could be transposed into architecture. He pursued this
course with great imagination: tree-trunks, branches, bones,
ribs, fishing nets and flowers all became ideas for designs which
he used in churches, parks, schools and other buildings.
All his work was based on logic and reasoning and was
thought out down to the smallest detail. Underlying the
exuberant fantasy of the shapes he used, there was always a
rational calculation and a far-reaching study of the loads and
forces involved and of the function of all the structural elements

THE ART OF EXCESS BY DANIEL GIRALT-MIRACLE
which he brought into, play. He applied this method of work¬
ing as much to the large columns supporting a façade as to the
tiniest ornamental details reproduced in ceramic tiles, glass,
wood or wrought iron. Essentially, he was seeking to achieve
a work of total art, in which the parts and the whole were in
harmony and conferred on the architecture a new and differ¬
ent personality, full of aesthetic meaning.
Dali on a tightrope between the real
and the imaginary
Salvador Dalí is a very similar case to Gaudi. He drew his
inspiration from the wild and secluded Costa Brava, with its
steep and rocky shoreline, and from the enigmatic landscapes
of the Ampurdan region constantly buffeted by the Tramon¬
tane, the northerly wind coming off the mountains.
After studying art in Madrid, where he was a contemporary
of Luis Buñuel, García Lorca, Rafael Alberti and other figures
of the Spanish avant-garde of the 1930s, he exhibited his work
in Barcelona, where his paintings and eccentricities made him
a celebrity. In 1928 he moved to Paris, where the Surrealist
group of artists and writers were so taken aback by his work
that the French poet André Breton declared that Dalí embod-

ied the Surrealist spirit: "the poetic and visionary images of his
paintings possess an extraordinary intensity and explosive
force."*
He invented an imaginary world. An authentic landscape
of the mind came to the surface through his depictions of "soft"
watches, boundless perspectives stretching into infinity, elon¬
gated staffs, human limbs exaggerated out of all 'proportion,
giraffes bursting into flames, gold coins and other forms that
made him a fitting exemplar of the "paranoiac critical" theory
embraced so enthusiastically by Freud and the painters and
poets of the time, whereby images were brought up from the
subconscious mind.
Dalí often claimed that his entire work was a projection
of his inner world, the representation of his subconscious, and
the obsessions and fantasies of an artist who turned his hand
with equal energy to painting, sculpture, literature, drama, stage
design, jewellery, film-making, the design of artefacts and public
"happenings".

### 83205: Gaudí and Dalí, the art of excess
The Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueras, which was found¬
ed in- 1974, epitomizes the world of fantasy, theatrical effect
and over-brimming imagination inhabited by Salvador Dali, a
figure who was a source of interest to poets and artists, film¬
makers and scientists, philosophers and politicians, children and
adults alike.
Curiously enough, Gaudi and Dalí are two typically Cata¬
lan figures, each of whose names, in both origin and meaning,
define the form taken by their lives: "gaudi" (gaudir) means
to "enjoy" delving into interesting questions, while "dali" (delir)
signifies "being impelled by an overwhelming urge".
Such is the intense and passionate force of these artists who,
drawing inspiration from their native soil and driven forward
by their genius, became universal figures speaking through art,
the most universal of all languages.
