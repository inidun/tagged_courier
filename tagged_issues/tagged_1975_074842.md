In this work, an 18th-century Korean artist, Kim-Hong-do, has captured the flowing,
rhythmic movements of a girl dressed as a Buddhist nun and executing a ritual dance. A
master of many styles, Kim-Hong-do excelled as a landscape painter as well as a portrai¬
tist, vividly conveying the mood of Korean mountains and rivers and villages. He also
depicted, often humorously, scenes from daily life in Korea and in a famous series of
paintings portrayed the "Immortals", figures from Korean myth, religion and history, in a
robust and heroic style. Drawing shown here is in Korea's National Museum, in Seoul.

THE
NEW
WORLD
OF MICROBIOLOGY
by Elie L. Woilman
ELIE L. WOLLMAN, French geneticist and
researcher. Is Assistant Director of the Pas¬
teur Institute in Paris. His research has been
particularly concerned with the genetics
of bacteria and bacteriophages, often in
collaboration with François Jacob (Nobel
Prize for Physiology- Medicine. 1965). They
are co-authors of a major study, La Sexualité
des Bactéries ("Sexuality and the Genetics
of Bacteria" published in English by Aca¬
demic Press. London and New York, 1961).
IN the second half of the 17th cen¬
tury a Dutch merchant and ama¬
teur scientist, Antony Van Leeuwen-
hoek, discovered through the lenses
of his own home-made microscopes the
previously unsuspected world of micro¬
organisms. He was astounded both
by their extraordinary ubiquity and by
the extreme diversity of their forms.
Two centuries later, Louis Pasteur
was to demonstrate the part which
micro-organisms play in natural pro¬
cesses, astonishing the world by prov¬
ing that these tiny creatures were
responsible for many hitherto inexplic¬
able phenomena, some useful to
mankind such as the fermentation
which produces wine and beer, others
harmful like many of the diseases
which afflict humans and animals.
What chiefly interested scientists
for a long time were the many differ
ent effects which micro-organisms
produce. Their importance from the
point of view of public health, the food
industries and agriculture was so great
that they were studied rather in terms
of what they did than what they were.
Pasteur had himself, however, drawn
attention to the specificity of micro-
organic activity the fact that each
individual phenomenon (each disease
for example) was caused by a particu¬
lar species of micro-organisms. Hence,
microbiologists, inspired by the
example of the 19th-century German
bacteriologist Robert Koch in particu¬
lar, endeavoured to devise methods
of cultivating, isolating and identifying
the various species of microbes.
This was relatively easy in the case
of bacteria: a variety of nutritive media
and methods were developed, usually .
on an empirical basis, for studying r

SIX GREAT NAMES
ANTONY VAN LEEUWENHOEK (1632-1723), Dutch draper and amateur scien¬
tist, whose all-absorbing hobby was grinding lenses through which he exa¬
mined microbes (which he called "animalcules"). He made the first accurate
description of red blood cells and studied the composition of yeasts.
LOUIS PASTEUR (1822-1895), French chemist and biologist who has been
called the_ founder of microbiology. He proved that micro-organisms cause
fermentation and disease and was first to use vaccines for rabies. . Pas¬
teurization, a method of preserving food by heat or cold, is named after him.
ROBERT KOCH (1843-1910), German physician who established bacteriology
as a separate science. He discovered the germ that causes tuberculosis (named
after him) and also identified the germ of Asian cholera. For his discoveries
he was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine.
ILYA MECHNIKOV (1845-1916), Russian zoologist and biologist. Won the
1908 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his discovery in animals of what he called
"phagocytes" or "devouring cells" which engulf and absorb foreign bodies
such as bacteria.
CARLOS JUAN FINLAY (1833-1915), Cuban doctor. His fundamental discovery
that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes (later confirmed by the work
of the U.S. physician Walter Reed) made it possible to isolate the yellow fever
virus and thus reduce the ravages of this disease.
ALEXANDER FLEMING (1881-1955), British bacteriologist whose discovery
in a mould (1928) of a substance which he called penicillin, and which prevented
the growth of deadly staphylococci bacteria, prepared the way for antibiotic
therapy for infectious diseases. The isolation, purification and testing of
penicillin was carried out in 1939 by two British scientists, Ernst Boris Chain
and Howard Florey, who shared with Fleming the Nobel Prize in 1945.
> them. But one category of micro-
organism s those responsible for
diseases such as tobacco mosaic, -
rabies and poliomyelitis were not
visible under the microscope and could
not be cultivated in artificial media:
these were given the name of viruses.
Bacteriologists discovered that the
organisms they were studying pos¬
sessed a bewildering variety of proper¬
ties: some bacteria would only develop
in highly complex organic media, while
others would grow in simple synthetic
media.
Some aerobic b a c t e r i a would
only develop in the presence of air
and others anaerobic bacteria in
its absence; some could live in an
acid media, others in an alkaline
media, some at high temperatures and
others at low.
Microbiology thus offered an ex¬
tremely wide field of studies. From
microbiology itself and around it, a
number of specialized disciplines grew
up: virology, which is concerned with
infectious agents that can only be
cultivated in susceptible host organ¬
isms (plants, insects or animals) or on
living tissue from these organisms ;
immunology, which studies the reac¬
tions of the host to the infection;
epidemiology, which studies the dis¬
semination of pathogenic (disease-
causing) micro-organisms in nature,
the mechanisms whereby they are
propagated and the methods of
controlling their propagation; and
chemotherapy which studies the means
of combating micro-organisms, etc.
For many years microbiology devel¬
oped in relative isolation from the
other biological disciplines which were
concerned with multicellular, complex.
differentiated organisms. It was not
until cell physiology and biochemistry
developed that it became possible to
compare the microbial world .with the
rest of the living world.
Bacteria are single-cell organisms.
They are extremely small and it Is
thus very difficult to observe individual
bacteria directly or to experiment on
one. The researcher is usually dealing
not with a single bacterium but with
large populations: a scarcely visible
culture in a liquid medium may contain
some ten million individual bacteria
per cubic centimetre.
To multiply, bacteria simply divide in
two by a process called "fission".
Because of these characteristics, they
were long regarded as being outside
the field of study of general biology,
a situation which only changed in the
second quarter of the present century.
Each bacterium is, in fact, both a cell
and an organism. It draws susten¬
ance from the medium in which it
lives, grows and then divides, thus
giving birth to two bacteria identical
to the original cell. Many species can
be grown in the laboratory in sub-
tances known as "culture media" and
abundant, homogeneous cultures can
easily be obtained. It is thus possible
to follow the biochemical reactions
whereby the substances used for food
by bacteria are transformed or "metab¬
olized" and a bacterial culture devel¬
ops.
The world of bacteria, as we have al¬
ready seen, is also a world of the
greatest diversity. Species differ from
each other in their nutritional require¬
ments, in the food which they are
capable of utilizing, in the sources of
energy (chemical energy or energy
absorbed from sunlight) which they
use, in the substances which they are
capable of breaking down. All such
reactions require the presence of
biological catalysts known as enzymes, -
which are large protein molecules.
Enzymes are highly specific, each
kind promoting a particular reaction.
By collecting, crushing and fractionat¬
ing a bacterial culture it is thus poss¬
ible to isolate various enzymes, to
purify them, to study their properties
and to reproduce in a test-tube the
chemical changes for which they act
as catalyst.
In this way, it has been possible to
unravel the mysteries of the meta¬
bolic "pathways" whereby the organ¬
ism's food is broken down and the
essential constituents of living matter
are produced by biosynthesis. This
research has shown that despite the
great variety of physiological types
observed in the world of bacteria,
their main metabolic "pathways" are
basically similar to those of other
living creatures, thus confirming one
of the great concepts of biology: the
diversity and unity of the living world.
The results obtained from research
on bacteria were found to tie in with
those obtained from study of animal
and vegetable tissues. Bacteria, it
was shown, contain the same bio¬
chemical compounds as the tissues,
and enzymes performing the same
functions set off similar biochemical
reactions. Within the. extreme diver¬
sity of highly complex metabolic
"pathways" certain essential nodal
points and key «compounds were
observed.
All cells contain the same ingredi¬
ents, of which the main ones are
macro-molecules: the nucleic acids

and the proteins. The nucleic acids
are deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA,
which is found in the nucleus of the
cell, and ribonucleic acids, which occur
mainly in the cytoplasm (the material
surrounding the cell's nucleus).
Proteins are large molecular struc¬
tures composed of a score or so of
amino acids. The most important of
the proteins are the enzymes which
constitute the "working parts" of the
cell. In order for a cell to grow and
multiply, its constituents must be
synthesized from the cell's food.
In this process, involving mechan¬
isms of great complexity, the food
material is broken down by means of
enzyme reactions to provide the raw
material for the synthesizing process
and at the same time the energy
needed to set off these processes.
All living things, despite their
apparent extreme diversity, thus
possess certain fundamental mechan¬
isms which are common to all and it
is due in great part to the study of
micro-organisms that this underlying
unity was discovered.
The first contacts between the physi¬
ology of micro-organisms and that of
higher organisms were made in the
1930s, through studies on nutrition.
It was then discovered that certain
substances (amino acids, purine or
pyrimidine compounds or bases, and
vitamins) were essential for the growth
of both higher organisms and micro¬
organisms.
Thanks in particular to the research
done by André Lwoff at the Pasteur
Institute, in Paris, the idea of essential
metabolites (substances indispensable
to all living creatures) emerged and
with it the idea that the organisms
that needed to be provided with these
substances were incapable of syn¬
thesizing them for themselves.
this idea was exploited ten years
or so later by George Beadle and
Edward Tatum at Stanford University,
California, in their genetic research
on a red bread mould known as
Neurospora Crassa.
Geneticists, following the discover¬
ies made by Gregor Mendel in the
19th century, had studied the results
of cross-breeding in sexually repro¬
ducing organisms peas, maize and
the fruit-fly or Drosophila. Their res¬
earch was concerned with complex
morphological characteristics such as
colour of flowers, shape of seeds,
length of wings, etc.
They had established the existence
of units of heredity or genes, strung
out along the chromosomes in the
nucleus of each cell, each character¬
istic being governed by a particular
gene. But the nature of the genes
and the way in which the genotype
(the information contained in the genes
of a given organism) governed the
phenotype (the characteristics which
appear in that organism) remained
unknown.
The Neurospora Crassa fungus can
be cultivated in a particular medium.
Strains with different characteristics
can be crossed and the results of this
crossing can be analysed quantitat¬
ively. Beadle and Tatum found that
by varying the environment of Neuros¬
pora, they could locate and identify
genetic changes or "mutants". They
exposed the mould to X-rays and
studied the altered nutritional require¬
ments of the mutants thus produced.
They showed that each nutritional
characteristic is governed by a gene,
each gene occupying a particular place
on one of the chromosomes of Neuro¬
spora. They concluded that each gene
determined the structure of a specific
enzyme which is present in the original
strain but lacking in the mutant. This
is the now famous "one gene-one
enzyme" concept which established
the link between genetics and the
biochemistry of micro-organisms, by
explaining the mechanism whereby
genes affect heredity by determining
enzyme structure.
Bacteria had until then been
considered completely outside the
realm of genetics. A culture of bac¬
teria, however, contains spontaneous
mutants which differ from the original
type in certain characteristics.
Edward Tatum applied the methods
used with Neurospora to induce
mutations and study biochemical
processes in the colon bacillus, and
isolated nutritional changes in these
bacteria which were comparable ifi
every respect to those of Neurospora.
A few years later, several mechan¬
isms for genetic transfer _ between
bacteria were discovered and 'analysed.
The positions of the genes on the
chromosomes were identified, and
bacteria soon became the primary
source of information concerning the
genetic control of biochemical pro¬
cesses in the cell.
In 1928, the British bacteriologist Fred
Griffith had discovered an extraordi¬
nary phenomenon which was to remain
unexplained for many years: when
certain pneumococci (microbes which
cause pneumonia) were placed in
contact with an extract of pneumococci.

, passed on by heredity certain proper¬
ties of the type from which the extract
had been
Nearly twenty years later, Oswald
Avery and his associates at the
Rockefeller Institute in New York,
demonstrated that the active substance
at work in this process is deoxyri¬
bonucleic acid or DNA. DNA is the
c'^ief material in the chromosomes in
all cells. It is found in all the bacteria
and in a large number of viruses. DNA
is the material of inheritance.
It is a very large molecule, a poly¬
nucleotide composed of six parts.
It consists of phosphate, a sugar called
deoxyribose, and four compounds, or
bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine and
thyamine.
In 1953, Francis Crick and James
Watson, two scientists working at
Cambridge University (England) built
a model of the structure of DNA
showing it to be composed of two
complementary strands, coiled round
each other into a helix. This model
accounts for all the properties which
the material of inheritance must pos¬
sess, and experience in the succeeding
twenty years has demonstrated its
validity. We now understand, for ins¬
tance, how genetic material can per¬
petuate itself unchanged from gen¬
eration to generation through the
process known as replication.
The genetic message contained in
DNA is transmitted by extremely com¬
plicated mechanisms which have been
explained, in particular, by the res¬
earch of François Jacob and Jacques
Monod at the Pasteur Institute. The
DNA is situated in the nucleus of the
cell and protein synthesis occurs in the
cytoplasm, in parts of the cell which
are rich in another acid, ribonucleic
acid or RNA.
It has been shown that the genetic
information contained in the DNA
molecule is first transcribed in the
form of a messenger RNA which is an
exact copy of the particular length of
DNA which is to be "translated". The
messenger RNA then frees itself from
the nucleus and travels towards the
cytoplasm where it attaches itself to
granules known as ribosomes (com¬
posed of RNA and proteins). When it
comes in contact with the ribosomes,
the messenger RNA is "translated"
into a specific protein.
The processes of genetic transcrip¬
tion and translation are governed by
complex mechanisms and controlled
by delicate regulating systems resem¬
bling those used in electronic circuits.
According to environmental con¬
ditions or, in the case of higher organ¬
isms the specialization of the cells
and tissues, everything depends on
whether a particular biochemical reac¬
tion occurs or does not occur, whether
or not a particular enzyme is synthes¬
ized, and whether or not a particular
gene functions.
For this reason, in addition to the
genes which provide the code for the
structure of enzymes, there are genes
which intervene at various levels of
the metabolic circuits to adjust and
regulate them.
So far we have spoken mainly
about bacteria, but we should also
take a brief look at the vast world of
viruses. For many years, viruses were
best known for the effects they pro¬
duced, and particularly as the agents
of diseases in plants, insects and
animals, including man.
Viruses are the simplest of living
things. They can produce identical
copies of themselves indefinitely, but
can only reproduce inside a host cell.
A virus is not itself a cell: it contains
only one nucleic acid which carries
its genetic information, in certain cases
only DNA, in others RNA. Not itself
possessing the necessary mechanism
for reproduction, the virus must use
that of the host cell. Its identity and
continuity are ensured by the nucleic
acid which is reproduced only by the
host cell.
Much of our present knowledge of
viruses, particularly with regard to
genetics, is due to research which has
been carried out on bacteriophages,
the viruses which infect bacteria.
In some cases, the bacteriophages
multiply within the bacteria which they
infect and destroy. Others behave
differently, possessing the remarkable
property of being able to integrate with
the genetic material of the host bac¬
teria, which in this case is not killed:
the DNA of the virus works its way
into the DNA of the host cell chromo¬
some.
The affected bacteria, known as
lysogenic bacteria, produce their own
genetic material and that of the virus
too, which in this state is called a
provirus. Sometimes, as the result of
a mutation, the provirus becomes
defective; it can no longer develop
into the infectious virus and continues
to reproduce itself as a provirus.
Certain viruses of animals are
known to be capable of causing can¬
cers. In this case, as with bacteria,
the nucleic acid of the virus integrates
with a chromosome of the host cell,
transforming it into a malignant cell.
It is not known whether any cancers
in human beings are caused by viruses,
but it is feasible that, as in the case of
lysogenic bacteria, some cancers may
be due to the action of proviruses.
The use of cell cultures has led
to great progress in modern virology.
Since cells can be grown in a culture,
it is possible to employ the methods
which have already been successfully
used in research on bacteria and bac¬
teriophages.
Immunology, the study of micro¬
organisms and other microscopic
substances that provide immunity from
disease, came into being as one of
the branches of microbiology and
infectious pathology.
When an animal organism is infected
by bacteria or viruses, defence
mechanisms come into operation
which protect it against reinfection.
These mechanisms of resistance to
infection, however, are not only subtle
and complex, but have a far wider
significance. Each species, and indeed
each individual within that species, has
an immunological identity of its own
and possesses mechanisms which
enable it to distinguish between the
materials of which it is constituted and
substances which are foreign to it.
A foreign substance may be an
infectious agent, a substance ori¬
ginating from another species, or even
the blood or an organ of an individual
of the same species.
Even without a detailed description
of the complex mechanism of the
immune reaction, it should be clear
that this reaction can be beneficial
"when it protects the individual against
infection and that it can also be harm¬
ful when it results in such effects as
allergies (adverse reactions of the
body) allergic reactions during blood
transfusion or the rejection of an organ
transplant.
Microbiology has thus made a very
important contribution to our under¬
standing of the living world. Thanks
particularly to the close collaboration
between geneticists and biochemists,
it has been possible to discover the
basic unity of the fundamental mecha¬
nisms governing the functioning of all
living things.
This idea, which was implicit in the
theory of evolution enunciated by
Darwin rather more than a century
ago, is now backed up by an impres¬
sive array of data. The revolution
which this has brought about in biology
can only be compared with that which
occurred in the physical sciences a
quarter of a century earlier as a result
of the successes achieved in atomic
physics.
This new approach to biological
phenomena, which consists in ana¬
lysing them in terms of the structure
and function of the chemical com¬
pounds involved, has been given the
name of molecular biology. After the
outstanding successes achieved in the
study of the simplest of organisms,
bacteria and viruses, the concepts and
methods of molecular biology are
now being applied throughout the
fields of biology and medicine.

Here's
to our health !
Microbes to the rescue
against hordes of dastardly germs
by Oganes V. Baroyan
FEW sciences with so short a his¬
tory have achieved as many
remarkable successes as microbiology.
With its development are associated
such famous names as Louis Pasteur,
llya Mechnikov, Robert Koch, Edward
Jenner, Dmitri Ivanovsky, Daniil Zabo-
lotny, Gaston Ramon, Alexander Fle¬
ming, Nikolai Gamaleya and many
others.
There are good reasons why so
many eminent scientists from different
countries should have been interested
in the study of microscopic organisms.
Since time immemorial certain micro¬
bes have been the deadly enemies of
mankind by virtue of the infectious
diseases which they cause.
The "Black Death" or bubonic pla¬
gue carried off half the population of
Europe in the Middle Ages. Millions
of persons have been made blind by
smallpox and trachoma and hundreds
of thousands of children paralysed by
polio. Yellow fever has struck down
millions of persons and 20 million died
in a single epidemic of Spanish
influenza earlier in the present century.
This is only a small part of the toll
taken by disease-causing microbes.
Even before he understood the
OGANES V. BAROYAN, Sower epidemi¬
ologist, was Assistant Director-General of
the World Health Organization from 1961
to 1964. He is now director of the Gamaleya
Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology
(Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences) and
Head of the Faculty of Epidemiology at the
Central Doctors Advanced Training institute
(Soviet Ministry of Health), both in Moscow.
A member ofthe AcademyofMedicalSciences
of the U.S.S.FI., he is the author of numerous
scientific studies and articles on virus infec¬
tions which have been translated into many
languages. He has been an adviser to the
U.N. and WHO on questions relating to
the banning of bacteriological weapons.
causes of infectious diseases, man
tried to combat them: the first attempts
at inoculation were made 3,000 years
ago. But the fight against microbial
infections began to make headway
only after man had accumulated know¬
ledge based on scientific experiment
and backed up by scientific obser¬
vations.
Scientists have so far identified and
studied more than 2,500 species of
micro-organisms. Some microbiolo¬
gists estimate that this represents only
a tenth of the total "invisible population
of the earth", and the discovery of
new species is constantly being report¬
ed. At the same time, more and
more is being found out about the
structure, properties and behaviour of
micro-organisms.
The world of micro-organisms is one
of extraordinary diversity, but all the
different bacteria, micro-fungi, viruses,
etc., have one thing in common: their
minute size. Even so the population
of this microscopic world ranges from
"dwarfs" no larger than a good-sized
molecule (only in recent years, thanks
to the electron microscope, has it be¬
come possible to examine and take
pictures of them) to "giants" whose
dimensions are measured in microns
(a micron is 1/25,400 of an inch). The
difference between the "dwarfs" and
the "giants" is roughly equivalent to
that between ants and whales.
Research workers have often ob¬
served that microbes are found in
places where one would not suppose
that life could exist: in the upper layers
of the earth's atmosphere, in the
Antarctic ice, in the boiling jets of
geysers, and even in the cooling
systems of nuclear reactors. And
they reproduce at an incredible speed:
a single micro-organism can produce
70 generations in 24 hours (a few
drops of nutrient medium may contain
a population of some 7,000 million
microbes).
Mankind has thus taken on an ener¬
getic, adaptable and extremely tough
foe, one who is invisible to boot, and
yet man has succeeded in winning one
decisive battle after another against
him. Infectious diseases have beaten
a retreat: diphtheria, whooping-cough,
polio, tetanus, smallpox, plague, typhus
and many other illnesses have declined
sharply in all parts of the world, and
have been virtually eliminated in the
economically developed countries.
Cardiovascular ailments have now
replaced infectious diseases as the
main killers of mankind.
However, many infectious diseases
can still reach epidemic proportions.
As many as 1,000 million cases of
respiratory and intestinal infections
are recorded annually. Asia, Africa
and Latin America are still afflicted by
numerous tropical diseases, and a
whole army of scientists is at work
in many different countries on the
prevention of these diseases. More¬
over, effective measures have still to
be discovered for dealing with such
common infections as influenza, infec¬
tious hepatitis, etc.
How does modern medicine measure
up to this challenge?
We should point out to start with
that man has his own natural system of
defence against microbial attack, with¬
out which the battle against disease
would have been lost long ago.
Special cells mount guard in the blood,
in the walls of the blood vessels, in
the lungs, the liver and the subcuta¬
neous connective tissue, in fact
throughout the human organism.
Any microbe which ventures into the
organism is attacked and consumed
by these cells. These guardian cells
were discovered in 1883 by the great
Russian scientist, llya Mechnikov, who
was the first to observe them doing
battle with microbial invaders and who
named them "phagocytes" (from the
Greek "phagein" to eat).
Phagocytes can move around freely
in the blood or the lymph or remain
fixed, "anchored" to the wall of the r

r vessels. Accordingly, they may either
rush to counterattack the microbe or
else lie in wait to seize and digest it.
The phagocytes provide the organism
with very powerful defences.
This, however, is not the only line
of defence. When an infection enters
the organism, other defensive weapons
known as antibodies, a special kind
of protein substance, are produced as
a reaction to the invasion of foreign
protein bodies (known as "antigens")
which include microbes. The host
organism has a highly developed
ability to distinguish its own protein
18
bodies from aliens
eliminates the latter.
and ruthlessly
Much has
years about
been learnt in recent
the way in which
these defence mechanisms work. The
foreign proteins entering the organism
are identified by special cells, the
lymphocytes, which are produced in
the bone marrow with the help of the
spleen, the lymph nodes and certain
other organs and tissues, and which
are constantly circulating in the blood.
Under certain conditions, some of
these cells change into what are
known as plasma cells, whose prin¬
cipal property is that they can produce
moleculesof the immunoglobulin pro¬
tein from which antibodies are made
at the rate of several thousands a
second. It is these antibodies which
bear the brunt of the struggle against
microbial -attack.
Having entered the human body, the
microbes attempt first of all to repro¬
duce and to spread, at the same time
giving off strong poisons or toxins.
The different varieties of these toxins
may paralyse the nervous system,
affect the intestines, disturb the blood

## [Page 19](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/074842engo.pdf#page=19) 0

### 49690: Here's to our health; microbes to the rescue against hordes of dastardly germs

or cause convulsions. The toxins
also include a complex type of poison
known as aggressin which has the
special function of destroying the
phagocytes.
The antibodies, of which there are
a number of varieties, engage the
aggressors in combat, following their
every manoeuvre, some immobilizing
the microbes, others dissolving them,
and yet others neutralizing the micro¬
bial toxins.
The issue of the battle depends of
course on many factors, and primarily
on the health of the organism, its
readiness to do battle against infection,
and also on the scale of the infection,
i.e. the number of micro-organisms
involved in the attack, the worst
attacks being the so-called "massive,
generalised" infections, whose name
speaks for itself.
If all goes well, however, and the
sick person recovers, a number of
antibodies corresponding to the infec¬
tion from which he has been suffering
remain within his organism, and these
may survive for varying periods, some¬
times throughout his life. Certain
groups of lymphocytes, reproducing
and undergoing "rejuvenation", con¬
serve their ability to produce the immu¬
noglobulin used in the fight against
the defeated enemy.
In "peacetime" the number of such
lymphocytes is limited but they keep
constant watch; should the previous
infection reappear in the organism,
more recruits join the ranks of the
antibodies and together they form an
invincible army which drives the
disease back. In such cases, micro¬
biologists say the person concerned
is "immune" to the disease.
But if the human organism is so
well defended, how can we explain
the millions of deaths referred to
above?
It is true that man has a highly orga¬
nized and extremely sophisticated
defence system, but only when the
defence mechanisms swing into action
against the invader and full-scale pro¬
duction of antibodies begins to give
the organism its needed immunity.
During the first encounters with a
microbial infection, the organism is
engaged in a race against time with
an enemy which holds many advant¬
ages, including its ability to reproduce
rapidly. It was because of these
advantages that infectious diseases
were once such formidable foes.
And so where there is no natural
immunity, it must be created artificially.
This is the basis of vaccination, a
technique which has more than proved
its worth in dealing with infectious
illness.
In vaccination, killed or weakened
micro-organisms of the same type as
those which cause the illness are intro¬
duced in the form of a vaccine into a
healthy subject. After a short, slight
indisposition (as if the person con¬
cerned were suffering a mild form of
the illness), or in some instances
with no effects at all, immunity is set
up in the organism. Sometimes the
operation has to be repeated in order
to remind the organism of the "codes"
of the necessary antibodies.
Drug treatment has become a
second extremely important way of
combatting infectious diseases. The
great German scientist Paul Ehrlich
aptly described the aims of this branch
of microbiology when he said that the
. medicament to fight infection should
possess the properties of a "magic
bullet" which seeks out and destroys
the bacteria without harming the
human organism.
Let us look at two groups of modern
drugs that have proved highly effec¬
tive.
The first group consists of the sulfa
drugs, which were first discovered in
the 1930s but whose use has been
particularly developed in the last .
twenty years. V

k. Sulfa drugs are substances whose
structure is similar to that of certain
nutrients indispensable to bacteria,
but whose composition is somewhat
different. The bacteria swallow these
"tasty" morsels and are killed. (For
the sake of comparison one might
imagine a well-baked bun of appetiz¬
ing appearance but containing large
quantities of sand and sawdust.)
Further improvements are still being
made in sulfa drugs. Their toxicity is
being reduced, their side effects are
being eliminated and new, longer-
acting forms are being developed, so
that users need only take one tablet
daily or even less instead of three
or four.
The second group of drugs, known
as antibiotics, opened a new era in
medicine. The discovery of these
drugs was an extension of the idea
put forward by Pasteur and Mechnikov
of pitting living substances against
living substances, using the substances
produced by certain microbes to kill
others.
With the help of penicillin, the first
of the antibiotics, doctors were able
to overcome meningitis, sepsis, pneu¬
monia and many other ailments. Over
the years, however, an increasing
number of bacteria became resistant
to this antibiotic. New antibiotics
were created, but after a certain time
bacteria which were resistant to these
antibiotics as well appeared.
As the eminent Soviet scientist Boris
Votchal has remarked, a situation has
arisen which recalls that in Jules
Verne's novel "From the Earth to the
Moon" in which one of the characters
(Barbicane) invents increasingly des¬
tructive shells whilst another (Nicholl)
invents stronger and stronger armour
against them.
For a long time, scientists were un¬
able to explain how micro-organisms
became resistant to antibiotics, although
they knew that in general terms resis¬
tance was a temporary or permanent
loss of sensitivity by microbes to the
antibiotics used against them.
Increasing importance in this pro¬
cess is now accorded to the role of
Plasmids (or episomes), genetic ele¬
ments of a particular sort which are
passed on from one generation of
bacteria to another. It is believed that
these plasmids are responsible for the
production by certain micro-organisms
of special enzymes which block the
operation of the antibiotic.
The immediate aim of research is to
devise drugs which act against this
resistance by micro-organisms and
eventually to organize genetic control
in such a way as to neutralize the
factors which lead to resistance.
Many years' experience of mass
vaccination campaigns have shown
their worth in the prevention of nu¬
merous children's and other infections
including parasite-borne forms of
typhus. But there remains the prob¬
lem of side effects and complications
which are no longer admissible given
the present level of medical knowledge.
Among the chief problems here are
allergies hypersensitivity of the orga¬
nism to medicaments, particularly
serums and vaccines and this is why
children are no longer inoculated
during influenza epidemics.
Current progress in science should
make possible the production of im¬
proved chemical vaccines which have
no side effects or complications. A
leading Soviet scientist, Academician
Pavel Zdrodovsky, has developed such
chemical vaccines from "defensive"
antigens to give protection against
typhus and typhoid.
Microbiologists working in many
different countries are now using,
among other things, the cell walls of
microbial cells to make similar vac¬
cines against plague, tularemia, tuber¬
culosis and other diseases.
"Live" vaccines against smallpox,
measles, rabies and certain other
diseases are today being closely
studied by microbiologists. These
vaccines contain additional substances
which play no part in creating immunity.
Recent research has shown, however,
that there is still a possibility that the
micro-organisms used in these vac¬
cines may survive in the organism of
the host, resulting in chronic infection.
Booster doses, although they are
undoubtedly effective in restoring an
immunity that has been reduced, may
possibly affect the organism and hence
should not be administered indiscri¬
minately.
Thus as one problem is solved
another arises. The science of immu¬
nology began with the study of the
living organism's resistance to mi¬
crobes. Charles Nicolle, the famous
French bacteriologist, wrote in the
1930s that future generations would
increasingly be able to defend them¬
selves and their domestic animals
against infectious diseases.
Since that time immunologists have
greatly extended their fields of
research to include problems as vital
to world health as organ and tissue
transplants and the treatment of
cancer.

LIKE plants and animals, micro¬
organisms absorb nutrients from
the environment in order to obtain the
energy they need to put together the
thousands of chemical substances
required for cellular structures, propa¬
gation, movement, etc. They must also
take from the environment building
blocks for the substances they syn¬
thesize in this way.
What distinguishes micro-organisms
from plants and animals in these
functions is their extreme versatility
in making use of a wide variety of
substances in various forms to obtain
the nutrients that they need. It is this
versatility of micro-organisms that has
made possible life on earth as we
know it.
However, it is only now that mankind
is beginning to learn how to tap the
vast potential contained in the genes
of micro-organisms. Just as man
successfully domesticated wild animals
and plants in pastures and fields, he
is now taming and improving the wild
micro-organisms in sophisticated lab¬
oratories and modern factories.
Since graduating from Tokyo Univer¬
sity in 1942, I have been engaged in
microbiological research and in these
past 30 years I have seen spectacu¬
lar advances in the use of micro¬
organisms. One could divide these
accomplishments into three distinct
decades, although in fact the develop¬
ments are closely interwoven.
KEI ARIMA is Professor of Applied Micro¬
biology at the University of Tokyo. His
research In microbiology over the last
30 years has led to a number of important
discoveries, including a new milk-clotting
enzyme now used industrially in cheese-
making. Vice-chairman of the Unesco-
ICRO (International Cell Research Orga¬
nization) Panel on Microbiology, he is also
an adviser on Unesco's project on Regional
Co-operation in Basic Sciences in South
East Asia.
"IQAfl "IQRfl Most of the main anti"
lu'rU'ldüU biotics were discovered
in this decade, and they must be con¬
sidered its characteristic achievement.
The discovery of penicillin by Fleming
was followed by those of streptomycin
(1944, Waksman), Chloromycetin (1947,
Ehrlich), chlortetracyline (1948, Dag¬
ger), and erythromycin (1952, McGuire).
Antibiotics are the chemical sub¬
stances produced by micro-organisms
that can, in minute quantities, kill or
repress the growth of other micro¬
organisms.
While the main use for antibiotics
is the treatment of bacterial infections
(see article page 17) the constant
development of new antibiotics has
enlarged this spectrum somewhat to
include diseases caused by moulds,
rickettsias, and large viruses.
Addition of antibiotics to animal feed
improves growth, but the use of
common antibiotics for this purpose
accelerates the appearance of anti¬
biotic-resistant bacteria. Some anti¬
biotics for use exclusively in animals
have been developed to avoid this
problem.
More recently, rifampycine has
completely changed the treatment of
tuberculosis and probably trachoma
for ever. The antibiotic bleomycin has
been used in the treatment of certain
cancers, and one hopes that more
antibiotics active against cancer will
be found in the future.
inen IQCn The representative
IgülrlSOU achievement of this
period was the use of micro-orga¬
nisms to bring about chemical trans¬
formations difficult or impossible to
perform by normal chemical reactions.
In 1950, for example, Philip Hench,
a U.S. physician, reported that the
hormone cortisone had a remarkable
effect when used in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, thus creating a
big demand for cortisone.
In the production of cortisone from
progesterone, one particular transform¬
ation required 10 different chemical
reactions, each with a very low yield.
In 1956, Peterson successfully car¬
ried out this transformation by fermen
tation in one step, with nearly 100 per
cent yield, by means of the mould
Rhyzopus nigricans. Since then
microbes have been used in the
production of many other steroid
hormones.
1QRfl 1Q7Í1 Research during this
I aUU- 1 3 f U decade led to the large-
scale production of amino acids and
nucleotides by microbial fermentation.
Amino acids are the building blocks of
protein, and nucleotides are the con¬
stituents of RNA (ribonucleic acid),
which plays a crucial role in trans¬
mitting the genetic messages in living
cells (see article page 5).
Boosting the food value of cereals.
Of the 20 amino acids nine are
essential to man. The reason why
cereal protein is inferior to animal
protein is that it lacks certain of the
essential amino acids. The nutritive
value of a cereal diet can thus be
improved by supplementing it with
these missing amino acids.
Although the essential amino acids
can be synthesized chemically, this
process is wasteful because it pro¬
duces two different forms of each
which are difficult to separate from
each other. Conveniently, micro¬
organisms produce the biologically
active form alone.
The problem with using micro-organ¬
isms to produce amino acids commer¬
cially is that precise control mechan¬
isms stop the micro-organisms from
making more than the organisms need
for themselves. In some cases, when
the concentration of an amino acid
reaches a certain level, this checks
further synthesis, through a process
known as feedback inhibition.
Although we may admire the remark¬
able precision of these natural controls,
we must find ways to avoid, turn aside,
or remove them if we wish to
have the micro-organisms produce
large amounts of amino acids for us.
We must find ways, as it were, to
insert a tiny screwdriver into a pre¬
cision machine only one thousandth of
a millimetre in size, in order to change
the direction of metabolism.
This problem has received particu¬
lar attention from Japanese micro- ^

biologists, who have developed many
ingenious methods to do just that.
In 1956, S. Kinoshita, S. Udaka,
K. Tanaka, and K. Nakayama suc¬
ceeded in isolating a bacterium that,
when cultured under the proper con¬
ditions, can produce large quantities
of the well-known flavouring agent,
glutamic acid, from glucose.
Irradiation of this same bacterium
produced a mutant through which it is
possible to obtain large quantities of
a substance known as lysine.
The importance of lysine lies in the
fact that it is one of three essential
amino acids that are absent from
cereals. Addition of .25 per cent of
lysine to wheat or corn flour improves
their biological value, which then
becomes equivalent to that of milk.
The use of lysine as an additive has
proved its worth in animal rearing.
Giving flavour to tasteless foods.
Even in ancient times, seaweed and
dried bonito were used in Japan for
seasoning food. Since the early
1900s, it has been known that the
component responsible for the flavour¬
ing qualities of seaweed is glutamic
acid, and that of bonito is the histidine
salt of inosinic acid.
The production of glutamic acid
became a large industry, but nothing
much was done about inosinic acid
until 1955, when K. Sakaguchi and
A. Kuninaka discovered two strong
flavouring agents that, when mixed
with glutamate, have a more powerful
effect than when either is used alone.
The production of these agents thus
became desirable, and once again it
was a micro-organism, a mould, that
made this possible. This mould uses
one of its enzymes to decompose yeast
RNA (produced from the wastes of the
woodpulp industry) into the desired
flavouring agents. This same enzyme
is also found in snake venom, but it
is of course much more practical to
use the mould.
Thanks to the large-scale production
of these flavouring agents, much
tasteless food can be made more
palatable thus helping to meet the
world's food needs.
Enzymes and a cheese-making revol¬
ution. In living cells, proteins known as
enzymes accelerate or "catalyze"
reactions that lead to the synthesis
of amino acids and nucleotides
("building blocks" of cell molecules).
Some 1,500 different kinds of enzymes
are known and each carries out a
specific job in the processes of
synthesis or breakdown. Some of the
enzymes themselves are produced
commercially for various purposes:
to convert starch into glucose, to
clear apple juice, etc. But recently
enzymes obtained from micro-organ¬
isms have found new uses.
Ten per cent of the world's milk
supply is used for the manufacture of
some five million tons of cheese each
year. The most important step in the
conversion of milk to cheese is coagu¬
lation of the protein, and this step is
traditionally set off by the addition of
rennet, an enzyme obtained from the
stomach of suckling calves.
Formerly, some forty million calves
were slaughtered annually for rennet.
As a consequence of the beef shortage
of the last decade, farmers now prefer
to raise the calves for one or two
years. Since cheese production has
doubled in the past fifteen years, the
industry now faces a shortage of
rennet.
In 1960, S. Iwasaki and I succeeded
in isolating a mould that was able to
produce a powerful rennet-like enzyme
in large quantities. Just one gramme
of the purified preparation is enough to
make 700 kilogrammes of cheese.
A microbe has thus not only helped
to transform the dairy industry, but has
also added to the world supply of beef.
Protein from paraffin. Micro¬
organisms have the ability to multiply
and to synthesize protein from a
number of waste products of industrial
processes. They are also able to
make protein at speeds several
thousand times greater than can plants
and animals.
In 1963, A. Champagnat reported
that a yeast strain could be used for
the industrial production of a protein
known as single-cell protein (SCP)
from oil-paraffin, a waste product of
production from crude oil.
SCP has a good balance of the
essential amino acids, and is rich in
vitamins. It has -^a nutritive value
similar to that of fish meal or beans,
and has been successfully tested for
safety on pigs and chickens.
If all the available paraffin drawn
from current world oil production were
converted to protein, the yield would
be some 700 million tons per year.
Large scale production of SCP would
also occupy considerably less land
area than many other methods envis¬
aged for the solution of the world food
problem. Each year, a population
increase of 70 million requires two
million tons of additional protein. If
this protein were to come from
soybeans, forty million hectares of land
would be necessary just to produce
the extra 2 million tons. With large-
scale use of SCP, two thousand tanks,
each having .a 200 cubic metre ca¬
pacity, would suffice to make the
additional two million tons, and these
would occupy less than one hectare
of land.
Population. One of the most im¬
portant aids in family planning is the
contraceptive pill. Most of such
pills are composed of two steroid
hormones derived from a chemical
substance extracted from a yam that
grows wild in mountainous areas of
Mexico and Central America. An
estimated 700 tons of this sub¬
stance are produced yearly, but its cost
is rising rapidly due to the fact that
the wild plant has been overpicked,
and cultivation is long and difficult.
There are, however, other natural
substances with a steroid structure
that might be converted into the steroid
hormones. Cholesterol is such a sub¬
stance. It is extracted from the fats
of sheep wool in large amounts
(70,000 tons per year).
It is extremely difficult to convert
cholesterol to the desired hormones
by conventional chemical methods.
So ten years ago, M. Nagasawa and
I started to look for micro-organisms
capable of performing this delicate
feat. We eventually succeeded in
isolating a bacterium which was grown
in the presence of chemicals that would
selectively inhibit enzymes responsible
for the splitting of the carbon bonds
of cholesterol.
After screening about 200 chemicals,
we found one chemical whose proper¬
ties made possible the efficient pro¬
duction of androstane. Since andro-
stane can be easily converted into
other steroid hormones, we hope that
the industrialization of this process
will contribute to a more general
availability of:
Oral contraceptives.
Adrenal hormones, used in the treat¬
ment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as
other types of inflammation.
Hormones that accelerate the devel¬
opment of body tissue in man and
animals. In man they are used to
stimulate recovery after tissue damage,
such as that occurring during surgery;
in animals they are used to increase
meat production.
Male and female sex hormones
used for substitution therapy, particu¬
larly in old age.
Microbiology and the environment.
Micro-organisms also have a major
role to play in cleaning up the environ¬
ment. They figure largely in the three
main techniques of sewage treatment:
the active sludge method, filtration,
and fermentation (see article page 29).
In the active sludge method, liquid
wastes are cultured at a temperature
that induces the multiplication of bac¬
teria and protozoa. These micro¬
organisms are then imbedded in slime,
making clumps that absorb organic and
inorganic substances, which, in the
presence of oxygen, are decomposed
to carbon dioxide and water. ' The
greatest defect of this method is that
the large number of microbial cells
produced gives rise to a secondary
pollution.
An alternative is the trickling or
filtration method. Wastes are dis¬
tributed over the surface of stones or
blocks, which rapidly become covered
with a thin film of slime. In this slime
are micro-organisms that provide for
very efficient oxidation. The wastes
are decomposed in the deeper layers
of the stones. This method is similar
to the process that occurs naturally
in rivers. It is simple, inexpensive,
and does not produce excessive
amounts of sludge. It is relatively
slow, however, unless energy is
available for recycling.

The two types of waste treatment
mentioned above require the presence
of an adequate amount of air. The
third method, methane fermentation,
takes place in a closed tank from
which oxygen is excluded. In this
method, one type of bacteria convert
organic wastes to substances such as
organic acids. Methane bacteria then
convert the organic acids to methane
and carbon dioxide.
The disadvantage of this method is
that it is slow: 10 days are normally
required for the complete breakdown
of wastes. The advantage is that more
than 80 per cent of the energy in the
wastes can be recovered as methane
gas, which can be used as a clean
fuel. We thus come to yet another of
the world's major problems that micro¬
organisms may help to solve.
Energy from microbes. If the
total amount of wastes from human
beings and livestock in the United
States were decomposed by methane
fermentation, an estimated three per
cent of the total current U.S. energy
requirement could be met.
Moreover, it is calculated that if
algae were cultivated expressly for
the purpose of methane fermentation
on five per cent of the U.S. land area,
they would provide enough raw mat¬
erial for methane to satisfy all to the
country's energy needs in the year
2020.
These operations by micro-organ¬
isms depend on their ability to decom¬
pose other substances. But scientists
have tended to concentrate on the
synthetic abilities of micro-organisms
and have done little to improve upon
their natural properties.
For example, when the mould
Pénicillium notatum was first discov¬
ered, it yielded 20 units of penicillin per
millilitre. Subsequent "domestication"
of this mould increased yields a thou¬
sandfold. In the use of micro-organ¬
isms for decomposition processes we
can point to no similar successes.
Microbiologists ought now to attack
such problems as:
The development of efficient meth¬
ods to convert nitrates to atmospheric
nitrogen, as nitrates from sewage
plants and agriculture are overfértil-
izing our rivers and lakes, causing
oxygen deficiency and putrefaction.
The development of an active
sludge method in which the energy
obtained by bacterial decomposition
does not go into the production of
excess sludge.
' Selection of micro-organisms that
are especially adapted to the decompo¬
sition of polymers and toxic sub¬
stances.
Although we have made many ad¬
vances in the domestication of micro¬
organisms, the process has only just
begun. Since their appearance on
earth, four billion years ago, micro¬
organisms have gone through infinite
generations and have adapted to every
conceivable environment on this earth.
As a result, they contain a vast
library of information as to how various
physical and chemical challenges can
best be met. This information is now
within our reach, and should make it
possible to attack many of mankind's
most pressing problems.

### 49696: Perfect match with animal, vegetable and mineral; how micro-organisms make possible an extraordinary array of partnerships in nature

Perfect match with animal,
vegetable and mineral
How micro-organisms make possible
an extraordinary array of partnerships in Nature
by John Roger Porter
FEW people realize that various
kinds of associations, ranging
from beneficial to competitive, exist
among all forms of life from the
smallest microbe to the largest plants
and animals.
These associations are not only
responsible for the delicate balance
that occurs in nature between living
creatures and between them and their
environment but actually control the
cycles in nature on which life on earth
depends (see article page 26).
Many thousands of species of micro¬
scopic organisms exist in nature and
they may interact with each other, or
with higher forms of life. In so doing
they produce either neutral, beneficial
or harmful effects, or bring about some
intermediate changes on one another
or on the environment.
One of the best-known examples of
a beneficial relationship between two
microbes is the lichen, in which an
alga and a fungus combine as partners
to form a plantlike structure that grows
slowly until it finally becomes visible
to the naked eye.
The alga and the fungus may be
cultivated separately in the laboratory,
but in nature they are found living
together as a lichen, which was once
thought to be a single organism.
Lichens are widespread in nature,
appearing on surfaces of rocks, trees,
JOHN ROGER PORTER, U.S. microbio¬
logist, is Chairman of the Unesco-ICRO
(International Cell Research Organization)
Panel on Microbiology. Professor of Micro¬
biology at the University of Iowa, he is
noted for his discovery of the functions of
vitamins in bacterial nutrition. He has
published many studies in the field of
microbiology and from 1951 to 1961 was
editor-in-chief of the Journal of Bacteriology
(published in the USA). For many years he
has promoted the application of microbiology
in the developing countries.
and other solid objects. In extreme
environments such as deserts and
polar regions, they may be the pre¬
dominant forms of life, since they are
remarkably resistant to heat, cold and
desiccation.
Because of their slow growth,
lichens can be used by geologists to
estimate the age of glacial deposits
in certain regions. Also lichens are
extremely sensitive to air pollutants
and quickly disappear from some
industrial areas as the quality of the
environment declines. They may thus
be used by ecologists as an early-
warning system, signaling environ¬
mental deterioration.
Micro-organisms frequently have a
beneficial association with higher
forms of life, since plants and animals
may provide favourable environments
for their growth. But because various
parts of a plant, or organs of an
animal, differ physically and chemically,
certain environments exist that favour
some kinds of microbes and not others.
Plants and animals also possess a
variety of defence mechanisms that
may prevent or inhibit the invasion and
growth of some microbes.
The leaves and stems of many plants
which are subjected to dry weather
possess a waxy coating that helps to
retain moisture and, incidentally, may
be responsible for the small number
of microbes on their surfaces and
for preventing micro-organisms from
invading the inner plant tissues.
Tropical freshwater and marine
plants may have larger numbers of
microbes on their leaves and stems
because they grow in a moist environ¬
ment and they frequently suffer from
disease or other harmful effects
caused by micro-organisms.
The roots of plants are in an environ¬
ment where moisture is usually less
variable and nutrients are more abun¬
dant than in the air. The roots are
continuously in association with mi¬
crobes, some of which have little
influence on the normal growth of
plants, whereas others may be highly
beneficial. Others, again, may be very
harmful as in the case of diseases of
cereals, fruit trees and garden plants.
One of the most interesting and
important relationships among micro¬
organisms and the roots of plants is
that between legumes and bacteria of
the genus Rhizobium (which means
root dweller).
Legumes include such economically
important plants as alfalfa, clover,
lupins, beans, peas, and the soybean.
Appropriate strains of rhizobia are
capable of invading the roots of these
legumes, with the formation of nodules.
In the nodules the bacteria obtain
nutrients, such as sugars, from the
plants and in turn convert atmospheric
nitrogen (which plants cannot use) into
ammonia which is then transformed
into amino-acids, the building blocks
of all proteins.
This process is called nitrogen
fixation and is often cited as one of
the best examples of symbiosis or
mutual benefit. It is one of the most
important biological interactions that
occurs in nature. Estimates are that
about 10 billion tons of nitrogen are
fixed annually in the world by living
organisms, most of it by this process.
Neither legumes nor rhizobia are
able to fix nitrogen alone, yet the
symbiotic interaction between the two
results in making atmospheric nitrogen
available for plants, and provides
proteins for man and other animals.
Another type of symbiosis between
plants and microbes is the mycorrhiza
root. This is an association between
a fungus and the young feeder roots

of plants, whereby the fungus may
greatly increase the efficiency of
nutrient uptake by the plant roots.
Many different types of mycorrhizal
associations exist, although few have
been exploited up to the present.
They hold great promise for conserving
scarce and expensive plant nutrients,
and for economising on fertiliser use
in the future.
Indeed, some legumes are known
which can support two distinct sym¬
biotic systems at the same time one
for nitrogen fixation and the other for
nutrient gathering from the soil.
Bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses
cause many diseases in plants. In
fact, losses in the production of food,
fibre, and forest products each year
are so enormous that the control of
the harmful effects of microbes in
agriculture and forestry is one of
today's great problems.
Insects and microbes have a wide
variety of associations, some beneficial
and some harmful to each. Certain
wood-boring beetles live on the fungi
they deposit in their tunnels, and some
ants cultivate fungi as part of their life
activities. In other cases the micro¬
organisms live within the bodies of
insects, such as the protozoa that
digest cellulose in the intestine of the
termite.
Insects are also subject to microbial
diseases, and practical advantage is
being taken of this to produce bio-
insecticides to control certain insect
pests on food crops and trees.
Most of the microbes are highly
specific for a particular insect, and are
virtually harmless to other forms of
life in contrast to almost all currently
registered chemical insecticides.
Many small freshwater and marine
animals, ranging from protozoa to
worms and molluscs and from sponges
to higher invertebrates, have a close
association with certain micro-organ¬
isms, especially green algae that are
capable of using sunlight as a source
of energy. In such cases the algae
synthesize food in a manner similar to
that of higher plants for the animals,
and in turn they receive nutrients from
their aquatic animal partners.
Animals, and especially mammals,
almost always possess a "normal"
microbial flora, especially in those
regions of the body which are exposed
to the outside world such as the skin,
oral cavities, upper respiratory tract,
and the intestinal tract.
If you examine a small drop of saliva
through a powerful microscope, you
will be amazed at the number and
variety of micro-organisms to be seen
on the slide. We are not certain about
the functions of the flora on the skin,
or in the mouth and upper respiratory
tract, but in the intestine we know that
microbes may help digest food and
synthesize important vitamins for the
host body.
Micro-organisms are not usually
found in the organs or the blood and
lymph systems of the body; when they
are found in such tissues in significant
numbers they usually indicate the
presence of disease.
Perhaps one of the most interesting
beneficial relationships existing bet¬
ween microbes and animals occurs
in ruminants. Cows, sheep, goats,
camels, deer, and giraffes possess a
special organ known as the rumen, in
which the digestion of complex plant
materials (cellulose, etc.) occurs
through the activity of special mi¬
crobes. Food entering the rumen
mixes with the teeming microbial popu¬
lation and remains there for about 8 to
9 hours.
During this time the cellulose and
other complex carbohydrates are
broken down by several species of
bacteria and protozoa into sugars,
which then undergo the process of
fermentation to give various organic
acids, and the gases carbon dioxide
and methane.
The organic acids are absorbed and

### 49697: Our oldest ancestors, the microbes: the first inhabitants on the earth, microbes have been the architects and custodians of our planet for four billion years

OUR OLDEST ANCESTORS,
THE MICROBES
The first inhabitants on the earth,
microbes have been the architects
and custodians of our planet
for four billion years
by Jan Wilhelm M. La Rivière
ICROBES were the first settlers
on earth. The oldest and
smallest coins in the money of life,
they arose out of complex organic
matter, abundantly present in the
oceans some 4,000,000,000 years ago,
and can rightfully be considered the
ancestors of all other forms of life
including man.
Life attained all its past and present
diversity by the process of evolution
in which random genetic changes
(mutations) created variations from
which the environment could select
those new forms of life that were best
fitted to survive in it.
Since microbes have played a
dominating role in shaping our present
environment, especially in determining
the composition of the atmosphere,
they have influenced life on earth in
two ways: by providing molecules that
could transfer the "memory" of ances¬
tral experience, the primordial genetic
material, and by taking part indirectly
in the selection process exerted by
the environment they had helped to
build.
The dual role of the microbial world
is not only an important historic
curiosity. Today, no less than in the
past, all higher forms of life depend
entirely for their survival on the
continuous activities of the invisible
microbial world.
The interrelationships of the king¬
doms of life are strikingly manifest in

of the Netherlands is Chairman of the inter¬
national Commission on Microbial Ecology

biological Societies. Secretary of the
Unesco-ICRO (International Cell Research
Organization) Panel on Microbiology, he

water recovery especially for the developing
countries.
the cycles of carbon, of oxygen, of
nitrogen and of sulphur, four elements
that together with hydrogen, phos¬
phorus and several others compose
the substances from which all life is
made. These cycles are the mechan¬
isms by which dead organic matter is
converted again into building blocks
for new life processes in which mi¬
crobes are the main "pumps".
A simplified version of the carbon
cycle is shown in the cartoons on
page 28. In this cycle, thirty to fifty
per cent of the organic matter pro¬
duced by photosynthesis (by which
green plants use the energy of sunlight
to turn carbon dioxide and water into
food substances) is the work of mi¬
croscopic algae (plankton) inhabiting
the oceans.
By decomposing dead animal and
vegetable matter, microbes are in fact
responsible for the return of about
90 per cent of all carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere.
If this process of mineralization were
to come to a standstill, the carbon
dioxide content of the atmosphere
would drop to zero within a century
and plants would no longer be able
to grow. Thus microbes provide the
basis for marine productivity plankton
being the first stage in the marine food
chain and are at the same time the
main agents responsible for the natural
decomposition of wastes.
All animal life depends on that of
the plants, but after death both
inevitably fall prey to the microbes
that decompose them. In some cases
this microbial attack starts before
death has occurred, and such over-
zealous microbes (or pathogens) are
known to us as the carriers of
infectious disease.
However, out of the total mass of
all microbes on earth, which is of the
same order of magnitude as that of
the higher forms of life, pathogens
amount to less than 0.1 per cent.
Sometimes the decomposition pro¬
cesses proceed incompletely and
slowly, particularly if oxygen is in short
supply or absent, as at the bottom of
a lake, or when pressure is high, as
is the case at the bottom of the
oceans. Incomplete decomposition in
such cases can form products such
as humus and also fossil fuels like oil
and methane.
The important thing to remember is
that the process of photosynthesis
produces exactly the amount of oxygen
that will later be required for the
mineralization process. This clearly
demonstrates the close interrelation¬
ship between the cycles of carbon and
of oxygen.
We can say, first of all, therefore,
that all free oxygen present in the
atmosphere is fully balanced by the
total mass of organic matter on earth.
Fortunately, there is so much finely
dispersed organic material present in
many types of sediments that even if
all the world's fossil fuels were burned
by man the oxygen in our atmospheric
"bank account" would drop in con¬
centration only from 20.94 to 20.80 per
cent.
Nitrogen, like other elements used
by plants and animals, passes through
a cycle of chemical changes and
eventually returns to its original form.
The nitrogen cycle actually consists
of two cycles. One of them is confined
to water and soil. Inorganic nitrogen
compounds are released by microbes
from dead plants and animals and thus
provide nitrogenous material for the
synthesis of new plants.
As in the case of the carbon cycle,
we and the other animals "take a ride"
on the back of plants.
The second part of the cycle is due

### 49698: The Earth's invisible garbage men

THE EARTH'S
INVISIBLE
GARBAGE MEN
by Albert Sasson
ICRO-ORGANISMS cause vari-
1 ous forms of pollution (by
proliferating in water and industrial
wastes, by corroding stone and thus
damaging buildings, or by contaminat¬
ing food) bur they are indispensable
for getting rid of solid organic wastes
or those suspended in water.
The . purification and recycling of
waste waters is indeed the most
important operation of industrial micro¬
biology, not only for reasons of hygiene
but also to enable us to use water
economically.
The biological purification process
begins after the liquid waste has been
settled and when the sludge is fed
into a digestion tank, where it under¬
goes fermentation, producing methane
which is mixed with town gas, thus
increasing the heating power of the gas.
The product of this process, digested
sludge, contains many nutrients and
for this reason it is often added to
household refuse to enrich the compost
which results from the decomposition
of such refuse.
In several countries active research
is being pursued on the growth of
certain species of single-cell algae in
waste water. The Japanese, for
instance, have built a plant in which
algae absorb the carbon dioxide in
dirty water, thus producing 9,087 litres
of clean water and 27 kg. of algae
daily. The algae are concentrated and
added to animal feed. Similar experi¬
ments have been carried out in
ALBERT SASSON, Moroccan microbio¬
logist, is a consultant at present working
with Unesco's Division of Ecological
Sciences. Formerly a professor at the
faculty of sciences, Rabat. Morocco, he is
the author of several books and studies on
development and environment, the role of
micro-organisms in the biosphere and the
future of applied microbiology.
Czechoslovakia at a research station
belonging to Prague's Institute of
Microbiology.
Household refuse and the digested
sludge obtained from sewage can be
fermented in special factories which
produce composts rich in bio-de-
gradable organic matter, providing not
only an excellent natural fertilizer but
also improving the physical properties
of the soil.
In European countries, an average
of between 650 grammes and a kilo
of rubbish per inhabitant is produced
each day. The corresponding figure
in urban areas of sub-tropical Brazil is
600 grammes and in Rabat (Morocco),
an estimated 500 grammes. In small
towns and villages in the tropics and
sub-tropics, it is much less (about
250 grammes daily).
When such refuse is fresh, each
gramme contains millions of microbes.
Pathogenic microbes and parasites
are killed off in the various stages of
decomposition, leaving a compost
containing antibiotic substances and
microbes which are not antagonistic
to those already existing in the soil.
The processing and composting of
such household refuse produces
roughly 40 to 50 kg. of compost for
each 100 kg. of refuse.
Added to the soil in varying doses
(20 to 40 metric tons per hectare) the
compost has a marked effect on its
physical properties. Incorporated with
sandy soils, it increases their capacity
to retain. water and fertilizers and thus
improves crop yields (by 15 to 20 per
cent in the case of citrus fruit trees).
It also increases the permeability of
heavy soils, preventing them from
turning to mud in rainy weather, and
considerably reduces erosion on hill
slopes.
A town of 100,000 to 150,000 in¬
habitants may produce 50 to 100 tons
of untreated refuse, and hence 17 to
25 tons of compost daily.
High-grade ores of copper, nickel,
chrome, tin and molybdenum are
becoming increasingly hard to find,
and it is not an economic proposition
to process low-grade ores in the same
way as high- and middle-grade ones.
Certain microbes can, however, be
used in the extraction of these metals
after the ores have been dissolved
in water or sulphuric acid.
Sulphides, to take a well-known
example, are often leached from the
soil by natural means and furnish
metal-rich solutions. Copper was
being extracted from water in this way
in the Isle of Anglesey (Wales) as
early as the 16th century and from
water which had drained off the land
in the Rio Tinto area of south-west
Spain some 300 years ago.
It was also in the Rio Tinto region
that a bacterium similar to Thiobacillus
ferroxldans was isolated some years
ago. The same species had been
discovered in the course of studies
carried out in the coal mines of
Pennsylvania: the high acidity of the
mining effluents was killing off veg¬
etation in the neighbourhood and it
was during investigation of the nature
of the process responsible that the
bacterium was isolated from the
solvent used for leaching the pyrites
contained in the coal.
An identical microbe was sub¬
sequently isolated from the copper-
rich water in Bingham Canyon, Utah
(site of the largest open-cut copper
mine in North America). Laboratory
research showed that sulphurated ores
containing at least eight metals can
be attacked by this micro-organism.
Some idea of the importance of this
process of microbial leaching can be
gained from the fact that in 1966 the
copper mines of the United States W

u
produced 370,000,000 metric
tons of mine waste containing small
quantities of metal. In 1965, ten per
cent of the country's copper output
was extracted by means of microbial
treatment from these wastes.
The copper thus recovered is esti¬
mated to have cost $1,000 per ton
against a world market price of $1 ,400.
On this reckoning, if 50 per cent of
the copper contained in a million tons
of mine waste of 0.3 per cent metal
content could be recovered, the
operation would make a profit of
$600,000.
Microbial leaching is thus seen to
be an economically viable process, and
Is in fact practised in ten countries,
including Mexico, U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.,
where at least eleven mines are using it.
Thlobacilli and also iron bacteria
can also be used in the extraction of
uranium from certain ores such as
brannerite. The uranium dissolves as
uranyl sulphate, from which it can be
extracted by various methods.
By 1985, when it is expected that
world demand for uranium will have
increased ten-fold, extraction by means
of biological leaching should be a fully
economic proposition.
At Stanrock, In Canada, for example,
seven and a half tons of uranium oxide
are extracted every month simply by
spraying the walls of the underground
galleries, where the microbes are
already at work. The solution is
pumped up to the surface without the
miners having to handle and shift vast
quantities of ore of little value, as must
be. done in the case of more conven¬
tional extraction techniques.
Sweden possesses large deposits of
shales which contain uranium in small
quantities. With the indirect help of
bacteria, it would certainly be possible
to concentrate the uranium; the cost
should not be exorbitant in view of the
fact that one ton of uranium is worth
more than $16,000.
Using heterotrophic bacteria, which
require organic substances as food, it
has been possible to dissolve out the
gold contained in some latente
deposits of West Africa. An organic
compound produced by the bacteria,
and soluble in butanol, apparently
combines with the gold.
At the Irkutsk Institute of Rare
Metals, Soviet scientists studying bio-
metallurgical processes for dissolving
and precipitating gold report that
within 20 Hours 30 per cent of the gold
Is dissolved out of the ore.
In the case of manganese, the ores
generally used are oxides, manganite
and pyrolusite. Oxidation, which can
be either a chemical or a biochemical
process, is in this instance effected by
two classes of iron bacteria. Leaching
carried out when an advanced state of
corrosion has been reached makes it
possible to extract manganese from
low-grade ores.
The use of micro-organisms to
extract certain metals has a number
of advantages: little or no energy Is
required, relatively little investment is
involved, and the reagents employed
are very cheap. On the other hand,
it is a slow technique and in order to
be profitable has to be used in con¬
junction with or as a follow-up to nor¬
mal methods.
Lastly, it should be pointed out that
this aspect of applied microbiology
calls for co-operative research in
geology, mineralogy, biochemistry and
microbiology and in various, branches
of the mining industry.

APPLIED
MICROBIOLOGY
by Edgar J. DaSilva
and Fabian Fernandes
EDGAR J. DASILVA, Indian microbio¬
logist, is Vice-President of the World Fed¬
eration for Culture Collections. He is cur¬
rently assisting Unesco's Unit of Life
Sciences in developing the Unesco-ICRO
(International Cell Research Organization)
programme in applied microbiology for
developing countries.
FABIAN FERNANDES, Indian microbio¬
logist, is Assistant Secretary-General of the
International Association of Microbiological
Societies and Head of the department of
microbiology at the CIBA-Geigy Research
Centre, Bombay (India). A member of the
Unesco-ICRO Panel on Microbiology, he is
at present promoting new teaching methods
in microbiology for use in the developing
countries.
THE role of applied microbiology
and microbes in development
and technological progress is unique.
Applied microbiology offers the devel¬
oping countries great scope for
progress since many of the resources
and conditions needed for its use are
readily available in these countries.
With its branches in cellular, mol¬
ecular, genetic and radiation biological
research and its uses in agriculture,
industry, engineering and medicine,
microbiology is a field that above all
calls for international co-operation.
For this reason Unesco has set up
a world-wide programme of research
in microbiology as well as in cell and
molecular biology during the past
20 years. In 1962 it helped to establish
the International Cell Research Organ¬
ization (ICRO) with which it has been
co-operating ever since.
These branches of the life sciences
are directly linked to the solution of
three major world problems food
production and distribution, population
growth and the spread and improve¬
ment of science education.
Unesco and the ICRO panel on
microbiology have launched an inter¬
national programme to promote re¬
search on micro-organisms that
operates through training courses, the
exchange of scientists, specialized
symposia and conferences (1).
To promote co-operation between
microbiologists in industrially-devel¬
oped and developing countries, four
major international conferences which
have been given the name Global
Impacts of Applied Microbiology
(GIAMs) have been held during the
past 12 years.
The first of these conferences, held
in Stockholm (Sweden) in 1963, was
attended by scientists, administrators,
government officials and science po¬
licy decision-makers from many coun¬
tries. It focussed on the microbial
production of vitamins, amino acids
and antibiotics for non-medical use
and microbial enzyme production.
The second conference took place at
Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) in 1967. A ^
large number of African microbiologists r

engineering, the Overseas Technical Co¬

### 49699: A UNESCO world network for applied microbiology

Letter to a budding
My young friend,
I address this letter to you and to
your student friends, who sense the
chilly winds of change, and who now
search for a challenge far removed
from the tenets of conventional wisdom.
After all, conventional wisdom has
bred the belief that by.some miracle
by the sheer momentum .of traditional
ideologies and institutions we will all
gently be lifted over the mountains of
global problems.
Personally I think that their solution
requires, among other things, much
more creative thinking about the mo¬
bilization of science for society than
we have seen so far and a systematic
expansion of certain key branches of
science.
The branch I would like to con¬
centrate on here is microbiology,
because it links the life-giving leaves
of molecular biology to the mighty
CARL-GORAN HÉDEN, Swedish bacte¬
riologist, is Chairman of the Department of
Bacteriology and Bioengineering at the
Karolinska Institute, Stockholm (Sweden).
He is at present engaged on research into the
peaceful uses of microbes, microbial energy
and automated microbial technology for
quality control of foods and environmental
monitoring. Chairman of the International
Advisory Committee on the Global Impacts
of Applied Microbiology Programme, he is a

Cell Research Organization) Panel on Mi¬
crobiology.
trunk of technology. Also it offers a
thought-provoking example of how the
destructive potential of certain short¬
sighted applications of science can be
switched over to meet great social
needs.
The U.N. biological weapons dis¬
armament convention is, in fact, the
first example of an international agree¬
ment that not only eliminates an exis¬
ting weapons system but also under¬
lines ways of redeploying it for man's
benefit (1).
Improved environmental management
by biological pest-control, waste re¬
cycling and a better distribution of
energy production units as well as new
"wonder drugs" and cheap foods
produced by fermentation, are just a
few of the opportunities which now
offer themselves.
The most important of these may
be the various microbiological pro¬
cesses that can provide an "inter¬
mediate technology" appropriate for
countries which have little industry but
where large-scale farming can provide
substrates for the growth of useful
microbes.
People disfigured by leishmaniosis,
weakened by malaria and susceptible
to other infectious diseases because
of malnutrition offer a challenge to

applied microbiology and to the United
Nations bodies concerned with mo¬
bilizing micro-organisms for various
peaceful purposes.
Nowadays we read so much about
social deprivation and environmental
deterioration that we forget that the
last century has witnessed an un¬
precedented growth in opportunities
and life expectancy.
It is often claimed that increased life
expectancy is largely due to the impact
of antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents
and vaccines.
However, if we compare the numbers
of children in the U.K. who died from
tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlatina and
pneumonia in 1940 (before modern
antibiotics and vaccination campaigns)
with the equivalent figures for 1900,
we find an enormous improvement had
already taken place. The ratios bet¬
ween 1900 and 1940 are respectively
537: 24 (tuberculosis), 215: 5 (diph¬
theria), 313: 3 (scarlatina), 2450: 990
(pneumonia). These figures are for
deaths per 100,000 children up to the
age of one.
If we go back as far as 1840, the
effects of social evolution are seen
to be even more striking. A child born
in England at that time had an average
life expectancy of 21 years (if born in
a one-room home) as compared with
40 years in families with four-room
homes.
Though this is worth remembering, it
in no way diminishes the historical
impact microbiology has had on such
> took part and the conference ma'de" a
considerable contribution to the dev¬
elopment of microbiology in Africa.
As a result of discussions during the
conference, a research programme on
the large-scale manufacture of the
food-producing alga Splrulina was later
carried out at Osaka University, Japan.
The results of this research and
other experiments were presented at
the third conference, in Bombay (In¬
dia) in 1969. The Bombay conference
led to the setting up of specialized
university departments of microbiology
at Bombay and Goa and the creation
of a biennial fellowship at the Univer¬
sity of Bombay.
The 1969 conference also encouraged
microbiologists from Japan, Mexico,
the Philippines, Czechoslovakia, India,
Israel, the Netherlands, U.S.A. and
U.S.S.R. to study in depth the pro¬
duction of Single-cell protein (SCP)
from carbohydrate wastes and petro¬
leum, a field of research in which
Unesco has collaborated with the
Protein Advisory Group of the U.N.
The future of microbiology in the
developing countries was an impor¬
tant theme of the fourth international
conference, held at Säo Paulo (Brazil)
in 1973. The conference also led to
the organization of several courses
in other parts of Brazil, on which many
conference delegates taught. In addi¬
tion symposia were held on such sub¬
jects as teaching and training in
microbiology and the future of micro¬
biology in the developing world.
These conferences and training
courses have given scientists from
the industrially developed countries
a better understanding of the problems
faced by their colleagues in the dev¬
eloping countries and an awareness of
the existing skills and technologies in
these areas.
The next conference on the global
impacts of applied microbiology is to
be held in 1976 at Kuala Lumpur (Ma¬
laysia). It will focus on problems in
energy and industrial microbiology, the
quality of life, food microbiology, the
conservation of valuable micro-organ¬
isms and basic microbiology.
Already studies are being made on
the nitrogen economy of soils, in Africa
by Prof. Aba Ayanaba (Nigeria) in
Brazil by Prof. Johanna Dobereiner, in
Indonesia by Dr. Susono Saono and at
the Biological Research Centre of the
Hungarian Academy of Sciences by
Dr. Adam Kondorosi and Unesco
consultant Prof. Rollin Hotchkiss.
Under the Unesco-ICRO programme
long-term and short-term training
courses have been organized in the
Arab Republic of Egypt, Brazil, Cze¬
choslovakia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria and
Sri Lanka. These courses have
stressed the importance of microbial
engineering and fermentation tech¬
nology for national development.

developments as the global movement
of people and goods and the dissemi¬
nation of ideas. These developments
obviously called for the control of
major epidemic diseases, and efforts
in this direction have been so success¬
ful that, in a few years time, and
providing no wars intervene, a disease
such as smallpox will have been
eradicated.
Because it has taught us to domesti¬
cate the most abundant and diversified
living matter on our planet, 'micro¬
biology is one of our greatest assets
in meeting problems posed by the
population explosion and increase in
life expectancy.
It is only during the last century
that micro-organisms have provided
the means that will make possible the
next major transformation of our
environment. They have, for instance,
shown us how the cell saves energy
and materials by using short lines of
communication and transport, simple
separation systems, multiple control
circuits and extensive process inte¬
gration.
These principles, as well as Nature's
preference for products that are suit¬
able for recycling, will certainly in¬
fluence future industrial practices.
Enzymes the biological catalysts are
used in industry today and before the
end of the century industry will prob¬
ably also have devised types of energy
transport systems similar to those
observed in micro-organisms.
Operating with great efficiency at
low temperatures and pressures, such
approaches offer numerous possibilities
of saving not only energy but also large
quantities of construction metals and,
of course, the various by-products we
now consider as pollutants.
Yet while enzyme engineering opens
up fascinating perspectives it is likely
that fermentation will offer the most
economic means for many types of
synthesis. And here microbial gen¬
eticists can paint the future in glowing
colours, because they have shown that
bacteria can even be taught to produce
substances that are normally made
only by higher organisms, which are
often unpractical and inefficient pro¬
ducers. The synthesis of certain
hormones from micro-organisms, for
example, offers many advantages over
their synthesis from animal organisms.
It is also reasonable to expect that
a genetic transfer of many microbial
capacities to higher organisms will
become possible. Certain human
enzyme deficiencies might be cured
through a transfer by microbes of the
genes responsible for the synthesis
of these enzymes. And if we could
isolate microbes capable of associating
with the roots of crops such as cereals
to produce nitrogen fixation compar¬
able to that accomplished by legumes,
the economic and social gains would
be considerable.
If you decide to become micro¬
biologists you will have plenty of
opportunities to work for the welfare
of mankind. But don't rely on the fact
that Louis Pasteur only got a "fair"
grading in chemistry, when he left
secondary school. True, his indifferent
marks did not prevent him later from
launching the new field of stereo¬
chemistry, but when he eventually laid
the foundation of modern micro¬
biology there was really very little
relevant knowledge to start with.
But nowadays, the student of micro¬
biology has to stand on the shoulders
of countless predecessors if he wants
to set eyes on something new. Since
the most dynamic fields of micro¬
biology lie at the meeting points with
other sciences a microbiologist also
needs to know a lot of mathematics,
biophysics and biochemistry, as well
as the essentials of at least one mother
discipline: medicine, veterinary, agri¬
cultural or food sciences, biology or
engineering.
This means hard work and, in many
parts of the world, sadly inadequate
economic rewards. But a micro¬
biologist can count on the satisfaction
of being able to influence the choice
which today faces mankind as it
approaches a crucial cross-roads. The
great challenge for mankind is no
longer outer space but inner space
which holds the microcosm of invisible
forms of life that surround us through¬
out our lives. To penetrate it, a
microscope is not enough, it also
requires knowledge, because, as
Goethe expressed it: "To see, one
must also know how."

course on conservation and use of
micro-organisms for waste recovery
and local fermentations, organized in
Bandung (Indonesia) in 1974.
Unesco has played a pioneering
role in several fields of microbiology.
In 1965, the Unesco-ICRO panel on
genetic change and virus-cell inter¬
action, under the chairmanship of Sal¬
vador Luria (USA, Nobel Prize for
Physiology-Medicine, 1969) launched a
survey which led to the compilation of
an International Registry of Microbial
Genetic Stocks. A year later, Unesco
assembled a team of experts to dis¬
cuss problems relating to culture col¬
lections and conservation techniques
of genetical resources.
In collaboration with the Internatio¬
nal Association of Microbiological
Societies (IAMS), Unesco has helped
the World Federation for Culture
Collections to compile a World Di¬
rectory of Collections of Cultures of
Micro-organisms.
Additional help in this project also
came from WHO, the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Or¬
ganization, based in Australia, and from
the U.N. Environment Programme.
The Directory is based on a compu¬
terized survey of nucleated and non-
nucleated microbes, animal, bacterial
and plant viruses, and animal, human,
insect and plant tissue cultures in
over 350 culture collections in the
developed and developing countries.
Collaboration between Unesco and
the United Nations Environment Pro¬
gramme led to the development of the
World Data Centre on Micro-organisms
at the University of Brisbane, Australia.
In this way Unesco and the United
Nations Environment Programme, in
collaboration with other organizations,
have made available key information
on and ensured the preservation of
valuable culture collections in the
developing countries.
Unesco and the ICRO panel on
microbiology have also launched a
fellowship programme to provide
further specialized training for young
microbiologists in the developing
countries.
This programme has already en¬
abled young microbiologists from
Cuba, Ghana, Guatemala, Ethiopia,
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria
and Sudan to benefit from studies in
laboratories in Czechoslovakia, Swe¬
den, Malaysia, Netherlands and U.S.A.
Microbiology can help the devel¬
oping nations just as it has contributed
to the technological growth of the
developed nations. By using microbial
fertilizers and insecticides fo boost
crop production and protection and by
harnessing microbial activities for the
recycling of utilisable wastes and the
improvement of traditional food indus¬
tries, the developing countries can and
will benefit immensely in the coming
decades.

OUR OLDEST ANCESTORS, THE MICROBES (Continued from page 26)
to the fact that one of the inorganic
nitrogen compounds, nitrate, can be
converted by microbes into nitrogen
gas. This leak into the atmosphere is
fortunately compensated for by the
activity of other microbes capable of
converting gaseous nitrogen into pro¬
tein, which thus completes the second
cycle.
In addition, atmospheric nitrogen is
fixed by lightning and by the modern
fertilizer industry which produces
ammonia and nitrates in amounts now
reaching the same order of magnitude
as that of nitrogen fixed by bacteria.
The activity of microbes in these
cycles is enormous, both quantitatively
and qualitatively. Every year they
unobtrusively devour the equivalent of
the earth's total production in plant
and animal matter, thereby surpassing
in scope and ingenuity the fiercest
animal we know: man himself.
The secret of their high-powered
activities lies in their small size and
consequent large surface per gramme
of live matter. This fact plus their
short internal "transport lines" enables
the most voracious among them to
consume twice their weight in a quarter
of an hour.
The versatility of the microbial king¬
dom is illustrated by the very ubiquity
of microbes: one finds them in the
Dead Sea as well as in distilled water;
in the upper reaches of the atmosphere
as well as in the deepest ocean bed; in
hot springs as well as in the polar
regions. They even inhabit the intes¬
tines of mammals, where they help
digestion, and they thrive on the
surface of underground iron pipes
which they help to corrode.
It would be an understatement to
say that microbes are merely beneficial
to man because they are just as
essential to his environment as oxygen
and water. An adequately fed human
being consumes immense amounts of
carbohydrate and protein as well as
water and oxygen during his lifetime.
The production of all these depends
on one or more vital aspects of mi¬
crobial activity. About half of the
oxygen is produced by algae in the
oceans; drinkable fresh water would
not exist if microbes did not take care
of its natural purification; cereals and
sugar-producing plants cou'd not grow
if microbes failed to produce carbon
dioxide or were incapable of fixing
nitrogen; even plant-eating animals
could not grow without the microbial
population in their rumen that breaks
down the cellulose from vegetable
material into digestible substances.
One person alone would produce
a mountain of accumulated wastes
during his lifetime if all these products
were not broken down by microbes
and returned to the cycles of nature.
Instead of remaining passively de¬
pendent upon the microbial world for
his survival, man has learned to con¬
sciously exploit microbes for many
different purposes (as is explained
elsewhere in this issue).
One major use is sewage purifi¬
cation, the biggest microbiological
industry in the world, which is basically
nothing more than a technological
stepping up of natural microbial miner¬
alization in cases where waste dis¬
charges are so congested that the
microbes are locally overtaxed and
cannot fulfill their task unassisted (see
article page 29).
Man has not yet fully learned to turq
waste treatment from a defensive
action against a nuisance into a pro¬
ductive step in the framework of the
cycles. Too often the valuable energy
and minerals of waste are dissipated in
the environment instead' of being
brought to bear at strategic points in
the cycles where they may be needed.
But the pressure of events is now
rapidly teaching us to recycle rather
than merely treat our waste products.
The lessons come from many areas of
activity. One case where efficient
recycling is mandatory is that of
prolonged space travel, and the
designs for the life support systems
that will- be required are faithful
replicas of the bio-geochemical cycles
of our big spaceship Earth.
Our knowledge about the biogeo-
chemical cycles and the role microbes
play in them is barely a hundred years
old and only in the last few decades
has man begun to have some quanti¬
tative notions about these cycles.
Along with this growing awareness has
come concern for the unhampered
functioning of our life support system.
Scientists now recognize that man's
industrial and agricultural activity has
reached the point where damage could
be done to the cycles by man-made
imbalances due to increasing flows
(by burning fossil fuels or by increased
industrial nitrogen fixation) or by
reducing certain flows (through the
poisoning of groups of microbes).
The efforts of the United Nations to
preserve and to improve the human
environment should therefore ensure
that a careful watch is kept over the
activities of the microbial segment of
our biological environment.

used as a source of energy by the
ruminant, or converted to amino acids
and vitamins, for the benefit of
the animal. Because human beings
depend a great deal on such animals
for meat and dairy products, the mi¬
crobial activities that occur in the
rumen are of great economic signifi¬
cance.
Microbes can also compete and
cause diseases in higher animals.
Some of the most dramatic and signifi¬
cant discoveries in1 the past century
have been concerned with under¬
standing the bases of infectious
disease.
These discoveries have led to thera¬
peutic and preventive measures that
have had great influence on the life
of mankind. Not only have many
disease-resistant plants and animals
been developed, but a reduction of
many of the most harmful human
diseases has been accomplished.
Microbiology has been responsible
in part for many progressive measures
in the control of infectious diseases
through the installation of good public
health measures, such as the improve¬
ment of sanitation, immunization pro¬
grammes, and the discovery of anti¬
biotics.
Here, for example, are the pro¬
portions by which the number of
reported cases of several important
human diseases have been reduced in
the past 30 years: plague by 99 '%;
yellow fever 86 '%; cholera, 85%;
smallpox, 83 % and typhus fever
by 63 '%.
These figures would seem to imply
that mankind has won its competition
with microbes, and that it will only be
a matter of time before all infectious
diseases are under control. This is
.a fond hope, but statistics indicate that
the number of cases of certain well
known diseases, such as measles,
mumps, dysentery, and venereal infec¬
tions, which were thought to be under
control, are again on the increase.
There are also many diseases known
throughout the world for which our
knowledge is still far from complete.
Schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease
that afflicts an estimated 200 million
people, is one example, and several
viral diseases are still poorly under- .
stood. Thus microbiologists must
continue to strive for more knowledge
about microbial associations.

### IGNORE

A perfect match
This issue is entirely illustrated by cartoons spe¬
cially drawn for the "Unesco Courier" (see page 5).
The cartoons on this page show that although cer¬
tain microbes are mankind's deadly enemies (top
right), others are trusty allies and indispensable to
all life. Lower drawings depict the "love-match"
between certain bacteria and leguminous plants
such as beans, peas and soybeans. The bacteria
obtain sugar from the plant roots and in turn
convert nitrogen in the air into ammonia which
enables the plants to make proteins vitally needed
for human and animal food. Scientists are now
looking for ways of stimulating "perfect
matches" between microbes and other plants such
as cereals in order to boost crop yields.
