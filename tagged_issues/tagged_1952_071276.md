FROM THE UNESCO NEWS ROOM
* France : A new type of mobile
theatre is to give performances in the
war-devastated Normandy area, where
so many theatres were destroyed. The
mobile unit was designed by theatre
director Paul Douai.
* Lebanon : An international com-
mission, created in Beirut for the
translation of masterpieces of Arab
literature, has just published one of
the most important books of Al-Gha-
zali in French, English and Spanish.
This book, 0 Disciple, is one of the
outstanding works of the famous
Moslem mystic, whose great inftuence
on the philosophy and theology of
Islam remains after eight centuries.
Two other classics of Arab literature
have appeared in the same Unesco-
sponsored collection : The Book of the
Directives and Remarks, by Avicenna,
and The Book of the Misers, by AI
Djahiz.
* Brazil : One hundred fellowship
students have arrived in Rio de Ja-
neiro from 20 Latin American countries
to participate in a nine-month course
on vocational training. The course
was organized by the Brazilian Gov-
ernment in agreement with the
United Nations. Also from Brazil
comes word that the International
Labour Organization has sent in a
score of specialists to help in the
government's technical training pro-
gramme.
* Peru : A wide campaign against
illiteracy soon will begin in the
Peruvian countryside, following the
recent creation by the government
of a rural education department
Educational missions will teach rural
dwellers how to read and write, and
will also help try to organize a better
use of natural resources.
* Gold Coast : Blind people in the
Gold Coast may soon have their first
vocational training school in Accra.
The new school is to start with 25
trainees who will be taught such
handicraft as basket-making, weaving
and rope-making. A workshop will
be opened later to provide employment
for the school's graduate students.
* Unesco : A regional conference for
the extension of free and compulsory
education in South Asia and the
Pacific region will be hald in Bombay,
under Unesco auspices from December
12 to 23. About forty experts from
thirteen countries are expected to
attend. Delegates will have on hand
the results of special Unesco enquiries
on primary education now being
undertaken in eight countries of the
area.
* Austria : To stimulate the
exchange of letters between school
children of different countries, the
Austrian government has issued a
special stamp to be used only on school
correspondence.
* Burma : A Unesco seminar in
Rangoon on the Education of Youth
for Living in a World Community was
attented by youth leaders from 13
nations in South Asia and the South
Pacific. Four Member States of
Unesco, administrating territories in
that region-France, the Netherlands,
the U. K. and the U. S.-also took
part. The aim of the seminar was
to encourage the participation of
youth in the improV'ement of commun-
ity life at all levels-local, national
and international.
* Unesco : The influence of technical
changes on the traditional juridical
and social structures of countries in
the Near and Middle East was studied
at a Symposium in Athens held under
Unesco auspices by the Greek Society
for International Studies. Social
scientists from the Near and Middle
East countries studied the effects of
technical progress in these regions
during the past 20 years. Members of
the Greek National Commission for
Unesco and regional representatives of
United Nations Specialized Agencies
attended the symposium.
* International : Ten European na-
tions have selected a site near Geneva
for a great nuclear research laboratory,
which is to house what may be the
most powerful atom-smashing cosmo-
tron in the world-a huge accelerator
that will be rated at thirty thousand
million electron volts. There will
also be a synchro-cyclotron with a
rating of six hundred million electron
volts. The laboratory will take about
seven years to build and equip, and
will cost the participating countries
an annual total of almost $4, 000, 000.
It is to be used exclusively for pure
scientific research. Results will be
supplied freely to all member-nations
of the European Council for Atomic
Research, an organization founded
recently with the help of Unesco.
* Belgium : A large-scale exhibition
designed to show that art should
make its impact on everyday life, and
not simply be cloistered in museums
and art galleries, has been held in
Brussels. Entitled"Monumental Art
in Public and Industrial Premises",
the exhibition used examples ranging
from factories to bridges, and from
private homes to post offices. It also
showed that architects, painters and
sculptors can and should collaborate
in bringing works of art before the
public, and in helping to revive such
branches of art production as the
making of stained glass windows,
ceramics and tapestries.
* Unesco : Unesco Gift Coupons are
to be promoted throughout Australia
by the Australian Association for the
United Nations. Unesco already has
supplied the Association with a list of
the needs of educational institutions
in nine countries. Australia thus
becomes the seventh donor country to
participate in the Unesco scheme that
enables voluntary groups to send
coupons abroad to institutions needing
help. These coupons are a form of
international currency. With them,
the recipients order required equip-
ment from suppliers, who later are
reimbursed in their own currencies by
Unesco.
* International : United Nations
Associations in Cuba and Japan have
organized a scheme for an artistic and
cultural exchange between primary
and secondary schoolchildren in the
two countries. To start off the
scheme, between 200 and 300 drawings
are being sent by Japan to Cuba, for
public display and later distribution
among individual children. Later,
Cuba will send a similar exhibition to
UNESCO'S SEVENTH
GENERAL CONFERENCE
UNESCO'S seventh General Conler-ence opened in Paris on No-
vember 12, and is due to con-
clude about December 10. It will
discuss Unesco's programme and bud-
get for 1953 and 1954. On the
opening day, Sir Sarvepalli Radha-
krishnan, Vice-President 01 India, was
elected president on the Conference.
Philosopher, theologian, statesman
and diplomat, he has heoded his
country's delegation to every one 01
Unesco's General Conlerences, and
was a member 01 the Executive Board
01 Unesco Irom 1946 to 1951. The
president 01 last year's Conlerence,
Mr. Howland H. Sargeant, United
States Assistant Secretary 01 State,
opened the Conference in Iront 01 the
representatives 01 58 01 Unesco's
Member States as well as observers
from many international and inter-
governmental organizations. Speakers
on the opening day included represen-
natives of the United Nations, the
World Health Organization, the Orga-
nization 01 American States, and the
Council 01 Europe. This issue or the

ence is beginning its meetings, and
further details of its work will be
published next month.
Tokio. The organizers hope that the
scheme will also lead to a greater
amount of"pen-friend"correspond-
ence between children of the two
countries.
* India : Villagers in the Indian State
of Uttar Pradesh have surpluses of
fruits and vegetables at harvest time,
shortages during the rest of the year.
Dr. Garbasins Weber, of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Or-
ganization, is to advise the State how
it might best adapt the traditional
Indian earthenware jar for food
preserving purposes. The goal of
this experiment is to help raise nutri-
tion standards among the 60, 000, 000
people in what is India's largest State.
* The Netherlands : An exhibition on
man's technical and cultural progress
throughout the centuries has been
opened at the Delft Prinsenhof Mu-
seum. Organized boy the Delft Student
Society, the exhibition displayed man's
most primitive agricultural imple-
ments along with very modern ones.
The world's cultural development was
illustrated, among other things, by
the fight for social justice undertaken
by such world figures as Pope Leo III,
Pestalozzi and President Lincoln.
Present day efforts to promote world
peace were represented by publica-
tions about the United Nations and
Unesco.
* Unesco : Forty-five museum experts
and educators from 25 European,
Asiatic and American countries met in
Brooklyn, New York, at a Unesco-
sponsored international seminar to
seek effective methods of co-operation
between museums and schools, espe-
cially in the art, science and history.
Delegates recommended that practical
courses in museum work oug'ht to be
given at teachers'training colleges.
Other recommendations included esta-
blishing international mobile museum
units, more travelling exhibitions, in-
ternational exchanges of staff, and
the creation of fellowships.
* Turkey : About $15, 000 worth of
Unesco Book Coupons have been sold
to institutions and individuals in
Turkey since this country joined the
Book Coupon Scheme just over a year
ago. Coupons, which are sold through
the Turkish National Library in An-
kara, have been used to buy books and
periodicals on education, science, art
and other cultural subjects in hard
currency countries such as the United
States and Switzerland. Purchases
made in this way are not subject to
the usual currency restrictions.
* Unesco : Two more countries,
the Philippines and Cuba have ra-
tified the Unesco-sponsored interna-
tional agreement abolishing import
duties on a wide range of educational,
scientific and cultural materials. The
agreement, which came into force
last May, has now been ratified by 11
other nations-Cambodia, Ceylon,
Egypt, Israel, Laos, Monaco, Pakistan,
Sweden, Thailand, Vietnam and Yu-
goslavia. Eighteen other governments
have signed it, but have yet to ratify.
* International : A world-wide radio
commemoration of the Declaration of
the Rights of the Child will be held
on December 18, anniversary of the
death of Eglantyne Jebb, author of
this Declaration. The commemoration
will be sponsored by the International
Union for Child Welfare, following a
decision by delegates, representing
36 nations, who met in Zurich,
Switzerland.
* Indonesia : Eight Indonesian en-
gineering students are to receive six-
year scholarships in Sweden offered by
the National Union of Swedish
Students, which will pay all tuition
expenses. After studying the country's
language and resources, the Indonesian
students will be apprenticed for some
months in an industrial works and
will later study physics, chemistry or
mechanics at the Royal Technological
Institute.
* Venezuela : Encouraged by the
success of its travelling teacher plan
to combat illit'eracy, Venezuela is
to provide more teachers so that even-
ing classes can be increased, and a
number of new centres opened. The
Ministry of Education is also to inau-
gurate a special office for the anti-
illiteracy campaign.
* Pakistan : Canada is helping Pakis-
tan to make an extensive aerial sur-
vey of the country's natural resources
as a Canadian contribution under the
Colombo Plan. The techniques to be
used will be similar to those already
utilized successfully and on a large
scale in Canada itself. Geographical
and geological mapping will be done
by Canadians from aerial photographs,
and will provide Pakistan with an
inventory of her latent resources
contained in an area of 123, 000 square
miles. The inventory is designed to
help the country plan its economic de-
velopment, and especially its future
irrigation and hydro-electric schemes.
* International : A hundred teachers
in Britain, and a similar number
in the United States, have taken over
each other's posts under an interna-
tional teachers'exchange scheme. Now
in its seventh year, this programme
has made possible the exchange of
1, 426 teachers between the United
States and other countries.
* Belgium : Belgian authorities have
granted free postage for all Braille
publications for the blind posted
within the country or sent abroad.
This decision follows recent changes
in the Universal Postal Convention
made on Unesco's recommendation.
* Israel : The first demonstration
and teaching centre on the building of
houses from packed earth is to be
established in Israel, following an
agreement between the Israeli govern-
ment and the United Nations Tech-
nical Assistance Administration. The
centre will conduct research on how
packed earth houses might be used in
the arid and semi-arid regions of
various countries. The United Nations
will provide technicians, laboratory
equipment and machinery.
* International : Since 1950, Novem-
bÃ¨r 8 has been celebrated in many
parts of the world as Town and
Country Planning Day. Last year, for
example, it was observed in twenty
countries. The aim of this commemo-
ration, which was initiated by the
Town Planning Institute of Buenos
Aires, is to bring together in a com-
mon effort, town and country planners,
technicians and all those who are con-
cerned with improving the living con-
ditions of people everywhere. Reports
on this year's celebration emphasise the
importance given to projects aimed at
improving social life in rural areas and
of providing amenities to put the
countryside on the same level as urban
areas. In France, such discussions be-
tween engineers, administrators,
mayors and Prefects took place at
Paris University.

### Teaching world understanding in the geography class
DECEMBER 1952. Page 3

TEACHING WORLD UNDERSTANDING
IN THE GEOGRAPHY CLASS
CC fN what way can geography teaching helpfoster better international understand-
ing ?" In the past few years Unesco has
provided a number of replies and clarifications to
this question. In 1950, Unesco called an interna-
tional seminar on the subject at Montreal and
published a small volume entitled Some Sug-
gestions on the Teaching of Geography (1). Now,
as a complement to this booklet, it has brought
out a Handbook of Suggestions on the Teaching
or Geography (2) which embodies the main con-
clusions and suggestions of those who took part
in the seminar.
I think that it would be worth while to
return to this subject for it seems to me that
neither the authors of the first booklet (of whom
I was one), nor the members of the seminar (in
which I also participated), nor even the author
of the second booklet, have sufficiently stressed
the tremendous possibilities for the development
of world-mindedness which geography offers.
Nor have they. I feel, laid sufficient emphasis on
the serious difficulties which teachers are likely
to meet in encouraging an attitude of mind
favourable to better international understanding
among their pupils.
But first let us try to reach a clear definition
of the fundamentals involved : What do we mean
by education for better international under-
standing and what, exactly, do we mean by
geography ?
First of all, one thing that education for inter-
national understanding should not be is just a
high-sounding, vague phrase. For it is only
when we understand exactly what we are trying
to achieve through such teaching that we can
determine with any degree of precision or clarity
what methods to use.
 The definition that I propose is one that I
formulated with my study group at the recent
Unesco seminar in the Netherlands on teaching
about Human Rights.
The definition, as formulated by the group, was :
(1) Give youth an understanding of the past
and present-day life of peoples in other countries
- their traditions, their chief characteristics,
their problems and the solutions they have found
for them.
(2) Make youth conscious of the contribution of
each nation to the common heritage of humanity :
technology, science, arts, literature. Civilization
is a vast network of reciprocal debts between
nations.
(3) Make youth conscious of the fact that, if
the world remains dangerously divided as far as
interests and passions of political origin are
concerned, its solidarity in the fields of
(1) Out o {wins.

Commission for Unesco.
economics, science, techniques and culture is
nevertheless becoming daily more evident, and
that a deep desire for peace exists in all peoples.
The organization of the world on an international
basis is not only possible, but has become a
necessity. It is a question of making the different
citizens conscious of their future responsibilities
towards this international organization, and
towards world peace.
(4) Make youth conscious of the fact that the
nations must work together in international
organizations for the common good, and must
find ways of collaborating even if they are
separated by different ideologies. The world
cannot be uniform, but the different nations must
unite to maintain peace.
(5) Organize schools and universities so that
they are able to initiate children and youth in all
their future social responsibilities from a material,
as well as from a moral and intellectual point of
view, and in the idea of liberty through self-
discipline. Youth can serve this same appren-
ticeship in the various youth movements. It is
personal experience which will make youth
conscious of their duty both as citizens of their
own country and as citizens of the world.
To this definition, however, must be added a
double word of caution :
(a) Education for living in a world community
is merely the complement and the development of
living in a national community.
(b) To understand is not always to accept ; it
is sometimes to censure, even to show opposition
and resistance when certain great higher
principles such as liberty, justice and solidarity
are in danger of being destroyed or of disap-
pearing.
Geography consists in locating, describing, ex-
plaining and comparing scenery and human
activities on the face of the globe. This defini-
tion may appear rather sweeping with regard to
human activities. Do painting and philosophy,
for example, come within the scope of geography ?
Here we should perhaps give a more precise
explanation.
We mean human activies insofar as they
are directly affected by natural conditions and
insofar as they exercise a direct influence on the
appearance of the world's landscape. Thus, the
Moslem religion is of interest to the geographer,
but not in its complicated doctrines nor in the
literary and artistic works it has inspired. The
geographer is concerned with its essential ele-
ments ; first because it reflects an image of the
desert and semi-desert world from which it
sprang and in which it expanded ; second because
it has inspired original ways of life ; third because
Moslem cities with their houses crowded around
their mosques have given the landscape an ap-
pearance distinctly different from that of
European cities dominated by their churches.
Geography, then, is a natural science, but even
more is a human science. These two aspects
cannot be separated because nature directly
affects man's mode of living and because man
exercises a limited or complex action on nature
which varies in degree with time and place. The
pattern of human existence on the earth's surface
is thus one of the basic concerns of the geo-
grapher.
Every society has its individual traits and
sometimes even exceptional characteristics caused
by different factors. It is up to the geographer
to emphasise them for the very destiny of man
speaks for his greatness and explains the flower-
ing of civilizations. But like every science,
geography seeks to generalise and to find a
common measure for natural and human factors
by means of appropriate explanations and com-
parisons.
The mode of life of the Tibetan people, for
example, permits many picturesque descriptions
with which any teacher may let himself be
carried away and by means of which he may
strongly impress his class. But the explanation
for this pattern of life is to be found in Tibet's
high altitude, and the restrictions of mountain
life there are also found in other moutainous
regions of the world. By the same token,
Buddhist practices of Tibet are to be found in
many parts of China and South East Asia. In
this way, the geographer succeeds in situating
people within the framework of humanist)'\ was a
whole, and in fitting them into one vast and
common undertaking. And this applies even to
those people who live at an altitude of 16, 000 feet
on the"'roof"of the world.
If geography is a science, it must also be an
art. It does more than list facts and explain
them ; it ingeniously assembles ideas and shows
their relationships, especially through description !
of countries and their inhabitants. To"'put over"
his subject in such a way that people will reall
profit from reading his work or listening to him
the geographer must possess a mastery both of
composition and of style.
Let us take as an example Holland's polders
which are tracts of low-lying land reclaimed fro : r
the sea. First of all, the geographer describef
these"low countries"just
as they were painted by Ruys- (Connnued
daÃ«l and van Goyen ; peaceful, on next page)

GEOGRAPHY AND INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING
(Continued from distant landscapes studded
previous page) with windmills and churchtowers and overshadowed by
mountainous, turbulent clouds. He depicts the
dyke walls and, running alongside them, the green
waters of the canals, the meadows on whose
lush grass herds of black and white cows graze,
the multicoloured fields of flowers around Haar-
lem and the chess-board pattern of the market
gardens near Amsterdam. He takes his students
inside the towns criss-crossed by canals, into the
peaceful, prosperous and bourgeois Venices of the
north. Through his description he tries to interest
his class in the country, to arouse in them a
friendliness and admiration for Holland.
MAN'S PACIFIC CONQUEST
THEN he goes on to explain how, through anunceasing fight, polders have been wrested
from the brutal grasp of sea and river waters,
how thousands of acres have been put to
cultivation, and entire provinces have been
created even though the land lies below sea-level.
Finally, the geographer draws comparisons
between the Dutch polders, those of Belgium and
France and the German marschen. He shows
how men of many countries are heroes in a
common effort of conquest-a pacific conquest
waged solely for the benefit of man, for his
progress and for his happiness.
In these areas, war has always brought about
a brutal step backwards to conditions of centuries
past ; the dykes have been blown up ; the locks
have been destroyed, and the sea has once again
invaded land that men had won back patiently
and progressively. Is not this the sort of expla-
nation likely to inspire a better understanding
and a greater affection for the Dutch people, to
show the benefits of peace and the follies of war ?
And is it not also a real lesson in geography ?
There is no need to distort geography in order
to make it contribute to international under-
standing. If it is taught thoroughly, intelligently
and honestly, the result will be obtained quite
naturally.
Geography will be taught thoroughly if the
teacher explains the principal characteristics
and features of a country or of a geographical
phenomenon, always bearing in mind that he
must locate, describe, explain and compare a
given geographical situation It will be tho-
roughly taught especially if the teacher explains
everything that the children of his class are
capable of understanding and assimilating.
Geography intelligently taught makes use of
various scientific facts so as to build them into
a coherent whole ; it must on the basis of
scientific facts become an art.
This transition from science to art requires
skill, flexibility and sureness of touch. Geography
teaching must never be sterotyped, but must vary
in both method and approach. In short, it must
combine the initiative and improvisation of the
creative mind with the logic and sense of propor-
tion necessary in evolving a synthesis.
Geography is honest insofar as it is complete
and establishes true relations between various
facts, insofar as it strives for objectivity and
seeks after the truth, and insofar as it repudiates
sensationalism and political propaganda.
Is this, however, an over-simplification ? It
may be argued that, however skilfully it is done,
geography teaching is aimed primarily at the
pupil's intelligence, and that while it may very
well produce a complete intellectual knowledge
of the country under study, this in itself is not
sufficient to create a desire for co-operation
between peoples. For is not a spy supposed to
have the best geographical knowledge of the
country against which he is operating ? There-
fore, we should not only appeal to the intelligence
of young people, but also to their willingness and
feelings.
A determined and tenacious will is most often
produced by a clear understanding of things.
Intelligence is still the best, the most powerful
driving force of true will power. So all geo-
graphical studies should include recognition of
the following facts :
(1) In order to live and raise their living
standards, men must either fight nature or work
with it. Naturally conditions vary according to
different regions, but the experience and the
efforts are common to all, and all men benefit
from these efforts to some extent.
(2) No nation, even under conditions of
freedom and peace, is self-sufficient. All have
need of one another to live and prosper.
(3) Thanks to scientific and technical develop-
ments, and to the progress of communication and
transport, the earth has so shrunk that it is now
possible to conceive as a not too distant reality
a world economic and political organization
which would be of benefit to all.
The emotional response of children can be
brought into action by a form of teaching that
is concrete, alive and active. Verbal and
didactic teaching which only crams names and
facts into young minds and buries the spon-
taneous enthusiams of youth under a ponderous
weight of knowledge must be abandoned. Young
people must learn to discover the natural beauties
and the worthy achievements of their own
country as well as those of other countries which
are sometimes even more creditable.
I remember a class of boys aged between 13
and 14 to whom a young student teacher had
given a lesson on Yugoslavia.
Towards the end of the lesson I had arranged
for some slides to be shown ; the pupils were
grouped in teams, and asked to identify the
region or city projected on the screen. As I
showed the first, I said :"At the upper left corner
of the slide is a monument which should help
you to name the city."While the boys discussed
the photo among themselves, I asked the student
teacher if he had found the answer. He shook
his head and said'''No.''But very quickly each
team gave me the following report :"In the upper
left corner of the photo is a Gothic church ; Gothic
style usually signifies a Roman Catholic church ;
the photo then shows a large town in the predo-
minatingly Catholic area of Yugoslavia ; the town
in question is Zagreb, capital of Croatia."I went
over to the young teacher and pointed out to him
that teaching should be less concerned with
cramming home facts than with helping the
pupils to discover these facts for themselves.
I should like to stress the enormous interest
that geography arouses in the young people of
the world today, and the difficulties which face
the teacher of geography because of this. The
curiosity of young people about the world is
constantly being aroused by the newspapers and
magazines specially published for them and
illustrated with magnificent photographs. Their
curiosity is aroused by the radio and television
which they listen to and watch as often as, if
not more often than, their parents. Through
these modern media of information the world
throngs into the minds and imagination of the
young ; their memories become filled with notions
that are often confused and false, but sometimes,
too, extremely clear and exact.
This formidable competition must be taken
into consideration by the teacher.
No longer do children obtain all their know-
ledge from their teachers or their textbooks.
Their interest in geography centres on the
living and up-to-date picture of the world
that it brings them. If they realize that their
teacher is not aware of recent discoveries or the
latest changes in economic or human affairs, the
teacher loses his prestige and geography its
fascination.
Today pupils may be better informed than
their teacher and so discover that his knowledge
is out of date. There are some teachers who do
not know, for example, that Canada has
become a great industrial and commercial
power, who have never heard of the extensive
irrigation works already completed or being
executed in North Africa, who are unaware of
the recent upheavals in the geography of oil.
Geography teachers must therefore aim at
a form of teaching that is both concrete and
alive, making as much use as possible of photo-
graphs and even occasionally of films. They
must keep themselves constantly up-to-date,
especially through books and periodicals with the
sudden changes so common in the modern world.
Finally, we come up against the most serious
objection. Can one really advocate teaching which
strives to develop international understanding in
a world where passions and hatreds engendered
by the Second World War are still fresh in many
minds and where new hatreds are growing ; in a
world split into two camps and resounding with
abuse and even the clash of arms ? Even if we
agree that this kind of teaching is to be desired,
in what way can it be achieved, and how can
some of the difficulties be overcome ? What can
a French teacher who may have been tortured
and deported say about the Germans ? What
can an American teacher say about Russia or a
Russian teacher about the United States ?
When emotions are unleashed, a thinking
person worthy of the name tries to rise above the
conflict and to reach as informed and reasoned
an opinion as possible. When the person
concerned is a geography teacher entrusted with
the task of describing and explaining a world
rent by passions and factions, his duty is to give
his teaching as objective a character as possible.
Objective teaching is patterned on its subject
matter. It is not vitiated with subjective prefer-
ences of a personal, social, political or national
character. Because its aim is truth it eschews
all propaganda and is as complete as possible,
for propaganda tends to deform facts.
It takes the form neither of a panegyric nor an
indictment, neither of praise nor of systematic
criticism. It recognizes the many diversities
that exist in the great and common enter-
prise of mankind, because not all peoples live
under the same geographical conditions nor have
they attained the same stage of historical deve-
lopment. Geography also remains apart from
politics. It is the facts supplied by the geo-
grapher which are selected and used to develop
political systems and to justify their aims.
CLEAR VIEW OF REALITIES
*T'0 recognize the speed of recent economicprogress in the U. S. S. R., which has immense
reserves of manpower and resources, does
not constitute a defence of Communism. It
is merely a simple and objective expression of a
geographical fact which is explained by the
manifold possibilities of a natural environment
and the co-ordinated activity of men. Nor is it
an expression of anti-Communist sentiment to
speak of the difficulties of communicating and
trading with the U. S. S. R. and neighbouring
countries which have the same political and
social systems. It is again to state a geographical
fact which hurts the common effort of mankind.
There is no praise implied in recognising that
Germany has become a great economic power in
the 20th century. Rather it is, once again,
a simply and objectively stated historic fact
which is due to the progressive unification of
Germany, the country's rich coal deposits and the
hard-working and dogged qualities of the
German people. Nor is it criticism of Germany
to describe the periodical outbreaks of impe-
rialism-the Drang nach Osten and the Drang
nach Westen. To do so is simply. to state facts
which are explained by the absence of natural
frontiers and the racial overlapping of Eastern
and Central Europe.
Today it is more vital than ever to separate
teaching from political or national passions and
prejudices, and to promote a spirit of tolerance
and of mutual understanding, not founded on
blissful pacifism or timid resignation, but on a
clear-sighted view of present day realities and on
the will to contribute something, however small,
to the achievement of world peace. For the
geography teacher needs a clear vision of his
responsibilities both towards his subject and his
audience-the young people who must go out
into the world imbued with courage and the will
to peace.
DENMARK'S FIRST SPEEDBOAT
LIBRARY FOR ISOLATED READERS
Fishermen and farm workers on the many small islands lying off the
coast of the Southern Danish province of Svendborg are now being
provided with reading matter by the first water-borne library service
to be organized in Denmark. The county library of Svendborg, like
all other Danish country libraries, supplies its rural branches by using
bookmobiles, but some of the smaller islands in the county have
been deprived of this service because the lack of harbour facilities
makes it impossible to land these vehicles. The Svendborg County
Library has overcome this problem by installing a library of 500 books
on a high-powered motor boat which has started to make regular
trips to these small islands. The service is warmly welcomed as was
shown by the results of the first trip made to three islands where for
a total population of 230 people, 365 volumes-fiction, non-fiction and
children's books-were borrowed. On every trip a trained librarian
is on board to help and advise the library users. Svendborg's isolated
islanders now look forward eagerly to the arrival of the floating library
whose services will also help them to pass the long winter evenings.

### My school has 'adopted' a ship
COURIER DECEMBER 1952. Page 5
All types of ocean-going vessels ranging from whalers to weatherships and
from merchant ships to cable ships (above) have been adopted by schoolchildren
in five European countries. As soon as"their"ship docks at her home port
the children are eager to go aboard to meet their sailor friends. (Photo COI).
MY SCHOOL HAS'ADOPTED'A SHIP
ARRIVING at a port of call oneday, Captain Kelly, master of
the merchant ship irish Cedar
found a letter addressed in a child-
ish hand waiting for him. He open-
ed it and read :
"Dear Captain Telly,
"My name is Patrick Smite, 1 am
eleven years old and I am a boarder
at Avoca School. There are 254 boys
in the school, of whom 14 are board-
ers.
"Please could you send me some
information about your ship ? I know
that it weighs 8, 000 tons and I have
read your messages. I have also
seen its photo and I like it very
much. You see I am very interested
in ships, the things they carry and
what ports they are calling at.
When you come back to Dublin 1
should like to come on board.
"1 also hope that you will be glad
to receive this and many other
letters."
The letter came as no surprise to
Captain Kelly, for he knew that
Patrick Smith and the other boys of
Avoca School at Blackrock, County
Dublin, had just"adopted"his ship.
Like thousands of other children in
Western Europe and Scandinavia,
these Irish boys go to one of the
schools associated with a Ship
Adoption Society, through which
boys and girls are in constant touch
with the captains and crews of
hundreds of ships sailing in all parts
of the world.
These Societies have already been
formed in five countries : Denmark,
Great Britain, Holland, Ireland and
Norway. The oldest and largest is
the British Ship Adoption Society,
founded in 1936 after a successful
experiment in 1934, when a London
ship-owning company allowed four
of its ships to be"adopted"by four
London schools.
In Britain today there are some
1, 000 ships and over 800 schools
associated with the movement, and
official recognition of the educa-
tional value of the scheme is evident
in the number of educationalists
and ministry representatives serving
on the committee of management.
In Norway, a similar orgazination
was set up shortly before the war
through the efforts of teachers'
associations and shipping com-
panies. Its work, interrupted by the
war, was resumed after Norway's
liberation, and 1946 saw the forma-
tion of Norsk Skipsadopsjon (Norwe-
gian Ship Adoption Society) to
which 370 schools are now affiliated.
The Dutch Ship Adoption Society,
Nevas, which was also founded in
1946, today has 200"adopted"ships.
Letters from children to their adopted ships are delivered in the Port of London
This London river postman is a member of a family which, for 150 years, has been
delivering all mail to crews of ships lying in the Pool of London. (Photo COI).
The president of the Netherlands Ship Adoption Society explains to a class
the history and voyages of the mail steamer"Merweda"-which the bcys and
girls have adopted-and presents them with a coloured painting of"their"ship.
The most recently formed, that of
Ireland, began operating in 1948.
Liaison between ships and shore
is maintained chiefly by correspond-
ence. A steady exchange of letters
between pupils and crews forms the
basis of a friendly and useful liaison
which adds life and zest to class-
room lessons.
Descriptions of journeys, cargoes,
ports of call and weather conditions
during the trips open up new hori-
zons for the children. True stories
and adventures lived and recounted
by their friends transform.'just
another geography lesson"into a
wonderful journey into reality.
"We sighted the Azores one even-
ing just before nightfall,"wrote
Captain A. R. Spearman, master of
the British motor tanker Nicania.
"Their rugged peaks were silhouett-
ed in the red rays of the setting
sun. When they were first dis-
covered back in the 14th century
by the Genoese, they were uninha-
bited. They now belong to Portugal
and the people are mostly Portu-
guese.
"The islands have a mild climate
with a high and steady rainfall.
The soil is very fertile and three or
four crops a year can be produced.
Maize and beans are the principal
crops, others are wheat, millet and
barley. Sugar and beet are also
grown, and fruit grows abundantly
.-there are sweet potatoes, pine-
apples, grapes, bananas and abricots.
Tea, coffee, tobacco and flax are
also cultivated, and there are sugar
and tobacco factories."
From such first-hand descriptions
as this, the chapter on the Azores
in the geography textbooks takes on
a new interest. During the voyage
which took him to the Bahamas, to
Florida, New Orleans and CuraÃ§ao,
through the Panama Canal and
across the Pacific, Captain Spear-
man sent accounts of what he saw
- vivid pictures and instructive and
picturesque details which all helped
to enrich classroom lessons.
The children bombard their sea-
faring friends with innumerable
questions : How long did the voyage
last ? Where do you go to refuel
and how much did it cost ? The
replies are detailed and instructive.
They teach the schoolchildren how
sailors live and work at sea, the
kinds of products.

### My school has 'adopted' a ship
Page 6. DECEMBER 1952 UNESCO
LESSONS BECOME A VOYAGE TO REALITY
Not all the stories ti1e children hear from their sailor correspondents have happy ending's. Sometimes they read of storms,
typhoons, of ships being disabled or even wrecked. But such accounts only tend to bring them closer to the seamen
(Continued from ent countries,
previous page) and the customsand habits of
peoples in foreign lands.
Here, for example, is an extract
from a letter sent by a member of
the crew of the Lutterkerk to the
boys and girls of a Dutch school :
"This time we have been making
a trip to the Persian Gulf. One of
our stops was Ashar which lies in
Irak near Shatt-el-Arab, a river
which flows from the Euphrates into
the Tigris. I want to tell you
something about Ashar which was,
according to legend, the birthplace
of Sinbad the Sailor.
"From the harbour we had a clear
view of the city, which is surrounded
by date trees. They grow along the
river for several miles, and their
fruit is the outstanding export. The,
first thing that strikes you about the
city is the cupola of the mosque.
Two stern looking Arabs are sitting
at the entrance. According to
religion custom, I must take off my
shoes before entering, and I am sure
to have a hole in my sock. The
building is made of sandstone and
the cupola is decorated with mosaics
- thousands of tiny multicoloured
stones.
"'Outside the mosque is a busy
street, where mules pull heavy carts
filled with vegetables and dates.
The women in the street are heavily
veiled and dressed in black-a
practical garb offering protection
from the millions of flies which exist
here even in winter."
The value of this exchange of
letters extends far beyond the
geography class. Details of shipping
transactions are used in economics
courses. Descriptions of feeding
arrangements on board are useful
for domestic science classes ; copies
of the engineer's logs can be used in
the mathematics period ; an article
on Palestine will illustrate a Bible
lesson ; a letter on the growth of a
port of a coastal town may provide
historical information.
Sometimes they provide material
for a lesson on international co-
operation. For instance, one captain
whose tanker visited Rotterdam
wrote :
.'woe spent about four days at the
loading berth, and during this
time I was able to go down to the
Hague and have a look over the
International Court of Justice build-
ing-the Dutch call it the Peace
Palace. It really is a very lovÃ©ly
building. Every country that is
represented has contributed some-
thing. England's gift was the lovely
stained glass windows, Italy contri-
Schoolchildren in the Norwegian valley of Gudbrandsdalen received a letter
containing a series of questions from the crew of the"Herva"which they have
adopted. In their reply, the children illustrated their answers to this friendly
general knowledge test with simple drawings and decorations (shown above).
buted marble from which they made
the floor-a marvellous bit of work,
as it is composed of thousands of
inch-square blocks set into the most
intricate design. A Dutch painter
did the murals. Japan presented a
set of beautiful tapestries, made as
only the Japanese can make them ;
Burma contributed teak and maho-
gany, and so it goes on. An
Englishman was responsible for the
lay-out of the gardens which
surround the palace."
If the maximum benefits are to
be drawn from the ship adoption
scheme, teachers must play an
important role. They must link
facts recounted in the letters with
classroom lessons, encourage chil-
dren to use their initiative, and
organize all sorts of activities to help
bring children in touch with the life
of their adopted ship.
Photographs of the ship are
pinned on classroom walls together
with copies of telegrams giving her
position, notes on the types of
weather experienced, details of the
cargos carried, and so on. The
children follow the ship's progress
on a map of their own making,
marking each stage of the voyage
with small nags.
The headmaster of one Irish
school is even arranging for a film-
strip to be made of a typical voyage
of one of the ships. This will be
distributed to schools for use during
geography lessons. Many Irish
schools have already seen the
excellent aims which an Irish
shipping organization has made of
its growth and activities. Nearly
all exhibit in their libraries or
reading rooms, books, magazines or
collections of photographs and post-
cards which are souvenirs of a call"their"ship made in Sweden, Fin-
land, Canada, the United States or
Cuba.
The Irish Ship Adoption Society
has close contacts with its British
counterpart, and from France it has
received posters and pictorial and
informative material sent to Ireland
by two shipping companies.
In Norway, schools have received
collections of many strange objects
brought back from voyages by their
friends. These objects include
turtles from Africa, native spears and
musical instruments from Madagas-
car, and shells and dried plants
coming from many latitudes.
The interest and activities stimu-
lated in the schools by the exchange
of letters is unending. Some chil-
dren make models of ships, or of
farms, factories and plants described
by their sailor correspondents. Girls
are given an incentive to improve
their needlework, for they send gifts
to the crews at Christmas.
But the ship adoption system is
not a one-sided affair. Through
letters from the children, officers
and crews are kept in a special way
in close contact with life at home,
the sort of news they receive giving
them the impression of being closer
in touch with daily life in their
country. Parcels, books and papers
they receive help to break the
monotony of a long voyage. Some
schools edit"newspapers"illustrated
with amusing sketches, which they
send to their sailor friends.
The success of the system is
shown by the long list of schools
waiting for a ship which they can
adopt. War losses, the slowness of
building today, and the normal
depreciation and loss in shipping all
make it impossible to provide a
sufficient number of ships.
But the Ship Adoption Societies
are finding other ways of main-
taining the children's interest. Pub-
lications such as Our Merchant
Ships, Skolen og Skuta (Schools and
Ships) and t'Kraaiennest (The
Crow's Nest) which are put out
respectively by the British, Nor-
wegian and Dutch Societies, re-
produce the letters of children and
sailors, and keep the schools
informed about the activities of the
movement. Booklets on great ports
of the world are to be published by
the British Ship Adoption Society
which has already produced a book
entitled Seajarers, Ships and
Cargoes.
The adoptions are also proving an
effective aid to international under-
standing. When the Norwegian
merchant ship Vistajjord called at
Takoradi on the Gold Goast, it was
visited by a group of English chil-
dren. The captain explained that
his ship had been adopted by the
children of the Alvdal Stor School at
Osterdalen, Norway, and suggested
that the English boys and girls
should write to them.
About a week later the children at
Osterdalen received a letter from
Takoradi accompanied by a col-
lection of drawings and embroi-
deries. The English children wrote :
"Dear girls and boys,
"It is a great pleasure to send you
a collection of some of our work.
Our friend, Captain Kristiansen, has
told us about you and how you work
in your school high up in the
mountains. I expect you have to
wear sweaters and furs to keep
warm, while we try to keep cool by
wearing cotton clothes. Our school
is held on a verandah of a long, low
wooden building. We have sixteen
pupils, six of whom are in the
nursery department. Our ages range
from five to fourteen. Serious work
in the heat is difficult, but we do our
best, as most of us are going home
to the United Kingdom in the near
future.
"will you write to us and tell us
about your school ? Perhaps one day
we shall have the pleasure of
meeting you. On another page of
our book you will find the names and
United Kingdom address of the girls
and boys who would like to start a
pen-friendship. We should, how-
ever, be delighted to receive a letter
from you, here in Takoradi. May
we wish you, your parents and
teachers every happiness !'
The spirit which inspires the Ship
Adoption Societies and useful pur-
pose served by the movement are
well summed up in the words of one
of the organizers of the Irish Ship
Adoption Society :
"While we wish to remain inde-
pendent, we do not want to isolate
ourselves from the peoples of the
world with whom we wish to co-
operate in the building of a happier
and more prosperous world. The
interest which hundreds of boys and
girls in some of our leading second-
ary schools have for three years
been showing in the ship adoption
scheme is also a small contribution
of the Irish people towards the
building here of a greater under-
standing of other peoples and their
problems."
There is no reason why every
country should not have its Ship
Adoption Society. Educational au-
thorities and ship-owners through-
out the world can co-operate in
this truly modern venture to promote
education in the widest sense of the
word.

COURIER DECEMBER 1952. Page 7
ON the quayside of Reykjavik, capital ofmodern Iceland, stands a Viking carved in
granite, stern-featured beneath his winged
helmet. With his back to the sea, he leans on
the shaft of his steering-oar, his stony gaze
fixed upon the rugged circle of black and purple
volcanoes dominating the bay. It is Leifur
Eriksson (Leif the Fortunate), who discovered
America 500 years before Columbus and
established a settlement in the snowy wastes
of Labrador. Leif the Fortunate ranks not only
as the first of history's great explorers but also
as an early humorist, for, to attract colon-
ists, he gave the pleasant name of"Vinne-
land"-the country of wine-to Labrador. (It
was a tradition begun by his father, Eric
the Red, who discovered and christened
"Greenland".)
Everything about Iceland, incidentally, has a
similar stamp of fantasy-gay or tragic-
and if there is any part of the world where
Puck, fleeing from conformity with its levelling
effect on scenery and customs which is a sign
of our times, may have found refuge, it must
surely be here in Ultima Thule,'''the most
distant land", where stood, according to the
Ancients, the gate of Hell.
Iceland is a country of paradoxes, of sharp
geographical and human contrast. Though it
still bears the misnomer it was given by a near-
sighted ninth-century Norwegian, it is really
much more the island of flames than the island
of ice. Lying just below the Arctic circle, its
climate is almost as temperate as that of Brit-
tany, thanks to the Gulf Stream-a kindly
sea-serpent, whose warm coils envelop it.
Neither trees nor wheat will grow there, but
constant warm springs and geysers enable
tropical fruits to be cultivated extensively under
glass. Isolation in the cold, northern mists for
a thousand years drove Iceland to offer gene-
rous concessions in exchange for visits from
foreign ships ; today it is a vital link in the air
communications of the whole northern hemi-
sphere.
For most Europeans, there is still a spice of
adventure in the very name of Iceland, but this
is due more to the survival of legend than to
actual facts. Reykjavik can now be reached as
easily'and quickly as many of the Western
capitals-eight hours by air from London or
Amsterdam, or four or five days by sea from
Copenhagen. The last port of call before the
polar wastes, Reykjavik is a city of 50, 000 peo-
ple, a somewhat ill-assorted union between a
small Jutland community-neat little wooden
houses brightly painted in salmon pink, canary
yellow and green-and a typical American
"mushroom"town)-square, reinforced concrete
warehouses, a university and national theatre
on strong, simple lines, and a crop of apartment-
houses and bungalows with large windows,
lining miles of streets which have no pavements.
What attracted me to the shores of Thule,
however, was not this spectacle of a modern
metropolis within a stone's throw of the Pole,
nor even the marvels of northern nature with
its wild, awesome contrasts-the unending
glaciers and volcanoes in eruption, the lava fields
like storm-tossed seas, the intermingling of the
sun's blood-red and ochre colours by day, or the
twinkling lights of the Aurora Borealis by night.
I was primarily fascinated, after a long stay in
Scandinavia, by the idea of retracing, as it were,
the source of Nordic civilization in a land where
the Viking world, with scarcely any alien inter-
mixture, came to newer.
The population, incidentally, includes some
Celts (Irish and Scots) but, to the detriment of
the picturesque, not a single Eskimo.
The Vikings were not only bold seamen and
fierce pirates ; they also gave the Western
world the first example of a democratic par-
liament, the Althing, which was established in
930 AD by the oligarchy of the godords, their
clan chieftains.
Although it is relatively close to us in terms
of history, the civilization of the wild Norsemen
is so bound up with legend that its origins seem
to be lost in the mists of time. But this is not
true of Iceland, where the past is still regarded
as a living continuity and never ceases to play
its full part in daily life.
One day, with a chance acquaintance, I went
for a drive in the"countryside"-a barren chaos
of lava with, here and there, a small field of
poor grass, a flock of sheep, a few wild ponies,
and every ten miles or so a farm. I looked in
vain for the many hamlets whose names were
on my map. My friend soon explained the
reason. The names were not those of villages
or farms ; they preserved the memory of a
church which had disappeared 500 years before,
of a Viking village which had crumbled into
dust, of an historical (or legendary) event. Of
these buildings and events my companion
spoke, pointing out some invisible spot on the
inhospitable horizon with as much interest and
knowledge as though he were describing some
recent episode. Iceland is not a"museum"of
ancient Scandinavian life. The Viking heritage
is here a very part of the people's daily exist-
ence.

THE ISLAND OF ICE AND OF FIRE Most of central Iceland is a wind-sweptdesert of sand and lava, ridged by mountains
and strewn with glaciers and snowfields that never melt. The valleys of the fiords and the narrow
coastal plains in the west and south are almost the only places where man can live. An eighth of

EVERY ROOM HAS ITS OWN ROOF The traditional Icelandic farm is built partlybelow ground lev l with a separate roof for

often found in Iceland's countryside. Newer houses are made of imcorted timber or concrete.
"STORI GEYSIR", THE GREAT GEYSER More than a hundred volcanoes, some stillactive, make Iceland one of the most volcanic
regions of the world. The volcanic rocks heat countless hot springs and geysers, the largest of
which is the famous Geysir (from geysa, Icelandic word meaning"to rush forth furiously"), from
which the world's geysers take their name. The warm spring waters are piped to heat houses.

A BOOK-LOVtNG PEOPLE) N A BLEAK LAND
(Continued from page 7.)
When, one bright summer morning
in 1944, Iceland re-established th6
Republic in the very spot where it
had first been born-the majestic
amphitheatre of Thingvellir hol-
lowed out in the rock and lava beside
a mighty lake-the members of par-
liament quite naturally and unself-
consciously donned the leather cape
and breeches of the godords. The
language they used, Izlenska, the
root-language of the Scandinavian
peoples-with its archaic system of
writing and its tonal resemblances
(o the Romance languages-was very
nearly the same as that spoken by
their ancestors.
The Icelandic vocabulary is still
extraordinarily rich. It comprises
no fewer than 200, 000 words and is
far purer than any other European
language, as it has preserved 57 per
cent of the original Indo-European
roots. It has fewer than 3, 000 bor-
rowed words. Icelandic has also
preserved the old declensions and
conjugations, with all their cases
and tenses. One hundred and
twenty-five out of its 130 suffixes
date from the Aryan period. This
extraordinary, complicated"Man-
darin"is spoken by 140, 000 people.
The laws of the new State were
to include, almost unchanged, con-
siderable portions of the Jonsbok, the
; >ld customary law which was codified
in 1281. The past is everywhere alive,
even in the most common daily
practices, in the survival of customs
which, today, sometimes strike us
with surprise. The Icelanders, for
instance, have no patronymics, no
surnames handed on from father to
son. They still observe the Viking
custom, which was common in me-
diaeval Europe, of using only the
Christian name. Children add the
suffix son in the case of boys and
dottir in the case of girls. Married
women do not take their husband's
name-a custom which reflects the
respect shown to women in primitive
Germanic society.
Whatever the disadvantages of
this system, not one Icelander would
agree to give it up. This attitude is
something more than a childish,
parochial chauvinism. It is the
proud self-assertion of a small but
determined nation which has, for
ten centuries, withstood the combin-
ed assaults of malignant nature and
men-volcanic eruptions (about 100
to date), earthquakes, periods of
deadly cold, epidemics, famines, the
ravages of English or Barbary pi-
rates and the despotism of ambitious
kings already thinking of Iceland's
strategic position. Despite so many
heavy blows, whose effects are shown
in the fluctuations of the country's
still knows little of our sagas, one of
the truest treasures of the human
mind."The man who said this to
me was expressing, with some
bitterness, the unanimous opinion of
the Icelandic people. Possessing a
strong desire to escape from their
age-long isolation and having an
active interest in the culture of the
world, the people of Iceland find it
hard to understand what they regard
as a neglect of their intellectual
heritage by other peoples.

population (estimated at 80, 000 in
the eleventh century, and declining
to a mere 50, 000 at the time of the
1801 census), the people of Iceland
have never lost faith in their future ;
and this justifies their proud, non-
aggressive patriotism.
"In the past few decades, holiday-
makers have been discovering the
beauty of our scenery, sportsmen
have made acquaintance with our
trout streams, and military leaders
have begun to appreciate our stra-
tegic importance, but the world
very little is known abroad about the
ancient Icelandic literature-the
drama of the Eddas and the poetry
of the Skalds, with their complicated
and mannered metres, strange col-
lected works like the Landnamabok
(Book of Settlements), and the
lslandingabok (Book of Icelanders),
the versatile works of the church-
man Thorgilsson (1067-1148), which
are a mixture of epic, genealogy and
cadastral survey, and above all the
half-historical, half-legendary cycles
of the sagas.
I have had the opportunity to read
some English translations of these
sagas, and I am inclined to share
the opinion of the Icelanders, who
hold them worthy of comparison
with the epic masterpieces of the
West, the poems of Homer, the
Nibelungenlied or the Kalevala.
Composed between the lith and the
13th century, and mostly anonymous,
they embody with restrained and
sober lyricism the Weltanschau-
ung, the"outlook on the world"
of the Vikings, a kind of lay philo-
sophy based on the strict and stern
observation of human nature in the
light of ideas held prior to the in-
troduction of Christianity into the
country. One cannot help being
struck by the realistic intensity of
these tales, imbued with the pan-
theistic mythology of Asatru, the
cult of Othin and the belief in
Valholl (the Germanic Odin and
Walhalla). Dissension, bloody strife
and vengeance are the principal
themes, while a fate as implacable
as Sophocles'hangs over the gods
and men and inanimate things. The
thirteenth century, the golden age
of the sagas, saw the composition of
great numbers of masterpieces-the
Tale of Egill Skallagrimsson, the
Laxdaelasaga, the Hrafnhelsaga
and above all the harsh Njallsaga,
the only Icelandic work which is
comparatively well-known outside
Scandinavia, since it has been
translated into many foreign lan-
guages.
The sagas, which the school-
children of Reykjavik can read
easily in the original because the
language has changed so little, are
not only the cultural wealth of
Iceland, but are also the nation's
"public records,"its genealogical
tree. The influence of the sagas
- which are found, richly bound. in
every home, even in the isolated
farms of the hinterland-can only
be compared to that of the Bible
amongst the Puritans of colonial
America. Public discussions and
newspaper editorials are full of
references to them. I can remember
a stormy argument between half-a-
dozen rough fishermen in the fore-
castle of the trawler which I took
THE WORLD'S
MOST NORTHERN
CAPITAL CITY
More than one-third of Ice-
land's people live in Reyk-
javik (from reykur,"smoke"
hence"smoking harbour"),
the chief port and capital,
which looks like a small
Jutland community in an
American"mushroom"
city. Amid one-storey homes
are buildings which, illus-
trate the importance of cul-
ture in the lives of the
people : the National
Library and the National
Theatre (photo on left),
the University and other
educational institutions.
Iceland reads more books
than any other nation in
proportion to population.
ICELAND HAS
A NAME THAT
IS MISLEADING.
Natural hot springs tapped
near Reykjavik provide water
almost at boiling point for
3, 000 homes and warm
538, 000 square feet of glass-
houses, the rate of flow
being about 88 gallons a
second. In these glass-
houses are grown bananas,
pineapples and other tropi-
cal fruit. ! n some places
water is piped through the
soil to warm it for growing
green crops, and is also
used in open-air swimming
pools. In fact, the name
Iceland is rather mislead-
ing, for this country is
much more the land of
flames than the land of ice.

on my return journey. It was not
about women or liquor smuggling,
but was in fact a literary discussion
on some obscure point in a no less
obscure saga, in which my seamen-
commentators appeared to display
remarkable erudition.
Icelandic culture has by no means
become petrified in fruitless con-
templation of the past. This is
shown by the tremendous amount of
educational work being done, in
which the most up-to-date teaching
methods are prominent. As he
goes about the country, the traveller
is struck by the large number of
large modern buildings standing by
themselves far away from the town.
With their petrol pumps, their
swimming pools fed by warm mineral
springs, their pleasant guest-rooms,
and sometimes even their own
small aerodromes. they are comfort-
able stopping-places for travellers.
Except during the two summer
months, however, they are not hotels
but simply country schools. The
pupils come by jeep, or riding ponies,
over miles and miles of mountains
or lava. The total enrolment in the
schools and universities of Iceland
is 28, 000, or 20 per cent of the popu-
lation ; last year, the State allotted
28, 300, 000 kromer (over f560, 000) to
education, out of a total budget of
256, 000, 000 kromer. There are 20, 000
children in the elementary schools
alone.
Iceland is a nation where illiteracy
has been banished, and whose
people are in fact among the best
educated in the world (one is soon
convinced of this after talking to
the"man in the street", who often
speaks several languages). The
people have also a remarkable res-
pect for the printed word, as is
shown by the enormous number of
bookshops in the country, all, so I
was told, doing a very thriving
business. I was always surprised,
when passing through a small town
with a few thousand inhabitants,
such as Akureyri or Vestmannaeyjar,
to see bookshops whose luxury
offered a sharp contrast with the
primitive austerity of other shops.
During the six long months of
Arctic night, when their work is
considerably slowed down, the Ice-
landers devour hundreds of books,
mainly translations of world classics
and popular scientific works. Pub-
lication for so small a market is not
a very good commercial proposition,
and as a result copyright laws have
sometimes been stretched. But we
can hardly criticize the Icelanders
for this, nor discourage their eager
curiosity, especially as an acute
shortage of foreign currency has
caused large restrictions in foreign
book imports. Friends of mine in
Iceland told me, in this connexion,
how sorry they were that Iceland
was not yet a member of Unesco, as
the Book Coupon Scheme would
make it possible to remedy a short-
age whose effects are particulary
felt in university circles. On a more
general basis, the inclusion of the
country in a great international
organization would meet one of the
deepest wishes of the Icelanders,
who still feel the hereditary dread
of cultural isolation.
Without dealing exhaustively with
intellectual developments in Iceland
- with its wide variety of news-
papers, its national theatre where
works by Shakespeare, Pirandello
and Bernard Shaw are presented in
the language of the Vikings, its
symphony orchestra and so forth-
I should like to mention the most
surprising feature of this small
country's intellectual life, namely its
great wealth of contemporary artists
and writers worthy of international
fame. If the word had not lost
much of its force, this might well be
described as a miracle ; but it is a
miracle brought about by intelligent
action, by wise State patronage,
which enables men who cannot
count on a large enough audience
within the boundaries of their own
country to maintain a decent
standard of living while practising
their art. Among these men are
Halldor Jiljan Laxness, the powerful
novelist, considered by Scandinavian
as comparable with the world's
great writers ; Gunnar Gunnarsson,
the novelist and essayist, some of
whose works written in Danish have
earned him an honoured place ;
the painter Johannes Kjarval, a
Van Gogh of the Arctic ; the por-
trait-painter Jon Stefansson, a
brilliant pupil of Matisse ; the
sculptor Sogurjon Olafsson, and
others. This galaxy of talent gives
the smallest and least favoured of
the Nordic nations a prestige out of
all proportion to its poverty and its
tiny population.
The picture Iceland affords us is
not merely that of a progressive
people clinging doggedly to life in
the most inhospitable of geo-
graphical surroundings. It is that of
the triumph of the Spirit where
Matter is most difficult to master,
that of Arctic solitude overcome by
a bond of union which links the
dweller in Farthest Thule to all
mankind, in the love of the truest
treasures of humanity. It is an
outstanding example of spiritual
vitality.

### Darkness, not light, makes flowers bloom
Page 12. DECEMBER 1952 UNESCO.
Photo Z.Mihanoff.
by Dr. Gerald WENDT
IT is light that makes plants grow but itits darkness that makes them blossom. By
day the leaves absorb the energy of the
sun and build the body of the plant from mater-
ials that are taken from the soil and the air.
Water and carbon dioxide gas are chemically
combined to make the materials that comprise
the stem, the leaves and the roots. Without
sunlight there would be no plants, therefore no
food for animals-and no animals. There
would be no life on earth.
But plant life cannot go on unless there are
seeds, which usually come from flowers or
blossoms. And the development of flowers is
dependent on periods of darkness, according
to recent botanical'research. Without the
right amount of darkness even healthy plants
do not bloom and without seeds most food plants
would soon die out. So the alternation of light
and darkness is needed for the continuance of
life on earth.
The role of darkness is so important that it
controls the geographical distribution of many
types of plants over the earth. Some need a
short night, some a long one. In the tropics the
night does not vary much in length at various
times of the year ; in summer, as in the winter
months, both day and night are about twelve
hours long. But in the higher latitudes, towards
the poles, both north and south, the summer
nights are short and the day long. Only those
plants can survive there which need only a
short night for their flower production.
Sugar cane, for instance, needs a twelve-
hour night and will never come to flower away
from the tropics because in the temperate zones
the summer nights are too short. The cockle-
burr, on the other hand, needs only a nine-hour
night and will throve as far north as 50"off lati-
tude, where the nine-hour night comes in August
so that blooms may come and seeds may form
before the coming of frost. Still farther north
(or south) of the equator the nine-hour night
comes too late in the season so that seeds do not
ripen in time and the plant dies out. Plants
that grow wild in the far north or south need
only a short night to stimulate their flowerings.
The discovery of the important role of dark-
ness in plant reproduction is a story of modern
botanical research, told by Professor A. W. Nay-
lor of Yale University in a recent issue of the
Scientific A merican. The most surprising dis-
Fovery was the simple fact that it is the length
of the dark period that counts in flower forma-
tion. A chrysanthemum flowers only when the
days are short and the nights long. Darkening
it by day does not affect its blooming but if It
is put into artificial light for even a short time
during the night it does not bloom. The dark-
ness is then too short. Florists are learning to
bring their plants to flower whenever they want
them by controlling the length of the dark
period. But flower-lovers who bring blossom-
ing plants home from holiday trips to the north
or south often find that they grow well but
never bloom. A change in latitude of only 150
miles (250 kilometers) makes a small difference
in the length of the night but it is sometimes
enough to make flowering impossible.
But this was only the beginning of the
research. There was still the question of how
the length of darkness can have so profound an
effect on the life of the plant. Darkness itself
is only the absence of light. What goes on in
the dark that makes the flowers bud and grow ?
Growth is a chemical process. Does darkness'
then produce a special chemical in the plant
which in turn produces flowers ? This bizarre
guess proved to be correct. What this chemical
is is not yet known, but that it exists is now
quite sure.
The proof of its existence came from many
laboratories, in the Netherlands, in the U. S. A.
and in the U. S. S. R. Nearly twenty years ago,
Professor Knott of Cornell University (U. S. A.),
got a clue when he experimented with spinach
plants, \which bloom in the summer on a
long day and a short night. For part of the day
he covered the little stem where the flowers
would sprout, thus putting them in'darkness
and changed, in effect, the length of day and
night. But the flowers budded and grew as
usual. Then he gave the leaves a shorter period
of darkness. In this case the plants refused to
flower. The action of darkness is therefore on
the leaves and not on the flower bud.
This was proved by other research workers
who found that when all the leaves were taken
from the plant, no flowers formed but if even
one leaf remained and had the proper alterna-
tion of day and night the flowers came. Pro-
fessors Hamner and Bonner of the Universitv of
Chicago (U. S. A.) worked with the cockle-burr.
They found that even one-eighth of a leaf kept
for the necessary nine hours in darkness stimu-
lated flower formation, no matter how much
light or dark fell on the rest of the plant. This
was taken as proof that the proper period of
darkness on one leaf or less produces a chemi-
cal that travels through the plant and starts
flower formation.
Other investigators went even further and
grafted a number of plants together. Even
six plants grafted together in a row all flower-
ed together when a single leaf was given the
nine hours of darkness.
Even more surprising is that the flower-pro-
ducing chemical seems to be the same in all
plants because a leaf from an entirely different
plant can be grafted to another plant and will
still produce the same effect of stimulating the
formation of blossoms.
There is much interest among botanists to
discover what this chemical is. If it could be pre-
pared in pure form and plants could be treated
with it then any plant could be brought to
flowering at any time. This would make it
possible to grow flowering plants far from their
natural home. It would make it possible for
florists to offer blossoms of any climate or area
by the simple device of providing the chemical
that nature can make only by the proper alter-
nation of light and darkness. Even more
important from the point of view of agriculture
is the fact that this would permit the plant
breeder to get blossoms at the same time on
two different varieties which usually bloom at
different times. He would thus be able to cross
or hybridize them, and obtain new and valuable.
varieties which are at present impossible.
Although the fact that periods of darkness
produce such a stimulating chemical is new, it
is well known that many chemicals have a
direct effect in stimulating or inhibiting root
growth, leaf growth, even flower growth. They
are sometimes known as plant hormones, but
are more correctly called auxins. Already, some
plants can be sprayed to prevent them from
'lowering and others can be sprayed with differ-
ent chemicals to increase the number and size
of the flowers produced. In a few commercial
operations these methods have proved profit-
able. In the pineapple fields of Hawaii, for
instance, the flowers naturally develop through-
out the summer so that only part of the field is
ripe for picking at any one time. But if a field
of pineapples is sprayed with a chemical called
naphthalene-acetic acid, then in six to eight
weeks the entire field blossoms at once. Conse-
quently, the entire field of pineapples ripens at
once and can be harvested by machinery. This
has enormously reduced the cost of harvesting
and therefore the cost of pineapples.
In Hawaii also. experiments are now under
way to increase the flowering of the litchi-nut
trees. This delicious fruit has not become com-
mercial because in Hawaii only about four per-
cent of the trees come to bloom. But when
the orchards are sprayed with naphthalene-
acetic acid nearly 00 percent of the trees blos-
som and bear fruit. This discovery may create
a new industry for Hawaii and for other areas
of the earth.
In other plants it is desirable to prevent
flowering. In the case of lettuce and celery, for
instance, the leaves are edible and important
and the growers wish to prevent the formation
of blossoms and seed. In this case, chemicals
can be used to delay the formation of flowers.
On the other hand, growers of celery-seed can
spray with a different chemical and thereby
promote seed formation.
Interference with the natural growth of plants
for the benefit of man is thus not uncommon in
special cases, but the largest and most import-
ant development will come when botanists
learn the chemical nature of the substance that
is produced by all plants and which is neces-
sary to begin the formation of buds, followed
by blossoms and seeds. At present, plants
depend on the night to form this unknown che-
mical, but once it is identified, and manufac-
tured darkness may no longer be needed
because that chemical could then be injected
into the stem of the plant. It is as if animals
and men were freed of the necessity of sleeping.
The major prospect perhaps is that in that case
the far northern and southern regions of the
world might become productive because the
long days and even the midnight sun would not
interfere with the production of valuable food
crops.

### Liberia has appointed the first U.N. travelling teacher
COURIER DECEMBER 1952. Page 13
LIBERIA HAS APPOINTED THE FIRST
U. N. TRAVELLING TEACHER
I never thought I would come across ayoung white girl walking all alone
along a jungle path in Liberia. It
surprised me all the more in this coun-
try-the only independent Negro state
in Africa-where only Negroes can
become naturalized citizens, and where
until seven years ago, only a handful of
foreigners even lived in the capital,
Monrovia.
It was not until 1945 that a forward-
looking president opened the frontiers of
Liberia to whites. Even today the white
population is made up of only a few
hundred foreigners, most of them em-
ployees on an American rubber planta-
tion, businessmen, officials working on a
contract basis, or diplomats. There are
also a number of missionaries.
I suppose you would call the young
American girl I found walking in the
jungle a missionary too. But she is
probably the only one of her kind in the
world. Her"mission"is the United
Nations, and the words that she spreads
from village to village are those of inter-
national co-operation. Her name is
Miss Dora Lee Allen and she is the
world's first"Travelling Teacher for
the United Nations".
The strangest thing about this un-
by AndrÃ© BLANGHET
usual"missionary"is that she is not
officially connected with the United Na-
tions at all. The idea originally came
from the President of Liberia, Mr. Wil-
liam S. Tubman who conceived the tra-
velling teacher scheme as a gesture of
gratitude towards international organi-
zations such as Unesco, the World Health
Organization, the International Labour
Organization and the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization, whose technical
assistance experts are helping to mo-
dernize the country.
Miss Allen thus is an official of the
Liberian Government, and all facilities
and transport for her work are provided
by the authorities. Every day she goes
off to tell the schoolchildren in the dif-
ferent primary schools about the United
Nations, the things it stands for and the
work it is doing.
Primary schools in Liberia are far
from rich. Few of them, even in Mon-
rovia, have enough desks or tables.
Almost always the children have to sit
crammed together on tiny benches. And
since none of the schools is provided
with electricity, Miss Allen is unable, for
the moment at least, to illustrate her les-
sons with films which the U. N. Informa-
tion Centre could provide free of charge.
There are many things in the coun-
tryside of Liberia which remind one of
the American South. Between 1821 and
1860, about 10, 000 American Negroes
landed on the West Coast of Africa and
set up the first independent Negro
Republic on the African continent. They
brought with them an architectural style
which was far removed from the tradi-
tional mud hut one usually associates
with Africa. They constructed their
homes in the Southern Colonial style-
tall wooden houses with corrugated iron
roofs and a verandah built on all sides.
The old Baptist church in Johnson-
ville, with its bell tower housed in a
separate wooden structure, also makes
one think of the South. For want of
other accommodation, this rusty iron
church, with its dilapidated floor-boards
and-more important-its benches, is
used as a school for 150 pupils.
Soon after Miss Allen arrived, the
school was brightened up by a small
multi-coloured tree with 60 branches and
leaves, symbolizing the United Nations,
which was placed next to the artificial
flowers on the altar. From the car that
had brought her from Monrovia, through
a geometrically laid-out plantation of
rubber, trees, there came a series of post-
ers, pictures, diagrams and other panels
which make up Miss Allen's travelling
teaching equipment.
To the boys and girls in this school,
who have never seen a train or a paved
road, but who are all eager for learning,
Miss Allen has been bringing a new kind
of picture of the outside world with her
exhibits and her lessons.
Wherever she arrives, classes are inter-
rupted so that everyone can welcome
her. The teachers
- most of whom (Con tin u e d
lack even simple on next page.)
Liberia has been undergoing large-scale technological and social changes in
recent years. These have created increasing demands for skilled workers and
an alert, literate population, which Unesco technical assistance missions are
helping to develop. Above, Liberians study leaflet on what is being achieved.
The University of Monrovia is now developing its faculty of science. With Unesco
aid, classes have been equipped with microscopes and other laboratory equip-
ment and a team of science teachers has been sent to Liberia. Here, a New
Zealand biology teacher, Mr A. J. D. Barker, instructs a class at the University.
Education games are encouraged by the Liberian
Government as a"painless"way of learning. This
is a letter card game. Liberians are told"Poverty
and disease cannot be fought without literacy. It is
a patriotic duty of every citizen to spread education."
Unesco technical aid experts from seven countries
meet weekly at the Ministry of Education in Monrovia
with government and university officials. These
meetiflgs are considered so important that Liberia's
Vice-President (back to camera) attends regularly.
Liberia has undertaken a fundamental education
experiment in the region of Dimeh, 20 miles from
the capital. Above, Unesco technical assistance
scientist, Mr W. S. Rankin, registers people for
a routine health visit at a rustic jungle dispensary.

United Nations and why and how it was
set up. Slowly and simply she outlines
her theme.
"Now, let's take a few notes,"she
says, and rows of heads bend over twice
as many knees which must serve tem-
porarily as desks.,
The lesson over, there will be seven
days to think over what Miss Allen has
been explaining-and to do some"home-
work". Before going on to the next
village, Miss Allen leaves a set of ques-
tions for the children to answer in writ-
ing, or gives a subject for an essay on
international co-operation. On her
next visit, she corrects their"home-
work". Miss Allen's lessons require a
good deal of work on the part of her
pupils. They are not mere"pep talks",
to be listened to half-heartedly. The
results she has achieved thus far prove
that the U. N. is becoming an understood
reality in this tiny country.
Every week, Miss Allen brings her
panels to the older children in 15 dif-

ferent schools. Her largest classes are
in Monrovia itself, in an extremely over-
crowded school. An hour after leaving
the capital, she may be giving a lesson in
an open-air class under a mango tree, in
a village on the edge of the Liberian
forest.,
To reach the village, she has had to
drive through a maze of forest tracks,
almost indistinguishable one from an-
other. These tracks often give out some
distance from the village. Followed by
her chauffeur, who, carrying her posters
and display board, looks rather like a
sandwich-men she then sets off on foot.
As she passes, people wave a friendly

Sometimes the villages are even more
isolated, so like other missionaries she

two or four bearers.
What Miss Allen is trying to do may
not seem very far-reaching compared
with similar efforts in other countries.
But it should not be forgotten that Libe-
ria is a small and still a very poor
nation. Yet in this country which is
struggling to transform its economy and
raise its standard of living, the aware-
ness of the role of the United Nations is
great, What, for example, could be more
symbolic of its belief in the world com-
munity and its ideals than its choice of
having its children taught about the
United Nations-by a foreigner.
UNICEF
SENDS

THE REINDEER : Even in a tiny Finnish village some 70 miles north of the Arctic Circle,
needy children are not forgotten by UNICEF. Supplies are sent to them by raindeer and sled.
THE spirit of Christmas and the New Year, which
is a time of colour and gaiety, and above all, a
**-time of joy for children, has been captured
delightfully in a series of five Greeting Cards for 1952
produced by the United Nations International Children's
Emergency Fund. On the theme.'Round the World
with UNICEF"the cards depict some of the favourite
animals of children in different parts of the world-
the camel, the elephant, the reindeer, the donkey and
the water buffalo-bearing cargoes of food and
medicine to the needy.
These cards serve as a reminder of the work UNICEF
has been carrying out among many millions of the
world's children and of the need for continued
contributions to its fund. Each box of five cards sold
will help UNICEF to provide enough BCG vaccine to
immunize 12 children against TB ; or enough DDT
powder to protect 10 children against malaria ; or
enough skim milk to give eight children a glass of milk
every day for a week.
UNICEF helps countries to help themselves, the
nations receiving its help"'matching"the value of the
Organization's aid locally, thereby doubling and often
trebling the numbers of children reached. When
present programmes are completed, one out of every
15 children in the world will have received some form
of UNICEF aid.
In addition, this year's official United Nations
Greeting Card,-an interpretation of the U. N. build-
ing in its New York setting-designed and donated
by the famous French artist, Raoul Dufy, is being sold
for the benefit of UNICEF.
Assorted boxes of ten of the five UNICEF cards, or
a box of ten U. N. cards with or without the Season's
Greetings in the five official U. N. languages can be
obtained at the following addresses :
THE CAMEL : In the desert areas of Jordan,
Gaza and Lebanon, a caravan of cameis laden
with barrels of powdered milk marked UNICEF,
wends its way slowly over the hot sands.
They are destined for mothers and children
among the Middle East refugees. Other
supplies go to 30, 000 children and mothers in
Gaza who are non-refugees, but whose families
have lost their lands and their livelihood.
THE DONKEY : Across the thorny scrub
and high sierras, a small boy guides a sturdy
donkey. Laden with dried milk and other
supplies, donkeys are bringing an extra meal
for 360, 000 Latin American children. Among
the projects assisted by UNICEF in 21 Latin
American countries and territories, Mother and
Child Health Centres and child feeding pro-
grammes have very largely predominated.
THE WATER-BUFFALO : In South-East
Asia, where 1, 000 mother and child welfare
centres have been equipped by UNICEF, there
are many areas where transporting supplies
is a difficult problem. During the rainy season
even jeeps cannot penetrate to the remote
villages and journeys have to be made by a
convoy of buffalo carts. Supplies are also load-
ed into sampans which go down the canals.

### For those who live by the pen
' : OUR ; ER DECEMBER 1952. Page I 5
FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BY THE PEN
THROUGHOUT the centuries the history of writ-
ers as a class has been one of continuous
material difficulties. This may well have
been due to the tradition that the written word
was sacred and therefore not for sale ; to the
mass of the people the writer was a kind of priest
and as such was forbidden to exploit his priest-
hood for his own gain.
The normal work of the.'scribe"-the man
who could write-was to copy the sacred scrip-
tures and it was through such copyists that the
Persian Zendavesta, the Hindu Ramayana and
Mahabharata, the Torah and Talmud, the Bible
and Gospels and the Mohammedan Koran were
handed down to us. Moreover, as well as being
sacred, writing was thought to have definite
magical powers. To make a curse more effective
and surer to break the thread of the victim's
destiny, it was scratched with a pointed im-
plement-a stylus-on the waxed tablets on
which Romans wrote before parchment or papy-
rus came in. For the written word remains.
Even today when we speak of things we had felt
were bound to happen all along, we say they
were"written".
Writing was the privilege and responsibility of
a small caste and from the times of classical
Greece these men regarded themselves as the spi-
ritual guides of their people. Again, because the
written word is"imperishable", the law has been
"written"ever since the tablets of stone of the
10 Commandments on Sinai and the Twelve
Tables of early Roman law were produced and
promulgated to leave no excuse for ignorance of
the law. This promulgation was done by
formal public reading of the text. From the
time the spread of printing made newspapers
possible, new laws have been
published in the daily press or
official gazettes.
With the crushing weight of
such traditions pressing down on
it, the writers'trade has ever
been thankless, hard and with
more than its share of perils and
even disaster : it is worth
remembering that both calamity
and the calamus (1), or reed
pen, which for centuries was the
typical tool of the writer, are
connected in philology and also
in mythology. Fame-if he
won it-was the greatest reward
a writer could hope for : what he
got rather more commonly was
prison or exile and the gallows or
the stake if he fell into hetero-
doxy or heresy. But in the story
of man's fight for freedom, it is
the writers, nevertheless, who
hold the place of honour as the
awakeners, in every age, of the
spirit of resistance to tyranny.
The Frenah Revolution, for
example, was the work of the
Encyclopaedists.
Books themselves have always
been eagerly sought and, both
before and after the invention of
printing, works by certain philo-
sophers, mathematicians, astro-
nomers and historians, in print
or manuscript, have sometimes
fetched fabulous sums. However,
until the 19th century, the maker
of the books-the writer-was
not muc. h better placed than a
mediaeval serf bound to the land
who farmed his lord's acres.
dwelt there at his lord's pleasure
to keep other nobles out, and
who had to drop everything to
follow his master to the wars, at
the peril of his life, but, in the
serf's case, on foot and un-
armoured.
Save in the East and in the
Islamic sphere, Eastern and
Western, where there was gene-
rous patronage of writers, such
patronage as existed was confin-
ed to the artists who adorned the
palaces of the rich and there
was. not a copper to spare for the long and toil-
some work of the writers whose loving care
created the intellectual heritage of mankind
and built the steps for civilization to climb
higher.
Don Quixote achieved worldwide fame so
quickly that in its author's lifetime it had been
translated into the tongues of all the civilized
peoples of his day. Yet Cervantes lived and died
in poverty and had to serve at various times as
a soldier and a tax-collector to keep body and soul
together. Another professional soldier, and an
exile from Lisbon, was Camoens, the greatest Por-
tuguese poet of all time, who sang his country's
glories in the Lusiads : he too died in the
blackest poverty. Shakespeare did make some
money during his life but it was as a producer and
actor and not as the author of the immortal
plays.
For five and twenty centuries authorship was
so exclusively a labour of love that it could only
be indulged in by those who by nature were not
afraid of sacrifices or by the privileged who wrote
byjfoMde BEN/TO
in their leisure time, like Sir Francis Bacon.
For one Erasmus or Voltaire, favoured by a sover-
eign and with some sort of pension from him,
there is an unnumbered multitude of writers of
works of science, literature and philosophy who
paid for the boldness of their thought with their
hides or lives. Let us not forget Galileo, Servet or
Pico de la Mirandola.
There was yet another hardship under which
the professional writer laboured. Strictly speaking
he did not"make"actual books ; he only wrote
them and the printer did the manufacturing.
The finished article was sold, not by the author,
but by a bookseller and as he was risking his
money in his business he could get exclusive sales
or printing rights in the merchandise he handled.
However while the actual book was"merchand-
ise"to the seller and even the buyer, what was
in the book was never counted as the merchandise
or saleable property of the author. So freedom
was actually easier for the villein to win than
independence for the author, since the earth and
its fruits are tangible things and as such can be
acquired as property, which every villein aimed
to have and some actually achieved, so as to
become a free peasant.
Before they could accept the notion that ideas
could be property, lawyers had to break free of
the rigid definitions of the Roman law which held
that only material things like land or cattle or
goods could be owned ; even though writing them
down did in one sense give them a physical shape,
ideas were not material things in the Roman
sense. So the process was a long one and for
(1) The calamus was a thin reed used by the people of
old for writing on papYl'Us or parchment. It was cut and
shaped in till'same l1 : ay as the quill} len later on and wasused with vary thic/ ; ink. In the pictorial symbolism of
mythology, Calamity is shown as a mourning wotan veiledin blacl, and leaning on a calamus, symbol of the insecurity
of human fortune.
thousands of years authors took'it for granted
that writing-setting forth their ideas-might
bring them fame or honours or shame, but never
a livelihood. The result was to deprive mankind
of the contributions of many who could not face
the sacrifices which authorship demanded-
though undoubtedly the loss in quantity was offset
by the quality of those who obeyed the imperious
need to give their vision of the truth without
balking at the complications which might follow.
The fact was that writers had to count on some
other profession for a living-sometimes teach-
ing, like the numerous writers from the univer-
sities, and at other times a trade. For instance
Spinoza earned his bread as a spectacle-maker, so
as to be able to produce the great philosophical
work which is the origin of many of the human
rights now recognized by law. It was not until
the daily press came into being, and with it the
serial as a bait for readers, that there was any
possibility of getting a living by the pen. The
first man to dare to describe himself simply as
an author and to make it his sole profession was
Balzac. His output was prodigious and he earned
a good living ; indeed though he tried several
times to change to another profession, each time
he was driven back to writing by the failure of
his latest industrial or financial scheme. It was
he who first had the idea of convening a meeting
of the other serial writers and men of letters of
Paris to found the first Authors'Society to protect
the interests of those who had to live by their
pens. However, as often happens, the awakening
of the corporate spirit of authors was a cumula-
tive process and not the result of explicit recog-
nition of their right to enjoy the fruit of their
work.
In 1709, under Queen Anne, an Act was promul-
gated in England"for the encouragement of
learning, by vesting copies of printed books in
the authors or purchasers of such copies, during
times therein mentioned". Ten of the 13 American
States which issued laws on copyright between
1783 and 1786 took the view that it was a natural
right and one of them went so far as to speak
of there being"no property more peculiarly a
man's own than that which is produced by the
Jabour of his mind". However in all these laws-
as later in the Federal Constitution of the United
States-the concessions were treated merely as
a means of assisting the progress of science and
the useful arts and the unfortunate authors had
to continue the fight, with the profit from their
works in most cases going to the publishers and
booksellers. In France, Beaumarchais concerned
himself with the protection of the rights of play-
wrights and as a result of his efforts the first laws
on performance and publication rights were pro-
mulgated in 1791 and 1793 respectively.
As far as copyright and its accompanying finan-
cial benefits were concerned, the second half of
the 19th century was a real spring-time. In every
country there was a spate of domestic legislation
on copyright, while international dealings in
books and the question of their translation into
other languages raised new problems. The first
attempt to tackle the latter was
in the Berne International Con-
vention of 1886, later amended
at Berlin in 1920, at Rome in 1928,
and at Brussels in 1948. In the
Americas a second international
system took shape under the
terms of the Montevideo Treaty
of 1889 subsequently revised at
the Pan American Conferences in
Mexico, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos
Aires and Havana and now re-
classed as the Washington Inter-
American Convention on the
rights of the author in literary,
scientific and artistic works.
This dates from June 1946.
However, the Berne Convention
does not cover all the non-Ame-
rican, nor the Washington Con-
vention all the American, States,
while the need to protect dif-
ferent interests in the two areas
has led to clashes of principle
between the two conventions on
certain points. When principles
are in convict, the victory of one
implies the utter defeat of the
other and hence the whole ques-
tion of securing effective world-
wide protection of the rights of
authors of works of the mind had
reached an impasse from which
it was hard to see the way out.
In 1947 at the Second General
Conference of Unesco in Mexico,
it was decided that the drafting
of a Universal Convention to
proffer a solution to the main
difficulties arising over interna-
tional copyright was desirable.
After five years'work, collection
of materials, meetings of experts
and struggles with the obstacles
which inevitably arose, the re-
presentatives of 36 nations from
every continent last September
formally signed the first Univer-
sal Copyright Convention. The
governing principle of the new
Convention is that the same pro-
tection shall be given by each
signatory country to foreign works
as to those by its own nationals ;
it also enormously simplifies the
formalities required for the en-
forcement of copyright and includes wise and
equitable provisions on translation.
This new world-wide Convention embodies
clauses specifying that it shall not in any way
affect the provisions of the Berne Convention or
abrogate multi-lateral and bilateral conventions
which may be in force between two or more Ame-
rican Republics, or two or more contracting
States ; that no reservations shall be permitted
- a most important point, since more than one
convention has foundered on accepting reser-
vations about its implementation-and that
Unesco itself, which prepared the way for the
Convention, shall be the body acting as Secre-
tariat of the Intergovernmental Commission for
the supervision of its proper application and for
the reception of instruments of ratification and
denunciation.
Annexed to the text of the Universal Conven-
tion are three additional protocols : the first on
the application of the Convention to the works
of stateless persons and refugees ; the second on
its application tithe publications of certain
international organizations ; and the third on the
means of determining the effective date of instru-
ments of ratification, acceptance or accession.
When the text was signed, in English, Spanish
and French in Geneva, one of the delegates said :"'Justice has won a fresh victory".

children must have wished that they too could set off on a voyage

lists of national products. How different too it would be if Columbus,

thing approaching this ideal is possible today for thousands of
children in schools associated with Ship Adoption Societies which
have been formed in five European countries. Thanks to these
Societies the schoolchildren are in constant touch with scores of
ships on the oceans and in ports and harbours. They follow the
fortunes and progress of the ships through the eyes of the captains
and crews with whom they exchange visits and letters. In this way,
geography-above all a human science-makes an important contri-
bution to international understanding. Thanks to the accounts of
voyages and visits they receive from"their"captains and crews,
the schoolchildren get really"live"lessons for, as an old Dutch
proverb puts it,"He who travels a great deal has a great deal to
tell."The interest and enthusiasm aroused in schools gives a
general impetus to a child's desire for learning. For an account of
