The Thai Government has approved
a 20-year project to restore Ayutya,
the ancient capital of Siam, which,
until the middle of the 18th century,
was a busy, bustling city criss¬
crossed by innumerable canals and
richly endowed with artistic trea¬
sures. This rubbing of a sculptured
stone relief is one of 153 panels
depicting the story of Rama, a hero
of Hindu mythology. This "Rama-
yana" in stone once decorated a
temple in Ayutya and is now in the
Temple of the Sleeping Buddha, in
Bangkok, the capital of Thailand.

AYUTYA
VENICE OF SOUTH ASIA
by Sumet Jumsai na Ayutya
OME eighty miles north of
the Gulf of Siam, up the
river Chao Phya, past and beyond
Bangkok, we come to the heart of the
Indochinese Peninsula. Here amid
the fertile expanse of the, delta lands
and rice fields is situated a ruined city,
its derelict pagodas and' its clusters
of jungle foliage outlined against the
skyline. As one approaches this
green mass of vegetation, more
pagodas and other structures such as
brick arches of former bridges, walls
and ramparts can be seen. Hidden
under all this, under the trees and the
reeds, one of the world's most
fascinating cities lies buried.
This is Ayutya (variously written as
Ayudhya, Ayuthia, Ayutthaya, and
Ayut'ia) the biggest and most cosmo¬
politan city of the seventeenth century
south of China. Originally the city
dates back to the eighth century when
the Thais were still predominently in

jungle vege'tation. Standing out above the trees (above), are the slender pinnacles of
the three stupas of Wat Phra Sri-sanphet, the greatest and most beautiful of the city's temples.
A colossal statue of the
Reclining Buddha (right),
measuring 28 metres (90 ft.)
today lies amid the
ruins of Ayutya, Siam's
ancient capital which was
destroyed in 1767.

to date from the
16th century, and is
named after the temple,
which once housed it the
Wat Lokaya-sudha
(Temple of Water of
Immortality on Earth).

cartographer. It reveals the
astonishing originality of this city

network of canals criss-crossed
the city, constructed on a
natural peninsular formed by
the meandering Menam river.
A by-pass canal made the peninsular
into an Island. A bustling
activity reigned in this Venice

buildings today reveal
architecture of exceptional
richness and variety. Right, the

what is now the southern Chinese pro¬
vince of Yunnan, and when Angkor,
built on a monumental scale, was the
most thriving urban centre with its
empire ruling over most of the Indo-
chinese subcontinent.
Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty
conquered the Thais of Yunnan in 1250
and made that province part of China
once and for all. This led to an
emigration of the Thais southwards
where several independent Thai
kingdoms or city states were already
being formed at the expense of the
Kmer Empire, and on the decline of its
capital city, Angkor.
Ayutya was the last to emerge
towards the end of the fourteenth
century as the capital of Siam which
was to become the most powerful of
the Thai kingdoms and the only one
to remain independent throughout its
history. Ayutya continued to be the
Siamese capital until 1767 when a
Burmese army destroyed it completely.
Since then the seat of government has
been Bangkok.
Most of the Thais remained a
mountain or valley people, like those
who stayed in Yunnan or those who
settled immediately south of China,
from Assam and the Shan States to
Laos and most of what is now North
Viet-Nam. But those who penetrated
further south into the rich delta lands
very quickly developed into an
"aquatic" society, with paddy rice
cultivation and waterways as the
source of their wealth and power.
The first immigrants, then, came into
the powerful Kmer ' Empire. They
came into contact with a highly
advanced "hydraulic" society whose
power was founded upon rice agri¬
culture which was served by the most
gigantic hydraulic installation ever
devised. In the centre of this system,
and controlling it, stood the city of
Angkor.
The world at that time had many
water towns and cities with varying
degrees of hydraulic sophistication.
Before Angkor, there had been
Shantan in China which was conceived
and built as a gigantic urban machine
operated and serviced by water.
Soochow, in the Kiangsu Province,
which is probably the most beautiful
and completely planned canal city,
dates at least one thousand years
before Venice and its contemporary,
Angkor, and therefore well before the
Dutch water towns, before AyutyaJ
Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), which
incidentally has become a completely
"dry" city, and still later cities like
Batavia (Jakarta) and Bangkok (both
now becoming more or less "dry"),
and St. Petersburg (Leningrad) still
invariably known as the "Venice of
the North".
But Angkor was different in
that it came into being through
the coincidence of three factors:
geography, technology, and urban
symbolism. The particular geography
with its floods and draining direction
dictated a particular form of water
"sculpture" which was relèvent to both
hydraulic engineering and cosmo-
magic orientation. The Kmer city was
the microcosm of Hindu cosmology
with its formal disposition of the water
and the solid elements.
The Thais of the emerging Siam
were pragmatists and flexible in their
outlook. Although extensive canal¬
ization was embarked upon, the
precise and somewhat vulnerable
hydraulic planning of the Kmers made
no impression on them. There was
no real attempt to control water ;
instead, the whole society was part of
water, living on it and flowing with it.
Monumental structures and rigid urban
symbolism gave way to what was the
most practical and easiest solution of
building a city. Therefore they chose
first of all an existing settlement
complete with the essential urban
organization which was well placed in

the middle of the rich delta lands.
This was the eighth century city of
Ayutya.
Aerial photographs and a preliminary
analysis show that Ayutya was a city
of canals, with building compounds
defined by and integrated into a
network of waterways. In 1350,
soon after the arrival of the Thais, the
old site lost its importance when a
newer urban centre was built
immediately to the west, in a natural
peninsula formed by a big meandering
river. A by-pass canal was constructed
to make the peninsula into an island.
Here was the Siamese solution of
doing the least work in exchange for
a maximum result.
The city was given a wide moat and
a "ring road" which was always made
navigable and flushed by the action
of nature. Gradually two more big
rivers nearby were linked to the new
urban centre by the numerous by-pass
canals. The newer city, now known
as Ayutya, became the junction of
three very important rivers. To the
north, it gained access to and control
over the northern Thai kingdoms; to
the south the river led to the open sea
and the control of the Malay Peninsula
as well as the international trade
between India and Japan.
Agricultural products and trade
converged upon Ayutya on boats.
The canals were the all-weather
highways. From the "ring road" or
moat, they were led through water-
gates into the innumerable canals
within the confines of the city wall, and
eventually to the palaces, market¬
places, temples, schools, and private
house compounds: There were up to
19 water gates, 15 main land gates
with water landings, and numerous
other smaller gates, giving a total of
about 100 city gates. The city wall
with some 17 forts for cannons, each
guarding the main approaches of
water traffic, enclosed' an area of
about seven square kms (3 square
miles).
As far as present research reveals,
the number of canals within this area
is staggering. The canals were
straight and gridiron in plan. Many had
brick-paved streets alongside, and all
were lined with big trees, giving both
pedestrians and water traffic ample
protection from the tropical sun.
With so many canals and streets,
there must have been many bridges,
but only 29 are named and identified
by an old record. Half of this number
were very high brick arches to allow
for water traffic. One was constructed
of laterite to accomodate elephants.
There were three palaces. The
main Royal Palace was a complete
walled-in city in itself and was
subdivided into the king's private
residence, and an outer walled
compound containing various offices of
the civil service. Private houses were
simple constructions of wood, for all
the effort was concentrated on the
350 or more monasteries, many of
which had their own schools and
libraries.
The Chinese who had the special
privilege of living within the city walls,
had their Chinatown. This was the
most opulent secular quarter, with
shops and warehouses of brick and
stucco. Here a European of Greek
origin took up residence in an elegant
building, then entered the Siamese
civil service and became the First
Minister of the Crown in 1686.
Further along, behind the main forts
overlooking the dock for sea vessels,
he founded a college named after
himself, Constantin (Phaulkon) College.
The king had his own private dock
next to the Royal Palace where the
royal barges were kept. The city was
subdivided into administrative units
and quarters according to the different
activities and types of industry. The
centre was marked by a simple tower,
housing a drum from which the hours
were struck.

Thailand has been called the land of Buddhist ¡mages. One
of the most familiar sights in the ruins of Ayutya are the
¡mages of Buddha, though many, like the one shown here, are now
disfigured. This statue stands near the Wat Chao Phya-thai
(The Temple of the Supreme Patriarch), a former monastery for
monks of a sect devoted to meditation.
The population seems to have varied
a great deal. The success of a
military campaign could mean tens of
thousands of people being brought to
settle at Ayutya. The city and its
environs would then exceed the half
million mark. But when the Burmese
besieged the city in 1569 with an army
of over a million men and eventually
took it, only some 10,000 people were
left behind among the ruins. (Accord¬
ing to Europeans observers, in this
particular war the Burmese army was
over two million men strong, and after
its capture, Ayutya had a mere
4,000 inhabitants!)
Whatever the actual population in
normal times, there appears to have
been a great number of boats and a
huge "floating" population. For a
royal procession on water up to
30,000 attendants might be gathered
on some 3,000 barges, all fantastically
sculptured and gilded, and flanked
by 600,000 people on 20.000 boats
along both banks of the processional
waterway.
It was truly a water city, rightly
known to the Europeans of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as
the "Venice of the East". But it was
more than this, for people were
integrated into the water pattern.
The whole society seemed to float
and flow along the innumerable canals
and rivers without calculation and
struggle. This aquatic phenomenon
may be equated with the sense of
flexibility of the Siamese which
accounts for their political survival.
Certainly Siam had dealt astutely
with the various European powers
from the beginning of the seventeenth
century when its first embassy to
Europe was dispatched to Holland in
1609 as the result of the growing
Dutch trade and influence. Then
there were the famous exchanges of
embassies with Versailles in the 1680's,
,when an embassy was also sent to
the Vatican. According to a member
of the French embassy in Ayutya at
that time, there were 40 different
nationalities represented at the
Siamese court.
Foreigners were allowed to build
their own towns and religious estab¬
lishments around the city proper.
The Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese
towns occupied the best commercial

After its capture and
destruction, Ayutya fell
prey to plunderers and
vandals who despoiled
2nd defaced pagodas and
shrines in their search for
treasure. Traffic in works
of art led to further
ravages. Innumerable
heads, like this one

were removed from
statues of the Buddha.

AYUTYA (Continued)
A unique contribution to world civilization
positions, these being on the southern
approach of all sea shipping. The
king participated directly in the inter¬
national trade, maintained his own
bank for money loans, and kept a
private commercial fleet for shipping
between India and Japan.
Where now there is nothing but
dense undergrowth and rice fields,
there once flowed a rich life, full of
bustling activities and colour, all based
on water. The comings and goings
of embassies and merchants, the
ceremonial processions, the floating
markets, music, court dancing were the
essence of this remarkable aquatic
society. When the city was sacked
in 1767, its treasures were removed
and its archives burnt. Robbers
began a systematic uprooting of
pagodas to find buried treasures.
Then the jungle also moved in.
The Thai Government has recently
drawn up an ambitious scheme to
make Ayutya a national historical park.
The project was initiated by the Thai
Department of Town and Country
Planning which prepared a detailed
plan in conjunction with the Fine Arts

Department. Apart from its other
cultural activities, this department is
responsible for looking after all
historical monuments throughout the
country.
The Department of Town and
Country Planning is a newly-
established office which, in drawing
up development plans for towns and
cities, not only considers the modern
environment but also envisages the
incorporation of existing historical
landmarks into the overall design. It
so happens that most of the towns
throughout the kingdom are of an
historical nature, and until recently
still retained such historical landmarks
as city walls and fortifications. There¬
fore in drawing up development plans
for existing historical towns, the two
departments work closely together.
It was through the initiative of these
authorities that the Thai cabinet met
two years ago to discuss the problems
of preserving what was left of the
various city walls and fortifications,
and decided to impose a strict order
for the conservation of such national
monuments.
Ayutya, however, is different from
other old towns because of its special
significance to the country, having
been the capital city of Siam for four
centuries before the setting up of
Bangkok as capital in 1782. In
addition to the chaotic state of the
ruins as the result of past vandalism,
there are other problems such as
modern encroachment, and the future
expansion of a small town on the
eastern rim of the old city. Some
modern buildings have recently been
built scattered among the ruins,
often at the expense of the latter.
The project aims to make a clear
separation between the new town and
the historical area. An old canal
running north-south from the Palace
of the Front to the old Chinatown acts
as the demarcation between the
modern town on the east, and the
historical park on the west. A small
part of the former island city will thus
be given over to the development of
the modern town.
There are two reasons for this.
First, the area in question is already
partially urbanized, and mass eviction
would be undesirable. Secondly, it is
felt that the projected historical park
immediately to the west should not
be completely emptied of local people
because their services may be needed
to support the future tourist industry.
In its final form, the project involves
a rational allocation of urban and
industrial centres away from the
historical park, and a complete
restoration scheme for the various
ruins and canals.
The project is a 20-year programme
divided into three stages. The First
Five Year Plan gives priority to the
development of the modern town and
to the prevention of any further
modern encroachment into the his¬
torical area. It is assumed that at
this stage there will be only a limited
budget available for restoration work,
all priority being given to Thailand's
economic development. Even, so, a
definite move has been made towards
long term planning in this field.
The Second Five Year Plan involves
projects for both the modern town
and the historical park. As the jungle
is cleared away, some of the old
canals, brick-paved streets and bridges
will be brought to light, and various
palaces and temples uncovered and
restored. Re-allocation to the modern
zone of some of the modern
buildings among the ruins will also
begin.
The last stage, a ten-year pro¬
gramme, involves clearing away the
rest of the jungle and complete
restoration work. At this stage many
old canals will have been redug,
serving not only as tourist attractions,
but also as an essential part of a
storm drainage system. The older
eighth century city of Ayutya further
to the south-east awaits a future
research and restoration scheme. It
should be mentioned that scattered
throughout the country lie many walled
cities and archaeological sites still
covered by the jungle, and all awaiting
researchers and funds for restoration.
The Ayutya project will see many old
waterways revived and buildings and
fortifications properly restored. It
will soon be possible for a visitor to
meander once more along the
innumerable canals of the old city
among the palaces and pagodas of
the past. Thus, it is hoped, the
aquatic culture of Ayutya will make a
unique contribution to the civilizations
of the world.

### 16925: The Controversy on continental drift
THE CONTROVERSY
ON CONTINENTAL DRIFT
by Daniel Behrman
"... '.,"] N OT so long ago, it was fashionable to remark that we knew less about
the ocean floor than the face of the moon. Despite progress in
space exploration, this is no longer true. The Second International Océanographie
Congress, held in Moscow last June, heard reports of what can only be
described as a breakthrough no matter how much scientists hate the word in
man's knowledge of the ocean floor and, consequently, of the processes that
shape the earth (1).
Papers read at the congress by
marine geologists from a number of
nations and notably Britain, the United
States and the U.S.S.R. showed huge
progress not only in charting the ocean
floor but in our understanding of how
it works.
For it does "work." Our planet's
youngest rocks are on the bottom of
the sea and intense "manufacturing"
activity takes place along the mid-
ocean ridges that have now been found
in every ocean.
One of the most startling interpreta¬
tions of marine geophysical findings
heard at the congress was presented
by Dr. Bruce Heezen, Dr. Dragoslav
Ninkovich and Dr. Neil Opdyke of
Lamoñt Geological Observatory at Pali¬
sades, New York. They correlated
reversals in the earth's magnetic field
during the past three million years with
major evolutionary mutations in marine
life.
A sampling of 5,000 cores drilled out
of the sea bottom in all oceans to a
depth of ten metres of sediment sugg¬
ests, they stated, that the earth's mag¬
netic field has first disappeared and
then reversed at intervals between half
a million and a million years.
No magnetic field means no mag¬
netic shield. And this means intense
bombardment of the earth by cosmic
rays producing a disastrous effect on
life. "Some species are completely
killed off, other species are created,"
Dr. Heezen noted. "Of current interest
is the fact that the magnetic field is
now decreasing and if this drop con¬
tinues for 2,000 years, it will be zero.
I don't want to sound like an alarmist
but we may be next."
In the background of this research
can be found the impressive advances
recorded by marine geophysics in the
last seven years.
One such advance has been the
magnetic surveying of the deep ocean.
Off the coasts of California and Can¬
ada, a strange pattern of zebra
stripes running north and south was
recorded by magnetometers. A similar
pattern was found by Soviet re¬
searchers in the Arctic.
One theory of their' origin is that
new rock is polarized magnetically as
it spews out of the median crack in
mid-ocean ridges and is laid down on
the sea floor. When it cools, this
magnetism is frozen and remains con¬
stant as "paleomagnetism" despite
later reversals in the magnetic field.
The stripe is formed when new rock
appears after a reversal.
In the research described by
Dr. Heezen, pencil-sized samples of
deep-sea sediment cores were placed
in magnetometers. The results imply
that our magnetic north has been
north only for the past 700,000 years;
before that it was reversed for a time,
so that a compass would have pointed
south. These reversals, he explained,
could be caused by disturbances with¬

(1) The Congress, organized by the
U.S.S.R. government and the Soviet Aca¬
demy of Sciences, under the auspices of
Unesco, enabled over 1,700 oceanographers
from 57 countries to take stock of progress
in the study of the sea since the First
International Océanographie Congress was
held seven years ago in New York. Under
the general theme of "Ocean Research for
the Benefit of Mankind," the Moscow
congress covered four major fields of
study: ocean and atmosphere, ocean and
life, marine geology and oceanography of
the Antarctic and the Indian Ocean (special
studies of the findings of the 25-nation
Indian Ocean Expedition1959-1965).

years ago. Study of the cores shows,
Dr. Heezen stated, that the earth's
magnetic field did not simply change
direction but disappeared for a period
as long as 10,000 years.
During this period of full exposure
to cosmic rays, drastic changes occur¬
red. Examination of fossil organisms
in cores showed, for example, that
one microscopic species of radiolaria
had no spines before magnetic reversal
but sprouted them afterwards.
The magnetic zebra-striping, already
detected on two per cent of the earth's
surface, is not all that marine geolo¬
gists have found on the ocean floor.
Their main achievements were reported
to the congress in a masterly review
by Sir Edward Bullard, head of the
department of geodesy and geophysics
at Cambridge University.
Next in importance, he ranked the
discovery of continental blocks in the
middle of the ocean that is, islands
formed of old granite rather than the
young basalts of the ocean floor. The
Seychelles group, for example, is "a
continent in everything but size" geo¬
logically speaking, and he suspected
other oceanic areas as being of conti¬
nental origin as well. Continental
rocks are much less magnetic than
oceanic rocks, thereby giving away
their origin.
Work has also been done on the
structural transition of the earth from
the continent to the ocean. Magnetic
surveys show that the old pre-Tertiary
folding of Western Europe's mountains
can be traced out across the continen¬
tal shelf. . . where it suddenly ends.
The folding of younger ranges like the
western Andes, however, has been fol¬
lowed magnetically all the way into the
ocean basin.
Sir Edward then touched on the
theory of continental drift seen in
certain quarters as confirmed by the
intense activity of the mid-ocean
ridges. The theory was discussed in
much greater detail by Dr. Robert S.
Dietz, of the Environmental Science
Service Administration in Washington,
who regaled congress participants with
slides showing how continents might
once have fitted.
The most classic example of such
a fit is what Dr. Dietz called "the knee
of South America into the groin of
Africa." Working with computers, he
has been able to fit India against
Australia, Magadascar against India
and Australia against Antarctica. A
few missing pieces each the size of
Texas are needed to complete this
picture, and Dr. Dietz thinks they are
lying on the floor of the Indian Ocean.
His studies have led him to discard
the idea of a single, primordial world
continent, known as Pangaea, in favour
of two super-continents each measur¬
ing 32 million squares miles Laurasia
in the Northen Hemisphere and Gond-
wana in the Southern.
Dr. Dietz and other proponents of
the drift theory believe that the pro¬
cess began 150 million years ago, went
on energetically for 50 million years
and has reappeared less markedly
in the past 20 million years. On the
basis of movement observed along the
San Andreas Fault in California, he
estimates the present rate of drift at
from 1 to 5 cm (è to 2 in.) a year.
However, the big question among
geophysicists at the congress was not
whither but whether we are drifting.
Prof. V. V. Beloussov, of the Institute
of Geophysics of the U.S.S.R. Aca¬
demy of Sciences, is still far from
convinced (see the Unesco Courier,
Oct. 1963).
At the congress, he marshalled a
number of impressive arguments. In
particular, he maintained that processes
affecting the earth's crust are rooted
deep in its mantle, as much as 700
to 1,000 kms (430 to 620 miles) down.
This leads him to believe that the crust
cannot move over the mantle and also
that movement of a layer of several
hundred kilometres of crust and mantle
is impossible for mechanical and other
reasons.
Continental drift is one of those geo-

SCIENTIFIC tangles plaguing the
world's oceanographers may finally
be unravelled by new tools now being put at the
disposal of researchers (see photo story on follow¬
ing pages). Previews of many of these devices
were offered recently at the Second Inter¬
national Océanographie Congress in Moscow.

logical theories, that have, as Sir
Edward Bullard remarked in his lecture,
"the great merit of suggesting nu¬
merous experiments and observations
to verify or refute them."
One way to verify or refute conti¬
nental drift is to drill a hole in the
earth's mantle under the ocean floor
to see if it consists only of new rocks
which would indicate that the conti¬
nents have moved apart in the past
100 million years.
This is the purpose of the Mohole
project designed by the United States
to probe through the Mohorovicic dis¬
continuity layer between the crust and
the mantle. At the congress, Dr. Henry
Menard, of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in the United States
described the phases of the project.
Its floating platform is expected to be
ready in two years when it will be
taken to a point 1,000 kms (620 miles)
west of Southern California to drill
about 350 metres (1,200 ft.) into the
sea bottom at a depth of four kms
(2è miles).
If this experiment succeeds, the next
point of research will be 500 kms (310
miles) northeast of Oahu in the Ha¬
waiian Islands where an attempt will
be made to drill at a depth of 4.5 kms
(about 3 miles) through another
4.5 kilometres of the sea floor down to
the mantle. It is planned to drill ten
holes in the next twenty years.
Prof. Beloussov also reported on a
Soviet project now under considera¬
tion to drill down seven kms (about
four miles) this time on land in the
Kola Peninsula of northern Russia
where there is a possibility of reaching
the basaltic layer of the earth's crust.
"These two projects form an en¬
semble," Prof. Beloussov commented.
Drilling holes, therefore, is the next
step in geophysical exploration of the
ocean bottom but it will have to await
the proper tools. Once they are ready,
they will spur marine geology in the
future as much as the development of
"sparkers" and "air guns" as sound
sources replacing explosives in seismic
refraction work has done in the recent
past.
Few sciences are evolving as fast as
oceanography, and océanographie re¬
search, while supplying answers to
many vital problems, is also opening
up new fields of Investigation. Com¬
menting on the results of the Moscow
congress, a Canadian scientist, Dr.
Robert W. Stewart, of the University
of British Columbia, observed: "The
area of our known ignorance has been
greatly extended."
Dr. Stewart is wrestling with one
of the trickiest problems facing ocean
ographers the interaction between
the ocean and the atmosphere, and
the consequent effects of the sea on
the weather.
Recent research has brought out
that half a day of 60-knot winds affects
the ocean more than a month of
15-knot winds, setting up momentum
that remains in the sea as much as
a year. Dr. Stewart felt that further
investigations should concentrate on
the effects of very local storms.
An example of such air-sea inter¬
action on a global scale was report¬
ed to the congress by Prof. Jakob
Bjerknes, of the University of Cali¬
fornia, who presented an apparent
paradox: when surface waters are
warm in the equatorial Pacific, Europe
has a cold winter.
Prof. Bjerknes turned to the period
from 1955 to 1958 when this phenom¬
enon appeared. It began when the
prevailing easterlies along the equator
weakened to the point where they
no longer drove currents hard enough
to produce normal upwelllng of cold
water from the depths. The Pacific's
"equatorial heat source" of warm
water became much greater.
This was a case not of winds driv¬
ing the ocean but of the ocean driving 1 K
the winds. "When heat is high in **

rica to the mid-Pacific, the Northern

scientists, twenty-two laboratories, a helicopter
and a meteorological rocket launcher.
The other is the Silas Bent, a 2,364-ton ship
operated by the United States Naval Océano¬
graphie Office, and probably the most automated
océanographie vessel now in operation. While
under way, she can simultaneously measure depth,
magnetic intensity, gravity, sea surface tempera¬
ture and the structure of the bottom. On station,
she uses a "sensor package", continuously mea¬
suring depth, temperature, salinity, sound velocity
and light as far down as 6.100 metres (20,000 feet).
To handle this Gulf Stream of data, she is
equipped with a "central data recording sub¬
system" where information is immediately pro¬
cessed by an all-purpose digital computer.
Computers like the ones aboard the Silas Bent
and the Akademik Kurchatov can mean the
difference between survey and research at sea.
Immediate processing of data enables a ship's
chief scientist to change his research programme
so as to explore an interesting phenomenon
instead of waiting months to learn of its existence.
And computers not only record more information
but make it more accessible in international banks
of océanographie data.
The congress was given a review of the recent
past which has seen such developments as FLIP,
an American vessel 108 metres (355 feet) "long"
that flips 90 degrees to become the most stable
platform ever used at sea (see page 18) and a
floating tower used by Soviet oceanographers
in the Caspian Sea to make wave measurements.
Some of the least spectacular instruments have
proved the most valuable. One is the "Swallow
Float", named after the British oceanographer who
designed it. This is simply a neutrally-buoyant
float which can be set to drift at a given depth
and follow a current, and which reveals its posi¬
tion by "pings". Another huge advance is repre¬
sented by instruments measuring the conductivity
and. therefore, the salinity of the sea, thus elimin¬
ating much tedious chemical analysis of water
samples.

Submersibles have also appeared. Several
of them were described, including the Aluminaut
designed to work nearly 5,000 metres down with
six people aboard, the smaller Alvin which has
already gone down to 2,000 metres (6,500 feet)
and the Deep Star designed in France. Telenaut,

from above and data from below.
These new undersea vehicles have already

only 15 minutes. Ninety metres (300 ft.) of the
vessel now extend into the ocean, exerting a
strong stabilizing influence. In the working

m* OR many centuries, the
planets of the solar system
have been objects of study by astron¬
omers. Before the invention of the
telescope, these studies were restrict¬
ed to an attempt to understand and
predict their motion.
Very precise observations in the late
sixteenth century led to the conclusion
that the planets moved in orbits around
the sun, and from this, the modern
concept of the solar system was
established.
Telescopes and accurate clocks
allowed even more precise observa¬
tions, and outer planets, Neptune and
Pluto, were discovered.
Telescopes also provided astron¬
omers with their first evidence of the
sizes and surface appearances of the
planets, and of the existence of their
moons.
Then came the space programme,
and the possibility of performing exper¬
iments on, or at least near to, other
planets. Not only have active flight
programmes of planetary investigation
been established by the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration,
but also ground-based observations
have been greatly strengthened.
Scientists from many disciplines in¬
cluding biology, geology, physics and
chemistry, have found opportunities to
conduct research in this new field of
planetology.
Since World War II, many devices
other than rockets have extended
man's capability for planetary research.
For example, telescopic observations
have been improved by the use of bet¬
ter photographic film, including colour
film, and by various electronic instru-

### 17602: New ways to explore the planets
EXPLORING THE PLANETS (Continued)
Venus turns slowly counterclockwise
22
ments. Sensitive infra-red detectors
have become available. Spectroscopy
has taken advantage of improved tech¬
nology. Radio telescopes have be¬
come sensitive enough to make plane¬
tary measurements.
Within the past few years still
greater steps have been taken. Tele¬
scopes have been lifted above the
atmosphere with balloons. Radar
signals have been reflected from the
planets. Spacecraft have been sent
to the vicinity of Venus and Mars.
Soon an astronomical observatory will
be orbiting the earth. Spacecraft will
be sent to orbit nearby planets, and
capsules from them will land on the
surface.
The first radar echo observed from
any heavenly body was in January
1946, when a group of U.S. Army
Signal Corps engineers succeeded in
detecting a signal reflected from the
moon. By 1961, echoes had been de¬
tected from the planet Venus. Consid¬
ering that the distance to Venus is
more than 100 times as great as that
to the moon, this is an indication of
the remarkable improvement in radar
technology during this period of 15
years.
But it is not sufficient merely to de¬
tect an echo from a planet. Useful
scientific information requires measure¬
ment of the properties of the echo.
The time at which the echo occurs
gives the range to the target. Echo
power provides information on the
scattering properties of the target. The
echo's radio frequency shift measures
the relative velocity of target and
receiver. Frequency dispersion meas¬
ures the rotation of the target, rela¬
tive to a line perpendicular to the di¬
rection of the receiver. Results
obtained by these methods have prov¬
ed that radar is an exceedingly
valuable new tool for planetary explor¬
ation.
The distance from earth to the planet
Venus has been measured to an accu¬
racy of about 25 kilometres (15 miles).
These data supplement astronomical
observations in a useful way. Astro¬
nomical data consist of angle measu¬
rements versus time. By adding pre¬
cise range to the astronomical data,
the geometry and motions of the plan¬
ets can be calculated to a very much
greater precision than formerly.
Venus is a particularly interesting
case because astronomical observa¬
tions had not been able to establish
any definite rotation rate since no vis
ible fixed surface features were
available. Spectroscopic observations
indicated a very slow rotation but the
data contained large uncertainties. The
radar data showed unequivocally that
Venus does indeed rotate slowly coun¬
terclockwise with a rotation period of
about 250 days.
Radar observations of Mercury and
Mars have also yielded useful infor¬
mation. Jupiter has been detected by
radar both at the U.S. Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and by a U.S.S.R. group.
Because of the great distance, and
the large frequency dispersion due to
rotation of the planet, Jupiter turns out
to be a very difficult target.
Planetary radar offers many oppor¬
tunities for extended research activi¬
ties. Systems are becoming more
sensitive as transmitter power and
antenna diameters increase while re¬
ceiver temperatures go lower. Other
than the moon, Venus will continue
to be the most attractive target. Con¬
tinuing study will provide a radar map
of the planet.
Within the past five years the possi¬
bility of sending instruments to the
planets has advanced from speculation
to reality. The United States has suc¬
cessfully sent two spacecraft to other
planets: Mariner II to Venus and Mar¬
iner IV to Mars. The Soviet Union
sent a number of probes towards
Venus, and after a three-month flight,
the Soviet Venera 3 probe reached
the surface of the planet on March I,
1966.
These flights clearly open up a whole
new era in planetology.
As a practical matter, the energy
available from a booster rocket is
limited and, therefore, on most mis¬
sions the spacecraft will fly to another
planet along an orbit which requires
minimum energy. To come near the
target planet, it will be necessary to
launch at a specified time when the
earth and the planet are In the correct
relative positions.
This means that launch, and arrival
at the planet, occur at times determin¬
ed by solar-system geometry. If, there¬
fore, an experiment requires observa¬
tions at some particular season on
Mars, a flight will be possible only at
certain launch periods.
Because the orbits of the planets
are on different planes, the energy re¬
quired to send a spacecraft to another
planet varies with the launch date. For
example, In the case of Mars the lowest
minimum energy orbit will occur in
1969 and the highest in 1973. The
cycle repeats in a 15-year period. The
1969 launch requires that the space¬
craft leave the earth's gravitational
field with a velocity of 2.8 kms.
(1.7 miles) per second. In 1973, this
will rise to 4.0 kms (2.5 miles) a sec¬
ond. The size of spacecraft which
can be launched with a given booster
will vary accordingly.
Data sent back to earth from space¬
craft in the vicinity of a planet must
travel vast distances. Hence, the com¬
munication system must be designed so
that the maximum data rate is kept as
low as possible. The instrumentation
selected for the spacecraft must there¬
fore be designed to satisfy the low data
requirement, or else must provide a
data storage system able to collect
data over a short period of time and
send it over the communication link
sufficiently slowly to meet the rate
specification.
Instruments designed to fly on a
spacecraft must, of course, operate
in the spacecraft environment. This
environment can be divided into three

CLOSE-UP
OF MARS
In the 350 years since
the telescope was in¬
vented, probably more
tune has been devoted
fo viewing and photo¬
graphing Mars than to
any other planet Its
varied colouring and
polar caps, which appear
to change with the
seasons, and its straight-
line markings suggestive
of a rectangular net¬
work of canals have
given rise to all lands
of theories. Top left, this
view of Mars is repre¬
sentative of the best
that can be made
with the aid of earth-
bound telescopes. Hence¬
forth, observations ob¬
tained through space
probes are likely to
clear up many of the
mysteries of Mars. On
July 14, 1965, the U.S.
spacecraft Mariner IV,
after a 228-day trip came
within some 9,650 kms.
(6,000 miles) of Mars and
took a series of photos
of the planet. Right, on
one of these photos a

categories: launch, free-fall in the vacu¬
um of space, and landing on another
planet or re-entry and landing on the
earth. Each category has its prob¬
lems.
The launch is characterized primar¬
ily by severe vibration and accelera¬
tion. Coasting in space presents prob¬
lems due to the long exposure to a
vacuum. The landing or re-entry period
presents further vibration and accel¬
eration problems, possibly complicat¬
ed by the gaseous constituents of a
planetary atmosphere.
While instruments have been built
to operate properly in each of these
environments, it is not an easy task.
The worst environment is usually the
vibration at launch. But the effects of
a vacuum should not be minimized.
These may include evaporation of in¬
strument materials; problems of lubri¬
cation of bearing surfaces; and temp¬
erature problems caused by the dis¬
appearance of convective cooling.
Electrical problems may arise due
to the passage through the atmosphere
from sea level pressure to the vacuum
of space, or from leakage of sealed
compartments.
In addition to the environmental con¬
straints, the instrument designer must
live with weight, volume and power
consumption specifications. On most
spacecraft to date, these constraints
have been quite stringent. However,
looking into the future when larger
boost vehicles become available, they
should be relaxed.
A spacecraft designed to land in¬
struments on another planet introduces
still another constraint, namely the re¬
quirement for biological sterilization.
One of the very interesting experiments
which will be conducted on the surface
of Mars is the search for life. There¬
fore, all space flight apparatus which
has any probability of landing on Mars
must be sterile to insure that life forms
from earth will not be transported to
the planet.
The methods by which a large space¬
craft can be made completely sterile,
and maintained in that condition through
the launching, are currently being deve¬
loped. One possibility is a require¬
ment that the complete spacecraft be

sterilized by heating above the boiling
point for an extended period of time.
In this case, of course, instruments
would have to be constructed out of
materials and components which could
stand such treatment.
Finally, there is the question of
reliability on the long journey through
space. Some instruments are required
to work continuously for many months.
Others are needed only in the vicinity
of the planet. These must turn on
reliably, with the correct calibrations,
after the long exposure to space vacu¬
um and radiations. All equipment
aboard the spacecraft must operate
perfectly the first and only time it is
given a completely realistic test. Once
the launch button has been pushed
there is no opportunity to make an
adjustment or to replace a component.

on July 14, 1965, illustrates the scien¬
tific instruments aboard a planetary
spacecraft.

mounted on a platform, was designed

the planet and pointed the camera in
the proper direction. The platform
remained fixed while the motion of
the spacecraft across the planet allow¬
ed the camera to take a series of
photographs of the surface. These
were stored on a magnetic tape and
later played back to earth. The tele¬
vision system weighed 5 kilogrammes
(11 pounds) and required 8 watts of
power.
Data from these instruments, and
from 90 others measuring spacecraft
performance, were collected in a data
automation system, processed into
"digital" form, and routed to the trans¬
mitter in the correct sequence. This
data automation system contained
about 11,000 components. It weighed
5.4 kilogrammes (12 pounds) and re¬
quired 6.5 watts of power.
The large amount of data received
from Mariner was processed at the
Space Flight Operation Facility in Pasa¬
dena, California. Within five minutes
of receipt of the telemetry signal, both
scientific and engineering data were
available for initial evaluation.
During the spacecraft's seven-month
journey to Mars, weekly summary re
ports and tapes were made available
to each experimenter at the laboratory.
The final data are being collected Into
a master data library. There, the Mar¬
iner-transmitted data, organized into
digital form, are available for computer
processing by the experimenters.
Mariner IV represents the most so¬
phisticated planetary spacecraft the
U.S. has yet launched. It performed
very well, but its capability was limited
by the 258-kilogramme (525-pound)
total weight constraint. The next gen¬
eration of spacecraft, the Voyager
series, will weigh more than ten times
as much and will be capable of mis¬
sions considerably more extensive.
Present plans call for both orbiting
and landing versions of Voyager, start¬
ing in 1971, for Mars exploration.
Later, Voyager will be used for a Venus
mission and possibly for others. The
detailed plans for the first Voyager are
not yet complete. Many experiments
have been proposed and are now under,
consideration. )
Exploration of the solar system has
indeed entered a new era. The two
foregoing examples planetary radar
experiments from the earth, and space*
craft experiments at other planets
offer spectacular opportunities for in¬
vestigating our neighbouring planets.
Radar experiments have shown that
solar system geometrical relationship
can be determined with extreme accur¬
acy, and that extensive new informa¬
tion on planetary surfaces can be ob¬
tained to supplement that from obser¬
vation with visible or infra-red light.
Unmanned spacecraft travelling to
the planets have demonstrated that
complex experiments can be operated
successfully at planetary distances,
and that these craft can obtain much
important information and permit close-
up observations of the planets with
television and other instruments.
Eventually such craft may convey
data from instruments landed on a
planet. Soft landings on the moon
have already been achieved by the
Soviet Union with Lunik 9 and by the
United States with Surveyor I.
Although a soft planetary landing
has not yet been demonstrated, the
results of Mariner and the work of
Surveyor I give us every confidence
that Voyager will indeed succeed in
making surface observations of Mars.

Unesco collection
of world literature
On these pages we present two outstanding writers who deserve to be
better known beyond their national frontiers than they are. The first
is the Japanese novelist, Natsume Soseki, whose books have attained
phenomenal popularity in Japan in the 50 years since his death. The
second is the epic poet, Shota Rustaveli, author of the greatest and
most popular work of Georgian literature. Both writers have been
published in the Unesco Collection of Representative Works. The
Collection, sponsored by Unesco in collaboration with commercial
publishing houses, has made it possible for new audiences to read
masterpieces of world literature hitherto beyond the reach of all but
readers of the original texts. Over 200 volumes have been published
to date in various languages, and each year the Collection is enriched
by new translations from Persian, Arabic, Chinese, Indian, Japanese,
Latin American and African literature (translations of more than
100 works are now in preparation). In a two-way flow of literature,
classics and contemporary works are translated into French, English,
German, Spanish and Italian, and great works ofEuropean literature are
translated into the languages of the Orient.

### 18425: Soseki, the most popular writer in Japan
SOSEKI the most popular
writer in Japan
N
Soseki Natsume (1867-1916). His immense
scholarship gave him a balanced view of
Western literature and the Oriental classics.
ATSUME KINNOSUKE,
who Is generally known by
his pen-name, "Soseki," is the most
widely read and popular writer in
Japan. Soseki was born in 1867, a
year before the Meiji restoration, and
died in 1916 at the age of 49.
A Soseki exhibition was held last
January at a major Tokyo department
store on the occasion of the 100th an¬
niversary of Soseki's birth (Japanese
custom counts the year of birth twice).
More than 40,000 persons attended,
establishing a new record for exhibi¬
tions for the department store.
The popularity of Soseki's novels
today is considered quite phenomenal
even for Japan. One leading Japanese
publisher, Iwanami Shoten, began pub¬
lishing a complete collection of So¬
seki's works in December 1965, and
over 100,000 persons subscribed for
the series of 16 volumes, each priced
at 1,200 yen (over $3.00) and contain¬
ing 700 pages.
This year, with the publication of the
seventh complete set of Soseki's
works, the total number of his volumes
has reached the impressive figure of
6,450,000, an unprecedented event in
r .
Japanese publishing for a writer dead
50 years.
Soseki's books appeal to a broad
cross-section of Japan's population
housewives, factory employees, white-
collar workers, college students and
even secondary and primary school
children. A survey conducted in 1964
in five leading Tokyo secondary
schools revealed that Soseki was the
most popular author read by young
people today. Paperback editions of
his books now sell as fast as those
of the biggest Japanese best-sellers.
Soseki started out as a secondary
school teacher of English, and then
went on to teach at college. He
studied in England for several years,
and on his return to Japan he was
appointed lecturer in English literature
at the Tokyo Imperial University.
In 1906, at the age of 39, Soseki
wrote his first novel, "I Am a Cat",
a humorous, satirical commentary on
modern society. The novel was an
immediate success and it enabled
Soseki to resign his university post
and to devote himself to a literary
career. In the eleven brief years
before his death, Soseki wrote

THE THREE-CORNERED WORLD

OING up a mountain track, I fell to thinking.
	._ Approach everything rationally, and you become harsh.
Pole along in the stream of emotions, and you will be swept away by the
current. Give free to your desires, and you become uncomfortably
confined. It is not a very agreeable place to live, this world of ours.
When the unpleasantness increases, you want to draw yourself up to
some place where life is easier. It is just at the point when you first
realize that life will be no more agreeable no matter what heights you
may attain, that a poem may be given birth, or a picture created...
There is no escape from this world. If, therefore, you find life hard,
there is nothing to be done but settle yourself as comfortably as you can
during the unpleasant times, although you may only succeed in this for
short periods, and thus make life's brief span bearable. It is here that
the vocation of the artist comes into being, and here that the painter
receives his divine commission. Thank heaven for all those who in
devious ways by their art, bring tranquillity to the world, and enrich men's
hearts.
Strip off from the world all those cares and worries which make it an
unpleasant place in which to live, and picture before you instead a world
of graciousness. You now have music, a painting, or poetry, or sculpture.
I would go farther, and say that it is not even necessary to make this
vision a reality. Merely conjure up the image before your eyes, and
poetry will burst into life and songs pour forth. Before even committing
your thoughts to paper, you will feel the crystal tinkling, as of a tiny
bell well up within you; and the whole range of colours will of their own
accord, and in all their brilliance, imprint themselves on your mind's
eye, though your canvas stands on its easel, as yet untouched by the
brush. It is enough that you are able to take this view of life, and see
this decadent, sullied and vulgar world purified and beautiful in the camera
of your innermost soul.
Even the poet whose thoughts have never found expression in a single
verse, or the painter who possesses no colours, and has never painted
so much as a single square foot of canvas, can obtain salvation, and
be delivered from earthly desires and passions. They can enter at will
a world of undefiled purity, and throwing off the yoke of avarice and
self interest, are able to build up a peerless and unequalled universe.
Thus in all this, they are happier than the rich and famous ; than any
lord or prince that ever lived ; happier indeed than all those on whom
this vulgar world lavishes her affections.
After twenty years of life I realized that this is a world worth living
in. At twenty five I saw that, just as light and darkness are but opposite
sides of the same thing, so wherever the sunlight falls it must of necessity
cast a shadow. Today, at thirty my thoughts are these : In the depths
of joy dwells sorrow, and the greater the happiness the greater the
pain. Try to tear joy and sorrow apart, and you lose your hold on life.
Try to cast them to one side, and the world crumbles...
...It was just as my meandering thoughts reached this point, that my
right foot came down suddenly on the edge of a loose angular rock,
and I slipped. To compensate for my left foot, which I had hastily shot
out in an effort to keep my balance, the rest of me droppedl Fortunately
I came down on to a boulder about three feet across, and all that
happened was that my colour-box, which I had been carrying slung
from my shoulder, jerked forward from under my arm. Luckily no damage
was done.
As I rose and looked around me, I noticed away off to the left of the
track a towering peak shaped like an inverted bucket. It was completely
covered from base to summit with dark-green foliage, but whether
cryptomeria or cypress I was unable to tell.

numerous books, since acknowledged
as literary masterpieces.
As a writer, Soseki sought to har¬
monize the ideas of the Occident
and the traditions of Japanese litera¬
ture, and to express simply and clearly,
the innermost human hopes and de¬
sires. His work was also influenced
by the spirit of social responsibility
that characterized his contemporaries
of the Meiji era.
One reason why the works of
Soseki are so popular is that the maj¬
ority of his novels are woven around
an ordinary family and household, with
which readers can readily identify
themselves.
Soseki's most popular novel Is
probably Botchan, his second book,
which describes the life of teachers
in a provincial secondary school. This
novel, based on Soseki's own
experiences as a secondary school
teacher, has sold more than 2,140,000
copies since 1945 in paperbound
pocket editions alone.
Soseki's extensive study of English
literature added to his knowledge of
Oriental classics gave him a breadth

of background unique among his
contemporaries, and in his last years
this enabled him to write outstanding
works such as Sorekara, Kokoro,
Mon, Michikusa and Meian. These
novels the fruit of an intensive
pursuit of the writer's "self are very
different from Soseki's earlier works,
which were masterpieces of wit and
humour.
In his later years, Soseki frequently
wrote on the theme of conflict in
family life, though each time he
analyzed the theme from a different
standpoint. Moreover, since these
later novels are more powerful and
probe more deeply into the psychology
of the characters, they have a greater
subtlety and refinement than the
author's earlier writing. Soseki delves
within the minds of his characters and
through them strives to reveal the
nature of man's inner life.
The chief characters in the majority
of Soseki's novels are men, and
neither they nor even his women
characters are depicted with the
wealth of detail found in works by
authors of the school of naturalism.
On the contrary, many of the women
are portrayed as intensely self-
centered beings, a further affirmation
of the taste for introspection displayed
by Soseki an antinaturalistic writer
par excellence.
Soseki's last work, Meian appeared
as a newspaper serial, 188 instalments
of which were published before the
author's death. In Meian, Soseki
pursued to the end his efforts to
elucidate the mysteries of "self.
Soseki was a man of many talents,
well versed in Japanese, Chinese and
Western literature, and before be¬
coming an author he had already
established his reputation as a poet.
Under the pen name of "Gudabutsu",
he wrote a great many Japanese Haiku
poems in which he gives profound
expression to such great concepts of
Zen philosophy as "selflessness" and
"quietude".
Soseki also excelled at calligraphy
and painting and composed poems in
Chinese. When he first took up calli¬
graphy, he was greatly influenced by
the work of the Zen priest, Ryokan
(1757-1831), but later changed his
style completely, and created his own
highly original calligraphic forms.
In art, Soseki apparently preferred
Japanese painting to Western-style
oils. He started painting in water-
colour around 1904, but it was only
after 1913 that he concentrated his
efforts in this field, after he became
acquainted with the painter Seifu
Tsuda.
Few writers today in Japan possess
talent comparable with that of Soseki.
Still fewer writers have left as many
excellent paintings as those from
Soseki's brush.
Following is a list of works by Soseki
translated Into English: Kokoro, translated

No true portrait exists of the Georgian poet,
Shota Rustavel!, the 12th-century author of
"The Knight In the Tiger's Skin". But Rustaveli's
work has inspired numerous painters and
illustrators. Right, Rustaveli depicted by the
Georgian painter, Niko Pirosmanashvili, or
Pirosmani as he is called (1860-1917). A
gifted artist with an original style, Pirosmani often
portrayed the history and legends of his
country (see the Unesco Courier, Oct. 1962).

### 18915: Rustaveli and 'The Knight in the tiger's skin'
RUSTAVELI AND
THE KNIGHT
IN THE
TIGER'S SKIN' *££
he Knight in the Tiger's
Skin, a long epic poem
written in the late twelfth century,
is the greatest and most popular work
of Georgian literature. But more than
this, it is a story of the triumph of
true love which deserves a high place
in the annals of world literature, and,
as we shall see, it has several features
which make it especially attractive to
the modern reader.
The author, Shota Rustaveli, lived
800 years ago, in the "Golden Age"
of the Georgian people, when the
State of Georgia stretched from the
Caspian to the Black Sea and from
the Caucasus Mountains to the
headwaters of the Euphrates. Rusta¬
veli was a feudal aristocrat about
whom remarkably little is known;
contemporary chronicles, although
they describe the life and work of
even minor figures of the epoch,
hardly mention his name. The Knight
in the Tiger's Skin (known in some
English translations as "The Man of
the Panther Skin") is his only surviving
work. Indeed, the principal source
of historical and literary facts about
him is the Prologue to the poem
itself.
The plot of the poem is complex
and involved, but Rustaveli unfolds
it with all the mastery of a great poet,
and to this day the story holds the
reader enthralled.
In his old age King Rostevan of
Arabia, being without a male heir,
vests the sovereignty of the realm
in his only daughter, the beautiful

and intelligent Tinatin, who is in love
with Avtandil, a valiant knight. During
a hunt arranged to celebrate the coro¬
nation, Rostevan and Avtandil come
upon a mysterious knight clad in a
tiger's skin, sitting mournfully by a
stream and weeping tears mingled
with blood. After they have tried
in vain to speak with him, he
disappears in the twinkling of an eye.
This event upsets and depresses
the old king, and Tinatin sends
Avtandil to search for the strange
knight. After three years of arduous
wanderings, Avtandil succeeds in
finding him, and the knight, whose
name is Tariel, tells his sad story.
He is the son of one of the seven
kings of India; this king decides
before his death to do homage- to
Parsadan, who rules over the other'six
kingdoms. Tariel is brought up at
Parsadan's court as his heir, and one
day he falls passionately in love with
Parsadan's daughter, Nestan-Darejan.
But Parsadan threatens to marry her
to a foreign prince and to proclaim
him heir to the throne. At the
princess's instigation, Tariel kills his
rival. As a result, the princess is
severely punished and exiled, and
now, after a long search, Tariel has
lost all hope of finding her and has
been living in the forest with the
wild beasts.
Avtandil encourages him and pro¬
mises him his help, and after many
adventures, he discovers that Nestan-
Darejan is held captive in a remote
fortress. With the help of a third
knight, he and Tariel attack the
fortress and free the princess. Thus
honour and true love triumph: the
Knight in the Tiger's Skin marries
Nestan-Darejan, and Avtandil returns
to Tinatin. Peacefully and humanely
they rule their countries and happy
peoples.

Two things about this story strike
the reader straightaway: the important
part played by women, and the
"modern" attitude to romantic love.
The crux of the plot is King Parsadan's
decision to arrange a political marriage
for his daughter and her determination
to marry only the man she loves.
By medieval standards. King Parsa¬
dan's action was absolutely reasonable
and correct. It was unheard of at
that time for mutual attraction to
take precedence, as a foundation for
marriage, over all other considerations.
Rustaveli's great originality and
genius is most clearly demonstrated
in the fact that he made this very
human situation the pivot of his whole
work.
However, to explain the importance
and the brilliant characterization
of the women in The Knight of the
Tiger's Skin, we must refer to the
social and political conditions in
twelfth century Georgia.
The secluded way of life for women
was thoroughly alien to the Georgian
people. The conversion of the
Georgians to Christianity was
attributed to a woman, Saint Nino
of Cappadociá. (Incidentally, whereas
early Christianity in the West took
the form of asceticism and the denial
of all earthly pleasures, in Georgia
it was closely connected with the
concept of fertility and life. This has
a greater significance than might" be
supposed at first glance, and may
possibly account for the extensive
secular literature which appeared in
Georgian in the Middle Ages side
by side with religious works).
Early ecclesiastical writings had
already pointed out that men and
women were one and equal In the
eyes of the Almighty, and Nicho¬
las Gulaberisdze, an ecclesiastical

### 18915: Rustaveli and 'The Knight in the tiger's skin'
writer who was a contemporary of
Rustaveli's, composed a special
treatise In defence and In praise of
woman's honour and dignity. Finally,
and perhaps most important, Rustaveli
himself witnessed the splendid flower¬
ing of Georgia as a state under
the reign of a woman, Queen Tamar
(1184-1213), whom he praises in the
Prologue to his poem.
This was indeed a culture re¬
markable for its richness and diversity.
There were two academies which
offered a truly universal education.
Many major works on religion, history
and philosophy were written, and a
considerable number of foreign writ¬
ings were translated. Still greater
development was achieved In archi¬
tecture, painting and music (the
written music of the period has been
preserved). If the "Golden Age"
reached Its culmination under
Queen Tamar, it dawned during
the rule of her ancestor, King David
the Builder (1089-1125): a man of
culture who was accustomed to take
his library with him when he went
to war, and a pious Christian who
wrote psalms of a rare beauty. He
showed unusual religious tolerance
for his time, and took pleasure in
disputing with Muslim scholars on the
finer points of the tenets of Islam.
But I digress from the poem itself.
The language It was written in is not
so very different from modern Geor¬
gian no more different, let us say,
than the language of Shakespeare is
from modern English. The poem
consists of over 1,600 quatrains, the
lines of each quatrain rhyming with
each other, thus:
Amartis perad shetsvalabroli tsremlisa
[banaman.
Didkhan itiris kmaman da man kalman
[shaosanaman.
Shekhspa, sheigo adjari, tskhenitsa
[sheikvana man,
Dadumdis, tsremlin mokhkvetna shav-
[man gishrisa danaman.
(Linguists may be puzzled at not
finding the slightest similarity with
any other language. This is not
surprising: the origins of the language.
like those of the Georgian people,
are shrouded in mystery. The only
European language which bears any
similarity at all to Georgian is Basque
and even its relationship has yet
to be proved).
Suffice to say that the euphonic
structure of the poem Is brilliant, so
much so that Georgian readers are
often so carried away by the musical
sound and linguistic magic of Rusta¬
veli's verses that they only begin to
appreciate the content when they go
back and read it over a second time.
The poem's music must of necessity
be largely lost in translation. But
Rustaveli's skill in story-telling, his
psychological insight and his poetic
imagery are of universal appeal.
For Instance, many of the devices
which he uses in unravelling the
complicated plot foreshadow those of
the modern novel: flashbacks, exten
sive dialogue, secondary love Inter¬
ests, the first description of char¬
acters through the dialogue of others,
the quoting of letters. In fact this
aspect and the author's under¬
standing of all the intricate nuances
of human psychology justify us in
looking on the poem as one of the
first novels in the history of European
literature.
Rustaveli's imagery is so rich, and
the poem's similes and metaphors
fall so thick and fast, that I cannot
hope to do justice to them in a few
lines. I shall just mention two images,
both important ones for an under¬
standing of the poem.
The first is the tiger's skin itself.
This, the leitmotif of the whole poem,
is symbolic of Tariel's loved one:
when she was in a rage at her father's
decision to marry her against her will,
she reminded him of a tigress beau¬
tiful even in her fury. But it is also a
symbol of his valour, and of his lonely
life among the wild beasts.
The other is the poet's comparison
of the chief characters to the sun.
This is more than just a conventional
epithet suggesting the sun's brightness
and physical beauty. The sun for
Rustaveli, and here we get into the
realms of the Neo-Platonist philosophy
of the age, stands for an ideal state
of goodness the highest stage of
development, to which man can attain
through his intellect and will-power.
He constantly reminds us that his
heroes and heroines are close to this
state. Towards the end of the poem,
after the rescue of Nestan-Darejan,
we read:
"The Sun has returned and the
[darkness is dispersed,
Evil is overcome; the good prevails,
[and will endure forever."
This optimistic and positive idea of
the victory of justice over arbitrary
power, of good over evil, is the
underlying theme of Rustaveli's work:
man must go on seeking, for he can
achieve complete happiness in this

world. But above all this is a poem
of passion and flesh-and-blood pas¬
sion: worshipping from afar is ob¬
viously no consolation to the Knight in
the Tiger's Skin! Love is seen as a
spur and a signpost in the direction
of higher truth and harmony, which
by the same token, is not to be
achieved by mystic contemplation and
passive "dissolution" in the Deity after
the fashion of the philosophical poetry
of the East: The Knight in the Tiger's
Skin Is a philosophical and ethical
code of action, of will-power. It is
the triumph of the mind and of active
and radiant humanism.
This makes Rustaveli's poem one
of the first great works in a truly
European spirit, if we understand that
spirit to be the achievements and
gains of mankind at the time of the
Renaissance. And though he quotes
from Aristotle and Plato as well as
The embossing and engraving of metal with ornamental designs ¡s a traditional
form of Georgian art, going back 1,000 years. After attaining Its peak
in the late 12th and early 13th centuries in the reign of Queen Tamar,
whose praises were sung by Rustaveli it slowly declined and finally died
out. In the past two decades a number of young Georgian artists, using
the techniques of the medieval masters, have succeeded in giving not
only new life, but also new expression to this ancient art.
THE KNIGHT IN THE TIGER'S SKIN (Continued)
from the Bible and the Koran, it is
not too much to say that Rustaveli
came very close to a profound under¬
standing of Christian philosophy as
it was before it was changed by later
dogmas. At the same time, he is
very close to our present-day un¬
derstanding of the world.
The Knight In the Tiger's Skin has
been translated into many languages,
including Italian, Polish, Hungarian, Ru¬
manian, Czech, Mongolian, Spanish,
Chinese, German, French and English.
It has also been translated into 17 lan¬
guages of the Soviet Union, where
nearly 1,400,000 copies of the work
have been published.

### 18953: A Statement by eleven distinguished geophysicists
December 31, 1965, marked the end of the observational phase of the
International Years of the Quiet Sun. This two-year enterprise, involving
the closest co-operation between scientists of no fewer than 71 countries,
has been concerned with the study of the sun and the earth under condi¬
tions of minimum solar activity.
It formed a complementary enterprise to the even greater scientific
co-operative project of seven years ago the International Geophysical
Year.
Both projects were organized by special committees appointed by the
International Council of Scientific Unions and financial assistance was
given by this Council, by Unesco, and by the participating nations.
Beyond question, the scientific achievements of these two enterprises
have been immense and there can be little doubt that as a result of the
IGY and IQSY, man's understanding of solar and terrestrial phenomena
and of the relationship between them, has advanced to a really enormous
degree. Vast stores of data have been assembled in World Data Centres
located In a number of countries and are freely available for study by
scientists of every country. The planning and organization of these enter¬
prises has occupied the time and energy of innumerable scientists from
all nations over a period of several years. Men of science of every nation
have been brought together in a spirit of friendly understanding and co¬
operation which has known no barriers of nationality, race, colour,
religious or political opinion.
The basic objective of both these projects could be summarized in the
phrase: "The common study of our planet by all for the benefit of all,"
acid it is certain that the objective has been achieved in full measure.
These world-wide co-operative scientific projects have shown conclusively
that, however many and serious are the political problems that trouble the
human race, it is possible for all the nations of the world to work closely
together in great enterprises for the common good.
We, the undersigned, officers of the special committees which organiz¬
ed the projects, wish to commend the examples of the IGY and IQSY to
the peoples of all nations. At the same time, we would wish to express the
earnest hope that scientific academies and governments everywhere will
resolve to place this co-operation in geophysical science on a permanent
basis.
In so doing, we feel that not only will the rapid advance of geophysical
science be maintained but, more importantly, it is certain that this continu¬
ed close co-operation between men of science from all parts of the world
will make a significant contribution to the wider field of human understand¬
ing and goodwill.

### 16925: The Controversy on continental drift
The controversy
on continental drift
(Continued from page 15)
Hemisphere receives more energy
to maintain wind," Prof. Bjerknes
declared. "Winds increase in the
North Pacific", he said, "and, at the
same time, winds in the North Atlantic
decrease. Europe then receives less
heat from the Atlantic and experiences
a colder winter."
When Prof. Bjerknes summarized
his work at a press conference, a
correspondent at once queried: "But
why do the easterlies grow weaker?"
This is the kind of chicken-and-the-
egg question that oceanographers will
be able to answer fully only when they
have understood the movement of
great water masses transporting tem¬
perature changes over thousands of
miles of ocean.
Investigations along this line in the
Gulf Stream were described by
Dr. John Knauss of the University of
Rhode Island in the United States.
Working with newly-developed current
meters that remain three days on the
sea floor recording on magnetic tape,
Dr. Knauss concluded that the Gulf
Stream extends to the bottom even
in deep water. The old concept of
the deep sea as a "zone of no
motion" Is long dead.
Dr. Knauss reasoned that if the
Gulf Stream extends all the way down,
then its meander pattern should be
influenced by bottom topography. In
other words, when the bottom rises,
the Gulf Stream is more affected by
the earth's rotation and wanders off
its previous path.
Dr. Knauss also investigated the
amount of water transported by the
Gulf Stream. Measurements in the
Florida Strait relatively easy to make
because the Gulf Stream is flowing
between fixed banks and not through
the middle of the Ocean indicate
that here it moves 35 million cubic
metres of water a second. In other
words, in the Florida Strait this
immense "ocean river" is moving
350 times as much water as the
world's greatest land river, the Ama¬
zon, whose average flow is only
100,000 cubic metres of water a
second. This particular piece of re¬
search points to the need for still
broader studies an investigation of
the Gulf Stream's flow in deep water
for example.
Seven years from now, the Third
International Océanographie Congress
will probably see many of the ques¬
tions raised in Moscow answered
and many new ones posed.

From the Unesco New
Unesco awarded Marzotto
Prize for international
understanding
Unesco has been awarded the Marzotto
Prize created by the Marzotto Prize
Institution in Italy for the person or insti¬
tution making a major contribution through
cultural activity to the development of
understanding and co-operation among
nations. Mr. René Maheu, received the
prize on behalf of Unesco at a ceremony in
Valdagno, Italy, in September.
Gift. from Japan:
$ 830,000 for Abu Simbel
Unesco has received 300,227,861 yen
(over $830,000) from the Tokyo daily
"Asahi-Shimbum" as a contribution towards
saving the temples of Abu Simbel in Nubia.
The contribution is one of the largest
Unesco has received from a private source
for the Nubian campaign. The money was
raised by an exhibition on Tutankhamen
organized in Japan by "Asahi-Shimbum" in
1965-66, and visited by some three million
people. In 1963, the newspaper set up an
exhibition on "Five Thousand Years of
Egyptian Art" whose proceeds also went
to the Nubian campaign.
Over 800 libraries
linked by teletype
Eight hundred and twenty-one libraries
throughout the world are now linked by
teletype machines, reports the Unesco
Bulletin for Libraries, which points out that
as libraries have to rely increasingly on
each others' collections to fulfil requests,
the teletype is needed to speed up and
simplify operations.
Indonesia to remain
in Unesco
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
Republic of Indonesia has informed the
Director-General of Unesco that "Indonesia
is ready to resume active participation in
the work of Unesco". In February 1965,
Indonesia sent notice of its withdrawal
from Unesco, which was to have taken
effect from December 31, 1966.
New Assistant Directors-
General for Unesco
Mr. René Maheu, Director-General of
Unesco, has appointed two new Assistant
Directors-General. Mr. Tor Gjesdal, who has
been Director of Unesco's Department of
Mass Communication since 1955, becomes
Assistant Director-General for Communi¬
cation. Mr. Gjesdal, who was born in Nor¬
way in 1909, was Director of the United
Nations Department of Public information in
New York from 1946 to 1955. Mr. Mahdi
Elmandjra, formerly director of the executive
office of the Director-General, now becomes
Assistant Director-General for Social
Sciences, Human Sciences and Culture.
Before joining Unesco in 1961, Mr. Elman¬
djra was Director-General of the Moroccan
Radio and Television Organization. He was
born in 1933 in Morocco.

Ü.S. PRESIDENT NAMES SEPT. 8, 1966
INTERNATIONAL LITERACY DAY
September 8, 1966 was designated as International Literacy Day In a proclamation
issued on August 30 by President Lyndon B. Johnson of the United States.
September 8, 1966 marks the first anniversary of the opening in Teheran of the
World Congress of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy convened
by Unesco upon the initiative of the Shah of Iran.
In his proclamation, President Johnson said, in part:
"Illiteracy is the greatest single barrier to economic and social progress In
many of the countries of the world. September 8, 1966, is the first anniversary
of an event which I believe was the turning point in the battle against illiteracy.
On that date one year ago the World Congress of Ministers of Education convened
in Teheran, Iran, to consider the problem.
"That Congress, made up In part by a delegation of distinguished statesmen
and scholars sent by the United States government, established the principles
which now guide the highly commendable efforts of the United Nations Educa¬
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Through experimental projects, Unesco
is creating methods, techniques and materials for full-scale literacy programmes."
The U.S. President called upon the people of his country to commemorate the day
in ways most appropriate to the occasion and to co-operate with national and
International organizations, private groups and Individuals dedicated to the goal of
eliminating the scourge of illiteracy.
Mali aids fight

The Government of Mali has given Unesco
two million Mali francs (over $8,000) to help

Dr. Eugène Rabinowitch
receives Kalinga Prize
Dr. Eugene Rabinowitch, a U.S. scientist, editor and a founder
of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a Journal of Science
and Public Affairs, received the 14th international Kalinga
Prize for the Popularization of Science last month, at
a ceremony in Unesco H.Q. As editor and editorial writer
of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, published in Chi¬
cago, Dr. Rabinowitch has taken an active part In the "Pug¬
wash" movement which has held 14 conferences on science
and world affairs attended by some of the world's most eminent scientists and shap-
ers of science policy (see the Unesco Courier, Nov. 1964). A member of the
faculty of the University of Illinois since 1947, Dr. Rabinowitch has published books
on the implications of modern science for the world today and in the future,
and also on uranium chemistry and photosynthesis. The Kalinga Prize, named
after the empire ruled by the peace-loving Asoka in India 22 centuries ago, is a
personal donation of Mr. Bijoyanand Patnaik, an Indian industrialist, and is awarded
annually by an international jury appointed by Unesco.
of Iran urged member states of Unesco to
contribute one day of their military expendi¬
ture to fight illiteracy. Iran last May gave
Unesco $700,000 drawn from the Iranian
military budget.
Flashes ...
Many countries are gravely short of
trained health workers. At least 15 Afri¬
can countries were still without a single
medical school last year, reports WHO.
About 12% of the world's annual fish
catch comes from inland waters, says FAO,
which is encouraging greater Inland fish
farming, especially in Africa and Latin
America.
Tunisia is aiming at 100 % school enrol¬
ment by 1971. Last year, 86 % of Tunisian
boys attended primary schools, but only
44% of the girls.
A WHO study on cities reveals that in
75 countries one-third of townsfolk have
running water, one-third use public foun¬
tains and the rest must make do with water
from rivers, wells or gutters.
In Hong Kong over 900,000 students
one-quarter of the population attend
schools and educational courses.
PRESERVING BOOKS ON FILM
Millions of pages of manuscripts and documents many of them rare or
unique have been reproduced on film in the past ten years by Unesco's
mobile microfilm units. Set up as a Unesco contribution to educational
services, and in particular libraries, all over the world, the first microfilm
unit was given a threefold mission:
to reproduce and thus preserve a record of documents of cultural, scien¬
tific or historical importance that might be lost through age, climatic condi¬
tions, fire and other causes;
to train staff in countries requesting its services;
to help these countries create their own microfilm services.
From 1956 to 1961 the unit worked in eight Latin American countries,
reproducing almost a million and a half pages of manuscripts and other
important documents. In 1962 it spent nine months in Morocco, reproducing -
more than half a million pages. In 1963-1964 it went on to other Arabic-
speaking countries, including Syria and Egypt. By the end of 1963 it had
extended its operations to Asia, and helped by a second Unesco unit it
has since been introducing microfilming in Malaysia, India and other Asian
countries.
Over 103,000 pages of rare manuscripts and documents were filmed at
Phnom-Penh (Cambodia) by the second Unesco mobile unit between October
1964 and April 1965. Many of these manuscripts had to be brought
from temples in the interior of Cambodia.
When it has been able to spare the time, this unit has also lent a hand
with various local projects not really within Its brief, helping with mapmaking,
school television and other activities where it could save the community time
and trouble.
Microfilming has become an indispensable aid for the librarian and archivist.
The work of Unesco's mobile units has brought it to many countries that
would otherwise have been without its help for some time to come, with
the consequent deterioration or even loss of much precious material.

FATHER OF THE LASER
Sir,
In your article on lasers (Feb. 1964)
no mention is made of the work of
Professor Jean Becquerel, of the
French Academy of Science. Yet all
articles even those written on the
popular science level which describe
the purposes of lasers and masers,
those extraordinary amplifiers of light
energy, speak of Jean Becquerel, to
whose work the optical maser (laser)
owes its origin.
The optics of crystals at low tem¬
peratures, a science initiated by Jean
Becquerel, is today undergoing a
tremendous development.
Jean Becquerel was the first to
study the absorption and fluorescence
spectra of the ruby and to reveal the
collimation of red rays at low temper¬
atures. Using the red rays from the
ruby, Dr. T.H. Maiman, in the United
States, operated the first laser in 1960.
The invention of the laser is therefore
clearly linked with the pioneering work
of Jean Becquerel in crystal optics.
Mme. Jean Becquerel
Fontainebleau, France
OUR SHRINKING PLANET
Sir,
You published some striking facts
about the unprecedented growth of
the world's population in your February
1966 issue.
The Dutch live happily in their
country with 356 people to every
square kilometre. If Australia and
New Zealand, which together cover
7,973,835 square kilometres, had a
population density like that of the
Netherlands, their combined popula¬
tion would total 2,838,685,260 or nearly
as much as the present world popula¬
tion.
I believe the world is mis-managed
because people limit themselves by
boundaries which form states. Unite
these states and everyone will live
happily.
If everyone takes care of his neigh¬
bour no one will suffer.
H. J. Baarslag
ML Albert, New Zealand
WHAT IS YOUTH ?
Sir,
You have published several letters
expressing appreciation of your July-
August 1965 special number on youth.
I, too, liked this number. But may
I ask a question? What is youth?
Youth is just about the most relative
term in the world an arbitrary mental
concept. For consider, "youth" is
continuously merging into "middle
age" which, in turn, is always merging
into "old age." Between these so-
called groups, there is an infinitude of
degrees. However young you are,
there is always somebody younger;
however old, always somebody older.
So why speak of youth as though
it is a static division of the human
race? "Youth" is a disuniting label
almost as dangerous as racist labels.
When will we learn not to divide hu¬
man beings (yes, we are all human
beings) into labelled groups?
Mass circulation newspapers in Brit¬
ain are always writing about "Woman"
and "Women" as though they are not
half the human race. But this is not
quite as stupid as the present-day
concept of "youth" for youth is
something we all have in some degree
or have had. The human race may
be divided into men and women but
it is not divided into young and old.
Even Shaw forgot this when he said,
"Youth is a wonderful thing; what a
pity to waste it on children." Far more
precise was Havelock Ellis when he
wrote that the climax of anti-social
behaviour is reached round about the
age of 20 (a fact proved by present-
day criminal statistics).
Most people, to my observation, get
gradually less violent and more tol¬
erant as they mature in years. Even¬
tually they come to look back on their
younger days, sometimes with pleas¬
ure but often with a blush or two for
the stupidities and unthinking cruelties
of immaturity. Those who blush most
as they remember the past are those
who have matured the most. I would
like to see more reverence for "Old
Age" and fewer pedestals for "Youth".
The greatest civilizations (the Sung
dynasty for example) have revered ma¬
turity.

LEARNING FROM
THE WINDMILL
Sir,
I read your issue on "Our Thirsty
Hungry World" (April 1966) with much
interest. It made me realize how we
have failed to distribute our knowledge
and means of modern technology.
One of the reasons is the very nature
of this technology, which cannot grow
and bear fruit on a soil that has not
been conditioned to receive it. For¬
tunately this conditioning will take less
time and money than it has taken in
the history of now highly developed
countries.
It might be good sense in the mean¬
time to take the experience of a less
highly developed technical period and
put it to good use until better means
will be available. I know of one field
in engineering where this collected
experience is available and where it
could be used. For this reason I bring
to your attention a review of a book
about the Dutch windmills.
Prof. Dr. Ir. W.M.J. Schlosser
Eindhoven, Netherlands
The book in question, "Research
Inspired by the Dutch Windmills" by
the Prinsenmolen Committee, and
published by H. Veenman en Zonen,
Wageningen, Netherlands, deals with
the design of windmills well proven
machines for raising water on the1,
basis of modern aerodynamics and
wind tunnel tests. It presents, in
185 pages with 90 drawings, the col¬
lected information about the subject
that was available in the Netherlands
between 1935 and 1960 Editor.
RENDER UNTO CAESAR
Sir,
I was delighted by the article "For
Children Only" (March 1966) on the
remarkable children's library at Cla-
mart, near Paris, which I visited re¬
cently with a group of librarians.
Bravo, for showing readers this library
which is an innovation from several
viewpoints and one which we hope to
see widely copied.
What a pity, though, that the name of
the architect was not mentioned. Much
of the library's success is due to its
design, to the use of simple materials
and to the excellent lighting arrange¬
ments.
In this particular case I would say
that the architect has probably made
a more original and novel contribution
than the librarian. At any rate, it has
a stimulating effect, as anyone can
confirm who has seen the enthusiasm
and satisfaction of the young libra¬
rians working in this field.
Eliette Segalen
Boulogne-sur-Selne, France
Not one, but four architects designed
the Clamart library. They are:
Messrs. J. Renaudie, P. Riboulet,
G. Thurnauer and J.L. Veret Editor.
WHY NOT A 'JUNIOR COURIER'?
Sir,
My son, aged 6, Is very Interested
in space. I am sure he will like the
pictures in your May 1966 issue. But
he is too young for the text. Why
not have a Junior Courier for, say, the
6 to 1 1 year-olds? Previous genera¬
tions (and the present one) have made
a poor show of bringing the world to
law and order; the sooner we set
the next generation off along the path
to world community the better.
John Roberts
London, England
FOR FREEDOM FROM HUNGER
Sir,
As a representative of the Freedom
from Hunger Campaign Committee In
Beauvais, France, I should like to tell
you what this group of young people
is doing. A correspondent at Bossan-
goa (Central African Republic)
suggested that we should buy millet
grinders which would lighten the work
of the women and also help to reduce
infant mortality. Porridge made by
cooking millet meal is, in fact, much
more digestible than porridge made .
from manioc meal, but millet is harder
to grind. We aim to provide ten
millet grinders at a total cost of 30,000
francs (£2.100 or $6,000), and to raise
this sum we have joined forces with
the town of Chantilly, near Paris.
