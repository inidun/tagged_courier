Executive Board Hears
Unesco progress
c
AT its eighth session, held July 12-17, the Unesco Executive Board,heard progress reports on efforts being made to mobilize the"resour-I
ces of education, science and the arts throughout the world in the
cause of peace and international understanding. Activities to be
carried out during the remainder of this year and a draft world
programme and budget for 1949 were also under consideration.1. fle--elIllteen-man J : j 0 a r Q.
under the chairmanship of Dr. E.
Ronald Walker, first studied a
report of developments since its
sixth session (February 12-15,
1948) presented by Dr. Julian
Huxley. This reviewed progress
in the various fields of the orga-
nisation's activity, ranging from
'Pilot Projects'in Fundamental
Education for under-privileged
people and reconstruction aid to
educational institutions in war-
wrecked regions to the sponsor-
ship of study-grants and fellow-
ships and assistance in the crea-
tion of an International Theatre
Institute.
Huxley Reports Advances
Dr. Huxley reported that in
1948 grants-in-aid to internation-
al scientific societies engaged
on work in furtherance of
Unesco's activities would total
$231, 174. These funds would oe
used for the travel expenses of
scientific workers to conferences
and symposia, for publicaUol1s
and for assistance to internatioa-
al laboratories and stockrooms.
The four Field Science Cooper-
ation Offices Unesco has estab-
lished-in Latin America, the
Middle East, Easl Asia and
South Asia-are engaged in
collecting, exchanging and dissem-
inating scientific information
between those regions and other
areas of the world.
Wherever the facilities permit,
Dr. Huxley said, questions are
met locally by the Unesco field
officers, but there is a continual,-
flow of enquiries reaching the
Paris headquarters which are
handled with the help of pro-
gramme specialists.
The report pointed out, for
example, that a"List of Scien-
tific Works published in the
Middle East"has been produced
and distributed by the Cairo
Field Science Office."This is the
beginning of a flow of general
information", Dr. Huxley said
"which should be oi use to other
parts of the world as well as to I
the region itself".
Dr. Huxley refened to the work

each consisting of several hundred
books and pamphlets on interna-
tional subjects in English, French

and German, had been assembled
and distributed to thirty such
camps during July.
In the field of Fundamental,
Education, Dr. Huxley spoke of
significant progress in the'Pilot
Projects"sponsored jointly by
Unesco and the governments con-
cerned. These projects-exper-
iments in testing the latest tech-
niques and materials in bring-
ing a basic education to under-
privileged people-are under way
or in advaneed stages of prepare-,
ation in China, East Africa.'
Haiti and Peru.
The U. S. Commission for Inter-I
national Educational Reconstruc-
tion, Dr. Huxley further reported
has announced the distribution
of more than eighty million
dollars in materials during 1947-
48 to countries whose education-
al facilities were damages dur-
ing the war. These distributions !
consisted of various types of
school supplies, books and perio-
dicals, of the granting of fellow-
ships and study grants and of
technical advisory missions.
The Executive Board then con-
sidered Unesco's cooperation with
the United Nations : its Special-
ized Agencies and other interna-
tional organizations. It instruc-
ted the Secretariat to develop
further Unesco's representation'n
the main cultural regions of the
world in order to make more
effective its programr. le of action.

At Utrecht
World leaders in higher educa-
tion met early this month at a
Preparatory Conference of Repre-
sentatives of Universities m
Utrecht, the Netherlands. The
Unesco-sponsored conference-
first of its kind since 1937-provid-
ed an opportunity for top-level
educators to discuss common prob-
lems and to provide mutual assis-
tance In their solution.
Some three hundred university
representatives from thirty-two
countries are attending the twelve-
day meetings, August 2-13, which
were presided over by Dr H. I.
Kruyt, Chairman of the Nether-
lands National Commission for
Unesco.
In his opening address to the
conference, held in the old audi-
torium of the University of
Utrecht, Dr. Kruyt expressed the
hope that the meetings"with the
firm will to promote higher edu-
cation all over the world will give
results which will be beneficial to
us all and which will promote that
mutual understanding that always
leads to mutual respect".

Important steps forward towards the care of children handicapped
by the war were taken last month with the creation of an International
Federation of Children's Communities at Trogen, Switzerland. The
new agency was formed during a conference of Directors of Children 5

ing day by asserting that in his
opinion the world's institutions of
higher learning had not yet learn-
ed how to form the citizens of a
world community. He called on
universities to grasp the leader-
ship which can give the world an
understanding of interdependence
of nations and a One-World way
of living.
Str2ssing the importance of the :
conference, he pointed out its
purpose as that of promoting in-
ternational understanding through
providing an opportunity 01 repre-
sentatives of universities through-
out the world to discuss their
common problems and to arrive
at common solutions.
Mr. Laves emphasized that such
discussions would be useless unless
they were practical enough to en-
compass the realities of the pre-
sent-day world."Research atone",
he said,"is not enough. Positive
steps are required... to ensure that
understanding is made widespread
and that the necessary trained
leadership is available to conduct
the affairs of this one world".

At Adelphi College, Gaxden

countries are examining problems
of"Childhood Education between

ferent countries, are studying
methods of"The Education and

Far distant, in Caracas, Vene-
zuela, a fourth seminar is being
sponsored by the Pan-American
Union with the close cooperation
of Unesco to work out regional
problems of education in Latin
America.
Each of the seminars plays an
important role m the educational
programme of Unesco. for through

throughout the world, sponsor
psychological research, train per-
sonr_el, raise funds for the main-
tenance of such villages and will
work closely with United Nations
agencies interested in the prob-
lems of war-handicapped youth.
Studying the problems which
face organizers and sponsors of
children's communities, the con-
ference found the most urgent
to be that of equipment and
other material aid. Many com-
munities are struggling to func-
tion without government aid of
any kind and are entirely
dependent on gifts and subscrip-
tions for their maintenance.
A second major problem-one
of high importance to Uneseo-
was how educational and psycho-
logical methods may best be
adapted and developed so as to
assist this type of child to become
a useful and happy citizen.
It was evident, therefore, that
only by linkmg up children's vil-
lages throughout the world could,
the most effective work be cart : wed
out for the war's most tragic sic-
tims. Unesco was asked bv a
conference resolution to assist the
new Federation in this way by
organizing two meetings a year
for village directors, by making
available a technical service for
information and psycho-pedago-
gical consultation and by extend-
ing its reconstruction programme
to include the children's com-
munities.
Two important resolutions were
also adopted regarding interna-
tional action for the protection
of children. The first of these
declared :

(Padre'Antonio Rivolta, founder oj the jirst"Children's Village"
in Italy, was one oj jive Italian delegates to the Conjerence o/Directors
oj Children's Villages at Trogen, Switzerland, jrom July 4-11. His
village, silUated at Santa Marinella-Civitavecchia, outside Rome, has
been in operation for the past three years and is regarded as one or
the most successful such experiments, In'he following article, Don
Rivolta tells something of how the experiment was ? tade to work, J.
Despite the
passage of time,'
children in
many countries
are still suffer-
ing from physi-
cal poverty and
spiritual distress. The picture of
many children buried under the
wreckage of houses destroyed by
bombardment is but a symbol of
the other, more serious aid pa-
thetic damage to the delicate fibre
of the spirit, in the hidden, vital
realm of developing psychology.
From the wreckage of war, ra-
gamuffins have emerged, adoles-
cents quite alone in the world,
orphans, cripples, homeless chil-
dren, physically and morally
abandoned.
Sceptics and-pessimists have
raised the objection :"These boys
who have been used to unrestr : c-
ted freedom, an adventurous life
and easy money can never be
persuaded to leave the streets."
The pessimists have been pro-
ved. wrong.
We have been persuading the
boys to leave the streets for three
years at the children's village
near Santa Marinella-Civitavec-
chia, the first such village to be
established in Italy.

France, was elected Chairman of

Committee.
At a press conference following
the conference, Dr. Preaut ap-
pealed for world-wide support for
the villages so that the many
thousands of war orphans may
be restored to physical and
mental health. The new agency
he said, is setting up centres ic.

Other members of the Fede-
ration's Coordinating Committee,
Dr. Préaut announced, include :
Professor Ernesto Codignola, Di-
rector of the Scuola-Citta Pesta-
Jozzi, Florence, Italy Mr. Arthur

places have been left open for
village directors from Eastern
European countries.
Delegates and observers to the
Trogen conference agreed that
the meetings were marked above
all by an atmosphere of good-
will, sincerity and mutual respect.
Deeply-felt interest in the prob-
lems on hand was everywhere vi-
sible. And at the conclusion of
the meetings it. was clear that a
significant step forward-and a
much needed one-had been
taken towards practical help for
the youthful victims of total war.
first assistance centres in Rome
and out of them there developed
the"Children's Village", which
aims at taking in and re-edu-
cating street children between the
agæ of ten and seventeen.
The keystone of life in the Vil-
lage Is freedom ; freedom from
external restrictions and also
from any internal restric-
tions which are
not freely reco-
gnized as neces-
sary and accept-
ed. There are no
enclosures i n
the Village, no
bars, no fences, but only the psy-
chological boundaries established
by the comer. unity as a whole.
Each boy's personal freedom 18
limited only by the freedom of
the others. The principle of
freedom is also applied with re-
gard to religion.
The head and director of the
administration is the"Mayer"
who is the highest authority in
the community. The mayor is
elected every month, by secret
ballot and an absolute majority
by all the citizens. The newly
elected mayor submits a list of
his colleagues to a general as-
sembly for approval-i. e. his. ad-
visers on health, school affairs,
public works and finance. Each of
them in turn is made responsible
for one of those specific branches
of the community's every day Me.
One of the most strikin featu-
res of the Village is that a spe-
cial currency called'Merits'has
been established for it. It is the
most influential factor in the pe-
dagogic system on which the
boys're-education is based. Self-
interest was the only incentive
known to the street-boys in their
disorderly, dangerous and not al-
ways clearly directed activities.
All the reformed boys in the
Village are given elementary edu-
cation in the State Primary
School. This is a part of our
work which, although it is so im-
portant and so delicate, has not
yet been fitted compete ! y into
our educational system because
We are obliged to follow the offi-
cial instructions, principles and
standards of judgment.
We are therefore taking steps
to establish an experimental
school which We hope will be
approved by the central author.
ties.
At the present time, our
greatest difficulty is in the
training of educators free from
the traditional passive attitudo.
The educator must be an artist
but at the same time he must
understand fully the individual
he is tao teach ; to teach suc-
cessfully he must be thoroughly
familaf with the methods of ins-
truction.
We should like to see Children's
Villages set up in every country
in an atmosphere of close co-
operation, which will ensure for
the new post-war generations a
healthier and better-balanced
life, both physically and spiri-
tually, for the greater happiness
of the individual and society.

Dr. Clarence E. Beeby, Assistant
Director-General of Unesco, then
spoke on the"Purpose and Scope
of the Conference"in which he
called on the delegates to assume
the leading role rather than have
Unesco as the most active parti-
cipant.
University problems throughout
the world, Dr. Beeby declared,
were very similar. The universities
of today are overcrowded, lack
trained personnel and equipment
and. more important, sufficient
funds are not made available by
governments.
Regarding the scope of the con-

(Continued from page 1.)
A study is now under way, it was
reported, of possibilities of esta-
blishing such a cultural centre
for the Middle East.
After considering an appeal
from the Royal Greek Govern-
ment concerning the deportation
of children from Greece, the
Board unanimously voted that
Unesco should study the report
of the special United Nations
Commission now investigating
the Balkan situation and
should"offer its services within
the field of its competence to
these children consistently with
the recommendations of the Com-
mission".
The question of the admission
to membership of'dimunitive
states'was discussed following a
request from Monaco to join
Unesco. Final decision was defer-
red to the next session of the
General Conference which will
also hear a report of various solu-
tions including an alternative to
full membership.
Proposals for the world pro-
gramme and the budget for
Unesco's work during 1949 will be
forwarded to Member States for
their consideration prior to the
next session of the General Con-
ference. A drat programme, as
prepared by the Board's Pro-
gramme Committee, was adopted
for recommendation to the Gene-
ral Conference, subject to various
changes to be made by the Secre-
tariat.

. SCIENTISTS have always formed a world brotherhood. TheirJ problems, and the solutions they sometimes find. are truly
human and therefore international. What wonderful scope for
the development of collaboration and brotherhood between the
different countries of the world ! The only spade-work needed for
mutual understanding between scientists is the mere understanding
of the same language : if they have this. two botanists or two
physicists from the most distant continents are immediately drawn
together oy strong common interests. *
Tile task Of the
Unesco Science De-
partment is to cul-
tivate this favourable
soil, to extend it
beyond purely learned
or scientific circles, to
throw't open to all
types of technicians,
those who apply science
at all levels, those
who are interested in
following its progress3
and those who receive
its benefits-to every-
one, in fact.
How can Unesco ac-
compHsh this immense
task which holds out
such hope for the fu-
ture of peace ? It has
a very small staff and
funds in comparison
with certain national
or even international
bodies also devoted to
science. But Unesco
has one unique ad-
vantage, due to its
situation at tre very
hub of world interest
and to its prestige as
the only cultural orga-
nization with an au-
thority which is re-
cognized and upheld
by the great majority
of nations. This pri-
vileged position should
enable the Science
Division even with li-
mited means, to achie-
ve important results,
thanks to"catalysis"
if I may use that
technical word.
Catalysis is a physico-chemi-
cal phenomenon, enabling certain
bodies, called catalysis, to bring
about important chemical trans-
formations in their surroundmgs

which possesses the necessary
"potential"for transformation,
but is prevented by various
frictions, barriers and deviations
from following the desired path,
the catalyst, by its presence and
by action so subtle that it is not
used up in the process, causes
the barriers to be overcome, the
deviations avoided, and success-
fully completes the evolution.
The final result is often better
than could ever have been
achieved if the system had been
left to itself, even for a long
time. For example, in its
unguided evolution, the system
would have strayed into some
by-path, which would have led
it in quite another direction.
I think that the work of
Unesco can be described largely
on the analogy of this catalysis.
For example, one of the tasks
in which the Science Depart-
ment has already had conside-
rable success, is in bringing
about by"catalysis"the f. rma-
tion of new international orga-
nizations These organizations
may be in the form of scientific
unions, which group the world's
specialists in a certain field,
through their common interests.
.. There is also the creation of
international researsh institutes,
where scientists, working in
specialized laboratories, can meet
and make a strong, concerted
effort In certain fixed directions :
detailed studies of the resources
of certain territories or parts of
the world with a specific charac-
ter (Hyiear Amazon, and later,
perhaps, some arid or desert
zone), studies of certain vital
problems for humanity, such as
contagious diseases, telegraph
and telephone transmissions by
electric waves, etc.
In all these cases, it Is neces-

the forces of eo-operatio-and
understanding throughout the
world. which cannot by themsel-
ves find the logical Or the admi-
nistrative means of action.
For example. in the medical
world, it had been realized for
a long time that numerous me-
dical congresses were being held
haphazardly in different parts
of the world without any co-
ordinating authority. By he
formation 0 : a permanent office
for these congresses, order can
immediately be brought into all
this activity, and the work both.
of organizers and participants be
made far more effective.
I take this opportunity 3f
showing the necessity of colla-
boration between the different
specialized agencies of the United
Nations, Unesco, WHO, FAO
and the Social and economic
Council : the activity I have'us :
outlined is one common : o
Unesco anè ; the World. wealth
Organi7. ations.
But the Uneaco Science Depart-
ment has not only to supply an
immediate remedy for problems
which, as everyone knows, can
and must oe ; olved. It must look
further, and make plans for the
future which it may take years
to carry out. These ülans must oe
studied with the experts, review-
ed and examiner by authorities
throughout the world, so that an
atmosphere and a favourable opi-
nion may be created, in older
that they may finally be realized'
without too much effort. i
. I
I could perhaps give as am i
instance of this long-range work I
the organization of the immense,
labour of editing, publishing and
classifying abstracts of original
articles. People are coming to
realiz the need for such an or-
ganization on a world scale and
Ü must be extended later to the
publication of original, scientific
literature itself.
It will readilv be seen that the
type of activity described here as
catalysis can be carried out by a
fairly small number of'people, pro-
vided they are sufficiently quali-
fied, and need not cost a great
deal. It must be added, however.
that Unesco cannot abandon the'
bodies and institutions which al-
ready existed or vhich have been
formed through its organizing ac-
tivity. It must continue to give
them material and financial assis-
tance, at least uni\ they have
attained fuel : maturity. In certain
cases permanent aid must be
given, owing to the universal cha-
racter of the institutions : n
question.
Generosity sometimes consists
in accepting aid. The Secretariat
of Unesco must consider its rela-
tions-with the national and in-
ternational institutions it sup-
ports, as being reciprocal. For
instance, certain existing institu-
tions and organizations may help
to solve many special problems
met with by the Science Division.
and this applies especially to the
offices of scientific co-operation.
Arrangements and contracts con-
cerning these problems enable
Unesco to take swift action and
at the same time encourage these
institutions in their useful work
In this article, I have tried
only to point out some of the gen-
eral features which seem to me
to characterize the work c° Unes-
co Science Division. The Depart-
ment must inform, aid and guide
international scientific activity.
It must disseminate the results of
this activity. For that purpose it
must both help and be helped oy
existing national and interna-
tional institutions. It must create
new ones when the need arises.
Through its own outside services.
its offices of scientific co-opera-
tion, Unesco must bring the same
benefits to the most remote areas.
It will then have contributed
largely towards creating in the
world an atmosphere of confi-
dence and peaceful collaboration.
PACIFIC SCIENCE CONGRESS
GIVEN UNESCO 6RANI
Unesco has granted twenty
thousand dollars to the Seventh
Pacific Science Congress to ena-
ble seven scientists from war-
devastated countries in Asia
and two from Holland and
Scandinavia to participate in its
meetings at Auckland and
Christchurch, New Zealand, Fe-
bruary 2, 23, 1949.
Thus far. this constitutes the
largest single financial assistance
Unesco has given to a scientific
congress. The funds will be taken
from the reserve fund \'the
1948 budget, in order that the
financial aid be available in
time. This is tangible evidence
of Unesco's interest in the im-
portant scientific congress.
Though regional in name, the
Pacific Science Congress i. inter-
national in fact. The first
congress was held at Honolulu
in 1920. The forthcoming con-
gress is the seventh and b being
organized by the Royal Society
of New Zealand with the assist-
ance of the Government of that
country.
Invitations have been sent to
three countries in North America.
six in Central America, ten in
South America, four in Asia, one
in Australasia and seven in Eu-
rope. Denmark, Norway and Swe-
den are included in the seven Eu-
ropean countries because of the
important work in oceanography.
both physical and biological.
which Scandinavian scientists
have carried out in the Pacific.
In addition to the thirty-two
countries (thirty-one invited and
the host), seventeen. dependent
territories in Asia and Oceania
have also been asked to be
represented.
The congress has ten divisions :
Geophysics and Geology, Meteoro-
logy, Oceanography and Mari-
ne Biology, Zoology. Botany, Soil
Resources and Agriculture, An-
thropology. Public Health and
Nutrition, Social Sciences, and
Organization of Research.

Representatives of forty-five
nations, seven international
scientific bodies and the United
Nations with four of its specia-
lized agencies have been invited
to a Unesco conference on high
altitude Research Stations at
Interlaken. Switzerland, August
31-September 3, 1948.
Delegates will review scientific
problems of high altitude
research and will survey existing
high altitude stations. Studies
will also be made of how
best to coordinate research pro-
grammes of existing stations and
of the possible need foe new
stations.
The physical, astronomical
and biological aspects of high
altitude research may appear
purely academic to some. Yet, as
Profesor Carlos Monge pointed
out at the Unesco General Con-
ference, there are today more
than a hundred million people
of the world's population living
at'high altitude'.
Unesco has organized the con-
ference with the cooperation and
assistance of the Swiss au-
thorities and'the International
High Altitude Research Station
at Jungfraujoch. Attendance

will be met, however, rutside
Unesco funds.

"emergency Credits
Ptan Stud ied
Last year Unesco spent nearly
a quarter of a million dollars on
the purchase and shipping of
scientific equipment for the re-
habilitation of scientific educa-
! tion and research in tu war-
damaged countries of Europe and
Asia. From the experience gain-
ed. a new system of allocations-
known as the"Emergency
Science Credits Scheme"-is to-
day under preparation by Unesco
to improve and at the same time
to simplify its operation in this
field.
The scheme is one of allocating
financial credits to Scientific ins-
titutions in the war-devastated
countries for the purchase of
equipment. The institutions
would be invited to select and
order through Unes-j the mate-
rials they feel are most urgently
needed up to the limit of the
funds allocated them.
The institutions requiting as-
distance would then. receive the
needed equipment directly from
the science mstrument manufac-
turers who would be reimbursed
from Unesco funds.
Details of the scheme, and of
the broader picture of scientific
reconstruction needs throughout
the world, were studied in June
at Unesco House by a panel of
science instrument experts from
eight countries..'. so considered
was the present supply of export-
able scientific equipment, prob-
lems of finance and currency ex-
change, an :.. the shipping and
safe delivery of the goods.
The representatives passed a
unanimous resolution calling at-
tention to the importance of re-
habilitating scientific and tech-
nological education and research
in the war-wrecked countries.
Urgent consideration, they agreed,
should be given to the needs of
science in any scheme for the
lasting re. storation of the econo-
mic life of those countries.
It was noted that there exists
today a world scarcity of scienti-
fic equipment for education and
research. Before WorL War II,
the principal scientific supplies
came from Germany, the U. S. A.
and the United Kingdom. DurlUg
the war. British and American
Production facilities were direct-
ed to highly-specialized war-ins-
truments. After the war. German
Industrial potential was great ! v
decreases and the industries of
the United States and United
Kingdom were faced with tre-
mendous arrears of production in
civilian equipment.
At the present time. the
demand for scientific apparatus
is so much greater than the sup-'
ply that delivery delays from
twelve to eighteen months are
quite common. The basic need
are everywhere the same : la-
boratory glassware and porce-
lain, microscopes, analytical
balances, consumable chemicals,
electrical instruments, etc.
The scheme now under prepa-
ration by Unesco, it is hoped, will
assist in systematizing and co-
ordinating at least a measure of
the orders for equipment from
the war-torn regions.

### 73816: Ideas Group formed to spur production

### 73817: Mass Media Projects Division to dramatize world cooperation

### 73818: Need for teamwork to be stressed

"IDEAS GROUP FORMED
TO SPUR PRODUCTION
 FTER two months of active life the Projects Division is getting
A into its stride. Its basic structure was completed last month bythe addition of a Press Unit composed, for the present, of a
nucleus of three members only. but capable of expansion as its pro-
gramme develops and its productive needs become clearly defined.
The Radio Unit, whose work was given initial priority, and the Film
Unit, after a period of preliminary Organisation, are entering the pro-
ductive stage.
These three units, together with
the"ideas group"of four mem-
bers, each of whom is eminent in
his own sphere, make up the"pro-
duction unit based on an i7terna-
tional ideas bureau"which the
Director-General was instructed to
establish by resolution of the
Mexico General Conference per-
sonnel. The teams are a living
example of the spirit of intern-
tional co-operation for which the
UN and Unesco stand.
The ideas group, composed of W.
E Williams. Roger CaiIIois. Ed-
mond Taylor and George Vosko-
vec, is drawn from Grea : Britain,
France, the United States and
Czechoslovakia.
Wide Range of interests
The wide range of interests and
qualifications covered by the
membership of the ideas group
provides the three other teams
with the basis of their activities.
As Director of the (British) Bu-
reau of Current Affairs and a
member of the editorial board of
. the well-known Penguin Editions.
Mr. William brings to the ieader-
ship of this group the specialised
knowledge of a publisher as well
as a wide a : 1d varied experience
of world affairs and the problems
involved in making the fruit of
such experience available to a
world-wide audience.
M. CaiIIois. the French mem-
ber, is a teacher and writer who
has made a speial study of the
cultural influences of the world's
great religious bodies and whose
experience ranges from public-
tion of a literary review cm'revs
Franchises) in Argentina to cul-
tural missions undertaken at the
request of the French Government
In the United States and Mexico.
Mr. Taylor, a writer of note on
problems of international psycho-
logy. spe : 1t 3 years in India dur-
lng the war and is the author of"Richer by Asia,"a remarkable
study of Indian life and culture.
M. Voskovec, the Czech mem-
ber of the group, h.-. s behind him
a career which for variety and
enterprise accords well with the
recent history of tis native land.
A writer and poet by choice, he
was for twelve years before the
Munich disaster the director of a
satirical theatre in Prague for
which he wrote his own plays in
collaboration with his friend Jan
Werith. Their combined mitials
gave the"V. & W. Theatre,"its
name. The theatre was closed
after the Munich surrender, and
Mr. Voskovec went to the United
States, where he worked for the
B. B. C. and later for the American
O. W. I. during the war.
In addition to these outstand-
ing members of the ideas group,
the three working teams are staff-
ed by men and women exception-
ally qualified to propagate the
ideals and purposes of Unesco
through the several channels of
mass communication of which
they have special knowledge and
experience.
With such a variety of talent at
its disposal, the Projects Division
should be well fitted to carry out
the tasks assigned to it by its
working plan. Its basic motive is
to imtiate activities which foster
those values of international peace
and of common welfare of man-
kind which Unesco is pledged to
advance, and make Unesco's mis-
sion more apparent and attractive
to the public..,
I
Study Current Events
To do this, the Projects Division
makes a constant study of cur-
rent events and items of interna-
tional news, ideas emanating from
go : 1eral conferences, national com-
missions and panels of experts,
and ideas produced b : : t : 1e Unesco
Secretariat.In framing its first practical
programme, which is necessarily
experimental and subject to
change in the light of the ex-
perience gained during the first
few months, the Projects Division !
was guided by four main themes.)
(1) Peace and human progress
depend upon the free flow of ideas
and information ;
'2) Peace and human progress
are produced and maintained by
International co-operation ;
(3) Peace and human progress
require that each generation exert
its best efforts in educating the
next generation ;
(4) Peace and human progress
- and human survival itself-are
challenges to the goodwill, courage
and energy of every human being.
. Keeping these guiding principles
in view, the ideas group has fram-
ed a programme for the working
groups which they are now en-
gaged i : 1 bringing to the stage of
practical realisation.
The aim of this programme is
to translate the principles for-
mulated by the ideas group into
material for direct communication
to the masses-always the most
difficult step in a proces. of cul-
turalindoctrination. Between the
realm of thought and that of
action there is aa invisible barrier.
something like the". tonic barrier"
that confronts the high-speed
flyer as his jet-plane approaches
the speed of sound.
To make his ideas effective, the

thins barrier, even at the risk of
wrecking the delicate structure
his imagination has created. J.
If that structure passes the test.
then his ideas are sound, and all
is well. If not, he must thi : 1k
again.
Some or, all of the themes laid
down by the ideas group are inter-
changeable for purposes of mass
communication : that. is, they can
be presented equally well through
the medium of the Press, radio or
films.
It is up to the expert members
of the working teams to advise
the Projects Division wha. are the
best media for use in each case,
and thereafter to translate the
themes allotted to them into ma-
terial for direct contact with the
masses and to se to it that avail-
able channels of distribution and
propagation are used to the best
advantage.
lr 0 focus world interest andattent : yon on the necessary
for cooperation, the Unesco
Mass Communications Projects
Division has evolved several spe-
cific activities wich are today in
the process of implementation.
Each is designed to show con-
cretely and dramatically how peo-
ple may work together across na-
tional frontiers, how true advan-
cement has been achieved only
through such coJlaboration and
how full a future lies ahead if we
approach it on a One-World basis.
The projects will be brought W
fulfilment not by the Unesco Se-
cretariat alone, working in isola-
tion within its headquarters in
Paris, but by the cooperation of
the National Commissions and
governments, through the mass
media of the film, press and radio
industries, and by the close parti-
cipation of the most essential
members of Unesco : the people
everywhere.
Unesco itself will carry out little
of the'production'. It will act

'NEED FOR TEAMWORK
TO BE STRESSED
lr HE long-nnge programme of the Mass Communications ProjectsDivision, intended as a framework within which specific radio,
film and press projects will be developed, is based upon the
four major themes mentioned in column two.
It consists of the elaboration of these major themes and their
application to specific topics in the fields of science, education,. ! _-
culture and world co-operation.
Among the subsidiary themes
selected for special emphasis in
the field of science are the follow-
ing :
The tangible results of modern
science are the fruit of certain
intellectual qualities that are as
essential in civic and private life
as they are in science : common
sense, clear reason. ng. accurate
observation, painstaking verifica-
tion of conclusions.
Certain ethical ideals-honesty,
humanitarian motivation, respect
for freedom of thought, co-opera-
tion, lack of pre. iudice in social
relatioflo' ;-have played an equally
great role in the development of
science, and the cultivar : on of
these virtues is essential 00 its
continued progress.
Important discoveries in any
branch of science often spring
from advances in other branches,
and sometimes the most important
concrete results are made possible
by abstract and seemingly imprac-
tical research.
Every important scientific ad-
vance, while it solves some human
problems, raises ne"ones, a : 1<1
thus requires on the part of every
one a constant effort of self-
education and mental adjustment
to changed conditions.
In education considerable em-
phasis is naturally placed on sup-
porting Unesco activities in the
field of Fundamental Education,
making clear that this does not
only mean the fight against illi-
teracy, but the task of training
both children and adults to face
the problems of the modern world.
Among the cultural themes
selected for particular emphasis
are those which help to bring
home the idea that man has
reached a point in his evolution
where he no longer belongs to a
single isolated culture. The mod-
ern cultural world has no terri-
trial boundaries and every cul-,
ture in it is subjec : to the in-
fJuence of other cultures.
It is the duty of modern man
to become fully conscious of the
treasures which history has hand-
ed down to him and to cho-operatic
with his fellows in all parts of
the world to enrich the heritage
of the next generation.
- In developing specific cultural
programmes based on the fore-
going themes a particular effort
will be made to include, along
with the major arts and philo-
sophy, material dealing with the
arts of daily life as they have
been developed in various cultures.
In the field of International co-
operation the programme lays
down a number oi significant
themes. On the one hand it seeKS
whenever possible to develop our

ternational co-operation is the
only answer to many of the sOCir, l,

On the other hand It aims to

international co-operat'. on frcm
disappointments arising out of
over optimism and impatience by
calling attention to the psycholo-
gical, social, cultural and other
problems which international or-
ganisations encounter in their
work.
Finally, the programme aims at
presenting a balanced picture of
man for or against himself, by
showing on the one hand the
disastrous consequences of con-
flies, and on the other hand the
almost Iimitles. s possibilities of
human progress in a peaceful and
co-operative world.
between the peoples. The docu-
ment would also highlight future
events of interest to Unesco's aims
with a calendar of day-to-day
coming events.
It is well-known that cultural
news presented to the public has
for its pretexts occasions such as
the re-issue of a book. the opening
of a gallery or exhibition. Such
occasions are a means of breath-
ing new life into masterpieces or
of refreshing memories of events
of importance for the human.

### 73819: Press, film, radio to be mobilized for peace

### 73820: Technical Needs Commission studies field reports

Press, Film, Radio To Be Mobilized for Peace
"'., ORE and more people realise to-day that peace and progress
` depend to a considerable extent upon the amount and kmd of
information fed to the minds of men throughout the world.
There was a time when press and information were considered merely
from the commercial and industrial angle. Today, the complex prob-
lems relating to the social role of the information apparatus are
being systematically studied especially from the decisive point of view
of the public's right to be objectively and reliably informed.
A Czech film studio is destroyed by fire. More than three quarter of
mass media facilities were disrupted in many war-torn countries.
Unesco's field surveys dis-
closed startling disparities in
the availability of technical
equipment. It was learned, for
example, : hat while Uruguay
has one radio receiving set for
each seven members of its po-
pulation, Burma has only one
for each 3, 400, and India one
for each 1, 490 of its people.
Denmark has one receiving set
'for virtually each of its fami-
lies, while Haiti has but one set
for eac ! ! two hundred families
Cant'lea has nearly thirty
times more newsprint per ca-
pita than Jugoslavia. and
Sweden has at least twenty
times as much as China. Swit-
zerland haë five times more
seating capacity in its cinemas
than Venezuela.
With the end of World War II
the war-devastated countries four. d
themselves faced with the prob-
lem of rehabilitating their press.
The ranks of competent jour-
nalists had been thinned through
enemy suppression or subsequent
purges. Normal professional con-
tacts with the rest of the world
had been interrupted for years.
As a result, the problem of how
to train more and better jour-
nalists and to safeguard certain
professional standards was forced
upon the urgent attention not.
only of professionals but also of
responsible sections of the pubic.
Unesco, in its aim to encourage
and facilitate the"free flow of
information by world and image"
in the post-war world, associated
itself from the outset with these
endeavours.
Thanks to its world-wide links
and authority Unesco was clearly
called upon to encourage and
guide efforts l : key to improve in-
formation, as well as the technical
conditions for its dissemination.
To achieve such necessary im-
provements Unesco concentrated
its efforts on the international
professional, sphere. From contacts
and discussions with expert and
professionals everywhere it became.
clear that to improve training
facilities, to raise professional
standards among journalist
would be one of the best ways to
improve the actual information
which daily reaches the world
public and so greatly influences
the chances of mutual under-
standing and peace.
Press I Tlstitute Phl1l11ed'
At an early stage, the plan for
the creation of an International
Institute of Press and information
was conceived. It was hoped to co-
ordinate, on an international and
non-political basis, the numerous
activities and efforts likely to
bring about gradual improvements
and letters and so to promote an
understanding between peoples. It
is predicated on the fact that
understanding and respect can
spring only from mutual know-
ledge, and that conversely there
are today vast blanks of ignorance
of the wars and achievements of
our fellow men.
Hopes of tomorrow
"Hopes of Tomorrow"is another
of the projects in preparation. This
is a radio and press series on
selected current activities in
science and other fields, which
seem to promise hope of future
solutions to basic human prob-
lems of the present.
In the field of science, for
example, the programmes would
offer a soberly presented discus-
sion of the possibilities of further
scientific advances in such
domains as the hart. messing of
atomic energy to industrial use,
the prolongation' {) f hum : m life,
treatment of mental diseases,
development of alternative sources
of energy to replace exhaustible
resources, synthetic foods and new
food processes, etc.-
For users interested in a more
general programme, the same
treatment might ba applied to
basic social and economic prob-
lems of the present day and the
possible future applications of the
fine arts to the problem of enrich-
ing home and community life.
In all fields, whether educa-
tional, scientific or cultural, the
programmes would emphasize the
need for cooperation, particularly
international cooperation, in order
to solve the problems or achieve
the advances in question.
To mention but one further of
the several projects being develop-
ed : that of the"World Books", a
radio series-to be broadcast
weekly or monthly-designed to
stimulate cultural exchanges and
the free flow of ideas by inform-
ing listeners about new, non-
specialist books in all languages
likely to further Unesco's aims in
education, science and the arts.
Such a series, as its sister-projects
will serve both in an educative
capacity and will develop under-
standing by dramatizing the
achievements of our neighbours.

TECHNICAL NEEDS COMMISSION
STUDIES FIELD REPORTS
IL EADING world personalities in press, film and radio met atUnesco house early this month to study the results of a com-
prehensive survey of the needs and deficiencies of mass com-
munication in seventeen countries and to recommend practical
measures towards their alleviation. The delegates, members of the
Techmcal Needs Commission, were continuing a vital Unesco project
begun last year to mobilize the resources of information apparatus
in the cause of peace.
Reports laid before the dele-
gates had been prepared from de-
tailed. on-the-spot research by ten
Unesco field workers who have
spent the past three months in-
vestigating the technical and pro-
fessional status of press, film and
radio across more than a quarter
of the earth's surface. A total of
more than one hundred thousand
miles'travel was covered by the
reporters who sought some two
thousand answers to their Ques-
tionnaires.
These ranged from the availa-
bility of raw materials, profes-
sional training, copyright legisla-
tion. political censorship and the
financing of news-agencies to the
supply of typesetting, broadcast-
ing and filming equipment and
the distribution and circulation
facilities for information. The
questionnaire is the most compre-
hensive ever undertaken on an
international basis.
The surveys, begun in 1947 when
Unesco field workers covered
twelve war-devastated countries,
have proved of gTeat value to
students of mass communication
and professionals throughout the
wor1d. Their douhle purpose has
been to disclose-for rhe first
time on an accurate, detailed ba-
sis-the actual position of the
instruments for informing the
people, and at the same time to
serve as a guide to governments,
international agencies and organi-
; ations engaged in meeting th
needs and deficiencies.
At the first meeting of the
Technical Needs Commission in
August 1947 thf experts found
there existed two over-riding world
shortages : trat of newsprin ; and
that of"hard urrency"for the
purchase of equipment. Having
presented to the United Nations a
detailed study of the newsprint
shortage. Unesco has recently
brought forward a test plan of
urgent voluntary aid designed to
supply some fifty thousand tons
of newsprint to France, China and
the Netherlands.
The United Nations Conference
on Freedom of Information con-
vened this spring in Geneva com-
mended Unesco for its detailed
report on the newsprint situation
and recommended that Member
States-particularly the United
States and Canada-co-operate
with Unesco in order to make its
test plan a success.
Concezning the currency prob-
lem, a project is now under pre-
paration by Unesco to arrang ? t
barter system between'hard'and
'soft-currency'nations, whereby
the former might supply necessary
funds in exchange for cultural
and professional service from the
latter.
The seventeen nations surveyed
this year by Unesco field workers,
included : Austria, Hungary and
Italy in Europe ; Cuba, the Domi-
nican Republic. Haiti* Honduras.
Mexico, Per, Uruguay and Venue-
zuela in Latin America : and
Burma, ihe Federation of Malaya,
India, Pakistan and Singapore in
the Far East.
The Technical Needs Commis-
sion, which met from August 2
through 11. was under the Chair-
manship of Jean Letourneau.
former Minister : of France, who
had been head of the French !
delegation to the UN Freedom of
Information Conference.
Following the Commission's
meetings. Unesco will publish a ;
book containing the results of the
field surveys and the recommen-
dations of the experts. A first
volume covering the first twelve
countries surveyed during 1947
proved highly successful both for
its informational value and as a
guide to reconstruction activities.
Unesco considers is surveys of
technical needs of high priority
for thev playa fundamental role
in the major task of'1lotilizing
the media of mass communication
as effective instruments for get-
ting"people to talk to people"
And only by this means, it is felt,
can peace be based on solid
foundations : those of understand-
ing and respect among all nations.
m the technique and practice of
journalism everywhere.
This idea is perhaps not very
new. But it has now given rise to
one of the most important and
interesting projects in the field
of international information.
Various expert commissions
convened by Unesco cho : : firmed
the need for such an Internatior. al
Institute of Press and In-
formation. A resolution passed by
the Unesco Commission on Tech-
nlcal Needs in Press. Radio, Film,
in August 1947, emphatically
called for its establishment and
was endorsed by the second ses-
sion of the General Conference of
Unesco in Mexico City.
In April of this year, before the
world forum of the United Nations
Conference on Freedom of In-
formation in Geneva, the plan for
creating such an International
Institute was again strongly
urged.
The project for the Inter-
national Institute of the Press
and Information was included in
the Programme of Unesco for
1948, and a provisional budget of
$23, 000 was set aside to facilitate
its creation.
Unesco has thus been active in
guiding and aiding efforts likely
to give life to this idea. A detailed
plan is now being drawn up.
setting out proposals for guiding
principles, activities and statutes
of the Institute. This plan is : 0
be submitted for discussion to the
various professional organizations
whose active and willing support
alone can bring about its realisa-
tion. Once established, the propos-
ed Institute would be an entirely
non-governmental, autonomous
body. with its own administrative
organization. Uneseo would pro-
vide a comparatively small initial
subs'. dy, but It is intended to es-
tablish the Institute on a basis of
complete financial independence.
The functions and. activities of
the proposed International Insti-
tute of the Press and Information
would be manifold but within
Unesco's general interests.
Above all the Institute's func-
ticns may be-defined as a sys-
tematic endeavour to clarify and
intensify, amongst the public ; 1S
well as professional circles, the
knowledge of the power and res-
ponsibilities of the press in mod-
ern society.
To Pool Press Experience
It would be wrong to think of
the proposed Institute as a
tribunal or somewhat remote
professional academy. It would
ac as an international centre of
active research and study on tech-nical and professional problems
covering all aspects of the vast
field of press and information.
Experienced and aspiring jour-
nalists, editors, publishers and
technicians could meet there for
discussion and common study.
The proposed Institute would be
an ideal place for the exchange
of ideas, comparison of methods
and special courses of study. It
would-6ë one great pool of inter-
national thought and experience
in the field of press and in-
formation.
With a permanent, highly-
qualified staff at its disposal, the
Institute would be a valuabie
instrument to assist existing aid
rising schools of journalism
everywhere in co-ordinating reci-
procal exchanges of information,
and in guiding all Endeavours to
raise and maintain high standards
amongst the journalistic profes-,
sion.
It would be one of the principal
tasks of the proposed Institute to
assemble such documentation and
to make it available wherever it is
needed. In addition, the Institute
would be ideally SUIted to under-
take the publication of specialist
literature and periodicals. It would
organize seminar sessions, meetings
of experts, men of science and
distinguished specialists, Mid
various courses for exchange
scholars.
Unesco has taken the initiative
in working out a plan for the
creation of an International Ins-
tutu : e of Press and Information..
It is now up to responsible and
competent quarters in all coun-
tries to help create this Institute
which is 50 clearly needed.

Exchange of Persons Programme
Vital to Mutual Understanding
By William D. CARTER
Head, Unesco Exchange of Persons Bureau
The international exchange of persons in thp.
fields 0/education, science and culture has been
recognize, since Unesco's inception. as an
porlant means 0/advancing tfte"obJectzves of
international peace and 0/the common wel/are
of mankind".
Unesco's principal concerns in the fIeld 01
international exchcmge 01 persons have been IIIP-
development of a cLearing house 0/in/ormation
on exchange activities Ihroughout the world and
the promotion of znternatlOJzul study oppor-
tUnities tor mature persons, M) particular
reference to Unesco's fields of interest.
Fellowships, study grants and scholarships
which allow travel lor their partICIpants to
foreign countries can serve as a tangible nzenns
for gelling"peoples talking to peopLes", lor t'le
inlernatiOnal sharing 0/skills and techniques
and for ralsmg profl'ssional and cultural
standards everywhere.
A serious obstacle to such a tree interchange
of persons across nationaL t/"Ontiers IS the lack
of pri ! cise and dctaiLed mtormatlOll regarding
study possibilities. There IS also the problem of
overlapping-and, more zmportant, there arE<
of/en gaps in some areas-in the various fields
Of study.
To reduce these barriers, Unesco can be espe-
cially useful. For Unesco can serve as a practical
liaison unit among fellowship sponsors, as a
world-wide clearing house fOr in/ormation- ;- ana
- as an integral eLement of the United NatIOns
framework-can take effective steps to reduce
the barriers to the international exchange oj
persons.
The following review describes some of the
work Unesco has undertaken thus far in tllis
field of activity.'
A world handbook of interna-
tional fellowships, scholarships
and study-grants will be publish-
ed by Unesco early in 1949 for
the use of government depart-
ments. voluntary organizations
and Il1dividuals concerned with
the international exchange of
persons. Detailed Information
will be included On all types of
awards vailable for persons
seeking opportunities for study.
research, observation or similar
higher educational pursuits in
foreign countries.
Data on such duty opportun-
ities as have been made available
since the e : : 1d of the war will also
be included in the handbook,
and supplements to this initial
volume will be published as addi-
tional information is received at
Unesco
It is hoped that the handbook
lIVill be of value to those charged
with oroad-scale planning and
the administration of interna-
tional exchange programmes.
Interested agencies will find a
detailea picture of the present
scope of international study and
observation programmes through-
out the world and thus a basis
for planning additional program-
mes witl be provided.
Collection and publication of
this information : 1 in one volume
will underline where programmes
are adequate and where a real
need of additional opportunities
for international fellowships
exists. In this way. interchange
of persons programmes through-
out the world will be stimulated
and it is hoped new programmes
promoted.
1 : 1 addition to its work as a
centre of information on ex-
change of persons activities,
Unesco also administers directly
a small fellowsh : p programme, in
which particular emphasis IS laid
on meeting study needs of mature
persons m the three main fields
of Unesco's interest-education.
science and culture.
There are three main types of
fellowships within Unesco's fel-
lowship operations :
Unesco Fellowships directly
financed by Unesco. which as-
sumes basic administrative and
operational responsibility, enlist-
ing the collaboration of official
and unofficial organizations in
prel1mmary screening of candi-
dates and in implementing plans
of study.
Unesco-sponsored Fellowships
donated by accredited govern-
mental or non-governmental
agencies. Unesco gives assistance
in planning, and is responsible
for the basic administration in-
cluding screening of candidates
recommended by governments for
final selection by the donor agen-
cies.
Fellowships within the Unesco
Scheme. Except for general plan-
aLng and advice by Unesco, the
general administration of these
fellowships is the basic responsi-
bility of the recipient and donor
countries for the. election of can-
didates and detailed administra-
tion.
During the past year Unesco
has been concerned with 58
"Unesco FellowshiJps"and 130
"Unesco-sponsored Fellowships."
Forty-eight of the 58"Unesco
Fellow. shlps.. which are currently
being operated, are in the follow-
ing fields of study :-
Science and Social Develop-
ment ;
Cinema and Rc.-i. o Education ;
Educational Problems of War-
Affected Children ;
Librarianship ;
Educational Administration ;
Art and Music Education.
Six fellowships-one in each
subject-were allocated in De-
cember, 1947, to e-''. i of the fol-
lowing war-devastated Member
States of Unesco : China. Czecho-
slovakia. Greece, the Netherlands.
Norway, Poland. Denmark and
the Philippiaes. A further six in
these fields have been offered to
three new Member States : Aus-
tria. Hungary and Italy.
Funds have also been provided
to enable two specialists from
China and two from India to visit
principal computiag-machine
laboratories in America and
Europe and candidates for these
awards are now being selected.

try, which will give him an op-
portunity to utilise, to the maxi-
mum. the benefits of the traini : 1g
received.
While Unesco has stressed the
promotion of exchange through
study grants for matur 2 persons,
the Secretariat"15 been concern-
ed. particularly in the collection
of information and the answering
of enquiries, with a variety of re-
lated problems.
These include such questions
as exchange programmes for pro-
fessors and teachers and the
problems arising from such ex-
changes. student and young peo-
ple's exchange, with special re-
ference to vacation study
schemes, and educational and
training opportunities for tech-
nicians and administrators. The
barriers which prevent a free
movement of persons to-'educa-
tional purposes are also under
continuous study.
Canada Offers
64 Fellowships
Educators, technicians and
scientists from some thirteen
war-devastated-"mtries will
be the recipients of sixty-
four fellowships offered by the
Canadian Council for Recons-
truction through Unesco. The
programme, to cost $182, 000,
will permit advanced study in
seven fields of activity in
Canada for six months.
Designed to help raise
standards in the fields of
science, education and the
arts in countries deprived by
the war of their facilities.
the programme is the result
of a voluntary fund-raising
campaign conducted through-
out Canada. Some seventy
private organizations partici-
pated in the nation-wide
appeal.
Countries to which the
fellowships are being offered
include : Czechoslovakia, Bel-
gium. Denmark, the Nether-
lands, Norway, Philippines,
China. France. Greece. Italy,
Luxembourg. Poland and
British colonial possessions
devastated by the war.

Another View of Unesco
(Behind the execution of Unesco's world programme, and out
of the spollfght of public attention, there is a mass of detailed,
headquarters labour without which none of the many 1Jro1 ! ! cts coul : t
be carried out. Members of any large organisation, governmental or
private, are familiar with this lIital and unpub/icized activIty. At
Unesco House, it is carried out by an internatIOnal team-the Central
Administrative Services, under the direction of GordOn Menzies. The
following article describes something of how thai team backs up the
programme departments of UnescO.)
Unesco's Central AdminL<. trative ServiceS Secl10n was f : stabl1shed
last February to co-ordinate the provision of common services to the
Programme Sections of the Organisation It is composed of six main
units-Central Registry. BuiMing Management, Languages Service,
Purchase and Stores. Documents Service and the Restaurant and
Commissary and provides a. variety of services, supplies and equip-
ment to all Sections of Unesco.
The Building Manage-
ment division maintains
Unesco House and provi-
des local transportation
services. It is largely
staffed by local techni-
cians, ranging from car-
penters and. locksmiths to
highly qualified telephone
mechanics.
Many of these French
workers knew the luxu-
rious Hotel Majestic in
its pride and saw it beco-
me first the home of a
French Ministry and then,
in 1940, the headquarters
of the German occupation
Tile once famous ballrooms
and deception rooms are used
today to house Unesco's Interna-
tional Conferences and meetings.
To service these meetings-
attended by representatives from
many nations-Unesco maintain
its own team of interpreters and
summary reporters.
The twenty-one members of
the Reproduction Unit last year
printed and assembled over
twelve and a half million pages
of documents, which were dis-
tributed to the furthermost cor-
ners of the earth through the
Unesco Distribution Unit and
Central Registry.
All documents are produced in
French and English and, this
year, to further the Organisa-
tion's programme in the Latin-
American countries, a small
Spanish translation service has
been established. It is anticipated
that, during 1949, in line whith
Unesco's growing interest in the
countries of the Middle East, an
Arabic translation service will
be added.
The Central Registry, which
receives, circulates and files all
incoming correspondance and
cables, and despatches the a-
nisation's outgoing mail, is still
in its infancy. In a recent month.
however, the unit despatched
over 7, 000 communications.
With world-wide shortages of
essential supplies, currency res-
trictions, import and export re-
gulations, the task of maintain-
ing the Organisation's stocks of
consumable items presents a d1Y-
to-day problem.
Amongst the large variety of
requests which regularly pour
into the unit, some inevitably
cause a lifting of the eyebrows.
One day, a telephone caller
laconically requested the unit
to obtain clearance through
Customs for'the Atomic train'.
This task Purchase and S ! ores
accomplished-as soon as it re-
covered its breath-but only after
ascertaining that the train was
a mode), being sent by the So-
ciety of Nuclear Scientists for  I
Unesco-sponsored exhibition.
The staff Restaurant and Com-
missary are also'a responsi-
bility of the administrative ser-
vices. An erroneous impression
often exists that scientist, wri-
ters. artists and other intellec-
tuals are singularly uninterested
in the nature of the food pro-
vided for their sustenance. In
Unesco, however, the subject 1&
a matter of great concern, and
the Restaurant experiences con-
siderable difficulty, especially in I
these days of'world food shor-
tages, in catering for the indivi-
dual, tastes and national habit
of such a varied clientele.
The diversity of functions
carried out by the Administra-
tive Services is exceeded only by
the variety of nationalities em-
ployed therein. Individuals from
twenty different countries are
daily illustrating in a practical
manner that it is indeed possible
for the nations of the world to
work together in friendly hair-l
tony.
FOUR SEMINARS
(Continued from page 1.)
The seminar on Childhood Edu-,
cation in Czechoslovakia, which
began its work on July 21 and
will close on August 25, is under
the direction of Dr. Aase G. Skard
(Norway), with Dr. M. V. Ambros
of the Czechoslovak Ministry of
Education as Executive Assistant.
Group chairmen are from the
United Kingdom, United States,
China and Switzerland.
The scope of this seminar is the
education of children between the
ages of 3 to 13.
It Is primarily concerned with
the psychological development of
the child in relation to education
for a World Society. The staff is
supplemented by the presence of
special consultants, including
Ruth Benedict tUSA>, Dr. Frances
I) g (USA). Professor André Rey
(Switzerland) and Dr. Therese
Broase of Unesco. Madame Mau-
rette, head of the International
School in Geneva, also'nay parti-
cipated in the meetings, lecturing
on the-'Development of World
Mindedness among Children".
The third seminar, in England,
opened on July 15 and will con-
tinuc through August 25, under
the direction of Dr. Karl W. Bi-
gelow of Teachers'College, Co-
lumbia University, New York.
The Programme. Assistant is
V : rgil de Maesschalck (Belgium)
and the Administrative Assistant
is JG. M. Atlcock, HMI, of the
United Kingdom
Study group chairmen include
representatives of Ecuador, Aus-
tralia, the United States and
France.
At the seminar's first meeting,
Dr. Julian Huxley addressed the
members and Dr. Clarence E.
Beeby, Assistant Director-General
of Unesco, spoke of Unesco's edu-
cational programme.
The seminar being held in
Caracas opened on August 5 and
will continue until September 8.
Under the direction of Dr. Guilt-
lermo Nannetti, former Minister
of Education of Colombia and
recently Director of the E'scMeht
Normal Superior of Bogota, this
group wiil carry out its studies
in four sections : rural and voca-
tional education, teacher-train-
ing, methods of eliminating illi-
teracy and education for peace.
Unesco contributed four travel
fellowships to permit specialists
to alter. d the Caracas meetings.
These various seminars are
neither conferences nor congres-
ses. Participants represent neith-
er a government or ministry, nor
an educational system. Th ? y

ATIONAL Commissions are the official liaison agencies created by
governments through which Unesco wins support for its pro-
gramme and secures the co-operation of organization and indi-
viduals throughout the world interested in.. advancing, through the
educational, scientific and cultural relations of the peoples of the
world, the objectives of international peace and of the common wel-
fare of mankind."
They bring together the leaders
of education, science and culture
and the representatives of the
important voluntary organiza-
tions working in Unesco's field, to
advise the governments and to
act as a link between the na-
tional community and the inter-
national community. Through
their special committees, subsi-
diary co-opnerating organization
or regional bodies they provide
the individual with a task to per-
form and an opportunity to in-
fluence national policies in edu-
cation, science and culture in the
direction of increasing under-
standing between the peoples of
the world.
On the international plane
they give the individual member
of the community through na-
tional delegations to Unesco Gen-
eral Conferences a part to play
in the formulation of new pro-
grammes and in the suggestion
of new emphases it established
programmes.
From the Final Act of
Unesco, Article VII
"1. Each Member State
shall make such arrangements
as suit its particular condi-
tions for the purpose of asso.
ciating its principal bodies
interested in e d u cational,

with the work of the Organiza-
tion, preferably by the forma-
tion of a National Commis-
sion broadly representative of
the Government and liuch
bodies.
"2. National Commissions
or national co-operating
bodies, where they exist, shall
act in an ado y capacity to
their respective delegations to
th General Conference and to
their GovernMents in matters
relating to the Organization
and shall function as agencies
of liaison in all matters of in-
terest to it.
"3. The Organization may,
on the request of a Member
State, delegate either tempo-
rarily or permanently, a mem-
ber of its Secretariat to serve
on the National Commission
of that State, in order to assist
in the development of its

mental committee acts in an ad-
visory capacity to the Govern-
ment-on matters relating to
Unesco policy and programme,
sad in Switzerland study and
consultative committees h a v e
been set up this year to prepare
for the creation of a national
commission.
The diversity of cultures and
educational systems, and differ-
ences in physical and economic
conditions in Unesco's Member
States are reflected in the mem-
bership, organization and me-
thod of appointment of their na-
tional commissions.
The National Commissions of
China and the United States
have one hundred and twenty,
and one hundred members res-
pectively. The French National
Commission has eighty mem-
bers. The Italian and Mexican
Commissions have sixty mem-
bers ; the Danish and New Zea-
1 and National Commissions
twelve and fifteen members res-
pectively. *
In both Australia and the
United Kingdom a series of Na-
tional Co-operating Bodies have
been set up to take respo : lsibiIity
for the various important bran-
ches Of Unesco's activities. The
work of these co-operating bodies
is co-ordinated bv central com-
mittees or, which the various
programme interests are repre-
sented.
Many National Commissions
including the Chinese, French
and Brazilian Commissions have
established programme commit-
tees corresponding to the major
programme divisions of Unesco.
In Brazil and the United States
the activities of the national
commissions have been expanded
to provide for regional activity.
The Brazilian Institute of Educa-
tion. Science and Culture IS set-
ting up regional bodies in each
of the twenty-one States of Bra-
zil. Representatives of these re-
gional institutes and of the cen-
tral Institute will be bought
together this year at a National
Conference.
As the world programme of
Unesco develops, the r6) e of na-
tional commissions becomes of
ever-increasing importance. There
is encouraging evidence that na-
tional commissions are not only
attempting to carry out projects
in the Unesco programme assign-
ed to them, but that they are also
developing their own program-
mes of activity to promote inter-
national understanding and cul-
tural interchange.
The Danish National Commis-
sion, for example, discussed at
its April meeting a scheme for
the establishment of interna-
tional seminars for teachers and
youth leaders at Elsinore.
The French National Commis-
sion has planned a series of
broadcasts designed to promote
international understanding and
to develop appreciation of the
cultural and artistic achievements
of other countries.
Many National Commissions
have active publication policies,
The United State., National
Commission News,"-the monthly
journal of the Commission, pub-
lished its twelth number on July
1, 1948."Unesco,"the monthly
journal of the Austrian United
Nations Association published its
seventh number in July, 1948.
The United States"National
Commission News"has a very
wide national circulation and an
increasing circulation abroad.
The Austrian pUblication"Unesco"
has a circulation of 5, 000 and it
in distributed free to schools, uni-
versities and learned institutions
in Austria.
The pamphlet"Unesco-in the
minds of men"was published in
Australia in response to a nation-
wide demand for information
about Unesco.
Wherever Unesco's message is
known, people are askin :"What
can I do to serve Unesco ?"Na-
tional Commissions are en-
deavouring to develop program-
mes of activity which will give
the individual citizen and the na-
tional organizations a part to
play in building"the defences of
peace."
The sustained and active sup-
port of the peoples of the world,
and their full participation in
the programme of the Organiza-
tion, are essential for the achieve-
ment of Unesco's purpose.

lrHE philippine Nalional Commission on Educational, Scipnti'jc.H and Cultural Makers was formally organized in January 01 ti11s
year at Malacanan Palace by the late Mr. Manuel Roxas.
President of the Philippines. Its functions were outlined as
follows : to act in an advisory capacity to the Government on Unesco
affairs, to function as a liaison agency between the Government and
Unesco, and to study and report on such educational, scientific and
cultural matters as may from time to time be submitted to its con-
sideration by the President of the Republic.
The Commission has fifteen
members and is divided into four
committees, Executive, Educa-
tional, Scientific and Cultural.
There is a full-time Chairman
and an Executive Secretary. Ad-
ministratively, it is under the
Office of the President.
The Government-owned house
at 3336 Taft Avenue, Risal City-.
a new city south of the capitaj,
Manila-serves as its headquar-
ters. Here, there is a newly-
equipped office for the use of
visiting Unesco representatives,
and a small library open to the
public.
In the Philippines there has
been a considerable interest in
the work of Unesco. RetUrning
delegates from the first two Unes-
co annual sessions received many
invitations to speak on Unesco
from civic organization and
schools. The press. libraries and
professional groups have shown a
continuing interest in the organ-
ization's activities.
Some of the activities which the
National Commission has carried
out to make the work or Unesco
effective within the Philippines
during the first five months of
the Commission's existence might
be described as follows :
The preparation of a national
bibliography by the Bureau of
Public Libraries.
Very successful cooperation
with the United Nations Appeal
for Children in the Children'*
Emergency Fund Campaign.
Collection of data for Unesco's
BOOK OF NEEDS. Volume II.
Selection of candidates for the
six Unesco Fellowships allocated
to the Philippines.
Distribution of books donated
through Unesco by the encyclo-
paedia Britannica, Allied Books
Centre of London and the Liver..
pool City Libraries.
Assistance rendered the Unesco
field worker who surveyed Philip-
U. S. A.-5 Regional Meetings
im-HE active sponsorship of re-t gional activities by theUnited States National
Commission and the delegation of
programme activities to existing
national organizations and spe-
cial panels of experts, created to
undertake Unesco projects, has
given responsible citizens in the
United States a practical role in
the task of"building the defen-
ces of peace."
Since the end of July, 1946, the
U. S. National Commission has
held four meetings and its Exe-
cutive Committee has met seven
times. Commission meetings have
been held in Washington (Sep-
tember, 1946), Philadelphia (Feb-
ruary, 1947), Chicago (September,
1947) and in Washington'Feb-
ruary, 1948). A fifth meeting
will be held in Boston from Sep-
tember 27 to 29, 1948.
Three of the five meetings of
the Commission will thus have
been held away from headquar-
ters in Washington. The result-
ing stimulation of interest in
Unesco's programme and purpose
and the creation of public sup-
port for the organization can
hardly be overestimated.
Similarly, National and Re-
gional Conferen have been
successful in bringing a know-
ledge of the objectives and work
of Unesco to citizens in all walks
of life in the United States.
The first National Conference
was held in Philadelphia, in
March, 1947 ; the next is planned
for 3, 4, 5 March, 1949, in Cleve-
land.
In Philadelphia, the National
Conference was attended by dele-
gates from more than 500 na-
tional groups, and fourteen sub-
commissions studied the different
branches of Unesco's programme.
In Denver, three m''th later,
there was held the Mountain.
Plains Regional Conference. Near-
ly two thousand representatives
of organizations in eight sur-
rounding states sent delegates to
develop concrete plans whereby
the people could best serve the
objectives of Unesco.
Delegates p. proposed the forma-
tion of state councils of organiza-
tions and individuals interested
in the aims and activities of
Unesco. The major purpose of
such councils Is to provide a
means of stimulating interest and
coordinating activities within a
state.
Over three thousand people
from seven states and the Terri-
tories of Alaska and Hawaii at-
tended the second Regional
Unesco Conference in San Fran-
cisco, May 13-15, 1948.
Section meetmgs on the various
aspects of Unesco's world pro-
gramme provided opportunity for
vigorous group discussions. No
prepared speeches were made at
the meetings-attended by fifty
to one hundred persons-and the
debates proceeded at an unusual-
ly rapid pace. The outstand-
ing success of this regional con-
ference was due in very large
measure to careful pre-conferences
planning, strong community sup-
port and the intelligent leader-
ship and enthusiasm oaf"0 Con-
vening Committee and those as-
sociated with it.
A State Coordinating Council
for Unesco has been set. up in
Washington, under the chair-
manship of Mrs. Pearl A
Wannamaker, State Superinten-
dent of Public Instruction, Olym-
pia, Washington.
This is the first such regional
council, and it is felt th ;" the de-
velopment of similar groups
would fill a useful function as
clearing houses of information
en Unesco aid that they might
service state and local councils
in a given area.
The United States National
Commission is carefully review-
ing the role of regional, state and
local councils. :'or their success-
ful operation it is essential that
there should be practical tasks

8 UNESCO COURIER Vol. I.-No 7.
Distinguished World Thinkers
Study Bases of Human Rights
One of the most important and least-
publicized Unesco projects during the past
months has been the compilation of a world-
wide symposium of the philosophic bases of
Human Rights. Such an undertaking-in a
world distraught with such fearsome problems
as the hunger of millions and the clash of
ideologies-may appear an academic one. Yet
it is being carried out at a particularly timely
moment. It is being undertaken following his-
tory's most terrible conflict-a conflict by the
peoples of the world against the denial of
Human Rights. It is being ; attempted at a
moment when, after such a strugg : e, men and
women everywhere are examining the question
of what are the rights of humanity'.
In the following article,. Jacques Havet, mem-
ber of the Philosophy and Humanitie. 3 Division
of Unesco-who was instrumental in prepaying
and implementing the symposium-describes
something of the project which is now nearing
fruition.
I T was at the first session ofthe General Conference that
an enquiry into the origins
and philosophic bases of Human
Rights. ways incorporated into the
programme of Unesco. Then,
little over a year after the end
of the war, such a project was
particularly timely for a world
......... J J.....had develop-
ed towards this question.
Our whole social structure
had been shaken by the
repercussicns of total war.
People everywhere sought
a common denominator to
the problem of fundamen-
tal Human Rights.
Sporadically throughout
hisory there have been
affirmations of these
rights. The American De-
claration of Independance
in 177H, the Declaration
of the Rights of Man by
the French National As-
sembly in 1789 and the
Declaration of Rights of
the Toiling and Exploited
Peoples, adopted by the
All-Russian Congress of
Soviets in 1918 are but
three striking examples of
such pronouncemen. s.
A worM-wide declara-
tion, however. had never
been. undertaken. Such a
formulation would have to
reconcile the various diver
gent or opposing points
of view. It. would' have
also to be sufficienlly
definite to have real signi-
ficance both as an inspira-
tion and as a guide to
pra8tice but also suffi-
ciently general and flexible
to apply to all men,
and to be capable f
modification to suit peoples
at different stages of social
and political development
while yet retaining signi-
ficance for them and their
aspirations.
At the first session of
Unesco's General Conte-
rence in November, 1947.
it was decide'. to ask phi-
losophers and thinkers
throughout the world what
they thought about Hu-
man Rights, their develop-
ment during the last cen-
tury and what they
thought were the forces
threatening those rights.
Delegates to the con-
ference realized that such
a project would have to
'be in relation to the work
of the Human Rights Cam.
mission of the United Na-
tions, and that coordina-
tion would be necessary.
The Human Rights Com-
mission was at that time
preparing one of the most
significant projects of so-
cial history : the drafting
of a universal bill of
Human Rights. At the
meeting of the UN Economic
and Social Council in January.
1947, Unesco representatives
made it clear that the Specialized
Agel1 { : Y wanted to assist in the
project. Such assistance, it was
agreed, could best be made oxy
conducting aji international en-
quiry among thinkers, social
scientists and philosophers to
find areas of agreement on : he
question, and to present the
resulting symposium to the Hu-
man Rights Commission for
study in preparing the Bill of
Human Rights.
Thus Une3Co determined two
purposes for its enquiry : that of
presenting a statement to the
Human Rights Commission, and
that of prepa. ring the materials
for publication to the general
public.
A memorandum which inclu-
ded a ques1Jionawe was there-
fore prepared by a special com-
mittee and despatched to phi-

Some Extracts
From the Replies
From Jacques Maritain, distinguished phi-
losopher and French. Ambassador to the Hoiy
See :
"... No declaration of the rights of man
can ever be exhausiir ; e and final. It must
always be expressed in terms or the state
of the moral conscience and oJ civilization
ac any given moment of history. And it is
jus :. for this reason that, since the eons !-
derable success achieved at the end 01 the
eighteenth century by the first written
declarations, it has always been a matter
of major interest for men to renew these
àeclarations from age to age..."
From th late l\lahatma K. Gandhi, Father
of India's Independence :
H... 1 learned from my illiterate but wise
mcther that all Tights to be deserved ana
preserved came from duty well done. Thus
the 1 ; ery right to live accrues to us only
wilen we do ihe duty oJ citizenship oJ the
world. From this one fundamental staument,
perhaps it io ! easy enough to define he
duties of Man and Woman and to correlate
every right to some corresponding duty to
be first performed. Every other right can
be shown to be a usurpation hardly worth
jighting for,"
From Aldous Huxley. distinguished British
writer and philosopher :
"... The increa3ing preS3ure of population
upon resources and the wagings, threat oj,
and unremitting preparation Jor total war
--thcsc are, at the present time. the most
formidable enemies to liberty... Heavy
pressure Of population upon resources

have to work harder and longer to earn a
poorer living. At the same time, the eco.
nomic ; situ. atzoTL 01 the community as a
whole is so precarious that small mishaps
- such as untoward weather conditions-
may rer, ult in serious breakdowns. There
can be tittle or no personal liberty in the
midst of social chaos ; and where sociai
chaos is reduced to order by the intervention
of a powerful centralized executive, there is
a grave risk of totalitarianism..."
From Professor Harold J. Laski, prominent
politica !. scientist, of the University 01
London :
"... To vroviàe the approphate inspiration.
such a Declaration (of the Rights of Man)
would have to be both bold in its general
character and concrete in its detailed account.
Ii would have to take account rather or the
possibilities which are struggling to be born
than of the traditions that are dying be-
fore our eyes. It would be better to have no
Decfaration than one that was half-hearted
and lacking in precision, or one which
sought an uneasy compromise between irre-
concilable principles 01 social action..."
From Quincy Wright, noted American
scholar of international law and Professor
at the University of Chicago :
"human rights suggest rights whic7t are
alike lor all human beings. Yet it is recogn-
ized that much of human nature is a
product OJ the particular culture in which
the individual has developed. Consequently.
i/al1 men have something in common which
might provide the basis for a universal bill
af human rights, it must reside either in
common biological, psychological or spiritual
charact. eritics which persist in spite oj
cultural differences, or in those common
elements of the many cultures which may
be regarded as a world culture..."
losophers, scientists and political
figures throughout the world.
This was carried both through
National Commissions and di-
rectly to the individuals approa-
ched.
Nearly seventy replies were
received, ranging from very
brief replies to lengthy studies
of the question but averag-
ing bet, ween two and four
thousand word each,
These represented nearly
all the world's national
groups and nearly all
ideological approaches.
A Unesco committee of
experts met in July, 1947
to study the replies. The
committee was made up
of persons representing a
wide range of opinions
and :, j fai : hs. It drafted
slatemems on the philoso-
phic bases of Human
Rights, emphasizing the
consideration of historical
changes, and trying-in a
dynamic perspective-to
show to what extent
seemingly widely-opposed.
conceptions aimed at com
mon future ideals.
These statements were
sent to the Human Rights
Commission which consi-
dered them at its meeting
in Geneva in December
of last year.'
At the same time,.
Unesco re-convened its ex-I
perls'panel in, Decelllber
and again in July, 1948
to prepare the publication
of a symposium of the.
relies. These were care-
fully studied, and from
the hundreds of thousands
of words in the compiled
statements, a manuscript
of about one hundred
thousand. words was pre-
pared for publication.
Among the authors, let ups,
mention : I
Harold Laskt, Jacques
Maritain, Benedetto Croce.
E. H. Carr, Salvador de
Madariaga, Aldous Huxley,
Ricl1ard McKeon, Quincy
Wright, F. S. C. Northrop,
and Humayun Kabir.
Jacques Maritain is at
present writing an intro-
duction for the whole
symposium.
The book will be pub-
lished this year in English,
French and Spanish, and
- it is hoped-it will later
be published in other lan-
guages. One may expect
that such a compilation of
different views of Human
Rights will arouse a great
interest among the public
and help the creation
of a better understanding
belween men of different
cultures.

World Music Catalogue
c
to List Best Reproductions
II N the belief that music, as a basic and universal form of humanexpression, can make a substantial contribution to international
understanding. Unesco's Division of Arts & Letters is developing
a project for a world catalogue of recorded music. Such a catalogue,
which is intended to be produced in sections, should be of great
service to educational institutions, professional musicians as well
as to the general public.
The project had its beginnings
at the first session of the Gener-
al Conference, wheu the Direc-
tor-General was instructed to
"survey the techniques and me-
thods of reproduction in music..."
The subsequent report sub-
mitted by the Secretariat showed
that the techniques of music
reproduction had been highly
developed and that the assis-
tance of Unesco was needed not
so much in stimulating improv-
ed techniques but rather in mak-
ing recordings of good music
more readily available to the
peoples of the world.
The second session of the Ge-
neral Conference therefore in-
structed the Director-General :
"To prepare a catalogue of
world music, listing music which
is already available in recorded
form and music which should be
recorded to supplement existing
material..."
Nearly twenty years ago, the
Institute of Intellectual Cooper-
ation of the League of Nations
recognized the recording of music
as a great contribution of inven-
And now Unesco has taken up
the idea where the Institute left
off. A committee of experts met

1948) to work out methods to be

ledge, records are regarded as of
incontestable value.
tion for the proposed world ca-
talogue. The committee was
composed of prominent authori-
ties in the music world from the
Netherlands, France, the United
Kingdom, Switzerland and the
United States.
A world catalogue of recorded
music cannot be confined to the
works available at any given
, period, hgwever. Nor can it be
compiled over-night. It must, in
fact, be a continuing activity,
since records are constantly
being produced. It will be ne-
cessary to revise and to sup-
plement the catalogue at regular
intervals.
The committee recommended
that a central index of all exist-
ing records be prepared. To this
index will be added information
about every new recording. From
it will be taken necessary in-
formation for specialized cata-
logues of particular types of
music.
The experts recommended that
Unesco pay particular attention
to folk-music and the music of
the East as well as to serious
Western music. In the prepara-
tion of the proposed catalogue,
the cooperation of Unesco Na-
tional Commissions and interna-
tional musical-organizations,
musicologists and other experts
will be sought.
The committee also pointed out
to Unesco that the free flow of
recorded music was being serious-
ly hampered by existing cartel ar-
rangements between certain com-
mercial producers.
PRESS REVIEW
Haugesunds Avis (Haugesunds,
Norway, July 9, 1948) on the con-
ference of Directors of Children's
Villages at Trogen, Switzerland :
"The Children's'Village Confe'
rence is ? : o aoMbt one of the
most successful projects yet
undertaken by Unesco. The
children's community at Trogen,
where the conference was held,
has young people from many
countries wh are learning to be
international citizens at the
same time without lOsing their
national identity."
L'Osservatore Romano (Vati-
can City, July 19, 1948), on the
Institute of the Hylean Amazon :
