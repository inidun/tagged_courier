### 87190: Interview with Leopoldo Zea

N W
Leopoldo
Zea
In a rapidly changing world, is there still room for
philosophical reflection?
The historic pattern which came into being at the end
of the Second World War was broken in 1989. The extraor¬
dinary changes which have taken place in Europe in recent
months mark the end of the post-war era. We are now
entering a period of intensive reflection, one in which
Europe is being rebuilt and is seeking new structures, while
other regions such as Latin America, Asia and Africa are
having to envisage new relationships and new forms of
integration with the rest of the world. More than ever
philosophy must help shape our thinking about this uni¬
fied world which is emerging from a divided world.
Many people think philosophy is useless and superfluous,
and would even eliminate itfrom the educational syllabus.
Philosophy has always tried to come to terms with reality.
From Plato who sought to solve the problems of the Greek
city-state, to St. Augustine who reflected on the relations
between Christians and pagans, Kant who meditated on the
situation of the individual in the modern world, and Hegel
who wrote history in the light of the French Revolution,
philosophy has always responded to the problems of a given
time and place. It provides a possible answer to the ques¬
tions people ask themselves. Without these questions it
would have no purpose.
Could there he such a thing as a universal philosophyf
The essence of philosophical thinking rests on the double
principle of the logos: reason and the word. To reason is to
apprehend the external world with a view to understanding
it, while the word makes it possible to communicate these
perceptions to others. It provides the capacity to understand
and to make oneself understood through communication
in order to expand and extend dialogue. This movement is

the starting point for any talk of universality, for
philosophical truths are not immediately universal. They
only become so to the extent that they are accessible to
others. The universality of philosophy depends on the
capacity of some to communicate and of others to
understand.
In 1986, the World Congress of Philosophy held at
Montreal (Canada), reached the conclusion that the univer¬
sality of philosophy depended on the capacity of human
beings to make reason an instrument for communication,
dialogue and the exchange of experience. It was also said
that there was no universal philosophy but only specific
philosophies which become universal to the extent that they
are understood by others and make it possible to understand
others.



If there is talk nowadays of a truly universal philosophy,
The Mexican thinker Leopoldo Zea
has developed a philosophy of history rooted
in the Latin American experience but also
firmly linked to major movements in world
philosophy. Here he sets forth his ideas
on the role philosophy can play in the current
world situation.
this is not because the nature of philosophy has changed
but because for the first time in the history of humanity
problems have become universal. Since some problems affect
all human beings in the same way, transcending their differ¬
ences and the specificity of their experience, the responses
of philosophy acquire universal relevance. But this is always
a universality which takes reality as the starting point
of an attempt to solve the problems of people in given
situations.
What are the priorities of such universalist yet specific
thinking?
The first thing is to define modes of behaviour and of
participation in a changing world. The planetary range of
problems raises the question of the behaviour of peoples and
nations, as well as that of individuals. We do not accept that
othersblocs, governments, ideologiestake our decisions
for us. This presupposes that we assume a large share of
responsibility for what is done and that we choose new
forms of participation. Instead of vertical relationships of
domination and thus of dependence, there should be
horizontal links of solidarity. Individuals, minorities, a var¬
iety of cultural entities, increasingly wish for participation.
Everyone wants to participate in the redefinition of the
world that is emerging, one in which it will not be enough
to speak, as today, of a "common European home". We
know now that we live in one world, that our planet is for
the first time truly universal. It is the common home of
humanity that we should be thinking about.
In this universalist context, is philosophy as a discipline
taking new directions?
In many countries the tide is turning against the idea that
the instrument of philosophylogicshould actually be its
purpose. It is now accepted that logic is only a means of

knowing with a view to acting. The more refined this
instrumental logic becomes, the better. But the essential
thing is to achieve knowledge of reality in order to change
it. This is the crux of the matter. Logic should never be con¬
sidered as in itself the goal of philosophy.
It is thus possible to talk of a return to the original preoc¬
cupations of philosophy: how to know reality and act on
it. The Greek philosophers never troubled to find out
whether their philosophy was universal. And yet it was
universal to the extent that it produced answers which
proved to be valid for others, in analogous circumstances.
This new philosophical "realism" clearly responds to ethical
preoccupations. How can ethics and pragmatism he
reconciled?
Many philosophers have abandoned the neutral analysis
of moral language and are dissatisfied with the abstract con¬
structions which a number of their contemporaries have
tried to make. What matters now, as I have said, are the
specific problems of human beings. Philosophers have a role
to play in criticizing the myths of contemporary society,
identifying ethical problems, defining fundamental prin¬
ciples, and reframing essential questions in the current
context.
Ethical reflection has a bearing on the problems of man
and society. Philosophers are concerned with medical ethics,
nuclear dissuasion, democracy and economic justice. In a
democratic society, moral thinking should be shared as
widely as possible. In view of the growing interdependence
of the world today, a kind of ethical consensus must be
established between all peoples who must share a common
planetary destiny.

### 87190: Interview with Leopoldo Zea

Is it possible to speak of an ethico-philosophical concern
for the environment?
According to the historian Arnold Toynbee, the West
has always considered people, like plants and animals, as
objects for exploitation. This approach can be seen in the
attitude of the developed countries, which want to impose
their ecological rules on the Third World without regard
for the interests of those who live there. There is an attempt
to halt the destruction of nature by using the same authority
that once encouraged this destructionwithout showing
concern for the human beings who are thereby condemned
to underdevelopment in the name of the safeguarding of the
environment. Only an ethical consensus can permit a re¬
adjustment which will not condemn certain peoples to
irremediable poverty. Philosophy can contribute to this
universal readjustment and thereby help pave the way for
an agreement about the sharing of acquired wealth.
Is it possible to think of applied philosophy as we think
of applied science?
Philosophy is oriented towards actionMarx was not
alone in adumbrating this. Thinking is important, but so
is acting in conformity with what one thinks. Philosophy
is not an exercise in abstraction which stops at words, for
if I have a problem and think about it, it is in order to solve
that problem and that means taking action. Moreover, the
very fact of thinking presupposes that one has the capacity
to direct action.
In Latin America there is a long philosophical tradition
of concern for the problems of the region. As early as 1842,
in Montevideo (Uruguay), the Argentine thinker Juan Bau¬
tista Alberdi envisaged a specifically American enterprise
of philosophical reflection rooted in the "necessities" of the
continent. "What problems is America called upon to ask
itself and to solve at this moment?" he asked. The answer
was the problems of freedom, fundamental rights, and the
social and political order. Philosophy should thus be "syn¬
thetic and organic in its method, positive and realistic in
its action, republican in its spirit and purpose". This prac¬
tical knowledge presupposed a certain degree of participa¬
tion in social and political life on the part of the philosopher.
"It is the duty of every decent man," Alberdi concluded,
"who, through his condition or his capacity, can exercise
any influence whatsoever, to be involved in the affairs of
his country."
Does this mean that philosophy should be more "opera¬
tional" in developing countries?
Our peoples have enormous problems to solveproblems
of identity and dependence. Philosophy is a unique tool with
which to approach these problems and try to solve them.
But we should not only use our own criteria to define them.
We must be open to the rest of the world.
In this sense, the dialogue between North and South
must be kept going in order to define what we call "the
ethics of development". Treatment of the ethical questions
raised by development has become indispensable.
Did you have this in mind in the thoughts on universal
history set forth in your recent book Discurso desde la
marginación y la barbarie ("Discourse on Marginality and
Barbarity")?
Greater knowledge of other world regions can help us
to become aware of the state of dependence in which we
live, to understand what constitutes our "originality", and
our situation in relation to others. If we began by imitating
foreign models, it was to "instrumentalize" European
philosophy and to make it serve our needs. We did this
deliberately. It would have been absurd to deny that Western
culture has created conceptual tools that can be applied to
our situation. We have also assimilated the dialectical dimen¬
sion of the past, accepting the good and the bad in our his¬
tory, keeping what we considered to be valuable and
modifying what in our eyes was not. I think that one of
the responsibilities of Latin American philosophers is to
translate and adapt to our own situation what comes t- us
from elsewhere and can nevertheless be useful to us.
However, Latin America has obstinately closed its eyes
to the reality of its own situation, and has even rejected its
indigenous or Iberian past, which it has affected to ignore on

## [Page 8](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087205engo.pdf#page=8) 0

### 87190: Interview with Leopoldo Zea

the grounds that it is inappropriate and alien. But to ignore
one's history is to deprive oneself of an experience without
which it is impossible to achieve maturity, responsibility.
Even so, Latin American thought has not restricted itself
to the problems of the region; it has contributed to a spe¬
cifically American philosophy, to a perception of reality and
world problems from an American standpoint. Discurso desde
la marginación y la barbarie is intended to be a book about
the philosophy of history written from a perspective which
is not European or "Eurocentrist".
Why should philosophy not give itself a "centre of
awareness" other than Europe? This is what I have done,
interpreting, not the history of America alone, but also that
of the non-American peoples. I deliberately chose European
peoples on the sidelines of history, "barbarians" according
to the classic notion, such as Spain and Portugal at the
western extremity of Europe, and Russia at the other end.
It is interesting to see how these historically marginal peoples
are today playing an important role in the recomposition
of the world.
In this unified and interdependent world we can also see
an awakening ofparticularism, a demandfor national iden¬
tities that have been repressed, and a growing number of
ethnic rivalries.
It is clear that the conquest of freedom carries risks and
should be subjected to methodical questioning. How far can
freedom go? The world must avoid atomization, the "tribali-
zation" to which nationalism or exacerbated regionalism
may lead. If we encourage forms of behaviour and modes
of participation based on respect for others to the extent
that others respect us, it is possible to imagine the coming
of a kind of world federation in which relations would be
horizontal, interdependent, in which there would be a
common effort to find a solution to common problems. If
I understand my neighbour and how he differs from me,
and if he does likewise, then we can discuss, collaborate, and
reach agreement without losing an identity which we could
never reject, and build this "common home of man" in
which we are condemned to live together.
Furthermore, in America we possess an experience
which we can offer to the world: an aptitude for ethnic and
cultural intermingling (mestizaje). The Spanish bequeathed
to us an extraordinary sense of the conviviality between
peoples, religions and cultures, but it is America itselfwhich
has been the great melting pot. This "cosmic race", on whose
behalf the Mexican writer José Vasconcelos (1882-1959)
spoke out, bears a message of integration and intermingling
which xénophobes and nationalists of all origins would do
well to ponder. Philosophy has a clear and precise task to
perform, to avoid the creation of impermeable blocs, self-
sufficient and self-satisfied, in the new spaces of freedom.
If one wall has fallenthe Berlin wall which prevented
some people from getting outlet's make sure that new walls
are not built to prevent others from getting in-the customs
barriers which developed countries raise in defence of their
well-being.
How does the resurgence ofreligious feelingsfit into a world
which should be striving towards the "ethical consensus"
you advocate?
Religion, to the extent that it helps me to understand
others, and others to understand me, can give an important
spiritual dimension to the philosopher's task. What should
be rejected is the religion that locks you in the closed world
of a given faith, without concession or tolerance towards
other beliefs, a faith which leads to religious conflicts, to
those "holy wars" from which the history of humanity
seemed to have found deliverance.
Just as philosophy sometimes turns to ideology and acts
as a brake on thought, we must avoid the obstacle that reli¬
gious intransigence may constitute. The key word is toler¬
ance. The differences of others must be respected so that
they will give respect in return.
In a world which is tending to become one, and in which

problems are global, it is important to be able to reaffirm
our differences, what distinguishes us from one another,
while respecting difference, what is not "equal" to us. We
should not forget that equality, not to say egalitarianism,
can also become a means of domination. The important
thing today is to be able to be "different" in equality, for
everyone to be equal while being different.
How do you see freedom in this context?
Freedom is a value which can only exist in relation to
specific individuals. Otherwise it becomes an abstraction,
and it is worth recalling that freedom does not exist in the
abstract. It would be impossible to defend the idea of
freedom as an absolute, that is, ultimately, an irresponsible
freedom. We must fight for freedom, but a responsible
freedom, aware of its limits.
The free man must be responsible. Man does not have
a right to be free but the duty to be so; that is to be respon¬
sible. The exercise of freedom implies a responsibility which
is situated on the level of a moral obligation. Freedom is
a commitment. I am free but I also have a commitment to
the freedom of others.
This complex relationship between commitment, responsi¬
bility and freedom, which is a recurrent theme of your
philosophical work, is based on the reciprocal relationship
between man and society. Is there not a great temptation
to propose "models" offreedom to regulate these relations?
It would be impossible to talk of models in this context,
since there can be neither models nor archetypes of freedom.
Models eventually impose new subordinations. To accept
a model is to accept a constraint.

THE SACRED
BY JUAN PLAZAOLA ARTOLA

## [Page 11](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087205engo.pdf#page=11) 0

### 87191: The Sacred

A HE two essential characteristics of the sacred
are separation and inviolability. The sacred is
regarded as separate because it is inviolable. When
it is touched, it is profaned.
The sacred is a force which can be beneficial



or malign. By virtue of the superhuman powers
vested in it, it may in some circumstances cause
dire peril, and even resemble a malediction. Essen¬
tially, however, it is a creative, fertile, fortifying
element which has the virtue of consecrating all
that comes near to it. It is not only a value superior
to others: it is invested with plenitude and dig¬
nity. Like everything divine and transcendent, it
can only be apprehended by way of analogy. The
sacred shines with an absolute glory which dims
all other values and shows up their obscurity and
inadequaciesin a word, their profanity.
Direct perception of the sacred is impossible
except in the mystery of faith, but people feel it
as a tangible presence and experience its
manifestations in their lives. To apprehend the
sacred, we must call on the concept of mystery.
In the presence of the sacred, people are emo¬
tionally torn between fascination and panic,
ecstasy and terror, as the German theologian
Rudolf Otto (1860-1937) described in his classic
work The Idea ofthe Holy. The divine is "totally
other", a mystery that simultaneously attracts
and terrifies. Its proximity awakens a feeling of
dread quite unlike the reaction caused by
"natural" dangers, a "terrified stupor" before that
which has nothing in common with what we are.
This dreadful mystery is also fascinating; it exer¬
cises an irresistible attraction. All creatures
tremble before it and feel the need to merge with
it. They are moved by a force of attraction of a
different order from that exercised on us by the
blandishments and beauties of the world. These

ambivalent feelings, combined with an impres¬
sion of absolute otherness, constitute the sense
of the sacred.
In ancient religions, separation and inviola¬



bility are expressed by prohibitions and taboos
which surround and protect all that is sacred. The
monotheistic religions later superimposed on these
two notions various subtleties of meaning which
have left their mark on art and architecture.
As far as Judaism is concerned, the Old Testa¬
ment nowhere proposes a theory of the sacred.
In the Bible everything related to Yahweh, the
God of Israel, and His worship is sacred. Some
texts emphasize the terrible aspect of the figure
of the Eternal, but the image of a God of love and
mercy gradually takes shape in the Prophets. This
God is still remote and inaccessible, and the
chosen people must be purified to have access to
Him.
Islam also imposes prohibitions, and decrees
that the places consecrated by the presence of
God and His manifestations are haram (inviol¬
able). The Ka'aba, the territory of Mecca and
Medina, the rock of Jerusalem and the tomb of
Abraham in the valley of the Hebron are for¬
bidden to infidels and only accessible to Muslims
purified by the faith and ablutions.
In Christianity, terror in face of the ineffable
is replaced by the mystery of charity: "God is
love". And since the Word was made flesh,
people can no longer believe that God is radically
different from themselves. What the Christian
sense of the sacred isolates it lifts up to God,
ennobles, and invests with a supreme significance.

## [Page 13](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087205engo.pdf#page=13) 0

### 87191: The Sacred

The sacred in Christianity implies communion
rather than prohibition.
A distinction is usually made between religious
and sacred art. A decorative or iconographie work
of art (a painting or a sculpture) may be called
religious but does not merit the epithet sacred if it
only expresses the personal feelings of the artist.
However, since places of worship usually have a
collective vocation and are dedicated to the
celebration of the mysteries, all or almost all
religious buildings can be classified as sacred
architecture.
The purpose of sacred architecture is to evoke
a mystery and to facilitate the various forms of
community worship which are related to it.
Because the sense of the sacred and the rituals
through which it is celebrated differ from one
religion to another, sacred architecture a syn¬
thesis of expressive and functional formsalso
differs.



The Temple in Jerusalem might be consi¬
dered the only example of truly sacred architec¬
ture in Judaism. In it the worship of Yahweh was
strictly regulated and hierarchized, together with
all the mysteries and prohibitions relating to the
sacred. The synagogue was originally only a place
where believers met to pray, read, and listen to
sermons, but it eventually came to be considered
as sacred, especially after the destruction of the
Temple.
The simplicity of Islamic worship, based on
a belief in the absolute transcendence of Allah,
led to a kind of architecture whose functions can
easily be adapted to pre-existing or traditional
forms. Basically, the mosque is a wall (qibla) with
a mihrab, a niche facing in the direction of Mecca,
around which a wide variety of architectural fea¬
tures can be disposed. This explains the extraor¬
dinary diversity of mosque architecture in the
different Islamic countries.
For the first Christians, the only necessary
expression of the sacred was in the ceremony that
Christ expressly enjoined them to celebrate, the
sacrament of the Eucharist, for which no temple
or specifically defined space were required. The
home of any believer could be used for "the
breaking of bread". Gradually the largest of these
dwellings came to be used for gatherings of the
faithful. Christians rejected the term temple as
too closely associated with pagan cults and gave
the name ekklesia, the Greek word meaning
assembly, to the building that was used for this
kind of meeting.
Although Christian churches are quite
different from pagan temples or the Temple of
the Jews, they have much in common with syn¬
agogues, starting with the original meaning of a
place for assembly. But whereas the God of the
Old Testament had given precise instructions for
the way in which the Temple and the Ark of the
Covenant were to be constructed, Christ's
teaching contains nothing of the kind. Christ
simply said: "where two or three are gathered
together in my name, I am with them", and "Do
this in remembrance of me". Christian worship
is encapsulated in these two phrases: a meeting
is held in commemoration. Everything else is
ancillary.

Precincts of eternity
BY JEAN-CLAUDE GOLVIN
'1PYMY* Y-^iill % I
A HE sites of Pharaonic temples were chosen in
accordance with a tradition whose origins are
sometimes lost in the mists of time. The great
temple of Amon-Re at Karnak, for instance,
marked the spot where the first mound emerged
from the waters of noun (the primordial ocean),
a pointed knoll which the god Amon caused to
rise at the beginning of the world and around
which he continued to shape his creation. The
very name of the god {Imm, Amon) means "the
hidden one", in other words, he who might
assume any shape or size and who was present
in the inmost depths of all creatures and all the
material world.
The Egyptians thought, however, that the
forces of evil, over which the god alone could tri¬
umph, could not be defeated once and for all. It
was therefore vital to encourage Amon to fight
them constantly and regularly to perform anew
his act of creation. Such was the underlying sig¬
nificance of the devotions offered to him in all
the temples. Through suitable offerings, made at
the proper times and under ritual conditions laid
down in detail, an attempt was made to keep the
god in the frame of mind needed to ensure that
the universe remained in a state of balance.
A tiny part of the divine substance was con¬
centrated in a small gold statuette barely more
than a cubit high (52 cm), placed in a kind of
monolithic granite shrine (the naos) capped by
a pyramidal form and provided with wooden
shutters which could be opened. The Egyptian
temple was not a place of worship where
large numbers of the faithful could gather, but
god's home on Earth, a dark and mysterious
dwelling accessible only to officiating priests and
to the first among them, the Pharaoh, who
enjoyed the rare privilege of being able to gaze
upon the god's face.
The most important part of the temple,
where the tremendous energy needed to uphold
creation (the divine statuette) was stored, was also,
paradoxically, the smallest part. The successive
monumental encasements in which it was set
were intended to protect it from any aggression
or harmful influence. The statuette and the naos,
which served as the first encasement, were located
in a small dark chamber, the sanctuary. They
were flanked by the private apartments of the god
which possessed all the attributes of a sumptuous
palace and where he lived and reigned like an
earthly king. The only function of the priests was
to be his faithful servants.
The god was worshipped daily just as though
he were a person of flesh and blood. Ritual acts,
chants and prayers accompanied the various parts
of this recurring ceremonial. In the morning the
officiating priest broke the clay seal affixed at the

priests, for whom more material forms of satis¬
faction were appropriate.
Many other temples in Egypt, including the
famous temple at Luxor, were dedicated to
Amon. How could the same god, who was
proclaimed to be unique in hymns and prayers,
be in several different places at the same instant?
To the Egyptians there was no contradiction
here. In reality, the statues of Amon placed in
the heart of the sanctuaries served simply as
points of "concentration" and "emergence" for
this omnipresent god.
Some cities also honoured other gods, but
their temples have not been so well preserved. The
great sanctuary of Heliopolis, dedicated to Re, has
been almost entirely destroyed, while those of
Ptah at Memphis or Thoth at Hermopolis, which
have greatly suffered from erosion, cannot com¬
pete with the impressive ruins at Karnak.
Karnak, a dynastic temple
The temple of Amon-Re at Karnak was probably
founded in the twentieth century BC, during the
reign of Sesostris I (1971-1929 BC). It steadily
grew in size, ending up as a colossal complex of
buildings forming a four-sided figure measuring
600 metres from corner to corner. It assumed
such proportions and underwent so many
metamorphoses because it became the great
dynastic temple of Egypt to which each Pharaoh
came to find the source of his legitimacy. Hardly
had he assumed office than the new sovereign had
a building put up for his divine father, Amon,
in order to secure further benefits from him. A
system of give-and-take was thus established
between the god and the king, which under¬
pinned the country's stability. Each monument,
which was first and foremost an offering, might
very well be destroyed in the next reign by a king
who wished in his turn to perform a notable act.
The dismantled stones were used again in new
monuments.
Karnak is thus the product of a long history
of destructions, additions and alterations, and its
foundations and thick walls are consequently
made up of thousands of stone blocks, scattered
around and jumbled together. These are patiently
being restored to their former positions and
studied by archaeologists seeking to reconstitute
the original form of the vanished monuments.
A form which, in itself, has nothing special
about it: all the temples of ancient Egypt resem¬
bled one another. In front of the sanctuary were
rooms paved with huge flagstones. At the
entrance to the hypostyle (pillared) halls set along
the main axis of the temple there were great stone
doors framed by two massive towers symbolizing
the two mountains at the confines of the land of
Egypt: the Arabian chain in the east and the
Libyan chain in the west. The doors and towers
together formed a structure known as a pylon
which marked the boundaries of a sacred place.
Before the doorways huge wooden poles were
adorned with banners that waved in the wind,
revealing the movements of the "divine breath"
through the world.
The general orientation of the temples was
also a matter of deliberate choice. The main axis
of the temple of Amon-Re followed the east-west
course of the sun. It was intersected by a second
perpendicular axis, running from south to north
like the Nile. This royal axis, followed only by
solemn processions, consisted of a series of court¬
yards and pylons preceded by colossal statues of
the royal dynasty, which expressed in material
form the eternal presence of the sovereign in the
temple.
The way in which scenes were set out on the
walls was patterned on the world in which the
Egyptians lived. The bottom was bordered by
geographical sequences in which the Nile gods
alternated with the goddesses of the countryside

The ceiling was decorated with motifs inspired
by astral themes: stars, constellations, zodiacs or
representations of the sun's celestial course within
the body of the goddess of the sky, Nut.
A precise system of symbols
The bas-reliefs on the walls indicated the func¬
tion of each room. Divinities and plants that were
emblematic of the north (the Nile delta, Lower
Egypt) were placed on the northern side and
those relating to the south (the Nile valley or
Upper Egypt) on the southern side. Along the
axis of the high cornices projecting out from over
the doors the disk of the sun could be seen, pro¬
tected by two upright cobras facing in opposite
directions. The sun's celestial course was por¬
trayed by the unfolding of two large wings. Inside
the rooms were religious scenes depicting the
essential ritual acts that were accomplished with
the participation of divinities, the king and
priestsofferings, processions, acts of consecra¬
tion, acts performed on the occasion of corona¬
tions or jubilees. On the outside, scenes were
portrayed that showed the exploits achieved
during the reign: the slaughtering of enemies, con¬
quests and battles.
The founding of a temple was marked by
ceremonies in which the succession of building
operations was accompanied by symbolic acts.
Many scenes depict the king marking out the
layout of the temple with string, scooping out
the first furrow with a hoe, purifying the foun¬
dations with natron, laying the cornerstones with
the help of a lever and finally presenting the
dwelling to his master, Amon-Re.
The temple was thus ushered into existence
like a living being. In one corner of the temple
a "foundation deposit" was buried. This was a
collection of objects comprising scale models of
tools, representations of offerings (glazed earthen¬
ware lettuces, ox legs and heads and sacrificed
geese) and briquettes marked with the name of
the king who had founded the temple. These
deposits are a boon to archaeologists as they serve
as the equivalent of birth certificates, enabling
them to assign a date to the building of a temple.
Other temples formed part of a complex
designed to ensure the dead Pharaoh's survival
in the hereafter. Human beings were considered
by the ancient Egyptians to have several compo¬
nents: the body, which was the material covering
of the human spirit (which was mummified in
an attempt to preserve it), but also the Ba (the
soul), the Akh (the immortal principle), the
shadow and the Ka (the life-force). The Ka of the
king was the very embodiment of his royal rank,
of the indestructible, cosmic part of his being, and
after his death joined up with that of his divine
ancestors.
The pyramid was associated with the royal
tomb, both in its form, which was a symbolic
reminder of the original mound and hence of the
birth of the world, and through its alignment
with the four cardinal points with, inside or out¬
side as the case may be, its flights of steps. It
thereby enabled the king to ascend to heaven, or
in other words to eternity. Continually reborn
like the morning star which rises every day in the
east, he was then assured of living for "millions
of years". 17

### 87193: The Proud tower

The proud tower wit
BY DOMINIQUE BEYER
'A.
18
LND the whole earth was of one language,
and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they found a plain
in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And
they said one to another, Go to, let us make
brick, and burn them throughly. And they had
brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and
a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and
let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad
upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord
came down to see the city and the tower, which
the children of men builded. And the Lord said,
Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
language; and this they begin to do: and now
nothing will be restrained from them, which they
have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and
there confound their language, that they may not
understand one another's speech. So the Lord
scattered them abroad from thence upon the face
of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
Therefore is the name of it called Babel..."
This is how the Bible (Genesis XI) evokes the
Tower of Babel. Symbol of human excess and
arrogance, this monument has always held a
powerful appeal to the imagination. But the little
that remains of the stepped temple tower (zig-
gurat) at the site of Babylon, which down the cen¬
turies has been plundered for building materials,
flooded, and overgrown with reeds from the banks
of the Euphrates, seems to bear little relation to
the various recreations of it made by creative
artists and scholars. Yet it is this monument to
which the Bible refers.
In his Histories, the ancient Greek historian
Herodotus gives the following description: "In
the middle [of the sanctuary] is a massive tower,
one stadium square, on top of which is another
tower which supports a third, and so on up to
eight towers. An external ramp rises in a spiral
to the last tower; about halfway up is a balcony
and some seats so that one can sit down and rest
on the way. The last tower contains a large sanc¬
tuary in which there is a richly decorated bed,
and beside it is a golden table. But there is no
statue, and only one person may sleep there: a
native woman whom the god has chosen before
all others, say the Chaldeans, who are priests of
this divinity."
The gist of this account by Herodotus is
borne out by cuneiform inscriptions on a Babylo¬
nian tablet dating from the Seleucid epoch (third
century BC). The inscriptions are based on an
older text which describes the great Temple of
Marduk, patron god of Babylon, restored by the
Chaldean kings Nabopolassar and his son
Nebuchadrezzar II towards the beginning of the
sixth century BC. This temple bore the name of
Esagila, "temple which uplifts the head". Its
accompanying ziggurat, the biblical Tower of
Babel, was called Etemenanki, "house of the foun¬
dation of the universe". With a base of 91 metres
square and rising to a similar height, the tower
consisted of seven stepped storeys with a temple
at the top.
Erosion has removed all trace of the temple,
and it is hard to say with certainty what function
was performed by the ziggurat, the centrepiece
of a vast religious ensemble. In the religious
beliefs of the ancient Sumerian and Semitic
inhabitants of the land of the two rivers (the
Tigris and the Euphrates), the stepped tower must
surely have been invested with many meanings,
and with its temple must have represented a
mythical vision of the universe.
The names given to different ziggurats, such
as "house of the mountain of the universe",
"house of the mountain that reaches to the sky",
provide valuable clues. Some texts designate the
ziggurat as the house of god and it is possible that
the marriage rites of deities took place there. The
Babylonian creation epic also evokes this resting-
place, where the way of heaven meets that of the
earth, where after the creation of the two parts
of the world the deities of the heavens and of the
earth gathered together around the great god
Anu, and where the deities of Apsu, the primor¬
dial waters beneath the earth, rejoin Ea, the
benefactor of humanity.
The Mesopotamian ziggurat seems to have
been considered as the centre of the universe and
a mythical link between heaven and earth. In the
words of King Nabopolassar himself: "The god
Marduk has commanded me to lay down solidly
the foundations of Etemenanki as far as the sub¬
terranean world and to cause its summit to reach
the heavens."

### 87194: A Sense of awe

A sense of awe BY SOPHIE DESCAMPS-LEQUIME
%HEN the Greeks felt a sense of awe in face
of natural phenomena which they could not
explain, they believed that they were in the
presence of a god. Such phenomena might include
an endlessly bubbling spring, the rustling of the
wind in leaves, an unusually shaped rock, a clap
of thunder, a fleeting shadow, or even a silence.
Places capable of arousing strong and frequent
feelings of respect tinged with fear, which the
Greeks called thambos, were favoured sites for
sanctuaries.
The gods manifested themselves in all kinds
of places. Apollo, for example, selected the gran¬
diose setting of Delphi, which clings to the sheer
cliffs of the Phaedriades, as well as the rocky
island of Delos in the Aegean. The limits of the
territory over which the god held sway were
marked by boundary stones or a surrounding
wall. Entry into the sacred precinct was for¬
bidden. It was sacrilege to be born or to die there
or for anyone with the slightest taint to set foot
in it. This sacred place cut off from the profane
world became the témenos of the god (témenos in
Greek means "cut off").
The most imposing vestiges of these sacred
places are the temples which are among the
best preserved buildings of ancient Greece. But
were temples really an essential feature of the
sanctuaries where the Greeks honoured their
gods?
The sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia provides
some highly revealing clues. For almost 500 years,
its patron god had no temple of his own, even
though, as Hesiod wrote in the seventh century
BC, he had the power to make mortal men
obscure or celebrated, to cast down those who
showed overweening pride and exalt the humble,
to thunder over the heads of the Greeks and to
inhabit the loftiest abodes. The first votive
offerings to Zeus date from the beginnings of the
sanctuary around 1000 BC, but the temple
housing the god's statue was built by the architect
Libon of Elis as late as 468 BC.
Why did the foremost of all the gods of
Olympus have to wait so long before he was
given a dwelling in his own sanctuarylonger
indeed than his wife Hera, whose temple was con¬
secrated around 600 BC? Why was it so long
before it was felt necessary to honour the god by
consecrating a building to him at that Pan-
Hellenic place where spectators and athletes from
all the cities of the Greek world gathered every
four years for the Olympic Games?
The answer is that the temple occupied only
a secondary place in Greek religion. It was not
the original core of the sanctuary. Unlike the
cathedrals of medieval Christendom, the Greek
temple was never the focal point of a city. It was
an altar in the open air that was the focal point
of the ceremonies performed by the Greeks in
accordance with the needs of a ritual which dated
back to the time of the Homeric heroes. What
the gods expected from men were prayers,
offerings and sacrifices, in return for which they
acceded to the requests of the faithful and
bestowed their blessing upon them.
The supreme sacrifice was consummated in
blood. Like the Trojans in the Iliad, the par¬
ticipants assembled on an esplanade and "laid out

the illustrious hecatomb around the resplendent
altar". The throats of the animals were cut at the
foot of the altar, on which burned a fire whose
flames entirely or partly consumed them. The
smoke rising into the sky was food the gods
loved.
An altar was the essentialand might be the
onlyfeature of a sanctuary. It might predate the
temple by several centuries, as was the case at
Olympia. Many altars were made of stone and
some were of imposing sizein the third century
BC, the tyrant Hieron II built an altar 192 metres
long at Syracuse in Sicily. Others were built of
perishable materials. The altar of Apollo at Delos
was made of the horns of goats used in sacrifices,
and the altar of Zeus at Olympia consisted of the
piled-up ashes of the sacrificial victims. The tire¬
less Greek traveller Pausanias described it as a
cone with a circumference measuring 37 metres
at the base and standing almost 7 metres high.
As a rule, the altar was situated in front of 21

the main façade of the temple, on the eastern side.
Processions of worshippers wended their way to
it. Access to the temple housing the god's statue
and some of the sacrificial offerings was usually
confined to the priests. The worshippers, who did
not often enter the temple, caught a glimpse of
the god's effigy through the half-open doors. At
Elis, the temple of Hades, god of the underworld,
was opened only once a year and only the priest
was allowed to enter it.
A second barrier
A Greek temple was thus a closed world. The
fence which separated the témenos from the world
of humankind was in its turn surrounded by a
colonnade. The worshippers remained on the
esplanade outside, and the colonnade merely gave
them an opportunity to walk round the building.
The few exceptions to this rule were both temples
and sanctuaries, and not only housed the statues
that were worshipped in them but also
represented an emanation of the deity. The
temple of Apollo at Delphi straddled the cleft in
the rock through which the god imparted his
oracle. Those wishing to consult the oracle under¬
went ritual purification and then entered the
building, but they were not allowed to go as far
as the secret place where, wreathed in shadow and
hidden from their gaze, the priestess or Pythia
sat on a pedestal and handed down the answers
given by the god.
The earliest temples were not very different
from the dwellings of human beings. Although,
as Apollo said in the Iliad, "there will always be
two separate racesthe race of the immortal gods
and the race of humans walking on earth" man
lent his appearance to the gods and acknowledged
that they had the same needs as people. Small
votive shrines were built in those early times
when the abode of a god was made in the image
of that of man. They consisted of a single rectan¬
gular or semi-circular room, with walls made of
rough bricks or clay mixed with pebbles and
straw on a base of stones and rubble, and a roof
supported by wooden pillars.
The Greeks were primarily city-dwellers and
the evolution of the Greek temple followed that
of the Greek city-state. Every civic community
honoured its protective gods by embellishing the
sanctuaries dedicated to them, and ostentation
often took precedence over piety. In the sixth
century BC, the cities were in the hands of rich
tyrants who displayed their power by con¬
structing grandiose monuments in the sacred
places. Temple-building developed rapidly, and
architects strove to impress and outdo their rivals.
The rudimentary early structures gave way
to massive buildings constructed partly or wholly
of limestone and marble. In some cases the tran¬
sition to stone was a gradual process. In the
temple of Hera at Olympia the wooden columns
were gradually replaced until by Roman times
only a single one was left. This was still visible
in the third century AD, when it was regarded
as a curiosity. However, by the beginning of the
sixth century BC, some temples were being built
entirely of stone. The temple of Artemis on the
island of Corfu is one example.
As architects learned to master this noble but
unwieldy material they began to think in terms
of volumes and of the use of space to give promi¬
nence to the effigy of the deity. The main
chamber of the temple, or naos, containing the
statue, was preceded by a vestibule, the pronaos,
which was matched symmetrically by a second
porch, or opisthodomos, at the rear of the building.
The boldest architects were those of the
Greek cities of Asia Minor. They built temples
as big as cathedrals, with double rows of columns
around the main chamber which were probably
inspired by the mighty architectural complexes
of ancient Egypt. The temple and the sanctuary
of Hera on the island of Samos were known as
the labyrinth, on account of their majestic forest
of 104 columns, which was a source of wonder¬
ment to the people of the time. The temple of
Artemis at Ephesus, some parts of the carved
decoration of which were donated by King
Croesus, was one of the Seven Wonders of the
Ancient World. It now survives only in legend,
since it was burnt down by arsonists, reputedly
on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Religious propaganda
The builders of mainland Greece and Sicily were
less adventurous. Their temples were smaller and
more compact. Even so, they distinguished them¬
selves from their counterparts in the Ionian cities
by evolving a completely different architectural
language. Their style, known as Doric, was not
purely decorative. The figurative scenes which
adorned the pediments of the façades and the
metopes, the square spaces alternating with the
vertical fluting on the frieze all round the
building, were intended to convey a message.
Sometimes painted, but more usually carved,
these scenes recounted the great myths with
which the Greeks were familar from childhood.
They depicted episodes from the lives of the
gods and legends from the time when the founder
heroes of the cities had consorted with the gods.
The subjects were chosen for purposes of religious

## [Page 23](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087205engo.pdf#page=23) 0

or political propaganda. The metopes of a temple
at Selinonte in Sicily show Apollo in his four-
horse chariot, Perseus cutting off the head of
the Gorgon Medusa, and Hercules grappling with
the two brigand brothers, the Cercopes. The
twelve sculptured metopes of the temple of Zeus
at Olympia depict the twelve labours of Hercules,
the son of Zeus and founder of the Olympic
Games. The pediment of the main east façade
recalls another hero, Pelops, who gave his name
to the entire region, the Péloponnèse. Pelops is
shown making ready to challenge King
Oenomaus in a chariot race. The worshippers
who saw the pediment would have known that
Pelops would win the race by a ruse and that
thereafter a curse would fall on his descendants.
The iconographie sequence adorning the
Parthenon in Athens, which was built in the
second half of the fifth century BC, was designed
to celebrate the city and its protective goddess
Athena. On the pediment of the western façade,
The Parthenon was built on
the Acropolis in Athens
between 447 and 432 BC.
which is immediately visible from the entrance
to the Acropolis, Athena and Poseidon the sea-god
can be seen disputing the possession of Attica. The
goddess, who was victorious, also appears on the
main eastern façade of the temple, the pediment
of which illustrates her birth in the presence of
the assembled senior gods of Olympus. The
metopes evoke the combat in which she and the
other gods engaged against the Giants at the dawn
of time. On a continuous carved frieze almost 160
metres long, visible only through the rows of
columns, Phidias, the master sculptor, illustrated
the main events of the Great Panathenaic festival
held in honour of Athena every four years, when
the goddess was presented with a sacred tunic, the
peplos, the supreme offering solemnly bestowed
upon her by the Athenians. Phidias portrayed the
entire city in a scene in which the citizens of
Athens mingled with the chief gods of Olympus
and the first legendary rulers of the city.
The Parthenon housed an effigy of Athena,
formed of plaques of gold and ivory and meas¬
uring almost 12 metres high. Yet in spite of its
opulent decoration, this statue was not meant to
be worshipped. It did not have a priestess and was
simply valued as a precious object. The authentic
object of worship on the Acropolis was an old
wooden idol contained within the enclosure of
the Erechtheum which encompassed the city's
holiest places.
A temple such as the Parthenon had every
appearance of a place of worship without actu¬
ally being one. The official cult practised there
was lacking in spiritual substance. When the
citizens gathered to partake of the sacrifice which
they offered to their gods, they were above all
reaffirming the civic ties which bound them
together.
The way to salvation
Traditional religion did not satisfy everyone. To
the just man capable of living by the precepts of
Greek ethics, the "know thyself" and "nothing
in excess" inscribed on the temple of Apollo at
Delphi, it did not hold out any hope of a better
life in the hereafter. The Greeks, who were
familiar with Homeric poetry on the world of
shadows, recalled the lamentations of the hero
Achilles, who would have preferred to "live as
a ploughboy labouring for a poor farmer rather
than reign over the dead, over this entire people
whose lives have been extinguished". This dis¬
satisfaction accounts for the emergence of
redemptionist religions such as the Eleusinian
Mysteries, which guaranteed their initiates a
happy life after death.
But the gods of Olympus continued to be
worshipped in traditional ways, and temples con¬
tinued to be built for several centuries. Few
Greeks seem to have heeded the words of the
Stoic philosopher Zeno who proclaimed at the
beginning of the third century BC that "God is
universal reason that is present in all things	
Such a god does not countenance statues or
temples, for the true sanctuary lies in the star-
studded sky". 23

### 87195: The Mystery of Stonehenge

s.
/TONEHENGE is the most famous prehistoric place
in Europe. Like the pyramids of Egypt and the Great
Wall of China, it is one of the few archaeological sites
known the world over. What is Stonehenge? Why does
it deserve to be celebrated?
Stonehenge is the ruin of a single stone building.
It stands on grassland, on the handsome undulating
chalk downs of southern England, about 120 kilometres
west of London. Nearly half the great blocks of stone
which its full design needs have disappeared, taken away
to make bridges, broken up for building stone; or
perhaps the full design was never completed. Seen from
the ground today, Stonehenge is a confusion of stones,
many of them neatly trimmed to a clean shape. Some
stand upright, as high as 6 metres above ground.
Others, a little smaller, bridge across from one upright
to another. Others lie broken or half-buried in the
grass. Seen from the air, or studied in a plan, the stones
show themselves to have once been arranged geometri¬
cally, the majority in two circles and in two U-shaped
settings, so the basic design of the place is straightfor¬
ward enough.
Stonehenge is not large. Its main part is 30 metres
in diameter and there are less than 200 blocks in the
full design. But the blocks themselves are remarkable.
They weigh many tonnes, and show in protected places
the traces of the mason's work, where they were ham¬
mered and rubbed into shape. In other places, less
sheltered, their rough surfaces betray the force of 40
centuries of British summers and winters which have
worn and coarsened the rock. The larger blocks come
from sandstone deposits about 45 kilometres to the
north of Stonehenge, and the smaller ones from beds
of volcanic rocks in Wales, 200 kilometres to the west.
The experts are at present arguing as to whether pre¬
historic people dragged the stones from Wales, or
whether the swirling ice of glaciers had conveniently
delivered them by natural causes near to Stonehenge.
Although Stonehenge is a stone building, it is not
built with walls and arches. Each column is a single
upright stone, buried into a chalk foundation to hold it
in place. Each horizontal is a single stone also, held in
place by a peg carved on the top surface of the upright
which fits into a matching socket under the horizon¬
tal. This is the technique of the carpenter.
Who built Stonehenge? That we do know. Radio¬
carbon dating, the scientific method on which the pre¬
historic chronology of Europe depends, shows that the
main part of Stonehenge is about 4,000 years old,
though portions are several centuries older or youn¬
ger. This is many hundred years before the Roman em¬
pire reached out from the Mediterranean to the north,
so one can be sure that Stonehenge was built by the
inhabitants of the ancient British Isles, rather than in¬
vaders from the south. They too were responsible for
building several hundred other stone circles across the
islands, some larger than Stonehenge and some smaller,
but none so complex in layout or built of such neatly
shaped blocks. And right across northwest Europe,
from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Baltic Sea, peo¬
ple at that time were in the habit of building tombs,
temples, and lines of stones out of great blocks. All these
monuments archaeologists call megaliths, from the an¬
cient Greek words for "great" and "stone", because it
is the massive size of the blocks that impresses.
How did they build Stonehenge? When some fallen
stones were lifted back up during the 1950s, they were
so heavy that the largest mobile crane then available
in Britain was needed. Yet the builders of Stonehenge
had no powered machinery; their kit was made of stone,
of soft chalk, and of trimmed tree trunks and branches.
They must have had ropes to pull the stones; we
believe that these were twisted from strips of cow hide.
It would have taken many hundreds of people many
long days to shift the stones across country to the site,
to hammer at the hard surface to trim the shape and
make the pegs and holes for the joints, and to

manoeuvre each stone into place with chalk ramps or
wood packing.
What was Stonehenge for? The care taken in its
building, and the vast expenditure of labour that it in¬
volved, make it evident that it was of the greatest im¬
portance. Stonehenge could not have been a houseit
never had a roofor a place to keep animals. It was
not a mundane building whose purpose is simply prac¬
tical. Its meaning was spiritual, it was some kind of holy
or sacred place. In short, it was a temple.
As centuries passed, the importance of Stonehenge
faded. None of the Roman authors who reported on
the state of Britain 2,000 years after it was built make
a mention of it, and in the end it was forgotten com¬
pletely. The name Stonehenge is medieval, and indi¬
cates the period when it was noticed again. So we have
no direct record of just who or what was worshipped
at Stonehenge, and why this particular spot was chosen
to be made sacred.
The evidence of Stonehenge itself, pieced together
by minute study and archaeological observation, gives
some clues. First, there is the exactness of the design,
judged to a precision of a few centimetres and carried
out on a grand scale: this is the work of some command¬
ing experta person who today would be called an ar¬
chitect. Second, there is the execution of the design and
the great effort this would have required from small
and scattered communities of subsistence farmers: this
was a community venture which made demands on all.
Third, the space inside the Stonehenge circles is not
large: it would hold at most 300 peoplemany fewer
than the number involved in the building. One thinks
of the common structure of sacred buildings, with an
outer area open to all, and a special inner place reserved
for the priests, where more holy matters are celebrated.
The central area of Stonehenge, surrounded by stone
uprights that close it off from the open area outside,
is similar in area to the choir of a medieval European
cathedral.
There is another clue. Stonehenge is designed to
fall symmetrically around an axis that runs from south¬
west to north-east. And from the north-east entrance
an avenue, visible on the ground as eroded earth banks,
runs across country on that same north-eastern axis.
That axis is aligned in the direction of sunrise at the
summer solstice, 21 June in the modern calendar, the
longest day of the British year. A small number of other
megalithic monuments seem to have similar align¬
ments: the Newgrange mound in western Ireland, a
little older than Stonehenge, is aligned to sunrise at
the winter solstice, the shortest day of the British
winter. The conclusion is obvious: Stonehenge was a
temple of the sun.
Modern astronomers, looking at the position of
individual stones and calculating how they might relate
to movements of sun and moon, think that Stonehenge
is more than a temple; it is some kind of observatory
where exact study of the heavens was made, the move¬
ments of sun and moon tracked, and their eclipses
predicted. Archaeologists, knowing that alignments can
arise by chance and doubting that prehistoric Britons
were any kind of white-coated scientist, are not con¬
vinced. I am not sure myself even that the sun was wor¬
shipped at Stonehenge, although the miracle of its daily
rebirth in the eastern dawn each morning must have
had a full place in prehistoric Britons' view of their
life and world. Notice that Christian churches are
aligned towards the east, towards sunrise in fact: yet
Christianity is not the worship of the sun.
We do not know exactly what was worshipped at
Stonehenge. We do not know if everyone in the com¬
munity went to it, or only a special few men or women
or children or old people. We do not know if worship¬
pers entered it in joy or terror. We do not know if
worship filled their lives or meant their deaths. But we
do know that Stonehenge was a religious place, a
sacred site.

JL OR most people, the architecture of Buddhism
in the Far East is synonymous with its most
typical feature, the pagoda, a lofty tiered structure
with a projecting curved roof at each level. In
popular imagery pagodas appear as ubiquitous fea¬
tures of the town and country landscape, but they
are most typically shown in remote mountain
sites which seem particularly appropriate to the
silent inner quest, the meditation and renuncia¬
tion which are characteristic of Buddhist practice.
In China, Korea and Japan the pagoda
dominates a cluster of buildings which stand
inside an enclosure whose wide gates give it the
appearance of a walled city. This complex of
buildings consists of temples and a monastery, for
Buddhist temples are usually shared by monks
who live there permanently and members of the
lay community, in contrast to the Christian West
where there is a distinction between cathedrals
and churches which are built in the midst of the
community and monasteries which are secluded
from it.
The temple-monastery complex is the
product of a long period of development. In early
Buddhism, the religious ideal was pursued exclu¬
sively by communities of monks. And although
it was in India, the cradle of Buddhism, that
monks and laymen first began to share the hospi¬
tality of sacred monastic precincts, the temple-
monastery would find its most complete expres¬
sion in the most distant corners of the Buddhist
world, especially in the imperial foundations of
the Tang dynasty in China during the seventh
and eighth centuries AD.
The first Buddhist monument was the burial
mound housing the relics of the spiritual master,
Gautama Buddha (the "Enlightened One") who
lived in the fifth century BC in northern India.
A cosmic symbol, this tumulus or stupa was a
hemispherical mound surmounted by a mast and
surrounded by a circular balustrade with a
gateway at each of the four cardinal points.
Crowning the central axis were a number of discs
corresponding to the celestial domains of other
worlds. Later stupas were conical or shaped like
a four-sided pyramid. Later still tower-like stupas
were built in China, and from them the pagoda
eventually developed.
The first Buddhist communities had neither
meditation halls nor fixed abode. The monks
lived as wandering preachers who renounced
worldly possessions and begged for their food like
the Master and the traditional holy men of India.
The first Buddhist places of communal devo¬
tion date from the second and first centuries BC
when monks in western India began to convert
caves for this purpose, probably because it was
their practice to use caves as places for medita¬
tion when travel was impossible during the rainy
season.
This type of semi-natural "architecture" was
so influential that cave-sanctuaries continued to
be used in the Buddhist world as well as free¬
standing temples, especially in central Asia and
China. In some cases, as at Dunhuang in China's
Gansu province, a wooden façade was placed in
front of the entrance to the caves or the rock was
carved in imitation of a wooden construction.
In Buddhist religious architecture there were
thus two types of building, the meditation hall,
which was a development of the monk's cell, and
the stupa or reliquary monument. At first these
two types were distinct, but when the temples
at Karli and Bhaja in western India were built
some three or four centuries after the death of
the Buddha, they merged into a single edifice. 27

Influences on sacred architecture
Buddhism is rooted in history through the person
of its founder and this is the core of its doctrine.
The life and work of the sage Gautama were at
first the sole object of devotion and the way
shown by him was the spiritual path to be
trodden. It is fitting therefore that the first Budd¬
hist monument should have been the stupa, a
burial mound and shrine. Better than any other
symbol, it represents his passage through history.
A more ambitious architectural approach
developed later to accommodate a growing com¬
munity united by the rules of a single liturgy. The
schism which occurred in the first century AD,
between those who were faithful to monastic
orthodoxy (Hinayana or "Little Vehicle" Budd¬
hism) and the reformers, who favoured a more
just distribution of spiritual vocations between
men (Mahayana or "Great Vehicle"), influenced
sacred architecture. The capacity of the holy
places was increased to accommodate the students
and followers of Buddha and, more importantly,
a pantheon of deities (Bodhisattvas) appeared
around the image of the Buddha as objects of
popular veneration.

JACQUES GIES,
of France, is curator of the
Chinese section of the Musée
Guimet in Pans and professor
of Chinese art and aesthetics
at the University of Paris IV
(Sorbonne). He has published a
number of articles on Buddhist
art in China and central Asia.
The rock-cut shrines
of central Asia
Two types of sacred architecturecave-sanctuaries
hewn out of the living rock and precincts con¬
taining temples, a monastery and a stupa
developed in the oases on the Silk Road in
Chinese Turkestan which became focal points of
Buddhist culture after the eclipse of Buddhism in
India.
Rock-cut shrines such as those at Yunkang
in China's Shanxi province are often called "caves
of a thousand Buddhas" (a term which distin¬
guishes them from temples in the strict sense)
owing to their rows of stone Buddhas carved
from the cliff face. Their design showed a progres¬
sive change of style during a period of intense reli¬
gious activity which lasted from the fifth to the
eighth or ninth centuries. The oldest sites, in
which there is a pradaksina (circumambulatory)
path around the revered stupa, reveal the
influence of early Buddhist foundations in India.
In central Asia the stupa is a quadrangular
pillar, each face of which may be adorned with
a statue of the Buddha, who is often flanked by
attendants. Stupas of this kind express the ancient
link, which originated in India, between the sym¬
bolic monument and the sacred image. At the
same time, the cave walls were gradually covered
with paintings illustrating scenes from the lives
of the Buddha.
The pillar stupa and the circumambulatory
path disappeared from central Asian cave-
sanctuaries constructed in the seventh and eighth
centuries, thus indicating a change in ritual prac¬
tice. An altar consisting of statues was carved in
a niche hewn from the wall at the end of the cave,
facing the entrance. The new design encouraged
the creation of monumental imagery in which the
Buddha, usually shown preaching, is surrounded
by an assembly of revered beings (great monks,
Bodhisattvas, god-kings and guards), in large
groups of painted sculptures.
The disappearance of the circumambulatory
path brought a decline in the illustrations of the
lives of the Buddha which the faithful saw during
their ritual encirclement of the stupa. The pious
tended to ascribe divine and universal stature to
the Buddha. His benevolent image was depicted
in many transcendent figures which triumphantly
cover wide expanses of space. Much detail was
devoted to visions of the worlds in which the
devout hoped to be reborn, and each wall of the
cave was decorated with vast mystic composi¬
tions, designed as self-contained panels.
Although the design of the cave-shrines was
inspired by pillars, beams, consoles and other
features of wooden edifices, it did not reproduce
the fine architecture of the free-standing temple,
that harmonious complex of sanctuaries and
other monuments. Such free-standing temples are
known to have existed in the oasis towns of
Kucha, Khotan and Tumchuq in central Asia,
but it was in China that temple design attained
such a measure of stylistic coherence and such
power as the expression of a religious ideal that
it was adopted as a classical model by Korea and
Japan.
The ancient Chinese rules which governed
the symbolic use of space came to dominate the
architecture of the Buddhist temple. The notion
of a centre and the four cardinal points gave rise
to the alignment of the main chapels along the
north-south axis and the four doors of the temple
precinct. This symbolic layout is endlessly
repeated in an interplay of corresponding features
and is duplicated by the vertical superstructure
symbolizing the earth at the base and the celes¬
tial dome above. As Rolf A. Stein has written,
"Whether it was already vested with this meaning
or not, the stupa had become an orientated tower
with a square or octagonal base which can be
ascended in a spiral, in imitation of the graded
heavens of Buddhism". 1 29

### 87197: The Once and future city

The once and future
i
30
N the history of Judaism, the Temple of
Jerusalem is constantly referred to, not so much
as a holy place that marks the site of a bygone
event or ritual, but as a symbol of messianic hope.
The Jerusalem towards which Jews turn three
times a day, at the time of prayer, is not the
Jerusalem of their roots, but a city to come.
In Judaism, the link between people and God
finds consecration in the Tabernacle, the Temple
and the synagogue. Although omnipresent and
thus able to manifest Himself anywhere, regard¬
less of the physical surroundings, God neverthe¬
less instituted the notion of a privileged sanctuary
when He commanded the Hebrews in the wilder¬
ness to build a Tabernacle to house the Ark of
the Covenant in which the Tablets of the Law
were to be kept.
The Tabernacle, the first holy dwelling-place
in Jewish history, is described in detail in the
Bible. The Tabernacle is primarily the dwelling-
place of God ("And let them make me a sanc¬
tuary, that I may dwell among them"). It was to
be in the form of a tent, a mobile sanctuary, thus
clearly showing that its sacred nature was due to
the presence of God and was not associated with
any particular place. God's presence was symbo¬
lized by the Ark of the Covenant, with its
Cherubim, whose outspread wings formed the
divine king's throne.

furnishings of the Tabernacle were in conformity
with the divine decrees. These concerned, in par¬
ticular, the Ark of the Covenant, the menorah
or multi-branched candelabrum, the table for the
shewbread and the altar. Above all, they ordained
the division of the Tabernacle into two distinct
areasthe main hall and the Holy of Holies,
whose proportions, functions and contents were
to be repeated in the Temple of Solomon, thus
ensuring continuity of conception from one sanc¬
tuary to another.
The building of the Temple of Solomon,
around 950 BC, was a response to the sedentari-
zation of the people of Israel, as well as a peak
of grandeur attained by the kingdom of David.
The Temple of Jerusalem became the religious
centre of the nation. At times of pilgrimage, the
faithful flooded in from all Judaea and even from
more distant regions to bring their offerings and
to make their sacrifices. The ritual instituted in
the Bible took on its ultimate form and the
Temple both embodied the notion of a holy place
and offered a pattern for ecclesiastical
architecture.
It can be assumed that, very early on, along¬
side the sacrificial rites performed in the Temple
and earlier sanctuaries, the Jews offered up
prayers. There are, however, few textual refer¬
ences and no archaeological evidence to support
this hypothesis. The institution of the synagogue

m
as the place of prayer, therefore, probably dates
from the Babylonian exile (587 BC).
It was on their return to Israel in 538 BC that
the captives from Babylon brought back with
them the custom of gathering to pray and listen
to the reading of the Law (the Torah). This prac¬
tice coexisted with the ritual of the Temple for
many centuries, and continued alone after the des¬
truction of the Second Temple in 70 AD.
The building of synagogues
As the synagogue was a post-Biblical institution,
there were no precise instructions for the manner
of its construction. A single reference in the
Talmud* lays down that a synagogue should be
built on high ground and should be higher than
the buildings around it. From the Old Testament
Book ofDaniel we can deduce that windows were
considered indispensable for prayer, since they
enabled those praying to contemplate the
heavens, which inspired them with reverence and
devotion. Daniel also turned towards Jerusalem
when he prayed, and this was to have consider¬
able influence on the layout of synagogues.
Although synagogues had to be oriented
towards Jerusalem, the architectural responses to
this imperative varied considerably during the
32
early centuries of the Christian era. At the begin¬
ning, the main façade of the building faced
Jerusalem. In buildings constructed on this plan
no indication has been found of the siting of the
Holy Ark containing the Torah, which was sup¬
posed to be kept either in an adjoining room, or
outside the synagogue to which it was brought
for the reading of the Law. From the third cen¬
tury onwards, there was a definite change in the
layout of synagogues and the orientation of the
building was determined by the position within
it of the Ark.
In The Antiquities of the Jews, the historian
Flavius Josephus (37-100 AD) mentions the prac¬
tice of building synagogues near rivers or the sea
so that a room for ritual ablutions could be added
to the place of prayer.
The emergence of the synagogue represented
a fundamental break with the Temple cult. It
marked the transition from rituals performed
exclusively by the High Priest and his assistants,

the Lévites, to a form of collective service. This
movement from sacrificial ritual to prayer had
certain social effects, since the various parts of the
cult officesthe reading of the Law and prayer
could, from then on, be conducted by any adult
male believer and required no priesthood.
The synagogue became a centre of social life.
Flavius Josephus noted that the faithful gathered
not only to hear the reading of the Law and to
pray, but also to discuss problems concerning the
life of the community. In the great synagogue at
Alexandria, the men were seated according to
their trade. The spinners, silversmiths, and smiths
had their assigned places and any man entering
the synagogue knew immediately where to find
his colleagues. The synagogue was also a centre
of intellectual life and became known as the bet
ha-midrash, or house of study.
Generally speaking, the essential nature of
worship at the synagogue meant that the elements
of architectural style were of only secondary
importance, and these were often borrowed from
the surrounding buildings. Leaving aside these
local influences, however, there can be said to be
a truly synagogical style with its own internal
organization and iconography.
The Temple of Solomon, which was based
on the traditional layout of the sanctuaries of
Canaan and on the model of the Tabernacle, con¬
sisted of three successive areasthe vestibule, or
ulam, the main room, or hekhal, and the Holy
of Holies, or devir, which only the High Priest
could enter. In addition, there was a gradation
between the areas allocated to women, to men
and to the priests.
LAURENCE SIGAL,
of France, is curator at the
Museum of the Art and History
of Judaism in Paris. Her main
interests are philosophy and
the history of art and religion.
In the synagogues, however, where the whole
assembly of the faithful participated in the liturgy,
the architecture of the interior was organized
around two key pointsthe Holy Ark and the
bima, or pulpit, at which the scrolls of the Law
are opened and read.
The Holy Ark is in full view of all, indeed it
cannot but be seen, since it is placed in the direc¬
tion to which the faithful turn in prayer. It is set
in a recess or in a dominant position on a dais, and
forms both a real and a symbolic link between



the faithful and their prayersthe earthly
Jerusalem and, through it, the heavenly city.
Ever since the Middle Ages the bima has
occupied a central position, which it retains
whatever may be the constraints of space, with
the Holy Ark being always placed against the east
wall. Its position is the physical expression of the
change in form of the servicethe faithful form
a circle around the centre of the synagogue and
take turns to approach the bima.
Ornamentation
The early centuries of the Christian era saw a
transition from ornamented exteriors to
ornamented interiors. This was a response to
legislation hostile to the spread ofJudaism. About
a hundred years after the death of the Roman
emperor Constantine the Great (288-337 AD),
Jews were forbidden to build new synagogues or
even to restore existing ones, unless they were
liable to collapse. The profuse sculpted exterior
ornamentation of the early synagogues gradually
came to be abandoned, while interior floor
mosaics started to appear, the richest of these
dating from the fifth and sixth centuries.
The rabbis were far from being systematically
opposed to the pictorial expression of the
teachings of the Bible. In this respect, at least in
ancient Palestine, synagogues opened the way
towards the decoration of churches. Specific reli¬
gious themes began to appear alongside
naturalistic and pagan subjects and geometric
motifs borrowed from Hellenistic mosaics.
The spiritual links between the Temple and
the synagogue and between the Ark of the
Covenant and the Holy Ark are to be seen in the
ornamentation of the cult objects associated with
the Torahthe cloth coverings, the silver orna¬
ments and plates recall the robes and ornamental
breastplate of the High Priest; the decoration of
the Holy Arkwhich often consists of pillars and
a curtain, deriving from the veil that partitioned
off the Holy of Holiesrecalls the furnishings of
the Temple. In general terms, the recurrent
presence of architectural motifs in Jewish cult
objects (Hanukka lamps, incense boxes) leads one
to believe that they too have a symbolic meaning,
referring back once more to the building of
buildingsthe Temple.

ature. It is held to be the authentic interpretation of the Law of Moses,

community
.
BY CHRISTIANE NAFFAH
A,LNY religious building, when a believer sets
foot in it, becomes the "centre of the universe".
The mosques that have been built over the past
thirteen centuries in countries asjîàr apart as Spain
and India are a magnificent illustration of this.
Mosques are places of worship and also, to
some degree, centres of cultural activity. A wide
range of subjects are taught in them, from the
Arabic language and the Islamic religion to law,
geography, medicine and astronomy. Their links
with authority, with powerful and devout public
figures, set them at the hub of a network of social
institutions, such as hospitals, hospices, alms¬
houses, colleges and schools.
But their location in the heart of the city, sur¬
rounded by the bazaar and its multitude of
craftsmen, the starting or culminating point of
the vast urban spiral, bears witness to their imme¬
diate, essential and universal role, which is to beat
in time with the pulse of Islamic communities in
countries all over the world.
The Five Pillars of Islam
Mosques are dedicated to prayer, the most impor¬
tant of the five obligations which constitute the
"Five Pillars of Islam". Individual prayer culmi¬
nates in the gesture by which Muslims prostrate
themselves and touch the floor with their fore¬
heads. The word "Muslim", which means "one
who submits to God", takes its significance from
this act of submission. Wherever believers may
be, they perform that act five times a day.
Collective prayer in a place of worship, with
at least forty people present, strengthens the links
between the community, the umma, which is
bound together not by ties of blood like a tribe,
but by faith. The great mosque in which these

prayers take place is known as the jami, from the
word jum'a (gathering), which also designates the
day for those prayers, Fridayium eljum'athe
day of gathering.
The prayer of the Prophet
In 622 AD, on his arrival in Medina, the Prophet
had the first mosque built so that his community
of the faithful could assemble without being dis¬
turbed. A space was cleared to form a kind of
courtyard. Walls made of sun-baked bricks were
erected on stone foundations, with three openings
framed by stone uprights. At the beginning, the
Prophet and the faithful turned towards Jerusalem
36
to pray and hence, for some time, the direction
of prayer, the qibla, continued to be perpendi¬
cular to the north wall of the building. Two rows
of palm-tree trunks supported a roof made of clay
and palm-leaves to provide shade.
This sanctuary made of earth and palm trees,
of areas of shade and sunlight, was meant to
express the immateriality of a building dedicated
to prayer. Many oratories of this type were cons¬
tructed at places where the conquering armies
halted. At the outset, they were completely bare
of decoration.
In cities that had been conquered, mosques
were sometimes housed in earlier shrines or were
built on the sites of traditional places of worship.
Simple geometrical shapes, such as rectangles or
squares, were used. Gradually, however, a variety
of factors relating to the liturgy, the climate or
local traditions came to influence the design and
construction of mosques. In aesthetic terms, a
significant step was taken in the eighth century,
with the emergence of the architecture of the
caliphate, an imperial style enhanced by contact
with earlier civilizations.
After breaking with the Jews of Medina,
Muhammad turned the qibla away from Jeru¬
salem to face Mecca, so that it became perpendi¬
cular to the south wall.
Spiritual and temporal
The Prophet's apartments, and notably the rooms
of his wives, gave onto the courtyard of the
mosque, which soon became a communal area
used for a variety of purposes such as tending the
wounded, resting, discussion and even guarding
prisoners. At this headquarters of the new com¬
munity, Muhammad led the prayers and preached
sermons, urging obedience to the one and only
God and the precepts of social order. Here he
exercised his function as the religious and poli¬
tical leader of Islam.
In the mosque at Medina, the Prophet sat
facing the congregation on the minbar, a kind of
pulpit set in the centre of the qibla wall. The
minbar was made of tamarind wood and con¬
sisted of a seat on a two-step dais. Its right upright

was surmounted by a small silver socket, which
was probably intended to contain the spear which
the Prophet held out before him to mark the
direction in which to pray. Later, the person prea¬
ching the sermon, the khutba, would hold a sword
or battle-standard. And while it is true that there
are no clergy in Islam, the imam leading the
prayer is, in fact, the spiritual, temporal and mili¬


tary leader of the community.
The minbar therefore represents the merging
of civil and religious power. From the aesthetic
standpoint, it was one of the first religious
symbols to be extensively changed. Its height was
raised and it was fitted with doors and a dome,
thereby conferring an aura of sanctity on the
person sitting in it.
The qibla wall contains a hollowed-out niche
or recess known as the mihrab, which indicates
the direction of Mecca. After the Prophet's death,
it came to symbolize his presence and, through
him, the presence of God, whose envoy he was.
There has to be a mihrab in every mosque.
This recess is surmounted by a dome, a shape
which has symbolized the celestial vault ever
since Antiquity. It must not contain any statue
or image of the Prophet. In fact, figurative repre¬
sentations are forbidden in Islam since God alone
has the right to instill life into a figure and any
attempt to measure man's work with that of God
would be sacrilege. Even so, the decoration of the
mihrab, the Holy of Holies, is exceptionally rich
and often extends to the wall surrounding it. It

is culturally revealing as a reflection of the domi¬
nant artistic current in each locality.
Mosques are closed-in buildings whose main
façades are on the inside, round a courtyard or
along the side of the prayer-hall. This introverted
form of architecture isolates the Muslim commu¬
nity in an enclosed space.
The mosque is usually flanked by a tower,
or minaret, in some cases more than one, from
the top of which the muezzin calls the faithful
to prayer. Its function and shape are largely
influenced by those of Christian bell-towers and
the towers of Byzantine fortresses. It is a symbolic
line of force, which provides communication bet¬
ween the inner spacethe mosqueand the outer
spacethe cityand it also becomes an aesthetic
line of force.
The courtyard in front of the prayer-hall con¬
tains a fountain for ablutions, in the shape of an
open or closed basin at which Muslims can
achieve the state of moral and physical purity
necessary for prayer.
The Arab period
Many large mosques were built under the
Umayyad (661-750) and Abbasid (750-1258) cali¬
phates, in other words during the Arab period
of Islamic history. Their design followed the ori¬
ginal plan, but at the same time they were being
built in countries which had artistic traditions of
their own and where the services of local

craftsmen were enlisted. Hence, the Islamic art
and architecture of this period bear the mark of
the civilizations which had flourished in those
countries, and the plans of mosques evoke those
of Christian basilicas, Byzantine palaces or Per¬
sian audience chambers. Local traditions would
again dictate the evolution of the mosque in the
centuries that followed.
In Syria, the Great Mosque of Damascus was
built in the eighth century on the site of a temple
dedicated to Jupiter, which had become the
church of St. John the Baptist in the intervening
period. The ground plan is rectangular, in keeping
with the celebrated Golden Number of the archi¬
tects of Antiquity. The central nave, oriented in
the direction of Mecca, is higher and wider than
the side aisles, thereby stressing the majesty of
the building and its political role as the Great
Mosque of the Empire. Next to the mihrab, a
dome marks the enclosure reserved for the sove¬
reign inside the prayer-hall. Byzantine influence
can clearly be seen in the structure and in the geo¬
metric and plant motifs of the decorative mosaics.
In the same way, the T-shaped plan of the
prayer-hall of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in
Tunisia (836) is reminiscent of the transept of
Western churches. The same influence can be seen
in the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain (785).
In Iraq, the Abbasid dynasty founded its
capital in Baghdad and then transferred it to
Samarra between 833 and 889. The Great Mosque
is built of hollow bricks, the local material. Its
plan is strictly modelled on that of the mosque
of Medina. By contrast, its spiral minaret is ins¬
pired by the ziggurats of Mesopotamia. In Cairo,
the simple plan and balanced proportions of the
Mosque of Ibn Tulun (876-879) reflect a desire
to return to the sources. Like the Kairouan
mosque, the building has the strength and
sobriety of Western Cistercian art. These two
mosques are the expression of the spiritual mes¬
sage of a religion reduced to essentials and
without any hierarchy.
Persian and Turkish mosques
In Persia, under the Seljuk dynasty from the
eleventh century onwards, a new design was
introduced and became the predominant model.
This is the mosque with four iwan, opening onto
a central courtyard. The iwan is a vaulted hall,
closed on three sides. It is a kind of monumental
porch symbolizing the opening into the divine
world. Whereas Arab mosques were built by a
process of accretion, these mosques were cons¬
tructed symmetrically around a central point and
their plans are clearly recognizable from both the
outside and inside of the building. The Masjid-i
Shah or royal mosque in Isfahan (early seven¬
teenth century) is a notable example of this strong
architectural unity.
In India, where Iranian influence can be seen
in the structure of minarets and entrance portals,
an original plan was introduced during the
Moghul period in the Great Mosque of Delhi
which was built in 1650. Indian mosques usually
have a relatively small prayer-hall surmounted by
a dome, and a far larger courtyard. They are
designed for receiving large congregations and
for a climate that is suited to holding prayers
out of doors.
Ottoman mosques are of a distinctive type
and are built on strict geometrical lines around
a central space. The transformation of the Chris¬
tian space of the Saint Sophia basilica in Cons¬
tantinople into a Muslim space inspired Mimar
Sinan, the architect of Süleyman the Magnificent
in the sixteenth century, to produce authentic
imperial designs. With their sophisticated inter¬
twined domes and half-domes, his mosques
magnify the power of the sovereign, the shadow
of Cod on earth.
Whether Arab, Turkish or Persian, the
mosque is a microcosm which believers must
intuitively decipher through their faith. In the
words of the Qur'an:
We show the signs to those who understand.

(1987).



A realm of light
JL HROUGH its history, through all it stands for
and through the Christian miracle renewed there
each day, the cathedral church is the sublime
expression of the Catholic faith. Although it has
undergone many changes down the centuries it
remains faithful to its original purpose of
assembling around a bishop the community of
believers who share his faith. At a very early stage
it became known as the ekklesia, from the Greek
word used to designate that assembly. It is there
that the bishop celebrates Mass, during which the
bread and wine are transformed into the body
and blood of Christ, the Son of God, who came
into the world to atone for man's original sin
through His martyrdom on the cross and to form
a new covenant with him. The church expresses
this holy covenant in its architecture and in the
service which is celebrated there.
We know little of early Christian places of

worship because they were kept secret to avoid
persecution, a situation that was only changed
when the new religion was recognized by the
Roman state. On 28 October 312, the Roman
emperor Constantine the Great accepted the
Christian faith before he went into battle against
his rival Maxentius. First tolerated then actively
promoted, Christianity soon became the official
religion of the Roman empire.
This decisive event in the history of the
Church was the acknowledgement of a situation
which could no longer be concealed. The new
faith was powerful and was expanding very
rapidly, especially in the towns and cities, among
all classes of society. Provision now had to be
made for the celebration of a religion which no
longer had to keep itself hidden. A new architec¬
tural design was drawn up at the imperial court
and, promoted by the emperor's entourage and 39

, '-* ;'%
especially by his mother, St. Helena, was adopted
throughout the Roman empire.
The design had to take the requirements of
the liturgy into account. As in all initiatory
religions, the Christiansthose who had received
the baptismal sacrament just as Christ had been
baptized in the River Jordan by St. John the
Baptisthad to be separated from the
catechumens, whose initiation into the mysteries
of the religion required an extremely long prepa¬
ration ending, as it did for Christ Himself, at the
age of thirty. Provision thus had to be made for
two adjoining yet separate buildings.
The imperial architects drew up plans for two
types of building, the baptistery and the basilica.
The former was designed on a centralized plan
with a basin sunk into the floor where the
catechumen would be immersed to receive bap¬
tism. It would be surmounted by a dome resting
on a lofty drum which was pierced with window
openings and supported by arcades giving onto
an ambulatory. This very simple, graceful
building would be bathed in light and lavishly
decorated.
Abundant light and magnificent decoration
were also typical of the basilica, but on a much
grander scale in order to accommodate the con¬
gregation assembled around the Lord's Table
upon which the bishop celebrates Mass. Inspired
by the secular basilicas of the ancient world, and
adapted to its new purpose, the building was to
consist of a central nave with three or five divi¬
sions for the congregation. The arms of the tran¬
sept were to be built at right angles to the nave,
forming a cross. The apse would house the
bishop's throne (cathedra), which in time gave
its name to the whole building. The general
layout, as flexible as that of the baptistery, could
be adapted to the needs and customs of different
communities. This explains why it was so suc¬
cessful throughout the Roman empire.



The light of God
Artistic efforts were concentrated on the interior
of the building. The exterior typically consisted
of plain unembellished masses. The powerful
dynamic effect achieved in the interior was based
upon a single principle: the columns supporting
the great arcades and architraves, the ceiling and
the floor decoration should all combine to draw
the eyes of the congregation to the altar. Light
filtering through the many openings high up in
the walls should accentuate this horizontal ten¬
sion. Reflected by the marble or alabaster parti¬
tion walls, it would flood through the entire
building, and reverberate from the marble paving,
the mosaic-covered walls and the colonnades.
This new use of light, far from being purely
aesthetic, was a response to the significance given
to it by Christians, for whom light emanates from
God. The apse was given special treatment to
emphasize its position as the focal point of the
building.

### 87199: A Realm of light

The masterbuilders of the fourth century
achieved a kind of dematerialization of architec¬
ture which must have made a powerful impres¬
sion on their contemporaries, who were
accustomed to heavy, dark, inward-looking
buildings. The Christian basilica is open and
outward-looking. Its columns do not compart¬
mentalize the internal space but punctuate it at
rhythmical intervals. It has so many windows
that the link with the celestial world can be made
without difficulty. As the faithful enter the
building, they enter a world which ceases to be
material and becomes spiritual. Imbued with the
presence of God, they participate in the miracle
of the Eucharist celebrated by the bishop.
The church has remained faithful to this ini¬
tial design, with variations, throughout its his¬
tory. Aesthetic transformations sometimes reflect
social changes, and sometimes new choices. As
Christianity spread to the population at large, the
question of the age of baptism began to be raised
in Western Europe. In Carolingian times it was
decided that baptism would take place in child¬
hood. Separate buildings were no longer needed
for those who had not been baptised.
Also, following a major reform of the epis¬
copal administration initiated in the eighth cen¬
tury, the bishop's entourage of clergy were
obliged to live in a community under a rule.
Those who did so were known as canons or
canonical clerks. In the eleventh century Pope
Gregory VII instigated further ecclesiastical
reforms to regulate relations between the lay and
clerical communities. In towns and cities whose
old walls (for the most part built during Antiq¬
uity as protection from barbarian invaders) had
survived, the episcopal palace and the canons'
cloister became an integral part of the cathedral
complex.
In the second half of the twelfth century, as
the bishops became independent of the secular
power, they took their destiny, and that of their
Church, into their own hands. They had to face
a new challenge, that of a rapidly growing popu¬
lation, especially in the towns and cities. The old
walls were breached to make more space. As the
numbers of the faithful grew, massive buildings

were needed to accommodate them. In many
cases cities had to be reshaped to adapt to the new
situation. In Paris the eastern end of the Ile de
la Cité around the Cathedral of Notre-Dame was
transformed after 1670. Some buildings were
moved to different sites, streets were opened up,
and houses were demolished. Similar changes
took place in other French towns such as Laon,
Reims, Rouen and Beauvais.
The 'Temple of the New Covenant'
Firmly anchored in the historic heart of the city,
the cathedral took on a new significance. Bishops
had to find new solutions for a population whose
ideas were changing. Although the cathedral was
still the "Temple of the New Covenant" between
God and His people, the language expressing this
link had to be brought up to date. Determina¬
tion to transmit a clearer message to the faithful
would be expressed in architecture and
iconography.
The style of a façade facing towards the city,
with three portals and a tower each side, was
adopted in Paris, Laon, Sens, Bourges, Reims and
other French cities. A courtyard, usually quite 41

### 87199: A Realm of light

small, marked the transition between the profane
world of the city and the diocese and the sacred
world of the cathedral. The façade was decorated
with sculptures which bore a powerful message.
The iconography was diversified, and the themes
depicted gradually became more humanized.
Spires, massive stonework and other external
features were also a response to the cathedral's
relationship with the city. A cathedral had to be
visible from a distance, and no other building was
allowed to compete with it. At a time when there
were few stone buildings and houses were no
more than one or two storeys high, the cathedral
towered over its surroundings and gave an iden¬
tity to a community whose members shared the
same faith.
The cathedral became the rallying point for
the members of a diversified community. The
nave had to be capable of accommodating all the
faithful of the diocese, even though in practice
this has never been necessary. The choir, usually
an extension of the nave beyond the transept, was
reserved for the canons and their communal life
of prayer. The sanctuary housed the Holy of
Holies, the high altar at which the bishop alone
could officiate. The arms of the transept led
towards the episcopal palace and the canons'
cloister. Barriers separated the different parts of
the building. A rood screen stood between clergy
and congregation, and there was a movable cur¬
tain between the choir and the body of the
church, but these divisions were not enough to
destroy the unity created by the architectural
style.
The concept of unity inherited from Chris¬
tian Antiquity was given new expression. In the
cathedral Gothic architects sought to fuse
different areas which Romanesque architects had



tended to compartmentalize and juxtapose, and
to achieve this purpose they exploited the
unifying role of light. The difficult problem posed
by the heaviness of stone roofing was eventually
solved by the invention of the ribbed vault which
concentrated the thrust at precise points. It
became possible to reduce the thickness of the
walls between the vertical supports, to build them
higher and pierce them with many windows. The
building was suffused with light which, as it
filtered through stained-glass windows and fell on
curved surfaces, produced elusive patterns of
shade but unified the internal space.
The architects of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries tried to achieve the same goal as their
predecessors in the fourth century, albeit through
' different aesthetic choices. They sought to create
cathedrals in the image of the heavenly Jerusalem
described at the end of the Book of Revelation.
Descending out of heaven, it is the "tabernacle
of God among men", resplendent with the most
precious stones. B

I he roofs, cupolas and other ar¬
chitectural features of medieval
Russian churches are so rich in sym¬
bolism that even from afar believers
could identify the spiritual idea to
which each church was dedicated.
The early chronicles tell us that the
oldest Russian churches had more
than five cupolas. The cathedral of
St. Sophia in Novgorod, built in oak
in 989, had thirteen, and the stone
church of the Dormition of Our Lady,
built in Kiev at the turn of the
eleventh century, is reported to have
had twenty-five.
The number of cupolas was always
significant. Six stood for the unity of
the Church Militant and the Church
Triumphant in prayer. Five embodied
the Redeemer and the four Evan¬
gelists, addressing sermons to the
four parts of the world. Seven cupo¬
las stood for the mystical number
seven, which evoked a wealth of
associations including the seven gifts
of the Holy Ghost and the seven days
of Genesis.
Thirteen cupolas denoted Christ,
the embodiment of Heavenly Wis¬
dom, and His twelve disciples, while
the figure twenty-five stems from the
Apocalyptic presentation of the Holy
Trinity through the vision of God on
His throne surrounded with twenty-
four seats on which twenty-four elders
are sittingthe disciples and the
prophets.
The renowned ensemble of monu¬
ments on the island of Kizhi on Lake
Onega in the north of European Rus¬
sia has two multi-cupola'ed churches
and a one-cupola belltower. The total
number of cupolas, thirty-three, sym¬
bolizes the years of the earthly life
of Jesus Christ.
Tent-shaped roofs
The tent-shaped roof has also been
a widespread feature of Russian
church architecture since the early
Middle Ages. Most tent roofs were
eight-sided, representing, with their
cupola, the mystical number nine.
When you look at such a roof from
the ground, you usually see the sides
of three triangles again represent¬
ing the number nine. The roof rising
above the centre of the octahedron
symbolizes God, the centre of the
universe, and is crowned with a
cross, the symbol of Christ. The tent-
roofed churches of the Dormition at
Varzuga on the Kola Peninsula and
Kondopoga in Karelia are particularly
majestic examples of this style. The
roofs symbolize Our Lady enthroned
in Heaven and joining Her Son.
Another architectural feature, the
use of tiers or storeys, became
widespread in the latter half of the
seventeenth century. Cubes, octa¬
gons and other volumes were ar¬
ranged in a series of superimposed
storeys, gradually tapering towards
the top to produce an impression of
vertical heavenward movement. The
tiers, or storeys, stood for the unity
of the Church Militant and the Church
Triumphant, with the heavenly struc¬
ture ascending to the throne of the
Creator. The gradual tapering effect
reflected the diminishing number of
souls acquiring greater degrees of
sainthness. As Jesus said, "Many are
called, but few are chosen." Churches
with elongated storeys which taper
only gradually were known as pillar
churches. Storeyed and pillar

### 87200: Symbolism in wood and stone

churches embodied the Christian
symbol of Jacob's Ladder, the stages
of the spiritual struggle to moral per¬
fection described in The Ladder of
Divine Ascent by the sixth-century
monk St. John Climacus. It is thus not
surprising that Russia's most majes¬
tic pillar church, the Belfry of Ivan
Veliky in the Kremlin, Moscow,
should be dedicated to this saint. Its
superb set of bells (blagovest, the an¬
nunciator of blessed news) symbo¬
lize the mission of Our Lady as the
ladder by which God descended into
this world, connecting the Annunci¬
ation of the New Testament with
Jacob's Ladder of the Old. Stone
tiered churches often had sets of
bells in the upper tier. Among the
finest of them is the church of the
Intercession of Our Lady in the
Moscow suburb of Fill.
Flamboyant churches, typified by
the use of round or pointed arches
known as kokoshniki, began to be
built in Russia in the fifteenth cen
tury. At first structural features but
later purely decorative additions to
the main dome, kokoshniki symbolize
the tongues of heavenly fire and are
a metaphor for the heavenly host.
The profusion of these features and
the variety of their shapes stand for
the variety and number of angels and
saints. The main cubic body of the
edifice embodied the Church Militant,
the upper part with its kokoshniki the
Church Triumphant, and the cupola
above them God, Head of the Church.
The earliest flamboyant churches
were built in honour of important
historical events, and the first fully
accomplished example of the style
can be seen in two naves of the
Church of the Transformation of Our
Lord built in the 1520s on the site
of the church erected by prince
Dmitri Donskoy to commemorate his
victory over the Tatars at the battle
of Kulikovo in 1380. In the mid-
sixteenth century, victories over the
Tatars in Kazan and Astrakhan were
commemorated with the addition of
four similar naves to the Cathedral
of the Holy Trinity in Moscow's Red
Square, wrongly known as the Church
of St. Basil the Blessed.
Some churches incorporate several
styles. The Church of the Transfigu¬
ration of Our Lord at Ostrovo near
Moscow is a fantastic blend of the
tent-roof, flamboyant and multi-
cupola styles. The greatest achieve¬
ment of old Russian architecture, the
Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Red
Square, is also a remarkable blend of
styles. The whole structure is ar¬
ranged around the tent-roofed
Church of the Intercession of Our
Lady, with pillar naves on each of the
four sides, a flamboyant nave at each
of the four corners, and a sumptu¬
ous cluster of ornate cupolas above
the whole. The Cathedral is the quin¬
tessential expression of the Russian
concept of the Christian Church.

In the past, the
Unesco Courier
has often given coverage
to questions relating to
the environment and
natural resources, fields
in which Unesco has
been active ever since it
was founded. Now, at a
time of growing concern
about environmental
problems, we intend to
publish from time to time
reports on the major
issues involved.

Our small blue planet
BY MICHEL BATISSE
HaIardly a day goes by without
bringing news of an environmental
problem of some kind. What with pol¬
luted rivers, disappearing animal spe¬
cies, oil spills in Alaska and the
destruction of the Amazonian rain¬
forest, something always seems to
be going wrong in the sphere of what
we often rather inaccurately refer to
as ecology. We are overwhelmed by
this constant avalanche of threats
and disruptions. We are not sure how
important the problems really are
and sometimes even wonder
whether they exist. In many cases
the scientists seem uncertain of their
ground and, to the delight of scep¬
tics, their opinions diverge.
Many people claim that they are
ready to help safeguard the environ¬
ment but most of them change their
tune as soon as there is any possi¬
bility that they may have to alter their
habits. Whenever there is a problem,
people tend to blame the govern¬
ment or industry, the rich or the poor,
often their neighbours but never
themselves. Media sensationalism
diverts attention from the delicate
long-term processes that cause the
most significant changes in our com¬
plex world. Faced with this mass of
MICHEL BATISSE,
French engineer and physicist, is
internationally known for his work on
the environment and natural resources.
A former Unesco staff member, he was
instrumental in launching the
International Hydrological Decade
(1965-1974) and Unesco's
interdisciplinary Man and the Biosphere
(MAB) programme Currently a
consultant with Unesco and with the
United Nations Environment
Programme, he has headed the Blue
Plan Regional Activity Centre for the
Mediterranean at Sophia Antipolis,
France, since it was created in 1985.
highly diversified and widespread en¬
vironmental problems, we feel that
they are linked in some way but
how?
Misunderstanding of the underly¬
ing causes of the environmental
problems that face both industrial¬
ized and developing countries leads
to a certain intellectual confusion.
Piecemeal measures in specific sit¬
uations are only partially effective
and even sometimes make the situ¬
ation worse, but do not provide a last¬
ing solution.
A far-reaching concept
The concept of the environment is so
vast that we are often inclined to nar¬
row it down. It is not confined to air
and water pollution and the protec¬
tion of nature. When we talk about
the environment we refer to every¬
thing around usthe homes and
workplaces where we spend most of
our time and the cities in which more
than half the world's population now
lives. It also englobes the country
side, forests, countries, oceans,
deserts and ultimately the planet as
a whole which, as we now realize, is
being adversely affected by human
activity. The environment is thus not
only the so-called natural areas,
which have themselves often been
shaped to some extent by our ances¬
tors, but the man-made locations in
which most people live and work.
This physical environment is objec¬
tive in the sense that it can be ob¬
served and measured. Its functioning
and development can be analysed by
such sciences as chemistry, geolo¬
gy and biology (especially by ecolo¬
gy, the branch of biology which deals
with the relations between living
creatures and their habitat). We are
all part of this objective environment,
and we all perceive it in our own
necessarily subjective way. What one
person regards as an excessive
degree of pollution, another may find
acceptable. Such perceptions,
whether individual or collective, play
an important role in determining both
The biosphere and tome of the pressure* on It.
individual behaviour and the action
taken by public institutions, since
they shape our spontaneous reac¬
tions to our physical environment
and determine the hierarchy of
values we attach to its component
parts. Hunting wild animals, for ex¬
ample, has been regarded in differ¬
ent ways by different cultures at
different times.
Debates about the environment
are often difficult for objective rea¬
sons since they involve conflicts of
material interest. They are complicat¬
ed still further by the widely differ¬
ent emotional and cultural reactions
of those who take part. This is
another reason why we should try to
find a common cause.
Biosphere and technosphere
It will be a long time before we know
whether forms of life exist in distant
galaxies. All the life we know today
is confined to what is known as the
biospherethe Earth's surface and
the thin atmospheric envelope
around it. The biosphere includes all
the living creatures on land, in the
sea and in the lower atmosphere, and
all the exchanges and bio-geo-
chemical processes that make life on
Earth possible. As biological crea¬
tures we inescapably form part of it.
Assaults on the biosphere may well
affect us, and especially our health.
Ever since the dawn of time the bi¬
osphere has been a prey to natural
phenomena such as earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions. Today,
however, the most damaging attacks
are of human origin. For a very long
time our only strength was that of hu¬
man muscle, but in the last few cen¬
turies as a result of advances in
scientific knowledge we have learned 47

## [Page 48](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/087205engo.pdf#page=48) 0

### 87201: Our small blue planet

to master increasingly powerful tech¬
nologies. In the last few decades our
technical knowledge in agriculture,
industry and medicine and in such
diverse fields as genetics, energy,
transport and health care has spread
worldwide and encompassed almost
the whole of the biosphere. This
phenomenon, which may be called
the technosphere, is a dense and
multi-faceted network of technology
from which no place on Earth can to¬
tally escape, not even the Antarctic
which is affected by air pollution and
the intrusion of tourists and oil-
tankers.
We use these technologies in what
we consider to be our own interests,
the interests of the group to which
we belong, or those of mankind as
a whole. The consequences of this
intelligent use of geographical space,
natural resources and the process¬
es of life itself have been demo¬
graphic growth, the improvement of
living conditions, and the flowering
of modern civilization the process
which is rather loosely described as
development. The fruits of this
process are irreplaceable and it is
inconceivable that they should be
rejected wholesale. At the same time,
however, the structure and function¬
ing of the biosphere are being
affected by a number of unexpected
and perverse consequences of this
massive use of technology. Of
course the more powerful the effects
of technology and the more widely
it is used, the more the biosphere
suffers.
Sociosphere and noosphere
An environmental problem may be
defined as an assault of some kind by
the technosphere on the biosphere.
Such problems may include soil ero¬
sion, desertification, deforestation,
toxic wastes, acid rain, the possibili¬
ty of global warming, risks of cancer,
high noise levels, deterioration of the
urban environment and indeed of any
phenomenon that affects the human
race. The development process has
brought undoubted benefits but,
through inadvertence or negligence,
it is having increasingly important
negative effects on the biosphere
and on mankind which biologically
forms part of the biosphere. The de¬
terioration of the environment is sim¬
ply the other side of the development
coin, the negative side which has
long been ignored.
The technosphere and develop¬
ment are not, however, autonomous.
They are the products of another
sphere, the sociosphere, which con¬
sists of the legal, political, econom¬
ic, social and professional institutions
that constitute human society. The
sociosphere uses and disseminates
technology. It is responsible for the
choice of different forms of develop
ment. Through the development of
the global economy it is slowly im¬
posing a system of planetary
management. And so the sociosphere
is responsible for safeguarding the
environment.
How are decisions taken in the so¬
ciosphere? This is a somewhat
opaque area where rational analysis
is not always possible. It belongs to
another sphere, the world of ideas,
which may be termed the noosphere,
and from which cultures, religions
and civilizations are derived. It is at
this level that, in some mysterious
way, our perceptions, behaviour and
aspirations about development and
the environment are shaped.
This method of studying environ¬
mental problems by working back¬
wards from effects to causes shows
that all environmental problems have
common origins. It also suggests
that we should try to reestablish the
harmony of the four spheres.
The four pillars of wisdom
Every society organizes its own ter¬
ritory in accordance with its tradi¬
tions and resources, as if organizing
a big household. Each house rests on
four pillars, population (the number
of people living in it), natural
resources (the goods and services
that can be taken from nature using
available technology), the environ¬
ment (in its physical sense) and eco-

nomic and social development. If one
pillar rises disproportionately, the
house loses its balance. A critical sit¬
uation soon arises, as we saw recent¬
ly in the Sahel, where too many
people are overburdening a shrink¬
ing resource base and the environ¬
ment is suffering as a result of
inappropriate forms of development.
With today's global markets and
the speed of modern transport and
communications systems, the whole
planet is our common home. Condi¬
tions are not the same for everyone,
far from it, but everyone is involved
in the same process. The pillars sup¬
porting our common home are start¬
ing to lean sideways. The population
pillar is still rising dangerously, espe¬
cially in the poor countries, and is un¬
likely to stop doing so as long as their
poverty persists. The development
pillar has become a pattern of fran¬
tic consumption of space, energy
and goods according to a develop¬
ment model that was invented by the
rich countries and is not applicable
to humanity at large. Resources such
as water and food can barely keep
pace with population growth and de¬
velopment needs. They only manage
to do so to the detriment of the
fourth pillar, the environment, which
is under attack from all sidesby
dams, fertilizers, pesticides, forest
destruction, soil exhaustion and pol¬
lution of all kinds, and at the global
! ' u>-
%
level the climate and the ozone lay¬
er are being affected.
Everyone who has thought about
the matter agrees that it is high time
we put our house in order. But not
everyone agrees about how we
should approach the task since in
terms of the distribution of wealth all
are not on the same footing. The in¬
dustrialized countries ask the coun¬
tries of the South to slow down their
demographic growth and take care
of their environment. The poor coun¬
tries reply that inequalities in terms
of trade must first of all be reduced
so that they too can develop, and be¬
fore the poorest peoples can enjoy
the leisure to protect forests and
animals. This difficult debate in which
each side sends the ball back into the
other's court has made only slow
progress in the last twenty years.
Today however there is a widespread
feeling that "our common future" is
at stake and that long-term models
for the development of the environ¬
ment and natural resources must be
worked out as quickly as possible.
This new climate of opinion is en¬
couraging and we must hope that the
United Nations Conference on the
Environment and Development
scheduled to take place in Brazil in
June 1992 will lay the foundations
for an agreement on this question of
vital importance for all the inhabi¬
tants of our small blue planet. Major
changes will have to be made in the
sociosphere and the noosphere and
these will not be easily accepted by
everyone. In the coming months the
Unesco Courier will be examining
some of the key issues involved in
this great debate.

### 87243: Franciscus Skorina: scholar-printer of the Renaissance

ANNIVERSARY
Franciscus Skorina,
scholar-printer of the Renaissance
BY M. BOTVINNIK AND V. SHMATOV
Iranciscus Skorina, archetypical
figure of Byelorussian culture, was
the first to translate, provide a com¬
mentary, print and publish the Bible
in the language of the east Slavs.
He was born 500 years ago into a
fur and hide trader's family at
Polotsk, a city known to have existed
since the ninth century. His educa¬
tion began there, but it was at
Cracow University from 1504 to
1506 that he studied the "seven
liberal arts"grammar, logic, rhetor¬
ic, music, arithmetic, geometry and
astronomy as well as philosophy.
There is no further trace of him
until 1512, when he took his doc¬
torate in medicine at the University
of Padua in Italy. Medical practice did
not appeal to him, however. Model¬
ling himself on St. Luke, who after
healing men's bodies dedicated him¬
self to healing their souls, Skorina
embarked on the translation of the
Scriptures into the Slavic language.
In 1517, he left for Prague, where
he spent two and a half years. His
first publication was a psalter, at that
time used as a reading primer, fol¬
lowed by his translation of twenty-
two books of the Old Testament,
which he called "The Russian Bible".
This was a considerable achieve¬
ment, as the work consisted of 2,400
pages of text, forty-nine engravings.
and hundreds of decorative vignettes,
initials and finíais. Skorina wrote
twenty-five prefaces and twenty-four
postfaces which were something
more than mere commentaries on
the text; they provided clear and top¬
ical interpretations of biblical al¬
legories and parables. In this way
Skorina introduced his readers to the
humanist ideas of the great Renais¬
sance thinkers.
The format adopted for his Bible
was remarkably simple, with a clear
and legible typeface. He avoided cer¬
tain rarely-used characters and liga¬
tures, and employed the minimum of
diacritical marks to make reading
easier. The layout was more function¬
al than decorative, with illustrations
closely linked to the text which they
helped to clarify.
It is not surprising that Skorina's
works were very popular, yet they
shocked some Church dignitaries. He
is thought to have been accused of
heresy and obliged to leave Prague
and go back to his own country. In
Wilno (Vilnius), capital of the great
principality of Lithuania, he set up a
printing press (the first in what is now
the USSR) in the house of a Byelorus¬
sian patron of the arts, and in 1 522
published a computus, a set of tables
for calculating movable dates in the
ecclesiastical calendar, followed in
1525 by an edition of the Acts of the
Apostleshis last known printed
book.
In 1525, Skorina abruptly left Wilno
and set out on a long journey from
town to town and from patron to pa¬
tron which eventually took him back
to Prague, a city dear to his heart. He
seems to have looked after the royal
botanical garden there, one of the
richest in Europe, but after the middle
of the century all trace of him is lost.
M. BOTVINNIK, Soviet historian, is a
researcher at the Institute of Arts,
Ethnography and Folklore of the
Academy of Sciences of the
Byelorussian SSR He is co-author of
"Franciscus Skorina, Humanist, Civilizer
and First Printer" (1989).
V. SHMATOV is a researcher
at the Institute of Arts, Ethnography
and Folklore of the Academy of
Sciences of the Byelorussian SSR. He
has published some 90 studies on the
aesthetic aspects of Franciscus
Skorina's publications and on
Byelorussian graphic design of the 16th
to 18th centuries.

Russian Bible printed by Franciscus
Skorina between 1517 and 1519,

Kings.
