Lost face from the Chimu
This 90 cm. high, wooden statuette is the work of the Chimu, a people whose empire flourished
from the 13th to the 15th century on the northern coast of Peru. Chanchan, the Chimu capital,
near present-day Trujillo, was a great cultural and trading centre covering 18 square kilometres.
Today Chanchan is a monument in peril. This great archaeological site, one of the most impor¬
tant of the pre-lnca pediod, has suffered greatly from the depredations of grave-robbers and
archaeological thieves, despite persistent efforts on the part of the Peruvian authorities to
prevent such pillage. The statuette above is preserved in the National Museum of Anthropo¬
logy and Ethnology, Lima. Peru.

'PORTUGUESE' AFRICA
THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE
Twenty-five years ago, on December 10 1948, the United
Nations General Assembly proclaimed the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. To mark this anniversary,
the "Unesco Courier" has this year already devoted
two Issues to the international defence of human
rights: "The Threat to Privacy" (July 1973) and "40
Million Child-workers in the World Today" (October
1973). Our present number looks at the struggle for
independence of the African people in the Portuguese-
administered territories of Africa. Cover shows an
African freedom-fighter in a liberated area of Angola.
NEW PRICE OF THE UNESCO COURIER
The continued rise in production and distribution costs
has made it necessary to increase the price of the
UNESCO COURIER.
From January I. 1974
our new rate will be as follows:
Annual subscription : 24 French francs
Single copy price: 2.40 French francs
We are sure that all readers will understand the need
for these measures and will continue to support the
UNESCO COURIER not only by renewing their sub¬
scriptions, but also by offering gift subscriptions to
friends and relatives. Readers are assured that the
Editors will do their best to present each month an
informative, provocative periodical of the highest
editorial standards.
Unesco s National Distributors (see list page 35) will inform
subscribers of equivalent rates in other currencies.

LFRICA's problems of today
are sometimes described as being
those of the transition from ways and
ideas of the more or less distant past
to ways and ideas of the modern
world. This idea of transition is a
useful one, at least so long as one
keeps in mind that the ways and ideas
of Africa's more or less distant past
were valid forms of civilization, in their
day and age, and not some kind of
hopeless barbarism.
But there may be a better definition
for Africa's problems of today, espe¬
cially in those large regions that are
still under foreign rule, whether colo¬
nial or racist. I suggest that these
BASIL DAVIDSON, British writer and his¬
torian, Is one of the most respected world
authorities on African history and contem¬
porary affairs and has published 17 books
on Africa since 1950. He has closely studied
the history and current situation of Indepen¬
dence movements In Portuguese African
colonies and has several times visited liber¬
ated areas of these territories: Guinea (Bissau)
(1967 and 1972), Mozambique (1968) and
Angola (1970). His "Uberation of Guiñé"
(with a preface by Amilcar Cabrai) was pub.-
lished in 1969, and "In the Eye of the Storm:
Angola's People' In 1972.
problems are really those of the
renewal of indigenous processes of
social and cultural development: of
the renewal, that is, of processes which
were already in existence before the
period of foreign rule but which were
stopped and distorted by the conse¬
quences of foreign rule, and remain
so to this day.
Essentially, then, these are the
developmental problems of a genuine
and effective democratization within
the framework of modernizing institu¬
tions. Looked at in this light, the
problems of the inhabitants of the Por¬
tuguese colonies, a total of some
fifteen million Africans and about half
a million Portuguese and other Euro¬
pean settlers or employees, appear in
all their difficulty.
The position of these Africans is a
rather special one, though possessing
obvious parallels with that of their
neighbours in Rhodesia and South
Africa. This specialness doesn't arise
from the antiquity of Portugal's adven¬
tures in Africa, for the story of Portu¬
guese colonialism is little different in
its broad outlines from that of any
other colonial power.

It's true, of course, that Portuguese
soldiers were able to seize and mini¬
mally colonize a few coastal areas of
Angola and Mozambique as long ago
as the 16th century, while others
pushed up the valley of the Zambezi
as far as Sena and Tete, where they
had founded settlements before 1600.
But the effective colonial occupation
of these vast territories of Angola and
Mozambique, and of the smaller terri¬
tory of West African Guiñé (the old
"Rios do Cabo Verde"), began only

In the 1890s and was not made com¬
plete until the 1920s.
The specialness arises from some¬
thing else. It arises from the nature
of the Portuguese colonial system and
ethos, and above all from their refusal
to make any least concession to the
claims of African equality and sov¬
ereignty in- Africa.
The motivations of those who govern
Portugal are various and interesting.
But whatever they are their stern
intransigence and words far less
polite could reasonably be used, and
often are has enormously enhan¬
ced the problems of modernization.
This intransigence has meant that
the necessary journey "into the modern
world" of the Africans whom they
rule cannot begin so long as they
remain in command.
Within the Portuguese system these
Africans may be able, if rarely, to
acquire the elements of modern edu¬
cation, but it will only be an education
designed to serve the ends of Portu
guese nationalism. These Africans
may be able to participate in moderniz¬
ing forms of economic activity, but
once again it will only be as servants
or subordinates of an economy design¬
ed to benefit Portugal.
The present Prime Minister of Por¬
tugal, Professor Marcello Caetano, has
explained why. "The natives of Africa",

statement of 1954, never since modi¬

On September 24,

auxiliaries. The blacks must be seen
as productive elements organized, or
to be organized, in an economy direct¬
ed by whites", (,0s Nativos na
Economía Africana, Coimbra 1954),
Denied the hope of peaceful change,
the "natives of Africa", as we know,
have chosen armed resistance rather
than continued surrender to foreign
rule, just as the natives of other conti¬
nents have done in situations not
dissimilar.
Much has been written about this
armed resistance, but really it is not
the interesting or important part of the
story. That part lies in the use which
the movements of resistance have
made of areas, large or small, from
which they have evicted Portuguese
control. There, at last, they have
been able to begin to run their own
affairs, and, in doing that, to forge new
institutions and structures of society
that can underpin the needs of mat¬
erial and cultural progress.
Here, in other words, the tasks of
democratization within modernizing
frameworks are being tackled for the
first time in these territories. No
longer "auxiliaries" of the colonial
system, Africans in these liberated
areas can stand on their own feet and
face the challenge of their own
problems.
What do you find in these liberated
areas? Many visitors from many coun¬
tries, and of many political loyalties,
have gone there to discover the ans¬
wer. Almost all their reports, whether
enthusiastic or sceptical, "committed"
or neutral or even hostile, are in
substantial agreement on the essence
of the matter (1). They find long-
deprived peoples who are caught up
in a major effort to modernize their
lives, and to rule themselves in ways
that are as different from their own
ways of the more, or less distant past
as from the ways of colonial rule.
These peoples apparently see no
gain in working for a mere reform of
colonial structures and institutions, for
no such reform, as they often say, can
set them free. What they are engag¬
ed upon is something greater and
more useful. They define this by what
they do and aim for, but their leading
spokesmen have also defined it in
words which have the ring of profound
meditation. They are fortunate in
having found spokesmen and leaders
of an often remarkable and momentous
talent.
Thus the late Amilcar Cabrai, found¬
er and outstanding leader of the
PAIGC in Guiñé and the Cape Verde
Islands, is the author of writings now
widely recognized as significant con¬
tributions to the theory of social change
among so-called "under-developed"
peoples.
He has described the movements of
liberation as comprising "a forced
march on the road to cultural pro¬
gress", because the compulsions of
armed resistance have here found
their most positive element in the
(1) After an initial visit to colonial Angola
in 1954, the present writer has so far made
four visits to liberated areas: to those of
the liberation movement in Guinea (Bissau)
and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in 1967, to those
of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FREL1MO)
in Mozambique in 1968, to those of the
People's Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) In Angola In 1970, and again
to Guinea (Bissau) in 1972.
drive for , and achievement of new
understandings, new ideas, new modes
of individual and community behaviour,
and, with all this, a new means of
mastering the problems of national
freedom (A. Cabrai, National Libera¬
tion and Culture, lecture delivered at
Syracuse University, New York, Feb.
20, 1970. See also article page 12).
And they have done this because
these movements are nothing if not
movements of voluntary participation.
They are "schools of progress" even
more than they are fighting units or
other means of self-defence.
Or consider a definition of what
these liberated areas are really about
that comes from the Angolan leader,
Dr Agostinho Neto. What they are
trying to do, he said in 1970, "is to
free and modernize our peoples by a
dual revolution against their tradi¬
tional structures which can no longer
serve them, and against colonial rule."
Their aim, in other words, is not
only to displace the Portuguese who
claim to rule them but to build a
new society: to found and develop
institutions of self-rule whose demo¬
cratic and modernizing vitality can
overcome not only the heritage of
foreign autocracy, but also the heri¬
tage of an older Africa divided into
small groups and rival ethnic states.
One may well think this a bold and
unexpected aim to find among peoples
so sorely ravaged and harassed by
military repression and all its accom¬
panying evils, yet this is none the less
the aim that visitors have all agreed
that they have found here.
But what does it look like on the
ground, this "forced march on the road

### 51837: The Struggle for independence of 'Portuguese' Africa: 15 million Africans in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea (Bissau) in search of a new identity
to cultural progress"? What you find,
obviously, differs much according to
time and place, for all this has to take
place in the midst of wars of repression
that are savagely pursued.
Some liberated areas have long
been safe from any effective enemy
intervention, and there you find the
building of a new society already far
advanced. Other areas are newly
wrested from the enemy, or subject
to frequent ground-raids and bombing
forays; there you find that the work
is often interrupted, and sometimes at
an early stage. But although the
momentary contrasts are many, the
policies and "atmosphere" are strik¬
ingly the same. All three movements
are in close touch with one another,
and have the same basic approaches.
Two examples from my own experi¬
ence. Travelling in 1970 through
areas of eastern Angola under MPLA
control, I coincided with one of the
Portuguese Army's periodical "sweeps
in force". The MPLA's fighting units
there were on the move and so, in
consequence, was the local population
that look to these units for protection.
Woodland villages were abandoned
for the time being; social services,
such as schools and medical services,
were likewise disrupted.
Weeks would pass before things
could be put together again. It was
a trying time, and bore witness to the
sufferings caused by these colonial
wars. Yet the national movement
remained in being, whether in its fight¬
ing units, its village committees, or
its co-ordinated groups of workers con¬
cerned with this or that social and
cultural activity, and could settle back
to its work again as soon as the
danger had passed.
In areas long safe from danger the
picture is a different one. Last winter
I spent some time in the Como sector
of southern Guiñé. From this sector
the Portuguese were completely evict¬
ed in 1965, and had not been able to
return. So for seven years the people
of Como had been free to work at
the building of their new society.
They had gone far towards it. Long-
established village committees, all of
them elected from local people, had
an uninterrupted responsibility toge¬
ther with the full-time workers of their
national movement, the PAIGC, for
every aspect of public affairs, educa¬
tional or medical, legal or political.
Here and elsewhere, even before
the independence of Guiñé was offi¬
cially proclaimed, a new state was
already in existence, a new society
was already taking shape, and in an
atmosphere of calm and confidence
that seemed continou'sly impressive.
Statistics can ten a little
of this story. By 1972, for example,
the PAIGC had promoted enough
schools and trained enough teachers
to give some 8,500 boys and girls the
elements of a modern education They
had even carried through a general
election for a sovereign National
Assembly by direct and secret ballot
in wide-ranging liberated areas.
Similar statistics from the liberated
areas of Angola and Mozambique can
usefully add to the picture.' It is also
clear that much more could be achiev
ed if the means were to hand, whether
in trained personnel or material neces¬
sities, and especially the second.
Yet the living reality that unfolds
before you in these plains and forests,
swamps and woodlands, goes beyond
the statistics, even very far beyond.
Whether in large liberated areas or in
small, strongly held or subject to
repeated raids and bombing, here are
"backward" people who have become
determined to win free from their
"backwardness", and to understand
the world as it really is.
These are people who are working
to achieve this by setting aside the
blinkers of tradition or subjection,
racism or "tribalism", despair or lack
of self-belief. And this they are doing
by a process of voluntary participation
in the changing of their lives and
thoughts.
No-one who travels in these areas
will come back with any impression of
utopia. Far from that, daily life is
harsh in toil and hunger or the threat
of violent death. Not everyone under¬
stands what is being attempted. Many
confusions remain, and no doubt will
do so for long to come. The timid
withdraw, the fools betray.
All things natural to the human con¬
dition are present here. Yet these
things include clarity and courage,
steadfastness and hope, while the
unrelenting growth and expansion of
these movements suggest that these
are the qualities which prevail. These
movements of renewal could not other¬
wise have gained their remarkable
success. It is a success that looks to
the rest of the world for understanding,
and so for aid and friendship.

Mozambique serves as a reservoir of unskilled labour for South Africa, noted a report submitted
to the U.N. General Assembly in 1966. The report also stated that in southern Africa indigenous
workers were paid from five to fifteen times less than white workers. According to FRELIMO,
the Mozambique Liberation Front, "the South African Government pays the whole of the worker's
wages to the Portuguese Government which deducts various taxes, including a so-called protection
tax, before paying the Mozambican worker in escudos." Above, a worker from Mozambique at the

### 51838: The United Nations versus the world's 'last colonial empire'
THE UNITED NATIONS
VERSUS
THE WORLD'S
'LAST COLONIAL EMPIRE'
F the 28 million people
still living in dependent status through¬
out the world, half live in the Portu¬
guese territories in Africa.
In the last 28 years 71 colonial
territories, comprising nearly 1,000
million people, have become indepen¬
dent and taken their place among the
sovereign nations of the world (see
map pages 28-29).
There are many reasons for this
phenomenon. Principally it is due to
the sometimes tempered, sometimes
violent challenge that the dependent
peoples themselves have brought to
bear on the long-accepted view that
they should continue to be ruled by
remote foreign Powers whose cultural,
ideological and ethnic identities were
different from their own. Largely
because of this challenge, there has
evolved a world-wide recognition that
self-determination and- independence
are not the exclusive prerogatives of
the powerful, but fundamental and
inalienable rights of all peoples every¬
where.
The right to self-determination had
become almost a universally accepted
principle in 1960 when the General
Assembly of the United Nations adopt¬
ed an historic manifesto on decoloni¬
zation which gave a further impetus to
the movement of dependent peoples
toward freedom and independence.
Yet, today, there remains a hard
core of resistance to the recognition
of these rights in the vast territories
of southern Africa. South Africa's
harsh apartheid laws continue to dis¬
criminate against an overwhelming
non-white majority, which includes
those living in the immense territory
of Namibia (formerly South West
Africa). 225.000 white settlers in
Southern Rhodesia have rebelled
against the British Commonwealth, in
order to perpetuate their domination
and control of nearly five million
Africans.
In southern Africa also, Portugal
refuses to relinquish control of both
Angola and Mozambique, territories
which are roughly twenty times its
size. In fact it is waging an endless
war against the liberation movements
of these territories and against natio¬
nalist groups in the small territory of
Portuguese Guinea on the west coast
of Africa.
This struggle is significant since the
Portuguese possessions comprise the
last colonial empire remaining in the
world. Moreover, these territories are
strategically located. In the west,
Angola (population 5,223,000) stands
astride the route from Zaire to South
West Africa and South Africa. In
the east, Mozambique (population
7,040,000) guards the heartland of
both South Africa and Southern Rho¬
desia.
Both territories are wealthy. Angola,
which is more than twice the size of
France (481,226 square miles) has rich
oil deposits, vast diamond mines and
hundreds of millions of tons of high
grade iron ore. It is the world's
fourth largest coffee producer. Mozam¬
bique (297,654 square miles) also has
great economic potential because of
its large areas of fertile land, its ports
and railways and its sources of hydro¬
electric power.
The other territories now under
Portuguese administration are the
Cape Verde archipelago comprising
ten islands off the west African coast,
and the islands of Sao Tomé and
Principe, located on the Bay of Biafra,
west of the Republic of Gabon, and
Macao and Timor in Asia.
The Portuguese Constitution defines
the Territory of Portugal as that which
at present belongs to it and comprises:
B In Europe : the mainland and the
archipelagos of Madeira and the
Azores;
In west Africa: the Cape Verde
archipelago, Guinea, Sao Tomé
and Principe and their depen¬
dencies, Sao Joao Baptista de
Ajudé, Cabinda and Angola;
In east Africa: Mozambique;
In Asia : Macao and its depen¬
dencies;
In Oceania : Timor and its depen¬
dencies.
Until 1961, the majority of the indi¬
genous inhabitants in Angola, Mozam¬
bique and Portuguese Guinea were
not accorded full citizenship status.
The Colonial Act of 1933 had accorded
these inhabitants what may, for con¬
venience, be described as "indígena"
status. As subsequently re-enacted
in the Native Statute of 1954:
"A person shall be considered an
indígena... if he is a member of the
negro race or a descendant of a
member of that race, and was born,
or habitually resides, in the province
but does not yet possess the level
of education or the personal and
social habits which are a condition
for the unrestricted application for
the public and private law pertaining
to Portuguese citizens."
An African could change his status
and acquire Portuguese citizenship if
he fulfilled all the following:
he was over 18 years of age;
he could speak the Portuguese
language correctly;
he was engaged in an occupation,
trade or craft from which he derived
sufficient income to support himself
and his family, or had adequate
resources for this purpose;
he was of good conduct and had
attained the level of education and
acquired the habits which are a condi¬
tion for the unrestricted application of
the public and private law pertaining Q
to Portuguese citizens; and V
he was not on record as having
refused to perform military service or

deserted. Upon fulfilment of these
requirements, an African was accorded
citizenship as an "assimilado".
As a result the majority of Africans
living in the three territories were not
accorded Portuguese citizenship and
were not governed by Portuguese
civil law. As a rule, indigenous per¬
sons were governed by "the usages
and customs pertaining to their res¬
pective societies" and were not grant¬
ed political rights in "non-indigenous
institutions".
The special status of an indígena
carried with it an implication that he
was not "civilized". Census figures
listed the population in two major
sections, the civilizado (civilized) and
nao-civilizado (non-civilized). The civi¬
lized section of the population includ¬
ed all persons of European origin
(Portuguese and aliens). Indians and
Chinese, mesticos (persons of mixed
European and African descent) and
Africans who qualified as "civilized"
Until he acquired the status of an
assimilado, an African was not count¬
ed as a "civilized" person. At the
1950 census, less than one per cent
of the African population in Angola
and Mozambique were officially classi¬
fied as "civilized".
The indígena status also carried with
it economic and social implications.
The indígena status made it an obli¬
gation for an African to work and,
through the operation of the labour
laws, frequently subjected him to for¬
ced labour both for public works and
private enterprises, as in the forced
cultivation of cotton which at one time
involved some 500,000 Africans in
Mozambique.
HE rise of nationalist
movements in the Portuguese terri¬
tories had its origin before the Second
World War when Africans attempted
to give expression to grievances by
pressing for moderate reforms through
legal associations. After the Second
World War, these organizations urged
direct participation of the urban masses
in the affairs of the territories. The
Government, however, reacted by
replacing elected leaders with admi¬
nistrative appointees and by restrict¬
ing the political activities of these
organizations.
In Angola, these measures led to
the establishment of underground
political organizations which extended
their activities both inside and outside
the territory. Between 1950 and 1960
clandestine political movements were
also formed in Portuguese Guinea and
Mozambique. These organizations
were generally regarded by the Govern¬
ment as subversive and were sup¬
pressed by force.
From that time, several strikes were
organized by workers to demand
higher wages and police action in¬
creased. In 1959, for example, the
authorities opened fire on dock work¬
ers on strike at Pidgiguiti (Bissau) and
fifty people were killed.
United Nations involvement began
on February 24, 1956 when the Secre¬
tary-General addressed a letter to 16
new Member States, including Portu¬
gal. He inquired whether these states
had any territories which did not fully
govern themselves, since Chapter XI
of the U.N. Charter obliges Member
States to accept a series of obliga¬
tions towards territories administered
by them.
Portugal replied that it had no such
territories, that the territories it admi¬
nistered were in fact integral pro¬
vinces of metropolitan Portugal. It
maintained, as it has ever since, that
under its unitary Constitution the
European and "overseas province's"
were under the same organs of
sovereignty and had exactly the same
status from both a legal and de facto
point of view. It argued that although
political rights in the territories were
dependent on certain qualifications,
these qualifications were the same for
all inhabitants, regardless of race or
situation.
After disturbances that broke out
on February 4, 1961 in the Angolan
capital of Luanda, the Portuguese
authorities adopted special security
measures and imposed censorship on
outgoing messages, and the entry of
foreign journalists was suspended
until the end of July 1961.
At the request of Liberia and 26
African and Asian States, the U.N.
Security Council met from March 10
to 15, 1961, to deal with the "crisis
in Angola".
Denying that the Luanda outbreak
had any connexion with human rights,
the Portuguese representative main¬
tained that in the Portuguese "multi¬
racial society" there was no colour or
religious bar by law, tradition or appli¬
cation and that "human rights are at
the very foundation of our political
and social structure".
The situation in Angola continued
to worsen. According to the Govern¬
ment of Portugal a "wave of terrorism"
occurred in mid-March when a series
of rebel attacks took place in northern
Angola. The Portuguese Govern¬
ment dispatched large reinforcements
of troops to Angola in April 1961.
The situation in Angola was again
brought to the attention of the Secu¬
rity Council in May 1961 by 44 African
and Asian States. The 44 States
declared that massacres were con
tinuing, human rights were being con¬
tinually suppressed and the situation
was a serious threat to international
peace and security. This was the first
U.N. resolution on Portuguese terri¬
tories.
The gravity of the situation in the
territory was reflected in the toll of
lives lost. By early June 1961, Por¬
tuguese reports indicated that about
1,000 Europeans and 8,000 Africans
had been killed. Other estimates of
the number of Africans killed were
considerably higher; a figure of about
30,000 was frequently mentioned
during the Security Council debates
in June 1961.
Following the outbreaks of distur¬
bances in Angola and United Nations
pressure on Portugal to change its
policies, Portugal introduced what it
called "far-reaching reforms" in its
territories, beginning in September
1961, the most important being the
repeal of the Native Statute.
As a result of this repeal, the Afri¬
can inhabitants of the three territories
were recognized as Portuguese citi¬
zens; they no longer had to meet cer¬
tain requirements to achieve citizen¬
ship status, or to comply with the pro¬
cedures for obtaining it.
IIN 1962, the U.N. Special
Committee on Territories under Portu¬
guese Administration visited Africa
where it obtained information from
representatives of political organiza¬
tions and persons who had recently
left the territories. It had been
refused permission by Portugal to visit
its territories in Africa.
In the Committee's view, the reforms
which Portugal claimed to have intro¬
duced not only failed to meet the
basic aspirations of the peoples for
self-determination, but did not even
bring about any significant changes in
political, economic, social and educa¬
tional conditions.
Subsequently, the U.N. General
Assembly, on December 14, 1962, con¬
demned the attitude of Portugal and
urged it to take steps: to recognize
the right of the territories to self-
determination and independence,
cease all acts of repression, promul¬
gate an unconditional political amnesty
and establish conditions permitting the
free functioning of political parties,
negotiate with representatives of poli¬
tical parties for the transfer of power
to freely elected and representative
institutions, and immediately thereafter
grant independence to all the terri¬
tories.
On March 15, 1963. Angola entered
its third year of war. Portugal was now

said to have 40,000 troops in Angola.
The same year fighting broke out in
Portuguese Guinea and quickly became
widespread. By mid-May 1963, fight¬
ing was reported within forty miles of
Bissau, the territory's seaport capital,
In July 1963, the Portuguese Minister
of Defence admitted that some 5,200
square kilometres (approximately 2,000
square miles) out of a total area
of 36,125 square kilometres were
involved.
In July 1964, it was reported that
the insurgents had cut the territory
in two and that Bissau had been com¬
pletely isolated from the Portuguese
held outposts in the territory. Towards
the end of September 1964, leaders
that would attempt to hamper Portu¬
gal's war effort by requesting States
to deny it assistance.
A number of United Nations bodies
took action against Portugal in an
effort to isolate it in its international
relations. In August 1963, the United
Nations Conference on International
Travel and Tourism, held in Rome,
adopted a resolution inviting Portugal
(along with South Africa) to withdraw
from the Conference. On July 24,
1963 the Economic and Social Council
decided to expel Portugal from mem¬
bership in the Economic Commission
for Africa. At the fourth African-
Indian Ocean Regional Air Navigation
Meeting, under the auspices of the
THE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS
Angola
The People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) issued its first
manifesto in 1956. Its declared objective was the immediate and total inde¬
pendence of Angola. Today it controls more than a third of the Territory, a
region with a population of about one million.
The Union of the Populations of Angola (UPA) in 1962 became part of the
Angola National Liberation Front (FNLA), which, in the same year, established
the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE). The FNLA operates
in the north-eastern regions of the Territory.
Mozambique
The principal liberation movement in the Territory is the Mozambique Liberation
Front (FRELIMO), formed in 1962 by the merger of three movements. In 1971,
FRELIMO represented Mozambique at meetings of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA). FRELIMO has declared one quarter of the Territory
freed from Portuguese control.
Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde
The African Party for the Independence of Guinea (Bissau) and the Cape Verde
Islands (PAIGC) was founded in 1956 by Amilcar Cabrai (see page 12). In 1972,
PAIGC reported that almost three quarters of the Territory had been liberated
and that two thirds of it were under PAIGC control. Elections for the People's
National Assembly were held at the end of 1972, followed in 1973 by the
proclamation of the Republic of Guinea (Bissau).
of the Mozambique Liberation Front
(FRELIMO) declared a general armed
insurrection in Mozambique.
During this period Portugal continued
to introduce changes and reforms in
its territories.
On July 31, 1963, the Security Coun¬
cil declared that the situation in the
Portuguese territories was "seriously
disturbing peace and security in
Africa". It urgently called on Portu¬
gal to recognize the right of the in¬
habitants of the territories to self-
determination and independence. It
affirmed that Portugal's policy which
held that the territories were integral
parts of metropolitan Portugal was
contrary to the U.N. Charter.
All States should refrain from offer¬
ing Portugal assistance which would
enable it to continue its repression in
the territories, and take all measures
to prevent the sale and supply of mili¬
tary equipment to the Portuguese
Government. This was the first of a
host of United Nations resolutions
International Civil Aviation Organiza¬
tion' (ICAO), in Rome, in November-
December 1964, the table of future
aircraft operations in the area was
amended to delete all connexions
between 30 African States and South
Africa, Portugal and the Portuguese
territories in Africa.
In 1965, the General Assembly of
the United Nations called for economic
measures against Portugal by appeal¬
ing to United Nations specialized
agencies, in particular the International
Monetary Fund, to refrain from grant¬
ing Portugal "any financial, economic
or technical assistance" as long as it
failed to implement the Declaration on
the granting of independence.
On June 22, 1966, the Special Com
mittee requested all States, particu¬
larly the military allies of Portugal, to
desist -> from giving the Portuguese
Government any assistance enabling
it to continue its repression in the
territories and to prevent the sale or
supply of arms and military equipment
to the Portuguese Government.
In November 1966, the General Con¬
ference of Unesco decided to with¬
hold assistance to the Government of
Portugal in educational, scientific and
cultural matters and not to invite that
Government to attend special confer¬
ences or take part in other Unesco
activities until such time as Portugal
abandoned its policy of colonial domi¬
nation and racial discrimination. It
confirmed a decision taken by the
Executive Board of Unesco in 1965
not to invite Portugal to attend
meetings of Unesco subordinate bodies
pending the conclusion of an on-site
study of educational conditions in the
Portuguese-administered African Terri¬
tories.
In May 1966, the World Health
Assembly, the executive arm of the
World Health Organization, suspended
the right of Portugal to take part in
regional activities in Africa and sus¬
pended all technical assistance to
Portugal until it furnished proof of its
willingness to comply with United
Nations resolutions.
Meanwhile, fighting was widespread
in Portuguese Guinea in 1965. During
that year the Partido Africano da
Independencia de Guiñé e Cabo Verde
(PAIGC) claimed that a significant pro¬
portion of the territory's estimated
500,000 population was included within
the "liberated areas".
In 1966, there were reports that the
guerrillas had opened a second front
in the eastern regions of Angola.
The insurgents, operated in small,
well-armed groups which engaged in
raids, ambushes and acts of sabotage,
such as the destruction of roads and
bridges. Occasionally, they undertook
large operations, including attacks by
groups of 50 to 150 men on defended
localities and military bases.
During 1967, the flow of refugees
from Angola, Mozambique and Portu-
quese Guinea accelerated. In the
seven years beginning in December
1965, the total number of refugees
from these territories doubled, in¬
creasing from 284,700 to 568,000 at
the end of 1972.
In October 1967, the U.N. Special
Committee considered a detailed
report on the activities of foreign eco¬
nomic and other interests impeding
decolonization in Southern Rhodesia,
Namibia, the Portuguese territories
and other colonial territories. The
report reiterated that foreign interests
and monopolies contribute to the
misery of the indigenous inhabitants
by exploiting the natural resources
in their lands; by taking advantage
of the cheap labour of indigenous
peoples, by helping colonial Govern¬
ments to stay in power; by transferring
most of their profits out of the colonial
territories; and by dominating the
economics of the territories. 1 1

secure Portugal's co-operation with
the United Nations had failed, the

of Guinea (Bissau) where he was born, and indeed all the Portuguese territories of
Africa. He was assassinated ten months ago. A man of rare stature, both as a
thinker and a fighter, he was concerned with every aspect of his country's future.
He described culture, to which he accorded top importance, as "the very foun¬
dation of the liberation movement" and insisted that priority be given to education in
the struggle for independence. "We must preserve for our children the best of what
we have learned", he said; "they are the flower of our struggle." Photo, right, shows

Amilcar Cabrai at a meeting on the Concept of Race, Identity and Dignity, at

HE struggle of peoples for
national liberation and independence
has become a tremendous force for
human progress and is beyond doubt
an essential feature of the history of
our time.
Objective analysis of imperialism as
a fact or historical phenomenon that is
"natural", even "necessary", to the
economic and political evolution of a
great part of mankind, reveals that
imperialist rule with its train of misery,
pillage, crimes and its destruction of
human and cultural values, was not
a purely negative reality.
The huge accumulation of capital
in a half dozen countries of the
northern hemisphere as the result of
piracy, sack of other people's property
and unbridled exploitation of their
labour, did more than engender
colonial monopoly, the sharing-out of
the world and imperialist dominion.
In the rich countries, imperialist
capital, ever looking for higher profits,
heightened man's creative capacity.
Aided by the accelerated progress of
science and technology, it profoundly
transformed the means of production,
stepped-up the social organization of
work and raised the standard of living
of vast sections of the population.
In the colonized countries, colon¬
ization usually arrested the historical
development of the people when it
did not lead to their total or gradual
elimination. Here imperialist capital
imposed new types of relationships
within the indigenous society whose
structure became more complex.
It aroused, fomented, inflamed or
resolved social contradictions and
conflicts.
With the circulation of money and
the development of the domestic and
foreign markets, it introduced new
elements into the economy. It led to
the birth of new nations out of ethnic
groups or peoples at varying stages
of historical development.
It is no defence of imperialist
domination to recognize that it opened
up new worlds to a world whose
dimensions it reduced, that it revealed
new phases in the development of
human societies and, in spite of or
because of the prejudices, discrimi¬
nations and crimes it occasioned,
helped to impart a deeper knowledge
of mankind, moving as one, as a unified
whole amid the complex diversity of
its various forms of development.
Imperialist rule fostered a multi¬
lateral, gradual (sometimes abrupt)
confrontation on the different conti¬
nents not only between different men
but between different societies.
The practice of imperialist rule its
affirmation or its negation demanded
and still demands a more or less
accurate knowledge of the people
dominated and its historical back¬
ground (economic, social and cultural).
This knowledge is necessarily ex¬
pressed in terms of comparison with
the dominating power's own historical
background.
Such knowledge is an imperative

necessity for imperialist rule which
results from the usually violent
confrontation of two different identities,
distinct in their historical backgrounds
and antagonistic in their functions.
Despite its unilateral, subjective and
often unjust character, the search for
such knowledge contributed to the
general enrichment of the human and
social sciences.
Indeed man has never shown such
interest in learning about other men
and other societies as during this
century of imperialist domination.
An unprecedented amount of infor¬
mation, hypotheses and theories was
thus accumulated concerning sub¬
jugated peoples or ethnic groups,
especially in the fields of history,
ethnology, ethnography, sociology and
culture.
Concepts of race, caste, clanship,
tribe, nation, culture, identity, dignity
and many more besides, have received
increasing attention from those who
study man and the so-called "primi¬
tive" or "evolving" societies.
More recently, with the upsurge of
liberation movements, it has been
found necessary to analyse the
characteristics of these societies in
terms of the struggle that is being
fought, so as to determine which
factors spark off or restrain this
struggle. Researchers generally agree
that in this context culture takes on
special importance. Any attempt to
throw light on the true role of culture
in the development of a liberation
(pre-independence) movement can be
seen as making a helpful contribution
to the general struggle of peoples
against imperialist rule.
Because independence movements
are as a rule marked even in their
beginnings by increased cultural
activity, it is taken for granted that
such movements are preceded by a
cultural "renaissance" of the domi¬
nated people. Going a step further,
culture is regarded as a method of
mobilizing the group, even as a
weapon in the fight for independence.
From experience of the struggle of
my own people and it might be said
of all Africa, I feel that this is a too
limited, if not erroneous, conception
of the vital role of culture in the
development of liberation movements.
I think it comes of generalizing
incorrectly from a real but restricted
phenomenon that appears at the level
of colonial elites or diasporas. Such
a generalization is unaware of or
disregards an essential factor the
indestructibility of cultural resistance
by the mass of the people to foreign
rule.
With a few exceptions, the era of
colonization was too short, in Africa
at least, to destroy or significantly
depreciate the essential elements in
the culture and traditions of the
colonized peoples. Experience in
Africa shows that (leaving aside
genocide, racial segregation and
apartheid) the one so-called "positive"
way the colonial power has found for
opposing cultural resistance is "assimi¬
lation". But the total failure of the
policy of "gradual assimilation" of

### 51844: The Role of culture in the battle for independence
AMILCAR CAB RAL:
THE MAN WHO
LIVED HIS IDEALS
"I am just an ordinary African who
wants to repay his debt to his people
and to be a man of his time", declared
Amilcar Cabrai. Born at Bafata, Guinea
(Bissau), in 1925, Cabrai qualified as
a specialist in agronomy and could
have led a privileged life if he had
wanted to. Instead in 1954, when he
was only thirty, he founded the
Anticolonialist Movement in Lisbon.
In 1956, he launched PAIGC (see
page 11) which he headed until his
death. From early in 1963 he began
to organize the independence struggle
In Guinea (Bissau) and within ten years
had liberated three-quarters of the
country. Right, Cabrai with freedom-
fighters crossing a swamp in Guinea
(Bissau). His talent as a theorist and
as an organizer and his personal
physical courage earned him world¬
wide respect In April 1972, at
Conakry, he received the members of
the special United Nations Mission
(see page 20) sent to visit the
liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau). It
was largely due to his untiring efforts
that United Nations' attention was
drawn to the problems of the African
territories under Portuguese adminis¬
tration. He was assassinated at
Conakry on January 20, 1973, before
he could see the final outcome of
the long struggle to which he had
devoted all his energies.
CULTURE AND INDEPENDENCE (Continued)
colonized populations is obvious proof
of the fallacy of the theory and of the
peoples' capacity for resistance (1).
On the other hand, even in
settlement colonies, where the over¬
whelming majority of the population is
still indigenous, the area of colonial
and particularly cultural occupation is
usually reduced to coastal strips and
a few small zones in the interior.
The influence of the colonial power's
culture is almost nil outside the capital
and other urban centres. It is only
significantly felt within the social
pyramid created by colonialism itself
and affects more particularly what may
be called the indigenous petty bour¬
geoisie and a very limited number of
workers in urban centres.
We find then that the great rural
masses and a large fraction of the
urban population, totalling over 99 per
cent of the indigenous population, are
virtually isolated from any cultural
influence by the colonial power.
This implies that, not only for the
mass of the people in the dominated
country but also for the dominant

persons Is 0.3 per cent of the total population
after 500 years of civilizing presence and
half a century of "colonial peace".
classes among the indigenous peoples
(traditional chiefs, noble families,
religious leaders), there is usually no
destruction or significant depreciation
of culture and traditions.
Repressed, persecuted, humiliated,
betrayed by certain social groups
which have come to terms with the
foreigner, culture takes refuge in
villages, in forests and in the minds
of the victims of domination, weather¬
ing all storms to recover all its power
of expansion and enrichment through
the struggle for liberation.
That is why the problem of a "return
to the source" or a "cultural re¬
naissance" does not arise for the
mass of the people; it could not, for
the masses are the torch-bearers of
culture; they are the source of culture
and, at the same time, the one
entity truly capable of creating and
preserving it, of making history.
For an accurate appreciation of the
true role of culture in the development
of the liberation movement, a distinc¬
tion must therefore be made, at least
in Africa, between the situation of the
masses who preserve their culture and
of the social groups that are more
or less assimilated, uprooted and
culturally alienated.
Even though marked by certain
cultural features of their own in
digenous community, native elites
created by the colonizing process live
materially and spiritually the culture
of the colonialist foreigner with whom
they seek gradually to identify them¬
selves in social behaviour and even
in their views of indigenous cultural
values.
Over two or three generations at
least under colonization, a social class
has been formed of government
officials, employees in various bran¬
ches of the economy (especially trade),
members of the liberal professions and
a few urban and agricultural land¬
owners.
This indigenous lower middle class,
created by foreign rule and indispen¬
sable to the colonial system of
exploitation, finds itself placed bet¬
ween the mass of workers in the
country and in the towns and the
minority of local representatives of
the foreign ruling class.
Although its members may have
more or less developed relations with
the mass of the people or the
traditional chiefs, they usually aspire
to a way of life similar to, if not
identical with that of the foreign
minority. Limiting their relations with
the masses they try to become
integrated with that minority, often to
the detriment of family or ethnic bonds
and always at personal cost.

But despite apparent exceptions,
they never succeed in crossing the
barriers imposed by the system. They
are prisoners of the contradictions of
the social and cultural reality in which
they live, for they cannot escape their
condition as a "marginal" class. This
marginality is the real social and
cultural drama of the colonial elites or
indigenous petty bourgeoisie. While
living conditions and level of accul¬
turation determine its intensity, this
drama is always lived at the individual,
not the community, level.
Within the framework of this daily
drama, against the background of the
usually violent confrontation between
the mass of the people and the ruling
colonial class, a feeling of bitterness,
a frustration complex, develops and
grows among the indigenous lower
middle class. At the same time they
gradually become aware of an urgent
need to contest their marginal status
and to find an identity. So they turn
towards the other pole of the social
and cultural conflict in which they are
living the mass of the people.
Hence the "return to the source"
which seems all the more imperative
as the sense of isolation and
frustration of this lower middle class
grows. The same holds true for
Africans dispersed in colonialist and
racist capitals.
It is not by chance then that
theories or movements such as Pan
Africanism and Négritude (two perti¬
nent expressions based mainly on the
notion that all Black Africans are
culturally identical) were conceived
outside Black Africa.
More recently, the Black Americans'
claim to an African identity is another,
perhaps desperate, expression of this
need to "return to the source", though
it is clearly influenced by a new factor
the winning of independence by the
great majority of African peoples.
But the "return to the source"
neither is nor can be in itself an act
of struggle against foreign (colonialist
and racist) rule. Nor does it necess¬
arily mean a return to traditions. It
is the denial by the indigenous petty
bourgeoisie of the superiority claimed
for the culture of the ruling power
over the culture of the dominated
people with which this petty bour¬
geoisie feels the need to identify.
This "return to the source" then is
not a voluntary step; it is the only
possible response to the irreconcilable
contradiction between the colonized
society and the colonial power, bet¬
ween the exploited masses and the
foreign exploiters.
When the "return to the source"
goes beyond the individual to find
expression in groups or move¬
ments", this opposition turns into
conflict (under cover or open), the
prelude to the pre-independence move¬
ment or struggle for liberation from
foreign yoke.
This "return to the source" is thus
historically important only if it involves
both a genuine commitment to the
fight for independence and also a
total, irrevocable identification with
the aspirations of the masses, who
reject not only the foreigner's culture
but foreign rule altogether. Otherwise
it is nothing but a means of obtaining
temporary advantages, a conscious
or unconscious form of political
opportunism.
It should be noted that this "return
to the source", whether real or
apparent, is not something that
happens simultaneously and uniformly
within the lower middle class. It is
a slow, discontinuous, uneven process
and its development depends on each
person's degree of acculturation,
material conditions of life, ideological
thinking, and individual history as a
social being.
This unevenness explains the
splitting of the indigenous petty bour¬
geoisie into three groups in relation
to the liberation movement: a minority
which, even though it may want the

end of foreign rule, hangs on to the
ruling colonial class and openly
opposes the liberation movement in
order to defend and secure its own
social position; a hesitant or un¬
decided majority; another minority
which helps to create and to direct
the liberation movement.
But this last group which plays a
decisive role in developing the pre-
independence movement, does not
really succeed in identifying itself with
the mass of the people (with their
culture and their aspirations) except
through the struggle, the degree of
identification depending on the form or
forms of the struggle, the ideological
content of the movement and the extent
of each person's moral and political
awareness.
Culture has proved to be the very
foundation of the liberation movement.
Only societies which preserve their
cultures are able to mobilize and
organize themselves and fight against
foreign domination. Whatever ideo¬
logical or idealistic forms it takes,
culture is essential to the historical
process. It has the power to prepare
and make fertile those factors that
ensure historical continuity and deter¬
mine a society's chances of pro¬
gressing (or regressing).
'iNCE imperialist rule is
the negation of the historical process
of the dominated society, it will readily
be understood that it is also the
negation of the cultural process. And
since a society that really succeeds
in throwing off the foreign yoke reverts
to the upward paths of its own culture,
the struggle for liberation is above all
an act of culture.
The fight for liberation is an essen¬
tially political fact. Consequently, as
it develops, it can only use political
methods.
Culture then is not, and cannot be, a
weapon or a means of mobilizing the
group against foreign domination. It
is much more than that. ' Indeed, it
is on firm knowledge of' the local
reality, particularly the cultural reality,
that the choice, organization and
development of the best methods of
fighting are based.
This is why the liberation movement
must recognize the vital importance
not only of the cultural characteristics
of the dominated society as whole but
also of those of each social class.
For though it has a mass aspect,
culture is not uniform and does not
develop evenly in all sectors, horizon¬
tal or vertical, of society.
The attitude and behaviour of each
class or each individual towards the
struggle and its development are, it
is true, dictated by economic interests,
but they are also profoundly influenced
by culture. It may even be said that
differences in cultural level explain
differences in behaviour towards the
liberation movement of individuals of
the same social class.
It is at this level, then, that culture
attains its full significance for each
individual comprehension of and in¬
tegration within his social milieu, iden¬
tification with the fundamental prob¬
lems and aspirations of his society
and acceptance or rejection of the
possibility of change for the better.
Whatever its form, the struggle
requires the mobilization and organi¬
zation of a large majority of the popu¬
lation, the political and moral unity
of the different social classes, the
gradual elimination of vestiges of tribal
or feudal mentality, the rejection of
social and religious taboos that are
incompatible with the rational and
national character of, the liberating
movement. And the struggle brings
about many other profound modifica¬
tions in the life of the people.
This is all the more true because
the dynamic of the struggle also re¬
quires the exercise of democracy,
criticism and self-criticism, growing
participation of the people in running
their lives, the achievement of literacy,
the creation of schools and health
services, leadership training for rural
and city workers, and many other
achievements that are involved in the
society's "forced march" along the
road of cultural progress. This shows
that the liberation struggle is more than
a cultural fact, it is also a cultural
factor.
Among the - representatives of the
colonial power as well as in their home
countries, the first reaction to the
liberation struggle is a general feeling
of_surprise and incredulity. Once this
feeling, the fruit of prejudice or of the
planned distortions typical of colonia¬
list news, is surmounted reactions vary
with the interests, the political opinions
and the degree to which colonialist
and racist attitudes have crystallized
among the different social classes and
individuals.
The progress of the struggle and the
sacrifices imposed by the need to take
colonialist repressive measures (police
or military) cause a split in metropo¬
litan opinion. Differing, if not diver¬
gent positions are adopted and new
political and social contradictions
emerge.
From the moment the struggle is
recognized as an irreversible fact,
however great the resources employed
to quash it, a qualitative change takes
place in metropolitan opinion. The
possibility if not the inevitability of the
colony's independence is on the whole
gradually accepted.
Such a change is a conscious or
unconscious admission that the colo¬
nized people now engaged in the
struggle have an identity and a culture
of their own. And this holds true even
though throughout the conflict an
active minority, clinging to its interests
and prejudices, persists in refusing
the colonized their right to indepen¬
dence and in denying the equivalence
of cultures that right implies.
At a decisive stage in the conflict
this equivalence is implicitly recognized
or accepted even by the colonial
power. To divert the fighters from
their objectives it applies a demagogic
policy of "economic and social im¬
provement", of "cultural development",
cloaking its domination with new forms.
NIEO-COLONIALISM is
above all the continuation of imperialist
economic rule in disguise, but never¬
theless it is also the tacit recognition
by the colonial power that the people
it rules and exploits have an identity
of their own demanding its own
political control, for the satisfaction of
a cultural necessity.
Moreover, by accepting that the
colonized people have an identity and
a culture, and therefore an inalienable
right to self-determination and indepen¬
dence, metropolitan opinion (or at
least an important part of it) itself
makes significant cultural progress and
sheds a negative element in its own
culture the prejudice that the colo¬
nizing nation is superior to the colo¬
nized one. This advance can have all-
important consequences for the poli¬
tical evolution of the imperialist or
colonialist power, as certain facts of
current or recent history prove.

state. Those still living in Mozam¬
bique remained subject to Portu¬
guese control. Makonde resistance
to colonial rule began in 1960 but
was brutally suppressed. In the
armed conflict that followed, the
Makonde gave many freedom fight¬
ers to the war waged against the
Portuguese by the Mozambique
Liberation Front (FRELIMO). At the
same time thousands were forced
into exile in Tanzania where two-
thirds of the 500,000 Makonde
people now live. On its isolated
plateau, the ancient Makonde cul¬
ture has brought forth a remarkable
flowering of sculptured art. A closely
knit, traditional farming people, the
Makonde havedeveloped their wood-
carving skills over many centuries.
For them wood is a material imbued
with force and sacred meaning, and
one of their legends tells how their
first father carved with his hands
the wood out of which the first
mother came to life. Today most
of their sculpture is in the ebony
that abounds in East Africa, a noble
wood but difficult to carve because
of its extreme hardness. Using the
natural form of branch or root, the
i Makonde sculptor can conjure forth
realistic everyday ¡mages or symbols
of rare abstraction. Modern
Makonde art is a unique achievement
as much for its rich variety of styles
as for the abundance of works.
During the past 15 years it has
known an even richer flowering
that of a traditional art delving
into its past while realistically adapt¬
ing itself to modern conditions.
Here we present a few examples of
today's Makonde sculpture in wood.
(1) From the root of an ebony tree,
the artist has depicted an antelope
and a snake (the snake in Makonde
mythology symbolically links the
worlds of the living and the dead).
(2) A herd of antelopes (elongated
shapes of many Makonde carvings
are determined by the sculptor's
choice of wood). (3) Hope of
motherhood. The wished-for child
is shown on the woman's head. In
the Makonde matriarchal society,
women symbolize the continuity
of life. (4-5) Rear and profile views
of an embracing couple whose
masked faces (5) symbolize the
spoken word. (6) Woman, symbol

CULTURE AND INDEPENDENCE
(Continued from page 16)
and cultural affinities between certain
human groups on one or more conti¬
nents and a more or less similar
situation in regard to colonial or racist
domination have led to the formulation
of theories and the creation of
"movements" based on the hypothe¬
tical existence of racial or continental
cultures.
The widely recognized or sensed
importance of culture in the liberation
movement has helped to give this
hypothesis a certain following. One
would not wish to minimise the
importance of such theories or move¬
ments as attempts successful or
otherwise to find an identity and
also as a means of contesting foreign
rule. But an objective analysis of
cultural reality leads one to reject the
notion of racial or continental cultures.
In the first place, culture, like
history, is an expanding phenomenon
and closely linked with the economic
and social reality of an environment,
with the level and methods of produc¬
tion of the society that creates it.
Secondly, culture develops unevenly
at the level of a continent, of a "race",
and even of a community. In fact,
the co-ordinates of culture, like those
of every other developing phenomen¬
on, vary in space and time, whether
they are material (physical) or human
(biological and sociological).
That is why culture the creation of
a community, the synthesis of balances
and solutions it produces to resolve
the conflicts that characterize it at
every phase of its history is a social
reality independent of man's will, of
the colour of his skin or the shape of
his eyes, and of geographical boun¬
daries.
If culture is to play its proper rôle,
the liberation movement must lay down
the precise objectives to be achieved
on the road to the reconquest of the
rights of the people it represents the
right to make its own history and the
right to dispose freely of its own
productive resources. This will pave
the way to the final objective of
developing a richer, popular, national,
scientific and universal culture.
It is not the task of the liberation
movement to determine whether a
culture is specific to the people or not.
The important thing is for the move¬
ment to undertake a critical analysis
of that culture in the light of the
requirements of the struggle and of
progress; to give it its place within
the universal civilization without con¬
sideration as to its superiority or in¬
feriority, with a view to its harmonious
integration into the world of today as
part of the common heritage of man¬
kind. '

### 51847: What we saw in liberated Guinea-Bissau: an on-the-spot report of a special United Nations mission
by
Horacio
Sevilla Borja
The article published here is based on a report by Horacio Sevilla Borja, head of the United
Nations Special Mission which in 1972 visited the liberated areas of Guinea (Bissau). The
team consisted of Horacio Sevilla Borja (Ecuador), Folke Löfgren (Sweden) and Kamel Belkhiria
(Tunisia), all three representatives of their countries at the United Nations. At the end of 1971,
Amilcar Cabrai invited the United Nations to send a fact-finding mission to Guinea (Bissau).
From April 2 to 8, 1972, the Special Mission travelled throughout the liberated areas observing
social, health and educational programmes put into effect by the liberation movement. In Nov¬
ember 1972, the United Nations recognized the African Party for the Liberation of Guinea
(Bissau) and Cape Verde as "the only and authentic representative of the people of the terri¬
tory" and reaffirmed "the inalienable right of the people of Guinea (Bissau) to «elf-determina¬
tion, freedom and independence."
UR first and main impres¬
sion was that the existence of the
so-called "liberated areas" is an
undeniable fact of life, despite the
persistent denials of the Portuguese
which have created doubts among
their closest allies and in spite of the
innumerable reports by journalists and
non-governmental delegations from
various quarters who have visited the
Territory of Guinea (Bissau).
The military forces and administra¬
tive officers of PAIGC (African Party
for the Independence of Guinea
(Bissau) and Cape Verde) are actually
in control of the situation and they are
the real masters of the extensive areas
we visited.
Using various means of transport,
we were continually on the move.
We found the same situation every¬
where: the established presence of
well-organized guerilla forces; over¬
whelming support among the people
of the villages, hamlets and settlements
for those who are fighting to free them;
comprehensive administrative organ¬
ization covering every facet of com¬
munity life.
It is commendable that, after only a
few years of a struggle recognized as
legitimate by the United Nations,
PAIGC, although considerably inferior
to the enemy in material and military
potential, has been able to gain control
over vast areas of the Territory of
Guinea (Bissau) which are being
wrested from the domination of their
illegal occupiers.
Even more admirable is the work
being done by PAIGC to organize the
civil life of the community and, while
in the throes of the struggle, to create
a new society, with its own institutions
suited to the characteristics of the
Guiñean people rather than foreign
cultures forcibly imposed.
This new society dignifies its
basic component, the human being, by
providing equal opportunities, commu-
nity work and social justice and by Y|
eliminating traditional antiquated cus- '
toms and tribal differences fostered by
the colonizer.

MISSION TO GUINEA-BISSAU (Continued)
The new society is emerging with
great speed from the Dark Ages of
inept and unjust colonial domination
into the dawn of a future in which there
will be dynamic progress free from
exploitation.
We shall not forget our visit to
day-schools and boarding-schools
where, under the direction of PAIGC
and with a team of teachers trained
abroad, comprehensive education is
given to children, many of whom were
born in liberated areas and have
never seen a Portuguese soldier or
civilian.
It is true that the smiles and gaiety
typical of their age seem for the
present to have departed from the
faces of those children. But it must
be remembered that, at the same time
as they are being educated, they have
to take part in defence and recons¬
truction work and they even have to
bring their own school materials from
the frontier on long and dangerous
treks.
The school-children of Guinea
(Bissau) live in constant fear of bomb¬
ing, because the schools seem to be
favourite targets for the indiscriminate
Portuguese bombardments which have
already taken many young lives.
While on the subject of education,
I must mention the tremendous value
of the bilateral international co-opera¬
tion given by different countries. For
example, we were pleased to see
children learning their lessons from
textbooks in Portuguese printed in
Sweden and donated by the Swedish
Government.
PAIGC has set itself the goal of
providing education for all children of
school age and completing a literacy
programme for adults in the liberated
areas, which would never even have
been dreamed of under the colonial
system.
PAIGC has several hospitals and
health posts scattered over the lib¬
erated areas; these not only care for
people wounded in the war, the maj¬
ority of whom are civilians, but also
carry out curative and preventive
campaigns against diseases endemic
in those regions and give intermediate-
level personnel medical training,
thereby creating a new kind of soldier
for peace working for his people.
Here, I should also stress the value of
existing international co-operation
provided in the form of experts, drugs
and equipment, which helps to meet
the tremendous needs.
Throughout the areas under its
control, PAIGC has also organized
people's stores where goods are bar¬
tered, a system that helps the people
to overcome the problems of over¬
production of traditional products such
as rice and provides them with con¬
sumer goods and prime necessities
which they could not afford under the
colonial administration.
Much could be said about the re¬
construction work being carried out,
about the administration of justice
based on people's courts, about the
system of community administration.
It is particularly important to note
the attitude adopted by the Portuguese
Government on the occasion of the
visit of the Special Mission which was
approved by an overwhelming majority
in the General Assembly. Not only
did Portugal try to prevent the visit
at the diplomatic level but it also used
its military might in an attempt to
prevent the visit and destroy three

delegates who were carrying out an
official United Nations Mission.
It was painful for us to see with
our own eyes the atrocities committed
by the Portuguese troops. Villages
had been burned and their inhabitants
were sleeping in the open with the
stench of the recent fires in their
nostrils. Crops had been destroyed
by bombing raids. Cattle had been
killed and there were constant re¬
connaissance flights. We also saw
unexploded bombs that had been
dropped by planes in the fields of the
liberated areas.
I should like to express the gratitude
of my colleagues on the Mission and
myself to the members of the Special
Committee for having given us the
opportunity to serve on this Mission
and thereby to offer material and spe¬
cific proof of the dedication and
support of our countries and govern¬
ments for the cause that is closest to
the hearts of the African people. The
first experiment by the United Nations
in its search for new ways of assist¬
ing peoples in their struggle to free
themselves once and for all from the
colonial yoke was an unforgettable
personal experience for us.

U NESCO's contribution to
the cause of peace, whether by direct
or indirect activities, has been sub¬
stantial and wide-ranging throughout
the Organization's history. However'
in recent years, the General Confer¬
ence has resolved that Unesco must
strengthen even more its work for
peace. For while it is appreciated
that Unesco's total programme of
international co-operation in education,
science, culture and communication
contributes substantially and con¬
tinuously to peaceful relations among
nations, there is nevertheless a
demand that still more attention be
given, within Unesco's special fields
of interest, to activities which can be
seen to bear directly on the problems
of peace.
For example, Unesco has played an
important part in aiding African liber¬
ation movements in Angola, Mozambi¬
que and Guinea (Bissau) to obtain text¬
books and other teaching materials
GINETTE FONTAINE-EBOUE, of Chad, is
responsible for Unesco's programme oi

ments and refugees. After joining Unesco's
Department of Education in 1961, she helped
to co-ordinate cultural and educational aid
to the Congo (today the Republic of Zaire)
on its accession to independence.
and has helped to set up schools in
liberated areas and neighbouring
countries such as Tanzania, Guinea
and Zambia.
In 1971 Unesco sent a fact-finding
mission, led by the Assistant Director-
General for Education, Amadou Mahtar
M'Bow, to the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).
Working closely, the two organizations
have since channelled considerable
educational aid to liberation move¬
ments and refugees from the three
Portuguese-held African territories.
Since 1972, Unesco has admin¬
istered United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme funds totalling over
$350,000 for refugee education granted
in response to a request for aid from
Tanzania, Zambia and Guinea. This
aid has provided regional and inter¬
national study fellowships and has
helped to pay the training and salaries
of volunteer teachers for the refugees.
It has supplied equipment for the
Institute of Friendship, run at Conakry
(Rep. of Guinea) by the liberation
movement in Guinea (Bissau) and Cape
Verde (PAIGC), for the secondary
school and teacher training centre of
the Mozambique Liberation Movement
(FRELIMO), at Bagamoyo (Tanzania)
and for Nkumbi International College

places are reserved for refugees.
Unesco allocated $40,000 for aid
to refugees and liberation movements
in 1971-72 and a further $69,000 in
1973-74. Part of these sums have
been used to print 60,000 mathematics
textbooks for the independence move¬
ment in Guinea (Bissau), as well as to
help refugee education centres such
as the Institute of Friendship at
Conakry and the secondary school
and teachei.-training centre at Baga-
moyo. The textbooks have been
shipped to Conakry for use in the Rep.
of Guinea and in the liberated areas
of Guinea (Bissau). Unesco is also
helping to train primary teachers and
literacy workers at Conakry and
Bagamoyo.
Unesco is publishing a history text¬
book on Guinea (Bissau) and Cape
Verde, the first to give an account of
current events in this territory.
Unesco last year collaborated with
Sweden and Denmark in a $700,000
aid programme for the Angola Institute
of Education, set up in Dolisie (Peoples
Rep. of the Congo) by the Angola
Liberation Movement (MPLA). The
aid covers buildings (provided by
the Danish International Development
Agency), staff salaries, furniture and
equipment financed through Unesco
by the Swedish International Devel¬
opment Agency. With Unesco's
help, the Angola Institute is devising
special programmes for refugee school
children.
Unesco has shipped to Africa one
million exercise books offered by the
U.S.S.R. which has also made avail¬
able 50 higher education fellowships
to refugees belonging to liberation
movements.
Unesco's appeal on behalf of
African liberation movements and
refugees has brought responses from
other countries. India, for example,
has offered school supplies; Kuwait
is investigating priority needs in
refugee education; Finland has agreed
to print textbooks for the liberation
movements; and Somalia has made
study grants for the training of primary
and secondary teachers.
Under its programme to give
"moral" assistance to African liber¬
ation movements, Unesco is publishing
several major fact-finding reports on
the situation in southern Africa. They
include a special inquiry into Por¬
tuguese colonialism in Angola, Guinea
(Bissau) and Mozambique.' The study,
"Portuguese Colonialism: Its Effects
on Education, Science, Culture and
Information" (in preparation), has been
written by Dr. Eduardo de Sousa
Ferreira (see page 25) and will be
published with an introduction by Basil
Davidson.

Education
and discrimination
in the Portuguese
territories of Africa
The "Unesco Courier" is pleased to offer readers a preview from a
special Unesco report on the effects of Portuguese colonialism on
education, science, culture and information in African territories
under Portuguese control. Here, Eduardo de Sousa Ferreira, author
of the Unesco report, examines salient findings from his inquiry into
education today under Portuguese rule in Africa. His study is one
of several fact-finding reports on the current situation in southern
Africa which Unesco plans to publish (dates of publication not yet
announced) under its programme of "moral assistance" to African
liberation movements. The passage below is condensed from a chapter
in Mr. de Sousa Ferreira's book at present in preparation.
I^bDUCATION... cannot have
as its objective the mere spreading of
knowledge; its objective should be
the formation of citizens capable of
feeling to the full the imperatives of
Portuguese life, knowing how to inter¬
pret them and making them a constant
reality, in order to secure the con¬
tinuation of the Nation." This, as
stated in mid-1972 by the Portuguese
Minister of Overseas Territories,
Joaquim da Silva Cunha, is the basis
of Portugal's educational policy in its
African territories.
In the face of international opinion
as well as the pressure exerted by the
liberation movements in Portuguese
African territories, Portugal has since
the 1960s introduced important changes
in her colonial policy in Africa.
Education, as an integral part of this
policy, underwent fundamental modifi¬
cations.
Though this led to an expansion of
EDUARDO DE SOUSA FERREIRA, Portu¬
guese economist and specialist on Portuguese
economic and political questions, has made
a close study of current conditions in African
territories under Portuguese administration.
He is the author of "Portuguese Colonialism
from South Africa to Europe", published in
1972 by Aktion Dritte Welt, Freiburg (Fed.
Rep. of Germany).
education unprecedented in the Por¬
tuguese territories, the increase has
been quantitative and confined almost
exclusively to primary education. The
basic aim of the new policy is un¬
changed from the old: the inculcation
of Portuguese values and the pro¬
motion among African school-children
of a conscious identification with
Portugal.
Textbooks throw an interesting light
on the new educational policy. Unlike
those used before a reform of pri¬
mary education in 1964, textbooks are
now considerably Africanized. They
show African life in rural areas and in
the towns. Frequently pictures show
Africans in harmonious relations with
whites.
This depiction of African culture
and environment is, however, com¬
pletely swamped by pictures of whites
or of Portugal, while moral, religious
and historical issues are dealt with
from an exclusively Portuguese point
of view.
History in the fourth grade covers
Portuguese history only. History is
the only subject other than Portuguese
language and arithmetic on which the
student is questioned in the final
examination, and a certificate in history
is necessary for any Angolan seeking
any employment other than physical
labour. The history of the colonies is
mentioned a few times, but only in
relation to Portuguese history, e.g. the
"discoveries" of Henry the Navigator,
and the "liberation" of Angola from the
Dutch occupation.
The geography textbooks of the
fourth grade have a picture of the
Salazar bridge in Lisbon on the cover
and contain detailed information about
Portugal, including its ports, rivers
and mountains.
It will be useful to examine certain
immediately relevant aspects of pri¬
mary education, using Angola as an
example. Angola has made the most
comprehensive progress of all the
colonies and so represents the
maximum achievement. Secondly,
more up-to-date and detailed data are
available on education for Angola than
for the other colonies.
There has been a remarkable in¬
crease in primary school attendance
(from 105,781, in 1960-61, to 392,809,
in 1969-70). The rapidity of the in¬
crease is explained, however, by the
extremely low starting level in 1960-61.
In 1970-71 children of school-age going
to school still represented only little
more than half (53.43 per cent). As
regards Mozambique, the newspaper

EDUCATION AND DISCRIMINATION (Continued)
Noticias of Lourenço Marques (of 29
March 1972) gave the corresponding
percentage as 30 per cent.
Schools are mainly in cities or in
white settlements. For Africans living
elsewhere access to education is diffi¬
cult. An official inquiry was made in
all rural zones in Angola in 1971,
except for areas to which access was
denied by the liberation movements.
It showed that 48.5 per cent of the
children of shepherds and 20 per cent
of farm children did not go to school
in 1969-70 because no facilities were
available.
To extend schooling to the rural
areas where most Africans live, the
1964 decree established schools
which provide a pre-primary class and
the first three years of primary edu¬
cation. In general, only full primary
schools provide the fourth year,
Nevertheless all of the schools are
counted in the statistics as primary
schools.
Teachers for the full primary schools
(almost exclusively Europeans or
of mixed Portuguese and African
descent) attend a two-year teacher-
training course after completing five
years of secondary education; teachers
in the others need only four years of
primary school, and four years of
teacher-training.
During the rapid expansion in
Angola in 1962, the lower grades in
the latter schools were entrusted to
monitors, whose only qualifications
were four years of primary school
and a two-and-a-half month vocation
training class. How low this level of
training is can be judged from the
fact that only after ten years of
teaching ("always with good reports
at the annual inspections") can moni-

tors apply to take the examination for
teacher posts {though there too, the
standard is not high). In 1969-70,
most of the teachers in the three-year
schools, and all the monitors were
African.
The small proportion of properly
trained teachers partly accounts for a
high rate of failures, but it is not the
only cause. Portuguese is ihe only
language of instruction allowed. As
from pre-primary, African children have
first to learn Portuguese, and are thus
at a great disadvantage as compared
with Portuguese children. The higher
rates of failure occur in the initial
grades. Statistics for Angola are not
available but those for Mozambique
show a pre-primary failure rate of 67.1
per cent as against an average failure
rate of 57.8 per cent.
' However, transfer from pre-primary
to first grade does not depend exclu¬
sively on proficiency in Portuguese.
As a United Nations document points
out: "Recent events suggest however
that an African child who is already
7 years old, who speaks Portuguese

fluently and can count in Portuguese,
may not be able to enter first grade
as a Portuguese child would but may
have to go through the pre-primary
class, where he will be "made to
acquire the social habits necessary
for attending common schools with
the same success as children from a
European type of environment."
Of all students enrolled in Angola
in 1967-70, 4.4 per cent completed
primary education, i.e. passed the final
examination of the fourth grade. The
highest percentage (9.58 per cent)
was in Luanda, the lowest in Cuando-
Cubango (1.96 per cent).
The planners themselves comment:
"The conclusion does not vindicate
the system. Most of the population
(and nearly all the rural population)
attend only the first two, or at most
three, grades, leaving school with only
the sketchiest of knowledge, rudi¬
mentary to such a degree that within
a short while they fall back into
illiteracy; and the consequences for
the economy are those that result
from the almost total unproductivity
of the investment involved."
Most Africans are debarred by
selective processes from access to
any education beyond primary level.
Of 444,983 Africans being educated
in Mozambique 439,974 were at pri¬
mary level.
Post-primary education is mainly
technical and occupational, its object
being to produce more skilled Africans.
Figures for Mozambique show that
at secondary level in 1966-67, 70.2 per
cent of the 4,157 Africans were attend¬
ing technical or occupational schools
and only 29.8 per cent academic
schools, whereas most Europeans
attended academic schools.
The position is prejudiced still fur¬
ther by the fact that facilities are
available in only a very few places,
usually not very accessible to most
Africans. There is a strong concen¬
tration of schools and pupils in a few
districts and particularly in Luanda; in
1970-71, 87.46 per cent of all secon¬
dary first grade students lived in
eight of Angola's fifteen districts, with
38.79 per cent of them living in Luanda.
We have already seen from the
figures for Mozambique that there is a
high rate of failure at primary school.
The figures for Angola -show a rate of
failure in first cycle secondary of 40
per cent.
University education in Angola and
Mozambique is token with only 1,402
students in 1969-70, in Angola. Mo¬
zambique (1968-69) had 1,145 students
of whom 33 completed their studies.
Courses most attended were engineer¬
ing and medicine (75.94 per cent of
students in Angola in 1968-69).
Courses providing training for agro¬
nomists, veterinarians and social ser¬
vice (which would be very important
for rural people and rural development)
are less well attended mainly because
of the poor prospects open to those
who qualify.
In Mozambique, in 1966-67, of 614
students 9 were Africans. In 1967-
68, of a total of 748 students, 8 were
Africans (5 studying medicine and 3
engineering), corresponding to 1.1 per
cent of the total; 83.5 per cent were
whites. Among other obstacles, few

OF DECOLONIZATION
Territories presently uh<3er examination by the United Nations Special
Committee on the ending of colonialism.
Countries which have become sovereign independent states since the
establishment of the United Nations in 1945.
V <?
Based on a United Nations map
N December 14, 1960, the
United Nations General Assembly
adopted by an overwhelming majority
and without a single negative vote
the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples. The Assembly declared
that:
"The subjection of peoples to alien
subjugation, domination and exploi¬
tation constitutes a denial of fundamen¬
tal human rights, is contrary to the
Charter of the United Nations and is
an impediment to the promotion of
world peace and co-operation."
During the decade following the
adoption of the Declaration, some
30 dependent territories with a total
population of approximately 60 million
have attained the goals set forth in
the Declaration; many of these
formerly dependent territories have
become Member States of the United
Nations.
It was recognized, however, that
some peoples were still deprived of
their inalienable right to self-deter¬
mination and independence. Many of
these peoples inhabited small and
often isolated territories, where, due
primarily to the paucity of human
and natural resources, decolonization
required a particular solution in each
case.
Some 18 million, however, lived
under regimes which offered them
very little hope, if any, of early or
peaceful emancipation. In many of
these territories, repressive measures,
including armed aggression, continued
to be taken against the inhabitants
and their national liberation movements.
On October 12, 1970, shortly before
the tenth anniversary of the Dec¬
laration, the U.N. General Assembly
adopted by an overwhelming majority
the Programme of Action for the full
implementation of the Declaration.
The concept of inalienable rights of
colonial peoples to self-determination
and independence was thus expanded
to include recognition of their inherent
right to struggle "by all necessary
means at their disposal" against
colonial powers which suppressed by
force their aspirations for freedom and
independence.
The General Assembly recommended
that Member States as well as the
specialized agencies and other United
Nations organizations should render
all necessary moral and material
assistance to the peoples engaged in
the struggle to attain freedom and
independence.
Despite the adoption of the Pro¬
gramme the process of decolonization
in certain territories continues to make
agonizingly slow progress.
The cause of the present impasse
lies in the open defiance by the
colonialist and racist powers con-

DECOLONIZATION (Continued)
cerned of the relevant United Nations
resolutions and in the refusal of
certain States, particularly the major
military allies and trading partners of
these powers, to co-operate with the
United Nations in implementing the
recommendations and solutions pre¬
scribed in those resolutions.
The Government of Portugal con¬
tinues to deny the principle of self-
determination as defined by the United
Nations. Portugal instead has under¬
taken to intensify its military operations
against the peoples in the territories
struggling to liberate themselves from
its rule, resorting to the bombing of
civilians and the destruction of
villages and property and to the use
of napalm and chemical substances
against these peoples.
In doing so, Portuguese armed
forces have on several occasions
violated the territorial integrity of
African States sharing common borders
with the three territories, once again
underlining the dangers inherent in
the escalation of military operations
with the aim of suppressing liberation
movements.
Indeed, a report of the Special
Mission which visited the liberated
areas of Guinea (Bissau) bore ample
testimony to the gravity of the situation
and a consequential threat to peace in
the region as a whole, as a result of
the further intensification of Portugal's
military operations and other col¬
onialist measures (see page 20).
In the case of Namibia, a territory
for which the United Nations is directly
responsible, the challenge to the
authority and prestige of the United
Nations is specially flagrant, for the
Government of South Africa persists
in its refusal to comply with the
resolutions of the United Nations and
continues its illegal occupation and
administration of the territory, ex¬
tending to Namibia its inhuman
policies of apartheid and racial dis¬
crimination.
In the meantime, encouraged by
South Africa, exploitation of Namibia's
natural resources by foreign economic
and other interests continues at an
increasing pace. All sectors of
Namibia's economy are almost exclus¬
ively controlled by these interests.
The International Court of Justice, on
June 21, 1971, not only confirmed the
Photos Mike McGeorge © Parimage, Paris
illegality of South Africa's continued
presence in Namibia, but affirmed that
Member States are under an obligation
to recognize the illegality of that
presence and administration. Thus,
all States should, as a matter of
urgency, take effective economic and
other measures to ensure the im¬
mediate withdrawal of the , South
African presence from Namibia.
As regards the problems of de¬
colonization in the remaining dependent
territories, the majority of which are
small territories with particular prob¬
lems arising from their small size and
population, geographic isolation and
limited economic resources, progress
has been too little and too slow.
In the majority of these territories,
economic, social and educational
advancement has fallen far short of
the expectations arising from the
obligation which the administering
powers assumed under the relevant
provisions of the U.N. Charter. Indeed,
from many territories there are reports
of injustice and maltreatment of the
inhabitants through alienation of their
land, exploitation of natural resources
against their interests or discriminatory

A project for the building of a giant
dam by the Portuguese authorities
at Cabora Basso in Mozambique has
been under way for several years.
In 1970, the U.N. General Assembly
condemned the Cabora Bassa
project as "contrary to the vital in¬
terests of the people of Mozam¬
bique." A year later the General
Assembly called on States "whose
companies are participants in the
construction of the Cabora Bassa
project to withdraw their support
from the scheme and put an end to
the participation of their compa¬
nies." According to the United
Nations Special Committee, the
vast complex of the Cabora Bassa
dam, due to be flooded in 1974,
could permit more than a million
white settlers to move into the area
and constitute a serious obstacle to
the future liberation of Mozambique.
Despite this, work continues at Ca¬
bora Bassa (photo left) under the

labour practices and working con¬
ditions.
U.N. Member States strongly con¬
demn once again the activities of the
military and political alliance of South
Africa, Portugal and the illegal régime
in Southern Rhodesia aimed at
suppressing militarily the right of the
peoples in the territories under their
domination to self-determination and
independence, and demand the Im¬
mediate cessation of all such activities.
The United Nations is fully aware
of the urgent need of the peoples in
the colonial territories, particularly in
the liberated areas of some of those
territories, and of their national
liberation movements for international
assistance, especially for aid in edu¬
cation, training, health and nutrition.
Recognition by the United Nations
of the legitimacy of the struggle of
colonial peoples for freedom and
independence calls for the extension
by U.N. specialized agencies and
international institutions associated
with the U.N. of all necessary moral
and material assistance to the national
liberation movements in those ter¬
ritories, especially in liberated areas. M
for African refugees
and freedom-fighters
The United Nations and Unesco are not the only organizations of the U.N.
family giving aid to African peoples fighting for their independence, in
particular to refugees from territories under Portuguese rule. By the end
of 1972, the High Commission for Refugees, in collaboration with the Inter¬
national Bank for Reconstruction and Development, had spent over eight
million dollars on aid to refugees from Portuguese-held territories. This
sum helped to meet medical and educational needs and to provide roads,
bridges and equipment for the refugee settlement areas. Aid worth 1 .5 mil¬
lion dollars was allocated in 1973.
UNICEF in 1972 provided over 780,000 dollars for refugee mothers and
children in six African host countries (Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia. Senegal,
Zaire, Guinea). FAO and the World Food Programme have given food and
technical aid for clearing land and planting crops to a value of five million
dollars. In collaboration with the Organization of African Unity, ILO provides
grants to enable refugees to learn trades of all kinds. 31

change in the Government in Portugal
in late 1968 led to another appeal for
its co-operation.
But in September 1969, the Sec¬
retary-General of the United Nations
declared that the attitude of the Portu¬
guese government: "remains the cru¬
cial obstacle to peace in southern
Africa and exacerbates the grave
situation prevailing in that region."
At its November 1969 session the
U.N. General Assembly welcomed the
Manifesto of the Organization of Afri¬
can Unity on southern Africa. On the
problem of the Portuguese Territories
in Africa, the Manifesto states:
"In Mozambique and Angola and in
so-called Portuguese Guinea, the basic
problem is not racialism but a pre¬
tence that Portugal exists in Africa.
Portugal is situated in Europe... No
legislation passed by any parliament
in Portugal can make Africa part of
Europe...
"...The peoples of Mozambique, An¬
gola and Portuguese Guinea... are
demanding an acceptance of the prin¬
ciples of Independence on the basis
of majority rule, and for many years
they called for discussions on this
issue. Only when their demand for
talks was continually ignored did they
begin to fight. Even now, if Portugal
should change her policy and accept
the principle of self-determination, we
would urge the liberation movements
to desist from their armed struggle
and to co-operate in the mechanics of
a peaceful transfer of power from Por¬
tugal to the peoples of the African
territories."
The United Nations and its spe¬
cialized agencies have continued to
give the closest attention to the
problem and have increased their aid
and support to the peoples struggling
for their independence. In November
1972 the U.N. General Assembly
recognized the national liberation
movements of Angola, of Guinea
(Bissau) and Cape Verde, and of
Mozambique as the authentic repre¬
sentatives of the true aspirations of
the peoples of these territories.
Unesco is collaborating directly with
the liberation movements in these
territories, providing educational aid
and technical assistance, etc. (see
page 23).
Unesco's position has been summed
up by its Director-General, René
Maheu. In October 1972, addressing
the Unesco General Conference in
Paris, he declared:
"Two States (Portugal and South
Africa) have of their own accord with¬
drawn from Unesco because of the
obvious incompatibility of their racist
or colonialist policies with the ideals
of Unesco and its action to pro¬
mote human rights. The firmness
shown towards these States by the
General Conference is, in my opinion,
fully justified since it is based on con¬
siderations of justice which are
Unesco's raison d'être. Unesco is a
militant organization. But this in no
way means that we cannot hope
indeed fervently desire that these
peoples with their many remarkable
talents and achievements in other
fields, will reject the inhuman policies
which for the time being have separa¬
ted them from us and that they will
soon rejoin us."
This report Is essentially based on a publi¬
cation of the Office of Public Information of
the United Nations entitled "A Principle in
Torment: The United Nations and Portuguese
Administered Territories".

Continued from page 27

Africans can afford the basic annual
university fee of 1,000 escudos, plus a
further 400-650 escudos (depending
on the course taken).
If we accept the claim of Portugal
that Angola is a province of that
country, then, in primary education,
Angola not only falls far behind the
advanced countries, but also behind
some of the developing countries.
The higher the level of education, the
fewer enrolled. This trend accentuates
if we consider the African population
alone. Only a few get beyond primary
level, and practically none get to
university.
It seems reasonable to conclude
that the new educational policy in the
colonies (since the beginning of the
1960s) does not seek to advance the
African population; that the consider¬
able quantitative improvement during
the sixties has not been at all levels,
but only at the lowest, i.e. in primary
education; that the standard now
reached is still very low; that qualita¬
tive progress has been small, and par¬
ticularly so with regard to the edu
cation of the African population.
One may also conclude that Africans
are still discriminated against in edu¬
cation by social and financial barriers,
and that the access to education is
made especially difficult at the second¬
ary and higher levels; that there is
practically no African participation in
the scientific activities of the colonies;
that the State has done practically
nothing about research; and that the
extent of the State's financial invest¬
ment in education and science affords
little evidence of a concern for edu¬
cation in the colonies and, hence, for
the education of the African popu¬
lation.
Such efforts as Portugal made to
provide education for Africans were
imposed by the development needs of
Portuguese colonialism itself, by the
international situation, and in parti¬
cular by the demonstration the lib¬
eration movements provided of an
alternative to Portuguese domination.
Portugal did undoubtedly succed in
forming an African elite which, though
few in numbers, provided an African
petty bourgeoisie, and encouraged
African officials and managers of
small scale business to ally themselves
with Portugal. The need for such
managers could lead to a neo-colo-
nialist solution which could then be
regarded as a "success" for Portu¬
guese educational policy, but would
certainly do little to improve the status
of the African population.
Finally, we quote the Provincial
Secretary for Education in Angola:
"In the matter of relations between
Europeans and coloured people's, it
cannot be denied that we are the only
ones whose ideas and solutions have
remained unaltered overseas since the
very beginning. We have a mountain
of irrefutable historical documents
that prove this. Everything we have
done... in regards to teaching and edu¬
cation, everywhere we have set foot,
provides undeniable proof of this.
Indeed, it is from what a civilizing
nation does in regard to teaching and
education overseas that the true nature
of its intentions can be learnt."

Arms costs top spending
on education
The world spends far more each year
on arms than it does on education, reports
Unesco in a special study prepared for
the 34th International Conference on Edu¬
cation held recently in Geneva. In 1970,
$197,000 million was allocated to military
spending against $161,000 million for edu¬
cation. Arms budgets represented 6.4 per
cent of the world's gross national product
and education 5.2 per cent.
World Development
Information Day
October 24, United Nations Day, was
also marked this year for the first time
as World Development Information Day.
Proposed by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing,
French Minister of Finance, at the Third
U.N. Conference on Trade and Devel¬
opment, in Santiago, last year, the
suggestion was unanimously adopted and
later endorsed by the U.N. General Assem¬
bly. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing suggested that
all the world's information media should
devote programmes to "a description in
human terms of the inadequacy of our
development effort", and that schools
should devote lessons to the subject.
Children unite
to save the whale
An international children's campaign to
save whales has been launched by "Project
Jonah", an international society devoted
to the protection and study of whales.
Over 2 million whales have been killed
over the past 50 years, half a million
during the 1960s alone, and several species
are in danger of extinction. The children's
campaign aims at a total ban or, at least,
a 10 year moratorium on all commercial
whaling.

ed by the Shahinshah of Iran, goes to
Emma Espina, Sergio Arevalo and Arnulfo
Rubilar for developing new teaching
methods used in Chile and now being tried
out in Panama and Bolivia. The 1973
Nadezhda K. Krupskaya Prize, sponsored
by the U.S.S.R., was won by the West Lake
Region literacy project in Tanzania, where
250,000 persons have been made literate
during the past three years. The awards

U.N. General Assembly resolutions
of 1966 and 1967 terminated South
Africa's mandate over the Territory
and appointed a U.N. Council to
administer the Territory until inde¬
pendence was achieved. South Afri¬
ca has ignored the U.N. action and
continues, illegally, to administer the
Territory (see page 8, first column).
The new stamps are printed in deno¬

Letters to the Editor
WASTEFUL, DESTRUCTIVE
TRAWL-FISHING
Sir,
There are not many things that I can
write or talk about with authority. But
I do know quite a bit about trawl-fishing.
I was trawling from 1928 to 1953 (war
years excepted).
Trawling is a wilful, wasteful, de¬
structive method of fishing. I can quote
many personal experiences to prove It.
Even as a boy, I was appalled at the
fish market by the utter disregard of
officials, trawler owners, fish merchants
and others to the fact that tons of
immature fish, lots of them never having
had the chance to spawn even once,
were being landed every day.
Tons of halibut, 4 lbs to 11 lbs in
weight were landed in the early 1920s
at Grimsby in England. Ten years later
all the line-fishing boats were converted
. to trawling because there were no large
halibut to catch. When mature, these
fish weigh up to 400 lbs.
I plead with you to make out a case
for outlawing trawl-fishing by all nations,
at the Conference to be held at San¬
tiago, Chile, next year.
Twice, at the eleventh hour, the fishing
industry has been saved by the out¬
break of war. In the spawning season
the spawn that has already been "shot"
is destroyed by the trawls churning up
the mud and sand on the sea bed.
When line-fishing you can control
the size of fish that you catch by the
size of hook you use. Seine-netting for
such fish as plaice, dab, sole, brill, etc.
is better than trawling for them. The
"Seiners" can only work "fine" ground.
Therefore the fish can find some refuge
in the rough ground.
Drift nets for catching herring, etc.
is the only sane way. The small are

so with trawl and purse nets. These

ABSOLUTELY WRONG
Sir,
A correction is needed for the caption
of the glazed faience (presumably; not
earthenware) bowl shown on page 32
of the June 1973 issue of the "Unesco
Courier". The two objects between the
eyes are not lutes, but are the
hieroglyph representing the heart-and-
windpipe which stands for the word
nefer, "good", for an unknown reason.
This is one of the commonest Egyptian
hieroglyphs and is often erroneously
identified as a lute by the layman. The
eyes themselves are the eyes of the
god Horus, human eyes with the
markings of those of a falcon; in any
case, a nose would be out of place.
I am sure that the bowl is of blue
faience and an Egyptian import (not
of local Syrian manufacture). The
hieroglyphs would read something like:
"The wadjet-eye (the eye of Horus)
[brings or is] every goodness"; there is
no verb. The repetition of the signs Is
the equivalent of the superlative.
The Egyptian Expedition of the Metro¬
politan Museum of Art found the best
and earliest (and at the time, the only
known) actual example of an Egyptian
lute, though lutes are often shown In
wall paintings.

TASTY MORSEL
Sir,
I am 13-years old and live in Siberia,
U.S.S.R. I must say that I find the
16-page children's supplement about
Nlcolaus Copernicus in your April 1973
issue just wonderful. It was so easy
to follow unlike those given in our
children's encyclopaedias. However, it
makes one realize fully the meaning of
Copernicus' discoveries for the world.
I literally swallowed the sixteen pages
devoted to this great man.
I feel that your magazine helped me
to get to know more about Copernicus.
When you write about other world
celebrities, I urge you not to forget
the younger generation. We teenagers
are no less ardent readers of the
"Courier" than grown-ups.

FROM THE OCEANS
TO THE HEAVENS
Sir,
Your impressive issue on Underwater
Archaeology (May 1972) announced the
publication of a Unesco book on the
subject. I would like to suggest the
publication of two more books. One
book would present well-known under¬
water archaeologists telling about their
most famous digs, the instruments they
used and their experiences. The
second would be a detailed account of
historic cities such as Port Royal which
have been swallowed by the oceans.
Also I was impressed by your April
1973 issue dealing with Nicolaus Coper¬
nicus, where there was a supplement
for children by Jean-Claude Pecker.
I think this ¡s a good Idea for all
"Unesco Courier" issues.

PUSHKIN YEAR
Sir,
The summer of 1974 will see celeb¬
rations on the occasion of the 175th
anniversary of the birth of Alexander
S. Pushkin, the great Russian poet who
also won a name for himself In world
literature.
This memorable date is going to be
observed not only in this country but
surely throughout the world. Let year
1974 be Pushkin's year.
No doubt Unesco will also participate
in major international events to mark
the occasion.

IN THE FOOTSTEPS
OF COPERNICUS
Sir,
In his article "In the Footsteps of
Copernicus" ("Unesco Courier", April
1973) Jerzy Bukowski makes Copernicus
out to be a Polish astronomer. I
strongly deny this assertion. I wish to
publicly refute this, in my view, flagrant
distortion of history.

MORAL POLLUTION
Sir,
Your January 1973 issue on problems
of the environment made fascinating
reading, particularly Miguel Ozario'de
Almeida's article "The Myth of Ecolo¬
gical Equilibrium". Without closing his
eyes to the real problems of the
environment and of pollution, he makes
short work of several Neo-Malthusian
aberrations of the Zero-growth type,
demographic as well as economic.
But what about another equally
serious form of pollution moral
pollution.
An example of topical interest in
many countries, as an especially serious
form of moral pollution, are the cam¬
paigns for the legalization of abortion.
These campaigns run directly counter
to the 1959 United Nations Declaration
of the Rights of Children, which states:
"...the child, by reason of his physical
and mental Immaturity, needs special
safeguards and care, Including appro¬
priate legal protection, before as well
as after birth..."
I think you should remind readers
of this Declaration, voted unanimously
by the U.N. General Assembly on
November 20, 1959. Its provisions
should be effectively applied in all
countries.

The vast Makonde plat¬
eau spanning the fron¬
tier between Mozambique
to the south and Tanzania
to the north has given its
name to the East African
people who inhabit it.
The Makonde have con¬
tributed many fighters for
the Mozambique Libera¬
tion Front Movement.
Other Makonde have been
forced into exile in Tan¬
zania. The Makonde are
renowned for their sculp¬
ture in wood. Modern
works, such as this styliz¬
ed ebony head, remark¬
able for its balance, fluid¬
ity and movement, reveal
the high artistic original¬
ity of the Makonde cul¬
ture (see story and photos
