Two worlds in the Mediterranean
1995, oil on cardboard-backed canvas
(55 cm. x 46 cm.)
by Fadila Morsly
This painting by Algerian artist Fadlla Morsly is an
evocation of the quest for "a common destiny" in the
Mediterranean basin by Muslim and Western civilizations,
each with its long history. The two worlds face each other
against the backcloth of a "turbid Mediterranean", but are
"traversed by a ray of fruitful solidarity, like a laser beam
symbolizing modernity". They are enclosed in a matrix of
signs both formal (square, eight-pointed star, semi-circle)
and informal (arabesques) evoking contact between
cultures and "a moment of questing and truth".

### 104367: Biodiversity is a guarantee of evolution: interview with Werner Arber
interview
g
Werner Arber
i tion
Swiss microbiologist Werner Arber
shared the 1978 Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Mediane with Daniel
Nathans and Hamilton Smith for their
discovery of enzymes that protect
bacteria against viral infections.
Known as the restriction and
modification system, it has proved to
be extremely useful in molecular
biology and genetic engineering. In
this interview with Serafín García
Ibañez, Werner Arber talks about the
relations between science and
society, especially questions arising
from advances in genetics.
What is biodiversity?
Werner Arber: There are an estimated 10 mil¬
lion animal species in the world. Biodiversity
is widely regarded as referring to diversity of
species. But there is also great genetic
diversity within each species. And ecosys¬
tems that are home to a large number of dif¬
ferent species also contain an equally large
variety from one place to another. All this is
biodiversity.
Not all of these species have been
identified, have they?
W. A.: Far from it. A lot of them are unknown
to us. About four million of them have been

### 104367: Biodiversity is a guarantee of evolution: interview with Werner Arber
listed, if that; everything depends on geo¬
graphical location, habitat and type of organ¬
ism. A lot of micro-organisms, for example,
which are my speciality, have not been
described because they can't be cultivated
in the laboratory. The only ones we know
well are those that can be studied in vitro.
So, many species are bom and disappear
without our knowing about them?
W. A.: Biodiversity is the result of a long
process of biological evolution that continu¬
ally produces new genetic forms. So it is
clear that in the past living beings have dis¬
appeared, and that more will be born in
future the like of which this planet has
never seen. A new species is the fruit of
numerous mutations that occur in succes¬
sive and distinct stages. Biodiversity as we
know it today is not static; it n: ilect s the
world as it is at a given moment, and its
composition changes constantly.
What is a mutation?
W. A.: It is a change in the sequence of a
DNA molecule. A sequence is the linear
repetition of the four base elements (which
are designated by the letters A, C, G and T)
in this molecule, which contains genetic
information. A mutation occurs when one
letter replaces another, either by cancelling
or by inserting one of these letters at certain
places in the sequence. With the help of
specific enzymes, entire segments of this tiny
piece of DNA can be rearranged.
How can we protect species we don't even
know exist?
W. A.: The best way to protect them is to
keep their living conditions whatever they
may be stable. But that's easier said than
done. How is it possible to keep living con¬
ditions absolutely stable? A host of changes,
not counting those caused by people, can
modify the temperature, the humidity rate
or any other parameter of the environment,
so that living conditions on the planet are
never entirely stable.
When we attack viruseswhich we
automatically assume to be harmfulcan we
be sure that they are not vital for other
ecosystems and even for the preservation of
biodiversity as a whole?
W. A.: People imagine on the basis of their
own experience that micro-organisms are
their enemies because some micro-organisms
cause diseases. It has to be accepted, bow-
ever, that the great majority of these micro¬
organisms are very useful, not only to peo¬
ple but to nature in general. They can, for
example, break down certain toxins very
quickly.
Are we not, therefore, playing with fire by
trying to change and improve certain forms of
life through biotechnologies?
W. A.: Bisks are always involved in this kind
of application, but there are ways of control¬
ling them. We must accept responsibility for
establishing long-term strategies, in several
stages, so that these risks can be assessed
through experimentation.
Can science today create life fro m
inorganic matter?
W. A.: No. Several theories currently seek to
explain bow certain Inorganic molecules are
produced by physico-chemical reactions,
but this is still a far cry from being able to
create a being endowed with the functions
necessary for what is called life, namely
metabolism, reproduction, assimilation and
so forth. But not all scientists agree on this
subject. Some think that in the near future
science will have advanced to the point
where we shall know more about the mech¬
anisms of life and perhaps even be able to
partly construct a living entity in the labo¬
ratory. Others, including myself, think that
life is more complicated, and none of this is
feasible in the near future. I am always fas¬
cinated by the elegance of certain molecu¬
lar mechanisms, and I feel we should think
ourselves very fortunate to be able to
understand nature and watch it at work.
M The progress of research in human and
plant genetics opens up all kinds of
Some of the fears associated with the
applications of genetics arise from the fact that
some scientists overestimate their powers.

speculation. What do you think of people's
hopes and fears in this respect?
W. A.: We should be sceptical about the
claims of certain scientists. In the 1950s and
1960s we heard promises that it would soon
be possible to cure cancer. It's the same story
today with the Aids virus. It was thought
that once the virus was identified, it would
only be a matter of time before the disease
could be treated. But it's not as simple as
that. And as far as the fears are concerned,
as I've said, it is a matter of responsibility, for
wc can assess by means of experimentation
the risks involved in a given application.
There is no general rule; we have to proceed
on a casc-by-case basis. It is also true that
some fears associated with the applications of
genetics arise from the fact that some scien¬
tists overestimate their powers and claim that
anything is possible, whereas in reality things
are much more complicated.
Do research and researchers need a
normative framework?
W. A.: I think it's important to define stan¬
dards that should be respected, and also
that these standards should be revised from
time to time. Some applications may prove
useful and even necessary. Others may be
dangerous. All the factors should be taken
into account.
Biodiversity is no respecter of frontiers. Is
International agreement needed to preserve
it?
W. A.: I think that a certain biodiversity is
necessary for evolution. If too many biologi¬
cal functions were to disappear in a short
period of time, it would take a long time
thousands of years before some of them
reappeared. Knowing that species disappear
partly because of physical and chemical
changes in their environment (in tempera¬
ture or humidity rates, for example) and
that the activities of our civilization have an

impact on these changes at the planetary
level, awareness of the problems must be
world-wide. If one state makes a decision
without consulting the others, it doesn't
help anyone. We must act together, we must
co-operate. We cannot bring the economic
machine to a standstill, but we must, for
example, devote the smallest possible area
of land to food production. Above all and
this is the major problem we must reduce
air and water pollution.
Do you think there isa limit to the
numbers of people the planet can feed?
W. A.: There arc two possible answers to this
question, but first of all you have to define
a humanly acceptable quality of life. What
criteria should be adopted? Those of the
industrialized countries or those of coun¬
tries with a traditional economy? In the lat¬
ter case, the figures may vary, but in the
former and it is clear that most human
beings would prefer this way of life there
are already too many of us for the planet's
resources.
M Our world seems increasingly dependent on
technological and scientific data. Should
scientists play a more important role in states'
political and decision-making machinery?
W. A.: Research is a full-lime job that leaves
hardly any time for anything else. As far as
I'm concerned, I think it's a good thing that
politics are the concern of another category
of the population than researchers, but
contacts between the two categories could
be a lot more fruitful than they are at pre¬
sent. Some aspects of scientific research also
have implications that go further than mere
technological applications, forming part of
the broader field of philosophy and its use in
helping us to understand our world. To take
one example, molecular genetics teaches us
that certain genes involved in mutations are
involved on a random rather than a consis¬
tent basis. Nevertheless, these genes are
necessary not only for the short lifespan of
the individual but also for the evolution of
the population as a whole, so that it can
adapt to other environmental conditions that
may possibly develop. This is the kind of
information that it would be instructive to
integrate into our picture of the world. I

Denmark has agreed to provide Unesco with $21 million over
the next four years, i.e. an average of $5.25 million a year. The
funds will be allocated to activities that are in line with Den¬
mark's development policies in the fields of education, the en¬

SCIENCE AND CULTURAL
HERITAGE
An impressive battery of new technologies for examining and
preserving the world's cultural heritage were reviewed at a re¬
cent symposium held at Unesco's Paris Headquarters. The
techniques included ground-penetrating radar, three-dimen¬

FREEDOM VIOLATIONS
The 7th Annual Report on Press Freedom worldwide*, published by the French non¬
governmental organization Reporters Sans Frontières (478 pages, 90 francs) records
violations of the right to inform and be informed in 149 countries. 51 journalists were
killed in 1995 (three-quarters of them in Africa, especially Algeria) and nearly 400 im¬
prisoned for doing their job or expressing opinions counter to those held by their coun¬
tries' rulers. The report notes two new forms of repression: the subordination of jus¬
tice to political interests and the implementation of legislative reforms that limit free¬
dom of the press in several countries of eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, North
Africa and the Middle East. In Western nations such as France, Germany and Austria,
violence by extreme right-wing groups and extremist nationalist movements is im¬
posing a heavy burden on the work of the press.

### 104370: The Darkness and light of exile
MONTH BY MONTH... MONTH BY MONTH...
The darkness and light
Is the state of exile, which was for so long the
exception, now becoming the rule?
To be expelled from a community in the far-
off times when communities regulated every
detail of their members' lives was tantamount to
receiving a death sentence. Not only did exiles
face the future alone, bereft of the protection of
the group, they also forfeited all contact with their
ancestors and with their gods, as well as the possi¬
bility of setting up hearth and home. An individ¬
ual banished from a community was a lost soul.
For communities themselves, exile was a col¬
lective disaster when, after being defeated in an
unequal struggle, their survivors were reduced to
slavery. The victors severed the tics of continuity
that bound the defeated peoples to their past,
keeping them alive for callous exploitation as
beasts of burden with no identity as human beings.
It is true that there were more tolerable forms
of exile. Exceptional people princes, doctors,
engineers or artists who were constrained to
leave their homeland, usually for political rea¬
sons, might sometimes live comfortable lives and
even enjoy privileges and positions of influence
in prosperous states. But they never ceased to be
foreigners. An essential part of them remained
anchored in a homeland that became mytholo-
gized by time, nostalgia and regret.
With the colonial conquests of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, the notion ' of exile
changed. The great voyages of discovery,
advances in navigational instruments and tech¬
niques, and the growth of a permanent network
of exchange across the oceans paved the way for
a global market. In the course of time, large num¬
bers of people emigrated in search of regions
more politically clement or more economically

### 104371: A Land of no return
A LAND OF NO RETUR
Exiles live
between t\
xile is a time when people experi¬
ence, often painfully, an almost
carnal attachment to the territory
(country, native soil, homeland)
and group (family, relatives, com¬
munity, nation) they come from. That area,
which has fashioned each and every one of us,
and which we have ourselves fashioned for
our own purposes, is also an area of nostalgia,
of homesickness. Homesickness is a word
which contains both the cause and the cure.
Nostalgia, feeding as it does on the illusion that
the cure (going home) will cure the sickness
by removing its cause (exile), triggers off an
emotionally charged process of memorization,
reminiscence and imagination. It has the effect
of sanctifying the places on which it focuses
and thus puts time and place on the same
plane, suggesting that the abolition of one will
result in the abolition of the other.
But exile does not always take the same
form. Sometimes it is long, and sometimes
not so long; sometimes it is permanent, and
sometimes temporary. In some cases there is
no choice (as when a person is banished,
deported or forced to flee); in others, exile is
intentional at least apparently so. Sometimes
the outcome depends solely on the person
concerned; sometimes it hinges on the good¬
will of a third party. Nor does nostalgia always
take the same form. A political exile's nostalgia
is different from an immigrant's, an émigré
worker's different from a colonizer's. It varies
depending on the relationship exiles have
with their native country and with their
adopted country.
That dual relationship varies with time,
which itself influences the perception exiles
have of where they belong. Awareness of
links and differences such as place and
milieu, past and present, and the "here" and
the "elsewhere" modulates nostalgic anxiety
and melancholy.
Here, there and nowhere
In the last analysis, nostalgia expresses the
essence of exile: an impossible quest to be
here and there at the same time and all the
time. It is fuelled by the duality of two
simultaneous lives experienced on two dif-

ferent planes, those of reality and desire
the reality of an active life, lived in the pre¬
sent, pregnant with materiality, immediacy
and everydayness, and the desire that is
inherent in a secret and wholly internal life
consisting of memories and imaginings of
something which is no more, but which may
yet come into being again, a life superim¬
posed on one's actual life.
Even if the "elsewhere" of nostalgia is
constantly being modified and embellished
by exile, it nonetheless remains something
which has already been experienced. It is
familiar and "native". In this respect,
ABDELMALEKSAYAD
is an Algerian sociologist.
Odysseus may be regarded as the prototype
of the exile wandering in search of his or her
country, and The Odyssey as the account of
that exile and the homecoming, in other
words the cure for nostalgia. It seems as if
his return to Ithaca totally compensates for
his departure ten years earlier. But that kind
of homecoming and the ending of nostalgia
that it implies are not as easy or as automatic
as one might think.
A bittersweet
homecoming
Odysseus does not sail the seas because he
likes sailing, or because he responds to the call
of the deep or the attractions of wide open
skies. Homer's hero, unlike Dante's, who
passes through the Columns of Hercules to
venture out on to the ocean in search of new
horizons, could be any emigré who simply
yearns to return home after suffering the
ordeal of absence a notion later expressed
more prosaically by another well-known
exile, Victor Hugo: "One cannot live without
bread; but one cannot live without a homeland
either." There is a difference though: through¬
out his wanderings, Odysseus constantly pre¬
pares the way for his homecoming and
embarks on a series of ordeals, each of which,
as it is overcome, brings him a little closer to
his final goal. What is more, he is determined
to return home as master in his own house, so
he can restore things to their former state, as
though his ten years' absence did not matter.
Odysseus's homecoming causes none of
the disappointment which almost always

replaces nostalgia when the long-awaited
remedy proves incapable of curing the sick¬
ness. When people return home they are
never the same as they were when they
started out; they never return to the place
they think they have left. The homecoming,
for exiles, is a return to themselves, to the
time preceding their departure. It is at once a
retrospective and a time of retrospection. A
return is possible in space but not in time. It
gives rise to all sorts of hopes, but it is a
source of disappointment and frustration.
Disappointment, which is something
Homer's Odysseus does not experience,
dogs his modern successors, such as the
central character of Nikos Kazantzakis's The
Odyssey, a Modern Sequel, a book which
begins where Homer's epic leaves off. As
soon as Odysseus has comfortably settled in
his palace, he is racked by anxiety. He begins
to get bored and dreams of setting off again.
He thinks back to the fabulous lands he
glimpsed and spurned. Departure and
return continually echo each other. There is
the pleasure of having come home. But
there is above all the pleasure of constant
homecoming, which requires one to be
always going away. If nostalgia is not to turn
into disappointment, homecoming has to be
kept in abeyance.

arge numbers of men and women
left India during the nineteenth
century to work as coolies in
countries where the practice of
' slavery had recently been officially
abolished. Out of their exile grew a pattern
of life and poetics which might be called
"coolitudc".
It is impossible to understand the essence
of "coolitude" without charting the coolies'
voyage across the seas. That decisive experi¬
ence, that coolie odysscy, left an indelible
stamp on the imaginary landscape of coolitude.
As the time to sail drew near, a first taboo
needed to be broken. Hindus who cross the
ocean, which is peopled with hooghlis (mon¬
sters), cut themselves off from the sacred
waters of the River Ganges. They are
doomed to wander eternally and lose any
chance of reincarnation. It seems that the
British placed huge cauldrons of water from
the Ganges on board ship so that emigrants
could perform their ritual ablutions. The
subterfuge apparently induced the most
reluctant voyagers to entrust their souls to
the world beyond the seas.
It was the first time most coolies had
ever seen the sea, the first time they found
themselves on the verge of the unknown,
wrenched away from their traditional view
of the world. An age-old social taboo was
also broken when Indians of every caste
were packed into the steerage, which was
open to the skies. They were equal before
life and death on the ocean even though the
voyage would only last ten days or so they
had been promised. Ten days soon go by.
And yet as the ship cast off its moorings they
all knew deep down that to leave your native
land is a form of death.
An angry silence
There is a parallel between the coolies'
predicament and that agonizing moment
when slave ships weighed anchor off the
African coast, with their cargo of chained
slaves in their holds. That instant was marked
by what the West Indian writer Edouard
Glissant has called "the scream from the
hold", a primal utterance from deep in the
slaves' flesh, which would erupt beyond time
and space, demanding an explanation from
History and reconstructing their History.
Slaves often spent the crossing stretched
out in chains. Coolies enjoyed relative free¬
dom of movement: they could see the
coastline disappearing into the distance and
watch the stars, phosphorescent trails, an
approaching cyclone in other words they
witnessed a slow evaporation of their earlier

AN INHUMAN
SYSTEM
The abolition of slavery in the British colonies in
1834 and in the French colonies in 1849 led to a
labour shortage on the colonial plantations. To
compensate for this, Western traders took foreign
contract workers. India's economic difficulties at
the time encouraged a massive outflow of mainly
unskilled emigrants.
Coolies (the word comes from the Hindi Mi,
an aboriginal tribal name, or from Tamil kuli,
"wages") voluntarily signed contracts whose terms
were very harsh, but they were often duped or
press-ganged into signing. While awaiting shipment
they were cooped up in insalubrious depots, then
packed on to boats in inhuman conditions. Many
of them did not survive the journey.
The exodus resulted in sometimes large Indian
communities becoming established in certain
colonies. These included Mauritius, Reunion Island
and Madagascar in the southern Indian Ocean, the
Fiji islands in the Pacific, Malaysia, Burma and
Ceylon in southeast and southern Asia, Kenya,
Tanganyika, Uganda, Zanzibar and Natal in Africa,
Trinidad and Jamaica in the West Indies, and British
Guiana and Surinam in South America.
Indian workers thus played a key role in the
expansion of colonial economies. But in many
countries, particularly in Africa, they were denied
basic civil rights and suffered from racial discrimina¬
tion, which Gandhi denounced many times during
his years in South Africa, putting into practice his
principle of satyägraha, or non-violent action, for
the first time there in 1906.

being. The coolie's carefully pondered, vol¬
untary voyage was already a form of inter¬
mixing, physical contact with a different
poetics, a different world-view. Coolies
"knew" where they were going. They
would think about their separation, devise a
strategy for survival and settling down, and
work out their place in the new existential
structure that would take them in.
The Bhagavad Gita
written from memory
The children of "coolitude" shared with the
children of "creolity" the "scream from the
hold", the moment of silence that replaces
the scream at being wrenched away and
then, as in the early days of the slave trade,
develops into amnesia, whether intentional
or not. In any history, the unsaid is often
blotted out or pushed into the background,
as though the best way of censoring a painful
past were to surround it with dense silence.
This is where the coolie non-text, or pre¬
text, comes in: it is, in a sense, a statement
that is repressed ahead of exile.
Slaves experienced that moment knowing

thought of suicide. Coolies, on the other hand,
experienced their uprooting in real time, with¬
out bearings between heaven and earth. They
came up against a culture of sailors and a lan¬
guage they did not speak well (except for a few
educated Brahmins). Their voyage had begun
with a piece of trickery: the crossing actually
took almost a month. They had plenty of time
to think about their fate and to understand that
the deceit had already begun with their con¬
tracts. It was there, in a legal framework, that
they would concentrate their efforts to
become emancipated.
Coolies had a culture of the written word,
and they set off on their voyage with books:
the Qur'an, the Bhagavad Gita and the
Ramayana. These sacred texts were part and
parcel of their journey. The Coolie Museum in
Moka, Mauritius, possesses a copy of the
Bhagavad Gita which coolies wrote out from
memory so as to bring a token of their original
culture to the country where they had been
contracted to work. This is indisputable evi¬
dence that a struggle against deculturation took
place. Coolies clung to their founding texts.
The "strategies of deviation" described by
the West Indian writers Jean Bernabé, Patrick
Chamoiseau and Raphaël Confiant1 were
more in evidence among African slaves, who
were imbued with a civilization based on oral
expression. This partly explains the greater lin¬
guistic inventiveness shown by the deseen- 1

### 104372: The Coolies' odyssey
THE CONCEPT OF 'COOLITUDE'
The first pages of the history of "coolitude" were written as soon as India
was left behind in the spray of the Indian Ocean. The concept of "coolitude"
is based on two pillars. Firstly, the reconstitution of a memory, which veers
between an imagination drawn back to the atavistic homelandIndianness as
a set of inalienable values bequeathed by India since the beginning of time
and the constellation of signs spawned by the uneasy interaction of the
exiled Indian's values with the cultures of the host country. Secondly, the
contribution of a poetics based on the Indian element and shaped by the
fact that the coolie was chronologically the last arrival to contribute to the
making of diversified societies. D K. T.
Ooolies took with them the
classic texts of their culture.

dants of slaves, whereas coolies were happy
for most of the time to transfer or extend their
texts into a universe other than their own,
Creoles felt they had to invent a cosmogony
and a poetics. Coolies effected a transfer of
their own universe to their host country: they
rewrote and transposed their semiological ref¬
erents to their new country. Thus, anchored
to their founding texts, coolies promised
themselves that if they reached the Promised
Land alive they would repay their fare and
own land in their turn.
A symbolic wound
The Indian worker's pragmatic view of things
had a decisive bearing on literary creation and
on writing, which coolies abandoned in favour
of the Maati, or the earth-mother, a guarantee
of their continuity and a veritable "matrix
text". Their work in exile then took on a cos¬
mogonie value. And it is here that one can
sense that strong and sensual impregnation of
language, that poetics of the diverse in which
creolity and "coolitude" come together.
As soon as the coolies disembarked, their
traumatic voyage at an end, their captain tore
out, usually in great haste, the pages of the
register bearing the names of the new
arrivals. The pages were held in place by
indented metal clips, hence the term "inden¬
tured labourers", from the root dens (tooth),
which was often applied to coolies.
These striated pages were symbolic of
the wound inflicted on Indian patronymics,
which were violated by being Latinized,
forms which are still used for islanders of
non-European origin. This is the most signif¬
icant metaphor of "coolitude" for it sets
the seal on the wound to identity and lan¬
guage and is the visual mark of the coolie's
place in the language. Coolies always felt out
of place and were afraid of making mistakes
in their master's language, and even in creóle,
the language of the emancipated.
Coolie authors often wrote in their
ancestral languages, such as Hindi, Tamil and
Urdu. But they allowed a large number of
outside influences to enter their language.
The mosaic thus created is a trace writ large
of the exile shared by the children of "cooli¬
tude" and creolity.

i Odyssey of exiled artists,
Aninitiatory, rite above all else,
but also a journey into the
labyrinth and a descent into
hell, exile is a source of inspira¬
tion and a revcaler of personal¬
ity. For people who live in exile whether
voluntarily or involuntarily their old life
ends, a new one begins. Whether their exile
is internal, external, political, economic or
cultural, it produces a fundamental spiritual
and moral change in them.
Exile has always existed. From the forced
march of the Hebrews described in the Bible
to Dante's banishment, it has been a regular
feature of Western history and imagination.
But never have exile and exodus been more
systematic and widespread than in the twen¬
tieth century.
In the 1930s, many intellectuals were
forced to flee Nazi Germany and the occu¬
pied countries in order to escape the jack¬
boot. Sigmund Freud, Karl Popper and Elias
Canetti left Vienna for London. Bertolt
Brecht and Thomas Mann took refuge in the
United States. Stefan Zweig went to Brazil,
where he committed suicide. But being an
expatriate (from the Latin expatriare, "to
leave one's native country") is not easy, and
all exiles are foreigners obsessed with retain¬
ing their human dignity.
But it was the Soviet Union which, more
even than Nazi Germany, became the twen¬
tieth century's biggest generator of exile.
Vast numbers of people left that land of ban¬
ishment in search of freedom of conscience,
thought and expression. The indifference
and cynicism of the contemporary world
were finally swept away by the publication
of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag
Archipelago. The banished Solzhenitsyn is
one of this century's great men of con¬
science. Recent events in the former
Yugoslavia and in Rwanda (to mention only
two examples) have shown that history
repeats itself, but above all that human
beings continue to exile each other, succes¬
sively taking on the roles of banisher and
banished, torturer and victim.
Voluntary exiles, whether they be intel¬
lectuals, thinkers or writers, adjust to their
condition. They adopt new countries and
sometimes even new languages. People like
René Descartes in Holland, Voltaire, who
took refuge first in England, then near
Geneva, Joseph Conrad, who adopted
English culture and the English language,
Lawrence Durrell in the Middle East and
many other well-known and less well-
known figures alternate between isolation
and adoption according to a sophisticated

and sometimes elusive process whereby the
distinction between voluntary and involun¬
tary exile is sometimes blurred, even to the
point of vanishing altogether. The odyssey of
people like Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall,
Wassily Kandinsky, Albert Camus, Samuel
Beckett and Mircea Eliade has marked the
scientific, literary and artistic history of the
twentieth century.
A testing time
"One inhabits not a country but a language,"
the Romanian essayist Emil Cioran said of
writers, who form a case apart. Is not the
writer always somewhere else? That con¬
ception of the homeland could explain why
so few writers Conrad, Ionesco, Cioran
himself have written in a language other
than their own.
Experience has taught me that the most
gruelling and frustrating form of exile is prob¬
ably the exile that exists at home the exile
that precedes the physical act of departure.
After I had inherited, under the iron rule of
communism, the mark of dishonour branded
on my father, a political prisoner, I was not
allowed to occupy any social rank other than
that of a manual worker on building sites. The
need to understand, to explain and also to
imagine made me take refuge in writing,
where I won back my freedom of thought
and expression. In the end, censorship forced
me into physical exile, far from my family, my
friends and my home. I am an expatriate in
the literal sense of the term: I am neither
Romanian, nor French, nor even an exile. I
am a writer, and my only homeland is writing.
If exile is an initiation test, it is also a test of
the truth. It entails shedding one's illusions
and the world of wishful thinking and pre¬
tence, and arriving at a kind of lucidity. It
means learning how to winnow out the wheat
from the chaff by discarding bogus tolerance,
which produces a semblance of inner peace,
in favour of real tolerance, which requires
one to immerse oneself in the universal.
In the end we have all experienced exile at
one time or another in our lives. The main
thing is to understand it and to try to bring out
its metaphysical dimension by surpassing our¬
selves. Involuntary exile has become, in my
case, voluntary exile in search of things past
and spiritual resurrection. To accept is already
to effect a return at least to oneself.

### 104398: Travellers from a far country
TRAVELLERS FROM A FAR COUNTRY
Writers are
nature's exiles
he question that writers living in a
foreign country are most often
asked is: "Now that you live away
from your home country, do you
write in the same way as you did
In other words: "Did you bring
your source of inspiration with you, or do
you need a new one?"
Ingenuous questions are often the hard¬
est ones to answer. As if infected by their
naivety, writers answer them naively.
The best answer would be another ques¬
tion: "In our little universe on earth, can you
really be far removed from your country?"
My answer is: "No."
For a true writer, the world is immedi¬
ately perceptible in its entirety, like the view
that opens up when you stand at a window.
This is so not only because of television, as
might be expected, but for a more profound
reason: the full extent of the world is always
present in the consciousness of writers,
whether they like it or not. If it were other¬
wise, their artistic vision would be mutilated,
I he rhapsode,
a Minoan bronze statuette
(2600-1200 B.C.)
severed, and perhaps inoperative. It would
be like using a language without the syntax
that is vital if words are to relate properly to
the expression of ideas.
In various layers of our consciousness
are the Egyptian pyramids, the icecap of the
North Pole, the winds of Siberia, the scorch¬
ing heat of the desert, New York skyscrap¬
ers and Tibetan monasteries. It requires no
effort of the imagination to conjure up these
images, or others such as the crucifixion of
Jesus or Genghis Khan's caravanserai. They
are as familiar and natural to us as the local
post office or the shop around the corner.
It could be argued that the human brain
spontaneously encompasses the full extent
of the world and the course of events which
have fashioned it over thousands of years.
From earliest childhood, people get used to
this scheme of things as if to exorcise their
fears and avoid distress. They often add
other boundless spaces, such as the flames
of hell.
Distance and exile are not just a familiar
condition for the writer. To a large extent
they are part of the creative mechanism
itself.
They are part of the screen of mist with¬
out which it is impossible to draw the divid¬
ing line between the appearance of reality
and its artistic reflection, the necessary dis¬
tance between the creator and life.
Absence has always been part of the cre¬
ative process.
Before writing existed, before even the
concept of "the writer" existed, there were
rhapsodists travellers who came from afar
bringing stories about unknown peoples in
distant lands. They were also the first authors.
Distance stimulated their imagination and
encouraged them to modify landscapes and
to invent human beings different from those
who had existed, or even from those who
had never existed in other words, to create
characters.
In the end, distance meant that they were
not subject to control and thus ensured the
freedom of the creator for the first time.
It could almost be argued that it was in
the nature of creators to create distance in
one way or another.
A combination of political and ideological
factors and writers' quarrels and conflicts
with society probably influences their choice
of exile. But there is also a mysterious quest

which is closely connected with the creative
process.
Yet there is not the slightest contradic¬
tion between exile and a writer's cultural
identity.
On the contrary, exile can strengthen cul¬
tural identity, and at the very moment when
the latter seems to be languishing it becomes
even more real thanks to the universal
dimension it derives from exile.
In general, writers or creators of cultural

values who move to a foreign country are
like the travellers of ancient times, bringing
from afar the more colourful and surprising
aspects of their own country. As for the for¬
eign country that takes them in, the immo¬
bile country that takes in migrants, it is at
least as interested in their fantasies as in their
view of everyday life, if not more so. Thus,
the mechanism works reciprocally: on
either side there is a quest for distance. And
on either side that quest is satisfied.
Looked at from this angle, it could be
argued that writers seek exile when some¬
thing goes awry in their inner creative
processes. Other motives then become less
important. Homer, who in all likelihood did
not settle permanently anywhere, left no
explanation of his movements.
Wandering seemed a natural way of life to
bards and rhapsodists.
The reason why a second great writer,
Aeschylus, emigrated remains obscure, or at
least seems rather poorly justified in purely
political terms. An inability to come to terms
with Greece, or indeed with his times, or
perhaps a row with the jury of a drama con¬
test, may have strongly motivated him, but
that alone cannot explain why this genius
was forced to leave Athens at the age of
sixty-seven.
Dante Alighieri had the bright idea of
opposing the political wrangling between
two hostile clans in his city with the result
that he went into a long exile (in a neighbour¬
ing city). While in exile he wrote one of the
most powerful works of world literature,
the Divine Comedy. Perhaps this was the
real reason why he went into exile.
Political turmoil, especially in the twenti¬
eth century, has prompted thousands of
writers and artists to leave their countries
and scatter to the four corners of the globe.
But even in the fever of politics there is
always something that remains immobile
and in abeyance, "like stars during earth¬
quakes" (as one poet put it). And that is the
fever of creation.
This fever partly explains the reasons for
exile. It decides the fate of exiled creative
artists. It keeps them alive or it destroys
them for ever. During the communist
period, and above all during the transitional
phase before it was swept away, thousands
of writers and artists left the East European
countries, some with clearly-defined objec¬
tives, others driven by a collective psy¬
chosis, a yearning for a more interesting life.
Although the dust of that storm has now set¬
tled and it is easier to see things more clearly,
we are still in no position to identify the real
reasons for a migration on that scale. In any
case we shall need a little more time before
we can appreciate the artistic treasures it
made possible.
In the nineteenth century, when the
Balkan states were in the iron grip of the
Ottoman Empire, their ideologues, leading
thinkers, poets and philosophers left the
Balkans and settled in Western Europe.
From there, they called on their compatriots
to join them in exile. At that time, exile was
an understandable consequence of repres¬
sion. But as the years went by it became
clear to readers of the works they wrote in
exile that exile was necessary to those writ¬
ers primarily so that the importance of the
countries they had left behind could grow
within them.
In such a situation, exile becomes sustain¬
ing and redemptive. When your country
becomes impossible to contemplate, you are
forced to look away. It is said that the Greek
philosopher Democritus blinded himself for
that reason.
Somehow there always comes a day
when, each in our own way, we replicate that
age-old and definitive act.

Does the idea of exile that our civ¬
ilizations share with Antiquity,
the Middle Ages, the Renais¬
sance, and the baroque, classical
and romantic eras, make any
sense in the age of the Internet?
In the past, exiles were people who were
wrenched from their native soil and cut off
from their childhood and mother tongue,
and experienced the heartache of mourning
and nostalgia in a foreign land. Exile was
regarded by the political authorities as a pub¬
lic punishment and civic death. It was a tool
of the penal code which forced individuals
to leave their homeland (or their adopted
home) and forbade them to set foot there
again. Their appetite for life and their
integrity as citizens soured into an endless
season of bitterness and distress as their
uprooting became an incurable disease.
Excluded by historical forces from the land
of their birth, scarred and humiliated by the
loss of their roots, exiles were non-persons
whose lives were totally absorbed in the
desperate quest for paradise lost.
Today we have a broader perception of the
world. The alchemy of exchange and the pro¬
liferation of contacts between civilizations are
accelerating as never before. The witchcraft of
fundamentalist dogmas, the flotsam and jet¬
sam of sects, mental impoverishment the
various forms of barbarity that now flourish
are doomed to fail because of the cross-fertil¬
ization of values and approaches which is
everywhere gaining ground in the relations
between the planet's people, fields of knowl¬
edge and commercial activities.
Such a decisive change, such an enlarge¬
ment of the scale of our experiences, invite
us to take a fresh look at the concept of exile,
together with most of the other traditional
cultural landmarks that we regard as perma¬
nent fixtures. The process of globalization is
bound to phase out the belief that only stay-
at-homes have an identity. As people and
goods move around at dizzying speed and
ideas spread like wildfire from one civiliza¬
tion to another, the situation of the exile
ceases to be cut-and-dried.
Irons in the fire
As for my own story, half a century after
leaving Haïti in 1946, a lifetime's wandering
has led me to find an original answer to the
drama that exile can bring to a writer's life. Far
from Jacmel, my native plot of West Indian
soil, I have learned to stay firmly outside
those closed pockets of ethnicity, those
tensely inward-looking and backward-look¬
ing groups, that exiles of all kinds (and émi¬
grés in general) tend to form in their host
societies. I have always been wary of the
effects of group psychology and the nostalgic
prickliness that hold back migrants' natural
efforts to fit into the values of their adopted
homes. Thanks to my insistence on keeping
two irons in the fire, the sun of home (which
I have lost), and the sun of abroad (which I
have gained), I have managed spontaneously
to be French in Paris, Brazilian in Sào Paulo,
Czech in Prague, Italian in Milan and Cuban
in Havana. These different roots, added to
my Haitian heritage, have produced the
selves, vibrant with all the world's poetry, that
have prepared me to experience with joy and

wisdom the age of multiple identity and cul¬
tural ubiquity that is knocking on our door.
When I arrived in Cuba in March 1959, I
had twelve years of exile in my baggage in
Paris, Prague, Milan and three Latin American
capitals, Santiago de Chile, Buenos Aires and
Sào Paulo. Covered with scars, my head
bursting with the contradictions of the Cold
War, I loathed more than anything the dogma¬
tism, the thought police, the wooden language
and thought, the betrayals, double-think and
compartmentalized morality which were the
redoubtable components of Stalinism and its
terrifying "socialist" realpolitik.
In the early days of my integration into the
Cuban revolution, I felt strongly that Fidelism,
irrigated by Che Guevarism, was capable, in
spite of its youthful vagaries, of putting an end
to the scandals of racism and the other social
defects inherited from colonization. I lived
each day under the illusion that the land of José
Martí, Alejo Carpentier, Ernesto Lecuona,
Nicolás Guillen, Wifredo Lam and Fernando
Ortis would never bring me up against a new
exile. In my heart of hearts, for years on end, in
the midst of the vicissitudes of the new regime,
I thought, and was told again and again by those
around me, that Cuba was my home and that I
was just another Cuban. . . . My Cuban years
were to end in yet another departure.
Adopted homelands
What could I do with so much exile under
my belt, in an elsewhere from Haiti which
occupied in my imagination so many differ¬
ent adopted homelands? Could the absence
of my mother tongue, Haitian creóle, from
my work as a writer and poet, be the sign of
a linguistic exile, the root-metaphor of my
nomadism as a lifelong exile? By exalting my
Haitian identity through the French lan¬
guage and the historic values of the French-
speaking community, was I not betraying
Jacmel, creolity, négritude, the surrealism of
the Haitians, the evenings of a childhood
illuminated by a bewitched reality, by
voodoo legends and spells?
These questions about my identity have
been answered by the life I have lived for
the last ten years as a nomad who has taken
root, as a French citizen in a little town in
provincial France. I know from experience
that identity with a single root is an ethno-
nationalist dogma which is poles apart from
the robust health required by the imagina¬
tion of a writer who is constantly replen¬
ished by drawing on the complementary
resources of his original Haitian home and
the intensely experienced home-life he has
made among the French.
Once when I was in Mauritius I discov¬
ered the banyan, the sacred tree of southeast
Asia whose roots sustain a single trunk from
whose branches aerial roots emanate,
descend into the soil and rise to the surface
as new trunks. My banyan-identity situates
my life and experience as a poet at the oppo¬
site pole to exile.

amount of
talent from the
South
CARMEN GARCIA GUADILLA
is a Venezuelan educator.
In the second half of the twentieth cen¬
tury, many countries of the South began
to send students to the industrialized
countries for further education. They
urgently needed supplies of highly
trained personnel to implement a concept of
development based on modernization.
But many of these students decided to
stay on in the developed countries when
they had finished their training. At the same
time, many professionals who did return
home but no longer felt at ease there also
decided to go back to the countries where
they had studied. This migration was
encouraged by developed countries which
offered attractive conditions to keep the ser¬
vices of those they had trained people
whose training had often been paid for by
their home country.
A difficult return
In the 1960s, some Latin American countries
tried to solve this problem by setting up spe¬
cial "return" programmes to encourage their
professionals to come back home. These pro¬
grammes received support from international
bodies such as the International Organization
for Migration, which in 1974 enabled over
1,600 qualified scientists and technicians to
return to Latin America. Another example
was Argentina's scheme for the repatriation of
political refugees, which was supported by the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
In the 1980s and 1990s, "temporary
return" programmes were set up in order to
make the best use of trained personnel occu¬
pying strategic positions in the developed
countries. This gave rise to the United Nations
Development Programme's Transfer of
Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals
(TOKTEN), which encourages technicians
and scientists to work in their own countries
for short periods.
Globalization
and competition
But the brain drain from these countries
may well increase in response to the new
laws of the international market in knowl¬
edge. The rich countries are far better placed
than the developing countries to attract
and/or to keep brainpower.
Recent studies forecast that the most
developed countries (North America, Japan
and Europe) are going to need more and
more highly qualified professionals around
twice as many as their educational systems
will be able to produce, or so it is thought. As
a result there is an urgent need for developing
countries which send students abroad to give
preference to fields where they need compe¬
tent people to give muscle to their own insti¬
tutions, instead of encouraging the training of
people who may not come back because
there are no professional outlets for them.
It is essential to train people who will be
able to train others in their turn, to train
teachers of engineering rather than engineers
and trainers of doctors rather than doctors.
Here, priority must be given to doctoral and
post-doctoral studies. But if all this is to lead
to anything, the countries of the South must
not be content with institutional structures
that simply take back professionals sent
abroad, they must introduce flexible adminis¬
trative procedures to encourage them to
return. If they do not do this, the brain drain
is bound to continue.
The failure of students and trainees to
return home from abroad is a complex sub¬
ject. In many cases, it is independent of the
wishes of those who do not return and of
those in charge of the institutions concerned
in their home countries. It is often the result
of bureaucratic inertia and the incapacity of
the country's economy to respond to the
aspirations of those who have acquired high
qualifications in the developed countries by
offering them suitable opportunities.

REFUGEES: THE RISING TIDE
BY RONY BRAUMAN
There have never been so many long-term
refugees as there are today
Mbove, Somali refugees
arrive in Mombasa (Kenya),
1992.
There are over sixteen million
refugees in the world today. The
reality behind this stark figure is
the multitude of human tragedies
being played out in encampments,
sometimes surrounded with barbed wire,
where freedom is the price paid for survival
and security is maintained not by the rule of
law but by enclosure. To be a refugee is to ex¬
change one injustice for another, one form of
suffering for another.
But unless we arc prepared to accept the
refugee's condition as a permanent one, as is
sometimes unfortunately the case, it is
important to understand the origins of these
mass movements and the course they take.
Since 1990, for example, some 10 million
exiles have managed to return home and
pick up the threads of a way of life they had
been forced to abandon. Another important
fact is that half the total number of refugees,
some 8.5 million people, originate from only
four countries: Palestine, Afghanistan,
Rwanda, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This does not mean that the refugee
problem is confined to the Third World and
that the refugee's plight has never been
known in the countries which are today
industrialized. The Huguenots, the French
Protestants who fled from France after the

which gave them a measure of religious lib¬
erty, in 1685 were the first group of refugees
to be defined as such. To avoid dragonnades,
the quartering of Louis XIV's soldiers in
their households, forcible conversion, and
exclusion from professional activities,
300,000 Protestants fled the kingdom and
sought refuge in neighbouring Protestant
countries. They were the first exiles for
whom specific responsibility was acknowl¬
edged, in this instance a duty of religious
solidarity.
Horror and
humanitarianism
But the age of refugees that has outstripped
all others has been the twentieth century,
which seems to have been divided between
humane sensitivity and political terror.
Constant growth of concern for human
rights both in the minds of men and
women and in international conventions and
regulations has been accompanied by the
appearance of new forms of oppression,
social control and destruction. Modern
tyrants are probably no worse than those of
the past, but the technical means at their dis¬
posal have enabled them to envisage pro¬
grammes of social surgery that their prede¬
cessors could never have imagined. Horror

twentieth century, but it has been accompa¬

react by taking humanitarian action. A year
after it was founded in 1920, the League of
Nations established the High Commission
for Refugees under the leadership of
Norway's Fridtjof Nansen, whose first task
was to organize the repatriation of 1 .5 million
refugees and prisoners of war scattered all
over Europe by the turmoil of the First
World War.

in the eye of the storm. At the end of the
conflict there were a recorded 21 million
refugees scattered across Europe. In 1951,
the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
began its activities (see box). According to
the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the
Status of Refugees, which was drawn up in
parallel with the creation of UNHCR,
refugee status is accorded to any person
who, "owing to well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality or political opinion, is outside the
country of his nationality and is unable, or
owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail him¬
self of the protection of that country. . . .".
One necessary (but not sufficient) condition
of refugee status is the crossing of an interna¬
tional border. This differentiates refugees
from people forced out of their usual place
of residence, who are considered as "dis¬
placed persons" and are without legal status.
Changing status
This definition was hammered out by
Europeans in the political context of the
1950s. Since then its practical application has
broadened over the years in response to
changing conditions. It was a straightforward
matter when a Soviet or Hungarian dissident
sought protection in a democratic country in
the 1960s or 1970s. It was just as straightfor¬
ward when it was a question of saving

### 104402: Refugees: the rising tide
THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES
(UNHCR)
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was
established in 1951 with responsibilities for "providing international protection . . .
and . . . seeking permanent solutions for the problems of refugees". Its work is
humanitarian and entirely non-political. Initially, its mandate was limited to people out¬
side their country of origin, but over the years it has increasingly been called on to pro¬
tect or assist returnees in their home countries and particular groups of displaced
people who have not crossed an international border but are in a refugee-like situation
inside their country of origin.
The 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, which is the key to
UNHCR's protection activities, is a legally binding treaty. It contains a general definition of
the term "refugee" that no longer ties it to specific national groups, clearly establishes the
principle of non-refoulement, whereby no person may be returned against his or her will to
a territory where he or she may be exposed to persecution, and sets standards for the
treatment of refugees, including their legal status, employment and welfare. '
UNHCR endeavours:
to encourage governments to ratify international and regional conventions concern¬
ing refugees, returnees and displaced people;
to ensure that refugees are treated in accordance with recognized international
standards and receive an appropriate legal status and the same economic and social
rights as nationals of the country in which they have been given asylum;
* to promote the granting of asylum to refugees, i.e. to ensure that they are admitted
to safety and protected against forcible return to a country where they have reason to
fear persecution or other serious harm;
to ensure that applications for asylum are examined fairly and that asylum-seekers
are protected, while their requests are being examined, against forcible return to a
country where their freedom or lives would be endangered;
* to help refugees to cease being refugees either through voluntary repatriation to
their countries of origin, or through the eventual acquisition of the nationality of their
country of residence;
to help reintegrate refugees returning to their home country and to monitor
amnesties, guarantees or assurances on the basis of which they have returned home;
« to promote the physical security of refugees, asylum-seekers and returnees.
UNHCR's material assistance activities include emergency relief, assisting efforts
to promote voluntary repatriation or resettlement within new national communities,
social welfare, education and legal aid.

refugees. The problem was once solved by
the integration of refugees in their host
countries; today's solution is to provide aid
in camps established along the borders of
warring nations for people who hope even¬
tually to return home. The last few years
have shown that return can be possible and
that exile is not inevitable.
Ethnic cleansing
A Third World phenomenon in the 1980s,
refugee camps have since then reappeared in
Europe for the first time for forty years. In
conflicts of ethnic and political "cleansing"
refugees arc no longer a consequence of vio¬
lence but its very purpose. Here, displace¬
ment is no longer a grim by-product of
human passions but a strategic goal of total
wars waged by armies, not against other
armies, but against civilians.
Whatever the cause of the exodus may
be, the international community's duty its
fundamental commitment must be to pro¬
tect these peoples, first of all by applying the
principle of non-refoulement (see box page
27). People do not choose to uproot them¬
selves from their land voluntarily, for rea¬
sons of opportunism. They flee to escape
oppression, and the international commu¬
nity has a collective duty to shelter and help
those deprived by force of circumstances of
the means to ensure their own survival. The
defence of freedom and pluralism can only
be based on recognition and defence of the
right of asylum. In these uncertain times, the
struggle is certainly a hard one, but it is more
important than ever to wage it.

More and more states are
curbing the admission of

The following article has
been freely adaptedfrom
a longer study prepared
by Pedro Vianna.
The protection of persons exposed
to persecution has always been a
matter of concern to human soci¬
eties. The history of early Mediter¬
ranean civilizations offers several
examples of writings on this subject.
At the end of the second millennium of
the pre-Christian era, an Egypto-Hittite
treaty set forth the conditions of safety and
impunity that were to be enjoyed by per¬
sons accused of political offences who were
extradited to Egypt. The Old Testament is
full of references to forced exile and the pro
tection of those fleeing persecution. Ancient
Greek literature includes many texts on pro¬
tection as a sacred duty and on places of asy¬
lum (from asulos = inviolable). But the first
literary work to deal directly with the issue is
Aeschylus's tragedy The Suppliants, in
which Aeschylus establishes a link between
the sàcred, politics and social issues.
According to legend, an important event in
the early history of Rome, where there seems
to have been less emphasis on the sacred
aspect of asylum, was the creation of a refuge
at a place dedicated to the god Asylaeus. In his

### 104403: Restricted entry
History of Rome Livy shows how the
founders of cities used the principle of asylum
as an instrument of demographic policy.
In medieval Europe, asylum was essen¬
tially religious. Christian emperors like
Theodosius, Valentinian and Justinian, as
well as various religious councils, strove to
codify the right of asylum, giving it varying
degrees of generosity depending on the
period and the type of offence committed.
During this time, places of asylum included
the university, churches, bishop's resi¬
dences, convents, monasteries and, more
generally, any site of a religious nature,
including wayside crosses.
A sovereign act
The way states were structured in the mod¬
ern era resulted in a secularization of the
right of asylum, which became the sover¬
eign's prerogative and therefore a mainly
political act, even if its sacred and moral
foundations persisted, and tied the hands of
the state authorities.
From the end of the Middle Ages on, the
practice of asylum was common in Italy.
Citizens of one republic who had incurred
their ruler's wrath would take refuge in the
territory of another. Over a period of several
centuries after the expulsion of the Jews
from Spain in 1492 (they found asylum in the
rv
-**
land of Islam), several attempts were made
by the emerging nation-states to codify the
right of asylum, notably in the Villers-
Cotterêts edict of 1539, several other British,
French and German legal and philosophical
texts, and the French Constitution of 1793.
However, these attempts were never of a
universal nature, since the texts concerned
did no more than deal with specific cases,
e.g. the Potsdam Edict of October 1685 on
the admission of French Huguenots, or else
state general principles, as did Article 120 of
the 1793 French Constitution (which was
never promulgated).

reside in that territory. This is territorial asy¬
lum. The notion of diplomatic asylum,
which fell into abeyance in Europe in the late
nineteenth century, became enshrined in
law in Latin America in 1889 with the signing
of the Treaty of Montevideo. It is a practice
which has since then been reaffirmed in
numerous conventions and is still followed
today.
Refugee status
In 1921, the explorer Fridtjof Nansen was
appointed High Commissioner for
Refugees. There followed a series of interna¬
tional agreements applicable to specific cate¬
gories of refugees. But it was not until 1938
that the Intergovernmental Committee for
Refugees, set up that year, first outlined a
more general definition of the refugee
"I know for myself that exiles
live on hope," (Aeschylus,
Agamemnon, 458 B.C.).

extending to "all persons . . . who, as a result
of events in Europe, have had to leave or
may have to leave their countries of resi¬
dence because of the danger to their lives or
liberties on account of their race, religion or
political beliefs".
After the Second World War, European
states had to contend with the problem of
several million refugees and displaced per¬
sons. But the complexity of the way in which
the various categories of refugee were listed
in the constitution of the International
Refugee Organization (IRO) set up in 1946
reflected differences of appreciation between
the eastern bloc states and those of the West.
It was not until the 1951 United Nations
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
(the Geneva Convention) that the issue was
clarified.
The crucial importance of this Convention
lies in the fact that it sets forth a universal defi¬
nition of refugees that has nothing to do with
the origin of the person concerned and can be
applied irrespective of time and place. This
definition (see article page 27) is now binding
on States Parties to the Convention and its
1967 Protocol.
From theory to practice
The 1951 Geneva Convention also defines
the circumstances under which refugee sta¬
tus no longer applies, contains clauses which
exclude a refugee from its field of application,
and determines the guarantees and protection
that states must grant refugees they admit.
However, the Convention does not oblige
states to grant refugees the right of residence,
i.e. territorial asylum, and leaves each country
free to organize its own procedures for rec¬
ognizing refugee status. Since Article 14 of the
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which states that "Everyone has the right to
seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum
from persecution", is not binding in law, it
may be safely asserted, whatever the Geneva
Convention may say, that from a legal stand¬
point the right of asylum in fact remains the
right of a state to grant asylum.
In practice, states tend systematically to
grant asylum to those they recognize as enjoy¬
ing refugee status. Moreover, both the

Huguenots, found refuge in
Prussia from persecution in
their own country. Above, The

Schengen Agreement,! in its section relating to
asylum, and the Dublin Convention,2 define
the asylum seeker as a person who tries to
enter the territory of a state with a view to
seeking recognition of his or her refugee status.
We may "sum up the essential differences
between the status of a person who has
obtained asylum and refugee status [as
defined by the Geneva Convention] by say¬
ing that the former... provides no guarantee
as to procedure or continuity of residence,
since it is subject [only] to the wishes of the
host state, whereas the latter... provides a
persecuted person with guarantees of protec¬
tion, procedure and continuity of residence,
as well as the minimum rights laid down in the
Geneva Convention3".
How is it, then, that despite the existence
of a universally applicable convention and a
gradual convergence of opinion as to what
constitutes asylum or refugee status, the main
non-governmental organizations dealing with
refugees increasingly accuse the developed
nations of reducing to a trickle the number of
cases where asylum is granted?
Increasing restrictions
In practice, recent developments have
resulted in the subordination of recognition
of refugee status to the granting of asylum,
rather than the other way round. What has
happened is that the developed states have
taken draconian steps to ensure that as few
asylum seekers as possible actually enter
their territory. This makes it extremely diffi
cult for such people to gain access to the
procedures which determine whether or
not they qualify for refugee status.
So as to be in a position to withhold refugee
status from the very large numbers of asylum
seekers from such countries as Algeria, Bosnia,
Somalia, Chechenya, Romania and Turkey,
European states have tended to read into the
text of the Convention what it does not con¬
tain. They claim, for example, that persecution
which is not carried out by state bodies does
not come within the Geneva Convention's
field of application. This means that victims of
persecution occurring in the course of a civil
war or widespread disturbances would not
benefit from the Convention. But in fact the
text of the Geneva Convention sets no condi¬
tions as to the perpetrator of persecution, and
in its Handbook on Procedures and Criteria
for Determining Refugee Status the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner stip¬
ulates that persecution "may also emanate
from sections of the population that do not
respect the standards established by the laws
of the country concerned," and cites religious
intolerance as a case in point.
By way of contrast, the 1969 Convention
of the Organization of African Unity cover¬

### 104404: The World's major refugee situations
FACT FILE
The world's major refugee situations
UNHCR is providing protection and assistance to 26.1 million
people around the world, of whom 13.2 million are refugees.
War in former Yugoslavia
Some 3.7 million people who have been dis¬
placed or affected by the war are receiving
humanitarian assistance from the United
Nations, 2.4 million of them in Bosnia and
Herzegovina alone.
Asylum in Europe
Since the early 1980s, around five million
applications for refugee status have been
submitted in Western Europe. UNHCR
tries to ensure that any measures taken to
control this phenomenon are consistent
with the principles of refugee protection.
The Palestinian question
Around 3.2 million people arc registered
with UNRWA, the agency responsible for
Palestinian refugees. Their future remains
one of the most complex issues which must
be addressed in the Middle East peace
process.
West African refugees
The conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone
have forced almost a million people into
exile in Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. Large
numbers are also displaced within their
own countries beyond the reach of interna¬
tional assistance.
Guatemalan repatriation
Some 20,000 Guatemalans have returned to
their homeland over the past 10 years. 9,500
of the 45,000 who remained in Mexico were
repatriated in 1995 with assistance from
UNHCR.
Haitian asylum seekers
UNHCR is assisting with procedures
designed to determine the status of asylum
seekers from Haiti and to monitor the situa¬
tion of those who return.
Reintegration in Mozambique
More than 1.6 million refugees returned to
Mozambique from six neighbouring states
between late 1992 and early 1995. They must
now begin to support themselves and to
reintegrate within their own communities.
Conflicts in the Caucasus
Recent years have witnessed a succession
of population displacements within and
between Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and
the Russian Federation, involving around
2.5 million people. Many of this number are
unable or unwilling to return to their for¬
mer place of residence.
Reconstruction in Afghanistan
Half of the Afghan refugees have repatriated
since 1992, leaving nearly three million in the
Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan.
Additional reconstruction efforts arc needed
within Afghanistan to enable their return.
Displaced Sri Lankans
More than 54,000 Sri Lankan refugees have
returned from India since 1992, leaving
nearly 90,000 in their country of asylum.
UNHCR provides assistance to the
returnees and to other people who arc
threatened or displaced by the war.
Repatriation to Myanmar
By mid-1995, only 50,000 of the 250,000
people who fled from Myanmar in 1991 and
1992 remained in Bangladesh. The home¬
ward movement, organized by UNHCR
will continue until the end of the year.
Vietnamese boat people
Although the departure of boat people has
effectively come to a halt, just over 40,000
Vietnamese asylum seekers remain in
camps throughout Southeast Asia. Nearly
80,000 have gone back to their own coun¬
try, where their situation is monitored by
UNHCR.
The Horn of Africa: exile and repatriation
UNHCR continues to assist around 1.3
million people from the Horn of Africa and
the Sudan, traditionally one of the most
important refugee-producing regions. The
repatriation to Eritrea from Sudan is under
way, more than 30 years after the first
refugees left that country.
The Rwanda/Burundi emergency
More than a million Rwandese poured into
Zaire between April and July 1994, one of
the largest and fastest refugee movements
ever seen. UNHCR is now providing pro¬
tection and assistance to some 2.2 million
displaced people in Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.

Refugees resettled by UNHCR in third countries, 1979-1995
The procedure of third country resettlement involves transferring refugees from their country of asylum toan-
other state which has agreed to admit thctn and to grant them long-term residence rights and the opportunity to
become naturalized citizens. Over the past decade, the international community has reached a broad consensus
that third country resettlement is the least preferred solution to a refugee problem, "the solution of last resort".

### 104405: The Struggle for peace
commentary Federico Mayor
I he struggle for peace
UNESCO has been in existence for fifty years, and for fifty
years it has been erecting its vast programme for the promo¬
tion of peace through education, science and culture. But
the work of constructing peace is unending; it has to go on in
all places and at all times.
The world has changed considerably in this last half cen¬
tury, and especially in recent years, with the fall of the
Berlin Wall, the end of the East-West standoff, the rise of
conflicts of a new type within nations, the increasingly strong
urge towards the assertion of selfhood, the growing scale of
population movements, the swing towards democracy, the
communications explosion, and so forth. The world we live in
is changing and reshaping itself along lines which are as yet
hard to decipher.
In this world that is struggling to be horn, two certainties
stand out. The first is that the vicious circle of poverty, igno¬
rance, exclusion and violence has become an established fact
and is spreading wider and wider. It is poverty that drives
people from the South to seek a better life in the North and
that drives rural populations to the towns; it is against a
background of ignorance that fear, extremism and intoler¬
ance thrive; and it is exclusion that brings in its train despair
and violence. Secondly, the disparity in the distribution of
the planet's wealth has become intolerably great, with
nations living at widely differing levels of development and
the gulf between rich and poor within nations growing
deeper. These glaring inequalities are a threat to peace
throughout the world.
It is for this reason that UNESCO set up a specific pro¬
gramme on the culture of peace in 1994.
The concept "culture of peace" is not easy to define. The
definition is being worked out one step at a time, forged in the
heat of the work being done and the thought being given to
the question by all who are serving the cause in the field. The
first characteristic to have been identified concerns the rela¬
tionship between peace, development and democracy, a rela¬
tionship that is growing steadily closer and whose synergic
effect is growing steadily stronger. Peace, development and
democracy constitute a three-cornered system of interactions
that has constantly to be created and recreated. The end of

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
an armed conflict, the moment when the warring parties
express a willingness to come to an agreement, is often the
right time for consolidating peace and trying to get it to take
root in people's minds, in institutions and in patterns of behav¬
iour. This explains why UNESCO has a special role to play in
regions where this kind of post-conilict situation obtains.
In the general context of new approaches to security,
UNESCO is for the first time entering into a dialogue with the
military authorities of various countries. I believe that the
armed forces, which occupy a central place within the
nation, rank among UNESCO's natural partners, and as such
have a decisive contribution to make to the task of building
a culture of peace. UNESCO is accordingly involving defence
colleges, centres of strategic studies and military academies
in its activities. This dialogue is proving fruitful for all par¬
ties concerned. It is, furthermore, essential at a time when,
against a background of increasing democratization, all the
constituent parts of society are required to play their part
both in the construction of peace and in devising and imple¬
menting development strategies that demand not only reduc¬
tions in military budgets but a redefinition of the role of the
armed forces.
UNESCO seeks to create a closer relationship with civil soci¬
ety and to organize all its component parts into working for
peace and is particularly concerned to establish a more fruitful
dialogue with parliamentarians. I firmly believe that UNESCO's
exchanges with these key figures of democracy, both at the
international level, through the Interparliamentary Union, and
at the national level, give its work a solid basis and a pragmatic
dimension with which it can no longer afford to dispense.
The national-level programmes for a culture of peace
pursue the following objectives: non-violent conflict manage¬
ment, the establishment of democratic procedures and
respect for basic individual rights; and participation by all in
the process of peace and development. The following are a
few examples.
Unesco peace-building activities
Burundi. One of UNESCO's first responses to the crisis follow¬
ing the events of October 1993 was to organize a symposium in
Burundi on the culture of peace and to set up a UNESCO
Centre for the Culture of Peace, which in 1995, in co-opera¬
tion with national institutions, non-governmental organizations
and other agencies of the United Nations system, ran a series
of seminars on training and education for peace, human rights
and democracy for the benefit of journalists, primary and sec¬
ondary school teachers, activity organizers, educators, provin¬
cial governors, local government officers, leaders of women's
associations and deputies of the national parliament.
Mozambique. UNESCO organized training and awareness-rais¬
ing activities for parliamentarians in 1995, e.g., enabling
twelve members of parliament to go on a study tour in South
Africa and Malawi and exchange views with parliamentarians
in those countries. These measures have helped to create a
climate of confidence.
Rwanda. A nation-wide forum on the culture of peace held
in Kigali in January 1996 with the participation of people
representing the country's various social strata and political
movements, gave an opportunity for discussing key questions
relating to the re-establishment of peace following the geno¬
cide. The forum's recommendations formed the basis of pro¬
jects that have been incorporated into UNKSCO's current
action plan for Rwanda.
Somalia. UNESCO convened a symposium of Somali intellec¬
tuals in Sana'a (Yemen) in April 1995 to map out ways of
promoting the culture of peace in Somalia. A follow-up
meeting was held in Paris in October 1995 to set up a group
with responsibility for drawing up projects to be carried out
with the support of UNESCO, the European Union and the
United Nations Development Programme.
El Salvador. In October 1995, the Salvadorian Legislative
Assembly held a seminar to consider the contribution it
could make to the consolidation of peace and the further¬
ance of national development. Eighty regular members of
the Assembly and more than twenty substitute members
worked together on a document addressed, among others, to
the Head of State, the President of the Supreme Court, gov¬
ernment institutions, the diplomatic corps and the press.
The seminar adopted a proposal for co-operation with
UNESCO to encourage dialogue between different currents of
opinion and make it easier for democratic rules and systems
to function.
Congo. A national forum was held in December 1994, bring¬
ing together all the country's political forces with represen¬
tatives of civil society. This was a fundamental step forward
in the peace process. It enabled an ongoing dialogue between
all the conflicting parties to be set up and resulted in the
adoption of a peace charter.
All UNESCO's activities, all the projects it carries out,
directly or indirectly, the studies it commissions, the meet¬
ings it convenes and the exchanges it organizes in the fields
of education, science, the social sciences, culture or commu¬
nication, serve a single purpose: peace. Whether it is work¬
ing through its Associated Schools to familiarize children
with ethnic, social and cultural diversity, enabling scientists
from different parts of the world to exchange their findings,
facilitating knowledge transfers by establishing professor¬
ships or granting fellowships, or whether it is identifying
ways of managing social change by bringing representatives
of different viewpoints face to face, encouraging the estab¬
lishment of independent media or bringing young artists
from many different backgrounds together, UNESCO has one
overrriding concern, in full accordance with its ethical mis¬
sion, and that is to allow the inhabitants of Planet Earth to
get to know one another better, so that they may have a
truer appreciation one of another and may therefore live
together in greater harmony. I

The old city of Fez
(Morocco) is one of
the most beautiful
quarters of its kind
in the world. It was
placed on Unesco's
World Heritage List
in 1980, and a few
years later Morocco
and Unesco
embarked on a far-
reaching safeguard
operation which is
now starting to
bear fruit.
Viewed from the high part of
the city, the medina of Fez
unfolds as a dense, undulating
expanse of little white houses
from which a number of more
imposing buildings emerge. To
visit the medina is to venture into
a labyrinth of alleys hustling
with activity, a realm of pedestri¬
ans, donkeys, commerce and
craftsmanship, whose ground-
plan has not changed for cen¬
turies. The stroller on the look¬
out for historical remains will
find many examples of fine archi¬

up at the crossroads of communi¬
cation joining the Mediterranean
to black Africa and the eastern
Maghreb to the Atlantic. In the
ninth century the Andalusians
expelled from Cordoba by the
Ummayads settled on the right
bank of wadi Fez, and migrants
from Kairouan in Tunisia made
their homes on the left bank.
Fez-el-Bali came into being as a
result of the union of the two
communities in 1069.
Qarawiyin university, the
world's oldest, was founded in
Fez in 859 by a woman, Fatima el
Fihri al Kairouani. Celebrated
madrasahs (Qur'anic schools)
developed around it at the time
of the Marinids, the Berber
dynasty which established its
ride over Morocco during the thir
teenth-fifteenth centuries. The
city's intellectual, artistic and
religious influence soon reached
beyond North Africa. Students
came from all over the country,
but also from the Orient, Africa
and Spain to work under illustri¬
ous teachers. Among those who
studied in Fez were the historian
Ihn Khaldun, the mathematician
Ihn Al-Yasamin, the physician
Ihn Bushd (Averroës), and many
linguists.
An ambitious scheme
A centre of Islam, the city was
flourishing economically by the
end of the thirteenth century.
The Marinids made it their capi¬
tal and ordered Fez-el-Jed id, the
white city, to be built to the west
of Fez-el-Bali, the historic city.

In the following centuries, the
new city continued to expand and
welcomed an influx of new inhabi¬
tants, mainly of rural origin.
Under the French protec¬
torate (1912-1956), the medina
was neglected and priority was
given to developing a modern city.
In 1980 it was the home of over
60 per cent of the city's popula¬
tion and their economic activities.
But road access was inadequate,
and the district was slowly going
downhill. With its 143 mosques,
seven madrasahs and 61 monu¬
mental fountains, Fez was a
threatened masterpiece.
Then UlNICSCO placed Fez on
the World Heritage List. After
five years' study, Morocco and

city, including its monuments,
dwellings, urban amenities
(roads, drainage, lighting, etc.)
and economic life. The project
really took off in 1989. After a
general feasibility study, the
Moroccan state set up Ader-Fès,
a body responsible for carrying
out and co-ordinating the rescue
programmes. Around fifty monu¬
ments the oldest and most sig¬
nificant from a historical or
architectural viewpoint are
involved. The estimated total
cost of rehabilitation is around
|600 million and the first
restoration work is being done
step by step, as donor commit¬
ments are received.
Ader-Fès is using the best
local craftsmen, the mââlem,
keepers of the city's traditional
skills, to reconstitute the original
architecture of the buildings
using time-honoured techniques.
It is also setting up a training
institute in traditional building
crafts and a rehabilitation and
restoration laboratory. On the
ground the work is proceeding
slowly, however. The streets of
the medina are so narrow that all
the materials have to be brought
in by donkeys. The general need
for protracted and meticulous
work is well illustrated by the
case of Mesbahiya madrasah, of
which only a few terraces and
ceilings and a handful of decora¬
tive elements have survived. The
foundations of the madrasah
have now been stabilized and the
next step is to reconstitute the
architectural details in all their
refinement.
A pragmatic approach
The cultural context also plays
an important role in the success
of this gigantic enterprise.
"People here do not venerate art
for art's sake", says Abdellatif el
Ilajjami, director-general of
Ader-Fès. "They attach more
importance to a hammam than to
a monument. If restoration is to
be accepted, a new social func¬
tion must be found for the monu¬
ments." This approach lies
behind the renovation of the
Najjarin funduk (which housed a
livestock market in the eigh¬
teenth century) and the nearby
carpenters' souk which has been
transformed into a woodwork
museum and will house a library
for specialists and a restoration
laboratory.
Restoration of the Observatory
Tower of the great Qarawiyin
mosque, built in 1348 and
destroyed by fire a few decades
ago, is being carried out in the
same spirit. When the work is fin¬
ished it will house an astrolabe
museum. Bou Inaniya madrasah,
which was built in 1356 by the
Marinid Sultan Abou Inan, is also
being renovated. A building of
outstanding decorative refine¬
ment, Bou Inaniya is a place of liv¬
ing memory (it is still a Friday
mosque). It contains the world's
oldest hydraulic clock.
One of the most recent safe¬
guard operations has focused on
Dar Adyel palace, built in seven¬
teenth-eighteenth century style.
This sumptuous dwelling is far
more spacious than other con¬
temporary buildings of its kind
and has original architectural
features. It belonged to the
Governor of Fez in the seven¬
teenth century and later became
the property of leading citizens
of Fez. When its structure has
been consolidated, its decorative
elements of carved or incised
plasterwork, its woodwork and

lij will have to be reconstituted.
When restoration is complete,
Dar Adyel palace will, as in the
past, be the home of a conserva¬
tory of Andalusian music.
In all, a dozen historical mon¬
uments are currently being reha¬
bilitated, but equally critical
work is also being done on hous¬
ing, mains, and roads. The suc¬
cess of repairs to the drainage
system will largely hinge on the
transfer of the most polluting
activities tanneries, oilworks,
copperware factories to Ain
Nokbi, a new craftsmen's district
outside the medina which is
equipped to handle their wastes.
Before rehabilitation work
began, the medina had an over¬
population problem caused by
demographic growth and an influx
of population from the country¬
side. Deserted by the better-off,
the old city was caught in a down¬
ward spiral of poverty. There
were growing deficiencies in the
public services. This situation has
now been halted.
Emergency measures have
been taken on over 200 buildings
that were on the verge of col¬
lapse. Ader-Fès also intends to
renovate a number of dwellings
of historic value (there are over
10,000 of these in the medina
out of a total 13,385 buildings)
With help from' the municipality
and the people concerned. It has
carried out a massive computer¬
ized survey in which the address,
architectural type, cultural
value, number of households and
physical condition of each build¬
ing is recorded.
The thorny problem of roads
and streets remains to be solved.
There was some support for a
plan for a road through the med¬
ina, but the proposal had a hos¬
tile reception internationally.
Today the idea is to make two or
three inroads, each a few hun¬
dred metres long, so that the old
city will become more accessible
to emergency services and its
business premises will be less iso¬
lated. Although rehabilitation
operations are still far from com¬
plete, the medina has already
recovered some of its unique
radiance and charm. M

Ursula Island,
one of the 1,768
islands in Palawan
Province, is a bird
sanctuary and a
wildlife reserve.
Author France
Bequette and
environmentalist
friends collected
120 kilos of
wastes from its
beaches in a single
day.
In Puerto Princesa, capital of the
Philippine province of Palawan,
the new town hall offers a
panoramic view over Honda Bay,
the turquoise blue sea and a string
of islands bordered by white sandy
shores. The presence of a rusting
and heavily loaded logging truck
right in front of the building strikes
a jarring note. It has been parked
there deliberately. The massive
logs, cut illegally, were seized with
the truck and put on show to
remind the inhabitants of Palawan
island that logging in virgin forest is
now strictly forbidden.
Palawan, the largest of 1,768
islands that make up the province of
the same name, is dubbed the "last
!
frontier" because of its location on
the southwestern edge of the
Philippine archipelago, not far from
Borneo. Covering approximately
14,000 km2 and stretching eight to
40 kilometres across, the island con¬
sists of a 425-kilometre-long moun¬
tain range (highest peak 2,085
metres above sea level) and plains
covering about 118,350 hectares.
From the air, the island looks
very green, seemingly covered by
lush vegetation. But appearances
can be deceptive. The fate of
Palawan's forest is a snapshot of
what has been happening in the
Philippines since logging in virgin
forest was banned in 1991.
According to the current Under
Secretary of State for the
Environment, Palawan lost 19,000
hectares of forest every year
between 1977 and 1988. At this
rate, the island might have been
stripped of more than 50 per cent
of its 780,000-hectare forest cover
within 20 years.
The fight to save the forest
Despite the important economic
interests bound up with the logging
trade, ecologists launched a cam¬
paign in 1988 and soon mobilized
public opinion in favour of defend¬
ing the forest. A leading environ¬
mental group, the Ilaribon ["King
by France Bequette
of the Birds"] Foundation (named
for the Monkey-eating Eagle, an
endangered Philippine species),
drafted a petition calling for a total
logging ban. It collected one million
signatures and was presented to
former President Corazón Aquino.
Three years later, logging was
banned by law. A battle had been
won, but not the war. In the late
1980s, illegal timber exports were
estimated to total about $800 mil¬
lion annually, approximately four
times the officially recorded earn¬
ings from forest-product exports.
Illegal logging is still going on
today. Near the truck placed sym¬
bolically in front of Puerto
Princesa town hall, the police pile
up confiscated loads of timber.
The ecologically minded Palawan
Sun newspaper reported that in
the space of two months earlier
this year, authorities on the west
coast seized timber with a retail
value of 381,196 pesos ($15,250).
Deforestation can have far-
reaching and devastating conse¬
quences, as Palawan's governor
Salvador P. Socrates stressed when
he visited two towns ravaged by
flash floods in September 1995.
"Our problem is that there are no
more trees to stop the water from
coming down the mountain," he
said. Besides provoking floods,
deforestation removes the fine
layer of earth covering the moun¬
tainside. Swept away by water, the
silt cascades from denuded lands
into the island's fishing grounds
and settles on coral reefs, which in
turnare suffocated.

variety of algae, fish, molluscs and

the area are using dynamite and

but also damages coral reefs.
Cyanide paralyzes fish so that

aquariums or restaurants in the
Far East, where the consumption
of certain fish such as lapulapu is
believed to bring prosperity and
longevity.
In Hong Kong, random tests for
cyanide carried out on live fish sold
in restaurants have shown levels
below the permissible amount set
by the World Health Organization
for drinking water. But whether
eating fish caught using cyanide is
100% safe still remains to be
proved. In 1987 the Hong Kong
government banned cyanide fishing
in its territorial waters, but the
problem has not gone away.
In Palawan the law in this field
is also difficult to enforce, despite
heavy sentences for offenders. In
March 1996, six dynamite fisher¬
men, locally known as bum-
bongeros, were arrested in Cuyo
with 80 kilograms of fish and sen¬
tenced to 20 years in prison. The

were given ten-year sentences.
The Tubbataha Beefs national

and proclaimed a World Heritage
Site in 1993. Every year, visiting
divers from all over the world
observe the damage caused by
destructive fishing practices around
the two atolls lying at the heart of
the marine park, which is excep¬
tional on account of its abundant
and highly diverse corals (300 types)
and 400 species of fish. A research
and marine ranger station has been
set up to chase poachers and
illegal fishermen. A patrol team of
eleven is stationed in Tubbataha
for two months at a time. Their
living conditions are tough and
funding is tight, despite backing
from several organizations,
including the Department of Envi¬
ronment and Natural Resources,
the Palawan Council for Sustain¬
able Development (PCSD) and Con¬
servation International.
Protective measures
Created in 1992, the PCSD estab¬
lished an Environmentally Critical
Areas Network in order to regu¬
late and control the use and man¬
agement of the province's natural
resources. A mine exploited near
Honda Bay, for example, caused
mercury poisoning in fish and
shellfish. Several inhabitants of
the small port of Santa Lourdes
were also affected. The mine was
closed and a long-term plan was
adopted to provide health care for
the villagers and to find alternative
means of subsistence to fishing.
In an effort to encourage preser¬
vation, the network is also seeking
to make forest dwellers the owners
of their environment. The PCSD is
studying the possibilities of deliver¬
ing ancestral ownership certificates
to three indigenous peoples, the
Batah, the Tagbanuas and the
Palawan. All live in upland areas
and practise slash and burn agricul¬
ture. They also hunt, extract resin
from almaciga (which yields a type
of copal), exploit rattan and harvest
wild honey. In 1995, a scheme to
protect Palawan's tropical forest
was finally drawn up. Among the
sites included in the plan arc the St.
Paul Subterranean River National
Park (known for its magnificent
underground river) and its adjacent
Mangroves on
Snake Island, in
Honda Bay.

Papering the desert green
Carlos Yruretagoyena is a trained oceanographer, and on the face of it there
was nothing except his scientific background and his love of nature to suggest
that one day he would set up an environmentally-focused research department
in one of Mexico's largest domestic-use paper factories, the San Francisco
paper works in Mexieali. When he asked if he could do some work on the fac¬
tory's wastes, his boss raised no objection and Carlos went ahead.
Paper factories produce liquid (65%) and solid (35%) wastes. Once dry,
the wastes consist of 5% water, 63% cellulose libres and 32% mineral ash.
Their pll (a measure of the acid or alkaline content of soil) varies between 7
and 8.7, the toxic residues they contain do not exceed permitted norms, and
they contain no pathogenic agents liable to pollute the environment. Because
of these factors, Carlos thought they could be used for soil enrichment.
He ran a number of experiments to demonstrate that the wastes encourage
seed germination and the growth of seedlings, that they can improve the
mechanics of soils and lighten heavy earth, and that their moisture-retaining
capacity leads to considerable water savings.
The wastes are dried and then crushed into granules no larger than three
centimetres in diameter (too compact a texture would suffocate plants). Next,
the granules are mixed with various kinds of organic and geological matter (in
a proportion not exceeding 50% of the total weight) based on dried cattle
manure, (day. burnt wood debris and fodder plants. The blend is left to com¬
post for 30 days then spread in cardboard trays and seeded. The technique is
simple and has many advantages: the mix is lightweight, easy to handle and
rich in raw materials.
Another experiment proved that subsoil composed of untreated residues
from paper-making retained water better than a control plot of ordinary earth,
its retentive capacity doubling between depths of 8 to 30 centimetres.
The crops that have already been planted are clearly in good health.
Flowers, vegetables and fruit trees are growing fast and well. If the value of
these experiments is recognized, Carlos has plans to reforest the desert at low
cost. He is convinced that his technique can be useful to everyone involved in
the fight against desert encroachment.

### 104408: Who are we?
UNESCO IN ACTION... UNESCO IN ACTION... UNESCO IN ACTION...
The second Unesco philosophy forum
by Géraldine Schimmel
Who are we?
Earlier this year, Unesco's Paris Headquarters was the
scene of a four-day intellectual marathon during
which philosophers, sociologists, biologists,
historians, jurists, writers, political scientists
and artists from all over the world met on the
occasion of Unesco's Second Philosophy
Forum and endeavoured to answer the
question "Who are we?". Here Géraldine
Schimmel presents a round-up ofsome of
the salient issues raised at the Forum
(27-30 March 1996), which was organized by
Ayyam Sureau of Unesco's Philosophy Division
and a panel ofsix thinkers.
To those who might think this theme some¬
what out-of-date I would point out immedi¬
ately that the question is not "Who am I?" or
"What are we?" but "Who are we? "It is a trick
question. Although ¡t does not directly raise
the issue of identity or human nature, it con¬
stantly implies it. It impinges on the notion of
collective identity and therefore of otherness:
who am I to the other, who is the other to me,
and, together, who are we? What is it that
links us all together to the point where it is
possible to talk of human community and,
linked in this way, what future are we heading
for?
This multifaceted question is not specific
to any particular discipline, but every disci¬
pline can contribute part of an answer. It is a
moral and social question, but has political
overtones. A human community wonders
what constitutes its identity. What is meant
by "we"?
A community of communities
In the view of Richard Rorty (United States),
a member of the Forum's Advisory Board, the
expression "we" is meaningless unless it is
part of a realistic and just project that offers
everyone a future. But this future, because it
is increasingly unlikely, weakens our collective
identity. It is pointless to believe in a moral
community if the world is divided by an
unbridgeable gap into two camps, the poor
and the rich. What meaning can the notion of
a moral community have when almost 1.5 bil¬
lion human beings live in a state of total desti¬
tution without their plight arousing any real
world solidarity? Is that solidarity even possi¬
ble? In Rorty's view, regarding others as mem
bers of the same moral community presup¬
poses not only that one is prepared to help
them, but that one has the means to do so.
Here, the word "we" is consigned to the
chilly universe of economic realities. Is this
pessimism totally justified?
Richard Posner (United States) sug¬
gested that a political community is defined
chiefly by feelings of altruism, which tempers
competitiveness between its members and
turns it into virtuous emulation. There can be
no human community without social justice
and equal rights. Human beings have shown
that they are capable of making the transition
from "I" to "we". Many societies are now
more egalitarian and more just than they used
to be. It is surely reasonable to believe that in
time the "we" will progress.
Irrespective of economic considerations,

UNESCO IN ACTION UNESCO IN ACTION UNESCO IN ACTION...
Daniel C. Dennett (United States) argued that
there is room for a rational exchange between
human beings that can pave the way to
progress towards a global moral community.
Angele Kremer-Marietti (France) accepted that
the idea of a global democracy, a "community
of communities", is Utopian, but believed that
it is a goal we should aim for. In a world where
interdependence is continually becoming
stronger, and where exchangestrade, commu¬
nications, migration flows and epidemicsare
taking on a global dimension, it would be unreal¬
istic to suppose that rich countries can isolate
themselves from poor countries. Although
twentieth-century examples of totalitarianism
may cast doubt on the feasibility of an egalitar¬
ian society, we can at least aim for fairness.
For, as Vitaly Chelichev (Russia) pointed
out, quoting the American philosopher John
Rawls, justice is not about egalitarianism, but
equity. The rich can get richer as long as that
leads to some extent to the poorest getting
richer. Equity would In that case seem to be
above all a rational quest for a less and less
unjust society. If this is accepted, the politi¬
cal "we" can exist in societies which are to
some degree inegalitarian. But there are cer¬
tain definable tolerance thresholds beyond
which economic inequality may jeopardize
political stability.
Perhaps the moral community we are try¬
ing to define is neither a community of trust,
as Rorty suggests, nor a defiant "we", to
paraphrase Annette Baier (New Zealand), but
simply a community of common interests.
The human species has discovered that it is

held together by a new bond, a bond emanat¬
ing from its own fragility. The earth's equilib¬
rium is under threat and the shadow of
Malthusianism still looms, as Nicole Morgan
(Canada) observed. The image of our small
planet being in danger has created a new form
of solidarity between its inhabitants: the sur¬
vival of us all is at stake. This responsibility
brings a fresh intensity to the notion "we".
Federating differences
To use the word "we" is first and foremost to
accept other people's right to exist. In the
words of Albert Jacquard (France), only the
collective gives humankind its dignity. "I" is
above all the link I build up with others. It Is
my membership of a community which has
the power to make the "I" emerge. This argu¬
ment was echoed by Yirmiahu Yovel (Israel), for
whom we are transient creatures who try to
transcend our existence by tearing ourselves
away from meaninglessness, finite beings
who desperately strive to overcome our fini-
tude. Identity provides us with a metaphysi¬
cal anchor. Yovel contrasted static identities
(national, racial, religious), which constrict and
imprison the individual, with dynamic identi¬
ties, which enable human beings to belong to
several groups at the same time. But in any
case, the "I" exists only thanks to the "we".
The role of the Other is thus crucial to the
definition of the Self, especially in cases
where the Other is someone who does not
belong to my group. This difference can gener¬
ate positive competitiveness and become a
source of energy and creativity; but it cannot
be fertile unless there are ethical standards
and political institutions that guarantee
mutual recognition and preclude all forms of
intolerance. The idea of federation, in the
sense of a veritable association of nations,
was regarded as a possible solution both by
Yovel and by Alain Finkielkraut (France), who
cited Kant's project for universal peace, which
holds that international relations will only
emerge from the state of nature through
development of the idea of federation.
To say "we" is to recognize the Other in
his or her dignity as a human being. This
recognition seems to be reflected par excel¬
lence in the universalist discourse of human

rights. It has been seen by some as an instru¬
ment of the West's desire for cultural domina¬
tion, particularly during the colonial period.
But it cannot be considered solely as an ideo¬
logical vehicle remote-controlled by the super¬
powers with the aim of erasing the specific
characteristics of different human communi¬
ties. Universalism can be adapted to diversity
of cultures and, as Pilar Echeverría de Ocariz
(Venezuela) argued, it is a guarantee of secu¬
rity for the peoples who support it.
One might ask why universalism should be
regarded as incompatible with cultural identi¬
ties. One reason is the fear that a form of glob¬
alization and a certain cultural hegemony may
iron out differences using the power of the
communications media. Zaki La'idi (France)
stressed that globalization is not an idea, but a
process with no symbolic force which may
prompt nations to protect their endangered
Identity. The universal, on the other hand, does
not neglect differences; it simply forbids a
withdrawal into one's own identity. It is possi¬
ble to be integrated into the world' community
without losing a cultural identity, particularly
since that identity, according to Egon Gal
(Slovakia), does not exist in itself, but is con¬
stantly being reshaped by our acts.
History and identity
Attention was now turned to another compo¬
nent of the meaning of the term "we": we are
solely because we were. To forget that we are
the product of a past and a common history
is tantamount to weakening the foundations
of our collective identity. Jacques Le Goff
(France) insisted on the fact that we consist
of many strata. We have constructed our
selves around events which have become
identity myths, and to forget them is to
deprive our identity of its foundationsthus
eroding the foundations of a common future.
But we must distinguish between what
forms a constituent part of our identity and
what does not. Abdulkarim Sorush (Iran), for
example, seemed to think that one of the main
shortcomings of European Enlightenment phi¬
losophy was that it tried to deny the religious
dimensiona dimension which formed an inte¬
gral part of the Western world's identity.
Because it has tried to eliminate all religious fea¬
tures from its collective organization and sub¬
jected it to purely secular constraints, the West
may have robbed itself of part of its identity
and, what is more, lost the ability to under¬
stand nations with a religious structure, espe¬
cially the Islamic world.
How can a collective identity withstand
the changes of history? If one is, for exam¬
ple, "a former dissident from a former
Eastern-bloc country", as Pedrag Matvejevich
(former Yugoslavia and Croatia) described him¬
self, how should one see the future and pre¬
pare oneself for it? Matvejevich noted that
ideologies based on identity are running out
of steam. Who ought we to be if we are no
longer what we were? Since the immediate
past does not help to construct an identity,
should we, as Matthias Middel (Germany) sug¬
gested, delve into the past and see if a demo¬
cratic ideal from the nineteenth century can
help us to tackle the problems of the future?
Hence the central question: when do we
become aware that the collective "we" exists?
Gianni Vattimo (Italy) answered by quoting
Walter Benjamin: "The essence of a thing
appears in all its truth when it is threatened
with extinction." In the same way, awareness
of identity seems to be shaped by danger and
conflict. Perhaps we resign ourselves to cul¬
tural minimalism through fear of this violent
conflict. This conflict, necessary though it is to
enable the identity to disintegrate and reconsti¬
tute itself, needs nevertheless to be chan¬
nelled and organized. Vattimo took as his exam¬
ple the European Community's process of
constructing an identity, which is taking place
within the framework of a non-violent conflict.
This process is akin to the universalist ideal
which aims not to make all nations identical,
but to allow them to display their differences
on the basis of a universal legal standard.
However, another difficulty has emerged
as the twentieth century comes to a close. As
Marcel Gauchet (France) explained, "being
together" becomes increasingly difficult as
the mystery of "being oneself" melts away. On
the one hand the individual, who has become
the subject of scientific knowledge, seems
easier to understand. The cognitive sciences
have taught us much about the workings of
the mind. On the other hand, there is a crisis
of sociological intelligibility, a crisis of soci¬
eties' capacity to act on themselves, espe¬
cially since the expectations of socialism came
to an end. It has become painfully obvious
that despite our mass of knowledge our soci¬
eties remain impenetrable to us.
So we shall go an asking the question
"Who are we?" for some time to come. One
only hopes that nations will be capable of over¬
coming their differences and of reaching a mini¬
mum degree of agreement about what they
share.

### 104409: Culture first
Reflections: Culture first
A follow-up article to last month's issue
("Culture and Development: A life worth living") reports on Unesco's
thinking about the cultural dimension ofdevelopment
by Claude Fabrizio, Unesco consultant
Development policies based entirely on eco¬
nomic considerations and intended to help the
countries of the South to "catch up" with the
industrialized nations encountered many set¬
backs in the 1960s and 1970s. One result of
this was the emergence in the 1980s of a new
concept, the cultural dimension of development.
This Idea, whose importance was recognized
by the World Conference on cultural policies held
in Mexico City in 1982, is based on the observa¬
tion that some features of pre-industrial soci¬
eties are inconsistent with the societal model of
industrialized countries and on the belief that
these features should be taken into account in
development planning.
Although the concept was widely acknowl¬
edged in 1982, it only really began to influence the
working methods of co-operation agencies in the
early 1990s, when these bodies began to take
account of certain cultural characteristics and to
associate local populations more closely with the
preparation and execution of field projects.
During this time, the United Nations system
was engaged In an appraisal of the qualitative
aspects of development which led to the emer¬
gence of the concepts of sustainable develop¬
ment, human development (for which the United
Nations Development Programme became the
permanent standard bearer) and, more recently,
social development.
Meanwhile Unesco, as part of its activities
within the framework of the World Decade for
Cultural Development which it had launched
jointly with the United Nations, began to study
in depth the methods whereby cultural consider¬
ations could be integrated into development.
Two major steps
Two important steps must be taken. Firstly, it
must be recognized that the interaction between
culture and development is the interface of two
cultural models, one corresponding to tradi¬
tional, pre-industrial cultures, and the other
(which is often presented as not belonging to
any kind of society in particular) corresponding
to the dominant industrial culture.
Secondly, it must be accepted that central¬
izing, technocratic methods of promoting devel¬
opment must be replaced by more flexible
approaches tailored to situations in which
countries, populations and communities pro¬
pose to act on their own account, according to
their own needs, possibly with the help of out¬
side institutions.
The importance of two Unesco flagship pro¬
jects may be seen in the light of these two
obstaclesthe work of the World Commission
on Culture and Development (as reported in the
September 1996 issue of the Unesco Courier)
and a methodological project on "The Cultural
Dimension of Development".
After carrying out a series of case studies,
in 1992 Unesco began drawing up an inventory
of ways and means of integrating cultural fac¬
tors into development, exploring the full implica¬
tions of the cultural factors and impacts of
development and outlining a new approach to
the problem based on analysing development
from the cultural point of view.1 Planning meth¬
ods are now being reassessed on the basis of
this new approach, and the resulting proposals
will be published at the end of the year as A
Cultural Approach to Development, Proposals for
a Planning Manual.
An entirely new perspective
The new approach involves a complete change of
perspective. The planning process now starts
on the ground and moves up to the financial and
other decision-making centres. Projects are justi¬
fied essentially in situations (previously called
"contexts") in which problems raised by local
people call for outside intervention. The partici¬
pation process is thus turned upside down.
Local populations have now become the chief
players, and the people from outside have to
establish new partnerships with them.
There is no longer any room for models of
change designed in a vacuum. The variety of cul¬
tures and situations must be matched by a cor¬
responding variety of approaches to develop¬
ment with a human face. Excessively rigorous
timetables clash with the variety of rhythms that
are found in different societies. They are only of
interest to intellectually rigid institutions which
allocate their resources according to results
which may not necessarily correspond to the
underlying effects of innovation on different
human groups.
If these institutions were to set up guide¬
lines associated with conditions that countries
requesting institutional support must meet,
planning could be much more easily adapted to
the unique cultural dynamics of each society.
Projects would then respond to needs
expressed at grass roots level, to the mobiliza¬
tion of local people, and to an Internal rationale
of continuity and change.
These proposals correspond to questions
which are Increasingly being asked, in various
forms, in all the institutions of the United
Nations. I

Instrumentalist, singer and painter, Juan Carlos
Cáceres is a one-man history of the Argentine tango,
vividly evoking its pathos and sensuality in paintings,
pastels and his latest recording, Sudacas. Here he
describes some unusual and little-known facets of this
enduringly popular musical form, the memorable
characters who have contributed to it, and the many
musical influences that have fashioned it since the
19th century.
Isabelle Leymarie: What is
the tango and where did you get
your passion for it?
Juan Carlos Cáceres: The tango is
one of Latin America's richest
kinds of music. Even the older
pieces are sometimes surpris¬
ingly modern and harmonically
adventurous, not to mention
work by more recent com¬
posers like Astor Piazzolla.
I come from Buenos Aires,
which is the home of the tango
and has an extraordinary jazz
school and excellent musi¬
cians. As a child I spent a lot
of time listening to the radio.
At that time there was a pro¬
gramme on the tango of the
1920s, but they also played
recordings from the last cen¬
tury what they call today
the tango of the Old Guard. I
can still remember the pro¬
gramme's opening announce-

ment, which said: "Tango of
the Old Guard, from the can¬
dombe to the habanera, from
the habanera to the fandango,
from the fandango to the
milonga, from the milonga to
the tango." They also broad¬
cast a famous tango called El
Porteñitol . Old-style tango was
played with anything the
musicians could lay their
hands on. It was a two-speed
tango, often played by neigh¬
bourhood brass bands, or
municipal or military brass
bands performing in band¬
stands in town squares. One of
the first important tango
recordings was made in 1907.
The music was recorded in
Paris by the brass band of the
Republican Guard! I also
liked listening to Aníbal
Troilo, who in the 1940s was a
famous player of the bando-
nion, a kind of portable har¬
monium or accordion that is
popular in Latin America.
The first tango age
stretched from the 1880s to
1920, a time when bandonions
were few and far between. The
bandonion first turned up in
the Rio dc la Plata region
around 1870 during the war
with Paraguay, when a mulatto
named Santa Cruz played
polkas and mazurkas on it.
During this first period all
tango musicians were black or
mulatto, and the tango was
street music, outsiders' music.
The whites listened to classical
music. Later the tango blended
with other types of dance for
couples, and its instrumenta¬
tion developed. Barrel organs,
which could easily he taken
outside, were ideal for produc¬
ing hitter-sweet sounds. Brass
bands, with their big horns and
flutes, played the tango in its
most polished form at that
time. Trios and quartets made
up of such instruments as
flutes, clarinets, violins and
harps and guitars played it in
brothels. Fancy brothels had
pianos, and pianists also played
ragtime.
I. L: It is often forgotten
that the tango resulted from a
meeting between many different
cultures.
J. C. C: That's right. As early as
1880 it is possible to see links
with Brazilian music in the
milonga, which was sung by
the gauchos of the Buenos
Aires suburbs and whose bass
line shows Cuban influences.
Some notes in the tango are
also close to those of jazz.
People always talk about an
input from the United States,
hut I think it's much more
important to emphasize the
close ties between the coun¬
tries of the southern half of
South America and the rest of
Latin America and the
Caribbean. Argentina has never
been the isolated nation it's
sometimes thought to have
been. The long couplets of the
milonga were sung by

payadores, itinerant singers
who accompanied themselves
on the guitar. The milonga
blended with the tango and
became the tango-milonga. In
the 1920s, which are consid¬
ered to be a golden age of the
tango, the violinist Julio De
Caro codified this music and
defined its colour. Sextets then
started to appear, generally
consisting of two bandonions,
two violins, a piano and a bass.
I. L: The important
contribution from the candombe
is also often forgotten when
talking about the roots of the
tango.
J.CC: There are traces of the
candombe in Sudacas, the
record I made recently. You
can still hear the influence of
this old religious music of the
blacks of Rio de la Plata in the
strong beat and syncopation of
the tango and the milonga.
Until the 1950s, the tango was
deeply rooted in popular cul¬
ture, and the bands that
played in the open air played it
with an incredible swing
without amplifiers. The best
musicians have always played
with a swing, but the tradition
of improvization has gone.
There was also a particularly
erotic version of the tango
called the tango con corte,
which came from one of the
figures of the candombe. It
was danced by the ordinary
people, but it was banned. For
a while even lunfardo, Buenos
Aires slang, was forbidden.
Then the Argentine middle
classes introduced the tango to
Europe before the First World
War, and it even became fash
ionable in Russia. The Pope
issued a bull forbidding the
tango for being too sensual, and
Argentine dancers were sent to
the Vatican to dance for him in
an attempt to persuade him to
go back on his decision. In the
1930s the tango lost its bite. A
vogue for sung tango came in,
with Carlos Gardel as its repre¬
sentative figure. Then came a
tango revival in the 1940s.
Influenced by North American
music, it went from a binary
measure to one in four-time.
The old repertoire was played
again, and Aníbal Troilo kept
the phrasing of the milonga.
I. L: How have you managed
to pursue a double career as a
painter and a musician?
J.CC: I started painting very
young (I studied at the
Buenos Aires Art School), also
playing the piano and the
trombone. I was especially
fond of the tango and jazz,
particularly cool jazz; I liked
its romantic side. By the way,
after the Second World War,
several French musicians set¬
tled in Argentina and spread
the influence of Django
Reinhardt. This gave rise to a
unique guitar school in
Argentina. In the 1920s sev¬
eral tango musicians also
spent some time in the United
States. When they returned,
they incorporated new jazz
chords into their works. After
the 1966 coup d'état, I went
to Spain, and then settled in
France where in 1977 I
formed a tango group called
Gotán (the word tango in
reverse). I was the pianist and
arranger. We had an alto vio¬
lin, a viola, a bandonion, a
bass and an electric guitar.
We played a lot of original
pieces. Then I went through a
patch where I couldn't find
any musicians I could get
along with, and so I spent
more time painting. I pro¬
duced a fresco of Latin
America history and I also
took some ideas from the
French Revolution. In 1989 I
went back to music, which
had come to be a kind of
therapy. I formed a new
group called Tangofón with
two saxes, a piano, a bass, a
bandonion and drums, and I
started singing professionally.
I. L: Your painting also
expresses the magic of the world
of the tango.
J.CC: The tango is still my
main source of inspiration.
I've painted Carlos Gardel,
the bandonionist Astor
Piazzolla when he was playing
with Aníbal Troilo, whose
arranger he was, couples
dancing, pimps, dives, broth¬
els and even a canvas showing
the tango dancers who went
to dance for the Pope. In the

### 104411: A Tiny bubble in the silence of the infinite
As it was... THE UNESCO pURIER AugUSt 1957
A tiny bubble in the silence
of the infinite
by Rabindranath Tagore
Indian writer and poet (1861-1941) Nobel Laureate for Literature (1913)
k n apology is due from me for my intrusion into the
world of pictures, thus offering a perfect instance of
the saying that fools rush in where angels fear to tread. I, as
an artist, cannot claim any merit for my courage; for it is the
unconscious courage of the unsophisticated, like that of one
who walks in dream on a perilous path, who is saved only
because he is blind to the risk.
The only training which I had from my young days was
training in rhythm, rhythm in thought, rhythm in sound. I
came to know that rhythm gives reality to that which is
desultory, which is insignificant in itself. And therefore,
when the scratches in my manuscript cried, like sinners, for
salvation, and assailed my eyes with the ugliness of their
irrelevance, I often took more time in rescuing them into a
merciful finality of rhythm than in carrying on what was my
obvious task.
In the process of this salvage work I came to discover one
fact, that in the universe of forms there is a perpetual activ¬
ity of natural selection in lines, and only the fittest survives
which has in itself the fitness of cadence, and I felt that to
fit the heterogeneous into the balance of fulfilment is cre¬
ation itself.
My pictures are my versification in lines. If by chance they
are entitled to claim recognition it must be primarily for some
rhythmic significance of form which is ultimate, and not for
any interpretation of an idea, or representation of a fact.
I hehe world of sound is a tiny bubble in the silence of the
I infinite. The Universe has its language of gesture, it talks
in the voice of pictures and dance. Every object in this world
proclaims in the dumb signal of lines and colours the fact that
it is not a mere logical abstraction or a mere thing for use, but
is unique in itself, it carries the miracle of its existence.
There are countless things which we know but do not rec¬
ognize in their own dignity of truth, independent of the fact
that they are injurious or beneficial. It is enough that a
flower exists as a flower, but my cigarette has no other claim
upon me for recognition than as being subservient to my
smoking habit.
But there are other things which in the dynamic quality of
THE UNESCO (¿URIER ** BO
rhythm or character make us insistently acknowledge the fact
that they are. In the book of creation they are the sentences
that are underlined with coloured pencil and we cannot pass
them by. They seem to cry to us "See, here I am," and our
mind bows its head and never questions, "Why are you?"
In a picture the artist creates the language of undoubted
reality, and we are satisfied that we see. It may not be the
representation of a beautiful woman but that of a humble
animal, or of something that has no external credential of
truth in nature but only its own inner artistic significance.
People often ask me about the meaning of my pictures.
I remain silent even as my pictures are. It is for them
to express and not to explain. They have nothing ulterior
behind their own appearance for thought to explore and
words to describe and if that appearance carried its ultimate
worth then they remain. Otherwise they are rejected and for¬
gotten even though they may have some scientific truth or
ethical justification.
It is related in the drama of Shakuntala, how one busy
morning there stood humbly before the maiden of the forest-
hermitage a youthful stranger who did not give his name.
Her soul acknowledged him at once without question. She
did not know him but only saw him and for her he was the
artist God's masterpiece to which must be offered the full
value of love.
Days passed by. There came to her gate another guest, a
venerable sage who was formidable. And, sure of his claim to
a dutiful welcome, proudly he announced, "I am here!" But
she did not hear his voice, for it did not carry with it an
inherent meaning, it needed a commentary of household
virtue, pious words which could assign a sacred value to a
guest. Not the value of irresponsible art, but of moral
responsibility. Love is kindred to art, it is inexplicable. Duty
can be measured by the degree of its benefit, utility by the
profit and power it may bring, but art by nothing but itself.
There are other factors of life which are visitors that come
and go. Art is the guest that comes and remains. The others
may be important, but art is inevitable.
