The art of Cyprus in ancient times was influenced by the great cultures which flourished
nearby in Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt and the Aegean. However, the island was never totally
absorbed into the orbit of any of these civilizations and the work of its artists retained its
own specific character. This carved stone head of a woman wearing a crown adorned
with rosettes and tiny figures is an example of Cypriot art of the 5th century BC. Now
preserved in the Nicosia Museum, the work shows how, at a time when Cyprus was
under Persian dominion, Cypriot art did not become "Orientalized" but looked to the
Greek world for inspiration.

### EDITORIAL

This year, half-way through the Decade for Women proclaimed by the United Na¬
tions in 1975, women from all over the world are taking stock of their situation,
notably at the World Conference of the UN Decade for Women being field in
Copenhagen from 14 to 30 July. The purpose of the Conference is to evaluate the
progress made in implementing the ten-year World Plan of Action for the advance¬
ment of women which was adopted by the International Women's Year Conference
at Mexico City in 1975, and to establish an action programme for the second half of
the Decade. Along with other international organizations Unesco has been working
to fulfil those recommendations of the Plan which fall within its fields of com¬
petence; some of these Unesco initiatives have given rise to material appearing in
this special issue of the Unesco Courier. Several of the articles published here are
dominated by the presence of a figure who might be called the "invisible" woman.
She may be invisible because she has been legislated out of existence by the in¬
human apartheid machine; or because the economic value of her work in the home
or in other unpaid activities is ignored by the various "indicators" which define the
profile of her country's social and economic situation; or as a result of some other
form of discrimination. However there are signs today that her situation may be
changing through the efforts of the world-wide movement for women's liberation.
Not only is there an intensification of research into women's status within different
cultures and regions but new methods of inquiry are being developed and new
questions are being asked by women social scientists who are removing the cloak
of invisibility from women who have been denied their full and equal participation
in social, cultural and political life.

RODOLFO STAVENHAGEN, Mexican
sociologist and anthropologist, is Unesco's Assis¬
tant Director-General for Social Sciences and
their Applications. He has taught at the National
University of Mexico, at the Universities of Paris,
Geneva and the Catholic University of Rio de
Janeiro, and was director of the Centre for Socio¬
logical Studies at El Colegio de Mexico (Mexico
CityI from 1972 to 1976. Among his many publica¬
tions are Agrarian Problems and Peasant Move¬
ments in Latin America (New York, 1970) Social
Classes in Agrarian Societies (New York, 1975)
and El Ingenio del Hombre (Mexico, 1976), a
social science textbook for secondary schools.
THROUGHOUT the world, in both
developed and developing coun¬
tries, women are the mainstay of the
hidden support economy which allows the
rest of the economy to function and which is
not mentioned in national accounts, which
does not appear in census reports and which
is not clearly reflected in the social and
economic indicators used by social scien¬
tists and planners to describe a country's
current situation or to measure its changes.
Economic and social development implies
the increasing participation of women in
economic activities at all levels, in educa¬
tion, politics and culture. Indeed, when we
compare the statistics of different countries,
we notice that one of the principal dif¬
ferences between economically developed
and underdeveloped countries is the fact
that in the former the number of women
participating in the labour force, in the pro¬
fessions, in the educational system, and in
cultural activities, is proportionately larger
than in the latter.
We may therefore confidently state that
the process of socio-economic development
(which is much more complex than the sim¬
ple increase in industrial output or gross na¬
tional product or per capita income) also
means the progressive improvement of the
status of women in society.
But does this mean , that in those
societies where such changes have not
occurred, women are unproductive
economically or that they are outside of the
economic system? Not at all. In keeping
"the home fires burning", as the saying
goes, in taking care of domestic chores and,
particularly, in bearing and raising children,
women play a decisive role in one of the key
elements of any economy: the reproduction
of the labour force.
This domestic economy is in fact essential
for the functioning of the economic system.
Yet it is often neglected, if not completely
overlooked in the analysis of economic tran¬
sactions, and the women who are responsi¬
ble for its operation are relegated, in¬
credibly, to the category of non-productive
household labour. It is assumed, statistically
at least, that they make no contribution to
the economy.

woman a conspiracy of silence
conceals and devalues
women's essential contributions
to economic
A famous British economist is reported
once to have remarked that if all gentlemen
were to marry their (paid) housekeepers,
then the indicators would show a decrease
in the participation of women in the labour
force and a reduction in the national in¬
come. This merely emphasizes the fact that
any indicator can be used very ambiguously
and that careful thought should be given to
the concepts which lie behind them.
The question then is not how can women
be integrated into development, but rather
how do we assess the nature and impor¬
tance of the domestic economy within the
total economy. It is precisely due to their
role in the hidden domestic economy that
women occupy the lowest ranks on the
various scales of indicators of social and
economic participation.
There are different and complex reasons
for this, and when we ask why don't women
participate in development or why do they
occupy such low positions on the social
scale, we are really inquiring about the
nature of social institutions and relations
and of cultural values.- Changes in the par
ticipation rates of women in various
economic and social activities (such as at¬
tending schools and universities, becoming
members of the professions and so forth)
sometimes actually require deep changes in
a society's structure involving not only an
improvement in the status of women but a
transformation of the social relations bet¬
ween men and women and of basic institu¬
tions such as the family.
Woman's position in the world can only
be properly understood if it is seen in the
perspective of her relationship with man and
within the context of the social institutions
that determine the interactions between the
sexes. Improvement in the status of women
therefore implies a redefinition of traditional
roles both within the family and in working
life.
The situation of women in society varies
from culture to culture. In traditional
agricultural societies, where the division of
labour between the sexes is not greatly
developed, there is an essential equality bet¬
ween men and women, at least in the
economic sphere. Where traditional sub
sistence agriculture becomes commercializ¬
ed, more money-oriented and market-
oriented, it is the men who tend to to take
over the economic activities, often by
becoming migrant labourers, and the situa¬
tion of women tends to deteriorate. There
are exceptions to this, of course, and in a
number of rural societies (in Africa and the
Caribbean, for example) women have taken
an active part in the mercantile economy.
In general, wherever labour is
remunerated it has an economic value, and
therefore non-remunerated labour (such as
the domestic labour of women) becomes
devalued economically and thus also socially
and culturally. If, in addition, the quan¬
titative indicators designed to measure the
performance of the economy neglect these
facts, then it is easy to see why women are
systematically said to be excluded from par¬
ticipation in development. Non-participation
is one thing, but the relegation of women to
spheres of activity which are essential to the
economy but which in male-oriented
societies are systematically downgraded,
undervalued and discriminated against ¡s j
quite another. t

### 41099: Yardsticks of social status

Yardsticks
of
social status
by Erwin S. Solomon
WHAT is an indicator and why
do we need indicators of
women's participation in
socio-economic development? The
simplest answer to the first part of the
question is that an indicator is a measure
or piece of information which indicates
something. This may first appear as a
simple truism but it is far more complex
than it seems. For to indicate something
implies a reason or a concern for doing
so, which, in turn, implies (dare I say
"indicates?") a value or goal behind the
concern.
Thus, indicators, by their nature, are
more than descriptive statements
(although they can be used for that also)
for they imply a certain dynamic ap¬
proach in relation to a target or goal.
Statistics are the main building blocks of
indicators, and are sometimes used as
simple descriptive indicators but they
are not themselves indicators. One may
visualize statistics as bricks and mortar
and indicators as the edifice that can be
built from them. Thus, the same bricks
can be used to build a roadway or a wall,
a temple of learning or a labyrinth.
Indicators are very often misused and
can thus easily mislead. A well known
economic indicator like the Gross Na¬
tional Product (GNP) may be used as an
example. GNP (or GNP per capita) is a
composite indicator reflecting, in
monetary terms, the value of goods, ser
vices and trade. It is commonly misused
however as an indicator of develop¬
ment, or even, of levels of living or of
quality of life. This it is not, although it is
certainly a part of development and
quality of life itself.
Indicators, especially dynamic ones,
are powerful instruments of policy
analysis and of social action and
nowhere is this more true than in the
area of concern of improving the status
of women and their participation in
development.
On the analytical level, the way we
describe the social situation of women is
crucial to our very understanding of the
true situation.
On the policy level the indicators used
and the system in which they are con¬
ceived will determine the very limits of
possible social action.
If, for example, we accept as an in¬
dicator of our concern with women's
role in employment the commonly used
statistic/ indicator of the per cent of the
labour force that is female we im¬
mediately limit the scope of analysis and
potential action to the formal employ¬
ment of women in the labour force.
Under this scheme, a goal of "equality"
could be expressed simply as achieving
more or less a 50 per cent female labour
force.
Analytical and policy relevant in¬
dicators which reflect women's role in

employment would obviously need to be
far more complete and include elements
relating to the quality of women's
employment, their distribution relative
to men, work situations specific to
women's role in the family as well as the
economy, etc. Indicators would, by their
very nature, be tied to concerns relating
to women's employment.
Indicators are thus potential in¬
struments of great significance for ac¬
tion. But understanding and elaborating
indicators are not enough. They have to
be used as well, and used well by
analysts, policy-makers, planners and
managers of social action programmes.
In this context it can be seen that
while many social concerns, especially
fundamental ones, may be considered
to be "universal", indicators themselves
are most assuredly not universal. Nor
are they value free, quite the contrary,
for policy relevant indicators are goal-
oriented, which is why they have to be
elaborated and used within their own
socio-economic and socio-cultural set¬
tings. This is why we at Unesco refrain
from proposing normative lists of in¬
dicators in favour of promotion and
co-operation with planners and policy¬
makers in Member States in their
elaboration and use of indicators.

> Discrimination against women in public
activities is certainly not limited to any one
geographic area or cultural region; it occurs
in both highly developed and in
underdeveloped countries. Whereas in
some places it is the result of long-standing
cultural traditions, in others it takes on more
subtle psychological forms. Women in
German-speaking regions have long borne
the brunt of the three "K's" (Kinder, Kirche,
Küche, children, church, kitchen).
In many developed countries where
higher education and jobs have opened up
for women in recent decades, it is note¬
worthy that women tend to concentrate
in certain kinds of services which may be
seen simply as an extension into the market
of their domestic sphere: schoolteaching,
nursing, sewing, food services, main¬
tenance, secretarial, entertainment and
similar activities of a subordinate nature.
Again, when the issue of participation is
raised it is useful to analyse the types of jobs
to which women haVe easier access and to
study the social significance of these ac¬
tivities in each particular culture. .
It is commonly held that equality between
the sexes will be achieved when women
have equal access to what has been tradi¬
tionally a "man's world". Much less is said,
however, about men's equal responsibility in
the domestic sphere; the implication being
that women will continue to cover that area
as their own special domain, in addition to
their new achievements.
Obviously, the issue is more complex than
simply exchanging sex-roles, a process
which in many societies is staunchly resisted
not only by men but by numerous women as
well, and which runs counter to many of the
basic cultural values that children learn at
home and at school. The long term improve¬
ment of the status of women in society must
needs imply a social redefinition of the
domestic support economy and of the func¬
tions of the family institution. The fact that
this issue is scarcely mentioned when the
"integration of women in development" is
proclaimed, simply shows that the domestic
economy is still very much "hidden" from
public perception.

industrial society, the large or extended |

Educational statistics (such as enrolment, attendance and drop-out
figures) are much more than cold figures that reveal the bare facts
about the degree of access of women to educational systems. They
constitute a highly significant "social Indicator" or yardstick of
broader aspects of women's position in society which can be used
for monitoring change in public attitudes towards the liberation of
women and girls from traditional social prejudices, evaluating the
opportunities available to them to achieve self-reliance and self-
fulfilment, and assessing their potential contribution to national
development. Right, off to school in Upper Volta.
"In taking care of domestic chores and, particularly, in bearing
and raising children, women play a decisive role in one of the key
elements of any economy: the reproduction of the labour force."
But the fact of motherhood often becomes the pretext for
isolating women from the social and economic fabric of which
they are part. This reinforces the concept, often ascribed
originally to ethnologists, of the dichotomy between man as
Homo faber, the technician, and woman, closer to nature as wife
and mother.

"A famous economist once remarked that if all gentlemen were
to marry their (paid) housekeepers, the indicators would show a
decrease in the participation of women in the labour force and a
reduction in the national income." As wives they would no
longer be listed as wage-earners and would therefore not figure
in national statistics. In rural communities wives contribute
largely to the economy through the production of food. Right, a

»Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
fundamental economic unit of production
and consumption. It had many social func¬
tions: education, security, care for the ill and
the aged, solidarity, community integration,
among others. Most of the needs of its
members could be satisfied within the family
structure. In many parts of the world this is
still the case, particularly in the rural areas of
the Third World countries. Indeed, perhaps
a majority of the world's families are of this
kind.
However, with the industrial revolution
came a basic cleavage between outside
economic activities and family life. Other
specialized institutions, both public, and
private, took over many of the functions
formerly dealt with by the family. And
whereas the menfolk became basically in¬
volved in these institutions, the women
stayed behind to take care of what remained
of home and household.
In the urban-industrial society the old con¬
cepts relating to family structure are no
longer pertinent, and women are torn bet¬
ween the two roles that a complex society
holds up to them as a model: home on the
one hand, career on the other. The position
of women in society will definitely improve if
and when the family is able to redefine its
own functions and when the hidden
domestic economy is brought out into the
open and dealt with on an equal plane
with, say, the production of foodstuffs or
the energy problem.
Recent years have witnessed the growth
of academic interest in the problems of
women. In a number of countries "women's
studies" have achieved university status as
special courses are taught or research cen¬
tres are organized. To be sure, this is not on¬
ly the result of scientific concerns. Women's
studies are more or less closely related to
women's organizations for political and civic
action, in other words, to the ever widening
movements in favour of women's emancipa¬
tion. These studies. have provided much im¬
portant new knowledge about the situation
of women in different societies, and are
creating everywhere a new awareness,
mainly among women themselves, about
the issues at hand.
Yet it is precisely their very success which
should sound a note of caution. As was sug¬
gested above, the problems of women can¬
not be isolated from those of the general
evolution of the economy and the society,
with which they are deeply enmeshed. By
underlining the specificity of women's
studies, is there not a danger of isolating
them from the general social fabric of which
they are a part? To be sure, a middle class
urban housewife in an industrialized country
may have much in common, as a woman,
with a peasant mother in the Third World.
But is not the former more closely linked to
the problems of her own particular society
and the latter to the destiny of peasantries
the world over?
The new academic discipline of "women's
studies" cannot afford to lead a ghetto ex¬
istence in isolation from the necessarily in¬
terdisciplinary approach which is required to
fully comprehend the social and economic
problems of women in different cultures.
This new and exciting field of research and
analysis is an important step in laying bare
the multiple and complex problems of the
"invisible" woman in the contemporary
world. -

### 41076: The Plight of the woman-breadwinner

woman-breadwinner
by Mayra Buvinic, Nadia H. Youssef and lisa Schumacher
ONE of the reasons why women are
consistently losing out in develop¬
ment programmes designed to
improve the conditions of the world's needy
is that women's economic activities are
misreported by censuses and other data.
Work that is not performed for wages in
the formal sector of the economy is not
counted as work. Women in developing
countries who work for wages in addition to
performing household duties are often
categorized as "housewives" rather than as
members of the labour force. Thus in perfor¬
ming a double duty of work at home and
work for wages, women are not counted as
working persons.
This inadequate data base for women is
probably due to a deeply ingrained Western
vision that places women inside the home
and restricts their functions to those of
homemakers and childbearers. The data
base for women as reproducers (child-
bearers and child-rearers) is infinitely more
satisfactory than the data base for women
as economic producers.
Development policies have reflected these
data inadequacies and imbalances as well as
harbouring the belief that women's place is
in the home; women have been "targeted"
as concerns to development planners
because of their reproduction and child-
rearing, not because of their productive
functions.
Since the productive economic activities
of women have not been reflected in cen¬
suses and world tables, development
policies whose goal is to raise the standard
of living of the poor have not utilized
women's economic resources. Policy
makers have not realized that women's in¬
efficient and under-remunerated economic
activities add to the grim overall economic
picture of underdevelopment. Nor have they
become aware that increasing women's pro¬
ductivity is crucial to improving this
economic picture.
Directed primarily to women of child-
bearing age, development projects in the
past have been basically designed to provide
family planning and nutrition information.
When they have explored income raising op¬
portunities for women, they have done so
with the goal of reducing fertility rather than
raising income per se. The reasoning was
that when women were provided with viable
options to early marriage and ensuing
motherhood, fertility rates would conse¬
quently decline.
A corollary to the Western vision of
women as homemakers and childbearers
places women in a nuclear family structure
where the man is the sole economic provider
and the head of the household or in a non-
Western family organization characterized
by strong familism and male supremacy.
The traditional family in the non-West (such
as joint and extended families) is seen as a
welfare system that provides psychological,
legal and economic protection toward its
kinsmen and kinswomen. It is assumed that
women's rights are protected, and that
women are extended economic support
regardless of whether they are single, mar¬
ried, divorced, widowed or abandoned.
Relying on assumptions and protected by
the lack of almost any data, development
practitioners have not considered the
possibility of targeting some of their aid to
women-headed households in the develop¬
ing countries. But why should they? While
arousing doubts, the assumption that men
provide for and protect nuclear households
in non-Western countries continues to
prevail in the minds of the development
planners.
In the United States this myth of the ideal
nuclear family structure was debunked
when it became apparent thatyvöfnen were
the sole heads of 34 per cent of all minority
households and 11 per cent of all white
families. In 1972, 52 per cent of the former
and 25 per cent of the latter families were
below the poverty level as compared to only
5 per cent of families with an adult male
head who were below this level.
Additional data have revealed that this is
by no means a phenomenon restricted to
the United States. Women-headed
households account for 35 per cent of all
households in many parts of the Caribbean.
Between 1960 and 1970, the proportion of
such households doubled in Brazil and in¬
creased by 33 per cent in Morocco. Using
census data for 74 developing countries we
calculated the total range of adult women
who because of their current marital/family
status carry the "potential" of being or
eventually becoming family heads. (1)
The percentage of potential household
heads who are women among total potential
household heads (2) varies from 10 per cent
to 48 per cent; the average for 74 countries
is 18 per cent. Their proportion could be 18
per cent in India, 23 per cent in Indonesia,
and about 46 per cent of the household
heads in Botswana, 18 per cent in Kenya
and 15 per cent in Iran.
As heads of families these women are
often solely responsible for providing for and
protecting the social and economic well-
being of their family members. Yet it ap¬
pears that these women have the least
resources to fall back upon and often receive
the lowest wages. Recent international data
lead us to believe that these women's
families constitute a major section of the
poor in all countries (be it in Central and
South America, in sub-Saharan and North
Africa or Asia) and that they might be "the
poorest of them all."
In Santiago, Chile, a 1973 field inquiry in
marginal slums showed that 29 per cent of
the women who headed families as com¬
pared to only 10 per cent of the men fell into
the lowest income bracket. In Guayaquil,
Ecuador, a similar survey indicated that 37.5
per cent of the women and 17 per cent of
the male family heads fell into the lowest in¬
come brackets. A representative sample
survey of metropolitan Belo Horizonte,
Brazil, revealed that 41 per cent of the
female-headed households as compared to
26 per cent of the male-headed households
were at poverty levels.
Moreover, when households headed by
prime age, divorced and separated women
were singled out, the proportion at poverty
levels reached 60 per cent. Reports from a
rural income distribution survey in Botswana
showed women-headed households to be
significantly poorer than men's.
For 15 Commonwealth Caribbean coun¬
tries, 59 per cent of female-headed
households and only 21 per cent of male-
headed households reported "no income"
or "not stated" income; on the other side of
the spectrum, 54 per cent of the male-
hraded households earned a thousand
dollars or more per month while only 13 per
cent of the female-headed households earn¬
ed these amounts. This rise in households
headed by women in developing countries
and their poverty status portray, in extreme
form, the need to correct the biases in
official statistics used for development
planning.
In the industrialized West divorce is a
major cause for the rise in women-headed
households; in Turkey, Algeria, Morocco
and Italy it is the emigration of male and
female labour to industrial centres of
Europe. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is male
emigration to towns and cities; in South
Africa and Zambia, men migrate to work in
the mines, leaving their families behind. In
Central and South America, female head¬
ship is created by women migrating to the
cities and by unstable serial unions in which
reproduction takes place, leaving mother
and children often abandoned in poverty.
In parts of the Middle East, real conflicts
are surfacing between increasing economic
pressures and the continued existence of
traditional obligations that inhibit kinship
units from providing economic support to v
female members as it is "ideally" and even r

Left, Peruvian women sell their produce
at the market at Chincheros, near
Cuzco. In addition to running their
households, women in the developing
countries are active In important sectors
of the economy, particularly in the
growing and marketing of agricultural
produce. But since these activities are
difficult to value and measure and are
outside the formal sector of the
economy, they do not appear in any
account as a contribution to the
national economy. Development
planners, therefore, tend to see
women's contribution as merely
supplementary or optional and to direct
their efforts towards providing more
remunerative and productive
employment opportunities for men,
arguing that men's employment benefits
the whole family. As a result, no help at
all is directed to those who need it

legally prescribed. In many countries, male
unemployment and male marginality have
prevented men from keeping their economic
obligations towards their kinswomen. This
has contributed to the breakdown of the ex¬
tended family.
The fact that an increasing number of
women among the poor are becoming the
sole or main economic providers for their
families, coupled with the fact that their pro¬
ductive activities, ignored by censuses and
planners alike, are mostly marginal, in¬
efficient and under-remunerated should
make women-headed households one of the
main targets of the new development
directions.
Concern has already been expressed that
in implementing the "basic needs strategy"
planners will fall into the trap of providing
adequate i.e., more remunerative and pro¬
ductive to unemployed and
underemployed men, leaving the presently
overworked and undercounted women with
inadequate employment. This concern
becomes overriding when the classic argu¬
ment that men's employment will benefit the
family is no longer applicable. It clearly does
so in the case of households that are headed
by women.
Efforts invested in assisting women
heading poor households with dependents
in developing countries, by providing these
women, above all, with adequate training
opportunities and employment, should have
a positive effect on the economic develop¬
ment of these countries. Increasing the pro¬
ductive capacity of this group of women
workers will help the country's economy in
the short run. Expanding the income poten¬
tial of these women will have a marked im¬
pact upon the economy in the long run by
paving the way for the emergence of a
capable future work force represented by
the children of women who head
households.

Women
and
apartheid
'Black South African women
stand on the lowest rung
of the ladder of oppression'
by Frene Ginwala and Shirley Mashiane

WIILE apartheid affects the lives of
all black South Africans with hor¬
rifying brutality, it is harshest in
its effect upon African women. As an
African in a racially differentiated society, as
a worker in a system dependent upon, and
therefore structured to provide, cheap
labour, and as a woman in a society controll¬
ed and dominated by men, the African
woman stands on the lowest rung of the lad¬
der of oppression.
The experience of apartheid, its direct im¬
pact upon African women, the manner in
which it circumscribes their lives and im¬
pinges upon every aspect of their existence,
the denial of a family life, the control of their
labour, the limits on movement, the subor¬
dinate status, the poverty, the struggle for
survival through the myriad laws, regula¬
tions, restrictions, permits and denials, all
have served to raise the political con¬
sciousness of African women in South
Africa.
In the South African legal system, African
women are considered as dependent upon
men, who themselves have no rights. Under
the Natal code, women have a status of
perpetual minority. Regardless of age,
education or economic status, a woman
may not inherit or own property in her own
right, enter into contracts or obtain credit.
She is always under the guardianship of her
father, her husband or other male relative.
Under customary law, the father's estate
generally passes to the male heirs only.
Laws incorporating similar provisions apply
in other parts of South Africa. In areas
reserved for Africans, land is not allocated
to women.
In rural areas, where the migrant labour
system has made women the effective
heads of households, they can only ad¬
minister or manage what land or income k
' there is on a day-to-day basis, for they re- r

main dependent upon their husbands for
decision-making.
In urban areas, women are dependent on
men for a roof over their heads. African
women are not allocated housing and can¬
not be registered tenants of rented houses.
Widows, divorcees and deserted wives can¬
not automatically remain in their homes. For
them and for single women the choice, if
choice it be, is either to become a lodger or
live in a single hostel.
In the areas where an African woman is
considered separately from father/
husband/son/male relative, the apartheid
system again works to her detriment. Apar¬
theid does not consider the African family as
a unit. Africans do not qualify for married
and family allowances in taxation. For pur¬
poses of residence or movement in South
Africa, Africans, regardless of sex, are con¬
sidered as single individuals. Throughout
what is designated as white South Africa (87
per cent of the land area), each member of
an African family mother, father and
children over sixteen has to qualify
separately as a single unit of labour for the
right to reside in the area. Even when such a
"right" is acquired by more than one family
member, it does not follow that they may
live together as a family unit.
In the 13 per cent of South Africa where
the white-made law does not make it illegal
for an African family to live together, there is
little land and what may be available is erod¬
ed and employment opportunities are
minuscule. The system created to provide
cheap labour forces the family apart, with
the job-seekers vying with each other and
the labour bureau bureaucracy for the
"right" to labour alone in "white" South
Africa. Upon the woman falls the burden
not just of reproducing labour but also of
ensuring her own survival and that of
her children, and the old, the sick and the
handicapped.
In pre-colonial societies, women were
usually subject to the control of chiefs,
headmen and heads of families. The division
of labour, though sexually differentiated,
was not simply biologically based, nor was it
egalitarian. However, traditional societies
did afford women respect, protection and
security. Colonial laws and later the apar¬
theid system have removed the responsibili¬
ty owed to woman by the society, denied
her protection and security, and at the same
time entrenched further her disabilities.
Within the Bantustans, one finds mirrored
the undemocratic and male-dominated
political structures of the white rulers. Some
features of "traditional" society are being
revived out of their historical and social
context. The first act of the Gazankulu Ban-
tustan was the legalization of polygamy.
The Transkei has introduced polygamy and
corporal punishment for girls. The position
of women was strikingly illustrated by the
arbitrary dismissal of a woman minister,
Stella Sigcau, on the grounds that she had
become pregnant though unmarried.
The Bantustan leadership collaborates in
the relocation of labour-intensive industries
to designated border areas where female
labour in particular is easily exploited. The
Bantu Development Corporations and in¬
dividual officials are frequently involved in
such enterprises, paying wages that are ap¬
pallingly low even by apartheid standards.
The Bantu education system entrenches a
conception of women's "traditional" role.
While limiting the scope of training offered
to all Africans, technical training for girls is
limited to domestic science curricula.
Neither the public service nor the tribal
universities will allow married women to re¬
main in employment.
For a woman, confined by the system to
the rural areas, the immediate concern is
survival for herself, her children and parents.
In recent years her difficulties have been
compounded. The designation of Ban¬
tustans as "foreign" countries has shifted
the costs of feeding, housing, education

and providing for families on to economies
that are not viable and unable to sustain the
population. In white South Africa, units of
labour may enter and remain only so long as
they are needed. What have been callously
termed the "superfluous appendages", the
women, the children, the old, the sick and
the handicapped, must go back and remain
in the Bantustans.
The relentless drive to remove Africans
from the urban areas and to move com¬
munities around arbitrarily has resulted in
the uprooting of over three million people.
To this must be added the eviction of
African labour tenants following the increas¬
ed mechanization of white farms. More and
more people are pushed into areas where
the land cannot support the existing popula¬
tion and the employment opportunities are
few. In KwaZulu, sites for the resettlement
of 300,000 people are being sought. Within
the last decade the resident population of
QuaQua has increased from 24,000 to over
200,000.
The figures mount up to staggering totals
and the implications are appalling when one
realizes that "resettlement" is a synonym for
dumping people on empty wasteland. The
population on the barren land thus increases
and with it the burdens on the women.
Women are no longer able to go legally to
the urban areas to take up employment. The
only opportunities available to them are the
two sectors with the lowest pay and the
greatest exploitation: agriculture and in¬
dustries set up in the border areas where in¬
dustry is exempted from even those few
safeguards provided for black workers under
the apartheid system.
Rather than accept such employment,
many defy the law and go to the urban areas
illegally. Some join their husbands and try to
establish some kind of family life in "squat¬
ter" camps. Others go to find employment.
For all of them, pass raids, detention, prison
and fines are considered as the price to be
paid for survival in apartheid South Africa.
For, despite having to spend months of
each year in prison, they are better off than
if they had remained in the rural areas. The
Financial Mail last year published the results
of a survey that revealed that there was a
702.7 per cent improvement in living stan¬
dards for a worker from the Ciskei who
works illegally in Pietermaritzburg for nine
'months and spends three months in prison.
A worker from Bophuthatswana who works
illegally in Pretoria for three months and
spends nine months in prison is still 28.5 per
cent better off. A Lebowa worker who
works illegally in Johannesburg for six
months and spends six months in prison im
proves his living standards by 170 per cent
(Financial Mail, 12 October 1979).
For women, who earn less than men, the
improvement would be correspondingly
lower. The real economic conditions in the
Bantustans can be gauged when one recalls
that, even after a 700 per cent improve¬
ment, the majority of male workers in urban
areas earn wages below the poverty datum
lineand women's wages are lower still.
There are women literally scratching for
food in the parched soil of the Bantustans.
There are women slaving for meagre wages
in the fields and in the border industries.
There are also women in tens of thousands
who live with their families and obtain
employment in defiance of apartheid laws.
Last year 20,290 women were arrested
for contravening pass and influx control
laws. (Rand Daily Mail, 4 March 1980).
Husbands and children are kept illegally in
"single" domestic quarters. Men and
women who qualify by apartheid regulations
to live only as "singles", live together in
squatter camps. Long established com¬
munities, arbitrarily removed elsewhere,
return and live illegally.
A small number of women are permitted
to live legally in the urban areas, for they
qualified before the total proscription was

, introduced. The majority of women
employed in the urban areas are domestic
workers. Though many employers require
them to reside in quarters provided in their
backyards, they are not permitted to have
husbands or children to stay with them over¬
night. Contract domestic workers are re¬
quired to sign a statement acknowledging
that violation of these regulations would
lead to a cancellation of the contract.
Domestic workers are not covered by any
protective legislation and their wages are
notoriously low. Over 60 per cent of
economically active African women are
employed as domestic or agricultural
workers in sectors where no minimum
wages are laid down and no unemployment
insurance is available.
Throughout the economy, African
women on average earn less than half the
amount African men are paid/ and only eight
per cent of white men's average earnings.
The Industrial Conciliation and Wage Acts
permit differentiation on the grounds of sex
and, in more than 240 job categories,
minimum wages for men are fixed at a
higher figure than minimum wages for
women (Financial Mail, 18 May 1979).
Because of their lower pay scales, African
women are often preferred in labour-
intensive industry, and the number
employed in manufacturing has increased
steadily. Occasionally employers replace
male workers with women. An example that
illustrates the changing pattern of using ever
cheaper labour is provided by the Natal tex¬
tile industry. At an early stage the workers
were mostly Coloured and Indian men. In
the 1930s, white women became significant
but their numbers fell rapidly in the 1940s,
with African men and Coloured and Indian
women being employed in greater numbers.
In the 1950s, African men were in the major¬
ity but a decade later African women were
being employed. Today women, mostly
African, form about 70 per cent of the work
force.
Apartheid regulations have a logic and
purpose, and the system is designed to en¬
sure the availability of cheap exploited
labour. The legal dependence of women,
the migrant labour system and impoverish¬
ment of the rural areas, the precarious
nature of any status a woman may acquire
and the refusal to recognize African family
units have combined to create a state of im-
permanence and insecurity and have served
their purpose in making African women the
cheapest form of labour within the apartheid
system.
Yet the struggle to live together where
they choose, to take what work is available
in defiance of the machinery of the State,
continues. Women of the Barolong people
continued to return to the village of Majeng
from which they had been removed. The
first group that returned was arrested and
found guilty of trespass; the second was
returned to the new area of Vaalboschhoek.
Thé return and arrest of a third group
brought recognition of their grievances from
the magistrate and a decision from the
. authorities to find them a more suitable area
for resettlement.
At Crossroads the resistance to removal
has been on a larger scale. Crossroads is
called a "squatter camp", but it has shown
itself to be a viable community in which the
bonds have grown stronger due to the
people's struggle to remain where they are.
Faced with the prospect of being moved,
the Crossroads Women's Committee has
succeeded in organizing the residents and in
mobilizing national and international sup¬
port. They have staked their claim to per¬
manence by establishing a school. The
women have kept watch to deter surrep¬
titious demolition of houses; they have
gathered in groups the better to confront
the police and demolition squads. They sat
down in the fields and demanded to be ar¬
rested as a group. They sat down before the
bulldozers and refused to move. They
dramatized their struggle in theatre and have
taken it across South Africa and projected it
upon the television screens of Europe and
the United States.
They have not yet won the right to remain
permanently, but four years after an applica¬
tion was first made to the courts to remove
more than 10,000 people, Crossroads is still
there and the people have not moved.
It should not be forgotten that the white
South African society is also a society
dominated by males. Even among the
privileged white group, women are
noticeable by their absence in organs of
decision-making. Though enfranchised
since 1930, there are today only two women
among the members of the all-white Parlia¬
ment and none in the Cabinet. The Broeder-
bond, which controls all the instruments of
power in the country, does not allow
women as members and no women are to
be seen at the senior levels of the National
Party.
There are no women among the directors
Above, members of the African National Congress Women's
League outside a pass control office. Women have played a major
role in the liberation struggle. One leading figure, Lilian Ngoyi, who
was president of the Women's League in the 1950s, died in March
this year after 16 consecutive years under a banning order which
meant that she was forbidden to write or speak in public or to meet
with more than one person at a time. The African National Con¬
gress (ANC) is the oldest liberation movement in South Africa.
Since it was founded in 1912 the ANC has advocated equality bet¬
ween blacks and whites and a non-racial, democratic South Africa.
It tried for fifty years to bring change through peaceful means. The
President of ANC, Chief Albert Luthuli, was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1961, the first African to be so honoured. The ANC
was banned in 1960 following the Sharpeville massacre when police
16
fired on a peaceful demonstration killing 69 people. The Govern¬
ment declared a state of emergency and thousands were arrested.
In response to continued state violence and . concluding that
peaceful resistance was impossible, the ANC went underground
and formed a military section, Umkhonto We Sizewe, which means
"Spear of the Nation". Many ANC leaders, including Nelson
Mandela, are serving sentences of imprisonment. The programme
of the ANC is enshrined in the Freedom Charter adopted 25 years
ago. It declared that South Africa belongs to all who live in it and
calls for no discrimination on the grounds of race or sex and a
redistribution of the land and wealth of the country. Right, view of

### 41077: Women and apartheid: black South African women stand on the lowest rung of the ladder of oppression

of the Anglo-American Corporation. No
woman is at the head of any major South
African industry, mining house, finance or
banking institution. White women also suf¬
fer from discrimination in wages. On
average they earn only 44 per cent of the
earnings of their male counterparts and the
sectors of white employment in which white
women are found are also those with the
lowest white wage scales.
Yet, when compared with black women,
white women are privileged indeed. To a
degree unknown in the rest of the world,
they are free from domestic labour and
responsibility. Most importantly, they have
the franchise and legal opportunities which
would allow them to shape a more
egalitarian society. This they have not done.
Cushioned by their comfort and privilege,
they have in general even refused to
acknowledge the oppression of black
women and failed to recognize their own.
Some white women have understood and
concerned themselves with the causes of
oppression in South Africa. A few Afrikaner
women from the most exploited of the white
working class helped to build trade unions
across racial lines. A small number of white
women have perceived the nature of apar¬
theid and have worked with the liberation
movement.
But the majority are cocooned by their
privilege. Most of those who see beyond it
concentrate on the symptoms rather than
the causes. They have formed organizations
and groups that reject politics but fail to
recognize that political power is at the root
of the problem. They call for peace but ig¬
nore the need for justice and a people's right
to fight for it. They call for contact across
racial barriers, extending one hand while
propping up separate development with the
other.
Their efforts are directed towards charity
and humanitarian assistance for the suffer¬
ing. They busy themselves making the
"slave quarters" in their immediate environ¬
ment more comfortable rather than tackling
the root cause of the suffering of the black
people apartheid. This is not to deny their
contribution in alleviating suffering but it is
necessary to differentiate such organiza¬
tions from the emancipatory organizations
of the oppressed, and such efforts from the
liberation struggle.
South African women recognize that it is
not men who oppress them but the apar¬
theid system. They do not seek or want a
liberation that will give them equality to
share the oppression of African men. For
them, the liberation struggle is the battle for
the liberation of all the South African
people, men and women, black and white,
from the apartheid system.
That is not to say that victory over apar¬
theid is seen as automatically removing the
oppression of women, nor that after na¬
tional liberation women will begin a new
struggle for their liberation. Rather they see
the two as intertwined. For, in the course of
the liberation struggle, the question is asked
and must be answered from apar¬
theid, but after that what kind of society ?
The Freedom Charter embodies the
aspirations of the oppressed people of
South Africa and is the programme of the
national liberation movement. In its clauses
there is a commitment to equality of status,
franchise and economic rights for men with
women.
The goals of the liberation struggle are
refined as the struggle progresses. But it is
in the process, too, that attitudes are
fashioned and the foundations laid for the
realization of such goals.
To the extent therefore that women par¬
ticipate in the liberation struggle they will be
able to influence and determine their status
and role in the new society and help to
create the egalitarian structures and condi¬
tions of a free South Africa.
The liberation struggle of the South
African people has received a wide measure
of international support. In their areas of
competence, non-governmental organiza¬
tions have sought to isolate apartheid South
Africa. They have recognized that the im¬
position of mandatory economic sanctions
against the Pretoria regime under Chapter
VII of the UN Charter is the single most ef¬
fective action the international community
can take in support of the liberation struggle
and have campaigned within their countries
and internationally for such action.
International agencies, governments and
non-governmental organizations have also
taken steps to provide direct assistance to
the liberation movement. There is a need for
assistance to be given, focused specifically
on the requirements of women, to help
them overcome the particular impact of
apartheid on women and to promote their
fullest participation in the liberation struggle
and in the development of a free and
democratic South Africa.

"I would rather have been a man; to be born a woman is a sin.
To be born a man is a privilege. Those who have done good
things or have not done bad things will have an opportunity
to be born men. If men's and women's education is equal, there
are no differences, reallyI know that whatever a man can do, a
woman can do also but it is still a privilege to be born a man."

A BIT OF AN EXCEPTION
"In Tunisia, I think I am considered a bit of an exception. My
parents and my children feel this when they compare me to
other mothers. My husband is very active; so am I. My children
objected when I accepted the position of president of the
Women's Union. They had had enough. They thought we were
both too politically- minded, too active. My children would like
to keep me as a mother. When I read the newspaper at the table
they say, 'That's the end. We've had it. Y.ou have become just
like our father'.
President of the National Union of Tunisian Women
A NATIONAL HERO
"Do you know what I would choose for a statue of a national
hero in this country? The working woman. The working woman
is the national hero because she goes to school and then goes to
a university and graduates. She works too takes a job. She
works exactly like a man. Even in the fields, the peasant woman
works beside the husband, seven hours a day at hard work.
Then she goes home and is required to play the role of
housewife 100 per cent cooking, cleaning, washing, caring for
the children. A woman does two major jobs, which no man
would ever be able to do."
Woman director of an Egyptian publishing house
SO MANY THINGS TO DO
"Women, you know, have more talents for doing things than
men. It's only that men's talents are better recognized because
they only concentrate on a few things. Women have got so many
things to do that nobody ever looks at how many things they
do. If I had a chance to learn something, I would like to learn
how to help people. I would like to be a nurse".

A CERTAIN NUMBER OF EGGS TO LAY
"My husband used to say that it isn't normal to avoid a life that
you are destined to have. He said that if I had been given a
potential to bear a certain number of children, it was necessary
to bring them into the world. He said I didn't have the right to
prevent itthat I was like a chicken with a certain number of
eggs to lay, and that I had to lay them. He said it would be a sin
not to. My husband at first didn't know that I had a
contraceptive device. I didn't want any more children. My health
wouldn't stand it. Now he agrees because they talk about it on
the radio."

WHAT A PITY YOU DID NOT HAVE A SON
"I was an only child, and a girl. In a Sri Lankan family, that is
a sad thing for a father. Right in front of me people would say.
to my father, 'What a pity you did not have a son'. I don't
know for what reason, but I think my father always believed
that women should be emancipated. For example, he was against
the dowry. He even brought a motion against the dowry system
in parliament in 1936. But the motion was defeated. He had
modern ideas, and he always pushed me on. He treated me as if
I were a boy. He pushed me on from one class to another, and I
would say, 'Oh, that's enough. I'm a mere girl. How can I pass
that examination?' But he would say, 'Go on, go on'. He'd take
me somewhere and say 'This is my daughter. She's in school and
she's done this and that', and I would feel embarrassed and
ashamed. My father influenced me very much."
Famous Sri Lankan political scientist
WOMEN ARE VERY COURAGEOUS
"You know, women are very courageous just like men. We
have women leaders who step right up, give .speeches or lead
demonstrations. If our women see this, it will encourage them. It
will make them feel that, after all, we are not still in the past."
Sudanese social welfare worker
THE LAST WORD.
.FROM A MAN
"The reason men don't want to have women in authority is
because they don't want women giving them orders. They are
accustomed to giving orders themselves, and they don't want
women doing it. That's very clear. But I wish a woman would
get elected mayor of this town. The men haven't done any good.
All they do is get drunk. We should give women a chance to see
if they can do better".

### 41078: Male chauvinism in the mass media

| "In almost every country
I the media work force is
I predominantly male...
I Women are exploited in
I terms of their sexuality
I and physical appearance.
IN many ways, mass media systems are
a reflection, in microcosm, of distri¬
butions of power and control. In a world
where women's access to political and
economic power is in most cases severely
limited, their status and roles are defined
within political, economic and cultural
systems which tend to exclude them from
active participation. So, in the sense that
cultural agents or institutions contribute to
the socialization process within systems
which are directed by political and economic
imperatives, the mass media's role is
primarily to reinforce definitions and iden¬
tities set in a framework constructed for and
by men.
A number of factors particular to the
structure and internal demands of media
organizations have suggested to some
theorists of sexual inequality that the mass
media may play a particularly conservative
role in socialization, reinforcing traditional
values and beliefs.
These factors include the sexual com¬
position of the media work-force which in
almost every country is predominantly male,
overwhelmingly so in the influential areas of
management and production. Then there is
the reliance of many mass media organiza¬
tions on commercial backing and a con¬
sequent pressure to deal in known and ac¬
cepted images and contents. Thirdly, mass
media products, whether television or radio
programmes, magazines, newspapers or
films, are, in general, required to make an im¬
mediate and vivid impact and to be quickly
and easily absorbed by their audience. Con¬
siderable reliance is therefore placed on the
use of simplified, recognizable and standar¬
dized characterizations in media output.
For these reasons, the concern of resear¬
chers has been to identify the extent to
which the media present a social reality
which, if not demonstrably false, feeds on
the most conservative forces in society, ig¬
noring new trends until they have become
relatively established and accepted, thus
fulfilling a primarily reinforcing role rather
than a transforming one in the culture.
A problem arises, however, from the
geographical bias of the available data,
much of which originates in North America
and Western Europe, although there is a
growing body of research and documenta¬
tion from Australia, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and from Asia.
Information from Africa and the Pacific re¬
mains scant, while data from Eastern Euro¬
pean countries are difficult to locate. In the
case of Africa and the Pacific, the lack of
documentation primarily reflects a pre¬
occupation with developing what are rela¬
tively young media systems. Experiences
tend to be documented at later stages in
the process.
The difficulty in obtaining data from
Eastern European socialist countries arises
largely from the fact that a specific set of
problems concerning the relationships of
women and the mass media do not seem to
be formulated in a distinct way in these
societies.
Overall, media treatment of women can

"On film, in the press and the broadcast

typically go no further than the confines of

"Overall, the proportion of
women employed in film,

30 per cent in any country."
Nevertheless, a number of
outstanding women have
stamped their mark upon the

"Women are rarely portrayed as rational, active or
decisive... they are seldom in a position to exercise
authority over an adult male." This is especially true of
children's books in which stereotype portraits of women
as wives, mothers and daughters are the rule. A recently
published French children's book. Moi, Ma Grand-Mère...,
(My Grandmother is a...), from which this drawing is
taken, is a notable exception. In it one child after another
tells how his or her grandmother is a cosmonaut, a
soldier, an animal-trainer, a racing-driver or, as here, the
captain of a fishing boat.

best be described as narrow. On film, in the
press and the broadcast media, women's ac¬
tivities and interests typically go no further
than the confines of home and family.
Characterized as essentially dependent and
romantic, women are rarely portrayed as ra¬
tional, active or decisive.
Both as characters in fictional media
material and as newsmakers in the press and
broadcasting, women are numerically
under-represented, an absence which
underlines their marginal and inferior status
in many spheres of social, economic and
cultural life.
, Prevalent news values define most
women, and most women's problems, as
unnewsworthy, admitting women to
coverage primarily as the wives, mothers or
daughters of men in the news. In their own
right, they make the headlines usually only
as fashionable or entertainment figures.
Much media advertizing directed at women
as consumers is condescending in tone and
manipulative in intention; as the "bait"
through which products are advertized,
women are exploited in terms of their sex¬
uality and physical appearance.
An overwhelming body of North
American and European research indicates
that, in relation to women's actual participa¬
tion in the work force, all media under-
represent women workers.
This is significant because the question of
power and status of men vis-à-vis women in
media portrayals relates in part to the kinds
of occupational role to which each sex is
predominantly assigned. Since women are
rarely seen in authoritative positions such as
lawyers, doctors, judges, scientists they are
seldom in a position to exercise direct
authority over an adult male.
A study of the pattern of advising and
ordering in male-female interactions found
that dramatic characters on television were
selected, occupations were assigned and
plots developed in such a way as to
minimize the chances for women to display
superiority, except in traditionally accepted
female areas of knowledge. A further indica¬
tion of the media's emphasis on male
authority is the reliance on male voices in
advertizing to "sell" products.
In one of the very few cross-cultural
studies of media imagery in Latin
American and U.S. working-class and
middle-class magazines it was found that
although there were some class and cultural
differences, women were overwhelmingly
idealized in terms of dependence, humility,
lack of initiative, lack of career, lack of self-
control, intense emotionality, and so on, in
both cultures. According to the fictional
reality of the media, then, women are ac¬
tually rewarded for ineffectually, rather
than for actively controlling their own lives.
Although information is fragmentary and
the evidence is perilously thin, there is some
indication that images of women in certain
African countries may reflect and benefit
from a relatively self-conscious use of the
media in the general process of develop¬
ment. Reports suggest a growth in stories
about women, as well as a stress on their
potential contribution to development at
national and international levels.
Relatively little is known about the extent
and nature of women's participation in the
media industries. Incomplete and often
unreliable data paint a patchy picture.
Overall, the proportion of women employed
in film, broadcasting or in the national press
rarely exceeds 30 % in any country: often
the percentage is very much lower.
To give some examples from broad¬
casting: in the United States, 30 % of the
work force at television network head¬
quarters and also at network-owned stations
in 1977 was female; in Italy, women ac¬
counted for 20 % of the jobs in the national
television network (RAI),1975. It has been
estimated that in India women constituted
about 25% of the work force in broad¬
casting in the same year.
Women do slightly better in some Scan¬
dinavian countries: in Sweden women com¬
prise 33 % and in Norway 38 % of all
employees in the national broadcasting cor¬
porations (1976 figures). At the other end of
the scale, only 6 % of those employed in
NHK, the Japanese broadcasting system,
are women.
In the print media, the picture is really no
better. As far as can be established, women
rarely account for more than a quarter of the
jobs in journalism overall: Hungary, Poland,
Canada all have about that proportion and
Britain and the Lebanon have slightly fewer
(around 20 %). Several European countries
report about 15 % of women in press jobs
example, Norway, Denmark and Ger¬
many had this proportion in 1977.
Elsewhere, the proportions can be even
lower. Estimates put the percentage of
women in the Pakistan press at not higher
than 10 %, and in the Kenyan press at about
5 %. In Korea, only 2 % of jobs in the press
are held by women, while Japanese women
"To date, evidence of the impact of women working within the media, in terms of
producing an output which is qualitatively different, is slight... Until women
constitute a 'critical mass' within the media, their ability to work against accepted
cultural and professional values will be negligible." Valentina Leontieva (in profile

occupy no more than 1 % of positions in the
press medium.
In some countries, certainly, women now
occupy more than 30 % of media jobs' in a
few, they approach 40 % of media workers.
The Swedes have settled on a 60:40 ratio in
most occupational sectors as representing
national equality. Is it not arguable that in
some countries, at least, equality at that
level has almost been achieved?
However, scrutiny of the data to see just
where in the media women are employed
shows that the global figures mask even
greater disparities between men and
women. For instance, although 38 % of
broadcasting jobs in Norway are held by
women, 63 % of jobs at the lowest wage
level are also filled by women.
Women are generally concentrated at the
lower levels of particular job categories, or
else hived off into areas which are over¬
whelmingly "female". For that reason, the
Equality Project in Sveriges Radio (the
Swedish national broadcasting organiza¬
tion) aims for a minimal 60:40 ratio within
any particular occupational category.
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
found that in 1975, although 16 % of jobs in
top management or as departmental heads
were filled by women, most of these women
were not in key policy-making positions. In
the same year, the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation found that 93 % of
management-level jobs were held by men. In
the Australian Broadcasting Commission in
1977, no management positions were oc¬
cupied by women. The Italian RAI had 4 %
of women in a category spanning ad¬
ministrative and managerial jobs in 1975. In
Finland in 1978, all fourteen members of the
Board of Directors were male, while at
.middle-management level 6 % of posts were
held by women. The Norwegian broad¬
casting corporation (NRK) has 50 different
departments: only two are headed by
women. Of the 71 women in the Ghana
Broadcasting Corporation in 1975, two were
heads of section: these were the Head of
Audience Research and the Assistant Con¬
troller of External Broadcasting.
The same pattern is repeated at the
creative/ professional level, where access to
top posts is very limited for women, unless
the area of activity is "feminized". Thus,
though there are a fair number of women
heading programme departments in
children's, women's or even religious and
educational programming, and a large
number of women editing similar features
pages in the press, current affairs, news,
drama, science and sport remain almost
completely barred.
In Britain in 1975, for example, the
Association of Cinematograph, Television
and Allied Technicians (ACCT) found that
only 8 % of its members employed by the
independent television companies (ITV) as
directors or producer-directors were
women. In fact, it established that in all job
categories, a much higher proportion of
men reached the top grade than women.
Only 2 % of television producers in the
ABC (Australia) were women in 1977. These
are particularly depressing figures, consider¬
ing that the bulk of programme support
staff, production assistants and production
secretaries are women. Two broadcasting
organizations with untypically high propor¬
tions of women producers are the Swedish
and the Singaporean services, where
women account for 30 % and 38 % of all
producers, respectively.
In journalism too, women predominate at
the lower echelons, although the overall pic¬
ture seems somewhat better than in broad¬
casting. Thus, about a quarter of the
editorial jobs are said to go to women in the
U.S.A. while 28 % of editorial posts in Bri¬
tain are held by women. However, this
general picture is heavily influenced by the
very large number of female editorial staff
concentrated in traditional women's areas.
In general, women are relegated to areas
which are seen as having only marginal im¬
portance. The ACTT in Britain found its
members working primarily on educational,
arts and children's programmes in 1975. In
the United States, only about 10 % of news
personnel in television and radio stations,
for instance, were female in 1974, and most
of these were in low-level editorial jobs. In
Japan, NHK has recruited no women news
reporters for 20 years: women programme-
makers (about 1 % of the total production
staff) are almost exclusively concerned with
children's programmes or programmes deal¬
ing with cookery and similar activities.
At the technical level, there is a negligible
number of women in any broadcasting or
film organization anywhere. This an almost
universally male-dominated area. One ex¬
ception is Finland, where 20 % of all
technical staff in the Finnish Broadcasting
Company were women in 1978: women ac¬
counted for 42 % of film editors and 28% of
film supervisors, although only one of the
eighty camera operators was female.
The ABC in Australia found that 95% of
its technical staff were male, in 1977. In Bri¬
tain, the ACTT found that less than 10% of
its women members were technicians. Even
in Sweden, only 9% of women in Sveriges
Radio were working in technical areas in
1978. Almost everywhere, women tech¬
nicians are confined to the very lowest
grades.
At the same time, the secretarial and
clerical jobs are almost completely filled by
women in most broadcasting organizations.
In fact, when we talk of "women in the
media", we describe for the most part
women working as production secretaries,
script/continuity staff and clerk-typists.
In Britain, 100% of production
secretaries/producers' assistants among
ACTT members were female in 1975; in
Taiwan, nearly 90% of these staff across all
three television networks were women in
1976; all 83 continuity staff in the Finnish
Broadcasting Corporation were women in
1978. In the ABC in 1976, 58% of women
employees were clerks. Of all ACTT women
members in Britain, 60% were employed in
1975 as producers' assistants/production
secretaries or as continuity personnel.
These facts become particularly important
when seen in the context of earning levels
and career development. Not only are
women's jobs lower-paid than, for instance,
the technical jobs dominated by men: they
are also "dead-end" jobs, with no obvious
line of promotion.
It is difficult to find any hard evidence to
support the proposition that the portrayal of
women in the media differs when a woman
is producing the ¡mages. This is partly a con¬
sequence of the way in which research in
this area has typically been carried out.
A heavy research focus on content
analysis means that there have been virtually
no attempts to establish links between the
dominant ¡mages and the dominant values,
beliefs or attitudes of media personnel. A
few scattered studies have managed to
establish that, for instance, the female
editors of women's pages are on the whole
oriented by the same traditional concerns
and priorities as their male counterparts, and
that women's judgements about news-
worthiness resemble those of men.
Another study, examining the news
perceptions of journalism students, found,
that women students had the same
stereotyped picture of women as male
students. Although they themselves were
interested in politics and not "traditional"
women's concerns, they thought that they
were unusual and that "ordinary" women
were more interested in mundane matters.
It is also true that many instances can be
found of individual women producers, jour¬
nalists or decision-makers being associated
with, or directly responsible for, anti-female
material. This underlines the simplistic
nature of some statements made about
media output and male domination.
The fact is that most women and most
men share common cultural perspectives.
The problem is not, therefore, simply to
open up media employment to women, but
at the same time to work towards changing
women's self-perceptions, evolving and
directing measures against a cultural value
system which at present not only accords
women lower status, but also frequently
leaves them unaware of the fact.
To date, evidence of the impact of women
working within the media, in terms of their
producing an output which is qualitatively
different, is slight. This has been attributed
partly to the decision-making patterns of
most media organizations, and their rela¬
tionship to dominant economic and political
institutions, as well as to the existence of
established professional practices. Until
women constitute a "critical mass" within
the media, their ability to work against ac¬
cepted cultural and professional values will
be negligible.

### 41092: Women in Soviet society today

Women in Soviet
Photo M. Kuschtareva © APN, Moscow
by Alexander Birman
AMONG the many forms of inequality
found in different societies sex
discrimination is perhaps one of the
most important. From the start, the young
Soviet government set itself the goal of
eliminating this discrimination and of secur¬
ing equal rights for women.
Today 51 per cent of the over 110 million
factory and office workers in the Soviet
Union are women. Women constitute 74 per
cent of all teachers, 83 per cent of doctors
and health workers, and 84 per cent of the
workers employed in the distributive trades.
The figures vary from region to region. In
the Russian Federation, for example,
women form 53 per cent of the work force,
in Tajikistan 39 per cent.
There are no women engaged in mining,
26
the steel industry and other industries entail¬
ing hard physical labour, but many in the
textile, clothing and instrument making in¬
dustries. Many work in occupations calling
for firmness and persistence, for instance,
as geologists or meteorologists.
Enterprises often prefer to take on women
rather than men for certain jobs, knowing
them to be more efficient and painstaking.
We find women working as chief accoun¬
tants and in charge of chemical and other
laboratories. Women judges, lawyers and
bank managers are common.
In 1977-78, our higher educational
establishments had 5,037,000 students, and
2,568,000 of them (just over half) were
women. Here again the pattern is not a
uniform one. The lowest proportion of
women students is found at agricultural col¬
lege (35 per cent). The highest is in
economics (64 per cent), the arts and
medical colleges (57 per cent), and in in¬
dustrial colleges (40 per cent).
Over the past 25 years women have con¬
quered the citadel of science. In 1950 they
accounted for a third of all scientific
workers. In 1977 they made up 511,600
(40 per cent) of a total of 1,279,000. More
than 2,700 women are Academicians, cor¬
responding members of the Academy or
professors, and over 5,000 have D. Sc.'s.
Men and women get equal pay for equal
work, and women with young children enjoy
special advantages: no night shifts, no
obligation to travel because of their work,
and so on.
An interesting fact is that while the
average lifespan in the USSR is 70, for men
it is 64 and for women 74. There is much
speculation as to why this should be so. The
probable explanation is that more men are
engaged in mining, building, driving and
other occupations which have a bearing on
their lifespan.
Soviet women play an active part in
political life, serving on trade union, party
and control committees.
One member of the Supreme Soviet in
three is a woman and so are half of our local
councillors. Women account for between 35
and 44 per cent of higher trade union of¬
ficials, and for two-thirds of the committee
members at factory branch level.
There are many more reasons why we
regard women as a cementing force, as one
of the pillars of Soviet society. Besides the
part she plays in industrial and social life, the
woman is a mother, wife, grand-mother,
sister or girl-friend and plays a leading part in
the upbringing of future citizens.
During the Second World War Soviet

lives of the wounded and treated the sick.
At the front they fought as pilots and
snipers. Thousands were given military
decorations, and many the title of Hero of
the Soviet Union.
Soviet women are full-fledged members
of society, independent and respected.
In other words, there are no problems? Oh
yes, there are!
First, there is the problem of employment
as the following figures reveal:
Percentage of women among gainfully
employed workers	 1940 1977
In the USSR
as a whole	 39 51
In the Russian
Federation	 41 , 53
In Tajikistan
(Soviet Central Asia)	 29 39
Working women find it difficult to raise
several children, and not all want to send
them to nurseries. That explains why the
practice of home working has become more
frequent of late. Enterprises deliver materials
and collect the finished goods.
Shorter hours and a shorter working week
for women are also being introduced. In the
villages, branches of the food industry are
being set up to provide occupations for
women.
Next there is the problem of job distribu¬
tion. Though much has been done recently
to overcome lop-sided economic develop¬
ment, there are still many predominantly
"male" and "female" regions. Women
predominate in the textile industry in the
central part of the country and in "resort"
areas such as the Crimea and the Caucasus,
while men predominate in the mining areas
of Siberia, the North and Far East.
A third batch of problems might be
described as personal and sociological. It
hardly needs any profound research to
discover that women working the same
hours as men get far less time to
themselves. It is men who spend most time
watching television, going to football
matches, fishing and so forth.
The ratio of divorces to marriages has
recently doubled, and more divorce pro¬
ceedings are started by women who are
financially independent. I would not put this
down entirely to the fact that men do less
than their share of the household tasks, but I
am sure it is a factor.
To ease the burden of household chores,
public amenities are being rapidly expanded.
In 1965 there were 193,000 service units
employing 1,300,000 people. In 1977 there
were 264,000 employing 2 1/2 million, and
the services provided have been vastly
improved.
There is still a long way to go yet. But we
are moving ahead.

The crusade for women's eman¬
cipation has catalyzed a vital in¬
tellectual movement which is pro¬
ducing a growing body of literature
inspired by a new awareness of
woman's experience in the modern
age. In the world of education this
movement has stimulated the
growth of academic interest in the
status and problems of
womenwhat has come to be
known as "women's studies". In
May 1980, as part of its programme
for the advancement of women
and its activities in connexion with
the Decade for Women, Unesco
organized a meeting of specialists
in women's studies from the dif¬
ferent world regions. Articles on
the next six pages are based on
papers presented to the meeting.

AMONG the major arguments that feminist criticism directs at
social science is that it concentrates on the distortion and
misinterpretation of women's experience. Women have
not only been very largely ignored in traditional approaches to know¬
ledge; where women have been considered at all we have been mea¬
sured in masculine terms.
The concept of the human being as a universal category is only the
man writ large. "Woman" is considered an abstract deviation of this
essential humanity; she is a partial man, or a negative ¡mage of man,
or the convenient object of man's needs. In any case, a woman is
defined exclusively in terms of her relationship to men, which
becomes the source from which female stereotypes emerge and are
sustained.
Moving beyond these stereotypes requires renaming the
characteristics of women, not in terms of deviations from or nega¬
tions of a masculine norm, but as patterns of human responses to
particular situations. In this view, masculinity and femininity are
simply different human possibilities that have emerged historically.
This understanding has led feminist scholars to rethink the concept
of the person to include traditionally female characteristics.
Another strand of feminist criticism of the content of knowledge
about women as defined by the social sciences concerns the
assumption that the human being and "his" social environment are
mutually compatible. According to this assumption, the personality
is formed by and therefore reflects its social contexts. The male
character structure and patriarchal culture mutually reflect and sup¬
port one another through social, political, and economic institutions.
For this approach to person and society to remain consistent,
women and other deviants must either become invisible or their
estrangement from, or failure in, such a society must be explained in
terms of their "natural" inferiority.
In calling attention to women's invisibility in social science and in
rejecting the notion of women's natural inferiority, feminists have
challenged the assumption that self and society are mutually reflec¬
tive and. supportive. Instead, they have stressed the idea that girls
and women have grown up and have lived in social contexts that are
opposed to their needs as human beings. These social contexts, they
argue, are patriarchal: through the organization of social relations,
women are controlled by men and are culturally devalued. Whether a |
woman manages to struggle against this subjugation or succumbs to I

( it, or more likely both, in a patriarchical culture, she is still an out¬
sider, an other, a marginal person, a deviant. In short she is
alienated.
As well as criticizing the content of social knowledge about'
women, many feminists also criticize the methods by which this
knowledge is obtained. According to this criticism, the patriarchal
bias is reflected in the ways in which questions about women are
posed: the absence of concepts that tap women's experience, the
viewing of women as an unchanging essence independent of time
and place, and the narrowness of the concept of the human being
reflected in limited ways of understanding human behaviour.
Like the Marxist tradition within which she works, the criticism for¬
mulated by the Canadian sociologist, Dorothy Smith, challenges the
norm of objectivity that assumes that the subject and object of
research can be separated from one another through a
methodological screen. The subject-object dichotomy in social
science refers to the distinction between the person conducting the
research and the person about whom knowledge is being developed.
The ideal of objectivity was advocated by nineteenth century
positivists who argued that the object of social knowledge should be
regarded as any other physical phenomenon and that the subject
who conducts research must always be on guard not to let feelings
"infect" research.
Smith argues that the methodological norm of objectivity is itself
socially and historically constituted, rooted in an ideology that at¬
tempts to mystify the social relations of the knower and the known
through procedures that appear anonymous and impersonal. This
aura of objectivity can be maintained so long as the object of
knowledge, the "known", can be an "other", an alien object that
does not reflect back on the knower. It is only where women are also
brought in as the subjects of knowledge that the separation between
subject and object breaks down.
This emphasis upon the idea that subject and object are humanly
linked converges with the interpretive tradition in the social sciences.
The interpretive tradition emphasizes the idea that social knowledge
is always interpreted within historical contexts, and that truths are,
therefore, historical rather than abstract, and contingent rather than
categorical. The questions that the investigator asks of the object of
knowledge grow out of her own concerns and experiences. The
answers that she may discover emerge not only from the ways that
the objects of knowledge confirm and expand these experiences, but
also from the ways that they oppose or remain silent about them.
The third criticism that feminist scholars direct against traditional
social science is concerned with the purpose of the social knowledge
of women. It certainly takes no more than a modicum of perception
to realize that women have become the latest academic fad. As ob¬
jects of knowledge, women have become marketable commodities
measured by increasing profits for publishers and expanding
enrolments in women's studies courses. While women are riding the
crest of the wave which we ourselves have helped to create, it may
be a rather sobering, albeit necessary, task to reflect on the
ephemeral nature of the academic market in which we are now
valued.
In this respect we have much to learn from the academic social
science exploitation of the poor, especially the Blacks, in the sixties.
In the name of academic liberal concern and compensation the black
ghetto was measured, analysed, processed, dissected in short,
reduced to manipulate data that advanced the career interests of the
investigators but did little to improve the plight of the investigated.
The fact that research on the black ghetto is now passé, although
black ghettos continue to exist, and research on women is now au
courant, should give us pause. Once women have had "their day",
once the academic market has grown tired of this particular "area",
once the journals are glutted with information about women, how
then shall we justify the importance of studying women? Shall
knowledge of women also recede in the shadow of benign neglect?
The issue here concerns the exploitation of women as objects of
knowledge. So long as we endorse the idea that the purpose of the
study of women is justified solely in terms of our past exclusion as
objects of knowledge, we inadvertently contribute to this exploita¬
tion as well as to its faddish nature.
Women are an attractive subject to exploit so long as we hold that
the purpose of social knowledge is simply getting more information.
In social science's unrestrained pursuit of information, any new ob¬
ject of study that can generate mounds of data is of interest so long
as it is a prolific source. When the data are no longer new, the object
of study loses its primacy.
Along with this flimsy market valuation of content is the problem
of simply recording the present or past conditions of women. The
30
methodological approach which recognizes as valid only the factual
recording of what is allows no justification for attending to alter¬
natives to present conditions. The effect of this approach is to justify
the present.
Opposed to this social science about women is an alternative
social science for women. A social science for women does not ex¬
clude information about women, but informs the knowledge it seeks
with an intention for the future rather than a resignation to the pre¬
sent. This dialogue with a future suggests a social science that is not
simply a doleful catalogue of the facts of patriarchy, but an opposi¬
tion to the very facts that it discovers.
The opposition to patriarchal domination within both subject and
object, knower and known, is a profound expression of a longing for
freedom from that domination. For those of us who are seeking
knowledge of women, this idea of freedom can be expressed as a
future intention which indicates to us which, facts in the present are
necessary to know. Without this sense of what knowledge is impor¬
tant for our liberation, we are in the situation of gathering any and all
information we can about ourselves so long as it sells, and thus we
exploit ourselves as objects of knowledge.
The difference between a social science about women and a social
science for women, between the possibilities of self-exploitation and
those of liberation, is our imaginative capacity to imbue our
understandings of the world with a commitment to overcoming the
subordination and devaluation of women.
The feminist criticisms of social science content, method, and pur¬
pose are not tightly integrated into an academic discipline. They are,
rather, strands that are just beginning to emerge. As a result,
women's actions are being reinterpreted and profoundly illuminated
from the perspective of women's consciousness. Social institutions
such as motherhood are being re-examined for their patriarchal
assumptions and are being countered with a vision of decent and
humane parenting.
A psychology of women emphasizes its intention to be for women
by not only explaining the conditions that affect the psychology of
women and men, but also by exploring the bases from which those
conditions can be transformed. To attend to the feminist criticism is
to open the social sciences to both the feminist challenge
and its hope.

Africa: a new look from the inside
by Zenebework Tadesse
"Africa and Africans have
historically been the object of
research by non-Africans. This
historical reality is much more
true concerning research on
women in Africa." The authors
of these research studies have
often adopted a."tourist"
approach to the women of
Africa, seeing their physical
characteristics, their costumes
and their customs, not in terms
of the individual, but as an
expression of the exotic folklore
of an entire ethnic group. Left, a

TO focus on the question of research on women in Africa is at
once to point to the vast potential it has and the constraints it
now faces. Globally, the struggle against the subordination of
women has taken a multiplicity of forms. One of them is to suspect
and query all hitherto standard and accepted conventional wisdom,
posing new questions and constantly examining even those assump¬
tions that might have resulted from the struggles against the subor¬
dination of women and portrayed as beneficial to women. In line with
that tradition,, one ought to start by asking what is research on
African women? Who carries out this research? What purpose does
this research or lack of it serve?
Research strictly defined in the academic sense as the production
of scientific knowledge is a relatively new and peripheral discipline in
Africa. I am thinking here of research as a full time and a major form
of preoccupation by Africans. For Africa and Africans have
historically been the object of research by non-Africans. This
historical reality is much more true concerning research on women in
Africa.
Political independence and the crisis of conventional development
theory have led to the creation of more local research institutes,
recruiting of local researchers and defining research priorities in ac¬
cordance with what are considered to be local needs. However, even
today, only a handful of local women researchers have joined these
research institutes and problems specific to women have not been
seriously included in the long list of research priorities.
There is a wide difference between research concerns, topical,
conceptual and methodological choices by external researchers and
local researchers. In most cases "research" is limited to "action-
oriented research", i.e. areas considered to be of primary concern to
women, such as Home Economics. "Outside" research tends to
focus on discipline-tied topics, topics that are trendy in the West or
appropriate case studies to prove a point in a particular ongoing
debate in the West.
The largest portion of social science research carried out on
women in Africa is by anthropologists. Books and articles that came
out in the decade 1960-1970 were mostly descriptive and focused on
women in relation to kinship, types of marriage, systems of in¬
heritance and types of production. Currently, and as a result of the
feminist movement, anthropologists, mostly women, have begun to
expose androcentrism in existing data, and, informed by a feminist
perspective^ to generate and reinterpret ethnographic data that
directly and indirectly relate to the status of women in society.
A large number of articles, conference papers and textbooks have
been concerned by the tendency, commonly known as "male bias"
in anthropology and the other social sciences. The current debate
revolves around the controversy about sociological versus biological
determinants of gender roles. The questions that most writers raise
seem to be: is male dominance universal? Was there a primitive
matriarchy and what cross-culturally accounts for variations in
women's status? There is no consensus on the critical issue of the
universality of female subordination although most anthropological
works by women and men assume some measure of subordination
for all human society past and present.
In spite of these differences in approach, long-standing male-
biased assumptions have been challenged. Most writings have con¬
vincingly demonstrated that there is no inherent natural connexion
between biologically determined sex differences and sexual hierar¬
chies. More importantly these studies have argued that what has
been taken to be natural and given is historically variable and
changeable.
The issue of power relations is the point of focus in the discussion i
and revolves around the control of production and distribution of I

y economic resources, rights to participate in or lead political, religious
activities, and autonomy regarding decisions about sex, marriage,
residence, divorce and children's lives.
Challenging previous assumptions these studies demonstrated
that the argument that women in hunting-gathering societies were
dominated by aggressive males, thus setting patterns for contem¬
porary sex roles, was false. Women participated in public decision¬
making in an egalitarian society in accord with their control over the
products of their labour. Their declining status accompanied the
privatization of their labour. Reinterpreting the relationship of sym¬
bolism to that of women's status, spirit possessions are believed to
be thinly disguised protest movements, that served as anti-male
outlets and provided small numbers of women with long-term posi¬
tions of high status. Food taboos reflect the symbolic expression of
sexual inequality as manifested by food prohibition and male control
of the forces of production.
Those who posit universal subordination of women mainly at¬
tribute it to the indirect result of child-bearing and child-rearing under
conditions of limited technology. Another side argues that child-
bearing and child-rearing did not prevent women from furnishing the
majority of foodstuffs among hunter-gatherers and "simple" hor-
ticulturalists and hence women's autonomy was undercut and
transformed due to colonialism and missionary influences. Another
trend within the group argues for "complementary but equal" status.
Women are to be valued for themselves and the contributions they
make to society. They are neither inferior nor superior to men, merely
different, and the ways women feel about themselves are the prime
determinants of women's experience. Recent debates focus on
analysing the division of labour, marriage relationships and suppor¬
ting male-oriented ideology as fundamental in reproducing the
subordination of women.
Sociological studies on African women show similar trends to the
anthropological ones. From being merely descriptive, they have gone
on to become slightly analytical and more critical of sexist assump¬
tions. Topics covered by sociological studies include social change
and its impact on the family, marriage and divorce, socialization,
education, migration, prostitution, occupational choice and occupa¬
tional mobility.
Economists focus on gainful employment, salary differentials and
occupational segregation. This type of research is at its nascent
stage quantitative and confirms the universal pattern of women's
concentration in the tertiary sector. Numerous studies have
documented women's participation in the "informal labour sector".
In spite of this special emphasis, much research cuts across fields
and variables.
The interdisciplinary nature of studies on African women in the
1970s is best exemplified by the type of research which has come to
be known as "Women and Development". While the details vary,
the main theme of these studies is that structural and historical pro¬
cesses have eroded women's power in men's favour. These pro¬
cesses include the territorial displacement of women through mar¬
riage from one group to another, religion, colonization, capitalism
and migration. Processes such as industrialization, modernization
and development, with their components of knowledge, new skills,
professions and resultant rewards are only accessible to men. Thus
the transformation of traditional economic organization has resulted
in an increased dichotomization of sex roles and concomitant sexual
inequalities.
In a review of a book entitled. Women and World Development
Ester Boserup wrote:
"It is a central theme in many of the papers that development had
a negative impact on women because foreign experts failed to
understand the position of women in traditional societies. Therefore
women have only rarely been involved in the development process,
be it as participants or as beneficiaries. The experts failed to assign
any roles for women in programmes of training for agricultural
modernization and in other development projects. This was probably
due to the experts' lack of awareness of the important contribution
which women are making in most traditional societies, especially in
rural areas."

### 41096: Asia: a kaleidoscope of cultures

Asia:
a kaleidoscope
of cultures
by Leela Dube
STUDIES of women in Asia and of programmes aimed at
elevating women's status have been handicapped by a general
lack of understanding of cross-cultural and intra-cultural
variations in the basic organization of societies and in the life con¬
texts of women.
Superficially similar situations may have radically different explana¬
tions and cannot be treated as identical. For example, the low levels
of literacy and education among females, the acceptance of lower
wages by women and the consequent preference of employers for
female labour, and the over-burdening with work of many women
appear to be common features of the condition of women in many
Asian countries. But the forces that bring these features into being
are not the same in each country.
With regard to the quality of relations between meri and women,
for example, Asia can be divided into three regions South Asia,
Southeast Asia and East Asia. In Southeast Asia, while familial con¬
trol over unmarried daughters may be fairly strict in Islamic countries,
women generally have a freedom of action and decision not found in
South and East Asia. While there are some patrilineal groups and
also a few matrilineal groups, the predominant pattern of kinship in
Southeast Asia is bilateral, with right of inheritance for women,
relative flexibility of marital residence and considerable in¬
terdependence between mothers and daughters. Another notable
feature of the societies in Southeast Asia is that their women do not
practice seclusion (Purdah) and, by and large, are not constrained by
a rigid segregation of the sexes.
The use of Western concepts and methodology has been most
pronounced in studies on the Philippines. The emphasis that some
research has given to sex-role differentiation and inequality of status
does not represent real conditions. In many situations, class and
economic differences are more significant than sex-based ones.
Women may have an egalitarian relationship with menfolk within the
family and in kinship networks and close social circles and yet may be
objects of exploitation in the outside world.
The interpretation and explanation of research data and statistics
may vary with the different methods used. Pre-determined
categories and equations as well as the use of hastily adopted com¬
mon denominators often distort the data and detach analysis from
the living contexts.
An apparent comparability of numbers does not necessarily in¬
dicate the existence of similar social patterns or conditions. For in¬
stance, the drop-out rate of schoolgirls in Thailand does not have the
same explanation as the drop-out rate for the same groups in India or
Afghanistan.
LEELA DUBE is director of the Indian Council of Social Sciences Research
and president of the commission on women of the International Union for
Anthropological and Ethnological Studies. A fuller treatment of the subject
of the present article will be published by Unesco's Office of the Regional
Adviser for the Social Sciences in Asia and Oceania, Bangkok.
Although in almost all countries certain categories
of jobs are considered specifically "masculine"
and others specifically "feminine", the kind of
work reserved for men and for women varies from
culture to culture. For example, whereas in many
countries building and construction are exclusive
to men and secretarial work is largely reserved for
women. In India women are often to be seen at
work on building sites and shorthand and typing is
a major form of employment for men. Also In
India, where pre-industrial spinning and weaving
were originally male tasks, the textile and clothing
industries have a large male labour force, in
contrast to the situation in western Europe where
the textile and clothing work force is
predominantly female. Social indicators
concerning the participation of women in the
labour force have, therefore, to be interpreted
with caution and are meaningless if not related to
the cultural context to which they refer.

The segregation and vigilance imposed on girls in India and
Afghanistan which are responsible for sexual disparities in school
enrolment and a high drop-out rate among girls are not a feature of
Thai society. Nor does the unequal allocation of scarce resources
have the same impact for Thai girls. Instead the pattern of life, in
which women have considerable rights but need to shoulder far
greater responsibility than men, has more relevance.
In demographic comparisons of female infant mortality Indonesia
fares worse than India; but in Indonesia infant mortality is higher
among males than among females. It would therefore be misleading
to compare female infant mortality in India with that in Indonesia
without reference to male infant mortality in the two countries.
A great deal of socio-cultural and historical data on Asian coun¬
tries has been provided by foreign scholars. But this information
needs to be carefully evaluated and the gaps in research filled. There
is a need for new data on the status of women to be collected and for
comparative studies within individual countries as well as between
different countries to be planned.

### 41098: Latin America: a twofold servitude?

Latin America:
a twofold servitude?
by Lourdes Arizpe
ANY social change, any evolution in established ways of
thinking, brings its attendant dangers. The past refuses to
die and intermingles with the present.
We Latin Americans possess what the Spanish writer Miguel de
Unamuno (1864-1936) called, in connexion with Spanish culture,
"the tragic sense of life". For a woman life is "a vale of tears", a
tragedy which can only be coped with if it is stoically accepted.
Anyone who needs convincing of this has only to listen to the
peasant women of Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala, or the women
of the shanty-towns and tenements of Caracas, Monterrey and Rio.
For them, life on earth is a matter of husband, children, pain and suf¬
fering; everything happens because it is "God's will". They have
every reason to think like this, since they possess no powers of deci¬
sion over their bodies, over their lives, over the lives of their children
and husbands, and over their community. Fatalism and lamentation
go hand in hand.
According to another analysis, Latin America suffers from the ef¬
fects of an economic and social system in which it is bound, on un¬
equal terms, to the great industrialized centres; meanwhile, this state
of dependence is exacerbated by the persistence of class interests
and internal ideological pressures. It would be wrong to say that
women's role in this process has been a marginal one; on the con¬
trary, it is their essential (though invisible) contribution to the
economy, their political passivity and their attitude of extreme
resignation which allow the situation to continue. And certain in¬
terests would like to preserve the advantages Which clearly stem
from the exploitation and oppression of women.
Our struggle has a single goal: to establish societies based neither
on injustice nor on exploitation. In dependent market economies
which create a pool of surplus labour, the occupational structure is
such that no salaried employment can be provided for women. Con¬
sequently, governments seek to encourage big families even if this
means a drop in living standards, with more people depending on a
single breadwinner. The woman's unpaid housework makes up for
the man's low wages. When even this arrangement is inadequate for
the maintenance of the family unit, the woman carries out a "double
work-day", usually finding ill-paid and unproductive casual work.
At this point the discussion about the family becomes more com¬
plex. Can we really destroy the family? Even in a socialist society like
that of Cuba, productive forces have not yet developed to the stage
which would permit the complete socialization of household work.
The first question to be asked is whether the double work-day in the
socialist countries (and in such countries as the United States where
more and more women are in paid employment) is an improvement
or a twofold servitude. In our countries, the fact that women remain
within the family sphere mitigates the very high levels of visible
unemployment and underemployment, but at what psychological
cost? Is the price not male chauvinism and its female counterpart, in
other words a man who needs to feel he dominates the situation in
face of a woman who will do all in her power not to lose him, since
without him she could not survive economically?
At the same time we need to analyse why Latin American women
feel less urgency than their European and North American sisters
when it comes to fighting for their emancipation. A key factor which
has been insufficiently studied is the existence of a pool of cheap
domestic labour which frees middle class women from the double
work-day and from the onus of looking after their children. I also
believe that another element in the situation is the fact that Catholic
Latin culture apportions to women two major spheres of influence.

"For Latin American women life is 'a vale of tears'... a
matter of husband, children, pain and suffering;
everything happens because it is 'God's will'. They have
every reason to think like this since they possess no
powers df decision over their bodies, over their lives, over
the lives of their children and husbands, and over their
community. Fatalism and lamentation go hand in hand.'
the family and the Church, in which they compensate for their
marginal position in political life. If this analysis is correct, the
feminists' insistence on giving women control over their body (by
limiting the birth-rate through contraception and abortion) and their
critique of the family would actually militate against the power of
women in Latin America. Seen from this standpoint, feminism
would weaken the position of women instead of liberating them,
confirming the belief of some Marxists that feminism is a strategy of
advanced capitalism designed to liberate working men and women
from family tasks.
If these processes are inevitable, it follows that instead of vainly
trying to hang on to privileges which history has accorded them and
is now taking away, Latin American women should not fear change
but should devise strategies which would enable them to find new
ways to participate in the political and economic life of tomorrow's
societies. And so it is vital for them to understand the experiences of
women both in the capitalist industrialized countries and in the
socialist countries. It is wrong to think that the conditions in which
these women live are of no concern to us. They do concern us
because they hold out the hope of possible alternatives for the
future. We possess the great historic opportunity of being able to
anticipate these changes and to channel them for our own benefit
and for the benefit of our society.

Through women's eye
Women on every continent are today joining in a dynamic movement of study and
research seeking to identify the obstacles to their full participation, on equal terms
with men, in the life and welfare of the communities to which they belong. Thanks
to this movement the real importance of women's economic role is now beginning
to be recognized. Photo shows a Peruvian Indian woman of the Andes.
