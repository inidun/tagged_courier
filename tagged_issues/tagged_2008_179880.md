### The ABC book: the only important book
The most fundamental challenge 
in the world today is poverty. I 
do not know of any major issue that 
is not connected to poverty and the 
increasing divide between those who 
have and those who are forced to 
look for food on the world’s rubbish 
dumps. 
This is also the case with AIDS. 
However, poverty is not an active 
virus. But the consequences of pov-
erty are in a profound way linked with 
AIDS and the increasing hardships it 
constitutes for the poorest countries 
of the world. 
The worst thing about poverty and 
the need that comes along with it 
is that so many of the problems 
involved are completely unneces-
sary. There is so much we could 
have prevented already and 
stopped yesterday – if we had had 
the will. We have the resources, 
we have the logistics. But still we 
live in the age of unnecessary 
problems. 
Let me now talk about illiteracy. 
It is a disgrace for the whole 
world that we in the year 2008 
have yet to eradicate illiteracy on 
our planet. Still millions of children 
are forced to enter life without know-
ing how to read and write. The fact 
that we deny so many children these 
elementary tools means that we 
render them defenseless on so many 
issues related to AIDS. How can we 
expect a young person who lacks the 
ability to understand written infor-
mation, who is unable to grasp the 
essence of vital knowledge, to pro-
tect her- or himself from becoming 
infected? Of course people talk, of 
course there is radio. There are also 
theatrical groups who travel the 
country to inform people. But the 
fact remains that we live in a world 
where the ability to read is necessary 
to acquire information.
It is important to see this connection. 
One of the most crucial instruments 
for controlling the proliferation of 
AIDS in the future must be to make 
sure that every child is given the right 
to learn how to read and write. 
Being a writer myself I know that 
there is only one symbolic book that 
truly matters: the ABC-book. Whether 
it is written in a book or on a compu-
ter screen does not really matter. 
Naturally, the fight against poverty is 
a war fought on many different levels 
simultaneously. And since we will be 
forced to make priorities I am con-
vinced that to teach people how to 
read and write is decisive. 
Poverty – AIDS – illiteracy. They all 
connect. And at least one of these 
issues we could have eradicated yes-
terday – illiteracy. 
We did not. 
Let us do it today.  
The ABC Book: The only imporTAnT Book
World famous novelist, winner of the Academy of Swedish Crime Writers prize (1991 
and 1995) and of the prestigious Litteris et Artibus award (2006), Henning Mankell has 
another less-publicized interest besides writing mysteries: health and education in Africa. 
The Swedish author, 60, divides his time between Europe and Africa and is the volunteer 
director of the “Teatro Avenida” in Maputo (Mozambique).  
All royalties from “I Die, but the Memory Lives on”, the book he published  
in 2004 (Random House UK Ltd), are donated to the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
Henning Mankell agreed to share his main concerns with our readers  
in this issue’s editorial, written specially for the UNESCO Courier.

### From literacy to lifelong learning
Six major conferences on literacy 
have been organized by UNESCO since 
March 2007, to determine strategies 
to reinforce the fight against illite-
racy. This pace is being maintained 
with the preparation of the next 
International Conference on Adult 
Education (CONFINTEA VI), which will 
be held in Brazil from 19 to 22 of 
May.
The last of the series of regional and sub-
regional literacy conferences, serving Latin 
America and the Caribbean, is taking place in 
Mexico City this month. It comes at the heel of 
the Doha (Qatar) conference for the Arab 
States, March 2007; Beijing (China) for East 
and Southeast Asia and for the Pacific, July – 
August 2007; Bamako (Mali) for Africa, in Sep-
tember 2007; Delhi (India) for South, Southeast 
and Central Asia, November 20007; and Baku 
(Azerbaijan) for East and Central Europe and 
the Caucasus, May 2008. 
These meetings follow the Conference on 
Global Literacy, organized by the White House 
in New York on 18 September 2006 under the 
aegis of Laura Bush within the framework of 
the United Nations Literacy Decade (2003-2012) 
and of UNESCO’s Literacy Initiative for 
Empowerment (Life, 2005 - 2015). 
Laura Bush, Honorary Ambassador for the 
United Nations’ Decade of Literacy, has set an 
example to other first ladies, ministers and 
UNESCO Goodwill Ambassadors who have fol-
lowed in the footsteps of the First Lady of the 
United States of America, leading increasingly 
vigorous campaigns in favour of literacy. 
But conferences are not enough, important 
though they may be. As Mark Richmond, Direc-
tor of the Division for the Coordination of 
United Nations Priorities in Education explains: 
“It is capital that follow-up actions be under-
taken in the aftermath of each conference.” 
Only measures that have a real impact on peo-
ple’s lives can contribute to sustainable human 
development and to poverty reduction. 
The theme of the forthcoming conference in 
Mexico - From Literacy to Lifelong Learning: 
Towards the Challenges of the 21st Century – 
blazes new trails. It will be matched by the 
first preparatory meeting for the next Interna-
tional Conference on Adult Education (CONFIN-
TEA VI). 
Since their beginning, in Denmark in 1949, the 
CONFINTEA conferences have been among 
UNESCO’s major initiatives concerning adult 
education and training, bringing together lea-
ders and experts: Canada (1960), Japan (1972), 
France (1985) and Germany (1997).  
Organized by UNESCO’s Institute for Lifelong 
Learning in Hamburg (Germany), CONFINTEA is 
an international forum for the promotion and 
development of strategies for non-formal lear-
ning and education for adults.

### H as in hygiene, O as in osteoporosis, A as in AIDS...
The project “Learning to read and 
write in good health”, launched 
in 2002 by the municipality of Curi-
tiba, capital of the state of Paraná, 
in southern Brazil, is bringing lite-
racy to adults in underprivileged 
neighbourhoods. The educational 
method combines alphabet and 
health: H as in Hygiene, O as in 
Osteoporosis, A as in AIDS… 
This fight against illiteracy in adults 
that goes hand in hand with promot-
ing their health is a result of the col-
laboration of two municipal sectors, 
Education and Health. Their experts 
produced photocopied lessons that 
they handed out to learners. They 
also set up a very simple mode of 
operation: volunteers sign up and 
undergo four hours of training, after 
being assigned to one of the city’s 
care centers. Since the launch of the 
programme, 163 volunteers have 
been trained in this way. 
h As in hygiene, o As in osTeoporosis,

A good idea, positive social 
impact, multiple benefits: 
the equation sums up the 
success of the programme 
«Alfabetizando com Saúde». 
It received the UNESCO 
International Reading 
Association Literacy Prize 
this year. Its founders 
had intended for it to 
last only a short time!

Fernanda Portela, 23, a student in 
chemical engineering, is one of them 
and has been a facilitator for several 
months. “I discovered I enjoyed 
doing it,” she explains, on her way to 
the class where 12 students are wait-
ing for her. “It’s fantastic, because I 
notice that all of them have already 
made progress.” 
Following the first stage of volunteer 
training, it is the task of the com-
munity agents to rally the popula-
tion concerned: people who can’t 
read. Bernadette de Sa, 63, mother 
of four and with four grandchildren, 
has been going to the Alvorada 
Center, where she recently learned 
the letters of the alphabet. 
Proud of her success, she says that 
now she can read the price and names 
of the products in her neighbourhood 
market, and she can even take the 
bus by herself – impossible for her 
until recently, because she couldn’t 
read the destination signs. 
She has also learned to pay attention 
to possible symptoms of illnesses 
people in her age group are prone to. 
“As well as learning, one can pass on 
the information to others, she says, 
describing herself as a “chatterbox” 
who like to spend time talking to 
friends and neighbours and uses the 
opportunity to share what she has 
learned in class. 
Literacy and lucidity
The number of students per class 
varies and the duration of the learn-
ing period depends on each person’s 
capacity to learn.  …

the first time the learner writes his 
own name.
The project is 
spreading to Africa
The project was launched in 2006 in 
Cabo Delgado in Mozambique. 
Brazilian experts were invited to 
develop two courses – one for teach-
ers and the other for students – with 
contents based on local epidemio-
logical data. 
In 2007, thanks to this partnership, 
30 teachers and 1200 literacy agents 
were trained. The programme 
“Alfabetizando com Saúde” has taken 
root in four Cabo Delgado districts. 
Luciano Ducci, now deputy mayor of 
Curitiba, was the head of the Health 
department when the programme was 
created. What’s special about it, in 
his view, is its ability to provide sig-
nificant benefits at little cost. “The 
founders’ wish is that the programme 
last only as long as it is needed to 
wipe out illiteracy,” he states. And it 
won’t need to last very long, in his 
opinion.  
the basis of the experiences and 
practical know-how of the learners 
themselves, taking into account their 
social position and worldview. 
A committee of experts is responsi-
ble for monitoring the progress of 
activities by visiting centres 
monthly. Among the programme’s 
greatest benefits can be cited 
improving the quality of life of learn-
ers and their families, disease pre-
vention, and boosting people’s 
self-esteem and reinforcing their 
sense of identity – notably when for 
… On the average, 400 people 
pass through some 30 city centres 
every year. In six years, more than 
2000 people have learned to read 
thanks to this method. Their ages 
range from 48 to 80. Consequently 
the health information is mainly 
focused on the chronic or acute dis-
eases that are most common at these 
ages. This year, 48 volunteers are 
working in 31 centres and 338 people 
are taking classes in Curitiba. 
Project coordinator Marisa Giacomini 
says enthusiastically “We have suc-
ceeded in bringing a large number of 
people out of the darkness of illiter-
acy.” Indeed, becoming literate is 
not only learning to read and write 
but also to look at the realities of 
life with greater lucidity. This is why 
many people are interested in the 
classes, simply to gain greater inde-
pendence: take a bus, write a little 
note to a distant relative, read the 
label of a medication or just read the 
Bible. 
The project is tailored to the adult 
learners’ needs. Volunteers work on

### Hope for a forgotten land
For Jabu Sithole, a trip to the 
clinic was nothing less than trau-
matic. The soft-spoken mother of 
five could not read or write and her 
illiteracy had a profound impact on 
her children’s health. 
“I have five children. Each child has 
a clinic card bearing his or her name. 
But if one of the children got sick, I 
did not know which card to take. I 
had to take the sick child and all five 
cards and ask the clinic sister to find 
the right one. The nurses laughed at 
me. I would delay taking my children 
to clinic because I was embarrassed 
and ashamed.” 
But after just three months of 
attending literacy classes, Jabu could 
recognise each child’s name – her life 
was beginning to change. Not only 
was Jabu learning to read and write, 
she was learning how to cope in a 
place called Kwanibela. 
Kwanibela is an isolated area deep in 
rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

One of the two UNESCO Confucius 
Prizes for Literacy was awarded 
this year to the NGO Operation 
Upgrade (South Africa) for its 
Kwanibela project. Its innovative 
methods have proven effective in 
promoting rural women’s literacy and 
empowerment. An example to follow.

50 kilometres away. No wonder some 
call it “God’s forgotten land”. 
For the past eight years there has 
been little rain. Aside from a lack of 
water, there is no electricity or 
phone lines, maize is considered a 
luxury and only 26 percent of the 
population is literate. 
Some people, usually men, leave 
their families and head for the big 
city in the hope of a job, while 
others try to eke out a living on the 
tribal land that is home to some 
26 000 people.
Reading brings 
nourishment
However, over the past four years, 
there has been a glimmer of hope. 
Jabu, and many others like her, have 
joined The Kwanibela Project, an 
adult literacy project run by a non-
governmental organization called 
Operation Upgrade, founded in 
1996. 
The new project, started in 2004, has 
had considerable impact on Kwanibela 
residents. It offers mother tongue, 
English and numeracy classes using 
interactive methods and theme-
based lessons, integrating such 
issues as HIV and AIDS. 
”Literacy classes must reflect the 
social context. So while English is an 
option for the learners, HIV and AIDS 
and food security are part of almost 
every lesson. You cannot be in a lit-
eracy class if you can’t feed your 
children,” says Pat Dean, director of 
Operation Upgrade and the Kwanibela 
Project. It’s this approach that has 
resulted in 28 classes, facilitated by 
18 educators and catering for over 
400 adult literacy learners. 
A major achievement of the project 
has been the establishment - by the 
learners themselves - of food tunnels 
using hydroponic methods. Every 
one of the 28 groups has a tunnel 
which not only offers some form of 
food security but also a source of 
income. In fact, so successful has it 
been that one of  …

 compare with driving into the area 
to start work: “Even though they 
cannot read `Operation Upgrade’ 
written on the car they know it’s us, 
and their warm welcome brings a 
smile to my face.”  
… the groups has been given a 
contract to supply spinach to a major 
South African supermarket group.
Fighting  
back against AIDS 
However, there are many challenges 
ahead, says training co-ordinator 
Itumeleng Petersen.: “It’s sad to see 
the men who come back from work-
ing in big towns like Johannesburg 
and Durban. Many are infected with 
HIV and they return to sometimes 
four or five wives. They infect them 
all. But through our work the women 
are learning to protect themselves 
and to access medication when they 
are infected.” 
AIDS education is a huge part of the 
project. The literacy educators are 
also trained to take the AIDS mes-
sage out to the community and incor-
porate it into their literacy lessons. 
The Kwanibela Project has even tack-
led the critical problem of water 
head on. Some learners have been 
provided with `hippos’ (a rolling 
device that makes water transporta-
tion easier) and others have had 
their homes fitted with rain water 
harvesting systems. 
Such is the commitment to the 
project that the majority of learners 
walk for hours to their literacy 
classes – it’s not uncommon to walk 
20 kilometres a day just to learn. But 
clearly the rewards far outweigh the 
efforts. Says Petersen, ”When they 
start stringing a sentence or two 
together you can see their eyes light 
up. To them it’s like striking gold.” 
Nomonde Diko, a Kwanibela Project 
trainer, adds that nothing can 
Kwanibela “pupils” have greenhouses that ensure food security and provide revenue.

governmental organisation providing 
non formal adult literacy education 
in rural areas. Undeterred by lack of 
conventional infrastructure, throngs 
of people are getting together in the 
shade of trees, with makeshif t 
 blackboards, to receive instruction 
and discuss issues of importance to 
the community, including HIV and 
AIDS. 
For the past eight years, PAF has 
preached literacy as reading not 
merely the word, but the world. 
Working with whole communities, 
especially with women and children, 
PAF’s approach is to help local groups 
realise that their development is not 
some abstract body’s responsibility, 
but their own. 
To this end, PAF applies an educa-
tional approach known as REFLECT, 
based on a method developed by 
Brazilian education expert Paulo 
Freire. It stresses dialogue and 
action, awareness-raising, coopera-
tion and empowerment. Adult learn-
ers explore development challenges 
and find ways to overcome them. The 
approach not only upholds the old 
African adage that two heads are 
better than one, but also borrows 
methods typical of an African vil-
lage. REFLECT takes place in “Circle” 
groups whose philosophy is that no 
one comes to the learning process 
empty handed. Facilitators are mem-
bers of the community who have 
received training. 
“It is one of the most effective par-
ticipatory approaches to adult learn-
ing for soc ial change and 
transformation,” explains PAF’s ener-
getic executive director Jennipher 
Chiwela. Prior to founding PAF, she 
spent over 20 years in the civil 
 service, rising to the position of 
Zambia Teaching Service Commission 
chairperson before retiring in 2003.
Theatre for raising 
awareness
Early on, PAF decided to pay particu-
lar attention to the crucial issue of 
HIV and AIDS, a major obstacle to 
any progress a community can make.

### Women are the future of mankind

Read, write  
and succeed
Women are the future of mankind, 
the saying goes. True, they run the 
household, raise the children and till 
the soil alongside their spouses. This 
is why ANFEAE made them the prior-
ity. The association addresses mainly 
women in Ethiopia’s more remote 
regions, stressing literacy and family 
planning. 
Before, families in Beke – a small 
community 56 km north of Addis 
Ababa, where ANFEAE established a 
centre for adults in 2003 – were very 
large, despite their meager incomes. 
In Ethiopia, notably in rural areas, 
having many children is considered 
genuine wealth, even without the 
means to raise them. 
Today in Beke, thanks to ANFEAE’s 
non-formal education programmes, 
20 women aged 28 to 65 have suc-
ceeded in finding their place in the 
economic system and thus become 
independent. They are gaining men’s 
“Before, we knew nothing about 
sheep, poultr y, dif ferent 
kinds of vegetables, and even less 
about family planning. It was ANFEAE 
who taught us all that,” explains 
Workenesh Getachew, a 39-year-old 
farmer and mother of six children. 
Since she signed up for the “Literacy 
Plus” programme, Workenesh earns 
as much as 300 birr a month (about 
US$30) selling eggs from imported 
hens (which lay more than local hens) 
as well as vegetables she grows in 
her kitchen garden with seeds pro-
vided by ANFEAE. This income sup-
plements earnings from the village’s 
annual grain harvest. It may seem a 
paltry sum, but her family is now able 
to make ends meet. 
Workenesh is even able to save 
money, instead of being completely 
dependent on her husband like 
before, as women in her village gen-
erally are. Though at first her hus-
band was hard to convince– he 
thought spending two hours in class 
twice a week was a waste of time!

respect with their learning. The asso-
ciation is bridging the gap left by 
the formal educational system. 
Founded in 1995 and operational 
since 1997, ANFEAE aims to educate 
the least privileged, mainly in rural 
areas. According to a survey con-
ducted by the Ethiopian Ministry of 
National Education in 2001, illiteracy 
concerns 30% of the population, 
living mostly in the countryside. 
Public spending on education 
increased by 26% in 2000-2001 to 
face the problem. And primary school 
enrolment increased from 61% in 
2001 to 68.4% in 2004. Enrolment of 
girls in the same period rose from 
41 to 59.1%. 
ANFEAE is active in only three regions 
within the country (Oromiya, Amhara 
and Gambella) but the “Literacy Plus” 
project is an undeniable success. “We 
have reached about 8000 adults in 
the country,” says NGO director 
Alemayehu Haily Gebre. According to 
a survey his group conducted of 3000 
women, out of the total of 6200 that 
took part  …

### Women are the future of mankind
African leaders to meet the develop-
ment goals they have set them-
selves. Education is crucial for 
integrating the new realit ies 
imposed by globalization, in order 
to understand them and develop an 
African adaptation. It is the essen-
tial tool African societies can use to 
stop the progress of HIV and AIDS, 
generate responses to global busi-
ness challenges and above all, win 
the fight against poverty. 
Yet despite efforts made in recent 
years, girls are those who suffer the 
most from exclusion in the tradi-
tional educational system, which is 
furthermore unable to meet the 
diversity of educational needs. Non-
formal education in this context 
represents a godsend. It provides 
customized solutions for a popula-
tion that is often deprived by the 
formal system’s failures and defi-
ciencies.  
Some former learners become teach-

Education for all in Africa, particu-

“Half of them, or 1500, increased 
their revenues by 25%,” he explains. 
He is proud of the results, though 
one concern remains: “Our goal was 
to enable these women to have 
access to microcredit, but NGOs are 
not allowed to engage in savings or 
lending activities.” 
“We have five centres and we can 
provide basic education, particularly 
to the poorest women,” the director 
adds. “We have also trained 1200 
civil servants in different districts 
and published 17 training manuals 
translated into four national 
languages.” 
Educational material is developed by 
a group consisting of teachers, 
learners and representatives from 
health and agriculture organizations. 
The training course lasts two years 
(300 hours of instruction in all) in 
classes of 25 participants, and costs 
a total of US$240,000, or less than 
US$40 per pupil. Funds come from 
USAID and SIDA via Pact Ethiopia, 
and the Addis Abeba World Bank 
Small Grant Programme as well as 
donations from ANFEAE members.

### The Return of the Aksum Obelisk
14
The inauguration ceremony for the 
Aksum Obelisk (or Stele 2 for the 
experts) coincides, give or take a 
few days, with the end of the second 
Ethiopian millennium. The year 2001 
begins on 12 September in Ethiopia, 
which still uses the Julian calendar 
replaced in the West by the Grego-
rian in the 16th century. The African 
Union has decided to make the new 
Ethiopian millennium a “millennium 
for all Africa”, in tribute to a country 
that was never colonized.
In March 2005, UNESCO announced to 
the world the return to Ethiopia of 
the Aksum Obelisk, in Rome since 
1937. Mussolini’s troops had found it 
lying on the ground, broken into 
three pieces, and hauled it back to 
the Italian capital. 
It took extensive negotiation to bring 
about the stele’s return, called for by 
the peace accords in 1947. The  largest 
aircraft in the world, the Antonov, 
had to be hired to transport the three 
enormous granite sections in three 
stages. The Aksum airport had to be 
modernized and two bridges rein-
forced for the convoy to reach its 
destination. Above all, what had to 
be ensured was that Stele 2’s reinstal-
lation would  …

The reTurn of The 
Aksum oBelisk  
Aksum, Ethiopian site listed as World 
Heritage since 1980, regains its status as a 
hub of African culture this month. A number 
of eminent personalities from culture and 
politics are converging on it - as they did at 
the beginning of our era when the Kingdom 
of Aksum rivalled Rome, Persia and China 
- to pay tribute not to a king, this time, 
but to an obelisk! The 24-metre, 152-ton 
monolith sculpted in Aksum 17 centuries 
ago, which has become a symbol of the 
Ethiopian people’s identity, has returned to 
its original home after 70 years of exile.

### The Return of the Aksum Obelisk
When the second block was placed 
within the tower on top of the first 
one, the synthetic fibres – Kevlar 
bars – were inserted in the new 
holes before the surfaces of the two 
blocks were sealed by a resin-based 
mortar. Same procedure for the third 
block. A technological feat, to say 
the least.
Ancestral grandeur
The scale of this operation led by 
UNESCO is reminiscent of its first 
world heritage safeguarding cam-
paign 50 years ago in Nubia. At that 
time, the Abu Simbel and Philae 
Egyptian temples were cut up into 
blocks and moved to a new location 
to avoid their being submerged after 
the construction of the great Aswan 
Dam. 
This latest project cost close to five 
million dollars, just for the studies 
and construction. The funding, also 
covering the dismantling of the obe-
lisk in Rome and its transport back to 
Aksum, is entirely provided by the 
Italian government. 
Aksum is thus recovering little by 
little its ancestral grandeur, lost 
for the first 1000 years of our era. 
The obelisk is majest ical ly 
enthroned in the middle of this 
little town, once the capital of an 
empire and a centre of Christianity. 
Aksum’s cultural wealth belies the 
town’s small size: a labyrinth of 
royal tombs, ruins of ancient pal-
aces likely to include the Queen of 
Sheba’s, ruins of 4th century 
churches…Aksum’s fabulous treas-
ures will be revealed in our next 
issue, devoted to the Ethiopian 
sites inscr ibed on the World 
Heritage List.  
Lattanzi for the reinstallation of the 
obelisk. It executed the engineering 
project designed by the Italian firm 
Croci Associati, in collaboration with 
Ethiopian experts, notably the 
archaeologist Tecle Hagos and the 
engineer Messele Haile Mariam. 
A platform with rails was installed, 
in order to slide the three pieces of 
the stele up to an immense steel 
structure, only one-tenth the size of 
the Eiffel Tower but equally impres-
sive. Using a hemispheric hinge and 
a mobile crane, the first block was 
hauled up the tower then dropped 
inside it, on top of its new eight-
met re re inforced conc rete 
foundation. 
“That way it won’t fall down again!” 
jokes the Italian technician Mauro 
Cristini, who emphasizes he’s no 
expert on “obelisk erec-
tion”. How’s that? He’s 
the head of the project 
team! “Have you seen 
many obelisks erected 
recently?” he says with 
a smile. True, the sub-
ject is no longer taught 
in schools. 
Much more seriously, he 
explains how each block 
is attached to the 
other: “At the end of 
the 1930s, the three 
parts of the stele were 
patched back together 
using metal bars 18 cm 
in diameter. This time 
we’ve added four perfo-
rations in each block 
that are only 5 cm in 
diameter, and inserted 
synthetic fibre bars to 
improve the stele’s seis-
mic resistance.” 
… not damage the archaeological 
site, which comprises a royal necrop-
olis from several pre-Christian dynas-
ties. (The UNESCO team carried out 
“non-destructive” remote sensing 
exploration that makes it possible to 
see what is underground without dig-
ging.) Finally, it was necessary to 
consolidate Stele 3, standing not far 
from its famous neighbour. Among 
the decorated monoliths in situ (most 
of them are not engraved), Stele 3 is 
the only one still standing. It leans 
slightly, however, like the Tower of 
Pisa.
A technological feat
In short, after two years of work, 
UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre 
signed an agreement in June 2007 
with the construction company 
Mauro Cristini, head of the technical team, responsible  
for the obelisk’s reinstallation.  © UNESCO/Jasmina Šopova

### The Return of the Aksum Obelisk
16
What an adventure!
The 2005 return of the Aksum Obelisk to its original 
site in northern Ethiopia is a highly symbolic event. 
Its reinstallation this summer (2008) is a genuine 
technical feat.
The second segment approaches the first. The techni-
cians insert the Kevlar bars in the new holes, to 
increase the stele’s seismic resistance.
Before and after: one of the metal bars (18 cm diam-
eter) inserted in the stele in the late 1930s, in Italy, 
and one of the new ones (5 cm diameter) made of syn-
thetic fibres inserted in Ethiopia.
A risky operation: temporary metal reinforcements 
used during the stele’s transport were replaced with 
new ones, making it possible to lift the granite blocks 
and place them inside the tower.
continued from page 9  … where HIV and AIDS is rife. 
In the course of counseling and test-
ing people, we realized that the 
major gap was ignorance, so we 
moved in with literacy programmes,” 
explains Chiwela. “Non-formal educa-
tion opens up the minds of communi-
ties to be more assertive.” 
PAF’s work to raise HIV and AIDS 
awareness, in cooperation with other 
organizations, includes not only train-
ing people to be community facilita-
tors but also teaching drama and 
performance skills to members of Anti-
AIDS Clubs, who then put on shows. 
Theatre is a way to get the locals, par-
ticularly young people, involved in 
spreading the message. While perform-
ances are going on, HIV and AIDS 
counseling, testing and information 
distribution also take place. 
“This approach has broken silence 
around sexuality and HIV and AIDS, 
dispelling myths and making way for 
communities to seek solutions to 
the numerous related problems,” 
says Chiwela. “And through learning 
basic and essential literacy skills, 
people come to understand the 
nature of this pandemic and share 
the messages of prevention, care 
and mitigation.”  

### Cesare Pavese: under the sign of Saturn
To celebrate the anniversary of his 
birth, the UNESCO Courier pays 
tribute to this writer, who belongs 
to the “Saturnian tribe”, those great 
melancholic artists, victims of incu-
rable wounds, making their way on 
the edge of madness and death. 
Born 9 September 1908 in Santo 
Stefano Belbo, in the Piedmont 
region, the poet committed suicide 
on 26 August 1950 in Turin. A short 
and mournful life, under the sign of 
Saturn. His deeply-rooted pessimism 
is easier to understand when we 
know he lost his father at the age of 
six and was brought up by a very 
strict mother. A colourless childhood 
between the authoritarian mother 
and an older sister he would never 
leave. Ancient pain: “There is on your 
face a silence that oppresses / the 
heart, dully, and distils an ancient 
pain / like the nectar of fruits fallen 
in those days.” (“Morning”) 
Cesare Pavese attended a Jesuit 
school in Turin. At university, he 
developed a passion for English lan-
guage literature, particularly poetry. 
In 1930, he undertook a thesis on 
the works of Walt Whitman. Bridging 
wide cultural gaps, he translated into 
his mother tongue the most demand-
ing Anglo-American authors, the 
likes of Herman Melville, John Dos 
Passos, Daniel Defoe, James Joyce or 
Landmarks
CesAre pAvese: unDer The sign of sATurn 
A man’s existence does not follow a straight line; it is accelerator and brake, suspense 
and motion. It is as fragile and shifting as mirages in the desert. The life of novelist, 
translator and poet Cesare Pavese, entirely devoted to literature, is no exception.

Djiboutian author 
Charles Dickens. In 1930 he became 
very naturally an English teacher.
His era’s bad 
conscience
Italy at the time was in the throes of 
reactionary ecstasy. Members of his 
family pushed him into the clutches 
of the National Fascist Party, of 
which he was a member between 
1932 and 1935. Yet the poet’s little 
clay lamp did not go out in the tur-
moil. On the contrary. Not content to 
be merely his era’s bad conscience, 
as another poet of high lineage, the 
Frenchman Saint-John Perse, had 
predicted, he turned to concrete 
action. He was arrested in 1935 for 
anti-Fascist activities linked to the 
political movement Giustizia e Libertà 
founded in Paris in 1929 by a mili-
tant anti-Fascist group. Expelled 
from the party, Pavese was exiled in 
Calabria for eight months. His first 
collection of poems (“Work’s Tiring”) 
dates from this period: a sort of 
subtle autobiography where silence 
is rich with various echoes. Obscure 
and ancestral earthly passions sur-
face here and there: “The silence for-
ever / is quiet, calm and hoarse in 
past memory.” (“The Voice”) 
The spirit of the past is never far 
away. “A day will come when the 
young god will be a man / Without 
suffering, with the dead smile / of 
the man who has understood. The 
sun too glides in the distance / red-
dening the beaches. A day will come 
when the god will no longer know 
where were yesterday’s beaches…”

every trouble or pain. That’s what 
terrifies me: suicide is my principle, 
never consummated, that I will never 
consummate, but which soothes my 
sensibility.” 
The writer from Turin belongs, with 
Friedrich Nietzche, Walter Benjamin 
and a number of others, to the 
“Saturnian tribe”- those great melan-
cholic artists, exceptionally gifted, 
victims of incurable wounds from 
childhood, making their way on the 
edge of madness and death. 
Cesare Pavese was certainly one of 
the most influential and talked-about 
post-war authors. In turn poet, nov-
elist, critic, magazine editor, talent 
scout, cultural go-between and pub-
lisher, he spent his life in the service 
of literature. Real life and theoretical 
issues are never disassociated. The 
first task is living, of course. Sealed 
by failure, denied glory, it becomes 
all the more fascinating.  
Death  
will have  
your eyes
A moody, solitary and 
tormented soul, Pavese 
thought he had finally 
found the love of his life 
in Constance Dowling, 
American actress he met 
in Rome, only a few 
weeks before she aban-
doned him. The height 
of despair: the poet 
committed suicide in a 
Turin hotel room with an 
overdose of sleeping 
pills during the night of 
26-27 August 1950, 
when his fame had 
reached its peak. He left 
on his work table the 
poems that today constitute his last 
– and most acclaimed – collection of 
poems: “Death will come and it will 
have your eyes”. Suicide, for most a 
final act of desperation, had been for 
him an obsession, a magnet, almost 
a companion. In 1936, fourteen years 
before he killed himself, he confessed 
in his diary: “And I know I am 
doomed forever to think of suicide at 
… In 1939, he wrote his first 
prose text, “The Fine Summer”, pub-
lished only ten years later in a volume 
including two other novellas, “The 
Devil on the Hills” and “Women on 
Their Own”. They are, in the author’s 
own words, “Three urban stories, 
three stories about discovering the 
city and society, three stories of 
juvenile enthusiasm and disappointed 
passion.” The third novella was 
turned into a film in 1955 by 
Michelangelo Antonioni, entitled Le 
Amiche. 
Disappointment is a theme that runs 
throughout his work. The late 1930s, 
experienced as an artistic and psy-
chological crisis, also mark the start 
of his “new meditations on his work”, 
springing from the same soil as his 
personal diaries, “The business of 
living”, found and published after his 
death. 
Following World War II, Pavese joined 
the Italian Communist party. He 
worked for the Einaudi publishing 
house while continuing his writing 
career. In 1949 he published the 
novel “The Moon and the Bonfires”, 
which won him the prestigious Strega 
prize.
