UNESCO'S 6TH GENERAL CONFERENCE
We work for tomorrow, but tomorrow
begins todayH
,'I T is for tomorrow that we
are working, but tomor-
row begins today."Under
this emblem of urgency, the offi-
cial government representatives
of 59 nations will gather together
in Paris from June 18 to July 12
to decide on Unesco's course of
action for the months to come.
This is the sixth time that de-
legates will be meeting at a
Unesco General Conference. But
1951 is a critical year in which
threats of war call more than
ever before for co-operative
international effcrt to help con-
struct and guard intact the living
fabric of world peace.
Conscious of these pressing re-
quirements, the Executive Board
of Unesco has drawn up a new
draft programme for submission
to the General Conference. It is
a programme conceived not in
terms of Unesco's theoretical po-
tentialities but in the light of the
practical experience of trial and
searching gained in recent years.
It is a programme that has been
scaled down to permit concen-
tration on a number of major
practical problems facing the
peoples of the world today in
education, science and culture.
(The 1951 programme contained
294 resolutions ; the new draft
programme has reduced these by
50 per cent.)
Ignorance is one of the deep-
lying causes of conflict and war.
Lack of fundamental knowledge
for living breeds poverty, disease,
under-nourishment and with these
despair and violence. Perhaps
the boldest and most far-reaching
new proposal to be placed before
delegates at the 6th General Con-
ference will be a special $20 mil-
lion, 12-year project for launching
a world-wide campaign against
ignorance and low standards of
living. It has been called"the
great campaign of men against
their common enemy". (For de-
tails see pages 6 to 11 of this
issue.)
Enemies of the fundamental
rights of men and women must
resort to oppression which ultim-
ately results in friction and con-
nict. The widest of the central
themes running through the pro-
posed 1952 programme is there-
fore action in the service of Hu-
man Rights. Thus, for example,
the conference will be asked to
approve new plans first for mak-
ing these rights more widely
known and understood by the
peoples of the world. Specific
projects, too, will be considered
for studying methods of reducing
racial discrimination ; for an
agreement to lift barriers to the
free movement between countries
of persons travelling for educ-
ational, scientific and cultural pur-
poses ; and for promoting the
effective application of free and
compulsory education as set forth
in Article 26 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
Three groups of peoples have a
special claim to attention in the
modern world. They are the
workers, women and young peo-
pIe ; and special efforts on their
behalf dominate the proposed
Unesco programme for 1952.
To take one example, the many
problems of men and women
workers are the focal point of the
new adult education programme.
One project calls for the establish-
ment in 1952 of an international
centre for improving workers'
educational methods and for
training specialists in this field.
The proposed centre which is to
be set up in co-operation with
international trade unions, will
also organize courses for workers,
laying special stress on under-
standing among peoples of the
world and the necessity of inter-
national co-operation within the
framework of the United Nations.
In addition, Unesco has been
working on a broad programme
for extending fellowship and tra-
vel opportunities for workers. In
1952 individual and group travel
grants for them to study abroad
are to he arranged through work-
ers'organizations in different
countries.
In the same way as for workers,
the 1952 programme includes
fellowship projects specially de-
signed for young persons, and
programmes in every department
of Unesco for practical work to be
done by young people, outside of
school, through youth movements,
voluntary work camps, science
clubs, etc.
Working for the improvement
of the status of women, Unesco
will accentuate in 1952 ways of
providing them with greater
access to education and practical
suggestions for the education of
women everywhere for world
citizen-ship.
The above examples are in-
tended to convey only an idea of
some of the practical themes
which Unesco proposes to develop
in 1952. There are of course
others which are equally im-
portant and urgent. No mention,
for example, has been-made of the
technical assistance plan for eco-
nomic development in which
Unesco is already providing and
will continue to provide practical
help to remedy inequalities of
opportunity and means in educ-
ation, science and culture, which
today hamper under-developed
countries. Mention should he
made, too, of projects proposed
for 1952 for increasing Unesco's
campaign to teach and explain the
principles of collective security
and the contribution of the
United Nations to peace.
In general, it can be said that
in the 1952 programme to be sub-
mitted this month for approval by
the General Conference, projects
of academic interest have been
sacrificed to those which have a
direct or indirect effect upon
present-day world problems and
the programme has been given
more practical direction through-
out.

### 73556: Television explains science to 15,000,000 Americans

JUNE 1951 Page 3-UNESCO COURIER
TELEVISION EXPLAINS SCIENCE
TO 15, 000, 000 AMERICANS
THREE years ago a group of us at
the Johns Hopkins University
put the finishing touches on a
plan originally conceived in 1946.
We were about to televise a science
programme which would carry scienti-
fic demonstrations to the few Balti-
moreans who owned television sets in
March, 1948.
That first programme, carried by the
newly-erected station WMAR-TV was
the beginning of The Johns Hopkins
Science Review, a weekly half-hour
showing of current developments in
many fields of science. It was one
of the first programmes televised by
an American university on a regular
weekly schedule. It is the only one
today which can be viewed by more
than 15, 000, 000 people in many cities
on a network.
On that day in 1948, Professor
Franco Rassetti, once the colleague of
atomic physicist Enrico Fermi in Italy,
stepped before the television cameras,
set up on the Hopkins campus, to
demonstrate a few fundamental facts
about nuclear physics.
That first experiment with television
as an educational medium went almost
unnoticed. But we had faith in our
belief that the public should be infor-
med about developments in science,
that the public is eager for such infor-
mation. We were confident then that
our programme would one day serve
the entire United States. Today, we
hope that it will prove to be another
link in the chain between the family
of nations welded together in Unesco.
Since March, 1948, the Science Re-
view has grown in quality, and has
won national recognition. Each Tues-
day night from September to June, the
programme originates in the studios of
WAAM, Baltimore, and is carried over
the DuMont Network as far west as
Chicago.
First Need-Simplicity
LOOKING back today on the wintert debut of the Science Revie , we
realize how little we knew about
the technical and production problems
of the infant medium. There were no
books or treatises on the techniques
of telecasting scientific demonstrations.
This was fortunate, perhaps, in that
it meant meeting the challenge and
learning for ourselves, doing the basic
research on television programming of
this type.
All through the initial stages of The
Johns Hopkins Science Review, we
struggled with important problems of
presentation : How to impart scienti-
fic information in such a manner that
it would be understandable to the lay-
audience. This audience knew little
about science, therefore the pro-
grammes had to be simple. Yet we
could not insult our viewers by talking
down to them, treating them as unedu-
cated children.
We have delved into many realms of
science, each one presenting its own
special television problem. How, for
instance, to show viewers seated com-
fortably at home the spectacle of mi-
cro-organisms darting about in pollut-
ed water ? This we had to do in
order to present a programme on sani-
tary engineering.
At another time, hours were spent
working out the mechanics of stimu-
lating the path of air waves as they
struck the wings 01
planes in night at
supersonic speeds.
Otherwise, the average
viewer could not fa-
thom the latest de-
velopments in aero-
nautics, developments heralding the
passenger flights of tomorrow.
Televising A Heart
WE learned early at Hopkins thatwe must simplify the language
of the scientists who are the
principal performers on the Science
Review. Wherever possible, we substi-
tute a simple synonym for a technical
word unfamiliar to viewers.
By relating the facts to the viewer's
daily life, one can select intricate,
even nebulous, scientific experiments
and explain them in a manner in-
tensely interesting to the layman.
Gradually, a format has evolved
wherein verbal explanations comprise
a mere background accompaniment for
visual demonstrations. OUr cardinal
rule :"If you can't show it, don't talk
about it for more than a minute."
This rule is responsible in large part
for the Science Review's rapid pace,
for holding its viewers from week to
week, and for consistently enlarging
its audience.
A Science Review programme on X-
Rays can be cited as an example. The
theme was the introduction of a revo-
lutionary new X-ray machine deve-
loped by Dr. Russell H. Morgan, of the
Johns Hopkins Hospital. The machine
enables the diagnostician to peer into
the interior of a patient and watch his
organs in action, without having to
adapt his eyes to the conventional
Quoroscope.
The moderator introduced the
theme. The"old-fashioned"fluoro-
by Lynn Poole
scope was demonstrated on a white-
robed patient. An ordinary X-ray
machine taking a negative was shown,with viewers watching
the negative on a view-
box and hearing a
discussion of its ad-
vantages and draw-
backs. Then the new
X-ray machine was... u ;-..... <tho 011 ; ðT'l"'. o. f,..introduced, allowing the audience to
see a patient's heart beating. The
climax was reached when the cameras
showed an injured factory worker
who had been brought to the hospital
with steel splinters in his chest.
Telephone lines brought in the voices
of a doctor in Chicago, another in
New York. As they consulted with
physicians in Baltimore, the men in
Chicago and New York were sitting
before television screens viewing the
patient's chest cavity.
Aeronautics To Zoology
THE programme has given viewersan opportunity to look over the
shoulders of many men of science
and to see and understand current
investigations in every realm of
science, from aeronautics to zoology.
Two questions are often asked of
Johns Hopkins personnel : Why are
you expending nearly 200 man hours
each week on this programme ? How
are you able to present this pro-
gramme on a television network ?
To the first question, we answer :
We believe we have a duty to our
public to utilize this new medium to
disseminate knowledge beyond the con-
fines of classroom and campus. The
swift development of science in the
past 25 years has been confusing to
many people. By presenting science
programmes, explaining current deve-
lopments, and showing how these
developments affect us individually, we
believe we can eliminate some of the
confusion, allay many of the fears.
It is a pleasure to answer the second
question. We are able to present the
Science Review on a network because
of the magnificent co-operation by the
University, television station WAAM,
and the DuMont Network. A staff
of two at Hopkins prepares and writes
each programme, and secures the
demonstration equipment as well as
the scientists who perform the de-
monstration.
Station WAAM furnishes studio
space, a producer free of charge to
work with the University staff, and all
studio facilities. DuMont provides the
network transmission without cost to
Johns Hopkins. Both WAAM and
DuMont provide these facilities as part
of their public service commitment
to the people of the United States.
In addition, the University offers the
only U. S. award for the best original
half-hour television drama each year,
in the hope that Hopkins might play
its part in encouraging original think-
ing and writing in the television field.
This writer envisages the day when
filmed recordings of educational pro-
grammes can be exchanged between
Unesco member nations. These
recordings, known as kinescopes or
teletranscriptions in the United States,
can be televised for the edification of
peoples throughout the world.
It is further hoped that those inte-
rested in, and responsible for, educa-
tional television in Unesco member
countries will meet to exchange ideas
and problems-to aim at eventual co-
ordination for the use of television as
an instrument of understanding among
the free nations of the world.

The genius of mon has offered us the

of a catastrophe which could destroy all
progress and plunge our world into a new

age of darkness.
Is it surprising, therefore. that we long
for a We free from fear ? For we realize
today more than ever that this is the
primary need of all people. and that
security which is-a condition for freedom
from fear is the goal towards which we all
must work.
But how are we to succeed in our search
for security ? Not. as two world wars in
less than half a century have shown,
through the rule of force. For what
meaning would victory have in the face
of the devastatíon wrought by the
terrifying perfection of modern arma-
ments ?
The simple fact is that peace must be
based on international law or there will
be no true and lasting peace. Has not
history shown us the path of collective
action which has spread from family to
tribe, from city to province, then from
nation to nation, until entire continents
could live under the rule of law? ? It is
for us to extend Us sway over at the
world. To retreat would be to admit that
disaster is inevitable, or rather, to render
it so by our own actions.
Collective security is not a dream ; it
exists. It exists as a living reality ; il
exists in the United Nations which
was established by the co-operative effort
of the sovereign nations of the world and
it possesses the means to enforce respect
for international law when it is violated.
It is true that the prestige of the United
Nations has not in itself heen enough to
discourage all attempts at conquest.
Thus, exactly one year ago this month
and barely five years after the cease-fire
of the last war, the world was suddenly
faced with an act of aggression in Korea.
In the early days of the invasion of
South Korea, following the refusal of North
Korea to withdraw its troops, the Security
Council of the United Nations on June 27
1950 recommended to its members that
they "furnish such assistance to the

War would rescue for the peace at least a
fraction of the mutual goodwill and
readiness to co-operate which made them
victorious. That assumption has proved
to be over-optimistic. Yet there was also
a second assumption, equally fundamen-
tal : that the United Nations must collapse
as soon as the peace is broken or
seriously threatened by a Great Power.
That assumption has proved to be over-
pessimistic. Peace has been overtly
broken. Yet the system has survived the
severe shock of the open breach. The
United Nations system will work in the
long run and, given sufficient moral
cohesion among the majority of Member
States, is cqpable even in the short-run of
curing the present ill-effects of its
imperfect implementation."
Peace is an unending creation. When
the United Nation$ decided to reinforce
measures for collective security contained
in its Charter and through united action
to reinforce fundamental conditions to
peace, it was looking far beyond the
present crisis.
"Enduring peace", read the General
Assembly's resolution, "will not be
secured solely by collective security
arrangements against breaches of inter-
national peace and acts of aggression."
Member States were therefore urged"to
respect fully. and to intensify joint action,
in co-operation with the United Nations'.
In other words, in order to prevent
aggression. Member States were asked
"to develop and stimulate universal
respect for and observance of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and to
intensify individual and collective efforts
to achieve conditions of economic stability
and social progress".
"Collective security is both a material
condition springing from a given social
order and a moral one emanating from the
collective members of that same order."
This statement, made by Professor
Georges Scelle, sums up the fundamental'
questions on which depend the future of
humanity.
Real peace is won by victories over
ignorance, misery and ineauality, for it
can only exist in a world community in
which all members are able to achieve
their rightful places as free men and to
develop their ways of life peacably.
The war against wars continues. In
times of crisis, when international force is
needed to prevent aggression, it must be
fought with arms in hand.'But. at all
times it must be wage untiringly in
men's minds, and this is Unesco's mission
on the three fronts of knowledge, solidarity
and international citizenship.

Republic of Korea as may be necessary
to repel the armed attack and to restore
international peace and security in the
area."By the following month. 48 states
had responded, some pledging military
aid, others economic or medical assistance.
cor the past majority of countries realized
that peace is indivisible. that an act of
aggression anywhere in the world is a
threat to the whole world.
To this international action Unesco gave
its full support within the framework of its
competence. In August, in answer to the
appeal of the Economic cmd Social
Council, the Executive Board of Unesco
decided to take steps to fulfil the
"constructive role called for by the
United Nations. Unesco is prepared to
carry out educational assistance in Korea
and is ready to co-operate with the United
Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency in
the eventual reconstruction of the
country's educational facilities, as soon as
it is called upon to do so by the Unified
Command. Unesco has already had wide
experience in such work during the past
five years in countries devastated by the
second world war.
Unesco has yet another task to fulfil in
the field of education. It is to explain and
make widely known the principles of
collective security as the indispensable
condition of peace under law. Unesco is
therefore carrying out a special educa-
tional programme which includes the
preparation of pamphlets, wall charts and
other written and visual materials on the
question of collective securiiy. Produced
in different languages, these are being
distributed in Unesco's Member States for
use by schools. universities, and adult
education groups. The wall-charts.
designed and produced by the Bureau
of Current Affairs in the United Kingdom,
form a compact and colourful unit for
display in school classrooms, community
centres, youth clubs and factories. Three
studies on the subject of collective
security directed primarily to people at
the college and university level have been
commissioned from Dr. Andrew Martin,
international lawyer and lecturer at
Ruskin College, Oxford : Prof. Georges
Scelle of the University of Paris : and
H. E. Antonio Castro LeaL head of the
Mexican delegation to Unesco. They
explain the meaning of collective security
in the light of the United Nations action
which Unesco hopes will help create a
powerful and enlightened force of public
opinion in support of the world
organization.
Dr. Martin puts the essential problem like
this :"Our present system of collective
security was built on the assumption that
the principal allies of the second World

13, 000 carats of pure diamonds, further
on the frigate Lutine with her gold
lingots, or the Orient with the wealth
of the Knights of Malta. Elsewhere
are the galleons of Philip II or the
galleys of Caligula. This map re-
minds me of the day in 1934 when,
aboard the little Italian cargo boat
Artiglio. I saw the first dredger
bucket opened, revealing the gold
sovereigns which had just been taken
from the shattered hull of the steam-
ship Egypt.
Until a few years ago, it was the
hope of making money that led
sailors to carry out salvage operations.
Such treasure hunters needed only a
little more audacity and physical
endurance than those prospecting for
gold in Alaska.
Now a band of newcomers have
joined the wreck-hunters on the sea-
bed-a handful of men who are not
motivated by thought of personal
gain. In fact, I think their research
costs more than they get in return.
These men, who are inspired solely
by their concern for history and
science, are the underwater archaeo-
logists.
Underwater archaeology, a new
science which still needs definition as
well as organization, owes its exist-
ence to a new diving technique, made
possible by a self-contained diving
suit. Following the pioneer work of
Commandant Le Prieur, this suit was
perfected by Commandant Cousteau
of the French Navy, and a French
engineer named Gagnan.
Clues To History
TOURING the past 15 years, his-torians have left their libraries,
and biologists their laborat-
ories, to don diving suits and carry
out methodical investigations off the
shores of the Mediterranean. Some-
times, because of technical difficulties,
governments have called in profes-
sional divers-and their reward
comes when some remarkable object
is brought to the surface. There
was, for instance, the famous bronze
statue of Zeus of Artemision which,
thanks to the Greek Government,
was brought up on the shores of
Greece, where it had lain since the
fifth century before Christ.
The uniniated wrongly imagine that
the underwater archaeologists have
only one aim-to recover artistic
treasures hidden in the Mediterranean.
The great Middle Sea, which was the
scene of an intense maritime trade
in ancient times, hides mainly relics
- wrecks and various objects-
whose shape and location provide
clues to important historical facts, as
well as enabling techniques of a new
science to be evolved. True archaeo-
logy-whether terrestial or under-
water-does not aim at pillaging the
past, but at studying and reconstruct-
ing it. Certain oustanding findings
have recently been totally destroyed
by the depradation of amateurs, and
there is, therefore, an urgent need
for underwater relics to be protected
by law in the same way as historic
sites and monuments on the ground.
M. Philippe Diole, one of the pro-
moters of underwater archaeology
and certainly its greatest authority,.
has urged that these discoveries should
be treated with respect in their proper
surroundings. Underwater archaeo-
logy should not entail the breaking
up of articles with the sole aim of
raising them to the surface, re-
constituting them, and making them
museum pieces. First of all it is
necessary to study them closely
where they are found, to clear the
sites and to photograph the objects,
preferably before handling them.
An Emp : re's"Junk"
'-r'HE"materials"awaiting searchersare of two kinds. Wrecks are
the most usual, but there is also
a multitude of objects which people,
in all eras, have got rid of by throwing
away into harbours. These are objects
which, after the mud protecting them
has been cleaned off, constitute the
most interesting materials for study,
and which provide experts with real
"archaeological layers".
Among the wrecks, two have for
long attracted the interest of divers :
the Anthéor and the Albenga, dis-
covered by members of the Club
Alpin Sous-Marin off the Italian
coast. Both contain large numbers
of jars, not of marble, as has been,
said, but pottery made of common
clay, which in Roman times preceded
the cask-a Gallic invention. This
shows that the Anthéor and the
Albenga were not therefore galleys,
as has been claimed, but cargo boats
bringing food to the Roman capital.
When one thinks of the many
African ports which were used by the
Roman feet, and the number and
variety of objects thrown into the
water by seamen or port-dwellers, one
gets an idea of the task still to be
undertaken.
In any case, underwater archaeology
has already proved its efficacy with
the French excavations at Fos-sur-
Mer where divers had to work with
pickaxes to get to the newly-discover-
ed relics. Ceramics found under the
sea-bed enabled them to fix-as
archaeologists and historians had
never been able to do-the date of
the foundation of the city by Marius :
the end of the second or the beginning
of the first century before Christ.
Similarly, the team of divers led by
Father Poidebard, after exploring the
waters of Tyre and Sidon, were able
to trace accurately the plan of these
ancient ports.
There are many legends which tell
of cities under the sea. The old fisher-
man of Douarnenez, for example,
claim that at certain tides one can
see the ruined walls of the proud city
of Ys which, the story goes, sank
below the waves off the Brittany
coast.
Though such stories may belong to
the realms of fancy, traces of other
cities have actually been found. Near
Hyeres, for example, the divers of the
Cannes Club discovered the under-
water relics of a former Greco-Roman
colony, similar to those of Vercura-
num, near the town of St. Honorat.
At Olbia, a. town which digging
operations had already partly revealed,
other divers brought to light part of
a stone jetty and other constructional
remains.
The new science of underwater ar-
chaeology is still in the early pioneer
stage. It lacks followers-not scientists,
as such, but scientist-divers. This is
a vocation which will not take long
to capture the imagination of youth,
and it is to be hoped that soon new
teams will go to the bottom of the sea
to help the development of this new
field of scientific investigation.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 6 JUNE 1951
MORE than half the people of the world are illiterate. This means that
one thousand million men and women can neither read nor write.
More than alf the people of the world are also desperately poor.
Their earnings are sc low that their daily diet is barely enough to keep
them alive. In the countries of Asia and Africa, where illiteracy is most
prevalent, a child at birth can expect to live no more than thirty years, while
in the countries of Western Europe, where a high proportion of the people are
able to read and write, a child can expect to live 55 or more years.
Illiteracy is part of a tragic circle of underproduction, malnutrition and
endemic disease.
The circle cannot be broken by an attack on only one of these elements.
It is useless to concentrate on improving health if inefficient farming methods
and soil erosion are left unchecked and entire populations remain under-
nourished. It is equally useless to teach people to read and write unless they
have an incentive to learn and use this knowledge. The only satisfactory
incentive is an improvement in their daily lives. Nor can agricultural pro-
duction be raised if disease and ignorance keep the people who work the land
in a condition of physical and mental inertia.
These problems are too complex for traditional schoolroom methods used
to teach children. They are problems a1Iecting all sections of the population
- children and adults, women as well as men-and they demand a much
broader approach by the educator.
Unesco's Greatest Challenge
DURING recent years, many people have taken such an approach in theWorld's underdev loped regions. They have called their work by various
names, such as"mass education","basic education","cultural missions",
and"community development". Unesco which, since its foundation, has con-
sidered these problems to be its major challenge, uses the term"fundamental
education".
The main purpose of fundamental education is to help people to understand
their immediate problems and to give them the skills to solve them through
their own e1Iorts. It is an emergency solution designed to help masses of
illiterate adults and children in countries whose educational facilities have
been inadequate. It is an attempt to salvage a generation by giving it the
minimum of education needed to improve its way of life, its health, its pro-
ductivity and its social, economic and political organization.
Until 1950, Unesco's fundamental education work, because of a limited
budget, was experimental. The experiments, however, repeatedly produced the
same conclusions, no matter where they were conducted.
Fundamental education cannot hope to achieve tangible results without
men and materials ; that is, without qualified workers and effective educational
materials specifically designed for its task.
Neither, at present, is available. The demand for primers in Creole or
agricultural manuals in Sesuto is not great enough to attract private capital
to the long job of research required to produce them. Teachers'training
schools ordinarily do not require their graduates to be able to teach reading in
one class and contour farming in the next.
If each individual country were to attempt this job, the overall cost would
be staggering, and an inevitable waste of money and manpower would result.
Experiments showed that a pooling of resources at regional levels was needed.
Unesco has now put forward a plan
to aid its Member States by helping
to train fundamental education workers
and by developing samples of the teaching
materials they need. This plan is in-
tended to operate as a twelve-year pro-
gramme in which a world network of six
production and training centres will be
established in five regions-Latin America,
Equatorial Africa, the Middle East, India
and the Far East (where two centres will be
set up). The plan, approved by the
Executive Board of Unesco, will be laid
before the General Conference this month.
Teachers of Teachers
THE goal of this programme is to trainsome 5. 000 fundament l education spe-
cialists. These graduates, in turn, will
staff similar training centres organized on
national and local lines. It is these latter
centres which will train the teachers who
will work in the field.
Under Unesco's plan. each centre will
be equipped to handle two classes of 100
students each year. These students will be
selected by their governments and sent to
the centre in their region not as individuals
but as teams. A typical team studying at a
centre might include an adult educator, a
sanitary engineer, a nurse, a rural school-
teacher and an agricultural expert.
Some of the students at the centre will
have been already trained in their own spe-
cialties under the guidance of three other
United Nations agencies-the Food and
Agriculture Organization, the International
Labour Organization and the World Health
Organization. They will come to the
Unesco centres to learn how to put their
technical knowledge to work in underdeveloped regions through fundamental
education techniques.
The course of study planned for these students will cover twenty-one
months. At first, there will be an intensive nine month training period
and then, after a one-month vacation, two months of"on-the-job train-
ing"at institutions conducting fundamental education work. The course ends
with five months of practical field work as teams in the vicinity of the centres,
one month of vacation and a three-month refresher course at the centre.
use Of Films And Radio
A TYPICAL centre in operation will be organized to perform a four-foldtask ; that is, research, pr duction of educational materials, teachers'
training, and aid to fundamental education activities in its region.
These functions will be carried out by three departments. The first, in
charge of research, will determine the specific fundamental education needs of
the region in which the centre operates and the methods required to meet
them. The second, or production department, will be responsible for deve-
loping sample textbooks, films, filmstrips, wall charts and other materials
needed in fundamental education. Too often today, these materials are either
not available, or they are unsuitable. The adult illiterate cannot be taught,
with texts originally intended for children. If he learns to read, only to be
fed a diet of childish tales, he cannot be blamed for assuming that education
is a waste of time. If, however, learning to read will enable him to learn ways
of producing more food, or of taking an active part in the affairs of his com-
munity, then he is more easily convinced of the value of literacy.
This production department will include writers and draftsmen. One of
the five centres will be equipped with a complete production crew to turn
out films and other visual materials. Another will be similarly staffed for
radio work, with an experimental recording studio included in its equipment.
The materials prepared by production departments at regional centres will
be turned over to countries In the area for final use. The programme does
not call for Unesco either to publish textbooks or to produce films for distri-
bution in quantities.
The teaching faculty of the centre will comprise the third or training
department. This staff will be made up of instructors in sanitation, hygiene,
agriculture, handicraft industries, home economics and literacy training, as
well as general fundamental education specialists.
CHAIN REACTION FOR PEACE. One of the novel features of Unesco's world
campaign against ignorance has been called"training by chain reaction". Specialists
trained at six Unesco fundamental education centres will return home to establish
national and then local training centres, thus greatly multiplying the number of qualified
personnel needed for this urgent drive against Illiteracy and low living standards.
First Centre-Patzcuaro
ALL three departments will contribute to the centre's fourth function ofaiding fundamental education activities in its region. This aid will be
carried out through missions by single experts or teams, the organization
of conferences and study seminars and the exchange of information and docu-
ments-an important factor in this field where educators often work com-
pletely cut or from normal sources of information.
In one of the five regions, Latin America, the programme has already passed
beyond the blueprint stage. On April 15, work began at a regional centre at
Patzcuaro in the Mexican state of Michoacan, under the combined sponsorship
of Unesco. the Government of Mexico and
the Organization of American States.
(On the occasion of the official
inauguration of the Patzcuaro Centre on
May 9 by M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's
Dll'ector-General, the Courier devotes pages
7, 8 and 9 of this issue to a description of
the Centre and of its work.)
The Patzcuaro centre should train more
than 1, 000 fundamental education spe-
cialists during its period of operation.
These graduates will find ready employment
in campaigns against illiteracy now being
conducted by Latin American countries in
regions where, it was recently estimated,
70, 000, 000 persons are unable to read and
write.
The total cost of the programme cover-
ing Latin America and the other four
regions, spread over twelve years, would be
$20, 000, 000.
Detailed proposals for financing the
project have been prepared by a Committee
of Unesco's Executive Board. After con-
sideration by the Board, they will be placed
before the General Conference. A sub-
stantial part of the finance needed must be
obtained from sources other than the
normal budget of Unesco. It is believed
that this can be achieved.
This money cannot come from the
regions in which the centres will open, for
they are areas in which little more can be
done for a long time, than to provide the
populations with a hard-won living. Ob-
viously, it is in the interests of the better-
favoured regions and of the whole world
that less fortunate areas should not be
abandoned to illiteracy and disease, to
poverty and recurrent famine, and, worst of
all, to despair.

FIRST H. Q. IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST IGNORANCE
- by Daniel Behrman
ON the occasion of the inauguration last month of
Unesco's first fundamental education training
centre at Patzcuaro, the COURTIER sent
Daniel Behrman to Mexico to report on this event.
On the following pages Mr. Behrman describes the
Patzcuaro Centre, its work and the communities which
are serving as the local base for its operations.
"Tata"Vasco de Quiroga
DON VASCO DE QUIROGA died
400 years ago, but he is still
the leading citizen of Patz-
cuaro, a quiet little town on the
shores of a fairy-tale mountain lake
some 250 miles west of Mexico City.
He was very much present on
May 9, 1951, when, in the presence
of President Miguel Aleman of
Mexico, nearly 4, 000 people crowded
into Patzcuaro's main square to
watch M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Direct-
or-General of Unesco, inaugurate the
first international training centre
and research laboratory for raising
standards of living through education.
As the ceremony ended, a tall Tarascan Indian stepped up to
a microphone on the improvized grandstand. Turning to the
Mexican President and M. Torres Bodet, he said, in Tarascan,
that he and his people were very pleased to see the centre
open."Tata Vasco would have approved,"he added.
In Tarascan,'''tata''means"our beloved father" ; it is a
title with which only a few people have been honoured.
Don Vasco earned it in the 16th century when he was sent
to Patzcuaro by the Spanish Government to investigate reports
that landholders were enslaving the Tarascans.
By 1537, when he became the first bishop of what is now
the Mexican State of Michoacan, he had persuaded the Tarascans
to leave their mountain hiding-places. He founded schools
and taught the Tarascans to help themselves by organizing local
industries. Market day in Patzcuaro is still Friday, the day
Don Vasco chose. He died in 1565 at the age of 95 while
visiting a Tarascan village. But, in the 20th century, if you
explain the meaning of"Fundamental Education"to a Tarascan
in Patzcuaro, he immediately thinks of Don Vasco.
For'''Fundamental Education"is simply education in the
fundamentals of daily life. It is a highly-specialized field.
Teachers not only have to be familiar with methods of purifying
water or of crop rotation, but they must have the ability and
the understanding to explain them in the simplest terms.

the wooden plough. I saw men 60 years old in island
villages who could not read or write. Up in the mountains
surrounding the lake-the lake itself is 6, 300 feet above sea
level-I saw Tarascan girls drawing water from an uncovered
spring, with pigs wallowing a few feet away.
These conditions are gradually being eliminated in the
Patzcuaro region through an efficient, and now deeply-rooted,
rural education system set up by the Mexican Government.
But-and this is the reason why an international centre is now
operating at Patzcuaro-most of the world's population live
under similar conditions.
The centre has been established through the close co-operationof Unesco, the Urganization of American States

Organization. Unesco has allotted $115, 000 for
its first year of operation and the OAS $40, 000.
Buildings and land are provided by Mexico.
The centre has two objectives : to train teachers
of fundamental education for Latin America and,
secondly, to find out what are the best teaching
aids available. In Latin America--------
alone, there are 70, 000, 000 people
who cannot read or write-and
illiteracy is nearly always found
along with bad health, inadequate
housing and out-dated, inefficient
working and farming methods.
The term.'teachers of fundamen-
tal education"does not ne-
cessarily imply school-teachers
alone. Unesco, at Patzcuaro, has
the assignment of training special-
ists from other UN agencies in
the methods of bringing home
their knowledge in fields such as
health, agriculture and rural indus-
tries, to the. people who need it.
Experts from WHO, FAO and ILO
are among the centre's faculty
members.
The centre now has 52 students
from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
El Salvador, Honduras, Peru,
Guatemala, Haiti and Mexico. Its
faculty has an equally international
flavour with members from Co-
lombia, Denmark, Mexico, Puerto
Rico and the United States.
FOUR POINT PROGRAMME
EIGHTEE :-i Tarascan villageswithin e y distance of

These communities live on islands,
in mountain valleys, or on the plain
separating the lake from the
mountains. In a ! I, the"labora-
tory' covers about 80 square miles,
with a population of 10, 000.
Faculty members consider these
Tarascan people one of the centre's
most valuable assets. They are
industrious and intelligent, with a
long tradition of local handicrafts
- some of which, unfortunately,
are dying out.
The centre's curriculum in this
region was summed up briefly by
Lucas Ortiz, a stocky, powerfully-
built man of 47 who directed
Mexico's rural education pro-
gramme before becoming director
of the Patzcuaro centre. He
believes in making people work by
example. Six days a week-
sometime seven-he is at work
in the centre's headquarters at
Erendira, the graceful villa given
by General Lazaro Cardenas,
former President of Mexico.
"At Patzcuaro", Senor Ortiz
explained,"we intend to show
students how to stimulate the
improvement of life in rural areas
through what I like to call the
four cardinal points of fundamental
education. These are :
"First, man must protect his
health ;
"Secondly, he must take advan-
tage of local natural resources ;
"Thirdly, he must dignify his
home life-materially and spiri-
tually ;
"Fourthly, he has the right to
enjoy leisure, and he must be given
the opportunity to do so."
I looked up from my notebook
and asked :"But what about
teaching him to read and write ?"
Senor Ortiz smiled."We're
often asked that. It is no use
teaching a man literacy unless you
convince him it will help solve
the problems of his daily life. We
teach literacy when we teach health
or home economics or agriculture.

Dr. Anzola Gomez, who was working the same
hours himself putting the centre's curriculum
into final shape. A key man in his own country's
educational system-he directedE">".....,"-.Colombia's literacy campaign in
1941 and 1942-he is firmly
convinced the centre has an im-
portant job to do.
"The only way to raise living
standards in regions like Patzcuaro
is through close co-ordination
between teachers and technicians",
he said.
"That may not be clear, so let
me give you an example from my
own experience-a bad example
at that.
"About 15 years ago, I was
director of education in a
Colombian province with 150 rural
schools. We were suddenly faced
with an outbreak of tropical
anaemia and I had to act quickly.
The province's doctors distributed
medicine wholesale, and we began
a big campaign to build sanitary
facilities. We put a cement latrine
in every school, and the sickness
disappeared. But the following
year, tropical anæmia broke out
all over again.
"It didn't take us long to find
out why. Every latrine was locked.
Someone had tacked up signs :
'Keep this door closed to prevent
mosquitoes from entering.'So, no
one ever opened the door.
"That taught me that education
has to accompany even the
simplest technical improvements",
Dr. Anzola Gomez concluded.
LIVING WITH THE PEOPLE
IN their training, the centre's52 students will work in t n
teams with each member special.
lizing in one of the following
subjects : health, home economics,
rural economy, recreational pro-
gramme or what the centre calls
social education-that is, educa-
tion to give villagers a sense of
community responsibility.
At present, the students are ready
to undertake an intensive survey
of each of the 18 villages in the
area. It will be a house-to-house,
family-by-family affair. When the
results of this survey are brought
back to the centre, the students
themselves will lay out fundamental
education programmes for each
village, with the guidance of
faculty members.
These programmes, Dr. Anzola
Gomez stressed, will vary from
village to village. On the islands,
for example, where villagers live
by fishing, the main problem is
that the fish supply of Lake
Patzcuaro diminishes every year.
In the mountains, there is an
urgent forest conservation problem
and, on the plains, agricultural
methods need improvement.
These programmes are no paper
theories. Once they have been
decided, student teams will go out
and put them into practice, living
in each community for a fortnight
at a time. They will work closely
with Mexican teachers."We are
certain to make errors, but we have
to try", commented Dr. Anzola
Gomez."The only way of not
making mistakes is not to attempt
anything".
That also sums up the approach
adopted by Dr. Enrique Laguerre
toward solving the second main
problem facing Patzcuaro's students
and faculty. Dr. Laguerre, whose
home is in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
is responsible for producing
teaching aids for experimental use
in the Patzcuaro region.

countries speak Spanish, and many
of them have the problem of a

Dr. Gabriel Anzola Gomez. Like
other members of the faculty,

makeshift quarters while awaitingthe conversion of an old hotel's tourist cabins into

he and his staff use in the textbooks, radio pro-
grammes and films they produce at Patzcuaro.
As far as textbooks for newly-literate adult pupils
are concerned, Dr. Laguerre believes they must meet
two standards ; they have to be adapted to local
ways of life and they must use the simplest possible
language.
His first step in textbook production might be
called an inventory of the region's word resources.
Though nearly all the Tarascans speak Spanish, they
have their own version of the language. If you tell
a fisherman on Lake Patzcuaro, in good Spanish,
that he is using a malla, he will not understand.
He calls his net a cheremicua.
Dr. Laguerre has already enlisted the aid of local
newspapers and school-teachers in his survey. He
also counts on the centre's students as world
"detectives", because they come from other areas
and thus are the first to spot local variations in the
Patzcuaro region's Spanish.
Aiding Dr. Laguerre in textbook production work
are two pressmen and two artists, all hired locally.
Artists, he believes, should come from the region

of the Patzcuaro centre, is explaining to them

where the textbooks are to be used, or else they
must spend too much time learning about the region.
"If we use a house or a fishing boat to illustrate a
textbook,"he explained,"it has to be a house or a
boat our readers recognize or else they are
meaningless. We've no place for abstract concep-
tions".
REALISTIC BOOKS AND FILMS
As the centre's publisher, Dr. Laguerre has acompact Multilith press and a set of Varitype
machines. The Varityper is basically a typewriter
with a mechanism permitting it to print what
publishers call"justified lines"-that is, columns
with even margins on both sides as in an ordinary
newspaper. Dr. Laguerre chose these machines
because they offer a wide selection of type faces, and
because their letters can be photographed and
enlarged to any desired size at low cost.
With Dr. Laguerre are two experienced American
librarians, Marie Rapp of Detroit, Mich., and Rose-
mond Cook-of Brockport, N. Y. His film section
is headed by Hagen Hasselbalch, a Danish writer,
director and cameraman (documentary film production
by one man is not unusual). Both Mr. Hasselbalch
and Dr. Laguerre believe educational films in regions
such as the Tarascan villages surrounding Patzcuaro
require a technique quite different from that used
for audiences in New York, London or Paris. Dr.
Laguerre told a story to illustrate his point :"A few years ago, an animated cartoon on the
dangers of the mosquito was shown to an audience
in Africa and, at one point, the mosquito was
enlarged until it filled half the screen. This put the
spectators in a hilarious mood. They went home
and slept soundly because they knew they didn't have
mosquitoes that big around their houses."
The film strip (a modern offspring of the old-
fashioned magic lantern) has many points in its
favour for educational work, and the centre will use
it. It can be shown with a simple projector operating
on a gas lantern, so lack of electricity is no barrier
to its use. Images can be held on the screen for
as long as necessary to permit full explanation, and
it is simple to flash back a few pictures and explain
a difficult point all over again.
Dr. Laguerre and his staff are equally interested
in reaching people through their ears as well as
their eyes. The centre has begun broadcasting over
Station XELQ in Morelia, a small town 35 miles from
Patzcuaro.
A preliminary trip through the region showed
that each village has at least six or seven radio sets,
which are often centres of community life. Dr. La-
guerre has enlisted the aid of village school-teachers
to make a more complete census and to check on
listener reaction to the Centre's programmes.
Radio has helped to make known the Patzcuaro
Centre and its objectives to the entire region. On
May 7, two days before the official inauguration,
students representing eight countries talked about
themselves, their homes and their work over XELQ.
Music on this programme included a suite based on
South American Indian music played by a talented
Bolivian pianist, and the rendering of Creole folk-
songs by a young Haitian student.
During the year, each nation's students at the
centre will be called upon to produce educational
programmes over XELQ, which has allotted the Patz-
cuaro centre one half-hour of broadcast time a week
and more if it needs it.
"DON'T SHOOT THE TEACHER"
LIKE Dr. Laguerre and Dr. Anzola Gomez, who aretwo programme irectors under S nor Ortiz,
other members of the faculty give the same impres-
sion of patience and competence.
Miguel Leal and Isidro Castillo Perez, the two
"fundamental education specialists", learned their

One of the Patzcuaro Centre's specialists, Luis Felipe Obregon (complete with
stick and abundant good humour) is always welcome at neighbouring village
of Zurumutaro. Recreation is an important part of fundamental education.

acan with rifles looking for school-teachers as a target.
"I never went armed myself", he recalled,"I was
afraid I might have to use the gun if I carried one".
Senor Castillo emphasized that, though a teacher,
he doesn't have much use for lectures and large
classrooms."I believe in learning by doing", he
said.'''If this centre at Patzcuaro had been a formal
school, I wouldn't have come".
Another veteran Mexican educator is Luis Felipe
Obregon, in charge of training teachers to organize
recreation activities in villages. A distinguished-
looking man of 47, he is willing to shed his dignity
at a blast of a whistle and referee a basketball game
or start playing ball with Tarascan youngsters. He
believes recreation teachers are key men in this
specialized education because of two factors :
. They fill a definite need in villages where
the only pastimes may be card-playing, alcoholism or
idleness.
. They act as salesmen-propagandists, if you will-
for the other teachers who often must follow them.
"There is nothing which wins the confidence of a
village like playing with children in the street", he
commented. Besides that, Senor Obregon enjoys it.
He has already sketched out a preliminary
recreation programme in the Patzcuaro region
following trips to the local villages. These are some
of its points :
Revival of local dances for which the Tarascans
are famous.
Encouraging village composers and musicians who
need help in technique : Many Tarascans who cannot
write their own names can read music and, on a
Sunday morning, every other man you meet on a
country road carries a musical instrument-from a
bass fiddle to a clarinet. It is not unusual to find a
24-piece orchestra in a village of 1, 000-but tech-
niques need polishing.
Organizing sports in the region : Mexico, in
general, is very basketball-minded and Senor Obre-
gon intends to encourage volleyball and football too.
His plans include the establishing of a basketball
league in the villages near the centre. No
medals or cups for the winners, however-they will
get agricultural implements and home equipment
instead.
Enabling women to take part in the family's
leisure occupations : In too many homes surrounding
Patzcuaro, a husband often thinks there is something
wrong if his wife has nothing to do. The answer
is to make sure recreation programmes begin at
home, even if it means merely convincing the
husband his wife should sing when he plays his
guitar.

The enthusiasm and
the utter disregard of

and other faculty mem-
bers is matched by the
centre's students. They
are a serious, mature
group-their average
age is around 30-and
nearly all of them have
worked as school tea-
chers or directors of
adult education before
coming to Patzcuaro for

study.
Here is what some of
them plan to do after
_ _. _ _
finishing their year of study at the centre :
Hector A. Burbano of Ecuador, a 37-year-old teacher
whose build gives him away as a former football
player, is specializing in rural economy because be
believes education must operate in this field in order
to raise living standards in his own country. Senor
Burbano and the four other members of Ecuador's
team have signed contracts with their government
to work as an educational team in Indian regions in
Ecuador after completing their course.
Nora Soto Rodriguez is studying at Patzcuaro to
take over a school now being constructed at Coron-
ado, San José (Costa Rica). The Costa Rican
government plans to open five new rural schools,
and members of this country's team at Patzcuaro
will help staff them when they return.
Justino Melgar Aliaga, a 33-year-old high school pro-
fessor from Peru, has the assignment, with other
members of his nation's team, of setting up a centre
similar to Patzcuaro on a national basis upon corm.
pleting his course.
PROBLEMS OF PATZCUARO
SENOR Melgar Aliaga and Senor Burbano bothfound striking similarities between the Tarascans
and the Indian peoples of their own countries. Thus
the problems faced by the Tarascans are not peculiar
to any one region.
Vicente Campos for example, might be a fisherman
on any mountain lake. He happens to live on the
island of Janitzio, in Lake Patzcuaro. Paradoxically
enough, one of the main needs of his family and that
of Janitzio's 1, 500 other inhabitants is good water.
They now haul their water up from the lake in
buckets yoked across their shoulders, and not all of
them boil it-with the result that waterborne disease
crops up sporadically on the island.
Then, too, Vicente Campos has no easy time making
ends meet. He depends entirely on the lake's supply
of whitefish for a living-but the supply shrinks
every year. Now he works every night from 8 p. m.
to 5 a. m. tugging a net 100 feet long with a dugout
canoe. When he makes a catch, he sells it for 35 cen-
tavos a Ib. (about $. 03)-but there are nights when
he paddles back empty handed. He spends his days

hand study is part of students'curricu ! um.
repairing his net, a normal routine except when a net
has to be replaced. Then he and the rest of the
family work for months making a new one-while
the fish go uncaught.
Julian Talavera has nine acres of good land outside
of the lake-shore village of Zurumutaro, but there is
not much water for the land or his home. And
Julian Talavera is willing'to listen to advice on
how he could get more than three-quarters of a gallon
of milk a day from his cows.
Up in Casas Blancas, a mountain village 7, 400 feet
high and 10 miles from Patzcuaro by road, Ma-
corio Soto has an entirely different complaint. He
happens to be the village's second law enforcement
officer with the assignment of patrolling forests to see
that conservation laws are observed.
One of these laws forbids anyone in the region from
cutting down a live tree (wasteful stripping of trees
is believed to be one reason why, in Casas Blancas,
you may find wells 100 feet deep and bone-dry).
However nothing can turn a live tree into a dead
one faster than a forest fire-and"accidental"
fires happen frequently. That is, the villagers always
tell Senor Soto that the fire was accidental as they set
out to chop down the newly·killed trees.
These are only three of the 10, 000 villagers whose
problems in daily living have become those of
Unesco's international centre at Patzcuaro. Can you
educate mountaineers to realize that cutting trees
wastefully means cutting their own life lines ? What
is wrong with Julian Talavera's cows ? Is it the feed,
or does the region need new stock ? And what is the
best way out of Vicente Campos'difnculties ? Is it
stocking the lake with fish, teaching him to observe
a closed season while fish are breeding, or must be
learn a new way of making his living ?
These questions cannot be answered quickly. Maxi.
can education leaders have spent years working on
them. Patzcuaro, first of a world chain of Unesco
centres to extend fundamental education by providing
a greatly increased number of specialized teachers
using the lutest techniques, will help Mexico-and
other countries-in this huge task. For over half
the world has a vital interest in the answers.

### 73560: Technical assistance now benefits 23 countries

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 JUNE 1951
M. PAUL VAN ZEELAND
Belgian Minister
for Foreign Affairs
THE very idea of giving Technical assistance
to under-developed countries is a noble and
stirring one, and I can easily understand
how it has appealed to the imagination of
men of goodwill.
Unesco can be proud of carrying out the educational and cultural aspects
of this programme.
As a universal organization it has responded to the undefined, yet
pressing, appeal which has come to us from past generations, for every
age has witnessed the inexorable struggle between rich nations and less
fortunate ones. The human and material resources of Unesco's member
countries are enormous, and its action can at the right moments tilt the
scales in the right direction.
It is necessary, however, that in each of the assisted countries a balance
be kept between technical progress and traditional customs, for material
progress cannot be made at the cost of destroying inestimable moral or
spiritual values acquired over centuries. If this should happen, mankind's
cultural patrimony would suffer a great loss.
The struggle against ignorance and inertia is one of the most reassuring
aspects of the vast spiritual movement under way in the world today. It
makes a vital contribution to the establishment of a genuine peace
between peoples. The task Unesco will undertake may be long and hard,
but let us not forget that the most lasting victories are those won in the
face of difficulty over injustice, misery and ignorance.
Professor H. R. KRUYT,
Chairman of the Netherlands
Commission for International
Co-operation
IN this world we want more happiness and to
t attain this we must fulfil certain preliminary
conditions. In the first place, if we re t
enjoy good health, we must be amply fed
and this means we must work for favourable
social and economic conditions, i. e. a certain
level of prosperity. Above all, we must adopt the right mental attitudes
and see to it that education equips people to achieve these aims.
In developed countries these important values were recognized gradually,
and it took us centuries to reach the present conditions. Younger nations
are striving for similar ones and we are bound to help them wherever we
can.
Speaking for the Netherlands, I am happy to say that the Government
as well as all institutions in the fields of education science and culture
are willing to contribute in helping less developed countries. We can
offer such help not only in fields in which we have always specialized
(hydraulics, soil science, shipbuilding, agriculture), but in others in which
we have a large experience-in tropical prob1ems. tropical hygiene,
fundamental education, tropical agriculture etc. We have already wel-
comed to our country, to our mutual satisfaction, many people from less
developed countries. Moreover, an international academy to supply the
needs of other peoples coming to the Netherlands, is planned. I hope
that Unesco may succeed in the important task of assisting the less
developed countries in education and culture.
COUNT SFORZA, Minister of Foreign Affairs, italy
THE programme undertaken by Unesco within its constitutional fields of educ-ation, science and culture, as part of the Technical Assistance Plan for under-
developed countries deserves to be widely known and encouraged.
The technical assistance offered by Unesco is a new application of an inter-
national solidarity which, in spite of many adverse currents, is becoming more evi-
dent each day. It assures to less favoured peoples the conditions of prosperity andu  ---
independence indispensable to the dignity of men and women who want to live in freedom.
In giving its most effective co-operation to the Technical Assistance Plan, Italy is following the
highest and most vital traditions of its national spirit.
MRS. GERONIMA T. PECSON, Senator of the Philippines
WE of the Philippines are near enough to
the Korean conflagration to feel the heat
of its war flames. Conscious of the dan-
ger, we instinctively seek protection. In so
doing we find that protection, like peace, is indi-
visible. We cannot protect ourselves merely by
ensuring safety within our own borders. We
realize that we must have peace among our
neighbours-nay, peace in the whole world-
to ensure safety for ourselves.
But as long as there is hunger and want on any part of the earth,
as long as decent living is denied to great groups of people, as long as
misery and abuse drive man to unrest, peace will not prevail. For man
the only road to salvation is co-operation for abundant living. Herein
lies the present and the future of technical assistance. A helping hand
to the weak from the strong, a liberal flow of knowledge from a well-
developed country to an under-developed area, a free trade of under-
standing among people of varying cultures-these are the elements of
the global strategy of technical assistance. The objective is not victory
through destruction ; the goal is shared well-being achieved through the
magic touch of friendly collaboration. Technical assistance is nothing
more than friendly collaboration for co-existence.
Imperialism is the one-way street to prosperity for the colonizer and
the downward road to slavery of the colonized. This old-time imperialism
is a vanishing phenomenon in the free world. Technical assistance has
replaced it. Exploitation powered by greed of gain is now replaced by
exploitation of the possibilities of exporting expert knowledge and
sympathetic understanding. Technical assistance is the antithesis of
imperialism in objectives and procedures. It wins support by a convin-
cing demonstration of modern know-how applied in improving standards
of living. In all fields where it operates, whether it be in health or
industry, in education or government, the assisted nation co-operates
with the assisting country not because it has to, but because it so desires
such co-operation.
Korea stands as a challenge to the speed with which technical assist-
ance can work out a machinery for co-operation in attaining a common
well-being on earth. Technical assistance must accelerate its temipo. It
must catch up with the forces of destruction unleashed by war. Pilot
programmes must soon be replaced by widespread applications. Isolated
trials must soon give way to bolder schemes of nation-wide implement-
ation.
Unesco is well prepared to make its programme of technical assist-
ance come to the aid of a world half-famished and more than one half
illiterate. May it succeed in its role as a dispenser of technical ingenuity.
i
of the most alarming aspects of our contemporary society is the gap which separates the most developed countries
from the least developed ones. It is true that this gap has existed throughout recorded history for as long as there
have been cleavages of wealth and poverty between nations. But today, in an era in which the great majority of the
word's nations have joined together to seek permanent peace through international co-operation, a new way had to be found to
spread the benefits of scientific and industrial progress to those areas which lack not only capital but technicians, scientists
and trained workers. The plan of technical assistance elaborated for this purpose by the United Nations and its agencies
is conditioned byanumberofcompiex probtems. For it is not enough to furnish those"unfavoured by history and geography"
merely with the means of progress. They must be made capable and desirous of using them. More than this, technical
assistance can only be a direct result of the desire, willingness and active efforts on the part of these countries for their own
development and the shaping of their own destiny. Unesco has been guided in its programme by the principle that education
and scientific research must accompany and follow any economic development worthy of the name. tt has therefore
approached the problem from the human rather than the materiaf angie. instead of helping an underdeveloped nation by
constructing dams and bridges-although they may be badly needed-it is equally urgent, if not more so, to train teachers,
engineers, supervisors and workmen who will be able to build these bridges and dams themselves.) In other words, the final
aim of Unesco's technical assistance programme is not to provide teams of foreign workers, but national ones recruited and
given instruction vocally. As part of its Technical Assistance programme for 1951-52 alone Unesco has earmarked S2, 300, 000.
tn recent weeks Unesco has signed aid programmes with Brazil and the Philippines and sent scientific and educational teams
to Liberia and Thaiiand. Atready, a total of 23 nations are benefitting from this aid programme in Asia, Africa, Europe and
America. Thirty Unesco specialists are already at work in different countries and this number is soon expected to teach
156 with additional countries participating in the scheme. The technical assistance programme has been widely hailed by
eminent international figures, all oaf whom have recognized its far-reaching importance. On this page we are proud to publish
four statements prepared specially for the Unesco Courier by Count Carlo Sforza, Paul Van Zeeland, Geronima Pecson,
and H. R. Kruyt.

A NEW DEAL FOR THE WORD'S ARID LANDS
by Maurice GOLDSMITH
mad a wilderness when we knew
uttie of nature's laws. We plunderedthis planet, robbing the good earth of its
fertility, destroying the forests, decimating wild-
life-creating wilderness. Now-because there
are about 50, 000 new mouths to feed each day
and because the pressure on good agricultural
land is so great-we must restore the wilderness
to fertility.
The task is great, because the arid and semi-
arid regions of the world cover more than a
quarter of the land surface. They range from
deserts, homes of a few nomads, to populated
areas where economic life is maintained only by
the careful husbanding of resources like water.
The development of these different areas gives
rise to problems which, scientifically and techni-
cally, are similar in many respects. International
action is needed, and this is now forthcoming
with the setting-up of Unesco's Advisory
Committee on Arid Zone Research. The story
of this great venture began in 1948 with a pro-
posal from the Government of India to Unesco.
The United Nations has since expressed full
approval and its Specialized Agencies are
working in close collaboration with Unesco.
At the recent first session of the Advisory
Committee on Arid Zone Research in Algiers,
scientists and engineers from seven countries
outlined the beginnings of an international
research programme. One project already in
progress is the preparation of reviews of research
on water flow, in rivers and underground, which
has been carried out in the arid region. This isI ! 1'1----. :----..---- ---------------------------
of key importance, for
without water there is no
life.
The Sahara is a typical
desert of the arid zone. It
is a place of intense sun-
light, with strong wind, and
little water. There are few
clouds, and radiations from
the sun and sky are intense.
The great heat is absorbed
by the rocks and sand, re-
radiated and conducted into
the air. The rise in tem-
perature during the day
increases the currents of
air, causing sand and dust
to be picked up and trans-
ported.
Man cannot live for long
in the desert without water.
Two-thirds of the human
body is water, and to live we must maintain that
level. Desert conditions promote rapid evapora-
tion of sweat (which is water taken from the
body.)
As the American physiologist, Dr. E. F. Adolph,
points out :"Sweat evaporates in the desert
before it becomes visible : still invisible, It may
be disappearing at the rate of two or three
pounds an hour. Not only for comfort, but also
from gripping need, must this water be replaced
as rapidly as it is lost. To continue without
water in the desert is as impossible as to be
without oxygen in the atmosphere." (One minute
without oxygen is equivalent to about four hours
in the heat and sun without water.)
BARRENNESS : A desert where nothing grows Is uncommon : mostly It
is sparse grassland or scattered shrub, Many people imagine that
a desert cannot be made fertile. Waster, however, will make it by.. : >om.
*
FERTILITY : This was once a deserts. Modern technology brought
water with startling result. Arid areas can become productive If
moisture can be conserved or sources other the. m local rainfall trapped.
Unesco is making plans for a conference on
the"Hydrology of the Arid Zone with special
reference to Underground Water." (Hydrology
is explained in the article below).
Another project being undertaken is the pre-
paration of homoclimatic maps to show which
regions of the world have similar climates.
When new agricultural methods are developed
in one part of the world, these maps indicate
other regions where they may be applied.
Arid regions may differ climatically and eco-
logically, because annual rainfall may be more
or less heavy and may be associated with widely
varying heat conditions, resulting in a series of
type of climates, each with its own special
features. The arid regions of North Africa, for
example, are really comparable only to some
parts of California and Australia.
There are a number of research institutes
working on the problems of arid regions, and a
directory of these is to be compiled : In addition,
Unesco is to form panels of world experts on
the hydrology, biology and climatology of arid
and semi-arid regions.
This programme of research gives grounds for
hope. As Mr. Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-
General, has said :"'with new scientific
discoveries, we shall soon be able to turn these
wastes into a smiling home for the steadily
increasing population of the world."
ASPECTS OF SCIENCE
THE WATERS BENEATH
NOT apparent to the eye, butnone the less pres nt and vi-
tally important to the welfare
of man, are the vast seas of under-
ground water found in almost all
areas of the world, including deserts.
The volume of water below the
ground often is, in fact, many times
the maximum capacity of all avail-
able surface reservoirs, both natural
and artificial.
What geologists call. ground water
is the water collecting in and
between the porous and permeable
rocks of the earth's surface. These
great pools are the sources on
which we draw when tapping wells
and springs for the large quantities
of water needed by industry-chem-
ical plants, steel mills, power
plants-as well as for irrigation and
for domestic supply. It is under-
standable, then, that the state of our
reserves of underground water is a
matter of great importance, not only
in the arid regions but in many other
parts of the world where enormous
increases in the rate of use in recent
years have seriously threatened to
deplete the supply.
The branch of science dealing
with water, its properties and its
distribution over the surface of the
earth is formally called Hydrology.
The beginnings of this study go back
some two thousand years in history,
when It became known that springs
and rivers derive their water from
rain and snow percolating through
soil and rock and eventually coming
out again at the surface of the land.
This idea was not generally accep-
ted by scientists until nearly the
end of the seventeenth century,
when quantitative studies were made
by English and French observers.
They measured and compared rain-
fall, the evaporation of water from
lakes and seas, and the rate of dis-
charge of rivers. Gradually there
came to be recognized the existence
of the hydrologic cycle, by which
water is transported from the sea to
the land and back to the sea.
Some details of what goes on be-
neath our feet may be seen schema-
tically from the sketch below. The
water table is the upper surface
of completely water-soaked ground.
Notice that it is not level, as water in
an open pond would necessarily be, but
is higher beneath the hills than in
the valley. This is because there is
a continual, but slow, sideward and
downward flow of water as it filters
through the rock, and the continuing
replenishment of water seeping into
the ground does not permit the water
surface to attain its usual condition
of balance along a level. Above the
water table, the spaces between the
rock and soil particles are not
completely water-soaked.
If an ordinary well is to yield
water, it must be dug to a point
below the water table, and the water
must be pumped to the surface.
But sometimes drilling into the satu-
rated zone between two impermeable
layers of rock will produce a well
from which the water may gush
spontaneously and continuously.
This is an artesian will, named for
the province of Artois, in France,
where the first wells of this kind
were used early in the twelfth cen-
tury. In places where the water
table happens to meet the surface of
the ground, the water may issue as
a spring, and in some instances a
marsh or a lake may form.

surface of the ground. The wells, which must be sunk to a point beneath the water table,

place varies from time to time, depending upon supply and demand. It is usually lowest in
the Autumn.
by Ira M. Freeman
Despite the claims of"water di-
viners"who represent themselves
as having a mysterious ability to
locate water with no other equip-
ment than a forked stick, prospect-
ing for the hidden treasure of
underground water is a complex,
time-consuming and costly scientific
occupation. The amounts of water
entering the rock in a given region
must be computed and other fac-
tors must be estimated. The phy-
sical nature of the rock must be
studied, and its porosity, state of
division and other properties must be
examined. In recent years, geo-
logists and hydrologists have had at
their disposal certain indirect
methods of getting the required
Information, such as electrical and
radio-active means of locating, fol-
lowing and measuring the quantity
of ground water.
Recognition of the fact that
ground water is one of the more
important of our natural resources
has been slow in developing. This
has become a matter of deep concern,
not only in arid countries but in

### 73563: Despite threats to peace, men strive to protect their spiritual heritage, as did Le Chapelier, father of copyright

UNESCO COURIER-Page 14 JUNE 1951
DESPITE THREATS TO PEACE, MEN STRIVE
TO PROTECT THEIR SPIRITUAL HERITAGE
AS DID
A HUMAN RIGHTS VICTORY : In France, the rights of authors were written into law during the Revolution. This was largely due to Le Chapelier
brilliant lawyer and legislator, here pictured presiding over the National Assembly on August 4, 1789, when privileges were abolished.
IF Rabelais, Shakespeare or Dante
came back to earth today, they
would be astound d to s e the pro-
minent place given to.. copyright"
in a Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. For today, it is universally
conceded that writers, composers and
all creative artists are the spiritual
masters of their works and are entitled
to claim a just share of the revenue
resulting from them.
But this right, which we now take
for granted, is actually of comparati-
vely recent origin. For centuries, the
marvellous invention of printing en-
riched the publisher, or as he was
then called, the bookseller. In France,
under a special privilege from the
King, he had practically a monopoly.
The author had no such guarantee
and once his work passed out of his
hands, it was lost to him. All that re-
mained was the hollow satisfaction of
renown, eked out by the capricious
bounty of a patron of the arts-most-
ly, of little account.
An Engaging Personality
IT was not until the French Revo-lution that a new right, whose
conception was, from the first,
very clear, was written into law.
"The most sacred, the most un-
assailable and, if I may say so, the
most personal of all rights of owner-
ship is creative work, the fruit of a
writer's thoughts. It is therefore most
right and just that the men who cul-
tivate the domain of thought should
reap some harvest from their labours.
During their life and for some years
after their death, no one should be
able, without their consent, to dispose
of the product of their genius."
This clear and forceful statement
was made by Isaac-Guy Le Chapelier,
in the Constituent Assembly, during
the memorable session of July 21, 1791.
Unquestionably an engaging perso-
nality, this Breton lawyer was some-
what maliciously described in a con-
temporary newspaper as"fond of gam-
ing and women, elegantly dressed,
always well curled and powdered."
Yet, his face was coarse : yellow
complexion, cynical mouth and an
air of cunning. The true worth
of the man was perhaps only revealed
in his high, noble brow. Obstinate,
energetic, clever, a marvellous extem-
pore speaker, he quickly achieved po-
litical fame. It was he who presided
over the National Assembly debates
on the famous night of August 4, 1789.
It was he who was responsible for theç....--.. :--..... 1.'-....10rmatlOn 01 Lne

sounded the death-
knell of the"cor-
porations"and cau-
sed the abolition of
the laws governingthe unequal division of legacies. But,
this untiring legislator and persuasive
rapporteur was also a man of
culture. In the salon of Condorcet,
"the last of the philosophers"-that
famous European salon where con-
temporary thought fermented and
took form-Le Chapelier was a
brilliant figure. He expounded his
ideas in a periodical of that time, the
Bibliothèque de l'somme public.
Writer and orator, friend of the arts,
he quickly became an ardent supporter
of the petition presented by Parisian
playwrights.
Authors of tragedies and comedies
complained that a royal privilege"had
established s. single theatre in the
Capital where everyone was forced to
present their works". Henceforth they
would no longer tolerate that actors
"should be the sole possessors of mas-
terpieces for which the French stage
was illustrious".
His Finest Hour
E CHAPELIER took up theirclause. On the Parliamentary tri-
bune at this time, defending au-
thors'rights, he knew his finest hour
To help win his case, he first refuted
Rousseau's diatribe against the im-
morality of theatrical performances.
Down with privilege, relic of princely
favours, and barrier to the advance of
liberty ! All this must be replaced by
a right recognizing the author as sole
owner of his works.
The law was passed unanimously
and received the commendation of Mi-
rabeau. Playwrights were granted the
rights of literary ownership for the
first time The law set forth that en-
graved or printed dramatic works
should not be repro-
duced without the
"formal and writ-
ten"consent of the
author, or without
that of his heirs for
a period of five yearsalter nIS aeacn. lJreOltOrs or meatre
producers should not be allowed to
seize the remuneration that justly
belonged to the author.
Set down in the faded yellow leaves
of the Moniteur Universel this small
text defies oblivion and remains to
the lasting honour of its originator.
It prepared the way for a legislation
which has in the last 150 years spread
through Europe and the world.
The question of copyright had cer-
tainly aroused much interest at that
time. Since the beginning of the
18th century a certain measure of pro-
tection had been accorded to English
authors by the Statute of Anne,
entitled"An act for the encourage-
ment of learning by vesting the copies
of printed books in the authors or pur-
chases of such copies during times
therein mentioned". In America,
between the years 1783 and 1786, ten
of the thirteen original states had pro-
claimed in their legislation their desire
to encourage learning for the public
benefit, coupled with provisions
stressing the author's interest, several
States declaring that there was"no
property more peculiarly a man's own
than that which is produced by the
labour of his mind". But these pro-
THREATS FRO\1 WITHOUT-UNREST WiTHiN : In July 1791, Austria and Prussia threatened to invade France. Unrest swept Paris and fight-
ing broke out at the Champ de Mars (above). Despite such conditions, the Constituent Assembly continued its work, and only four days after the riotsit passed a law granting literary ownership to playwrights.
visions did not have such a wide-
spread influence on other countries as
the French law.
In France, the date July 21, 1791,
was an important one. Tempe-
stuous days followed the flight to
Varennes. Louis XVI was brought
back to Paris,"a humiliated cap-
tive", to the consternation of some
and the anger of others. After a
thousand years of monarchy the
throne was tottering. Excitement and
unrest swept Paris and the provinces.
At the Champ de Mars, the National
Guard fired on the people ; the dead
littered the steps of the national altar.
Despite these conditions, the pro-
mulgation of laws continued without
respite. The members of the Consti-
tuent Assembly faced up to all threats.
They recognized the Navy and Trea-
sury, debated the fate of the King
and, not least of all, took steps to pro-
tect Racine's successors.
The Foundation
TWO years later-in July 1793-theConv ntion suffered the full forc
of the tempest. Insurrection broke
out in sixty departments. The Ven-
déens marched on Tours. The Coali-
tion armies invaded the North and the
East. Conde, Valenciennes, and Belle-
garde fell to the enemy. In Paris,
Marat was assassinated. The royalists
schemed and plotted. To cope with
the desperate food shortage, the Com-
mittee of Public Safety imposed the
death penalty on anyone caught
hoarding and speculating. At the
height of the crisis, the members of
the Convention were to forget every-
thing-civil war, defeat, and the gust
of anguish and rage sweeping Paris-
in order to resume their debate on
copyright. Extending to all literary
and artistic productions the law of
1791, they decided on July 19 and 24
to recognize"the exclusive right of
authors of writings of all kinds, com-
posers of music, painters and de-
signers, to sell, cause to be sold, distri-
bute or cede the ownership of their
works". The right of heirs was ex-
tended to cover a period of ten years
following the author's death. Here,
stated in clear, precise terms, was the
foundation of subsequent laws.
A Symbolic Coincidence
THE leaders of France were con-stantly in danger at that mo
ment. Le Chapelier, like many
others, perished on the scaffold."At
a time when the history of several
centuries was being re-made, they felt
their days were numbered"said Mi-
chelet."All these men, at such an
hour, were vibrantly alive. Self-
interest, ambition, all the human pas-
sions were in play. Most powerful of
them all was love in all its many mani-
festations : love of ideas, love of
country, love of the human race.
What gigantic labours, burning de-
bates, events crowding on events, what
swift reforms, what cataclysmic chan-
ges ! What tremendous enthusiasm !"
And after all, is our present era so
different ? In this year of 1951, copy-
right is again being discussed-a sym-
bolic coincidence. A universal con-
vention is being formulated in the in-
ternational councils to give copyright
its full effect. Unesco is contributing
in this effort.

### 73564: Sweeping the cobwebs out of our museums; a world crusade

JUNE 1951
A WORLD CRUSADE
SWEEPING TH E CO 
OUT OF OUR MU
by Georges FRADIER
Page ITS-UNESCO COURIER
A TOWN I know is proud of itsschools, colleges and teachers'
training institutions. Yet in
its museum, which should be such
an important part of the educational
system, it takes little pride. Housed
in a dark and unattractive-looking
building, the museum is open to the
public twice a week, yet most people
use it as a means of passing dull
Sunday afternoons in winter.
The museum does not lack exhi-
bits ; on the contrary, it overflows
with masterpieces representing three
centuries of craftsmanship, a fine na-
tural history collection bequeathed
by an old scholar, African and Chin-
ese art treasures brought back by
an explorer of former times, and
canvasses and drawings by 17th and
18th century masters-all mixed
up in dusty rooms, inaccessible and
useless.
Meanwhile, in the schools and col-
leges, teachers wish they could show
their pupils real works of art, masks,
vases and authentic ivories ; they
would like to have samples of rock
for the geology lectures, stone tools
for history lessons. All these things
are to be found in the local museum
- along with many other treasures
- but the teachers will perhaps
never know this.
Thousands of towns, although pro-
vided with museums, are yet depriv-
ed of them in this way, for those
which aim to attract the public are
still rare, except possibly in the
United States.
It is true that hardly a hundred
years ago even the most famous
museums were content simply to
amass and then jealously guard
treasures from all lands, but they
have since made enormous progress
as science in general has come to
realize its social responsibilities.
Only the most modern, in certain
large cities have, however, managed
to adapt themselves to perform a
truly educational mission among
people of all ages and cultures.
All Can Help
A PARIS professor has declared thathe would not know how"to
give his pupils a satisfactory cultural
background with an insight into the
lessons of the past supplemented by
a proper technical education", with-
out taking them on carefully-
prepared visits to art, science and
history museums.
"Let us hope for an increase in
the number of museums like the
Palais de la Decouverte, the Musée
de 1'Homtne and the Musée des Co-
lonies", he says."These, in my
opinion, represent the prototype of
the modern museum".
All museums, no matter what
their origins or specialities, can
serve education and collaborate more
and more actively with schools.
Those who run them are no longer
simply"curators"and they would
undoubtedly agree with one of their
predecessors, Sir Henry Cole, who
wrote what in 1874 was then a bold
statement :
"If you wish your schools of
science and art to be effective, your
health, the air, and your food to be
wholesome, your life to be long, your
manufactures to improve, and your
people to be civilized, you must have
museums of science and art to illus-
trate the principles of life, health,
Sorcery ? No, just one of the striking demonstrations in physics which
children can see at the Palais de la Decouverte, in Paris. Here, they find
living illustrations of what they have learned in their books and lessons.

exhibition presented at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago.
dents find magnifi-
cently real and
living illustrations
of what they have
learned in their
books and lessons".
He adds :"It may
be that when a
young man comes
to realize the beauty
of science and its
role in the future
of man, he will de-
cide to concentrate
his efforts and
perhaps his whole
life to it". Nume-
rous schoolteachers
have declared that
apparently mediocre
classes are amaz-
ingly transformed

nature, science, art and beauty".
Such museums must indeed be set
up, and luckily the models exist.
The Paris professor referred to
above picked out as his preference
among the"prototypes"the Palais
de la Decouverte. This was founded
in 1937, and has become one of the
world's finest examples in scientific
museology.
All who visit the Palais do not
come out with a bent for astronomy
or medicine. But in the words of
the well-known scientist Louis de
Broglie :"Schoolchildren and stu-
An International Plan
IT was in the Palais-or at leastin the offic  of M. André Leveille,
its director-that the"Museums
Crusade"was started. A prelimi-
nary meeting of teachers had recog-
nized that the ideas and methods
used in his museum should be made
available to all France's schools and
colleges and that a plan to enable
all museums to participate actively
in educational programmes be
drawn up.
But this is not meant only for
France. From the beginning, the
leaders of the Crusade conceived it
as an international one ; and, with
this aim in, mind, they approached
Unesco.
As a result the American Museum
Association is undertaking the same
programme as the Paris museums.
Its leaders are soon to meet some of
their European colleagues to study
the best ways to reach their common
goal-the widest collaboration bet-
ween museums and schools.
In the Netherlands, the Ministry
of Education has ordered a special
commission to study how museum
resources can be put more fully at
the disposal of youth and the people
generally. These meetings, inquiries
and studies are being followed close-
ly by Unesco.
Meanwhile, the Crusade is gather-
ing momentum. Unesco hopes soon
to bring together at an international
seminar, museum experts, educators,
artists and scientists who can help
extend this scheme to many other
countries.
It is thanks to such a crusade that
the most humble museums, as well
as the richest, can render the service
they owe to the community.
No longer will there be museums
whose collections of useless bric-à-
brac slowly waste away in deserted
show cases. Instead, students, teach-
ers and apprentices will go freely
there at any hour of the day, alone
or in groups, to find the indispens-
able concrete examples and tangible
proofs.

### IGNORE

It
01 the University of Paris Ihat first made this city a capital. Yet the historians are right about those cross-roads. Endowed with no natural defences,
Paris has alway been an open city. ready to let in new ideas-and she has grown in proportion to the welcome she has given them. Archifects,
painters and sculptors, novelists and men of the theatre, physicians, physicists and mathematicians have been more numerous within her walls than in
any other city. They come from every province, from every uropean country, from every continent. They arrive to attend her famous schools : they
often remain. because of the liberty they find. There is no tradition that Paris is more proud of than her freedom. If it is true that the arts, sciences
and ideas develop prodigiously in Paris, it is because its people have led the way in the fight for independence and rights.. As their patron. the Parisians
have chosen a saint who in former days delivered them from slavery. The significant dates in the city's history are linked whith the development of
universal liberty. Paris may continue to be called the city of elegance andjoie de vivre ; but for millions she is above all the Capital of Human Rights.
