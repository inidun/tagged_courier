Sacred
Geometry
1994, oil on wood
(circular panel, diameter 80 cm)
by Jacqueline Nioncel
In this dynamic composition
the artist has placed four
pictures charged with spiritual
meaning around the arms of a
.~stika, an Indian emblem of prosperity.
Three of the pictures are inspired by Egyptian,
Hindu and Christian religious traditions
respectively. The artist describes the topmost
picture, a direct expression of her own spiritual quest,
as representing "the Spirit, symbol of the energy that joins
and stimulates masculine and feminine, positive and
negative, yin and yang". The juxtaposition of these four
visions of the sacred helps to create a sense of unity in diversity
and is seen by the artist as a kind of composite mándala.

'A philosophy ofdevelopment '
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), generally known as
the World Bank, was established in 1945 as a result of decisions taken at the United
Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held at Bretton Woods (U.S.A.). It is a
specialized agency of the United Nations. In the last 50 years it has developed many
pioneering concepts and a philosophy of international aid. Here Ismail Serageldin, Vice
President of the Bank responsible for its Department of Environmentally Sustainable
Development, outlines for Courier readers the broad range of its activities.
What exactly does the World
Bank do?
Ismail Serageldin: Its primary role is
to finance development projects car¬
ried out by its member countries,
especially the poorer ones. These
projects are selected solely on the
basis of economic criteria. When a
borrower country exceeds a certain
per capita income threshold, it
becomes a donor country. A lot of
countries have gone through this
process, including some European
countries.
Has the Bank's philosophy
changed over the years?
I. S.: Yes. In contrast to what a lot of
people seem to think, the Bank is
changing constantly. Rack in 1944,
its primary goals were development
aid and the fight against poverty, but
they were harnessed to an immediate
objective, that of post-war recon¬
struction in Europe. The Bank's first
loan was made to France in 1947.
But the Marshall Plan, not the
Bank, was the main financial tool in
European reconstruction, and so the
Bank was able to take an interest in the
so-called "developing countries" early
on. Although its resources were rather
limited at the time, it brought off nothing
less than a financial miracle.
In order to promote the private
sector in these countries, without any
guarantees from the governments
concerned, it created the Interna¬
tional Finance Corporation (IFC) in
1956.
Then, when the first African
countries achieved independence,
Our approach to development is based on three
inseparable aspects of the concept of sustainability:
economic, social and environmental.

### 103072: Interview with Ismail Serageldin

some very poor countries needed
loans at preferential rates but did not
meet the Bank's solvency criteria.
The International Development Asso¬
ciation (IDA) was founded in 1960 to
meet this need. This was the Bank's
first major step in the war on poverty.
Loans made by IDA can be interest-
free for up to forty years with a ten-
year grace period, whereas the World
Bank usually makes fifteen- to
twenty-year loans with only a three-
to five-year grace period and an
interest rate 0.5 per cent higher than
that at which the Bank itself borrows.
In 1988 the Multilateral Invest¬
ment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was
established to encourage the flow of
private sector credit to the poor
countries by providing investors with
guarantees against political and non¬
commercial risks in these countries.
When former United States
Secretary of Defence Robert
McNamara became President of
the Bank in 1968, was his arrival
welcomed?
I. S.: It certainly was! He brought new
blood into the Bank. He was a very
dynamic man with a strong grasp of
essentials. At that time a big debate
was going on as to whether or not the
World Bank should be engaged in
operations targeted at the poor ini¬
tially it had been concerned exclu
sively with countries' economic growth.
Redistribution of income (investment in
human resources) was regarded as a
political matter, within the sphere of
state sovereignty. This was the begin¬
ning of a process of reasoning which
in 1991 culminated in the Bank's
demonstration that growth and redis¬
tribution were complementary.
In 1973 Robert McNamara said in
a speech in Nairobi that the Bank was
committing itself to the war on poverty
and targeting the lower 40 per cent of
the income distribution, in other words
those who were so poor that their con¬
dition was below any definition of
human dignity. From then on eco¬
nomic growth and poverty reduction
were the Bank's objectives. The idea
of integrated rural development was
launched, and the following year the
Bank began to attack the problem of
urban poverty. In 1975 it turned its
attention to health and population.
Did the 1973 Yom Kippur war
and the ensuing oil crisis have an
effect on the Bank's policy?
I. S.: The enormous financial flow that
accompanied the oil crisis triggered a
rush to this new source of wealth by
the commercial banks. The developing
countries took out loans from these
banks that their governments guaran¬
teed without hesitation. The World
Bank was against these so-called "sov¬
ereign" loans, which meant that the
lending bank was not interested in what
the borrower state did with the loan.
The World Bank lends on govern¬
mental guarantees, but it is also obliged
to make sure of the soundness of what

Serageldin
is being planned. All the Bank's loans
are linked to specific projects. If a road
is being built, for example, the Bank
pays as the work proceeds.
By the end of the 1970s many of
the countries that had taken out "sov¬
ereign" loans from the commercial
banks were hit by a collapse in the
prices of the raw materials they
exported. They were in deep trouble,
short of currency and funds. (It is
worth recalling here that the big
problem of international debt involved
commercial banks, not the World
Bank). These countries then appealed
to the World Bank for help, asking for
loans but without any specific pro¬
jects in view, since their economic and
financial situation made it impossible
for them to continue work on projects
that were already underway, never
mind embarking on new ones.
And this was contrary to the
World Bank's principles. . .
I. S.: Precisely. To help member
states out of the deadlock, we had to
understand why their financial insti¬
tutions had got themselves into such
a mess. That's when structural
adjustment programmes came in. The
liquidity loans that went with these
programmes were regarded as excep¬
tions to the Bank's rule; they were
made to enable countries to achieve a
more balanced position. At the time
the Bank thought this phase would
last only a short time.
But in 1983 the Bank realized that
for many countries, mainly in Africa,
structural adjustment was going to be
a very long job. A study carried out at
the request of African finance minis¬
ters made a clear diagnosis: African
governments bad run their economies
badly, exchange rates were intoler¬
able, and state-related structures
were too heavily subsidized.
So the Bank insisted on the need
for a moral agreement between credi¬
tors/lenders and African countries
which were ready to put their house
in order. Among other measures, the
Special Fund for Africa was created to
increase the IDA's lending capacity to
the twenty-two most indebted nations.
This was a turning point in the
international community's methods
because for the first time the guar¬
antee of a sovereign state was no
longer enough. The borrower
country had to put its economy in
order. Lenders and creditors
expected the World Bank to evaluate
the efforts made in this regard by bor¬
rower countries. This position was
officially adopted when the Special
Fund for Africa, administered by the
Bank, was created in February 1985.
What role did the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) play in the
debt crisis?
I. S.: A country has to be a member of
the IMF before it can become a
member of the World Bank. And once
a year each member state has to
review its financial and monetary man¬
agement with the Fund, which then
submits a report. In fact the World
Bank and the International Monetary
Fund are complementary institutions.
The latter looks after short-term bal¬
ance exchange rates, money stock
and credit and the former is con¬
cerned with long-term production and
investment structures.
Tru
As the debt crisis grew, the com¬
mercial banks and other creditors
accepted to reschedule provided the
IMF was willing to monitor the eco¬
nomic and monetary situation on a
quarterly basis. The Paris Club (cred¬
itor governments) and the London
Club (commercial creditors) were
founded at that time. The IMF played a
very important role in matters relating
to debt rescheduling and macro-eco¬
nomic stability, and the Bank in matters
relating to structural adjustment for
the long-term growth of the economy.
In 1987 the Bank launched a social
programme to accompany structural
adjustment measures and commissioned
a long-term study on the conditions
under which Africa could emerge from
the crisis. One of the conclusions of the
report1 , which was issued in 1989, was
that there could be no solution to
Africa's debt problem without effective
governance.
How can this dilemma between
politics and economics be
resolved?
I. S.: The Bank's rules are quite clear
on this. It is expressly forbidden for
any member of the World Bank to
intervene in the political affairs of a
member state. And a regime's political
hue cannot be used as a criterion in
deciding whether or not to make a
loan. By introducing the idea of "good
governance", the Bank sparked off a
debate every bit as lively as that about
redistribution of income fifteen years
before.
But it all depends on what you
mean by politics. The minutiae of pol¬
itics don't concern us. The political
structures of the countries we deal
with are not our business. On the other
hand there are certain aspects of gov¬
ernance that we regard as essential for
economic growth: openness, for
rue development involves improving the status
of women and empowering them to play an active par
in society.

### 103072: Interview with Ismail Serageldin

All the Bank's loans are linked to specific
projects. If a road is being built, the Bank pays
as the work proceeds.
example. When a country has no clear
idea of the size of its external debt
because several different ministers
have had the right to authorize state
expenditure, doubts arise about its
governance. This is no longer, strictly
speaking, a question of internal politics.
The second aspect is account¬
ability, in particular justification of
the use of funds. Suppose a
country's power company makes mas¬
sive losses and to make up for them
turns to the public treasury, whose
money comes from taxes on farm
products. It cannot be denied that
this is of concern to the Bank. Good
governance cannot mean creaming off
funds that should be used for invest¬
ment to make up for deficits incurred
by badly managed uncompetitive
public-sector enterprises.
Thirdly, institutional pluralism is
necessary to create an atmosphere
that encourages better economic man¬
agement. For that a country needs
chambers of commerce, employers'
federations and trade unions.
It is also indispensable that
investors and other economic players
should be kept informed of what the
state is doing in the field of tax and
income tax law. A survey of 121 pro¬
jects carried out by the Bank shows
that the ones that worked best were
those in which the different economic
players took part.
But more than anything else, the
rule of law is absolutely essential.
There can be no useful investment or
serious investors without an invest¬
ment code that clearly defines obliga¬
tions, taxes, interest rates, rights, and
so on. Investors also need to count on
a reliable legal system. If there isn't
one, they won't run the risk of
investing in the country.
All these criteria of good manage
ment should help to create an encour¬
aging general environment for eco¬
nomic activity.
As part of the same line of
thinking, the Bank supports the
idea of sustainable development. . .
I. S.: Our present approach is based
on three indissociable aspects of the
notion of sustainability: economic,
social and environmental.
Sustainable development means
giving future generations as much cap¬
ital as we have had ourselves and the
same opportunities to transform it into
goods and services. These opportuni¬
ties can easily be quantified. Our idea
of what is meant by capital must be
extended to include not only economic
and financial capital, but also natural
and human capital, in other words
health, education and nutrition, and
the social capital represented by
investment in the structures that
enable society to function. This is a
new approach to the wealth of nations.
All social structures are based on
the individual and the bonds existing
between individuals. This gives rise
to a paradox. We have to be free to
act as individuals, but this freedom is
meaningless if the individual is not in
contact with others. Human beings
must act socially and express their
freedom but they must bave a great
degree of autonomy as well. This co¬
operation between individuals gener¬
ates well-being and wealth.
All World Bank studies on the
role of women show that women play
a role of major importance in eco¬
nomic development. True develop¬
ment involves improving the status of
women and empowering them to play
an active part in society. Education
and access to credit are essential
components of this empowerment.
Economics, politics, culture and
the environment are central to
development. What about the spiri¬
tual aspect?
I. S.: A few years ago some of my col¬
leagues and I wrote a book about
this, called Friday Morning Reflec¬
tions at the World Bank: Essays in
Values and Development. We set up
a small discussion group almost
twenty years ago, and we meet every
Friday morning to talk about the spir¬
itual values of development. Our
members include Christians, Mus¬
lims, Buddhists, atheists, and Jews.
The book has four chapters, written
by a Muslim, a Hindu, a Christian
and an agnostic.
What kind of thing do you talk
about?
I. S.: Contrary to what you might
think, it's not a dialogue between reli¬
gions, since some of our members are
non-believers. We talk about the spir¬
itual values of development. We
choose a topic such as "at what levels
should we attack poverty?" or "What
is the role of charity in development
projects?". Everyone puts forward a
personal point of view depending on
who they are, intellectually and spiri¬
tually speaking, without representing
a particular religion. The chapter I
wrote is quite clear on this point. It is
called "The Justly Balanced Society:
One Muslim's View"2. Speaking for
myself, the values I consider to be
Islamic require us to defend the inter¬
ests of the poorest and the marginal¬
ized members of society. But of course
wherever we come from and whatever
our affiliations and religious convic¬
tions, we share a certain number of
universal spiritual values that wc try
to apply in our daily lives. I

The plans, developed in consultation with
the two countries' authorities, non-govern¬
mental organizations and United Nations agen¬
cies, build on current UNESCO programmes in
Rwanda and Burundi. The Rwanda plan pro¬
vides for the creation of a centre for education
on peace and democracy and also includes
assistance for women, orphans and other vic¬
tims of war and genocide. The Burundi plan
includes 50 hours of radio and television pro¬
gramming on the theme of tolerance.

onth by month
In one of the opening scenes of a satirical film that enjoyed an enormous success in France a
few years back, a seasonedand corruptpolice officer describes his philosophy of life to a
young and as yet untainted colleague as they stroll through the Paris streets. He explains how
he uses his position to extort money from the local tradespeople. The young officer retorts that
the police aren't there to break the law, but to enforce it. Taking him gently by the arm, the vet¬
eran points out that people all around them are violating the law without even realizing that they
are doing so. He concludes that the law cannot be fully enforced without bringing social life to
a standstill. An intelligent policeman should accept that this is how things are andwhy not?
profit from it.
This disingenuous episode contains most of the sophistical arguments that are often
used to justify corruption: trivialization (a pedestrian crossing a street against a traffic light is
placed on the same level as a policeman running a protection racket); the use of non-sequiturs
(illegal practices exist, therefore it is impossible to stop them); making a quantum leap from a
factual observation to a value judgement ("Corruption is everywhere, long may it prevail!").
This issue of the Courier sets out to show that corruption is not inevitable and that it can
and must be countered. We have endeavoured to look at corruption as a historical phenomenon,
analysing the reasons for it and the forms it has taken at different times and places; to trace
the borderlineif there is onebetween excusable irregularity and unpardonable criminality; to
identify ways and means of fighting the latter. We have tried to pinpoint new types of corruption
arising from the globalization of the economy, drug trafficking and the formation of transnational
mafias. Above all we have paid particular attention to the implications of this gangrene for
democracy.
Corruption is an evil that affects all societies to some extent, and is even tending to
asphyxiate the more fragile among them. It can be traced back in time as far as the earliest his¬
torical record, for a "society without evil" has never existed. Where there is inequality, corrup¬
tion is not far away. But come what may, people everywhere continue to fight to limit injustice
and contain corruption. How do they do this?
Tyrants who present themselves as "incorruptible" and claim to be restoring an ideal
polity set up dictatorships where corruption flourishes behind the curtain of state secrecy.
Democracies are not, of course, immune to corruption, but they succumb to it when they allow
the existence of shadowy areas in which the misuse of power can spread unchecked. In the
unending struggle against corruption, it is free citizens in societies based on the rule of law
and the separation of powers who play the key role, as vigilant and effective defenders of the
common good.

### 103073: The Roots of a long tradition

The roots of a long
by Biancamaria Fontana
Study of corruption's many forms since
Antiquity throws light on the dangers it
presents to modern democracy
Ever since classical antiquity the cen¬
tral problem of politics in the West has
been how to control individuals and groups
inclined to put their own interests before the
common good. For over 2,000 years corrup¬
tion has been perceived as the main factor of
political change, the recurrent cause of decline
for inadequate regimes and of their replace¬
ment by more desirable ones. Only by
bringing historical depth to our understanding
of the problem of political corruption can we
hope to go beyond the superficial response of
bewilderment and moral condemnation.
To some extent the traditional conception
of people as potentially corrupt or corruptible
rests upon a pessimistic view of human nature,
reinforced by religious belief in the imperfec¬
tion of earthly things. But it also goes together
with an appreciation of the density of social
relations hierarchies, structures of economic
dependence, family ties, local solidarities, cor-
poratist or confessional complicities. The world
of classical politics is a crowded universe pop¬
ulated by clients, patrons, courtiers, schemers
and sycophants, whereas the modern demo¬
cratic state (at least in its ideal form) is a neutral,
impersonal machine, set against an anonymous
mass of equal citizens.
As the Scottish philosopher David Hume
noted in 1742, people have a much stronger
commitment to those who are close to them
family, friends, neighbours than to vast,
abstract entities such as a city, a nation or
humankind at large. Similarly, human beings
find it easier to act badly on behalf of a group
such as a clan or a political party than individ¬
ually, since the irregular behaviour of a group
is usually easier to justify on ideological grounds
than that of an individual.
The landscape of corruption depicted in
classical literature is rich and diversified. In
monarchies the main corrupting agent is the
sovereign, and decadence trickles down from
the top of the hierarchical ladder via the
benefices and privileges dispensed by royal

tradition
favour. Through the skilful distribution of
bribes, titles of nobility and public offices, or
by threatening disgrace, the king manipulates
those around him, undermining the autonomy
of councils and parliaments and transforming
an independent aristocracy into a class of
courtiers and parasites. Once aristocratic
freedom and honour have been destroyed,
the regime succumbs to the crimes and
excesses of arbitrary rule.
A permanent threat
to stability
Under republican government, on the other
hand, the danger comes from below, and cor¬
ruption takes the form of the horizontal dis¬
integration of the political community. Ambi¬
tious individuals, clans, and political factions
constitute a permanent threat to the unity and
stability of republican institutions. Through
their networks of clients and allies, intriguers
can influence in their favour the decisions of
tribunals, manipulate nominations to the mag¬
istracy and assemblies, or monopolize lucra¬
tive public posts. In democratic regimes,
where the populace enjoys voting rights, the
votes of the poorer citizens can be openly
bought and sold in return for money, food or
gifts, a practice amply documented in Euro¬
pean elections well into the nineteenth cen¬
tury. Sooner or later the degeneration of public
and private morality, popular disaffection and
the sinister designs of the rich and powerful
precipitate the republic into fratricidal war or
dictatorship.
In Western political culture, the traditional
perception of decadence, corruption and the
alternation of regimes changed radically around
the beginning of the eighteenth century with
the transition from "ancient" to "modern"
republicanism.
In ancient republics such as Athens, Rome
or the Italian city-states of the Renaissance,
preventing corruption was essentially a matter
of collective ethos and social control. True,
some artificial devices were introduced to limit
the risks of secret deals and manipulations. The
members of councils and assemblies were
often selected by drawing lots rather than by
election, hazard being considered the best
guarantee of impartiality. The tenure of public
posts was short and re-election occasionally
forbidden. Voting procedures were made
deliberately slow and intricate (in Venice the
rules prescribed for the nomination of the
Doge make it look more like a chess compe¬
tition or mathematical game than a political
event). But everybody understood that these
ingenious measures could have only superfi¬
cial effects.
The true protection against corruption had to

come from civic education, from the surveil¬
lance that the community exercised upon the
public and private behaviour of its citizens; from
feelings of religious obligation, from attachment
to municipal traditions and local identities. Virtue
was, in other words, the only real guarantee of
the preservation of republican institutions fro m
decadence, and virtue went together with patri¬
archal habits, a simple life style, deep-felt patri¬
otism and military commitment. Such views
were not confined to moralists and Utopians,
horrified by the ostentatious luxury and sexual
licence displayed by the Roman or Florentine
nouveau riches, but were shared by writers as
realistic and cynical as Machiavelli. Similarly, in
Ancien Regime monarchy, aristocratic honour
and Christian principles were supposed to com¬
bine to limit the corrupting ambitions of the sov-
ereign. The sacral authority enjoyed by the
monarch by divine right was inseparable from
the constraints of religious morality.
Self-regulating mechanisms
With the consolidation of the modern nation-
state in large centralized monarchies such as
France and England in the late seventeenth
century and subsequently in the new republics
that emerged from the American and French
revolutions the idea that virtue and honour
would protect the political order from cor¬
ruption met with increasing scepticism. For
one thing the population of large territorial
states was more difficult to control, and far
less homogeneous in its religious beliefs and
customs than the inhabitants of the ancient
republics. Local identities were marginalized,
and individual autonomy appeared more
important than conformity to standards of
civic virtue and commitment. But it was above
all the changing attitude towards wealth on the
part of eighteenth-century thinkers which
altered their understanding of corruption.
Wealth and economic prosperity, which clas¬
sical writers had stigmatized as the main cause
of political decline, were now regarded as a
source of independence and stability, the desir¬
able target of public and private efforts. The
modern constitutional monarchy and the
modern republic were not built upon the
ancient ideals of austerity and simplicity, but
on a wider distribution of property and the
development of middle-sized fortunes.
Rather than entrusting the integrity of the
state to the purity of its citizens, modern polit¬
ical theorists believed in the exploitation of
self-regulating mechanisms which should
work independently of the moral properties of
political agents.
Some of these mechanisms were socio¬
logical and played upon the dynamics of inter¬
ests and conflicts within the political commu¬
nity. Since in a large and complex society the
state would not be in a position to control effec¬
tively the influence of different interest groups,
it was easier to allow those groups to organize
and rely upon competition between them to
limit abuses. Naturally political parties would
be inclined to bend laws and rules to promote
their own influence; but several parties (the

English political system was built around the
alternation of two, and this model was imitated
by the authors of the American constitution)
would take upon themselves the task of
denouncing the irregularities committed by
their competitors. Where ancient republi¬
canism had consistently fought against factions,
the legitimization of organized parties as vehi¬
cles, as it were, of limited and supervised cor¬
ruption, was one of the great novelties intro¬
duced by modern republicanism. The
scramble of partisans and political climbers to
share out offices and benefits might not make
a pretty sight, still less the scandals that
opposing sides would unleash for electoral
purposes, yet this solution would still be safer
than the concentration of corrupt power in
the hands of a single group, or the disintegra¬
tion of institutions into anarchy and chaos.
Separation of powers and
freedom of information
Other mechanisms introduced to fight against
corruption were legal and formal. They con¬
sisted of a system of checks and balances which
guaranteed the impartiality of the public admin¬
istration by separating its different parts and func¬
tions. Once again, it was not necessary to imagine
that the people entrusted with political power
would prove honest and trustworthy. It was
sufficient to ensure that corruption in one
department would sooner or later run against
the opposition of some other branch of gov¬
ernment, which would react against the abuses.
Baron Charles Secondât de Montesquieu
(1689-1755), a magistrate from Bordeaux who
was one of the inventors of this doctrine,
believed that the essential conditions for the
equitable functioning of institutions were, first,
that the three basic powers of the state leg¬
islative, executive and judiciary should be
rigorously separated and independent from
one another, and second, that all official delib¬
erations should always be taken according to
given forms and procedures, even if this
slowed down the activity of the administra¬
tion. The machine of state power should not be
allowed to move too fast, since delays increased
the chances of detecting and reversing any
arbitrary initiatives taken by political agents.
There was of course a residual possibility
that competition amongst the branches of gov¬
ernment would prove insufficient and that the
different powers would connive in some abu¬
sive practice. The ultimate resort to protect
the impartiality of the state was the trans¬



parency of public acts and the vigilance of
public opinion. In the long run, corrupt politi¬
cians would simply lose the support of the
electorate. And since private individuals were
generally ill-placed to detect the wrongdoings
of their governors, it was the specific function
of public opinion, in the form of an indepen¬
dent press, to uncover them.
This resort to public opinion as final guar¬
antee of the accountability of the political
system introduced an element of circularity
in the reasoning: why should we assume that
opinion itself would not be manipulated or
Modern states continue to confront the issue of
corruption by relying on competition between
political forces, freedom of information,
and the separation of powers.

corrupt? The answer to these anxieties was
the préservation of pluralism: the protection of
democracy from corruption and decline
depended on breaking any potential monopoly
over information. Again, the motivations of
those who inform the public may be base and
manipulative rather than virtuous. Even stern
defenders of the freedom of the press like Ben¬
jamin Constant or John Stuart Mill knew that
journalists would promote sectarian views, or
simply try to sell papers; but they believed
(rather like the contemporary theorists of post-
modernism) that the flow of information
would prove too shifting and unstable for con¬
sistent manipulation.
It is essentially along the lines of the eigh¬
teenth-century model of checks and balances
that modern democratic states continue to
confront the issue of corruption: by relying
upon competition between political forces,
freedom of information and the separation of
powers. As a model it seems acceptable
enough: where our chances of enforcing a
shared vision of the public good are slighter
than ever, the best we can do is cling on to the
ideal, however thin, of the neutrality of polit¬
ical institutions.
Increased vigilance
The problem is that in preserving the scaf¬
folding of democratic forms and guarantees,
we have lost sight of the historical and human
contexts in which it was first erected. We have
forgotten how pessimistic were its premises;
how imperfect and fragile the protection it
offered; how the very idea of what constituted
corruption depended throughout on the pre¬
carious compromise of conflicting interests.
Recent events in Italy help to illustrate this
reality. A vast network of corrupt complici¬
ties, extending to all levels of government, has
been uncovered and dismantled by the initia¬
tive of a small group of magistrates, repre¬
senting an independent power, the judiciary.
From inside the gloomy walls of the
Palazzo di Giustizia in Milan a handful of young
judges and lawyers nobody had ever heard of
systematically tracked down and brought to
justice the most powerful men in the country,
pulling them down from their pedestal of pres¬
tige and influence. But this is only part of the
14
story. However capable and determined, the
magistrates would have been stopped (as had
happened in the past), had it not been for the
accidental convergence of a series of circum¬
stances: the uncovering of links between the
Mafia and the political regime; growing popular
disaffection such as the desperate and coura¬
geous protest voiced by the Rete, a political
party created in Palermo; the dissatisfaction of
economic interest groups who, after making
extensive usage of corrupt complicities, were
finding them too crippling and onerous to sus¬
tain; the internal division and loss of electoral
support of the governmental coalition.
In the past people used to think of political
regimes as doomed, like all human things, to
decadence and decline. Modern democracies
tend to see themselves as durable, indeed peren¬
nial models: political leaderships, cultures, gen¬
erations may pass on, but the machine will con¬
tinue to run, provided we allow for some regular Palermo jail

### 103074: The Underside of globalization

The underside of globalization
by Flora Lewis
Corruption is an old story, one way
or another as old as society. Periodi¬
cally there have been explosions of anger fro m
long-suffering, docile victims seeking to wipe
it out. It has been a causal element in most re v-
olutions, sometimes the dominant one. The
disgust it provoked was a central urge in the
Protestant Reformation. And it is still with us,
all around the world, in the poorest and the
richest countries.
But there are new aspects, as well as
ancient habits, which make corruption in
these days both easier to spread and more
intolerable. One is easy movement of people,
goods and money. Economic globalization
has created tremendous new opportunities
for illicit as well as productive creation of
wealth. Another is the sheer volume of
money that modern trade and construction
make available. In traditional subsistence soci¬
eties, oil can bring a sudden flood of riches
easy for a few to tap with no compulsion to
distribute reasonably. When there is large-
scale building, government favours can be
worth billions to be siphoned off in quantities
never before imaginable.
And, on the other side, modern business
requires assurances, a framework of law to
give confidence in vast, long-term investment
which arbitrary corruption undermines.
Democracy by definition requires account¬
ability, a rule of law based on an agreed sense
of who is entitled to what. It may co-exist with
corruption, but it is hard to reconcile and
sooner or later there is a collision. Somebody
blows the whistle and scandal erupts.
Part of the trouble is that corruption isn't
easy to define. You may know it when you see
it, but it is hard to spell out. In some ways,
democracy promotes it by limiting the power of
authority. Elections cost money. At what point
15

### 103074: The Underside of globalization

does the equation of money and votes become
criminal?
The Mafia in Sicily evolved as people
banded together to resist cruel and rapacious
overlords, and then extorted money for "pro¬
tection" against its own ability to be cruel and
greedy as well. Mussolini nearly wiped it out
with his fascist police, because he didn't depend
on elections and therefore didn't need the
gangs to deliver the votes. The U.S. was to
some extent responsible for reviving the net¬
work as an unintended result of World War II
operations. Mafia member "Lucky" Luciano,
then in an American jail, was recruited to go to
Sicily before the Allied invasion clandestinely
to prepare the way by encouraging his old
friends among the islanders not to resist.
Then, as occupying forces moved in to set up
civil government, they wanted to be sure not to
reinstate the local fascists. They opened the jails
and gave responsibilities to those whom Mus¬
solini had imprisoned. But these weren't all anti¬
fascists. Some were just Mafiosi. They busied
themselves delivering votes when the time came,
to establish a new base, as well as exploiting the
black market which always develops when there
are shortages and too many controls without
overwhelming official terror.
A vicious circle
Corruption tends to be a private enterprise,
even within government structures, because
official institutions can justify what they take
on other grounds, valid or false. But of course,
it is a mistake to think of corruption as the
inevitable enemy of government. The worst
cases always come from collusion that feeds
on itself. The more money the corrupt can
extract from smuggling, black marketing, intim¬
idation, the more they can buy off police, judges
and other officials to help promote their affairs.
The complexity of modern economics
adds a whole new dimension to corruption, ,
piling layer on layer of illicit obligation.
There is a chicken-and-egg interdependence.
The more government imposes petty restric¬
tions, red tape, arbitrary rules, the greater the
temptation to grease the way through it and
when, as is usually the case, officials are poorly
paid, the greater their susceptibility.
There are countries where this is a way of
life, almost inescapable. But the complexity of
modern economics adds a whole new dimen¬
sion, piling layer on layer of illicit obligation.
Contacts, connections, secret understandings
are essential. The networks used to be pri¬
marily local. This is what has changed in the
big open world.
Traffic in drugs is the most obvious case.
Its enormity is obviously the result of an insa¬
tiable demand, beyond explanation in social
theory but a clear sign of social and psychic
pathology. Since consuming countries have
no idea of what to do about it, they try to
address the plague from the supply side which
only increases the opportunities for corrup¬
tion. Such fortunes have been amassed that
they can hardly be spent and therefore they
induce investment. That requires money-laun¬
dering, which didn't start with drugs but with
tax havens taking advantage of the fact that
every state has the right to make its own
banking and currency laws.
The system functions because national
authorities, jealous of sovereignty, have not
organized against the increasingly intricate,
widespread and well-organized criminal syn¬
dicates. The facility of communication has made

possible links which add up to such a magni¬
tude of resources that they can swamp vul¬
nerable officialdom. It has been reported that
Western drug traffickers route money through
Russia, which may cost as high as 20 to 30 per
cent of dollar face-value, but comes out as legit¬
imate transfers which can then be deposited or
invested anywhere. In the process, the Russian
gangs enhance their ability to corrupt, extort
and impose their will by violence.
Fighting back
There is a grave imbalance between the frag¬
mented international system of laws and the
increasingly well-knit international system of
the lawless. It can't be corrected by blocking
the flow of money and goods without dis¬
rupting everybody's economy. It requires a
level of co-operation among governments and
police forces which they are only beginning
to envisage, and which some governments
don't even consider because their establish¬
ments are beneficiaries of things as they are.
At times, it seems that cynicism and toler¬
ance of corruption as the inevitable way of the
world are unshakeable. It isn't that people don't
know, they just don't know what to do about
it until it suddenly becomes too much and they
find a way to hit back. In recent years, this has
happened in Italy, Japan, South Korea, France,
Spain. It is a critical factor in the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism because, deep down, most
people find dishonesty a dirty and disagree¬
able way to live. It saps pride and dignity.
After the last Turkish election, a twenty-
three-year-old shop-keeper named Erdol
Nergiz explained his vote to a Western jour¬
nalist. He said he has a Christian girl-friend,
goes to discotheques and drinks alcohol, travels
to Europe, but nonetheless gave his ballot to
the Welfare Party, an Islamic movement which
made strong gains in the secular state. "That
shouldn't be my choice," he said. "But I did it
because 80 per cent of the people in this
country are poor and the leaders of the other
parties don't do anything for them. The cor¬
ruption and bribery here are just too much."
Violent crime and corruption, which often
reinforce each other, played an important part
in turning people to vote for the communist
party in Russia's last parliamentary election.
Under the dictatorship with its repression, there
was relatively little private crime and generally
at a low level. The regime had a monopoly on
the use of force. To the extent that the state itself
was corrupt, people had long been indoctri¬
nated not to think of it that way. So many of
them blamed reforms for the new lawlessness
and, especially, the new uncertainties.
The persistence of corruption in all kinds of
systems should make clear that it won't go
away by itself. There have to be constant vig¬
ilance and rigorous rules. While democracy
may make it harder to eliminate than the iron
fist of authoritarianism, it also offers better
tools for mobilizing people to resist corrup¬
tion once they realize its pervasive perni-
ciousness is intolerable. But for that to work,
the democrats themselves have not only to be
honest but to join in their determination to
maintain an honest society.
And they need to join across the borders
which have become so porous to criminals as
well as to commerce. Since, after all, this is
about money and the great plague is about very
large amounts of money, the technical means
for control are becoming available through the
same electronic networks which move tril¬
lions worth of dollars around the globe each
day. It can be done through the dozen or so
major financial centres. That would take agree¬
ments among governments, big banks, big
commodities traders going much further than
ever before to track and report unjustifiable
flows. Legitimate business is coming to see it
is in their interest, as it is in the interest of soci¬
eties everywhere to fight an ancient malady
which threatens to be a raging epidemic.

of Italy teaches in the faculty of
political science at the University of
Florence. Among her published
works are Lo scambio occulto. Casi
di corruzione política in Italia (1992;
"The Hidden Market: Cases of
Political Corruption in Italy") and
(as editor) Social Movements and
Violence (1992).
Political corruption has long been con¬
sidered a disease typical of the patho¬
logical but temporary phases that precede the
advent of democracy.
According to this reading of events, it is
particularly likely to develop during the abrupt
transition from a traditional society to a modern
society in which a clear distinction is made
between the public and the private spheres.
It seems to be associated with broadening
participation in political life, in a situation where
there are no structured political parties to act
as intermediaries between citizens and the state;
with massive urbanization and a drift from the
land that brings a mass of disoriented new city-
dwellers into contact with the complex
machinery of a remote bureaucracy; with the
rapid development of modern means of pro¬
duction that subordinate everything to market
forces; and with a process of rapid cultural mod-
ernization that mixes together different and in
some cases conflicting value systems.
In all these cases, corruption seems to be an
"unofficial" measure of structural adjustment
designed to repair a social fabric that has dis¬
integrated as a result of economic and political
pressure; it is a phenomenon that will disappear
as soon as market and democratic forces are
normalized1.
It should not be surprising, therefore, that
political corruption has mainly been studied by
researchers specializing in the Third World and
in transitional countries. In the industrialized
countries, political corruption should only be
a limited, marginal phenomenon. In short, the
spread of corruption ought to be inversely pro¬
portional to the spread of democracy.
In the last few years, these views on the
limited and marginal nature of political cor
ruption in the industrialized countries have
had to be revised. The huge political and finan¬
cial scandal that has implicated dozens of
elected officials and industrialists in Italy seems
to have spread to other European countries
as well as those on the Mediterranean rim.
"Model" democracies such as France and the
United Kingdom have also been rocked by
financial scandals that have tarnished the rep¬
utations of leading political figures.
In other words we must take a fresh look
at the relationship between corruption and
democracy. If the growth of democracy does
not lead to the demise of political corruption,
we must get to grips with those characteris¬
tics of the democratic system that encourage
or authorize it.
Cracks in the system
Two characteristics of modern democracies
seem to me to promote the development of
corruption: the increased number of decisions
taken in the public rather than the private
sector, and administrative decentralization,
which increases the number of decision¬
making centres. The growth of welfare pro¬
grammes, the expansion of the public sector
and the proliferation of laws and regulations
all favour the spread of corruption. Moreover,
local government opens a much broader
potential field to corruption because of the
large number of private contracts that are made
and the likelihood of avoiding scrutiny by the
central government.
But though it may be true that the risks of
corruption grow in proportion to the growth
of state leverage in economic life, it must be
recognized that a whole range of procedures
is available to prevent the discretionary powers

"The expansion of the public

development of corruption."

of the administration from being arbitrarily
used. If corruption exists in spite of these pro¬
cedures, it is because obstacles prevent them
from working properly. What are these obsta¬
cles? What are the conditions that encourage
people to act illegally and profit from oppor¬
tunities for corruption?
Like all economic agents, corrupters and
corrupted obey rational motives based on a
desire for gain. Corruption increases if the
expected benefits from it are higher than the
risk involved2. The extent of corruption is linked
to the factors that determine its profitability.
The risks involved mainly consist of dif¬
ferent kinds of sanctions (legal or administra¬
tive, official or unofficial) and the possibility
of their being effectively used, which depends
on the structure of the monitoring mecha
nisms. Where internal administrative proce¬
dures are concerned, one major deterrent is
the existence of effective control mechanisms
in government departments and offices. Mon¬
itoring procedures that apply both to bureau¬
cracy and party financing are effective if the
principle of separate accounting is fully
respected and auditors have access to all the
necessary data.
Investigating magistrates and an adminis¬
trative inspectorate constitute a third kind of
control mechanism, with the impact of pos¬
sible sanctions depending on the investigators'
degree of independence and on the material
and legal means at their disposal. Concurrent
holding of several offices, the overlapping of
politics and the civil service, and the prolifer¬
ation of purely formal checks are factors that
reduce the risk that real sanctions will be taken.
Finally, there is also a purely political check
inherent in the idea of a change-over of power
between political parties, in which case it is in
the interest of opposition parties to denounce
the actions of those in power in order to fur¬
ther their own chances of taking over. The
absence of alternation in government over a
long period may, therefore, eventually lead to
corruption. It is also quite true that a corrupt
political class may well co-operate to share the
spoils between government and opposition
parties.
Spiralling downward
Factors that influence the amount of gain fro m
corruption are determined (for private inter¬
ests) by the importance of administrative deci¬
sions and (for civil servants and elected office¬
holders) by the amount of money offered. For
businesses, the bigger the market for their
products in the public sector, the more they are
at the mercy of civil service decision-makers.
Furthermore, all things being equal, the greater
the diversity of sources available to meet
public-sector demand, the greater will be the
temptation for businessmen to indulge in
bribery to gain access to a market where com¬
petition is so fierce. As for government offi¬
cials, they will be more inclined to accept bribes
if they feel that their salaries or social status are
inferior to their qualifications especially when
rewards in the private sector tend to be higher.
But perhaps the most important question
is why some politicians are so much in need of
money. The first point to be noted is that polit¬
ical expenses are caught in an inflationary spiral.
If Candidate X spends enormous amounts on
his election campaign, Candidate Y must follow
suit if he wants to stand any chance of being
elected. This escalation is particularly strong

when politicians' expenses, especially during
election periods, are not subject to very close
scrutiny.
Political expenses also depend on other con¬
siderations that determine the terms of com¬
petition between and within parties, starting
with the frequency of elections, which in turn
depends on a variety of factors including the
number of elected assemblies, whether or not
there are primaries, and whether the elections
have one or two rounds. The nature of the con¬
test between candidates is also influenced by
the number and size of electoral colleges, the
number of lists presented and whether the elec¬
tion result is decided by majority vote or by
proportional representation.
The role of political parties
The most important parameters that concern
us here relate to parties, which are the main
actors in democratic political life. It should be
noted that the size of political parties has
nothing to do with the extent to which they
may be corrupt. Of course, a small party may
be tempted to use dubious methods to com¬
pensate for its lack of members and funds, but
the major parties maintain a substantial and
costly machine that is not always easy to fund
by legal means.
The decisive criterion is the system used
to legitimize the parties in the eyes of the
public. There is a fundamental distinction
between legitimization by symbolic means,
i.e. by convincing the electorate that the party
is working for the common good, and legit-

imization by material means, which associates
membership of a political movement with spe¬
cial access to public funds. The latter approach
involves "buying" votes individually, which
considerably increases the expense of politics.
But an investigation of the causes of cor¬
ruption should not be limited to a one-dimen¬
sional view of the phenomenon. Although it
may be true that corruption is linked to certain
characteristics of the political and administra¬
tive system, it leads to effects that modify the
system. These effects influence a kind of vari¬
able whose importance tends to be down¬
played by economic theorists: the combination
of factors that determine individual choices.
It might be said that corruption, by its very
existence, transforms the system in the sense
that it increases the importance of money in
politics and conversely reduces opportunities
to control the administrative machine. The
development of the role of parties is instruc-
I tive in this regard. In a democracy parties per-
a" form a number of basic tasks: they socialize
political life, select political personnel, inte¬
grate citizens, reconcile specific interests with
the general interest in their programmes, and
help to shape government policy.
Political careerism
Where the selection of political personnel is
concerned, in a properly functioning democ¬
racy elected officials must be able to convince
their fellow-citizens that their programmes
are useful and be able to implement them when
required. The satisfaction they derive from
this is generally more symbolic (fame,
authority, prestige) than material. In a corrupt
regime the situation is different, and parties
will tend to choose individuals who are good
i at making illicit deals which will bring in money
a to fill their coffers.
In this context, a political career is seen as
I a particularly rapid way of climbing the social
I ladder, especially since there is a growing inter-
I action between the political and business
I worlds, giving rise to a proliferation of go-
I betweens who do not fully belong to either
and therefore find it easier to break the rules
of both.
For these people, the rewards of political life
are necessarily material and undisclosed. Their
role is to act as intermediaries, to oil the wheels
of contact and negotiation between those
involved in corruption, using as currency the
supposedly confidential information that is
the common coin of illicit deals3.
Another function of political parties is to
legitimize the system by integrating citizens
into it. In a democracy, parties structure the

electorate and give voters a sense of identity.
The latter is often handed down from one gen¬
eration to the next via programmes that are
presented to the electorate. Parties have to cast
their net wide in order to win majorities; if
they do not do so, groups of citizens repre¬
senting special interests may proliferate.
In a corrupt system, on the contrary, the
structure of the electorate is subject to very
different considerations since there is a shift
away from identification voting towards clien¬
telism, with the vote as a kind of bargaining
counter to be exchanged for favours.
Clientelism and corruption are based on
"values" which encourage clan relationships
and the deliberate confusion of public welfare
with private interests. By encouraging a kind
of purely individual and self-interested elec-
toralism, corruption affects parties' capacities
to act as social mediators. As they cease to rep¬
resent the interests of the body of citizens,
parties lose their ability to mobilize and to gen¬
erate political ideas.
The third function of parties in a democracy
is to influence the development of public
policy. Here too, if the people involved are
corrupt, they are bound to be primarily con¬
cerned with those decisions that are most
"profitable" in terms of bribes. They will tend
to invest more public funds in those sectors of
the economy that are least subject to scrutiny,
creating a kind of vicious circle that weakens
the authority of the public authorities and
thereby their capacity to control.
What is more, by its very nature corruption
looks more kindly on secrecy than trans¬
parency, on small groups of initiates than the
citizens at large. Just as control is primarily
guaranteed by transparency, when decisions
are taken off the record illegal activities are less
likely to be brought to book.
The carrot and the stick
When corruption becomes systematic, par¬
ties take on a new function. They "legitimize"
the system by rewarding those who play the
game and punishing those who don't. Where
there is illegality, there is lack of confidence.
Where the rule of law prevails, the law pro¬
tects the parties to legal contracts against irreg¬
ularities. In a corrupt system this protective
role devolves on other actors: not content with
lowering the moral cost of corruption, polit¬
ical parties make corruption commonplace by
encouraging illegal practices throughout polit¬
ical life. They make sure that public contracts
go to those who agree to play the game and
not to those who refuse to do so.
Sometimes the majority and the opposi¬
tion agree to "depersonalize" illegal practices
by controlling administrative appointments,
so that corruption becomes both anonymous
and almost hereditary as generations of cor¬
rupt officials succeed each other as the years
goby.
Because it scorns the basic principles of



transparency in decision-making and equality
before the law, political corruption robs the
political system of legitimacy, and therefore of
any consensual support in the country. Its
inevitable consequence is that votes (and
silence) must be bought by individual favours
in order to compensate for the lack of a real
democratic consensus.

School (EAP) in Paris. Among his
published works are: Les milliards

(new edition 1993; "Economic

In over-regulated societies the
underground economy can act
as a safety-valve. In bloated
form it jeopardizes economic
development and undermines
political liberties.
| What is the connection between a
' Frenchman who does odd jobs about
the house on Sundays, a Cairo shoeshiner, a
drug trafficker, a Brazilian subsistence farmer
and a voluntary Red Cross worker? Appar¬
ently nothing except that they are all active in
areas that form part of the underground
economy.
The term is used to describe "every kind of
economic activity which is pursued on the
fringes of penal, social and fiscal legislation, or
which is mostly not recorded in the national
income accounts."1 This definition itself com¬
prises two types of underground economy:
the hidden economy and the barter economy.
The hidden economy refers to illegal profit-
making activities of many and varied kinds,
which include drug trafficking, smuggling,
procuring, corruption, tax fraud and forgery.
In each case the activity is kept hidden (since
it is illegal) and makes money or saves it when
tax fraud or evasion is involved for the person
who carries it out.
The barter economy is very different fro m
the hidden economy in that it involves purely
legal activities, whose only common denom-

inator is that it they do not appear in official
economic statistics (since they do not entail
any exchange of money). Here again the
examples are varied, ranging from voluntary
work for an association (a sports club or polit¬
ical party, for example) or for a non-govern¬
mental organization (such as a humanitarian
aid agency) to activities in the home (do-it-
yourself, gardening, housework) and subsis¬
tence farming.
Despite the difficulties involved in mea¬
suring the invisible, experts have tried to quan- ,
tify the underground economy phenom¬
enon in France, notably, where the National
Institute of Economic and Statistical Informa¬
tion (INSEE) ventured a figure of 4.3 per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP) for the
hidden economy alone (with 3 per cent
accounted for by tax fraud and evasion). Esti¬
mates for Third World and East European
countries are even more difficult to arrive at.
It so happens that these are the countries
where the underground economy plays a par¬
ticularly important role.
In the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe, whose economies are in the process
of going over to capitalism, and in the countries
of the South, where there is a marked phe¬
nomenon of economic dualization, the under¬
ground economy often plays a more decisive
role than in the rich countries.
Hidden billions
The underground economy existed in the coun¬
tries of Central and Eastern Europe before the
fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It even had unof¬
ficial links with the planned economy because,
in its way, it provided "answers to the short¬
comings and rigidity of the planned economy,
and particularly to shortages, standardization,
poor product quality and problems of getting
supplies to cities."2 A veritable black market
grew up in this way. Certain highly prized but
virtually unobtainable consumer goods such
as vodka, meat and petrol were produced
secretly and exchanged under the counter. It was
not unusual, either, for employees to engage
in "double work", in other words to do work
on the side at their official workplace. The
creaming off for private purposes of part of the
output of certain state enterprises in other
words theft also forms part of the under¬
ground economy. This parallel economy in fact
marked a resurgence of the "market" which
planning was striving to stamp out.
In developing

economy is

method.
A parallel market In Moscow
(Russia).
But whereas the planned economy disap¬
peared in these countries with the collapse of
their communist regimes, the parallel economy
did not go the same way. On the contrary, it
thrived on the ruins of the former system. The
transition to a market economy cannot be car¬
ried out overnight, and people in the former
Eastern-bloc countries will long continue to
rely on the black market to obtain, for example,
Western products which can now be freely
imported there.
The dominant production
i method
ñ Another aspect of the underground economy
J can be observed in the developing countries,
I where it is usually the predominant production
I method, though there are of course variations
| depending on geographical area and degree of
development. But two principal forms can be
defined: one of them, a "primitive" form, is
mainly restricted to subsistence farming, while
the other form, an "urban" one, encompasses
various commercial activities such as craft indus¬
tries, trade and very small-scale services such as
street vending (drinks, fruit, cigarettes),
shoeshining and "guided tours" for Western
tourists.
In the 1970s, some national and interna¬
tional organizations such as the World Bank
regarded such activities as survival activities
that would necessarily die out as countries
developed and modernized.
A completely different view has prevailed
since the end of the 1980s. "The informal
economy has acquired many virtues within
the past few years: it generates jobs and income,
can stand in for the state when it fails in its duty,
and is an area where solidarity can thrive."3 It
23

### 103082: A Hidden enemy

has even been argued by some, including Her¬
nando de Soto, an adviser to Peruvian Presi¬
dent Alberto Fujimori, that an informal
economy is vital to the development process.
It would seem that 39 per cent of the wealth
produced by Peru derives from undeclared
activities. According to de Soto, the informal
economy has been growing because official
regulations are too numerous and too rigid;
they cause unnecessary delays for individuals
and families whose needs are urgent. Take the
example of housing. A small farmer wishing
to settle in Lima will be obliged, if he abides
by the laws of the official economy, to wait
seven years and spend over $2,000 before
being allocated land on which to build his
house. The other solution open to him, which
falls into the category of the informal economy,
is to join the thousands who live in the Peru¬
vian capital's shanty-towns (it costs nothing,
and setting up house there takes only a few
hours). In de Soto's view, the regulations are in
urgent need of simplification.
The other side of the coin
It should however be stressed that the informal
solution adopted in the case just described
automatically brings in its train insecurity and
a lack of public amenities, sanitation and run¬
ning water. The young street vendors to be
found in the great capitals of the South lead an
equally precarious existence. One of the traps
of the informal economy is that those engaged
in it cannot rely on regular remuneration, often
In the 1970s activities linked to the parallel
economy were regarded as survival activities that

experience difficult working conditions and
hardly benefit at all from schooling or literacy
campaigns.
The growth of the underground economy
also goes hand in hand with a degree of laisser-
faire by governments. The adoption of such
policies can be dangerous in countries where
democracy is either non-existent or still shaky.
The risk is that increasing power will fall into
the hands of mafias, in other words, groups
likely to challenge both the authority of the
state and the basic rights of its citizens.
To sum up, although the underground
economy, in the poorest countries, has cre¬
ated a certain number of jobs, and even sus¬
tained a certain sense of solidarity and family
unity, its growth on too extensive a scale pre¬
sents very real dangers for both the economy
and the political system of such countries.

of Madagascar is the author of an
essay entitled Libéralisme et

("Liberalism and Development in
Madagascar", published by
Editions Foi et Justice,
Madagascar).
Corruption in industrialized countries
tends to be concentrated in the higher
echelons of power; in the developing world it
seems to extend to virtually every level of eco¬
nomic and social life. It may be limited in
extent as when it is simply a matter of unclog-
ging the wheels of administration but when
a court verdict is reached as a result of bribery
rather than objective judicial decision, or when
a surgeon only operates when prompted by a
wad of banknotes, it can be a matter of life and
death. Corruption can even damage the eco¬
nomic life of entire countries.
When this is the case, corruption is far more
than an occasional bribe offered to influence a
public decision. It is an institutionalized system
in which networks of cronies seek to enrich
themselves by winning and keeping control
of strategic political or commercial positions
from which they can exercise illegal pressure.
This system, which has international ramifi¬
cations, is expanding. Action against it must be
based on an understanding of the factors that
encourage it to spread and an analysis of the
effects of corruption on development.
Three key factors will be examined in this
article: money, its link with politics, and
poverty.
Oiling the wheels
In a commercial transaction, a sum of money
is paid for something (a commodity or a ser¬
vice) which is itself the fruit of labour. Social
success based on money is thus the visible fruit
of effort. This social philosophy stimulated the
rise of the industrialized countries.
Today, however, money is increasingly dis¬
sociated from labour. With the sudden rise in
the prices of coffee, cocoa, oil and other raw
materials in the early 1970s, huge quantities of

money flooded the international financial mar¬

alized countries off balance. To regain a cer¬
tain stability, these countries were forced to

As a result, money inevitably seeps into
politics, perverting public administration and
governance. Since there is no watertight par¬
tition between public money and money used
to fight elections, politics is funded, without
public consent, by creaming off the national
wealth. Thus, political organizations are funded
by illegal means and to stay in power depend
on political forces whose support is earned by
handouts from the state coffers. Slowly but
I surely, this use of money leads to a system of
I government based on corruption.
I Squandering national
9 resources
Poverty in developing countries is a breeding
ground for corruption. A small minority of
people get rich quick by illegal means from
non-productive activities while the majority of
the population wallows in poverty. Govern¬
ment officials are among the first victims: infla¬
tion erodes their purchasing power while their
employer (the state) is unable to increase their
wages. This largely explains why the hard core
of corruption is found in government.
Other contributory factors to the spread
of corruption are over-regulation and state
interventionism in social and economic life.
While it is undeniable that widespread cor¬
ruption paralyzes development, it may have
some positive effects, albeit limited. Corrup¬
tion brings about a redistribution of untaxed
income, which absorbs some of the social
costs of the notorious "structural adjustments".
Furthermore, the transfer of income from the
less poor to the very poor does promote social
justice of a kind. But this circulation of money
is merely a transfer of wealth, not a means of
wealth-creation. Nor is it very realistic to argue
that the informal economy, boosted by cor¬
ruption that counteracts an over-regulated
market, stimulates commercial activity. In
reality, because of its weak productivity, the
informal sector brings little added value.
The truth is that the more corruption gains
ground, the harder it becomes to manage the
economy. When the logic of production loses
out to the logic of speculation, there can be no
effective economic policy. Disequilibrium in

public finance, for example, is the result of a
disparity between rising expenditure and stag¬
nating tax receipts due to the size of the
informal sector, fraud and tax evasion, not to
mention the corruption of the tax authorities.
Corruption also goes hand in hand with a
squandering of national resources at the very
time when the latter should be exploited sus-
tainably It diverts these resources so that their
contribution to the country's economic
growth is insignificant. The problem becomes
critical when the state, the main economic
actor, is taken hostage by networks of preda¬
tors. Furthermore, redirecting income from
this system towards the consumption of
imported goods puts pressure on the foreign
exchange market, to the detriment of the local

currency. The country's economic develop¬
ment suffers as a result of these interdepen¬
dent factors.
Undermining democracy
Systematic corruption and clientelism under¬
mine the workings of democracy by per¬
verting the exercise of power and the expres¬
sion of the will of the people. Power origi¬
nating from the people is hijacked to satisfy
the personal interests of those who possess it.
It cannot be said too often that democracy
becomes the worst of regimes when it lacks
what may be its sine qua non, virtue. Without
virtue, said Montesquieu, "the Republic is an
empty shell and its strength becomes merely
the power of a few citizens and the licence of
all". Without virtue, professional ethics disap¬
pear, the state loses its authority, and institutions
decline and become flimsy. The exercise of
power becomes the art of governing on the
basis of deception.
When it is embedded in a country's power
system, the parallel economy seeks purely and
simply to control the distribution of a country's
wealth. It keeps the remorseless wheel of
poverty turning: poverty undermines civic
virtue; lack of civic virtue weakens democ¬
racy; a weakened democracy discourages
development; without development, eco¬
nomic life collapses; economic decline further
increases poverty.
This vicious circle can be broken by the
will of the people, if the people realize the
extent of the problem. The barriers between
civil society and political society could then
« be broken down, paving the way for the
i country's responsible governance, the pre-
| condition of effective support from the inter-
I national community.

### 103090: Glasnost and after

Glasnost and after
Institutionalized corruption
was one reason for the
downfall of the Soviet system
In 1987, the "Dictionary of Foreign
Words" published in the USSR defined
corruption as "Venality and misappropriation
of funds by public figures, politicians and civil
servants in the capitalist world. "
The definition was an absurdly naive piece
of propaganda. It reflected a Manichean divi¬
sion of the world into two camps: incorrupt¬
ible socialists here and corrupt capitalists there.
It was also a typical expression of the very real
Soviet understanding of the demarcation
between the official line and everything else.
At a time when corruption was reaching an
unprecedented level in real life, any public
statement on the phenomenon was held to be
defamatory and punishable. Corruption, which
officially did not even have a name, had
become a typical feature of Soviet society.
By an irony of fate, the general public was
becoming aware of corruption at the very time
when dictionaries sought to obscure the reality.
The revelations of the glasnost (openness of
information) period revealed that, in the 1970s
and 1980s, corruption was rife at the apex of
the pyramid of Soviet power: the Politburo
(or political bureau of the Party).
Regional mafias
The economic mafia was the first group in
society to take seriously the declarations of
Mikhail Gorbachev (elected General Secre¬
tary of the Party in 1985) on perestroïka
(restructuring, renewal). In the same year, it
convened a congress of all its groups in the
Soviet Union to assess possible threats to it
from the Party's new general policy. This anx¬
iety stemmed from the fact that Gorbachev

had been close to the late Yuri Andropov, who
had headed the KGB (or State Security Com¬
mittee: the Information Services) between
1967 and 1982. In his day, Andropov had
already opposed the "Dniepropetrovsk
[Ukraine] mafia" by making use of compro¬
mising documents.
When he assumed responsibility for the
KGB, Andropov, with the support of Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Georgian Minister of the
Interior, had begun to reveal the monstrous
abuses committed by the Georgian commu¬
nist party and by its first secretary, whose wife
was the local mafia's protector. For its part, the
Georgian KGB took care to ensure that neither
the hidden sponsor nor the thieves were
unmasked.
After dealing with the Caucasus, Andropov
had even begun to clean up central Asia. But his
sudden death in 1984 put an end to his inves¬
tigations, and the "Dniepropetrovsk mafia"
breathed again.
Inquiries were restarted in 1986. This time
they were authorized by Gorbachev, who had
consolidated his power in the party. They led to
the arrest one year later of Churbanov, the
deputy Minister of the Interior of the USSR
and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-

cent of the regional militia services were
arrested. Almost all the regional and district
party bosses were convicted of theft, fraud
and misappropriation of funds, and of orga¬
nizing and protecting clandestine trafficking.
They got off the hook by claiming that they
were obliged to satisfy the increasing demands
of the Central Committee, the government
and the parliament of the republic.
In fact there was no clear frontier between
the official sphere and the world of crime. The
party bosses and their guests enjoyed the
favours of prostitutes; thieves and murderers
performed special missions for the Party, the
militia and the KGB. In Moscow during the
"years of stagnation" (1 965-1 985), almost one-
third of all prostitutes and black-market cur¬
rency dealers were agents of the militia and
the KGB.
The hub of corruption
Dmingperestroika, the Moscow bureaucracy
tried to confine revelations of widespread pil¬
lage to the southern republics, thus giving the
phenomenon an ethnic slant. The southern
scandals were turned to good advantage by
the empire, which claimed that the nationalist
movements were inspired by local mafias that
wanted to escape supervision by Moscow.
But in the final analysis all affairs on the
outer rim of the USSR led back to the capital,
which effectively protected all the mafias in
the republics and was the true hub of corrup¬
tion. Churbanov's trial not only implicated
Brezhnev's representatives in the republics
but Brezhnev himself, his family and imme¬
diate circle in the spiral of services which the
party elite and the criminals rendered to one
another.
In 1985, Gorbachev gave Boris Yeltsin the
task of cleaning up corruption in Moscow by
putting him in charge of the city's Party Com¬
mittee. Yeltsin took his task to heart. He is said
to have changed the staff of the Committee
three times. Of the thirty-three secretaries of
Moscow's District Committees, only ten
remained in their posts. In the city's Party
Committee alone, nearly 2,000 employees
were arrested for misuse of power.
In late 1988, the Uzbek affair finally reached
the Politburo itself, which persuaded Gor¬
bachev to shelve the matter. The examining
judges were accused of using illegal methods
of investigation, and Yeltsin of totally misun-

derstanding his party comrades. This suspen¬
sion of the fight against the mafia provoked
suspicions of Gorbachev himself. By the same
token it gave Yeltsin a popular authority that
helped him to become President of Russia in
1991.
The communist paradox
Following the failed putsch of 1991, the new
government tried to restore the assets of the
"Party-State" to the state itself. Meanwhile,
however, the capital had been salted away in
Western banks. The rest of the assets accu¬
mulated by the nomenklatura (the official
political, administrative and intellectual elite)
was invested through front names in all kinds
of private and "collective" companies.
Here lies the heart of all the paradoxes of the
period of transition, of the "democratization",
"decommunization", "decolonization" and
"privatization" of the USSR: the former appa¬
ratchiks (permanent party members) in many
cases retained control over an essential part of
the apparatus of government, of parliament,
justice and administration of the economy. It
is they who inveigh against "class inequality in
democracy" and claim to pursue an increas¬
ingly unrelenting campaign against organized
crime. However, to understand the logic of
this rise to power, we have to look back to the
very origins of the Soviet state.
The beginnings of cancer
Soviet power was established in an environ¬
ment of general impoverishment typical of
wartime. It was based on forced labour, mili¬
tarized administration of the state and the
economy, and the requisition and distribution
of goods by the state. The party's military
monopoly over life, freedom and work
explains the background to the birth of Soviet
society in its state forms. Thereafter, the Party-
¡ State constantly recreated this environment
I which had become an essential feature of the
° new society.
The substitution of state ownership for all
forms of private property transformed a
stratum of all-powerful functionaries claiming
to act in the name of the "proletariat" into the
collective masters of Nature and of people.
The economic disorder associated with mili¬
tarization, the overwhelming domination of
heavy to the detriment of light industry and
especially of agriculture, the rising deficit and

the prevalence of pillage would lead to a back¬
lash' on the individual level of theft and wide¬
spread bribery.
In the early days, the cruelty of the author¬
ities to its own apparatus held the functionaries
in check. They concentrated their efforts
instead on the internal struggle to rise through
the echelons of the bureaucratic hierarchy,
where each post had concomitant privileges.
When Khruschev put an end to the Stalinist
purges of the state apparatus, individuals began
instead to plunder state property, engage in
corruption and seek semi-official extra bene¬
fits (special shops, hospitals, rest homes and
so on). The official wages paid to workers were
so low that they came to rely increasingly on
theft. In a sense, the indulgence with which
they were treated made them the accomplices
of the system.
Generalized
bribery
This gave rise to a whole system of parallel dis¬
tribution of state production. A growing deficit
and the flight of officially manufactured goods
into hidden channels of distribution turned
corruption into a dual system of mutual ser¬
vices. It was both vertical (in the apparatus of
bureaucracy) and horizontal (in the produc¬
tion apparatus) through exchanges of stolen
products or services rendered by one pro¬
ducer to another.
"MONiicui i * . ' « i Cotiiqiorc Com
«#npfl
These exchanges resulted in an entire illegal
production system which had already begun
to supply the black market in the days of
Khruschev. Under Brezhnev, the official
economy could no longer function without
the parallel economy. No factory or kolkhoz
director could avoid paying bribes to the com¬
panies with which he did business and on
which he was dependent. Only a few isolated
individuals refrained from diverting apart of
the public service to their own advantage.
Such eccentrics did not keep their jobs for
long because their abnormal conduct threat¬
ened the general collusion. (Most prisoners
of conscience and dissidents began their polit¬
ical protest by behaving in this way).
The system of bribes and services rendered
became an original substitute for the money
economy. An underground private economy
developed and has been partially legalized in
the current transition period to enable func¬
tionaries to retain their power to prohibit,
authorize and manipulate. Officials exercise
their arbitrary will in a twilight zone between
legality and illegality, so that it is prejudicial only
to the conduct of legal business. The vast sums
which astute businessmen now invest in new
spheres or in Western banks slip between two
powers and two laws. In that environment,
privatization does not help to create a market
economy but merely hastens the pillaging of
the national economy.
Contradictory trends
At the same time, society has admittedly been
democratized to some extent. The rights
movement has unmasked the lies of the com¬
munist system, developed the conscience of
the intelligentsia and stimulated a demand in
civil society for democratic freedoms.
Perestroika therefore seems to have been
the expression of two contradictory demands,
simultaneously reflecting the hopes of civil
society for greater democracy and the appetite
of the communist elite for the legalization of its
privileges. The outcome of these opposing
social trends will determine the nature of the
economy and the institutional forms of the
future development of the countries of the
former Soviet empire. In the absence of a self-
regulating market economy, they will continue
to waver between a form of mafia-based state
capitalism and the restructuring of an oppres¬
sive communist-fascist empire.

world-wide phenomenon."
Above, drawing by Jean-Pierre
Gaùzère.
"Paradoxically, repression
increases the opportunities for
corruption."
Corruption is as old as the idea of the
state itself. When the French philoso¬
pher Montesquieu set forth his theory of the
separation of powers in the eighteenth cen¬
tury, he did so to fight corruption. He was not,
of course, the first to join battle. The function
of constitutional law has always been to orga¬
nize the sharing of power in order to control
the way it is exercised and prevent it from
being misused.
The fields in which corruption occurs
change with the growing complexity of the state
apparatus (which takes on new monitoring and
management functions), but its main form con¬
tinues to be abuse of power. Unfortunately,
s- legal experts have not yet discovered the infal-
f lible tool for nipping the evil in the bud.
I The history of institutional law could be
summed up as one of constant efforts by legal
experts to build barriers against corruption and
combat those who devote all their ingenuity to
getting round such barriers. Some models, of
course, are less well adapted to circumstances
and allow corruption to gain a greater foothold
than others, which tend to reduce its room for
manoeuvre.

leaders of the rich countries, who saw it as a
convenient way of recruiting obedient clients.
Growing doubts about this kind of relation¬
ship in recent years have caused a breakdown
in the mechanisms of "traditional" corruption.
We are very interested in corruption today,
almost as if it were a new phenomenon,
because it is beginning to disrupt economic
and political life in the developed countries as
well as in the developing countries where it
has been going on for a long time.
Probably the only new element in the pre¬
sent situation is the fact that corruption is now
feeding on itself corruption in the developing
countries is directly sustaining that in the indus¬
trialized nations. One of the objectives of the
new world economic order is perhaps to try
to stop corruption in the poorest countries,
thus sparing them the exorbitant and uncon-
trolable accumulation of money that all kinds
of illegal trafficking has led to in the rich nations.
Serious investment is needed to finance
the apparatus of production, and this means a



reliable, predictable legal system to deter spec¬
ulators. Investors regard the misuse of power

(and the corruption it encourages) as a threat;
speculators see it as an opportunity. If the
world economy is to be healthy and stable, it
is clear that responsible investment must win
out over speculation, otherwise the economy
will be unstable with possibly disastrous
results.
Speculation has become a world-wide phe¬
nomenon in recent years. This fact should be
enough to dispel the illusion that the blunt
instrument of the criminal law is the only
weapon needed to roll back corruption. Glob¬
alization requires more rigorous control of
corruption, and the only way to achieve this
goal is to reduce the areas where corruption
prospers. This means an across-the-board
improvement of all institutions. No one simply
wants to increase the repressive power of
states.
To develop the state's repressive apparatus
within a framework of defective institutions
where there are no checks on power is to
increase opportunities for abuse and encourage
arbitrariness, violence and eventually cor¬
ruption. Advocating repression as a solution is
a good ploy for politicians trying to whip up
support from some parts of the electorate, but
apart from that it is dangerously simplistic
because paradoxically it increases the oppor¬
tunities for corruption.
And so, even if the criminal law plays no
small part in the fight against corruption, the
first move must be to carry out political and
institutional reforms designed to promote a
better balance of power, greater freedom of
information and speech and the widest pos¬
sible participation by citizens in monitoring
and managing public affairs.
A fight
for democracy
One of the most difficult types of power to
monitor is in fact the repressive power, which
is by definition selective. The law comes down
more heavily on some sectors of the popula¬
tion than others (just as the victims of crime are
generally sociologically typecast), and this

process whereby criminals and victims are
selected has an arbitrary quality which can lead
to misuse of power and to corruption.
Moreover and this is perhaps the most
important point repression is much less



effective as an instrument for regulating a polity
than it is as an instrument of police surveil¬
lance. It is a dangerous illusion to think that
essentially political phenomena can be regu¬
lated by repression. To give the police and
bureaucratic machine the capacity for com¬
plete control especially with the facilities
made available by modern technology is to
expose it to a vast new field for dishonesty and
abuse. The belief that corruption can be fought
by increasing the discretionary power of those
institutions which are most exposed to it is as
absurd as seeking protection from wild ani¬
mals by taking refuge inside their cages.
But corruption is not inevitable. If this
threat, which is inherent in the very nature of
power, is to be avoided, solutions must be
sought in state political, institutional and
bureaucratic structures and in a healthy civil
society.
In short, the fight against corruption is a
political struggle akin to the fight for a law-
abiding state based on equality before the law.
Yet a state based on the rule of law is never
attained once and for all. Its existence depends
on a regulatory principle that is in permanent

opposition to the temptation of authoritari¬
anism. Ultimately, the fight against corruption
is an unrelenting effort to approach as near as
possible to the values of a law-abiding state,
to monitor and reduce the repressive forces
that are inherent in this state and try to infil¬
trate into the slightest fissure in its institutional
edifice.
Neutralizing corruption depends less on
the severity of the repressive arsenal than on
the existence of a truly democratic system,
with strong political parties, a responsible civil
society, respect for the rights and freedoms of
everyone, an independent judiciary, and effec¬
tive financial regulatory bodies. Another
absolutely vital factor is the neutralization of
the transnational levers of corruption, and this,
of course, calls for new forms of co-operation
on a world-wide scale.

### 103092: What can be done?

What canoeb
ROBERT KLITGAARD
of the United States is professor
of economics at the University of
Natal (South Africa). He is the
author of several books Including
Tropical Gangsters (1991) and
Controlling Corruption.
Corruption is in the news again, and
fitfully, almost schizophrenically, we,
the public, respond. On the one hand we are
outraged. We call for firings and purges, for a
new constitution and perhaps a new morality.
On the other hand, we are resigned, and we



passively reflect that nothing really can be done
about corruption. Isn't it everywhere a fact of
life?
In this article I should like to examine three
aspects of the problem. Firstly, what is cor¬
ruption? Secondly, what can a government
that wishes to control corruption actually do?
And thirdly, what if a government doesn't want
to control corruption as much as we, the
public, would like it to do? What can we do as
citizens?
What is corruption?
Corruption can be defined as the misuse of
office for personal gain. Usage varies across
countries and over time, and, at any partic-

ular place and time, law and custom may not
coincide. Still, it is remarkable that throughout
history, and around the world today, people
have tended to agree that certain actions are
corrupt .
The real danger is the rise of systematic cor¬
ruption, when the "rules of the game" are dele-
gitimized by the perception that corruption
can sway policies as well as particular contracts,
can reshape legislation, and can make a
mockery of the justice system1. Systematic
corruption generates economic costs by dis¬
torting incentives, political costs by under¬
mining institutions, and social costs by redis¬
tributing wealth and power toward the rich
and privileged. When corruption undermines
property rights, the rule of law, and incentives
to invest, economic and political development
are crippled.
Corruption exists in all countries and, as
recent events have revealed, is a major problem
in many rich nations. But corruption tends to
be more damaging in some developing coun¬
tries because it has a more devastating effect on
property rights, the rule of law and incentives
to invest. Systematic corruption now seems
to threaten political and economic reforms in'
a number of countries in Eastern Europe,
Africa, Latin America and Asia.
What is also news is that the international
community is now discussing corruption
openly, whereas even a decade ago the issue
was virtually taboo2. Why is corruption sur¬
facing now as an international priority? One
idea that has been put forward is that system¬
atic corruption is growing worse. Another

cites the rapid rise of international trade and
international communications, so that people
are exposed to economic temptations as never
before. Yet another points to the political and
economic reforms that have swept the world
and have created new opportunities for cor¬
ruption by rapidly changing the accustomed
rules of the game and, in many cases, because
policy changes are not accompanied by suffi¬
cient development of the institutions and the
public-sector incentives needed to make free
markets and democracy work.
Or are we simply becoming less tolerant
of corruption? One possibility is that we per¬
ceive corruption to be a greater obstacle now
that the Cold War has abated and economic
policies and multiparty polities are roughly
"got right". Another possibility is that we
blame corruption for the fact that neither freer
markets nor democratic reforms have yet lived
up to expectations, in order that we can avoid
admitting that those policies and polities may
not be right everywhere. Or perhaps we have
become more aware of corruption because
political reforms have granted new freedoms
to document it and complain about it.
Whatever the reasons for today's greater
concern over corruption, it is a change
we should welcome. Corruption is a problem
that has for too long been overlooked. What
exactly can be done to attack deeply rooted
corruption?
Virtually all countries have laws that con¬
demn extortion, bribery, speed money, fraud
and embezzlement, kickbacks, nepotism and
other forms of corruption. But dual exchange
rates, for example, are an invitation to illicit
behaviour. So are quantitative restrictions on
imports, the noncompetitive provision of ser¬
vices and regulations, necessary though they
may be in particular cases. It is true that large
public sectors invite more corruption than
small-sized governments. It is also true that
multiparty democracy will in the long run tend
to reduce corruption.


What can governments do?
But whatever the mix of public and private
sectors, and whatever the size of government,
corruption remains a perennial threat. Com¬
bating it requires a deeper level of analysis and
action than calling for a smaller state or for mul¬
tiparty democracy. Fortunately we can learn
from both theory and experience.
Theory teaches us that a rough formula for
corruption holds. Monopoly plus discretion
minus accountability equals corruption.
Monopoly, whether public or private, grants
the power to charge a higher than optimal price
for a service and to provide less of it. Discre¬
tion means that an official has the power to say
yes or no, or how much, without what lawyers
call "bright lines" to limit his power. And a lack
of accountability means that these transactions
take place in the dark.
And so anti-corruption efforts must
attempt to mitigate monopoly, whether public
or private: to privatize a public monopoly and
let a private monopoly ensue will do little. They
must limit discretion and provide clear rules of
the game and bright lines for bureaucratic
behaviour. And above all, anti-corruption

efforts must provide more accountability.
Information is one enemy of corruption.
Here are some of the political lessons we
can draw from successful campaigns to reduce
corruption.
First,fry big fish. Leading figures involved
in corruption must be publicly named and
punished before a cynical public believes that
an anti-corruption effort is more than words,
more than a campaign against one's political
opponents. It is important, therefore, that the
first big fish must come from within the party
in power.
For example, Hong Kong used to be awash
in corruption. Then, in 1973, an Independent
Commission against Corruption was formed.
It had new teeth and new eyes, but despite its
powers, at first no one believed that the ICAC
would succeed any more than previous efforts.
Credibility came when the ex-police chief of
Hong Kong was extradited from retirement
in England and punished in Hong Kong. The
ICAC also nailed the ex-number two and
scores of other high-ranking police officials.
To a sceptical public and a hardened civil ser¬
vice, frying these big fish sent a credible signal:
"The rules of the game really have changed".
Italy's recent and unprecedented success in
attacking corruption has attracted world-wide
attention. A crucial step was frying a top Mafia
official, many top business executives and sev¬
eral major politicians from the ruling party.
This told citizens that if they came forward
and denounced crime and corruption, they
could make a difference.
Second, begin bureaucratic reforms with
positive steps that help civil servants. In par
ticular, work with bureaucrats to define orga¬
nizational objectives and ways to measure suc¬
cess, and then link part of their compensation
to the achievement of results. It is ludicrous to
ask public servants to fight corruption if they
cannot earn a decent wage through honest
efforts.
Third, after frying a few big fish, get away
from the investigation ofthe past andfocus on
prevention. Here structural changes are
worthy of systematic analysis. Also, a gov¬
ernment may wish to consider the creation of
a special anti-corruption agency whose role is
not just investigating corruption but working
with departments on systematic reforms in
policies and procedures in order to reduce the
vulnerability to corruption.
An anti-corruption strategy
Fourth, have a strategy. This may sound
simple, but in fact most so-called anti-cor¬
ruption campaigns lack just that. Having a
strategy means developing a clear idea of ends
and means in the short, medium and long
terms. It means we must distinguish various
types of corruption and recognize, even if we
do not say so in public, that all types are not
equally harmful. For example, corruption in
the courts or in the police is usually more per¬
nicious than corruption in the customs or in
the driver's licence department. In general
inspectors of all varieties must be cleaner than
service-providers must be.
Having a strategy means that a government
must recognize that it cannot attack all forms
of corruption at once, even if it does not say so
publicly. And a government interested in
fighting corruption needs a success in the first
six months.
Some political leaders seem to believe that
they can excuse the apparent absence of an
anti-corruption strategy by saying that they
were not aware it was going on. This ignorance
is no solace. Corruption is a problem of sys¬
tems of information, incentives and rules. To
combat it, one must think through these sys¬
tems and change them.
Some governments are doing so. I see hope
in the wave of new leaders around the world,
who are putting good governance at the centre
of their agendas. True, sometimes the anti-cor¬
ruption crusaders themselves prove corrupt¬
ible. But a global change in the will to address
corruption is definitely taking place. There is

also a remarkable new activism on this for¬
merly taboo subject by international organi¬
zations such as the World Bank and the United
Nations, as well as bilateral donors such as
Britain and France.
An international code
of conduct
But can citizens themselves do anything to
move a recalcitrant government toward
action? The answer is yes. To see how, I believe
we should ask several further questions. Aren't
we the people, the civil society, the private
sector part of the problem? We often criti¬
cize government corruption without recog¬
nizing our own involvement and culpability
and without exploring our own possibilities
for fostering change.
On this score I also find grounds for opti¬
mism. As an example, let me briefly describe
an exciting new initiative: Transparency Inter¬
national, a non-governmental anti-corruption
organization analogous to Amnesty Interna¬
tional that was launched in May 1 993 in Berlin.
Amnesty International, which has chapters
in most countries, investigates allegations of
human rights abuses and publishes case studies
and country reports. Although sometimes
derided by governments, its work has had a
tremendous influence by shedding light on
dark corners of abuse, and has brought
Amnesty International the Nobel Prize for
Peace.
Might a similar idea work with regard to
corruption? Imagine the following scenario:
members of civil society and the private sector
get together, devise and sign a simple code of
conduct in which we promise not to pay bribes,
not to underestimate costs in bidding and later
reinflate them, and so forth. If such alleged
transgressions subsequently occur, we agree
to study the systems behind the allegations
for example, the system of procurement or
contracting or customs clearance. We carry
out confidential surveys of business people
and citizens that identify how the corrupt
system works, then suggest systematic reme¬
dies. We publish the results and push for
change.
This is one of the ideas being pursued by
Transparency International (TI), which is based
on the principle that the private sector must
begin to clean up its own act. By putting inter¬
national credibility behind a code of conduct,
TI will make it easier for private companies to
turn down extortionate requests. By publishing
illuminating reports, even if they have no legal
status, it could increase pressures for reform.
Some forty TI country chapters have been or
are being formed around the world.
I predict that by the turn of the century
many country programmes will be success¬
fully fighting corruption and that we will even¬
tually look back on the 1990s as an era of the
structural adjustment of government, when
the fight against corruption was shaped by sys¬
tematic reform of incentives, accountability
and popular participation.

made a distinction between one sort of corruption,
which is analogous to a foul in sports, and another
sort, which is the breakdown of the rules defining
and enforcing fouls, where the sports contest
virtually collapses. The latter is the systematic
phenomenon of corruption that they fear is
undermining development. Luis Moreno Ocampo
calls this "hypercorruption". Herbert W. Werlin's
label is "secondary corruption", and he compares it
to alcoholism. See Luis Moreno Ocampo, En

### 103095: The Press for peace: 'We shall not let voices be silenced'

FEDERICO MAYOR: COMMENTARY
THE PRESS FOR PEACE
'We shall not let voices
be silenced'
When a journalist is killed, not only
does a person die but a voice is
silenced and a part of democracy dis¬
appears. The silencing of voices is a well-known
way of subverting peace. We shall not allow voices
to be silenced.
It is UNESCO's duty to condemn all violence
against women and men whose only weapons are
their pens, their cameras, their intelligence, their
talent and, above all, their faith in tolerance and the
exchange of ideas.
But human and spontaneous though it may be,
indignation is not enough. We must react, we
must help those who believe in exchange and
practise tolerance, and who want to do their job in
difficult and sometimes dangerous circumstances.
We must step up our efforts to ensure that jour¬
nalists can work in greater security and that phys¬
ical conditions are no longer an obstacle to the
exercise of their profession.
It is also UNESCO's duty to do all it can to pre¬
serve and promote freedom of information and
expression, thereby protecting plurality of ideas
and opinions. UNESCO cannot, for instance, accept
the disappearance of NTV Studio B, an indepen¬
dent television station in Belgrade that it has sup¬
ported ever since the beginning of the conflict in
the former Yugoslavia (notably through a grant of
$450,000 and by including it in a programme to
exchange news items among independent TV sta
tions in Belgrade, Sarajevo and Skopje, which was
organized by UNESCO and World-wide Television
News-WTN). NTV Studio B lost its indepen¬
dence a few months ago. Millions of TV viewers
have therefore been deprived of pluralistic infor¬
mation at a crucial moment in the peace process.
Here again, indignation is not enough. For this
amounts to an attack on the freedom of the press,
which is an integral part of democracy and a cul¬
ture of peace. UNESCO therefore will encourage
the dialogue necessary to restore mutual under¬
standing, without which there can be no democ¬
racy. By "democracy" I mean a general frame¬
work of public freedoms, not a specific govern¬
ment. I am thinking of the only voice that
concerns us, the voice of the people. There can be
no stable democracy if the press does not play its
watchdog role, its vigilant observers describing
not only what is happening but also what may
happen, that is, all future possibilities and choices.
An independent press
But it is our conviction and this is something that
cannot be said too often that the press must give
priority to non-violence, to settling conflicts by
means of dialogue, listening and understanding.
Without an independent press there can be no
lasting peace, no future for democracy, no sharing
of development. A press working for peace is an
essential part of our hopes for everyone.

### 103096: UNESCO past and present

Unesco past and
The watershed year of 1945
saw the awakening of a new
spirit of planetary awareness
that was to become one of the hall¬
marks of our century. The time had
come for nations to be more recep¬
tive to one another and abolish the
distances between them. In the
euphoria of the postwar age a group
of men and women who dreamed
of a better future laid the founda¬
tions of UNESCO, an organization
that would participate in the world¬
wide task of reconstruction and
"contribute to peace and security
by promoting collaboration among
the nations through education, sci¬
ence and culture". UNESCO came
into being on 16 November 1945 at
the close of an international con¬
ference in London, and held its first
General Conference a year later in
Paris, from 20 November to 10
December 1946 in Paris. Four days
later it officially became a special¬
ized agency of the United Nations.
As its contribution to the
gigantic task of postwar recon¬
struction, UNESCO was called upon
to repair intellectual and moral
damage. The war had shown that
ignorance could take a terrible toll
and that powerful weapons could
lurk in school textbooks. With these
preoccupations in mind, the Gen¬
eral Conference approved a pro¬
gramme for the dissemination of
knowledge through education and
mass information including a pro
ject for an in-depth review of text¬
books and other school books.
By 1947 UNESCO was sending
missions to Austria, Czechoslo¬
vakia, Greece, Italy, Poland and
Yugoslavia to inquire into the most
immediate needs of their people. A
pamphlet entitled The Teacher and
the Post-war Child was published
with funding from the Greek gov¬
ernment and was subsequently
translated into German, Italian,
Hebrew and Romanian. A number
of youth service camps were orga¬
nized, and pilot projects in funda¬
mental education were launched in
Haiti, China and East Africa.
The programme submitted to
the first General Conference also
outlined action to promote the free
circulation of books and other
information materials. A pro¬
gramme of exchanges for librarians
was set up and preparations were
made for a survey of library
schools. An appeal was addressed to
all countries, inviting them to pub¬
lish selected national bibliographies;
the first edition of the UNESCO Bul¬
letin for Libraries appeared, and
UNESCO established a Central
Information Service.
As part of the same broad pro¬
gramme plans were made to replace
scientific and technical equipment
in war-devastated regions, to set up

a world-wide radio network, and
to study the tensions that lead to
war. In 1947 field science co-oper¬
ation offices were established in Rio
de Janeiro, Cairo, Nanking and
New Delhi, and grants amounting
to $231,319 were allocated to var¬
ious scientific institutions. One
important project in the social sci¬
ences was launched to study all
aspects of "international under¬
standing", while others included a
world inventory of research per¬
sonnel and resources and the study
of comparative law.
The same year, the Section of
Philosophy and Humanistic Studies
prepared a report on the philo
sophical principles underlying
human rights, based on replies to a
questionnaire that had been sent to
200 philosophers and thinkers and
to the governments of Member
States. UNESCO's Translation Unit
examined the re-establishment and
possible enlargement of the Index
Translationum, a comprehensive
guide to world translations that had
been previously published by the
International Institute of Intellec¬
tual Co-operation. The Interna¬
tional Theatre Institute was estab¬
lished, and an international literary
pool was inaugurated. The
Museums Section was strength¬
ened, and in co-operation with the
International Council of Museums
(ICOM) became an international
centre for information and advice in
this field.
In the single year 1946-1947,
words had led to action. The first
projects in education, culture, sci¬
ence, and communication had been
launched. UNESCO was rapidly
taking shape.
"UNESCO was convinced that it
had before it a great mission and
unlimited possibilities while at the
same time being aware of the
immediate urgency of its task,"
writes Fernando Valderrama,
whose History of UNESCO traces
the development of UNESCO fro m
the foundations laid by its prede¬
cessors (the League of Nations
Committee on Intellectual Co
operation and the International
Institute of Intellectual Co-opera¬
tion) to 1993. It is a story that
reflects an entire historical period.
Photos from UNESCO's archives
and the results of its programmes
illustrate a growing record of
achievement.
Based on material from archives
and libraries, this richly docu¬
mented book written by a leading
Spanish researcher and former
UNESCO staff member shows how
programmes, projects and resolu¬
tions have not been mere words
but have shaped whole chapters of
contemporary world history.
"The purpose of this history,"
writes UNESCO's Director-General,



Federico Mayor, in his preface, "is to
retrace the whole development of
an organization with a universal mis¬
sion, in which the past informs the
present, acting as a vital force
injecting into it the emotion and
drive that spurred its inception, its
expansion, the experience of its
mature years and the reflection on
its role in a changing world that it has
necessarily had to undertake."

#
#
c> A MONASTERY IN THE
A prestigious monument
of Orthodox Christianity
in the Balkans, Rila
monastery is also one of
Bulgaria's richest
architectural sites and a
focal point of Bulgarian
history. It was placed on
UNESCO's World Heritage
List in 1983.
CHRISTOPHE CHICLET,
a French journalist, has published
many articles on the Balkans and a
study, tes communistes grecs dans
la guerre [1987; "The Greek
Communists in the War").
In the tenth century, a man named Ivan île d
from the court of the Bulgarian kings to
live a life of penitence in a remote valley of the
Rila massif, whose summit is the highest peak
in Bulgaria (2,925 metres), about 100 kilo¬
metres south of Sofia. A growing number of
disciples joined the hermit, who took the
name of Ivan Rilski, or John of Rila. They
settled a few kilometres below his grotto on
a site where they laid the first foundations
of the future monastery.
Ivan Rilski died in 946. His relics were
first taken to Sofia and then removed else¬
where. They were eventually returned to Rila
in 1469, and his tomb attracted many devo¬
tees. In the thirteenth and fourteenth cen¬
turies, the monastery became a great spiritual
centre and, thanks to donations from several
Bulgarian kings, a power in the land. Though
repeated conflicts set them apart over own¬
ership of the land, Serbian and Bulgarian sov¬
ereigns were equally devoted to Rila. This is
confirmed by their presence, side by side, on
the monastery frescoes.
The ancient monastery was ravaged by fire
in 1335, but saved by Khrelio, a feudal lord
who chose it as a fortress and refurbished
the buildings. In particular, he built a 22-
metre-high keep followed, in 1343, by an
adjoining chapel.
In the late fourteenth century, the
Ottoman Turks advanced into the Balkans,
but they respected the Christian faith and left

confirmed in the next century by the Sultan's
written order.
THE KLLGARIAN NATIONAL
RENAISSANCE
From the fourteenth to the nineteenth cen¬
turies, as part of the Ottoman empire, the
monastery became the leading cultural centre
of southeast Europe. Books were written
there and then circulated throughout the
Slav Orthodox world. The monastery housed
a library and archives; religious and secular
schools were founded there, and icons and
wood carvings were made. Festivals at the
monastery attracted pilgrims from the whole
Balkan peninsula. Rila had links with the
other great centres of Orthodox Christianity
Constantinople, Mount Athos and Ohrid
and the old Bulgarian liturgy was preserved
intact.
The role of the monastery broadened con¬
siderably from the eighteenth century
onwards. Under the guidance of Neofit Rilski,
a monk and pioneer of what came to be known
as the Bulgarian Renaissance (second half of
the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth
century), the monastery was enlarged and
modernized. Such famous master-masons as
Pavel Milenko, Alexi Rilek and Kristju
Debirlju helped to ornament it, while pop¬
ular devotion attracted a host of volunteer
workmen. Three wings were added between
1816 and 1820.
But in 1833 these new structures were
destroyed by fire. The catastrophe aroused
intense emotion throughout the country. Gifts,
materials, builders and workmen poured in,
and the damage was repaired in less than two
years. This rapidity symbolized the national
awakeningin Bulgaria, of which the first signs
had appeared at Rila with the publication
in 1762 of the History of the Bulgarian Slavs
by a monk, Paisij.
In the early nineteenth century, the
monastery saw itself as a kind of enclave of
national awareness and attracted the great
thinkers and artists of the Bulgarian Renais¬
sance. This cultural vocation is the main reason
why it still has an important place today in the
collective consciousness of the Bulgarian
people, and enjoys such exceptional prestige.
¡VINE CENTER I ES OF MONASTIC
ARCHITECTURE
There is little trace of the early buildings
erected between the tenth and fourteenth
centuries because of the many fires and suc¬
cessive modernizations. However, a number
of historical layers can be defined.
Between 1834 and 1860, various builders
constructed the monastery complex that can
be seen today. The main building is a rec¬
tangular fortress covering 4,500 m2, with two
43

main entrances for pro¬
tection against hostile
incursions. Its four four-storey
wings are surrounded by great por¬
tico balconies giving onto a vast inner
courtyard (3,200 m-) with polychrome
façades. Each balcony is reached by a series
of external staircases.
The monastery has more than 300 monks'
cells and guest rooms, built and decorated
in the styles of various Bulgarian towns (thus
offering an architectural geography of the
country), four chapels in the wings, the library,
parlours, refectories and other utility rooms.
The ground floor opens onto a gigantic kitchen
where meals could be prepared for hundreds
of persons. The domed chimney is built to a
'bold design; supported by arches, it is 22
metres high.
Lord Khrelio's keep, a stone tower in the
internal courtyard, has survived the fire and
the vicissitudes of history since 1335. It has
five storeys. On the top floor, the family ora¬
tory is adorned with fourteenth-century fres¬
coes representing a circle of dancers and a
group of musicians, a very unusual theme in
mural painting in the Byzantine tradition in
this region.
The chapel which once flanked the tower
was destroyed in the early nineteenth cen¬
tury to make room for the main church of
the Dormition, completed in 1837. The
church has three central domes, three naves
and choirs. The walls and galleries are deco¬
rated with frescoes representing 1,200 dif¬
ferent scenes and a group of portraits. The
carved wood iconostasis (a partition covered
with icons which separates the nave from the
sanctuary) is one of the largest and finest in
the Balkans.
But the Rila site is not confined to the
perimeter and buildings round the inner court¬
yard. Outside the walls is the convent of Orl-
itza. It was built in the fifteenth century and
has fifteenth- and seventeenth-century fres¬
coes. A little further on are the church of
the Presentation in the Temple and St. Luke's
Hermitage with its two little eighteenth-cen¬
tury churches and monastic school. Still fur¬
ther away is the hermitage of Saint Ivan Rilski
with the famous grotto to which the anchorite
retired. In 1795, the monks added a church
with a porch in which the relics of the saint
are kept.
Monasteries are also working communi¬
ties, as is shown at Rila by the Ptchelina farm
complex of outbuildings, peasant dwellings
and a little church (1834), the monastery
oven (1866) and the clandestine powder mill
for the monastery's armed guard.
Nine prestigious centuries
O 10th century: the monastery is founded by the
Bulgarian hermit, Ivan Rilski (876-946) or St.
John of Rila.
O 14th century: 1335, the monastery is enlarged
and fortified by Lord Khrelio. The stone keep, in
a very good state of preservation, is the only
remaining vestige (Khrelio tower).
O 13th-14th centuries: spiritual and artistic
zenith of the monastery
O 14th-15th centuries: start of the Ottoman
occupation
1469: The relics of St. John of Rila are returned
to the monastery.
O 18th-19th centuries: Bulgarian national
renaissance. The monastery is the religious,
intellectual and artistic centre of this
movement.
1833: disastrous fire
1834-1860: the monastery is restored and
rebuilt.
O 20th century: 1961, the monastery becomes a
national museum and protected site.
1983: Rila monastery is placed on Unesco's
World Heritage List.
A MUSEUM COMPLEX
The monastery belongs to the Bulgarian state.
In 1961 it was classified as a national museum
and protected site, and today houses a his¬
torical and ethnographic museum complex.
The rooms have retained their old character
but are equipped with modern technical facil¬
ities. Exhibitions are held here and this is
also a centre for research and study in muscog-
raphy and sociology.
The rich collections of objects and man¬
uscripts bear witness to the centuries-old his¬
tory of the monastery. They include the
famous cross which the monk, Raphail, took
twelve years to make (1790-1802), Lord
Khrelio's epitaph and parchments in tenth-
century Glagolitic script. There are also col¬
lections of goldware, ethnographic objects,
close on 4,000 archive documents, icons, wood
carvings, eighteenth-century illuminated man¬
uscripts, carpets and costumes 41,000
pieces in all.
The communists did not ban the
monastery, which was governed by the codes
of the monastic community. Rila is distin¬
guished among the hundred or so major Bul¬
garian monasteries not only asa centre of the
spiritual and intellectual rebirth of the Bul¬
garian identity, long suppressed by the Byzan¬
tines and Ottomans, but as a holy place where

Village", an

Rougerie to house

Virgin Islands
(U.S.A.).
by France Bequette
One-third of the world's popu¬
lation today lives less than ten
kilometres from a lake or ocean
shoreline. In the last fifty years the
movement of populations to coastal
regions has been growing, and sev¬
eral countries have already tried to
increase their land area by expanding
seawards.
Existing offshore installations and
artificial islands, together with the
marine cities of the future, were
studied by 237 scientists from 21
countries at a symposium called
"Ocean Cities '95" which was held
in Monaco in November 1995 by a
French association, Fondation 2100,
and France's Society of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, with the
honorary patronage of UNESCO and
the United Nations Centre for
Human Settlements (Habitat).
According to French engineer and
futurologist Thierry Gaudin, living
on or under the sea is now within our
reach as a result of recent progress
in technology. Engineers can claim
land from the sea by using rocks or
concrete caissons (as long as coastal
waters are not too deep) as fill, by
using floating caissons , or by building
under the sea. "We can harness solar,
wind and wave power," Gaudin says,
"desalinate sea water, feed ourselves
by means of aquaculture or hydro¬
ponic agriculture, and communicate
via dish antennae and satellites.
Meanwhile, new materials such as
polymers, elastomers, carbon fibres
and a new kind of unreinforced con¬
crete are fantastically successful in
the marine environment." Many
examples of marine installations
already exist; many more are at the
planning state. Some of them are
described below.
FONTVIEILLK (MONACO)
The Principality of Monaco, one of
the world's smallest states, provides
a striking example of seaward expan¬
sion. Located on a peninsula between
France and Italy, it has claimed land
from the Mediterranean on several
occasions.
Unlike most of the world's mar¬
itime extensions and artificial
islands except for oil-prospection
and -drilling platforms which are
found in depths up to 20 metres,
Monaco's Fontvieille project, which
was begun in 1966 and covers a 23-
hectare area, involved working at
depths of up to 35 metres.
Fontvieille is now a fully-equipped
urban settlement, with housing, com¬
mercial premises and offices, as well
as a sports complex including a
20,000-seat stadium. Plans for
extending the site even further are
being mooted, but building a plat¬
form over 40 metres deep poses a
number of problems, including that
of swell.

ARTIFICIAL LAKES AND
OFFSHORE TOURIST CENTRES
Another interesting scheme was pre¬
sented by French architect Michel
Pinseau, who would like to create a
tourist archipelago in the desert of
southernMorocco. Pinseau noted that
there are three large geological depres¬
sions 55 metres below sea level in the
Sahara north of Layoun, and thought
that they could be transformed into
artificial lakes via canals connecting
them to the Atlantic ten kilometres
away, thus providing tourists with a
hundred kilometres of sunny bea ches
all the year round. The biggest problem
would be supplying the resort with
drinking water, because there is not
enough groundwater in the area. One
possible solution would be to exploit the
difference between high and low tides
(3 metres) to operate small tidal power
stations producing enough energy to
desalinate the sea water.
Engineer Richard Dziewolski's
"Marinarium" projects are even more
futuristic. These "autonomous mar¬
itime tourist centres" are designed
to blend perfectly into the seascape
and respect the environment. Each
centre consists of a floating unit
equipped with breakwaters, houses,
two ports for ferries and pleasure
boats and a private beach. The Mari-
nariums are completely autonomous
thanks to facilities for filtering and
desalinating sea-water, treating
sewage and household waste and pro¬
ducing energy, and reservoirs for
stocking fresh water and fuel.
Each Marinarium is designed to
be assembled in a shipyard and then
towed to the site and attached by
cables to submersed dead weights.
Using this system, it would be pos¬
sible to anchor the floating city on a
site where the sea is up to 2,000
metres deep. The Marinarium pro¬
jects are based on tried and tested
offshore drilling technology.
A striking example of this tech¬
nology is a concrete oil-production
barge designed for deep-water use
(150 to 300 metres) in the Nkossa
oilfield, 60 kilometres off the Congo
coast. A floating island 220 metres
long and 46 metres wide (total
weight approximately 110,000
tonnes), the barge is unique. It is
being towed to its destination and
will house 30,000 tonnes of equip¬
ment and 160 people.
TOWN PLANNING AND
DEVELOPMENT
Japan has sought to claim land from
the sea for many years, and John Pina
Craven, a Hawaiian researcher, pre¬
sented to the Ocean Cities meeting a
report comparing filling operations in
Osaka Bay (Japan) and in Boston
(U.S.A.). In the nineteenth century
Boston wanted to expand its usable
land area by filling in Back Bay with
soil from nearby hills; a similar oper¬
ation has been carried out at Kobe
to make an artificial island, Port
Island. There is a big difference
between soil that has been compacted
for centuries and earth brought in
from outside, which behaves like
quicksand. The solution is to build
"floating" structures, like the library
of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), which rises and
sinks according to the weight of books
(and people) in it. However, this solu¬
tion was not adopted at Kansai air¬
port, which has been built at great
expense (some $20,000 million) in
Osaka Bay, and where fluidation of
the fill following the 1995 earthquake
has caused serious instability. Per¬
haps the Japanese should have chosen
one of the floating turnkey airports on
offer from Japanese firms.
Israel is thinking of building five
artificial islands to solve its over¬
population problems. As there is a
general shortage of fill material, engi¬
neers are thinking of using fly ash
from coal-fired power stations as bal¬
last for submersible caissons. A
model island with a base area of one
square kilometre has been designed
to support towers for an estimated
20,000 permanent residents and up
to 30,000 employees, visitors and
tourists. The distance from the
shoreline will be approximately one
kilometre. Non-polluting energy pro¬
duction and sewage treatment facil¬
ities are planned.
UNDERWATER VILLAGES
French architect Jacques Rougerie
suggests that we should build undcr-
water. Between 1977 and 1981 he
constructed underwater habitats
and villages, named Galathée,
Aquabulle and Hippocampe, which

have been tested in the course of
scientific and educational operations
in the Mediterranean. He has also
designed a 50- to 500-inhabitant
project called Sea Village for the
Virgin Islands (U.S.A.), which is
intended to provide a permanent
base for scientists and other
researchers, although much of it
would be reserved for accommoda¬
tion, leisure and sports facilities, as
well as an underwater oceanic cul¬
tural centre.
GAPS IN THE LAW
If ocean cities and artificial islands
develop, states will be faced with
new legal problems. In the nineteenth
century, the limits of territorial
waters were set at 3 miles from the
coast, i.e. the maximum distance
reached by cannon shot from sailing
ships. When firepower increased,
territorial waters were extended to
12 miles. But who, beyond that
limit, could now prevent the con¬
struction of a city, an airport, a pol¬
lution-producing factory, or even a
prison? As Thierry Gaudin points
out: "With law tailored for terres¬
trial nation-states, the status of the
high seas is extremely vague. . . .
The sea is like the Far West at the
time of the Gold Rush. It may well
become the Far West of the next
century."
Yet the Convention on the Law
of the Sea was adopted by the
United Nations in December 1982.
So far it has been ratified by 63
countries (including Bolivia, which
has no coastline), but remarkable
though it may seem by none of the
world's great maritime powers. Be
that as it may, the treaty has no pro¬
visions covering the construction of
floating or underwater cities.

### 103103: British Columbia's shrinking rainforest

British Columbia's shrinking rainforest
(B
The Raincoast Conservation Society
(RCS) of Canada is sending out an
SOS to draw attention to the situa¬
tion of the rainforest in British Columbia,
where entire mountainsides have been
denuded of trees by logging and beaches
are strewn with thousands of logs, blocking
access to the sea. The amount of wood
logged since 1911 amounts to approximately
1.3 billion cubic metres, enough timber to
load 3.7 million logging trucks. Laid end to end
the logs would twice circle the globe. Only
200,000 hectares of this old-growth forest
are protected, in two reserves and four parks.
Clear-cutting is going on at the rate of 40 to
50,000 hectares per year.
The Amazon rainforest attracts a lot of
news coverage, but few voices have been
raised against the massive exploitation of
the world's oldest and largest temperate rain¬
forest, which stretches for 900 km. along
British Columbia's Pacific coast and covers
about 6.5 million hectares. Of 354 coastal
watersheds greater than 5,000 hectares,
two-thirds have been opened to mining and
logging. Vancouver Island is home to the
champions of the Canadian rainforest: one
red cedar with a circumference of almost 19
i
metres could be as many as 2,000 years old;
a Douglas-fir with a broken top is 74 metres
tall and more than 12 metres around; there
¡s a towering 95-metre-tall Sitka spruce. Many
of the biggest trees ever to grow in the rain¬
forest have already been cut down. Any
undiscovered giants that may be hiding in
the remotest valleys are still unprotected.
This exceptionally wet habitat (rainfall
averages from one to two metres per year) is
home to moss, lichen, some 3,000 species
of mushroom and a wide variety of animals
including grizzlies, black bears and the rare Ker-
mode white bear, wolves, deer, wolverines,
pumas, lynxes, stoats, beavers and minks.
Grizzlies are under threat from clear-cutting,
hunting and poaching. Even wild salmon,
which until recently abounded in the region's
rivers, are now less numerous because of
overfishing and the introduction of salmon
hatcheries (the wild fish often get intercepted
in harvests targeting artificially reared salmon).
A dozen Indian First Nation communi¬
ties, which have always occupied these lands,
have organized spectacular demonstra¬
tions far without successat the head¬
quarters of the provincial government which
grants logging licences. One of their tradi¬
tions is to try to conciliate the powers of
nature by carving immense totem poles from
red cedar. Is it too far-fetched to wonder if
some day, for want of trees, they may have
to carve their totems in concrete? I

THE DESERT OCTOPUS
First described by Austrian botanist Friedrich Welwitsch
in 1859, Welwitschia (Welwitschla mirabilis) is a rare plant
found only at a few points in the Namibian Desert. In
appearance it is a large brown stump with huge ribbon-like,
verdigris leaves, and a root system that spreads for
dozens of metres around it on the ground surface. Sci¬
entists still do not know how the plant collects its only
source of moisture, morning dew. Botanists believe it
may live for several centuries, perhaps even for a thou¬
sand years.
FOLLOW THAT FISH
The inner ears of fish contain otoliths, chalky concre¬
tions that develop throughout their lives by forming
growth rings. Researchers in the sclerochronology (the
analysis of growth by studying animals' hard tissues)
laboratory established by the French Institute of Sci¬
entific Research for Development and Co-operation
(ORSTOM) and the French Research Institute for
Exploiting the Sea (IFREMER), are looking at otoliths as
black boxes, similar to those used in aircraft, which con¬
tain data on the age and growth of the fish and also
record accidental pollution or sudden changes in their
habitat. The messages hidden in the otolith are still very
hard to decipher, but they may be a trail worth following.
A RABIES VACCINE
Since 1993 a new rabies vaccine, Raboral, developed
from a genetically modified virus, has been successfully
used on an experimental basis in the Ardennes forest
of Belgium, where foxes are the main vectors of the dis¬
ease. Vaccine-bearing bait is scattered from a helicopter.
The results have encouraged the U.S.A. and Mexico to use
the same technique to vaccinate other rabies vectors,
Texas coyotes and vampire bats. Some scientists, how¬
ever, have reservations about the risks involved in
spreading such a virus in nature, where it could combine
with wild viruses to produce new diseases.
ment and Co-operation (ORSTOM) has been asked to
house the MED-HYCOS pilot regional centre, which will
monitor the Mediterranean basin and the Black Sea. 150
computerized platforms, equipped with "intelligent" sen¬
sors that will send back a stream of information on the
quality of the water and the climate, will be set up to
cover the region's main watercourses. Upcoming pro¬
grammes will be concerned with southern Africa, western
and central Africa, the Aral Sea and Latin America.
THE CEDARS OF LEBANON
The beautiful cedar of Lebanon [Cedrus llbani), one of the
world's four cedar species, can live for a thousand years,
grow 40 metres high and have a circumference of 8 metres.
Although it is the national emblem of Lebanon, the
country's cedar population is dwindling. Fifteen years
of war have halted reforestation programmes, and today
there are less than 2,000 hectares of cedar forest. In
1991, a Lebanese woman, Désirée Aziz, founded the
International Committee for safeguarding the Cedar of
Lebanon and established a nursery that produced 12,000
plants the following year. Since 1994 schoolchildren have
been involved in the programme. They are asked to plant
50 cedars at the entrance to each village, to water young
plants and to protect them from goatsat least during
the first ten years when the trees develop many more
roots than branches.
CACTUS BUGS
In an effort to enforce the Washington Convention on
International Trade ¡n Endangered Species (CITES), offi¬
cials have come up with the high-tech idea of implanting
electronic chips in plant species at risk. A chip about the
size of a grain of rice is injected into the plant through a
hypodermic needle and read by an external device. The
experiment has already proved successful in rare plants
in southern Africa and will next be tried in rare Mexican
cactus, which are under threat from smugglers.
THE SIBERIAN TIGER: GROWING
OLD GRACEFULLY?
Although the skeleton and hide of a Siberian Tiger (Pan¬
thers tigris altaica) can be sold for up to $50,000, tiger
poaching in eastern Russia has considerably declined
due to the activities of new anti-poaching patrols. How¬
ever, degradation of the environment through defor¬
estation, which thins out the numbers of the animals
the tiger feeds on, continues to threaten the Siberian
tiger's survival. The Russian government has appealed
to "consumer" countries to stop buying tiger products
and has asked for their help in financing a tiger sanc¬
tuary, which would halt logging operations in areas where
tigers and other threatened species are found.
WATER WATCHING
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with help
from the World Bank, has begun promoting a new global
system known as WHYCOS (World Hydrological Cycle
Observing System) to observe the hydrological cycle.

### 103104: Isabelle Leymarie talks to Galina Gorchakova

#
S?
ß>
Isabelle Leymarie talks to
GALINA GORCHAKOVA
Russian soprano Gaiina Gorchakova is one of today's most expressive opera singers. The
daughter ofmusicians, she was educated at the Conservatory ofNovosibirsk in Siberia.
Since making her debut in Russia in 1 988 she has sung on the world's great stages,
including Covent Garden, La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera House and the Kirov. She
talked to Isabelle Leymarie in her dressing room during a visit to Paris.
M When you study a new role, how
do you get into the character?
Galina Gorchakova: I have no set way.
My interpretation is shaped by the
music and my voice. I sit down at the
piano and work on the phrasing; I listen
to recordings and watch videos. Singers
influence each other, but there are
always differences between them.
When I know the part, I rehearse it
with the concert master. The dramatic
aspect is essential. I have to live and
breathe the role. The character has
to get to my heart and become mine.
I Docs your conception of a role
ever diverge from the director's?
G. G.: I usually have my own concep¬
tion of the character, but when I meet
the director, my approach sometimes
changes radically. I have to make com¬
promises. For example, my own reading
of Tatiana, the heroine of Eugene
Onegin, Tchaikovsky's opera based on
the poem by Pushkin, does not exactly
correspond to the way I sing the role
today. It's a role I know well; it was
the first one I sang at the Sverdlovsk
Opera. I always defend my point of
view, but if the director is worth his
salt, he always wins. Of course it's fan¬
tastic when the director's approach is
the same as mine. Since I'm rather
headstrong, I sometimes have to make
an effort not to annoy the director.
Is it hard to skip from one
repertory to another? From
Russian to Italian, for instance?
G. G.: No, it comes naturally to me. I
was raised that way, and my second
culture is Italian. I have also sung
French opera, Gounod's Faust, for
example, but in general I'm less familiar
with the French repertory. On the
other hand, there is one role I've never
sung but would love to try because I
identify with her, and that is Carmen.
I Have you ever sung Mozart?
G. G.: If I had to sing Mozart, if my life
depended on it, I would, of course
I've got the power and the intellectual
capacity to do it! [Laughs] But as an
artist, I'm not attracted to Mozart.
Some people think Don Giovanniis an
absolute masterpiece, but it leaves me
cold. I'm very emotional and fanciful,
not at all methodical, and Mozart's
music bores me. I much prefer Verdi,
especially his later work, Puccini,
Tchaikovsky and Richard Strauss.
They are closer to my passionate tem¬
perament.
I What about contemporary
operas?
G. G.: Prokofiev is the most modern
composer I've sung so far, the role of
Renata in The Flaming Angel.
M Arc there any Russian
composers you'd like to make
better known abroad?
G. G.: More than Russian composers,
there are certain works by Tchaikovsky
I'd love to make known because they
are rarely performed outside Russia.
I'm thinking particularly oîMazeppa
and Yolanta.
I What are your favourite roles?
G. G.: I like them all, but at different
times and for different reasons. Right
now, Tatiana, of course, since that's
the role I'm singing. But it's more than
just singing. I live and breathe Tatiana!
How do you manage not to wear
out your voice with such a busy
schedule?
G. G.: I rest, I sleep; I go for walks. I
make sure that I don't take certain
drugs, especially those containing hor¬
mones because they can change your
voice. A beautiful voice is largely a
matter of well-trained muscles. Under
the effect of certain emotions one's
voice can start to tremble. Opera does
not allow that kind of weakness.
The atmosphere of an opera house
can also influence singers, for better
orforworse. Everything at the Bastille
Opera House in Paris, for example, is
designed to put the singer at ease. It's
a quiet place, and singers work well
there. But I remember one time at
Milan's La Scala when the atmosphere
was electric. The theatre people were
getting very agitated all round us, and
I could feel myself getting angry. But
stress stimulates me rather than upsets
me. In Milan I reacted to all the bother
by saying to myself, "I'll show them
what I can do!"
I How do Russian audiences
respond to you?
G. G.: Badly! I spend most of my time
on tour, and 1 frequently travel with
my husband, my mother and my son. AH
the same, I spend four months of the
year in St. Petersburg. People go on
about the "Slavic soul", but I find
Russian audiences rather cold. No one
is a prophet in their own country, of
course. Perhaps one reason for this
coolness is that the St. Petersburg
public is very spoiled. As far as I'm
concerned, the warmest audiences are
the British, the French, the Hong Kong
Chinese, the Americans and the Ital¬
ians.
I I suppose that as a result of so
much travelling you feel at home
anywhere.
G. G.: Yes, what interests me most is
to produce a heartfelt response, to get
people to think of something more than
material things, to think of their souls
as well as food and clothing. After all,
music is food for the soul. I

### 103107: Culture must be one of the foundations for world understanding

COURIER December 1951
' Culture must be one of the foundations for world
understanding'
by Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
In order to grasp the full significance of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, it is well to be fully aware
of the world situation that gave birth to the United
Nations and to UNESCO. The devastation wrought by the
wars of the last half century had brought home the fact
to everybody that, with the present-day level of tech¬
nical achievement, the security of nations could be based
only on supra-national institutions and rules of conduct.
It was understood that, in the long run, an all-destroying
conflict can lie avoided only by the setting up of a world
federation of nations.
So as a modest beginning of international order
the United Nations was founded. This organization, how¬
ever, is hut a meeting ground for delegates of national
governments and not for the peoples' representatives
acting independently on the basis of their own personal
convictions. Furthermore, U.N. decisions do not have
binding force on any national government; nor do any con¬
crete means exist by which the decisions can be enforced.
The effectiveness of the United Nations is still fur¬
ther reduced by the fact that membership has been refused
to certain nations, whose exclusion seriously affects the
supra-national character of the organization. Yet, in itself ,
the fact that international problems are brought up and
discussed in the broad light of day favours the peaceful
solution of conflicts. The existence of a supra-national
platform of discussion is apt to accustom the peoples grad¬
ually to the idea that national interests must be safe¬
guarded by negotiation and not by brute force.
This psychological or educational effect I regard as
the United Nations' most valuable feature. A world fed¬
eration presupposes a new kind of loyalty on the part of
man, a sense of responsibility that does not stop short at
national boundaries. To be truly effective, such loyalty
must embrace more than purely political issues. Under¬
standing among different cultural groups, mutual eco¬
nomic and cultural aid are the necessary additions.
Only by such endeavour will the feeling of confidence
be established that was lost owing to the psychological
effect of the wars and sapped by the narrow philosophy
of militarism and power politics. No effective institution
for the collective security of nations is possible without
understanding and a measure of reciprocal confidence.
To the U.N. was added UNESCO, the agency whose
function it is to pursue these cultural tasks. It has in a
greater measure than the U.N. been aide to avoid the
paralyzing inlluencc of power politics.
Realizing that healthy international relations can be
created only among populations made up of individuals
who themselves arc healthy and enjoy a measure of inde¬
pendence, the United Nations elaborated a Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by
the U.N. General Assembly on 10 December 1948.
The Declaration establishes a number of universally
comprehensible standards that are designed to protect
the individual, to prevent his being exploited economically,
and to safeguard his development and the free pursuit
of his activities within the social framework.
To spread these standards among all U.N. Member
States is rightly regarded and aimed at as an important
objective. UNESCO has accordingly instituted this third
celebration for the purpose of drawing attention far and
wide to these fundamental aspirations as a basis on which
to restore the political health of the peoples.
It was scarcely to be avoided that the Declaration
should take the form of a legalistic document, which in
its rigidity may lead to endless discussion. It is impossible
for such a text to take the great diversity of conditions
of life in the different countries fully into account; in
addition, it is unavoidable that such a text admits various
interpretations of detail. The general tendency of the
Declaration, however, is unmistakable and provides a
suitable, generally acceptable basis for judgment and
action.
To give formal recognition to standards and to adopt
them as the guiding lines of action in the teeth of all the
adversities of a changing situation are two very different
things as the impartial observer may see particularly in
the history of religious institutions. The Declaration will
only exert effective influence, when the United Nations
itself shows by its decisions and actions that it does embody,
de facto, the spirit of this, its own Declaration. I
