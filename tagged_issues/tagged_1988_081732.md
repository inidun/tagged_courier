The Aborigines of Australia, whose ancestors arrived on the continent some 40,000 years ago, have maintained an unbroken
tradition of visual art which evokes myths and legends associated with the "Dreamtime", the beginning of creation. Above, a family

### EDITORIAL

On 26 January 1 788, a British fleet sailed
into Sydney Cove, a small inlet on the east
coast of Australia, and established a penal
colony.
In the years that followed, what had been
a place of exile for some of its first European
inhabitants became a land of hope and
potential. The discovery of gold in 1 85 1
brought an influx of migrants that has
continued ever since. "Living Together",
the theme chosen by Australia to mark the
bicentennial of European settlement, thus
expresses an important aspiration for a
country whose people from the
Aborigines whose ancestors arrived some
40,000 years ago to the most recent
newcomers are drawn from many
different nations and ethnic groups.
Australia is a vast island-continent, equal
in size to the United States without Alaska
and Hawaii, and almost twice the combined
areas of India and Pakistan. It is a nation of
contrasts. Among the most sparsely
populated, it is also one of the most
urbanized, with most of the population
living in cities and towns on the coastal
fringes. Much of its development has been
dominated by what a leading Australian
historian has called "the tyranny of
distance" the distance which isolated the
country from the world outside and
hampered communications within.
This may help to explain why so many
original features of the land, life and culture
of Australia have remained so little known
and why many achievements by Australians
have perhaps not always received the credit
due to them internationally. In this issue of
the Unesco Courier, Australian
contributors attempt to redress the balance
by presenting some of the lesser-known
aspects of their country's history, culture
and science.
The Editors of the Unesco Courier would like to thank Professor Kenneth
Wiltshire of the University of Queensland, Brisbane, for his help in the
preparation of this issue.

Who are
the Australians?
An Australian historian looks at his country's
development in the 200 years since European settlement
BY GEOFFREY BOLTON
I
AUSTRALIA has always seemed a bit of
a paradox in the eyes of the rest of
the world. Medieval navigators
talked of a Great South Land of gold and
monsters. Jonathan Swift situated his im¬
aginary land of Lilliput off Australia's south¬
west coast. After European settlement began
in 1788, reports still spoke of a land where
the trees shed their bark but not their leaves,
and where Christmas was celebrated in a
heatwave. It was the home of the pouched
kangaroo, and the furry platypus which laid
eggs, and the swagman with corks around
the brim of his hat to discourage the ever-
present flies. A rich country to be sure,
productive of minerals and wool, brave sol¬
diers and impressive sporting personalities,
but in the last resort, perhaps, not a nation to
be taken quite seriously. Overseas critics,
particularly English critics, too often look
for traces of colonial immaturity. Austra¬
lians, they say, are nice enough people but
they lack culture and sophistication. They
are, in a word, provincial.
Australians are also more aware than most
peoples of the shaping influence of the en¬
vironment. The Aborigines, who inhabited
Australia for at least 40,000 years before the
coming of white domination, adapted skil¬
fully to their surroundings. They lacked
cereals, and remained a hunting and gather¬
ing society which did not disrupt the ecolo¬
gical balance. By 1788 there were perhaps
750,000 of them, one for every ten square
kilometres of the continent. Captain James
Cook, navigating the east coast before claim¬
ing the land for Britain, thought them "far
more happier than we Europeans ... The
Earth and sea of their own accord furnishes
them with all things necessary for life". But
the white newcomers were not prepared
to learn from Aboriginal culture, and the
Aborigines succumbed to disease and dis¬
possession.
Various strategic and commercial motives
have been suggested for the British settle¬
ment of Australia. It was a unique ex¬
periment. Australia must be the only signifi¬
cant nation in the world to have been found¬
ed as a prison. Between 1 788 and 1 868 about
160,000 convicts, largely male, were sen¬
tenced by British courts to transportation to
Australia. English writers commented on the
"thief colony" with amused fascination.
"They don't thieve all day long, do they?"
the essayist Charles Lamb asked a friend
who was visiting Sydney in 1817. "It is im¬
possible that vice should not become more
intense in such society," shuddered the
Reverend Sydney Smith.
The first generation of Australians saw it
differently. Some compared New South
Wales with ancient Rome, which according
to the standard histories of the day was
founded by a band of outlaws under
Romulus and Remus. Others proclaimed the
superiority of the Australian colonies over
the United States of America. The first Pres¬
byterian minister, John Dunmore Lang,
wrote: "as a penal settlement the history of
New South Wales is unquestionably much
more interesting to the general reader than
that of any other colonies of the Empire.
That colony has been the scene of an experi¬
ment in the capabilities of man." Australia
was a test of the capacity of human material
to respond to improved environment and
economic opportunity.

By the 1 830s, Australia was becoming one
of the world's major wool producers.
In 1851 the discovery of gold in New South
Wales and Victoria brought half a million
immigrants within a few years, so that ex-
convicts became an ageing minority among
the newcomers and the native-born. There
were important regional differences in the
pattern of settlement. New South Wales was
always regarded as retaining the rough-and-
ready politics of its Georgian origins.
Victoria, where the gold rushes had the
greatest impact, was seen as dominated by
Scots investors and respectable but radical
Chartists. * Both had a substantial Irish-
Catholic element, perhaps 25 per cent of the
population, whose Catholicism and strong
sense of national identity ensured that
Australia could never grow into a second
England.
The largely working-class Irish-Austra¬
lians would always push for a separate
Australian identity. Western Australia, on
the other hand, always stressed its links with
London because its inhabitants thought
themselves ignored and disregarded by
Melbourne and Sydney. South Australia,
never a convict colony, was by far the most
Protestant region. Though often a pioneer in
social reform (it was the first colony to give
the vote to all adults), it was sometimes given
" Chartists. Supporters of a British working-class move¬
ment for parliamentary reform which took its name from

to bouts of restrictive morality. Queensland
was the frontier where Australian character¬
istics might be seen at their most exagger¬
ated. Tasmania, left behind in the race for
economic growth, consoled itself with rural
clannishness.
In each of these colonies the capital city
soon grew to contain between one-third and
one-half of the whole population. But there
was no Australian metropolis. The rivalry
between Sydney and Melbourne was too
intense. This meant that when the colonies
eventually federated in 1901 none of the ex¬
isting cities could be given priority as capital.
After much argument it was necessary to
create an artificial seat of government be¬
tween Sydney and Melbourne, at Canberra.
Meanwhile, no single Australian city came to
dominate Australian culture as London or
Paris dominated theirs. In the circumstances
it is remarkable that a unified Australian
culture came into being as early as the 1 880s,
the decade in which for the first time a
majority of the adult inhabitants were
Australian-born.
Melbourne gave the new culture its art,
Sydney its literature. In Melbourne a group
of young painters known as the "Heidelberg
School" used the techniques of the French
Impressionists to paint Australian land¬
scapes in colours and tones which could be
accepted as capturing the authentic look of
the country for the first time. For half a
century their vision of the comparatively
lush vegetation outside Melbourne and
Sydney would become the stereotyped
image of the Australian bush.
In Sydney the catalyst was a weekly jour¬
nal founded in 1880, the Bulletin. National¬
ist and radical in its early years, the Bulletin
encouraged writers to find their subject-
matter in the Australian bush. The cities
might be imitations of Manchester or
Chicago, but the outback was distinctively
Australian. Most of the writers in fact lived
within a few kilometres of Sydney Harbour,
but they soon won an enthusiastic read¬
ership across the length and breadth of
Australia. They wrote of the vast sheep sta¬
tions, of the drovers taking cattle on the hoof
hundreds of miles to market, of shearers and
miners and the travelling workers who were
forming Australia's most significant trade
unions.
In their writings the outlines developed of
the "typical" Australian man. He was practi¬
cal, resourceful, good at improvisation but
no perfectionist; humorous in adversity,
mistrustful of authority, disrespectful to¬
wards wealth and property, uncomfortable
with women, and staunchly loyal to his
mates, though apt to conceal his feelings
under a cynical and laconic wit. To the
Aboriginal poet Paddy Roe of Broome,
Western Australia, is the author
of 3 books which preserve the legends
of his people.
young Bulletin journalist Charles Bean, "in
the pastoral industry and at the diggings, the
ideal of the Australian is still made; or rather
the standards of pluck, hardiness, unaffec-
tedness, loyalty, truthfulness, hospitality on
which the rest of Australia consciously
founds its ideal".
Here too was a paradox. Even in the early
years of the twentieth century, the majority
of Australians were already city-dwellers in
an increasingly mechanized environment.
The Bulletin's authors wrote of a way of life
which was receding into nostalgia even as
they wrote. But, as the historian Rüssel
Ward argues, the typical Australian was
never the same as the average Australian. If
Australians saw themselves as a nation of
bushmen they were entitled to their national
myth, just as modern urban Americans may
identify with the frontier virtues of the Old
West. But the Australian national myth re¬
ceived powerful reinforcement during the
1914-1918 war. Australia sent a high propor¬
tion of its younger men to fight in the British
Empire's cause. Of these, one in six was
killed and about two-thirds became casual¬
ties. But it was the landing at Gallipoli
(Turkey) on 25 April 1915 which crystal-

lized many of the concepts of Australian
nationalism.
The Gallipoli campaign was part of an
ill-starred plan to knock Turkey out of the
war. Allied troops, including a large propor¬
tion of Australians and New Zealanders (the
Anzac corps) managed to establish them¬
selves on the beach at Gallipoli but failed to
dislodge the Turks from the heights behind.
There the two armies slogged it out for eight
months until in December 1915 the invaders
withdrew. Gallipoli established the reputa¬
tion of the Anzacs as heroic fighters. The
defeat could be blamed on the incompetence
of British planning, whereas the heroism was
proof that the recently federated Common¬
wealth of Australia was capable of taking its
place among the nations of the world by the
usual rituals of bloodshed.
The Bulletin writer Bean covered the cam¬
paign and later became Australia's official
war historian. He argued persuasively that
the special qualities of the Australian soldier
were those of the bushman: the same re¬
sourcefulness, stoicism, wry humour and
loyalty to his mates. So the image of the
typical Australian won acceptance at home
and overseas. Despite the continuing sprawl
of Sydney, Melbourne and the lesser cities,
the Australian virtues were those of the wide
outback.
Australians on the whole were happy with
this self-image, but English visitors some¬
times worried about whether it concealed a
lack of depth. D.H. Lawrence spent
three months in Australia in 1922, com¬
plaining at one moment that Australians
were "healthy, and to my thinking almost
imbecile", but also noting that "nobody felt
better than anybody else, or higher; only
better-off".
In 1 935 the expatriate professor of English

Cowling, stirred up controversy by claiming
that Australia could never hope to produce
an adequate literature. "There are no ancient
churches, castles, ruins the memorials of
generations departed ... From a literary
point of view Australia lacks the richness of
age and tradition." He was indignantly re¬
futed by Australian patriots, but the fact
remained that for most of the first half of the
twentieth century a steady procession of
Australian writers Henry Handel
Richardson, Martin Boyd, for a while
Patrick White went to live in Europe. They
were willing to pay the price of exile for
intellectual stimulus.
The 1939-1945 war brought profound
changes. When Japan entered the war and
Singapore fell, Australians realized that they
could no longer count on British protection.
In the future they must increasingly seek
trade and alliance with foreign powers; first
the United States then, when the war was
over, the nations of East and South-east
Asia, including before long Japan as a major
trading partner. The war also convinced
most Australians that their country was
underpopulated. No longer proud of origins
which were 97 per cent British, the
Australians after 1945 opened their country
to an unprecedented inflow of migration. In
thirty years the population doubled, passing
15 million by 1980. Until 1970 nearly all the
newcomers were of European origin:
Italians were most numerous, but Greeks,
Yugoslavs, Germans, Dutch, and eastern
Europeans were also well represented.
The "White Australia" policy was quietly
discarded during these years, and from the
1960s a modest amount of Asian immigra¬
tion occurred, growing after 1975 because of
an influx of Vietnamese refugees. Migrant
demand created prosperity for many
Australian industries, as did overseas de¬
mand for Australian wool and minerals.
Urbanization grew; by the 1970s Sydney
and Melbourne were supporting popula¬
tions of nearly three million, with Adelaide,
Brisbane and Perth each having nearly
one million. Air travel and television swept
Australia from its isolation. Times of such
rapid change presented a challenge to con¬
ventional images of what it meant to be
Australian.
Under Sir Robert Menzies (prime minister
1949-1966) belief in the British connection
was still officially fostered, although
American culture and American foreign
policy were gaining in influence. Between
1965 and 1971 Australia sent troops to help
the Americans in Vietnam. But in the late
1960s the forces of protest and change found
a voice, and in 1972 a Labor government

Australia's first settlers were the Aborigi¬
nals, hunters and food gatherers who
are believed to have migrated from
Asia 40,000 years ago. They lived undis¬
turbed for many centuries, during which the
only other visitors to Australia may have been
Indonesian traders who sailed to the con¬
tinent's north-west coast. Australia however
remained a mystery to the rest of the world
until less than 400 years ago.
Although a "Terra Australis"-a Great
South Land -was shown on maps as early as
the second century AD, its actual existence
was not confirmed until the 17th century as a
result of Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch mer¬
cantile expansion into Asia.
The first Englishman to visit the continent
was the buccaneer William Dampier, who
landed on the north-west coast of what is now
the State of Western Australia in 1688. In
1 770 Captain James Cook of the British Navy
sighted the east of the continent, charted it,
and after travelling up the coast landed at
Botany Bay.
The first European settlement of the conti¬
nent occurred on 26 January 1788, when
Captain Arthur Phillip landed at Sydney Cove
(now Port Jackson) near Botany Bay and
established a penal settlement. He took pos¬
session of the whole of the eastern part of the
continent which he named New South Wales.
The first white settlers were convicts and
their soldier guards and some tradesmen sent
to help establish the new penal colony.
Although at first struggling in a harsh, alien
land and dependent on supplies from Britain,
the colony began to reach inland from what is
now Sydney. The hinterland was explored,
farms were developed, and eventually the
colony became self-sufficient in most foods.
Extensive exploration in the 19th century
led to vast areas being opened for develop¬
ment and the establishment of new colonies
which subsequently became the States of
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia,
Western Australia and Tasmania, and the
Northern Territory.
Transportation of convicts from Britain to
New South Wales ended in 1840 and to
Tasmania in 1853, but the population growth
was spurred by the arrival of free settlers
attracted by the prospects of riches on the
New South Wales and Victoria goldfields and
the opportunities to take up tracts of land for
farming. Agrarian development burgeoned
and the mainstays of the economy became
wool, meat, wheat and gold.
While the alluvial gold mining industry de¬
clined towards the turn of the century, rural
industries continued to expand and are still
important in Australia's economy.
The growth of the population and of the
economy led to calls by each of the colonies
for self-government and for their own legisla¬
tures, which were granted by Britain. Prog¬
ress towards federation was inevitable and in
1 901 the six colonies joined in a federation of
States to become the Commonwealth of
Australia.

came to office under Gough Whitlam, stan¬
dard-bearer of a new concept of Australian
nationalism.
Nationalism under Whitlam was multi¬
cultural. Instead of stressing the continuities
with British institutions, Australia would
identify itself with the cultural traditions of
all its numerous migrant groups. At the same
time care would be taken to preserve the
architectural and cultural heritage of the
pioneering past. The Australia Council was
founded to steer government funding to the
creative arts. Whitlam's government lasted
only three years. Trying to push through too
many reforms at once, it ran into a world
economic crisis and was controversially dis¬
missed by the governor-general in Novem¬
ber 1975. At the elections the conservative
parties were swept back into power. But
during the Whitlam years the agenda was set
for future debate about Australian national¬
ism and Australian national self-concept.
Meanwhile, sport was always a means of
vindicating Australian prowess. In earlier
years Australian cricket teams had success¬
fully competed with England for the legen¬
dary Ashes.** During the 1950s Australia
beat the United States and the rest of the
world at tennis. And in 1983 Australia de¬
clared a national day of rejoicing when for
the first time in over a century the Americans
lost the international yachting trophy, the
America's Cup, to an Australian competitor
financed by the immigrant millionaire Alan
Bond. The 16 million Australians liked to
see an element of David-and-Goliath when
their athletes won victories over rivals from
countries with much larger populations.
Sport for the Australians has often been a
'"' Ashes. Symbol of victory in cricket match series
between national teams of England and Australia. The
term was first used after Australia defeated England in
London in 1882 and an English newspaper lamented that
English cricket was dead and that its body would be
cremated and the ashes sent to Australia. Editor.
benign and realistic way of fostering national
pride without lapsing into militarism.
Outsiders observing the Australian enthu¬

that Australians are a race of mindless
hedonists without cultural interests. They
concede that Australia has produced an im¬
pressive number of creative individuals

Australia itself is still a cultural desert. Such a
picture is long out of date. The major
Australian cities have more to offer in the
way of music and the visual arts than many
European centres of the same size.
There is no dominant metropolis in which
all cultural activity is concentrated. When
Australia's population was smaller this led to

local traditions in the creative arts have be¬
gun to emerge. Australian theatre is perhaps
less vigorous than it was fifteen or twenty
years ago, but in compensation there has
been an impressive record of film produc¬
tion. Australia has a long association with
cinema and may even have produced the
world's first feature-length film around the
turn of the century, but the industry was
largely eclipsed by Hollywood in the 1920s
and it required imaginative government sup¬
port during the late 1960s and early 1970s to
launch a revival. The results have gained
international recognition. (See article
page 35).
Australians in quest of a national identity
have recently developed a consuming curios¬
ity about their background. Family history
has become a hobby straining the resources
of public libraries. Museums and heritage
parks are big business, encouraged in almost
every small town because of their tourist
potential.. Television series based on
Australian history enjoy a wide audience.
Colonial furniture and antiques are prized
by those who can afford them. The colonial
idiom is fashionable architecture. Australian
historians stress the need to write "history
from below"; the history of everyday life
including the underprivileged, history with
which today's Australians can identify, in¬
cluding Aborigines and immigrants.
But here controversy reigns. Is there a
mainstream Anglo-Australian culture with
which immigrants and Aborigines should be
expected to identify? Or is Australia's cultu¬
ral identity still in a state of flux? Should
encouragement be given to a multicultural
pluralism in which Aborigines and immig¬
rants of Asian and European origin are en¬
couraged to affirm their ancestral traditions?
Official policy in recent years has favoured
multiculturalism, but this has given rise to a
backlash from critics who fear that such a
trend will be socially divisive. They claim
that the affirmation of ancestral traditions
may mean the retention of ancestral griev¬
ances, leading to ethnic strife and even to a
form of apartheid. This is an especially acute
issue with Aborigines, many of whom in
recent years have rejected the idea of assi¬
milation within mainstream society and are
claiming the recognition of their separate
identity based on their unacknowledged
land rights.
It is impossible that Australia should re¬
main the "new Britannia" envisaged by its
founders 200 years ago, or even the old
Australia of outback tradition. Starting with
the Aborigines, the Australian people have
become a mixture of British, Irish,
European, and Asian origins living in an
environment different from any other.
Experiments in breeding fine-wool Spanish
Merino sheep began in the late 18th century
and laid the foundations of Australia's future
economic development. Above, giant Merino

Schoolchildren visiting the Melbourne Zoo

'
Within the last 200 years, and especially in
the last fifty, they have begun to create a new
culture with enormous potential for com¬
bining European background with aware¬
ness of Asian neighbours. It is impossible
that a people exposed to such a range of
experience could remain the rough-and-
ready stereotype of popular myth. Perhaps
the last word should go to David Martin,
himself a Hungarian migrant turned
Australian, who has written: "Foreigners
easily too easily assume that Australia is
a crude habitat. They do not understand
that, on the contrary, it is a subtle one, home
of a subtle people."

### 81724: Dreamtime stories; the living testimony of Aboriginal art

Dreamtime
stories
The living testimony of Aboriginal art
BY VERONICA TIPPETT
THE Aboriginal art of Australia
belongs to the world's oldest
living art tradition, unbroken
for thousands of years. It continues to
survive and develop because it has been
retained and treasured in the memories
of successive generations of Aboriginal
people who have invested it with re¬
markable breadth, depth, symbolism,
vigour and intensity.
Despite the fact that the past
200 years of European settlement have
seen the erosion of much of the tradi¬
tional fabric of Aboriginal life and the
cultural attenuation of many groups of
people, a large and rich body of
Aboriginal artistic heritage has sur¬
vived. In many communities the arts are
still an integral part of social and reli¬
gious life but have also acquired a new
and urgent emphasis that of reinforc¬
ing Aboriginal identity- and asserting
traditional values in the face of an en¬
croaching wider community.
" In many ways the extraordinary rich¬
ness and variety of Aboriginal culture,
even in Australia, has been a well kept
secret. But while there is still emphasis
on secrecy to preserve the sacred nature
of much Aboriginal culture, there is also
an increasing openness and willingness
to share aspects of it. For example, it is
still not widely known that Australia is
the world's largest repository of
Palaeolithic rock art sites, many of
which predate the well-known rock art
galleries of Europe and Africa.
Throughout Australia there are
thousands of sites housing superb en¬
gravings and paintings. In northern
Australia in particular there are vast gal¬
leries which record a pageant of mytho¬
logical and historical events from Anti¬
quity until recent times. As individual
works of art they are astonishing and as
a continuous record of the development
of a unique artistic tradition they are
unsurpassed.
Most traditional Aboriginal art can be
regarded as religious art, in which land¬
scape and myth predominated. As such,
it represented and amplified themes
concerning the sacred myths and tot-
emic beliefs connected with the Dream¬
time, that sacred time in Aboriginal cul¬
ture which represents the beginning of
creation. According to Aboriginal be¬
lief, all life as it is known today
human, animal, bird, fish is a part of
one unchanging and interconnected sys¬
tem, one vast network of relationships,
which can be traced back to the Great
Spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime. The
Dreamtime refers not only to an ancient
era of creation it continues as the
Dreaming in the spiritual lives of
Aboriginal people today.
Often Aboriginal art was, and is, also
a statement concerning land a reflec¬
tion of the Aboriginal relationship to
particular stretches of land to which
individuals or groups were linked
through mythological associations or
specific connections with spirit beings.
Art, as the essence of the mythical and
ritual force, pervaded the life of
-*£
Aboriginal society, uniting it and giving
it meaning.
Music, song, dance and the associated
visual arts were all inextricably connec¬
ted. There were no "professional"
artists as such in Aboriginal society.
Everyone participated in the arts,
although those with exceptional skills
were recognized and encouraged.
Aboriginal Australia was (and still is)
made up of small, select groups with
different languages and distinct territor¬
ies. This gave birth to different art styles
and traditions. Western Desert art, for
example, with its curves, lines and con¬
centric circles, has a unique and very
distinctive style. Papunya, an
Aboriginal community settlement
about 300 kilometres west of Alice
Springs, is the present home of several
tribal groups whose original home terri¬
tories lie in central Australia. There, the
Walbiri-Pintubi people create magnifi¬
cent ground designs from plants, feath-
erdown, ochre and clay. These patterns
represent the land as well as events of the

creation era. The meanings of the sym¬
bols in the ground paintings vary
according to the site revealed, the reli¬
gious inferences and the degree of in¬
formation the artists have been allowed
to convey. The paintings also tell stories
through symbols and signs which con¬
tinue to be part of traditional Aboriginal
communication.
Papunya is also the birthplace and
home of a dramatic and profound new
art form which has caught the imagina¬
tion and interest of people throughout
Australia and overseas. It involves the
transference of the decorative ground
sculptures and sand paintings onto
board and canvas with the use of com¬
mercial paints. This innovation in West¬
ern Desert art began in 1970 with the
encouragement of a teacher at the set¬
tlement. Now the Desert painters pro¬
duce an exciting and vivid array of
paintings in which traditional themes
are considerably elaborated and colour
contrasts are used which were not possi¬
ble using traditional techniques. But the
distinctive Desert style remains; the
symbols and stories retain their links
with a 'tradition that stretches back to
the Dreamtime. Neither does this new
form displace the old the ground
paintings are as important as ever in
their original ritual context.
In the north of the Northern Terri¬
tory, other, just as distinctive, art styles
are to be found. The rock and bark
paintings of western Arnhem Land are
an outstanding example. The Aboriginal
people in this large tropical region have
retained close links with their long past
and with the land they have inhabited
for many thousands of years. Much of
the rock art that abounds in this area
reflects that antiquity and underscores



Aboriginal links with earliest times.
Some of the oldest paintings are said to
have been produced by spirit beings
called Mimi. They are vivid, lively, open
line drawings, usually in red ochre, of
men and women in action running,
fighting and hunting.

gious and ceremonial life and artistic
activity have continued to exist and de¬
velop in this part of the country. Many
bark paintings being produced today by
Arnhem Land artists reflect a remark¬
able continuity of subject and style with
the ancient cave paintings. One feature
of rock art that appears in contemporary
paintings is the X-ray drawing style that
illustrates the internal organs and skelet¬
al structure of the creatures represented.
These paintings, which generally por¬
tray animals, birds, reptiles and fish
seldom human beings are intended to
reveal the whole being, not simply its
external manifestation. Yet this adher¬
ence to traditional technique and style is
no mere copyist tradition, but an art that
is vibrant, relevant, imaginative and
contemporary.
The art of bark painting has
flourished over the last two decades to
become the most widespread form of
Aboriginal artistic expression through¬
out northern Australia. Designs are
painted in earth ochres on the smooth
inner surface of sheets of bark from
stringybark eucalyptus trees. The bark
is stripped from the trees during the wet
season and cured over a fire. The edges
are then trimmed, and the bark is flat¬
tened with stones or weights. Colours
come from a range of earth-based pig¬
ments including ochres, pipeclay and
manganese, as well as charcoal, giving
the artists a palette of white, brown,
yellow, red and black. No blue or green
paint is used, but the addition of seeds,
feathers and leaves makes possible a
wide choice of patterns and colours.
All Aboriginal art traditionally rested
on the need for explanation, and today
when an artist sells his work, he usually
provides a brief "story" for each piece.
Generally this is the simplest explana¬
tion of the design, such as might be
given to an uninitiated child. The deeper
levels of meaning, the references to
sacred symbols and other details re¬
served for tribal elders who have
attained ritual maturity, are never pas¬
sed on at the sale of the painting.
In many families of eastern Arnhem
Land today, unlike in earlier times, the
women often paint on bark. Their de¬
signs represent aspects of life related to
their traditional role of food gatherer.
As the story of the Papunya artists
	 14 	
shows, non-traditional art forms such as
acrylic paintings, batik, silkscreen print¬
ing, leatherwork and pottery are also
being adopted and developed by
Aboriginal artists and have no less valid¬
ity or legitimacy as cultural expressions.
Such innovative responses to a changing
world include the beautiful batiks of the
women of Utopia whose works in¬
corporate motifs and designs derived
from traditional stories and their desert
environment.
The Tiwi people of Melville and
Bathurst Islands about 100 kilometres



north of Darwin have also successfully
blended the old and the new to produce
a dynamic and creative art industry. The
Tiwi people have lived on these two is¬
lands for more than 20,000 years, ex¬
pressing their culture in art and craftwork
that is now sought worldwide.
Tiwi art is traditionally strongly ab¬
stract and symbolic, comprising circles,
curved lines and dots. These designs are

applied to a number of artefacts, the
most dramatic being the spectacular
pukamani or grave posts which are
unique to the Tiwi. In 1969 an art
teacher at the mission school on
Bathurst Island began an Aboriginal
silkscreen workshop. This led to the
founding of two ventures, Bima Wear
and Tiwi Designs. Bima Wear recently
fashioned the Pope's vestments for his
visit to Australia. Today all seventeen
people who work at Bima Wear are
Aboriginal women. Most of the gar¬
ments designed, printed and sewn by
them are for females. Tiwi Designs, on
the other hand, employs only men.
Women have worked there in the past,
but traditional cultural influences make
it difficult for men and women to work
together. Tiwi designs, which have
strong visual appeal and have become
very popular, are now applied to a wide
range of items from tablecloths,
placemats, T-shirts and wall hangings to
lengths of fabric for fashions and fur¬
nishings. Although this enterprise is
recognized by the Aboriginal artists as a
"new way", they point out that it is
based on a traditional understanding of
their natural environment and a fami¬
liarity with ritual knowledge and its tra¬
ditional forms of expression.
Today, all major art institutions in
Australia and many regional galleries
are building collections of Aboriginal
art. And through public exhibitions,
media reviews, films and publications,
the work of senior Aboriginal artists is
being increasingly seen as one of the
most important and vibrant facets of
Australian cultural life.
VERONICA TIPPETT is the Aboriginal Prog¬
rams Officer in Australia's Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade and is herself an Aboriginal. She

### 81725: The Natural legacy

The natural legacy
BY RALPH SLATYER
Australia is the only country, to
occupy a whole continent.
Mainland Australia together
with the island State of Tasmania occu¬
pies some 7.7 million square kilometres,
making the country the sixth largest in
the world, after the Soviet Union,
Canada, the People's Republic of
China, the United States of America and
Brazil, and very similar in size to the
forty-eight contiguous States of the
United States. Australia also has one of
the longest coastlines of any country.
The Australian continent once
formed part of the super-continent
Gondwanaland. Although separation of
individual continents from this south¬
ern land mass commenced about
130 million years ago, the Australian
continent and the islands of the region
separated more recently. Bass Strait and
the Tasman Sea appeared 80 million
years ago, resulting in the separation of
Tasmania, New Zealand and Lord
Howe Island.
After separation of Australia from
Antarctica some 20 million years later,
the Australian tectonic plate drifted
north and is thought to have reached a
location close to its present position
16

### 81725: The Natural legacy

about 15 million years ago. At that time
it came into contact with the Sunda
Island arc system, forming the present
New Guinea land mass. Further north¬
erly movement of the Australian plate
resulted in a disjunction which saw
permanent separation of the Australian
and New Guinea regions. Much of the
topographic and geographic character
of these regions was laid down during
this period.
The continent has experienced major
changes in climate both during the
period of rapid continental drift and
while it has been near its present loca¬
tion. At the same time it has been re¬
latively free of the major tectonic dis¬
turbances which have led to extensive
mountain building in most other con¬
tinents. In the process, it has developed
the distinctive land surface and unique
flora and fauna which characterize its
present environment.
The uniqueness of Australian flora
and fauna is due in part to their isolation
from the biota of other land masses.
This genetic isolation has resulted in
divergence among some plant and anim¬
al families and genera, leading to a con¬
siderable diversity of species. The rich
and varied marsupial fauna and the array
of flowering plants in families such as
the Proteaceae, and in some genera in
other families, such as Eucalyptus and
Acacia, are some examples of this
diversity.
Given these unique flora and fauna
and the presence of striking land forms,
Australia is endowed with a magnificent
natural heritage which is now being rec¬
ognized by the inclusion of some of the
most outstanding sites on Unesco's
World Heritage List.
Already, Australia has seven prop¬
erties inscribed on the ListKakadu
National Park, the Great Barrier Reef,
Willandra Lakes Region, Western
Tasmania Wilderness National Parks,
the Lord Howe Island Group, Austra¬
lian East Coast temperate and sub¬
tropical Rainforest Parks and Uluru
National Park.
In view of Australia's large size, it is
often a surprise to realize that its human
population is only 16 million. A major
reason for this is that most of Australia
lies between 15° to 35°, the zone where
most of the world's great deserts are

found. More than 80 per cent of the
continent lies in arid or semi-arid clima¬
tic zones. Indeed, Australia is by far the
driest continent, regardless of whether
the comparison is in terms of precipita¬
tion or, more particularly, surface water
resources. Irrigated agriculture is li¬
mited in extent and rainfed agriculture is
largely restricted to the eastern, south¬
eastern and south-western parts of the
continent.
The limitations imposed by the
physical environment need to be recog¬
nized if sustained and stable land use is
to be achieved.
This posed relatively 'few problems
for the Aboriginal people whose culture
is ecologically sympathetic: In their cul¬
ture, people constitute an integral and
interdependent part of the ecosystems
they occupy, responding to the charac¬
teristics and fluctuations of the environ¬
ment in a way that maintains the land
and its flora and fauna in ecological
balance.
By comparison, European occupancy
of the continent, the cultivation of the
land and the modification of the flora
and fauna have had a dramatic impact on
that balance. Although Australia has ex¬
perienced only 200 years of European
occupation, and although the human
population has been low, land degrada¬
tion has already emerged as the greatest
environmental problem in Australia.
Land degradation has proceeded
quickly not just because of the low and
variable precipitation which charac¬
terizes much of the continent. It has
been compounded by the old and deep¬
ly weathered land forms, and under¬
lying geology, which have produced
shallow soils with poor structure and
intrinsically low fertility. It is not sur¬
prising that such soils have become de¬
graded when exposed to an erosive cli¬
mate. Land degradation has also been
compounded by the deliberate and
accidental introduction, since European
settlement, of a number of plant and
animal species, and micro-organisms,
which have become weeds, pests and
diseases.
European settlement opened up
ecosystems to the entry of exotic species
which were often able to compete suc¬
cessfully with native species for avail¬
able ecological niches. For example, the
feral rabbit became established relative¬
ly easily, owing to the lack of mamma¬
lian predators in the Australian biota, to
17

### 81725: The Natural legacy

changes in the habitat, and to early ex¬
tinction of species which occupied simi¬
lar ecological niches.
With the wisdom of hindsight and
with more enlightened management,
many of these problems could have been
avoided or minimized. However, given
the lack of knowledge about the man¬
agement of such soils in such climates,
when agricultural and pastoral activities
first began in Australia in the late eight¬
eenth century, it was inevitable that the
impact would be severe.
Fortunately, there now appears to be
a rapidly growing awareness of the mag¬
nitude of the problem and of the need to
modify land use practices to minimize
further degradation and, hopefully, to
reve'rse the downward trend.
In this regard, Australia is well placed
in having a number of internationally
respected research institutions devoted
to various aspects of land use. Until
fairly recently the research emphasis in
these institutions was focused on the
development of the rural industries. In¬
deed, because of the need to develop
new crops, technologies and farming
practices, agriculture could not have be¬
come a major industry in Australia
without a strong science base.
Scientists working in these research
institutions, mainly in universities and
Federal and State departments and au¬
thorities, have skills ranging broadly
across the biological and physical sci¬
ences. As awareness of the importance
of maintaining long-term productivity
grows, these skills have a key role to
play in research and development re¬
lated to land degradation.
Many of the environmental problems
in Australia have their parallels in other
parts of the world, particularly in coun¬
tries which occupy similar latitudinal
zones. Many of these are developing
countries which lack the expertise and
resources necessary to ensure good en¬
vironmental management and minimize
land degradation. As a result Australia
and Australians have been active in
many bilateral and international pro¬
grammes which are focused on the
environment.

### 81726: The Unknown art of Australia

The unknown art ofAustralia
BY BERNARD SMITH
NearHeidelberg (1890), oil
on canvas by Sir Arthur
Streeton (1867-1943). A
leading member
of the "Heidelberg School"
of artists, named after
the Melbourne suburb
where they often worked,
he is best known
for his luminous,
panoramic landscapes
of Victoria and New
South Wales.
LIKEthe first Australian art created
by the Aboriginal people, the
highly distinctive art that has
developed in Australia since European
settlement in 1 788 is rarely mentioned in
general histories of art. Why is this so?
There are two important reasons.
First, most general histories of art are
written by European or North
American historians. Most of them are
convinced that art produced outside of
Europe and North America is either
folk art or a second-rate imitation of
European art. In either case it can safely
be ignored.
The second reason why Australian art
is not known abroad is related to the
first. The art establishment in Australia
is well aware of the Eurocentric values
that dominate the world oí high art, and
when preparing collections of
Australian art for exhibition abroad it
always sets out to show that Australian
art is just as up-to-date as that from
anywhere else in its knowledge of the
latest European fashion. Australians call
this approach "the cultural cringe".
Of course good art possesses both a
regional and a universal quality: region¬
al in that it evokes the spirit of a place, a
time and a people; universal in its appeal
to all humankind, and in its links and
associations with other cultures and
other times. To recognize this basic but
paradoxical fact was the greatest
achievement of modernism.
Australian art has become, during the
past century, a highly important theatre
of activity in which this central paradox
of modernism, the connection between
the regional and the universal, has been
continuously enacted and contested.
Again, there are two main reasons for
this. The first is environmental.
Australia, with its great deserts, rain
forests and wide stretches of open
savannah, its curious plants and animals,
presented a major challenge to
European taste and perception just as
modernism did. Though determined to
go on behaving like Europeans in a
strange environment, the first settlers
were continually challenged by the en¬
during power of the so-called "primi-

tive" character of the land and the "pri¬
mitive" character of the people. Though
they tried to forget or ignore both, they
had to learn to alter their ways. Those
who did not accept the challenge created
mere imitations, second-order
European art.
The second reason is cultural. The
early European settlers found them¬
selves clinging to the shores of a great
continent the size of the United States,
situated between the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, with south-east Asia to their
north. They found' themselves sur¬
rounded by non-European cultures of
great antiquity. This fact has been even
more difficult to come to terms with
than the natural environment. Never¬
theless, under the long-term effects of a
radically different environment and sur¬
rounding, alien cultures, European con¬
ventions in art have been seriously chal¬
lenged and an excitingly new kind of art
is evolving.
Consider architecture. The Aboriginal
Australians had no need of permanent
buildings. European settlers began
building the kinds of houses they had
known in their former homelands', but
these were found to be unsuitable. The
first public building in Australia, Gov¬
ernment House in Sydney (1788) was
given the form of a Georgian box-like
structure derived ultimately from the
fortress-like town house of the Italian
Renaissance. But under pressure from
the great heat and flooding rains of
Australia, the Georgian box trans¬
formed itself into a spreading umbrella.
The verandah, pioneered by the
Portuguese when creating the first
European empire in the tropics, became
the active principle in the transforma¬
tion of Australian colonial architecture.
It evolved diverse shapes and structures
and was found in all types of building,
from rural homesteads to city terraces.
By the end of the nineteenth century it
had given rise to a style of architecture in
Australia as distinctive as the rococo.
This style, known as the Federation
style because it came to maturity around
the time of the federation of the
Australian States into the Common¬
wealth of Australia in 1 901 , soon spread
all over the continent.
The inner dynamic of the Federation
style, under the long-term pressure of
the environment, was to break up wall
spaces, roofs and verandahs into distinc¬
tive units. It was an open, relaxed style.
This long-term trend persisted, despite
the "European" components of mod¬
ernism, and the most characteristically
Australian modernist architecture re¬
mained open, light, and free-ranging,

The Mining Town, oil and tempera on chipboard panel, by Arthur Boyd (b. 1920)
spreading over the ground and resisting
hierarchical disposition of the compo¬
nent parts of the building, or severely
ordered groupings. It was an
architecture suited to a modern demo¬
cracy. When that young architect of
genius, the Dane Jörn Utzon, made his
preliminary designs for the Sydney
Opera House, he seems to have in¬
tuitively grasped the inner dynamic at
work in the evolution of Australian
architecture. His great work became a
modern masterpiece, a threefold unity
of place, form and the transcendent hu¬
man spirit.
\ Long-term environmental factors
also affected Australian painting, direct¬
ing it towards an extended, open-form
and non-hierarchical style.
European-born colonial artists at first
tried to apply the styles and aesthetic
theories of the picturesque and the sub
lime that had emerged in response to
European landscape over several cen¬
turies. But their works looked like false
European landscapes. If an artist paint¬
ing Australian scenery closed off the
foreground with side-screens of trees or
used belts of vegetation to separate fore¬
ground from middle distance and back¬
ground, a sense of falsity emerged. The
picturesque did not work well in
Australia.
The first to realize this was the
English architect, John Glover. "There
is a remarkable peculiarity in the trees of
this country," he wrote. "However
numerous, they rarely prevent you trac¬
ing through them the whole distant
country." He had discovered that the
Australian landscape possesses a trans-
lucency in depth not found in European
landscape.
Australian landscape also subverted
European notions about the sublime.
For Edmund Burke, the essence of the
sublime lay in great height and depth*.
He did not believe that an extensive
plain could be sublime. But when
Australian colonial landscape painters
such as Conrad Martens exaggerated the
heights and depths of the Blue Moun¬
tains, near Sydney, they tended to
"Europeanize" their depictions. Eugene
von Guerard, a fine painter who worked
in Australia in the late nineteenth cen¬
tury, became aware of this problem. In
his works, sublimity is not achieved by
emphasizing and exaggerating height
and depth but by endowing the land¬
scape with a feeling of infinite depth and
extension in lateral space. A new kind of
landscape painting was evolving that
subverted conventional notions of the
picturesque and the sublime.
As a result Australian landscape
painting, like the best Australian
architecture, developed as a distinctive¬
ly open-form structure. It reached its
first maturity in the 1 890s in the work of
the artists of the Heidelberg School,
named after the Melbourne suburb
where they often gathered to paint.
Their work was addressed to the highly
distinctive character of Australian light,
colour and atmosphere. They produced
a brilliantly novel kind of landscape
painting which built upon the open-
form, "lateral sublime" principles of
their colonial predecessors and con¬
tained hints of European plein-air and
Impressionist painting before the latter
became preoccupied with broken col¬
our and the spectrum palette.
The open-form landscape became a
powerful tradition in Australia. It sur¬
vived the reductivist and universalizing

trends of late modernism to be reas¬
serted triumphantly in the landscapes of
Fred Williams. He has given contem¬
porary Australians a new vision of their
natural environment.
Until the 1960s, the predominantly
Anglo-Celtic society of Australia large¬
ly ignored the surviving Aboriginal cul¬
ture it had dispossessed and the cultures
which surrounded it in south-east Asia
and the Pacific. An important exception
to this trend was Margaret Preston who,
influenced by the "primitivism" of
modernism, turned to Aboriginal art for
inspiration and championed it as a
source for the establishment of a truly
Australian art. She admired and used the
dull earth colours of Aboriginal art and
its geometric shapes.
Ian Fairweather, an English artist
who had lived in China and south-east
Asia prior to arriving in Australia in
1934, successfully related his own work
to that of both Asian and Aboriginal art.

Gauguin one of the few artists of the
twentieth century to produce a creative
synthesis of eastern and western art
Fairweather's work deserves to be much
better known internationally than it is.

content to depend upon Britain for pro¬
tection and to offer nostalgic homage to
their European homelands. But when
Hitler over-ran western Europe in 1940
and the Japanese bombed Pearl Har¬
bour in 1941, the Australian nation ex¬
perienced a traumatic shock. For the
first time in their history, Australians
were forced to consider seriously who
they were and where they stood in the
world.
That shock gave Australian art re¬
newed vitality. A generation of artists
caught up in the tensions of a nation at
war began to construct a new kind of
Australian art from the humanist com¬
ponents of early modernism. Inspired
by surrealism, expressionism and
realism, some delved into their personal
anxieties and emerged with a new sense
of what it was to be Australian. Others
began to examine repressed aspects of
the Australian psyche, such as its treat¬
ment of Aboriginal people. Wartime
Australia produced a brilliant galaxy of
artists comparable to any grouping then
at work anywhere in the world. In
mood and presentation their work
ranges from the spritely early modern¬
ism of Sidney Nolan's paintings in the
Wimmera district of Victoria to the
brooding compassion of Noel
Counihan's paintings of Aboriginal
women.
Many of these artists continue to cre¬
ate important work and several possess
international reputations, but it was
during the 1940s and 1950s that their
work made its greatest impact upon
Australian culture.
In 1959 a group of seven painters, the
Antipodeans Charles Blackman,
Arthur and David Boyd, John Brack,
Bob Dickerson, John Perceval and
Clifton Pugh held an exhibition in
Melbourne in defiance of the powerful
waves of total abstraction then being
propagated in Australia, mainly from
New York. The event created an uproar
that has not yet subsided. What is still
not appreciated is that the position the
Antipodeans took constituted perhaps
the first effective criticism anywhere in
the world of the censorious aesthetic
limitations of late modernism.
During the 1960s Australian art was
colonized by successive waves of
American-type abstraction. Art fed
upon art almost exclusively. During the
past twenty years, a more pluralistic
position has been reasserted, the finest
achievements of which cannot yet be
assessed with any certainty. One hope¬
ful sign is the increased interaction be¬
tween the European and Aboriginal
sources of Australian art and the in¬
creasing cultural contacts with Asian
and Pacific art.
BERNARD SMITH was the Foundation Profes¬
sor of Contemporary Art and Director of the
Power Institute of Fine Arts at the University of
Sydney from 1967 to 1977, and was President of
the Australian Academy of the Humanities from
1977 to 1980. He is the author of European Vision

### 81727: At the frontiers of science and technology

At the frontiers of science
and technology
BY ROBYN WILLIAMS
Australian scientific brilliance
has been kept secret for far too
long. Although they consti¬
tute barely 0.3 per cent of the world's
population, Australians produce 2 per
cent of the world's scientific papers each
year. The standard of this work is of the
highest order and it is perplexing that
this should be so little known, both in
Australia and elsewhere. As Dr. Mike
Kenward, editor of New Scientist maga¬
zine, said at the ANZAAS (Australian
and New Zealand Association for the
Advancement of Science) Centenary
Congress in 1988, "both your wine and
your scientific achievements are very
well kept secrets!"
Among the pioneers of scientific re¬
search in Australia, Lawrence Hargrave
(1850-1915) was an aeronautical inven¬
tor who used kites to develop lighter-
than-air flying machines. The first large-
scale refrigerators were produced in
Australia, enabling ships to carry
Australian meat to Europe. Lord Florey
(1898-1968) was one of the triumvirate
responsible for making penicillin into a
usable drug and won a Nobel Prize for
his efforts.
Many of these achievements,
however, remained either well con¬
cealed in ivory towers or firmly linked
with establishments overseas. Then, af¬
ter the Second World War, Australian
science experienced an upheaval. One
important contribution to this was
made by a number of young British
scientists who had been engaged in radar
research and who came and settled in
Australia. They turned the skills they
had developed for plucking signals from
the sky to astronomy. An explosion in
astronomical research followed.
Today Australia has some of the best
telescopes on Earth: the optical tele¬
scope at the Anglo-Australian
Observatory in Coonabarabran, re¬
sponsible for finding what is perhaps the
most distant object in the universe,
10,000 million light years away; and the
huge radio dish telescope at Parkes,
The Anglo-Australian Observatory at Siding Spring
Mountain, near Coonabarabran, New South Wales, houses
one of the world's largest optical telescopes.

which carried to the world the famous
signals of American astronaut Neil
Armstrong making his first steps on the
Moon, and has since discovered several
important organic molecules in outer
space. In September 1988 the gigantic
Australia Telescope was inaugurated in
northern New South Wales. With its
several dishes on wide railtracks, it is
moveable and yet precise to a fraction of
a millimetre.
There is also a long tradition of
medical research in Australia. The col¬
ossus in this field was Sir Macfarlane
Burnet, who shared the 1960 Nobel
Prize for Physiology or Medicine with
Sir Peter Medawar of Britain for their
discoveries in immunology. Sir
Macfarlane was for many years director
of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in
Melbourne, where today scientists fight
cancer and carry out research into tro¬
pical diseases, especially malaria.
Next door almost, in the "square
mile" of medical institutes around the
University of Melbourne, is the Florey
Institute where scientists are seeking
remedies for high blood pressure and
trying to determine the interplay of hor¬
mones. One hormone, relaxin, has been
isolated and even produced by bacteria
using genetic engineering techniques.
This hormone is made naturally by the
body before childbirth, softening the
skeletal parts of the pelvis to allow the
baby's head through. Lack of relaxin is a
cause of cerebral palsy, so medical pro¬
vision of the hormone could be of spec¬
tacular importance.
Another idea which may have enor¬
mous significance is due to Professor
Ted Ringwood, a geologist at the
Australian National University, who
has developed a synthetic rock or glass
called Synroc which can be used for the
safe disposal of nuclear waste. Synroc
has been extensively tested and shown
to restrict the passage of radiation. It
now remains to be established that this
property will last for hundreds of years.
Australia also excels in geological re¬
search, especially in the study of deserti-

zones. Dry land farming methods are
linked to this kind of expertise, which
many Australians have taken to Asia
and Africa.
About 30 per cent of Australia lies in
the tropics and, accordingly, great ex¬
pertise is being acquired in the develop¬
ment of tropical farming methods, new
breeds of stock and varieties of grain,
and new ways of fighting pests. Perhaps
the most pleasing aspect of this, centred
on James Cook University in northern
Queensland, has been the exchange of
ideas with other countries in south-east
Asia and the South Pacific.
Perhaps the most spectacular dis¬
coveries in Australian science have been
in connection with the Australian past.
In biology and palaeontology there have
been extraordinary finds, including fos¬
sils entombed in rock at Riversleigh in
northern Queensland which were so ex¬
tensive that the air force had to be asked
to help carry them out. The picture of
early Australia they reveal is one of
gigantic monsters, of special lines of
adaptation, of animals such as marsupial
lions and wolves.

likely to use this facility. The world's
largest stellar interferometer (to study

most significant developments in astro¬

preferred option in a number of
countries.
But many Australians believe that
their greatest scientific contributions to
the rest of the world are more simple
though nonetheless profound. These
contributions are sometimes described
as "alternative technology", perhaps be¬
cause they seem less flashy and space-
age, perhaps because they adapt tradi¬
tional technologies. One example is a
scheme which uses sand to filter out
microscopic bugs to yield clean water.
Just that! Yet how many villages in how
many nations depend for their existence
on the flow of good sweet water? Such a
process may not make the headlines but
it is the kind of science Australians are
getting better at.

### 81729: Long-range learning: Australian education responds to the challenge of distance

Long-range learning
Australian education responds to the challenge of distance
BY MALCOLM SKILBECK
Australians have always had to
contend with the factor of dis¬
tance. Early forms of adapta¬
tion to remoteness and low population
density included the one-teacher school
and the itinerant teacher. Residential
facilities for students were also provided
at an early stage at State high schools in
provincial centres and at universities in
the capital cities of the States.
Early this century the primary and
secondary sectors of the State Education
Departments (together with the tertiary
sector, led by the Brisbane-based Uni¬
versity of Queensland) established cor¬
respondence programmes which have
since matured into a wide array of orga¬
nizations providing education at a dis¬
tance, such as the School of the Air, the
Correspondence School, and various
distance education networks and de¬
partments of external studies.
Despite differences of level, approach
and organization, these programmes all
subscribe to the principle that struc¬
tured, formal education in a very wide
range of subjects can and should be
made available to people regardless of
their physical location, their direct ac¬
cess to teachers, libraries and laborator¬
ies, their age or stage of educational
development.
	 32 	
The conventional view that formal
education is contingent on attendance at
schools, colleges or universities and pre¬
sence in classrooms, laboratories and
workshops, in face-to-face contact with
teachers, is not so much displaced as
expanded by the advocates of distance
education. All the elements of the con¬
ventional approach to teaching and
learning are translated into comparable
programmes of education at a distance
using all the available means of
communication.
While distance educators are in
theory ready to use whatever means and
media seem appropriate, in practice
selection is necessary, and it inevitably
takes into account practical considera¬
tions among which cost and utility rank
high. The written word is still the single
most important vehicle of distance
education at all levels.
The early emergence and success of
correspondence education at school and
university level depended, of course,
upon a comprehensive, reliable postal
service. Such a service, now taken for
granted, is relatively recent. In a country
the size of Australia, the establishment
of the postal service was a major public
sector achievement of the nineteenth
century.

ques. Graphics also play an important
role in the design and presentation of
text, and the use of audio and video

satellite broadcasts, is increasing. Tuto¬

### 81729: Long-range learning: Australian education responds to the challenge of distance

The challenge is to integrate all of
these elements into a comprehensive
teaching-learning system, using low
unit-cost technologies, and to make
education accessible to any student,
anywhere in the country, who can
benefit from the opportunities it pro¬
vides. Recognizing this formidable chal¬
lenge, the Federal Government, which
funds higher education, is now propos¬
ing significant changes, including a re¬
duction in the overall number of provid¬
ers of distance higher education from
over forty universities and colleges to
six national Distance Education
Centres.
While open access is the goal," the
number of students participating in dis¬
tance education programmes is still re¬
latively small. Of a total Australian uni¬
versity and college population of
420,000 in 1988, approximately 48,000
are enrolled in external, distance or off-
campus programmes. The trend of enrol¬
ments is, however, definitely upward.
The choice of subjects offered by dis¬
tance education in Australia is already
considerable, yet there is need for even
greater variety. Growth during the past
decade has resulted in a disproportion¬
ate provision of programmes and
courses in the arts, humanities and social
sciences. This is not surprising, nor is it
cause for regret. Institutions have re¬
sponded to student demand and have
satisfied many interests in so doing.
Furthermore, courses in these disci
plines have been easier to develop than
in those requiring more laboratory,
workshop or fieldwork provision.
The British Open University
pioneered the philosophy of the second
chance in higher education. Australian
institutions have followed suit and will
continue to explore this theme, for ex¬
ample in relation to groups that have
been under-represented in higher edu¬
cation: lower socio-economic groups,
Aborginals, and women (now,
however, in some subjects more strong¬
ly represented than men). But access to
distance education is increasingly
associated with trained professionals,
who need to upgrade or change their
skills.
Important as is the emphasis on the



needs of the professions and the con¬
tinuing commitment to the principle of
the "second chance", perhaps the
greatest challenge to higher distance
education lies in the continuing de¬
velopment, appraisal and renewal of
basic educational philosophies and
strategies. As the target groups change
to embrace an ageing, more highly edu¬
cated, professionally sophisticated and
consumption-conscious population,
education policies and approaches must
be adapted accordingly.

### 81730: The Australian cinema: from 'The Kelly Gang' to 'Crocodile Dundee'

The Australian cinema
From The Kelly Gang to Crocodile Dundee
«"MÍ^ BY KIM WILLIAMS
Poster from the Australian National
Film and Sound Archive, which has
a collection of around 29,000 films,
a quarter of a million film stills,
30,000 posters and 3,000 scripts.
The early decades of the twentieth
century saw a flourishing
period of feature film produc¬
tion in Australia. Film-makers had be¬
gun making documentaries of daily life,
combined film and slide shows, and
background films for stage plays as early
as 1 896. The highlight of this period was
The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906),
believed to be the first feature-length
film made in the world.
During the "Silent Era" (c. 1907-
1928) well over 150 Australian feature
films were produced, but by 1929 a
combination of forces the introduc¬
tion of sound films from overseas, an
increasing stranglehold on the local
market by American and British distri¬
butors and the devastation of the
Depression signalled a downturn in
Australian film production from which
it would take decades to recover.
The transition to sound in the early
1930s was costly and difficult, though a
few directors adapted to the new tech¬
nology and made commercially success¬
ful films dealing with Australian sub¬
jects, often located in the bush.
During the Second World War, fea¬
ture film output dropped as film-makers
were involved in newsreels and
documentaries. While production was
down, however, cinema attendances
reached an all-time peak in 1944-1945,
with 151 million admissions per year.
The post-war period brought an in¬
flux of British and American film com¬
panies attracted to Australia by its exo¬
tic locations. Few indigenous films were
produced. (A notable exception was
Charles Chauvel's Jedda of 1953, the
first Australian colour feature film
which dealt with relations between
Aboriginals and whites.)
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, a
period marked by social change, politic¬
al protest and cultural re-examination,
there was a burgeoning underground
film culture, based primarily in
Melbourne and Sydney. This period of
questioning and change created an en¬
vironment conducive to lobbying the
government to stimulate a national film
industry and provide the necessary
financial support. The government
accepted the cultural arguments and,
with its assistance, a "renaissance"
began.
The first films to emerge, such as Tim
Burstall's Stork and Alvin Purple and
Bruce Beresford's The Adventures of
Barry McKenzie, explored a strand of
Australian humour. They were all
financially successful in Australia and
overseas. There was a familiarity about
the uncultivated characters portrayed
which endeared these films to audi¬
ences, but some people found the raw¬
ness embarrassing and sought for a
more refined and sophisticated view of
Australia to be reflected in its cinema.
Films such as Sunday Too Far Away
and Picnic at Hanging Rock satisfied
this need for quality cinema rooted in
the Australian experience and/or the
literary tradition. A combination of
Australian landscape, good production
standards and a certain narrative sim¬
plicity became the symbols of the Au¬
stralian cinema, capturing the imagina¬
tion of international audiences and
generating national pride.
Funding for short drama, docu¬
mentaries and experimental works also
made it possible for new directors to
explore ideas and techniques and to ac¬
quire film-making skills. Many of these
films were adventurous and inventive.

Run, the story of a girl
riverboat skipper
in the late
19th century.
Some of today's well-known Australian
directors, such as Peter Weir and Gillian
Armstrong, made documentaries and
short dramas during this period.
Documentary film-making attracted
attention in the late 1970s as film¬
makers expanded their subject matter
and dealt with such themes as Asian and
Latin American politics, communism,
the environment and Aboriginal
society.
Partly as a result of escalating costs
and a desire to consolidate the economic
base for film production, in June 1981
the Federal Government introduced a
tax incentive scheme to attract more
private investment to feature films,
documentaries, telemovies and televi¬
sion mini-series.
The films produced in the first few
years of the tax incentive scheme in¬
cluded work by some of Australia's
best-known film-makers such as Bruce
Beresford (Puberty Blues), Gillian
Armstrong (Starstruck), George Miller
(Mad Max) and Peter Weir (The Year of
Living Dangerously). Some of them, in¬
cluding Breaker Morant, Mad Max 2
(also known as The Road Warrior),
Gallipoli, The Man from Snowy River,
Puberty Blues, Careful, He Might Hear
You and Phar Lap, were popular and
commercially successful.
Around this time film-makers were
also becoming interested in television
mini-series. The national and interna¬
tional success of A Town Like Alice in
1980 stimulated demand and, in the next
two years, ten mini-series were pro¬
duced. Historical subjects predomi¬
nated, ranging from the penal colonies
(For the Term ofHis Natural Life, Sara
Dane and Under Capricorn), bush-
ranging (The Last Outlaw), the pioneer
spirit (All the Rivers Run), the rise of
nationalism (Eureka Stockade), Abor¬
iginals (Women ofthe Sun), to industrial
unrest in the 1920s (Waterfront). Three
mini-series were on contemporary
themesReturn to Eden, a dramatic
love story; Silent Reach, about
big business in Queensland; and The
Dismissal, about the demise of the
Whitlam government.

however, it became evident in 1983 that,
after a boost of activity, the Australian
film industry was facing some serious
problems, and substantial cost increases
were undermining the economics of
film production.
The Australian Government, respon¬
sive to these problems and concerned
with the influx of speculative promoters
and the overall quality of production,
introduced a package which, on the one
hand, reduced the tax concessions and,
on the other, allocated a special fund of
$5 million to encourage the production
of high quality film and television with
commercial potential. The fund was to
be administered by the government's
statutory film authority, the Australian
Film Commission, which had been
established in 1975.
The industry was changing as heavy
reliance on direct government invest¬
ment was being replaced by private in¬
vestment. Producers were obliged to
guarantee investors some revenue and,
in order to do that, they had to sell
distribution rights before the film or
television project was made. To attract
the sort of backing required, they had to
look to distribution in the United States
and Europe. With such a dependence on
the international market, there was an
inherent tension between the objectives
of developing an Australian cinema and
the needs of distributors.
Many producers responded to the
challenge of how to make films which
are Australian in spirit but have an inter¬
national appeal. Audiences have re¬
sponded to such films as Crocodile
Dundee (1986), which is the most suc¬
cessful film ever released in Australia,
the largest grossing foreign film released
in the United States, and which broke
the all-time box office record in the
United Kingdom.
In addition, television mini-series
such as Return to Eden, The Anzacs,
Fields of Fire and The Last Frontier en¬
joyed success in the United States, the
United Kingdom and Europe. The two-
part Fields ofFire came fifth and sixth in
the National Top 10 ratings in the
United Kingdom, The Last Frontier
topped the mini-series ratings in the
United States with an estimated audi¬
ence of 65 million viewers, and All the
Rivers Run was seen by 75 million
viewers in the Soviet Union.
In November 1985 a co-production
programme was introduced to assist
Australian producers in collaborating
with foreign partners on approved co-
ventures and still receive the benefits of
the tax incentive scheme. Arrangements
are now in place with the Centre
National de la Cinematographic
(France), the British Broadcasting Cor¬
poration and Channel Four (United
Kingdom), the New Zealand Film
Commission and the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting (United States),
and are currently being negotiated with
Canada and Italy.
By mid-1985 it had again become
clear that the tax incentive scheme was
pushing producers to obtain extremely
high pre-sales, that the costs of attract¬
ing investment were rising significantly
and that there was uncertainty about the
level of finance available as the marginal
tax rate dropped. The industry's finan¬
cial base was shaky.
The Australian Film Commission



then proposed the creation of an inde¬
pendent Australian Film Finance Cor¬
poration to replace the film tax conces¬
sions. The corporation would operate
like a bank, securing its loans against the
rights in the programme, or against sales
agreements. On 1 July 1988, the Federal
Government established the Film Fi¬
nance Corporation with first-year fund¬
ing of $70 million. There is now a new
financial climate for film production in
Australia, and while there is some un¬
certainty as to how the new system will
operate, there is renewed optimism and
energy in the film and television
industry.

### 81731: The Land and the people; facts and figures

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Facts and figures
AUSTRALIA is the only nation to occupy an entire continent.
With a surface area of 7,682,300km2, it is nearly as large as the United States excluding
Alaska and Hawaii and almost twice the combined areas of India and Pakistan. The coastline
measures 36,735km.
It is the flattest continent. The average elevation is less than 300m, compared with
the world's mean of about 700m. Only about 5 % of the continent is more than 600m above
sea level. The highest peak is Mount Kosciusko (2,228m).
It is also the world's driest inhabited continent and vast areas are arid or semi-desert,
unsuitable for settlement. As a result it is sparsely populated, with an average of 2 persons
per km2.
Australia is one of the most urbanized nations : most of its 1 6 million people live in cities
and towns on the coastal fringes.
The climate ranges from tropical in the north to temperate in the south. Summer is from
December to February, autumn from March to May, winter from June to August, and spring
from September to November.
Immigration has played an important role in Australia's development since the earliest days
of European settlement. In the 4 decades since World War II, 4.2 million people from more
than 120 countries have settled there. Today, relative to population size, the immigration
intake (a projected 140,000 new arrivals for 1988) is larger than that of any other country. In
1986 one in every five Australians (3.4 million) was born overseas.
By origin the population comprises the following elements :
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (approx. 1 % of total population);
People from United Kingdom and Ireland backgrounds of 3 or more generations ago
(approx. 60 %);
People from non-English-speaking backgrounds of 3 or more generations ago
(approx. 5 %);
First and second generation Australians from an English-speaking background
(approx. 14 %);
Second generation Australians from a non-English-speaking background (approx. 8 %);
First generation Australians from a non-English-speaking background (approx. 12 %)
Some 15 % (1 .7 million people) of Australia's population aged 15 and over have a language
other than English as their first language. Major groups of non-English-speakers and their
numbers are asfollows: Italian: 440,776; Greek: 227,167; German: 165,633; Dutch: 110,540;
Polish: 86,016; Chinese: 85,000; Arabic: 77,565; Croatian: 65,882; Maltese: 60,000; Spanish:
56,500; Serbian: 27,000; Vietnamese: 27,252*. None of the 150 Aboriginal languages still
spoken has more than 3,000 speakers.
Comparison of trends between the censuses of 1976 and 1986 reveals that there has been
a significant increase in the number of speakers of Chinese, Arabic, Macedonian,
Vietnamese, Filipino languages, Spanish, Maltese, Portuguese and Polish.
During 1987 the Australian Government adopted a national policy on languages which has
as a major goal the encouragement of widespread bilingualism.
