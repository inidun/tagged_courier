### 73652: Dr. Huxley pays tribute to Mexico

Dr Huxley Pays Tribúte
to mexico
At the close of the Second Ge-
neral Conference of Unesco I feel
I must express my very deep satis-
faction and also my regret : satis-
faction at the results achieved, due
in large measure to the congenial
atmosphere surrounding the Confe-
rence, and regret at leaving this
unique country-with its wonderful
climate and scenery, and remar-
kable, above all, for the character
of the young race which inhabits
it-a melting pot in which two old
and vigorous cultures have been
fused.
We have found an inspiration
and an example to follow in the
spectacle of a country which, in
the midst of a troubled word. has
preserved its serenity and has done
more than any other in launching
à vast campaign against illiteràcy,
, aimed at developing strong and
healthy minds in men who to-
morrow will be the defenders of
peace.
The Conference held in Mexico <
City has demonstrated clearly the 
benefits to be derived from the idea j
that Unesco should come into direct I
contact with all different cultures.
In the past month we have seen I
, that what might be considered 
visionary is reality. We have seen !
living together in your beautiful 1country, united by the same ideal, ]
men and women of different races, I
cultures, languages, ideologies and j
religions, all working together
towards a common goal. And this,
it must be fully recognised, has
been made possible largely by the C
unbounded generosity of the Mexi- :
can Government and people. 
For the moment I am not'
speaking of all the material faci-
lities provided for us, including-the I
splendid building put at our dis-i
posal for the Conference head-I
quarters, but of the arduous prell-
minary work carried out by His :
Excellency the President, Licenciado]
Miguel Aleman, thanks to which'
'nearly all Latin America, has been
represented in this. Assemb : y ; and
of the example I spoke of a mo-
ment ago of those people who are
doing so much to carry education
and culture to the most inaccessible
parts of their country. This has
been a powerful stimulus to those
of us who seek to spread them to
the remotest corners of the earth.
It has been an honour for me
and for all of us to have as the
President of the Conference Licen-
ciado Don Manuel Gual Vidal, the
Minister of Public Education of
the Mexican Government, who has
spared no effort-to ensure the suc-
cess of the meting.
We shall never forget the ge-
nerous hospitality of the Govern-
ment or our warm welcome from
the whole people.
Neither can I omit to mention
the valuable co-operation given us
by the Mexican press. I think I am
not mistaken in saying'that the
whole press of the country was
interested in our work, as well as
a large group of foreign correspon-
dents, representing the principal
. newspapers of the world. The work
done by the correspondents of the,
Mexican papers has been a help
for which Unesco can never be
sufficiently grateful.
We have laid here the founda-
tions of a new spirit of universal
co-operation, which constitutes a
guarantee of peace ; and in clasping
the hand of the intellectuals of
Mexico we have shared with them
the grave responsibility for watch-
ing over the world we hope to build
for future generation.
And so, as we take our teave we
cannot say goodbye, for we carry
away with us the conviction that
Mexico lives side by side with the
rest of the world and that the
Englishman, the Chinese, the La-
banese, the Pole, the Australian,
simply because they are men of
goodwill, are, giving reality to the
ideals pursued by Mexico, which
are the ideals of all rightminded
peoples of the world.

### 73655: Highlights of projects and budget for 2nd year

Highlights of Projects
and Budget for 2nd y erl
Thee Second Session of Unesco's
General'Conference was the first
to permit a. review of progress
made by the Organisation. It lWas
the first opportunity for Unesco
to weigh its development with the
measure of actual experience.
It was also the first Unesco
Conference to be held away from
the headquarters in Paris, which
fact gave rise to many complex
and delicate, problems. At the
same time, the Conference-dedi-
cated-to strengthening the forces
of peace-convened during inter-
national conditions which were.
to say the least, very troubled.
Any fears or unhappy anticipa-
tions'were dispelled, however, by
the great goodwill, the willing-
ness for hard work and the
earnest and continuous desire to
co-operate which were manifest
during the meeting.
The 1948 budget was among the
first items on the Conference
agenda. fur this year, a ceiling
of eight million dollars was plac-
ed initially on the overall Unesco
budget. This innovation enabled
the working parties and the Pro-
gramme and Budget Commission
to draft their projects within the
budgetary limits designated. The
final budget, as ultimately adopt-
ed by the plenary session of the
Conference, was fixed at $7, 682,-
637.
The 1948 Unesco programme,
subject of detailed study and dis-
cussion at the Conference, was
divided into six. main chapters.
These, with the sums for each are
as follows :
Reconstruction............'$614, 141
Communication............ $1. 714, 722
Education..... ........... $854, 551
Cultural Interchange... $530. 237
Social and Human Re-
lations..................... $327, 236
Natural Sciences......... $918. 926
These allocations total $4, 959,-
813 for 1948, leaving something
over two million dollars for ad-
ministrative purposes, for the next
session of the General Conference,

### 73651: M. Maritain calls for unity

M MARtTAIN
CALLS FOR UNITY
I, The text of the Unesco Appeal(printed in the adjoining column)
was placed before the General
Conference by the President of
the IFrench Delegation, M. Jacques
Marltain. It is based upon the
principles expounded at the begin-
ning of the Conference, by the
famous French philosopher, who
declared :
"We mett at a particularly crave
moment tn the world's history. In face
of tnternatienat tension and growins
antagonism ; the, danger of which it would
he vain to underestimate, vast sections of
pubtic opinion risk abandoning themsetves
to the idea ef the inevitability of war".
"What makes Unesco's task seem at
first paradoxical is that it presupposes"
unity of thought among men whose
conceptions, are different and even op
posed However deew we BO there is no
lager any common basis for speculatlvp
thought. In these conditions is unity of
thought conceivable ?'" \
This cnity is possiMe, answered M
Marltaln, because Unesco's ends are prat.
tical ones :"Agreement may still result
spontaneeusty, not from a common spa-
culative philosophy but from a common
practical philosophy. This is enough tut
launch a great enterprise".

### UNINDEXED_ARTICLE

The school was built to hose
nearly 12. 000 students, and included

system.

of warning which was the keynote
the month-ong meetings.
"We are me"he d"clared,"at
a crucial moment for humanity."
President Aleman urged the assem-
bled delegates to strive for the
creation of a"mind for peace"as
an'antidote to the tensions which
are a stumbling block to interna-
tional cooperation,,"I consider
the work of Unesco in the field

### 73657: Natural sciences: practical steps for international cooperation among scientists

NATURAL SCIENCES
PRACTICAL STEPS FOR INTERNATIONAL
,'
CO OPERATION AMONG SCIENTISTS
..
The Importance of international co-operation in the natural
sciences, pure and applied, both as an essential element in an inte-
grated world civilisation, and as an immediate factor for peace, was
given great emphasis by Unesco's General Conference. The suc-
cesses already achieved in the natural sciences during 1947 serve as a
firm foundation for continued and  _
expanded.. activities in 1948,
The Field Science
Co-operation Offices System
A system of Field Science Co-
operation Offices was put into
operation in 1947. The aim of these
offices is to link together in, every
possible way the scientists and
technologists of the countries less
advanced in modern science and
technology, with their colleagues in
the more highly developed'coun-
tries to facilitate international co-
operation in science. During 1948
the highest priority has been plac-
ed on the maintenance of offices
now functioning in the Middle
Eas. t, Far East and Latin America
and on the establishement of a new
office in South Asia.
By
Dr. Joseph Needham
The office in Latin America will
be closely co-ordinated with the
project of the International Insti-
tute of the Hylean Amazon. A panel
of Latin America experts is to
be convened to advise on the best
ways in which the development of
science in Latin\ America can be
assisted in the futur. e.
. The Middle East office has been
most successful and has rendered
useful services to scientists in this
area including Alexandria. Cairo.
Teheran and Baghdad.
The Far East Office, which at
present serves China and the Phi-
lippines, is taking over UNRRA's
engineering education programme
in China which involves super-
vision of the distribution of
2, 000, 000 U. S. dollars worth of
engineering equipment to Engi-
'neering colleges.
The'àouth Asia office will serve
Burma, Siam, Indonesia as well as
India and, it is expected, will
receive the same enthusiastic sup-
port accorded to the other offices
"already established.
Aid to International
Scientific Organisations
This'is the second of the two
main'pillars of tile programme. If
the first pillar, the Field Science
Co-oneration Offices. are the Mis-
, sions. the international scientific
and technological organisations are
the Church. Since scientific know-
ledge is inherently international
and the accumulation of new know-
ledge is tremendously aided by
international co-operation, scientists
are particularly. well fitted to de-
monstrate how people of all coun-
tries can worn together on con-
crete problems. To extend and
maintain the effectiveness of inter-
national non-governmental scien-
tific ol'2'anisations alreadv in exis-
tence. grants-in-'jd and other
similar forms of assistance will he
gives during 1948
Attention will be especially direct-
ed toward encouraging the creation
of suitable organisations of scien-
tists in the apulied fields of en.
2sneering, agriculture and medicine
where they do not already exist.
since in pure science there is the
International Council of Scientij : ic
Unions. which, together with the
Unions it federates, has proven of
great effectiveness. As in the Dure
sciences, the engineering sciences
are the sole responsibility of Unesco
among the Specialized Agencies of
the'United Nations.
In the fields of agricultural and
medical sciences Unesco will con-
tinue to work in close co-operation
on problems of common interest
with the Food and Agriculture
Organisation CFAO) and the World
Health Organisation Interim Com-
, mission (WHOIC). in particular,
the World Health Organisation
Interim Commission has been ask-
ed for full co-operation with Unes-
co's efforts to establish a Perma-
nent Co-ordinating Bureau of
Medical Sciences Organisations.
A sum of $240, 000 has been allo-
cated for assistance in the form of
grants-in-aid to scientific organisa-
tions to cover transportation of
. outstanding scientists to interna-
tional conferences. the publication
of invaluable reports and journals,
and to assist in the operation of
established international labora-
tories and the maintenance of
stockrooms of special materials and
biological specimens.
Popularisation of Science
During 1948, in-co-operation
with appropriate international
organisations, a report on the
popularising work of existing
national organisations will be pre-
pared and circulated to Member
States in order to encourage the
establishment of organisations for
this purpose in countries not pos-
sessing them. Steps will also be
taken to stimulate th : preparation
and exchange, by various agencies,
of material that wi'l contribute to
the popularisation of science.
In the popularisation of. the
social and international implica-
tions of science, the primary prob-
lem is the correct evaluation of
implications, usually in the face of
very complex situations. The
achievement of the objectives of
the United Nations and of its
specialised agencies depends to a
considerable extent on a knowledge
of the international significance of
a mass of scientific and tech-
nological developments-not only of
recent key discoveries and inven-
tions, but also of those that have
accumulated over the last several
decades.
In 1948. Unesco will promote basic
research on the social relations of
science through its fellowship pro-
gramme and other available means.
It will request all Member States,
National Commissions and Co-
operating Bodies to initiate
throughout each country group
discussions and debates on the
social and international implica-
tions of a scientific subject to be
proposed by Unesco. The results
of these discussions will be analys-
ed and given the widest distribu-
tion possible.
During the year steps will be con-
tinued toward the ultimate prepara-
tion by suitable scholars) of books
which will provide, for the gen-
- erl and specialist reader, a wider
understanding of. the scientific and
cultural aspects of the history of
mankind, of the mutual inter-
dependence of copies and cultures
and of their, contributions to the
common heritage.
"
Emergency Aid
To-day, thousands of scientific
workers in devastated countries are
still out of action for lack of the
simplest chemicals and apparatus.
As far as Unesco's own funds
and funds from outside sources
permit, every assistance will be
given to bring about scientific re-
construction. and rehabilitation.
The orld Liaison Centre
For Science
Preparations were initiated in
1947 and will be continued in 1948
for setting up anC operating a
Scientific Apparatus Information
Bureau for assisting experimen-
talists in devastated countries,
those in regions served by the Field
Science Co-operation Offices and,
in special cases, in countries with
a high degree of active scientific
research. This Bureau'will also
make contributions, in co-operation
with other'international bodies,
toward the standardisation and
rationalisation of experimental and
teaching apparatus.
Unesco has accepted the invita-
tion of the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations to
participate in the preparations for,
and deliberations of, the Scientific
Conference on the Conservation
and Utilisation of Resources
schedtded to be held in 1949
Related to this forthcoming con-
ference will be Unesco's preparation
during 1948 for convening in 1949
an International Conference on thP
Protection of Nature.
In 1948 UNes. co plans to convene a
conference in Paris to consider the
establishment and maintenance of
high altitude research stations for
the study of the effects of high
attitudes on life and of physical
phenomena observable only at high
altitudes.

### 73659: National Commissions to play big role, UNESCO Conference agrees

National Commission : s
to Play Big Role
y g
UNESCO, CONFERENCE AGREES
I. t'
At its Second Session, the General Conference concentrated its
attention in the field of External Relations on the following six
questions of primary importance :
I.-Development of National
Commissions and National
Co-operating Bodies
Special efforts will be made in
1948 to encourage the establishment
of National Commissions or Co-
operating Bodies in, countries where,
they do. not yet exist, and to stimu-
late their development in countries
where they were established in 1947. I
The Conference was unanimous :
in emphasising that National Com-
missions were of vital importance :
to the success of Unesco.
In additipn to the role of consul-
tative and liaison bodies assigned
to them by Unesco's Constitution,
the National Commissions should
become working organs and play,
an active part in the execution of
Unesco's programme. It is only in
this, way that Unesco's aims can
be achieved.-
In order to ensure this develop-
ment, Unesco will give assistance,
at their request, to Member States
who are setting up National Com-
missions. Programmes of work
suited to the possibilities and tra-
ditions of each Member State will
be drawn up for individual National
Commissions. Close contact will be
maintained both between the head-
quarters of the Organisation and
the National Commissions and belt-1
ween the Commissions themselves.
With a view to-strengthening these
contacts, news about the Commis-
sion's activities will be published
regularly.
A conference for exchange of
information between the represen-
tatives of the different National :
Commissions and of Unesco will be.
held at the time of the next Ses-
sion of the General Conference.
II.-Relations with Germany
and Japan
The General Conference instruc-
ted the Director-General-to study,
in consultation with the Allied
Occupation Authorities, the possi-
bility of extending the benefits of,Unesco's programme, on an expe-
rimental basis, to Germany and ;

contribute to the democratic re-
orientation of their educational and
cultural life.
. III.-Regional Centres
The possibility of setting up
Uneseo Regional Centres was the
subject of long discussions during
the Mexico Conference.
The Latin American, Indian,
Chinese and Middle East dele-
gations showed keen interest in this
project. The Cuban delegation
generously offered to place at
Unesco's disposal the offices re-
quired for the establishment of a
Regional Centre in Havana, ant ;
in addition, a sum of $10, 000.
Because of the complex adminis-
trative. and financial problems
involved in the creation of Regional
Centres, and because of the doubts,
as to the timeliness of this step
expressed by certain delegations,
which considered it premature, the
General Conference made no finial
decision ; it instructed the Executive
Board to make a further study of
the question, after consulting the
United Nations'and other Specia-
lised Agencies on their intentions
in the matter.
IV.-Co-operatlon with
Non-Member States'
In order to ensure the widest possi-
ble participation in Unesco's surveys,
conferences and other activities, re-
presentatives of non-Member States
may-be in'9ited to co-oiJerate when-
ever their participation appears de-
sirable and possible.
As in the past, states which
belong to the United Nations, but
not to Unesco, will be invited to
send observers to the sessions of the
General Conference.
At present, there are 57 M. ember
States in the United Nations.
Forty countries are members of
Unesco.
V... :..- Relations with
the United Nations and its
Specialised Agencies
The Conference',.. unanimous]y
stressed the importance of close
friendly co-operation between Unes-
co and the United Nations in ac-
cordance with the agreement bet-
ween the two organisations.
All steps will be taken to secure
close co-ordination with the United
Nations in matters of financial and
budgetary administration as well
as in the varied field of program-
ming.
The Conference expressed its sa-
tisfaction with the agreements,
rec. tently concluded between Unesco
and the International Labour Orga-
nisation and between Unesco and
the Food and Agriculture Organi-
sation. It Instructed the Director-
General to develop effective co-
ordination with the other Specia-
lised Agencies, whose interests and
activities are related to Unesco's
purposes. In particular, the Prepa-
ratory Commission of the Interna-
tional Refugee Organisation will be
contacted with a view to including
Displaced Persons in Uneseo's ap-
peals for assistance to war-devas-
tated (Countries.
VI.-Relations with other
Organisations
The Conference decided to pro-
pose to the International Bureau
of Education that the agreement
providing for technical co-operation
with this organisation in the field
of education should be renewed.
The agreements concluded with
the International Council of Scien-
tific Unions and the International
Studies Conference will also remain
in force.
A new policy was adopted gov-
erning relations between Unesco
and International Non-Governmen-
tal Organisations dealing with ques-
tions falling within Uneseo's field
of interest. Consultative arrange-
ments will be made with certain
of these organisations to ensure
their participation in Unesco's acti-
vities, where appropriate, and their
representation by Dbservers at the
sessions of the General Conference.
It is planned to set up, under
Unesco's auspices, Consultative
Committees, grouping together In-
ternational Non-Governmental Or-
ganisations working in the sam
field (such as students and women'tut
organisations).

### 73662: Free flow of ideas debated

"Free Flow
of Ideas 
Debated
Delegates Express Views at
W'orking Party Meetings
on Mass Communications
'lively debate marked the discus-
sions on the"Free Flaw of Informa-
tion"during the meetings of the
Working Party on Mass Communi-
cations at the Unesco General Con-
ference recently held in Mexico
City. The discussions were centered
around varying points of view
characteristic of the state of the
world today.
Dr. Adolf Hoffmeister of Cze-
choslovakia criticised the principles
of classical liberalism. He asserted
that unrestricted competition in the
field of mass communications was
a. danger to existing cultures I
especially for those cultures with'
relatively meagre financial and
technical resources.
Dr. Hoffmeiste1'further de-
nounced the evils of irresponsible
information, subservient to com-
mercial interests, particularly in the
United States, which he described
as eager for sensational and vulgar
reports to the detriment of truth,
culture and peace.
Mr. Antoni Slonimski of Poland
expressed a similar point of viewand sharply attacked certain sec-
tions 01 the press, radio and cinema
in the United States.
Speaking for the British delega-
tion, Mr. J. B. Priestley stated that
this question was not of primacy
importance to Unesco's 1948 pro-
gramme, since it ways one of infinite
controversy, beyond the powers of
Unesco to solve effectively. The
obstacles to the free flow of infor-
mation, he declared, stem directly
from political and economic factors
in the contemporary world situation
over. which an organisation such as
Unesco has no control. Unesco
should aim rather at stimulating
the production and dissemination
'of Information on questions of edu-
cation, science and culture.
In the face of this criticism, Mr.
Lloyd Free explained the position
of the American delegation. Leav-
ing to others the task of adjudging
the merits and the deficiencies or
the errors of American information
organs, Mr. Free categorically
denied allegations that the United
States were, consciously or un-
consciously, embarked on a plan of
"cultural imperialism"for either
political or economic purposes. The
free flow of information, the Amer-
ican delegate declared, is not a
one-way affair, but rather a system
of reciprocal interchange on a basis
of equality wherever possibly. The
United States, he added, was not
unaware of the technical drawbacks
of the different countries of the
word, and for this reason had
volunteered to play an important
part in Unesco's plan for aiding
poorly equipped nations to rebuild
or develop their technical facilities.
While admitting the need for a
deeper sense of responsibility tow-
ards the public by journalists and
newsmen, and suggesting that this
might be achieved through improv-
ed professional training, Mr. Free
pointed out that freedom itself,
nevertheless, was the crux of the
whole problem. Without freedom,'
he said, neither information nor :
. culture could exist. Freedom, he
added, was one of the principle
aims of Unesco, as defined in its
Constitution, and this major obliga-'
tion culd not be evaded.
Mr. Free, undoubtedly, is not
una-ware of the present difficulties
of the task. The ideal, at least, must
be cpnstantly kept in the minds of
men, even if this means employing
limited measures arid achieving
limited progress.
Several delegations attempted to
show that a middle path was pos-
sible and that the two opposing
points of view could and should
be considered expressions of com-
plementary rather than wholly
incompatible liners of action. This
middle-of-the-road view was taken
by France (M. Joxe). Australia
(Mr. Dunbabin), Mexico (Sr. San-
bago de la Vega) and Canada (Mr.
Dilwaring).
In the final analysis this com-
promise opinion prevailed and is
reflected in the balanced pro-
gramme for Mass Communications
as finally adopted by the General
Conference.

### 73663: Production unit planned: mass media to be used for peace

Left to right : Mr. A. S ! onimsM of Poland ; Mr. R. Calder and Mr. J. B. Priestley of the United Kingdom,
three members of the Working P arty on Mass communications at the General Conference who
helped formulate Unesco'jI challen ging programme for 1918 in the fie ld of radio, films and the press.
Production Unit Planned
MASS MEDIA TO BE USED
FOR PEACE
FAR-REACHING measures to mo-bilisé the resources of press.
radio and film for peace will be
undertaken by Unesco in 1948. An
impressive list of activities was
planned during the) month-long
Conference at Mexico City by dele-
gates from forty Member States.
Daring-1947, Unesco carried out
a Survey of Technical Needs in
12 countries of Europe and the Far
East. The survey, which was pub-
lished in September, 1947, in both
French and English, gave the first
detailed picture of its kind of losses
and deficiencies in equipment, man-
power and raw materials in the
press, film and radio industries. In
view of the success of this first
study, Unesco will extend its in-
quiries in 1948 to Central and South
America, to India, Burma, Malaya,
Thailand, Indonesia and the new
Member States in Europe (Italy,
Austria, Hungary and Switzerland).
Furthermore, Unesco will launch
a world-wide appeal during the
coming year ; for contributions to a
special fund designed to help war-
devastated countries rebuild their
media of mass communication so
sorely hit during the last war.
In order to promote the use of
mass media towards understanding
and co-operation among nations
and disseminate more extensively
the cultural wealth of the world,
the. United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisa-
tion will give high priority to the
study of positive measures for the
reduction of obstacles to the free
flow of information. The obstacles
that Unesco will attempt to break
down include excessive postal and
télegraph charges ; high tariff walls,
consorship, quotas, currency and
postal restrictions, to educational,
scientific and cultural materiaL
In this, Unesco will work closely
with the UN Commission on Human
Rights, the Sub-COmmission Óf In-
formation and of the Press, the
Universal Postal Union, the Inter-
national. Telecommunications Union
and other agencies engaged in
similar work.
lnterhationalldeas Bureau
Although it is important, and
indeed necessary, that meetings of
science, education and cultural spe-
cialists be organised, Unesco can
become a truly world movement
only when the ordinary people
take an active interest and share
in its work. In this light, the crea-
tion of a special Production Unit
working with top-flight radio pro-
ducers, film producers and news-
papermen, assumes special signi-
ficance. Knbwn as the International
Ideas Bureau, the production unit 
will promote special programmes.
documentary and feature films. I
news stories, articles and books to ;
get across to the world the ideas'
Unesco stands for and thus encou-
rage a greater sense of cultural'
solidarity among peoples. The head-'
quarters of the International Ideas
Bureau will be located in Paris, but J
sections of the unit will probably J
be based in other countries in order J
to facilitate productivity.'

John Crierson
Four key themes of world signi-
ficance within the field of Unesco's
interest will be mapped'out during
1948. Each theme will then be
tackled by top-notch writers and
newsmen, aided by world-famous
authors, specially engaged for the
occasion, who will produce a series
of highly readable articles, stories
and"reportages"for publication in
newspapers, magazines and periodi-
cals throughout the world.
Simultaneously, a squad of script
writers and radio producers, sup-
ported by nationally famous artists,
playwrights and producers, will
make available to the radio public,
feature programmes and dramatisa-
tions built around the same themes.
These programmes will be broadcast
in various languages over medium,
long and short wave bands.
At the same time the film experts
at Unesco will endeavour to get the
same themes covered by newsreels
aid, treated either in documentary
or feature films.
In addition to the joint projects
envisaged for the development of
Mass Media Major Themes, Unesco
will also undertake, during the com-
ing year,'separate production pro-
grammes in the field of radio and
films.
In the field of radio, for example,
a World University of the Air is
scheduled for 1948. It will work in
close co-operation with existing
radio networks in Member States.
not in competition with them. The
plan is to get the products of the
world's best brains and best talents
across to all peoples so that cultural
knowledge and progress will not be
contained within political frontiers.
In this way Frenchmen can get to
know what the Brazilians are doing
in literature, music and drama, the
Poles can get to know about the :
literature of India, the Italians
about Canadian and U. S. science
and education, rather than only
about their political differences.
Unesco will collaborate in the
operation of a United Nations
World Radio Network if the UN
decides on its establishment. If
not, Unesco is to examine the
establishment of its own. Until that
decision is made, however, emphasis
: will be placed on co-operation with
, existing radio stations and efforts
to increase their programmes in the
, cause of peace and understanding
between nations. In this connection
Mass Media radio specialists will
prepare a restricted number of
high-quality transcribed program-
mes to be circulated for use on
national hook-ups. Surveys of con-
cepts, techniques and results obtain-
ed in the use of radio in school
broadcasting by Member States will
also be carried out. This data will
ultimately be published so as to
encourage a more extensive use of
radio as an educational instrument.
In the development of its film
programme Unescb will promote the
production of a series of documen-
tary film dealing with the achieve-
ments of a selected number of in-
dividual nations as well as subjects
concerning whole groups of nations.
These documentaries, of an educa-
tional. scientific and cultural Ma-
ture, will be produced by the co-
operative action of Unesco Member
States for national and interna-
tional distribution.
Staff specialists of the cinema
will also study the problem of the
inexpensive production of film pro-
jectors in the hope that this will
ultimately encourage the cheap
manufacture of all types of equip-
ment used for mass communica-
tions.
International Press Institute
'To strengthen ties and contact
among journalists throughout the
world, Uneco will help the crea-
tion of an International Ins-
titute of Press and Information.
The Institute will facilitate
exchanges of techniques and
materials in processing of editorial
ideas and standards. It is hoped
that the feeling of unity among
the world's pressmen will be
strengthened and that mass com-
munication techniques wUI be im-
proved throughout the world
through clearing-house activities,
study grants and scholarships.
The Second General Conference
in Mexico stressed the importance
of such scholarships as a means
for training film, radio and press
personnel in devastated and de-
ficiency countries. (Details of
Unesco's programme for scholar-
ships will be found elsewhere on
this page.)
Of Unesco's overall budget for
1948, totalling just under 7, 700, 000
dollars, some 900, 000 dollars will be
devoted to the field of mass com-
munications. Unesco believes that
this is a small price to pay-a bill
shared proportionately by its forty
member states-to help outweigh
the tensions, the prejudices and
antipathies, and to help build in
their place a stronger sense of
world community among all peo-
ptes.

### 73665: Surveys in mass media broadened: press, radio, film needs of new Member States to be studied

Surveys in
Mass Media
Broadened
Press, Radio. Film Needs
Oaf new Member States
To Be Studied
During 1947, Unesco carried out
a survey in'twelve war-devastated
countries on technical needs in
press, radio and films. Ten surveys
were made in Europe and included
Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece,
Luxembourg, Norway, the Nether-
lands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia. Two surveys were also
carried out in the Far Eastern
countries of China and the Philip-
pines. The information thus ob-
tained will permit an estimate of
the amount of assistance that
should be given to these countries.
The Conference charged Unesco
with promoting the re-building
of the means of mass media in
the twelve countries indicated above.
In addition, the Second General
Conference voted tha : this survey
should be continued and extended
during 1948, not only to the war-
devastated nations but to those
countries which lack the necessary
technical facilities essential for
press, radio and film work.
Although a complete list of the
countries to be surveyed in 1948 has
not as yet been definitely establish-
ed, it is possible to state that
Unesco will carry out surveys, sub-
ject to the approval of the govern-
ments concerned, in the following
regions :
(I).--Those war-devastated coun-
tries not yet studied ; Albania, Aus-
tria, BuJKaria, Finland, Hungary,
Italy and Roumania.
(II).-Member States of Unesco
in Central and Southern America :
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba,
Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico,
Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay
and Venezuela.
(III).-Several countries in the
Far East : India, Thailand, Burma,
Malaya and Indonesia.

### 73666: 48 scholarships to be awarded war-hit nations

48 Scholarships
to be Awarded
War-Hit Nations
RESOLUTION of the Generalconference on the Internatio-
nal Exchange of. Persons stressed
the role of Unesco as a clearing-
house of information and analysis
on all international educational in-
terchange-governmental or private
- and instructed the Secretariat to
initiate enquiries with Member
States on the international, move-
ment of persons for educational
purposes.The Conference urged that studies
be made, in collaboration with
appropriate organisations, of the
barriers which impede the mter-
change of persons among na-
tions, such as lack of transport
facilities, difficulties of currency
excC. 1ange or restrictive laws, or re-
gulations of Member States. A
study of the role of international
cultural conventions in promoting
the exchange of persons was also
urged.
The Conference authorised the
grant of sufficient funds for ten
fellowships or equivalent expendi-
ture in travel grants"to be award-
ed in exceptional cases where
Unesc6's purposes are clearly in-
volved and where no other funds
are available."These direct grants
are in addition to 48 fellowships
authorised by the Exeeutive Board
on the eve'of the Mexico City
Conference, to cover six grants to
each of the following war-devastated
States : China, Czechoslovakia, Den.
mark, Greece, the Netherlands, Nor-
way, the Philippines and Poland.
Subjects to be covered by these
fellowships are Science and Social
Development, Cinema and Radio
Education, Educational Problems of
War-affected Children, Librarian-
ship, Educational Administration
and Art and Music Education. They
will be for a period of six months
In addition, Unesco will continue
to administer fellowships in colla-
boration with accredited donor
agencies and will offer its services
as requested in the planning and
promotion of international fellow-
ship and study programmes.
Priority is to be given to the
needs of war-devastated Member
States and to the promotion of
opportunities for mature persons :
professors, artists, government of.
ficers, expert, leaders in adult
education and industrial and aged.

### 73667: Fundamental education

Fundamental
Education
By John Bowers
OE small boy, quarrelling withanother in the streets of Mexico
City, was overheard by a Brazilian
delegate to the Second General
Conference of Unesco flinging a
parting gibe at his opponent :"What
you need is Fundamental Educa-
tion !""Educacion Basica"had be-
come a catch phrase in the Latin-American countries.
In the Conference Hall too, it
soon became clear that Fundamen-
tal Education had caught the ima-
gination of the delegates as a pro-
ject whereby Member States would
receive practical, help from Unesco
in a practical and urgent task-
the task of establishing"a mini-
mum fundamental education for
all their citizens."
It is with this task in view that
Unesco will seek in 1948 to link up
, the scattered and often isolated
fundamental education enterprises
in the territories of its member sta-
tes into a concerted world move-
ment.
The General Conference'gave the
project a. clear field of operation,
endorsing a definition of the aims
and purposes of Fundamental Edu-
cation wherein it was laid down
that the project should be"spe-
cially and immediately concerned
with the less advanced regions of
the world and. with th3 under-pri-
vileged groups in industrialísed
countries,. where the education pro-
vided falls below the essential mi-
nimum",'
There had been a tendency,. when
, the term"Fundamental Education".
was first coined, to regard'it as no
more and no less than a campaign
against illiteraey, but it soon be-
came clear that the skills of read-
ing and writing were only of value
as a. means to a wider end. This
wider aim of Fundamental Educa-'
tioh has now been defined-"to help
met and women to live fuller and
happier lives in adjustment with
their changing environment, to
develop the best elements of their
own'culture, and to achieve the
economic and social progress which
will enable them to take their place
in the, modern world.","Fundamen.
tal Education should thus be de-
signed to provide a first step to
further education :"
Literacy not only Aim°°
While, therefore, universal lite-
racy will be a desirable ideal, the,teaching of reading and writing is
not the only putpose of Funda-
mental Education.
The work of the Mexican Cul-
, tural Missions provided a striking
case in point. The who : e life of
one remote little Indian village,
which was visited by delegates from
the Gneral-Confèrence, was being
transformed by a team of six"Fun-
, damental, Educators."They were
teaching the peasants to pipe their
water supply, to combat disease ; to
grow better fruit and crops, to build
weather-proof houses and make de-
cent furniture, to bake better bread
and to weave and sew. but had
not so far taught them to read and
write. However, the foundations, of
a village school had been laid. So
it is with fundamental education.
Literacy teaching and the exnsion
and improvement of primary
schooling will take their place in a
wider programme of community
education for better living.
Fundamental Education will"be
concentrated first on the most
pressing, problems of each parti-
cular community."More often than
not, these will be-disease and
poverty. Over vast regions of the
globe human communities, which
have scarcely risen above the civi-
lisation of the Iron-Age, are living
at a bare subsistence level-un-
derhoused, underfed, and underclo-
thed, their vitality sapped by
disease. Their agriculture-if such
it can be called-consists of hifting
cultivation with the hand-hoe or
the wooden plough. These untold
acres of potentially productive land
might well alleviate, by a surplus
production the world food shortage.
Instead, their fertility is being
dissipated by improvident agrioul-
ture, leading to erosion and soil
sterility, while. their populations
demand heavy importations of
foodstuffs and not infrequently
emergency famine relief. If it can
hep the people of these regions to
rid themselves of endemic, disease,
to improve their agriculture and to
develop a balanced economy-in
short, 10 live fuller and more pro-
ductile lives-then Fundamental
Education will make a real and
urgently needed contribution to
world recovery.
With this end in view, Unesco's
Fundamental Education policy will
be closely coordinated with the
work of the World Health Organi-
sation and the Food and Agricul-
ture Organisation of the Un : ted
Nations. It is hoped that at least
one practical joint undertaking
between W. H. O.. F. A. O. and Unesco
PROGRAMME FOR 1948
I'
will be realised in a Fundamental
Education"Pilot Project".
In dealing with underprivileged
groups in industrialised areas and
with the problems of trust terri-
tories Unesco will also co-operate
respectively with the ILO and the
trusteeship Department of UN.
The Fundamental Educat'on pro-
ject will operate in 1948 as one of
seven priority undertakings'in
Unesco's Education Programme.
Among the staff of men and women
are included Americans, Austra-
lians, British, Chinese, Danish,
French and Haitians and it is
hoped that a Mexican and an Arab
will soon be added..
In 1948 Uneseo will take the ful-
lest possible advantage of the ser-
vices of a Panel. of Experts. A/list
of more than 400 persons with spe-
cial experience in Fundamental
Education has already been com-
piled and invitations will shortly be
sent to a selected number to be-
come members of the Funds : rental
Education Panel.
This Panel will provide a world-
wide body of experts, who will be
kept in touch with the latest de-
velopments in Fundamental Educa-
tion through Unesco's Information
Two international exhibitions organised by Unesco-one dealing with Libraries and Museums and
the other with Fundamental Education and Reconstruction in Education-were shown for the first time
during the General Conference in Mexico City. The Fundamental Education exhibition, which is pictured
here, stresses the great problems which must be faced in providing at least Fundamental Education for wall,
Service, and will be ready to res-
pond to requests for expert advice,
by correspondence, by analys : ng and
commenting upon documents and
educational materials, by encou-
raging an informed and active in-
terest in Fundamental Education
and by visiting Fundamental Edu-
cation projects in their own and
other countries, as well as attending
national and international confe-
rence. as Unesco's consultants and
advisers.. Two meetings of the Panel
of Experts will be held in 1948. one
in Paris early in summer and ano-
ther later in the year, probably in
a South American country.
It will be one of Unesco's most
important jobs to keep workers in
one part of the world in touch
with the latest developments in
other areas, and to supply them
with the most advanced technical
advise and information. The Secre-
tariat will therefore act as a
"clearing house"through. which an
increasing flow of information-a
two-way flow-will crs-fertilise
the many enterprises in Fundamen-
tal Education in all Unesco's Mem-
ber States.
A periodical Fundamental Educa-
tion Bulletin will be published by
Unesco and given wide circulation
in Unesco's working languages, with
free rights of translation and dis-
tribution. Longer and more techni-
cal documents on every aspect of
Fundamental Education will be cir-
culated in mimeographed form. The
part which the Panel of Experts
will play has already been men-
tioned ; there will also be a close
tie-up between the Technical Infor-
mation service and Unesco's so-
called"Associated"and"Pilot"Pro-
jects.
All over the world interesting and
import'ant enterprises are contri-
buting to the Fundamental Educa-
tion movement.
They include territory-wide un-
dertakings like the'Chinese Mass
Education Movement or, the Mexi-
can Cultural Missions, tribal de-
velopment schemes, such as are
growing up in Africa, village im-
provem-ent projects in India, lite-
racy campaigns now being carried
out in Brazil and the South Ame-
rican'countries, Teachers'Training
Schools, Medical or Agricultural
L. C. Extension schemes, or major
economic development under-
takings, such as the British Over-
seas Food Corporation's Ground-
nuts Scheme in Tanganyika.
Associated Projects
It is Unesco's aim to bring the
most significant of these scattered
enterprises into a World Funda-
mental Education Movement, by
linking them up as Associated Pro-
jects to Unesco's network, wherever
such a link is desired.
Each Associated Project will ap-
point its own liaison officer to send
to Unesco general and technical re-
ports and tc receive in return indi-
vidual advice, and general docu-
ments and material through the
Technical Information Service.
A Unesco Travelling Consultant
will maintain personal contact with
as many as possible of the Asso-
ciated Projects, and visits of Liai-
son Officers or other persons from
the Projects to Unesco's Headquar-
ters or to Regional Study Conferen-
ces will be encouraged. The assis-
tance of. Unesco's Bureau for the
Exchange of Persons will ago be
enlisted, to promote international
exchanges of personnel between
Associated Projects in different
parts of the world. This new con-
ception of Associated Projects was
warmly welcomed by the Second
General Conference.
Pilot Projects'
Four"Pilot Projects"in Funda-
mental Education will be developed
in 1948, as concentrated and con-
trolled field experiments to be car-
ried out at the invitation of Natio-
nal Governments with the guidance
of a resident expert consultant from,
Unesco. Basic sociological and eco-
logical surveys will be made as a
foundation for a community educa-
tion plan and a measure of its sub-
sequent success, and the latest tech-
niques of Fundamental Education,
including the uses of mass media
and visual and oral aids, will be
tried out in the field.
Unesco will place at the disposal
of the Projects the personal advice
of experts as well as educational
textbooks, films and film-strips.
The results of these experimental
projects will be made available in
detail through Unesco's Technical
Information Service.
Preparations have already been
made for three of these Pilot Pro-
jects in 1948, in China, British East
Africa and Haiti.
An American, with long expe-
lienee in China, has been appointed
as Consultant to develop the Pilot
Project in the vicinity of Na. nking,
in conjunction with the Chinese
Mass Education Movement.
In Nyasaland, after great rivalry
between several tribal districts ; the
area for Unesco's Pilot Project has
been selected, a, special grant voted
and the local staff appointed. A
basic survey is now being carried
out and a Danish Agricultural eco-
nomist. with experience in the Folk
High Schools, will go to Nyasaland
as Unesco's expert consultant in
February. The education and wel-
fare side of the Tanganyika
Groundnuts Scheme already men-
tioned will be treated as a comp3f-
rative experiment with the tribal
development scheme in Nyasaland.
The Pilot Project for Haiti,
although the first planned, has been
delayed owing to the inability of
the Haiti Government to bear the
full financial burden and efforts
are being made to launch the Pro-
ject as a joint enterprise between
the Ham-Government, the Specia-
lised Agencies of U. N. (Unesco,
W. H. O., and F. A. O.) and other out-
side organisations, under a Unesco
director.
The plan includes a rural training
centre for young Haitians, com-
prising a small clinic, a demons-
tration farm, a community centre,
library and museum and a teachers'
training school. This will form an
active nucleus from which Funda-
mental Education will spread out-
wards to bring literacy and a
higher standard of living to the
remote Valley of Marbial and,, by
degrees, to the rest of the Republic
of Haiti.
The site for a New Pilot Project
approved by the General Confe-
rence for 1948 has yet to be decided,
but an invitation has been received
from the Government of Peru to
centre it upon the Cuzco area.
One Unesco Regional Study Con-
ference is planned for the autumn
of 1948 and will probably be held
in one of the Middle East capitals.
Here, representatives with special
experience in Fundamental Educa-
tion in the various countries of this
region will come together for a
month to analyse and discuss with
members of Unesco's staff artd
Panel tube particular problems of
this area, plans and projects for
their solution and new methods,
techniques and materials developed
for local use.
Conclusion
A welt ! integrated programme for
Fundamental Education has thus
been drawn up by the Second Ge-
neral Conference. A portmanteau
resolution adopted by the delegates,,
requires the Panel of Experts to
examine ; and make recommenda-
tions on, a number of subsidiary
questions relevant to Fundamental
Education.
Among these are : the definition
of literacy as-a basis for valid in-
ternational statistics, the special
application of Fundamental Educa-
tion to under-privileged groups in
industrial communities, tensions
and barriers between colours ; taco
and creeds, the status of women 
and inequality of the sex-es in-Fun-,
damental Education areas, language :
problems in Fundamental Educa-
tion as well as the place of arts
and crafts ant, the use of. popular,
libraries and museums in the deve-
lopment of the movement. In the
lass five of these, the co-operation
of the Uneseo Sections dealing. with
Social Sciences, Languages, Arts,
Libraries and Museums will be
sought.
A special resolution of the Ge-
neral Conference is devoted to
research into the use of the media
of mass communications in Funda-
mental Education.
It is clear that these new media
can play a great part as visual and
ora}. aids to teaching, as a vehicle
of propaganda on Fundamental
Education and as an educational
medium to. bridge the gap between
the early stages of Fund, metal
Education and the successful com-
pletion of adult literary teaching.

### 73668: Brazil's campaign for literacy

Brazil Campaign
for Literacy
A campaign in Brazil aimed at
leaching illiterates of all ages
to read and write has resulted in
the establishment since the be-
ginning of 1947 of nearly 14, 000
schools. This was announced by
the'Brazilian Dire'Ctor-Generar. of'
Education, Dr. Lourenço Filho,
delegate to Unesco's Second Gen-
eral Conference, at a press con-
ference in Mexico City on Nov-
ember 25, who declared that it was
largely due to Mexico's example
tttat Brazil embarked on its cam-
paign of Fundamental Education.
More than 30 million cruzeiros
(about $1, 250, 000 U. S.) for this
special instruction have been set
aside from a national, fund of over
120 million cruzeiros (about $5, 000,-
000 U. S.) created by the Brazilian
Government for primary education.'
"We are receiving enormous vo-
luntary support from all sections
of the nation,"Dr, Loureneo said,
pointing out that the success of
the drive was only partly due to
government initiative. Figures given
by him showed that, of the schools
established 3, 000 were founded by
industrial and commercial firms
and other organisations, while
10, 540 were set up by the Federal
Government in collaboration with
State authorities. The campaign
will also be extended through com-
munal centres and cultural mis-
sions, and it is expected that the,
number of students will exceed one
million in 1948.

### 73669: Education: three seminars slated for the coming year

Three Seminars Slated
for the Coming Year
Aware of the importance of con-
tributions educators and teachers
can make to international under-
stranding as the condition of peace,
delegates from forty nations, as-
sembled in Mexico City at the
General Conference of Unes-
co, assigned top priority for 1948 to
a. carefully integrated educational
programme.
Seven. major proposals, all of
which will have equal priority,
have been approved for 1948. At
the outset, the Conference recom-
mended that Unesco's activities in
Fundamental Education should be
combined with its other educa-
tional work so as'to strengthen and
co-ordinate all educational activities
with the other, aspects of Unesco's
programme. (A special article on
this vial aspect Of Unesco's educCl>&gt;
tional programme will be found
OH the oppose pane.),
Three international study Se-
minars will be sponsored by Unesco.
Of these three Seminars in 1948.
one will be sponsored jointly by
Unesco and the'United Nations, on
the general topic of teaching about
the United Nations and its Agen-
cies, particularly in the elementary
and secondary schools of Member
States. Teacher and child educa-
tion will* be discussed at other in-
ternational Seminars, in different
areas of the world. The special
educational problems of Latin
American Member States may be
considered at a fourth Seminar ap-
proved by the General Conference.
In planning these Sessions, Unes-
co has the benefit of experience
gained at the eminently successful
Seminar held in 1947 at Sevres,
particularly concerned that chil-
dren in all parts of the wor. d shall
the work, already begun, of collating
and disseminating information
likely to help achieve this end.
/
Problems arising in the educe-
tion of war-handicapped children
will be studied in collaboration
with national and international or-
ganisations concerned. From re9\nt,
and information received from ex-
perts in different, countries, plans
will be drawn up to overcome these
problems in the light of past ex-
perience
Several Educational M. iss : o ! 1S, in-
cluding repiesentatives frog teach-
ers'organisations and school ex-
perts, may be sent to Member States
upon request for purpose of con-
sultation and advice on the re-or-
ganisation of educational systems,
particularly in war-devastated areas.
Charter for, Youth
Unesco will continue to co-operate I
with other United Nations organisa-
tions in a number of projects group-
ed under the general heading of
education : Greater educational op-
portunities for women ; the-role of
the arts and of science in general
education ; extended technical edu-
cation and vocat ; onal guidance ;
and the special problems of lan-
guage teaching, particularly the
teaching of auxiliary languages in
connection with Unesco's"pilot
projects"in Fundamental Educa-
tion. All these projects will be
studied as part of the extensive
work programme for 1948.
Implicit in the whole pro-
gramme is the principle of equa-
lity for students and teachers alike.
The possibility-of an International
Charter for Youth will'be studied.
This Charter will call for equality
By Dr. Kuo'Yu-Shou
be able vividly to understand the
nature and the objectives of the
United Nations, Unesco delegates to
the Conference voted to co-operate
with the United Nations during the
coming year in providing materials
, teachers could use. And in order
to stimulate the interest of youth
in the work of Unesco, two com-
petitions are to be organised in
Member States, with the help of
National Commissions.
A conference of leaders in Adult
Education is to be held by Unesco
in the first six mouths of 1948. In
sponsoring this conference, Unesco
will capitalise on results obtained
through contacts during the last'
year with leaders of the former
World Association for Adult Educe-'
tion and of the projected Interna-
tional Federation of Workers'Edu-
'. cation Associations, and with adult 1
education experts in many parts or,
the world. The 1948 conference-
is being designed to canvass th ]
opportunities of increasing inter- (
national understanding through j
adult educational agencies, for the
promotion of peace and seeuri-y. i
, !
. Association of Universities 1
I
The responsibilities of Univer- (
sities in international matters is a !
question that has aroused so)
much interest recently that dele-
gates to the General Conference
instructed the Unesco Secretariat
to-bring university leaders to-
gether, to look into the p03Sibility
of closer co-operation between
Unesco and the universities and of
developing more extensive interna-
tional courses in the universities
themselves. The possible formation
of a World Association of Univer-
sities is envisaged for the coming
year, to study and report on equi-
valence of degrees and to promote
education in international relation
among universities
Delegates to the C. Jference aisc
indicated their desire to see an
improvement in textbooks and other
teaching materials and instructed
the Unesco Secretariat to continue
of educational opportunity, and in-
cludes the principle that no youth
should be deprived, by reason of
financial handicap, of instruction
suited to his capacities.
teachers at the Conference spoke
optimistically of drawing up an In-
ternational Teachers'Charter, with-
out discrimination of race, colour,
sex or religion, and applying it to
all levels of the teaching proses,
sion.
'In committee and plenary meet-
ings alike, there was hardly a delve-
gate who did not, at one time or ]
another, stress the part teachers
all over the world play in achiev-
ing the purposes for which Unesco
stands.
Teacher-delegates spoke of the
enormous reservoirs of goodwill j
that were waiting to be tapped, and
of the results that could be achiev-1
ed by correlating efforts now being'
made by teachers to help the cause (
of peace and uhderstanding. In vot- :
ing to continue an enquiry into the f
status of the teaching profession 1
n Member States, the Conference 1
agreed unanimously to encourage
teachers'organisations to colla-t
borate in drawing up a Charter t
designed to. raise the professional
and financial status of teachers
throughout the world.

### 73671: UNESCO to promote reconstruction fund

Unesco to Promote'
Reconstruction Fund
.'
By v Dr. Bernard DrzewiesJd'
An extended programme, design-
ed to assist and stimulate educa-
tional, scientific and cultural re-
construction was agreed upon by
delegates to Unesco's Second Gen-
eral Conference for implementation
throughout Member States during.
1948. Committees who considered
the draft programme recommended
that Member States form National
Committees of non-governmental
organisations for the purpose of
coordinating the tusk of rebuilding
the means, of learning and culture
in war-devastated countries.
Unesco will continue to make
available information on the needs
of these countries and will provide
material suitable for use in national
campaigns, special emphasis being
placed on radio broadcasts, docu-
mentary films and illustrated pam-
phlets.
Delegates urged that Member
States be approaches to arrange
for the duty-free entry of contribut-
ed educational material and it was
also recommended that more ade-
quate information be given by reci-
pient countries regarding the dis-
posal of money and materials con-
tributed.
T. I. C. E. R. Grows
The secretariat for T. I. C. E. R.
(Temporary International Council
for Educational Reconstruction)
will continue to be furnished by
unesco. Created in May 1947,
r. I C. E. R. now has a represeQ ; tati9n
) f twenty international voluntary
tgencies working for relief in the,
; tricken countries. In 1948. as In
; he year of. its formation, T. I. C. E. R :
will work with Unesco in order to
pud in the coordination of volun-
: ary efforts, while fully recognising
: he autonomy of co-operating
groups. Member States are being
asked to maintain close liaison
: vi th/this body so as to ensure the
maximum achievement in-this
world-wide campaign for recons-
truction.
The General Conference. at
Mexico decided that Unesco would
immediately take on certain short-
term emergency committments, de-
signed to afford early relief to the
nations whose educational, scien-
tific and cultural institutions have
suffered badly from the effects
of total war. Among the projectS
envisaged in this connection is the
immediate purchase, as far as funds
will allow, of books, educational
material and scientific equipment.
Unesco's eighteen-man Executive
Board will take on the added res-
ponsibility of advising in the alloca-
tion of such supplies and material
among devastated countries. Other
assistance will take the form or
suggestions to teachers, library and
museum authorities, sponsors of
youth camps and others in an ef-
fort to solve some of the educa-
tional and cultural problems aris-
ing from the war.
"The Book of Needs"
A report based on surveys made
by Unesco field workers, and state-
ments from governmental and m-
ter-governmental sources was pre-
sented to the Conference. This
report, which is now on sale under
the title of"The Book of Needs,'
covers fifteen European and Asiatic
countries and indicates the type"If
assistance and the areas meriting
the highest priority. After exams-
ing this Report, the Delegates
again urged the need for immediate
action on behalf of educational re-
construction. The cost of this pub-
lication was borne by Unesco as
part of the publicity to attract con-
tributions-of money and aterisl
as well as to enable the provision
of professionnal training for the
countries whose educational and
cultural machinery has been ne-
glected during the past eight years.
Unesco will explore the possibi-
lity of launching an appeal for
funds to assist these countries in
building up their media of mass
communications. In addition, the
counsel of international financial
experts will be sought to advise on
the feasibility of creating an"in-
tel'Itationalloan"whreby countries
may obtain foreign currency needed
for cultural reconstruction.
The basis of the scheme is that
countries requiring assistance from
the hard currency areas in the task
of rebuilding their shattered educa-.
tional and cultural institutions win
provide facilities in their own
"soft"currency for professional
and cultural visitor from the
hard currency areas. This exchange
will further international under-
stranding between the countries co-
operating in the scheme.
He, study of the multiple proo
lems arising in the task of educate
ting the post-war child, will be die.
veloped during 1948 and a suitable
plan of action to combat these dif-
ficulties will be drawn up in coy
laboration with the various na
tional and international orgitnisa,
tions concerned. Experts in variou.
countries will be contacted for in
formation and suggestions ;
survey made of the most significant
experiments already carries out
These background reports and sta-
tistics will be analysed and user'
as the basis for further action.
As in 1947, Unesco will aid your
camps and conferences which see ! !
to develop international under"
standing by serving the common
interests of their members ano
providing a more fruitful commllf !.,
ity life.
The publication of the Libran,-
Bulletin, which has world-wide cir-
culation to libraries, museums, uni-
versities and other cultural ins
tutions, and which is equally avail-
able to private organisations ann,
the general public, will also con-
tinue as part of the publicity gives,

tion and Rehabilitation programme
Hooks for Devastated Areas
,.....
National Book Exchange and Do
tribution Centres will be establishec
and maintained by Unesco. as par'.
of the drive to overcome inadequate
distribution of cultural, educational
and scientific literature between
countries. Unesco will also assis'
these centres in negotiating for th
reduction or elimination of import
duties and the reduction of trains,
port costs for book and other edu-
cational material. Member States
are asked to take the lead in the
reduction of such tariffs and hau
lage charges and to co-operate'n
the setting ujp of their own Centres
with all possible speed.
The General Conference recom
mended that while careful selec-
tion should be made of all boOK
and periodicals passing through
such centres, censorship in any
form would be undesirable.
Reconstruction and rehabilitatiolJ
of the educational, scientific ana
cultural institutions of the war-
devastated countries is a gigantic
tasi :. Unesco's carefully gauged and
well integrated programme was
acclaimed by delegates bf forty na-
tions who attended the Conference
as a pratical measure towards forg-
ing the bonds of peace and under-
standing between the nations of the
world.

### 73672: Book coupon scheme to be studied in 1948

Book Coupon Scheme
to Be Studied in 1948
By Edward J. Carter.
AS Unesco's work develops, itbecomes'increasingly evident
that no programme can work in
isolation from the others. This is
particularly true of the work and
plans of the Libraries program-
ttne. Libraries are essentially ser-
yices to education, science and
culture and are among the impor-
tant channels of communication
through. which the mind of man is
stimulated and refreshed. In terms
Of Unesco's own Charter, libraries
can be an immense force for the
l'development of international un-
derstanding and world peace."
Pubiic Library Development
The conference gave special em-
phasis to the responsibilities of
Unesco in the development of pu-
blic libraries, to enable all peoples
to have an"equal chance to develop
their educational. scientific and
cultural life. One of Unesco's tasks
is to bring workers from diverse
countries together for discussion
and study of each others'ideas,
techniques and problems.
The Unesco Bureau for the
Exchange of Persons-will help the
Library programme by awarding
a number of fellowships to public
librarians from"reconstruction
Brea"counbries to enable them to
study in other countries where the
finest examples of public library
work can be seen.
Reconstruction
Almost every part of Unesco's
1W0rk. nd certainly every part of
the Libraries programme has
reference to post-war reconstruc-
tion. The problem of reconstruction
is, everlastingly present, and no
good library is ever free from the
need to construct and reconstruct
its programmes and collections.
For Unesco, libraries reconstruction
is mainly a problem of creating or
re-creating new and better com-
munications between libraries inter-
nationally and between libraries
and all existing sources of publica-
tions. The reconstruction wnrk
which was started in 1947 will be
continued and developped during
the present year.
As its main libraries reconstruc-
tion agency Unesco has established
an"International Clearing House
for Publications,"an intelligence
centre. where an extensive filing
system records thy publications
which particular libraries want and
the duplicates they have for
disposal by gift, sale or exchange.
Already, more than 6, 000 libraries
are co-operating and many hun-
dreds of exchanges have been
effected through the clearing house
and advice has also been given on
the disposal of book gifts. The
clearing house works in close
liaison with the American Book
Center in Washington, and under-
took the disposal of the books from
the Inter-Allied Book Centre in
London. A Unesco Bulletin for
libraries is published monthly as
a means of channeling Clearing
House information round the world
and enabling libraries to establish
their own contacts. The Bulletin,
enthusiastically received during
1947. will continue to be published
during 1948.
Inter-library exchange is an old
established means of maintaining
stocks, and there is a growing need
for national exchange and distribu-
tion centres for publications. The
General Conference has recom-
mended that all Member States
establish such centres and has
instructed the Secretariat to press
for the abolition or reduction of
Import duties, and the reduction of
transport costs and excessive book
prices, all of which militate against
the free flow of publications.
Owing to the disturbed economic
state of the world at the present
time, it is practically impossible for
countries with"soft cUl"rencies"to
purchase books from'"hard cur-
1'ency"countries.
Although Unesco cannot reform
the economic system of the world,
a realistic proposal has been made
for a syste : n of purchase by"book
coupons"which will enable some
of the outstanding difficulties to be
circumvented. Briefly, the es-
sence of the scheme is that Unesco
or some other agency shall issue
internationally valid coupons to
enable"soft currency"countries to
buy books in their own currency
from the"hard currency"a'1'eas, As
the next step towards the achieve-
ment of the scheme it is proposed
to convene a small committee of
experts who understand the com-
plexities of book distribution and
international finance, to answer
outstanding problems, and it is
hoped that the scheme will be
operating before the end of the
year.
Bibliography and
Documentation
Bibliographical and documenta-
tion work, though perhaps little
understood outside the realm of
the specialists who have to use
these services, is. in fact, at the
base of all library activity. The
public librarian cannot decide what
books to buy, or the scientist select
the most important material that
has been published on his subject,
without an intricate chain of
bibliographical services. This in-
cludes short and simple book lists
for the popular reader, elaborate
specialised bibliographies for work-
crs in higher studies and huge
national bibliographical enterprises,
such as national union catalogues
and complete national, bibliogra-
phies.
At the simpler and more poplar
end of Unesco's bibliographical
. work. every nation is being urged
to issue regular short lists of its
best current publications, paying
'special attention to those. which,
contribute to Unesco's aim to'
promote international understand-
ing and world peace. The General
Conference has also urged all
Member States to publish complete
national bibliographies and to
establish national union catalogues,
which show in one centre the hold-
ings of all the principal libraries
in the country. These tasks involve
the building up of effective con-
tacts with librarians, documental-
fists and archivists throughout the'
. world, largely through the Inter-
national Federation of Documenta-t
tion, the International Federation of
Library Associations and a project-
ed International Council of Pro-
fessional Archivists.
A world-wide survey of biblio-
graphical services as a means of
detecting overlaps and gaps and
deficiencies will be undertaken
jointly with the Library of Con-
gress in Washington during 1948. 1
This project will probably be con-
centrated Oh a detailed study of
. the bibliographical and documenta-
tion needs in one field of Unesco
activity-such as Fundamental Edu-
cation.
Science Abstracting
Another big single project under
the bibliographical head will be
worked out in co-operation. with the
Natural Sciences section of Unesco.
- A large-scale attack on problems
of natural science abstracting.
Without carefully prepared abs-
tracts, or summaries of currant
literature, it is impossible to keep
pace with scientific work though-
out the world. A series of expert
committees and meetings will be
held during the year, leading, it
may be hoped, towards the exten-
sion and improvement, not only
of abstracting services as the cen-
tral subject of discussion, but of all
the related services of mdexing and
publications distribution.
One final section of the libraries
programme is being worked out
in close co-operation with the Mass
Communications staff ; this is to
explore ways of encouraging the
inexpensive production of books and
periodicals. In recent years publish-
ers m many countries have con-
tributed to education, science and
culture with great imagination by
developing the production and
distribution of good inexpensive
books. In an effort to stimulate
this enterprise, Unesco will suggest
new books which should be written
and published in cheap editions,
and will he1p the negotiation of
agreements so that existing good
books can be re-published cheaply,
translated into many languages.
This is a big programme. It is a
start only'of an enterprise which
extends indefinitely ; but the stan·t 
is bold'and will be successful if it
receives the enthusiastic support of
the mass of the people of the world.
who almost all, are directly or
indirectly dependent on the printed

rial welfare.

### UNINDEXED_ARTICLE

I. UnescoProgramme
To Stress Exchange
Between Museums'
During 1948 the principal task of
the Museums programme will be to
promote the exchange of informa-
tion on museums, and of museum
personnel throughout the world.
Emphasis is thus laid on exchanges
because it is by that means that
the immense amount of damage
done to museums, everywhere by
the war can most speedily be made
good.
In many war-devastated coun-
tries, museum systems were entire-
ly destroyed, and it is a primary
duty-of Unesco to help in their
reconstruction. To resume the flow
of ideas, inteN-upted in all coun-
tries by the war, is vital if mu-
seums are to play their part in
developping education, science and
cuiture.-I
The possibility of establishing in-
ternational foundations, supported :
by member governments, as a
means of encouraging co-opera-
tion between museums will be
studied by Unesco ; international
conferences, like the one M be held
by the International Council of
Museums next June, will be aided,
and plans for international exhibi-
tions will be stimulated and en-
couraged.
The work of the Museums pro- !
gramme is not limited to periodical'
conference meetings or exhibitions ;
it must, above all, furnish a per-
manent service which will arrange
for persons connected with mu-
seums to visit museums u foreign
countries, and to meet foreign
museum experts so that they may
exchange ideas and experiences.
This permanent service will be able
to supply, on request, guidance and
information based on the most up-
to-date museum practice wherever
it many be found.
In conclusion, it may be raid
that although a great deal has
already been done to develop the
use of museums in the cause of
education, science and culture, yet I
the greater part of the talk is still
before us, involving much new and
exciting experimental work. but al-
so entailing much routine survey-
ing of present conditions through-
out the world.
Thousands of visitors to the General Conference saw the exhibitions at
the Escue ! a formal de Maestros and through them learned hoTV Unesco
assists in the development of Library, Museum and Educational systems.

Highlight of Unesco
Projects for New Year
(Continued from Page 1)
the work of the Executive Board,
Public Information, Personnel, and
other activities not directly con-
cerned. with executing projects
within the programme.
Reconstruction
Unesco hopes to put into opera-
tion in 1948 a novel international
scheme for Cultural Rehabilita-
tion, based on a new method of
securing funds on an international
scale. If this scheme is deemed
feasible, Unesco will urgé'a system
whereby"soft currency"countries
may oþtain"hard currency"and
pay for it by meeting the living
expenses of visiting teachers, stu-
dents and technicians from these
countries.
Unesco will also encourage the
establishment of a National Ex-
change Centre in war-devastated
and book surplus countries to
facilitate the international exchan-
ge and dissemination of books,
and will seek to eliminate or re-
duce import duties on literature
dealing with science, education and
culture.
Communication
Unesco's Communication Pro-
gramme, which includes Exchange
of Persons, Mass Communication,
Libraries and Copyright has been
assigned a high priority for 1948.
A resolution proposed by the
United States delegates was
adopted by the Conference to. en-
courage the free flow of informa-
tion by seeking to reduce the
barriers existent in the world to-
day. A second resolution, sponsored
by the United Kingdom delegation,
was also approved, calling for the
creation of an Inn. Ideas Bureau.
In the field of broadcasting, the
General Conference agreed that
Unesco will co-operate in the pro-
posed United Nations world radio
network ; if it is established. If
this network is not set up, hovewer,
Unesco will study the creation of
a network of its own.
The Mexican delegation favoured
the creation of a World University
0 : tie Air which would broacast
the best lectures from leading
world universities over all natio-
nal networks.
During Mt8 Uneseo wiH place special
emphasis on a Book Coupon Scheme.
Here, too, Unesco has outlined a plan to
assist the"soft currency"countries. It.
is unfortunately true, that since the last
war, Inost"sort currency"nations have
been almost unable to buy books and
periodicals of other nations.
Unesco's Book Coupon Scheme ins an
effort to eliminate this currency exchange
problem by substituting special coupons
redeemable in local monies.
Education
EDUCATION occupies an im-
portant place in Unesco's 1948
programme. At the Mexico City
Conference delegates agreed that
it is the duty of all member
states to guarantee a basic mini-
mum of education, to all their
citizens that is free and universal
compulsory primary schooling. To
aid Member States in such cam-
paigns, the Conference authori-
sed the use of a world board of
Fundamental Education experts. In
addition Unesco will aid and
advise a limited number of"pilot
projects".
Fundamental Education, however,
in the field of education. A brood
programme has been outlined for
1948 of education to improve inter-
national understanding.
Three Seminars on education,
similar to those at Sevres, France,
last year, will be held in different
parts of the world during 1948. In
co-operation with the United Na-
tions and its other SpeciaHsed
Agencies, Unesco will undertake
an educational campaign of teach-
ing about the UN, its aims and
activities.
Cultural Interchange
In the field of Arts and Letters,
Unesco will continue to, support by
technical advice the creation of
an International Theatre Institute,
independent of Unesco. Unesco
will also undertake preliminary en-
quiries for the establishment of
an International Music Institute.
The Director-General has been
instructed to draw up a list of high-
quality colour reproduction design-
ed to illustrate the most important
phases and movements in art. This
catalogue will bepublished and dis-
tributed throughout member states
to promote the interchange of cul-
tures. In 1946, the United Nations
requested Unesco to prepare a plan
for the translation of the classics.
Unesco expects to complete and
present such a plan to the Eco-
nomic and Social Council by June
1, 1948.
A number of eminent philoso-
phers attended the Mexico Con-
ference. As a result of their delibe-
rations the Conference agreed upon
a series of round-table discussions
dealing with certain philosophical,
concepts to be held in conjunction
with the Amsterdam International
Congress of Philosophy. In order to
link the efforts of philosophers and
humanists with the work of Unesco,
the organisation will encourage the
establishment of an International
Council of Associations in the field
of Philosophy and the Humanities.
Unesco's Museum specialists will
prepare a plan for the international
exchange of contemporary work of
art through organised exchanges of
exhibitions and collections accom-
panied by appropriate catalogues.
Social and Human
Relations
Searching enquiries into the ten-
sions affecting international under-
standing will be carrier out by
Unesco in 1948 in collaboration
with leading social scientists every-
where. The purpose of such enqui-
ries is to prepare first of all. t
comprehensive analysis of the for-
ces which influence understanding
and respect among peoples of dif-
ferent culture patterns. Secondly,
the project envisages a programme
of action to overcome and eliminate
tensions negatively affecting mu-
tual understanding.
Natural Sciences
Unesco specialists in the NATU-
RAL SCIENCES were very active
during 1947. The three Field
Science Co-operation Offices al-
ready in existence in the Middle
East, the Far East and Latin
America will be maintained and an
additional office in South Asia will
be established in 1948 as under-
takings of the highest priority
within the Natural Sciences pro-gramme.
This year will also see the
establishment of the International
Institute of the Hylean Amazon.
The Brazilian Government and the
countries bordering on the vast
paigns, the Conference authoris-
Amazon Basin are taking special
interest in the Institute, which will
study ecological, ethnological and
agricultural questions as weal as
educational and linguistic problems,
affecting the Amazon region.
It became evident during the
Mexico Conference that, amidst
the troubled problems before the
world today, Unesco offers one of
the few meeting places where both
men and nations may find agree-
ment on vital international ques-
tions.
This feeling was manifest at
Mexico City where an almost una-
nimous effort was made by na-
tional delegations to avoid con-
I troversial political issues. Delegates
agreed that Unesco-in the space
only of its first year of life-had
gained ground towards becoming
a truly universal organ.

TRANSLATION OF CLASSICS
TO BE PROMOTE BY UNESCO
By Prof. Jean' : Jacques Mayoux
IF it is true that"it is in the minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed,"in what way can philosophy and the
vast studies dealing with the cultural past of mankind contribute to
such a peace ?
Let us, in this respect, examine the Philosophy and Humanist : yes
programme of Unesco, by dividing it into two categories : the empir-
ical and the theoretical.

(Continued from page 1.)
Early in the Conference, Dr.
Julian Huxley, Director-Genera !,
pointed out the difficulties under
, which Unesco wou : d have to work
and the obstacles against which It
would have to struggle. He de-
clared :
"Unesco cannot operate with full
effectiveness in the presence of
fascism, imperialism, intolerance,
witch-hunting, oppressive exploita-
tion, corruption, authoritarian sup-
pression of freedom or exaggerated
nationalism..."
From november 10 to November
28, in sub-commissions and work-
ing parties-as many as six con-
vening simultaneously in morning,
afternoon and even night sessions
- the 1948 programme took form.
At the same time, problems of ad-
ministration, of budget, external
relations and procedure, were stud-
ied and resolved.
Nineteen plenary sessions were
held up to December 3, the last five
of which were almost continuous.
Delegates from all member'states
heard and approved the programme
for 1948 in its final form,
Letters and telegrams of support
were received from people all over
the world in all walks of life.
Lectures, musical and artistic
presentations and receptions high-
lighted the colourful Unesco Month
Programme, held concurrently with
the Conference. A series of seven
'lectures was delivered on Mexican
education, science, plastic art,
music, biology and literature at the
"Palacio dt-Bellas ArIes".
During the Conference, two
 Unesco exhibits (each divided inoo
two sections) were on display in
the school-one exhibit on public
libraries and museums, the other
on Fundamental Education and
on educational reconstruction-and
were viewed by thousands of vi-
sitors.
Other important meetings were
held in conjunction with the Con-
ference which itself served-in the
view of both delegates and observ-
ers-as a successful experiment in
international co-operation. A land-
mark for the organisation's work,
concluding Unesco's first yeas. of
life,

### 73681: World copyright law planned

WORLD COPYRIGHT
LAW PLANNED
, J
When Unesco's Director-general
Dr Julian Huxley said :"Copyright
matters are a primary responsibility
of Unesco because of its iriterest
in the free flow of information
throughout the world and the pro-
tection of the literary, scientific
and artistic'works upon which
cultural interchange depnds,"he
was stating with greater, precision
! What Unesco had already affirmed
during the initial stages of the
Preparatory. Commission in London.
The various groups of laws pro-
tecting copyright had hitherto
been considered merely from the
relatively unfavourable aspect of
the obstacles which their entirely
anarchical condition was constantly
raising against world cultural inter-
change..
In the future, this will no loner
be the case. The programme un-
dertaken in pursuance of a
decision by the Mexico City Con-
ference', will make a study of
copyright problem, with the object
of harmonising the various national
laws on the, subject and will prepare
the draft of a Universal Copyright
Convention.
The first task of this programme
for 1948 is to make a critical survey
of comparative law, having regard
to all the laws at present existing
and the methods by which these
flaws are given practical effect. Due
regard will be paid to all the
interests involved, e. g., free flow of
information, the rights of authors
and publishers or workers in gen-
eral as well as the public.
This considerable survey is being
undertaken under the direction of
the French expert, M. François
Hepp, Doctor of Law and organiser,
of the Provisional Committee of
Copyright Experts, which met at
Unesco House in Paris during
Beptember, 194'1.'

### 73674: Translations of classics to be promoted by UNESCO

On the practical side, it is a
fact that intellectual life and the
minds of men are both condition-ed by habit and surroundinga. Be-
cause of the every nature of their
academic work and the universal"
character of their interests, philo-
sophers,'humanists and sociaf
science specialists depend on inter-
national exchanges. These, until
now, have been almost entirely
lacking. The fact is that philo-sophers and humanists are not
organised on an international
scale, or at : east not effectively.
In an endeavour to remedy. tiiis,
Unesco has proposed the re-group-
ing of the existing organisations
I in order to establish an Interna-
tonal Council of Philosophy and
Humanistic Studies similar to the
International Council of Scientific
Unions. This International Council
it is hoped, will stimulate the
movement of ideas and the dissemi-
nation of knowledge between na-
tions.
i Among the many duties whicn
Mie Association will undertake on
an international scale are the pre-
paration of bibliographies : various
systems of card indexing ; analy-
tical summaries and abstract sur-
veys ; clearing house services for the
exchange of articles between philo-
sophical reviews and. eventually.
bulletins and year books containing
scientific information..
Translation-01 Great Books
In this same field of Cultural In-
terchange, the Economic and So-
cial Council of the United Nations
has charged Unesco with a difficult
and important undertaking, that of
preparing, submitting and ultimate-
ly putting into execution a plan
for the general translation of the
classics,'including great contem-
porary books not only of literature.
but of philosophy and of social and
natural science as well.
This project will have the follow-
ing two objectives :
a) Unknown or insufficiently
known classics are to be translated
into. a number of major languages
in order to enrich the culural
I heritage of the world and to give
particular encouragement to all na-
tions whose cultural'importance
may have seemed insignificant.
b) A limited number of Great
Books, selected for their universal
'value and their representative and
iiuman qualities, are to be translat-
ed into a. < ; many languages as pos-
sible.
Regional Centres
and Culture Understanding
Realising that it is essential
for Unesco's purposes to under-
stand and appreciate all cul-
tural differences, the Organisa-
tion, during 1948, is to consider the
possibility of setting up regional
centres of cultural co-operation. A
start in this direction will be made
this year when a survey wilt be
carried out in the Middle East.
On the theoretical side, Unesco,
and in particular. the Philosophv
and Humanities programme will en-
courage a critical study of human
values on an international scale. It
must avoid the danger of civilisa-
tion destroying itself through ap-
parent conflicts of ideology, which
in reality, may be no more than a
confusion of words.
In 1948, Unesco will undertake
two groups of surveys :
1) an enquiry into the influence
on current ideological controversies
concerning the fundamental con-
of the fundamental concepts of
democracy, justice and liberty.
2) an enquiry into the ideas held
by a country, or b :' a group within
a country, of its own culture and
the relations of that culture with
others, individually or as a whole.
Here the object is to ascertain the
gaps in existing relations and to
work out measures to integrate
e : :,. : culture in the whole of world
civilisation.
These undertakings, and in fact
the work of Unesco as a whole, will
succeed any in proportion to the
active participation stimulated, par-
ticularly amongst youth.

### 73675: Social scientists study international tensions

Social Scientists Study
International Tensions"
THE major project in tha SocialSciences programme for 1948 is
that on Tensions affecting Interna-
tional Understanding. The Unesco
Conference indicated three main
lines along which efforts should be
directed.
The first step towards interna-
tional understanding, it decided, is
to make it possible for nations two
understand one another better. It
accordingly provided for"Enquiries
into the distinctive character of
the, various national cultures, ideals,
and legal systems, with the aim of
stimulating the sympathy and res-
By
Dr. Arvid Brodersen
."
: pest of nations for each other's
ideals and aspirations and the ap-
preciation of national problems."
As a counterpart, to this it aIs6
instructed the Director-General to
promote"Enquiries into the
conceptions which the people of one
nation entertain of their own and
of other nations."
These two groups of'enquiries
aim at discovering, as it were, the
present state of international un-
derstanding in the world, Thy
problem is how this understanding
can be made better. To this end
the 1948 programme provides for
"Enquiries into modern techniques
which have been developed in edu-
cation, political science, philosophy
and psychology for changing men-
tal attitudes and fay revealing the
processes and forces involved when
human minds are in conflict."
This general-', udy is to be sup-
plemented by a specific piece of
work bearing directly upon this
central question :"An enquiry into
the influences throughout life which
predispose towards international
understanding on the one hand and
aggressive nationalism on the
other."
Finally, it is recognised that two
particular factors are of, special
importance in regard to tensions
affecting international understand-
ing ; technological change and po-
pulation movements. A. Source
Book is to be prepared showing
what studies are under way on
these subjects in the Member
States.
Two further points laid down by
the Conference for the conduct of
the"Tensions"'project are of
special interest. To the utmost
extent possible the services of uni-
versities, research centres, National
Commissions, internï. tional organ !.
sations, are to be enlisted in carry-
ing, out this project. At the same
time, the Director-General of
Unesco is instructed to"study
methods whereby the findings of
the investigations may be popular-
ised."
International Collaboration
As a Problem in Social
, science
Social scientists everywhere are
largely preoccupied with national
problems these days. Reconstruction
nd social development after the
war naturally have a first claim on
their time and energy. But. the post-
war situation poses new interna-
tional problems too. The peoples of
the world will have to think and
live and work together in a com-
munity of international co-opera-
tion if they are to be spared a. new
and final catastrophe. Therefore
pnesco will try to call to'1he atten-
tion of social scientists everywhere
the Importance of dealing with the
problem of international collabora-
tion which can be investigated in
various fields of study.
In the present world, the peoples
have laid a basis for working and
living together, in the great inter-
national organisations and institu-
tions of the United Nations. But
they are far from complete and
perfect yet ; they are living organ-
isms which need proper care,
nourishment and guidance to gain
the strength and skills-required of
them in the world of to-day. It is
vitally important for scientific'
specialists in all social fields to
study and observe the day-to-day
problems of this great community
of the peoples. Here and there,
valuable work is already being done.
Unesco will seek to encourage such
work and in some cases to initiate
special studies itself.
International Standards
, in Political Science'
National divergences is, research
techniques and concepts, in ap-
proach and emphasis, are an im-
portant problem at this stage, when
the social sciences everywhere mus :
be developed and brought together
into an international force fit to
deal with the great issues of our
times. The problem can be describ-
ed as one of creating a unity ill
diversity, an internationally in-
tegrated social science with stan-
dardised working tools, terms, con-
cepts and methods : at the same
time leaving full freedom for the
expression of the national genius
in social research.
In 1948, Unesco will initiate a
comparative study of political
science as presented in representa-
tive samples of recent research1
materials from various countries
(scientific publications and high-
level textbooks>. A main reason
for choosing political science as
the first subject of study is the
fundamental importance of that
discipline for the understanding 3f
international problems. The project-
is therefore ancillary to the en-
quiries on international collabora-
tion'and on tensions. The term"po-
litical science"as'used here may
be described broadly as the sys-
tematic study of politics and poli-
tical behaviour, particularly'the
exercise of and struggle for'poli-
tical power in central or local gov-
ernement. Some typical fields of
study are, for instance : parties
party systems and other political
group : ; representative bodies (par-
liaments, etc.) : political public
opinion ; leadership and political
personnel ; political doctrines and
ideologies ; government and publIC
administration. The findings of
this enquiry are to be presented in
a publication as a Report To The
General Conference.


### 73676: Moral guide of world says Mexican President in tribute to UNESCO


"Moral'Guide
,, of World",
Says Mexican President
In Tribute to Unesco
At the inaugural meeting on. the
6th November, 1947 of the Second
Session of Unesco's General Con-
ference in Mexico City, His Excel-
lency Miguel Aleman, President of
the United Mexican States welcom-
ed delegates. and observers to his
country.
Describing Unesco as"the moral
guide of the peopies of the world",
President Aleman stressed the im-
portance of the work already ac-
complisheq by Unesco and stated,
the Organisation's principal task as
"the creation of a, mind for peace
that shall be like a second nature
in all men".
President Airman stated'that
through science, education and cul-
ture Unesco's purpose could be
achieved and the peoples of the
earth live together in mutual un-
derstanding and harmony.
"Right education", he said,''is
basic for the continuous develop-
. meant of culture and for the healthy
[progress of science. We have always
felt the need of giving education
i the highsst moral function. This
! weed was expressed by Simon Bo-'
llívar-the most authorised spo-
kesman of our peoples-when he
outlined before the Congress of
angostura. the constitutional as-
sembly of the nations he had lib-
erated, his ideas as to how free
peoples should organise themselves".
"Simon Bolivar said'Popular edu-
cation should be the primary in-
terest and concern of the Congress ;
morality and enlightenment are the
foundation poles of a Republic ;
morality and enlightenment are our
prime need'",'
"Unesco corresponds in the in-
ternational field and for the entire
world, to what Bolivar desired for
the peoples he made independent.",
stated President Alemán."There-
fore, in these lands of Boltvar's
America, the purposes of Unesco
find the most favorable environ-
ment, are most. warmlv welcome,
have the greatest assurance of
being understood and waken
glowing enthusiasm".

### 73677: Dr. Gual Vidal stresses education role in building peace

Dr. 6M) Vidal
Stresses Education Role
In Building Peace
In his inaugural address as Pres-
ident of the Second Session jot th
General Conference, H. E. Mcen-
ciado Manuel Gual Vidal, Mexican
Minister of Public Education, set
the general tone of the Conference
when he emphasised the role
Unesco can play in building a
lasting and secure peace, through
the active support of the peoples
and nations of. the world.
The Minister of Education de-
claret :"We fully recognize the
world-wide significance of the ex-
ceptional honour conferred on our
country, on Hispano-America and
on the New World in general by
this Conference, staged in the tem-
ple erected by Mexico'to carry on
. that most honourable of human
vocations : that of the Teacher,
whose noble work is the best means
of training men morally fitted to
live together in peace, harmony and
brotherhood".
"The Mexican nation has been
stirred to the heart by Unesco's,
work", he said."It has mobilised
its teachers, its men of science and
of letters ; it has brought its best
resources into play. Mexico has
learnt from the historical signi-
ficance of the aims and functions
of the Organisation that, we, the
Members States, have the moral
duty of formulating, through the
proper constitutional channels, in-
ternational educational agreements,
and of setting up schools at aU
ievels to carny, Unesco's educational
principles to the heart of the
teaching systems of the world. 
"When these efforts have boy.
practical results", concluded Df
VMa !,"they will serve as a modes,
a basis for an international educa-
tional plan which will be a constant
sowce of peace amon ; peoplea".

### 73678: Arts and letters programme for 1948

8 UNESCO COURIER
Arts and Letters
Programme
for 1948
,,.
fACH branch of Arts and Letters has before it pro-
jests which constitute valuable contributions tothe Arts. The programme is a direct attempt to
stimulate the arts and to further the major Unesco
aim of promoting understanding between peoples. It
entails much work ; it demands co-operation, energy
and judgement.
, It has long been apparent that the exchange of
. articles between library periodicals has never. reacheda sufficient proportion or v lume to achi ve impor-
tant results in the exchange of cultures. For one
reason or another ; and particularly since 1939,
periodicals have lacked exact information regarding
the literary scene in other countries. Editors have not
known where to seek articles or how to co. ntact
writers. The'need Was felt forborne, system of, assis-
tance'by whlchál1terary re, vlew m sooie'Ìnldwest
town of the United States, four example, or a strug-
gling review in a devastated country could enjoy the'
possibility of publishing articles by foreign con-
tributors In the same way the great reviews of'the
European capitals have desired to print the works of
writers in other countries.
It is the aim of the Interna. Uonat Literary Pool
to effect this exchange, and to help literary periodic-
als in their attempts to keep their readers informed
of-international literary and cultural life. During
"1947 the Secretariat conducted preliminary enquiries
as to how this project might be accomplished, and
how a Pool, a turntable of this nature, might best
serve its purpose.
That such a Pool was necessary, soon became
apparent. Requests for information and for articles
were received from sources in many different parts
of the world. To take a typical example, the Pool
was axle to place the French review"la Nef"in
contact with the"Revista de America :' which is
published i, nl Bogotá.'
But it must be emphasised that Unesco has no
Desire to create a monopoly and no wish to act as
3'substitute for a. literary agency. It sees its wok
above all as one of liaison, as providing a means
for establishing contact at a time when communica-
tions are excessively difficult.
A well advanced project is the Internat ! onat
Theatre Institute. The setting up of this Institute
was agreed to at a meeting of experts held through
the direct agency of Unesco in July, 1947. It is to
, hold its first Congress this year,. when it. is hoped
that the d2aft charter will be ratified.
During the Congress and the early stages of the
Institute. the Secretariat, will be provided by Unesco.
It is designed to promote international exchange in
the world of the theatre, to facilitate the movement
of theatrical troupes, scripts, ideas-and all kinds of
theatrical information.
If much has already been accomplished in litera-
ture and the-theatre, only the spade work has been
undertaken in the Visual Arts. In a sense so much
could be attempted that the major problem facing
Unesco has been to limit the choice of projects to. I
those which could be effectively carried out at the
present time. It was felt by the Conference that
the most fruitful opportunity for action lay in the
field of reproductions.
During the last few years much technical progress
has been made in art reproduction methods and it
seemed ess, éntial to encourage the raising of stan-
dards and the improvement of distribution facilities
as a means of assisting art education and stimulating
cultural exchange. Any work of this nature inevitably
. would be considerable, and the Conference according-
ly felt that attention should be devoted in the first
place to important and specific periods and phases
of art.'
FINE ART REPRODUCTIONS TO BE ENCOURAGE
Though some alterations and
additions may prove necessary, the
categories marked for attention
during 1948 indicate the breadth of
the project. They concern Pre-
historic art'. Persian art, art of the
Italian Renaissance and the devel-
opment of European painting be-
tween 1870 and 1914 The aim of
the Arts and Letters Programme
isl to compile a detailed catalogue
of those paintings which have been
reproduced in colour, together with
recommendations for additional re-
productions. This catalogue will be
discussed with experts in colour
reproduction, art education and the
history of art, who are to meet in
Paris this summer at the same time
as the Conference of the Inter-
national Council of Museums. To
complement these, lists, to bring
them alive as it were, an exhibi-
tion will be held consisting of the
best colour prints available to illus-
tor, ate techniques of colour
printing and their role in art
appreciation and education.
A Conference of experts held in
1947 felt that Customs barriers
form an impediment to the ex-
change of culture. It is thus one
of the tasks of Unesco to begin
enquiries into those Customs duties
and other restrictions imposed by
Member States on the importation
of works of art, and to study the
possibilities of negotiating an agree-
ment to reduce or eliminate them.
Reproduction is on of the prin-
cipal themes of the Programme
this year. Music specialists in the
same way as Visual Arts specialists
will commence the preparation of a
catalogue of world music. As yet,
final details for this catalogue
have not been fully worked out, but
il will be approached along the
same lines as those adopted for the
Visual Arts. At the same time,
preliminary investigations will be
made into the advisability of
establishing a n International
Music Institute ; a report will be
submitted to the Third Session of
the General Conference in 1948.
Though these projects are na-
turally of paramount importance-
they are tasks specifically set by the
Conference-the Arts and Letters
Programme will also'include its
continuous activities. These consist
of research and documentation, con-
cerning all phases of the Arts and
art education, which must be built
up over'a number of years. They
. will not only enable Unesco to meet
enquiries from member states and
the general public, but equip the
Organisation to undertake such
tasks of a long or short term
nature as °the General Conference
may set for it.

"y/te work of the Second Gen-
eral Conference of'Unesco has
com on an end. During titis month
much was discussed and in the
midst of a number of rather Uto-
pian and aOl1tract rplan$ which were
formulated and approved. several
concrete proposals have come to
slight which will constitute a use-
furl working programme'for the
year 1948., Among these which will
interest Italians particularly are
those which will seek to stimulate
the international exchange of per-
songs, books and scientific materilXI.
New study grants will be allocated
anal concrete facilities introduced
for the, exchange of professors and
students on : the basis of a"cleàr-
ing"system which will obviate the
necessity of currency exchange. A
plan has also been formulated for
. the' exchange of books-with the-
cremation of"book coupons"to be
guaranteed by Unesco,'thus assur-
ing an int'l. ctrculation of books.

Dr. A Vanicek in an article
"Neglected Unesco"writes :
"Since politics have undoubtedly
a greater impact OM the orqanisa-
tion of the world than science and.
culture, the last session of the,'
General AssemblY of United Na-
tions and the Conjerence of For-
eign Ministers in London had
much more pub : icity than the
work of Unesco, axd its General
Conference. Thfs should not be the
case sine a peace organisation
such as UN with all its political
and economic activities cannot do
without an educational institution
like Unesco.-,-'
"By co-operation withe prominent
scientists ail over the world a stage
of world development could be
achieved where po : itics would bë
subordinated to knowledge and not
u : ce uersa as we have experienced
it so far to the great harm of all
mankind.'
