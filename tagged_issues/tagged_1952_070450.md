THE U. S. CITIZEN
AND THE
UNITED NATIONS
by
Luther H. Evans
Librarian of'Congress ; Member, Executive Board of Unesco ;
Chairman, U. S. National Commission for Unesco
HUNTER COLLEGE, New York City wasa recent focal point for American
interest in the United Nations as
2, 500 delegates to a national conference
took over its 16-storey modern building
on Park Avenue during the final days of
January. The meeting was called by the
U. S. National Commission for Unesco-
the third such gathering since the Com-
mission was formed nearly six years ago
to advise the U. S. Government on Unesco
affairs. From every one of the 48 States
came people responding to the Commis-
sion's appeal. Delegates included experts
from the fields of science and education,
prominent writers and artists, professionals
from radio, stage and screen, leaders from
religious, labour, youth, government and
other fields. Some participated as repre-
sentatives of organized groups, others as
individuals. But-all came motivated by
aims spelled out in the broad conference
plan, to consider together opportunities,
obligations and resources of responsible
citizens for the solution of international
problems through participation in world
affairs.
Education about the United Nations is
the Commission's priority programme for
action in the U. S., and on this effort the
conference has already had a tremendous-
ly stimulating effect.
For four-and-a-half days, the Conference
delegates filled classrooms and audito-
riums, swarmed through halls, listened to
capable and stimulating speakers, saw,
heard, and took part in radio, television
and film showings. In small work
sessions they came to grips with a long
list of basic questions on"The Citizen
and the United Nations."Participating
with them in many of these meetings
were observers and students from over
15 countries and a score of UN and
Specialized Agency officials. Highlight-
ing the general conviction that an under-
standing of international problems must
begin at the local level of U. S. towns and
cities, and in the schools, one delegate,
who spoke from the floor at the closing
session on January 31, urged his colleagues
to"rouse the apathetic, inform the (nor·
ant and combat the opposition."
Popular ideals
In order to accomplish this, the confer-
ence stressed that mass support of these
objectives can best be obtained by inter-
preting them in terms of popular ideals,
interests and aspirations. The co. opera-
tion of the press, motion pictures, radio
and other mass media was urged in help-
ing to further this task, and represent-
atives of the industries concerned assured
the delegates of their understanding and
desire to support the principles of the
conference.
The need for expanding the present
international exchange of persons pro-
gramme, to bring foreign leaders, workers
and student groups to the United States,
and to send their American counterparts
abroad, was also stressed.
General sessions were devoted to U. S.
participation in the United Nations and
the problems of constructing peace. A
keynote was sounded in the address by
the Director-General of Unesco, M. Tor-
res Bodet, who warned that"Behind
every evmt that aggravates the present
pol {jcal crisis there always lies the old
story of hatred and hunger, of poverty
and ignorance and the eternal problem
of selfishness and want of understanding."
The Assistant Secretary of State for
Public Affairs, Howland H. Sargeant, em-
phasized a similar theme when he told
the conference that"We Americans can.
not'go it alone.'We need the other free
peoples, even as they need us. Freedom
as we know it is being subjected to an
assault which has had no parallel in
modern history. And we who believe in
freedom must meet that assault together."
Delegates were asked to.. specialize"
by selecting one of thirteen afternoon sec-
tion meetings. Simultaneous panels 6derv.
ed to focus first on the world problem
faced by the UN or one of its Specials-
zed Agencicô ; second, the contributions
which the United Nations have already
made, and third, the tasks ahead. Parti-
cular attention was given to the efforts
American citizens must expend if pro-
gress is to be assured.
In a mid-conference review, George N.
Shuster, the humane and intellectually-
gifted president of Hunter College, gave
a brilliant summary of these deliberations.
Following this it was my task to remind
the delegates of the opportunities that
were theirs during the work sessions.
Meeting with one's colleagues in small
work groups was answering a need often
voiced at previous conferences when eager
delegates had said,"We are interested in
what the experts have to say, but what
we really want is more time to talk things
over with others who have the same pro-
blems that we have."In subsequent
meetings difficulties that seemed unique
were found to be just commonplace. The
discouragement born of loneliness vanish'
ed and the courage of a common cause
took its place.
Ideas contributed by mid-conference
resource panels also enabled the delegates
to bring fresh grist to further meetings of
their working sessions. A great deal of
comment was caused by a meeting devot-
ed to the Merging World Outlooks at
which Ralph Turner of Yale University
spoke. Professor Turner is chairman of
the editorial committee of Unesco's Inter-
tional Commission for the Scientific and
Cultural History of Mankind. His observa-
tions on the cultural unity of man gave
rise to many lively discussions.
Delegates asked if it really would be pos-
sible to write a single impartial history pre-
senting a balanced point of view on all con-
troversial subjects. Most agreed that the
exchange of ideas which would result
from the process would inevitably illu-
minate problems exposed to impartial
presentation. The conference members
also welcomed Unesco's plan for present-
ing conflicting theories and airing ques-
tions in an historical periodical pending
the completion of the single comprehensive
study. Several leaders pointed out, how-
ever, that among history and social science
teachers in this country there was a grow-
ing tendency not to rely on any one text,
but to acquaint the student with a num-
ber of"authorities"and encourage him
to form his own judgments.
Mutual misconceptions
The panel given to examining Foreign
Attitudes on World Affairs pointed up the
need for a clearer understanding here of
many peoples whose biased attitudes
about us are in some measure a reflec-
tion of our own misconceptions of them.
A discussion of Area Studies in U. S. col-
leges and universities revealed the extent
of preparation that would be necessary to
equip increasing numbers of young people
for the foreign service roles they would
undoubtedly play in all parts of the world.
"What do Americans know and think
about the U. S. participation in foreign
affairs ?" posed many [I problem to be
mulled over in conference discussions and
then taken home. For example, when an
opinion was advanced favouring teaching
about the United Nations through emotion-
al appeal, there were some who expres-
sed concern that we might be defeating
our purposes by too emotional an empha-
sis. Facts interestingly and convincingly
presented carry with them their own emo-
tional appeal. The enlightenment and
conviction which ensues from them should
generate its own power of developing atti-
tudes.
It was especially heartening to learn that
teaching about the UN in the schools is
no longer considered unusual, but taken
for granted as natural and proper. These
very strides, however, have given rise to
criticism and misunderstanding. For under-
lying all the discussions was awareness
that the principles of international co-
operation and support of the United Na-
tions are subject to opposition from some
quarters. Many of the prepared papers
and oral presentations took account of this
fact and emphasized the need to meet such
opposition through public education and
continued explanation of the objectives of
UN and Unesco and their supporters.
Many of the delegates also expressed
concern over current controversies involv-
ing freedom of discussion, and the pro-
blem of securing the broadest possible
support in the U. S. for the principles laid
down in the American Bill of Rights. Some
observers might read into these remarks
a danger that freedom is on the wane, but
those familiar with the American scene are
hailing them as present day evidence that
the"eternal vigilance"long hailed as
"the price of liberty"continues to be
healthily exercised. The final day when
the conference findings were reported
showed delegates agreed that the best way
to combat confusion and misinformation is
through more and better education, and a
fresh presentation of the facts. They were
prepared to go back home backing their
recommendations with renewed vigour.

HEALTHY SURROUNDINGS
MAKE HEALTHY PEOPLE
Three human
beings out of
four suffer
o.
from disease
by
Dr Srock Chisholm
row EALTHY Surroundings Makeri Healthy People"-the
theme suggested for the
observance of World Health Day in
1952-points to a goal shared by
all nations, and it shows where some
of the problems lie which must be
solved if efforts to improve health
throughout the world are to succeed.
Despite the magnificent progress
made by medical science, three out
of every four men, women and
children in the world still suffer
from diseases spread by unsafe water
supplies, unsanitary excreta dis-
posal, uncontrolled insects and
rodents, and inadequate protection
of milk and other foods. The res-
ponsibility for this tragic wastage
of human life and energy rests witch
each of us, individually, in our
three-fold capacity as members of
the family and of the local com-
munity and as citizens of a shrunk-
en world.
Each of us needs to realize that
sanitation is, after all, a way of life.
Whether we live in a"developed"
or an"underdeveloped"country, it
is our duty both to ourselves and to
our neighbours to practice certain
elementary principles of hygiene
which can be applied with little, if
any, expense by individuals and by
families. Keeping a clean home, a
clean shop, a clean factory and a

General of the World Health Organization and a statement person-
ally written by the Director-General of Unesco for the Courier.
clean neighbourhood, we are meeting
one of the first requirements for our
own health and for a healthy com-
munity.
But we must go beyond this ; we
must also support fully the establish-
ment and development of local and
national programmes in community
sanitation. They deserve our sup-
port because they aim at providing
services designed to protect us
against the many dangers that may
threaten health and life if conditions
in our physical environment are
unsatisfactory.
Finally, as citizens of a world
where all men have become neigh-
bours, we must share with one an-
other the things we learn about pro-
moting health and preventing
disease through the techniques avail-
able to a modern science of environ-
mental sanitation. Such an ex-
change of knowledge among all
nations is as justified on humani-
tarian grounds as it is essential
for reasons of self-interest.
The World Health Organization
has, from its beginning, given a high
priority to international measures
for raising standards of environ-
mental sanitation. Along with its
other activities, WHO will continue
to support and encourage local, na-
tional and international efforts di-
rected towards helping people to
achieve a reasonable control of the
physical features of their environ-
ment.
I earnestly hope the observance
of World Health Day on this April
7 will serve to make clear to men,
women and children everywhere the
value of healthy surroundings and
their importance for the health of
all peoples.
WORLD Health Day 1952 takes
H5 i Is motto : Healthy sur-
roundings make healthy peo-
ple.
Education, science and culture are
also part of the environment in which
people live. That is why Unesco
views this celebration with satisfac-
tion. Each day, the efforts of the
World Health Organization and Unes-
co are combined in carrying out
educational campaigns, and this is
no fitful or transitory collaboration.
The rules of health and the possi-
bilities of observing them depend
upon the progress of scientific re-
search. Tropical medicine and clima-
tology, rural economy, the science of
nutrition and dietetics, biology and
pharmaceutical chemistry, and a host
of other theoretical and applied
sciences are necessary for a normal
existence. How can a man be healthy
if he has neither food nor shelter !
Even the most highiy-devetoped
countries must have regular recourse
to science and technology. Heatth
forms part of a global problem whose
solution demands the enlistment of
all our resources, and particularly of
our intelligence. That is why Unesco
helps scientific organizations in all
fields-cultural, physical and social- to develop and to carry out their
work and to serve the higher interests
of mankind. Today it is particularly
engaged in promoting scientific
research for the rehabilitation and
exploitation of the arid zones, which
have graduatty extended untit they
cover more than a quarter of the land
surface of the globe.
Amongst populations living by
force of circumstance outside the
range of technical progress, education
in health and hygiene is closely link-
ed with instruction in reading and
writing, and with the domestic arts
and crafts. The training centres for
specialists in fundamental education,
A world-wide
problem which
all mankind can
help to solve
by
J. Torres Bodet
which we are trying to set up all over
the world, give hygiene a very promi-
nent place in their curriculum. In the
Far East, a team of doctors, teachers
and artists, using the theme of
"A healthy village,"have developed
the most modern techniques such as
posters, animated cartoons and films,
and have adapted them to the country
where they have been operating, so as
to make the rules of individual and
collective hygiene known and adopt-
ed. In Latin America, Africa and South
Asia, the fundamental education
experiments in which we are taking
part would be inconceivable without
a simultaneous raising of the level of
economic and social life, and an im-
provement in sanitary conditions.
There is nothing visionary about
work of this kind. Health and educa-
tion cannot be kept in watertight
compartments. We are dealing with
human beings and the environment in
which they live. That is our one and
only preoccupation.
Looked at in that light ; World
Health Day. is therefore a call for
solidarity.'\Vith populations increas-
ing and the means of communica-
tion sfeadily speeding up, human
communities are less segregated than
ever before. Good and evil can no
longer be localized. That is both a
threat and a promise. Whichever
wav we take it, our duty is clear and
inescapable : we must work together,
by all means in our power, to create,
in the full'. 3sense of the term the
healthy surroundings that make
healthy people.

From the Four Corners...
* Turkey is setting up three seismo-
logical stations which, in addition
to giving detailed information on
disturbances likely to affect Turkey,
will also fit into a world network
of earthquake recording stations.
Two experts are assisting, under
Unesco's Technical Assistance Pro-
gramme : Dr. Gaston Grenet, head
of the State Meteorological and
Global Physics Institute in Algeria
(Turkey and Algeria are largely
similar From a seismological point
of view and Dr. F. J. Roesli,
lecturer in geology at the Federal
Institute of Technology in Zurich.
, * The first International Con-
ference of Artists will open in
Venice next September to"study
the practical conditions required
to ensure the freedom of the
artist."Every field of creative art
will be represented at the meetings
organized by Unesco in conjunction
with the City and Film Festival of
Venice. Problems facing the artist
in the world today will be discussed
by Arthur Honegger (music) ; Taha
Hussein Pacha (literature) ; Marc
Connelly (theatre) ; Alessandro
Blasetti (cinema) ; Georges Rouault
and Jacques Villon (painting) ;
Henry Moore (sculpture) ; and Lu-
cio Costa (architecture). The
Italian poet, Giuseppe Ungaretti,
will discuss the problem in general.
* An album on the stained glass
windows of Middle Age Europe and
a volume on philosophical thought
in the past five years, are to be
prepared by the International
Council of Philosophy and Human-
istic Studies as part of a broad
programme of research recently
approved by the second general
assembly of the Council. Other
studies by this body, created under
Unesco's auspices in 1949, include :
preparation of a Sanscrit dictionary ;
a survey of Turkish historical and
philological studies ; works on
traditions of the Moslem world, and
on South American indigenous
languages. A quarterly review on
the humanistic sciences, entitled
Diogenes, will soon appear in
English, French, Spanish and pos-
sibly other languages.
* Four French schools have taken
advantage of the opening of the
Unesco Gift Coupon Programme in
France to help crippled children in
Poland. School boys and girls
have bought gift stamps for the
Swiebodzin Home for Crippled
Children which will buy occupa-
tional therapy equipment such as
rug-weaving shuttles and a treadle-
operated saw for woodworking. It
is interesting that part of the
money comes from a girls'school at
Caen, which was itself heavily
damaged during the war.
* A school at Agnandero in
Greece, rebuilt through the help of
100, 000 Danish schoolchildren, has
now been opened. The unusual
example of international education
co-operation was begun in 1950
when the relief organization Mel-
lemfolkeligt Samvirke undertook to
rebuild the school in co-operation
with Unesco and the Danish
National Commission for Unesco.
One-half the total cost of 250, 000
kroner was granted from Danish
relief appropriations and the rest
was raised through a campaign in
Danish schools conducted under
the slogan :"Danish children build
school for Greek children."More
than 100, 000 schoolchildren partici-
pated in the campaign, which serv-
ed not only the purpose of raising
money for the project but also of
stimulating interest in Unesco and
international co-operation.
* Nicaragua is now a member of
Unesco. Following the signing by
the Nicaraguan Government of the
Constitution of Unesco and the
simultaneous deposit of the
instrument of acceptance of the
Constitution, this country has be-
come the sixty-fifth Member State
of the Organization.
* Unesco has just issued a second
impression of The Care of Paint-
ings, a 164-page illustrated mono-
graph first published last year.
(See"New Life for Old Paintings,"
in the Courier for last February.)
This bi-lingual (English-French)
publication which describes modern
techniques for reviving the splen-
dour of ancient masterpieces. costs
82. 50, 15s 6d, or 750 French francs.
* Educational television pro-
grammes for United Kingdom
schools will be started on an ex-
perimental basis on May 5. They
will be telecast daily for pupils in
six secondary schools in north
London. A joint statement by the
British Broadcasting Company and
the School Broadcasting Council
explained that the purpose of the
experiment is to try a variety of
programme techniques and to test
their effectiveness for presenting
educational material to children in
school rooms. It is understood
that if the results are satisfactory,
there may be a further experiment
in about a year involving a sub-
stantial number of schools through-
out the United Kingdom.
* Increasing progress is being
made in putting to work the heal-
ing effects of entertainment for
hospital inmates. For example,
several hospitals in the United
States of America are using micro-
film to project books on the ceiling
so that patients can read more
easily. And in France, the Social
Security Administration has just
built two experimental theatres on
the Riviera for bedridden patients.
* Nearly one million adults are
attending courses given in the ten
thousand new schools built in
Brazil since the national anti-
illiteracy campaign started in 1947.
Educational authorities report that
new classes will have to be opened
during this year to give satisfaction
to all adults asking to be taught
how to read and write.
* The heroism of the Danish-born
American Captain Kurt Carlsen,
the master of the"Flying Enter-
prise,"has so captured the admira-
tion of Danish children that it has
caused a great increase in the
number of schools applying for a
chance to participate in the na-
tion's"ship-adoption"project. This
is a system by which schools
"adopt"ships plying foreign waters,
thereby giving children a direct
personal interest in the travels of
specific vessels and lending greater
realism to the study of geography.
A similar system in Great Britain
has given four hundred thousand
British schoolchildren a keen per-
sonal interest in more than one
thousand of their country's mer-
chant vessels and in the countries
they visit.
* A record figure for books produc-
ed in Braille in Great Britain was
reached during the year 1950-51,
according to a report from the
London headquarters of the Na-
tional Institute for the Blind. Dur-
ing the year 43, 711 volumes, 28, 068
pamphlets, 370, 500 newspapers and
138, 654 magazines were produced.
including such works as the Oxford
Book of English Verse and Gray's
Anatomy.
* Some 350 recordings of African
and semi-African music are listed
in a catalogue just issued by the
African Music Transcription Library
of Johannesburg. The records,
mainly of vocal music-praise
songs, love songs, drinking songs,
etc.-were made in various parts
of the Continent by"African Music
Research,"under the direction of
Hugh Tracey, founder and director
of the African Music Society.
Records of music by African com-
posers, set to Portuguese and Latin
words, are included, among them
being parts of a Mass,"Missa
Katanga,"composed by Joseph
Kiwele.
* Compulsory education has been
ordered for Viet-Nam children be-
tween the ages of six and fourteen
years. Henceforth, they must
attend school for at least three
years. At the same time. an in-
tensive literacy drive is being
prepared for the country's adults-
sixty per cent of whom are unable
to read or write.
* The world's highest laboratory
for the study of atmospherics and
astronomy is being planned in
India. It is to be situated in the
Badrinath-Manna Pass in the Cen-
tral Himalayan Mountains at a
height of some seventeen thousand
feet. A party of Indian scientists,
under the direction of the Council
of Scientific and Industrial Re-
search, will leave in May to survey
the area, where an astronomical
dome, laboratories, power facilities
and living quarters will have to be
built.
* Youthful Dutch singers and
musicians have invited others from
Belgium, Germany, France and
England to take part in an inter-
national music week for youth, to
be held at Olaertsduyn, on the
island of Voorne, near Rotterdam
from April 14 to 20. The Dutch
People's High Schools have pre-
viously organized such gatherings
at which the young amateurs form
choirs and orchestras, but this is
the first time one has been
organized on an international basis.

The range of waves known as the electro-magnetic spectrum is like a long
piano keyboard. The string struck by each white key vibrates at half the rate of

SCIENCE has this in common with art, music
and poetry-any true and significant advance
requires creative imagination of a high order.
To be sure, the imagination of the scientific
theorist must be tempered by the picture of the
universe as available to the eyes of man, for not
all worlds are scientifically possible. But without
imagination and inventive genius science, like
any other aesthetic enterprise, withers and
becomes sterile.
There is perhap. s no better example of the
triumph of scientific imagination than our
modern conception of the nature of matter and
of energy. For a long time it had been known
that ordinary gross matter consists of individual
particles, or atoms (see"Atoms in Action"in last
February's issue of the Courier). More recently,
the Quantum Theory brought the suggestion
that light and other forms of radiant energy
exhibit particle-like attributes, despite the clas-
sical idea of light as a wave motion ("What is
the Quantum Theory ?"in the Courier for
November, 1950).
The concept of light behaving like a volley of
bullets was spectacularly shown by the experi-
ments of the American physicist Arthur Compton
in 1923. In his researches, he allowed X-rays
to strike a block of carbon, and the rays scattered
from the carbon were compared with the direct
radiation. Compton found that the X-rays,
which had rebounded from carbon, had slightly
longer wavelength than before-a fact unpre-
dieted and unexplained by the otherwise well-
founded wave theory of radiation.
And here is the point where creative imagina-
tion enters the scene-a type of co-operative
and consecutive creativity which is probably
more characteristic of the field of science than
of any other human endeavour. Trying Einstein's
idea of"light-bullets"of quanta, Compton (and
at about the same time Debye in Germany) had
the idea of treating the scattering process as a
situation transpiring on a billiard table rather
than on a pond. Considering the incoming
X-ray to be a particle rather than a wave, and
computing what would happen to it when it
struck and rebounded from an electron in a car-
bon atom, they found that the quantum would
lose just enough energy in the collision process
to account for its observed increase in wave-
length. At the same time, experimenters were
able actually to observe the recoil of the electron
that was struck by the X-ray bullet, completing
a convincing picture of the reality of"particles
of radiation.'
Physical science was accordingly in the uncom-
fortable position of having to consider light as
sometimes behaving like waves, sometimes like
particles. In its ordinary traffic with gross
matter-in passing obstacles and filtering
through apertures, in rebounding from mirrors
and penetrating transparent materials-light
would be correctly and adequately described as
a wave motion ; but in its more delicate mani-
festations, such as the Compton effect and the
photo-electric effect, only the particle concept
appeared to be adequate. Perversely, the fact is
that the plot was further complicated by the
appearance of a similar dualism in the case of
matter !
The French physicist Louis de Broglie grappled
with the idea presented by the double nature of
radiant energy ; and while he could see no imme-
diate resolution of the difficulty, he was led to
think of the possibility that the other great entity
in the universe-matter-might be beset by
the same dilemma. Accordingly, he made the bold
suggestion that matter might possess undulatory
characteristics in addition to its accepted and
evident particle-like nature. Both matter and
radiation are carriers of energy, and"it would
seem,"he said,"that the basic idea of the quan-
tum theory is the impossibility of imagining an
isolated quantity of energy without associating
with it a certain frequency."Material particles
ought, therefore, to be accompanied by waves of
some kind, and these waves should be detectable
experimentally. Within a year of Compton's dis-
covery, de Broglie had sketched a rather complete
and far-reaching analogy between light waves

WAVES IN SPACE
(Continued and"matter waves."
from pre- The notion is revo-

covery of the electron and of
X-rays, physicists took great paint
to distinguish carefully between
what were identified essentially as
particles of matter and other see-
mingly distinct things that were
verified to have the properties of
waves. Now they were being pre-
sented with the need for admitting
that matter, as well as radiation,
has both attributes.
Proof of the existence of matter
waves was not long in coming.
Experimenters found that electrons
rebound from crystals only in cer-
tain definite directions, in much
the same way as light waves do.
Further, the observed lengths of
the waves associated with electrons
came out in perfect accord with
the values calculated from the for-
mula developed by de Broglie.
Other experimental proofs showed
that particles of matter bear the
unmistakable stamp of waves.
But it is evident that they
cannot be the same as light waves,
for groups of"matter waves"may
travel with any speed-the speed
of the particle with which they are
linked-while light waves travel
with a fixed speed in a given
substance. This question and
many others were answered
through a significant extension of
de Broglie's ideas, carried out
mainly by the Austrian theorist
Erwin Schrodinger and others like
Born and Heisenberg in Germany
and Bohr in Denmark. The re-
sulting body of theory, called wave
mechanics, has a highly mathema-
tical framework but it provides us
with a powerful tool for solving
problems involving matter and
radiation which the earlier deve-
lopments in quantum theory were
unable to attack at all. The waves
are interpreted as something that
guides particles in their courses.
Science at present is reconciled
to accepting the apparent dual
nature of both matter and radia-
tion, and to dealing with radiation
that sometimes behaves like par-
ticles and with bits of matter that,
on occasion, behave like waves.
The new theories provide us with
a formalism that correctly repre-
sents the details of atomic pheno-
mena. They demand in return
only that we give up the somewhat
naive hope of being able to visual-
ize what goes on in the atomic
world in terms of our ordinary
large-scale experience.

LEONARDO DA VINCI
the universal genius
15 April 1452 - 2 may 1519
by Jose de Benito
"HEBE is a miraculous story, all of
which is not only true, but can be
proved,"Paul Valéry once wrote of
the life of Leonardo da Vinci.
"Were it fictitious, it would form a chapter in
the mythology of the human mind and Leonardo
would be one of the heroes or demi-gods in the
history of the intellect. Yet all the proofs of
his stupendous life are there for those who
demand them and his great achievements may
be seen bv all who have eyes to see."This
explains why, in the words of his faithful Melzi,
at his death"all grieved at the loss of such a
man, whose like nature will never repeat."
In the year 1452, "Ser Antonio"noted in his
diary : "A grandson was born to me-the son
of Ser Piero, my
son-on April 15,
a Saturday, at three
o'clock in the morn-
ing."Ser Antonio,
a landowner living
in the Florentine
village of Vinci, was
a man of few
occupations. In a
declaration made in
1457, he stated that
he lived in his
house and did no-
thing. Presumably

FEW of Leonardo do Vinci's original paintings havecome down to us today. In fact fewer than 20 are

the large cities of Europe. Leonardo's drawings - though
far more numerous-are only in a limited number of
collections (Windsor Castle in England has the widest
selection).To help commemorate the 500th anniversary
of the birth of Leonardo on April 15, 1452, Unesco has
prepared a series of 45 travelling exhibitions each contain-
my 150 facsimile reproductions of the great master's
drawings. The exhibitions are being sent to the member

occupied tending his vines and his land and
watching hie five-year-old grandson running
about the house and fields. Little Leonardo
observed with rapture the falcons in flight,
the painstaking industry of the ants, and
the clouds overhead. He used every scrap of
paper that came his way to render the graceful
lines of the cypresses, the gnarled shapes of the
olive and fig-trees, the houses in the surround-
ing countryside and the outlines of the animals
that grazed on the hills.
The discoveries that Leonardo made in those
first five years of true liberty, in close com-
munion with nature, looking, assimilating and
understanding, left a profound mark upon his
mind. His earliest recollections were suffused
with light, with fantasy and with a prescience
of his future destiny. Leonardo himself tells
us of it in his Notebooks and in his Treatise on
Fainting.
One day, as he lay in his bed watching the
wind driving the clouds helter-skelter over the
top of Mount Albano, a falcon-the lesser eagle
of those valleys-alighted beside him, and after
a moment's contemplation, brushed Leonardo's
parted lips with its tail and throat-feathers, so
that-as though anointed by an eagle-his
destiny was marked by the cares of the bird
which lords it over the skies of Leonardo's native
Tuscany.
Another time, he found a grotto and, torn
between fear of the darkness and his curiosity
to discover its twilit mysteries, he crept in, and
perhaps even then glimpsed the harmony with
which he was later to endow his"Vir-
gin of the Rocks." And it was from his childish
fashion inventions of every sort."From this
idea, too he derived his use of lines, half imagi-
nary, half real, to depict battles, landscapes or
figures in motion, or to catch in the vibration of
tongues of bronze the sound of words and
phrases.
The song of the streams, of the birds and of
the wind in the olive-trees and vineyards around
Vinci led him to the study of music. His urge
to learn the why and the wherefore of things
was transformed into a love of drawing and
mechanics. His thirst for precision led him to
mathematics-to calculus and geometry. His
passion for knowledge and reading drove him to
learn Latin as the only vehicle whereby he could
read the volumes piled thigh in the library of the
parish priest at Vinci-his first teacher in the
humanities. And his repeated contemplation of
the stars in the Tuscan
sky roused him to study (Continued on page. 8.)
It was neither " La Gioconda " nor
"The Last Slipper"which brought
Leonardo the greatest fame in the
Italy of his day, but"The Battle of
Anghiari,"for which he made these
two studies of the heads of fighting
warriors. Leonardo undertook this
fresco, of which practically nothing
has been preserved, to decorate the
new council hall in the Palace of
Ihe Signory in Florence. He con-
ceived it as one of the"glorious

done was the central group which

astronomy. He saw
with. hi, s eyes and his
will was strong, but ignorance interposed itself
like the bars of a cage between his thirst for
learning and universal-or as he termed it,
"solar"-freedom of knowledge. Leonardo
thereupon devoted all his energies to overcoming
the obstacle presented by those iron bars, in
order that, like the falcon that had anointed him,
he might fly free through space.
With that varied but incomplete stock of
knowledge, Leonardo left his village of Vinci
and came to the city of Florence, in those years
of the Qllalll'occnlo (1400-1500) the very heart of
the Renaissance. It was a great adventure to
arrive at the Tuscan capital where in the period
following the splendours of Dante and Boccaccio
Were gathered together the masterpieces of Giotto
in the church of Santa Croce, of Masaccio in the
church of Santa Maria del Carmine, and of
Mantegna and Piero della Francesca. The
patronage, first of Cosimo, and then of Lorenzo
di Medici, peopled the city of the rich silk and
wool merchants with the most illustrious names
in the arts, the culture and the science of the age.
The burghers of Florence had understood that,
if they were to reap the fruits of their wealth,
they must enjoy freedom. Without it their
possessions might, from one day to the next,
pass into the hands of the tyrant of the hour ; for
then as today, the one path to liberty lay through
culture. That is why thev called in Greek
masters to teach them, and why, not content
with that, they sent their young men of
outstanding promise and industry to study the
\vorks of antiquity in Greece. This policy paid
a rich dividend, and the Academy of Plato,
founded by Cosimo di Medici, was inspired by
the learning of men (like Pao ! o L'cceHo and
A perfect balance between the
Marsilio Ficino)'whom Lorenzo the Magnificent
collected around him.
For a youngster of sixteen, with Leonardo's
spiritual and mental make-up, Florence was the
ordeal of fire. Donatello had just died, and
Verrocchio, Ghiberti, Ghirlandaio, Alberti,
Perugino, Botticelli, Andrea del Sarto-all of
them magicians in the use of brush and chisel,
in gold and silver work, metal-casting and
building-were not legendary figures, but
beings of flesh and blood talking together and
discussing solutions to the problems they
encountered daily in their work.
Scarcely had Leonardo arrived in Florence,
when his father, the notary Ser Piero, thinking
to have his illegitimate son taught a trade, took
some of the boy's drawings to show to
Verrocchio. Verrocchio at once perceived the
young draughtsman's extraordinary gifts and
took him into his studio without further ado.
Thus Ser Piero was-fortunately-able to
forget his"youthful escapade,"and in the genius
who created the"Colleone"and the"David,"
Leonardo found a father, friend and guide, so
that in four years he passed from the status of
apprentice to that of master painter (1468-14i2).
His companions in the studio were Sandro
Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi and Pietro Perugino.
Verrocchio, Leonardo and Credi first collaborated
publicly on the"Baptism of Christ."\Vhen the
public came to examine the picture, they realized
that another great artist was now making his
contribution to the greater glory of Florence.
Team-work was the rule in the"workshops"of
the Renaissance painters. The master would
plan, direct, paint in parts, compose, add the
finishing touches and sign the work."The
Annunciation,"preserved in the Uffizi Gallery,
is another collective product of Verrochio's
studio. The Angel in it is by Leonardo, and for
many years it was claimed that here the disciple
had excelled his master, though today that claim
is no longer upheld.
It seems that Leonardo continued to work with
Verrocchio until towards 1480, when the master
moved to Venice to start on the"Colleone"
monument for the Republic ; and not long
afterwards, BotticeIli and Perugino also left
Florence on an invitation from Pope Sixtus IV
to work in the Vatican chapel. In the twelve
years between 14di8 and 1480, Leonardo possessed
by his thirst for knowledge, not only worked at
his drawing, painting, sculpture and metal-
casting, but besides that, he visited the houses of
Leon Battista Alberti and Paolo Uccello, true
masters of æsthetics ; he read books on geo-
metry, hydraulics, mathematics and optics ; he
seized every opportunity to make the acquain-
tance of Yisiting masters, and counted among
his friends the physicist Toscanelli, the astro-
nomer Marmocchi, the cartographer Amerigo
Vespucci and the mathematician Benedetto
Aritmetico. He attended the Academy debates,
composed music and wrote words for songs,
made musical instruments, and untiringly took
notes and made sketches of everything he sa\v,

capacity to see and to understand
plumb its secrets."Great love,"he said,
"springs from profound knowledge of the object
loved."His first-hand study of nature enabled
him to pursue this enormous diversity of inter-
ests'without thereby weakening his own per-
sonality. He filled notebook upon notebook :
"I tell painters that in art, no one should copy
the manner of another, else will he produce but
a nephew to nature, and not a son."
At the age of thirty, gifted'with everything
needed to fulfil his universal mission, and
engaged at the time on the"Adoration of the
Magi"-a picture which, although unfinished,
represents a revolution in æsthetic, perspective,
conception and composition-Leonardo betook
himself to Milan, bearing a silver lyre shaped
like a horse's head, which Lorenzo the Magni-
ficent was sending as a gift to Ludovico Sforza.
Conscious of his skill and firmlv assured of his
ideas, he sent to the Regent of Milan the famous
letter in'which he explained all that he could do
for the Dukedom-build canals, manufacture
new arms, perform feats of engineering and
architecture-concluding with the statement
that, in painting and sculpture, he could do"any
task as well as another man."
During this second period, at Milan, Leonardo
gave forth the fruits of his maturity."Mortal

the romantic ! who said :"I love those who want
the impossible,"Leonardo, executant and realist,
had the advantage when he said :"I do not want
the impossible."Yet at the same time he
enlarged the scope of human endeavour to an
unbelievable extent. All three developed their
own theory of colour. All three-as Gælhe
expressed it in naming one of his works-were
poetry and truth. The genius of all three was
universal. But of the three, Leonardo alone
displayed that unique phenomenon-a perfect
balance between capacity to see and capacity to
understand. We do not know whether his eyes
were his intellect, or whether his intellect lay in
his eyes, but we do know'that both gave to his
hands the means to do what he did. He has
been called an"intellectual artisan,"but he was
more-much more. If ever in human history
there was a prototype, on which future men
could be modelled in the mass, then Leonardo
would be the prototype uf"Man the Intellectual."
A few days before he died at Amboise on
. May 2, 1519, where his last patron, Francis I, had
provided him with lodging, Leonardo knowing
that he was near his end, uttered three words :
"I shall survive,"by which he meant his
influence would live on. An actin'illlnlOda1ìty

and culture from the full cup of his life and
work. to enrich a world, like himself seeking
.'avidly after truth.
"May it please God, the Illuminator of all things,
so to enlighten me that I treat light'worthily."
Soon after finishing the"Last Supper" (1499),
he started on his travels through Italy : Venice,
Florence again, Pavia, Rome and back to Milan.
By now the perfection of his work was familiar
to all.
Leonardo was pouring out sketches and studies
for his"Saint John,"the"Virgin and Saint
Anne,""Leda,""Elizabeth d'Este"and the
"Gioconda,"in all of which the painter'was
seeking not only to create a work of art, but also
to apply his doctrine of universalism. Behveen

Some of Leonardo's
aphorisms-
* You can have neither a greater nor a less dominion
than over yourself.
* Experience, the interpreter between formative nature
and the human race, teaches how that nature acts among
mortals ; and being constrained by necessity cannot act
otherwise than as reason, which is its helm, requires
her to act.
* In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what
has passed and the first of that which comes : so with
time present.
* Shun those studies in which the work that results dies
with the worker.
* Nothing can be either loved or hated unless it is first
known.
* You do ill if you praise but worse if you censure
what you do not rightly understand.
* Iron rust from disuse ; stagnant water loses its purity
and, in cold, water becomes frozen ; even so does inaction
sap the vigour of the mind.
* Where the descent is easier, there the ascent is moredifficult.
* Every part is disposed to unite with the whole, so
that it may thereby escape from its own incompleteness.
* A drop is that which does not detach itself from the
rest of the water unless the power of its weight is more
than its adhesion to the water with which it is joined.
* The earth is moved from its position by the weight
of a tiny bird resting upon it. The surface of the sphere
of water is moved by a tiny drop of water falling upon it.
* Two weaknesses leaning together create a strength.
Therefore the half of the world leaning against the other
half becomes firm.
* A thing that moves acquires as much space as it loses.
* Science is the captain, practice the soldiers.
"* Whoever in discussion adduces authority uses not hismtellect but rather memory.
* The idea or the faculty of imagination is both rudder
and bridle to the senses.
* This benign nature so provides that over all the world
you find something to imitate.
* A good painter has two objects to represent : man,
and the intention of his soul. The first is easy, the
second difficult.
* Call not that riches which may be lost ; virtue is our
true wealth and the true reward of its possessor. It
cannot be lost ; it will not abandon us unless life itself
first leaves us. As for property and material wealth,
these you should hold in fear ; full often they leave their
possessor in ignominy, mocked at for having lost pos-
session of them.
* Of streams of water equal in length, breadth and
declivity, the swiftest will be the one of greatest depth.
* The goldfinch will carry spurge to its little ones
imprisoned in a cage : death rather than loss of liberty.
* Feathers shalt raise men towards heaven even as they
do birds-that is, by letters written with their quills.
* The age as it flies glides secretly and deceives one
and another ; nothing is more fleeting than the years,
but he who sows virtue reaps honour.
* While I thought that I was learning how to live, I
have been learning how to die.
- and three of his fables
The cedar, arrogant by reason of its beauty, despising
the plants which were round about it, caused them all
to be removed from its presence, and then the wind, not
meeting with any obstacle, tore it up by the roots and
threw it on to the ground.
Once upon a time the razor, emerging from the handle
which served it as a sheath, and placing itself in the sun,
saw the sun reflected on its surface, at which thing it took
great pride, and turning it over in its thoughts it began
to say to itself :"Am I to go back any more to that shop
from which I have just now come away ? No, surely ! It
cannot be the pleasure of the gods that such radiant
beauty should stoop to such vile uses ! What madness
would that be which should induce me to scrape the
lathered chins of rustic peasants and to do such menial
service ? Is this body made for such actions as these ?
Certainly not ! I will go and hide myself in some retired
spot, and there pass my life in tranquil ease."
And so having hidden itself away for some months,
returning one day to the light and coming out of its
sheath it perceived that it had acquired the appearance
of a rusty saw, and that its surface no longer reflected
the sun's radiance. In vain with useless repentance it
bemoaned its irreparable hurt, saying to itself :"Ah, how
much better it would have been to have let the barber
use that lost edge of mine that had so rare a keenness !
Where is now the glittering surface ? In truth the foul
insidious rust has consumed it away."
The same thing happens with minds which in lieu of
exercise give themselves up to sloth ; for these like the
razor lose their keen edge, and the rust of ignorance
destroys their form.
The flint on being struck by the steel marvelled greatly
and said in a stern voice :"What arrogance prompts you
to annoy me ? Trouble me not, for you have chosen me
by mistake. I have never done harm to anyone."To
which the steel made answer :"If you will be patient you
will see what a marvellous result will issae forth from
you."
At these words the flint was pacified and patiently
endured its martyrdom, and it saw itself give birth to
the marvellous element of fire which by its potency
became a factor in innumerable things.
This is said for those who are dismayed at the outset
of their studies, and then set out to gain the mastery
over themselves and in patience to apply themselves
continuously to those studies, from which one sees result
things marvellous to relate.
On tyre ceilings of the great Sala dell'Asse in Milan, Leonardo painted a series of striking deco-
rations of abstract puzzle-patterns intermingling with designs of living boughs and leavens.

Leonardo the architect left numerous plans for huildings and other works,
like this sketch of a church, square in plan, with a central done and bell
towers. He studied profoundly the works of Alberti and Bramante.
He even planned an aeroplane - over 400 years before the world took flying
for granted. Leonardo, who was left-handed, wrote from right to left. His
words can be deciphered by placing them upside down against a mirror.

### 71035: American education and the United Nations

Page 12. APRIL 1952 UNESCaOUR'E !
NEW Yorkers recently flocked to an exhibitionshowing that the American Way of Life is a
combination of many (mostly non-American) ways.
The exhibition was unusual in a number of aspects. Tt
was not housed in one building. Instead, the exhibits
were shown in a hundred shop-windows in leading stores
in and around Fifth Avenue. To organize the
exhibitions, 32 of the city's museums had got together
in their biggest joint enterprise ever.
The exhibition, which was called"World on View,"
was held in honour of the National Conference of the
United States National Commission for Unesco."World
on View"chose as its theme one of Unesco's main
tasks-helping the man in the street to visualize the
interdependence of all men and all nations.
Americans were reminded that they are surrounded by
everyday objects which have their origin in many parts
of the world. They were shown, for instance, that when
"Mr. Average American"awakes to begin a"typical
American day,"he is muffled to the ears in materials of
Oriental origin. Whether his pyjamas and bedclothes are
made from cotton, linen, wool or silk, they all came
originally from Asia.
It might be imagined that nothing could be more Ame-
rican than the American breakfast ; but, the exibition
shows that nearly every item on the breakfast menu
originated far away on the other side of the Atlantic or
Pacific. Bread was first eaten in the Near East, the use
of butter began as a cosmetic in the same region, and
coffee was an Abyssinian plant discovered by the Arabs.
Dishes had their origin in China, and the table fork was
first used during the Middle Ages in Mediterranean
countries.
Not all the exibits, however, were a5 light-hearted as
this ; but, whether matter-of. fact, grave or humorous, they
all were aimed at interesting the passers-by in the way
people work, play, dress, eat and think, not only in
their own country, but in others too.
There was an exhibit on"Speed and World Space,"

AT least half the men and women who came to theThird National Conference of the U. S. National
Commission for Unesco were connected with
education in one form or another. Over 100 colleges
and universities sent officially accredited delegates.
A score of university presidents and representatives
from the country's leading educational associations
were there. Even more heartening was the number of
classroom teachers, principals, and specialists in
various fields from art to zoology, who had come to
Hunter College from all parts of the United States.
University professors and school administrators took
a prominent part in the leadership of the sections,
panels and work groups into which the conference was
divided. Also meeting with the professional educators
were several hundred students whose comments and
observations carried equal weight in defining problems
and offering suggestions. Students too joined with
adult leaders to formulate many findings related to
the educational phases of the conference.
Group after group took hold of the need for a
complete programme of education that would translate
information about the United Nations and better
knowledge of other peoples into the familiar facts of
everyday living. Experts in elementary education, as
well as those from the secondary schools and at the
college level, were agreed that teaching about the
UN and the Specialized Agencies be regarded as an
important part of all regular school activities. When
it came to a discussion of science clubs, student assem-
blies, college newspapers and other extracurricular
activities, the same thinking prevailed-do not separate
an interest in foreign affairs from any field that
attracts the regular attention of students, talk about
the UN whenever its work fits logically with the sub-
ject matter under discussion, introduce special projects
for international understanding whenever they can be
related to other learning experiences. In brief, the
conference was bent on making the United Nations a
part and parcel of every class and student interest
from nursery school to graduate seminar.
The importance of realizing why our international
organizations have come into existence was brought
out at a joint meeting of educational groups. At this
session over 1. 000 educators heard that the United
States is faced with a whole re-orientation of our
schools toward the world in which we are now living.
The United Nations and Unesco are a bridge to that
world, and educating for world understanding in the
broad sense, rather than merely teaching about UN
AMERICAN EDUCATION AND THE
UN) TED NAT) ONS
by Dr E. arl J. McGrath,
U. S. Commissioner of Education
and Unesco, is part of the challenge for school people.
Several educators suggested that possibly the main
difficulty faced by adults in their work with interna-
tional agencies may be that their own schooling in
these matters started so late-an observation which
highlights the task of bringing the work of the inter-
national organizations close to the people of UN
member nations, often designated the peculiar respon-
sibility of Unesco.
During an earlier panel report on"The Fight
Against Igncrance,"Unesco had been referred to as
the educational arm of the United Nations. Its
programme of fundamental education was described
as reaching out to lift the uneducated people in various
parts of the world. There was a clear recognition that
the elimination of illiteracy throughout the world was
essential if peoples generally were to understand the
work of the UN and to dedicate themselves to the
permanent establishment of peace.
Those attending this panel were also reminded not
to lose sight of the secondary purpose of fundamental
education, which is to improve the community itself.
Constantly alluded to and illustrated throughout the
conference were stories of how this is being done.
The problems of the underdeveloped areas, where
hunger, sickness and early death are the common lot,
were mentioned in several section meetings. Other
world problems of interest to school people are :-
(1) The continual need to expand and hold gains
made by free and compulsory schooling-eventually
guaranteeing to all children and young people the
right to an education expressly set forth in the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights.
(2) Education for adults, including a discussion of
how interest and methods usually vary to meet vastly
different situations and needs.
(3) Improvement of textbooks and teaching mate-
rials. A brief report on Unesco sponsored seminars
was included in one of the working papers.
Such were the ideas and the information which the
professors and the school teachers, the administrators
and other specialists, had fresh in their minds when
they met in the work sessions of their choice. They
also brought to these informal group discussions a
wealth of practical experience, innumerable questions,
and some doubts.
How to help parents, teachers and children gain a
feeling of responsibility toward other people, was
identified as a main task for those engaged in pre-
school and elementary education.
In a Pennsylvania school the sixth graders had cut
the problem down to size by asking,"What are the
greatest needs of children in the world today ?"
Each child represented a UN member nation to give
the presentation. A Minneapolis classroom posed a
series of questions about the United Nations, organized
into teams, read as much as possible on each subject,
and, after holding group discussions, worked out a
simple dramatic programme to be presented to the
school and the Parent-Teacher Association. But
especially needed are music and drama, and book
materials pictorially interesting, based on experience
and suited to the child's reading capacity.
When the question of materials and teaching
methods came up in work groups devoted to the
Secondary Schools, leaders thought that major respon-
sibility for their development rests with the teaching
profession itself. One group expressed firm belief
that, although UN information has a place through
the entire curriculum, all students before their educa-
tion terminates should have an opportunity for a

which presented the expanding horizons in a shrinking
world. Another,"The Book,"covered the history of
reading matter from the Babylonian clay tablets of 4, 000
years ago to the present day.
"Mankind speaks through the Arts"was a synopsis
of sculpture from Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa
and the America, Furniture, clothing, jewellery, cera-
mics, silverware, textiles, glassware and many other every-
day objects were all dealt with from a universal point of
view.
The aim of the exhibition-in the words of Mr. René
d'Harnencourt, who headed the specially-formed New
York Museums Committee for the National Conference-
was to show how museums"may be used to increase an
understanding by the public of its own heritage, and
show each citizen his place in the world as a whole."
The exhibits were designed to interest passers-by in
exploring further the immense world resources at their
own doorstep.
.'A knowledge of the world and its people has never
been so important to every individual as it is now."
declared Mr. d'Harnencourt."Every political and eco.
nomic event, no matter where it may take place, eventually
affects the lives of every one of us. To know the world
and its people has become a necessity for all."
Mr. d'Harnencourt, who is Director of New York'
Museum of Modern Art, said that the exhibition could
"strengthen our consciousness of the interdependence of
the world, and create a desire for international co-
operation without which the efforts of UN and Unesco
cannot be successful."
At the same time as the National Commissions
Conference discussed how the citizen can play a greater
part in solving world problems, thousands saw these
exhibits which, although largely a spectacle of the live-
of others in the past and the present, succeeded in bring-
ing home to many an onlooker his function in the field-
of human activity.

systematic study of the United Nations, and suggested
the world history course as the logical place for it.
Definite plans for extending school programmes in
international relations were mapped out by a second
group. One specific recommendation advanced was
greater use of foreign students and exchange pro-
fessors, and of other speakers available from consulates,
diplomatic missions and the United Nations.
Finding out that basically people are more alike than
they are different, that differences do exist, and that
somehow ways must be found to live together in peace
in the face of these differences, was believed to be the
crux of the matter.
It was the sense of another work session thai 0-
day students should be led to an understanding of how
foreign policies have often reflected national interests,
but how in recent times they have taken account
increasingly of humanitarian concerns for other people.
An effective demonstration of many of these teaching
principles was given by the schools of the greater New
York City area during the Unesco gathering. Two
junior conferences were arranged by the local board
of education-one for ninth grade students, one for
the tenth to the twelfth grades. Junior confer-
ence activities culminated in a Youth Forum sponsor-
ed by the New York Times and televised from the
Hunter College Auditorium.
At the college level, not only knowledge but insight
into other ways of life is required for evaluating inter-
national issues. The value of developing a capacity
for mature judgment, rather than formulating the
judgments and attitudes of students, was stressed.
The working session given over to the exchange of
persons was concerned with the administrative pro-
blems as well as the value of the interchanges. Over
200 people attended, many of them officials of colleges
and universities charged with the responsibilities of
orienting foreign students in the United States.
American colleges and universities have long realiz-
ed responsibilities for extending their services beyond
the physical bounds of their institutions. It is logical
that a conference on"The Citizen and the United
Nations"should include a work session which urged
closer co-operation between the universities and the
various community agencies and organizations interest-
ed in motivating more serious adult study of the UN
and international problems.
GROWING ISOLATION IN SCIENCE
tS CALLED ALARM) NG
by Dr Bart J. Bok,
Harvard University
AMERICAN scientists and engineers who parti-cipated in the Third National Un sco Conference
at Hunter College see in such meetings a tre-
mendous potential in bridging the gulfs and prejudices
between scientific disciplines which have seriously
retarded the advance of knowledge.
Working on all levels of the conference, scientists
received new insight of the work of fellow Americans
in the field of international affairs and set their own
sights on specific ways in which pure and applied
science can contribute to the construction of a stable
peace. Because the results of scientific study are of
immediate, potential value to all nations, it was
stressed that the objectives of Unesco cannot be
achieved without encouraging and promoting both
basic and applied science.
Calling attention to the fact that the world's
reserves of essential metals would be exhausted
within 25 years, if the per capita use of metals in
the rest of the world equalled that in the U. S., the
working group called for the formation of a research
group to consider the minerai resources problem on
a world basis as n essential element in the United
Nations programme of raising world living standards.
Interwoven into the discussions was the recognition
that free exchange of information and facilitation of
travel are both essential to scientific progress and
human welfare and that nationalism in science leads
to international misunderstanding and impedes the
promotion of world peace. The delegates were very
outspoken against unnecessary and undesirable
restrictions on exchange of information and travel of
scientists which now exist in certain countries, includ-
ing our own. They viewed with alarm the increasing
scientific isolation of the U. S.
The U. S. National Commission was urged to give
added impetus to the scientific and technological
programme of Unesco and it was urged that there be
no reduction in funds now allotted to technical
assistance and the field science co-operation offices,
grants in aid, international research laboratories and
documentation and scientific abstracting.
Recognizing that a better balance should be
achieved by Unesco in its support of basic and applied
sciences, the delegates recommended that assistance
to medical and engineering sciences be brought up to
the level of support for the more basic sciences and
that attention be given to the promotion of inter-
national co-operation in the agricultural sciences, if
possible in co-operation with FAO. The conviction
was expressed that the services of the engineering
profession have not adequately been utilized by Unesco
and a survey of proposals regarding closer co-operation
between Unesco and the world-wide engineering
profession, prepared by the work group of the
Engineers'Joint Council, was transmitted to the
National Commission. Included were suggestions
regarding the development of engineering education
in foreign countries and the s2lection of qualified
students for education in the engineering sciences in
the U. S.

### 71045: How Europeans feel about Americans

Page 14. APRIL 1952
HOW EUROPEANS FEEL ABOUT AMERICANS
MORE and m. >re these days, one hears people talkingabout how important it is if we are to have peace
for the peoples of the world to understand one
another. And there is increasing recognition that the
public opinion survey can play a major role-if only an
indirect one-in bringing about such understanding.
Before we can go about straightening up whatever mis-
understandings exist in the minds of people, we must
have some notion of what the conceptions are that people
have of one another. One way of discovering what
images one people has of another, is to ask questions of
a cross-section of the population and analyze their
answers.
In 1948, the Social Sciences Division of Unesco, as part
of the International Tensions Project, sponsored a public
opinion poll in nine countries-six of them European.
People in each of these countries were shown a list of
12 adjectives and asked to indicate which of those
attributes they thought applied to their fellow-country-
men, then to the Russians and then to the Americans.
There are many interesting things to be seen in the
results of this study. You might want to compare the
image these peoples have of themselves with the one
they have of Americans. Or you might look at the
stereotype of the Russians and compare that with the
stereotype of the Americans. Or you might want to
compare the Frenchman's image of his fellow French-
man with the Britisher's view of Englishmen. And so
on.
One way of getting some idea of the differences which
the Europeans feel exist between themselves and Ameri-
cans is to look for the adjectives they use more frequently
to describe themselves than to describe Americans. And
theft, on the other hand, to look for those adjectives they
apply more often to Americans than to themselves.
'Progressive, pratical, generous'
LOOKING at the data from this point of view, we lind
-- that as compared with Americans, Europeans much
more often think of themselves as : brave, intelligent,
peaceloving. As compared with Europeans they see
Americans as : progressive, practical, generous.
It is fairly easy to understand our reputation in Europe
as practical and progressive people. Our economic
development and our technical proficiency speak for us
on that score. And considering the role the U. S. has
played in the post-war economy of Europe, it is not
surprising that we are thought of as generous. There is
nothing uncomplimentary in any of these attributes
themselves.
But the fact that Europeans pay scanty tribute to our
courage and our intelligence is not so easy to swallow.
In terms of international understanding in this critical
period, however, perhaps the most important thing to
consider is that while Europeans think of themselves as
predominantly peace-loving people, they do not think of
Americans in this way. We think of ourselves primarily
as a peace-loving nation. The Europeans evidently have
some doubts and possibly even some fears about this.
While we aren't considered as un-peace-loving as the
Russians, a peace-loving nature is not thought to be one
of our prime assets as people. It seems, therefore, that
there's a job for us Americans to do if we are to win
the confidence of the West Europeans as regards our
interest in peace.
Recently, we had occasion to interview Poles who had
crossed into the Western Zone of Germany. Among
other things, we asked these people to give us their
impressions of the kind of people Americans are, and
how they compare with the people of their own country.
Again, one is struck by the contrast between the self-
image and the image of the American.
'Materiatistic, setf-centred, nervous*
A 26-year-old chemical engineer stressed the psycho-
logical difference between the Poles and the
Americans. He said :
"The Americans are fond of a fast, nervous, eventful
life. They need strong stimuli, films with ghosts and a
lot of murders. They are after sensation, they adore film
stars, they set no great store by sentimental life. The
Americans are guided in all their doings by reason and
calculation whereas the Poles are led by sentiment in all
their thoughts and deeds."
And a 29-year-old woman who taught high school and
holds a master of arts degree in Polish literature, talked
about the self-centredness of the American :
"Americans are characterized by unceremonious be-
haviour, by nonchalance which gives the impression
of'a lack of orderliness, but after all, they must be pretty
smart people. However, the Americans are rather snper-
ficial and consider their America the navel of the world.
What goes on in the outside world is of no interest to
them. The greatest point of interest to an American is
his personal prosperity. In America, materialism reigns
in every field."
This view of the American as materialistic, self-centred,
nervous and unsentimental, is not inconsistent with the
view of the Americans as primarily"practical,""pro.
gressive,"and"generow ;," which was revealed by the
Unesco stereotype study. It is just another piece of
evidence which points to the fact that the European may
find qualities which he admires in the American, but
nevertheless feels that there is some intangible quality
- lack of sensitivity to spiritual values, if you like-that
distinguishes the American from the European and

makes for a barrier to understanding and genuine
sympathy between the countries.
Now let's turn to the subject of American foreign
policy. During the last few months of 1950, the Inter-
national Public Opinion Research, Inc. conducted public
opinion surveys in several West European countries.
We interviewed cross-sections of the populations in Great
Britain, France, Western Germany, Italy and Sweden.
We asked these people a lot of questions : about problems
in their own countries, about their feelings concerning
the possibilities of war, about their views on Russia and
about their views on the United States. (I should say
that the actual interviewing was done, of course, by
natives of each of the countries concerned.)
We found then-and this study was begun just about
the time hostilities broke out in Korea-that the popu-
lations of these countries were generally more sympathetic
to the United States than they were to Russia (with
the exception, of course, of the small groups of
Communists in each country). But this sympathy was
rather obviously a qualified one : West Europeans did not
regard American policies with complete trust.
In addition, we found that there were difference be-
tween countries in this respect. At the time these surveys
were conducted, the evidence seemed to point to the
conclusion that the British, West German and Swedish
population were definitely more pro-U. S. in their
sympathies than the French and Italians. In these last
two countries, large proportions of the population had
doubts and suspicions about the intentions of the United
States.
It is not that large numbers of West Europeans
actually fear or actively dislike the United States. Far
from it. When people in Great Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and Sweden were asked what countries they feared
or what countries they like least, fewer than 10 per cent
anywhere named the United States.
On the other hand, the United States does not
necessarily occur to Western Europeans when they are
asked to name a country toward which they feel
particularly friendly or sympathetic. The British are
more often friendly toward the U. S. than are members
of the other nations. Even in Britain, however, only
about four out of 10 named the United States as the
country they feel most friendly toward. The French
mentioned the Low Countries and Switzerland more often
than the U. S. ; and the Swedes named Great Britain as
often as the United States.
The question of what makes for suspicion about the
intentions of the U. S. in the mind of the Western
U. S. ARTISTS PREPARE
FOR WORLD
ART CONGRESS
FOR many of the theatre and music repre-sentatives attending the Third U. S. National
Conference, the experience was not a new
one. But for the painter, sculptor, graphic ar-
tist and architect, it was their first opportunity
to learn at first-hand about Unesco.
Unesco's announcement that it would sponsor
the first international conference devoted to the
arts had attracted the interest of a large number
of American artists. Special meetings on the
arts were keyed into plans for American parti-
cipatlon in this international arts congress. Over
200 artists, representing music, theatre, litera-
ture, the graphic and the plastic arts from all
sections of the United States came to learn
more about Unesco as a specialized agency of
the UN system, having responsibility for pre-
serving and advancing cultural interchange as
a factor in building a world community.
Two special meetings of interest to the visual
arts world were held. The first devoted to the
visual arts, was led by a panel composed largely
of art educators. They presented a pessimistic
view of Unesco's achievements in terms of the
broad imaginative programme which the Orga-
nization had originally developed in its formative
years. Two days later, a second panel discussion
on the"'Arts in the World Community"consi-
dered Unesco's work from the point of view of
music, theatre, painting, architecture and lite-
rature. In this meeting, as in that on the visual
arts, emphasis was placed on the importance of
the artist's contribution to the world's culture
heritage. Recognition of this contribution, the
delegates believed, must come at two levels : the
national and international. They recognized
that the American artist receives civic support
from many sources such as through his national
organizations, the maintenance of museums
through private means, and community sponsor-
ship of sy, mphony orchestras. What the artist
wants, however, is some evidence that his con-
tribution is important enough to warrant popu-
lar support. At the national level, they desire
governmental interest which will assure the
artist of an even greater opportunity to exercise
his craft ; at the international level, a greater
opportunity for the exchange of ideas, resources,
and materials with the practising artists in other
parts of the world, thereby achieving a. more
active interchange of cultural products, an in-
terchange intrinsic to the establishment and
maintenance of a world community.
European is a tough one to answer. But we get some
clues from responses to questions we asked that bear
on specific policies and possibilities.
In Italy, for example, we found a residue of resentment
against America which dates back to World War II.
Fifty-six per cent of the Italians, or instance, made no
secret of the fact that they thought Allied bombardments
during the last war had been nothing more than useless
brutality, rather than military necessity.
We asked people directly whether they thought the U. S.
was doing everything it could do to prevent another
world war. As can be seen from the chart, large
majorities of the British, Swedes and Germans had no
doubt about the honesty of U. S. efforts to prevent war,
even though they may have some quarrel with U. S.
methods of prevention.
CHART)
U. S. EFFORTS TO PREVENT WAR
It is important to note that a fairly sizeable portion
of the Swedish population (26 per cent) was reluctant to
give the U. S. full credit for its war-prevention activities.
But it was only the Italians who were really doubtful
about our intentions. Few of them felt that we
Americans were really doing everything in our power
to avert a major war.
There were, therefore, groups of British, Frenchmen,
Germans, Italians and Swedes who in 1950 had doubts
about U. S. integrity, politically and morally. But the
majority in most cases took a more sympathetic view of
American foreign policy.
The idea of international co-operation meets with
fairly widespread approval from the British, Italians and
Swedes. In the 1950 survey, we found that about one-
half the population in each of these countries endorsed
the idea of a federation of West European nations. This
figure was somewhat lower in France, but sentiment in
favour of such an organization had increased between
Winter 1949 and the Spring of 1950.
As for the United Nations, as you can see from this
chart, just about the time the United Nations was
catapulted into the headlines as a result of developments
in Korea, the UN was a familiar name to many
Europeans.
CHART If
CONFIDENCE IN THE UN
Almost all the Swedes had heard of the UN ; and the
British public was also quite well informed. On the
other hand, one Frenchmen in three had never
even heard of the UN. And, I might add, the Italians
were similarly ignorant : About 40 per cent of the
Italian public had not heard of the UN or did not
know that Italy was not a member. (Italy does not
appear on the chart because Italians were not asked
about the UN's ability to prevent war).
People who had heard about the UN were asked
whether they thought the UN might be successful in
preserving peace. Only the Swedes had any great
confidence in the ability of the United Nations to avert
a war. The British were as a whole more optimistic than
pessimistic, but less so than the Swedes. And the
French were even less hopeful than the British.
In France and Sweden it was possible to compare
answers to this question before and after the outbreak of
hostilities in Korea since the field work was going on
just about that time. Perhaps understandably, it
appeared then that the war in Korea damped the hope
that the UN would be successful in keeping peace.
So far, the optimism of the Swedes has been justified.
Undoubtedly, feelings about the UN's ability to handle
delicate international situations will have undergone
several shifts as tensions eased and then tightened in
Korea during the months which have elapsed since this
survey was taken. But the figures do seem to show that
the Europeans were at least more often willing to give
the UN the benefit of the doubt than to feel that its
chances of success were doomed from the start.

### 71046: The Six letters on the gym locker

: OURIER APRIL 1952. Page 15
THE CHILDREN HELD THEIR OWN CONFERENCES
While the Third National Conference of the United States National Commission for Unesco
was being held in New York, high school students also got down to studying the programme
and aims of Unesco at two junior conferences organized by the New York Board of Education.
As a Unesco activity, the work of the National Conference itself came under discussion at
these junior meetings. Photos above show students in New York and other U. S. schools
debating such questions as the use of mass communications in Unesco's work and how the
reduction of racial as well as religious tensions can help to promote peace throughoutthe world.
THE boys and girls of a junior high school in Washington D. C. couldn't
understand it at a ! !. Everywhere they found the same six letters
staring them in the face. They were written on mirrors, chalked
on gym lockers, stuck on the library walls and in the corridors. Large
lettered posters proclaimed them from classroom notice boards. Red
arrows pointed to them in the washrooms.
Groups of the students stood before the letters asking each other"What's
it all about ?""What does U-N-E-S-C-O mean ?" Even when they asked
the teachers for an explanation, they drew a blank, for the latter just shook
their heads and pretended to be equally puzzled.
But not all the boys and girls of the Alice Deal Junior High School
were mystified. Some 40 or so students out of the total of well over a
thousand in the school went around trying bard not to look smug when
they heard the others asking"What's U-N-E-S-C-O ?" For these students
had been hard at work before the others arrived, putting up the letters,
signs and arrows where everyone would see them.
What may at first have seemed like a joke to the majority of the boys
and girls was in fact the first action in an educational scheme which this
single group had been secretly preparing for weeks past-a project
which originated in a suggestion by the United States National Commission
for Unesco that students might like to help them solve two problems.
For some time past, the Commission had been receiving the same two
queries from teachers and school officials :"What can we do to help
Unesco ?" ;"How can we bring Unesco into classroom activities ?"
Convinced that the best answers were to be found in the schools them-
selves, the Commission asked the principal of the Alice Deal Junior High
School and a member of her teaching staff to try to find out first if, nnd
then how Unesco could become a"living reality"to boys and girls in the
seventh, eighth and ninth grades.
From this idea that the boys and girls themselves might be best fitted
to work out a solution there grew a project which, conceived and carried
out by a class of 37 boys and girls, brought Unesco and its objectives into
clear focus in the minds of everyone in the school, and produced a blue-
print for an educational campaign suitable for other schools to adapt 10
their particular needs and resources.
This is how these boys and girls set about it. First of all, it was assumed
that the students as a whole knew nothing about Unesco. Miss Bertie
Backus, the school's principal and Mr. Leo M. Allman, a teacher of
English and Social Studies, therefore decided that the best approach was
through a small class of 11-to 14-year-old students.
The pupils began with a working committee of five youngsters who
gave up part of their holidays to attend meetings of the United States
National Commission for Unesco in Washington. This group returned
with a fund of information for the rest of the class when school began.
For more than a week during their English period the pupils discussed
Unesco and its aims, and supplemented these studies by"homework"
from materials gathered by another team. The teacher explained that
they were not being asked to solve problems concerning Unesco which
had stumped the experts, but that what the National Commission wanted
was a young people's angle. What were young people thinking about
Unesco ? What did they know of its programme ? In this way the class
became a workshop, with Unesco and the informational project forming a
regular part of the curriculum.
Then came the question"How are we to go about it ?""Write a
poem,"suggested one girl..'Paint a picture,"said the artist of the
section."Write a pamphlet,"said another. From then on the class
split into groups, each having a special job to do. One committee
worked out the draft of a pamphlet ; a second, composed for the most
part of students with art talent, prepared three different sets of posters
and a novel scheme for using them ; an Assembly Committee had a play
to introduce Unesco to the school ; a second assembly to conclude the
project was also planned ; a Committee on Music wrote a song with ori-
ginal words and melody.
Already at this point the interest and stimulation which the class had
obtained from the project had proved its worth in the opinion of the
teacher. Now, however, the class was ready to put its plan into action.
First it began to arouse the curiosity of the rest of the school. Without
any"xplanation the letters"U. ;'I/. E-S-C. O" appeared in every conceivable
place, in the building and in every size, shape and colour.
Then, these signs disappeared and a second series of posters asked the
question"What is Unesco ?" followed by placards asking in he frankly
facetious humour of the teenager.'Is it a heavenly constellation... ?""A
brand of cigarettes... ?""A new dance step... ?"
The next move was an assembly where, in a class-written script, the boys
and girls enacted the experiences of their own quest-how they them-
selves.'discovered"Unesco, how they decided to"pass the word along."
In the final scene the class talked directly to the audience :
"What is Unesco ?
"We did'nt find out until we started to write our pamphlet. Now we
can see that everyone has to know about it to make it succeed.
"At the end of our play we will announce an essay contest. The title
will be'What can I do to help Unesco ?'
"Our class will send speakers to your room to tell you about Unesco
and answer your questions."
For those who entered the essay contest, the class which organized the
information campaign offered the following services : It persuaded the
English teachers to make the essay a class project for each English class ;
it set up a library of materials on Unesco which it obtained from the
United States National Commission ; it compiled a pamphlet which gave
the background and the general goals of Unesco ; and finally, it set up
a Lecture Bureau and announced to the school that speakers would he
available to talk on Unesco and to answer questions in any of the classes.
An assembly at which the winners of the contest were announced and
prizes awarded brought the project to an end.
The students believe their plan can be used by other schools and that
it can be adapted to many other situations..'It is the best thing we did,"
they said,"because any school which carried out this plan or another
like it will accomplish what we set out to do."
Their teacher had this to say :"For the children we feel that this was
a wonderful educational experience. If we have anything to offer it is
the activity itself rather than any of its products. There is now not a
child at Alice Deal who does not know what Unesco stands for. And
their understanding of the necessity for greater tolerance and the easing
of racial and religious tensions as shown in the essays and pamphlets
they wrote is very gratifying."
Just how well such ideas went home to these children is perhaps best
illustrated by the words of a young girl, one of the contest prize winners.
In her essay, she wrote :"Stop before you say anything which might hurt
someone of a different race, colour or creed. Learn to be tolerant of
people. Did you ever stop think how queer your ways may seem to
someone else ?"
