Cuneiform ritual bucket
Fingers grip the handle of a bucket in this detail from a stone low-relief sculpture unearthed several
years ago at Nimrud (Iraq) by a team of Iraqi archaeologists. The sculpture is covered with cuneiform
inscriptions. At Nimrud, site of the rich and powerful city of Kalakh, capital of ancient Assyria, the
remains of royal palaces, huge statues of fabulous animals, paintings and an abundance of cuneiform
inscriptions reveal the splendour of a vanished civilization. Located 30 kms. south of Nineveh, Kalakh
was founded in the 9th cent. B.C. Assyrian sculptors embellished the city with numerous portraits
of their king, Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 B.C.) and depicted military and hunting exploits along with
scenes and objects from everyday life, such as this bucket used for ritual ablutions.

Research
has shown
that the human
brain is really
two brains in one,
each hemisphere
having its own
independent
functions
ORTY years ago, the great physi¬
ologist Ivan P. Pavlov came to
the conclusion that people could be
broadly divided into two types artists
and thinkers. Neurophysiologists have
recently discovered an anatomical
basis for this assertion.
One of the specific characteristics
of the human brain is what is known
as the functional specialization of its
two sides, the left and right cerebral
hemispheres. It has been discovered
in the last few years that the left
hemisphere of the brain controls
logical and abstract thinking, whereas
the right controls concrete and im¬
aginai thinking. The personality and
VADIM LVOVICH DEGLIN, eminent Soviet
neurophysiologist, is senior specialist in this
field at the I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutio¬
nary Physiology and Biochemistry of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, in Leningrad.
He is currently engaged in research on the
functional specialization ol the cerebral cortex.
Author of more than 40 scientific studies, he
has participated in many international confer¬
ences on problems concerning the physiology
of the nervous- system. A fuller version of this
article was presented as a paper to the inter¬
national meeting of experts organized by
Unesco in June 1975, in Varna (Bulgaria) on
the ethical problems posed by recent progress
in biology.

modes of perception of an individual
depend on which of his two cerebral
hemispheres is more developed
(whether as a result of inherited
characteristics or education).
Although the human brain is of
considerable size and weight, there
are animals with a larger and heavier
brain. The human brain is large in
relative terms, in other words the
brain is heavy in relation to the overall
body weight. But even in this respect
we are not superior to animals. Weight
for weight the cetácea (the family of
whales, dolphins and porpoises) have
even heavier brains.
Scientists have long assumed that
the area of the human cerebral cortex
was larger than that of animals, that it
contained more convolutions and that
its nerve cells were more numerous
and more densely distributed. How¬
ever, we now know that even accord¬
ing to these criteria we are inferior to
those legendary creatures, the dol¬
phins.
If neither size nor weight are the
distinguishing characteristics of the
human brain, what makes it unique?
Today there is only one characteristic
of the human brain which we can

THE GEOGRAPHY
AND FUNCTIONS
OF THE BRAIN
Drawing at right shows, on a
schematic cross-section view of the
brain, areas which control the major
activities of the human body.
Drawings far right, on opposite page,
show the interior of the right
hemisphere of the brain and the
exterior of the left hemisphere. The
two halves, interconnected by a
bundle of nerve fibres known as the
corpus callosum, are identical in
structure but not in function. A
number of crucial responsibilities are
divided between them, thus giving
specific functions to one hemisphere
rather than to the other. Note that the
motor and receptive areas for language
(Areas of Wernicke and Broca) are
both located In the cortex of the left
hemisphere. Curves, folds and furrows
outline the main areas of the brain,
known as lobes, each of which is
responsible for various functions.
The parietal lobe, for example,
contains the areas responsible for
sensory inputs and motor responses.
The frontal and temporal lobes are the
centres of higher mental functions
such as language, memory, knowledge
and decision making.
, regard as unique, namely its functional
asymmetry.
The brain of all animals and of man
himself is symmetrical. Its right and
left halves are constructed identically.
In animals, the right and left halves of
the brain perform the same work. In
man, however, the right and left
cerebral hemispheres have different
functions and govern different types of
activity. It has long been known that
damage to the cerebral cortex (caused
by haemorrhages, traumas, tumours,
etc.) may result in total or partial loss
of speech a condition known as
aphasia. However, hardly more than
a century ago, it was proved that only
damage to the left hemisphere leads
to aphasia.
In the second half of the 19th
century and the early 20th century,
intensive research was carried out in
neurological clinics on deficiencies in
the complex activity of the brain
caused by damage to one or other
of the cerebral hemispheres. As often
happens, a mass of reliable facts was
interlarded with data selected in order
to support preconceived notions and
theories. Consequently, neurologists
associated not only speech with the
activity of the left hemisphere but also
all the higher functions of the nervous
system the intellect and complex
forms of perception and activity. The
left hemisphere therefore became
known .as the "major" or "dominant"
hemisphere.
The right hemisphere was regarded
as secondary and as subordinate to
the left. It became known as the
"minor" or "subdominant" hemisphere.
It was referred to in neuropathology
textbooks as the "mute" hemisphere,
for it was not known what symptoms
could be relied on in diagnosing a
lesion affecting it.
Until the mid-20th century, the
functional asymmetry of the brain was
of interest primarily to neuropathol¬
ogists endeavouring to find ways of
accurately identifying localized damage
to the brain. The detailed study of
lesions in the left hemisphere was
paralleled by intensive research on the
symptoms of lesions in the "mute"
right hemisphere.
Finally, in the early 1950s, came a
major breakthrough with the discovery
of functions which belong exclusively
to the right hemisphere. A series of
remarkable studies on the independent
functions of each hemisphere was
carried out by Dr. Roger Sperry and a
research team working at the Univer¬
sity of Chicago and later at the Califor¬
nia Institute of Technology. It became
clear that the right hemisphere
must not be regarded merely as an
adjunct to the leftf hemisphere, and
that it makes its own substantial contri¬
bution to nervous activity.

The result was a break with the
traditional approach. The idea that
one hemisphere was dominant was
replaced" by the notion that each
hemisphere ,..has its own specialized
tasks and functions. At the same
time, the problem of the brain's
asymmetry ceased to be the sole
province of neuropathologists and
attracted the attention of physiologists,
psychologists, specialists in the phy¬
siology of growth and even social
scientists. Today, functional asym¬
metry is emerging as perhaps the
main scientific problem in connexion
with the human brain.
The earliest source of information
on the specialization of the brain's
two hemispheres was provided by
observations of patients suffering
from localized damage in the right or
left hemisphere. This traditional clini¬
cal method of research continues to
yield new facts.
The development of neurosurgery
has paved the way for new methods
and techniques in the study of the
functional specialization of the hemi¬
spheres. In order to establish the
limits of a brain lesion, surgeons
sometimes stimulate .the brain by
means of a mild electric shock during
the operation. As many brain oper¬
ations are carried out under local
anaesthetic the doctor (who needs to
know about the condition of the
patient at particular stages in the
operation) speaks to the patient and is
able to find out what he feels when
the various portions of the hemisphere
being operated on are stimulated in
this way.
When patients are being prepared
for a brain operation it is sometimes
necessary to carry out a special test:
a soporific drug is injected into
the carotid artery supplying blood to
one or other of the hemispheres. The
hemisphere which is temporarily "put
to sleep" in this way ceases to
function, and all the complex forms
of nervous activity are carried out
only by the other hemisphere.
Although the hemisphere is "asleep"
only for a minute or so, this has been
long enough to provide fresh infor¬
mation on the functions of the right
and left hemispheres.
Nevertheless, the operation, the
electric shock and the test using the
soporific drug are generally confined
to one hemisphere only. There is
therefore no way of comparing the
function of. the right and left hemi¬
spheres in one and the same person.
However, a few years ago, a kind of
new operation was devised whereby
all the nerve fibres linking the two
hemispheres were cut.
This operation, which is known as v
commissurotomy, is performed when r
7

### 49417: Our split brain

k it is essential to prevent the spread
of a pathogenic condition from one
hemisphere to the other. After the
operation the two hemispheres begin
to function independently. Although
commissurotomy patients differ little
from healthy persons it is possible, in
the course of treating such patients,
to discover what are the specialized
abilities of each hemisphere in iso¬
lation. However, as commissurotomy
is a very rare operation, it offers only
limited scope for such observation.
Experimental procedures, known as
"dichotic tests", have now been
developed to provide a means of
studying the functional specialization
of the hemispheres in healthy subjects.
These tests are based on the
peculiarities of the brain's structure.
It is known that the right ear and the
right field of vision are linked more
strongly with the left hemisphere, and
the left ear and the left field of vision
with the right hemisphere. If different
material is simultaneously presented
to the right and left sensory organs,
the two hemispheres compete with
each other and we can draw
conclusions about the specialized
functions of each hemisphere from the
way it perceives things.
Here is a specific example. By
using a special apparatus it is
possible momentarily to present
different letters to the right and left
fields of vision simultaneously. It
emerges that only the letters shown
to the right hand side of vision are
recognized. If geometrical figures are
presented in a similar way they are
recognized only in the left field of.
vision.
Scientists now have a fairly impress¬
ive array of procedures and methods
for the study of functional asymmetry.
Some of them have stood the test of
time whereas others have been
developed only recently. One such
method is connected with the form of
treatment known as electro-shock
therapy.
The use of electric shock in
treating mental illnesses became part
of psychiatric practice some forty
years ago when the possible forms of
treatment available to psychiatrists
, were extremely limited. Doctors who
had previously been powerless to do
anything about severe nervous dis¬
orders found that this afforded an
effective means of treatment. Mental
diseases which had been regarded as
hopeless and as leading inexorably
to chronic insanity turned, out to be
curable. Psychiatrists now have at
their disposal a wide range of effective
therapeutic drugs, but, even today,
there are certain mental illnesses
which respond only to electro-shock
therapy.
BRAINY HANDS
A series of experiments carried out recently in North America
tend to show that the left hemisphere of the brain (which in
most people governs speech) also has a special control over the
expressive, free-moving gestures people often make when
they speak. Persons whose speech is controlled by the left
hemisphere gesture primarily with the right hand, like the woman
shown in this sequence of film stills taken during an experiment
by a Canadian psychologist, Doreen Kimura. (If speech is
controlled by the right hemisphere, the left hand makes more
of the accompanying gestures.)
In this treatment, electrodes are
attached to the patient's head and a
precisely calculated electric current is
induced, thereby producing a state of
shock which lasts for a minute. For
some time after the shock patients
are unconscious and their brain ac¬
tivity is depressed. But in the course
of one or two hours this cerebral
depression wears off and the patient
regains full consciousness. A course
of treatment comprises between eight
and twelve shocks. The therapeutic
effect generally appears after three
to five shocks have been given and
gradually increases.
In order to induce the electric
shock, the electrodes are generally
placed on either side of the brain.
However, a few years ago, a British
psychiatrist, Stanley Cannicott, sug¬
gested that the electrodes be placed
only on the right hand side of the
brain; subsequently shocks were giv¬
en from electrodes placed on the left
side. These unilateral shocks, like the
traditional bilateral shocks, have great
curative powers but they are less vio¬
lent and are more readily tolerated by
patients.
Since 1967, the staff of the psychia¬
tric clinic of the I.M. Sechenov Institute
of Evolutionary Physiology and Bio¬
chemistry of the U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences have been carrying out a
study of unilateral electric shocks.
Over the last seven years electro-
shock treatment has been given to a
large number of patients in this clinic
and we are convinced of its great
efficacity.
Our observations have shown that
a unilateral shock does not depress
the entire brain but only the hemi
sphere above which the electrodes
have been placed. The other hemi¬
sphere remains active. Although it is
something of an over-simplification, it
may be said that after a unilateral
shock the patient feels, behaves and
thinks only with the active hemisphere.
Electro-encephalograms recorded af¬
ter the shocks reveal a striking picture:
one hemisphere is "asleep" whereas
the other remains active and can be
described as being "awake".
By placing the electrodes alter¬
nately on the right and left of the
patient's head during successive treat¬
ment sessions, it is possible, in effect,
to "switch off" either the right or the
left hemisphere of the same person's
brain. One is thus able to compare
a person's normal behaviour with his
behaviour when only one hemisphere
is active and to observe changes in
his behaviour after one hemisphere has
been made inactive. In this way, uni¬
lateral electric shocks, the primary
function of which is therapeutic, inci¬
dentally provide scientists with evi¬
dence of the fundamental functional
specialization of each of the cerebral
hemispheres.
. The best way to sum up the facts
which have been established is to give
an overall description of a person in
whom only one hemisphere is func¬
tioning. It must be pointed out, how¬
ever, that our "one hemisphere" person
is an invention. He is a collective syn¬
thesis of observations and research
bearing on a large number of patients
who have undergone electric shock
treatment. One further word of warn¬
ing: everything which follows applies
to right-handed people; for left-handers
all the facts are reversed.

OUR SPLIT BRAIN
I Left hemisphere :
speech, writing and abstract thinking
THE "left hemisphere" person is
someone whose right hemi¬
sphere is inoperative and whose
mental activity involves only the left
hemisphere.
The first and most important charac¬
teristic of the "left hemisphere" person
is that he retains the power of speech.
This is hardly surprising since the
faculty of speech is governed by the
left hemisphere. What is surprising is
the fact that such a person is more
willing and ready to engage in conver¬
sation and takes the initiative in dis¬
cussion. His vocabulary becomes
richer and more varied and his answers
more extensive and detailed. He is
excessively talkative and even garru¬
lous. At the same time he is more
receptive to what other people say.
In order to test speech perception a
technique known as speech audiometry
is used. Specially selected groups of
words recorded on magnetic tape are
played to the patient through head¬
phones to each ear independently. ;
First of all the threshold of speech
awareness is measured, in other words
the minimum intensity of the speech
signal at which a person can hear
speech sounds but is unable to identify
the words. The volume is then gradu¬
ally increased and the person is asked
to repeat the words he hears. A
measurement is made of his speech-
acuity the number of correctly re¬
peated words expressed as a per¬
centage of the total.
The "left hemisphere" person has a
lower threshold of awareness of
speech sounds, that Is to say he per¬
ceives quieter speech sounds than
when both his brain hemispheres are
working normally. He repeats the
words he hears more quickly and with
far greater accuracy. Generally, the
"left hemisphere" person has a higher
degree of speech activity and hears
speech more easily.
Do these facts justify the assertion
that speech activity is improved if the
right hemisphere is inoperative? If one
listens attentively to the "left hemi¬
sphere" person one observes that,
although he has become more talka¬
tive, his intonation is less expressive;
it is monotonous, colourless and
dull. Moreover, not only is his vocal
expressiveness reduced but the voice
itself changes: it acquires a kind of
nasal twang or becomes unnatural, as
though the subject were barking. This
speech defect is known as dysprosody,
the intonation and vocal components
of speech being known as prosodie
elements.
In addition to the "left hemisphere"
person's dysprosody, his perception
10
. of prosodie elements in the speech of
a .person addressing him is also
defective.
Two series of experiments have
been made in this connexion. In the
first, a person was presented with
short phrases played through head¬
phones and composed of nonsense
syllables pronounced with exaggerated
intonation interrogative, angry, plain¬
tive, enthusiastic, etc. The person
had to specify the meaning of the
intonation and define the kind of ex¬
pression with which the phrase was
uttered. In the second series of
experiments the person, again through
headphones, was presented with vowel
sounds uttered by a man and by a
woman. He had to repeat the sound
and say whether the voice was male
or female.
It was shown that the "left hemi¬
sphere" person loses the ability to
understand the meaning of speech
intonations. He listens attentively,
tries to make sense of the nonsense
syllables and repeats them with great
accuracy. But he is unable either to
identify the tone of voice (interrogative,
angry, etc.) or to distinguish between
a male and a female voice.
Everyone is aware that the same
words uttered with a different inton¬
ation can mean very different things.
Similarly, the same words uttered by
different people (i.e. in different voices)
can have a completely different mean¬
ing. The way in which one says some¬
thing is often more significant than the
actual words used. Prosodie compo¬
nents give the spoken word a' specific
reference, an expressiveness and an
affective colouring. If the spoken
word is deprived of such components
it sounds vague, formal and often
incomprehensible.
Thus, although the content of the
"left hemisphere" person's speech is
rich in formal terms, both lexically and
grammatically, and although his
speech activity increases and his
hearing for words becomes more
acute, he speaks without intonatlonal
or vocal expressiveness and what he
says is therefore less graphic and
specific.
This confronts us with a paradoxical
situation: certain aspects and charac¬
teristics of his hearing for speech im¬
prove while others deteriorate. What
has happened to his hearing? Has a
change occurred only in his perception
of speech sounds or has his general
faculty of hearing been affected? Let
us consider how a "left hemisphere"
person perceives sound ¡mages other
than speech.
Tape-recordings were made of
coughing, laughter and snoring, of the
sounds of natural phenomena such as
a thunderstorm and the roar of surf
breaking and also of industrial and
vehicle noises.
The "left hemisphere" person's
perception of such sound images is
seriously impaired and he is completely
baffled by many familiar noises. In
cases where he does manage to recog¬
nize them he requires a great deal
more time in order to identify them.
In fact the "left hemisphere" person
develops auditory agnosia the impair¬
ed perception of complex sounds. A
similar disturbance can be demonstrat¬
ed with regard to musical images.
The "left hemisphere" person not
only ceases to recognize well-known
tunes but is unable to hum them even
If he hears the music: he begins to
hum wrong notes and ultimately prefers
to tap out the rhythm without the
melody.
As he is unable to identify speech
images, the "left hemisphere" person
endeavours to overcome his difficulty
by the highly original expedient of
classifying them. Instead of saying:
"that's a dog barking" or "that's some¬
one laughing", etc., he says: "that's an
animal", "that's a person", or "that's
a folk-song". As a rule he is mistaken
but the very effort to classify and sche¬
matize is in itself symptomatic. As we
shall see later, this tendency' is cer¬
tainly not fortuitous.
How should one treat the findings
of research on the perception of sound
images? Perhaps the l "left hemi¬
sphere" person simply forgets familiar
sounds whereas his perception re¬
mains unimpaired. This hypothesis
can be verified.
Tape-recordings were made of pairs
of short musical phrases, each phrase
consisting of four notes. In some of
the pairs the phrases were identical
whereas in others they differed slight¬
ly. The subject was asked to state
whether the paired phrases were ident¬
ical or not. This test provides a
means of studying the ability to distin¬
guish between closely similar musical
patterns. There is no need for the
subject to recall what he previously
knew. This test is performed less well
by the "left hemisphere" person than
by the "two-hemisphere" person.
The "left hemisphere" person is
practically incapable of observing vari¬
ations and everything sounds alike to
him. Thus, it is not a matter of mem¬
ory impairment but of the specific
characteristics of auditory perception.
How is this to be accounted for?
Perhaps there has been some general
change in the sensitivity of his hearing.
Such is not the case. The acuity of his

MONITORING
THE BRAIN
AT WORK
Recent developments in
electronics have provided
new tools for exploring the .
brain in minute detail.
The electroencephalograph, an
instrument long used to
amplify and record the brain's
electrical impulses, has now
been developed into a
phenomenally sensitive device.
Its electrodes, placed at
different points on the scalp,
as in the case of the prema¬
turely-born baby seen in photo
at left, record electric cur¬
rents at selected areas in
the brain. Below left,

Different areas of the brain
are revealed as "hot" or "cold"

hearing remains as it was when both
halves of his brain were working.
However, let us remember all the
auditory deficiencies of the "left hemi¬
sphere" person, his difficulty in identi¬
fying musical and other sound patterns,
his difficulty in distinguishing between
male and female voices, his complete
failure to comprehend intonation. In
other words, every aspect of his ima¬
ginai perception of sounds has been
impaired. There can be no doubt that
we are here faced by a special situ¬
ation, a selective and specialized im¬
pairment of imaginai perception (as has
been stated, his perception of words
themselves was actually improved).
A deficiency in imaginai perception-
may also be observed with regard to
vision. If a "left hemisphere" person
is asked to select pairs of identical
geometrical figures such as triangles
and squares divided into coloured or
striped sectors, he is unable to perform
the task as he cannot at the same time
grasp the distribution of the sectors,
their colour and their stripes.
He continually sorts through the
figures, frequently comparing them, but
he is unable to pair them off correctly.
He is also unable to observe a missing
detail in uncompleted pictures: the fact
that a pig has no tail or that spectacles
have no ear-pieces, etc. Thus the
"left hemisphere" person is totally
unable to perform tasks in, which he
needs to grasp or recognize the speci¬
fic imaginai characteristics of objects
presented to his field of vision.
Situations in which the "left hemi¬
sphere" person is free to use his own
judgement in choosing whether to apply
visual or abstract criteria are of parti¬
cular interest.
Four cards were presented to such
a person. On one card was written
the Arabic numeral 5 and on another
the same digit in the form of a Roman
numeral (V). On the third card was the
Arabic numeral 10 and on the fourth
the same digit in the form of a Roman
numeral (X). He was asked to divide
these cards into two groups of
"similar" cards.
It is evident that this op¬
eration may be made on the basis
of the abstract numerical sign (in which
case the two fives and the two tens
will be in separate groups) or by the
external appearance of the symbol
(in which case the Arabic numerals
will be in one group and the Roman
numerals In the other).
In his normal state, a person is
usually in some doubt and points out
that there are two equally plausible
methods of classification. The "left
hemisphere" person unhesitatingly
chooses the abstract symbol, placing
the fives in one group and the tens
in another.
What has been said above makes
it clear that the mental activity of the
"left hemisphere" person is stratified.
His imaginai perception is defective
whereas his verbal perception is im¬
proved. His handling of objects in
terms of their visual, external appear¬
ance is defective but his handling of
concepts is improved.
This stratification also emerges in
studies on memory. The "left hemi¬
sphere" person retains the theoreti¬
cal knowledge which he learnt at
school; in other words his knowledge
obtained through the medium of words
remains unaffected. He also retains
the capacity to memorize new verbal
material and, as soon as he has heard
a series of words, he is capable of
repeating them.
He is also capable of remembering
them for a considerable period and
two or three hours later, by which
time he has returned to his normal
state, he is capable of picking out
from a large number of other words
those which he had previously been
given to memorize. However, if a
"left hemisphere" person is asked to
commit to memory not verbal material
but irregularly shaped figures to which
¡t is impossible to attach a descriptive
word, he is incapable of doing so.
There is another important feature
of the behaviour and mental activity
of such a person, namely his grasp
or, as neurophysiologists say, his
comprehension of his surroundings,
his orientation in space and time. If
one judges merely by the answers
given by "left hemisphere" people,
they appear to be well oriented. Such
a person correctly names the hos¬
pital he is in, the number of the ward,
the date and the day of the week.
But if one questions him
more closely it becomes clear
that although he has made
a correct verbal statement of
his whereabouts and knows that he
is in a hospital, the "left hemisphere"
person does not recognize specific,
rooms. He looks In bewilderment at
the consulting room to which he has
been a frequent visitor and says he
has never been there before. Or,
although he has given the date cor¬
rectly, he is unable to confirm his
answer by practical observations.
Sometimes the "left hemisphere"
person even looks out of the window
at the leafless trees and the snow¬
drifts and is unable to say immedi¬
ately whether it is winter outside or
summer. Indeed, if he answers that
"January is a winter month" this is
merely a formal inference and not a
result of direct visual impression.
Thus, although the verbal orientation
of the "left hemisphere" person is
unimpaired, his visual orientation in
space and time is seriously disturbed.
One of the most striking mental
changes in the "left hemisphere" per¬
son concerns his emotional outlook.
The attitude of mind of such a person
improves, he becomes more easy¬
going, sociable and cheerful. This
transformation is particularly striking
in the case of depressive patients,
that is to say those who have a
pathologically low morale.
"Left hemisphere" patients lose
their characteristic moroseness and
low spirits. Instead of being preoc¬
cupied with their own symptoms, they
become interested in topics uncon¬
nected with their illness. They begin
to take an optimistic view of their own
situation, believe they will be cured,
and regard the future as an encour¬
aging prospect.
Let us sum up what we have learnt
about the mental process of the "left
hemisphere" person. What defects
has such a person? What faculties
have been retained or enhanced?
A deterioration has occurred in
those aspects of his mental activity
which underlie imaginai thinking. Those
aspects of his mental activity which un¬
derlie abstract, conceptual thinking
have been retained and even improved.
This stratification of the psyche is ac¬
companied by an optimistic emotional
outlook.
LANDMARK IN BRAIN RESEARCH
The left and right hemispheres of the human brain are each responsible
for specific functions and are interconnected by nerve fibres (primarily
the corpus callosum) so that they work together. New and convincing
proof of the specialization of each hemisphere was provided about
15 years ago by the research of leading American neurologists such as
Roger W. Sperry, Joseph E. Bogen and Michael S. Gazzaniga. Their
work was a major breakthrough in the history of brain research.
Following operations which "disconnected" the two hemispheres (in
patients suffering from epilepsy which other treatment had failed to
relieve) it became possible to observe the functioning of each
hemisphere separately and thus to verify the specific mental functions
of each half of our brain. Diagram (right) shows how visual .messages
are transmitted to a brain whose two hemispheres have been
disconnected. If the word "Taxi" is flashed on the right side of a screen
placed before a person being tested, the image of this word goes to the
left hemisphere of the brain. It was found that a patient could "read"
and give a correct verbal description of Images received in the left
hemisphere, the one that controls speech. He could not describe an
image received in the right hemisphere, in this case a key, because the
right hemisphere does not control speech. He could, however,
recognize the key among other objects and pick it up with his left hand.
Drawing also shows that movements of the right hand are controlled
by the left brain hemisphere and vice versa. Other major specialized
functions are shown In the hemispheres that govern them.

OUR SPLIT BRAIN
I
LET us now consider the antith¬
esis of the "left hemisphere"
person, namely the "right hemisphere"
person. He is the same individual but,
in this case, his left hemisphere is
"switched off" and only the . right
hemisphere is operating.
Unlike the "left hemisphere" person,
the "right hemisphere" person has a
sharply diminished capacity for
speech. His vocabulary is impover¬
ished and does not include words de¬
noting abstract concepts. He has
difficulty in recalling the names of
objects, especially those which are
infrequently used, although he is cap¬
able of explaining the purpose of
any object and of showing how it is
used. This shows that he recognizes
such objects.
His comprehension of speech is poor
and it is necessary to speak to him in
very short and simply constructed sen¬
tences. His own speech is also made
up of simple sentences and often of
isolated words.
The speech activity of the "right
hemisphere" person is much reduced.
He is taciturn and, instead of answer¬
ing questions in words, he prefers to
Right hemisphere: non-verbal memory,
emotions and concrete thinking
respond by mime or gestures. It is
difficult to converse with him, and he
becomes silent after briefly answering
one or two questions. His attentive-
ness to speech is also reduced.
The "right hemisphere" person's
threshold of awareness of speech
sounds is high. He is aware only of
loud words. But even words which
are uttered fairly loudly he is often
unable to take in and repeat, although
this falling-off in his sensitivity to
speech sounds has nothing to do with
any impairment in his hearing.
At the same time, the voice of the
"right hemisphere" person remains as
it was before : although he is very
uncommunicative the intonation pat¬
tern of his voice remains unaltered.
Nor has his hearing of the
prosodie elements In speech been
affected : the "right hemisphere" per¬
son can distinguish between male and
female voices even better than before
and is more subtle and accurate in
interpreting voice intonations.
Although the "right hemisphere"
person is less attentive to words, he
is both attentive and active in listen¬
ing to various non-verbal sounds. He
recognizes such sounds even more
easily and quickly than when both hal¬
ves of his brain are working, whereas
the sound of surf breaking on the
shore, for example, is not often recog¬
nized by people in the normal state
and then only with great difficulty.
Listening to the tunes of songs, the
"right hemisphere" person recognizes
them much more quickly than usual.
Moreover, he feels an urge to hum
them without even being asked to do
so. In contrast with his own perform¬
ance when only his left hemisphere was
operative, he can now reproduce tunes
accurately, but cannot classify sound
patterns.
This indicates that the "right hemi¬
sphere" person's perception has been
restructured and is now the opposite
of what was observed in the "left
hemisphere" person. The "right hemis¬
phere" person shows a deterioration
in verbal perception and a selective
improvement in all aspects of imaginai
perception.
This observation is confirmed by
other research. The "right hemisphere"
person has no difficulty in selec-
ting pairs of triangles and squares^
Corpus callosum
LEFT HAND, RIGHT HAND
Drawings below illustrate the different capacities of the
brain's two hemispheres. They were done by a patient
whose left hemisphere had been separated from his right.
He was asked to copy the cross and cube (centre) first with
his left hand, then with his right hand. Although the
patient was actually right-handed, he did a far better job
with his left hand (controlled by the brain's right hemisphere,
which excels at space perception) than with his right
hand (governed by the spatially inept left hemisphere).

divided into striped or coloured sec¬
tors and he picks them out more
rapidly than in his normal state. He
experiences no difficulty in evaluating
unfinished drawings and quickly points
out what has been omitted. The
"right hemisphere" person's greater
capacity for imaginai perception stands
out particularly clearly ¡n situations
in which he is free to select symbols.
In classifying four cards bearing
Arabic and Roman numerals, he selects
the numbers by their visual appearance
rather than by their abstract numerical
values, putting the Roman numerals
into one group and the Arabic numerals
into the other. He recognizes all the
numerals but in classifying them he is
guided by the system of notation rather
than the meaning of the numerals.
The memory of the "right hemis¬
phere" person acquires characteristics
which are the opposite of those observ¬
ed in the "left hemisphere" person. The
theoretical knowledge he acquired in
school through the medium of words is
largely lost and his ability to memorize
words is also impaired.
He is not able to repeat Immediately
after hearing them a series of several
words and is able, at best, to repeat
two or three such words out of ten.
Even if he is able to retain these words
in his memory for a certain period of
time he forgets them within two hours
and cannot pick them out from among
other words. At the same time his
imaginai, non-verbal memory is unim¬
paired and he is capable of memorizing
oddly shaped figures and of picking
them out several hours later from nu¬
merous other figures.
The time and space orientation of
the "right hemisphere" person is also
affected but in a different way from
that observed in the "left hemisphere"
person. Judging by his answers, he
appears completely disoriented, not
knowing where he is, nor the date nor
even the year.
However, he notices details of his
surroundings and on the basis of his
observations is able to say that he is
probably in a hospital, without knowing
which one. He recognizes the consult¬
ing-room in which he is sitting although
he cannot say what its purpose is.
Although he is unable to name either
the month or the year he can tell what
time of year it is by looking out of the
window and says approximately what
the month is. Thus, although the
"right hemisphere" person has no ver¬
bal orientation his visual and practical
orientation is retained.
Just as the "left hemisphere" person
underwent a change of mood, so the
"right hemisphere" person undergoes
an emotional transformation in the
opposite direction, towards negative
emotions. His spirits decline, he be¬
comes morose and is pessimistic about
his present situation and his future
prospects and complains of feeling
unwell.
Let us sum up what we have dis¬
covered about the "right hemisphere"
person. It is evident that here again
we are faced with a disorganized
psyche but the disorganization differs
from what we observed in the "left
hemisphere" person.
The "right hemisphere" person mani¬
fests an impairment in those aspects
of mental activity which are the basis
of abstract, conceptual thinking while
those aspects linked with imaginai
thinking have been retained and even
improved. This type of stratification
of the psyche is accompanied by a
negative emotional outlook.

H Artist' and 'thinker':
two hemispheres in competition
WE have now made the ac¬
quaintance of two people
who differ widely in their psychic
make-up : the "left hemisphere" per¬
son whose thinking is highly abstract
but whose imaginai thinking is defec¬
tive and the "right hemisphere" per¬
son who has a highly imaginai mode
of thought but who is defective with
regard to abstract thought.
However, these two are the same
person, the only difference being that
in the first case his right hemisphere
has been inactivated and he thinks
and feels exclusively with the left he¬
misphere, and in the second instance
the opposite is the case.
We are now in a position to draw a
firm conclusion: there is a definite
principle behind the functional asym¬
metry of the brain, namely that the
14
left hemisphere governs logical and
abstract thinking, whereas the right
hemisphere governs concrete and
imaginai thinking. Apparently, each
hemisphere, each apparatus, has its
own set of instruments: its own speech,
memory and emotional tone.
Let us compare the instruments in
each of the two hemispheres.
As has already been stated, the
breakthrough in our understanding of
the functional asymmetry of the human
brain was the discovery of the ex¬
ceptional importance of the left
hemisphere in speech activity. Even
today, research workers use the
terms "left hemisphere" and "speech
hemisphere" as synonymous. However,
study of the "single hemisphere" per¬
son shows the truth is more complex.

k volving both the formation and per-
' ceptlon of words is entirely depen¬
dent on the activity of the left hemis¬
phere. The reason for this is obvious:
a system of words is a system of sym¬
bols and generalizations superimposed
on immediately perceptible individual
phenomena. A capacity for abstract,
theoretical thinking can only be based
on such a system of symbols or, to
use the now accepted phrase, on the
basis of a system of signs.
But speech also comprises a non¬
verbal means of communication and
information, namely intonation and
tone of voice. And the intonation one
gives to one's own speech, like one's
perception of the intonations used by
others, are both governed by the right
hemisphere. Only within a system of
intonations do words or phrases ac¬
quire a specific meaning which is ap¬
propriate to a given moment and given
circumstances. In the same way the
voice itself is an individual charac¬
teristic of speech.
The meaning of what is being com¬
municated also depends on whether the
communication comes from a man or
a woman, an acquaintance or a stran¬
ger, a friend or an enemy. This being
so, the connexion between the intona-
tional and vocal components of speech
and the right hemisphere is also easy
to understand: the right hemisphere
controls the world of specific, indivi¬
dual phenomena.
The intonational and vocal aspect
of speech is essentially a melodic and
musical one. But we already know
that musical aptitudes are also con¬
trolled by the right hemisphere and
it follows that in terms of their origin
too the prosodie (melodic) charac¬
teristics of speech are linked with the
activity of the right hemisphere.
In evolutionary terms, "right hemis¬
phere" speech is of greater antiquity
than "left hemisphere" speech.
Highly organized animals living in
herds transmit the danger signal and
other signals to each other vocally
by means of changes in intonation.
The great antiquity of this communi¬
cation channel emerges also in the
study of speech formation in children.
It is a biological law that the physical
development of the individual organism
(ontogenesis) repeats on a brief time
scale the evolutionary development of
the animal world (phylogenesis).
The sequence in which functions
come into existence in ontogenesis is
therefore a clue to the evolutionary
age of these functions. Research has
shown that intonations which are
characteristic of adults are present in
the cooing and babbling of infants long
before they have learnt to speak. It
is also known that the child begins
to understand intonations earlier than
words.
It is thus necessary to draw a dis¬
tinction between two channels of com¬
munication in human speech: verbal
communication which is a purely hu¬
man characteristic and which is young

### 49423: The Hungry brain: a baby's brain can be irreparably damaged because of the chronic malnutrition of its mother

by Elie A. Shneour
THE HUNGRY
BRAIN
A baby's brain can be irreparably
damaged because of the chronic
malnutrition of its mother
THE growth of the human brain
during gestation is one of the
earliest, most rapid and most extensive
developments of the whole organism.
The mature human brain contains
about 11 billion nerve cells embedded
in a matrix of "housekeeping" cells,
the neuroglia, whose number exceeds
100 billion. It is these nerve cells
which perform the functions we asso¬
ciate with intelligence, consciousness,
memory, biological control and inte¬
gration. Nerve-cell proliferation is
complete at birth, and none of these
cells are replaced thereafter.
One of the earliest recognizable
primordial tissues in the human embryo
is the neural plate, the first evidence
of brain development, which appears
by the 18th day of pregnancy. This
means that to generate the required
11 billion nerve cells by the end of
gestation requires the production and
differentiation of an average of 20,000
nerve cells per minute during this
period.
After birth the brain continues to
grow at a much faster rate than the rest
of the body, so much so that by the
time a child is four years old his brain
has reached 90 per cent of its adult
weight, while the rest of his body has
barely made it to the 20 mark. During
this critical period of rapid growth,
much more than just an increase in
weight is involved. The structures

lives. Their offspring exhibited the
classic evidence of malnutrition, includ¬
ing a reduction in brain-cell numbers.
This work supports the finding of
Drs. J. J. Cowley and R. D. Griesel in
South Africa that the effect of prenatal
malnutrition on rat mental development
could affect growth and development
into the second generation. Thus mal¬
nutrition, an environmental influence,
can produce effects very similar to
those of hereditary origin. These
experiments were carried out mainly
with animals rather than human beings
for obvious reasons, but there is ample
clinical evidence available to suggest
that the conclusions are equally
applicable to human children.
Dr. J. A. Churchill of Wayne State
University at Detroit (U.S.A.) examined
black pregnant women in poor families
and their children and was able to
observe a definite relationship between
the amounts of amino acids in the
mother's blood streams during preg¬
nancy and the birth weights and skull
volumes of their offspring.
Mothers who had a low level
of these substances in their blood¬
streams as a result of a protein-defi¬
cient diet bore children who weighed
less and had significantly smaller
skulls than those of mothers whose
blood had a higher level of amino
acids. Since the duration of pregnan¬
cies was about the same for all women
tested, premature births played no
role in these results.
The relationship between low birth
weight and mental retardation had
been known for a long time, but the
interpretation usually given was that
premature birth was an important
cause of mental retardation. This kind
of explanation, while probably valid in
part, obscured the effect of malnutri¬
tion on subsequent mental retardation.
In fact, a number of investigators
showed that some of the most severely
mentally retarded children were the
least premature.
Dr. L. C. Eaves of the University of
British Columbia (Canada) reported
on the I.Q. (Intelligence Quotient) test
scores of children with a low birth
weight. The results of this 18-month
study with 502 children showed that
those with low birth weight consistently
scored lower than normal children.
Social and economic status played an
important role in these I.Q. deficiencies
and became even more significant with
increasing age.
Hunger and malnutrition play a vital
role in the growth of the human
brain. It is now recognized that the
child of a chronically malnourished
mother may suffer irremediable brain
damage. Malnutrition in early life
also impedes the maturation of the
brain and jeopardizes its later
development. More than 350 million
children in the world today suffer
from the effects of malnutrition. It is
almost impossible to calculate what
this may mean in terms of brain
damage and mental retardation.
At six months of age the I.Q. differ¬
ence between normal and malnou¬
rished children was only 5 points. The
spread increased to 17 points by age
4. However, when the low-birth-weight
children were contrasted with normal
children of comparable social and
economic background, the normal chil¬
dren still performed significantly better
on these tests than did their birth-
weight-deficient counterparts.
This observation, confirmed by other
investigators, is of capital importance.
It suggests that social and economic
status alone does not account for dif¬
ferences in the I.Q. test performance
of these children, and that the prenatal
environment must therefore have

### 49423: The Hungry brain: a baby's brain can be irreparably damaged because of the chronic malnutrition of its mother

THE FIRST 4 MONTHS
OF LIFE BEFORE BIRTH
The remarkable photos on these two pages
show three stages in the development of
a child before its birth.
1. Eleven weeks after conception the foetus
floats buoyantly inside a membrane filled
with a salty solution. The foetus is linked by
an umbilical cord to the placenta. Tne
placenta is a temporary organ in which the
blood vessels of foetus and mother come
together without joining. Through these
vessels, in which as much as 300 litres
of blood circulate daily, food, oxygen,
hormones and waste products are exchanged
between mother and foetus, thus providing
vital nutrients for developing bone structures,
the nervous system and brain tissue.
2. By the 16th week the foetus has doubled
in size. It is now about 13 cm. long and is
clearly recognizable as a human baby. Its
face is completely formed but the eyes are
still closed. A network of veins shows
through the transparent skin.
3. At 18 weeks (4 months) the baby
measures over 15 cm. It begins to flex its
muscles. It sucks its thumb and may
scratch itself with its fast-growing finger
nails. At about this time (between the 15th
and 20th weeks) there is a major spurt in
the growth of the nerve cells of the brain,
followed by a second spurt after the 25th
week. Development of the child's
brain requires the production of 1 1 billion
nerve cells during gestation at the rate of
20,000 a minute. If a mother suffers from
malnutrition, her child's brain may not
develop fully. It may have a reduced number
of nerve cells, with a consequent effect
on the child's "Intelligence Quotient." 1

played an important role in the out¬
come. Children born small at term,
or premature children, do not seem to
reach their full biological potential, no
matter how well they are fed in later
years.
Such investigators as Dr. C. M. Dril-
lien at the University of Edinburgh
(U.K.) showed that there is among
these children a much greater inci¬
dence of mental and physical handicap,
and that the severity of the difficulties
rises strikingly with decreasing birth
weight. Less than one per cent of the
normal children were found to exhibit
mental deficiencies. But an astounding
54 per cent of them had these prob¬
lems with a birth weight of 1.36 kg
or less.
A vast amount of research work has
also been done with twin births. It
has been abundantly demonstrated that
nutrients generally do not reach each
twin equally during the prenatal period,
and that the smaller of the twins almost
always exhibits a lower mental poten¬
tial, as determined by I.Q. tests.
In the chain of evidence linking early-
life malnutrition to brain development,
the work of Drs. M. Winick and
P. Rosso of Cornell University Medical
College (New York) is particularly
significant. Examining 19 brains from
children who died accidentally in San¬
tiago (Chile), they found that while the
brains of well-nourished Chilean chil¬
dren contained the same number of
cells as those of well-nourished U.S.
children, those of severely mal¬
nourished children who weighed less
than 2 kg at birth had as much as a
60 per cent reduction in their brain-
cell numbers.
Numerous studies exist which relate
chronic early-life malnutrition to
lowered performance on I.Q. tests.
The word "chronic" is emphasized,
because "there is also good evidence
that even acute malnutrition during
pregnancy and in the early years of
life may cause no long-term damage
to cognition. It is primarily the chroni¬
cally poor of the world, the disad¬
vantaged minorities, who are the most
likely long-term victims of chronic mal¬
nutrition with all its tragic conse¬
quences.
Investigators have grappled for
years with the question of heredity
versus environment on human cogni¬
tion. Some of the arguments presented
in support of one over the other have
reached the point of sanctimonious
absurdity. The following three cases
will illustrate the reason why such
arguments are logically self-defeating:
1. A child is born with the inherited
error of metabolism disease phenylke¬
tonuria (PKU), which has a clearly-
defined genetic origin. If left untreated,
PKU leads to irreversible mental re¬
tardation. However, if the child is fed
a diet free of the amino acid phenylala¬
nine, his chances of growing up with
nqrmal mental faculties- are> excellent.
2. A foetus with genetic potential for
normal development is growing in its
mother's womb. During the third
month of pregnancy, the mother is
infected by the rubella (German meas¬
les) virus. The child is born with
severe and permanent defects.
3. An adult with light skin migrates
to a sunny southern climate and an
outdoor occupation. His skin darkens
considerably. Another person with
dark skin moves to a northern environ¬
ment and á sedentary job. His skin
eventually appears no darker than the
light-skinned person before the move
south.
Other factors being equal, how
would the relative influence of here¬
dity and environment on the outcome
TWO MILLION YEARS
THE human brain is the culmina¬
tion of almost three billion years
of evolutionary history. It represents
the most complex structure in creation,
and is the site of man's supremacy in
the animal kingdom.
The fossil record discloses that
increased brain size has been the
most striking sustained trend shown
in hominid (family of man and his
ancestors) evolution. A large brain
must have conferred a clear advan¬
tage, and through the ages this attri¬
bute must have afforded greater
opportunities for survival than did a
small brain.
While at first glance it might have
been difficult to tell Australopithe¬
cus from a contemporary ape, since
both could walk on two feet in an
upright position, had opposable thumbs
and stereoscopic vision, they never¬
theless differed in at least this funda¬
mental respect.
Australopithecus and his descen-
of the three examples just cited be
assessed? It is this dilemma which
confronts those who consider the emo¬
tionally-charged issue of race and
intelligence. Clearly there are many
more variables to be analyzed in this -
instance than in any of the three cases
just cited. It seems clear that chronic
malnutrition is a major environmental
factor in considering the issue as a
whole. The problem begins with what
is meant by "race" and by "intelli¬
gence."
The word "race" has almost always
been used to define a group of human

OF CRANIAL EVOLUTION
dants had larger brains and overwhel¬
mingly higher intelligence than the
apes that were contemporary with
them. The modem adult chimpanzee's
average cranial capacity is less than
400 cc. (cubic centimetres), the orang¬
utan's is slightly greater than 400 cc,
and the modern gorilla's exceeds
500 cc. By contrast, the cranial capa¬
city of the fossil Australopithecus was
about 500 cc, of Homo erectus more
than 900 cc, and that of modern man
(Homo sapiens) averages 1,400 cc.
These striking relationships are gra¬
phically shown in the silhouettes on
this double page. These data, however,
must be interpreted with some caution;
cranial capacity is not synonymous with
brain volume, and is only a useful
approximation of brain size. Brain
weight today varies over wide limits,
and size can no longer be used as a
determinant of intelligence. Some
very stupid people have large brains,
and some brilliant ones have small
brains.
E.A.S.
beings who are sociologically related.
The modern trend is to define race bio¬
logically. The two often coincide, but
they are not synonymous. A biological
n definition of race states that members
of a given human group share biologi¬
cal characteristics that make it pos¬
sible for that group to be differentiated
from another group. This does not
mean, however, that one group can
be considered superior to another
because of such characteristics.
All men- are created equal, but they
are not all alike. And at the root of
this diversity lies the assurance of
human survival. But diversity is often
confused with inequality. The essential
point to remember in this context is
that mankind belongs to a single spe¬
cies which has been derived from a
common stock. The biological differ¬
ences exhibited by human beings are
due to a combination of genetic and
environmental factors.
There exist no human groups to
which the attribute of "pure race" can
be assigned. Human hybridization has
been going on for a very long time,
and no human being alive today would
have got where he is without his
parents having mixed their genes
together on his behalf.
Intelligence is even more difficult to
define. A British psychologist, Harold
J. Butcher, has pointed out that the
word "intelligence" is a noun, and that
nouns refer to things. Intelligence is
not a "thing," but rather a sophisti¬
cated abstraction for the way people
beha've.
Intelligence is made up of a wide
variety of attributes which individuals
possess in varying degrees. Some
people have the ability to visualize
concepts in three dimensions and can
become outstanding architects or
sculptors, yet may be very poor at
manipulating mathematical abstrac¬
tions. Others have outstanding verbal
facility, yet may be unable to write a
declarative sentence even with extra¬
ordinary effort.
All intelligence-test designers, begin¬
ning with the French psychologist
Alfred Binet, recognize this problem.
They attempt with varying success to
probe a variety of factors which appear
to correlate with their understanding of
what cognitive faculties are.
The misleading simplicity and attrac¬
tive numerical expression of the I.Q.
test, and its predictive effectiveness
in assessing education or job potential,
very quickly caused enthusiasm for it
to overshadow the severe limitations
that responsible psychologists had
warned against.
Dr. W. M. Littell, of the United
States, emphasizes that these tests
have no adequate rationale, and that
they are yet to be placed on a firm
theoretical foundation. . Another U.S.
scientist, Dr. Arthur Jensen, states that
intelligence, like electricity, is easier
to measure than to define. He also
points out that all major studies in this
field have been based on the obser¬
vation of white European and North
American populations, and that know¬
ledge of intelligence in different racial
and cultural groups within these popu¬
lations (e.g., black populations in the
United States), is nonexistent.
While I.Q. tests do not necessarily
measure intelligence accurately, they
are, properly used, a useful research
tool and deserve further study and
development. I.Q. scores may be valid
for a given human group at a given
time and place only. There is no such
thing as a universal I.Q. determination;
therefore such numbers cannot be
used to measure intelligence for peo¬
ple tested once and for all.
Finally, while the issue of race and
intelligence cannot be dismissed out
of hand, the truth is that most conclu¬
sions drawn by scientists and others
on the subject are devoid either of
scientific validity or educational signi¬
ficance. It is far more productive to
examine those controllable factors
which are likely to affect cognitive
potential. Chronic early-life malnutri¬
tion, a probable cause of cognitive
deficiencies, is one such factor which
deserves attention.

stand the reasons for a riot by
the electrical activity in the brains of
the participants. But it would be
equally naive to ignore that each
person has a brain and that determined
constellations of neurons (nerve cells)
are reacting to messages picked up by
senses that subsequently produce the
expression of violence.
Both neurophysiologies! and envi¬
ronmental factors must be evaluated,
and methods are available for their

particular, is an essential counterpart
of social studies, and this fact should
be recognized by sociologists as well
as biologists.
With the aid of recently developed
techniques it has been demonstrated
that we can investigate the neurological
JOSE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ DELGADO,
internationally-known Spanish neurophysiol-
ogist, is director of research at the new National
Centre "Ramon y Ca/al" in Madrid (Spain)
and chairman of the Department of Physiological
Sciences at Madrid's newly created Autonomous
University Medical School. For 20 years he was
a member of the faculty of Yale University
Medical School (U.S.A.) where he devised
many new techniques and instruments for
research on the brain, using electrical stimula¬
tion. He is the author ot "Physical Control of
the Mind : Towards a Psychocivilized Society"
(Harper Et Row, New York, 1969) translated
into six languages, and over 250 scientific
papers. Dr. Delgado now heads an interna¬
tional research team of neuroscientists in Madrid
mechanisms responsible for motor,
behavioural, and mental functions, and
also that we can influence them by
physical and chemical means. An im¬
portant group of these methods is
based on the insertion of very thin
electrodes in the depth of the nervous
system in order to activate specific
areas of the brain by means of elec¬
trical stimulation. These methods and
their results may be summarized as
follows:
Mapping of the awake brain. Needle
guides anchored to the skull of ani¬
mals have been used for a systematic
exploration of the brain and for the
detailed mapping of its functions. The
guides consist of pieces of stainless
steel tubing about 15 mm. in length,
piercing the skull at predetermined
points and ending outside the scalp.
A few days after surgery, the animal
has recovered from anaesthesia and its
fully awake brain is directly and pain¬
lessly accessible through the guides.
In one experiment with a gibbon a
total of 30 guides spaced 3 mm. apart
were used. Exploring electrodes may
be introduced through each guide in
1 mm. steps, permitting the systematic
study of over 1,000 cerebral points.
If necessary, the electrodes may be
fixed permanently in the most inte¬
resting areas of the brain for more
detailed experiments. Restriction of the
animal in a chair permits the analysis
of simple motor [voluntary] and auto¬
nomic [involuntary] responses, al¬
though the lack of free mobility may
influence these reactions and also pre¬
vents social contact with other ani¬
mals.
When the cerebral targets are
known, electrodes may be implanted
permanently. The terminal socket is
anchored outside the skull and elec¬
trical connexions for recording and
stimulation are established by means
of long leads. These allow for studies
of the animal either in a chair or free
to move on an observation stage (pho¬
tos 1 and 2, page 28). These experi¬
ments may be repeated indefinitely,
and some of our animals have been
kept for over four years with excellent
tolerance of implants and reliability
of results.
In one experiment a monkey was put
to sleep by electrical stimulation in the
septal area deep in the front of the
brain. After about 30 seconds, the
animal quietened down and slowly
closed its eyes, lowering its head. In
this relaxed state, the animal fell asleep
in about one minute.
While asleep, it responded to loud
noises or to touch by waking for a
few seconds, but then it fell asleep
again for as long as stimulation was
applied. The possibility of using sti¬
mulation in the septal area of the
brain for therapy of chronic insomnia
has been suggested, but further inves¬
tigations are required.
Close to the sleep-inducing areas,
there are other points stimulation of
which inhibits the spontaneous aggres¬
sion of rhesus monkeys. As shown

in photo 1 (page 28) this ferocious ani¬
mal usually attacks, grabs, and bites
any approaching object including a
human hand. Under stimulation of
inhibitory areas, however, the mon¬
key becomes peaceful without being
provoked by the proximity of the in¬
vestigator who can safely touch the
animal's mouth and pet him (photo 2,
page 28).
The monkey ¡s aware of the envi¬
ronment and reaches out to touch the
investigator's hand without any sign
of hostility. This experiment demon¬
strates that aggression can be inhi¬
bited by electrical stimulation of spe¬
cific brain areas without producing
sleep or depression.
Excitation of other parts of the
brain, especially the motor cortex, may
produce active responses affecting the
animal's behaviour. A typical example
of such motor effect elicited in a cat
is shown in photo 3 (page 29). Elec¬
trical stimulation of a point in the brain
known as the left sulcus cruclatus pro¬
duced a strong flexion of the cat's
right hindleg. This occurred without
disturbing the animal emotionally it
was actually purring and without alter¬
ing its equilibrium which was main¬
tained well on three limbs.
Depending on the stimulated point,
flexion and extension of the limbs,
turning of head and body, licking,
yawning, and a great variety of motor
effects may be electrically produced.
In general, the animal integrates the
artificial response with its ongoing
behaviour, and, for example, electri
cally evoked licking may be purpose¬
fully directed towards available food,
or towards the experimenter's hand,
Its own body, or the sides of the stage
on which the animal finds itself. The
Integration of spontaneous and indu¬
ced activities Indicates that electrical
stimulation of the brain activates pre¬
existing physiological mechanisms.
Radio communication with the brain.
To investigate brain structures which
play a role in social behaviour, con¬
necting wires cannot be used, and more
refined radio controlled technology is
therefore necessary.
An instrument developed in our lab¬
oratory (the "stimocelver") is small
enough to be carried on an animal's
collar, permitting two-way communi¬
cation to and from the brain without

Above, a normally ferocious rhesus monkey
becomes peaceful when a point in its brain is
stimulated by an electric current transmitted
through implanted electrodes. In photo 1, the
monkey attacks and tries to bite the
experimenter's hand (protected by a thick glove).
In photo 2, taken a few minutes later, when
the monkey's brain is stimulated (note the
time on both clocks) the animal has become
docile and has lost all trace of hostility.
L restricting in any way the animal's
movements.
With this technique it has been de¬
monstrated that the social relations
can be modified by the electrical sti¬
mulation of specific cerebral areas as
shown in photos 4 and 5 (page 29).
When the lateral hypothalamus of
the brain was excited in a previously
peaceful cat, rage was induced with
an aggressive display clearly directed
towards another cat which reacted
appropriately by facing the threat. Dur¬
ing radio stimulation, the animal start¬
ed prowling around threatening the
subordinate members of the group
but at the same time avoiding another
powerful cat.
The experiment demonstrated that
the stimulation of the brain had in¬
creased the cat's aggressiveness
without changing its awareness or dis¬
turbing the memory of previous ex¬
perience, because the stimulated cat
directed its hostility intelligently,
choosing its enemies and moment of
attack, and modifying its tactics to
adapt to the reactions of its opponents.
Brain stimulation had induced a state
of hostility but had not altered the
individual characteristics or skills of
the animal.
Further studies have been performed
outside the laboratory in a colony of
gibbons located on the island of Hall,
in Bermuda. These studies permitted
comparison of experimental results
with animals instrumented first in the
laboratory colony and then in a "nor¬
mal" free ranging situation.
Escape, fear, and lasting changes
of behaviour including decreased
friendliness were induced by radio sti-'
mutation of an area' located in the
stem of the brain known as the reti¬
cular formation. The stimulation of
the caudate nucleus of the brain resul¬
ted in a lowering of the social status
of animals as determined by the prio¬
rity they normally had in the pecking
order at mealtimes.
Brain-to-computer-to-brain exchange
of information has been established
in primates by means of radio links
(photo 6, page 30). In one case, the
spontaneous electrical activity of both
the left and right sides of the
amygdala was telemetered from an
ape free to move about and identified
by a linked-up computer.
The computer was set to identify
a specific pattern of "spindles"
(signals), produced by the amygdala.
Each time a burst of these waves
appeared a signal was triggered
through the computer to stimulate the
reticular formation of the brain of the
ape. These stimulations are known to
produce unpleasant sensations. In this

### 49425: New machines to explore the brain

way the brain was motivated to sup¬
press the amygdala "spindles" and
the animal's behaviour was changed.
The ape became more peaceful and
less interested in food.
Clinical application of implanted
electrodes. Some human patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy do not respond
to the usual drug therapy and may
require brain surgery which calls for
a very careful study of the location
and reactions of the abnormal cerebral
areas. This information may be ob¬
tained with depth electrodes, and sti¬
mulations and recordings have been
performed using radio links.
Other patients may require pro¬
grammed long term stimulation of the
brain, for example, for the therapy of
intractable pain. Surgical experience
has proved that after the insertion of
electrodes, the implantation wound
usually heals without complications.
However, the opening around the elec¬
trodes is a potential risk, and the pre¬
sence of terminal sockets in the
patient's hair may be inconve¬
nient for grooming as well as aesthe¬
tically disturbing.
To solve these problems while re¬
taining the advantages of two-way
communication with the depth of the
brain, a new technique known as trans¬
dermal communication has been deve¬
loped (transdermal means across or
through the skin).
Transdermal communication. In order
to stimulate and to make recordings
to and from the depths of the brain
through the intact skin, we developed
a solid state micro-miniaturized ins¬
trument called the "transdermal stimo-
ceiver", which is totally implantable
underneath the scalp. Four channels
are available for stimulation and three
for recordings. Power and information
are transmitted through the skin by
means of specially coupled coils. A
goat with a subcutaneous stlmoceiver
is presented in photo 8 (page 30).
As no batteries are used, the duration
of the instrument is indefinite, and it
is always ready for use simply by
placing the external coil over the skin.
The great advantage of this techno¬
logy is that no leads pierce the skin,
thus increasing the safety, comfort,
and long term use of the procedure.
Possible applications of transdermal
technology include long term record¬
ing of depth electrical activity to
monitor physiological states, emotional
reactions, abnormal epileptic activity,
and effects of medication. Long term
programmed stimulation of the brain
has a wide range of uses to induce
autonomic, somatic, and behavioural
responses, and also to influence inhi¬
bitory systems.
This last procedure has already pro- ^

Experiments with cats and monkeys show that
the electrical stimulation of the brain can make
an animal move different parts of its body.

current is directed to left side of motor cortex.
Below, stimulation in a part of the brain
known as the lateral hypothalamus caused a

Recent development of miniaturized devices has given new
scope to the use of electrical stimulation of the brain for
research and medical treatment. This chimpanzee (6)
has a special radio transmitter-receiver (the
"stimoceiver") anchored in its skull (not shown in our
photo). This device permits two-way radio
communication between the brain of the animal and a
computer. A stimoceiver has been implanted beneath
the skin of a goat (8). Using a special external coil
(ring-shaped device clipped to goat's horn) it is possible
to transmit an electric current and two-way information
through the intact skin. A man undergoing a
psychological test (7) has a stimoceiver implanted beneath
his scalp. Radio-controlled "trans-dermal" (through
the skin) stimulation of certain points in the brain has
been successfully used for the relief of unbearable pain.

ved its usefulness in the therapy of
pain in the patient shown in photo 7
(this page). We must consider this
method as far more conservative than
brain surgery which involves destruc¬
tion of cerebral areas and has been
recommended and employed ¡n many
cases of intractable pain.
Looking at the future. A possibility
of transdermal technology which has
been little explored is the sending of
information directly to pathways or to
receiving areas of the brain when nor¬
mal sensory receptors are damaged.
To give light to the blind and sound to
the deaf are within the possibilities of
present bioelectronics, although pro¬
viding suitable information by means of
these sensations would still be rather
difficult.
Transdermal stimoceivers allow the
simultaneous recording and stimula¬
tion of brain functions, permitting the
establishment of feedbacks and on-
demand programmes of excitation
with the aid of a computer. A reas¬
onable speculation is the transmission
of signals directly from brain to brain
of different individuals without the
intervention of the usual sensory
organs.
The recognition of specific brain
wave patterns to be used as a trig¬
gering device for the stimulation of
specific areas of the brain would
permit the modification of cerebral acti¬
vity as well as related behaviour, thus
offering great promise for- therapy and
research.
We .already have the capacity to
construct a microscopic computer
which could be implanted subcuta-
neously. These units would be able
to receive, analyze, and send back
information to the brain for the estab¬
lishment of artificial links between
unrelated areas of the nervous sys¬
tem.
Limitations of brain control. In spite
of spectacular achievements, the appli¬
cation of electronics to the brain has
important limitations which make
rather improbable the feared push¬
button control of behaviour. The elec¬
trical excitation of the brain can only
activate pre-existing cerebral func¬
tions but cannot create them. Passing
an electric current through electrodes
cannot be compared with the coding
of information which takes place at
the sensory receptors of the brain.
In general, we accept the influence
of mass media, education, and indoc¬
trination as part of "normal"' life,
without realizing that, as recent res¬
earch has demonstrated, these sen¬
sory inputs circulate as coded signals
within cerebral pathways and have a
decisive influence on the anatomical
shaping of neurons, in cerebral che¬
mistry and in the structuring of brains,
minds, and personalities. Language,
patterns of emotional and behavioural
responses, beliefs, and culture are
learned through the eyes and ears,
but cannot be introduced into the brain
by wires and electronics.
Brain research offers .a challenge
comparable to exploration of the atom
or of the universe, because to under¬
stand and influence the mechanisms
of the mind would allow us to direct
intelligently our own evolution and the
source of all human activities.

### 49417: Our split brain

OUR SPLIT BRAIN (Continued from page 1'6)
in evolutionary terms and is governed
by the left hemisphere ; and prosodie
elements which we have in common
with animals and which are more
ancient and are governed by the
right hemisphere.
Our study of "single hemisphere"
people has shown that the isolated
activity of each hemisphere is asso¬
ciated with a specific range of emo¬
tional states : the left hemisphere
_ with positive emotions and the right
hemisphere with negative emotions.
It is extremely difficult to account for
this unexpected fact. One can only as¬
sume that an important general prin¬
ciple underlies this "divergence" in
emotions and that a positive emotio¬
nal tone is more closely related to
abstract thinking, and a negative emo¬
tional tone to imaginai thinking.
This general principle has already
been noted by neurophyslologists. One
well-known specialist in the physio¬
logy of the emotions, P. V. Simonov,
drawing on his analysis of the
characteristics of conditioned reflexes
formed on the basis of negative and
positive emotional states, has expres¬
sed an interesting idea : "Negative
emotions have a propensity for con¬
crete images... whereas positive emo¬
tions favour the transition to abstract,
generalized models."
It is possible that the reason for
the connexion between various emo¬
tional states and various forms of
thinking and the activity of the two
hemispheres should also be sought
in evolution and in the history of the
formation of mental activity. N.N.
Traugott, a Soviet researcher, in
studying the general principles of the
depression and restoration of mental
functions in acute pathological states
of the brain, has shown that aspects
of mental activity which, in evolutio¬
nary terms, are more ancient become
depressed later than others and are
restored earlier than others.
It has also been established that, as
cerebral activity becomes depressed,
the first emotional reactions to dis¬
appear are the positive emotions and
the last of all are the negative emo¬
tions. When cerebral activity is res¬
tored the sequence is reversed. There
are therefore grounds for thinking that
negative emotions are older in evo¬
lutionary terms than positive emotions.
A further indication of this is the fact
that young children display negative
emotional reactions earlier than posi¬
tive ones.
We already know that the most an¬
cient components of speech are as¬
sociated with the right hemisphere.
We now see that the more ancient
emotions are also associated with
the right hemisphere. However, one
should not think that the emotional
mechanisms are localized in the cor¬
tex of the hemispheres. Emotional
reactions are connected with the activi
ty of the deep cerebral tissues the
sub-cortical nuclei. The cerebral hemi¬
spheres merely exercise a regulating
influence on these nuclei, each hemi¬
sphere, so we have become convinced,
in its own different way.
Our study of the "one hemisphere"
person showed that each hemisphere
has its own memory and its own
"archives". Physiologists and psycho¬
logists are well aware that the memory
is not merely a repository for the long-
term storage of material that has ser¬
ved its purpose. The memory is intima¬
tely bound up with current mental ac¬
tivity and plays an essential part in
the processing of information. We
have become convinced that each type
of thinking has its own working archive
in its own territory.
Obviously, the archive in the right
hemisphere is the memory for indi¬
vidual specific phenomena and is also
more ancient than its counterpart in the
left hemisphere which is a verbal
archive. Even animals which are on
a lower rung of the evolutionary lad¬
der than mammals have a well-dev¬
eloped memory for specific objects and
phenomena. Children who have not
yet learnt to speak already have an
imaginai memory. If brain activity ¡s
sharply depressed the verbal memory
is disturbed earlier than the imaginai
memory and is restored later ano¬
ther fact which points to the greater
evolutionary age of the imaginai
memory.
Thus, the more ancient components
of complex mental functions speech,
memory and the emotions are asso¬
ciated with the right hemisphere. But
imaginai thinking is itself more ancient
than abstract verbal thinking. We
resemble our younger brethren, the
animals, in having an accurate and
complex perception of the specific
phenomena that make up our environ¬
ment, while our capacity for abstract
thinking is the evolutionary achieve¬
ment which has set us above all living
creatures.
It is the functions of the left hemis¬
phere that have raised mankind to a
position of supreme eminence. Very
broadly, animals can be said to have
two right hemispheres although, of
course, one must not equate the right
hemisphere of the human brain with
the cerebral hemispheres of even the
most highly organized animals.
This brings us to one of the most
intriguing questions in the study of
the functional asymmetry of the human
brain: how did it come into existence,
how was the anatomically and func¬
tionally symmetrical animal brain
transformed into the functionally
asymmetrical human brain? It must
be said straight away that there ¡s
no categorical answer to this question.
The problem of the emergence of func¬
tional asymmetry remains a matter
of guesswork and surmise. This prob¬
lem has two aspects.
In the first place, why are the new
and specifically human functions of
verbal speech and abstract thinking as¬
sociated exclusively with the left
hemisphere? The most widely held
view is that the development of new
functions in the left hemisphere is to
be accounted for by the primacy of the
right hand (which is controlled by the
left hemisphere) in working activities.
This view is based on observations
of the fact that even in the higher
apes, our nearest animal relatives, one
of the upper extremities, either the
right or the left, is seen to be of
greater importance in performing
complex motor actions.
However, this assumption requires
further substantiation and research. An
American researcher, R.W. Doty, has
recently discovered that even the
cerebral hemispheres of rhesus mon¬
keys show a slight disparity in their
control of certain complex forms of
behaviour. If this is so, it is reas¬
onable to suppose that the precondi¬
tions for the functional specialization
of the cerebral hemispheres were al¬
ready present to some extent in our
remote ape-like ancestors.
Whatever the reason for the selec¬
tive evolution of the left hemisphere,
in all probability at the early stages of
human development, when verbal com¬
munication was beginning to come into
existence, this process was already
associated with the activity of the
left hemisphere.
The second aspect of the problem
may be formulated as follows: what
would have been the likely consequen¬
ces of the association of the left
hemisphere with the emergence of
speech? It is an established fact that
when a particular portion of the brain
acquires new and more complex func¬
tions, the old functions which were
formerly characteristic of this portion
of the brain are suppressed and be¬
come rudimentary.
It is obvious that such a process
must have taken place as verbal com¬
munication was coming into existence.
In the left hemisphere the functions
associated with imaginai thinking that
were inherited by it from our animal an¬
cestors must have been suppressed
and become rudimentary.
At the same time, the right hemis¬
phere evolved. But its evolution con¬
tinued and improved on the functions
which it inherited from our animal an¬
cestors imaginai thinking became
more complex and more highly dev¬
eloped. This is the origin of the unequal
distribution of cerebral activity the
functional asymmetry in the human
brain and of the emergence of two
independent thinking apparatuses.
It is an interesting fact that the pro¬
cess whereby the functions are dis¬
tributed between the hemispheres may
be observed in early childhood. We ^
have already stated that the develop- r

r ment of the individual organism is es¬
sentially a historical play, a compres¬
sed re-enactment , of the entire
evolution of the animal world. The
last act of this play is performed before
our eyes after the birth of the child.
The child is born with what may be
regarded as two right hemispheres and
has as yet no "verbal" hemisphere.
The findings of two Canadian scien¬
tists, Wilder Penfleld and Lamar Rob¬
erts indicate that during the first two
years of life either hemisphere may
take this distinction upon itself. Only
with increasing age does the division
of "spheres of influence" between the
hemispheres become established in the
healthy child. However, this does not
occur in all children. The cerebral
hemispheres of nearly one person in
three do not acquire a clear functional
specialization.
We have seen that the occupational
specialization of the brain's hemis¬
pheres in human beings Is completed
after birth and that a demarcation line
between the apparatuses for imaginai
and abstract thinking becomes estab¬
lished with increasing age. Moreover,
it appears that a person's individuality
and psychological make-up depend on
which of the thinking apparatuses be¬
comes dominant.
About forty years ago, Ivan Pavlov
wrote of these two types of people:
"Experience clearly shows that there
are two categories of people: artists
and thinkers, between whom there is
a sharp distinction. On the one hand
the artists grasp reality in its entirety,
as a complete, living and indivisible
entity. On the other hand the thinkers
divide up reality, temporarily making it
into a kind of skeleton, and only later
do they gradually reassemble its parts
and thus try to breathe life into it ... "
In Pavlov's time too little information
was available to scientists on the func¬
tional specialization of the cerebral
hemispheres and his classification of
people into two types was unsupported
by anatomical evidence. We are now
in possession of the necessary infor¬
mation. The "artists" are people
whose right hemisphere, governing
imaginai thinking, is dominant because
it is more active and powerful. The
"thinkers" are people who have a more
active left hemisphere, governing ab¬
stract thinking. The American research
worker Joseph E. Bogen has shown
that the dominant activity of one
hemisphere may be caused not only
by innate factors but also by pecu¬
liarities of upbringing and education.
So far we have considered the
activity of each hemisphere in Isolation
as though man had two separate and
unconnected brains, whereas, in fact,
normal mental activity implies that both
hemispheres work together. What do
we mean by working together? Neuro-
physiologists formulate this problem in
terms of hemispheric interaction.
The "right hemisphere" person
perceives the world in all its specific
richness and variety. But as he is
incapable of theoretical thinking he
cannot analyze his impressions, estab¬
lish a logical connexion between
them or assign them to particular cate¬
gories; and for this reason the richness
of his impressions bears no fruit.
When only his left hemisphere is work¬
ing, the same person retains his capa¬
city for analysis, generalization and the
handling of logical concepts but is
unable to use these faculties because
he has no impressions to analyze or
from which to draw general inferences.
It is obvious that only if both hemi¬
spheres are working simultaneously
and if the mechanisms for imaginai and
abstract thinking are somehow connect¬
ed can there be any all-round specific
and conceptual grasp of the pheno¬
mena making up the world around.
But our observations of the "single
hemisphere" person showed us some¬
thing else. When the right hemi¬
sphere is inactivated verbal activity
becomes easier, in other words the
activity .of the left hemisphere in¬
creases. If the left hemisphere is
inactivated the activity of the right
hemisphere is thereby increased and
imaginai perception is enhanced. This
means that in the normal "two-hemi¬
sphere" state, each hemisphere inhibits
the activity of the other.
The two hemispheres are not there¬
fore independent of each other. There
are complex and paradoxical inter¬
connexions between them. On the
one hand they co-operate in the work
of the brain, each complementing the
abilities of the other. On the other
they compete as though each
were preventing the other from doing
its own job. Although the significance
of co-operative, so-called complemen¬
tary interaction is clear, the signifi¬
cance of competitive or reciprocal ac¬
tivity is far from evident. Let us try to
clarify the matter.
In the nervous system, stimulation
is always accompanied by inhibition.
The inhibitory process prevents the
stimulus from spreading to areas which
should not be involved in the given
activity. It reduces the intensity of
the stimulus, so that it is just strong
enough for the effect in question and,
ultimately, damps it down when the
need for it has passed. Without this
inhibitory process the activity of the
nervous system would become chaotic,
undirected and self-destructive.
Accordingly, the greater the com¬
plexity of a particular portion of the
brain and the more complex its func¬
tions, the more complex is the structure
of its inhibitory mechanism. It is evi¬
dent that this mechanism is particularly
Important for the higher divisions of
the brain. Indeed, each hemisphere
has its own inhibitory machinery
(chains of special inhibitory neurons)
and the hemispheres are also subject
to the Inhibitory activity of the deep
tissues of the brain. We are now
convinced that each hemisphere is
subject to the inhibitory influence
stemming from its partner.
But the mutually inhibitory effect of
the hemispheres has one further
specific purpose. In order to react
satisfactorily to the changing circum¬
stances and varied situations with
which the individual Is faced in his
everyday life, it is essential sometimes
to combine the aptitudes of the right
and left hemispheres and sometimes
to use the capacities of one or. other
of them to the fullest possible extent.
When a mathematician is handling
concepts such as multi-dimensional
space and imaginary numbers he Is
thinking in a highly abstract way.
When the same man is faced, with a
sudden emergency while driving his
car he is able instantaneously to size
up real space and real objects and to
avoid disaster by' maximizing his ima¬
ginai perception.
The reciprocal interaction between
the hemispheres ensures that there Is
always something held in reserve and
enables a very subtle and accurate
balance to be maintained between their
activities. In this way it is possible
to preserve the optimum relationship
at any given moment between imaginai
and abstract thinking.
This may perhaps provide a clue
which will enable us to answer one
further puzzling question concerning
the purpose of functional asymmetry
and the "advantages" which it has for
the brain. Nature mercilessly sup¬
presses everything which is not an
advantage for the body but scrupul¬
ously selects and preserves everything
which is beneficial. As we have just
said, there are situations in which it is
essential to use one or other type of
thinking to the fullest extent. Obvi¬
ously, to enable the mechanisms for
imaginai and abstract thinking to be
used individually, it is essential that
they be separate from each other and
be situated in different parts of the
brain so that an intensification of cer¬
tain abilities does not entail an inten¬
sification of the others.
The purpose of complementary inter¬
action of the two hemispheres is to link
their abilities, while their reciprocal
interaction ensures that a balance is
maintained between the abilities of
each so that, at the required moment,
one pan of the scales is raised and
the other lowered. In general, the
complex, twofold nature of the relation¬
ship between the hemispheres ensures
the maximum efficiency of mental ac¬
tivity and behaviour.
Thus, it seems certain that it is
incorrect to speak of the main hemi¬
sphere and the subsidiary hemisphere,
the "major" hemisphere and the
"minor" hemisphere. The right hemi¬
sphere is the basis of imaginai thinking
and grasps the world of phenomena in
all its richness and variety. The left
hemisphere is the basis of abstract
thinking; it seeks and finds in the
world a harmonious pattern of causes
and effects. In order to use one's
mental faculties to the full the smooth¬
ly equilibrated operation of both hemi¬
spheres is required.

it was announced that his predecessor had died.
"Having been associated with his work, as Assistant Director-

Unesco and of the international community. His death is a loss
for the Organization and for the whole United Nations system.
"Profoundly aware of the evolution of the modern world, moved
by a desire for justice and human dignity, he spared no effort to ensure that Unesco brought
its most active aid in the fields of its competence to formerly oppressed peoples who were

"The humanist philosophy which he applied with unfailing ardour aimed at bringing about
a civilization which, in its respect for the uniqueness of each people, would beto use an

Letters to the Editor
OUR DEBT TO MICROBES
Sir,
As a regular reader of the "Unesco
Courier" for many years, I have often
wanted to tell you how much I admire
the magazine. Your July 1975 issue on
microbiology gave me particular satis¬
faction since it dealt with a subject
often neglected in other publications:
the contribution of microbes to so
many aspects of human life.
I have myself tried to stress this
fact in a number of books I have written
about French scientists such as Antoine
Lavoisier, Louis Pasteur and Claude
Bernard, and particularly in a collection
of popular science texts written in
co-authorship with Jean Salvinien.

Sir,
After reading your issue on the New
World of Microbiology, I now realize
the significance of the magazine as a
source of useful information on modern
science. The articles were serious,
well-written, clear and excellently
illustrated. The authors deserve com¬
mendation. As a result of their work
I have now a basic knowledge about
that field of science.
Wishing all success to the "Courier".

SENSELESS SLAUGHTER
OF WILDLIFE
Sir,
As a reader for several years, I
greatly appreciate the quality and
variety of the articles you publish. I
know you have already published a
good deal on the protection of wild
animals, but perhaps you should take
another look at the subject. This would
be an opportunity to impress on readers
that the wholesale slaughter or capture
of wild animals for trade and industry,
for pseudo-scientific display in zoos,
and to give "pleasure" to hunters
continues today. Protection of wildlife
is an urgent problem in view of the
scale and in some cases the Irreparable
effects of this carnage.

A WOMAN'S
LOST IDENTITY
Sir,
I read your Issue "Turning Point for
Women..." (August-September 1975)
with great interest. I have . always
followed the question of women's
emancipation personally and profession¬
ally (as a writer, lecturer, etc.). Never¬
theless, there is one important point
which, I feel, Is far too often neglected:
a woman's family name.
In most countries, when women marry
they . are "veiled" by their husband's
surname. Most married women in
France, for instance, do not realize that
they have a right, but not an obligation
to use their husband's surname and are
unaware that they are not obliged to
put their married name on their identity
cards. "When I got married, I changed
my name", they often say. "Maiden
name" Is an Incorrect term, just as an
equivalent sort of term would be if
applied to a young unmarried rnan.
Women who have been the innocent
parties In a divorce and who bring up
their children alone must still do so
(often at their own expense) under their
ex-husband's name.
Finally, the titles "Mrs." and "Miss"
reflect an outdated order of things. An
important aspect of woman's social
condition is that she sHould have her
own "identity". Bravo for all your
efforts on behalf of women.

Congratulations on your issue ex¬

much. Thank you again for your

have been of great interest to many
other readers.

POPULATION GROWTH
OR ECONOMIC GROWTH?
Sir,
I read your two issues on World
Population Year (May and July-August
1974) with great attention. It seems to
me that the term "population explosion"
is one of the most widely used to ex¬
plain away hunger, poverty, child deaths
and underdevelopment. But those who
emphasize the problem of how new
mouths are to be fed, disregard the fact
that each new life means two new hands
capable of producing material wealth.
The demographic problems faced by
the developing countries create an
inescapable need for a social transfor¬
mation which will give these countries
control over their own natural resources
and free them from economic exploi¬
tation and political domination.
In my opinion the article by the
Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis is
the best in the July-August Issue. He
points out that while the reduction of
birth-rates is today an urgent task for
certain countries, "with cultural growth,
the increase in the share of women's
labour, the reduction of infant mortality,
the expansion of social insurance and
the disappearance of vestiges of ' the
past, the attitudes of married couples
will be oriented to small families".

EDUCATION SEEN
IN NEW PERSPECTIVE
Sir,
The article on higher education by
Dragoljub Najman (June 1975) is thought
provoking. The connexion of the teacher
of higher education with real life and
society should be such that he under¬
stands the meaning and purpose of
life and society as a whole and not
merely the application of the academic
discipline he has learnt.
He should consider himself and also
be trained as a channel for the trans¬
mission of the quintessence of human
experience and not merely a particular
discipline. Education like many other
things should be considered in the
evolutionary perspective. So what the
teacher learns as a discipline should
not be an end in itself but the link in
a feed-back cycle of human evolution.
Modern life and society have varied
problems in different communities but
the teacher has the unique opportunity
of drawing upon the experience of
humanity as a whole and utilizing the
aid of a galaxy of disciplines in
furthering human evolution. !

THE RIGHT TO GROW OLD
Sir.
I believe that we shall need to draw
up a new Declaration of Human Rights
giving special consideration to the
elderly. The fact is that the U.N.
Declaration of 10 December 1948 fails
to take into account the now vastly
increased number of old people living
alone and neglected in many parts of
the world. Their special problems are
underlined in the report of a group of
experts which met at U.N. headquarters
in New York In May 1974.

WORLD FELLOWSHIP
OF RELIGIONS
Sir.
The "Unesco Courier" is a blessing
and encouragement to us. Your issues
also enable us to perform our duties
more comprehensively. Thank you for
all you are doing for mankind.
Our purposes are for world religious
leaders to know and understand each
other and to work together as unitedly
as possible on world problems.
Our conferences have been held in
Delhi, Paris, and Teheran and now we
are planning a conference In Sri Lanka
in about a year's time. For each
conference a theme is chosen to
which the world's religious leaders
devote time, attention and thought. At
each of our conferences approximately
60 world religions are represented.

China's educational
reforms seen through
Chinese eyes
An exclusive report from PROSPECTS
Unesco's educational quarterly
Chinese writers take a first-hand look at educational re¬
form in China in a nine-article "dossier" just published by
Unesco's educational quarterly, Prospects (Vol. V, N°4,
1975).
This unique set of articles describes the facets of educa¬
tion the Chinese themselves consider to be of key impor¬
tance. It gives new details on the way schooling in China
has been taken out of the classroom and into the fields
and factories.
Prospects explores timely and provocative questions
facing education today, with special stress on edu¬
cational innovation and reform.
Each issue publishes a comprehensive "dossier" on a
major theme. Recent ones have examined education in
the least-developed countries, new roles of teachers, and
education and women.
Prospects is also published in French and Spanish lan¬
guage editions. An Arabic edition is also available.

BRAIN TISSUE
Exploration of the brain with the aid of powerful scanning electron microscopes
reveals arresting "landscapes" like the jungle glimpsed here through a crack in a
speck of brain tissue. The human brain has about eleven billion nerve cells or
neurons, each of which is a sophisticated information-processing centre capable
of taking split-second action. To enable you to read these words, millions of tiny
electrical impulses flash to and fro through the vast neural network of your brain.
