Portrait of a young girl
suffering from mental
illness by the French
painter Odilon Redon
(1840-1916). Here the
artist has borrowed a
traditional theme of the
Middle Ages in which tiny
"bells of folly" were fixed
to a cap symbolizing the
mentaliy ill. But Odilon
Redon has infused his
work with a tenderness,
softness and understand¬
ing which reflect the
approach to mental
disease today.

together with techniques for studying
the complex processes of mental and
physical health. Here, a little boy plays

HEALTH
in the world
of tomorow
by Dr M. G. Candeau
Director-General
of the World Health Organization
4
PRIL 7 this year marks the twentieth anniversary of
the World Health Organization.
Looking back, WHO and its Member States have witnessed the
general improvement in world health which is largely due to their
combined efforts. There have been disappointments; there still
remain the inequalities between the developed and the developing
countries which it is the Organization's aim to reduce.
In general, however, the record is one of success and achieve¬
ment. Recent scientific advances have already contributed to these
achievements; they will do even more in the future. Therefore
on April 7 and throughout the Anniversary Year it is proposed
to concentrate on the theme: "Health in the World of Tomorrow".
T OMORROW clearly means the next ten or twenty
years. This is the period during which the scientific discoveries of
the past decade will become generally applicable, and the new
ones now germinating will prove their worth. These advances will
affect the health of people in every country. How will they operate?
We can assume that there will be some general improvements
in environmental conditions, the control of communicable disease,
nutrition, and in a greater availability of medical care. These will
certainly be beneficial. But the impact of the new discoveries will
be most dramatic.
We have been told that it is not unreasonable to expect from
the extensive research now being undertaken a break-through in
cancer. Similarly, more precise knowledge about certain common
diseases of the heart and blood-vessels and their relation to the
chemistry of the body opens up the prospect of controlling these
great killers of today.
Research into the chemistry of our tissues and organs may throw
light on the process of ageing and bring us nearer to the post¬
ponement of old age.
More will be learnt about the causes of the mental disorders,
and when we are able to classify them better, treatment will be
more specific and effective.
Drugs and antibiotics to cope with hitherto elusive viruses are
other possible additions to this incomplete but formidable list.
B UT mankind will still be exposed to a multitude of
influences which unless controlled can nullify these expected
advances. Some are old, some new, but all are potentially if not
actually harmful. The list includes the various chemicals with
which we live pesticides, food additives, radioactive residues;
the polluted air, soil and water; urbanization with its possible
squalor, disease and social maladjustments. In many countries
population growth will bring comparable problems. Add to these
the insidious evil of drugs and we have a grim catalogue.
Weighing the effect of these influences and remembering the
health promoting activities now in progress, I consider the balance
is favourable. The individual should benefit.. He will have better
health with which to enjoy the leisure and the longer life which
the future promises.
Finally what is the role of WHO in all this? It is not new. Much
of the Organization's current programme has foreseen these
developments. Indeed, many of its research activities have already
contributed to them. WHO will maintain and extend all these
interests, stimulating the advancement of knowledge and encou¬
raging its application for the benefit of all.

LONGER UFE -
LESS SICKNESS
by Jean-Michel van Cindertael
In this plastic model,
showing how blood
circulates through ' the
body, pulses of light
produce an illusion of
movement, simulating
the flow of blood and
the pumping action of
the heart. The model
is one of the exhibits
in the Hall of the
Biology of Man, a
permanent exhibition
explaining the functional
processes of the
human organism, in the
American Museum of
Natural History,
New York.
O what extent can man
hope for a longer life-span in the
world of to-morrow? We are not
talking about the normal expectation
of life at birth. This has certainly
increased almost doubled, in fact
in the space of a century and a half.
Expectation of life is more a ques¬
tion of mathematical probability a
science which the actuaries are
constantly seeking to perfect and
according to which a man in the deve¬
loped countries now rates an average
life expectancy of 75 years, and a
woman a span of 80.
If we are to increase that estimation
within the coming decades, it will be
necessary to reduce all mortality
factors. This would include infant
mortality, the accidents that happen
to children, the cardiovascular dis¬
eases that affect the mature adult,
and so on, and not simply the factors
that affect old persons who have gone
beyond the normal span of life as we
see it today in 1968.
How far will the works in the human
clock go on ticking? The likeliest
estimate is about 100 years. Already
there are cases here and there of
people living to 120, 130, even 150
years.
But is modern man then biologically
different from his ancestors? Yes and
no. For while it many be true that life
for early man »was short (20 to 40
years, and very exceptionally 50), the
Bible fixes the normal human life-span
at three score years and ten. "And we
have precise information concerning
the lives of the ancients: Virgil died
at 51, but Pythagoras lived to the age
of 82. Plato lived until 80, Plutarch
Co to 74, Xenophon to 73, Epicurus died
| at 71, Cicero at 64 and Ovid at 60.
These figures do not differ a great
deal from those which are applicable

FACING THE 21 ST CENTURY (Continued)
THE CHALLENGE
OF CANCER
Cancer is the second killer
disease after cardiovascular
diseases in industrially
developed countries. Cancer
is a cell disease which can
affect any organ or tissue of
the body. When a cancer
cell appears it divides in
two and then sets off a chain
reaction of rapidly multiplying
cancer cells. Division, seen
in photomicrograph, right,
takes 90 minutes. Photo left
shows treatment of cancer
patient by cobalt bomb.
Drawings, far right, show
experiments by an American
doctor of Buffalo, New York,
using a special graft
technique: (1) Grafts are used
to exchange tumours between
patients with identical forms
of cancer. (2) Patients
develop antibodies against
foreign tumour and graft is
rejected. (3) Patients receive
reciprocal transfusions of
white blood cells. (4) White
cells are tolerated by both
organisms and tumours and
secondary growths are
reduced and in some cases
eliminated.
Promise and dangers of genetics

today, in developed countries, to the
majority of men. And yet the way of
life of the ancients, their nutrition,
habitat, activities and preoccupations
were in many respects different from
ours. And while it may be true that
we are still following some principles
of medicine that have come down to
us from Hippocrates, the ancients had
nothing to compare with modern medi¬
cal knowledge and the therapeutic
advantages we derive from it.
However, this consistency in man's
biological patterns across two thou¬
sand years of history should not sur¬
prise us: it must be admitted rather
that a hundred generations is precious
few in the perspective of man's ances¬
try. We all know examples of longevity
running in families, and the study, for
example, of monozygotic twins (com¬
monly called "identical" twins) shows
that their respective life-spans are
often of similar length, even though
they may live in divergent environ¬
ments.
w E also know, and it is
perhaps here that man's future may for
the first time be radically affected, that
ionizing radiations (those used in
industry and medicine much more than
nuclear fallout) as well as certain che¬
mical substances are capable of bring¬
ing about mutations, for the most part
harmful, in the genes, or hereditary
characteristics. If a gene is altered,
the normal functioning of the human
body can be affected to an extent far
beyond what is acceptable.
One of the tasks of modern research
is to discover the exact functions of
the genes of the individual. Already
we have learned how to avoid the
effects of certain serious illnesses of
genetic origin such as phenylketonuria
which causes serious mental retarda¬
tion, albinism, and diabetes, and other
afflictions of an hereditary nature.
Eventually we will learn how to repress
the ill-effects of certain genes by a
biochemical process.
However, although man Is now able
to correct at least partially some of
the built-in errors of metabolism (phe¬
nylketonuria is a case in point, because
its effects can be neutralized if the
disease Is detected after birth), we
have to face the fact that the problem
has been moved to another area rather
than eliminated. Up to now, children
who had these afflictions either died
very early or else were incapable of
reproduction. Now that science has
intervened, they can procreate, trans¬
ferring their handicap to an increasing
number of human beinas through the
years to come.

In the opinion of the geneticist,
Hermann J. Muller, a Nobel Prize
winner (1946), we should seek to go
further, producing super-beings by
artificial insemination, using freeze-
dried spermatozoa from men of
acknowledged intellectual stature.
This view, and similar arguments
linked with the concepts of the post-
Darwinian school, lead us to revolu¬
tionary theories of "manipulation" of
the human species, so that man's phy¬
sical attributes will match the complex
society of the future. In the same way,
if we follow the thinking of the Ameri¬
can biologist, J. Lederberg, also a
Nobel Prize winner (1958), we will find
ourselves on the threshold of an era
when artificial human organs such as
the heart or the kidney will be mass-
produced, and hormones, enzymes,
antibodies, etc., will be synthesized
at will.
As far as present possibilities are
concerned, such proposals remain in
the sphere of science fiction, apart
from the fact that they present us with
difficult philosophical, social and reli¬
gious questions. What criteria would
we select, for example, in creating our
supermen? But we cannot shrug the
whole thing off, for science is on the
brink of achievements that would make
the fiction of today a fact tomorrow.
The future dilemmas posed by such
doctrines as eugenics (Müller) and
euphemism (Lederberg), and euthana¬
sia as well, are likely to rack men's
minds even more than the problems
of the past 25 years, i.e. since the
discovery of nuclear weapons.
A PART from genetics, we
must seek also to achieve fuller com¬
prehension of immunology if we are to
improve the conditions of existence.
I am referring now to that essential
balance which, when disturbed by the
appearance of a foreign body, brings
about the production of an antibody
specially designed to neutralize it and
defend the organism.
There are of course cases where
the response is insufficient or too
slow, and others where the antibodies
commit "errors of identification", and
illnesses result. Immunology is, there¬
fore, in spite of popular belief, much
more than the science of vaccination
(which is in essence but the first and
most elementary application of the
principles involved).
Let us take an example from the
battle against cancer. If we accept
the theory that the cancerous cells
which multiply in the body contain a
substance foreign to the normal tis¬
sues of the organism, the immunolo¬
gical system should intervene to anni¬
hilate the invaders.
Experiments have been made with
the transplantation of cancerous tissue
in men and animals. With animals, it
was established that vaccination with
extract from cancerous tissues pre-

FACING THE 21ST CENTURY (Continued)
vented diseased tissue from spreading
when transplanted.
On the other hand, an experiment
was conducted in which 50 cancer
patients received an injection of an
extract from their own cancerous
tissue, and an injection from1 their own
normal tissue for comparison. There
was a positive reaction in 27 per cent,
of cases in regard to the cancerous
tissue; but a negative reaction to the
extract of normal origin.
In fact it is quite possible that
something like 10,000 cancerous cells
invade our bodies every day and are
halted and neutralized by our anti¬
bodies. According to a theory advanc¬
ed by Sir Macfarlane Burnet, it is only
when the reaction by the antibodies is
insufficient, too weak, or too slow, as a
consequence of the aging of the organ¬
ism, that cancer gets the upper hand.
This would so explain why cancer
affects mainly the elderly.
Immunology is, of course, but one
approach to the cancer problem. (It
is also possible that the disease is
caused by a virus or some other factor
which alters the information code of
the cell to such an extent that the cell
is no longer controlled by the central
system.)
A quotation from Dr. Alex Comfort,
one of the best-known experts on the
problem of senescence, sums up the
argument:
"The most important single change
in our world, where life-span is con¬
cerned, is that in privileged countries
our children grow up and reach old
age and our wives no longer die in
childbirth. Men have always known
the probable limit of their lives. We
now know more accurately than ever
before when we are likely to die. The
most important future change depends
on the progress of our understanding
of fundamental age processes. If the
present trend of medicine continues
without such progress, all that will
happen is that the commonest age of
dying will shift from being nearer 75
to being nearer 85, and the commonest
causes may change so that we die of
conditions which are not now so com¬
mon, today's most frequent killers hav¬
ing been removed to uncover the next
layer of the onion."
But he points out that there are
other aspects of the issue. If it is
possible to make fundamental changes
in the human organism, it should also
be possible either to increase the
period of adult vigour alone, or the
period of adulthood and the period of
onset of old age, without extending
the average length of life.
Another and more valuable possibi¬
lity would be not to prolong unduly
the infancy cycle, but to be able to
insert between the years of 20 and
30 a "bonus" of, say, five years, after
which the person concerned would
revert to his normal life cycle.
If such progress and it is much
more radical than the question of
simply adding a few years to the ave¬
rage human-life-span is ever achiev¬
ed, medical science will have succeed¬
ed not only in altering the processes
of life for man's benefit, but in chang¬
ing all his ideas about death. The
grim Reaper will come, without the
usual forewarnlngs, at an age which
remains undetermined, and that may
well lie beyond the "limits" which we
know today.
Bigger populations less food
T
8
HE world's population has
been increasing steadly for centuries,
but the growth is accelerating. Accord¬
ing to the experts, the world's entire
population was only about two or three
hundred million at the beginning of the
Christian era. It took 16 centuries,
i.e. until the Renaissance, to double
in size. But by 1850 the total had
reached 1,000 million, and 2,000 million
by about 1930. The pace continues
to quicken, creating an impetus con¬
demned by many as foolish and
unconsidered, for they argue that the
earth cannot feed an infinite number
of mouths. Even now, in the year
1968, only a few privileged countries
enjoy an abundant or indeed over¬
abundant food supply.
It may however be wrong to see the
problem in a pessimistic light, for it
has not been demonstrated that our
planet will be unable to nourish a much
larger population. The British econo¬
mist Colin Clark has asserted that,
by making the most of science and
technology, it would be possible to
produce enough amino-acids to sustain
45,000 million people.
This figure is challenged by other
authorities, however, for a world popu
lation of such dimensions would throw
unbearable strains of a different nature
on our resources. Not only would it be
necessary to cultivate every inch of
available land further space would
have to be found, in itself agricultu¬
rally unproductive, for new towns, new
roads, all the other bits and pieces
needed on account of man not living
"by bread alone".
It must not be forgotten, however,
that there are many countries today
which cannot develop their agriculture
efficiently because of low population
density. It is not always the most
densely-populated countries which
have nutrition difficulties. Malnutrition
occurs in New Guinea, for example,
where there is only one person per
square kilometre, as well as in scan¬
tily-populated areas of South America
and Africa. On the other hand, den¬
sely-populated countries like Belgium
and Holland have ample food supplies.
The equation linking overpopulation
and hunger can only be understood if
a number of other essential factors
are taken into account. These factors
include the level of economic develop¬
ment, education, climate, and the qua¬
lity of the soil. There are also some
highly industrialized countries which
rely largely on food produced else¬
where.. But a developing country
which has to make huge purchases
of wheat or other foods abroad in
order to meet the needs of her people,
inevitably weakens her foreign exchan¬
ge position thereby putting a brake on
her own industrial and agricultural
development and puts off the day when
she will be independent of foreign
economic aid. The food situation in
many countries is also worsened by
religious taboos, by lack of nutrition
education and by vast though prevent¬
able wastage (by rats, for example).
Education has a very important part
to play. Too often we find malnutri¬
tion, even hunger, in regions where
in theory food should not be scarce.
When, for some local reason, there is
a ban on eating eggs or fish or certain
kinds of meat, people often substitute
things which are low ¡n vitamins, iron
and amino-acids, and therefore are not
sufficiently nutritious.
Very often these dietary deficiencies
aggravate the condition of persons
already weakened by parasitic dis¬
eases, such as bilharziasis and ancylo-
stomiasis. In Africa, for example,

Scientists have constructed a three-dimensional model to show the complex structure
of the cells in the human body. Photo shows close-up view of centre of model,
which is 24 feet in diameter and 12 feet in height, and more than one million times the
size of a living cell. The human body contains 100 million million cells in wfiich protein
molecules constitute the enzymes that operate complex chemical changes in the cell.
Each cell contains thousands of different kinds of protein molecules, and nearly
every one of these protein molecules contains several thousand atoms.

deficiency diseases, such as kwashior¬
kor, are widespread. Their early
stages have been diagnosed in 30 per
cent, of children in the weeks following
weaning, and they cause thousands
of deaths every year.
Fortunately, modern science is
potentially capable of meeting the chal¬
lenge of a population of 6,000 million
or 7,000 million by the year 2000. But
to do so, total world food production
would have to be Increased by 170 per
cent., and products of animal origin
by 200 per cent. The production
increase required in the developing
countries, where nutritional déficiences
are most frequent, would have to be
of the order of 500 per cent. (i.e. six
times the present output).
There would also have to be a
radical adjustment of world trade
sweeping away the present division
between "rich" and "poor" countries.
We could take another step in the
right direction if consumers could be
persuaered-to-cimnge their food habits
to some degree. Governments could
make important contribution by
subsidizing certain food products
which are rich in protein. Groundnuts,
oilseed and even some industrial
residues now used in their raw state
as cattle fodder could be specially
treated for human consumption.
A cautious optimism seems justified.
Certain amino-acids can already be
manufactured synthetically, though in
small quantities, but we are still a
long way from the point where they
could usefully be incorporated in
actual diet. Studies have also been
made of the possibilities of using
plankton, seaweed, yeasts, even bac¬
teria operating on chemical products
with a petroleum base.
Sea farming also offers interesting
possibilities. During a recent confe¬
rence on development, it was suggest¬
ed that large-scale breeding grounds
be established where fry_ would be
safe from their natural enemies, and
fed until big enough to fend for them¬
selves. They would then be released
in the fishing grounds. Since the
fishing fleets of all nations have equal
rights in these grounds outside terri¬
torial waters, systematic restocking
would have to be carried out within
the framework of international agree¬
ment.
Some experts at the conference
even suggested that the sea-bed
which, to all intents and purposes, is
a vast compost heap, might be exploit¬
ed. Remote-control harrowing equip¬
ment might be used, or even com¬
pressed air, which would turn over the
sediment and bring rich, nutritive
materials closer to the surface.
But it is not enough simply to find
more food. Man also needs shelter,
education, welfare and a social life.
He needs not only the means, but also
a reason to live. All this may still be
within the bounds of achievement in
the world of 7,000 million people, as
predicted for the year 2000. But all
our hopes would be submerged if the
present geometric rate of progression
were to continue: some 40 years later
there would be a population of 12,000
million. Children now being born may
well live to see the year 2040.
The mind has difficulty in grasping
such possibilities, and many may dis¬
miss the figures as mere abstractions.
It does appear that the rate of increase
in the industrialized countries started
flattening out as soon as a certain
level of economic development and
social well-being was reached. But
by a quirk of fate it is in those coun¬
tries where existence is most pre¬
carious that the population is expand¬
ing most rapidly.

FIRST DOCTOR IN SPACE
On October 12, 1964, a young Soviet doctor, Boris Egorov, oribited in
space for 24 hours as a crew member of the Voskhod I, a 6-ton Soviet
spaceship. His task was to study the effects of space flight on the
organisms of cosmonauts, including the nervous and cardiovascular
systems. In flight he recorded the biological currents of his own brain
and those of his companions, Konstantin Feoktistov and Vladimir Komarov.
Dr. Egorov's medico-biological space research, notably his studies on
the vestibular apparatus of the ear, including the effets of weightlessness
on the sense of balance, was the subject of the thesis he later submitted
for his Master of Science degree. Left, a medical check-up for the doctor-
cosmonaut before his flight. Below, studying his route over the world.
Right, undergoing the strenuous physical training of a cosmonaut.
A number of explanations have been
advanced by sociologists. The most
persuasive is based -on the steady
improvement of man's health over the
past hundred years. This is perhaps
to be ascribed not so much to medical
progress as to general advances in
hygiene, ranging from the purity of
water to working conditions in fac¬
tories, without forgetting the important
role of compulsory schooling for all
children.
In the absence of statistics, we have
no means of knowing the full ravages
of mother and child mortality before
the beginning of the 20th Century.
What we do know, however, is that
even in recent times in Europe, it was
taken for granted that of a family of
six or seven brothers and sisters,
three or four would die in childhood.
On the other hand, in an economy
where child labour was quite legal and
children were exploited without the
slightest scruple see the pages of
Dickens the large family offered a
primitive kind of social security at a
time when official systems were non¬
existent. Farms were unmechanized,
and needed armies of workers, while
in the cities the apprenticeship system
was a substitute for schooling, and
relieved the father of a family of his
material responsibilities as early as
possible.
While this social pattern has almost
vanished in the developed countries,
such is far from being the case in the
economically less advanced countries
which are desperately trying to catch
up the hundred years' advance that
industrialization and increasing social
justice have bestowed on North
America, Europe, the U.S.S.R., Japan,
Australia and New Zealand. But until
industrialization arrives, the developing
countries adhere to the traditional
family pattern, even though we are
now in an era where a child born
anywhere in the world has a better
chance than ever before of achieving
his normal life-span.
That infantile mortality is decreasing
is obviously to be welcomed, and we
must see to it that over the next
decades a common standard of health
is achieved for all mankind, something
which is far from being the case at
present. The fact remains that health
work is ahead of economic develop¬
ment, and if this gap persists, it will
be detrimental to both.
It took India hundreds of years, from
the dawn of her history until the pre¬
sent day, to bring her population to
500 million. But if the population
continues to increase at its present
rate, another 500 million will have been
added between now and the end of
the century, i.e. in about 30 years.
It is hard to imagine the gigantic
investments needed to create a viable
economy that would yield adequate
reinvestments in the form of housing,
hospitals and roads for a population
that has doubled in size. Yet even
if all the aid now available from the
highly developed nations were devoted
to India alone, it would still not be
enough to meet present needs.
Should there be fewer children?
Some countries say yes as far as
they are concerned. In other countries
where the population pyramid is
already out of shape and where the
progress of medicine by increasing the
average life-span threatens to make it
top heavy there should be more
children. Birth control is advocated
in some countries, condemned in
others, and in yet others is a matter
of indifference. Clearly, in 1968 at
least, there can be no world-wide
solution.
We must hope that advances in
scientific knowledge will ease the
pressures which soaring birth-rates
are already now creating in some of
the developing countries. The year
2000 is likely to be difficult, the more
so since the population explosion is
linked with an inexorable process of
urbanization which, in spite of its many
unpleasant aspects, will probably affect
at least two-thirds of mankind.

### Facing the 21st century
FACING THE 21 ST CENTURY (Continued)
° Bigger cities - less green space
W.
12
. J HEN the twenty-first
cenfury dawns the world's population
will have grown to six or seven
thousand million people, according to
present demographic forecasts. The
majority will be living in vast conurb¬
ations, compact yet tentacled as the
octopus, heaving seas of anonymity,
which will either have exploded from
their present confines or arisen
virtually complete in areas which today
are still deep in the countryside.
The fact that In 1968 such a prospect
causes us to shudder a little, or that
at any rate we view it without pleasure,
is an indication that the transformation
will not take place smoothly. The
ordinary individual fears that he will
be starved of light, air and space, and
most of all that he will lose his indivi¬
duality in what will become a vast
ant-heap. In effect, he fears that his
health, his physical and psychological
well-being, is going to be at risk. Is
he wrong?
Yes and no. He is wrong, in the
sense that the urban experience has
not in fact up to now endangered his
health, and has had rather the contrary
effect. It was because his daily life
was hard that the individual left his
fields, came down from the mountain,
emerged from the jungle to settle in
the town, and earn there the bread
that he could not find elsewhere. The
town gave him the liberty of the labour
market, opportunities for culture and
recreation, and some guarantee of
health care. Statistics confirm that, in
regard to general health at any rate,
the promise offered by city streets has
been fulfilled.
And yet . . . Even while granting that
the town or city as we know it today
takes man's needs into account, can
we say as much for the city of tomor¬
row? In the developing countries, the
expansion of population around the
urban zones has created hideous
shanty-towns that lack the most ele¬
mentary sanitary equipment. And in
the big cities of the industrial nations,
pollution of every kind is rife. It mani¬
fests itself in the uproar of city streets
and in the vicinity of airports, in the
discharges into the atmosphere from
the exhaust pipes of our cars, in the
hurried, jagged patterns of daily life
which create around us a kind of psy¬
chological pollution.
There are, therefore, an army of
challenging problems facing the man
of tomorrow. But we should say,
rather, the man of today, for the
possible solutions require time as
much as money, imagination as much
as goodwill. Social problems are
linked with economic plans, health is
affected by conditions of work and
housing, in short, the approach must
be integral, excluding nothing, forgett¬
ing nothing.
For the citizen of a developed
country, nothing is more commonplace
than water. He uses it freely since,
as a general rule, it costs him almost
nothing. And yet it is not an inexhaus¬
tible resource. In some western cities
such as New York, he is reminded
of this by occasional periods of water
during drought.
But when we turn to the developing
countries, water ceases to be a preoc¬
cupation and becomes a problem 'of
dramatic proportions. Very often,
there is no water supply of any sort
in those hovels one sees in the shanty-
towns and bidonvilles, dwellings made
from a few bits of wood and corrugat¬
ed iron, even of mud, in the middle of
scrap-heaps and dumps.
Water has to be searched for, often
very far away. As often as not it is
of doubtful quality. Hence the enorm>
ous number of cases of cholera,
typhoid,, bilharziasis and filariasis.
The two last-named diseases are sel¬
dom immediately fatal but have such
debilitating effects that they reduce
the economic potential of the sufferer
and, as a direct consequence, the
chances of material betterment for
both him and his family.
I T is clear that the urban
development of the next 30 years must
not be a development of shanty-towns.
The authorities must first solve the
fundamental question of water supply
which constitutes the real point of
departure. An example of the impor¬
tance of this ¡"s the city of Teheran,
in Iran, which in 1932 before a hygienic
water supply was installed had a mor¬
tality rate of 25 per 1,000. Thirty years
later, and in spite of the fact that the
population had greatly increased, the
death-rate had fallen to 11.5 per 1,000.
WHO experts have attempted to
calculate the cost of providing a regu¬
lar water supply where it is needed
to inhabitants of developing countries.
A study carried out in 1962 with a
projection of urban growth over a
period of 15 years, i.e. until 1977,
estimated that some 207,000,000 peo¬
ple now need or will need in the future
some type of water supply. The total
cost is put at about $6,000,000,000
($1,000,000,000 for India alone,
$1,000,000,000 divided between Brazil
and Indonesia, and the rest spread
over 72 nations of Africa, America and
Asia, as well as Turkey).
This may seem a. considerable sum.
Nevertheless, if the investment is
spread equally over the 15-year period
it hardly amounts, on average, to
0.25 per cent, of the gross national
product of the 75 countries in question.
This is not a great deal in view of the
fact that 10 per cent to 20 per cent
of the gross national product of a
developing country is generally used
for essential national investment.
However, a clean water supply must
be accompanied by means of getting
rid of the water when it has been used,
along with refuse and excreta. If not,
the results can be catastrophic, as
witness the unhappy example of
Rangoon.
A clean, modern city before the last
war, Rangoon underwent several bom¬
bardments and then, at the end. of
hostilities, a massive invasion by^,
refugees. The sewage system had
been destroyed, pipes were blocked,
pumps were out of action, and refuse
was left to rot on the ground. It was,
of course, a situation which invited
the proliferation of mosquitos on an
enormous scale. Today there are
thousands of millions of the mosquito
Culex fatigans in Rangoon the insect
which transmits filariasis, the disease
which often manifests itself in the
form of elephantiasis.
Communities need to gauge their
present and future needs, and make
the requisite financial investment: at
present Calcutta in India is devoting
$500,000,000 for the progressive res¬
toration and repair of its waste dis¬
posal system.
But granted the fundamental import¬
ance of water supply and waste dis¬
posal for the health of a big city, they
still constitute but a proportion of the
many factors involved in maintaining
the well-being of modern man. Under
this heading pollution, unfortunately,
merits particular mention.
There is good reason to believe that
most victims of the pollution of the
atmosphere characteristic of big cities
are to be found among persons of
weak health suffering from chronic
bronchitis old people and children in
particular. , We still do not know
enough about the role that air pollution
may be playing in the development of
cancer or its effects on the human
genes, but there are grounds for
concern about the future.
In the same way, we need to keep
a careful watch on the proliferation ot
various types of radiation, both in
industry and for medical purposes.
Water pollution is no less a danger,
even in the cities of developed nations.
Sewage, fuel and industrial wastes are
frequently dumped into lakes, rivers
and the sea, inevitably contaminating
the fish and other sea food destined
for human consumption.
It is in the city of tomorrow, then,

### Facing the 21st century
WONDERS WITHIN A DROP OF BLOOD
At the end of the 17th century the invention of the microscope first enabled
scientists to perceive the complex nature of blood. A new science, hematology,
was born. A modern laboratory count made on a single drop of blood (one cubic
millimeter) normally reveals 5 million red corpuscules, 8 million white corpuscles and
200,000 platlets (particles which help blood to clot). Studies of the blood show what is
happening in the human organism, since the proportions of its constituents vary according
to a person's state of health. Drawing shows the ten chemical components in a drop of
blood: (1) Sugar. (2) Cholesterol. (3) Urea. (4) Fibrinogen. (5) Bilirubin. (6) Proteins.
(7) Potassium. (8) Calcium. (9) Lipides. (10) Sodium.
that man will work out his destiny.
This is not only because three-quarters
of the world's population will be
involved in the urbanization process
when the twenty-first century begins.
It is also because man today must
make his readjustments both biologic¬
al and intellectual in the shadow of
the city.
We have not yet managed to solve
the contradictions to which we are
subject in this regard. Modern man
displays a revulsion from the village,
from the little rural backwater, and
avidly seeks the great collective and
social confrontation, the competition
in which he will be tested by his peers.
At the same time, he flees from the
undiscriminating touch of the crowds
and the great agglomerations, seeking
for himself and his family a private
spot, a country cottage for weekends.
We must try to reconcile these
opposing desires rather than bring
them to the point of open rupture by
allowing them to continue to pull in
different directions. Town planners and
architects have a major role to play
here, since their previous creations
have perhaps gone too far in the
direction of the purely functional or
aesthetic. Vast green spaces, for
example, are indispensable around
new residential zones, and some
experts even advocate that they be
left as wild wood and thicket, affirming
the union between nature and anti-
nature that the city represents.

HE second rupture we
must avoid is that between home and
the place of work. While it is true
that over the past 100 years the hours
we must spend each day in factory
or office have diminished, it also
appears that modern man is steadily
losing this "leisure time" so painfully
gained in commuting twice a day, often
in conditions which are a menace to
his health. These comings and goings
between the suburbs and the city
centres are unproductive and must be
reduced, particularly since they involve
increasing congestion of transport.
The solution, as is immediately appa¬
rent, is to decentralize the factories and
offices, a trend which has already
begun in Sweden and Great Britain, for
example. But the new towns springing
up in consequence must offer more than
a place to sleep and to work, must be
more than a pale reflection of the big
cities they seek to replace. They must
have a soul, must offer a point of
contact between those who live there.
Beyond these preliminary steps, we
must have a wider vision. We should
seek to build our cities again, this time
in harmony with the kind of life we
will live tomorrow. They may be cities
on stilts, freed from the earth and
freeing it. They may be cities under
the sea, as is sometimes predicted in
science fiction. But whatever technical
innovations are used, the cities should
be conceived, designed and built for
man and only for man.

### Wanted: 3.5 million doctors
WANTED :
3.5 MILLION
DOCTORS
by Stanisiav Kavka
14
I F there is to be one doctor
for every 770 people, then the world
today is 3.5 million doctors short.
The figure is staggering, but what of
tomorrow when the number of people
in the world may have doubled?
In medical education one always has
to think of tomorrow's needs, if only
because it takes eight or nine years
to make a doctor about six years of
medical school and two or three years
of practical experience.
Population increases and changes in
the composition and distribution of
population are going to have great
influence on health services, and the
demand for professional health care
can everywhere be expected to
increase by leaps and bounds.
The economic aspect is important
new schools and teaching hospitals
will have to be built and equipped
but so is the question of human
resources, the question of attracting,
the right calibre of men and women
as teachers and students. Over and
above these considerations, the
explosion of information and of
scientific knowledge entails qualitative
changes in the style of thinking and
working: education will of necessity
change both in form and in content.
Modern society and the modern
style of life tomorrow call for doctors
who have thorough professional know¬
ledge, but also high moral qualities
and a serious attitude to their work.
Education in medical schools and
post-graduate institutes will have to
allow for the fact that the doctor in
his daily work will need to apply more
psychology and sociology. At present,
this is no doubt accepted, but the
general assumption seems to be that
the doctor will pick up the knowledge
he needs in these two fields as he
goes along rather than as the result
of systematic teaching.
The danger of specialization is that
the patient tends to become an object
of investigation, of therapeutic tech¬
niques, and that the psychosocial
factors are completely lost sight of.
DR. STANISLAV KAVKA is an official of
the Public Health Service in Prague, Cze¬
choslovakia.
This should not be. Specialization is
without doubt a higher professional
echelon than general practice, it is the
terrain on which new discoveries grow,
but too much specialization, eclipsing
the general practioner, can be detri¬
mental to community health care, and
if the family or district type of doctor
is an essential member of the health
team, then education in medical school
should be geared to producing him.
Though specialization may be
attractive to the young men and
women entering the medical profession,
they should not forget that the
generalist has important and fasci¬
nating tasks to perform in improving
general health conditions, in actively
promoting health, in disease prevention
and the early detection of cases, and
in the psychosocial field.
P OST-GRADUATE educ¬
ation is essential today if proper
professional standards are to be main¬
tained. The U.S.S.R. has 13 institutes
of post-graduate education and 13
post-graduate faculties in medical
schools. In the U.S.A., the American
Medical Association organized 1 600
post-graduate courses in 413 institutes
during one year (1966-1967). A new
centre for post-graduate medical
studies was opened in London in 1967.
In Czechoslovakia, all medical estab¬
lishments take part in post-graduate
education and a post-graduate medical
institute was opened in Prague in
1953. Such activities will need to be
intensified in the future to help doctors
keep abreast of the new knowledge
and new techniques that are going to
transform medicine in the future.
In conclusion it is probably justified
to give an optimistic prognosis on the
world's endeavour to secure the health
of the human race, provided effective
international co-operation is supported
by all countries.
The isolation of some countries
needs to be abolished by an intensive
international exchange of information
and the development of science.
Medical education on a level with
contemporary scientific knowledge is
an essential factor in the achievement
of better health for man tomorrow.

### The Click of computerized medicine
The click of
computerized
medicine
by John Anderson
The human brain comprises 10,000 million cells as many as there are stars in our galaxy.
Impulses from the nervous system keep these cells in a state of constant chemical
and electrical activity. Sometimes the electrical discharges in the brain become excessive
and aberrant, as in the case of an attack of epilepsy, a nervous disorder about which we
have still much to learn. Use of a new technique, stereo electroencephalograph exploration
(shown in photo), now enables doctors to locate precisely which parts of a patient's
brain are linked with his attacks of epilepsy and to decide whether or not to operate.
Electrodes placed in skull detect electrical discharges and data is recorded by investigating
apparatus. Doctor observes patient's reactions on a TV screen.
R ABA awakes one morn¬
ing feeling but a sick shadow of his
usual self. His wife and children also
think he is ill. The television telephone
Is moved to his bedside and he talks
to his doctor.
The doctor works in a modern health
centre and talks directly with his pa¬
tient, seeing him at the same time on
his television telephone. He deter¬
mines the patient's symptoms, finds
out that he has a headache and feels
sick and feverish, and decides by look¬
ing at him and hearing what he has
to say that he Is fit enough to visit
the health centre if he comes by spe¬
cial air-conditioned electrical car.
Immediately the doctor switches on
the visual screen connecting him with
the computer. He speaks the patient's
name and address in a special tone
of voice, and asks the computer for
Mr ABA's medical record. This is
displayed for him on the television
screen of his computer link. He reads
it and then dictates further information
to the computer link. The computer
arranges the appointment for Mr ABA
and records the doctor's observations.
On arrival at the clinic at the
appointed time, having had his trans¬
portation from home organized by
the computer, Mr ABA goes straight
in to see the doctor in Room 82, direct-

KIDNEYS SEEN
VIA GEIGER
COUNTER
To study the general condition
of a patient's kidneys or
to confirm the presence of a
tumour, doctors sometimes
use a diagnostic technique
called scintography. After
injecting a radioactive
substance which concentrates
in the kidneys, they use
a Geiger counter to pick up
the radiation emitted.
The results are recorded
as dots which form a picture
or scintigram. Right,

ed by the nurse in the vestibule who
has received her instructions from the
computer voice coming from a ter¬
minal located there. She records
Mr ABA's arrival by his name and
number which she speaks into a
special microphone.
Mr ABA is seen by Dr. X who talks
further with him about his symptoms,
examines him and suggests that further
tests on blood and urine are required.
While the specimens are being obtain¬
ed, the doctor dictates a medical sum¬
mary of Mr ABA's illness and his other
observations to the computer terminal.
The computer television screen
comes up with a possible list of diag¬
noses. The doctor indicates the likely
possibilities and the computer agrees,
but suggests another less familiar pos¬
sibility and further tests the doctor
might do. The doctor decides he
would like some more information
about this special aspect and after
requesting access to the computer
medical library is able to read on the
screen the special information he has
requested and the summary of the
past experience of many clinics obtain¬
ed by the computer system.
The doctor collects the required
blood and urine specimens in special
containers which are automatically
removed by a computer-controlled
tube communication system to the two
automated laboratories where the var¬
ious tests will be done. The com¬
puter estimates the time the tests
will take and informs the doctor when
the results will be ready. Mr ABA
goes to the waiting room and is soon
summoned to return by the computer
as it now has his results ready. The
doctor also is informed.
The doctor then prescribes the
appropriate treatment, advises Mr ABA
to stay at home for a few days, and to
get in touch with him again if all is
not well. Before Mr ABA's departure
the doctor dictates to the computer
terminal the treatment his patient re¬
quires. This is checked by the com
puter and the message passed to the
automated pharmacy department in
the Centre.
At the pharmacy the computer
arranges the various sorting devices to
locate and fill the boxes with the
appropriate tablets for Mr ABA, print
the instructions and label the boxes
automatically. The pills are then
transported by tube system to Room 82
and the doctor hands them to Mr ABA.
The doctor checks the patient's
instructions and tells the computer
that the patient has his treatment and
that no further arrangements are ne¬
cessary unless Mr ABA calls.
The computer then enters all the
data on Mr ABA; including the treat¬
ment prescribed, in the central file
while the next patient is seeing the
doctor. It has already taken over
much of the mechanical chores from
the doctor and nurse by communicat¬
ing, arranging and doing special tests.
It helps to perform and organize tests
automatically and records the result.
A. . UTOMATIC dispensing of
treatment through ancillary sorting and
labelling devices is done by the com¬
puter. It also checks the dosage and
updates the stocks of the dispensary,
so that it can make new orders when
required. Thus it frees the doctor and
nurse to take care of Mr ABA.
If Mr ABA had had to attend hospital
for further investigation and treatment,
the health centre computer would have
organized the appointment with the
hospital's computer and this would
have been conveyed to Mr ABA by
telephone using the computer's auto¬
matic voice mechanism. If he was
unable to come at that particular time,
Mr ABA would indicate this and the
computer would make a new appoint¬
ment. The computer can accept a few
commands, as well as responses like
"yes" and "no", in any language.
On arrival to see the hospital con¬
sultant, Mr ABA would be directed
from the reception desk to the doctor's
office by a nurse. There would be no
waiting, all arrangements having been
made by the computer. Again, after
talking with Mr ABA and examining
him, the hospital doctor would record
all his medical data on the computer,
which would take care of the investi¬
gation schedule and the treatment.
If Mr ABA needed to go into hospital,
the computer would arrange for his
bed and meals and for nursing staff
to be allocated to him. All the hospi¬
tal's communication would be done by
means of the computer, so that records
would be made as information was
received. Both hospital and health
centre would use the same medical
data bank for Mr ABA's medical rec¬
ord, much of it being available only
to his doctors with a much more res¬
tricted access than is at present allow¬
ed, thus giving Mr ABA complete confi¬
dence in the safety and reliability of
the system.
Patients in the year 2000 have found
that the computer cuts out the time
spent waiting to see the doctor and
organizes automatically the medical
procedures. As it does not tire or
get bad tempered and only rarely
breaks down, patients have come to
take it all for granted.
The doctor too has had to learn
about medical computing techniques
and during his training has become
used to working with a computer. In
some parts of his course, where he
has had to memorize a great deal of
information, he was taught by the com¬
puter which corrected his mistakes pa¬
tiently and with good humour no mat¬
ter what the time or the occasion. The
computer was used to teach him the
tone and emphasis to use in giving it
instructions. Speech and information
flashed on a screen now provide a
much quicker and rapid means of
communication between man and
computer.

by Joseph Handler,
The computer has greatly increased
the facilities available also to the fam¬
ily doctor who can order many
investigations and use the computer
to interpret the results, or get it to
search the literature relating to a spe¬
cific disease and give him a summary
of world medical knowledge on the
subject.
With such a system, the approach
to illness and health has altered. The
man-machine relationship has now
emphasized the importance of pre-
symptomatic disease which is present
before the patient feels there is
anything wrong. This has been one
of the major'developments in medicine
in the year 2000 when most of the
infectious diseases as well as cancer
have come under the control of new
and powerful drugs.
The key to the problem lies in the
body's reaction to disease where it
can compensate for many errors until
the control starts breaking down and
symptoms arise. A deeper under¬
standing of cybernetic mechanisms
as a result of new man-machine tech¬
niques has brought this to the fore.
It has been- found that drug influen¬
ces may be more potent and accurate
if given earlier. New techniques ex¬
ploiting the advances in knowledge in
physics, chemistry and bio-engineer¬
ing have all been used with great
effect for the patient's benefit.
What of computers themselves and
the operating staff? The expenditure
in effort to instruct the computers has
been great and so was the initial
expense, but once the task had been
done it was well worth it because of
its universal application.
The computers are still having
trouble in translating all the languages
but can aiready accept six or seven.
Many doctors all over the world speak
a universal medical language thanks
to computer training.
The computers are much smaller
now, work faster and are organized
into hierarchies of machines, looking
after themselves to a great extent.
Advances in electronics and engineer¬
ing have made them much more
reliable.
Many other automatic devices have
been developed which the computer
can control and which get rid of many
of the automatic chores connected
with a health service. On the econo¬
mic side the performance of the com¬
puter and of the many automatic
measuring devices and automated
dispensaries has freed the health ser¬
vice from its dependence on various
forms of human labour. Administra¬
tion has been largely taken over by
the computer; directors of hospitals
and health centres are merely required
to issue judgments on the data provid¬
ed by the computer.
D ISTRICT health services
are organized and controlled by a
series of computers. Health officers
can track down physical and emotio¬
nal problems to specific areas. Much
has been done to improve emotional
as well as physical health by altera¬
tion of the environment and support
of the patient by skilled medical
workers at the level of the home and
health centre rather than at the
hospital.
As the areas and health centres
have undertaken more personal care
of the patient, hospitals have decreas¬
ed in importance and are viewed as
centres of investigation and research.
Now many more doctors and nurses
are outside hospitals, and the preven¬
tive measures due to the detection of
pre-symptomatic disease have greatly
decreased the incidence of gross
disorders.
Man has much more leisure now
to devote to family group activities
and as a result human relationships
have become richer. Control of the
environment through man-machine
techniques has kept pace with the
progress in medicine. Everywhere the
computer is an essential work-horse,
much like the diesel engine and power
cable in the middle of the 20th cen¬
tury. The man-machine revolution . is
still continuing in the 21st century
and is creating many problems at na¬
tional level because of the speed of
advance.
Problems have arisen because of the
explosion of information in every di¬
rection in society and in particular in
the medical field. Economic manage¬
ment of hospitals and area health. ser¬
vices has proved difficult. On a natio¬
nal scale the same problem exists, for
ideas about making computers reduce
the flow of information by developing
techniques to sift and sort various
types of data are hard to prove. Thus
the unorganized randomness of infor¬
mation is still with us.
While Mr ABA's care by able ma¬
nagement is good at the local level,
serious difficulties in the direction of
the service at higher levels reduce
the efficiency of medical care. Overall
management services have resisted
the challenge of the man-machine age
longer than any other. There have
been delays in the implementation of
new ideas and progress has been
slow and difficult.
The doctors have already accepted
that the man-machine era has arrived
and have been working hard to force
administrative advances based on
computer techniques. Already they
have found that they have to be the
leaders in creating a new administra¬
tive system a revolution comparable
with that in public health many years
ago. The era of the non-professional
approach to management at higher
levels has been relegated to the past
and it is accepted that this task needs
special and exceptional talent.
On the international scene things
have proved to be just as difficult.
Man-man relations have proved to be

### Medical experiments on man; round-table on the doctor's dilemma
The basic principles of medical ethics have not
changed since the time of Hippocrates 2,500 years
ago and therefore are not always easy to apply to
new situations created by biomedical advances. In
what circumstances should experiments be made
on a sick person? Or on a healthy one? What
weight has the consent given by a volunteer for
experimentation ? What criteria, for example, should
be used to choose a donor for organ transplantation ?
Medical men are justifiably concerned over these
problems which have aroused keen public interest.
In the practice of medicine, unprofessional conduct
is punished by prosecution for malpractice, but
experiments on man are still not controlled by law
in most countries. Medical science thus faces a
dilemma. The different aspects of these problems
were examined at a Round-Table organized by the
Council for International Organizations of Medical
Sciences (CIOMS) in Unesco's headquarters, Paris,
on October 7, 1967. CIOMS was set up in 1949 by
Unesco and the World Health Organization. We
publish below the opening address by Professor
Marcel Florkin, of the University of Liège (Belgium),
president of CIOMS and (on pages 25-27) passages
from the Round-Table discussions between eminent
scientists in medicine and medical research. These
reveal the diversity of views and the complexity of
problems posed today by medical ethics.

ScSCIENTIFIC progress rests
at one and the same time on obser¬
vation of patients and on the results
of experimental science. The founda¬
tions of the development of clinical
science are to be found in animal
experiments, and no one denies that
one of the most essential conditions
of medical progress is freedom to
carry out such experiments in accor¬
dance with well established principles.
Nevertheless, it is also equally obvious
that the prime condition of advances
in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
is the application of clinical science
to man.
Indispensable though they indeed
are, trials on human beings clearly
have limitations. Is it not sufficient to
leave it to the conscience of the
doctor himself? Such an attitude has
been shown to be tragically insuf¬
ficient, as was demonstrated by the
criminal actions of Nazi doctors.
During the Nuremberg trial, Briga¬
dier-General Telford Taylor, after
stressing the necessity of trials on
human beings, since the results could
not be obtained by any other means,
formulated on August 19, 1947 a
series of principles which he claimed
to be universally acceptable.
The first of these principles requires
that the subject of an experiment
should be fully informed and give his
voluntary consent to the experiment.
But already there are difficulties here,
for the principle is inapplicable to
children and to mental patients.
However, the voluntary consent of the
fully informed family of the subject
can take the place of the subject's
own consent. The definition of con¬
sent raises other problems, such as its
mode of delivery, whether oral or
written.
One serious drawback of the first
principle of Nuremberg is that to
inform the subject may be to thwart
the purpose of the investigation, as
when drugs and placebos are admi¬
nistered successively. However, it
seems that full information need not
necessarily be given in respect of
obviously harmless aspects of the trial.
The second Nuremberg principle
requires the investigation to be such
as to provide results that are for the
good of mankind and cannot be
obtained by any other method. There
has been speculation on several
occasions as to whether the demons¬
tration that a new therapeutic method
is ineffective could be considered as
a result redounding to the good of
mankind. It seemingly could be
regarded as such in the broad sense,
since it prevents the application of
ineffective methods.
The third Nuremberg principle lays

AUXILIARY HEART
This machine is an artificial heart.
It Is not designed to replace a
human heart but to help
persons with serious
cardiovascular diseases such as
myocardial Infarction, by relieving
and resting the damaged heart until
it can again take over its normal
functions. The four elements of the
machine, used in the U.S.A.,
recall the auricles and ventricles of
a real heart. But the artificial
heart, basically a pneumatic pump,
does not beat. Its pumping
system sends blood coursing
continually through a patient's
arteries and draws back blood from
the veins while maintaining the
correct blood pressure.
down that trials in man should be
based on animal experiments and on
such study of the natural history of the
disease as would raise the presump¬
tion that trial in man would lead to
important results and so be justifiable.
If this principle means that trials
should take place to verify acceptable
theories, it is undoubtedly useful.
But the requirement of preliminary
animal experimentation excludes psy-
chopharmacology as a whole.
T HE fourth and the sixth
to the tenth rules of Nuremberg spe¬
cify that any unnecessary suffering
and injury should be avoided and that
the experiment should be carried out
by a qualified experimenter. They
also provide that the subject of the
experiment should be free at any
moment to cut short the experiment
and that, if the experiment at a given
moment takes a dangerous turn, the
experimenter himself should stop it.
One of the Nuremberg principles,
the fifth, can be placed only in the
context of the trial of the Nazi crim¬
inals; it lays down that experiment
cannot presuppose the death or
invalidity of the subject unless the
subject is the experimenter himself.
It seems to us inadvisable to intro¬
duce any consideration of murder or
suicide into rules governing experi¬
ments on human subjects. Neverthe¬
less, the provision should be main¬
tained that, when the experiment
involves a foreseeable danger, there
is no alternative for the experimenter
but to try it on himself.
After the Nuremberg rules came the
Declaration of Helsinki, promulgated
by the World Medical Association in
1964. On the whole it corrects what
in the Nuremberg rules was circum¬
stantial, related to Nazi crimes, and
places those rules more correctly in
the context of generally accepted
medical traditions.
Whether research is clinical or not,
it should be based on laboratory and
animal experiments, and conducted
only by scientifically qualified persons
and under the supervision of a qua¬
lified medical man. The objective
should be in proportion to the inherent
risk to the subject, and there should be
a careful assessment of the inherent
risk in comparison to the foreseeable
benefits. Special caution should be
exercised when the personality of the
subject is liable to be altered by drugs
or experimental procedures.
The Declaration of Helsinki also
states that in the treatment of a sick
person the doctor must be free to
use a new therapeutic measure if in his
judgment it offers hope of saving life.
If at all possible, consistent with pa¬
tient psychology, he should obtain the
patient's freely given consent after the
patient has been given a full explana¬
tion. In case of legal incapacity, con¬
sent should also be procured from the
legal guardian.
With regard to non-therapeutic clini¬
cal research, the Declaration of Hel¬
sinki is very close to the Nuremberg
rules. It nevertheless specifies that
consent should as a rule be obtained
in writing after the subject has been
fully informed. The responsibility for
the experiment, however, always re¬
mains with the research worker.
The investigator must respect the
right of each individual to safeguard
his personal integrity, especially if the
subject is in a dependent relationship
to the investigator, as a student to his
teacher, a prisoner to society, or a
conscientious objector to justice. The
two sections of the Declaration of Hel¬
sinki can be considered separately.
The application of new therapeutic
measures is undoubtedly essential for
the progress of medicine, as no one
will deny, but it is impossible to state
categorically that such new therapeutic
methods have always been applied
with all the requisite precautions.
Generally, the methods are based on
judicious physiological reasoning and
adequate anatomical knowledge.
N ONE the less, the analysis
of the history of gastrojejunostomy
made by John A. Ryle, in his book,
"Changing Disciplines", proves with
ample detail that new methods are not
always sufficiently subjected to criti¬
cism or correctly tested statistically in
practice. As Ryle has stressed, treat¬
ed cases should be followed up for
several years, possibly as many as
ten, and most of the subjects treated
should be given a control examination
by competent investigators. The con¬
trols should preferably be carried out
by a small number of large, very well
equipped medical centres and in
accordance with standardized me¬
thods.
With regard to trials of very active
new drugs, as in the case of anti¬
biotics, there would obviously have
## [Page 23](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/058803engo.pdf#page=23) 🆗
### Medical experiments on man; round-table on the doctor's dilemma
been no Indication for delaying till the
end of a long control period their
employment in such serious illnesses
as septicaemia, meningitis, or endo¬
carditis. But a long control period
seems necessary where the illnesses
have a low mortality and spontaneous
cure may be mistaken for therapeutic
effect.
L ASAGNA, in his book
"The Doctor's Dilemma," cites the
case of a trial carried out on a group
of soldiers suffering from strepto¬
coccal sore throat, in which half
received sulfonamides and the other
half antibiotics. It was certainly not
possible at the time to foresee that
the subjects given sulfonamides would
not be protected against rheumatic
fever, but it was foreseeable that the
control group not receiving antibiotic
treatment would show an incidence of
about 3 per cent of that condition.
The control group should therefore
have been given penicillin, which was
already at that tirrve known to reduce
the incidence of rheumatic fever follow¬
ing streptococcal infection. A practice
also to be condemned is to subject
patients with a fatal prognosis to trials
of a kind not likely to improve their
condition.
In the United States of America, the
National Institutes of Health conti¬
nually carry out clinical research on
human beings at their enormous Cen¬
ter of Clinical Research. A Clinical
Research Committee studies the pro¬
jects of experimental research, which
cannot proceed without their previous
agreement.
A check of the same kind is made
before clinical research is under¬
taken in the medical centres of the
Atomic Energy Commission. Patients
are invited to go to the centres free,
but they are advised not to accept the
invitation unless they agree to submit
themselves to a period of research
in accordance with guidelines laid
down by the appropriate committees.
Non-therapeutic research is practis¬
ed on a large scale in certain countries,
the subjects seeking payment, or re¬
mission of punishment, for their parti¬
cipation or counterbalancing their posi¬
tion as conscientious objectors in
relation to military actions, or the like.
Although consent of the subject is
particularly necessary in these cases,
it is not sufficient to guarantee that
the rights of the Individual will be
respected.
A few years ago, an Inquiry was
carried out in Harvard Medical School
(U.S.A.), into persons appearing as
volunteers for experiments. It showed
that 60 per cent of them were mal¬
adjusted and had problems in adapting
themselves to their social environ¬
ment. Other inquiries have confirmed
that volunteers for experiments may,
from the psychological point of view,
differ considerably from the rest of
the population. This further compli¬
cates the concept of informed consent.
It could be held today that a doctor
sending consenting human beings to
the moon and back in accordance with
a plan popularized among the public
would not be different in his attitude
from the Nazi doctors who were tried
at Nuremberg (unless of course the
trip was a success).
This can be said today, when the
trial-and-error methods and the gamb¬
ling on success that were so long in
favour in space exploration have just
very recently become Inacceptable and
a preliminary programme of animal
experiment, especially on monkeys, is
being developed in that field.
If anyone, worried about the pro¬
tection of the individual in spite of a
lively interest in astronautics, had said
so a year ago, he would have been
considered a defeatist and a despiser
of both human courage and the skill of
the engineer.
T,HE need to improve the
cure rate in illness seems more and
more necessary, and it can only be
done with the help of trials on the
human being. It is conceivable that,
to ensure that the trials are conduct¬
ed in the closest possible accordance
with medical ethics, clinical research
should be carried out in particularly
well-equipped large clinical centres,
especially university hospitals. A cli¬
nical research committee, acquainted,
beforehand with research projects,
should approve them before they are
instituted; and the responsibility should
be not the experimenter's but that of
the clinical institution concerned or of
the State.
Whatever the methods and rules
might be, they can only be the fruit
of the constructive thinking of doctors
and the thousand-year old tradition of
medical ethics, and the objective is to
give medicine foundations that are
both more scientific and more humane.
A colony of the green mould called
Pénicillium chrysogenum (penicillin).
This antibacterial substance was
discovered in 1929 by the British

From mutations of the structure of
the original penicillin, chemists have
obtained over 500 related substances
that vanquish many forms of infection.

T HE term "human experimentation" raises a
sinister echo in each of us. But fear solves no scientific
problems. For my part, the recommendations of the WHO
Group that safety tests of new drugs should be carried out
on fully informed volunteers in conditions of almost absolute
security is more in conformity with the requirements of
ethics than the thousands of such trials hypocritically carried
out daily in hospitals in all countries on individuals who are
totally ignorant of what is being done to them.

T HE brain is the most wonderful organized
structure in the universe... The other remarkable thing
about the brain is that you can do very considerable
damage to It, make massive lesions In it, and you do not
get overt symptoms...
I would say, In relation to Investigations which are of a
dubious, or to my mind unallowable, kind, that a great
proportion of these investigations could be satisfactorily
done in primates; that there should be a great develop¬
ment of primate, and particularly anthropoid ape, inves¬
tigation centres. I do not say that everything can be done
on primates, but I would say that a great deal more should
be done before we subject man to these traumatic proce¬
dures under any conditions.
When you say that you fully explain something to the
subject, telling him what the lesion is or what he is going
to be subjected to, and he gives his consent, I do not
believe in the case of the brain that you can explain what
you are going to do, because none of us knows sufficient
about the brain to be able to say to a subject simply,
precisely and with assurance that this is all that it will do.

W E know today that very many pharmaceutical
preparations produce in the long run a whole series of
illnesses and disturbances. In this connexion, the con¬
clusions of a WHO Scientific Group were the following:
"The administration of biologically active substances to
human beings must always be accompanied by some
element of risk that cannot be avoided by the most careful
and exhaustive scientific study of the drug before it is
Introduced. The introduction of new drugs... should be
judged from an evaluation of the balance between benefit
and risk."

IN most of the developing countries, and espe¬
cially in Africa we find it extremely difficult to apply regu¬
lations and declarations based on experiences derived from
developed countries.
The use of psychopharmacological drugs in developing
countries is widespread and there is often abuse or indis¬
criminate use of the drugs, as also of antibiotics, narcotics,
analgesics. Practically every village in Africa today has
got some of these drugs, because of the indiscriminate
advertisements in the newspapers, on the radio, and so on.
And in fact some of the rural areas and the most remote
villages in Africa are completely invaded by the people who
sell these drugs. This again raises a great many questions,
difficulties and dilemmas for those of us who are involved
in medical practice and who are concerned with the philo¬
sophy and with the entire management of medicine.
We feel that there is an urgent need for young countries
to learn from the developed countries and to avoid the
mistakes which probably have been committed In most of
these highly sophisticated countries. In practice, we have
not been able to avoid some of them and there ¡s a great
room for flexibility and for original thinking.
The whole area of human rights is fundamental, but the
contents, the priorities, and the nature of the so-called
fundamental human rights may have to be altered to suit
the needs of young developing nations because of their
own evolution, and again this would raise quite a number of
problems problems which are religious, cultural, sociolo¬
gical, physiological, as well as questions which are entirely
local.

T.HERE is a need and necessity for experimentation
on patients with neoplastic disease [cancer] because no
experimental animal tumour model system is directly com¬
parable to cancer in man. The therapeutic or physiologic
studies should have a formal protocol which can be
evaluated by others competent in oncology [the study of
tumours].
The results should be systematically collected and also
be subjected to objective scrutiny. The consent of the
patient should be obtained, but the investigator and society
should understand that this gives recognition of the status
of the subject as a person and does not constitute a true
informed agreement by the patient involved.

### Medical experiments on man; round-table on the doctor's dilemma
THE SCIENTISTS SPEAK UP (Continued)
The patient with incurable cancer is not a hopeless case.
No special liberties should be taken in the use of such
subjects in clinical research. In my opinion such patients
should not be utilized in studies of potential value to
mankind without relevance to their own disease problem.
The cancer patient must be accorded the same status
as a person as any other human. To do otherwise places
cancer in the category of the leprosy of past centuries; it
is an expression of the lack of Information of the medical
profession in the management of disseminated neoplastic
disease.
Finally, the use of human subjects for research in which
there is any real risk and from which results relevant to
the subject cannot be expected is, I believe, a danger to
the ethical fibre of the investigator, introducing an attitude
of carelessness to the welfare of a fellow human being
which ultimately could destroy his value as a physician.

I have heard people talk for years past of the
absolute necessity of the patient being completely informed
about new drugs being tried on him. In my field of work,
hypertensive disease, which involves a large number of
functional disturbances, therapeutic trials are difficult to
carry out if the patient is fully informed of the disturbances
he might have. If we tell him about all the real, but extre¬
mely rare, disturbances he might experience during an inves¬
tigation or the trial of a new form of treatment, we are faced
with either a blank refusal to take the test or undergo the
investigation or, on the other hand, the appearance of the
disturbances we fear. I should like some means to be
found of testing drugs with an unquestionable action in valid .
conditions, while maintaining the freedom of the individual,
not endangering his life, and keeping the conscience of the
experimenter clear.
authorities such experiments should be strictly forbidden;
in all such experiments man should be replaced by animals.
The great danger must be pointed out of sacrificing
human beings on the altar of science and glorifying
subjects who volunteer to be guinea-pigs. Someone has
written that voluntary death of that kind is not suicide but
a sacrifice in the service of science. Such a view is the
more dangerous because it exalts the spirit of sacrifice
as an ideal. But the real ideal places the value of human
life above all.
However, it must be said that not all experiments
jeopardize the life of the subject. Is an experiment on a
healthy person that involves little risk acceptable? Many
authorities say yes, on the absolute condition that the
subject is a volunteer.
The proof of consent has given rise to differences of
opinion. To begin with, most experiments in biomedicine
are so technical in their details that the subject cannot
understand them. When the experiments are such as to
involve the subject in a real danger, the question of the
volunteer is very controversial. In France, free consent
in those circumstances mostly conflicts with our respect
for human individuality in life.
Trials on themselves by the experimenters are debatable.
Pasteur wrote in 1884: "I have not yet tried to treat people
after they have been bitten by mad dogs, but the time
to do so is perhaps not far off and I am very tempted
to begin with myself, that is, to inoculate the rabies and
then stop its effects, so much have I become seasoned and
sure of my results."
I shall say nothing about the clinical trials that have
been carried out on prisoners condemned to death or on
civil prisoners in for a term of years. To me they seem
to be contrary to the moral concepts of the human person.

| N Austria therapeutic experiments are permitted
in university clinics, but the law forbids them in other hos¬
pitals. Thus the patient admitted to a university hospital
knows that new procedures not yet In current use may be
used for his benefit. This being the case, it is unnecessary
to inform him fully; nor is it possible when a new procedure
is being utilized. In any case the surgeons, even in current
practice, do not tell their patients that an accident occurs
in every 10,000 cases. It is undesirable that the patient
should know everything, and that is indeed the problem
involved in his being informed of a trial to be carried out
on him.

I N each "therapeutic" case the decision is one
for the conscience of the doctor, who must weigh the
risks to his patient and compare them with the risks arising
from his doing nothing at all. At present, the most charac¬
teristic example is that of the extraordinary rapid progress
of organ transplantation surgery.
Experiments on healthy people are an entirely different
matter. Their sole aim is to advance medical science and
they raise a large number of questions. For a great many
ÏÏ E have some experience with law relating to the
regulation of animal experimentation, in the operation of the
British Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876. British biologists
are in agreement that the Act has had at least one out¬
standingly useful result. It has relieved them of day-to-day
harassment by anti-vivisectionists. It has also undoubtedly
been useful in impressing upon students and working
scientists, the need to exercise care to avoid pain and
distress in the animals they use.
On the other side of the coin, however, it has, I believe,
greatly hampered medical education because of the res¬
trictions and bars that it places on the use of higher animals
by students and also the bars It places on the use of such
animals by surgeons-in-training, and it has virtually barred
the performance of a number of types of scientific study
of animals. Animal experimentation is of such importance
to safe clinical investigation that it should never be unwisely
Impeded.
It may be of Interest to point out that British law In
general is very permissive with respect to the use of human
subjects in scientific study while it is highly restrictive with
regard to the use of animals. The great interest in animal
welfare is not limited to Great Britain. In the United States
today, for example, no popular national movement exists to
lobby for regulation of clinical investigation on human sub¬
jects, while at least three very well-supported national
organizations are clamouring for additional legislation to
regulate animal experimentation.
The public has a large interest in avoiding the establish¬
ment of conditions which would cripple clinical Investigation.
It also obviously has a great interest in protecting the rights
of individuals. But all unnecessary red tape should be cut
and necessary controls should be exercised with the advice
of the most competent scientists available to give it.

In all clinical investigation in which there is any risk to
the subjects studied, prior extensive study on many species
of lower animals is a sine qua non to safety. Consequently
every one concerned about human welfare should be equally
solicitous about maintaining freedom of investigators in the
humane use of lower animals in scientific study.
kidneys. I think that this is an important example. I think
that at present all countries where kidney grafts are
commonly and successfully carried out should have regu¬
lations protecting the rights of donors and also of the
medical profession. At the moment, there Is on the whole
some illegality In their position.

I HE problem of the voluntary donor of a kidney
graft may appear a model for the problems with which we
are dealing. On the one hand there is a risk for the donor
of 0.12 per cent and on the other a probability of operative
success of as much as 75 per cent.
In such circumstances, have we the right to accept- the
voluntary gift of the donor? Tradition says no, both moral
tradition and legislation in most countries holding that it is
not permissible to carry out an operationin -this case a
nephrectomy on a subject when it is not for the benefit of
the subject himself. But in recent years, I think, everyone
has come to agree that in the particular case of the graft
of an organ to save a human being about to die such a
tradition should not be maintained. All the thinkers and
doctors who have dealt with the problem find nothing
illegitimate in accepting that a subject should take a
reasonable risk to save someone dear to him.
But it is necessary that the doctor should verify two
things: first, that there is a reasonable balance between the
risk and the probability of success, and second, that the
volunteer ¡s a real volunteer...

I have the feeling that there ¡s a great deal of
duplication going on at the moment in clinical investigation.
I would not say that it should be a government regulation,
because I think this would hamper the free development of
research, but the Idea of having a group of experts, not
connected directly with the investigation, to review the
problem and issue a licence or give permission, or
something like that, seems to me very sensible.
The teaching of clinical pharmacology should .be estab¬
lished at every medical faculty. Postgraduate courses on
the techniques and the responsibilities of clinical inves¬
tigation should be organized regularly for the more senior
people of the group as well. Because the techniques and
the possibilities of investigation are improving every day,
new methods come up and the research groups have to be
informed about them.
I think that, if a human experiment is undertaken, only
the best and the most modern techniques should be
allowed. The planning of clinical investigation should be
submitted to a review by a knowledgeable body of experts
In the particular field Involved. And duplication of human
experimentation should be avoided if possible, at least
within one country, and later if possible in the whole world.

TRANSPLANTS :
THE SOCIAL DILEMMA
Leader by Dr. Dennis Melrose
"Science Journal", Feb. 1968
The ethical problems raised by our
ability to transplant human organs are
symptomatic of a much more funda¬
mental advance: man's new ability to
control the course of his own evolu¬
tion. . .
So far, [biology] has revealed rela¬
tively little about how to overcome the
immunological rejection of transplant¬
ed tissues.
When, and if, it does we shall have
to face a series of complex ethical
and legal issues which cannot lightly
be brushed aside. Should organs such
as the' heart be taken from patients
who are alive but incurable? Should
they be taken only from patients who
are dead and, if so, with what can
we replace our now totally obsolete
definition of death? If doctors are
forced to make such decisions, how
are they to reconcile this with their
implied undertaking to strive ceaseless¬
ly for the life of one patient and not to
follow courses of action which they
personally believe to be for the most
good of most people?
I do not pretend to know the an¬
swers. But, perhaps more important,
I do not believe that the answers
should come from experts involved in
the technical issues. Ultimately, they
must come from society from the
people who are to donate and to re¬
ceive transplanted organs. . .
Here, then, is the crux of one of the
most pressing problems raised by
modern biology. The scientists whose
work gives rise to these issues in
the first place cannot disclaim all
responsibility for them. Equally, they
themselves cannot dictate solutions to
democratic societies. Where, then, is
the machinery for exposing these sit¬
uations which are certain to become
more and more common and where
is the machinery for taking action to
meet them? Sadly, it does not yet
exist. Our ability to control our own
evolution, as Aldous Huxley rightly
predicted, has overtaken our ability to
direct its course in the most meaning¬
ful way.
THE ETHICS OF
THE CLINICAL TRIALS
OF DRUGS
By Sir Derrick Dunlop
" The Medical Journal of Australia",
March 4. 1967
There is a general tendency to admit
as ethically acceptable the uncontrol¬
led experimentation with unproven
drugs to which unsuspecting patients
have been continually exposed in ordi¬
nary practice; but if in Britain a consul¬
tant in hospital. . . carries out a care¬
fully planned trial in hospital, that is apt
to be regarded by certain people as
treating like guinea-pigs National Ser¬
vice patients who have right to better
things, and questions may be asked
in the House of Commons about it.
There must always be some patient
or group of patients who receive a new
drug for the first time; it is surely de¬
sirable that this should happen under
careful observation by experts in hos¬
pital and that the experience of such
patients should be made of value to
others. . .
It is therefore not surprising that
various authorities have attempted to
draft codes of ethics to govern human
experimentation the Nuremberg Code,
the Report of the World Medical Asso¬
ciation and that of the British Medical
Research Council. While it is possible
to enunciate some very broad rather
platitudinous principles, which are
really intrinsic to the doctor's training,
it is doubtful whether precise rules
can be framed applicable to all the
immensely varying circumstances of
clinical trials, about which it is easy
to generalise and so difficult to parti¬
cularize. . . A rigid ethical ideal may
be too restrictive when one is facing
real-life problems.
ETHICS, CONSENT AND
CONTROLLED CLINICAL
TRIAL
By Maxwell Finland
"Journal of the American Medical
Association ". Nov. 7, 1966
Considerable interest has been fo¬
cused recently on the moral, ethical,
and legal issues involved in human
experimentation. . .
The more recent thalidomide tragedy
spurred the provision of many new
regulations to insure the efficacy as
well as the safety of drugs. In each
of these instances, the uncovering of
some major tragedy, and scrutiny of
the events leading to it, have resulted
in a wider scope of investigation,
which revealed other improprieties
and, in turn, led to broader and
stronger restrictions in the laws and
into the regulations provided for ¡n>
plementing them. . .
Among the recent fallout of these
explosive events, have come some
broad accusations as well as specific
indictments of immoral and unethical
practices in studies carried out by un¬
named but readly indentifiable investi¬
gators. . . Many thoughtful and res¬
ponsible individuals involved in the
current discussions have expressed
concern that, as a result of all this
turmoil, restrictions may stifle further
scientific pursuits essential for im¬
provements in our understanding,
management, and prevention of the
ills of man. . .
MEDICAL ETHICS
Editorial by I. H. Page
" Science ". July 22, 1966
The sanctity of the human body has
long been considered inviolate, as has
the relationship between patient and
physician. It is just on these questions
that the problem of consent for ope¬
rations, drug testing, organ transplanta¬
tion, and experimentation has hit a
snag. Despite millions of words, we
are no closer to solving such prob¬
lems than we were before the Ke-
fauver investigation. Indeed, we have
managed to hide our dilemma by the
simple device of word coverage. . .
In the present circumstances, all of
us might well consult the ancient Hip-
pocratic Oath. It reads in part as
follows: "The regimen I shall adopt
shall be for the benefit of my patients
according to my ability and judgment,
and not for their hurt or for any
wrong. . . Whatsoever house I enter,
there will I go for the benefit of the
sick, refraining from all wrongdoing or
corruption. . . Whatsoever things I see
or hear concerning the life of men,
in my attendance on the sick or even
apart therefrom, which ought not to be
noised abroad, I will keep silence
thereon, counting such things to be
as sacred secrets."
Those words have been a guiding
light for medicine for 2,500 years.
Does not their spirit provide a beacon
reliable for both today and tomorrow?
ETHICAL ISSUES
IN RESEARCH WITH
HUMAN SUBJECTS
By W. Wolfensberger
"Science", Jan. 6, 1967
We have now arrived at a point
in the evolution of science at which
both scientists and the intelligent lay
public consider universality of pro¬
cedure, approval by peers, sharing of
risks, and even use of volunteers ques¬
tionable or even unacceptable and un¬
ethical in some research situations. . .
There is a danger that, if scientists
do not respond to the public's concern
about research conduct, research rules
will be imposed on science from with¬
out. Such rules may be formulated
in an emotional atmosphere; may be
selective, inconsistent, and inadequate;
and may be enacted into law in such
a fashion as to be unnecessarily bur¬
densome, restrictive and rigid or even
absurd. . .

### Non-article text
Medical researchers consider experiments on animals
indispensable to progress in medicine. Here, lymph (a liquid
surrounding all body cells) is being collected from a
rat in the biological laboratory of a cancer research institute.
The great French biologist, Louis Pasteur, wrote ¡n 1884, when
working on a vaccine against rabies: "It is only when I am
sure that I can successfully innoculate a number of dogs after
they have been bitten that I shall dare to innoculate a
human being. And even then my hand will tremble, for what Is
possible in the case of a dog may not be so when it comes to a
human being. However, I shall have no further scientific scruples."
In 1964, the World Medical Association affirmed In its
Declaration of Helsinki that "clinical research should be based
on laboratory and animal experiments or other scientifically
established facts."

much more complex to master than
man-machine problems. But the ex¬
change of information between doc¬
tors of various countries has become
much easier. The world has grown
smaller because of the impact of the
computer on instantaneous translation
and because of Improved communica¬
tions. A universal medical language
and common vocabulary is nearly
established.
The computer industry has become
as important to life in the year 2000 as
the automobile used to be. Many Indi¬
viduals in society are engaged in
producing and servicing computers,
while others develop systems of com¬
munications and expand the range of
commands and controls.
As well as being used in the health
service, computers have had their
impact on leisure time, for personal
computer education in many subjects
has led to an overall advance in
human knowledge. This has had its
impact on the medical services, for
many patients have had the benefit of
health education using special com¬
puter programmes of instruction.
Also the general level of medical
knowledge has been considerably
improved by. better instruction at
school and in the health centres using
computer techniques. The increased
awareness and knowledge of the prob¬
lems of preventing disease have made
it possible to educate patients to alter
their habits so that they lead healthier
and fuller lives.
Preservation of mental and emo¬
tional well-being has become a major
objective in health services. Computer
techniques have enabled man to
explore mental mechanisms and emo¬
tional problems further, once a proper
vocabulary was accepted. Much more
information about the inheritance and
acquisition of emotional traits through¬
out life has been obtained using
computers to record and analyse the
large amount of data available.
Doctors and nurses still advise,
comfort and treat their patients. The
mysteries of disease have not all
vanished and many difficult problems
remain. Yet the computer has proved
an essential tool in dealing with the
many details which would otherwise
take a great deal of human labour,
reducing the economic problem of car¬
ing for the sick to measurable propor¬
tions. It is only the use of computer
techniques at an advanced level that
has made advances in health services
possible without increasing national
expenditure and ultimately the burden
on everyone's budget.

Cardiovascular
diseases

Cardiovascular diseases are major
killers in highly developed countries.
In 1967, a WHO study of 23 industrializ¬
ed countries showed heart diseases
as the leading cause of death; heart
diseases and "strokes" were res¬
ponsible for more than 45 per cent of
all deaths. With the rise of the stan¬
dard of living, developing countries
may soon be confronted with similar
problems.
Some cardiovascular diseases are
found everywhere, others only in cer¬
tain geographic areas or among iden¬
tifiable groups of people. Comparative
studies are under way in Jamaica, in
the Polynesian islands, in Peru, among
people living at high altitudes, and
elsewhere.
WHO also studies spontaneously
occurring conditions in animals com¬
parable to cardiovascular diseases in
humans. Certain primates are excel¬
lent models for human atherosclerosis
of the aorta and coronary vessels while
some birds develop lesions similar to
those in humans.
Cancer
According to WHO, the number of
deaths from cancer throughout the
world increased from 2,175,000 in
1950-62 to 2,623,000 in 1958-60
an increase of some 20 per cent.
Cancer is the second leading cause
of death after cardiovascular diseases
in highly developed countries. The
number of persons now living who have
cancer (before, during and after treat¬
ment) is over 5 million. For every new
case of cancer found in mass screen¬
ing programmes, there are 3 to 4 cases
with a pre-cancerous condition.
In an attempt to find causes, WHO
initiates comparative studies; for
example, to discover why Norway and
Finland, alike in so many ways, differ
greatly in the incidence of lung cancer.
WHO created the International Agency
for Research on Cancer in Lyons,
France, in 1965, which is particularly
concerned with the causes and epi¬
demiology of cancer. In addition, WHO
established a world-wide network of
international reference centres for
classifying and studying tumours.
Mental
health
Mental illness rates rise as man goes
to live in the city. Suicide is among
the first ten causes of death in many
countries and the rates for attempted
suicide are increasing. A survey of
85 countries revealed a critical short¬
age of psychiatrists. Eight had none
at all and in another 35, with a total
population of 890 million, there was
less than one to 200,000 people.
There is also an alarming increase
in alcoholism and drug abuse involv¬
ing depressants, stimulants and hal¬
lucinogens such as LSD. The trend is
toward a combined approach to the
problems of dependence on alcohol
and other drugs; a WHO Expert Com
mittee pointed out the similar ties in
cause and treatment as well as the
frequent transfer from one drug to
another.
Venereal
disease
This is on the rise and has reached
post-World War II levels in some coun¬
tries. There are about 60-65 million
new cases of gonococcal infection each
year. Syphilis is also increasing and
a careful U.S. survey discovered that
only about 11.3 per cent of cases of
infectious syphilis were reported.
WHO has provided direct assistance
to strengthen VD control in 40 coun¬
tries, granted training fellowships and
research grants. In 1966 reference
strains of gonococci were distributed
to national laboratories from the newly-
established WHO Reference Centre for
Gonococci in Copenhagen.
International
quarantine
Of the six quarantinable diseases,
two, typhus and relapsing fever, seem
to present no longer any international
danger and may soon be dropped
from the list of diseases subject to
quarantine. The situation for the four
others is:
Plague, after declining in the late
fifties, is on the upswing; the Repub¬
lic of Viet-Nam is the hardest hit
with 4,532 suspected cases reported
in 1967. No vaccine has yet been
developed as an effective preventive
measure. The plague does not seem
to be spreading internationally, but
vigilance is necessary.
Yellow fever still

### How's the world's health?
3,000 deaths in 1961. Yet yellow
fever vaccine affords complete pro¬
tection.
Smallpox seems to be rising again.
Here again proper vaccination is effec¬
tive and WHO is tightening up the
regulations. The International Certifi¬
cate of Vaccination against smallpox
now requires vaccine up to WHO
standards and the origin and batch
number of vaccine used; a doctor's
signature is also needed.
Cholera is on the march and in Asia
it has been reported from the Philip¬
pines in the East to Iran and Iraq in
the West. Vaccines are only partially
effective.
International
sanitary
regulations
WHO constantly reviews the Inter¬
national Sanitary Regulations in an
attempt to keep them abreast of world
conditions. The new health regulations
for international trade and travel will
go into effect, if approved by the World
Health Assembly, as of May 1968.
They will extend medical health ser¬
vices not only in international ports
and airports but inland wherever large
movements of population occur. The
object remains to speed trade and tra¬
vel while safeguarding health.
Tuberculosis
Some 15 million people still suffer
from active tuberculosis and may infect
some 50 million children and adoles¬
cents. More than three-quarters of
these cases are In developing coun¬
tries. Each year two or three million
new cases appear and between one
and two million people die of this
disease. Yet the past 20 years have
seen a quiet revolution in dealing with
this disease. New knowledge has led
to new techniques which now offer
hope to poorer countries fighting tu¬
berculosis.
Each effective immunization with
BCG costs as little as 10 to 20 cents.
The discovery of INH (isoniazid)
allowed a major change in treatment.
Today, patients can leave hospitals
and by taking this medicine return to
a more normal life in the community.
A WHO Expert Committee stressed
new techniques which through com¬
plete immunization and ambulatory
chemotherapy could reduce tuberculo¬
sis to a minor public health problem
within the next two or three decades.
Malaria
Malaria is on the retreat: 1,304 mil¬
lion or 78 per cent of the people liv¬
ing in originally malarious areas are
now protected from the disease. Ma¬
laria has been eradicated from very
large parts of the Americas and all
of continental Europe. By 1967, 90
per cent of India's population was liv¬
ing in areas freed from the transmis¬
sion of malaria. Yet trouble areas
remain.
Malaria is still the major health
problem in Africa south of the Sahara;
more than half the children under
three and virtually all of the population
over that age is affected.
There have been setbacks and re-
introduction of malaria in various re¬
gions. Resistance to DDT has been
observed In mosquitoes. Some prog¬
rammes have slowed down or stopped
for lack of funds. Yet success must
be total since even one case can
start the cycle of re-infection again.
Increasing productivity and decreas¬
ing the amount spent on medicine and
lost through illness may prove to be
the best investment the world com¬
munity has made.
Quinine for malaria used to cost
Greece $1,300,000 a year; fighting
disease with DDT in the 1950s only
$300,000. Results: since 1960 no
deaths have been reported, land has
been reclaimed, labour is more produc¬
tive and the rate of malaria has
dropped to zero.
Since 1955, WHO has embarked on
the first disease eradication venture
¡a history and man's largest public
health project world-wide malaria
eradication. Regardless of how 'long
it takes, WHO goes ahead with its
world-wide programme for eliminating
malaria.
Smallpox
Smallpox can be eliminated: Yet up
to 100,000 cases are still reported
annually. Seventy per cent of the
world's cases reported in 1966
occurred in South-East Asia and the
disease remains endemic in all coun¬
tries in Africa south of the Sahara and
many other countries.
Three areas remain free of small¬
pox Europe, North and Central Ame¬
rica and the Western Pacific.
Individually, in co-operation with
others, and now under a world-wide
programme launched by WHO in 1967,
nations are fighting smallpox and they
are pushing it back. Burma, for exam¬
ple, began eradication in 1962 and by
1966 did not have a single case to
report. India and Pakistan have mass
campaigns well under way already
producing results.
Jet injectors, pistol-like machines
which project vaccine at high pres¬
sure, already in use in Africa and
Brazil, allow up to 1,000 vaccinations
in an hour. WHO has set up an emer¬
gency stock of vaccine and jet injec¬
tors in Geneva which can be flown in
a few days to any disease-free area
menaced by the re-introduction of
smallpox.
Smallpox-free countries are helping
with gifts of vaccine, particularly the
U.SA and the U.S.S.R., but 1,100 mil¬
lion people run the risk of smallpox
and about 2,000 million vaccinations
and revaccinatiohs are needed for the
ten-year period.
Polio
and measles
Although poliomyelitis has practi¬
cally disappeared from one half of the
world in 16 countries in Europe with
good immunization campaigns the
average annual incidence of polyomye- Q1
litis from 1961-64 dropped by about 01
99 per cent it may be increasing in
the other half as environmental con-

ditions in the developing countries
change. The use of vaccines in such
countries has brought to light problems
of organization and also of the effec¬
tiveness of vaccine which have not
been solved. Polio vaccine seems
to be less potent under tropical con¬
ditions.
Measles vaccine, though effective,
costs too much for most of the coun¬
tries where measles still represents
an important cause of death in child¬
hood.
WHO has been actively associated
witn the development and testing of
poliomyelitis and measles vaccines,
two of the most effective immunizing
agents yet produced. More work will
be necessary to adapt them to the
difficult climatic and economic con¬
ditions that affect more than half of
the world's population.
Leprosy
About 11 million
cases in the world
yet the number or
registered patients
is only a little more
than 2.8 million and
of these about
1.9 million receive
treatment. Almost
four million people are disabled by the
disease.
Water, basic to life
Contaminated water spreads many
diseases, directly and indirectly through
breeding insect-carriers. Typhoid,
cholera, amoebic and bacillary dysen¬
tery are some of the illnesses trans¬
mitted by dirty water.
In the developing countries infectious
and parasitic diseases rank as the
principle cause of death. Chief among
them are diseases of the gastro-intes¬
tinal tract which account for a majority
of diagnosed deaths in most of the
17 countries studied by WHO in Africa,
South and Central America and Asia.
It is estimated that one out of four
hospital beds in the world may be
occupied by someone suffering from
such water and filth-borne diseases;
they are also one of the chief killers
of infants and children in developing
countries.
WHO is the executing agency for a
number of United Nations Development
Programme Special Fund projects
which draw up engineering and feasibi¬
lity reports covering sewerage and
ratepaying as well as water supply; the
plans for Accra-Tema in Ghana, where
a rapidly growing urban and industrial
area of 500,000 inhabitants is expected
to reach 1.5 million by 1980, are a good
example. Work is also going ahead
on master plans for Calcutta, Istanbul,
Kampala and Malta; in 1967, there
were 207 WHO-assisted projects in
83 countries.
If only clean water could be supplied
to everyone, diseases which kill and
sicken millions could be eliminated
without medicine, without mass cam¬
paigns or wonder drugs.
Parasitic
diseases
An estimated 200 million people are
affected by shistosomiasis (bilharzia-
sis), 190 million with filariasis (which
may cause elephantiasis), 450 million
with hookworm, 50 million with oncho¬
cerciasis (river blindness) and seven
million with Chaga's disease (a form
of sleeping sickness confined to the
Americas).
Trypanosomi¬
asis (African sleeping
sickness) makes
agriculture and
stock-raising impos¬
sible over more than
ten million square
kilometres of fertile
land in Africa.
WHO tries to apply the most modern
medical and scientific findings to
control parasitic diseases and prevent
their spread. Unfortunately, labora¬
tory and field research is hampered by
the scarcity of trained national staff.
Therefore, their training in the use of
effective new techniques is receiving
high priority.
Trachoma
The world's most
common cause of
blindness affects as
many as 400 million
people.
On guard
against pollution
WHO is helping to establish world¬
wide networks to monitor air pollution
and to check the levels of radioactivity
to which populations are exposed;
longterm effects of low doses of radio¬
activity are also being studied. Water
pollution is another major source of
concern and activity.
Children
in peril
In developing countries Infant mor¬
tality may be ten times higher than that
in advanced countries; rates for mor¬
tality may be ten times higher than that
may be thirty to forty times higher.

Letters to the Editor
CASIMIR ZORAWSK1
AND MARIE SKLODOWSKA
Sir,
I enjoyed reading the article by
Professor Leopold Infeld ("Maria
Sklodowska: The Dreamer in War¬
saw") in your Oct. 1967 issue, and
notably the account of the part played
by my grandfather in Maria Sklo-
dowska-Curie's decision to take up a
scientific career.
May I point out a slight error. My
grandfather's name was'not Karol, but
Konimierz (Casimir), and his surname
was spelt Zorawski (phonetically: Ju-
ravski). In addition to the theorem in
hydromechanics mentioned in the arti¬
cle, my grandfather's achievements in
science comprised some 70 works in
pure mathematics and the application
of differential equations to geometry
and physics.
Casimir Zorawski's scientific accom¬
plishments led to his appointment as
professor and later dean and rector
of the Jagellonian University, Cracow.
He also became an honorary pro¬
fessor at the University of Warsaw
and was made a member of the Polish
Academy of Sciences and Letters and
of the Czech Royal Association of
Sciences and Letters as well as an
honorary member of the Polish Aca¬
demy of Sciences in Warsaw.

'MAHABHARATA'
WITH 5,000 PAGE INDEX
Sir,
I read and admired your splendid
issue devoted to the Mahabharata and
the Ramayana (Dec. 1967). Through
the International Council for Philoso¬
phy and Humanistic Studies, Unesco
has made and continues to make a
major contribution to the planning and
publication of a multi-volume annotat¬
ed edition of the Mahabharata. Spon¬
sored by numerous universities and
by the governments of several Indian
states, the edition has been prepared
by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute in Poona, India. This edition
of the Mahabharata, which is the
world's longest literary composition
(eight times the size of the Iliad and
Odyssey combined), comprises 22 vol¬
umes totalling 13,000 pages. The
22 volumes have been published, and
it now remains to prepare the index
to the work. This alone will be a
formidable task since the index is
expected to cover about 5,000 pages.

TWO GREAT EPICS OF ASIA
Sir,
Congratulations and thank you for
your truly excellent issue which fea
tured the Ramayana and the Maha¬
bharata. I have been a long time
admirer and enthusiastic supporter of
the "Unesco Courier". I believe that
your magazine is one of the very best
sources for helping teachers and stu¬
dents to develop empathy about peo¬
ples and cultures.

Sir,
I have seen the special issue of the
"Unesco Courier" on the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata and find it extre¬
mely well done and Impressive. Please
accept my most sincere congratu¬
lations. I am sure that this issue
will have the greatest success in the
world and will contribute to a better
understanding of Indian culture.

FOR ' BHAGAVAD GITA'
READ ' BHAGAVATA'
Sir,
I should like to point out a small
misprint which has crept into my arti¬
cle "Kathakali and the Dance Drama
of India" (Dec. 1967). The word Bha-
gavata in the original has come out
as Bhagavad Gita in print. Bhagavad
Gita is only an episode and part of
the Mahabharata whereas Bhagavata
is one of the famous eighteen Pura-
nas. Therefore the word Bhagavad
Gita, wherever it appears in the print¬
ed article, should be read as Bhaga¬
vata.

EXPLOITATION OF
GEOTHERMAL POWER
Sir,
You may be interested in recent
research conducted here at Wairakei,
New Zealand, into the exploitation of
geothermal fields for electric power.
At present a power station producing
175 MW (electric) is drawing about
70 million tons per year of fluid from
a pressurised hot water aquifer while
a second area is under study for
such employment.
The first research result concerns
the determination of an optimum well¬
head pressure for all types of reser¬
voir, whether containing superheat¬
ed steam as in Italy and California
or hot water as in New Zealand,
Mexico, U.S.S.R., Japan, El Salvador,
the Phillipines, etc. As the latter kind
of reservoir is by far the more
common and exploitation would be
considered where the water tempera
ture exceeds 200 C, the fixing of
the wellhead pressure at 75 Ib/sq In.
gauge has a very wide application
and not only increases the life of the
field but reduces capital costs. This
work has recently been published.
The second investigation, applicable
to hot water reservoirs, is concerned
with the future transmission of con¬
current steam-water mixtures through
long pipelines, of 3 foot diameter,
connecting the production field to the
power station. Such large scale two-
phase transmission has never been
attempted before, but both theory and "
recent confirmatory tests Indicate that
there is no particular difficulty involv¬
ed such as that due to the effects
of water hammer or cavitation. The
results show that a staggering sev¬
enty per cent increase in power can
be obtained compared with the Wai¬
rakei system and this will lead to a
significant reduction in the cost per
kilowatt for a second generation plant.
As the majority of geothermal re¬
gions are of the hot water type and
are often situated in relatively remote
underdeveloped areas, the importance
of such reduction in costs and the
maximising of the power-life cannot
be too strongly emphasized espe¬
cially for the emerging countries.

THE AFRICAN GENIUS
Sir,
I wish to say how much I enjoyed
"Africa and the African genius" (June
1967). I was all the more disappoint¬
ed to find your list of books in "Afri¬
can Bookshelf" so unbalanced. One
would almost think that Africa had
no geography. Whatever the "Genius
of Africa" it is surely rooted almost
as much in the land as in the people.

small selection of the thousands of

NOISE POLLUTION
Sir,
Your July 1967 issue described many
kinds of "noise pollution". Every two
years, on the occasion of a large
exhibition in my home town, helicopter
flights take place, and day after day
the ugly "birds" swoop low over
the roofs, over schools and hospitals.
Thus for the pleasure of a few many
have to suffer in terms of health and
tranquility, and schoolchildren cannot
concentrate on their lessons.

From the Unesco New
Atomic power station
beyond the Arctic Circle
An atomic power station now being built
in the Soviet Far North, on the Kola penin¬
sula between the Arctic Ocean and the
White Sea, will be the most powerful in
the U.S.S.R. At present 500,000 cubic
metres of rock are being removed to make
place for its foundations, and work has
been going on throughout the Polar dark¬
ness under the glare of searchlights.
Over 341 ,000 students abroad
More than 341 ,000 young people are

(Vol.XVII: 1968-70; $5.00, 25/-). The U.S.A.,
France, Fed. Rep. of Germany, U.S.S.R.
and U.K. together are responsible for
almost half of all foreign student enrol¬
ments and 40 per cent of all fellowships.
"Study Abroad" lists (in English, French and
Spanish) some 215,000 fellowships offered
through the 1969-70 school year.
Taught by
top scientists
The Municipal Service of National Edu¬

organized a hew scheme to arouse interest
in modern science among secondary school
students, by inviting top Soviet scientists
and Academicians to give special courses
in physics, chemistry, biology, micro-biology
and mathematics. The experiment is proving
highly successful in broadening students'
knowledge and in inspiring students to
specialize in scientific subjects.

PLASTIC LUNGS FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH
Plastic casts of blood vessels and air pas¬
sages in the lungs are now being produced
to help medical research in pulmonary dis¬
eases. Cast is made by injecting liquid
plastic under pressure into all or part of
a lung removed by surgery. When plastic
hardens lung tissue is removed leaving a
perfect three-dimensional cast. This per¬
mits a fine analysis of the arterial, veinous
and bronchial tube circulation in the lung
and enables doctors to study how lesions
are formed and develop. Study of casts
has helped to localize by X-ray, lung absces¬
ses, thrombosis and other diseases. Photo
shows scientist examining plastic bronchial
tubes. Some casts have been made of
blood vessels so tiny that they are visible
only through an electron microscope.
