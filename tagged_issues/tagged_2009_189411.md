Climate Change: 
where are we going?
The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) 
now taking place in Copenhagen (Denmark) 
is deciding the fate of the planet. Everyone agrees 
on the substance: only a concerted global effort 
can meet the climate challenge. 
But when it comes to form, opinions diverge.
Listening to all the voices, taking all interests into account 
and drafting an agreement based on principles 
that everyone can endorse - this is the ethical approach 
UNESCO advocates in the face of climate change.

from The UNESCO Courier n° 2009-10.

We must respond  
to climate change today
The climate is changing — faster than ever. 
Since the beginning of time, Earth’s climate 
has been changing. From warm periods to 
cold, life has had to adapt and evolve. But now 
human activities are having an effect on the 
dynamics of the planet itself.4
turn off the lights  
please! 
Scholars have not paid adequate attention  
to the equity implications of climate change, 
but now there is growing awareness  
about this ethical issue, says Indian expert  
Rajendra Pachauri, chairrman of the IPCC.7

Connie Hedegaard firmly believes that COP 15 
must conclude with an agreement  
on reductions of carbon dioxide emissions. 
Even if the outcome is not a legally binding 
agreement the future of the planet hangs  
in the balance of this conference.8
coming to terms  
With climate change
Only very occasionally do scientific discoveries 
evoke such a dramatic – and emotive -  
response as that elicited by the last decades’ 
research documenting global climate change 
and identifying human activities  
as its likely primary cause. 10
building an effective  
and just climate agreement
As industrialized countries are responsible for 
70% of the tons of carbon dioxide emitted into 
the atmosphere since the start of the industrial 
revolution, they have incurred a debt that must 
be repaid, according to Indian environmentalist 
Sunita Narain.11
refugees of the future Will be 
‘climate refugees’
Climate change will not be felt by all countries 
in the same way. Developing countries are 
more vulnerable because of their lower  
capacity to respond to climate change.  
This will likely enhance the large imbalances 
across countries and increase friction. 14
kenya:  
burning sun and dusty soil
Severe droughts have left East Africa in short 
supply of water and food. Climate expert  
Dr. Dominic Walubengo took us on a road trip 
to the heart of Maasai country to demonstrate 
how climate change is affecting the rural  
population of Kenya. 17
record-breaking china
China, along with the United States, is the 
world’s largest producer of CO2. The country 
is not ready to commit to an emission  
reduction number figure. Nonetheless,  
it is ready to reduce greatly its ‘carbon  
intensity’ and is beginning to break records  
in energy efficiency. 15
adios  
to the snoWy heights 
The retreat of glaciers in the Andes region  
is a clear indicator of climate change.  
Vulnerable tropical glaciers now melt away  
at a much faster rate than anticipated  
by scientists. This leaves millions of people exposed 
to an unstable and insufficient water supply. 19

### 189472: For an ethical approach to climate change
O
For an ethical approach  
to climate change
n 30 October this year, the European 
Union Summit in Brussels was unable 
to reach a decision on who should pay 
for what to help developing countries 
cope with climate change. There is a 
similar risk that the UN Climate Change 
Conference (COP15) that kicks off in 
Copenhagen, on 7 December, will 
come to an a minima agreement that 
does nothing to guarantee future mas-
tery of greenhouse gas emissions.
Yet no-one, or hardly anyone de-
nies the urgency of taking measures 
that are both ambitious and mutually 
agreed upon. So it is difficult to un-
derstand why it is so hard to find the 
consensus to take action, whether it is 
making drastic cuts in greenhouse gas 
emissions or helping those who are 
most vulnerable to adapt to impending 
changes.
One significant reason is that the ethi-
cal terms of the international response 
to climate change have not clearly 
been laid down. Agreed, the scien-
tific and ethical issues are complex. 
And it is true that powerful interests 
are at stake. But, since the adoption 
of the Kyoto protocol in 1997, we 
have been searching for a way for 
all nations to share the costs of re-
ducing emissions and of adapting to 
their consequences. Without agree-
ment on the terms and modalities of 
what is equitable, no solution can be 
found.
Knowing, but doing nothing – this 
is the ethical knot at the heart of the 
matter. It is time that the international 
community gave itself the means to 
cut this knot.
In what ways, exactly, does climate 
change pose an ethical challenge? 
It seems to me essential to take ac-
alain Pompidou (France), Chairperson,  
Bureau of COMEST (The World Commission 
on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge  
and Technology).
count of at least four dimensions: cli-
mate change invokes responsibiities; 
it has to be based on scientific evi-
dence; it calls for international soli-
darity, and it implicates every one of 
us as individuals.
Climate change is more than just 
greenhouse gases. It also has a hu-
man – and tragic – face. In Papua 
New Guinea, the Carteret Islands are 
drowning, its population forced to live 
in exile and a whole culture destined 
to die out. Other islands will also soon 
be submerged, with millions of home-
less, condemned to seek shelter and 
asylum in an increasingly inhospitable 
world. Then there is the desertifica-
tion of Africa and the fifty million refu-
gees that it will create in the next ten 
years, according to some predictions. 
If the very scale of these figures makes 
In December 1997, some 160 nations met in Kyoto (Japan) to discuss the measures to be 
taken to cope with global warming. The Kyoto protocol is the first legally binding programme 
aimed at combating climate warming. It arose out of the Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
1992) and entered into force in February 2005.
them seem abstract, let us remember 
the women of sub-Saharan Africa who 
have to walk several kilometres each 
day to fetch water. And the more devel-
oped countries are not immune either: 
Hurricane Katrina, by devastating New 
Orleans and its coastal region, created 
a population of climate refugees, within 
the USA itself.
Finding a way out
Faced with these ever increasing risks, 
it is our duty to ensure that we are in-
formed, at all levels, so that we can act 
more wisely, for the benefit of those who 
have the greatest need. This brings us 
squarely to the heart of ethics.
What is more, the victims’ faces only 
express part of the challenge. Human 
life is just one form of life on Earth, which 
also includes the animal and vegetable 
kingdoms. The melting glaciers of the 
Arctic endanger entire ecosystems. It 
is not only the polar bear that faces 
extinction, but an entire marine fauna, 
which now feeds in polluted waters. 
And our actions will also affect future 
generations, who have no say in the 
matter. Is our epitaph going to read: 
“It’s your problem, you sort it out”?
An ethical approach to climate 
change, then, presupposes listen-
ing to all voices, taking all interests 
into account and drafting an agree-
ment that is based on principles that 
everyone can endorse. We are far 
from this today.
So, how to get out of the impasse 
we are in?
UNESCO’s mandate is ethical in its 
very essence. And the Organization 
has taken a major step in this direc-
tion by initiating, at its General Con-
ference in October 2009, a process 
that could lead to a universal decla-
ration of ethical principles in relation 
to climate change. This presupposes 
an international consensus which 
may appear impossible. But, on other 
controversial issues, such as bioeth-
ics, UNESCO has demonstrated its 
ability to give birth to an agreement 
by consulting all parties.
Discussions between States, while 
essential, are not sufficient - the 
people have to be actively involved, 
too. And difficult subjects have to 
be tackled frankly, including the in-
herently ethical responsibilities that 
result from knowing what is hap-
pening and having the ability to act. 
Without a recognition of this ethical 
dimension of climate change, there is 
a danger that all the technical agree-
ments never implemented, all the 
endless political compromises, will 
just be foam on a wave that, gradually, 
will submerge us all.

### 189461: We must respond to climate change today
We must respond to climate change today
the climate is changing — faster than ever. since the beginning of time, earth’s climate has been changing. 
from warm periods to cold, life has had to adapt and evolve. but now human activities are having an effect  
on the dynamics of the planet itself. and most alarmingly the pace of change has dramatically altered,  
threatening to push many plant and animal species towards extinction.
y burning fossil fuels we have added to natural emissions 
of greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the Earth’s atmo-
sphere. As a result, the concentration of such gases in the 
atmosphere is well above the level at any point in the last 
800,000 years. Inevitably, temperatures are now rising too. 
In 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
published its latest scientific report, showing that the glob-
al average temperature increased over the past century by 
0.74°C. In the Arctic, the average temperature over land has 
increased by up to 5°C over the same period and there is 
now a strong chance that the North Pole will be ice free in the 
summer in the next two to three decades. 
Glaciers are melting more rapidly than expected, acceler-
ating the rise of sea levels and increasing meltwater floods 
and unseasonal water shortages in some of the most densely 
populated parts of the world. 
It’s also clear that even if we could stop human-related emis-
sions tomorrow, the massive amount of greenhouse gases 
that we’ve already pumped into the atmosphere will cause 
further warming of between a half and one degree.
We can already see what a one degree centigrade rise in 
global temperature above pre-industrial levels looks like. And 
we can anticipate what a two degree increase in temperature 
would bring: changes in the way that plants grow, where ani-
mals migrate and the way the ecosystems function.
But a world with a three degrees temperature rise could look 
very different. Increased floods, storms and droughts would 
severely impact the way that we live — our access to water 
and food, and the security of our energy supplies. 
By the time we get to a 4°C increase, the rise in tempera-
tures could destroy the very fabric of our societies. Some ar-
eas that are currently habitable might be unable to support 
human societies, let alone accommodate the numbers that 
we anticipate on the planet in the next 20 to 30 years.
And we don’t even talk about a world where average tem-
peratures rise by five degrees or more.
The explosion of modern life has been built around seem-
ingly unlimited supplies of coal, oil and gas, powering indus-
tries to meet relentlessly growing demand. The assumption all 
along has been that our natural environment has the capacity

to provide endless supplies of fuels and accommodate ever 
more by-products of energy generation. 
In reality, of course, burning fossil fuels to drive our econo-
mies has generated the greenhouse gas emissions that are 
now causing global warming. 
Producing and consuming energy accounts for 70% of 
mankind’s carbon dioxide emissions. And half of these emis-
sions are generated by China, the USA and European Union 
countries. 
Energy demand in emerging economies, which include Chi-
na, India, Brazil and Indonesia, is expected to grow rapidly, 
perhaps doubling in the next few decades.
If we choose to continue burning fossil fuels until supplies 
are exhausted, we will simply increase the amount of green-
house gases in the atmosphere and experience even more 
global warming.
 
Energy efficiency
But there is an alternative. Shifting to a new paradigm of en-
ergy generation and use, based on renewable sources and 
energy efficiency, would allow us to avoid many of the prob-
lems of a warmer world.
Currently, both industries and households waste a great 
deal of the energy we produce. In the fight against climate 
change, this is an obvious place to start because greater en-
ergy efficiency doesn’t just cut greenhouse gas emissions — 
it actually saves us money. The International Energy Agency, 
for example, estimates that every $1 spent on energy saving 
measures avoids more than $2 investing in producing en-
ergy.
Small actions in individual households, such as shifting to 
more efficient household appliances, can have a huge effect 
when aggregated across the whole of society. 
It’s estimated, for instance, that the ban on incandescent 
light bulbs in the European Union, which comes into effect 
in coming years, will produce financial savings of US$ 5–10 
billion each year and energy savings equivalent to Romania’s 
annual electricity consumption.
Similarly, many places in America have local bans on drying 
clothes outside on lines, which compels people to use elec-
tric dryers. The energy needs of these dryers are estimated 
to be equivalent to that produced by 15 nuclear power sta-
tions. 
So actions to decrease energy demand are obviously cru-
cial because they have an immediate effect on greenhouse 
gas emissions from power plants. But this is just one part of 
the puzzle. We will still need to generate significant amounts 
of energy, not least because demand in the developing world 
is expected to rise rapidly. In meeting this demand, we must 
shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels and focus 
instead on renewables. 
The EU is halfway to its goal of meeting 20% of its en-
ergy needs from renewable sources, such as wind and solar 
power, by 2020, but there is huge variation in the accom-
plishments of individual countries. The frontrunner, Sweden, 
already generates more than 40% of its energy from renew-
ables — an example of what can be achieved with the right 
ambitions and policies.
A broad perspective on costs and benefits
To keep climate change within manageable limits, we need 
to limit average temperature change to two degrees or less. 
In practice, that means that by 2050 we will need to have 
cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to 
1990 levels. For industrialised countries, whose per capita 
greenhouse gas emissions still hugely exceed those else-
where, the reduction will need to be more like 80%. 
Energy efficiency and renewable energy obviously both

have a crucial role to play. It’s important to stress, however, 
that there are different possibilities for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions and we shouldn’t just focus on identifying 
the cheapest approaches without considering their full im-
pact. Doing most with our scarce resources demands that 
we avoid solutions to one problem that create new problems 
elsewhere. 
The benefits of some renewable energy sources, for exam-
ple, can be offset by the pollution they cause or their impact 
on water resources.  Some measures to combat air pollution 
will help reduce global warming, some will exacerbate it. 
Rather than generating externalised costs, we need to tar-
get measures that produce ‘win-wins’ wherever possible.
Achieving the needed changes in the ways we generate and 
use energy will obviously require efforts from across society. 
The decisions of businesses and consumers are ultimately 
going to determine the fate of our environment. But govern-
ments have a particularly important role in creating the incen-
tives that guide those decisions.
A crucial element here is the price signals that we all face 
as producers or consumers. In market economies, we rely on 
prices to guide our purchasing decisions. All too often, how-
ever, market prices present a distorted image of the costs 
of production — excluding, for instance, costs imposed on 
society today or in the future as a result of pollution, climate 
change and so on. 
Right now, fossil fuel prices often reflect the cost of extrac-
tion and distribution but fall far short of representing the full 
burden on the environment. Correcting these deficiencies 
using mechanisms such as green taxation would significantly 
increase the incentive for firms and individuals to invest in ef-
ficiency and renewable energy. 
The challenge is considerable and will require efforts from 
all sectors and all countries. It’s crucial, though, that we don’t 
delay action while we debate the allocation of responsibilities 
because doing so will only make the goal harder to achieve.
IEA reckons that every year we delay shifting to low- 
carbon energy will add an extra $500 billion to the total cost 
of achieving the two degree target. A few years of delay could 
make the target unreachable.  
Quite clearly, therefore, the costs of delay far exceed those 
of action. So the message is simple: we need to act now.

Rajendra Pachauri   
                          talks to Jasmina Šopova
The Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, which you 
chair, has been awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize. Could this 
be seen as a sign of change  
in the world’s attitude towards 
global warming?
Indeed, the award of the Nobel Peace 
Prize to the IPCC and Mr. Al Gore is an 
important statement on what the Norwe-
gian Nobel Committee sees as a danger 
to peace arising out of unmitigated climate 
change. Since the Nobel Peace Prize and 
the significance attached to it get a great 
deal of attention and coverage worldwide, 
hopefully people’s attitude towards this 
issue will be affected as a result. 
What are the impacts  
of climate change on peace? 
The impacts of climate change on peace 
can be numerous: first, the availability of 
water is decreasing, water resources 
are under high stress in several parts of 
the world. Second, extreme events such 
as heat waves, floods, droughts and ex-
treme precipitation, coastal flooding as a 
result of sea level rise, can lead to popu-
lation movements on a sizeable scale. 
The migration of large numbers of people 
can have an impact on peace, since the 
locations where such people move to 
may find this to be an unacceptable im-
position. Finally, the impacts of climate 
change on agriculture could also lead 
to large scale malnutrition, hunger and 
deprivation, which could end in conflict 
within communities and further move-
ment of large numbers away from areas 
where food is scarce.
In your Nobel lecture,  
you highlight that scholars  
do not pay enough attention 
to the inequities arising from 
these changes, although  
they are part of the most  
significant aspects  
of the impacts of climate 
change. Could you develop  
this idea? 
Scholars have not paid adequate atten-
tion to the equity implications of climate 
change because thus far research has 
largely focused on the physical science 
aspects of climate change, the vulner-
ability aspects as well as on the options 
for mitigation. Now, however, there is 
growing awareness about equity as an 
ethical issue related to climate change. 
You head The Energy and  
Resource Institute which  
developed a germ that breaks 
down petrol. Can you explain 
how it works and what  
the results are? 
We have a major biotechnology pro-
gramme in The Energy and Resources 
Institute, and some of our work has re-
sulted in the development of microbes 
that consume petroleum products. This 
technology is being used now quite ex-
tensively for cleaning up oil spills and oil 
sludge deposits. Once the oil has been 
completely eaten up, the microbes per-
ish without any environmental effects. 
You subscribe to the  
philosophy of Vasudhaiva  
Kutumbakam, which means  
the whole universe is one  
family. What is the role  
of Indian traditional culture  
in your work? 
It is difficult for me to identify what role 
Indian tradition and culture play in my 
work, but having been brought up in 
this country and holding Indian tradi-
tion in great respect, I suppose every-
thing I do is influenced by my upbring-
ing and beliefs.
You believe that each one of us 
can do something for a better 
and safer world. What advice 
would you give our readers?
Each one of us can do a great deal to 
make this world better and safer. First, we 
must develop a belief in the need for pro-
tecting the environment. We must also re-
alize the danger of treating Mother Nature 
with disrespect and of damaging the 
earth’s ecosystems and natural resources. 
We could then find ways to minimize our 
footprint on the Earth’s natural resources 
and ecosystems. This would involve sim-
ple things like switching off lights when 
we leave the room, using efficient energy 
consuming devices, using energy effi-
cient transport such as public transport, 
promoting the use of renewable forms of 
energy… We can bring about a lifestyle 
change in which we reduce reusing and 
recycling products that we have become 
accustomed to. Technology will also bring 
about change towards lowering the inten-
sity of natural resource use, which in turn 
should be supported by policies. But life-
style changes are important too. 
Climate change endangers peace,  
declares rajendra Pachauri,  
Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel  
on Climate Change (IPCC) and 2007 Nobel 
Peace Prize, in this interview published  
in “Planet Hot-Spot”, an issue of the UNESCO 
Courier devoted to the International Year  
of Planet Earth (2008).

### 189463: Double or quits on climate in Denmark
Double or quits on climate in Denmark
the european commissioner on climate, connie hedegaard, firmly believes that  
the un conference on climate change (cop 15) must conclude with an agreement on reductions  
to predicted 2020 levels of carbon dioxide emissions. even if the outcome is not a legally binding agreement 
 – us president barack obama has not received the backing of congress –  
the future of the planet hangs in the balance of this conference
In Denmark, global warming deniers claim that 
the left is using alleged climate change  
as a Trojan horse to increase state control over  
society. How do you reconcile your membership 
of the conservative party with a commitment  
to combat climate change? 
The conservative party considers that it is up to us to 
pass on to the next generation what we have inherited 
from previous generations. This is the essence of conser-
vatism. Looking after our climate and the environment is 
therefore the most important task for conservatives in the 
21st century.
The vast majority of scientists agree  
on the causes and impacts of climate change,  
but ordinary people do not always seem to realize 
the scale of the challenges we are facing.  
What role can politicians play here? 
A great many people, all over the world, have helped to 
spread awareness of this challenge, which outstrips by far 
the challenges of the next State or municipal budget. If we 
do not take up the challenge, we will simply be passing on 
the bill to those who come after us. 
What should the relationship be between the possibilities 
for development in the North and in the South? How can 
we avoid millions of climate refugees? How to ensure ac-
cess to energy resources without starting wars? We have 
to find answers to all of these fundamental questions at 
the same time, which means a policy for security. 
Even though the subject is of immense complexity, it is re-
assuring to note that political agendas have succeeded in 
getting people to understand that nature imposes its own 
limits. We cannot carry on consuming regardless. I believe 
that we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift. Look 
at how long it has taken for consumer spending to take 
off again after the financial crisis. Why? Because people 
may be wondering if having a whole range of electronic 
gadgets has really made them any happier. Maybe they are 
asking themselves if they could hang onto things for a little 
longer. The ‘throwaway’ era has perhaps come to an end.
 What results must the COP15 conference 
achieve if it is not to be regarded as a failure? 
In Copenhagen, we have to arrive at commitments by the 
industrialized countries to reduce their CO2 emissions, 
and for developing countries to pursue growth strategies

within a perspective of sustainability. We have to arrive 
at firm commitments on policies for adapting to climate 
change and the transfer of technology, and for this we 
need a concrete funding plan. 
The estimated cost of aiding developing countries to 
combat climate change is about 100 billion Euros per year 
from now until 2020. The funding has to come from public 
budgets and the carbon market, but in any case, a global 
“greening” of politics is needed. Instead of building yet 
another polluting coal-fired power station, we should be 
building one that is clean. Of course this will cost more. 
But when we say “costs more”, we have to count only the 
difference in costs between polluting technologies and 
clean technologies, and not the money that we would have 
to spend in any case. 
 How can we ensure the transfer of less polluting 
and renewable sources of energy to developing 
countries? 
The carbon market is one solution. If rich countries and 
their industries are committed to reducing their emissions, 
it is in their interest, when they carry out a major project in 
India, for example, to use less polluting technologies.
Another solution is the Major Economies Forum on En-
ergy and Climate [created in March 2008 by President 
Obama and bringing together 17 countries with the aim 
of ‘facilitating a frank exchange between developing and 
developed countries’ [Editor’s note] where seven or eight 
technological areas have been defined. Denmark is mak-
ing a contribution to the Forum on wind energy.
One of the major challenges in combating global warm-
ing is keeping average temperature increase below two 
degrees Celsius. But we know that even an increase of 
1.5°C will endanger some small island nations and low-
lying coastal areas. 
Yes, we talk about a 2°C maximum. But achieving this re-
quires a scale of adjustments that it is difficult to imagine. 
It means that industrialized countries have to reduce their 
CO2 emissions by 24% to 40% compared to 1990 levels. 
This is enormous. If COP15 reaches agreement on this 
objective, it would already be an achievement.
 What do you think about the fact that COP15 will 
not conclude with a legally binding agreement?
The United States is not ready. The Senate is dragging 
its heels in voting through the climate law proposed by 
President Obama’s administration. What is important is to 
set a deadline in Copenhagen. Without a concrete dead-
line, the process could take forever.
Could Denmark serve as a model in the fight 
against global warming? 
For the past 30 years we have succeeded in maintain-
ing economic growth without increasing our energy con-
sumption. This is attracting a great deal of interest across 
the world. What people fear most is the prospect of their 
growth rate falling if they take measures to slow climate 
change. Denmark’s experience shows that this need not 
be the case – it is possible to be energetically efficient 
while increasing exports, and reducing unemployment at 
the same time. 
Denmark has, for example, become world leader in pro-
ducing energy by waste incineration. With the backing of 
citizens and municipalities, we have found beneficial solu-
tions that also give a better energy yield. It is a matter of 
organizing refuse collection, incinerating it and distribut-
ing the heat recovered through an urban heating network. 
Here, in all its simplicity, is one of the reasons that Den-
mark can inspire other countries.

### 189464: Coming to terms with climate change
Coming to terms  
with climate change
T here is an important similarity between the pre-
sentation of Darwin’s theory of evolution and the 
discovery of human influence on climate change: 
both advancements in scientific understanding challenge 
the contemporary human ‘self-identity’. In the case of evo-
lution, the reluctance of society to embrace Darwin’s work 
had its roots in an unwillingness to accept the idea that 
humans were ‘just another species’. In the case of climate 
change, many people find it hard to accept that our species 
really is powerful enough to 
alter the course of something as 
mighty as the planet Earth.
A recent study in the United 
States actually indicated that a 
smaller percentage of Ameri-
cans believe that humans have 
a role in climate change than 
was the case a few years ago. 
One of the reasons for this 
may be that 2008 was a rela-
tively cold year and newspa-
per headlines have abounded 
in 2009 suggesting that 2008 
temperatures may signal a 
global ‘cooling’ or, at the very 
least, can be taken as evidence 
that climate scientists present 
a very uncertain case for glob-
al warming.
Such headlines merely un-
derscore the fact that few non-
specialists understand what 
the climate system is and how 
it works. Humans experience 
climate through the part of 
the atmosphere that touches 
the Earth’s surface. Therefore, we (wrongly) assume that 
changes in surface atmosphere temperature reflect chang-
es in the climate system as a whole.  
In fact, the climate we experience is a function of the 
amount of energy stored as heat and the redistribution of 
this heat on the planet. Only a very small amount (<5%) of 
the heat stored on Earth is found in the surface atmosphere. 
In contrast, about 85% of it is stored in the ocean. Thus, 
temperature changes in the ocean are a more robust indi-
cator of change in the climate system than changes in air 
temperature.  One of the more worrying scientific results 
that has emerged since the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) Report is that temperatures in 
the upper ocean (700 m) are 
increasing about 50% faster 
than was previously thought 
and an increasing trend in 
ocean temperature has been 
recorded since the mid-1970s. 
Thus, the fact that global air 
temperature was lower in 
2008 than in the immedi-
ately preceding years does 
not give climate scientists 
reason to doubt their under-
standing of the climate sys-
tem or global warming! 
It is, of course, true that 
not all scientists agree on 
the role of human activities 
in causing climate change. 
However, 100% agreement 
among scientists is almost 
never achieved. Doubt is 
an indication of a healthy 
scientific process: Science 
only advances as long as we 
continue to ask questions. 
Most studies show that well 
over 90% of scientists from 
relevant disciplines find the scientific facts convincing 
and believe that human activities are influencing the glob-
al climate. The chances that this vast majority of climate 
scientists is wrong are very small indeed.
only very occasionally do scientific discoveries evoke such a dramatic – and emotive - public  
and political response as that elicited by the last decades’ research documenting global climate change  
and identifying human activities as its likely primary cause. probably the last time such a debate  
occurred was when darwin published “the origin of species”.

### 189465: Building an effective and just climate agreement
Building an effective and just climate agreement
as industrialized countries are responsible for 70% of the tons of carbon dioxide  
emitted into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution, they have incurred a debt  
that must be repaid, according to indian environmentalist sunita narain.  
this would help emerging countries to develop without harm to the environment.
he world has still not learnt the first lesson of climate change 
– to share atmospheric space so growth can be shared equal-
ly. But this will require political sagacity, leadership and cour-
age. Global warming is possibly the biggest and most difficult 
economic and political issue the world has ever needed to con-
front. The question is if the rich world, responsible for the stock 
of emissions already in the common atmosphere, will find the 
resources to pay the victims of its economic excesses? Will it 
find the resources to pay for the much-needed transition to low 
carbon economies? The issues are clear. But the answers are 
lost in prevarication and pretence.
The reason is simple: climate change is related to economic 
growth. It is, as is famously said, the ‘market’s biggest failure’. In 
spite of years of protracted negotiations and targets set under 
the Kyoto Protocol (opened for signature on 16 March 1998, it 
entered into force in February 2005) no country has been able 
to de-link economic growth from the growth of emissions. No 
country has shown how to build a low carbon economy, as yet.
The inconvenient truth is not that climate change is real, but 
that confronting climate change is about sharing that growth 
between nations and people. The rich must reduce so that the 
poor can grow. This was the basis of the climate agreement the 
world signed in Rio (at the first Earth Summit in 1992). This was 
the basis of the Kyoto Protocol, which committed the industrial-
ized world to reduce its emissions by roughly 6 per cent over 
1990 levels by 2008-2012. But the world has never been seri-
ous about this agreement.  
The facts are clear. Between 1990 and 2006, carbon dioxide 
emissions of the industrialized rich countries have increased by 
14.5 percent. Furthermore, emissions from the growth-related 
energy sector have increased by 15 percent. This is unaccept-
able. 
This is when we know that climate change is about historical 
emissions, as a ton of carbon dioxide emitted a century ago is 
equal to a ton of carbon dioxide emitted today. According to 
estimates, industrialized countries are responsible for 7 out of 
every 10 tons of the carbon dioxide that has been emitted in 
the atmosphere from the start of the industrial revolution. This 
is the natural debt of nations, which like the financial debt must 
be repaid. But this is not all. Even in terms of current emis-
sions, the difference is clear. Between 1980 and 2005, the 
total emissions of the US were almost double that of China and 
more than seven times that of India. In per capita terms, such 
injustice is even more unacceptable, indeed immoral.

### 189465: Building an effective and just climate agreement
The way ahead
Firstly the rich world must reduce emissions drastically. Let 
there be no disagreements or excuses on this matter. There is 
a stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, built up over 
centuries in the process of creating nations’ wealth. This has 
already made climate unstable. Poorer nations will now add 
to this stock through their drive for economic growth. But that 
is not an excuse for the rich world not to take on tough and 
deep binding emission reduction targets. The principle has to 
be they must reduce so that we can grow. 
The second part of this agreement is that poor and emerg-
ing rich countries need to grow. Their engagement will not be 
legally binding but based on national targets and programs. The 
question is to find low-carbon growth strategies for emerging 
countries, without compromising their right to develop. 
This can be done. It is clear that countries like India and China 
provide the world the opportunity to ‘avoid’ additional emis-
sions. The reason is that they are still in the process of building 
energy, transport or industrial infrastructure. They can make in-
vestments in leapfrog technologies to avoid pollution. In other 
words, build our cities on public transport; our energy security 
on local and distributed systems – from biofuels to renew-
able; our industries using the most energy - and so pollution - 
efficient technologies. 
These countries also know it is not in their interest to first 
pollute, then to clean up; or first to be inefficient, then save en-
ergy. But technologies that exist are costly. It is not as if China 
and India are bent on first investing in dirty and fuel-inefficient 
technologies. They invest in these, as the now rich world has 
done: first add to emissions; make money; then invest in ef-
ficiency. The agreement must recognize this fact and provide 
technology and funds to make the transition in the world. It is 
this that is most critical. 
A quota system
The world must seriously consider the concept of equal per 
capita emission entitlements so that the rich reduce and the 
poor do not go beyond their climate quota. 
This allocation of the earth’s global sinks to each nation, 
based on its population, will create a system of per capita 
emission entitlements, which taken together are the ‘permis-
sible’ level of emission of each country. This would create the 
framework for trading between nations, as the country that 
exceeded its annual quota of carbon dioxide could trade with 
those countries with ‘permissible’ emissions. This would cre-
ate the financial incentives for countries to keep their emis-
sions as low as possible and to invest in zero-carbon trajec-
tories.

### 189465: Building an effective and just climate agreement
As much as the world needs to design a system of equity 
between nations, nations of the world need to design a sys-
tem of equity within the nation. For instance, it is not the rich 
in India who emit less than their share of the global quota. It is 
the poor in India, who do not have access to energy who pro-
vide us the breathing space. India, for instance, had per capita 
carbon emissions of 1.5 tons per year in 2005.  Yet this figure 
hides huge disparities. The urban-industrial sector is energy-
intensive and wasteful, while the rural subsistence sector is 
energy-poor and frugal. Currently it is estimated that only 31 
percent of rural households use electricity. Connecting all of 
India’s villages to grid-based electricity will be expensive and 
difficult. It is here that the option of leapfrogging to off-grid solu-
tions based on renewable energy technologies becomes most 
economically viable. If India’s entitlements were assigned on 
an equal per capita basis, so that the country’s richer citizens 
must pay the poor for excess energy use, this would provide 
both the resources and the incentives for current low energy 
users to adopt zero-emission technologies. In this way, too, a 
rights-based framework would stimulate powerful demand for 
investments in new renewable energy technologies. 
This rights based agenda is critical in the resolution of the 
climate change challenge. The fact is that climate change 
teaches us more than anything else that the world is one; if the 
rich world pumped in excessive quantities of carbon dioxide 
yesterday, the emerging rich world will do it today. It also tells 
that the only way to build controls would be to ensure that 
there is fairness and equity in the agreement, so that this big-
gest cooperative enterprise is possible. 
calculations of national co2 emissions conceal wide disparities.  
energy consumption by the rich is out of all proportion to that of the poor. here, a well is being built in india, in 1984.

### 189467: Refugees of the future will be climate refugees
refugees of the future  
will be ‘climate refugees’
land-use change can have even larger effects than greenhouse gas warming,  
believes the italian climatologist filippo giorgi.  
member of ipcc, the intergovernmental panel on climate change  
(nobel peace prize 2007), mr giorgi is also the head of the earth system physics section  
in unesco’s ‘abdus salam’ international centre for theoretical physics (trieste, italy).
Interview by Jasmina Šopova.
will climate change increase the divide  
between rich and poor?
Climate change will not be felt by all countries in the same way. 
Developing countries are more vulnerable because of their lower 
capacity to respond to climate change. This will likely enhance 
the large imbalances across countries we see today and increase 
friction. In some cases, expected changes such as sea level rise 
and widespread increase in drought conditions might lead to mas-
sive population migrations, the so called climate refugees, and 
this will of course increase tension. 
However, the solution to the climate change problem requires 
a probably unprecedented global co-
operation effort across countries, so it 
offers a great opportunity for interna-
tional collaboration and coordinated 
action. All countries will have to sit at 
the same table to solve the problem. 
according to the ‘Climate Change 
index’ you published  
in September 2006, the mediterra-
nean and north-eastern european 
regions are the most prominent 
‘hot-spots’? why? 
The index is based on changes in 
the averages and the variability of 
temperature and precipitation. The 
Mediterranean and North-eastern Eu-
rope emerged as the most prominent 
hotspots, but not for the same rea-
sons. 
For the Mediterranean the main 
problem, indicated by model projec-
tions, is important warming and a 
marked reduction in precipitation in 
the spring and summer seasons. This 
is due to a northward shift of the storm track (storms increasingly 
travel north of the Mediterranean) and the intensification of lo-
cal soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks (decreased precipitation 
leads to drier soil and warmer conditions, which in turn inhibit 
precipitation etc.). The models also project an increase in vari-
ability during the warm season, which implies a relatively large 
increase in the occurrence of extremely warm and dry seasons 
(even warmer and drier than the summer of 2003). This would 
lead to severe increased aridity and perhaps even desertifica-
tion, especially in the southern Mediterranean countries. 
In North-eastern Europe, the main effect is a large increase 
in precipitation related to higher frequency and intensity of 
storms, conditions more prone to flood events, and important 
warming in the cold season. The 
latter is due to the melting of snow, 
which decreases surface reflectivity 
and induces a higher absorption of 
solar radiation, thereby intensifying 
warming.
You seem to be particularly  
concerned by the effects  
of land-use changes. 
The problem is that current model 
projections of climate change do not 
include land-use change and for 
some regions this is an important 
source of uncertainty that needs to 
be better addressed in the future. 
We have indications that land-use 
change can have large effects, 
even larger than greenhouse gas 
warming in particular in some 
specific regions, for example West 
Africa. But at the global scale the 
effect of land-use change is minor 
compared to that of greenhouse 
gases. I also think the effects of 
atmospheric aerosols and dust may be important at the regional 
scale and need to be better addressed in the future.

### 189468: Record-breaking China
Record-breaking China
china, along with the united states, is the world’s largest producer of co2.  
according to pan jiuha, member of china’s delegation to the un summit on climate change in copenhagen, 
his country is not ready to commit to an emission reduction number. nonetheless, china is ready  
to reduce greatly its ‘carbon intensity’ and is beginning to break records in energy efficiency.
Pan Jiahua is interviewed by German journalist Bernhard Bartsch
What are your expectations for the outcome  
of Copenhagen?
China, together with quite a few other nations including the 
G-77 developing countries, is pushing for the implementation of 
the Bali action plan that was concluded in 2007 (Conference 
on Climate Change, Indonesia). In this action plan, it is clear that 
deep cuts have to be made by 2020 and that developing coun-
tries need to take measurable, reportable and verifiable mitiga-
tion action. Financing and adaptation of technology should also 
be included in the Copenhagen document.
Are you are optimistic  
that these goals can be reached?
That mostly depends on the United States. I think the political 
will of the White House is evident. But without the approval of 
Congress, Obama will not be able to make very concrete com-
mitments. And if the US is unable to provide a number for emis-
sion cuts by 2020 in Copenhagen, I don’t think we will have a 
very specific emission reduction number. 
From a Chinese perspective, what is the number 
to which the US should commit?
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has 
recommended that the rich countries should reduce their emis-
sions by 2020 by between 25 and 40 percent, based on the 
year 1990. The Chinese government’s position is that devel-
oped countries should reduce their emissions by at least 40 
percent. The reason is mainly that developed countries should 
take the lead. Currently, their emissions are several times the 
developed countries’ average. If the rich nations cannot reduce 
emissions successfully, they would give developing countries a 
very poor example.
Is China willing to commit itself to any targets?
The Bali road map makes no requirement for developing 
countries to commit themselves to a number of reduction. But 
it seems like the US will only accept a target if China and other 
large developing countries agree to do the same. After all, China 
is the world’s largest producer of CO2.

### 189468: Record-breaking China
16 l The UNESCO Courier 2009 number 10 — Feature
It is very irrational of the Americans to come up with such a 
demand. It is only an excuse for their own inaction. Their per 
capita emissions are four to five times that of the Chinese, and 
in terms of capital and technology and institutional capability the 
US are supposed to be much superior. If they go back to their 
own history, they can easily understand China’s situation: We 
have some 11 million people going to the urban sector every 
year. These people need housing, infrastructure and employ-
ment – none of that is carbon free. In fact, our energy structure 
is still very carbon intensive: China’s energy consumption is only 
three quarters of that of US, but total emissions are a bit more. 
So at the current stage of industrialisation and urbanisation 
and poverty alleviation, China is not in a position to commit itself 
to emission reduction targets. This is very much in accordance 
with the Kyoto protocol and the principle of “common but dif-
ferentiated responsibilities”. 
Nonetheless, China as a developing country has taken serious 
and substantial mitigation action that has proven to be very ef-
fective. If you look at China’s efforts, no other country has some-
thing comparable to show. At the UN summit in September, 
President Hu Jintao said that China is ready to make a signifi-
cant reduction of carbon intensity. 
China is going to increase its renewable energy to 15 percent. 
That is very ambitious. Although China has no uranium reserves 
of its own, we will increase nuclear power from currently only 10 
GW to 70 GW in ten years. No other country could come up 
with such a large investment in such a short period of time. 
And look at our energy efficiency increase. In the 11th Five 
Year Plan (2006-2010), we have a 20 percent energy intensity 
reduction. In the 12th Five Year Plan, I don’t think we will have 
such a high target, but it will still be high, probably somewhere 
between 10 to 15 percent. Not a single country – not the US, 
not the Europeans and not even the Japanese – has reached 
such a target in five years.
The targets are impressive, indeed.  
But in the past, China has not always been able 
to reach its targets.
I think there should be no problem for China to reach the 20 
percent energy reduction target. The reason is very simple: we 
should thank the financial crisis. Some energy intensive sectors 
are very adversely affected. Less demand for steel or cement 
also leads to reductions in the combus-
tion of coal. So the energy mix is chang-
ing.
But isn’t this only a short-term 
effect? 
You are certainly right. But the financial 
crisis has demonstrated that China’s pro-
duction capacity in these sectors already 
meets demand. We can produce 550 
million tons of steel annually and 4 billion 
tons of cement. That is enough. The idea 
that China will continue to grow exponen-
tially is wrong.
So when do you expect China’s 
coal consumption to peak?
For energy consumption, the current un-
derstanding is that the very capital and en-
ergy intensive process of urbanisation will 
peak before 2020. Between 2020 and 
2030 we will then have a phase of con-
solidation, and after 2030, China will go into a rather low-energy 
kind of post-industrialisation phase. The energy increase will be 
minimal and total energy consumption will probably peak some 
time around 2035. However, the peak of coal should be well 
before 2035, because we have very aggressive investments in 
nuclear and renewables like wind, solar and hydropower.
This is very ambitious, but the bottom line  
is that it will hardly be enough to keep  
global warming below two degrees Celsius.
You are certainly right. That is why we have come up with the 
carbon budget proposal. From a starting point to an end point, 
we will sum up all global emissions and then divide them by the 
world population on a per capita basis. Then you can see how 
much every country has used already and how much it has left. 
And if there is a shortage you buy and if you have a surplus, you 
can use your own. This will lead to a new financial mechanism: 
The carbon using rights can flow from poor to rich countries and 
capital will flow from rich to poor countries.
In China, eleven million people migrate to urban areas every year.

### 189469: Kenya: burning sun and dusty soil
W
Kenya:  
burning sun and dusty soil
severe droughts have left kenya and the rest of east africa in short supply of water and food.  
for the purpose of this article, climate expert dr. dominic Walubengo took us on a road trip  
to the heart of maasai country to demonstrate how climate change is affecting the rural population of kenya.
By Søren Bjerregaard Jepsen, Danish journalist
e are halfway through the desert, near a town called Kajiado 
when the dry truth about climate change in Kenya kicks in 
once again. The journey tells a sad story about dead cattle, 
dry rivers and a way of life that is being destroyed by the CO2 
emissions the world is gathering to discuss at the COP15 
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December.
Dr. Dominic Walubengo works for the Kenyan organisation 
FAN, supported by the Danish NGO MS ActionAid Denmark. 
He advises the Kenyan government on climate and environ-
ment. He is going to Copenhagen with a message about a 
country and a continent in desperate need of new technolo-
gies and new ways of living if the rural populations are to 
survive the droughts that increasingly afflict the East African 
region. 
“Kenya and large areas of the rest of Africa need more than 
money. We need help to adjust to the changing climate. We 
have to find new ways of living for the pastoralists and we 
need new technologies,” says Dominic.
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, is deservedly dubbed ‘the green 
city in the sun’. Driving south from the city, the landscape 
slowly shifts from green to brown to grey. Fifty kilometres on, 
dust from the plains dominates the horizon, fading slowly to 
blue as you gaze skyward.
As one of Kenya’s leading climate experts, Dominic is also 
a first-hand witness to climate change. He has proud Maa-
sai blood in his veins, inherited from his mother, though he 
has not lived the nomadic pastoralist Maasai life himself. He 
sadly contemplates the bloated carcasses of cattle by the 
roadside, dead from starvation and thirst. A couple of years 
ago, large healthy herds of cattle and goats roamed the fertile 
plains. 
How have the living conditions changed? “The pastoralist 
knows how to handle drought. It has hit Kenya many times 
before and it has always decreased the number of livestock. 
The difference is that it used to come every 10th year. Since 
1984, the droughts have become more and more frequent 
and now one takes over from the last. Some places have 
now had a drought for 3 ½ years. There are not enough good 
years in between for the pastoralists to build up their herds of 
goats and cattle,” Dominic says.  
As we drive though the parched countryside Dominic points 
out a dried-up river that used to supply water for people and 
livestock in the area. A year ago there was water, the area 
was green, and the women were growing maize and other 
vegetables on their plots of land. Now they survive on relief 
aid distributed by the government and NGOs.
Four million Kenyans rely on relief aid 
“They expect that 148,000 people in this area will soon be 
dependent on relief aid. The pastoralist tribes are nomads, so 
they used to walk many miles to find food for their cattle. Now 
they often walk in vain. They look for green grass hundreds

of kilometres from their homes, but their cattle and goats 
are dying. I just heard about two Maasais in this area who 
committed suicide. They live and die with their livestock, and 
when there are no cattle left they do not know any alterna-
tives,” Dominic says.
Black, leafless trees and soil the colour of fired clay leaves 
an impression of a country not suitable for living. We pass 
an ostrich and enter a Maasai shamba – a small farm that 
several families use as their base. The proud smile on Tembe 
Resuka’s lips welcomes us.
“We need rain more than ever, and when we need it the 
most, it always comes. So now it has to come,” she says 
with no hesitation. Her husband is several hundred kilome-
tres away with the family’s three remaining cows. A year ago, 
they had 20 head of cattle and 500 goats.
How bad is the situation? “In Kenya there are around four 
million people that need relief. Kenya used to be self-reliant 
in food production, but the output has dropped and noth-
ing changes. Soon three-quarters of Kenya will be relying on 
food from the rest of the world. The drought hits everybody 
living in the rural areas and everybody without a steady in-
come. The whole of East Africa is affected. Outside Kenya 
it is bad in the northern parts of Tanzania, North and Eastern 
Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia,” Dominic says.
Copenhagen has to succeed
The road from Kajiado to Nairobi passes through the afflu-
ent suburb of Karen where many politicians, wealthy busi-
nessmen and expatriates reside. There are more Maasai 
herds here than in Kajiado, and cattle graze on grass along 
the roadside, sustained by the rain that fell here in early Oc-
tober. Some of the Kenyan leaders participating in COP15 
live in this green oasis.
“The politicians are demanding a lot of money in Copenha-
gen. However, that is not enough. If African countries just get 
money because the Western world feels guilty about CO2 
omissions, nothing will change. The money will be spent and 
lost in the political system,” Dominic says. 
Dominic has advised the Kenyan leaders before and his 
ideas formed the backbone of Kenya’s Forest Act of 2005 
that has involved local communities in the preservation of 
Kenya’s few remaining forests. When it comes to COP15 he 
hopes to make a contribution. And that the Western world 
will take the climate related problems in Africa seriously and 
help with knowledge and technology.
What should Kenya ask for? “I’m telling the politicians that 
we have to ask for help. It is necessary that we get new tech-
nologies like wind turbines, solar power and so on. Moreover, 
we need the necessary knowledge to keep them running. We 
need education for Kenyans and technical support from the 
Western world. I am proposing that this be our main mes-
sage at COP15,” he says.
As we drive in the lush, affluent suburbs of Nairobi the need 
for radical changes in the rural areas can be hard to envis-
age. However, the need is evident in other parts of Nairobi. 
The slums are growing every day and experts estimate that 
about half of the 4 million people living in the city are slum-
dwellers. 
What is the solution? “People are moving from the country- 
side to the slums, because there is nothing left for them in 
their rural homes. Many have given up farming and their cattle 
have died, so they move to the slums to look for jobs. It would 
be a much better solution if we can help them find other ways 
of living where they come from, such as refining their crops 
and other businesses that can lead to sustainable incomes. 
Much can be done in this area,” says Walubengo.
Kenya’s leading climate expert Dr. Dominic walubengo is advising  
the Kenyan government at the UN climate change conference  
in Copenhagen.

### 189470: Adios to the snowy heights
D
Adios  
to the snowy heights 
the retreat of glaciers in the andes region is a clear indicator of climate change.  
vulnerable tropical glaciers now melt away at a much faster rate than anticipated by scientists a few years ago. 
combined with changing precipitation patterns, this leaves millions of people exposed to an unstable  
and insufficient water supply for drinking, irrigation and hydropower.
By Ebbe Sønderriis, Danish journalist
r. Edson Ramirez heads a team of scientists that has moni-
tored several glaciers in the Andes since 1990-91, among 
them the famed Chacaltaya, close to Bolivia’s capital La 
Paz.
No need anymore. The 18,000 year-old glacier that de-
lighted thousands of visitors has gone, leaving the ski hut 
and other remnants of what was once “the world’s highest 
ski resort” utterly misplaced on barren stones.
The melting of Andean glaciers has gone on for many de-
cades, but the recent acceleration of the process has taken 
scientists by surprise. Ten years ago, Ramirez and his col-
leagues concluded that the glacier would survive until 2015. 
But in March this year he had to face the facts: “Chacaltaya 
has disappeared. It no longer exists.”
“The vulnerability is far greater than we expected,” he says. 
“The retreat of glaciers in the Andes has accelerated in re-
cent years. It is now three times faster than it was before. 
We expect many other relatively small glaciers to disappear 
in the coming decade.”
“In our region the glaciers perhaps are the best indicators 
of climate change. However, the impacts of changing pre-
cipitation and the profound changes of many other ecosys-
tems, like wetlands for example, may be even more severe.”
Ninety-nine percent of the world’s tropical glaciers are lo-
cated in the Andes: Peru (71 percent), Bolivia (22 percent), 
Ecuador (4 percent) and Colombia (3 percent). Since many 
rivers originate from these glaciers, their melt waters con-
tribute to the water supply of the capital cities La Paz, Quito 
and Lima and other large Andean cities. 
The glaciers and their water basins provide a large part 
of the power used in the region, since 70 percent of the 
region’s power generation is hydroelectric.
Irrigation water, essential for the particularly arid Pacific 
basin, is primarily of glacial origin.
Glaciers act as regulators of the hydrological system in 
almost all of the Andean areas. They play the role of gigan-
tic reservoirs, capturing the precipitation in the wet season 
and releasing freshwater throughout the dry season.
Since the mid-1970s, surface temperatures in the region 
have increased by 0.32 – 0.34 degrees Celsius per de-
cade. In the same period the shrinking of glaciers has ac-
celerated. Many of them have lost more than half of their 
previous area and volume.
Water scarcity and unpredictable rainfall
At first the melting of glaciers means more water running in 
the rivers. In the absence of adequate water storage reser-
voirs the surplus water is wasted – or even causes flood-
ing. 
In the long term, however, as the glaciers diminish and 
melt away, the volume of water resources is drastically re-
duced. According to a World Bank report earlier this year, 
Peruvian glaciers have lost more than a fifth of their mass in 
the past 35 years, reducing by 12 percent the water flow to 
the country’s costal region, where more than half the popu-
lation lives.

### 189470: Adios to the snowy heights
20 l The UNESCO Courier 2009 number 10 — Feature
Dr. edson ramirez  is an experienced glaciologist  
and the assistant director of the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology  
of the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz.
The destabilisation and the eventual disruption of wa-
ter supply aggravate the already existing conflicts about 
scarce water resources, as clearly illustrated by the case 
of Bolivia’s capital La Paz and its adjacent slum city El Alto. 
Water for the city mainly comes from a reservoir at the base 
of the glaciated mountain cluster Tuni Condoriri. Since the 
mid-1950s the glaciers there have shrunk by 40 – 50 per-
cent. Ramirez and his team have projected the Tuni and the 
Condoriri glaciers to be extinct by 2025 and 2045 respec-
tively.
People from all over the country are migrating to the capi-
tal in hopes of a better life. As a result, the population of El 
Alto has grown from 200,000 to about 900,000 in less than 
20 years - without any urban planning.
Several years ago, Ramirez published a study warning that 
water shortage would soon begin in El Alto and the out-
skirts of La Paz. Today, he says, supply in some periods is 
only 40 – 50 percent of demand.
heavier rainfalls have important impacts on agriculture and 
the management of dams, increasing the need for water 
storage and water saving.
The effects of climate change in the Andes region are 
closely related to the ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, 
most commonly referred to as El Niño) – a periodic tem-
perature increase in the Western Pacific occurring every 
few years. 
“The El Niño events are more frequent and more intense 
now than they were in the past. We know from analyses of 
ice cores that the frequency of El Niño events in the past 
has been up to 12 years. Then it fell to 7 years, 4 years and 
now it seems to be less than two years. Whether this is a 
natural variability or a consequence of global warming is 
difficult to say. It is one of the big questions in the scientific 
community,” Ramirez says.
Anyhow, in years with El Niño conditions the melting of 
glaciers in Bolivia and southern Peru is intensified not only 
“Climate change restricts water resources. In my opinion, 
however, the water shortage in El Alto and La Paz is not 
only a problem of climate change. It is also a problem of 
water management,” he says. “In the medium term, we need 
to solve the problems of net distribution of water, and maybe 
we need to control the population density of the city.”
“We may also need to construct other types of infrastruc-
ture, such as dams and reservoirs,” he says.
Uncertainty is the keyword of climate change impacts in the 
Andes region, as it is in other parts of the world. 
“One of the most important factors is the rainfall,” Ramirez 
says. “Big problems can be expected if in the future the 
quantity of precipitation decreases. After all, the quantity of 
water coming from glaciers is relatively small, compared to 
the 80 percent coming from rainfall. However, while climate 
models can reproduce temperature increases with some ac-
curacy, it is very difficult to say if precipitation will increase 
or decrease. That is the big question.”
No more seasons
“We are observing changing patterns of precipitation. The 
distribution in time has changed since the 1980s,” he says.
Shortening of the rainy season and more concentrated, 
by higher temperatures, but also by less precipitation.
Large investments are needed for Bolivia to adapt to pres-
ent and future water shortages: water reservoirs and stor-
age tanks, dams, canals, efficient drip-irrigation, refurbish-
ment of municipal water systems to avoid leaks etc.
“The responsibility for climate change is unequally dis-
tributed. Obviously many regions emit more greenhouse 
gases than South America. In the case of Bolivia, the CO2 
emissions are very low, but the impacts of climate change 
are bigger than in other regions. Countries like Bolivia and 
Colombia do not have the tools necessary for adaptation 
programmes. We need financial budgets to access the nec-
essary technologies.” 
“So, the outcome of the Climate Conference in Copenha-
gen is very, very important. We need to consider the Earth 
as one system – and the cooperation of the developed 
countries towards developing countries is very important,” 
Edson Ramirez concludes.
