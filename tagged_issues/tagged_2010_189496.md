Diversity
Many sacred sites around the world are meeting
places for biological diversity and cultural
diversity. UNESCO works to promote recognition
of their importance in safeguarding the
environment and cultures.
The Organization has a key role in two
international years celebrated in 2010: 
The International Year of Biodiversity, aiming
to raise awareness and encourage action to
promote the safeguarding of the variety of
animal and plant species in the world and their
environment
www.cbd.int/2010/welcome
and
The International Year for the Rapprochement
of Cultures, designed to promote respect for
different cultures and break down the barriers
between them.
www.unesco.org/fr/rapprochement-of-cultures
An international conference on the theme of
Cultural and Biological Diversity was held in
Montreal (Canada from 8th to 10th June 2010).

Bad weather. Cap-Haitien L
IN THIS ISSUE
Haiti is contemplating its future lucidly, beyond
the ruins. In the aftermath of the 12 January 2010
disaster, the Haitians expressing their views in this
issue of the Courier are not indulging in
lamentations. They look at the past the better to
analyze their country’s present situation and to
consider what should come next. If they accuse
Haiti of lacking vision, of falling prey to
superstition or the trap of victimhood, this is only
to clear the ground for reconstruction. Along with
the other international experts who participated in
the forum “Rebuilding the social, cultural and
intellectual fabric of Haiti” organized by UNESCO
last 24 March, they are expecting the international
community to assist them in a more responsible
way than in the past. But above all Haitians are
relying on themselves.
“The very soil on which both the seeds of
tyranny and resistance were sown,” in the words of
Wole Soyinka, 1986 winner of the Nobel Prize for
literature, Haiti is preparing its refoundation. The
rebuilding needed is not only political, economic
and social, it is also intellectual, emotional and
moral. To this end, Haiti must draw particularly on
education, which must be reinvented, and on
culture, its essential vital force. On the international
scale, these domains fall into UNESCO’s fields of
competence; immediately after the disaster the
Organization pledged its support for Haiti’s recovery.

A whole country is tending to its wounds. It
was still dealing with the aftermath of hurricanes
when a terrible earthquake struck. On 12 January
2010, Haiti sank into a state of despair as
countless lives lay buried under the rubble,
countless houses were destroyed, libraries and
museums flattened, schools demolished, the
brand new Quisqueya University was in ruins,
Port-au-Prince cathedral reduced to dust –
images that will remain etched in our minds
forever.
Haiti has been in mourning since the year
began. But, like René Depestre’s “innocent birds”
that “…learn once more how to sing among the
silent,” allowing “healing tenderness” to work
upon “the mind’s most piercing wound”1, hope
was already rising from the ashes when I visited
the country, barely two months after the disaster.
I wanted to let the people of Haiti know they
could count on UNESCO for support, and to
study, with the Government, the best ways our
Organization could provide assistance. 
There are times when it is difficult to find
hope without help. And we extended our hand
to this devastated island. At the International
Donors’ Conference for Haiti in New York on 31
March, $10 billion were pledged in the mid-term
to get the country back on its feet. 
At the meeting, President René Préval
launched an appeal for aid to get the education
system running again. UNESCO responded with
training workshops on post-earthquake
construction, emergency education,
psychological and social counselling in schools
(see pages 38–40). These are just a few of the
initial projects that we supported, largely
through a fund-raising drive launched just two
days after the disaster, on 14 January. 
Culture as bedrock
Almost at the same time as the New York
conference, UNESCO joined with Haiti’s Minister
of Culture and Communication to lay the
foundations for the International Coordination
Committee for Haitian Culture (ICC). The idea
arose at an international meeting at UNESCO
headquarters on 16 February to study the state
of cultural and heritage sites in Haiti after the
earthquake. 
The ICC is chaired by the Haitian Minister for
Culture and Communication, Marie-Laurence
Jocelyn Lassègue, and was set up to coordinate
initiatives concerning Haitian culture and to
mobilize the necessary resources. In July, the
committee met to draft a “road map”.
Recommendations include making an inventory
of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and of Jacmel,
nominated for inscription on the World Heritage
List; identifying the most vulnerable expressions
of intangible cultural heritage; arranging for the
protection of archives, books and other cultural
artefacts; and gathering data and developing
methodological techniques for the cultural
industries.

Catalyst for a new era
As the distinguished Malian writer and ethnologist Amadou Hampâté Bâ believed, a country without
poets, storytellers, musicians, painters, singers and artists would surely die of cold.
Haiti will certainly not die, because its painters started painting again, its poets started creating, its
singers composing, its writers writing, and stories started circulating, very soon after the disaster of
12 January 2010.
We were tempted to flee, to take refuge in imagination and create wondrous worlds, as we
know how to do so well. But after the earthquake, we changed. The clean slate is now the
catalyst for a new era. It encourages the revival of mental attitudes aimed at building a
concrete future, with the help of our creativity and imagination, of course, exacerbated by
the constant connection to suffering.
Mimi Barthélémy, Haitian storyteller
UNESCO, 24 March 2010
To ensure implementation of the ICC’s
recommendations, I decided to set up an
International Donors’ Committee, which will
meet early in 2011 to study the first project
proposals.
To date, UNESCO has invested about
$450,000 from its regular budget in actions
concerning Haiti’s culture, including a project to
safeguard the National History Park in the north
of the island, which has a symbolic importance
for the country. This World Heritage site includes
the Citadel, Palace of Sans Souci and the Ramiers
buildings, dating back to the early 19th century,
when the first Black Republic declared
independence.
Donations are already starting to come in,
like that from a Buddhist institution in the
Republic of Korea, to support theatre in the
refugee camps in Port-au-Prince. I am very
attached to this project because it uses the
cathartic effects of theatre to sow the seeds of
hope in even the most barren soil (see box). 
And, because I believe that culture also acts
as a catalyst and motor for growth in society, I
think that development cannot be conceived
without it. This reality is beginning to gain
acceptance – culture is finally penetrating the
“inner circle” of economics and finance. As proof,
it figures in the Joint Post-Disaster Needs
Assessment Programme launched in Port-au-
Prince on 18 February. 
‘Poto mitans’ of the future
Immediately after the earthquake UNESCO
obtained satellite images in order to draw up a
detailed risk assessment map for Haiti’s cultural
heritage. This project, to be carried out in
collaboration with the European Space Agency,
is one of a series of science initiatives. Obviously,
the first and most urgent deals with water.
Already last January, UNESCO’s International
Hydrological Programme (IHP) began drafting a
plan of action for managing the country’s water
resources. In the longer term, we have prepared
“Culture is the
resource that
society needs
to move from
today to
tomorrow”

a proposal aimed to create a Haitian science
and technology institute for the prevention of
natural disasters, which will evaluate naturally
occurring risks, design and implement action
plans for their mitigation, and provide
education and training in disaster prevention,
while raising public awareness.
Indeed, public awareness and access to
information are prime concerns of UNESCO,
which has already provided emergency aid to
safeguard Haiti’s endangered documentary
heritage. The Organization is also setting up a
mobile multimedia unit, to enable those
affected, especially young people, to learn to
use new tools for communication. I feel that this
initiative will have positive effects not just in
terms of access to information, but also on
social cohesion within the refugee camps.
A huge amount of work also awaits us in the
social sciences, which, alongside education,
culture, the natural sciences and
communication, are pillars (‘Potos mitans’ in the
beautiful Creole language) of the restoration
and rebuilding of Haiti. The whole fabric of
Haitian society has to be woven together again
if the island is to be reborn. And the history of a
country is not written onto doubtful ‘clean
slates’ of the past. It is written in the continuity
of noise and fury, as well as achievements and
wisdom. 
This is why, on 24 March, I held a Forum on
Haiti, bringing together writers, journalists,
policy-makers and international experts.
Under the aegis of UNESCO they discussed the
paths that Haiti should take towards
sustainable development. This special issue of
the UNESCO Courier is a reflection of their
debates, and shows the central role that
culture and education have to play in the
reconstruction of the country. 
Public awareness and access
to information are prime
concerns of UNESCO, which
has already provided
emergency aid to safeguard
Haiti’s endangered
documentary heritage.
A good laugh can nourish a person for months
A theatrical project supported by UNESCO with the Haitian street
theatre troupe Zhovie aims to give displaced people in Port-au-
Prince a moment of joy and solace, and to help relieve their fears
after the 12 January 2010 earthquake that left many of them with
nothing. Zhovie gave the first performance of the play “Zonbi Lage”
on 11 April in Acra camp, which shelters some 20,000 people in
makeshift tents and shacks on Delmas Avenue, a main thoroughfare
in Port-au-Prince.
“The purpose of this theatre production is to provide a
therapeutic experience for the earthquake victims, particularly young
people,” explains Jean Joseph, a Zhovie player who teaches
philosophy in a senior high school in the capital.  “If we want to help
the survivors, it’s not enough to give them food. Mental health counts
as much as physical health. We, the actors, have to help these
depressed, desperate people and try to revive their hopes. A positive
memory, a good laugh, can nourish a person for months,” says the
amateur thespian. 
Zhovie, founded in 2004, is a street theatre troupe of 14 actors and
three percussionists. Its show, “Zombi Lage”, evokes the quake
through texts written by Haitian author Frankétienne, nominated a
UNESCO Artist for Peace in March 2010. Characters on stage include
Baron Samedi, Voodoo divinity of the dead, and the zombie, a living-
dead slave.
The theatre troupe is now much in demand and UNESCO is
planning to sponsor a series of performances in other camps for
displaced persons. – M.B.

### 189535: At one with Haiti
“When a habitation dies, a warehouse of
memory perishes with it,” says Wole

Haiti, a country fallen prey to political
contradictions and the victim of blind
forces of nature.

### 189535: At one with Haiti
If ever there was an ill-starred island, it is that
isle once known as Hispaniola, whose western
half is named Haiti, a land of profound
contradictions that symbolize at once the loftiest
aspiration of the human spirit – freedom - and its
eternal adversary, tyranny. Even the spirituality of
the African continent that sustained its peoples
through generations of human degradation has
not escaped a tyrannical conversion. Voodoo
became part of the negative face of folklore,
turned into an agency of superstitious and
political terror that shrouded the nation in an
opaque, diabolical subjugation, meat and drink
to the cinematic arts. Now it would appear the
much abused mystic forces of Nature have
turned palpably brutal, joined in the spiral of
reprisals and left a people stunned into a
condition that evokes that very image of dread –
the zombie, or the living dead.  All too painfully,
the process of resuscitation lumbers on.     
‘When a book is lost,’ goes a familiar African
saying, ‘it can be replaced. When a village elder
dies, however, an entire library has vanished’.
Societies steeped in the tradition of the griot,
and other oral custodians of a people’s heritage,
may be forgiven this touch of hyperbole.
Nonetheless it is a sentiment that is based on
truth. Elders have died in Haiti, so have youth. 
So have habitations. The scale of destruction
provokes a variation on that African saying,
instructing us that when a habitation dies, a
warehouse of memory perishes with it. Such a
loss is the world’s, however, not merely that of
the stricken locality.
More than physical libraries have been lost in
Haiti!  Yes indeed, those also, and the records, the
physical structures, the priceless archives that
guard a people’s history have ended in rubble,
mush and ashes. In addition to these however, so
have the venerated spots and landmarks, the
patina of ancestry on familiar walls, the
communal spaces such as market squares,
arbours, ageless trees under whose shade a
community is renewed as the griot spins out
narratives of a people’s antecedents and society’s
coming-in-being, where knowledge of identity
passes from the old and is embedded in the
young. These are the palpable threads in the
fabric of continuity of our species, linking
generation to generation. For Haiti, much of this
is entombed in the insatiable maw of Nature.
Even cobbled pathways, evocative of time past,
the mementoes and monuments of both
triumphant and hostile faces of history have not
been spared. Heritage transcends mere
monuments however. The very soil on which
both the seeds of tyranny and resistance were
sown, the earth that is soaked in the blood of
despots and martyrs alike are part of a people’s
narrative, all eloquent chapters, annotations and
bookmarks that line the daily passages of a
people even as they pursue their most mundane
activities. These have been crushed, mangled
into indecipherable mounds, shorn of their
communal associations. The bulldozer has been
accorded the last word. Hallowed spaces of
Legend have become one with earthworks, the
guaranteed bequest of a blind catastrophe.     
How often has the world of letters been
moved, irrespective of race, to indulge in the
celebration of the victory of Haitian resistance
under General Desallines1 over the forces of re-
enslavement dispatched by Napoleon Bonaparte
in his imperial obsessions!  Haiti tested and
shredded the claims of Europe as the nursery of
the Age of Enlightenment. Beyond the clash of
arms, however, Haiti proved the manifestation of
a people’s supreme will that resulted in the
establishment of the first independent black
republic on the globe, an event whose heroes –
such as Toussaint Louverture2 – have been
rhapsodized by poets and dramatists,
Heritage

however. The

immortalized in statuaries, on canvases, murals
and tapestries from impassioned brushes,
weavers and carvers. They range from schooled
masters of the arts in formal galleries to the
roadside, ‘naive’ painters all the way from Harlem
to South Africa! But these figures are the
survivors across time, today we are confronted
by the needs of survivors in present time, the
direct heirs of that proud history, the living
repositories of their attainment, and inspiration
of our creativity.
Their burden is now ours, their agony ours,
the hope of their survival ours. If we fail them, we
deny them, we endorse the victory of blind
Nature over human resilience and
resourcefulness and thus, we fail ourselves. We
master Fate only when we disperse the stench of
death and anguish with the magic wand of faith
in the future, planting a kiss of life on the faces of
orphans, the wounded, and the bereaved. 
Haiti casts a net of historic evocations that is
totally disproportionate to her size, at once an
aspiration and a warning.  Haiti embodies both
the glory and tragedy of the black race. Never
before, however, have her people confronted a
challenge of such dimensions – and opportunity.
Haiti exists beyond mere symbol, being, for its
time, a unique testing ground of human destiny
in the eternal struggle between domination and
liberty, between power and freedom. Haiti is a
lesson, not merely for the African world but for
humanity. Nature has thus dealt a cruel, near
irreparable blow, firstly to the African peoples
everywhere, but more widely to a world
community wherever freedom is valued, and
history, heritage and memory are understood as
the cohering fabric of communal existence.
Thus, Haiti cannot be permitted to die,
stagnate, or degenerate. Opportunities
sometimes exact a costly price, and this, Haiti has
paid several times over, in one fell swoop! Now is
the time to milk that opportunity in turn and
assist her own visionaries to recreate Haitian
society morally, socially and intellectually.  Much
has been done, and we salute the humane
response of the world. But we cannot be
complacent. We do not know how much of Haiti’s
humanity — which is ours — is  still, even now,
roaming directionless, foraging with canines and
rodents for food, crouched under crude shelters,
mothers with the future cradled in their arms,
starving, listless, with large bewildered eyes in
mute appeal to unseen, would-be providers. As
the healers of the world rush to the aid of the
wounded and the traumatized, reviving hospitals
and clinics, ferrying drugs and nourishment,
writers, artists and intellectuals must join hands
for the restoration of the mind. Libraries must be
re-stocked, galleries replenished, and schools
resuscitated. Writers can help by donating theirs
and other books, painters their canvases,
architects their skills, and teachers all forms of
instructional aid.  It is clear – Haiti will never again
be the same island we once knew, nor Port-au-
Prince exude her faintly decadent redolence of a
troubled past.  Nonetheless, we can recreate from
its rubble a totally new and vibrant social entity
that becomes a  beacon of universal solidarity, an
affirmation of the human spirit, an enduring
outpost of a mother continent whose stolen
children wiped out the ignominy of enslavement
and transformed a mere labour stockade into a
citadel of defiance, and a vision of liberty. 

“Attacked, ostracized, coveted,
subjected to gunboat diplomacy, divided,
militarized, battered.” This is the image the
Haitian historian and diplomat Dantes
Bellegarde paints of his country, adding
“Haiti’s independence, endlessly
threatened throughout its tumultuous
and chaotic history, is still something of a
miracle.” 
Indeed, the first black republic has
suffered considerable pressure from both
within and without, which has made for a
turbulent trajectory. Ostracized by the
superpowers, who couldn’t accept the
emancipation of this black Tom Thumb,
Haiti has faced tyrannical regimes
founded upon the exclusion of the
people, held in a state of utter destitution
and despair.
The superpowers adopted a tough
stance, whether it was France
withdrawing precious financial resources
from the fledgling nation, or the 19 years
of American occupation at the start of the
20th century. And the long night of
slavery left deep and lasting scars on the
social and financial life of Haitians. The
master-slave relationship and the rift
between the bô lan mè people (those
living by the sea) and the gwo soulyé
(peasant farmers) are examples of
schisms that persisted beyond the end of
slavery, and still, more than two centuries
after independence, undermine the
structure of Haitian society. 
But how does one really escape from
slavery? Once the exuberance of freedom
has worn off, how does one construct
liberty? Because it needs substance, so
that “the trials of liberty do not become
insupportable,” as the Greek-born French
philosopher, Cornélius Castoriadis, has
emphasised, before going on to explain
that “that only happens when one
manages to do nothing with that
freedom.” 
The great Toussaint Louverture and,
after him, the founding fathers of the
Haitian Republic, may have won the
fundamental battle for humanism, but it
would seem they failed when it came to
implementing a new social charter.
Freedom
Very soon after independence, the old
relationships of servitude were
reproduced. The farmer-generals took the
place of the colonials, the former slaves
were subjected to forced labour, confined
to the plantation, remaining aneu logou,
i.e. denied any freedom of speech, the
right to deliberate or to be inventive.
Marronage, which was once celebrated as
an act of resistance against the
oppression of slavery, was, from the time
of the first (1801) constitution, seen as a
form of vagrancy and punished with
severe penalties. This agrarian militarism
(caporalisme agraire) was in force right up
until 1904, a century after Haitian
independence! The peasants, who had
fought for freedom, were sidelined from
essential debates on how to break with
the colonial past.
It is easy to understand how the very
structure of the master-slave relationship
could make it difficult to use the law to
construct freedom, considering how
much it saps the Caribbean spirit and
dislocates family structures. Indeed, the
father figure becomes devalued as soon
as his place is usurped by the master, and
this destabilises the rule of law – the
menacing figure of the master, who is
“beyond the law”, becomes a symbol of
Since Haiti became independent
in 1804, a succession of
traumatic events has marked the
country’s history, complicating
the task of building freedom. The
irresponsible attitudes of
superpowers and national
political leaders have left the
country at an impasse. The only
way out is through responsible
action and solidarity on a global
scale.

### 189536: Responsibility: the link between freedom and solidarity
violence and confusion, in opposition to
that of father, who upholds order. “The
words of the father are in accordance with
the law […] whereas the words of the
master are just an echo of themselves,”
wrote the French psychoanalyst, Jacques
André, in L’Inceste focal dans la famille noire
antillaise (1987).
It is in these conditions of political and
psychological violence that Haitian liberty
served its apprenticeship. But, to escape
from slavery means overcoming one’s
negative self-image and finding the light
of true liberation inside oneself, not by
repeating patterns of dominance
inherited from the plantation. It means
rediscovering self-esteem.
Just a few years ago, in 2004, the
Haitian writer, René Depestre, in a letter to
his compatriot, Carl Fombrun, spoke of
another form of slavery to which the
people are still subjected: “Let us abolish
this internal slavery that the theologies of
barbarism impose on the wretched
consciousness of Haiti,” he writes. “Let us
make un unprecedented effort to
rediscover a sense of responsibility, to
confront the row of zeros that two
centuries of incompetence have allowed
to accumulate to the left of our zombie-
like immobility.”
Responsibility
Depending on the way a society
organizes its politics and beliefs, it can
either favour or hinder a sense of
responsibility in its members. Politically,
military dictators and populist totalitarian
leaders in Haiti have often posed as
supreme saviours, believing themselves to
be charged with a divine mission. And
when the leader is seen as a Living God,
the people have nothing more to say. 
Meanwhile, Protestant churches, as
the Haitian ethnologist Charles-Poisset
Romain notes, have encouraged
supernatural explanations for
underdevelopment. “Is the Church not to
blame for encouraging and preaching
fatalism, and of training quitters, rather
than vicars?” he writes in Le Protestantisme
dans la société haïtienne (1986). But
fatalism leads to inaction and an attitude
of spectator, rather than critic, of what is
happening.
Then there is voodoo, whose lavé tèt
initiation rite is emblematic. It consists of
introducing into the head of the initiate a
Loa, a kind of guardian angel, a protecting
spirit. According to the French
anthropologist Roger Bastide, it is “not the
physical head of the individual, but his
intelligence, his sensitivity, his psycho-
physical life; it is the spirit, in a word, in
relation to the soul.” If there is indeed a
kind of doubling involved, one might well
wonder who commands his actions. If a
crime is committed, who is guilty?
One often hears Haitians say: sé pa fôt
mwin (it’s not my fault), sé pa mwin mêm
(it’s not me, myself), sé de m’yé (I am two),
etc. Responsibility, which is a necessary
condition for any form of freedom, then
becomes a totally relative category. The
principle of reparation associated with
justice is violated, opening the door to
impunity. And it can easily be seen that
this pair – violence-impunity –
impregnates the psychology of the
Haitian masses through and through. 
“Any reform of minds has to come via
the acceptance of our collective failure,”
writes the Haitian educationalist Roger
Péreira, in his article, “Haïti or the trial of
freedom” (2001). “We are all part of the
problem; it is on this condition alone that
we can all be part of its solutions.”
Solidarity
Also, although responsibility is above all a
personal matter, it must be understood,
following the Israeli philosopher Martin
Buber, that every human being can only
define himself as I when in contact with
thou. Every individual I is part of the I-thou
dyad that underlies the world of
relationships. Relationships are by
definition interdependent. 
If there is one precursor to the
development of solidarity between
beings, it is freedom, in the Arendtian1
sense, i.e. merging with politics, this public
space where ‘living together’ is forged
through dialogue. Freedom can only be
practiced in society, by giving expression
to concern for the other whether close or
distant, and a concern for the general
interest. 
Freedom and responsibility cannot be
dissociated and can only be expressed
fully through solidarity, without which we
would be reduced to what the French
philosopher, Jean-Claude Michéa called
monadic egos, without a soul. A world
that is not interdependent would abolish
humans. 
More than ever, during the terrible
times that Haiti has been living through
since the earthquake of 12 January 2010,
the central question of responsibility is
raised – both that of Haitians and that of
the international community – and of
national and global solidarity. UNESCO, in
its function as intellectual watchdog and
disseminator of ideas and ethical values,
will have a role to play alongside Haitians
in introducing the principle of
responsibility wherever there is dialogue
in Haiti, and notably in education. It is a
matter of accompanying the physical
reconstruction of the country with a social
and civil reconstruction founded upon
education and culture. 

“To those who see no more than ratiocination in the re-examination of the past
suggested in this article, one may reply that it is the sine qua non of an
openness towards the future. It is not a matter of seeking ghosts of a past that
some may think has gone forever, but, as the French philosopher Emmanuel
Lévinas, wrote, of “reviving the radicalism of a memory which, through the
passage of time, inscribes a permanent and fertile tension between past and
future, between the particular and the universal.” – B.H.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
Using culture to reconstruct Haiti – is this 
“a challenge? an anomaly? or a threat?” to
paraphrase the expression used by the black
American historian Rayford Logan after the
unexpected emergence of the new nation-state
of Haiti in 1804. 
Neither anomaly nor threat, but certainly a
challenge, because after a historic two hundred
years of existence, with periods of advance and
regression, sometimes provoked from within,
sometimes from outside, the task in hand today,
since the 12 January 2010 disaster, is no less than a
radical rebirth of Haiti. And, after the hundreds of
thousands of deaths and innumerable collapsed
buildings, what is left that can serve as cradle for
this renaissance? What remains are Haiti’s cultural
resources. At the height of the American
occupation of Haiti, with a paternalistic but
welcome vehemence, Dr Jean Price Mars, writing
in his landmark book Ainsi parla l'Oncle, published
in 1928 [translated as So Spoke the Uncle in 1983],
reminded us that it is these resources that give life
to our country and enable it to survive.
The time has come to reaffirm that the end
goal of development is the happiness of the
people, and to recognize that culture is an
essential element in our country’s development.
Not an accessory or a luxury, accessible only to
the elite, but the very stuff that weaves society
together, gives it strength and helps foster
wellbeing, in tandem with the economy.

### 189537: Culture: cradle of the Haitian renaissance
A hotbed of artistic activity, Haiti does not take
full advantage of its cultural resources to further
its development. The new cultural action plan,
aimed particularly at young people, calls for
raising awareness of vectors of creativity and
promoting them.

Plan of action for culture
Because of her conviction that culture can play a
major part in the process of renovation and
restructuring of Haiti, the Minister of Culture and
Communication has called for the integration of
four themes in the nation’s Plan of Action for
Reconstruction and Development – institutional
strengthening; economic development; identity,
citizenship and social cohesion; regional
integration and international cooperation.
Institutional strengthening implies the
establishment of partnership agreements
between various ministries, with a view to
encouraging the creation of infrastructures
around cultural goods and services, as well as
respecting specific heritage characteristics when
developing given sites.
The Minister is aware that the cultural and
creative industries can make a significant
contribution to our GDP, and this is why she
plans to set up a ‘creativity fund’ aimed at artists,
craftspeople and cultural enterprises, as well as
establishing a mechanism in favour of
professional training and the promotion of
cultural entrepreneurship, with the ultimate goal
of integrating cultural factors with economic
development. 
The sense of identity and citizenship needed
for social cohesion can only emerge when
knowledge and skills are valued and passed on
from generation to generation. It is therefore
necessary to create the right conditions for the
Haitian people to accept who they are and to
continue to renew and nourish their traditions.
Haitian culture derives its strength from
creativity (in art, theatre, dance, music, etc.). This
means that measures are needed, targeting
young people especially and in cooperation
with the Ministry of Education, to raise
awareness and to encourage vectors for
creativity.
Haitian creativity is responsible for a great
diversity of national culture, which is recognised
the world over, especially in the Caribbean.
There are many examples of Haitian culture’s
major influence in other countries in the region,
as part of a constant flow of exchanges. Today,
these exchanges need to be given extra
impetus, with a deliberate policy of regional
integration and international cooperation
through culture. A strengthened cultural
presence on the regional and international stage
will help to improve the image of our country
abroad, while reassuring our compatriots in the
diaspora, our international partners and
potential investors. 
An Observatory for Haitian culture
To encourage greater coherence in public
involvement in culture, the Ministry of Culture
intends to bring together national and
international artists and culture professionals, as
well as foreign friends and policy-makers, at a
national Forum on Haitian culture. This Forum
will provide an opportunity to meet and identify
the main priorities and lines of action. The
programme will be monitored and evaluated on
the basis of a series of indicators, data and
statistics, drawn up in cooperation with UNESCO. 
Given the nature of its mandate, the Organi -
zation can play a leading role in supporting Haiti
on its long path to renovation and reconstruction,
especially in the cultural and artistic fields.
I believe that the project for a Haitian Cultural
Observatory, to which we are particularly
attached, would constitute an ideal and
sustainable vehicle for developing this role. 
A militant feminist,  
Marie-Laurence Jocelyn
Lassègue was named Haiti’s
Minister of Culture and
Communication in November
2009. She held the position
previously from 1991 to 1993, after
having worked as a teacher and
journalist. From 2006 to November
2009, she was also Minister for
Women’s Affairs and Women’s
Rights.
It is therefore
necessary to
create the right
conditions for
the Haitian
people to accept
who they are
and to continue
to renew and
nourish their
traditions.

In Port-au-Prince on 12 January, after the second
tremor had ended, I was waiting, anxiously, for the
third. That’s when I heard shouting. It was coming
from the Després and Pacot Hills. There were cries
from every street in the Bas Peu de Chose quarter:
Jesus! Jesus! Mary! Armageddon!
For the next three nights, all these people –
crowded in the streets to escape the crumbled
houses that hid the bodies of their loved ones –
prayed to Jesus, chanted prayers, read the Bible.
Revelation 6: “And I saw when he opened the sixth
seal, and there was a great earthquake; […] and
every mountain and island were moved out of their
places.” Revelation 16: “For they are the spirits of
devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the
kings of the earth and of the whole world […] 
Animism, voodoo and fundamentalist Christian beliefs prevent a
number of Haitians from taking their destiny into their own hands.
Superstition has contributed to the country’s fall into the trap of
victimhood. A rational analysis of Haiti’s past and its present situation is
the key to salvation.

And he gathered them together into a place called
in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. […] And there
were voices, and thunders, and lightning; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since men
were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and
so great. And the great city was divided into three
parts, and the cities of the nations fell […] And
every island fled away, and the mountains were not
found.”
Everything was interpreted as a sign: if the
churches had collapsed, if the Palais National had
gone up in smoke, it was because the politicians
had shown themselves unworthy of God.
Revelation 18 (9-10): “And the kings of the earth,
who committed fornication and lived wantonly
with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they
look upon the smoke of her burning, standing afar
off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the
great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour
is thy judgment come.”
I saw people using their bare hands to pull
their brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers or
neighbours out of the rubble. I saw dead bodies
being shovelled up with bulldozers, tipped into
skips and buried in common graves, dug into
refuse dumps. I saw an endless column of people
filing up the hills to Pétion-Ville and Kenscoff,
leaving the lower quarters to the looters. This
unnamed thing, this goudougoudou drove tens
of thousands of terrified Haitians out to the
provinces, to the Dominican Republic, USA or
Canada. Revelation 6 (15): “And the kings of the
earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and
the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and
freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the
rocks of the mountains.” 
And ever since, by word of mouth, on the
radio and television, in gatherings of believers, all
one can hear are inspired voices declaring the
end of a 25-year cycle, ending in 2011, with the
total destruction of Haiti! Revelation 11(14): “The
second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh
quickly.”
We are in the kingdom of deep-seated fears,
which sometimes reverberate through an entire
society and demand an explanation.
An eternal
victim does not
see himself as
master of his
own destiny
Behold these shreds and cinders of your race, 
This child and mother heaped in common
wreck, These scattered limbs beneath
the marble shafts— 
A hundred thousand whom the earth
devours, 
Who, torn and bloody, palpitating yet, 
Entombed beneath their hospitable roofs, 
In racking torment end their stricken lives. 
To those expiring murmurs of distress, 
To that appalling spectacle of woe, 
Will ye reply: “You do but illustrate 
The Iron laws that chain the will of God”? 
Say ye, o’er that yet quivering mass of flesh: 
“God is avenged: the wage of sin is death”? 
What crime, what sin, had those young
hearts conceived 
That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother’s
breast? 
Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice 
Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid?

### 189538: Haiti's new start will not be from zero
buildings were destroyed. Under the ruins of the
Royal Palace, the 70,000 books and priceless
archives of the national library lay in fragments. 
We are told that the very pragmatic Prime
Minister, Sebastião de Melo, Marquis of Pombal,
simply said: “What now? Bury the dead and feed
the living.” And he immediately sent troops to
put out the flames and gather the bodies,
publicly hanged looters as a warning, and
prevented able-bodied inhabitants from leaving
the city … Barely a year later the city had been
cleaned up and reconstruction could begin. 
This catastrophe shook all of Europe and
even influenced Enlightenment philosophers.
Humanity felt alone in the Universe. It was no
longer possible to speak of Providence without
thinking of Lisbon. 
How will the 2010 earthquake change Haitian
thinking? 
For an animist society, an earthquake is not a
natural phenomenon, but the result of some
malicious intervention. Biblical references, within
the context of Protestant fundamentalist
churches and integrated by Voodooists and
Catholics, only exacerbate the trauma suffered
by the people. This phenomenon has a
considerable hold over people’s minds. Those
who are imagining a Haitian nation should think
about this. 
Haiti was considered to be the poorest
country in the Northern hemisphere; now it sees
itself as the unluckiest, even cursed. We have
long been subject to incessant victimisation by
our leaders, but also by many Haitian and foreign
intellectuals. Victimhood is the greatest trap
before us today. In our very fragile institutional
context, the world’s kindness and generosity
In eight days I did not see a single uniformed
person in the streets. Not a Haitian policeman, nor
a soldier from the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti. It was four weeks before the Head
of State addressed the nation. The State seemed
to have collapsed along with its symbolic
buildings. Even today, we are still waiting for
decisions and directives that never come.
Another time, another place – a detour
through history
On 1 November 1755, at 9.40 a.m., that is, on the
morning of the Catholic All Saints Day, a terrible
earthquake struck Lisbon, devastating it in the
space of a few minutes. And then an enormous
tsunami engulfed the centre of the city. What the
sea spared was devoured by fire. A quarter of the
inhabitants lost their lives and most of the

may undermine our capacity to look after
ourselves. We must banish victimhood and
rediscover our self-esteem. An eternal victim
does not see himself as master of his own
destiny.
Over these past decades, as Haitian
institutions gradually started to go under, as the
economy floundered, as the spectre of civil war
loomed closer and closer, as the State lost its
sovereignty – as much the fault of interventions
by armies of foreigners as of uncoordinated
international aid – our identity crisis only
deepened. And we were entirely focused on the
past, so confused was the present, while the
future seemed a dead-end. 
But what have we inherited from this past?
The images of Toussaint Louverture and Jean-
Jacques Dessalines, these two former semi-
illiterate slaves who were able to lead Haiti
towards independence, to establish a republic,
create a nation and thus remain a source of
pride. But also, and especially, a sinister refrain
which is constantly being beaten out: for 200
years, all Haitian Heads of State have been
despots, murderers and corrupt; for 200 years,
the administration has been a mess; for 200
years, the country has been torn apart by civil
wars and social inequalities. 
Trying to start from zero again
This denigration of the past is harmful for the
future. And it is not innocuous: it lets those in
power off the hook and, with them, the
international community that supports them. We
cover our ancestors with curses in order to cast a
puritanical veil over what is happening under our
noses today, namely, an increase in the rate of
population growth that the economy cannot
support and that politicians ignore; a
dehumanising form of urbanisation, born of the
destruction of the peasant economy; the
trivialisation of the impact of the presence of
foreign armed forces; and an ecological disaster
that is largely the responsibility of timber
exporting companies.
The capital had become a monster, with over
two million inhabitants. The population doubled
every ten years between 1970 and 1990. It
tripled between 1990 and 2000. And as a result,
62% of its housing was built between 1995 and
2000. 
In other words, it was not our ancestors who
built the houses in Port-au-Prince that killed over
200,000 people. The responsibility for these
buildings lies with Haiti’s present-day politicians
and the countless foreign aid missions, which, for
the past 16 years, have been sharing power with
our leaders. 
Rather than condemn the past, why not
study recent history and the present day? Since
the Americans arrived under the flag of the
United Nations, in 1994, political authority has
been, at best, ambiguous: we are neither a
trusteeship, nor entirely independent.
Governments on artificial life-support succeed
one another, leading the State towards a
bottomless precipice. So the question of political
power clearly needs to be posed, as it is central
to reconstruction.
Wanting to restructure the Haitian state
seems like a dream of starting from zero again.
The Haitian state has existed for 206 years. It is
not a matter of restructuring it, but, on the
contrary, of creating links between the past and
the present, reconnecting with history and
considering what it has to teach us. This is the
way to return meaning to the lives of the Haitian
people, and with it a sense of dignity and self
esteem. 

We are going to have to accept that it will be
impossible to reconstitute the social, cultural and
intellectual fabric of Haiti. Contrary to what has
sometimes been claimed – that the social, cultural
and intellectual fabric of Haiti was torn apart on 
12 January 2010 – it was in tatters long before this
fateful day.
Twenty years of populism had already
polarized Haitian society, deepening the class
divide and accelerating a brain drain that has
begun under the François Duvalier regime. “Over
83% of the best qualified workforce produced in
Haiti ends up by leaving the country to live
abroad,” says the World Bank, adding that the USA
is the preferred destination for the great majority
of expatriate professionals. Canada is another. 
Following the 12 January earthquake, this
haemorrhaging out of the country has already
increased and could well get worse if concrete
and urgent action is not taken very soon. With
unemployment running at 90%, Haiti’s economy
was already in the red long before the earthquake.
It would be better not to dwell on the figures here,
to avoid even more self-flagellation. 
Brain drain, cultural destitution, social decay, irresponsibility,
corruption – these are key words in this harshly critical portrait 
of Haitian reality, followed by proposals for rebuilding a new 
Haiti founded on science, intelligence, competence, humanism 
and humility.

As a country, Haiti is lagging behind in everything.
The world’s first black Republic has become the
pariah of the American continent – 
a country that has never been able to lift itself to
nation status and which is, today, more than ever,
dependent on international charity. Charity, and
not aid for sustainable development, which,
instead of helping our country get on its feet, has,
for the past 20 years, dragged it into the dark
depths of misery. Of course, Haitians are the first to
blame for their social decadence, but donors
should also accept their share of the responsibility.
And that is why the next governments need to
make enlightened choices and turn to the Haitian
diaspora, which provides three times more money
each year than the international community – 
$1.8 billion compared to $500 million, respectively. 
Successive governments since 1986 have
claimed that Haitian culture is our greatest asset.
Yet nothing has been done to show this culture
off. If it were not for the vitality and talent of our
artists and creators, this culture would also
probably be moribund today. How is it that, in
the 21st century, Haiti does not have a single
theatre worthy of the name? Last August, the
capital’s only cinema announced that it was
closing, seriously threatening the survival of
Haiti’s nascent film industry. The National Theatre
and National School of Arts buildings have long
been ruins, or used for political ends far removed
form any artistic vocation. Even if Haitian culture
is still alive, there is absolutely nowhere that it
can be appreciated. The destitution of Haitian
culture is shameful: not a single theatre or
cinema, no museum fit for the country’s art, local
publishing enterprises with no resources, no
newspapers or magazines, no cultural radio
station, no cultural policy, no real school of art.
What has happened to the country that seduced
French Culture Minister and intellectual 
André Malraux.
All is not lost
The time has come to “reshuffle the cards” and all
may not be lost. In its Plan of Action for Recovery
and Development presented to the United Nations
on 31 March, the Haitian government recognises,
for the first time, that culture is “an element whose
marginalisation has, for many years, led to the
failure of development support programmes in
almost all countries.” Obviously, this presupposes
that the State sends clear signals that it is willing to
help to make the cultural sector economically both
viable and enviable. 
Haitians try to leave 
Port-au-Prince by boat. L

### 189539: Building a new Haiti
It is worth noting that while Haitians are
quick to blame the inefficiency of the State, it is
also hard to believe that not a single
organisation, company or businessman in Haiti is
interested in investing more in culture. Last
August, in an article entitled “The case for a real
theatre in Haiti”, published in the Le Matin
newspaper and reprinted in the Courrier
International under the headline “The Show is
Over”1, I tried to attract the Haitian public’s
attention to the economic potential of the
culture sector. In 2007 alone, culture brought in
almost $25 billion in taxes to Canada’s Federal,
provincial and municipal government coffers.
That is almost three times more than the $7.9
billion invested in culture and the arts by these
three levels of government put together2. But to
understand and strive towards this, mediocrity
has to be abandoned. When will we see real
Haitian patrons and philanthropists with a sense
of social commitment and dignity? When will we
see less philistine entrepreneurs? Why is it that,
for several years, the biggest sports and cultural
events in Haiti have mainly been sponsored by
foreign mobile phone companies? What does
this say about the vision of Haitian businessmen?
These questions are still unanswered.
In intellectual terms, too, Haiti raises some
unsettling questions. How has this State with no
idea of being a nation become a country without
government? It seems to us that the motto of
“everyone for themselves”, together with a very
jealous mistrust of its neighbours, can find its roots
in the country’s history, where the State has never
really embodied anything of any value. Haiti’s elite
has never worked for the development of the
country or the common good. First, because it
looks down, disparagingly, on the “illiterate
masses” and also because of its greed for power.
And the lingering odour of slavery in Haitian
society has not encouraged a sense of
responsibility, at any level of society. The
expression “sé pa fot moin” (it’s not my fault) has
become a national slogan. 
But if Haiti is not responsible... obviously,
someone else is. It is only a short step between
calling on foreign organisations to intervene and
then immediately denouncing the “interference”
of foreigners in Haitian life. The bankruptcy of the
country’s elite can be seen in the following
observation: for 200 years, as the Haitian
sociologist, Laënnec Hurbon, put it “the feeling of
being a citizen of this country has not been clear.
The mentality of the citizen has not evolved
much.” The question of skin colour, often utilized
by political parties in power, has widened the
social divide in a society of apartheid and has not
helped Haitians to find consensus around the
notion of “living together”. And, because
populism has exacerbated contempt for
intellectuals, they have been relieved of their
social responsibilities. The global success of Dany
Lafferière, Frankétienne, Lionel Trouillot, Gary
Victor, Yanick Lahens, Louis Philippe Dalembert,
to name but a few, proves that our writers are
able to conquer the world. What is more, some of
them took part in the “new social contract
movement” launched in 2004 by the Haitian
political collective known as the “Group of 184”,
which called on the Haitian people “to rise to the
challenge of overcoming the historical obstacles
that have hindered Haitian unity, blocked
development and, even today, led to the political,
social and economic decline of our country.” But,
once its “political leaders” abandoned the
movement, so did they.
Identity: one or many?
According to the Cameroonian sociologist, Axelle
Kabou, “every society is, in the first and final
analysis, responsible for the entirety of its history,
without exclusion.” It is therefore necessary that
our intellectuals urgently raise the issue of Haitian
identity. What, really, is it today? Is there one Haiti
or are there only fragments of a Haitian identity
scattered across the world? Can we speak of a
common Haitian stock that holds true for all
Haitians living in Haiti, the Dominican Republic,
Miami, Boston, New York, Paris and Montreal?
What is the best way to structure reflection on the
question and come up with different approaches? 
In the light of these points, which are only the
main strands of the problems inherent in the
tattered social, cultural and intellectual fabric of
Haiti, how to mobilise social knowledge and skills
in order to revitalise Haiti today?
I certainly do not claim to have THE answer to
such a complex question, given the context I have
just outlined. Nevertheless, it does seem possible
to set out some proposals, some of which are
already being implemented. 
The role of the diaspora 
Recently, Amos Cincir, my colleague at the
newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, wrote: “the country is
facing a significant exodus, especially of its elite.
No less than 10,000 Haitians, among the best
qualified, have been leaving the island every year
since 2000. But illegal migration often ends in
tragedy, with 1000 would-be emigrants dying
every year on the high seas. Those who do
succeed in leaving become the breadwinners for
the families who stay behind. Almost 40% of
Haitian homes depend on money sent home
from the diaspora. In 2008, family money
transfers reached $1.8 billion, or almost one third
of gross domestic product. Unfortunately, with
the global economic crisis, this source of income
is also decreasing, falling by at least 30% between
2008 and 2009. This hemorrhaging of manpower
and minds is just as much a catastrophe as a
second earthquake. Because the Haitians who are
Successive
governments
since 1986 have
claimed that
Haitian culture
is our greatest
asset. Yet
nothing has
been done to
show this
culture off. If it
were not for the
vitality and
talent of our
artists and
creators, this
culture would
also probably
be moribund
today.

leaving are those who represent the best hope for
rebuilding the country.” 
This exodus unfortunately only adds to the
83% of professionals already exiled from Haiti. So
it is clear that there can be no reconstruction or
reestablishment of Haiti without the active and
sustained participation of the Haitian diaspora.
The Prime Minister, Jean Max Bellerive, and the
minister for ex-patriot Haitians, Edwin Paraison,
clearly accepted this principle at the Montreal
Conference on 25 January this year, and during
the “Rebuilding Haiti – Horizon 2030” symposium
held at the École Polytechnique in Montreal by
the Study and Action Group for a New Haiti
(GRAHN), on 4 and 5 March. But we also know
that Haitians in Haiti have always been reticent
when it comes to their compatriots abroad. The
constitution of the Republic does not allow dual
nationality, and this has forced the majority of
the best Haitian brains, often against their
wishes, to opt for the nationality of their
adoptive country. Even so, without its diaspora,
Haiti would have disappeared long ago. 
Projects that UNESCO can support
The reconstruction of Haiti today has to be based
upon a mixture of science, intelligence,
competence, humanism and humility, too, in
order to build a fairer and more equal society. In
other words, Haitians need to design and build a
completely different country, with the prime
objective being the common good. To do this, it
will be indispensable to include the diaspora and
all the Haitian social networks.
The symposium on “Rebuilding Haiti –
Horizon 2030”, which attracted over 600
participants from Haiti and the four corners of
the its diaspora, clearly showed that Haitian men
and women can make concrete proposals to the
bodies concerned with the reconstruction of
their country, using ideas derived from a
participatory approach, as well as the expertise
and sensitivities available, both on the island and
abroad. 
Some 45 preliminary proposals3 came out of
this historic conference. 
Some education projects are already
underway, including establishing a permanent
structure for those in the diaspora working in
education and for friends of Haiti; a distance
learning structure capable, in the long term of
turning into an open or distance learning
university, covering the entire country; an
internship programme for Haitian students in
enterprises where members of the diaspora
occupy senior positions; skill sharing networks in
the disapora, aimed at knowledge transfer and
economic development. 
Concerning culture, GRAHN suggests, among
other initiatives, the creation of a fund for
heritage conservation and the development of
cultural enterprises across the country, as well as
launching a programme of travelling exhibitions
and other methods for disseminating culture
using new technologies.
Here, then, are a few projects that UNESCO
could support. I would also like to act as
spokesperson for artists and young Haitians by
asking UNESCO to help my country to find
partners to fund a real multi-purpose theatre
venue in Haiti.
Finally, it goes without saying that a new Haiti
must absolutely rid itself of the demons of
corruption at all levels. Let us not forget the
words of the French journalist, Edwy Plenel: “Once
exposed, financial corruption can be combated
and sanctioned. The corruption of ideas is more
insidious, more subtle and, in this respect, more
inherently dangerous”.4 

in Haiti, with its high rate of illiteracy, 94% of the
population owns a radio, according to a survey by
the French agency, Médiascom. But the FM band is
saturated – there are already over 40 stations in the
capital – and the government agency that looks at
applications for frequencies is no longer awarding
licenses. Competition is high for advertising
revenue and the “top” stations, like Métropole,
Vision 2000, Caraïbes, Ginen, Signal and Kiskeya
have grabbed the lion’s share. Many others, lacking
the necessary financial resources, broadcast
technically poor programmes, often put together
by completely untrained staff. These stations are no
more than sounding boards, devoting a significant
part of air time to petty politics, in the form of
accusations, indiscretions, slander, and clan
quarrels. The same holds for the dozen or so
television channels that have sprung up in the past
three years.
Articulate, objective and rigorous critical
thinking is the prerogative of a few seasoned
journalists. The two daily papers, Le Nouvelliste and
Le Matin, both of which started at the end of the
19th century, are still sentinels, despite their
modest circulation (20,000 copies per edition) and
very limited distribution outside the capital.
The Haitian press has not developed the
necessary detachment to help unite the Haitian
people. It has not marshalled the human resources
to rise to the huge challenges facing the country:
threat of earthquakes, urgent need for
redevelopment, environmentally damaging energy
production, education, reorganisation of the
economy and production, showcasing the
country’s art and culture. And this was the situation
for the Haitian media well before the earthquake of
12 January 2010. 
As with many other sectors of society, the media
were severely affected by the earthquake. Two
months on, most have resumed production, but with
the same old programme schedules and no sign of
any new commitment regarding the new challenges
posed by the catastrophe. However, Le Nouvelliste
and Le Matin have announced that they will be more
exacting, even militant, and that they will use the
tragedy as an opportunity for a “spring clean”.

enjoy to practise my vocation with a certain degree
of freedom. I am simply questioning certain
positions that have been adopted, some of which
verge on fanaticism, reinforcing existing rifts,
exacerbating political and social tensions and
fostering a mistrust of the press.
This failure of the media is part of a wider
context, where Haitian society has ceased to be
demanding, to reward merit, to have high
ambitions. It cannot seem to escape the
debilitating status quo it has been stuck in for the
past decades. Learning, which for a long time
underwrote political power, has not been used
judiciously. On the contrary, Haiti is one of the few
countries where knowledge is divisive. Meanwhile,
a magical-religious perception of science creates
the most incredible situations. And, for many of my
compatriots, the death of the 200,000 or so victims
of 12 January was not because building regulations
were flouted, but because of God! This was God’s
decision, they say. The churches are constantly full.
The priests are rubbing their hands.
Meanwhile, popular – not to say trivial –
entertainment still makes up the bulk of certain
radio stations, also overrun with advertisements for
imported products. Where are the real issues? “It’s
not what the public wants to hear,” you will be told.
And so, critical thinking continues to be stifled.
Reinventing the press
Now, even more than in the past, there is an urgent
need to work towards a paradigm shift in
information and to organize a States-General of the
press. This major change of direction – the
invention of a modern press, which is professional,
courageous, ambitious, freed from the grip of
political power and the financial establishment – is
easier said than done. But it must be done. It will be
a long and arduous process, requiring a responsible
partnership between State, regulatory bodies, and
independent media stakeholders. 
Before the earthquake, two different schools of
thought clashed on the need or not to have a law
regulating the press. Those who favour legislation
dream of regulatory bodies like the French Higher
Council for Radio and Television. Those who are
against, having endured the Duvalier dictatorships,
see dictatorial tendencies and backlash in any
attempt to introduce norms. The belief that we can
do everything without standards or constraints is a
form of atavism for us, in Haiti, and is an enormous
handicap.
First of all the Haitian press has to remodel
itself, before trying to mobilise social and
intellectual resources. In the short term, I think we
need to design training programmes for journalists.
The support of UNESCO, which has long-standing
links to the Haitian Association of Journalists, will
once again be welcome. The Ministry of Education,
the Ministry of Culture and Communication,
journalists’ associations and newspaper publishers’
associations, will have to work together to decide
on the curricula. And, besides training, we also
need to address another vexing question: paying
professional journalists a decent wage. Today, a
journalist’s basic salary is 100 Euros a month.
The challenge, in the world of communications,
as in other sectors, is enormous. Nevertheless, I
believe in the future of my country and in the
future of a new press. I believe that a new
intellectual, financial and political elite will emerge
from the ruins. A responsible elite that is committed
to building a different kind of citizenship, another
sense of community, a new meaning for the word
Haitian. The Haitian press, once it has been
remodelled, will play a leading role. To borrow a
friend’s expression, it has to “give responsible
freedom a try”, to make a clear-cut distinction
between the intellectual elite and Haitian politics –
in other words, to help the people to choose their
leaders carefully. If this is not done, we will once
again fail to get to the heart of the matter. We must
act now. 

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
Let us forget the idea right from the start that
the Haitian people are defeated, resigned, or
helpless. Let us not see Haiti as a disaster victim.
The world can and must learn lessons from the
recent tragedy in this country of 10 million
inhabitants, and from its lengthy history, in order
to attempt the radical change that is needed
more than ever in the current international
context.
What is this context? Cut-backs and more
cut-backs. Rich nations heavily in debt.
Questionable, or non-existent, proposals for
getting out of the crisis. Flagrant inequalities in
wealthy societies. The socially excluded left by
the wayside. Unemployment, bankruptcies,
suicides, misery, questions of identity – these are
just a few of the most conspicuous symptoms of
the lack of options for the future.
The real difference between the richest and
the poorest nations – and it is considerable – lies
in the fact that the former have the material,
intellectual and structural resources to change
the situation. On condition that they want to.
Because what is manifestly missing is the
political will. And perhaps the capacity to muster
the forces. We have to accept that the world is
not functioning as it should and provide
ourselves with the means to make a radical
change.

An accumulation of failures
A radical change has to be made, considering the
failures that have characterized the last 60 years:
there has been the failure of most development
policies; the failure of structural adjustment,
which was supposed to improve the economies of
developing countries sustainably; the failure, so
far, of the UN in conflict situations; the failure of
the European Union as a counter to the financial
frenzy of capitalism; failure of the major
ideological blocs, unable to provide any response
beyond their hegemonic needs and interests;
failure of the non-aligned countries’ promises to
propose a viable alternative to the deadly
dichotomy of the Cold War; failure of the
international Left, and in particular social
democracy, which has been unable to
counterbalance global disequilibrium; and, finally,
the failure of the progressive Left in our
developing countries, so often cornered with their
backs against the wall, abandoned by their
Western allies, who are too preoccupied with their
own political survival.
This accumulation of failures makes me think that
the real way out, for Haiti, can only come from
itself. Why, yet again, should we trust this apparent
willingness to “aid” Haiti today? Why should we
adhere blindly to hastily-drafted scenarios, often
drawn up far from our shores? Several Haitian
organizations and movements have denounced
the procedure adopted to draft Haiti's “Action Plan
for Reconstruction and Development”, from which
Haitian social and civil stakeholders were almost
totally excluded. I add my voice to theirs,
deploring this forced march, which does not allow
us to play an active role in reshaping our country.
Turn the current paradigm around
What we are calling for is a little more humility
and self-criticism. In an article dated 20 March
2010, Jonathan Katz (Associated Press) wrote
that, on 10 March, former U.S. President Bill
Former Haitian Minister of Culture (1995-1997),  Raoul Peck is also a film-
maker, author of L’homme sur les quais, Lumumba, L’affaire Villemin,
Sometimes in April, L’école du pouvoir.
After spending part of his childhood in Congo, he went to school in
France and the USA. He went on to study engineering and economics in
Germany, before entering the Berlin Academy of Film and Television,
where his career started.
Two days before the earthquake in Port-au-Prince, the city where he
was born, he was appointed, by presidential decree, head of La Fémis
École Nationale Supérieure des métiers de l’image et du son in Paris.
Clinton - now U.N. special envoy to Haiti –
“publicly apologized this month for championing
policies that destroyed Haiti's rice production.”
He declared before the American Senate’s
Foreign Affairs commission that “It may have
been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas,
[the state Mr Clinton comes from] but it has not
worked. It was a mistake.” 
Indeed, thirty years ago, Haiti imported just
19% of its food and exported rice and coffee. In
1986, the Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand
Aristide was forced, by Bill Clinton and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) among
others, to drop our trade barriers on the pretext
of structural adjustment. Today, again according
to Jonathan Katz, six pounds of rice from
Riceland Foods of Arkansas, incontestably the
largest rice producer in the world, sold for $3.80,
while the same quantity of Haitian-produced rice
sold for $5.12.
Also, let us not forget that the reason we are
mourning so many dead in Port-au-Prince is
precisely because tens of thousands of peasants,
with no resources, no means of production,
unable to compete with Western imports, had to
move there to look for work. 
Everything is related. The so-called remedies
of yesterday and the disasters of today. The
poverty of the one creates the wealth of the
other, and vice versa. Our destinies are linked by
common problems, to which international aid
alone cannot provide the solution. We need a
more global view. 
Tragedy and mourning such as Haiti is
currently living through can enable us to turn the
current paradigm around. Haiti could become a
new model for intervention. And this is as urgent
for countries of the South as it is for Western
cities, where inequalities are also continuing to
grow. The sooner we start this process of radical
change, the sooner we will be able to join
together in a common quest for more humanity,
justice, equality and – why not? – happiness.
Is this an ambitious, utopian project? I do not
think so. Despite all its failures, humanity has
demonstrated a great capacity for kindness,
creativity and courage – both individually and
collectively. 
Under foreign influence,
Haitian rice production was
destroyed in the 1990s. L
We have to accept that the world is not functioning 
as it should and provide ourselves with the means to
make a radical change.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
It is not possible to build the economy
of a country without first drafting an
economic policy and having an
administration that is capable of taking
responsibility for it. Yet Haiti has neither.
The economy is synonymous with the
idea of progress, which we do not have
either. And there is the rub. The ordinary
Haitian citizen does not regard himself
as an engineer helping to build his
country. He is waiting for progress to
come from outside. For him, prosperity
lies in God’s hands. 
We do not allow ourselves to build
our own country, to change our reality.
We vacillate over the right path to take
to rebuild our economy. We remain
stuck in a mire of uncertainty, not
knowing what to do. 
The 12 January 2010 disaster is
forcing us to take a close look at our
immobility. We can no longer put off
changes in the way the economy is run
– still very much dependent on external
rents from resources. With just a few
sources of income, mostly from coffee
production, this type of “rentier”
economy benefits only a tiny minority
of the population and excludes the vast
majority. The entire political life of Haiti
is organised around income from
renting resources, and strives to protect
the few elected representatives who
oppose any attempt to diversify, in
order to preserve their own privileges.
And, to do this, they will stop at nothing
to occupy important political posts.
Haitian households are locked into a
vicious circle, enduring extreme
hardship. They have to save for at least
ten years before they have enough
money to start building a house and
then spend the rest of their lives trying
to finish it. It is almost impossible to get
a loan in Haiti. The country’s whole
economy is based on savings, which
leads to cash collateral (i.e. credit equal
to the amount the borrower has in his
savings account) and, as a result, the
aberration of investing uniquely with
wealth that has already been acquired. 
This situation highlights the
absence of a monetary policy or credit
system that is open to the needs of
ordinary people, in a country where the
government is mainly concerned with
the interests of those with income from
external rents. This also explains the
emergence of government substitutes,
in the forms of NGOs, the international
community and … God! – all supposed
to look after the needs of the people. 
No salvation without credit
Haiti will never get back on its feet
without adopting an economy based on
credit. If the 200,000 families that fell
victim to the earthquake are ever to buy
a home again, they will have to be able
to get a mortgage that they can pay off
over 15 or 20 years. And, given that
most households cannot raise the

The Haitian economy’s

The prevailing immobility is sustaining an obsolete economy that
condemns Haiti to poverty and blocks progress. Rather than waiting 
for God to help them, Haitians should abolish the “rentier” system that paralyzes
the country.

obligatory 30% of the total purchase
price stipulated by law, their job should
stand as guarantee for the loan.
Also, if loans are given to
earthquake victims, then they should be
available to everyone. The whole credit
system has to be generalised and made
accessible to all, including, and above
all, to enterprises, so that they can grow
and provide jobs and thus enable
families to repay their loans.
Loans, then, should be based on the
future employment of borrowers, in
other words, on their skills, which
implies that they should be able to
receive training matched to the needs
of the market. The overall volume of
credits and investments will thus
depend on the capacity of the
workforce to be competitive on world
markets, and not on savings or foreign
aid. 
The credit economy is not matter of
the good will of political leaders or
individuals, but is a fundamental factor
in the productive apparatus of a nation.
If the State does not have a policy that
lends credibility to the various
economic stakeholders, then the
country will continue to flounder in the
same problems it has always had. 
To make the reconstruction of Haiti
possible, it is essential that the State
accepts to run an economy that is based
on the needs of all social groups and
not just an elite living on private income
from external rents.
Managing loans and gifts
The extraordinary solidarity shown by
the international community towards
Haiti translates as donations and loans
that will, above all, be used to rebuild
urban areas. Construction companies will
share the funds between them. And the
donors will be satisfied if the programme
is completed with a minimum of
corruption. 
But, with the exception of Port-au-
Prince, the impact of this aid on the
national economy will be minimal and
transient, if the decision is made to
import building materials on a massive
scale. Once the money has run out, the
State will have its buildings, a few
families will have homes, while
everyone else will be left to fend for
themselves. The ‘rentier’ economy will
have traversed a brief period of
prosperity, while the problems of
financing production and of
employment will remain unresolved.
The mismanagement of natural
disasters in the past six years speaks
volumes on this subject.
In order to get the full benefit of
outside aid and build the foundations
for a new economy, the country’s
leaders should appeal to international
institutions temporarily to exonerate
Haiti from certain rules regulating
international commerce. They should
also encourage setting up a first wave of
industries related to building (steel and
cement works, electrical equipment,
etc) and fitting out homes (appliances,
sanitary ware, decorating supplies),
which are sectors that have not been
promoted in the past because of the
lack of demand. Emphasis should also
be put on training, because it is only
with qualified workers and competitive
products that the country will be able to
pay off its external debt. 
Other changes will be necessary to
boost employment in Haiti, such as
decentralisation and local development;
social security reforms which encourage
workers to choose careers in industry;
reforms in economic policy that enable
the release of internal capital;
facilitation of public-private
partnerships to stimulate the
development of industry and to support
the State in sectors of the economy
where its presence is ineffectual;
university reforms to train more
professionals and supply the
administration with new ideas on
economic and social change. 

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
The relationship between culture and
development is the subject of a debate
that is far from exhausted. Let us define
the two concepts. What do we mean by
culture? As the French-Lebanese writer
Amin Maalouf said, the cultural
endowment of an individual or a
community is composed of a vertical
dimension, which we inherit from
ancestors and traditions, and a horizontal
one, shaped by our times and our
contemporaries. And what about
development? It requires more than a
decent standard of living and political
freedom, as the 2004 Human
Development Report from the United
Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) reminds us. Cultural liberty is now
recognized as a human right and an
important aspect of human development. 
There is however no clear
relationship between culture and
development. Waves of cultural
determinism emerge recurrently,
attributing the failures of growth and
democratization to inherent flaws in
cultural traits. To fight such dangerous
theories, we should consider that culture
is not uniquely critical in determining our
lives and identities. Gender, class,
profession, politics, human and material
resources are also hugely important.
Cultures evolve, hence a society's culture
may determine very little of its future
development. In short, I believe there is
no grand cultural theory of
development. 
Haitian people and artists possess a
formidable creativity that creates magic,
poetry, paintings, and music and “allows
exploration of the eternity of the
unknown”, to borrow an expression from

Cultural determinism can

that the failures of growth

cultural traits. The concept
of cultural identity must be
demythologized for
culture to be an asset in
social development.

### 189543: Culture and development: two sides of the coin
Bolivian writer Eduardo Scott Moreno.
Yet, in the words of one of his characters,
a Haitian intellectual in the novel La
Doncella del Baron Cemeterio (The
Servant of Baron Cimetière1),
“notwithstanding this, I see no social and
political future”.
The obvious contradiction indicates
that culture alone is not necessarily a
crucial factor of development, especially
if interpreted only as individualistic
artistic creativity and expression. Culture
can however be a potentially powerful
asset, which if appropriately stimulated
and encouraged also by public policies,
can lead to an enhanced social capital for
reconstruction. 
Another storm
Haiti represents the perfect storm2 of
development challenges, brought
about by two major causes: alienation
of the population and lack of
legitimate, functioning institutions. At
the centre of the storm is the lack of a
legitimate, valid social contract
between the government and citizens.
The recent natural disasters have
tragically aggravated the consequences
of such a storm and the Haitian people’s
suffering.
It is now generally acknowledged
that what Haiti needs more than
reconstruction is “re-foundation”. This
great challenge requires
accommodating cultural identity and
facilitating evolution, while avoiding
making it a myth, since it can hardly be
achieved without significant
transformational changes in political
leadership, institutional capacity and
social movements and without a shared
understanding of what constitutes the
national sustainable development goal.
The cultural and creativity capital
should be channelled through
incentives and policies aiming to
strengthen people’s social capital, i.e.
the value, mechanisms, trust and
interactions that enable the
maximisation of the country’s
development potential.
The Action Plan for national
development prepared by the
Government points to some promising
paths, such as decentralization,
territorial poles of development and
investments in culture. Understandably,
those who wrote it were focused on
people’s suffering, and had despair and
urgency in mind. But for a vision to
come true it cannot be determined top-
down, as it is the case for the Plan. 
The first re-foundational task is
therefore to create a national political
leadership capable of using
decentralization as a vehicle for people’s
genuine participation in determining
local and national priorities. This
leadership must be able to devise
implementation and political and
financial accountability systems that
allow Haitian citizens to be engaged
actors and not just supposed
“beneficiaries”. 
I believe that the opportunity ahead
for Haiti is to make a fresh start by
defining a vision, a national economic
and social project with which all citizens
can identify, for which their culture and
creativity can serve as an essential tool
linked to all domains of life. 

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
Long before the magnitude 7.0
earthquake struck Haiti on January 12
and leveled the metropolitan capital
city of Port-au-Prince and its
surrounding areas, that city was already
a disaster in the making.  In 1950, Port-
au-Prince had a population of 150,000.
It reached 732,000 by 1982 and
between 2 and 3 million by 2008.  The
problem, however, is that the city’s
infrastructure did not expand
commensurably with this phenomenal
growth in population.  What few
services were provided were poorly
administered or primarily served the
needs of the wealthier districts or
suburbs.  Consider, for example, that
only about 28 percent of Haitians have
access to health care, 54 percent to
potable water, and 30 percent to
sanitation services.  In short, the Haitian
state long ago abdicated its
responsibilities to the majority of
Haitian citizens, both urban and rural,
and at least since the Duvalier era has
deferred to bilateral and multilateral aid
donors and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) to provide
services to the population.  More NGOs
per capita operate in Haiti than in any
other country in the world, and they
provide 70 percent of health care and
80 percent of public services in rural
areas.  This, in turn, has reinforced the
state’s laisser-aller practices and led to
the near total privatization of basic
services.  Unfortunately the turn to
democratic rule has not changed that
basic reality.   
Estimates put the death toll at 250
to 300,000.  The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) estimates the
total damage and losses caused by the
earthquake at between $8 and $13
billion, thereby making it the costliest
disaster in recent recorded history.
More than 1.3 million people have been
rendered homeless, and only 50 to 60
percent of them have received some
emergency shelter.  Haitian geologists
had warned of the probability of an
earthquake for years, but, as with
previous massive destruction and loss of
lives caused by hurricanes and tropical
storms (in 2004 and 2008), the
government took no measures to
prepare for that eventuality.  The
capacity of the Haitian state to respond
to a crisis of this magnitude (or even to
less severe ones) is nonexistent
primarily because of shortsighted
practices and policies that always
prioritized the interests of the few.
Along with Bolivia, Haiti has the highest
income inequality in the hemisphere.
The richest 10 percent of the population
control 47 percent of national income,
and 2 percent hold 26 percent of the
nation’s wealth.  By contrast, the poorest
20 percent receive 1.1 percent of
national income; 76 percent of the
population live on less than US$2/day,
and more than half live on less than
US$1/day.     
The dominant economic and
political classes of Haiti did not create
these conditions alone but did so in
close partnership with foreign
governments and economic actors with
long-standing interests in Haiti,
principally those of the advanced
countries (the United States, Canada,
and France) and their international
financial institutions (the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and
the Inter-American Development Bank).
These institutions pursued a twofold
strategy that succeeded in transforming
Haiti into a supplier of the cheapest

### 189544: The Four pillars of Haitian reconstruction
and long term that calls for
decentralizing power, population, and
industry from Port-au-Prince, and
investing billions of dollars in
infrastructure, construction, tourism,
environmental protection, government
services, and agriculture.    
No doubt, many of the
recommendations of the plan must be
included in any meaningful
reconstruction of the shattered
economy.  But, given the government’s
incapacity to take effective action after
the devastations caused by hurricanes
and tropical storms in 2008, it is
doubtful it will do anything different
this time around, especially since its
mandate will soon expire. The
international community issued its vote
of no confidence on the government by
insisting that an Interim Development
Agency and a Multi-Donors Trust Fund
be created and administered by a
steering committee comprised of 17
voting members.  Of those 17 members,
eight will be representatives from the
principal international donor
community (i.e., the United States,
Canada, France, Brazil, the European
Union, the IDB, the World Bank, and the
United Nations), one from the CARICOM
[Caribbean Community], one from other
financial donors, and seven from Haiti..
It is clear, then, that the representatives
from the international community will
have a majority vote in what is being
labor for foreign and domestic investors
in the export assembly industry and one
of the largest importers of U.S. food in
the hemisphere.  These outcomes were
achieved through a series of “structural
adjustment” policies that maintained
wages low, dismantled all obstacles to
free trade, removed tariffs and
quantitative restrictions on imports,
offered tax incentives to the
manufacturing industries on their
profits and exports, privatized public
enterprises, reduced public-sector
employment, and curbed social
spending to reduce fiscal deficits.
At the same time, reducing tariffs
and quantitative restrictions on food
imports since the 1980s was detrimental
to agriculture.  Whereas in the 1970s
Haiti imported at most 10 percent of its
food needs, currently it imports nearly
60 percent and is spending 80 percent
of its export revenues to pay for it.  Haiti
went from being self-sufficient in the
production of rice, sugar, poultry, and
pork to become the fourth-largest
importer of rice from the United States
in the world and the largest importer of
foodstuffs from the United States in the
Caribbean.  Trade liberalization, then,
essentially meant transferring wealth
from Haitian to U.S. farmers and the few
firms in Haiti that control food imports.
As the economy continued to decline,
Haiti became increasingly dependent
on remittances from its emigrants,
which in 2008 represented 20 percent of
Haiti’s gross domestic product.  
Pressure is mounting on bilateral
and multilateral aid donors to cancel
Haiti’s debt.  In 2009, the international
financial institutions cancelled US$1.2
billion of Haiti’s debt, but another
US$1.2 billion remains. The United
States and the IMF said that they would
work again with the other multilateral
and bilateral aid donors to provide debt
relief to Haiti.  However, as significant as
these measures are, they do not change
these institutions’ overall policies or
repair the damage their policies have
done to the Haitian economy over the
past four decades.  
International community again takes
charge of Haiti’s fate
What, then, needs to be done?  New
parliamentary elections were scheduled
for February and March of this year, but
they have been postponed.  President
Préval and Edmund Mulet, the new UN
Mission chief in Haiti, have renewed
their demands for elections to be held
as soon as possible.  Presidential
elections were to be held also in
November, but it is unclear when they
will be scheduled. In the meantime, the
government released the “Action Plan
for the Reconstruction and National
Development of Haiti,” also known as
the “Post-Disaster Needs Assessment”
(PDNA) plan drafted with members of
the international agencies and financial
institutions.  The plan estimates the cost
of reconstruction at $11.5 billion, and
lays out a vision for the short, medium,

### 189544: The Four pillars of Haitian reconstruction
presented as a Haitian development
and reconstruction plan.  
What’s more, whereas the PDNA is
vague on the specific industrial and
agricultural policies it proposes, the
international community had already
decided what they will be long before
the earthquake.  In 2009, UN Secretary-
General Ban ki-Moon commissioned
former World Bank economist Paul
Collier to lay out a development plan for
Haiti, and appointed former US
President Bill Clinton to spearhead it.  In
a language similar to the PDNA’s,
Collier’s report calls for decentralizing
investments, building road and
communication networks, and creating
clusters of industrial and agricultural
production in different parts of the
country.  The latter, however, consist
essentially of establishing free-trade
zones for garment production beyond
the two that currently exist in Port-au-
Prince and Ouanaminthe, and similar
clusters for the production and export
of selected agricultural products. 
Rethinking the paradigms
From my perspective, then, if Haiti is to
be rebuilt on a different foundation that
prioritizes the needs and interests of the
impoverished majority, it will be
necessary to rethink the paradigms that
have become a doxy for the major
powers and accepted uncritically by
Haiti’s compliant governments.  Such a
rethinking has been taking place
among rural and urban grassroots
organizations and various sectors of civil
society that have been systematically
ignored and marginalized in the
formulation of the official plan.  The
alternative agenda  
1. Reject or renegotiate all the different
versions of the structural adjustment
policies of the international financial
institutions.
2. Launch an immediate large-scale and
national public works project to
rebuild and expand Haiti’s
infrastructure, communication,
transportation, public schools, public
health facilities, and public housing.  
3. Prioritize Haiti’s food security and
sovereignty by subsidizing
production for the local market, and
promote the development of small
and medium-size industries that use
domestic inputs to produce
consumer and durable goods for the
national market, and, where
appropriate, for export, such as, for
example, handicraft production.
4. Protect the rights of all workers,
including the right to form trade
unions, the right to collective
bargaining, the right to strike, and the
right to a living wage.  
It is obvious that these goals cannot be
implemented all at once or immediately,
but they must serve as the basis for a
large-scale popular mobilization to hold
the government to account and to
renegotiate Haiti’s relations with the
international community.   One can also
hope that the next time around, a
mobilized population will not surrender
its fate to false prophets. 

Ten days after the earthquake, which killed 17
students and staff at Quisqueya University,
you had organized a volunteer system. How
did this begin? 
First the medical students set up in a tent on the
parking lot. They were supervised initially by
their teachers, then by a team of Slovak doctors
who arrived with medicine and equipment
looking for somewhere to work. Then the
students set up a mobile clinic. After that came
fresh water distribution points. The engineering
and environmental students went out into the
streets, helped people organize themselves into
committees to manage the improvised camps as
well as introducing work on zoning, sanitation
and waste management. The university became
a giant volunteering machine!  
Eleven more tents went up. Education
students were given a crash course in
psychosocial support and put it into practice
almost at once again on the streets. They also
became involved in running art therapy
workshops for children at the weekends, 150 at a
time, in one of the tents. I said to them: “The
street is your university now”. 
At the weekend students gathered with their
teachers to formalize the non-formal education
they had been getting during the week, or to put
theory on the practice. We are working on a
system to give them academic credits for this
work. It changed the paradigm of education for
them. They realised that further education
doesn’t have to be one-way, that it doesn’t have
to take place within four walls with an all-
knowing teacher dispensing knowledge. With the
volunteering initiative, knowledge is acquired in
the street and the teacher accompanies the
process. We are de-institutionalising knowledge.   

### 189545: Street university
A new model of education has emerged from the ruins of Haiti’s Quisqueya University,
which was entirely destroyed by the earthquake on 12 January 2010. Driven by skills-
based volunteering and emphasizing partnerships, it was initiated by rector Jacky
Lumarque. These are excerpts from an interview he gave to Jean O’Sullivan of EduInfo.

### 189545: Street university
Were students able to continue studying?  
We wired up one of the tents. We call it “the
digital tent”. Videoconferences were held with
sister universities in Montreal and Paris for
students doing master’s degrees. We are looking
into online classes to enable students who have
almost finished their courses to graduate.    
What is the next step? 
Given that 400 to 500 new students were not
able to begin the second semester that was due
to begin at the end of January. We are now
giving them a basic grounding or foundation
course of 15 weeks’ general education combined
with short courses in basic management,
logistics, first aid, risk prevention, community
organization, etc. 
The big challenge is to get the university up
and running in a sustainable way by setting up a
system of sponsorship by which donors support
individual students to the tune of $200 a month.
This enables them to meet their basic living
expenses while they continue volunteering, but
also to pay tuition costs and thus contribute to
the running and staffing of the university. We
badly need this sponsorship as we are a private
university and get nothing from the state

what needs to be done to rebuild Haiti’s
education system?  
Completely. In the light of the devastation of the
education system, I have redrafted proposals for
a National Education Pact for the Haitian
Government. Today the question is not so much
getting pupils “back into school” as to get all
Haitian children into school – including the 25
per cent of five-to-eleven-year-olds who did not
attend school before the earthquake hit. I have
consulted a wide cross-section of parents,
teachers, students, and education NGOs on this
issue. The education budget is currently 9 per
cent of Haiti’s GDP. I would like to see it rise to 25
per cent in 2015 and 30 per cent in 2025. The
objective would be 100 per cent enrolment, free
education, textbooks, materials and a hot meal
daily for each child. Accelerated teacher training
is essential for this to work. The proposals are
ambitious but we can’t afford to have a two-
speed system any more. 

Since Toussaint Louverture in 1801, every Haitian
government, with the exception of that of
Alexandre Pétion (1806 – 1818) has had a political
and administrative body responsible for education.
Article 19 of the Constitution of 1805, signed by
Emperor Jean Jacques Dessalines, made education
a matter of State concern. King Henry I, better
known as King Henry Christophe – who formed a
separatist government in the north of the country
(1807 – 1820), while the south was under the
control of Alexandre Pétion – was ahead of his
time with regard to education, including higher
education, and in the practice of arts and crafts. 
All constitutions from 1843 to 1987 confirm
the right of every Haitian child, boy or girl, to basic
education that is “free and common to all citizens,”
as a priority and an obligation. However, the
country has never been able to implement an
education system that follows the cardinal values
set out in the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. And, long before 12 January, it was obvious
that the education system needed to be
overhauled. 
Instead of instilling a respect for human rights
and basic freedoms, Haitian schools have tended
to perpetuate a society based on inequality and
injustice. A society comprised of individuals with

### 189546: Reform instead of repetition
On paper, quality education has been a
priority in Haiti for 200 years. In reality, the
system is stagnating and helps sustain a
society based on inequality and injustice.

by reforming, for example, the inspection
system. We have to do everything we can to
ensure that the Haitian government’s efforts to
set up a national educational system are
respected, without taking sides. Existing
curricula must also be revised so that they are
better adapted to the needs of industry, to
environmental concerns and citizenship values.
Meanwhile, resources have to be allocated for
higher education reforms. There is a pressing
need to establish adequate infrastructure, while
upgrading teachers’ career prospects so that they
earn a decent living. 
Any overhaul of the Haitian education system
has to favour the emergence of a new generation
of citizen-producers who are able continuously
to improve physical conditions in Haiti and to
create wealth, while helping the country’s
cultural, moral and spiritual values to flourish.
The new education system must be capable of
fostering a national consciousness, a sense of
responsibility and a community spirit by
incorporating in its content the facts of Haitian
reality 
no sense of national conscience, scant regard for
their fellow citizens and who exclude and
dehumanize others. Our system has been unable
to eradicate the defects of the country’s colonial
heritage. 
Haiti has become a backward country, slipping
further into illiteracy and poverty every day. 
A catastrophic state of affairs 
Just one university, a few teacher training
institutes and a single college offering basic and
continuous training for those working in
education. Out of 60,000 teachers, just 10.64 %
have basic professional qualifications. Teachers
are also recruited from other professions, with no
specific pedagogical training. Worse still, some
teachers have had no higher education at all. But
even when teachers are qualified, their
effectiveness is limited by having to teach over
40 hours of lessons a week. 
Another influence on the quality of
education is the dilapidated state of school
buildings, which often do not comply with
official norms.
Access to primary education can hardly be
called free, as about 82 % of schools belong to
the private sector (according to a 2003 census of
schools).
Secondary education has been waiting for
reforms since 1980, but virtually no studies on
the subject have been conducted. Meanwhile,
reforms of higher education in general and of the
Haiti State University in particular have been
stagnating since 1997. Research and publications
are very rare, apart from student dissertations.
How did this situation come about? The main
reason is a lack of vision. The State education
budget is small, with government manipulated
by an old-fashioned oligarchy with little ambition.
A serious problem of governance and corruption
is an added complication. The Ministry of
Education has no real control over the system and
certain projects hardly get off the ground. 
The country’s political instability also has a
negative impact on education. Ministers have
very little time to draft, revise and implement a
proper national education policy. Over the past
162 years, there have been 216 successive
Education ministers – an average of 9.4 months in
office per person. This situation is responsible for
an almost total lack of continuity in the sector.
A new ideological choice
How to overhaul this system without getting
stuck in the same vicious circles, with the same
causes producing the same effects? We need to
make a new ideological choice, one that
considers quality education as a prerequisite to a
flourishing society. We have to establish other
mechanisms of governance, leaving party
politics and vote-catching considerations aside,

Holding a spade, Jean Sprumont works with
vigorous gestures. After a few minutes, in the
courtyard cluttered with sieves and moulds for
concrete blocks, a crater of cement, sand and
water has taken form. Showing the greyish paste,
Sprumont speaks in Creole to the 15 Haitian
construction workers attending the training
course in earthquake-resistant methods: “Sa se
béton kalité. Kalité do kibon pouli é lyben brasé”
(This is good concrete. It has the right quantity of
water and it is well mixed).
Jean Sprumont stands out among the
trainers. The Belgian project manager has been
living in Haiti for 44 years. He was in Port-au-
Prince on 12 January and saw entire buildings
collapse in a few seconds. “The city was built
using concrete in a completely haphazard way,”
he says bitterly. “We saw the tragic result.”
According to Sprumont, “It was buildings that
killed people. Too much water and the presence
of clay and loam in the concrete caused the
collapse of more than 50 % of the buildings in
Port-au-Prince during the tremors.”
To correct bad construction habits that
amplified the disaster’s magnitude, the technical
training centre at Camp Perrin, near Les Cayes in
southwest Haiti, has set up a ten-day intensive
training course for Haitian masons, steel fixers
and foremen, in partnership with UNESCO.  “It’s a
good training course, but you can’t learn

How to use earthquake-resistant methods in building
– this is what Haitian masons are learning from the
pilot project in Camp-Perrin, southwest Haiti, which
UNESCO launched in March 2010.  The project will
train some 500 masons in techniques that will help
save many lives in case of an earthquake.

everything about earthquake-resistant
construction in ten days,” points out Hébert
Montuma, who runs the centre.
Michel Raoul, 40-year-old mason from Camp
Perrin, is attending this training course so he can
“avoid repeating the same mistakes they made in
the past. But the problem is often caused by the
owner. He tells us, “Protect me for the cement” (do
not spend too much on the cement). But instead
of protecting him, this can kill him.”
This is why, says Montuma, “Besides the
techniques we are teaching here, we have to make
builders aware that when they are working on a
site, it is their duty to be professional and ethical.”
The third group of builders will soon begin
taking the course (with 10 to 15 participants per
session). The project will train a total of about 500
masons in techniques that will help save many
lives in case of an earthquake. To train a
maximum number of builders and pass on the
skills more effectively, the best students in each
group are encouraged to become trainers
themselves. 
At the end of the training project, a book in
French and Creole containing explanations
illustrated with diagrams will be published and
distributed to building professionals around the
country. 
Camp-Perrin – March 2010
Children in Port au Prince began
returning to school three
months after the deadly
earthquake on 12 January 2010. 
But their normal lessons were replaced by a
special syllabus developed by UNESCO and the
Haitian Ministry of Education to take into
account the trauma and disruption experienced
by both children and teachers.
Developed by UNESCO and the Haitian
Ministry of Education and Professional Training at
a seminar held on 25 and 26 March, the syllabus
will be followed by some 600,000 pupils in both
public and private education  
“We have given priority to main objectives,”
declared Jackson Pleteau, Head of Secondary
Education at the Ministry. “We defined a corpus
of knowledge that pupils must master to
complete the year. We also envisage deferring
certain subjects to next year.”
Under the new syllabus, education will be
resumed in stages starting with psychosocial
activities, such as singing, dancing and creative
expression, to help children cope with the
extreme stress they experienced as a result of the
earthquake. They will also learn about
earthquakes as a natural phenomenon. Regular
lessons will resume a few weeks later. The
Ministry of Education foresees an accelerated
programme over 18 weeks to allow pupils to
complete the school year that ends in August.
UNESCO will post this syllabus on line to make it
available to all teachers in Haiti. 
Emergency
syllabus for
schools
Some 38,000 pupils and students died in
the 12 January earthquake, which also
killed 1,300 teachers and education
personnel. The Ministry of Education was
destroyed along with 4,000 schools 
– or close to 80 % of educational
establishments in the Port-au-Prince area.

However, only a few schools have been able
to open their doors so far and very few children
have turned up for classes. 
In most places, rubble is still being cleared
and tent classrooms are being set up to
accommodate pupils safely. Such is the case of
the co-educational Thérèse Rouchon School in
the Turgeau neighbourhood. Still visible among
the debris are wooden benches, exam papers
and the blackboard with notes from the last
lesson given a few hours before tragedy struck.
Sainte Marie des Anges, a school in the
elegant Paco neighbourhood, has fared little
better. The boys’ building is completely
destroyed, while cracks and gaping holes in the
facade of the girls’ brick building mean that it
cannot be used either.
The Principal, Pastor Franck Petit, had a large
hangar built with wooden partitions. The school
re-opened but the return to class has been
difficult for the children who turned up. “They
have reacted in different ways,” said Pastor Petit.
“Some cried and refused to enter the building,
afraid they might get buried alive.” He had to
explain that the new wooden school rooms were
safe. “Several children,” he adds, “cried while we
hoisted the flag, possibly in mourning for a
relative, a mother, a sister, we don’t know. It is
very hard, for both pupils and teachers.”
Some 38,000 pupils and students died in the
12 January earthquake, which also killed 1,300
teachers and education personnel. The Ministry
of Education was destroyed along with 4,000
schools – or close to 80 % of educational
establishments in the Port-au-Prince area. 
Psychological support 
Overcoming the trauma of the earthquake 
and restoring faith in the future: these were 
the objectives of a three-day training course 
at the end of April 2010 for secondary school
education administrators in Haiti, organized 
by the Haitian Ministry of National Education
and UNESCO. These administrators will be
responsible for training teachers in the field, 
so that they in turn can pass on this
knowledge to schoolchildren.
This type of psychosocial support aims 
at preventing and easing the mental after-
effects of catastrophes or violent events. 
This concept is based on team-building
techniques, role playing and discussions
between pupils and their teachers. 
The seminar was attended by 40 inspectors,
principals and teachers. The course also
included training on earthquake phenomena,
risk prevention and survival techniques. 
The course was organized by UNESCO,
with the support of Quisqueya University in
Port-au-Prince. It is the first psychosocial
training course for young people in 
secondary schools. 
Ultimately, all secondary pupils in the
western Department which includes Port-au-
Prince, i.e. approximately 110,000 adolescents,
will benefit from this support programme,
which will be extended to the entire country 
in the long term.

When Haiti became one of UNESCO’s first
members, the rate of illiteracy in the country was
over 80%, in some areas even well over 90%. This
comprised not only the inability to read and
write, but also ignorance of basic scientific
principles concerning agriculture, conservation of
resources and hygiene. Haiti’s president of the
time, Dumarsais Estimé, proposed to UNESCO to
support Haiti in increasing the fundamental
education of its population. Julian Huxley,
UNESCO’s first Director-General, who had just
declared that basic education is an essential part
of “the wider and fuller human understanding to
which UNESCO is dedicated”, accepted the
proposition and UNESCO started a pilot project
on basic education, the first of its kind, in 1947. 
In April 1948, UNESCO sent a survey team to
Haiti headed by the Swiss anthropologist Alfred
Metraux. The site chosen by the Haitian
government for the new Pilot project was the

Kêbé l’Inesko Fò!
By Julia Pohle, from UNESCO Archives 
As one of the first member states, Haiti joined UNESCO on
November 18, 1946. Soon after, UNESCO launched its first pilot
project in basic education in the country. The objective was to
reduce illiteracy. The project was almost scrapped; the local
population saved it.

rural section of Marbial, in the valley of the
Gosseline River in the south of Haiti. The
population of the valley had been estimated at
about 30,000 peasants, living scattered over the
steep mountains in isolated shacks. The
conditions found by the team on their arrival
were at their worst. The valley was over-
populated, the illiterate peasants could hardly live
on the scanty crops they grew on the eroding soil
and they suffered from tropical diseases like
malaria. Because of sickness and the fact that
many children would have to walk two hours to
attend school, less than 500 pupils were
registered in the three schools serving the valley,
and only half of them actually attended the
lessons. 
Besides these problems, there was a
tremendous language barrier to education.
Although the official language of Haiti was
French, Marbial’s people only spoke Creole and
textbooks in this language were not available
since there was no agreement on which of the
four methods of spelling Creole should be
adopted. Teachers were using 50-year-old French
textbooks from which pupils had to memorize
passages, without any real understanding of the
language. To resolve this problem, UNESCO
invited Robert Hall, an American professor who
had done research on Creole in the United States.

Once arrived in Haiti, Dr. Hall established an
alphabet so that the preparation of basic
textbooks in Creole could go ahead. 
Discouraged by conditions in the valley and
the hopelessness of the Marbial peasants,
Metraux returned to UNESCO, giving a very
pessimistic report concerning the success of the
pilot project. Nevertheless, he disagreed when
Frederick Rex, an American fundamental
education specialist, visited Marbial valley some
month later and judged the undertaking
impossible, recommending that UNESCO
abandon the project. Writing to UNESCO, Dr.
Metraux insisted: “We cannot pull out from Haiti
[…] we cannot abandon these people. If we do,
we shall break their spirit completely […]
Whatever has been done in the field of
education will collapse. This will be a complete
disaster […] The UNESCO Pilot Project is an
experience which is worth all our energy.” 
At that point, the peasants of Marbial,
hearing the rumours that UNESCO might
abandon them, joined the efforts.
Demonstrating with huge picket signs reading
“Kêbé l’Inesko Fò! “ – which in Creole means
“Support UNESCO hard” – they sprang into
action. Within a few months, their co-operatives
turned the trail to the only village of the area into
a road and built up an ‘UNESCO-centre’ as well as
a community-centre, which helped the people of
the valley to break out of their isolation. The
peasants dug latrines and a well for drinking
water in order to erase one of the most
dangerous sources of disease. They
reconstructed the Marbial market on higher and
drier ground and constructed a small open-air
slaughter house. 
Also in education, there was remarkable
progress in these first years: An emergency
feeding programme for school children was
introduced, giving a substantial lunch to 400
children weekly. Until September 1948, ten
education centres were created, teaching old
and young in the Valley to read and write in
Creole. Soon a local newspaper of two pages
appeared, handwritten and illustrated with
simple drawings, through the initiative of a few
members of the co-operatives. 
Despite the peasants’ efforts, UNESCO saw
itself confronted with an immense challenge:
raising the social and economic level of the
community through education and at the same
time training Haitian teachers and workers so
that the project might become self-supporting
as rapidly as possible. It was soon obvious that all
progress in the valley would depend on the
improvement of agricultures. That is the reason
why Conrad J. Opper, appointed as Director to
the pilot project in 1950, asked the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
to join in the Marbial project. Mr. Opper
reported: “There is no possible doubt that a
project in Fundamental Education in the Marbial
area which is not based on soil regeneration is
unrealistic and doomed to failure.” The World
Health Organization (WHO) also took an active
part in the project, sending a doctor and a nurse
to the valley. It further helped to open a new
hospital in Marbial, thus giving the valley its first
dispensary facilities. 
During this perhaps unspectacular, but steady
development, Mr. Opper and its team tried to
keep in the background as much as possible,
placing the project in the hand of the people it
was intended to help. This policy proved so
successful, that in August 1950 the Marbial
people formed a regional committee of local
leaders to advise the UNESCO staff. The common
effort of different UN agencies helped the Marbial
valley to improve the living conditions of its
peasants. But when the pilot project succeeded, it
did it thanks to the Haitian people. 

The example of the Marbial valley pilot project is just one example of
UNESCO’s work in Haiti in the field of education, culture, science and
communication. There is clear continuity from this early vision to
UNESCO’s contribution at the beginning of the 21st century. Original

Your life as an adult and as a poet
began with what you later called 
"a triple badge of rebellion": proud
négritude, impassioned surrealism, and
the idea of revolution. Today only the
surrealism part seems to have survived. 
It's a long story. When André Breton
came to Haiti at the end of 1945, his visit
coincided with an exhibition of the
Cuban painter Wifredo Lam's paintings
and a series of lectures given by the
Martinique poet Aimé Césaire. This
really fired the imagination of us young
Haitian artists and writers. At that time
we knew nothing about what was
happening in the surrealist movement
in France. For young people combating
President Elie Lescot's dreadful
dictatorship, surrealism was the
lifeblood of revolt. Contact with Breton
had a contagious effect on us. After his
first lecture in a Port-au-Prince cinema,
we brought out a special issue of our
new magazine La Ruche as a tribute to
him. We went to prison for our pains
and the magazine was banned. What
Breton discovered in Haiti, and made us
discover too, was that surrealism wasn't
just an aesthetic doctrine but
something that could be part of a
people's way of looking at the world;
that there was a kind of grassroots
surrealism. This restored our self-
confidence. We saw that this sense of
wonder we had secretly been a bit
ashamed of and associated with a kind
of underdevelopment was actually our
weapon. Breton told us that in France

René Depestre: 
Between utopia and reality
In this interview published in the UNESCO Courier in December 1997, the French-
Haitian author René Depestre discusses his career in an interview with Jasmina
Šopova. He reiterates his rejection of totalitarian ideology and his commitment to
global citizenship, founded on solidarity and mutual respect. 
"we launched surrealism as a movement
based on intellectual foundations, you
in Haiti learned all about it in the cradle."
In other words, surrealism was
something inherent in the Caribbean.
Voodoo, a product of Franco-African
syncretism, is an example of religious
surrealism. The behaviour of the voodoo
gods is supremely surrealist. 
So surrealism for you is much more
than a literary movement. 
Much more. Many European writers,
starting with the German Romantics
and even before that, had a surrealist
approach. I'm sure if you looked closely
at Egyptian, Japanese or Chinese
culture, you'd find surrealist elements
there too. For one, surrealism is a way of

injecting the supernatural into everyday
life. You find it everywhere. But some
people, like Haitians or Brazilians,
display it more boldly than others.
How do you explain the emergence of
the Duvaliers in a society imbued
with a sense of the magical? 
The magical has even marked Haitian
politics. Our history has thrown up
dictators who practised a kind of tragic
perversion of magic. This is how the
"Tonton Macoute" which is a folk
concept, an incarnation of evil, a kind of
Nazi, a Haitian SS-man came to exist.
Haitian folklore is a tug-of-war between
good and evil. The elder Duvalier, "Papa
Doc," used the forces of black magic to
plunge the country into a totalitarian
surrealism. But there's more to it than
this demoniacal aspect. From the
December morning in 1492 when
Christopher Columbus discovered Haiti
and was transfixed by what he saw, the
historic, baroque tale of Haiti cannot be
separated from American wondrous
realism. A sense of the wondrous (South
American magic realism) has become
part and parcel of Haitians' view of the
world and the sustenance of their third
of the  island of Hispaniola, where the
best and the worst rub shoulders like
the dearest of friends, when they are
not locked in terrible combat. 
You have celebrated the communist
utopia in your poems. 
The Marxist utopia, with all its lies and
repressive nightmares, took over my
work and my life as a poet until the
moment I broke with Stalinism. After
living in places which had a huge
"strategic" importance in the turmoil of
our century Moscow, Prague, Beijing,
Hanoi and Havana I realized that what
was meant by "socialist revolution" in
those places was not the opposite of the
Haitian terror regime, but another form
of the same perversion. Instead of
promoting the heritage of the rights of
man and the citizen, "the revolution"
defiled the autonomy of women and
men and carried out, at their expense,
the most amazing hijack of ideals and
dreams in all human history. 
What has become of the "revolutionary
ideal" which drew you from Haiti to
Europe and then on to Cuba? 
I ardently believed in revolution. For me it
became a kind of natural state, like
breathing, walking or swimming. And it
nearly destroyed my integrity as a citizen
and a writer. The ideal of revolution
seriously impoverished my personal store
of poetry and tenderness which, when I
was twenty, made me think of my future
work as a state of wonder and oneness
with the world. It made my literary career
that of a writer who performed
psychological and intellectual
somersaults and sudden existential
about-turns a kind of carnival of
uncertainties and inconsistencies, adrift
in the furious currents of the century's
passions and ideals. The treasure islands
invented by the utopias and mythologies
of revolution went up in smoke with the
great dreams of our youth uniting the
idea of transforming the world (Karl Marx)
with that of changing life (Arthur
Rimbaud). 
The word "utopia" as used by Marxists
has a pejorative meaning for you. But
doesn't the world need utopias? 
Octavio Paz has defined utopias as "the
dreams of reason." We're just emerging
from a terrible nightmare of reason. The
nineteenth century, a critical age if ever
there was one, gave birth to the idea of a
revolutionary utopia. But the totally
legitimate dream of earlier philosophers
did not turn into the major
transformation of human lives they had
hoped for, nor into unprecedented
progress for humankind. The generous
aspirations of critical thought imposed on
us, under the bogus label of "real
socialism," an absolutism the like of which
we had never seen before. In saying this I
do not wish to denigrate the idea of
utopia as such. Old age reminds me these
days that I don't have much time left and
that I must hasten to express things I've
kept to myself all my life. And hopefully
express them with grace and maturity. So,
in a way, I'm summing up my life's
nomadic journey. And all self-criticism
leads one to utopia. But hardened
observer that I am, I deeply distrust a
historical concept that this century's
revolutions have debased. In place of the
notion of realpolitik, which is at the root
of most of the woes of people and
societies and which still flourishes to an
extraordinary degree in government, I
offer the notion “realutopia”. 
Could you explain what you mean by
“realutopia”:?
It's an aesthetic concept which enables
me to unite the various parts of my
Franco-Haitian creole-ness as a writer.
Doctors and physiologists call synergy
the links between several elements which
combine in a single function and a
common effect. The idea of realutopia
leads me to a kind of aesthetic and
literary synergy which points in a single
direction the multitude of experiences
that I owe to magical reality, to négritude,
to sun-kissed eroticism and to the creole
fantasizing of Haitians, which is the
surrealism of the humbled and the hurt. 
So you haven't entirely turned your
back on négritude? 
I've always mistrusted the idea of
négritude because I did not think it was
possible to constitute an anthropology
which is the exact opposite of the one
which devalued us and downgraded us
as "Blacks". You can't just transfer to a
Black context what is said and done in

### 189550: René Depestre: between utopia and reality
Who could promote this global public-
spiritedness? 
I see the bold imagination of poets and
writers at the forefront of the values
shared by the world's cultures. Our works,
each with its own strictly aesthetic
identity, should help scientists and
politicians to revamp our old ideas about
good and evil, to revive a sense of the
sacred which is being lost and to devise a
more balanced relationship between
North and South, and East and West. This
would be in a new world order where the
necessary rules of commerce, tempered
by a new sense of meaning and new
ideals, could express a fresh balance
between nature and history. To advance
further without risking disaster, the spirit
of the market should now be endowed
with certain ethical features, such as
meaning, laws of citizenship and an art of
living together based on mutual respect
and sympathy between the world's
peoples and societies.  

Karl Marx, German philosopher,

Arthur Rimbaud, 19th century French

Octavio Paz, Mexican writer, Nobel

Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (1816-
1882), French diplomat and author,
notably of “Essay on the Inequality of
the Human Races”
Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher
who in his preface to a 1948 anthology
of black poetry described négritude as
“anti-racist racism”
terms of Whites. Aimé Césaire referred to
this phenomenon as turning Gobineau
upside down. I realized we had to create
our own aesthetic and ideology without
falling into "anti-racist racism." That's why
I said goodbye to négritude at the same
time as I dropped Marxism. I've only stuck
with surrealism, which is still one of my
working tools. I use both ends of the tool
the scholarly and the popular. But I
mistrust surrealism too. Breton leaned
towards the occult, trying to link
surrealism with certain cabbalistic and
Talmudic traditions, a shadowy area in
the history of thought - but no less
interesting for that - which are the
equivalent of looking for the
philosopher's stone. I don't go along with
that at all. I've rejected the ideals of my
youth and today I work with the tragic
experiences which in my case they led to. 
How do you see the world these days? 
The idea of revolution has been buried
and history marches on, with its media-
fed procession of horrors and marvels.
The myth of a great consummation of the
body and the mind died of natural causes
in a big Soviet-style bed. The corpse is still
warm and already the spark of
totalitarianism has reappeared in the
shape of religious fundamentalism. All
kinds of ethno-nationalist savagery,
supposedly under the banner of a
campaign to renew faithless societies, are
building monuments to obscurantism,
terrorism and new banditry by the state.
On the borders of the West, the idea of a
fundamentalist utopia has taken the
place of a revolutionary one. 
How can literature inspire people to
embark on the adventure of a new
renaissance? 
The answer to that is shaped by a context
of fundamentalist horrors, interethnic
massacres and racist and nationalist
violence. It's one of a planet completely
ruled by market forces. Thanks to the
rational instruments of the rule of law and
democracy, the institution of the market
has survived all attacks on it. But most
people now think the democracy of the
market, its basis and the way it works,
needs to be overhauled. Or else life in
society is going to become a great
planet-wide casino. So it's in the interests
of the victorious marketplace to do
something about the chaotic and
aggressive conditions in which the
globalization of human affairs is taking
place. Bold steps should be taken to
make good use of the world's heritage of
democratic experience, the rich store of
rules of citizenship and the art of living
together which is to be found in Western
civil societies, the most developed and
experienced in terms of law, liberties,
justice and solidarity. We should be able
to turn the current haphazard process of
globalization into an unprecedented
Immunization of relations between
individuals and nation-states. The
international civil society which is
growing up amid disorder and
uncertainty needs the oxygen of world-
wide public-spiritedness and the idea of
solidarity that will be conducive to fair
distribution of the values and principles
which are now the shared property of the
global village.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
After a decade of encouraging
advances, progress towards the
Education for All goals could stall, or
even be thrown into reverse, as poverty
rises, economic growth slows and
pressure mounts on government
budgets. The 2010 Education for All
Global Monitoring Report argues that
urgent action must be taken to avert
that danger. Even before the global
economic crisis hit, many of the poorest
countries had already been under
pressure from sharp rises in
international food prices. The lethal
cocktail of high food prices and
economic recession has left a deep
imprint on the lives of millions of
vulnerable people. It has also worsened
the economic environment for
achieving the 2015 development
targets, including the Education for All
goals. 
Growing malnutrition and
deteriorating prospects for reducing
extreme poverty have far-reaching
consequences for education. Hunger
undermines cognitive development and
can lead to irreversible losses in
education achievement. According to
the Food and Agricultural Organization
of the United Nations, high food prices
left an additional 175 million people
malnourished in 2007 and 2008.
Increased malnutrition among pre-
school and primary school age children
has been reported from several
countries, including Guatemala. And
rising food prices have had
consequences for household spending
on education. In Bangladesh, for
example, about a third of poor
households in one survey reported
cutting spending on education to cope
with rising food prices.
By 2010, it is estimated that the
economic recession will have edged
another 90 million people into extreme
poverty. More poverty means parents
have less to spend on children’s
education and in some cases this can
push children out of school and into
employment.   For example, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo rising
unemployment in the copper mining
sector has reportedly forced households
to withdraw their children from school. 
Economic slowdown threatens
education financing
The importance of economic growth for
education financing is not widely
recognized. In sub-Saharan Africa,
government spending on primary
education rose by 29% from 2000 to
2005. These increases were instrumental
in the progress the region has made in
primary education. Around three-
quarters of the increase was directly
attributable to economic growth. 
Deteriorating economic prospects
may therefore hurt public education
spending, translating into fewer
classrooms built, fewer qualified
teachers recruited and more children
out of school.
What does the economic slowdown
mean for education financing in sub-
Saharan Africa, home to just under half
the planet’s out-of-school children?
Estimating levels of future government
revenue with economic growth
forecasts conducted before and after
the onset of the crisis provides an
insight into the impact of the crisis. One
scenario estimates a potential loss in
total education spending of $4.6 billion
per year in 2009 and 2010. While only an
estimate, these figures illustrate the
budget pressures that many countries
face as a result of the global slowdown. 
Rich countries have responded to
the financial crisis by investing  heavily
in programmes aimed at restoring
economic growth, protecting
vulnerable citizens and maintaining
vital social infrastructure. Education has
frequently been a priority: the American
Recovery and Reconstruction Act makes
available an estimated US$130 billion
for education-related expenditure.
Programmes of this kind have led to
rising levels of public debt in many rich
countries.

Education at Risk – 
the impact of the
financial crisis

While many of the world’s banks are showing healthy
signs of recovery after one of the biggest global
economic crises of the last century, the aftereffects are
still being felt in some of the world’s poorest countries.

### 189551: Education at risk: the impact of the financial crisis
In contrast, the space low-income
countries have had to respond to the
economic downturn has been much
more limited. In many of the world’s
poorest countries, tax revenue ratios are
likely to decline or remain stagnant, and
increasing government borrowing is
unlikely to be a viable option. For many
low-income African countries, that
means turning to international aid.  
The education finance gap
Even before the global downturn, recent
trends in aid for education were giving
rise for concern. Though here had been a
rise in aid to education during the first
half of the decade, overall commitments
to education have recently stagnated. In
2007, reported commitments stood at
US$12.1 billion, around the same level as
in 2004. Basic education remains an area
of particular concern. While aid
commitments rose sharply during the
first half of the decade, the period since
2004 has been marked by a standstill
punctuated by episodes of steep
decline. In real terms, the US$4.3 billion
reported in 2007 represented a cut of
22%, or about US$1.2 billion, from its
2006 level. The decline in commitments
to basic education was far greater than
that for education as a whole.
The financial crisis is putting aid
budgets under pressure. Some donor
countries, notably Ireland, have been hit
hard by the crisis and plans announced
in 2009 will see the aid budget cut by
22%, reversing a rapid expansion.
However, in others, such as the United
Kingdom, the United States and Japan,
commitments have been made to
maintain or increase levels of aid. 
The 2010 Global Monitoring Report
estimates that greater prioritization of
education in national budgets and
annual aid commitments of US$16
billion a year will be required to achieve
universal primary education, develop
early childhood education programmes
and act to reduce the number of adult
illiterates (a staggering 759 million
adults worldwide– or 16% of the global
adult population) by 2015 in the world’s
poor countries. Current aid to basic
education for forty-six low-income
countries – around US$2.7 billion – falls
short of what is required. 
While this price tag appears
considerable, it represents only a
fraction – about 2% – of the amount
mobilized to rescue just four major
banks in the United Kingdom and the
United States. Of course, governments
point out that securing the financial
assets and balance sheets of banks
represents an investment. But the same
is true of international aid for education,
which is an investment in poverty
reduction, shared prosperity and a more
equitable pattern of globalization.
As UNESCO’s Director-General, Irina
Bokova, states in the foreword to the
2010 Global Monitoring Report, “In
response to the financial crisis and its
aftermath, governments urgently need
to create mechanisms to protect the
poor and vulnerable. They must also
seize the opportunity to build societies
that combat inequality, so that all may
benefit and prosper. Education is at the
front line.” 

The day starts early at the primary
school in Aqualaar, a village in Kenya’s
arid northeast. By 5 a.m., when the
children arrive, their teacher, Ibrahim
Hussein, 18, is waiting by his blackboard
to give a lesson on arithmetic.
‘School’ in Aqualaar is a sandy patch
of ground under an acacia tree. Mr.
Hussein’s blackboard hangs from the
branches. There are no desks or chairs.
But around 30 children sit listening with
rapt attention, following the lesson by
scratching numbers with sticks in the
sand.
Classes start before dawn for a
reason. By 8 o’clock the children will
have started their day jobs. The boys will
be out herding goats and cattle with
their parents. The girls will be collecting
water with their mothers from a stream
10 kilometers away. But they’ll be back
at 5 p.m. for another two-hour class.
Welcome to the world of education
for ethnic Somali pastoralists in Garissa.
This is one of the most disadvantaged
areas in Kenya. Fewer than one in three
children make it through primary
school. And just 10 percent of Somali
girls finish their teenage years with
more than two years of education.
Lacking support from the
government, parents are taking matters
into their own hands. The villagers pay
Mr. Hussein, a high school graduate, a
small fee to teach their children. And
they make time for their kids to attend
his classes. For Khadija Ali, whose
daughter Fatima, 7, and son Hassan, 9,
attend the school, the choices are
straightforward: “Of course it’s hard. But
an education will give my children a
better life and chances that I never had.”
If only governments around the
world demonstrated the same resolve
and sense of urgency. Ten years ago, at a
global conference in Dakar, Senegal,
they pledged to make sure that by 2015
all of the world’s children were getting a
basic education. They are not delivering
on that promise.
Less than five years from that target
date, school registers tell their own
story. The world’s economy is

### 189552: We're breaking our promise to teach all the world's children
skills, but 72 million children of primary
school age are not in school. Millions
more drop out before finishing primary
school. And many who do finish school
lack basic literacy and numeracy skills –
a testimony to the poor education they
have received.
Of course, it’s not all bad news. Some
of the world’s poorest countries have
made extraordinary advances in
education. But as any school kid will tell
you, a promise is a promise – and the
promise of education for all will be
broken if we carry on as we are. New
figures released this week by UNESCO
show that, on current trends, 56 million
children will still be out of school in 2015.
Changing these trends should be at
the top of the international agenda.
Governments in developing countries
need to take the lead by putting in
place the policies and investments
needed to reach the most
disadvantaged children. 
Obstacles in the road
Too often, those with the most to gain
are the last in line when it comes to
public education. In urban slums from
Manila to Nairobi, the absence of decent
public schools means that some of the
world’s poorest families have to pay for
a private education that is often second-
rate – and many can’t pay. 
Disadvantages in education don’t
operate in isolation, of course. They are
linked to wider problems of poverty and
discrimination against girls and women.
In Pakistan, girls from poor rural
backgrounds average just two years in
school – less than one-third of the
national average. 
It’s not just governments in
developing countries that need to up
their performance grades. Donor
countries are failing to keep their promise
to the world’s school children. Ensuring
that all kids get a basic education will
require dedicating an extra $13 billion a
year from now to 2015. Yet after several
years of stagnation, aid commitments for
basic education were cut last year. 
Contrasts with health care are striking.
Global funds for AIDS and immunization
have served as a focal point for political
attention, attracting finance and increasing
the flow of aid to those who need it. 
The Fast Track Initiative, a global
framework operating under the
auspices of the World Bank, was meant
to play a similar role in education.
Instead it has overseen a low level of
financing and long bureaucratic delays,
with some countries waiting two or
three years for support.
Of course, there are many obstacles
to delivering on the promise of
education for all, including shortages of
schools and teachers, deeply ingrained
prejudices, discrimination against girls,
grinding poverty and inadequate
teaching. But such barriers can be
broken down — by fairer public
spending, targeted support for the most
disadvantaged, and policies that attract,
train and retain effective teachers.
Good schools are a potent weapon
in the fight against poverty, social
prejudice and extremism. They are an
investment in economic growth,
shared prosperity and security. It is
time for governments to put education
where it belongs: at the heart of the
national and international policy
agenda. 

“I was born with a pen in my hand,” he
says. “I don’t remember any specific
moment when I tried calligraphy for the
first time,” he adds. “There were a lot of
reeds growing in the neighbourhood
where I was born, the kind used to make
pens.” Ghani Alani started working at an
early age. “My first job was with the
railway company in Baghdad. I would
clean the coaches during the day, and
then go home and study in the evenings,”
he explains. “On Friday, the day of rest, I
spent my time studying and practising
calligraphy.”
“My teacher was called Hachem
Mohamed, better known as Baghdadi.
He was a pupil of one of the greatest
masters of calligraphy, whose lineage
goes right back to the Abbasid tradition,
twelve centuries ago. I was thirteen
when I first met him. For three years I
submerged myself in the study of
writing. Once I had finished the first
phase of study, the second seemed
easier. Forming one letter leads to
making two, and these two letters go on
to make a word, and then a sentence.”
But this master of calligraphy was not
happy just teaching him how to form the
letters with his pen; he also encouraged
him to see the link between man and
letter. “Calligraphy has something to do
with the soul,” he feels. The calligrapher’s
pen is an extension of his arm, of his
whole being. “My master never told me
how to trace my letters. Instead, he drew
my attention to the link between the
body and the letter. ‘Our hands,’ he said,
‘are different, and their size affects the
letters, so the letter is a reflection of the
man.’
“I learned this art from Hachem al
Baghdadi, just as he, in turn, had
inherited it from the founders of the

“In the beginning, there was Baghdad,” says Ghani Alani,
as he evokes the role his city has played in the history of
Arabic and Islamic calligraphy. It was the starting point
for the other styles and different schools. But he
recognises that the art of calligraphy has also developed
in other great capitals of the Arab-Islamic world, from
Andalusia to Bukhara.

Baghdad School. One day, he presented
me with a diploma, which none of his
other pupils had ever received. When a
calligraphy master gives a certificate like
this, he authorises his pupil to sign his
works with his own name. The diploma
becomes an ‘official’ paper, recognising
that the pupil has truly attained expert
status.” The document reads: “When it
became apparent that the recipient of
this magnificent certificate had
assimilated the rules of Arabic calligraphy,
had explored all the forms of this art and
had excelled at them, I awarded him the
right to affix his signature beneath his
beautiful writing …”
Ghani Alani left Baghdad for Paris in
1967. “In Paris, I followed postgraduate
studies in law and received a doctorate,”
he explained. “I wanted calligraphy to
remain a hobby, but my passion got the
better of me. The lawyer hung up his
robes and made a sharpened reed the
tool of his trade. When the Dean of the
Faculty of Law handed us our degree
certificates, he said: ‘today you are ready
to start studying law.’ What he meant was
that our studies had given us the means
to think. In the end, that is exactly what
Master Hachem al Baghdadi had told us
about calligraphy.”
“Once I had finished with Law, I went
to the Art Institute in Baghdad, following
the wishes of my teacher, Hachem al
Baghdadi,” he explains. “In my first year at
the Institute, a great Turkish master of
Islamic illumination, Hamad al Amidi, had
been invited. His teachings were very
important for me. Indeed, I now practice
both calligraphy and illumination, which
is unusual.”
“From the outset, I tried to grasp the
essence of writing in Arab civilisation.
Starting with my own experience, I
worked on the ideas of unity and
continuity that calligraphy is able to
express. It is rather like a river that the
other arts feed into, like tributaries.”
For Ghani Alani, calligraphy did not
develop in Arab civilization – as is often
thought – because pictorial representation
was forbidden. “This hypothesis is false,” he
insists. “There are drawings in Islamic
civilization, particularly in Turkey and Iran.
And calligraphy can incorporate figurative
images. The climax of calligraphy in Arab
civilization is more because it is a society
based on the word, and has been since
pre-Islamic times, when poetry was the
only art and the poet was the pride of his
clan. And where there is the word, there is
writing….”

Explaining the formal origins of
calligraphy, he says “the straight line and
the curve are found in every style of
writing in the world and always have
been, from pictograms to ideograms via
‘phonetic’ writing, which gave cuneiform
script its syllabic structure. Since the
invention of cuneiform, scripts have used
the straight line and the curve. There are
several illustrations in Mesopotamian
writing, like the inscription of the Codex
Hammurabi, where the characteristic of
the letters is their straightness, contrary
to what was usual at the time.”
Ghani Alani also gives us his opinion
on Kufic writing. “I have never thought of
Kufic script as being straight. Those who
call it straight are making a major
mistake, saying that all straight and
angular writing can be called Kufic. The
truth is quite different. This script can be
traced back to before the building of
Kufa, the town that gives it its name,
during the Mu’aalaqat era (the seven
most beautiful poems of the pre-Islamic
era are inscribed in the entrance to the
Kaaba, in Mecca). I, myself, prefer to
describe this script as angular. It is true
that the Kufi trend brought
improvements and led to it being used
more widely, both in manuscripts and in
“Arab civilization is based on the word”. L

President Nujoma, you are known as a
veteran freedom fighter in the struggle
of African nations for independence.
You are also a proponent of gender
equality and we would like to hear
your insights this subject.
Gender equality is a matter of urgency,
particularly in the developing countries.
In the past, women and men adhered to
specific gender roles, but now, with
modern day information technology, all
that has changed. Women are now doing
a lot of the jobs that only men used to do,
but much more still remains to be done.
We need more skilled men and woman in
order to fully reap the benefits of our
country’s natural resources. It is obvious
architecture. The School of Baghdad then
created cursive script, which takes
several forms, thuluth, diwani and naskhi
which was used for printing.”
Although Ghani Alani cites the
example of the Mu’allaqats, there are
doubts about the very existence of these
famous poems. “There will always be
someone who doubts the veracity of
these Mu’allaqats,” he explains. “But it is
certain that, since the pre-Islamic era,
there have been texts written using the
Arabic alphabet. Documents, treaties
and agreements have been found,
inscribed on stone tablets dating back to
well before the Islamic period. And, in
some archaeological sites, texts have
been found inscribed on stone, the most
famous being at Mada’in Saleh,” in Saudi
Arabia. (This site is inscribed on the
UNESCO World Heritage List.)
Ghani Alani has been living in Paris
for over 40 years. Speaking of his
relationship with the West, he confides
that “I live in Europe, and the exchange
that I have had with western society has
been very productive, in both
directions. And this, despite the
difference between Arab and Western
ways of thinking. Arab thought is based
on the verb, whereas Western thought is
based on the image. But the verb
includes the image. The best example of
this is poetry, which the ancients called
‘the register of the Arabs’.”
Receiving the UNESCO-Sharjah
prize for Arab culture means a great
deal to him. “Above all, it is a full
recognition of calligraphy as an art, one
which is part of the soul of Arab
civilization, and forms the skeleton of
this culture. But what is even more
important is that the prize has been
awarded to me as an Iraqi artist. This
enables me to show another side of
Iraq, unlike the images of war and
violence that have filled our screens.” 
Ghani Alani and  Polish publisher and
academic Anna Parzymies were the
laureates of the 2009 UNESCO-Sharjah
Prize for Arab Culture. The prize was
created in 1998 at the initiative of the
United Arab Emirates. Every year it
honours two people – one from an Arab
state, the other not – who have
contributed to the development and
promotion of Arab culture.

Gender Equality - 
A Development
Imperative
African elder statesman Sam Nujoma is revered as 
the man who led the Republic of Namibia to its
independence in 1990 and served as its President for 
15 years. His promotion of gender parity is a less well-
known aspect of his freedom fighting. In this interview,
he explains to Hans d’Orville and Clare Stark how he sees
the role of women in his country and internationally

that everybody must contribute in order
to ensure the eradication of poverty
What was the role of women in your
country’s liberation struggle?
Women played a key role in the
liberation struggle. We had battalions of
women, and they were often tougher
than the men. In order to promote the
economic development of the country,
we, in the South West Africa’s People’s
Organization (SWAPO) party, decided
that women should be represented by
50% in the SWAPO Party Congress. Our
Secretary-General is a woman,
Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana. She is also the
Minister of Justice.

### 189556: Gender equality: a development imperative
Is the same also true for the
Government of Namibia? Are you also
working to have 50% of women in
ministerial positions?
That is what we are planning, but we are
not there yet. Women make up 22% of
our national assembly at present. We
have to fulfill our obligation to both the
South African Development Community
(SADEC), our regional, economic
grouping, and to the African Union,
which have both stipulated that women
should make up 50% of the government
by 2015. 
Are you proposing that additional
funds be reserved in the national
budget for gender equality in order
to promote women’s participation?
I don’t think that there is a need to
enlarge the national budget to employ
women in the government, but I do
think that more funding is needed to
ensure that all children, both boys and
girls, in every district of the SWAPO
party are introduced to the computer so
that they will be better equipped to
succeed in this globalized world.   
Education is key to development. At
the time of independence, the quality of
education that you received was based
on the color of your skin and you ethnic
background, with of course the whites
receiving the best education. This
system was imposed by the apartheid
regime so we had to dismantle all of
that after independence. The current
Prime Minister, H.E. Nahas Angula, who
was then Minister of Education, Culture,
Youth and Sport in 1990 when Namibia
achieved independence, was
responsible for reforming the education
system in Namibia, and now, thanks to
him, we have a very good education
system in Namibia.  
Do you think that the development
projects taking place in Namibia now
are sufficiently reaching out to
women?
Women in Namibia are encouraged to
participate in all aspects of the country’s
development.  
How do you feel in terms of gender
equality in the multilateral system?
Are you satisfied, or do you think that
current trends should continue?
In the multilateral system, I would
venture to say that at least 85% of  all
UN specialized agencies should be led
by women, as they are more apt to be
able to address issues that focus on
promoting human-centered
development. 

UNESCO’s World Network of
Biosphere Reserves acquired 13 new
sites in June 2010. It now has 564 sites
in 109 countries.
Biosphere Reserves are areas
designated under UNESCO's Man and
the Biosphere (MAB) Programme to
serve as places to test different
approaches to integrated management
of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and
marine resources and biodiversity.
Biosphere Reserves are thus sites for
experimenting with and learning about
sustainable development.
