THE LODGING-
HOUSE KEEPER
To mark the 250th birthday anniversary of
Carlo Goldoni one of the greatest figures
in the Italian theatre Unesco last year
published a volume in its collection of trans¬
lations of Representative Works grouping
five of Goldoni's plays translated into French.
This prolific playwright produced a total of
2 1 2 of which some 40 all comedies are
still staged in Italy. Certain works by this
"'giant" of the theatre are still numbered
in the classical repertories of other coun¬
tries. Like all those who have shaken up
their field of art or letters, Goldoni is still
a controversial figure. He is both the best
known and least understood of comedy
playwrights in the Italian theatre. Some
people accuse him of having given the death
blow to the Commedla dell'Arte; others
(and they are far more numerous) praise
him for having restored it to life. La Lacan-
diera (The Lodging-House Keeper) is one
of his best comedies. It was produced last
year (in Italian) on the stage of the Théâtre
des Nations in Paris where the leading
companies of different countries present the
works of great authors, each in their own
language. The two scenes from La Locan-
diera shown here were photographed at the
Théâtre des Nations in Paris. (See page 28).

An 18th century Japanese classic, Ugetsu
Monogatari ("'Tales of the Rain and the
Moon") by Akinari Uedanow trans¬
lated into French under Unesco's pro¬
gramme of translations of Representative
Works has also become known outside
Japin through the cinema. In this scene
fion the film based on these stories the
Frin:ess Wakasa (a phantom) comes to
ensnare the humble potter Genjuro.
(See page I 8).
IS Symphony is a crass monster, a hideously writhing
wounded dragon, that refuses to expire, and though
bleeding in the Finale, furiously beats about with its
tail erect."
"All impartial musicians and music lovers were in perfect
agreement that never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic
and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing
dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny
ideas only increase the disagreeable deafening effect."
Readers of the Unesco Courier will undoubtedly be surprised
to learn that the above quotations show how leading critics of the
time received Beethoven's Second Symphony and his Overture to
Fidelio. Nicolas Slonimsky, the American conductor from whose
Lexicon of Musical Invective (1) the quotations are taken, states
in his preface that "objections levelled at every musical innovator
are all derived from the same psychological inhibition which may
be described as Non-Acceptance of the Unfamiliar... This
phenomenon is revealed in every instance where custom clashes
with an alien mode of living or a heterodoxal mode of thinking...
Foreign languages are barbarian, unpronounceable... Unfamiliar
customs offend. Gestures have widely divergent social con¬
notations in different lands. A Tibetan sticks out his tongue and
hisses when he greets a friend, but such salutation is an insult
to an Occidental."
Music is subject to the "Phenomenon of Non-Acceptance of
the Unfamiliar" even when, as in the above cases, the unfamiliar
is still part of one's own culture and tradition. How much more
so is this true when the listener is from a different culture.
Mr. Slonimsky, who did not have Asian source material available
in compiling his anthology, nevertheless has one quotation to
offer, a letter to a New York daily from a Japanese who attended
the New York première of Puccini's Madame Butterfly- in 1907:
"Western music is too complicated for a Japanese. Even Caruso's
celebrated singing does not appeal very much more than the
barking of a dog in faraway woods."
There is no doubt that a large section of the present-day
Japanese public would no longer react in this way to Western
music for the great music of the West is becoming increasingly
familiar to the Japanese, hence enjoyable. Unfortunately, there
is no doubt too that the greater part of the Western public would
still react ungraciously to the sound of Japanese music and
indeed to any Asian music.
The Unesco General Conference held in New Delhi last year
voted that three "Major Projects" be undertaken by the
Organization. One of the reports on the conference contains the
following statement: "It is probably not too much to say that
the project which has caught the imagination of all Member
States to the highest degree is the one on 'Mutual Appreciation
of Eastern and Western Cultural Values.' While this project
is still in its formative and exploratory stages, its potential as a
major factor for developing a new sense of community through
greater knowledge of and appreciation for each country's culture
and civilization was felt to be so important that this could be a
project of paramount importance to the whole world."
The new project is to be concerned not only with music, but
also with painting, sculpture, architecture, the dance, theatre,
philosophy, religion and literature. This activity is of course not
entirely new for Unesco which has been interested in furthering
mutual appreciation of the cultures of its Member States in many
of these fields ever since Unesco was founded. The '"Major
Project", however, will co-ordinate and intensify Unesco's activities
towards this end and attempt to turn them into an achievement
of "paramount importance to the whole world."
A number of future issues of the Unesco Courier will be
devoted to one or another of the aspects of this project in the
years ahead. The present issue, devoted to the Unesco
programme of translations of Representative Works, gives an
insight into some of Unesco's achievements so far in furthering
mutual appreciation of the literatures of East and West.

A Unesco Collection
GREAT LITERATURE
OF EAST AND WEST
by M. Arrbe
It is well known that if a man writes a bestseller, he
may make a fortune. It is true that the tax office
will probably take ninety-percent of that money
away from him, but what is left is still not to be looked
down on.
What everybody does not know is that if a novel does
not happen to turn into a bestseller, then not only may
the publisher not break even on his investment, but he
may often lose anything between one and ten thousand
dollars. Furthermore in countries like the United States,
England and France, many leading publishers lose money
on as much as fifty-percent of the books they put out
and sometimes more! The publication of novels by
young writers, for example, is a tremendous gamble.
For every one that becomes a bestseller there will be
several dozen that make a small profit or barely break
even, and a hundred that sell less than a thousand copies
meaning a loss.
The situation for other types of books varies. Technical
books usually have limited but well-defined specialized
markets, and their publishers suffer financial loss much
less frequently because such books can be priced higher
than fiction without discouraging would-be purchasers.
A book of poetry that achieves commercial success,
however, is rare indeed.
It should not be thought that commercial publishers
look at each manuscript purely from the money-making
point of view. Many publishers put out numerous books
simply because they believe in their contents and think
others should read them too. In some cases the publisher
is moved by enlightened self-interest to issue at a loss
not only one but as many as five or even more books by
a "promising young writer", who, he hopes, will in due
time attract public notice and become a commercial
success. In other cases a writer has such an obviously
unique contribution to make to literature or thought that
the publisher will issue his book "'for prestige", even
though he knows full well that there will not be enough
purchasers to cover the cost of publication.
The commercial publisher must obviously limit the
number of books he publishes at a loss and must con¬
tinuously seek for successes which will offset his losses.
If he didn't he wouldn't be able to stay in business.
It is no wonder, therefore, that publishers are cautious
in deciding to publish a work by an author who
is unknown to the public, and that they have
developed a complicated routine for sorting out the
books which they accept from those which they reject.
I have purposely avoided saying "sorting out the good
## [Page 5](https://demo.humlab.umu.se/courier/067562engo.pdf#page=5) 0

The Unesco Courier. June 1957
from the bad", because this selection process, stringent
though it is, is based on human judgments, and as
everyone with experience in the publication field knows
(and as the high percentage aï losses seems to prove),
such judgments are wrong almost as often as they are
right. It is the exception rather than the rule that a
book is published by the first publisher who reads the
manuscript, and there are dozens of cases of books
becoming bestsellers and reaching hundreds of thousands
of readers in all countries after the manuscript had been
refused by ten and even twenty publishers before the
persistent author (or his agent) finally got it accepted.
If this is the picture for manuscripts written in the
language of the publisher, then how much more difficult
must it be to get a book published when it is written
in a language which the publisher does not understand.
Let us examine the publisher's selection process in
detail. Let us consider what happens to a book by a
French author, published in France, which is submitted
to a publisher in England or the United States by the
author, his publisher or his literary agent, in the hope
that the work may one day be made available to the
English-speaking world.
The English publisher may be able to read French, but
he is a busy man. His firm may receive as many as a
thousand manuscripts a year, and publish perhaps
twenty-five. The French author's book then must first
go to a professional manuscript-reader, just as would the
manuscript of any English writer who still had to make
a name for himself. If the reader's report is not enthu¬
siastic, that ends the matter as far as that particular
publisher is concerned, and the author, after removing
the rejection slip, is free to submit his brain child to
another publisher.
What if the reader's report is favourable? There is still
a long road to climb. The book will almost inevitably be
submitted to a second reader, and if his report is also
favourable, in most cases to yet a third critic. If all three
reports give the book good marks, then it will be dis¬
cussed by the publisher's editorial board. Various other
factors are considered here. Is the subject matter in
line with that publisher's general policy (many publish¬
ers do have a very definite point of view, as examination
of their catalogues will reveal). Does the book contain
anything libellous or defamatory? Have any other works
on the book's subject matter been published during the
last twenty years, and if so, does this work really have
a new contribution to make? And many other questions.
Various specialists on the publisher's staff will be
consulted. How much will the book cost to produce?
What is the estimate of potential sales? Is it the sort
of book that libraries will want to buy? Are there any
factors that will make it possible to promote the book
easily, to obtain publicity for it without too large
expenditure? and so on.
Let us assume that all opinions are favourable. The
publisher then sends the author the happy news that
the book is accepted, and makes an offer aï terms. In
due time a contract is signed covering the rights, and
another contract is made with a translator. Some
months later the translation will be ready, and within
a year or eighteen months barring fires, floods, paper
shortages and other cases of force majeure the book
will be published.
We have been assuming that our English publisher
was able to read French, and that after the book
had obtained three excellent reports, he had him¬
self read it (or at least a few chapters, if he was as busy
as some publishers are). Let us suppose that he was not
able to read French and now, with the translation before
him, he really sees the book for the first time, and he
finds to his dismay that it is not at all what the three
favorable reports had led him to expect! It may seem
incredible that a manuscript that has gone through so
many trials and for which the publisher may have made
a sizeable payment of advance royalties, not to mention
the translator's fees may be rejected at this point.
Nevertheless dozens of publishers' projects are abandoned
each year under similar circumstances.
If so many obstacles stand in the way of publication
of a French work in English, then how much more
difficult is it for a book originally written in Urdu, Punjabi,
Thai, Korean, Arabic, Norwegian, or Portuguese-
How many publishers in England or the United States
(or France, or Germany, or any of the other big book-
publishing countries, for that matter) have three pro¬
fessional readers aï Punjabi to report on
manuscripts in this language? Or even one Cont'd
such reader? Obviously very few indeed. 0n

OF EAST AND WEST ^^
published throughout the world in 1954, 7,498 were from
English, 3,874 from Russian, 2,870 from Frenchand none
from Punjabi.
And yet, as is true of many of the languages of India,
and Indeed of many of the world's so-called "languages
of little diffusion", the Punjabi tongue has a literature
which can add enrichment to the world's common fund
of culture and thus merits translation into the more
widely-spoken languages (1).
Obviously, if the literary riches of the "languages of
little diffusion" are ever to be made known to the world
at large, then new channels must be found other than
the usual ones of commercial publication.
There is, of course, a certain type of publisher who
comes in where the commercial house fears to tread
publishing houses supported by organizations which will
risk putting out books that merit publication, but which,
according to the experts, will probably not sell enough
copies ,to cover the expenses of a
minimum printing.
Outstanding in this field are the
university presses and the govern¬
ment presses. Unesco, in its trans¬
lations' programme, acts, to some
extent, like an international univer¬
sity press.
One of the tasks of Unesco, within
the framework of the Organization's
larger aim of helping to make the cul¬
ture of its various Member States
better known in all other countries, is
to attempt to break through the
"translation curtain" which makes
the literature of so many countries
almost entirely unknown outside their
national boundaries.
As part of this undertaking, known
as the "Translation of Representative
Works Programme", Unesco is con¬
ducting a project for the translation
into English and French of books
originally written not only in Punjabi,'
but in many other "languages of little
diffusion" as well. This translations'
programme which was originally set
up as the result of a recommandation
made by the General Assembly of the
United Nations in December 1946, has
been part of Unesco's programme
since 1948. It covers not only trans¬
lations into English and French, but
also "counterpart programmes" o*
translations of .Western classics inU
certain Asian languages. At first the programme was
confined to translations from and into Arabic. Unesco
and the Lebanese Government agreed upon the establish¬
ment, at Beirut, of an "International Commission for the
Translation of Great Books", to assume direct responsa-
bllity for the translation of Arabic works into English and
French, and also of Western works into Arabic.
In later years succeeding General Conferences of
Unesco's Member States voted to extend the translations'
project to other languages. In 1949 a Latin-American
collection was set up; under this project Unesco is res¬
ponsible for the translation of works from Spanish and
Portuguese into French, and the Organization of American
States handles a parallel series of translations into English.
A year later the programme was enlarged to include
translations from the Italian and Persian, and also, under
an agreement with the University of Teheran, translations
into Persian from Western languages. Then, in 1952,
Unesco's General Conference decided to extend the field
so as to include works from the languages of Asia. Finally,
Unesco's General Conference, which met in New Delhi in
1956, approved the addition of a series of translations of
classics from the little known linguistic regions of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and another series of
anthologies of the written and oral literatures of Africa.
In carrying out the translations' programme, Unesco is
limited both by its budget and by the scarcity of competent
translators. Certain countries, however, particularly
desirous of aiding Unesco in» its task, help to defray the
cost of translating and publishing their literary master¬
pieces. Several learned Institutions, moreover, provide
Unesco with the assistance of distinguished specialists.
The works to be translated are not chosen arbitrarily;
the National Commission for Unesco, or some other
competent body in a country, is first asked to supply a list
of the works most representative of the national literature.
These lists are then examined and supplemented by a
committee of experts appointed by the International
Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies. This
same committee has the task of recommending qualified
translators and revisers each translation is revised, so as
to guarantee its absolute accuracy and literary quality.
So far, translations into English and French of works
from twenty-two different literatures have been published
or are in preparation. Translations into Arabic and
Persian have been published or are in preparation from
five Western tongues. In addition a single translation
(1) See on page 15, "Sacred Writings of a Warrior Race", an article on
the Adi Granth, the Psalms of the Sikhs, which Unesco is now having
translated from the Punjabi.
from the Arabic has been published" in Spanish. A com¬
plete list of the works translated so far in the "Unesco
Programme,"' or in preparation, will be found on page 22.
The programme described above is concerned exclusively
with books by writers no longer living. The 1952 General
Conference of Unesco's Member States voted that a
further programme be undertaken for making better
known the works of contemporary writers working in lan¬
guages that are little spoken outside of their national
areas. A programme was developed in co-operation
with the International P.E.N. Club, which had showed its
interest in this field by holding a symposium on "The
Literature of Peoples whose Language Restricts Wide Re¬
cognition" during the course of its XXVth International
Congress, held in Dublin in 1953. Each year the Inter¬
national P.E.N. Club calls upon its member clubs to
recommend works by contemporary authors that merit
international renown, and then submits brief synopses of
these works to Unesco, which makes the final choice.
So far the translation of seven works has been under¬
taken under this part of the Unesco translations pro¬
gramme one each from Dutch, Greek, Japanese, Nor¬
wegian and Persian into French, and one each from Ja¬
panese and Swedish into English. It is expected that one
work in Turkish and five in various Asian languages will
be chosen for translation during the next two years.

### 67595: Martin Fierro: an epic of the pampas
MARTIN FIERRO
-An epic of
the pampas
by Dominique Lacroix
Illustrations by Eleodoro E. Marenco. Painting, left,
is taken from Fausto by Estanislao del Campo, pub¬
lished by Editorial Peuser, Buenos Aires. Those
below are from Equitación Caucha by justo P. Saenz,
also published by Editorial Peuser, Buonos Aires.
For those who are unacquainted
with Argentina, or with Hernan¬
dez's poem Martin Fierro (1),
which has been published in French
by Unesco, the mark of the gaucho is
his lasso. But this is a mistake. The
inseparable companion of the Pampas
horseman is his guitar.
When Martin Fierro took his guitar
to sing of his misfortunes, everyone in
the campo understood him. In fact,
his forceful protests were so close to
life that, in seven years, 30,000 copies
of the book were bought by the hum¬
ble folk of Argentina. Yet forty years
went by before the educated élite of
the country decided to recognize Her¬
nandez as one of its greatest poets.
José Hernandez, born in 1834 at the
family estancia some miles from
Buenos Aires, led a gaucho's life from
his earliest youth. He learnt to ride,
to herd cattle, to drive back the raid¬
ing Indians. He rwore the broad-
brimmed hat, the fringed trousers and

the poncho, which is used as a blank¬
et at night. He was an expert with
the lasso, the bolas and the fighting
knife, as well as in the art of drawing
music from the guitar; he also became
a journalist whose pen was to be
reckoned with in the political
struggles that followed the fall of the
dictator, Juan Manuel Rosas in 1852.
During his period of exile resulting
from the defeat
of his party, he
decided to make
a public protest
against the hard
life that was then
the gauchos' lot.
And so he pub¬
lished the first
part of Martin
Fierro in 1872,
followed seven
years later by The
Return of Martin
Fierro.
For the first
time in the his¬
tory of Spanish-
speaking Ameri¬
ca, a poet was
taking up the de¬
fence of a class
which, already exploited, was threat¬
ened with extermination by the im¬
migration policy of the successors of
Rosas. Yet the gaucho had not
always been a social pariah. Before
and even during the Rosas dictator¬
ship, he was a free man, who spent
his life alone with his horse, in the
midst of his herds, and whose code
was a simple one: each man his own
defender.
When the enemies of the Dictator
came to power and put into effect
their programme of modernization,
including the development of agri¬
culture through immigration, at the
expense of stock-raising, this produced
a radical change in the status of the
gaucho. Too poor to buy land for
himself, he wandered from village to
village, and a law against vagrants
made him a perpetual delinquent.
The gaucho soon became the victim
of despotism: sheriffs, judges, officers
of the militia, all went out of their
way to persecute, rob and imprison
this incorrigible lover of freedom, or
else send him to the frontier.
Hernandez was the first writer to
denounce the scandal of these so-
called "frontier contingents". The
system was to
send all suspect
persons or those
whose affairs
were not proper¬
ly in order to
fight against the
Indians. These
wretched crea¬
tures went into
battle armed with
sticks and if they
ran away, they
naturally became
"deserters" and
were treated as
such.
José Hernandez
was determined
that the whole
question should at
least be brought
to light. He created the character of
Martin Fierro one of the payadores
who go from village to village, like
mediaeval troubadours, telling the
stories dear to the heart of the gau¬
cho. Martin Fierro tells the story of
his life simply and straight-forward-
ly. He begins by introducing himself
and goes on to evoke the happy life
that once was the gaucho's:
"Twas long ago that with wife and
[sons,
And cattle a goodly batch,
I rode my horse among the best;"
and then what followed:
"But into the army I
.[was pressed,
And when I came back,
[of all I owned,
There was only walls and
[thatch."

Life at the frontier meant blows,
hard labour, privation:
"...the Colonel sent us to work on
[his farms,"
"And the filthy state we soon were
[in,
Was horrible to see;
For pity's sake one's heart might
[break,"
Martin Fierro escaped and made his
way home, to find that his wife had
gone off with another man:
"And my wife alas! What good
[are tears;
She Is lost to me forever.
They said with some hawk she flew
[away,
That had hung round there for
[many a day;
No doubt she did it to get the bread
That I wasn't there to give her."
His children had had to take work
as peons:
"But how could they work? the
[featherless chicks,
Thrown out too soon from the nest,"
And as for his home:
"Only a few bare poles were left,
And the thatch and nothing more;"
Martin Fierro, who had "started
soft", then decided to be "as mad as
a mountain cat". Roving from village
to village, he drank too much one
evening and, at a dance, he killed a
Negro (this is what the gaucho calls
having an accident). A little later, a
gaucho provoked him with allusions
about his wife, and Martin Fierro had
a second "accident". That time he
was pursued by the police, who attack¬
ed him by night. There were ten of
them against him, and he put up such
a splendid fight that Sergeant Cruz,
one of the police, went over to his
side and helped him to get rid of his
attackers.
It is now the turn of Cruz to take
the guitar and tell the story of his
life an equally unhappy one. From
now on Cruz and Fierro are friends.
They decide to flee and join the
Indians as there is no longer a place
for them in their own country.
At this point the first book of
Martin Fierro comes to an end. The
second part, which Hernandez wrote
seven years later, shows the hero
returning from the desert and telling
of the Indians whom he now knows so
well. Here too, Hernandez is the
first Latin American author to describe
the Indians without false exoticism or
emotional bias.
After great suffering, the death of
Cruz from smallpox, and finally a ter¬
rific struggle to wrest a Christian
captive from the clutches of the
Indian who is torturing her, Martin
Fierro escapes with the unfortunate
woman and returns home where he

finds his own two sons and Cruz's son.
This time it is the three young men
who take up the guitar one after the
other and tell their story, whose
successive stages may be briefly sum¬
med up: poverty, injustice, oppression,
unhappy love, imprisonment and
finally the frontier contingent.
But in the café where they are thus
telling in song the story of their lives,
there is a Negro, who, in the tradition
of the country, challenges Martin
Fierro to a payada de contrapunto.
This is a kind of singing match in
which the adversaries seek to outwit
one another with riddles. At the end
of this match Martin Fierro gives in
to the superior skill of his opponent,
who then makes himself known as the
brother of the Negro killed many
years before at the dance. Martin
Fierro, with the wisdom of age and
bitter experience, refuses to fight him
and leaves with the three young men,
to whom he gives the following good
advice:
"If your friend's in need, be his
[friend in deed,
Never leave him in the lurch;
But don't ask him for what you lack,
Or load your troubles on his back."
"Even infidels will treat you well
If you give every man his due."
Filial affection, modesty, respect for
age, brotherly help, the forgiveness of
injuries, the abhorrence of crime and
of strong drink, and true love between
man and wife, are all dealt with in a
series of judicious statements, deliver¬
ed in simple sentences that have the
force of proverbs.
Then Martin Fierro concludes with
a plea for the gaucho, followed by
these moving lines:
"And if life fails me, this I know,
When the news of my death is
[spread,
The roaming gaucho, far away
In the desert lands, will be sad that
[day,
And a sudden ache in his heart will
[wake,
When he knows that I am dead.
For I've told in these songs of my
[brothers' wrongs,
Their pains and their misery."
He had spoken true; his "brother
gauchos" adopted Martin Fierro im¬
mediately and the book became their
Bible. The following list of goods
ordered by a village store-keeper is
typical: "12 gross matches, 1 barrel
beer, 12 copies Martin Fierro".
Epic, lyric, dramatic and satiric
elements, steeped in an atmosphere of
noble sadness, are constantly mingled
in Martin Fierro, and for the reader
of this poem, the gaucho, unconscious
victim of a civilization which, having
no use for him, drove him to despera¬
tion, is an unforgettable figure.

EPIC OF THE PAMPAS (Continued)
MASTER OF THE HORSE,
THE HERD, THE GUITAR
v.*
After the gaucho of yesterday, so stirringly described in Martin Fierro, here is the
gaucho of today, the paisano. An intrepid horseman, he continues to display his
mastery in taming wild horses and matching his strength against the young cattle
he herds. One of his favourite distractions is to sing the cielitos, the traditional
gaucho songs, accompanying himself on the guitar. Today the gaucho is not to the
same extent the "King of the Pampas" he was a century ago, but the part he has played
in putting Argentina to the forefront of Latin American nations has been recognized.

### 67608: The Wisdom of Al-Gahiz crosses the frontiers
THE WISDOM OF AL-GAHIZ
CROSSES THE FRONTIER
by Georges Fradier
Many an author has won fame in his own country and,
long after his death, his books continue to be admired
and to give pleasure but only to the relatively few
who happen to know the same language. To the rest of the
world he is unknown and will probably remain so.
And then suddenly comes a change. Someone decides to
translate him into a language understood by perhaps 50 or
100 million people. Our author, long dead, takes wings.
He finds a welcome among strangers. To them he brings
new treasure, something of the wit, wisdom and poetry of his
own folk and times.
This does not happen as often as might be imagined, but it
has now happened to a rare man of letters who died eleven
centuries ago. The name of Abu Uthman 'Amr Ibn Bahr
AI-Gahiz was unknown outside the Moslem world (except to
a few orientalists) until his Book of Misers was translated into
French by Charles Pellat and published in the Unesco Collec¬
tion of Representative Works.
Al-Gahiz was born in 776 or 777 A.D. at Basra, then a
flourishing city, traversed by countless canals, thronged with
merchants, singers and grammarians, the gateway to the East
Nature study
and theology,
poetry and
geography :
all was grist
to his mill
and a centre of Mesopotamian trade with India and China.
Its inhabitants were notorious for their sharp wit and difficult
character.
But Al-Gahiz seems to have inherited only their intellectual
capacities. Tactful and polite, he knew that a man of culture
deserves a quiet life, one that neither requires him to stake
his all upon reputation, nor makes excessive calls for self-
denial.
Though he was a contemporary of Charlemagne, his career
in the craft of letters was like that of any talented, ambitious
young man in 17th century Europe. Success meant living
in the capital and finding a patron there. For an author who
wished to live by his pen, there was no alternative but to offer
a few dedications in return for gifts and a pension.
Al-Gahiz, therefore, dedicated a book to the Caliph and
became a success in Baghdad. But his success owed nothing
to sycophancy. There are no fulsome praises in his book,
which is about the thorniest and most controversial problems
of those times, the political and religious system of the Cali-
12
phate. It does not take sides, but gives an unruffled account
of the most divergent trends of opinion.
All subjects came naturally to his pen : theology, natural
history, poetry, geography. Neither palace revolutions nor
revolts disturbed his output. The Vizir fell into disgrace, the
Caliph died. Their rivals and successors were equally
friendly to Al-Gahiz, who grew old wisely and only retired
from the Court when compelled to do so by a stroke and
rheumatism.
Al-Gahiz' Book of Beasts and Abu-Hanifa's Botany are
among the first works devoted to the study of nature. The
Book of Beasts contains many quotations from Aristotle,
though Greek influences are not otherwise particularly
conspicuous. There are also passages from the poets, used
as in all mediaeval treatises "to point a moral and adorn
a tale".
But our author has set down some observations of his own
as well. His object is to prove the unity of nature, to show
how, in the eyes of a sage, all things in nature are of equal
value. He had an odd predilection for insects and the Book
of Beasts foreshadows certain modern theories concerning the
evolution and adaptation of species.
Al-Gahiz, however, was not a scientist, nor a specialist in
any particular subject. He wrote books on Corn and the
Palm-tree, on Metals, on Whites and Negroes, though not
as one versed in the science of husbandry, or of metal, or of
mankind. His aim was to give a stimulus to such studies
and pleasure to the reader. Even when he wrote about
theology, elegance of style did not desert him : he eschewed
speculative theories in favour of historical fact and personal
experience.
The Book of Misers, for instance, is not an essay on
avarice, but a collection of anecdotes, recollections, apt quo¬
tations and original ideas, the whole apparently flung together
haphazardly. It is the obiter dicta of a sage with a smile
on his lips and a fluent pen, who has ceased to have much
faith in teaching, and refers to it only with a touch of
humour.
"In this book", he writes, "shalt thou find three things
original arguments, subtle artifices, amusing tales. Therein
mayst thou draw, according to the mood, matter for laughter
and distraction, if grave things weary thee."
And thereupon he laun¬
ches out he has always a
weakness for digressions
upon an enchanting
apology for mirth. But
he closes in dignified
fashion :
"Laughter and jesting have
their measure and golden
mean. That boundary
passed, we fall into frivo¬
lity; but short of it, then
we are found wanting
in the scales."

DISCOURS
DE LA MÉTHODE
b Jailli. uUi.t
Classical works In six different Western
languages have been translated or are
being prepared for translation Into Arabic
or Persian under Unesco's Translation of
Representative Works Programme. Here
are the covers (In French and Arabic) of
the Arabic translation of Discourse on
Method by Descartes. The other Western
classics chosen for translation from French
into Arabic are: Monadology by Leibniz; The
Spirit of Laws by Montesquieu ; Le Contrat
Social and The Origin of Inequality by Rous¬
seau ; An Introduction to the Study of Experi¬
mental Medicine by Claude Bernard ; The
Division of Labour ¡n Society by Durkheim;
Les Pensées by Pascal and The Future of
Science by Renan. English works are repre¬
sented by Shakespeare's A Winter's Tale and
Locke's Two treatises on Civil Government.
Works from other languages now being
translated are: Aristotle's Politics, Cervan--
tes' DonQu/xote and Dante's Inferno. To date
two classics have been translated Into Per¬
sian: Nletzche's The Will to Power and three
plays by Corneille. Two others are being
prepared : Locke's An Essay concerning Human
Understanding and selected plays by Racine.
The main pleasure in this book for us today lies in the
picture it paints of mice and men. Few are the historical
documents so close to life and the stuff of things. The Book
of Misers throws a dazzling light on Mesopotamian society
in the ninth century. It describes its customs, fashions, cul¬
ture, folklore, money troubles, police, trade, the funny stories
men told each other and what they ate in fact, the whole
tale of daily life, which is ignored by schoolroom history.
Our author did not think of depicting only misers in this
Wheat red as
the beaks of
nightingales ;
dates soft as
the throats
of lizards
work, and when he comes to them, he supplies us with an
essay on manners. And strange birds they are, his misers.
Their vice is usually kept for the dinner-table, like the one
who rationed his guests' helpings, but loaded them with gold
and jewels !
We have a glimpse of a brilliant civilization, though one
not far removed from the austere living of the nomadic
tribes who gave it birth, and still imbued with the poetry
wherewith the men of the desert transmuted their poverty
into gold. Listen to a Bedouin describing his meal :
"They brought us wheat red as nightingales' beaks, and
we kneaded bread, which we threw upon the fire ; the
embers tumbled out as the belly tumbles over the belt.
"We then made of it a pottage that went around in the
melted fat as the hyena goes around in the sandhills.
"Then they brought us dates like the throats of lizards, so
soft that the teeth sank into them."
Al-Gahiz had too much learning and too keen a sense of
humour to compose this prose poem himself, but he must
have felt happy as he copied it out. Through it we catch a
glimpse of one who was always good company, a man of
insatiable curiosity, not very deep, but always on the watch
for "wise saws and modern instances" wherewith to make his
meaning clear and help the mutual understanding of peoples.
The Book of Misers was one of a series of essays on
society, others include: Of Thieves, Of Young Lovers, Of
Schoolmasters, Of Singers. The essay on Women is
crammed with sex psychology and, in another series, our
author pleads for equality among the three races that then
made up the Moslem world the Arabs, the Persians and
the Turks.
All Basra mourned him when he died at the ripe old age
of 91. They mourned him as an admirable writer, but above
all, as a lovable man. It is a pity we have no portrait of him.
He was, it seems, extremely ugly, with big bulging eyes, and
that is the meaning of his nickname, Al-Gahiz. It is, too, the
reason why the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil felt unable to make
him tutor to his sons.
But we are reminded of Socrates ; his ugliness must have
been offset by his smile and his intelligence, and it must have
been forgotten in the enchantment of his speech. Maybe he
would not have stuffed his pupils with strategy and the Law
of the Koran. He would have taught them to cultivate an
open and inquisitive mind,
tolerance, a taste for
friendship, respect for
their mother tongue, the
whole seasoned with a
pinch of scepticism, for he
would certainly have im¬
parted all he had to give.
It would perhaps be
fantastical to see in him
an early Francis Bacon.
In any case the sons of the
Caliph are to be pitied for
what they missed.

### 67610: Sacred writings of a warrior race
by
Khushwant Singh
People have the habit of labelling everything these
days. When such labels are attached to races or
peoples, instead of being a convenient means of
identification, they often give a very one-sided and
inaccurate description.
One of the victims of this label habit are the Sikhs,
whq are known only as a martial race. People get a mild
surprise when they hear of an eminent Sikh scientist,
surgeon or engineer, or that the Sikhs have produced a
body of religious literature which is amongst the best in
India.
The world knows something of the Sanskrit classics
because it was ready to believe that the Hindus were cap¬
able of doing something in the realm of literature and
philosophy. But Sikh prowess on the field of battle pre¬
judiced all chances of their being taken seriously in the
field of learning.
This state of neglect continued until 1954 when Unesco
undertook to translate selections from the Sikh sacred
writings, the Granth, for the benefit of the English-
speaking world. The decision came as the culmination of
a long period of agitation and pressure on the Govern¬
ment of India by groups representing six million Sikhs.
Reading marathon : 5,000 verses in 48 hours
The compilation of the Granth was largely the work
of Arjun (1563-1606), the fifth of the ten Sikh Gurus
or Teacher-Prophets. He collected the writings of
the four preceding Gurus and the writings of Hindu and
Muslim Divines from all over India. A few additions were
made to the Granth by Arjun's successors and finally, the
tenth Guru, Govind (1666-1708) pronounced that after him
there would be no more Gurus, and that the Granth was
to be regarded as the living symbol of all ten Prophets.
Today the Granth is the object of worship in all Sikh
homes and temples. It is usually draped in richly em¬
broidered cloth and worshippers have to approach it
barefooted and with their heads covered. They make
obeisance by rubbing their foreheads on the ground
before it and place offerings of money, flowers or food on
the cloth draping it.
The Granth forms an integral part of Sikh life. Pas¬
sages from it are read every day and, on special occasions,
it is read non-stop from cover to cover by a relay of
worshippers. (It takes two days and nights to recite its
5,000 verses.) It is used in naming children, for baptisms,
for weddings and funerals. It is an essential part of the
Sikh creed which involves an affirmation of belief in the
ten Gurus and the Granth.
Oil lamps & incense for sky, stars & winds
Apart from the sanctity accorded to it by more than
six million people, there are other things which make
the Granth a very remarkable piece of work. It is
perhaps the only scripture in the world which could
be described as truly secular in the sense that it does not
propagate the tenets of any one creed. It contains the
writings of all religious groups in India at the time and of
all castes including the so-called "untouchable." It is in
the nature of an anthology of religious poetry representing
the blending of Hinduism and Islam. This makes it a
unique historical document as well. It has preserved the
writings of mediaeval saints, some of which describe events
of the time, such as conquests, social conditions and reli¬
gious controversies.
The Granth has also saved the traditional forms of
Indian music from corruption. Its 5,000 verses are set
The Unesco Courier. June 1957
to measure according to 31 ragas or modes of Indian
music, for all the hymns of the Granth are meant to be
sung and professional singers render them today as they
were rendered 300 years ago. Above all, it is the poetry
if the Granth which has aided its popularity amongst the
Sikhs and millions of others in Northern India.
Poetry loses much of its charm in translation parti¬
cularly the oriental where alliteration and onomatopoeia
are liberally employed to create a music by the jingling
of words. Besides, oriental symbolism is so different that
those not familiar with it rarely get the spontaneous
thrill which goes with its appreciation. A few samples,
however, may give a glimmer of the original.
Nanak (1469-1539) was not only the founder of the Sikh
religion, he was also a prolific versifier. Amongst popu¬
lar pieces of his is one composed in a Hindu temple
when a salver full of small oil lamps and incense (re¬
presenting the sky, stars and winds) was being waved in
front of an idol before it was laid to rest. He wrote:
"The firmament is Thy salver
The sun and moon Thy lamps,
The galaxy of stars
Are as pearls scattered.
The woods of sandal are Thine incense,
The forest Thy flowers,
But what worship is this
O Destroyer of Fear?"
Nanak's most celebrated composition is Japji now the
morning prayer of the Sikhs. In this he has also pro¬
pounded his philosophy and, in the last few verses, let
himself go in a frenzy of religious ecstasy:
"Were I given a hundred thousand tongues Instead of one,
And the hundred thousand multiplied twenty-fold,
A hundred thousand times would I say, and say again.
The Lord of all the world is one,
That is the path that leads,
These the steps that mount,
Ascend thus to the Lord's mansion
And with Him be joined in unison.
The sound of the songs of heaven thrills
The like of us who crawl, but desire to fly,
O Nanak, His grace alone it is that fulfils.
The rest mere prattle, and a lie.
Ye have no power to speak or in silence listen.
To grant or give away,
Ye have no power to live or die.
Ye have no power to acquire wealth and dominion,
To compel the mind to thought or reason,
To escape the world and fly.
He who hath the pride of power, let him try and see.
O Nanak, before the Lord there is no low or high degree."
Nanak was a staunch believer in the "middle path" and
severely criticized penance and seclusion practised by
ascetics:
"Religion lieth not in the patched coat the yogi wears,
Not in the staff he bears,
Nor in the ashes on his body.
Religion lieth not in rings in the ears,
Not in a shaven head,
Nor in the blowing of the conch shell.
If thou must the path of true religion see
Amongst the world's impurities, be of impurities free."
Guru Govind, who turned the Sikhs from a pacifist to a
militarist sect, composed verses in three languages, Pun¬
jabi, Sanskrit and Persian. His writings
form a separate collection by themselves.
His militant conception of God is revealed next
in these stirring lines in Sanskrit:

SACRED WRITINGS (Continued)
"Eternal God, Thou art our shield,
The dagger, knife, the sword we wield.
To us protector there is given
The timeless, deathless, Lord of Heaven,
To us all-steel's unvanquished might.
To us all-time's resistless flight,
But chiefly Thou, protector brave,
All-steel, wilt Thine own servant save."
The translation of the Granth is a truly monumental
task. The language In which it is written is mostly old
Punjabi which is not, readily understood. It is (not ar¬
ranged in chronological or alphabetical order, nor strictly
logical as a book propounding a thesis. The division, as
already explained, is according to the ragas of Indian
music. Moreover, in the old, authentic copies, all the
words in a line are strung together as 'beads in a rosary,
and, it is frequently difficult to tell whether there is one
word or two. There are consequently several interpreta¬
tions of each text. Several attempts have already been
made to translate the Granth, but' no one has hitherto
succeeded in combining accuracy with poetic excellence.
This is the task the Sikhs expect Unesco to accomplish
and the translation committee set up by the Indian Aca¬
demy of Letters, at the Organization's behest, includes
scholars of the highest repute who have agreed to work
without remuneration or recognition. The outstanding
figure in the translation committee is the 84-year-old poet
and Divine, Bhal Vir Singh, who lives a life of scholarly
seclusion in the foothills of the Himalayas. Working with
him are two well-known theologians, Jodh Singh and
Harkishan Singh, and a younger man, Dr. Trilochan Singh,
who has made a name for himself by his translations.
When the initial translation is completed it will be
submitted for English stylistic revision to the well-known
Scottish poet G.S. Fraser and to the author of the present
article. Its publication will make it possible for English-
speaking readers to know something of one of the master¬
pieces of the world's religious literature.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT
Anywhere else but in India, where present history is
boundlessly rich in the unexpected, it would be unbelievable
to imagine that the father of modern prose in the Tamil
language is... an 18th Century Italian priest.
Costanzo Giuseppe Beschi was born in 1680 near Mantua and
educated in Rome where his aptitude for languages and his
interest in India soon destined him for missionary work. He
became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1698 and, ten years
later, landed in Goa. There he learned Indian languages and
he was trained in his duties before being sent to the Madura
Mission.
The Madura Mission had been the subject of bitter debate in
the hierarchy of 'the Church for nearly a century, for Roberto de
Nobili, an Italian-born noble, a relative of two popes and a
nephew of a cardinal, had established this mission on rather
unorthodox lines. He claimed to be a Brahmin from Rome,
where Brahma the God of Creation had appeared to the Pope,
chief of the Roman Brahmins, to order the sending of
missionaries to work in the Tamil country and save the high caste
Brahmins. Two native Brahmins were won over by him, taught
him his Tamil and Hindu manners and presented him to the
Queen Regent of Madura. He was received as a Brahmin and
allowed to preach.
De Nobili took the Indian name of Tatwa Bodhaka Swamiyar
the Teacher who Teaches the Truth and darkened his skin.
Clad in robes of ochre, he wore sandalwood ash on his forehead
in true Hindu tradition and wound the sacred thread of the
Brahmins around his chest.
He was full of missionary
zeal and he spoke the Tamil
language fluently. Though he
converted hundreds of high-
caste Hindus to Christianity,
the Church protested against
his "going native1'. But he
persisted and Rome finally
recognized his orthodoxy. He
died in South India in 1648
at the age of 76, honoured
and revered as a saint.
Sixty years later, the newly-
arrived Beschi decided to
follow in his footsteps, In
Goa, he learned the Tamil
language and developed a
passion for it which was to
become overriding in his
later life. When he arrived
in Madura in 1714, he studied
further under a great teacher,
Supradipakkavirayar.
Beschi, too, determinedly
followed in the path of his
predecessor, but he was
never reprimanded. He was
respected greatly by the
Indians of Madura, both as
a spiritual leader and as a
man of the world. Beschi, at
one time, served as minister
to Chundah Saheb at Trichy the Chundah Saheb whom the
French had named Nawab of Arcot in their struggle against the
British for control of South India. Beschi had to flee Trichy in
1740 when the Maharattahs defeated Chundah Saheb, but he
enjoyed until his death a 12,000 rupee annual income from the
four villages given to him by this prince.
But his honours did not stop there. Chundah Saheb gave him
the name of a Moslem saint, Ismatti Sanyasi, and accorded him
all the privileges of a noble of his court. Beschi was even
presented with the ivory palanquin of Chundah Saheb's grand¬
father.
Beschi lived like a Hindu religious leader. Everyone respected
him as a Sanyasi of the higher caste, and few, if any, knew
him as a foreigner during his lifetime. His skill in languages
was phenomenal. In addition to Italian, his mother tongue, he
acquired Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish and French.
In India had learned Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Hindustani and
Persian, the last two being the court languages of Chundah Saheb,
Tamil and Telugu being the spoken languages of the land of
his missionary activity. In all of them he was equally at home,
fluent and scholarly.
Supradipakkavirayar, who taught Beschi the intricacies of Tamil
grammar, also gave him a love of literature and a mastery of the
written and the spoken tongues. Beschi's work in Tamil prose
and verse proves he knew Tamil forms of literature perfectly.
"In 1724", writes a modern historian of Tamil literature, "there

The Unesco Courier. June 1957
appeared Beschi's great work Thembavani, a work of considerable
merit in verse vying with the five epics of yore. It is in thirty
cantos, relating the inciuents historical and traditional connec¬
ted with the Old and New Testaments. In beauty of diction, in
sweep of imagination, and in intensity of religious faith, it is
usually compared with the Ramayana."
In honour of the Madonna, Beschi wrote three long poems
in traditional Tamil form which are listed even today in Tamil
literary histories as models of expression. A poem of the
Sorrowing Mother is in 100 stanzas and is also considered a great
poem of its kind. One other long poem in ballad folksong
metre celebrates "the martyrdom of the holy virgin Kitteri,
daughter of Sinayaken, King of Lusistan who suffered martyrdom
with her eight sisters on the mountain of Bomber in 130 A.D."
This is a poem of 1,100 couplets. It probably refers to Quin¬
tería or Citheia, a holy virgin and martyr of Portugal. (Martyrolo-
gium Romonum P. U0. Calendar 22 May).
Beschi's books on Tamil written and spoken grammar are
extremely useful and practical, for he cleared Tamil of many
redundancies and absurdities. I, as a practising writer of prose
in Tamil, find his grammar of the Tamil tongue useful even today.
It was Beschi who compiled the Chatur Akarathi the first
alphabetical lists in Tamil and paved the way for modern
lexicons. He was also responsible for a series of dictionaries
from Tamil into French, Latin and Portuguese and he is even
credited with an anthology of old Tamil verse which, unfortu¬
nately, has not survived. He translated two-thirds of a Tamil
classic, the Kural, into Latin.
Beschi's prose works are in
a class by themselves. Most
of his writings were necessa¬
rily on Christian doctrines to
inaoctrinate recent converts
with Christian principles or
sometimes to fight against
Lutheran missionaries. Ano¬
ther prose work of Beschi
deals with the science of as¬
tronomy with Christian appli¬
cations.
The Tamil language has a
verse tradition of nearly two
thousand years as is shown
by great epics such as the
Shilappadikaram which is to
be published in French in the
unesco Collection of Repre¬
sentative works. Yet Tamil
had scarcely any independent
prose tradition. Prose was
not known in the past except
to link two long poems or
often as commentary on
verse. Independent prose in
Tamil was used for the first
time by Costanzo Beschi in
his Paramartha Guru Katha
(the story of the Guru who
was a simpleton). This is a
. prose classic in the form of
a series of tales making fun of the Gurus or spiritual teachers of
India and their idiot disciples. It is all in good fun with no
offence meant to anyone, and the Tamils took to the book from
the very first. The stories of Beschi have gone into the folktales
of India and have even been translated into many other Indian
languages over the past 200 years. Subtle references to these
satires can be found in every turn of speech in Tamil even today.
Here is an episode from Beschi's tales. It tells of a Guru who
needs a needle. He tells his disciples to buy him a needle and
four of them go to the bazaar to buy it. All four want the
honour of carrying the needle to their revered master but the
needle is too small for four pairs of hands. So they stick
it into a long palm tree trunk and carry the trunk together to
their Guru. But when they place the trunk before the Guru
the needle is lost in the trunk and they are still looking for it.
Perhaps these were not original stories by Beschi but, with this
collection of tales, he initiated the tradition of Tamil prose,
and, as far as Tamil literature is concerned, that is his most
important contribution. Unesco is to make a new translation into
English of the Kural, one of the books which Father Beschi trans¬
lated into English in the early 18th century.
Beschi died in 1746 and was buried in a village where he had
been teaching Christianity to his flock. Like the Sanyasi of
Indian tradition, even his grave bore no name and, today, it
cannot be identified. But his contribution to Tamil literature is
still very much alive, and he needs no other monument or
memorial.

Eight hundred years before the Brontes, six centuries
before Mme de La Fayette, a lady of the Japanese
imperial court sat down with brush and writing
case and composed what is still considered the greatest
novel in her language. Lady Murasaki's Tale of Genji
is not only a classic for her countrymen; up until recently
it was one of the rare pieces of Japanese literature to have
been translated into Occidental tongues.
Unlike the Brontë sisters, Lady Murasaki felt no qualms
lest her work be treated condescendingly because of her
sex. Her own contemporaries included a number of
women authors, and the earliest known anthology of
Japanese writing the Manyoshu or Collection of Ten
Thousand Leaves is studded with poems by ladies of
noble birth.
Compiled long before most of the languages now
spoken in Europe had developed (about 750 A.D.), the
Manyoshu initiated a series of anthologies in which the
Japanese systematically tried to preserve what was finest
in their poetry. In the three hundred years between the
ninth and the twelfth centuries, eight such anthologies were
drawn up by imperial command.
But for many centuries to come the work of Japanese
writers was to remain virtually unknown outside Japan.
It was only a few years ago that a handful of Western
students, having mastered the difficulties of the language,
began to make translations of a few outstanding works.
Now two anthologies, compiled by Donald Keene for the
Unesco Collection, provide the first sampling of them in
English, and the most complete in any Occidental tongue.
The first of Mr. Keene's volumes covers the ancient and
classical periods; the second, the writing produced since
the Meiji Restoration in 1868.
The arrival of Commodore Perry's ships in 1853 had
been the signal for a new Japan to be born from the old.
When the Shogun once more allowed foreigners inside
the country, after more than two hundred years of

isolation, he had opened the door to
more than Western techniques. Not only
did the cities echo to the whir of facto¬
ries; the minds of men resonated to the
hum of new ideas imported, like the
steam engine, but far and away more
disconcerting.
The history of Japanese literature
since fhen has been largely one of reac¬
tion to these new ideas. First there was
imitation Japan had its would-be Shel¬
leys and its would-be Zolas too then
writers began to show more
originality as the new ideas
were assimilated and be¬
came liberating rather than
enslaving influences. The
result especially in fic¬
tion has been a true liter¬
ary renaissance.
In the firát of Mr. Keene's
two anthologies poetry holds
a major place. Whether
cast in the tight, demanding
verse forms of the haiku
and waka containing 17
and 31 syllables respectively
or in a larger, looser
mould, all these poems
reflect the Japanese love of
nature (a constant in the na¬
tional character) and most
have a melancholy tinge.
Human Life, their authors
never forgot, is just as frail
and uncertain as the cherry
blossoms that flower and
fade or the foam that
glistens and melts away. A
fatalistic and stoical religion
added to their resignation,
as did disasters like the pe¬
riodic earthquakes that
shake their islands, and the
spectacle of man's own per¬
versity in making war upon
his fellows, forgetting his
loved ones, or throwing his
long trusted counsellors into
disgrace.
But Japanese authors of
the classical period also
found expression in many other ways
than poetry. Story-tellers and chroni¬
clers, essayists and diarists, reflected
the history and manners of their times
while two distinctive forms of the drama
the Nô play and the puppet theatre
were developed to a high degree.
It was Japan's chief writer of puppet
plays, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, who
defined the basic aesthetic principle of
classical Japanese art. "Art is something
which lies in the slender margin between
20
the real and the unreal", he said. In
a society where the same exacting code
of behaviour had been followed for
centuries, where convention dictated the
slightest gesture, where etiquette forbade
the direct expression of feeling, art had
to suggest by symbol, metaphor and
understatement. But when the flood¬
gates from the outside world were open¬
ed, restraints were washed away.
Lady Murasaki had made an emper¬
or's son the hero of her masterpiece.
JAPAN'S LITERARY WORLD (Continued)
THE GATE OF HELL, one of the most striking Japanese films of recent
years, was based on a story by the famous writer Kikuchi Kan, one of whose
works is included in the Unesco Anthology, Modern Japanese Literature,
compiled and edited by Donald Keene. An earlier version of the same
story, Kesa and Morito, retold from the 13th century Uji Collection by
Akutagawa Ryunosuke, is included in the Anthology. Another story by
this author was brought to the screen in the Japanese film Rashomon.
Higuchi Ichiyo, Japan's principal woman
novelist of modern times, wrote about
children growing up in Tokyo's licensed
quarter. Her rowdy adolescents might
be taken as symbols of a whole popu¬
lation that was elbowing its way to the
forefront of the writer's attention.
These characters, drawn from all
classes, knew no reticence, and their
authors had deliberately dropped their
own. Instead of apologizing when they
mentioned their personal peculiarities,
they gave full vent to self-expression in
the "I novel".
It was a fast-changing society, where
old standards no longer applied and
thinking men and women were searching
anxiously for new ones. Some tried
to find them in one or the other of the
various philosophies or literary attitudes
current in Europe at the time. Others
turned to Christianity, which, introduced
into Japan three centuries before, was
going through a revival. Whatever the
direction, their search was
reflected in the new
frankness which their writ¬
ing revealed.
One of the most
revealing selections in
Mr. Keene's modern an¬
thology is an extract from
the diary of Ishikowa Ta-
kuboku, written in 1909.
Ishikawa was a would-be
novelist who had left his
wife and child in the pro¬
vinces and gone to Tokyo,
where he held a hack job as
a proof-reader but found
himself unable to write.
Haunted by a compulsion
to do something, but not
knowing what it is, he says
he feels as if he were "bat¬
tling against a stiff current",
and has never a moment of
calm.
"Then what am I seek¬
ing?" he asks himself.
"Fame? No, it's not that.
Achievement? No, not that
either. Love? No. Know¬
ledge? No. Then, money
perhaps? Yes, money. Not
as an end, but as a means.
What I am searching for
with all my heart is peace
of mind. Yes, that's it."
Fortunately, others were
able to conquer Ishikawa's
sort of literary paralysis and
get beyond themselves, rang¬
ing over the scene of contemporary Ja¬
pan and sometimes reinterpreting older
tales and legends with a new psychologi¬
cal insight. In the pages of the modern
anthology we meet some characters who
are lost survivors of an earlier daylike
the haiku poet and his sister the elocu¬
tion teacher in Na.jai Kafu's The River
Sumida but many more who are an
integral part of the world they live in.
There are soldiers, actors, thieves,
geishas and government officials,

misunderstood women and a husband
who has killed his wife and cannot
honestly tell the judge whether it was by
accident or design. There are sons
struggling to get free of their families
and young men setting out to study in
the West. There is a country school¬
teacher a most influential personage
and a war prisoner's wife supporting
herself and her little boy by peddling
black-market tea in Tokyo.
Three of the writers represented in
the anthology have been introduced to
audiences outside Japan through the
medium of the cinema. Among those
who recast old material in a modern and
very personal mould was Akutagawa
Ryunosuke, whose Rashomon was made
into a film a few years ago. Akuta-
THE CANNERY BOAT. A
dramatic film was made from
the story of the voyage of a
floating cannery in the waters
of Kamchatka written in 1929
by Kobayashi Takiji. Now
translated into English, it appears
in the Unesco anthology of
Modern Japanese Literature.
gawa also wrote his own version of the
tale of Lady Kesa and the soldier
Morito, from the thirteenth-century Uji
Collection, which in another version by
Kikuchi Kan recently formed the subject
of the even more popular film, The Gate
of Hell. Still more recently a film has
been made of Kobayashi Takiji's The
Cannery Boat, describing the grim life
of fishermen and sailors in a floating
cannery off Kamchatka.
This simultaneous interest in the past
and present seems to point toward a
more complete fusion of influences into
something newer still. "If one looks
back over the long series of changes
which make up its history", wrote
Masaharu Anesaki twenty years ago,
"one realizes that the soul of the Japa¬
nese people has remained about the
same, in spite of all its vicissitudes";
He foresaw the development of a new
"vital formula... when the new factors
have been absorbed by the deeper cur¬
rents of national life". The same point
of view is shared by Mr. Keene.
Meanwhile, the writings in his modern
anthology, as in the earlier one, stand
squarely on their own merits.

Drawings by the famous Bra¬
zilian author Gilberto Freyre
illustrate the remarkable va¬
riety of beard styles in vogue
in 19th century Brazil. From
Freyre's Sobrados e Mucambos,
published by Livraria José
Olympio, Rio de Janeiro ©.
CCO0 he died but not in humilia-
O tion or defeat. Before giving
up the ghost, he placed upon
his head a crown not an old hat or
a tub that might offer the spectators
tangible evidence of his madness. No,
indeed, Rubiao picked up a handful of
nothing and encircled his head with it;
he alone saw the imperial insignia,
heavy with gold, glittering with dia¬
monds and other precious stones. The
effort that he had made to raise him¬
self did not last long; his body fell
back again, but his face preserved its
look of radiant exultation. 'Take
care of my crown', he murmured."
The excerpt is from one of the
world's most fascinating novels on
insanity. The author: Joaquim Maria
Machado de Assis, Brazil's greatest
19th century novelist. The book:
Quincas Borba which, after attracting
wide critical acclaim when published
recently in England and the United
States, has now been issued in a
French translation in Unesco's series
of Latin American classics.
Philosopher or dog?
The theme of the book is the mad¬
ness of the hero, Rubiao. Ma¬
chado de Assis was himself an
epileptic and throughout his whole life
he was haunted by the fear of losing

coloured family and his mother died

FOR MADNESS?
and fiction were discouraging, and his
success as a novelist in later years
paralleled the increasing severity of
his disease. From 1892 onwards, as
his fits became more frequent, he
published his best novels: Epitaph of
a Small Winner, Quincas Borba, Dom
Cazmurro, Jacob and Esau. His cyni¬
cal humour became a defense against
sickness a sort of bitter philosophy
of life.
Machado's novel Quincas Borba
tells the story of Rubiao, a provincial
school-teacher who, almost by acci¬
dent, inherits a large fortune. Ru-
biao's benefactor is Quincas Borba,
the mad philosopher, who on dying
names Rubiao his sole heir upon
condition that the latter takes care of
Quincas's dog. Oddly enough, the
name of the dog is also Quincas
Borba, and hence the doubt as to
whether the philosopher or the dog
gives his name to the book.
Rubiao, then, suddenly becomes a
man of wealth. He leaves his native
village and settles in Rio de Janeiro.
Soon, of course, he is surrounded by
hangers-on and spongers of all kinds.
The episodes described, though purely
incidental, provide an interesting side¬
light on the life of the Brazilian
middle-classes at the end of the nine¬
teenth century.
The real story, however, is the
problem of the simple Rubiao, whom
Machado de Assis exhibits as a lover,
man of wealth, politician a pathetic,
egotistical clown bent on creating his
own comic downfall. His madness
stems chiefly from the doctrine which
Quincas Borba had bequeathed to
him before he died.
To the victor, potatoes
Quincas Borba (who identifies
himself with Saint Augustine)
explains his philosophy of "Hu¬
manity" as follows: "Humanity is the
principle. In all things there is a cer¬
tain hidden and identical substance, a
principle, unique, universal, eternal,
common, indivisible and indestruc¬
tible... Humanity... sums up the uni¬
verse, and the universe is man...
There is no death. The encounter of
two expansions, or the expansion of
two forms may determine the suppres¬
sion of one of them; but, actually,
there is no death; there is life, because
the suppression of one is conditional
upon the other's survival, and the des¬
truction does reach the universal and
common principle."
To explain his theory more fully to
Rubiao, Quincas illustrates it by the
story of a potato field and two
famished tribes. If the two tribes
were to divide the field of potatoes
peacefully, they would die of starva¬
tion, for there are not enough potatoes
for everybody; but if one of the tribes
exterminates the other, this suppres¬
sion is only partial destruction: "To
the vanquished, hatred or compassion;
to the victor, the potatoes." Hence
the preservative and beneficent nature
of war.
As soon as Rubiao understands the

significance of this doctrine, he makes
up his mind to become hard and ruth¬
less so as to fully enjoy the potatoes
life at last has offered him. He does
it in such a way that he dissipates all
his wealth within a few months and,
though the woman he loves receives
his attentions with indifference, he
finally triumphs over the frustration
of reality by donning the crown of
Louis Napoleon not in exile and
defeat, but rather as an emperor trium¬
phant and victorious over all his ene¬
mies. Forgotten is all the sad failure
of a futile and insignificant little life
in that supreme gesture of picking up
nothing and placing it on his head
to the accompaniment of the exultant
cry: "To the victor..."
Penniless and sick, Rubiao escapes
from the hospital where his friends
have taken him, and goes back to die
in his native village together with
Quincas Borba, the faithful dog the
old philosopher left him in his will
and in whom Rubiao comes to see a
reincarnation of the philosopher him¬
self. Three days after Rubiao's death,
the dog, which is unable to live with¬
out his adopted master and is pining
for him, is found dead in the street.
All one to the stars
In this bitterly ironic novel, peopled
with cynical politicians, grafting
officials, speculating financiers
and social parasites, the women stand
out as the most gracious characters.
There is beautiful, virtuous, though
weak-willed and superficial Sophia,
and the generous and noble Dona Fer¬
nanda, whom Machado de Assis prob¬
ably patterned after his own wife.
As for Rubiao, he finally finds hap¬
piness in madness and this is the
theme which Machado's genius deve¬
lops. In Machado's sardonic inter¬
pretation of life, ridicule and sympa¬
thetic understanding flow together.
Life, he says to us, is wholly un¬
concerned with man's suffering. "If
you have tears", he concludes, "weep
for these two not long dead. But if
you have only laughter, laugh. It is
all the same. The Southern Cross...
is too high in the heavens to be able to
distinguish between man's laughter
and tears."

These eighteenth century engravings depict scenes
from Goldoni's comedy La Locandiera (The Lodging-
House Keeper). Figuratively and in fact, Goldoni
"unmasked" the Commedia deii'Arte of his day. "A
mask cannot help but detract from the power of an
actor," he wrote, "whether he is being amorous, fierce
or amusing... it is always the same leather which is
seen ; and however much he may gesture or vary his
tone of voice, he will never reveal the passions which
grip his yery being." Goldoni painted life... not as a
philosopher, but as an artist, as a man of the theatre.

GOLDON
by François
Last summer, Venice was already making preparations
for a resounding celebration this year of the 250th
birthday anniversary of one of its most illustrious
sons, Carlo Goldoni, a great dramatist who has been called
the real founder of modern Italian comedy.
It decided, for example, that his spirit shall preside over
this year's Venice Art Biennale, and in many countries the
anniversary of Goldoni's birth will be the occasion for
turning the spotlight on his works which have known con¬
stant success ever since their author died in 1793. As a
preface to these celebrations, Unesco last year published
French translations of five of Goldoni's comedies.
He was a giant of the theatre, this Goldoni, who noted
in his Memoirswritten directly in French while he was
living in retirement at the Court of Louis XVI"I am
sometimes tempted to look on myself as a phenomenon.
I gave myself without a thought to the spirit of comedy
and was carried away; I ignored two or three perfect
opportunities to be something better, and always let myself
be snared in the same nets. Yet, I'm not sorry. I should
perhaps have found an easier life anywhere else, but I
should have had less satisfaction."
He was a child prodigy, and at eight years of age, he had
had, as he put it, "the temerity to sketch out a comedy".
The first books he read were works by authors of comedies.
This taste, already ingrained, was fed and encouraged by
his family. Goldoni's first playthings were the puppets in
the theatre which his father built for him and in which
he and his friends presented their own productions.
Operas and comedies were staged in his grandfather's
house. "All the best actors", Goldoni relates, "and all the
most celebrated musicians were his to command; people
came from near and far. I was born into this noise and
activity, amid this abundance; how could I reject the
plays; how could I fail to love the gaiety?"
Gaiety ! That, without doubt, was the overriding feature
of his works. Goldoni's brand of gaiety was particularly
unbridled, certainly far freer and easier than that of
Moliere to whom he has been compared. He was an
Italian, a son of Venice, famed for its gay and flashing
carnivals, and he was heir to the Commedia dell' Arte, the
mediaeval Italian comedy though its last faithful defend¬
ers attacked his plays. Thus, the gaiety in Goldoni's
works is both natural and traditional.
His quarrels with the supporters of the Commedia dell'
Arte began in Bologna where he was accused of breaking .
away from two centuries of Italian tradition. Goldoni
points out in his Memoirs the true origins of the principal
characters of this school of theatre inspired by the come¬
dies of Platus and Terence and created one after the other
in Venice, Bologna, Bergamo, Rome and in Tuscany.
There were four of them: Pantaloon, Harlequin, Brighella
and the Doctorthe famous masked characters of the
Italian comedy. They had been famous since the 15th
agrafes*?;
"Of all the comedies I have ever written, I would
go so far as to say that this is the one with the great¬
est moral lesson, the most useful and the most
instructive," wrote Carlo Goldoni, referring to La
Locandiera in his Memoirs. "And yet," he added,
speaking of Mirandolina, "I have never depicted a
woman so full of wiles or more dangerous than she."
His character, Mirandolina, runs a hotel in Florence

century and Goldoni wanted to suppress them. There was
a great outburst of indignation. But Goldoni explained
his reasons.
"A mask cannot help but detract from the power of an
actor whether in joy or sorrow; whether he is being amor¬
ous, fierce or amusing it is always the same leather which
is seen; and however much he may gesture or vary his
tone of voice, he will never reveal, through his features
which speak from the heart, the passions which grip his
very being. Today an actor is expected to reveal this
being, yet when hidden by a mask, it is like a fire smother¬
ed beneath the cinders."
Goldoni was the advocate of truth and new ideas when
he set about reforming the masked plays and "replacing
farces by comedies". Giving way from time to time to
those who attacked his reforms, he produced "skeleton"
plays in which the lines were improvised, but he devoted
himself to his main objective which was to create a comedy
of character in Italy. His obstinacy was rewarded for he
was later able to write: "After several years my taste
became that of the majority, the most widely followed in
Italy."
His efforts resulted in more than 120 comedies written in
Italian, in Venetian dialect and in French a language
he learned when he was about fifty as well as other
works: a total of 212 plays in which many characters
fishermen, lacemakers, courtiers, gondoliers, servants and
waiting maidswere taken from real life.
Before he came to Paris, where he taught Italian to the
royal princesses and wrote one of his best comedies, Le
Bourru Bienfaisant, Goldoni had lived in many Italian
cities: Rome, Perugia, Rimini, Chioggia, Pavia, Milan,
Verona and others. Everywhere he went he applied his
curiosity, observing closely and exploring the personalities
and characters of those around him and the circles in
which he moved. "Nothing interests me more than analys¬
ing the human heart", he once said.
He knew the doctor and the lawyer (he had once studied
and practised law himself), the great landowner and the
servant, the nobles (not always, it was said, given the
kindest of treatment in his plays) and the common people
whom he often made to speak in dialects. To all these
personages he restored the life which the masks had taken
from them.
He hewed out universal characters like the person of
jealous nature, the miser, the liar, the bumpkin and the
imposter. He also wrote satires on manners and morals,
some of which still retain their vigour, concerning the
education of girls, freedom of marriage, the status of
women and relations between married couples. Thus he
has bequeathed to us a true and vivid landscape of his
times and portraits of characters whose features we still
recognize today.
and has among her guests two suitors, a count and
a marquis. Fabrice, her servant, is also in love
with her. However, Mirandolina is much more

Ripafratta, because of the indifference he shows
towards her. First she does everything in her
power to attract Ripafratta but finally she sends her
noble suitors packing in order to marry Fabrice.

### 67622: The Cross and the sword, by Manuel de Jesús Galván
No one ever learns very much
about Santo Domingo in school
except, perhaps, that this big
West Indian island, colonized by
France and Spain, is today divided
into two independent countries, Haiti
and the Dominican Republic.
Few textbooks ever go to the trouble
of describing what happened on this
island during the first years of the
Spanish conquest. And yet, it is a
story worth telling. It has been told,
and remarkably well, by a 19th Cen¬
tury Dominican writer, Manuel de
Jesus Galvan, in his only novel, a book
which has become one of the classics
of Latin American literature.
The story of Enriquillo (its English
translation is entitled The Croßs and
the Sword) begins during the early
years of the Spanish conquest. Chris¬
topher Columbus had just discovered
the New World and, on his first
voyage, he landed on the island of
by
Rodney
Stewart
Hispaniola, an earthly paradise which
was inhabited by "benign, intelligent
and handsome people".
The Conquistadors lost little time
putting an end to this. Barely ten
years after the discovery of the island,
the Indians were reduced to slavery
and their leaders had perished by fire
and sword. Some diehards fled to the
mountains where they continued to
put up a fight with Spanish soldiers at
their heels. But most of the Indians
of whom Columbus wrote "there is no
better people in this world" degener¬
ated rapidly and "learned to live by
abject hypocrisy, lying, theft and
treachery."
The hero of Galvan's novel is Gua-
rocuya, a young cacique, the descen¬
dant and successor of the chieftains
of the Indian kingdom of Jaragua on
the western tip of the island. Saved
from massacre, he was befriended as
a child by two noble Spaniards, Cap¬
tain Don Diego Velasquez and a future
prelate, Don Bartolomé de Las Casas,
Facsimile of the jacket of the British edition of Galvan's masterpiece.
friend and protector of the Indians,
who became his godfather.
Guarocuya was brought up in the
Christian faith and baptized Enrique
(familiarly known as Enriquillo) . The
Franciscans at Vera Paz gave him
"the best education available in those
days" and he was also taught horse¬
manship and fencing. But though he
was educated as a young Spanish
gentleman, Enriquillo still had to
suffer the humiliation of seeing his
name inscribed on the list of serfs and
of watching his fellow Indians treated
as slaves.
A few years later, Enriquillo was
placed under the tutelage of good-
natured Don Francisco de Valenzuela,
a landowner in the region of San
Juan de la Maguana in the centre of
the island. Don Francisco believed in
treating Indians as human beings.
With Enriquillo, he went much
further he treated him as his own
son and trained him to run his estate.
But Don Francisco had a son,
Andres, a young playboy interested in
anything but work. Andres was jea¬
lous of Enriquillo and swore revenge,
but bided his time. Meanwhile,
Enriquillo was happy for the first time
in his life. He was engaged to marry
Mencia, daughter of a Spanish noble¬
man and an Indian princess, whom
he had known since childhood. His
future looked bright. He told the
Viceroy Don Diego Colon, Columbus's
son, "the work which my lord Don
Francisco de Valenzuela has given me
in La Maguana suits me so well that
I find it more like play than work."
When Don Francisco died, Enriquillo

and his young wife were at the mercy
of Andres and Mencia's kinsman,
Pedro de Mojica, as evil as he was
ugly (Galvan remained true to the
Spanish romantic convention that
ugliness of soul is always betrayed by
physical ugliness and beauty of soul
revealed by physical beauty).
First Andres and his accomplices
swindled Enriquillo out of his
inheritance and tried to take
away his wife. Then they began to
humiliate him. Enriquillo was deeply
religious, but hate got the better of
him: "Death is preferable to the
humiliation of the soul", he exclaim¬
ed even eternal death.
He sought justice but, under the
colonial juridical system, there was
no hope of remedy. His protectors
were far away Las
Casas in Cuba, and the
Viceroy entangled in
plots and intrigues. A
hunted man, Enriquillo
resorted to armed pro¬
test, establishing his
headquarters in the
Bahoruco mountains,
where a great number
of Indians gathered
under his command.
Galvan described how
the party set off for
the mountains:
"Vasa, one of Enri-
quillo's lesser caciques,
reined in his horse.
Gazing at the distant
summits of the Baho¬
ruco, he said solemnly:
"Yonder lies liberty.'
His companions echoed
his words... Enriquillo
said: "Yes, friends;
yonder lies liberty, yon¬
der lies a life fit for
men. How different
from the life that slaves
lead! Yonder lies the duty to fight
boldly in defence of that life and that
libertygifts for which, as good
Christians, we must give thanks to
the Lord God Almighty'."
A' first-rate strategist, Enriquillo
formed an army to fight the Spanish
troops sent to capture him. He won
one victory after another. And his
army steadily increased: "Victory had
given courage to the timid, and every
day fresh bands of serfs reached the
Bahoruco in search of liberty."
Against these rebels, the Spanish
dispatched a series of expeditions, but
Enriquillo could not be stopped. For
nearly fifteen years, he fought from
his mountain stronghold, determined
to accept no peace proposals short of
a guarantee of complete freedom for
his people.
In the end, he achieved his aim. In
1533, Charles V granted him the right
to choose a region where he could
settle with his vassals. His choice fell
upon a site at the foot of the Cibao
mountains, a short day's journey from
Santo Domingo.
"In that fertile region", Galvan
writes, "he founded a town which
still exists, under the name of Santa
Maria de Boya, a sacred place of re¬
fuge where the surviving natives of
Hispaniola could enjoy peace and
liberty." Enriquillo did not survive
his triumph very long, but "his name
lives and will live for ever... a great
lake perpetuates it among the lofty
mountains of the Bahoruco..."
This is the story of Enriquillo. But
around these events, Galvan has
woven a series of secondary episodes.
Max Henriquez Urena, in a foreword
to The Cross and the Sword, notes
that upon each of his characters he
succeeded in impressing an individual
stamp as vividly on the creatures of

one sense, the political career of its
author. The Spanish colonial regime
had ended in 1821 and Galvan's
childhood he was born in 1834
coincided with a period of Haitian
domination.
In his youth, he witnessed the
awakening of Santo Domingo as an
Independent nation. But his country
was at war with Haiti, a war which
seemed destined to drag on and on.
At the age of 25, Galvan became
the secretary of the President
of the Dominican Republic,
General Pedro Santana. To thwart
an invasion by Haiti, he supported the
re-annexation of the Dominican Re¬
public by Spain a state of affairs
which only lasted four years.
The historical parallel of The Cross
and the Sword is easy to follow. Just
as Enriquillo's Indians
in the Bahoruco moun¬
tains had no hope of
holding out indefinitely
and their only chance
lay in an appeal to the
Spanish crown, so in
1860, the only hope for
the people of Santo
Domingo of staving off
Haitian domination lay
in .calling on Queen
Isabella II of Spain.

Pedro de Mojica) as on historical
characters: Ovando, an energetic,
single-minded but inhuman governor;
Juan de Grijalva, a courageous soldier
and the unsuccessful suitor of beauti¬
ful Maria de Cuellar; Diego Colon, the
cautious Viceroy, or the priest Las
Casas, who led a bold crusade to save
the Indians.
The inclusion of novelettes within
the larger novel, Henriquez
Urena points out, is in the tra¬
dition of Don Quixote. Without
renouncing the privileges of fantasy,
Galvan remained true to his historical
material. Written in a pure, simple
style, The Cross and the Sword rep¬
resents eight years of solid work.
This novel was written to justify, in
The Cross and the
Sword is without a
doubt the best novel
produced by the "In-
dianist" movement in
Latin America at the
end of the 19th Cen¬
tury. In those Latin
American countries
where the Indian had
disappeared, he con¬
tinued to live on in
poetry and in literature
as a symbol of patriot-
Ism and freedom. But
though Galvan's novel
is pro-Indian, he plead¬
ed their cause in his own way.
He underlined Enriquillo's genero¬
sity and admitted the cruelty of cer¬
tain Spaniards. Yet he still made his
hero a sincere Catholic and his novel
ends happily thanks to the grace of
Charles V.
Galvan wrote only one novel, but it
was enough to place him in the front
rank of 19th century Latin Ameri¬
can writers. Although his book ap¬
peared in 1879, it^ has remained
almost unknown outside the Spanish-
speaking world.
It has now been published by the
Indiana University Press in the
United States in collaboration with the
Organization of American States and
Unesco as part of a Latin American
Classics Series. The English trans¬
lation, The Cross and the Sword, is the
work of the English novelist, Robert
Graves, author of I Claudius and
Claudius the God.

I.OOO SCIENTISTS TO ATTEND UNESCO TALKS
ON NEW RESEARCH USES OF RADIO-ISOTOPES
MORE than 1,000 scientists from all over the world are expected to attend or.
international conference on radio-isotopes in scientific research which has been
convened by UNESCO for September 9. Radio-isotopes substances containing the
atoms which give off radiations and which are now being produced in ever-increasing
quantities have many scientific and technical uses which have led to entirely new fields
of research. They are at present being used in biology, physiology, agriculture, medicine,
oceanography and industrial research.
Doctors have described them as the most important discovery since the invention of
the microscope. In healing, isotopes with strong rays attack disease. In research,
isotopes with weak, harmless rays are swallowed or injected and their rays trace hidden
changes in the body. Isotopes are also pointing the way, through agricultural research,
to bigger harvests. They are serving industry in dozens of ways, including the testing
and improving of products.
The UNESCO-convened conference will be strictly scientific in character, devoted to
the presentation and discussion of scientific papers dealing with original research, its
main purpose being the exposition and discussion of new ideas and methods for the use
of radio-isotopes in scientific research. One of UNESCO'S tasks is "to assist scientific
collaboration in connexion with the peaceful utilization of atomic energy by organizing
international conferences and seminars and exchanges of scientists working for the

Lighting the museum for evening
visitors, he explained, was a much
more economical answer to the heat
than air conditioning. Following his
mission, two-thirds of the objects
previously exhibited in the Karachi
Museum have been put into store-rooms
so that the remainder can be more
easily seen.
M. UBERCULOSIS DEATHS DROP:
Deaths from tuberculosis continue to show
a steady decrease in most European coun¬
tries for the period 1950 to 1955 according
to a recent World Health Organization
report. In Denmark, for example, the
death rate per 100,000 population dropped
from 13.8 in 1950 to 6.3 in 1955; in France
from 58.1 to 31.3; and in Portugal from
143.6 to 63.0. Despite the progress re¬
corded, the report pointed out that tubercu¬
losis remains one of the ten major causes
of death in Europe, and governments con¬
tinue to give TB control high priority in
health programmes.
CHINESE ART IN ISRAEL:
Unesco's Travelling Exhibit "2,000
Years of Chinese Art", was seen by
some 53,000 people in various parts of
Israel when it toured that country re¬
cently. The exhibit is made up of
reproductions illustrating the more
important stages in the development of
Chinese art over the past 2,000 years.
At a small rural settlement in the valley
of Jezreel, in the north, the drawings
and paintings were shown in a setting of
bronze sculptures and vessels, furniture
and other antiques drawn from the per¬
manent collection of Chinese art owned
by a local museum.
-CHIDING DESERT RESEARCH: Two
desert research institutes in Egypt and
Israel are to receive a total of $74,000
over two years under Unesco's major
project on scientific research for arid lands.
The institutes which will receive this aid
are: The Desert Research Institute at
Mataría, near Cairo, Egypt, and the Arid
Zone Research Institute at Beersheba,
Israel. Unesco's aid will be used to help
the Egyptian Institute in the form of
fellowships and equipment for technical
assistance which is already being given.
At the centre in Israel Unesco aid will
concentrate on solar energy, climatology
recording equipment and physiology. Main
target of Unesco's Arid Lands project is to
step up research in the vast dry belt from
North Africa to India.
BIG ATTACK ON MALARIA:
Four years and $20,000,000 will be
needed in order to eradicate malaria in
Mexico where the disease is now
costing the nation some $160,000,000 a
year. Malaria control has long been a
feature of Mexican health services, but
now an all-out assault has begun with
the aid of the World Health Organ¬
ization (Who) and the United Nations
Children's Fund (Unicef), to suppress
the disease completely. An army of
Unicef vehicles, ranging from jeeps to
heavy trucks, is to be used by more
than 200 teams of eight to ten men.
Armed with sprayers containing ddt
and dieldrin insecticides, also supplied
by Unicef, these teams plan to "ddt
clean" some 3,350,000 houses by 1960.
WtORKERS ABROAD: About 900
workers from 20 countries are this year
taking part in Unesco's study tour scheme
which aims to give workers in Europe a
chance to meet other men and women who
are earning their living in the same way
abroad. A typical study programme in¬
cludes observation visits to factories,
schools, co-operative establishments, hous¬
ing developments and workers' holiday
homes and also provides for personal
meetings, informal gatherings with families,
opera and concert going and visits to
museums and art galleries. Since the plan
began in 1952, 5,500 workers in 45
occupations have taken part. Travel costs
(this year about $40,000) are paid by
Unesco while the workers and their em¬
ployers or their hosts meet other expenses.
Folk songs of
Western Europe
FOLK songs of 14 Western European
countries, from Norway in the north
to Spain and Portugal in the south, have
been collected and published by the Ger¬
man Commission for Unesco under the title
Europäische Lieder in den Ursprachen.
Selected by a special committee under the
chairmanship of Professor Hans Mersmann,
the songs are published in their languages
of origin, including Catalan, Provencal and
Icelandic. A translation of each song in
German is included in an appendix to the
volume. In further editions of the songbook
these will be replaced by translations in
English and French. It is planned to
publish a second volume of folk songs, this
time from Eastern Europe. The present
volume, Europäische Lieder in den Urspra¬
chen, costs 4.80 D.M. and can be obtained
from Verlag Merseburger Berlin, Berlin-
Nikolassee, Postbach 25.

L etters to the Editor
Sir,
In reading The Unesco Courier of
October, 1956 (U.S. Nov.) I was
surprised to notice the interesting
article and photographs (even more
interesting) on "Asian Artists in
Crystal". Having been born in
Central Java (Indonesia) I should like
to point out that the word "Raden"
in "Raden Basoeki Abdullah" does
not mean "Prince", but is a kind of
title given to a Javanese nobleman
(somewhat like the title "Sir" in
England). But this is just a passing
remark; the article itself was
remarkably fine.
J. Hétharia
Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Sir,
The Unesco Courier is a wonder¬
ful journal, certainly living up to its
bannerhead. "A Window Open on
the World". Could we have some
articles on the activities and problems
of contemporary writers at various
points on this globe's surface?
Brian Bell
Panell Auckland, New Zealand
Sir,
It seems that the most difficult
lesson for the common man to learn
is international thinking. This diffi¬
culty comes from the fact that we
try to understand other people and
nations from our own point of view.
This is quite wrong. The first thing
we have to do is to learn to under¬
stand the spirit of other nations. The
foundation for this learning must be
geography, history and languages.
Nature is the mother of humanity
too, and geography is important
because it gives information about
Nature and the conditions from which
nations have developed. We are all
neighbours and it is very important
for us to know each other and the
background of our' development.
Unesco has done much good for
teaching international understanding
and The Unesco Courier is one of
the best publications for international
information. It brings first-class
articles in every field from all over
the world. This is just what the
world needs for in this way all
prejudices about other nations will be
removed. I should like to discuss
this with people all over the world and
would like to hear from them.
Borre Gronningsaeter
Validai, Norway
Sir,
Heartiest congratulations to the
editorial staff of the Unesco Courier
for the splendid issues they produce
(at such a reasonable price). Your
magazine is thus becoming an excellent
vehicle of international culture, of
understanding between different peo¬
ples and of regard for those values
which make for individual character¬
istics in each country. The recent
delivery of issues in envelopes was
a great improvement... I am of
Canadian origin and I pass on your
magazine to Canadian and French
friends in Rome. Thank you on their
behalf as well as my own.
Jean Bouchard, S.J.
Rome, Italy
Sir,
I must say that personally I am not
very keen on the magazine format
which you employ. A magazine
interests its readers above all by its
illustrations; those in The Unesco
Courier are, by the way, very good
in general; but in addition a magazine
deals with subjects of current interest
those with which readers have
already become familiar, usually
through newspapers. The aim of The
Unesco Courier, however, is to bring
the reader into contact with subjects
which are unknown to most people.
Because of this, I believe that a
clearly didactic formula is required.
However, I imagine this would be less
appreciated by the majority of readers
for whom a magazine represents a
means of '"killing time" while
enabling them to pick up facts which
they can show off to their friends and
thus give the impression of keeping
up to date with things although the
knowledge they acquire is, in fact,
unrelated and rudimentary.
Albert Beauchet
Thorigny, France
Sir,
The Unesco Courier appears to be
a magazine of rare qualities, the
questions it raises being very much
up to the moment and of interest
both to laymen and specialists. Those
who write for it are specialists which
is certainly an assurance of the
quality of their work.
Lydie Arianova
Plovdiv, Bulgaria
Sir,
I have just received your «May
number, and have read it with keen
interest, especially the article "Forty
Jumps through the Universe". I
hope you will be able to continue
your working for brotherhood be¬
tween the peoples of the world. Being
a teacher at a secondary school I am
very interested in articles devoted to
non-European peoples and their way
of life.
Asmund Vogth Eriksen
Vikersund, Norway
Sir,
We are happy to inform you that
we have formed a Club named
Unesco Penpals' Association. Our
aim is to foster friendly relations with
pen friends who wish to correspond
in English.
We need your guidance and advice
for the well-being of our Association.
Meanwhile, we have contacted the
Osaka Unesco Association of Japan,
which helps students to find suitable
pen friends in foreign countries.
We know that the common man
wants to live in peace and hates war.
Our progress becomes permanent
only if he (the common man) knows
his fellows, and if he cares for the
welfare of his neighbours. And
mutual correspondence is one of
the main sources in making one feel
the existence of love and affection.
We shall feel particularly happy if
you kindly extend your hands of help
to our endeavour towards world peace
through mutual correspondence.
Abul Ashraf Noor
Chairman, UCBPS
P.O. Ghoramara, Rajshahi,
East Pakistan
Sir,
I am enclosing my subscription to
The Unesco Courier and would like
at the same time to congratulate you
on your January 1957 ("Rare
Treasures of World Art") issue, which
was of a hitherto unequalled quality.
It was remarkable in every respect:
quality of texts, richness of illustrations
and an impeccable presentation. In
particular you manage to bring off
the feat of initiation to cultures and
civilizations which it is difficult for
the general public to approach, doing
so in a minimum of pages while yet
avoiding the pitfalls of the sketchy
and superficial. To evoke the spirit
of a period is a delicate undertaking.
You succeed magnificently.
Yves Cosson
Nantes, France
Sir,
Having reached the point in my
studies where I have now to prepare
a paper on a chosen subject to
complete my classical work, I have
been thinking of taking as a theme,
"Buddhism and its Civilization". I
decided this after reading a copy of
The Unesco Courier (Twenty-five
Centuries of Buddhist Art and
Culture": June 1956; U.S. Aug).
P. Grégoire
Hannut, Belgium
Sir,
I should like to say how interested
I am in the efforts of all those who
contribute to The Unesco Courier.
However, I feel that the articles are
sometimes too short. But you are
trying to reach a vast audience and
you often lack the space to develop
your subjects at greater length. Your
photographs are often quite re¬
markable.

H<i
fl ecause it is often difficult to send money from country to
country for the purchase of books, films, laboratory equipment,
etc., Unesco has created a sort of international currency, the
unesco coupon. The coupons enable schools, universities,
teachers aïid students in many parts of the world to buy freely
the materials which they need to carry out study and research.
UNESCO COUPONS can be used to buy: Books, periodicals,
photocopies, microfilm copies, art reproductions, charts, globes,
maps, sheet music, gramophone records, and also :
the following categories of educational films: a) screening prints
and duplicate prints, b) original negatives and duplicate negatives,
as well as, c) 16mm. raw film for printing the above categories of
films; various categories of scientific material for education and
research, such as: optical instruments, balances and weights, labo¬
ratory glass-ware, electrical measuring instruments, analytical and
clinical testing apparatus and similar types of equipment.
UNESCO COUPONS are on sale in most Member States which
have currency restrictions. If you do not know where to obtain
coupons, please consult your National Commission for Unesco or
write to Unesco, Paris, for the information.
The travel coupon scheme, which is designed to overcome the
currency barriers to educational and cultural travel, is an extension
of the Unesco Coupon Scheme described above. Travel Coupons
are a form of international travellers' cheque. They provide the
foreign exchange needed to enable travellers such as students,
teachers and research workers to go abroad for study or research.
For full details, please refer to the following explanatory leaflets:

(containing the addresses of the national agencies responsible for
the allocation and issue of coupons).
This second leaflet also gives a list of banks where unesco travel
coupons may be cashed. It may be obtained from ihe:

DON QUIXOTE
Translated in Arabic
Filmed in Russian
One way in which Unesco has been able to further mutual
appreciation of the literatures of East and West has been
through its programme for the translation of Representative
Works. This programme, which began in 1948 with trans¬
lations from and into Arabic, has breached barriers which
make the literature of so many countries almost unknown
outside their national boundaries. Some works translated in
many languages are still unknown in large parts of the world.
Aiming to fill one of these gaps in world translations,
Unesco's programme includes the translation of certain
Western classics into Persian and Arabic. One such work,
Cervantes' Don Quixote, is now being put into Arabic. The
"Knight of the Melancholy Countenance" recently appeared
in a new Russian film at this year's Film Festival in Cannes.
Here are some scenes in which Don Quixote ¡and Sancho
Panza are played by Nikolai Tcherkassov and Lori Toloubeiev.
