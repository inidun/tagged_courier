The scientific exploration of our acoustic
environmentthe "soundscape"has
recently begun. Noise and sound are
indeed as much a part of our lives as
shapes and colours, although our modern
world of sound is very different from
that of our ancestors. The "World
Soundscape Project" set up and directed
by the Canadian composer R. Murray
Schäfer is today studying the innumerable
sounds in our acoustic environment
(see page 4). Here, child with a sea

EXPLORING
THE NEW
SOUNDSCAPE
Pioneer research into the global
acoustic environment
by R. Murray Schäfer
R. MURRAY SCHÄFER, internationally known Canadian composer, is founder and
director of the World Soundscape Project in Vancouver. Until 1975 he was professor
of Communication Studies at Simon Fraser University, British Columbia (Canada).
A complete treatment of the subject of this anide is presented in his book The Tuning
of the World, a study dealing with all aspects of the world soundscape which will be
published shortly by Alfred A. Knopf In New York and McLelland and Stewart in
Toronto, Canada.
OST Europeans and North
Americans still believe
that the eye is the most important
receiver of information. I have heard
psychologists say that as much as
80 per cent of our vital information
comes through this receiver. Very
few people stop to consider that this
may not have been true in the past,
or that it may not be true in the future,
and that it may not even be true for
much of the world's population at
present.
We are coming to believe that
dependence on the. eye as the
gatherer and orderer of environmen¬
tal information is directly related to
literacy and is therefore a habit that
has been learned by Westerners as
far back as late Greek civilization, but
that as the West begins to enter its
post-literate phase, the ear will return
as a primary sensing instrument, just
as it still is in many parts of the world.
The fact that the Western World has
a noise pollution problem today and
that increasing numbers of people
are aware of it is one clear sign that
we have reached this change-point.

### 49592: Exploring the new soundscape: pioneer research into the global acoustic environment
Technological civilization has
brought sweeping changes
to our acoustic environment
the "soundscape". Today the
"harmonies of nature" are
seldom heard except in places
far from the hubbub of modern
life: leaves rustle and water laps
beneath the paddle (opposite
page) as a boat glides over the
tranquil waters of a canal in
Kerala (India). But in most
cases "background noise" now
tends to be an all-pervasive
cacophonous din. The roar of
jet engines inflicts intense strain
on the nerves and eardrums of
people living near large airports
(photo left).
The ears are crying out for greater
respect. We can recognize what
they are telling us or we can give up
and resign ourselves to inevitable
deafness as the hurricane of noise
increases.
Soundscape is the term we use to
describe the acoustic environment.
You will not find it in any dictionary.
We have derived it from landscape
but its properties are different. Consi¬
der the number of people who have
helped to define the meaning of land¬
scape for us: geologists have studied
its structures, geographers its surface
formations, painters and poets have
described it, gardeners and engineers
have shaped it, architects and plan¬
ners have embellished it. As for the
soundscape, who has studied that?
It is a discipline we must now learn,
or rather relearn.
It is to this end that, a few years
ago, we set up the World Soundscape
Project. Perhaps the best I can do in
this short article is to describe some
of the approaches of our work and
hope that they will suggest fresh or
related studies elsewhere in the world.
To effectively know about the sound¬
scape we must consider the past as
well as the present in order to make
intelligent recommendations for the
future. How can we do this? We
can tape record and analyse sound-
scapes of the present and we can talk
to people who inhabit them to find
out what they think. Still we can't
delve into history with our micro¬
phones and our analytical equipment.
Here history becomes geography.
We can, for instance, study wilder¬
ness environments . in northern
Canada or the deserts of Australia.
Or we can get some impression of the
past acoustic environments of a com¬
plicated continent such as Europe by
selecting and comparing remote
villages in different countries.
The first thing we notice when
we study a wilderness soundscape or
even a rural or village soundscape is
that it is quieter than that of the
modern city. Yet this is not because
of the absence of life there. Rather
it seems that whatever sounds that
are present are subject to cycles of
activity and rest. The sound pro
ducers seem to know when to speak
up and when to shut up.
Different species of insects, animals
and birds complement each other in
daily and seasonal rhythms of syn¬
chronized beauty. For instance,
during the months of June in British
Columbia, frogs will leave off chirping
at precisely the moment when birds
begin their dawn chorus and will only
return as the last bird is fading at
sunset. Geese will be heard only
a few days each year in Ontario as
they streak north in May and return in
huge honking flocks on their way
south in October.
Such environments, uncluttered
by an overpopulation of competing
sounds we call hi-fi. That is to say,
the signal-to-noise ratio is favourable.
Every sound is newsworthy. Each is
made for a purpose and is comple¬
mentary to the others, like a good
conversation or a good orchestration
in music.
One learns to read such signs for
vital clues about the environment, i
For instance, on my farm we know f

HORSE-POWER
WITHOUT THE HORSE
In a square of Ulan Bator, capital of Mongolia (above) a horse left
fettered by its rider gives vent to its indignation with an outburst
of bucking and neighing. Such a scene is uncommon in cities
today, where the neighing of horses and clop-clop of their hooves
have been replaced by the din of motor traffic: horse-power without
the horse. From the start of the Industrial Revolution
in the 19th century workers in the metal industries had to put up
with a bedlam of noise (see engraving below) and in spite
of preventive measures taken in recent decades, deafness from
excessive noise can still be an occupational hazard.
Engraving from Das Buch der Erfindungen. Gewerbe und Industrien
(Discovery of Tools and Industries). Berlin 1874
,the ground has thawed in spring and
is ready for ploughing when, lying in
bed at night, we can hear animals
burrowing beneath the surface.
The same is true of village life.
When we studied the mountain village
of Cembra in Northern Italy we found
that life centred on^ annual and sea¬
sonal cycles of festivals and special
events, each with its prominent acou¬
stic soundmark.
Church bells were rung in different
ways on different occasions, small
cannons or mortaretti were fired on
fixed days; there were certain days
when the goatherd's horn conducted
the sheep to summer pasture; there
were special days for folk songs and
special horns that were blown when
youths and girls were courting.
The whole village was enfolded in
periodic sound cycles that only began
to disintegrate when a new road
brought mountain buses up to
connect the village with the cities in
the valley below.
The transition from rural to urban
life can be characterized generally as
a passage from the hi-fi to the lo-fi
soundscape. A lo-fi soundscape is
one in which trivial or conflicting
acoustic information masks the sounds
we want or need to hear. For a
sound to catch one's attention at
all it must be monstrously loud or
insistent. Radios, the birdsong of
modern life, do not go south in winter;
bulldozers do not hibernate and traffic
does not sleep at night. . Everything
operates simultaneously with much
wasted acoustic energy and attendant
destruction of nerves and eardrums.
The study of the natural sound¬
scape suggests not only that the
total volume of sound needs to be
reduced in order that diminutive or
message-bearing sounds can again
be clearly heard, but it also gives us
the clue as to how this might be
achieved by the restoration of clearer
rhythmic patterning.
Curfews on jet flights at night is
one possibility, but this needs to
be augmented in other ways, for
instance by restrictions on construc¬
tion equipment or loudspeakers in
public places. Where they are a
nuisance, a neighbourhood might
even consider restricting the opera¬
tion of power lawnmowers to one or,
two evenings a week.
Another difference between the
urban and rural environment is that
in the urban environment most sounds
are close by while in the natural en¬
vironment many are distant. The
urban soundscape possesses pre¬
sence while the natural soundscape
possesses both presence and an

CITY TUMULT
AND FOREST MURMURS
Like natural and man-made shapes such as the palm tree and the city
of Dakar, in Senegal (above), sounds have their own architecture,
also modulated spontaneously by nature or drawn from the myriad
noises of human origin. Today research teams are analysing and
measuring the volume of the innumerable noises forming
the "soundscape" in many parts of the world, under a project
directed by the Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer.
Diagram below pictures the cycle of the sounds of nature
on Canada's Pacific coast.

acoustic horizon. Then news of in¬
vasion into the area is picked up by
the ear. A. dog on a distant farm
signals the arrival of a strange animal
or a visitor to the neighbourhood.
Dependence on the ear was espe¬
cially strong in the early days in North
America as Fenimore Cooper's novels
show. Danger was then signalled
by the snapping of a twig. In a deep
forest vision is useless; one sees at
best a few metres in any direction.
The ear is alert like that of an animal.
Curiously, the same dependence on
the ear is evident in the treeless
deserts of Australia today, where an
aborigine can, by pressing his ear
to the ground, pick up footsteps as
distant vibrations. A car, for ins¬
tance, can be heard 20 kilometres
away, first as a ground vibration.
Sometimes hearing at a distance is
vital to the survival of a community.
In the Breton fishing village of Les-
conil we conducted a study which
illustrates this clearly. A daily on¬
shore-offshore wind cycle carries a
complete circumference of distant
sounds to the village, some as far
away as 12 kilometres. Bells from
distant villages are heard, sounds
from inland fields, buoys in different
locations at sea, each appears at its
aopointed time. Any change in the
accustomed pattern indicates a
change in the weather, a matter
which each fisherman and fisher¬
man's wife picks up immediately i
with practiced ear. I

y Acoustic space is not visual or
physical space. It cannot be owned
or delimited on a map. It is shared
space, a mutual possession from
which all inhabitants receive vital
signals. It can easily be destroyed
by thoughtless soundmaking or im¬
perialistic noises.
The modern world shows us many
examples of mismanaged acoustic
space. For instance, without expan¬
ding its physical premises an airport
may require more and more acoustic
space to accommodate increased
flights or newer and noisier aircraft.
A citizen may then discover that he
is sharing his bedroom or his garden
with the international aviation in¬
dustry and yet he will get little relief
in modern law, which defines pro¬
perty exclusively as a visual holding.
As we move into an acoustic era
such attitudes will change and even¬
tually they must be expressed in new
legal conceptions also. Sound im¬
perialism will then be considered as
much an offence as breaking and
entering.
Another way to learn about the
changing soundscape is through ear-
witness accounts of people who have
described the sounds of their own
time and place; and so we have been
compiling a large catalogue of such
descriptions from writers of all peri¬
ods and nationalities with the hope
that it will enable us to discover more
about soundscape morphology and
also will tell us something about the
changing attitudes of listeners over
the centuries. ,': , .
We have cross-indexed this cata¬
logue by time, place and the sound
objects described, and an accompany¬
ing computer programme enables us
to make statistical comparisons
concerning the appearance. and dis¬
appearance of the different sounds
in our index. It will be a long time
before we have enough references to
make reliable deductions for all parts
of the world, but we do have a large
sampling of sounds from European
and American sources and we can
draw some interesting conclusions
from them.
For instance, we note that of all
sound quotes from 19th century
European literature 43 % referred to
natural sounds, while during the
20th century mentions of natural
sounds had slipped to 20 %. Inter¬
estingly enough this decline is not
observed in North America, where
just over 50 % of all quotes for both
centuries refer to natural sounds! One
might assume that North Americans
are still closer to the natural envi¬
ronment, or at least that they have
easier access to it than Europeans,
for whom it definitely seems to be
disappearing.
We notice a decline also in the
number of times quiet and silence
are evoked in earwitness descriptions.
Of all descriptions in our file for the
decades 1810-1830, 19% mention
quiet or silence; by 1870-1890 men¬
tions had dropped to 14% and by
1940-1 960 to 9%.
In going through the catalogue
I am struck by the negative way in
which silence is described by modern
writers. Here are some of the modi¬
fiers employed by the most recent
generation: solemn, oppressive,
deathlike, numb, weird, awful,
gloomy, brooding, eternal, painful,
lonely, heavy, despairing, stark, sus-
penseful, aching, alarming...
The quiet and silence evoked by
these worlds is rarely positive. It is
not the quiet of a contemplative walk
in the countryside, it is not the quiet
one observes when listening to music,
it is not the silence of fascination or
meditation, or even the silence of
sleep.
Does this mean that such qualities
are going to disappear from our planet
forever, or does it mean rather that
our attitude towards them needs to
be revalued ?
The loudest and most continuous
sounds in the world today are those
of modern technology. It is these
sounds which are destroying our hear¬
ing, disrupting the natural rhythms
of our lives and pulverising the word
tranquility in every language. If we
are to recover elegance and balance
in the soundscape, it is machinery,
that will have to be brought under
control first.
This is not a matter of passing the
responsibility over to acoustical
engineers, whose livelihood, after all,
is dependent on a perpetuation and
even an augmentation of the problem.
It is rather a matter of larger groups
of citizens everywhere beginning to
study all aspects of the soundscape,
beginning to assess and criticize it,
and ultimately beginning to think of
ways to render it more beautiful.
I have often likened the soundscape
to a huge musical composition that
is unfolding around us ceaselessly.
The question is: how can we improve
its orchestration? The analogy of
the acoustic environment to music
may seem strange to some but I have
a special reason for suggesting it.
In music .sounds matter; the
musician doesn't fumble with them or
throw them about aimlessly. The
object of music is to achieve balance
and harmony; the enemy of music is
waste energy, noise. It is important.
I feel, to keep the model of music in
mind as we begin to design the world
soundscape, for it reminds us that our
task will be one of uniting science
and art in the service of society.
Redesign the acousticenvironments
of the world? What an arrogant
and preposterous idea this will seem
to some. All I can say is that it is
already being done, though often
thoughtlessly or by people whose
motives are unaesthetic and anti¬
social.
Purveyors of background music are
creating sound walls which nobody
asked for in the interests of inducing
workers to produce more or consu¬
mers to spend more. Generators for
producing white noise (a background
sound that is a blend of audible fre¬
quencies over a wide range) are now
being installed in modern office build¬
ings in North America in order to
prevent office workers from talking so
that they can type more letters for
their bureaucratic bosses.
In Sweden the ringing of tele¬
phones, nicely paced at ten-second
intervals, was sharply sped up to five-
second intervals in 1975 in order to
.. force people to answer their receivers
more promptly. For a telephone
company the less time a line is tied up,
the more money that can be saved.
Thus, for the saving of a few crowns a
whole nation is going to be made
more jumpy.'
Examples of bad acoustic design
could be multiplied endlessly. We
can only improve them when we be¬
gin to consider other motives than
profit and power in the .shaping of
sonic artifacts, when we learn how
to control loud or irritating sounds,
when we learn how to reclaim quiet
groves and times in our lives, when
we learn that there is a time to make
every sound and a time not to.

ROCK...POP...
AND RISING DECIBELS

and Desmond Mark
Young lovers of yesteryear (see medieval engraving below)
could meet in gardens orchestrated by birdsong and water
fountains. Today's Romeo and Juliet (above) must try
to whisper sweet nothings against the babel of the modern city.
TRY to imagine yourselves in the
quiet countryside somewhere,
making your way towards a town.
In order to get a better idea of the
changes in your acoustic environment,
you close your eyes, and put your ears
to work more sensitively. If we regu¬
larly put our aural impressions down
on paper at specific points in this
sound-walk, then we shall have pro¬
duced a kind of acoustic map which
would ultimately allow us to recog¬
nize by its typical features many
individual parts of the globe.
Naturally enough, it is a much more
difficult business to prepare a map of
a soundscape than a geographical
map, even more so since the methods
and terminology are only in the first
stages of development. Sonography
and geography are still a very long
way apart. The Canadian composer
and music educator R. Murray Schäfer
has become particularly fascinated by
this problem, and in the "World
Soundscape Project" which he con¬
ceived, he is setting out to research the
multifaceted links which exist between
Man, the sound environment, and
music itself. (See article page 4)
How would the map of our sound¬
scape look? In the rural, unurbanized
world of sound, noises present them¬
selves mainly one at a time, springing

SOUND AND SUPERSOUND
Fascinated American audience listening through ear tubes to phonograph playing popular
tune's in the 1880s (below) is a far cry from mass events such as the Woodstock
rock music festival in 1969 (far right) attended by 300,000 young spectators in Bethel,
New York. The breakthrough in electro-acoustical devices has made mastery
of the technology as important as mastery of the musical -instrument (right).
Fears that mechanization of music might induce a passive musical attitude in young people
are not borne out by a recent study on urbanization, modernity and musical behaviour
of Indian youth by Dr. Manas Raychaudhuri, of Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta.
"The transistor radio", he reports, "has stimulated an active interest in traditional
and non-traditional music among young people in rural and semi-urban areas of India."
^ picked up, and tell their own clear
story to the countryman. From the
low tinkle of cow-bells, he can tell
where his cattle are, for example.
Birdsong, the rush of a brook, human
voicesall these aural events can be
told apart, clear one from another,
and free of distortions and background
noise.
The nearer we come to the town,
the heavier becomes the noise of
cars, trains, aeroplanes, construction
machinery, and so on, overlaying the
natural world of sound until it is
completely drowned out by the noise
of machines and traffic.
In this industrial sound-world single
acoustical signals are buried in a
broad and deep bed of background
noise; in order to make an individual
signal capable of being picked out, it
must be enormously amplifiedand
that also includes human forms of
communication, such as speech and
music.
If we examine the development of
this industrial sound-world in historical
terms, we arrive at much the same
conclusion as we did following our
earlier sound-walk. For many thou¬
sands of years our ancestors lived as
hunters and" foragers in the context
of an acoustic landscape overwhelm¬
ingly composed of the sounds of
the natural environment, with human
sounds reduced to a very minor ele¬
ment, and the noise of tools and man-
made instruments very rarely falling
on the ear.
It was only in the industrial epoch,
which began in Europe during the
first half of the 19th century, that the
soundscape underwent a radical
alteration. Today we live in industrial
centres producing a tidal wave of
noise unthinkable in earlier times,
and whose power steadily exceeds
the power of the human organism to
withstand it.
The human ear is a highly sensi¬
tive instrument, able to measure
sound intensities ranging from the
smallest perceptible physical intensity
to an intensity a million times greater.
The measurement of the strength of
sounds, however, is calculated accord¬
ing to the logarithmic decibels scale.
Each addition of 10 decibels (dB) in
intensity denotes about a doubling of
subjectively received sound. Bet¬
ween the auditory threshold and the
roar of a jet engine, which can cause
actual physical pain, lies a range of
some 120-1 30 decibels.

The increasing noise of the environ¬

on men and their music. In the
industrialized world people have
become quite used to the fact that as
one's age increases, the inevitable
consequence is a growing loss of
hearing. But studies carried out in
the area inhabited by the Mabaan
tribe in Sudan have turned up the
surprising fact that the tribe, living in
a peaceful acoustic environment, has
almost'no experience of hearing-loss
connected with increasing age.
A comparative study carried out
with the inhabitants of a Western in¬
dustrial country showed that the
hearing capacity of an 80-year-old
Central African was still as great as
that of an 18-year-old New Yorker.
The obvious conclusion is that any
natural hearing-loss in the aged is
radically modified by environmen¬
tal factors.
Even more dramatic is the effect of
the new sound-world on the countries
of the developing world, where the
transition to the age of technology
and its accompanying acoustic inferno
is not reached in a steady, step-by-
step, upward climb, but in one abrupt
burst.
the effects of this tidal wave of
noise can also be severely increased
by the climatic conditions; in areas
where the ambient heat makes it ne¬
cessary, and part of the local custom,
to keep doors and windows open for
most of the yearsuch as the cities of
India, which have provided the basis for
a report on the problemthe level of
noise inside the dwelling can be as
great as the level outside.
In the industrialized world, at least
it is not only the noise of machinery
which is omnipresent; music can also
be made available on a mass scale,
thanks to the existence of loudspeak¬
ers. One can hardly imagine a situa¬
tion in which loudspeaker music is not
readily available: in supermarkets,
aeroplanes, restaurants, cinemas,
banks and in the homewe can hear
music everywhere.
This again is quite unknown to
previous generations in human history.
While before, music and speech were
inextricably MnkeÖ to the physical
source of the sound, whether instru¬
ment or speaker, today any desirable
sounds can be separated from their
source by electro-acoustical means,
and reproduced on records or tapes, to
be put out with the aid of loudspeak
ers at any time and in any place.
The significance of electro-acousti¬
cal techniques, in fact, goes much
further than a simple reproduction
and instant availability of music; it
also allows a range of ways in which
original live music can be altered
in terms of intensity, sound-tone,
acoustic characteristics and so on.
It is in no way surprising that the
attitude to music shown by young
peopleparticularly open to change
and innovationhas been deeply
affected by the new sound-world
around them, or that they have
become very accustomed to the idea
of music linked with technology.
With the breakthrough in" electro-
acoustical devices (loudspeakers, am¬
plifiers, mixers, and so on), the music
of young people is a completely new
approach. The use of technological
machinery has now been integrated
into the making of music, and the
mastery of the technology is now as
important as the mastery of the musi¬
cal instrument for performers. Never
before in the entire history of music
has the average musical performance
been so dependent on technical .
means as it is now. f

, The most striking technical mani¬
pulation of music for young people
lies in the area of musical dynamics:
amplification. The level of amplifi¬
cation to be experienced in pop or
beat concerts, in discothèque or beat
cellars is one of the most character¬
istic signs of the changed acoustic-
musical environment. Some exact
measurements have been taken in a
number of countries of this particular
relationship of youth to music, one in
particular from Switzerland.
During a pop concert in Lausanne
a technician checked the amplifica¬
tion in various parts of the concert
hall, and later described the possible
consequences of the level of sound
received by the audience: "Measure¬
ments with the sonometer taken
during the Mahavishnu Orchestra
concert showed sound levels of
125 dB at a distance of three metres ¡
from the loudspeakers, 110 dB in
the back stalls, and 118 dB in the >
front row of the balcony. It is per¬
fectly possible that 100-200 people-
that is, some 10 per cent of the total
audiencewould have sustained irre¬
versible damage to their eardrums;
in other words, nerve-endings would
have been destroyed that cannot be
regenerated."
For all that, there is no point in
wringing one's hands over the entry
of electro-acoustic devices into the
development of music and the exper¬
ience of young people, or indeed
as is often the caseshutting one's
ears to. any discussion of such "deplor¬
able" phenomena. To identify youth
with noise is hardly helpful to an
understanding of the many-sided
problems of where man and music
stand in the acoustical environment
of today; this is an area in which it
seems particularly easy to confuse
cause and effect.
One must look deeper into this spe¬
cific acoustical relationship, in the
context of the general environment,
in order to arrive at an understanding
and so make it more possible for
alternative measures to be taken
successfully. Musicians, teachers,
technicians and sociologists have all
arrived at explanations for the strik¬
ingly high sound-levels of music for
young peopleeach of them in some
ORCHESTRA OF BUZZERS AND HOWLERS
As early as 1913 the Italian futurist painter Luigi Russolo (1885-1947) had
the revolutionary idea of using the everyday noises of the industrial age to
create a truly modern form of music. Above, Russolo with some of the
"buzzers and howlers" he invented to represent the sounds of industry,
technology and urban life. Russolo compositions, bearing such titles as
"Awakening of a Capital" and "Meeting of Automobiles and Airplanes", were
produced on these devices and presented to Italian audiences in 1914. In the
early 1920s "noise instruments" imitating sounds from industry were also
constructed in the U.S.S.R. and used to perform "noise symphonies" and
"operas". About the same time experimental symphonies of factory whistles
were held in several Soviet cities, partly due to the efforts of the great
Russian poet Mayakovsky.
way linked with the modern human
environment.
The first argument is that the
phenomenon stems from an inten¬
tional break with the adult world.
Young people demand their own
areas of freedom, and achieve them
in this sensethrough the erection of
a "sound barrier". This acoustic wall
protects their area of autonomy from
those grown-ups who refuse to cross
this sound threshold. Within the
barrier, youth can operate freely and
undisturbed.
The second thesis treats this erec¬
tion of a wall of sound in terms of
the sound-level of the environment.
In order to make themselves audible,
and to allow their own musicians a
proper hearing, it is necessary to be
louder than the ambient sound-level.
Some thought-provoking material
has been produced on the links bet¬
ween the general environmental level
of sound and the sound-levels of

SOUNDMARK OF VANCOUVER
One of the prominent soundmarks of Vancouver (Canada) is this set of air horns on top
of one of the city's higher buildings. It plays the opening of Canada's national anthem each day
at noon. It has been doing so since 1967 when a local engineer, Robert Swanson, thought
up the idea as a way of celebrating Canada's Centennial that year. Two other
Vancouver soundmarks are the bells of Holy Rosary Cathedral and the nightly
boom of the Nine O'Clock Gun.
music, not only in the realm of beat
and rock concerts, but also where
contemporary "serious" music is
concerned: in a historical perspective,
the growth in the size of orchestras
between Haydn and Mahler is also
not without interest.
- The next argument is closely con¬
nected with the preceding two, but is
based not on an attempt to over¬
power and drown out ambient sound-
levels, but to imitate them.
Here a number of acoustic factors
play a part, all of which can be found
in current music. The level of sound
is the most apparent characteristic,
but there are also special reverbera-
tive notes, continuous droning, or
clearly recognized rhythmical patterns
which match entirely the modern
sound environment.
If one now compares the unchang¬
ing broad spectrum of background
sound to the low drumming of a beat
band, the sharp wailing of a synthe¬
sizer, and the clumped notes (cluster
effect) of modern music, the argu¬
ment that the music is a mirroring
of our technical modern world of
sound becomes at least plausible.
Yet another thesis looks at the
effect of over-loud music on the
human organism. Thanks to a num¬
ber of scientific experiments in the
area of music therapy we now know
that music has a very powerful effect
on the autonomous nervous system
in -man, particularly where the action
of the heart, the biood circulation,
and breathing rhythms are concerned.
These physiological reactions allow
one to argue that beat music, for
example, is not merely experienced
through the auditory system, but is
felt on the pulses, on the skin, in
breathing and in the heart itself;
the whole physical body is affected
by music.
When listening to musical perfor¬
mances amplified to abnormal levels,
more hormones are released and
a state of excitement is induced in
the listener. The over-amplified
sound has the effect on the organism
of an alarm signal, forcing the release
of more adrenalinthe "fight or flight"
hormonefrom the body's chemical
system.
This physical stress situation can be
stimulating; it can also lead to acts of
aggression, e.g., the destruction of
seats at the end of a concert. The
flight reaction of the body moves
completely beyond conscious control,
and can lead, in the extreme, to
fainting fits.
Even more important are the most
recent studies on the effect of over-
amplified sound on the body. These
studies see the consequences reach¬
ing much further than their initial
effect on the nervous system, and
actually affecting the substance of
the brain.
As a result of acoustic shock, the
engramsthe delicate pathways
traced in the brain which produce
memoriescan be erased. Memory
gaps can be induced. This finding is
even more alarming when considering
the position of people forced to live
in an industrial soundscape.
Thus, today, we find ourselves in
a situation of acoustical crisis. We
will have to re-think the entire rela¬
tionship of men to their acoustical
environment, as well as the increase
in noise-producing potential in our
technical . tools. The conscious
control of our acoustical and musical
environment seems yet more neces¬
sary when we remember that the
same technology which has expanded
the sound range and repertory of
contemporary music to such a fasci¬
nating extent is also threatening our
very capacity to hear, to remain
sensitive to sound.
The time has come for a campaign
for the acoustical quality of life, for
an ecology of sound.

TUNING IN TO THE PAST
Can we recapture soundscapes of bygone days?
The Western world of the Middle
Ages readily believed that the peoples
of distant and little-known lands
possessed strange characteristics,
including oversized physical features.
One example was the "Panotii ', people
with enormous ears who were thought
to live "somewhere in the Indies
beyond the Ganges". In the 12th
century, images of three "Panotii"
man, woman and childwere
carved above the portal of the church
of Vézelay, in France (photo right). For
Christians of medieval times the ear
symbolized in particular the hearing
of the divine word. Left, a massive
bell about to be tolled in one of the
many temples in the town of
Bhadgaon (Nepal).

DAVID LOWENTHAL, Professor of Geo¬
graphy at University College London, has
written extensively on environmental per¬
ception and is currently concerned with
values attached to relics from the past. A
former Secretary of the American Geogra¬
phical Society and an associate editor of the
interdisciplinary quarterly Environment and
Behavior, he has published a number of
books including George Perkins Marsh, a bio¬
graphy of a pioneer American conservationist.
WHAT becomes of music,
speech, and other sounds-,
natural and man-made, when they
cease reverberating ? How far do
previous sounds differ from those of
today ? How much do we remember
of what we hear? What meanings
and emotions attach to sounds from
the past? Why do familiar sounds
often trigger nostalgic yearning?
What sounds do we regard as anti¬
quated, and why?
On these topics little is known and
less has been written. For each
of us the answers depend, in part,
on our age, our cultural heritage, and
our musical and other auditory ex¬
periences. This article is a first ex¬
ploration into past sounds and our
feelings about them.
The world we live in is a product
of the past; the very familiarity of
its features implies the memory of
previous experience. Awareness of
the past through mementoes and
monuments is essential to individuals
and to nations; the recognition of
continuity gives meaning to the
present and hope to the future.
Vision is the main sensory mode
through which we apprehend the past,
but it is not the only one. We are
aware of the passage of time and the
endurance of things through other
senses too.
This assertion may seem hardest
to demonstrate with respect to sound.
No noise that human beings are
capable of hearing is really old. Radio
signals from the stars, to be sure,
have taken many light years to reach
the earth, but these play an inconspi¬
cuous role in our acoustical land¬
scape. No sound that we actually
hear is more than a few moments
old; the rapid decay of sound energy
coupled with our limited capacity for
hearing makes even the loudest noise
undetectable soon after its inception.
In one sense, however, sound
seems the essence of time. Aural
impulses have long been the main
way of marking off years, seasons,
weeks, days, hours, and minutes:
bells, chimes, and other clock mecha¬
nisms provide a man-made counter¬
point to ' the natural periodicity of
pulse and heartbeat, and enhance our
awareness of connexions between
past and present.
Yet to recover the sounds of the
past is an infinitely more difficult
enterprise than to restore the visual
images of previous landscapes.
Countless visible relics, however
eroded, decayed, or selectively pre¬
served they may be, nonetheless
survive to ' tell us much about the
bygone material world and its spatial
organization.
But of sounds from the past, save
for a small and relatively recent
repertory, recorded for the most part
under laboratory or studio conditions, k
not a trace remains. No recording*

> exists of the loudest known noise in
world history, the explosion of Kra-
katoa volcano on 26-28 August 1 883,
which was heard 3,000 miles away,
and it is probable that no one now
alive would remember hearing it.
Of sounds before the phonograph,
we know only what can be surmised
from indirect evidence: the noises of
presumably unchanging natural or
human activities; the sounds pro¬
duced by ancient musical instruments;
the performance of music preserved
in notational form; the written ac¬
counts of those who heard and
reacted to the noises and music of
their times.
"We know how Chopin played,"
as Gerald Abraham puts it in The
Tradition of Western Music, "only
through the playing of the pupils of
the pupils of his pupils." And their
memory, like all of ours, is a notor¬
iously fallible guide. Earwitnesses
are to be trusted even less than
eyewitnesses. "Long term memory
tends to 'idealize' and isolate sounds,"
notes Barry Truax in an aural history
interview, which is one reason why
the tape-recorded past seems quite
unlike the sounds we imagine we
remember.
But however deficient these indirect
modes of historical reconstruction
may be, they are often invaluable.
The timbre, tone, and rhythm of a
clap of thunder, the beating of surf
against the shore, have probably
varied little over many millennia; the
ancient flute sounds today much as
it did when first made; the clash of
spear against shield, the ring of the
hammer at the forge, the sizzle of
meat on a Neolithic spit can be fairly
accurately reproduced by reactivating
their constituent parts.
Other features of past soundscapes,
however, are now unrecoverable: the
utterances . of extinct species, the
clangour of early metallurgy, the
intonations of ancient languages,
the distinctive susurrus of obsolete
domestic crafts. Not least, the words
spoken on any particular occasion
throughout history are gone beyond
recall.
For most of this we lack even indi¬
rect evidence. Least accessible is
the total ensemble of sounds that
characterized past epochs, the inter¬
play of background and foreground
noises that made up the daily sound¬
scape heard in each community and
locale.
We do have some clues to these
things, for we know that the, sounds
of nature antedate those of man, and
that machine noise follows the man-
made sounds of pre-industrial times.

Nostalgia for past sounds indeed cen¬
tres on our efforts to recapture, or
re-experience, the soundscape pat¬
terns that we associate with earlier,
simpler, more natural epochs.
Particularly do we sometimes long
for silence, that interval between
sounds so seldom present in the
interstices of our electronic age.
Nostalgia sometimes deceives us
about the past; not even screeching
jets and thundering subway trains
could be much worse than the
wheeled traffic of late 19th century

architect H. B. Creswell:

DESIGNED WITH EAR AND EYE
In religious buildings, certain architectural forms tend to promote the kind of
audio-visual balance required for religious worship. Such buildings have a vitally
important acoustic function: singing, prayers and instrumental music establish a
link with the spiritual world. In Gothic cathedrals the lightness of the arches and
the rhythmic repetition of the lofty stained-glass windows help sound waves
to disperse. Like the vaulting branches of trees in a forest, the arching pillars
act as distributors of sound, an analogy strikingly illustrated in photo montage,
left, of a Gothic nave giving on to a forest path. Below, entrance to the Shah
Abbas, or Blue Mosque, at Isfahan (Iran) where the acoustics are so sensitive
that a snap of the fingers directly beneath the cupola echoes no less than seven '
times. Bottom, 13th-century minaret in Turkmenistan (U.S.S.R.): from its tip
the voice of the muezzin echoes as far as the horizon. Minaret's spiralled
structure recalls that of the famous ziggurat-shaped minaret of Samarra (Iraq).
tyred wheels jarring from the apex of
one set to the next like sticks drag¬
ging along a fence; the creaking and
groaning and chirping and rattling of
vehicles... the jangling of chain har¬
ness and the clanging or jingling of
every other conceivable thing else,
augmented by the shriekings and
bellowings... raised a din that... is
beyond all conception. It was not
any such paltry thing as noise. It
was an immensity of sound.
The everyday sounds of the past
were different, yes, but not necessa-
rily preferable, as we are often
tempted to suppose, to those of today.
Nevertheless, the city dweller who
retreats to the rural countryside, or
anyone who sojourns for a time in
the wilderness, rightly supposes that
the change of locale brings him in
contact with earlier or previous
soundscapes. It is difficult wholly
to escape the everyday sounds of
modern life, for the internal combu¬
stion engine and long-distance com¬
munications are almost omnipresent.
But today's natural and rural envi¬
ronments bear at least some resem¬
blance to those of earlier epochs, and
by listening to what happens there we
can partly recapture the soundscapes
of the past. Just how much today's
natural or rural sounds replicate
yesterday's can not be determined,
however. A desire for both authen¬
ticity and specificity animates our
continuing search for ways to recover
the actual sounds of the past.
THE capacity or ability to recap¬
ture such sounds is a recurrent
theme of imaginative literature. Ba¬
ron Munchausen describes a winter so
cold that a hunter's tune froze in his
bugle, emerging as audible notes only
the following spring. Rabelais's Pan¬
tagruel, sailing on the confines of the
Frozen Sea, is amazed, while seeing
nothing, to hear a great dinthe
booming of cannon, the whistling of
bullets, the shouts and groans of
men, the jostling of armour, the
clashing of battle axes, the neighing
of horses; all these sounds of a great
battle, fought there the previous
winter, had frozen in the air and
were only now tumbling down and
melting into audibility.
The "Journeyers to the East" in
Hermann Hesse's The Glass Bead
Game include itinerant instrumen¬
talists and minstrels whose "mystic
identification with remote ages and
cultural conditions" enabled them "to
perform the music of earlier epochs^
with perfect ancient purity... exactly F

CRICKET'S MUSICAL 'FILE'.
Only the male cricket produces sound.
It chirps by rubbing an upturned "scraper"
on one fore-wing along a "file" or thickened
vein with crossridges on the underside
of the other fore-wing. Photo above, taken

It was always thought that the spider
had no hearing organ, but then tiny slits
stretched from a fine membrane linked
to sensory cells were discovered

believe that these lyre-shaped organs,
sensitive to vibrations, may be a kind
of foot-mounted ear.

as if all the subsequent modes,
refinements, and virtuoso achieve¬
ments were still unknown."
One archaeological dreamer sur¬
mises that, by analogy with the
sound that needles re-evoke in record
grooves, the voices of plasterers of
past millennia may be caught in the
masonry of ancient walls and temples,
awaiting only the proper stylus to
come to life once more.
The desire to regain audible his¬
tory bespeaks the power of sound
to transport us back to the past. To
hear, or even just to remember, a
familiar tune, can instantly call to
mind long-vanished scenes and
events.
The playing of childhood melodies
was said to have triggered fatal out¬
breaks of nostalgia among Swiss sol¬
diers serving in France and Belgium
during the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Kühe-Reihen or ranz-des-vaches,
rustic tunes to which herds were
driven to Alpine pastures, revived
Swiss recollections of their homeland.
The tune, "a fragment of the past,"
as the Swiss essayist Jean Staro-
binski puts it, "revives in the imagi¬
nation all our former life ...". ;
Music is not the only'sound to
arouse such memories; the bubbling
of springs and the murmuring of
streams, even certain vocal inflec¬
tions, can also be evocative.1 Indeed
the 19th-century French novelist,
Etienne Pivert de Sénancour, felt that
"the sounds emanating from sublime
places make a deeper, more lasting,
impression than do their visual fea¬
tures."' The significance ï óf £ sound
dominates the inhabitants of Ameri¬
can author John Updike's imaginary
planet, Minerva: "an elderly Minervan
wishing to memorialize his life, would
remember it almost exclusively in
terms of music he had heard, or had
made."
Any sound, if memory is vivid,
evokes the past. But certain sounds
in particular induce us to sense them
as old, stemming from antiquity or.
surviving from a remote past.
Real or fancied similarity to some
known work persuades us to link
new music to some past epoch. Even
the use of a particular key may evoke
the musical past.
Thus long accumulated associa¬
tions with major and minor modes
make it difficult for some cognoscenti,
according to Gerald Abraham, to
"hear B minor without our sub¬
conscious being stirred by memories
of the Kyrie of Bach's Mass, the
first movement of the Unfinished
Symphony, and Tchaikovsky's Pathé¬
tique."
The timbre as well as the structure
of music may suggest the past.
Certain instruments, whatever their
actual age, produce tones that are
generally recognized as archaic. The
recognition stems from our expecta¬
tion, based on a mixture of experience
and belief, that early musical instru¬
ments were characteristically thin,
reedy, quavering, or nasal; from the
absence of a well-tempered pitch; or
from certain acoustic propertiesthe
castrato voice, for examplethat are
no longer to be found.
THE presumption of antiquity
may be mistaken: not many
early instruments have the archaeolo¬
gical authenticity of the Ukrainian
mammoth bones, so cut and shaped
that Soviet scholars could deduce
that Cro-Magnon man 20,000 years
ago used them as percussion instru¬
ments; modern tests on them, as Ser¬
gei Bibikov describes in the "Unesco
Courier" (June 1975), yield "hard,
resonant, and musically expressive"
sounds.
But many so-called early instru¬
ments are in fact copies or recon¬
structions of originals; we have
little firm evidence about how early
music sounded; some modern music
is intentionally written for antique
instruments or set to deliberately
anachronistic language, like Stra¬
vinsky's Lyke-Wake Cantata.
A presumption of antiquity also
attaches to sounds that seem worn,
flawed, or partly obliterated. Such
tones strike the ear as being either
products of ancient forces or end
results of processes öf decay. . A
scratched record, a muffled church
bell, and a wheezy car engine give
the illusion of having come from long
ago because their tones suggest
much prior use. A cracked or qua¬
vering voice conveys a sense of time
past because we may assume it be¬
longs to an old man or woman.
= Words sung or spoken may be ano¬
ther high road to antiquity. Songs,
chants, and other vocalizations
connote age when they employ anti¬
quated language or refer to historical
personages or epochs. References
to bygone persons and places, obso¬
lete vocabulary, and archaic musical
style and instrumentation converge
to create compelling illusions of anti¬
quity, as in Gregorian chants.
Words or eroded sounds often
combine with aural memories to
conjure up past images. Philip Lar-
kin's novel Girl in Winter describes
how recorded music can evoke a
vanished scene:
The record was old-fashioned, and
had a tinny quality only partly due to
the needle. The tune it played had
been popular for perhaps a week or
two, or perhaps even for as long as
a musical comedy had run in London,
but was now quite forgotten. The
orchestra that played it did so in
what had been the fashion of the
moment, with little empty tricks
of syncopation that recalled the out¬
moded dresses of the girls that had
danced to it. It was strange to
think it had once sounded modern.
Now it was like an awning propped in
the sun, nearly white, that years ago
had been striped bright red and
yellow.
The content and condition of the
musical reproduction together sug¬
gest outworn tastes, frayed and faded
fabrics, evanescent popularity. -
Auditory like visual experience
often makes natural things seem pre¬
vious to man-made ones. Rocks,
trees, lichen may look older than
houses or highways because we
assume that nature generally ante-,
dates artifice. The sounds of nature
may similarly suggest a primeval -
scene.
For Larkin's antagonist, "as far as
age was concerned, sheer age that
was almost timelessness, the sound
of trees was more impressive" than
an ancient Oxford church. "The
surrounding treetops settling and
unsettling with an endless sifting of
leaves ... filled the air with the
whispering of eternity, ... making
this place, famous as it was, like all
other places."
But the rustle of wind in trees,
like the atavistic charm of breaking
waves, is not so much ancient as it is
eternal. Such sounds betoken not
the historical past but the primordial
scene, a time previous to history.
The sounds of decay, like its
visual images, also evoke a feeling of
desuetude. A crumbling stone wall.

### 49594: Tuning in to the past: can we recapture soundscapes of bygone days?
an ivy-covered building, a mossy roof
are felt to be old because they are
apparently weathering back to age-
old nature. Similarly, tunes, speech,
and other man-made noises patterned
after the sounds of nature or decaying
so as to resemble them impress
hearers as akin to primeval.
We tend to assume that sounds dis¬
tant in space are also remote in time;
far away and long ago seem intima¬
tely interwoven. The experience of
echoes bears this out in paradoxical
fashion. As reverberations in ampli¬
fied space they echo sounds further
away but after the original sound.
The growth of interest in sounds
stemming both from nature and from
the human past mirrors increasing
disenchantment with the noises felt
to be most characteristic of the pre¬
sent day.
And a preference for. the aural
past goes beyond music; it questions
the quality of the whole modern
soundscape. The broad-gauge blur
of the machine-dominated environ¬
ment creates sounds that are in¬
herently boring. "In the past the
trains either whistled more or we
heard them better," reminisced one
old lady about the 1920s. "They
had more personality."
This is the quality that makes so
many sounds of the past a precious
legacy, now in danger of being lost
through obsolescence, and that gives
purpose to the World Soundscape
Project's effort to record certain
sounds before they vanish (see
page 4).
Such sounds include the ringing of
old cash registers, washing clothes
on a washboard, churning butter, a
razor being stropped, a kerosene
lamp, the squeak of leather saddle
bags, hand coffee grinders, milk cans
rattling on horse-drawn vehicles,
heavy doors being clanked shut and
bolted, school hand bells, wooden
rocking chairs on wooden floors,
the quilt explosion of old cameras
and hand-operated water pumps.
A special auditory quality often
associated with the past is silence.
We are so accustomed today to per¬
vasive background noise that when
it is absent we feel transported into
another time, the past if we were
accustomed long ago to the absence
of noise, the future if we have never
experienced certain surroundings
without it.
Critical reactions to the present
soundscape help to make us aware
that the ¡ audible environment has a
temporal character. Just as concert
audiences have grown used to hear¬
ing chronologically sequential pro
grammes, so does the whole sonic
world begin to acquire historical
markers.
We tend more and more to date the
distinctive elements of the sound¬
scape medley: the crash of waves
and the wind in the trees seem eter¬
nal; bird-song is both seasonal and
cyclical; voices seem either old or
new depending on "their age and
familiarity; traffic sounds are placed
in time because we have experienced,
or heard recordings of, trains and
cars and planes of various vintages;
music and Muzak have temporal con¬
notations that differ depending on
where and how we hear them.
Even when we do not consciously
attend to these sounds their tempora¬
lity affects us. As we keep incorpor¬
ating past sounds into our present
lives, the auditory medley takes on
an increasingly diachronic character.
We hear in the present but simultane¬
ously recognize elements, tonalities,
and themes from many pasts.
What can be concluded from all
this? Given our present level of
technology, past sounds, strictly
speaking, appear to be irrecoverable.
Sounds persist only in memory, often
evoked by associations, and in their
influence on imagination.
What we can reconstruct from indi¬
rect evidence, however, suggests
that in many important respects past
soundscapes differed substantially
from those of today. It is partly
because of these differences that we
remain so strongly attached to sounds
that we consider to be antiquated,
whether or not they are truly old.

### 49599: Early man goes through the speech barrier
EARLY MAN GOES THROUGH
THE SPEECH BARRIER
by Aleksey A. Leontyev
THE ancient Greeks believed that
field mice could read and there¬
fore used to scratch messages on
stones asking the mice to keep out
of their fields. Legends aboutspeech
and sound persist among many peoples
of the world. There are several Rus¬
sian folk tales in which the hero tries
to learn the language of birds and
beasts as well as the languages of
other peoples.
In one such tale, for instance, the
hero's parents send him out into the
world "to learn many different: lan¬
guages from a wise man so that he
may know what the bird says when
it sings, the horse when it neighs
and the sheep when it bleats."
Animals live in the same world of
sounds as man: the sounds, firstly,
of inanimate naturethe whistle of
the wind, the thunder of the water¬
fall, the rumble of the avalanche;
the sounds of other living creatures
the song of birds, the shriek of the
howler monkey, the snarl of the tiger;
and the sounds made by man and by
man-made things.
i It is the same world of sounds, but
yet completely different: animals are,
: as it were, completely separated from
that world by an impenetrable psy¬
chological barrier, a filter which lets
through only certain sounds. They
ALEKSEY A. LEONTYEV, head of the de¬
partment of Methods and Psychology at the
Pushkin Institute of the R ussian language, in
Moscow, is a leading Soviet specialist in lin¬
guistics and psychology. He is the author of
10 books and over 200 papers in these fields,
many of which have been widely translated,'
and was a contributor to Foundations of

published under Unesco's auspices in 1975.
hear sounds but heed only those
which are in some way connected
in their consciousness with their own
vital needs, those which have signi¬
ficance as a signal.
The female nightingale appreciates
the singing of the male as a signal
of the forthcoming satisfaction of its
sexual needs, whilst to a prowling
cat the same song conveys quite a
different messagea meal in the
offing. The roar of a tiger is a danger
signal for all other living creatures.
To an animal, human speech is just
another, more complex signal, ano¬
ther element of reflex behaviour.
Even such domesticated, animals as
dogs, which sometimes appear to
understand everything that is said
to them, are in fact responding to
the sound of the words (not to the
sense of those words) as research
by the eminent Dutch animal psycho¬
logist F. Buytendijk and the Soviet
physiologist Leonid Voronin has shown.
The essential difference between
man, even primitive man, and animals
is that man does not submit passively
to nature but pits himself against it.
He joins forces with others, helps
them and is helped in return. He
uses things made by others and co¬
operates with them in transforming
his environment. A new world thus
emerges, the world of man and of
man's achievements, material and
spiritual, the world of human culture.
Sound too forms part of this emer¬
gent culture. Primitive man needed
sounds in order to organize collective
labour. Whereas among ; animals
sound is identified with needs, with
man it became identified with activity.
It would be interesting to know
what these first truly human sounds,
the primitive speech of Neanderthal
man, were like. Early man obviously
had the necessary vocal apparatus,
but its functions were limited: the
edges of the vocal folds, or true vocal
cords, had not yet curved round and
the passage between the larynx and
the oral cavity was narrow, while the
soft palate was further away from
the back of the larynx than in present-
day man.
This means that the speech of
Neanderthal man must have been
accompanied by a lot of inharmo¬
nious, piercing, high-pitched noises-
whines, screeches, squeaks, etc.
This, however, was not the most
important characteristic of primitive
speech. Soviet anthropologists who
have studied the shape of the cere-'
bral cavity in the skulls of our early
ancestors have come to the conclu¬
sion that by Neanderthal times the
fronto-temporal region of the cerebral
Cortex, which is responsible for orga¬
nizing external stimuli, images and
signals into a coherent order, was
becoming highly developed.
This development signified a revo¬
lutionary change. Man had hitherto
simply allowed sound to break over
him like the waves of a great ocean,
distinguishing only certain "splashes"
of sound which carried some vital
message for him.
But when sound acquired a social
significance, man had an objective
criterion for comparing different so¬
cial sounds with each other: sound
became to some extent independent
of the perception of a particular hu¬
man being, and acquired an objective
content which was the same for all
hearers. Only then could man cap-

MASKED VOICES AND
SPOKEN SIGNATURES
For centuries the plastic arts depicted the human voice simply as
an open mouth, suggesting the spoken word or a cry,
as in the head surmounting this pottery vessel from Zaire (left).
Below, decorative mask carved in stone and symbolizing tragedy,
in the ruins of a Roman theatre at Demre (Turkey). Like their
Greek counterparts, Roman actors wore masks, pierced
with enormous gaping mouths, indicating the nature
of the characters they played. Recently a Swiss musician
and painter, Aage Justesen, has succeeded in giving the human
voice visual form. The vibrations of the voice can be recorded
as a series of irregularly-shaped overlapping surfaces
which are then photographed. Justesen has used
this process to record famous contemporary figures pronouncing
their own name and has given the name "pictonoms" to the resulting
"spoken signatures". Below, in descending order, the "pictonoms"
of the celebrated violinist Yehudi Menuhin, Sherpa Tensing
(the Nepalese who reached the summit of Everest with
Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953) and the Spanish painter Joan Miró.

ture sounds and compare them with
other sounds, only then could he
put two meaningful sounds together.
Thus he acquired the faculty oí speech,
the faculty of communicating with
others.
As primitive man's activities be¬
came more varied and complex he
began to acquire a faculty which he
had previously lacked, that of per¬
ceiving his own actions as a chain
of separate but sequentially linked
operations. Previously he had to
indicate his activities by means of
single, unarticulated sounds, but now
there was no longer anything to pre¬
vent him articulating different sounds
to compose a complete, coherently
developing sequence.
This again represented a revolu¬
tion in the relations between man
and his world, and in his perception
of the world: sound now became
subjectively linked not with an acti¬
vity, but with a particular object used
in that activity. Sounds had become
symbols.
Words now began to represent
only that aspect of things which is
of practical utility. They conveyed
ideas about things themselves, about
the whole category of similar objects
and about the variety of functions
which such objects perform in social
life. As words developed this new
role, general ideas about objects
began to exist independently of the
particular situation in which the object
is being usedconcepts emerged.
The . next and vitally important
development was the appearance of
concepts which were not connected
"with any tangible object. Joy and
sorrow, time and space, life and
death have no existence in the world
of material objects, but they exist
in the world of words and the world
of concepts. Thus, thanks to sounds,
thanks to words, man could now juggle
with the most abstract concepts.
Words were now becoming more
and moo3 numerous, but the human
ability to pronounce different sounds
was still restricted. Such a skill
became increasingly necessary as
words could now be lifted from their
immediate context, that of practical
activity, and needed to be recognized,
distinguished, demarcated from other,
similar words. How was this to be
done?
One way of varying sounds is by
the pitch of the fundamental tone,
but here again the possibilities are
limited: the human vocal apparatus,
except for that of a Chaliapine, is
capable of producing sounds within
a register of only two octaves, and
the vocal apparatus of primitive man,
as we have already seen, was inca
pable of producing pure musical
tones.
A simpler way is to take variations
of timbre-the pitch and quantity of
overtonesi.e. to take as the criterion
for distinguishing between different
sounds the region in which the cha¬
racteristic resonance bands determin¬
ing the quality of a given sound are
to be found, a region known as the
formant of that sound. The formant
does not depend on the fundamental
tone with which a particular sound
is uttered. The concomitant noises
occurring along with consonants are
'also situated within the limits of par¬
ticular regions of the sound spectrum.
This was the way which nature
chose in creating human speech.
Each of the thousands of languages
in the world has its own system of
speech sounds. Each of these sys¬
tems satisfies at least two conditions:
all the sounds in that system are
sufficiently well differentiated in their
place and manner of articulation.
However, only those differences in
articulation which produce adequate
differentiation of formants, thus en¬
suring that the ear can distinguish the
different sounds, are actually used.
The criteria used for differentiating
the sounds of speech vary widely from
one language to another. In Rus¬
sian, sounds are differentiated by
place of articulation (labial, dental
and velar consonants), by whether
they are voiced or unvoiced, "soft"
or "hard", and by whether or not the
nasal cavity is involved in their pro¬
nunciation.
There is no distinction between
hard and soft in German, but there
is a distinction between strong and
weak. The aspirate-non-aspirate
distinction is important in Hindi. In
Fori, one of the languages of Papua-
New Guinea, none of these previous
distinctions is made and the important
differences are the presence or absence
of the nasal glide or the glottal stop
at the beginning of a consonant. The
length of the consonant is also an
important factor.
In the course of his development
man learned to organize word sounds
into coherent sequences. Why then
should he not apply the same prin¬
ciple to organizing sounds within the
word itself? This would obviously
give him even greater opportunities
for distinguishing words and in par¬
ticular for inventing new ones in order
to keep pace with the ever-increasing
variety of objects and concepts in the
world around him.
The task of shifting sounds around
and putting them into different orders
did not, however, prove easy. Even^
now it is not easy because of ther

TO PREHISTORY
Thousands of years old, this strip
of reindeer horn (below) is one
of the most ancient musical
instruments yet discovered.
Covered with geometric incisions
and painted with red ochre, it
was found in the Dordogne
region of France. It bears a strong
resemblance to an instrument
known as a "bull-roarer" (above)
once used in Brazil during certain
mystic ceremonies. The bull-roarer
consists of a thin board that
the player holds by a cord tied
to one end and whirls over his head.
In whirling, the board also spins
around its own axis, thus
producing a roaring or wailing
sound. Today the bull-roarer
is simply an easily improvised toy.

, need to arrange sounds into basic
pronounceable unitssyllables. For
this reason, a particular sequence of
vowels and consonants is obligatory
in many languagesthe Polynesian
languages, Japanese and others.
In those languages where the
syllable can end with a consonant,
the choice of such final consonants
is always smaller than that of initial
consonants, and in the languages
of South-East Asia-Chinese, Viet¬
namese, Burmesethese are almost
exclusively the so-called sonants.
The combination of consonants in a
syllable thus always follows a definite
articulatory sequence.
To take an example from the Rus¬
sian language, we have the mono¬
syllabic word "vdrug", meaning "sud¬
denly", but .from the point of view
of articulation the syllables "drvug" or
"rdrug" are not possible words.
Another new world also emerged
alongside the world of words: that
of socially experienced feelings, ex¬
pressed in images specially created
for that purpose. Primitive art, pri¬
mitive sculpture and music were born.
The opinions of scholars differ as
to the origins of music. The com¬
monest theory is that man began by
mimicking the sounds of nature. But
there are no. clearly distinguishable
differences of pitch in nature, no cri¬
teria, that is to say, that the originator
of the first scale could work by. Why
for that matter did he need to fix, to
memorize a sound of a particular pitch
in order to compare it with others?
The most likely explanation is that
the first sounds of fixed pitch were
speech sounds which already had a
human significance. Musicologists
who have studied the music of
present-day peoples with archaic
forms of culture, such asthe aborigines
of Tierra del Fuego or the Vedda of
Sri Lanka, have found that singing is
the only form of music familiar to
them and that there is a striking simi¬
larity in the musical structure of
their chants, the overwhelming major-

ity of which consist of a sequence of
only two or three notes, not exceeding
the range of a minor third. The
songs of peoples with a more highly
developed culture such as the Hausa
of Africa have a similar recitative
form, a similar sequence of two notes
separated by a minor third.
The ability to distinguish the sounds
of music thus developed from the
ability to distinguish differences of
timbre, and is another physiological
mechanism peculiar to man. This
ability was systematized and dev¬
eloped as music itself developed.
Music, however, did not part company
entirely with speech. There are many
known languages in which differences,
of pitch help to distinguish different
words or even different syllables-
Lithuanian and Serbo-Croat, Swedish
and Norwegian, Japanese and Ainu,
most of the African languages, many
of the Amerindian languages, Chinese,
Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, the
Austronesian languages and many
of the languages of Papua.
Sound was now broken down into
separate phonemes and syllables, but
in the form of stress or accent it
continued its existence. Accent
may be even or it may be musical,
using differences of pitch, or it may
take the form of stress, involving
differences of intensity. But there
is not à single language, nor indeed
a single word in any language,
without accent. Accent is a vestigial
fragment of the primitive speech
sound, but one which now plays a
new function.
Speech is, however, more than
the sum of the words which compose
it. Words flow together into com¬
plete utterances and the thing that
binds them together, which indicates
their special functions (question,
exhortation, exclamation), which

shows what elements of the utterance
the speaker considers most impor¬
tant, is yet again sound, this time
embodied in the speaker's intona¬
tion.
Intonation is another vestigial
trace of primitive, probably even
animal sound: "dumb" animals, al¬
though they are unable to imitate
speech sounds, can sometimes imi¬
tate human intonation quite
accurately.
The language of man contains yet
i' another leftover from its animal an¬
cestry: interjections, those inarticulate
utterances which facilitate the ex¬
pression of the simplest emotions-
fear, surprise, joy, sorrow, admiration,
etc.without the use of words. In¬
terjections are similar, though not
always identical, from one language
to another. To express surprise, a
Russian says "Akh!" or "Okh!", a
Frenchman "Oh-la-la!", an English¬
man "Oh!", a German "Ho Ho!", and
a Papuan of the Asmat tribe "Woo".
Another ancient stratum of sound
in various languages is onomatopoeia.
A Russian represents the crow of a
cock as "kukareku", a German as
"kikiriki" and an Englishman as "cock-
a-doodle-doo".
Sound has been socialized, it has
become the common property of all
humanity, but at the same time it
remains an essential element of that
which makes each individual human.
Soundthe sound of speechmakes
all the wealth of knowledge and social
experience available to us. Sound
the sound of musicenriches our
emotional world. The sounds of
man are social sounds and the world
of human sound is. a social world.
Underlying the system of sounds in
any given language is a particular out¬
look on the world which is expressed
in that language, in its sounds, its
words and its grammatical forms.
To be able to grasp this new, always
fresh, always surprising outlook, to
see the ßame world through different
eyes, is a great pleasure which is now
) accessible to more and more people.
Aleksey A. Leontyev
The wind sighing in the trees, ruffling water, beating across vast plains
and rushing through narrow mountain gorges produces some of nature's
most striking and memorable sounds. In the 17th century a German
Jesuit scientist, Athanasius Kircher, widely known for his writings on
acoustics and musicology, created this "wind harp", a curious
instrument whose strings vibrated in the wind to produce unexpected
and mysterious sounds.
WIND, WATER
AND TALKING BUSTS
Hero of Alexandria, the Greek
mathematician and writer on
mechanical subjects who lived
in the 1st century A. D. created
remarkable "water sculptures"
which delighted his
contemporaries. In this
ingenious example, the water
fills the box and drives out
the air, causing the birds to
pipe different notes. The water
is then emptied by means of
a syphon causing the owl to
turn towards the birds which
are now silent.
Engraving shows the creation of a sound environment as imagined
by Athanasius Kircher, inventor of the wind harp shown above, in his
work Phonurgia Nova (1673), a mixture of serious scientific exposition
and a kind of science fiction. A system of "acoustic horns" funnels
street noises to the "talking busts" inside the houses. A modern
counterpart exists in the U. S. A. today where a young American
composer, Maryanne Amacher, creates experimental "musical"
compositions out of natural and urban sounds. Such sounds are
relayed live to a concert hall and are blended into spontaneous
"musical" performances.

WE all live in an environment
of acoustical vibrations from
which we take what is useful, infor¬
mative, and enjoyable for human
existence and into which we broad¬
cast a variety of sounds that others
may hear and make use of. From
the standpoint of the behavioural
sciences, the phenomena we call
sounds can be divided into three
basic categories, the first called
noise, the second music, and the
third speech. I will try to explore
these three realms of sonic expe¬
rience here from the somewhat
specialized perspective of psychiatry.
NOISE. Physically, all acoustical
phenomena share certain properties.
Sounds are produced by movements

Noise is generally thought to be

PSYCHOANALYSIS
OF SOUND

tense, irritable, annoyed or actually
in pain.
This does not mean that all noise
should be controlled or eliminated.
One of the great advantages of the
Soundscape Project inaugurated by
Murray Schäfer and his colleagues
in Vancouver is that it shows the
sorts of noises people become adap¬
ted to and learn to live with (see
article page 4). A certain amount
of discomfort can also result when
we are suddenly deprived of the
customary environmental noises.
Physiologists used to think of the
ear as having a fairly fixed "threshold, "
and that a sound could not be per¬
ceived until it achieved an intensity
capable of crossing this threshold for
hearing. We now know this to be
an overly simple idea, one which
may be true for a very small set of
relatively pure sounds presented
under controlled conditions in a
laboratory, but is not applicable to
the majority of noises.
Indeed, every sound of nature is
a relatively complex physical event,
one which must be considered in.
terms of the duration of time from
the onset of vibrations to their cessa¬
tion, plus the exact waveforms,
frequencies, and intensities of vibra¬
tory components. Not only may the
auditory threshold shift in the course
of listening, but even before a sound
actually begins, different listeners
can have different threshold levels
depending on their state of arousal
and their expectations.
One reason why noises differ in
their effects is that as we focus to
listen, our eardrums may tighten up,
requiring less acoustical energy to
set the auditory system in motion
than when the drums are relaxed.
Under the condition of auditory
attentiveness our ears are maximally
receptive, and sounds that are ordi¬
narily ignored may then come into
awareness and be labelled as noise.
One can easily observe this reaction
in the concert hall when a slight
whisper by someone in the audience
can be distracting and unpleas¬
ant to the attentive music-lover.
Acoustical scientists who use
instruments to measure sound have
discovered that what we call noise
tends to have a high intensitywhen
reaching about 120 decibels a sound
actually starts to produce painand
that in terms of vibration pattern,
noise tends to be spread in a fairly
dense and irregular way across the
frequency spectrum, with a time
distribution that is not very predictable.
Science also is able to make some
fairly reliable statements about how
much noise is potentially damaging
to the ear as well as to the rest of
the human body.
But can the physical study of
sound waves totally define what a
noise is? No! Some human fac¬
tors play a very important role in
this. For instance, a listener's age
seems to determine how much and
what kind of sound can be tolerated.
Youngsters in general tolerate much
more noise than do oldsters, and a
cymbal crash or vocal shriekenjoyable
for a teenager can drive a middle-
aged person quite frantic.
Tastes and styles in listening
change from generation to genera¬
tion. Thus, the engineer with his
battery of measuring devices capable
of giving objective definitions to
various noises, is still left in the end
with a subjective definition: noise is
unwanted sound.

### 49600: Psychoanalysis of sound
With this definition in mind, we
can turn to some observations about
noise which are of psychiatric interest.
First of all, there appears to be a
strong association between noise
and fear. Throughout the course of
human history noise has been dreaded
as a source of evil power. The
ancients thought that noise has
death-dealing properties and .one
finds the idea in primitive folkiore,
for example, that it is the noise of a
spear's impact which kills its victim.
The Assyrians believed in evil deities
capable of producing noises that
cause earthquakes and storms.
Frightful creatures are often por¬
trayed as noisy. One sees this
characterization not only on the
stage where villains shriek and dan¬
gerous beasts roar, but also in the
behaviour of people who are on the
attack.
Noise has been a tool of warfare
for centuries. Trumpet blasts and
drumbeats incite men to action. The
Romans employed a special cadre of
troops to make noises capable of
frightening and confusing the enemy.
The invention of chemical explosives
for warfare strengthened this con¬
nexion between noise and offen-
siveness, and during the two world
wars, systematic efforts were made
to find sounds that can kill.
Gala concert!
The technology of destructive
sound is paradoxically silent ! Ultra¬
sonic beams which can burn and
destroy tissue actually are inaudible
to the human ear. Used mostly for
medical work in ultrasound diagnosis
and surgery, this form of acoustical
energy does not at the present time
pose much of a threat to humankind.
Noise has often been used for
therapeutic purposes. Defective or
damaged organs give off tell-tale
noises, and clinicians must know
how to recognize them. Scraping
joints, heart murmurs, harsh noises
in the chest, gurgling of the intes¬
tines and many other body
noises have been diagnostic signs
for centuries, detected first by the
clinicians' unaided ears and later by
technical means, such as percussion
of the chest and auscultation with a
stethoscope. Today's specialized
methods of phonocardiography can
give useful information about heart
disease.
Currently, doctors do not believe
that excessive noise is particularly
good for patients. But it should be
mentioned before we go on to the
two other categories of sound that
there have been therapists who
firmly believed in the curative pro¬
perties of violent acoustical stimuli,
mostly in the days when illness was
thought to be caused by evil spirits
"taking possession" of the body.
To aid in exorcising these invaders,
healers would scream and yell at
patients, or use instruments to make
terrifying noises. The influence of
Mesmer, a doctor of the 1 8th century
who believed in animal magnetism
rather than evil spirits (and, inciden¬
tally, was a practising music thera¬
pist) has promoted a much quieter
and restrained form of psychotherapy.
Yet even today, mostly in nonmedical
circles, a so-called "primal scream"
therapy is being promoted. It calls
for noise as part of the healing
process.
MUSIC. I now want to comment
on music as a distinctive experience
in the world of sound, one that is
more pleasurable than noise but
unlike speech conveys no precise or
linguistic meanings. The highly emo¬
tional and desirable connotations of
music probably stem from childhood,
before communication with words,
when an ebb and flow of rhythms
and vocalizations bound the infant to
his or her mother and song-and-
dance was part of socialization
through play.
Every human being has a residue
of ecstatic feelings tied up in memory
with blissful emotions. It can be
tapped when the individual is appro¬
priately stimulated, through singing,
playing, listening, and participating
in music.
Subsequent life experiences have a
tendency to emphasize the importance
of music for emotional well-being or,
on the contrary, to squelch the child's
involvement in this form of sonic
hedonism. Some children develop a
special relationship to music, an art
form available in every human cul¬
ture which offers unique opportunities
for imagination and self-expression.
Like mathematics, the other great
nonverbal form of thinking that
interests many children, music occa¬
sionally produces a marvel of nature.
This is the child prodigyWolfgang
Amadeus Mozart or Yehudi Menuhin
for examplewho can set the world
on fire with his extraordinary abilities
even before reaching adolescence.
Other musically gifted personalities
emerge into the spotlight of public
acclaim only when they are big
enough and sufficiently independent
to forge a career without parental
guidancethe Beatles, for example,
whose musical taste and even general
bearing and behaviour have influenced
an entire generation of people in
many countries of the world. Devoid
of semantics, music is the only lan¬
guage that approaches true univer¬
sality.
Music-making is a skill that involves
specific vocal and/or manual move¬
ments, and for this reason is much
easier to acquire during the firsts
decade of life. Our mental and*

### 49600: Psychoanalysis of sound
^emotional openness to the learning
of new complex acts tends to fade
after puberty, and this limits the
number of people who can excel in
musical behaviour.
The psychiatrist thus encounters
two kinds of problems around music.
One has to do with musicians who
cannot tolerate their minority status
and who may suffer from the social
isolation which results from speciali¬
zation and excellence. The other
problem has to do with non-musicians
who for various internal and external
reasons cannot participate in this
foremost emotional experience and
thus are cut off from one of the richest
sources of human culture.
It is interesting from a historical
perspective that Sigmund Freud, the
psychiatrist whose ideas have had
such a strong influence during the
past eighty years as a result of his
extraordinary literary skill and force
of character, was in significant ways
unmusical.
This may have stemmed in part
from his early childhood. Freud
became upset when his little sister
started playing the piano and in a
rather tyrannical way he demanded
that the offending instrument be
removed from the house. Later,
when the world-famous psychoanalyst
was consulted by musicians, including
Gustav Mahler and Bruno Walter, he
spent very little time with these men
in contrast to the much greater atten¬
tion he gave to other patients.
Nor did Freud's most creative
disciple, the psychiatrist O G. Jung,
have much understanding for music,
as he regretfully confessed in personal
correspondence. Part of the problem
may stem from the intense curiosity
both of these men of genius displayed
towards dreaming as a means of
psychological insight.
Not only are dreams mostly visual,
but the sound-effects that accom¬
pany them tend to be difficult to
remember and even more difficult
to talk about. During sleep, hearing
tends to be directed outward into the
external environment, whereas the
eyes are closed and able to scan the
inner, psychic milieu. Hervey de
Saint-Denis, whose dream studies
were published several decades
before Freud's, found that different
tunes played while he was asleep
caused him to dream about women
he had danced with to these tunes.
The composer Igor Stravinsky was
able to observe how dreaming helped
his creativity. One night before
going to bed he was disturbed by a
certain tonal interval which kept
coming to mind, and he dreamt about
it as an elastic substance stretched
between two notes. Along with the
notes he visualized testicle-like eggs,
warm and protected by nests. This
vision apparently reassured the com¬
poser, and after waking up he felt'
more comfortable about his musical
ideas and whatever else had been
troubling him.
I once treated a patient who, after
dreaming about a theme from Bach's
Saint Matthew Passion, suddenly
came to the realization that he felt
jealous enough to "crucify" his best
friend.
SPEECH. Finally we turn to speech,
the third major component of man's
world of sound, one we value most
for reasoning and for the communi¬
cation of explicit, factual meanings.
Like music, speech begins in
infancy. The mother orfather fol¬
lows the child's gaze to what interests
him or her and teaches the child what
to pay attention to and what to ignore.
Objects of focussed attention are
given namese.g., Mama, milk.
Daddy, toy, bed, etc.and as the
baby grows older he or she repeats
the names, or verbal labels, with
increasing exactness.
Connectives, adjectives, action-
words, and adverbs that the child
hears in the environment of speech
sounds also become part of his or
her verbal repertoire, partly due to
an innate or biological propensity
which the human brain has for making
sense, and partly because the child
wants to share the communicative
network of a family and society.
Most children achieve considerable
facility in understanding and using'
speech before they are ten years old.
A secondary process of literaliza-
tion takes place during this first
decade of living in most societies,
especially those which consider
schools to be essential for the educa¬
tion of children and where high value
is placed on reading and writing.
Unfortunately the acquisition of
literary skills creates conflicts between
the ear and the eye. No sound is
ever heard or spoken in exactly the
same way twice, and during the
years that the child masters language,
he or she also comes to enjoy the
marvellously dynamic and flowing
quality of speech and learns to
depend on the ever-changing nuances
and emotional inflections of the voice.
The speech medium consists of
hisses and buzzes articulated quite
rapidly, in clusters of about five mor¬
phemes per second. To represent
this information nonacoustically with
visual symbols requires an alphabet,
and no alphabet has yet been devised
that accurately and reliably translates
all speech sounds.
Thus school-children are made to
learn a fairly arbitrary system of let¬
ters, so arbitrary in fact that as
George Bernard Shaw pointed out,
the word "fish" could also be spelled
"ghoti" (gh as in laugh, o as in women,
and ti as in nation).
In psychiatry, we see many casual¬
ties of this kind of education. First
of all there are "dyslexic" children
whose brains simply rebel at the
basic notions of written language so
that while they speak perfectly well,
they write in reverse or in typically
disorganized ways, and have trouble
reading.
Another group of children shows
undue concern for verbal disconti¬
nuities (e.g., spaces between words
play a significant role in writing but
don't exist in speech). Some begin
to stammer or stutter over words that
ordinarily pose no problems. Dys-
fluent youngsters are often singled
out for ridicule, punishment, or extra
schoolwork. Finally there are chil¬
dren who withdraw from speech
situations because of a sense of
frustration or the fear of humiliation.
I have tried to set down a few
observations about the role of sound
in human affairs, dividing the acou¬
stical world roughly ¡ntc three com¬
ponents music, and speech.
There is, of course, a considerable
overlap. Thus certain musical com¬
positions when heard for the first
time may seem noisy, and speech
can enter the realm of music through
song.
Electronics has given science the
tools to study acoustical behaviour
directly, by recording sound so it
can be repeated over and over, and
by video-recording the body move¬
ments and facial expressions during
sound-making and silent behaviour.
Much of the knowledge gained from
today's research probably cannot be
preserved in books and journals, as
was done in past centuries, but has
to be transmitted through direct
experience.
I have been impressed in my acti¬
vities as a psychotherapist with the
extraordinary versatility that patients
at all agesnot only children and
adolescentsdisplay in their use and
abuse of sound. Therapeutic com¬
munication consists in many ways of
attempts to clarify meaning and
reduce anxiety through the analysis
of what people say, how they feel
themselves to be in an environment
of social rhythms, and what they do
to each other.
Whether such knowledge will affect
the search for truth and how it can
influence belief is impossible to pre¬
dict, but my hope is that the human
ear will continue to become increa¬
singly sophisticated in perceiving the
warnings of noise, the beauty of
music, and the meaningfulness of
speech.

Culture and a new world economic order
A SPECIAL ISSUE
OF UNESCO'S QUARTERLY CULTURES
An international round table on intellectual and cultural co-operation and
a new world economic order was held in Paris last summer, as we reported
in our last issue. Unesco's quarterly Cultures (*) has just published a special
200-page issue entirely devoted to this event.
Meeting at Unesco headquarters on the initiative of leading international
non-governmental organizations, 34 statesmen, scientists, writers and artists
from all parts of the world set out, under the chairmanship of Mr. Jean
d'Ormesson of the Académie Française, to formulate the cultural conditions,
moral attitudes and political and economic principles that should form the
basis of a new world economic order. In welcoming the participants, the
Director-General of Unesco, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, declared: "Far from
being the expression of self-seeking demands, to strive for a new world order
is to wager boldly and wholeheartedly on man, on his will to survive and
to live a fuller life... Within this context, the efforts undertaken by Unesco, as
by all the other organizations that make up the United Nations system, link
upover and above technical procedureswith the longing for a new huma¬
nism, free from exclusiveness or restriction, in which the explosive truth of the
Dogon proverb that tells us that Man is the grain of the universe would
be revealed."
In its last issue the Unesco Courier presented extracts from contributions
by two of those taking part in the round table, Trygve Bratteli of Norway and
Samir Amin of Egypt. Cultures now publishes the ensemble of the texts
from the round table, presented in five major sections:
The challenge of the 20th century: Philip Noel-Baker (U.K., Nobel laureate),
Alfred Kastler (France, Nobel laureate) and Sean. MacBride (Ireland, Nobel
laureate) outline the major problems of the 20th century: the arms race, the
population explosion, environmental pollution.
Proposals for a new order: Willy Brandt (German Fed. Rep., Nobel laureate),
Trygve Bratteli (Norway) and Samir Amin (Egypt) describe the major economic
and political principles that could serve as models for the creation of a world
order designed to promote more harmonious international relations.
Cultural identity and the new order: Each people's growing awareness of
its cultural identity is a striking feature of the 20th century. Oswaldo
Guayasamin (Ecuador); Joseph Kotsokoane (Lesotho), Prem Kirpal (India) and
Paolo Grassi (Italy) seek to reconcile traditional cultural values with the moder¬
nization of society..
The new order in culture, society and economic life: Nine texts by econo¬
mists, sociologists and scientists describe the many cultural aspects of a new
economic order.
The vision of Man in a new world: Social, economic and cultural changes
confront artists and writers with a new vision of Man. Here, artists, writers,
theatre directors and urbanists trace the major trends in the evolution of
artistic expression in the 20th century.

Letters to the editor
OPEN LETTER FROM
NAPLES SCHOOLCHILDREN
Sir,
In the_ February 1976 issue of the
"Unesco Courier" we read the letter pre¬
sented to the Director-General of Unesco
by 50 children of the primary school at
Etterbeek, near Brussels, when he visited
their school.
We share their ideas and their fears.
And so we want to send the following
letter to these children at Etterbeek:
"We ask the same questions as you:
Why is there social injustice? Why are
there wars? Why- is there economic
disorder and lack of freedom? It is
perhaps because war already exists within
us, in the constant duality of good and
evil which so often leads us to give in
to the worst instincts that degrade human
nature. But we should try to resist this
enemy within us, in order to understand
our neighbours better and help them
to develop all that is best in themselves.
And we should join together in building
a different society where the noblest
ideals become realities in a new order
based on respect for mankind and esteem
for human dignity.

middle school at Vico Equense, are your
friends'. We greet you in the name of all
our classmates."

REBIRTH OF PHILAE
Sir,
After reading your issue dealing with
Philae (November 1974) it was with great
interest and wonder that I, with a group
associated with The Goulburn College of
Advanced Education, Goulburn, New
South Wales, Australia, visited the Philae
monuments as part of a recent Middle
East tour.
We were able to view this spectacular
operation of the salvage of the monu¬
ments. The fact that we were actually
on the coffer dam wall to see the expertise
and technology being used to transfer
and eventually restore these master¬
pieces of architecture is something I
personally will never forget.

RESEARCH DIVORCED
FROM REALITY
Sir.
I recently came across Dragoljub
Najman's article on conservatism in the
world's universities (your June 1975
issue). Mr. Najman's comments are par¬
ticularly relevant to developing countries
like India.
His question "How many of those who
teach in schools of engineering have ever
been in charge of factory workshops or
building sites?" strikes me as distur¬
bingly poignant.
In India, teaching jobs serve merely as
comfortable sinecures for those who
either cannot or do not wish to join
industry. Consequently, research (if
any) being carried out is quite divorced
from reality. Moreover, members of the
teaching faculties are easily lured by
publications in foreign journals. What
they overlook is that Western countries
have reached a stage of technological
development where they can indulge in
research topics which are for us a luxury
we can ill afford.
Politicians' and statesmen's exhorta¬
tions for science geared to. the needs of
society may have become hackneyed
through over-use. But this need is still
of over-riding importance, even though
our university teachers tend not to per¬
ceive it.
I hope the "Unesco Courier" will conti¬
nue to highlight issues of special rele¬
vance to developing countries.

APOSTLE
OF THE INDIANS
Sir,
Congratulations on having published
two articles on Father Bartolomé de Las
Casas, the "Apostle of the Indians"
(June 1975 issue). You did an admirable
job in presenting to a wide public the
most interesting aspects of the life of
this great pioneer in the struggle for
human rights.
The attitude of Bartolomé de Las Ca¬
sas in America before his first conver¬
sion was virtually unknown. Now thanks
to the "Unesco Courier" it has been
described in many languages to readers
all over the world. From this issue
scholars and students can renew and
deepen their understanding of the Indian
and white colonization in America.
Congratulations on all you have
achieved in the "Courier" over the
years helping to raise our cultural level
by teaching us to think and find the
truth.

LEARNING TO COPE
WITH STRESS
Sir,
Dr. Ivan S. Khorol's extremely topical
article about stress ("Unesco Courier"
October 1975) raises questions of con¬
cern to everyone and above all of course
to specialists.
The scientific and technological revo¬
lution, urbanization and the growing
tempo of living are placing increasingly
heavy intellectual and emotional loads
on people. Given these conditions, me¬
thods of reinforcing the nervous system
must be sought.
The problem is a complex one, requir¬
ing the co-ordinated efforts of clinicians,
biochemists, physiologists, pathophysio¬
logists, pharmacologists and sociolo¬
gists' in all countries. It may be neces¬
sary to set up a single centre to
co-ordinate these efforts and research,
perhaps in the form of an International
Stress Institue.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S
CITY OF HUMOUR
Sir,
The article about Gabrovo, Bulgaria's
"capital of humour" and its Scottish
counterpart, Aberdeen, in your issue on
the world of humour (April 1976) was
first rate. We too in Czechoslovakia
have our town of humour: its name is-
Kocourkov.
Although it is a fictitious place, many
books have been written about the
town and its inhabitants, and anecdotes
about the people of Kocourkov have
been told throughout Czechoslovakia
for at least a century. The doings and
quips of its people which amused our
grandparents still set our children
chuckling. ,
This town . where clocks move back¬
wards and the people get up to all sorts
of tricks has figured in books and illu¬
strations and was the subject of a film
made in 1937.
On one occasion the people of Kocour¬
kov welcomed the king with a red carpet.
But it was too short and so as the king
walked along they rolled it ' up behind
him, meaning to lay it out again when he
reached the end. In their haste, how¬
ever, they entangled him in the carpet
and rolled him in the mud. They also
built a town hall but forgot the windows.
So they let people bore holes for win¬
dows wherever they chose, until the build¬
ing looked like a giant Gruyère cheese.
Kocourkov, Czechoslovakia's imaginary
counterpart to Gabrovo, transmits good
humour and optimism and symbolizes
honest self-criticism.

CHILDREN'S CONTEST
FOR UNESCO'S 30 YEARS
Sir.'
A regular reader of the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" for over 20 years, I have recently
been organizing a competition on Unesco
for primary and secondary schoolchildren
in Villepinte. The contest has been
launched as part of our town's cultural
activities programme and is intended to
mark the 30th anniversary of Unesco's
foundation.
Working in pairs, the children will be
asked to compile dossiers on Unesco
and its activities using documentary
material and adding their own descrip¬
tions and commentaries.
The competition opened on 1 October
1976 and the closing date is 31 Decem¬
ber. The winning entry will be pub¬
lished in a booklet which we distribute
quarterly to all our local clubs and asso¬
ciations.

microscope is the hearing organ through which
a mosquito picks up vibrations around it.
