Whether or not in exile, they are far from 
their country of birth. They travel from one 
place to another, by force or by choice. 
They live in one country, think of another. 
They build bonds between opposite worlds. 
They are ‘in-between.’ Their work, too, is 
manifold, universal.

From her Parisian apartment, novelist Spôjmaï 
Zariâb recounts the torment of leaving Afghanistan. 
She was a young, happy girl in Kabul, surrounded by 
books, fascinated by Don Quixote, The Count of 
Monte-Cristo, Father Goriot, and others. Then, the 
Taliban arrived. She fled the bombings with her two 
daughters. Today, she recalls a touching short story 
about exile, written by Rabîndranâth Tagore, which 
she had nearly forgotten: A Man from Kabul. 
As for Michal Govrin, she has always needed a cer-
tain distance to ask the right questions. She left Tel 
Aviv, her native city in Israel, to study in France, and 
then returned to live in Jerusalem. She now lives in 
New Jersey (United-States). She performs theatre in 
her novels, and writes novels when she performs, 
with young Jews or Palestinians, who express their 
own pain through writing or staging plays. 4

At 89, British writer Doris Lessing remains strongly 
attached to the country of her youth, present-day 
Zimbabwe, to which she dedicates a large part of 
her acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Litera-
ture last December. On the occasion, she denounces 
our “fragmenting culture, where our certainties of 
even a few decades ago are questioned and where 
it is common for young men and women, who have 
had years of education, to know nothing of the 
world”. 
Véronique Tadjo, born of an Ivorian father and a 
French mother, lives in South Africa. Before the Ivo-
rian crisis, she was a world traveler. She has since 
been in exile. “Exile begins when it is no longer pos-
sible to return to the country you left behind,” she 
says. She continues to travel between the worlds of 
literature and painting.

Kiran Desai, in turn, did not choose to leave India. 
Her mother, famous writer Anita Desai, brought her 
along at the age of 15, first to England and then to 
the United States. And it is in the New World that 
the young woman felt more Indian than ever before, 
when writing The Inheritance of Loss, for which she 
won the prestigious Booker Prize in 2006. 
And what of Argentine poet María Medrano? Without 
leaving Buenos Aires and her suburb, she builds bridges 
of words longer than that of the Gulf of Hangzhou! 
Once a week for the past five years, she passes over the 
walls of the Ezeiza women’s prison to animate poetry 
workshops. She also organizes translation workshops, 
since the women she works with are from different 
countries and continents. This bridge between inside 
and outside which breaks through linguistic barriers, 
has become a vital space for prisoners. 
So many very different and, in some ways, very simi-
lar destinies. So many women between two shores. 
This issue of the Courier, produced in collabora-
tion with the Division for Gender Equality of the 
Bureau of Strategic Planning of UNESCO, however 
also brings you men’s words. In celebration of 27 
March, World Theatre Day, our Spotlight feature high-
lights the message of one of today’s greatest stage 
directors, the Canadian Robert Lepage. And to cele-
brate World Poetry Day on 21 March, we pay tribute 
to the great Tadjik poet Abu Abdullah Rudaki, who 
was born 1150 years ago! 
In celebration of its 60th anniversary, the Courier

Doris Lessing: Is it so impossible to 
imagine such bare poverty?
Doris Lessing, Nobel Prize in Literature 2007, grew up in today’s Zimbabwe, before 
moving to London in 1949. Greatly attached to the country of her youth, which rejected 
her as undesirable for her anti-apartheid stand, the British novelist devoted a large part 
of her Nobel lecture, “On not winning the Nobel Prize”, to it. Excerpts.
I am standing in a doorway looking through clouds 
of blowing dust to where I am told there is still uncut 
forest. Yesterday I drove through miles of stumps, 
and charred remains of fires where, in ‘56, there was 
the most wonderful forest I have ever seen, all now 
destroyed. People have to eat. They have to get fuel 
for fires. 
This is north-west Zimbabwe in the early eighties, 
and I am visiting a friend who was a teacher in a 
school in London. He is here “to help Africa,” as we 
put it. He is a gently idealistic soul and what he 
found in this school shocked him into a depression, 
from which it was hard to recover. This school is like 
every other built after Independence. It consists of 
four large brick rooms side by side, put straight into 
the dust, one two three four, with a half room at one

end, which is the library. In these classrooms are 
blackboards, but my friend keeps the chalks in his 
pocket, as otherwise they would be stolen. There is 
no atlas or globe in the school, no textbooks, no 
exercise books, or biros. In the library there are no 
books of the kind the pupils would like to read, but 
only tomes from American universities, hard even to 
lift, rejects from white libraries, or novels with titles 
like Weekend in Paris and Felicity Finds Love. […] 
As I sit with my friend in his room, people drop in 
shyly, and everyone begs for books. “Please send us 
books when you get back to London,” one man says. 
“They taught us to read but we have no books.” Eve-
rybody I met, everyone, begged for books.
I do not think many of the pupils 
of this school will get prizes
I was there some days. The dust blew. The pumps had 
broken and the women were having to fetch water 
from the river. Another idealistic teacher from Eng-
land was rather ill after seeing what this “school” 
was like. 
On the last day they slaughtered the goat. They 
cut it into bits and cooked it in a great tin. This was 
the much anticipated end-of-term feast: boiled goat 
and porridge. I drove away while it was still going 
on, back through the charred remains and stumps of 
the forest. 
I do not think many of the pupils of this school 
will get prizes. 
The next day I am to give a talk at a school in 
North London, a very good school, whose name we 
all know. It is a school for boys, with beautiful build-
ings and gardens. 4

These children here have a visit from some well 
known person every week, and it is in the nature of 
things that these may be fathers, relatives, even 
mothers of the pupils. A visit from a celebrity is not 
unusual for them. 
As I talk to them, the school in the blowing dust 
of north-west Zimbabwe is in my mind, and I look at 
the mildly expectant English faces in front of me and 
try to tell them about what I have seen in the last 
week. […] I am sure that anyone who has ever given 
a speech will know that moment when the faces you 
are looking at are blank. Your listeners cannot hear 
what you are saying, there are no images in their 
minds to match what you are telling them – in this 
case the story of a school standing in dust clouds, 
where water is short, and where the end of term treat 
is a just-killed goat cooked in a great pot. 
Is it really so impossible for these privileged stu-
dents to imagine such bare poverty? 
I do my best. They are polite. 
I’m sure that some of them will one day win 
prizes. 
Then, the talk is over. Afterwards I ask the teach-
ers how the library is, and if the pupils read. In this 
privileged school, I hear what I always hear when I 
go to such schools and even universities. 
“You know how it is,” one of the teacher’s says. “A 
lot of the boys have never read at all, and the library 
is only half used.” 
Yes, indeed we do know how it is. All of us. 
We are in a fragmenting culture, where our cer-
tainties of even a few decades ago are questioned 
and where it is common for young men and women, 
who have had years of education, to know nothing of 
the world, to have read nothing, knowing only some 
speciality or other, for instance, computers. […]
We are good for irony and cynicism
We are a jaded lot, we in our threatened world. We 
are good for irony and even cynicism. Some words 
and ideas we hardly use, so worn out have they 
become. But we may want to restore some words that 
have lost their potency. 
We have a treasure-house of literature, going back 
to the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans. It is all 
there, this wealth of literature, to be discovered 
again and again by whoever is lucky enough to come 
upon it. A treasure. Suppose it did not exist. How 
impoverished, how empty we would be. 
We own a legacy of languages, poems, histories, 
and it is not one that will ever be exhausted. It is 
there, always. 
We have a bequest of stories, tales from the old 
storytellers, some of whose names we know, but some 
not. The storytellers go back and back, to a clearing 
in the forest where a great fire burns, and the old 
shamans dance and sing, for our heritage of stories 
began in fire, magic, the spirit world. And that is 
where it is held, today. 
Ask any modern storyteller and they will say there 
is always a moment when they are touched with fire, 
with what we like to call inspiration, and this goes 
back and back to the beginning of our race, to the 
great winds that shaped us and our world.

Doris Lessing, Nobel Prize in Literature 2007
The storyteller is deep inside every one of us. The 
story-maker is always with us. Let us suppose our 
world is ravaged by war, by the horrors that we all of 
us easily imagine. Let us suppose floods wash through 
our cities, the seas rise. But the storyteller will be 
there, for it is our imaginations which shape us, keep 
us, create us -for good and for ill. It is our stories 
that will recreate us, when we are torn, hurt, even 
destroyed. It is the storyteller, the dream-maker, the 
myth-maker, that is our phoenix, that represents us 
at our best, and at our most creative.

Exile begins when you can no longer return 
to the country you left behind, says poet, 
writer, and painter Véronique Tadjo, laureate 
of the Grand Prix Littéraire d’Afrique Noire 
2005. Born in 1955 in Paris and raised in 
Abidjan, she now lives in South Africa after 
having traveled throughout the world.
Interview by Bernard Magnier, French journalist 
and specialist in African literature.

ments gleaned here and there, much like a collector 
bringing back souvenirs from her trips. 
I have traveled extensively since birth. I married 
a journalist, and continued traveling: England, 
Mexico, Nigeria, Kenya, and today, South Africa. 
My first book of poems, Latérite (Hatier, 1997), 
was born from crossing the desert after I left Paris 
having completed my studies. I was homesick. I told 
myself that it would be good to travel slowly, to 
return to the Côte d’Ivoire by land and discover the 
desert I was dreaming of. Rather than taking pic-
tures, I began to write in order to capture my experi-
ences. This is the voyage that truly triggered my 
desire to write.
Are you sensitive to your immediate environment 
when you write?
Absolutely. When you live with people, you end up 
integrating their hopes and problems. You would like 
to know them better, to better understand them. I 
do not like to lock myself up to write. I want to be 
able to participate in daily life, share, communicate 
and exchange ideas. 
Sometimes I tell myself that, had I not lived in 
Kenya, I would probably not have been as sensitive 
to the Rwandan genocide. There were so many Rwan-
dan refugees in Nairobi, and the newspapers fre-
quently covered the topic while I lived there. Writing 
The Shadow of Imana (Actes Sud, 2000), the book 
that enabled me to exorcise Rwanda, was thus a logi-
cal outcome. 
It has been a long time since you lived in Côte 
d’Ivoire. How do you experience the Ivorian crisis? 
For a long time, I traveled, my mind and heart at 
peace, telling myself that I could return home when 
I wanted to. Things changed with the Ivorian crisis. 
I had the impression the door suddenly closed and 
left me outside. I found it difficult to understand 
what was happening, how we got there. I felt alien-
ated, as if everything had to be started all over 
again. 
I believe that exile begins when you can no longer 
return to the country you left behind, when the way 
back becomes painful. But somehow, I think that 
many Ivorians felt the same thing. This idea that the 
change was irremediable. The feeling that nothing 
will ever be the same. 
Numerous writers throughout the world live in exile. 
Do you think that being in exile is beneficial for 
writing? 
There is desired exile and forced exile. When we are 
in exile but are serene, we may be in a ‘comfortable’ 
position. In fact, distance can help put things into 
perspective, take a few steps back. We have the pos-
sibility of removing ourselves from the daily grind 
and to keep our head above water. We can adopt the 
position of an observer, a luxury that is beyond the 
reach of those who permanently live in the thick of 
the action.

However, exile can only be serene if we can return 
to our country regularly. Otherwise, we end up living 
off blurry memories which becomes an uncomfortable 
situation. The country is then more a myth than a 
reality. 
I see no advantage in living in a sad exile because 
it is painful. Although it may drive one to write, it 
may also lead to great despair. As the memory of 
little things fades, self-awareness falls apart. And we 
are left with a difficult choice: forget our previous 
life and adopt a new one or live as if we were skinned 
alive.
Since the publication of your first book, the place 
of women in the African literary landscape has con-
siderably evolved. What do you make of this 
evolution?
Women make their voices heard and demonstrate a 
remarkable—and logical—dynamism in writing. It 
has taken many generations to allow them to have 
access to education. It has also taken many genera-
tions to allow them to speak up in societies where 
their voices were not encouraged. With women’s 
entry into the workforce and into the political arena, 
mentalities have finally evolved. Today, the young 
generation benefits from a greater open-mindedness 
and an enhanced mobility. 
It is regrettable, however, that living in Europe 
remains a rite of passage for those wishing to make a 
name for themselves that transcends the borders of 
their country of origin. This is due, in part, to the 
continent’s lack of editorial infrastructure. 
I also worry about globalization, which absorbs 
all forms of writing to better commercialize them. It 
would be interesting to see where women’s literature 
is heading in the long term. What are its trends? In 
what ways are women’s discourses different from 
those of their male predecessors? Somewhat like in 
politics. 
What is the state of youth literature? How do you 
see the evolution of its production in the last few 
years? 
Youth literature is, in my opinion, the missing link. 
We cannot have a thriving literature able to reach its 
public if young people haven’t been taught to enjoy 
books and reading. Thankfully, things are evolving 
quite well. African editors have understood that 
there is a promising market for this type of litera-
ture, as youth under the age of 15 represents nearly 
half of the African population. 
The themes and illustrations of books for youth 
are more and more varied. This is a good thing, 
because we have to encourage young people to 
develop their imagination.

### 158590: Spôjmaï Zariâb: the man from Kabul

Spôjmaï Zariâb was ten years old when 
the compulsory veil was abolished in 
Afghanistan in 1959. The future novelist 
led a happy life in Kabul, surrounded by 
books. Then, the Taliban seized power. In 
1990, she took refuge in France with her 
two daughters.
You ask me what exile is… 
Years ago, in a quiet corner of Kabul, I read the 
Persian translation of The Man from Kabu, a short 
story by Rabîndranâth Tagore. 
With his magical words, this talented Indian writer 
made me discover the pain of exile… but it was an 
economic exile: an Afghan flees misery, leaving his 
wife and eight-year old daughter behind, and gets 
lost in the vastness of India in search of work. 
His path crosses that of a little girl. She reminds 
him of his own daughter and he feels great affection 
for her. Nostalgia and memories often compel him to 
visit her, his pockets full of candy and small change. 
But exile’s meanders and to life’s surprises ends 
up leading him to jail, where he spends 15 years. 
Once he regains his freedom, his heart beating 
and his pockets full of candy and small change, he 
heads off in the hope of finding the little Hindu girl 
he once knew. Arriving at her doorstep, he is sur-
prised by the crowd’s uproar and the hubbub of the 
music. Dazzled by spangles and lights, he looks for 
the girl and is brought before the bride. 
Gaping, he ponders over the tyranny of time, and 
thinks of his own daughter who, in his absence, has

also become a woman. He thinks of her childhood, 
stolen from him, and of his fatherhood forever lost.
This short story shattered me, but I was young at 
the time and did not know what poverty was. I had 
no concerns other than to accompany Don Quixote in 
his adventures, share Renée’s melancholy, and laugh 
with Molière, discover the enamoured Madame de 
Raynal, sit by the lake with Lamartine and by the 
peaceful Don river with Cholokhov, share the pains of 
the old Goriot, follow the Count of Monte-Cristo’s 
ploys for revenge, cry with Fantine and Cosette, scru-
tinize the noble words of Tolstoï, shed tears upon 
Werther’s death… Haunted by Dostoïevski, I would 
visit his house of the dead, change into an insect 
with Kafka, and wander behind the walls of his castle, 
listen to the works of Sartre and hear Hemingway’s 
bell toll, search for things passed with Proust, admire 
Kazantzakis’ Christ re-crucified, and experience hun-
dred years of solitude of Garcia Marquez, all the while 
forgetting the man from Kabul and his suffering in 
exile. 
I, who was sheltered from misery and who had 
only known war in books, saw myself also sheltered 
from exile… until the end of my days. 
At the time, I ignored that one day, alas, history’s 
unfair hand would turn every Afghan into the man 
from Kabul by Tagore. That history’s folly would 
divide an entire nation and disperse the Afghans to 
all four corners of the world, far from their fathers, 
mothers, children, sisters and brothers. 
Around me, I do not know of a single family that 
was spared the torment of exile, and that, although 
without having read Tagore, did not live the story of 
the man from Kabul and did not feel his pain within.
You ask me what I am thinking of… 
What could I be thinking of when I see developing 
countries, still struggling to free themselves from 
the claws of misery, fall victim to the devastation of 
war? What could I be thinking of when I hear poor 
people being condemned for knocking on distant 
doors to save themselves? What could I be thinking 
of when I see that, throughout the centuries, neither 
religion, philosophy, literature, art, science or tech-
nology have been able to appease the hunger in the 
World’s belly and to find a remedy for the insanity we 
call ‘war’? 
Why have they not appeased it…? Why have they 
not found it…? 
This time, I am asking you. 
Do you have an answer…?

### 158591: Michal Govrin: the curse of wandering

Today you are living between Jerusalem and New 
Jersey. How does this experience “between two 
shores” shape you? 
Living “in between” is another description of my way 
of being a writer, of having all at once a close and a 
remote vantage point on myself and the world. 
Since childhood I was convinced that the only way 
to “really live” would be to become a writer. But this 
dream crumbled, because all of my admired models 
wrote about far away places where fascinating child-
hoods take place, whereas I had no choice but to 
write about a boring childhood with two elderly par-
ents (both married again after having had previous 
living or dead families, about which I knew almost 
nothing) in a third floor apartment of a new housing 
project in Tel Aviv. 
The only way out was to flee. So for my PhD I 
decided to leave for Paris. It was a way to confront 
myself, to ask questions, from a distance. In a cen-
tury of exile and migration, I was not the only one 
experiencing this situation: that of starting to cher-
ish my own story far from home. I became an alien, a 
minority, an exile, akin to the Parisian street-corner 
hobos. In Paris for the first time I felt what it meant 
to be the other. 
When I came back to Israel I was no longer the 
same. I left Tel Aviv and settled in Jerusalem. Yet I 
feel the tension that exists between the two cities 
like a tug between the sacred and the profane. 
Since, my family life has taken me from my home 
in Jerusalem to Paris or New Jersey for periodical 
stays. Living in between became my writer’s exile, a 
constant mode of putting into question, of facing 
new challenges. 
Ilana Tsouriel, the heroine of your novel snapshots 
is, like you the daughter of one of the State of Isra-
el’s founding fathers. She maintains she is hit by 
the “curse of wandering”. What does this represent 
for you? 
Ilana uses this term ironically to describe her cosmo-
politan life as an echo to the Zionist criticism of the 
Jewish Diaspora, and to the dream of “saving” the 
Jews from a destiny of Exile and wandering, by 
returning to the Promised Land and a new independ-
ent State. Ilana leaves Israel pained by the violence 
of the nation building process, and the conflict it

engendered. But as she matures as an architect, she 
tries to escape these rigid contradictions. In her 
Monument for Peace project for Jerusalem, the epi-
center of the conflict, she draws on Jewish tradi-
tional concepts that introduce a dimension of 
wandering and renouncing as another way of life in a 
place (the Sabbatical Year, the Sukkah Hut).
Your mother survived the holocaust. To what extent 
did this influence your way of being and your work?
My mother, a strong woman full of life, never spoke to 
me about what she had gone through. As soon as she 
arrived in Israel in 1948 she had the number tattooed 
on her when she entered Auschwitz removed through 
plastic surgery. Therefore, as a child, I did not know, 
“that my mother had been in the holocaust”, neither 
did I know why her son, whose pictures were hidden 
in her lingerie drawer I would secretly open, was not 
alive. The long and complex process of discovery 
started for me at adolescence. It kept changing with 
every stage of life and with the extreme period we 
are going through. It is an open question with which 
I live, and a commitment I uphold, loyal to my moth-
er’s ethics, that of being a “Mensch” (real human 
being). For me this is the only real lesson to be drawn 
in the face of the abyss of humanity. Most of my writ-
ings, whether novels, poems or essays, attempt, again 
and again, to put this unique and extreme experience 
and duty, into words. 
Ilana’s love for the Palestinian Sayyid fills her with 
a feeling of betrayal to her father. What can you 
say about this feeling? 
Ilana and Sayyid’s affair unravel the passionate – even 
erotic - dimension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
A conflict that is rooted in the Abrahamic Religions 
based on a passionate rivalry and mutual exclusive-
ness between brothers. The consequences of the polit-
ical conflict are tragic because loyalty to one story is 
simply perceived as the inevitable betrayal of the 
other. Ilana, a dedicated member of the Peace camp, 
believes she can go beyond this boundary, even if she 
betrays her father’s Zionist commitment. But as the 
novel unfolds, and she reads more from her father’s 
legacy, she understands that his own dream of Peace 
was not so far from hers, whereas during the Gulf war 
and the Intifada, she feels betrayed by Sayyid and the 
members of the Palestinian theater company who 
slowly turn their backs on their collaboration. 
Where does betrayal end, where does loyalty 
begin? What is betrayal and what is loyalty? - is a 
major question that Snapshots raises from the per-
sonal, erotic and political point of view, all the while 
also asking whether betraying rigid convictions is 
not in fact the same as true loyalty. This is a ques-
tion that a woman may well be in a position to put 
forth in the most poignant way– since she rarely has 
the right to do so, since women are rarely able to 
decide on their own existence and bodies.
You teach at the School of Visual Theatre in Jerusa-
lem. As a novelist, what is your relationship to 
theatre?
Sometimes, like an actor, I “improvise”, lead the text 
to unknown places, hidden even from me, only to 
hunt down and touch the unsaid. Often I use the 
monologue, to capture the subtleties and fluctua-
tions of the living voice, of the fleeting moment. 
And then, through rhythm, respiration, body expres-
sion, I “draw in” the reader to “perform” this mono-
logue, to experience it as powerfully as an actor who 
is carried by the role he plays.

As a teacher of young directors in Israel, with 
students from backgrounds as different, even 
opposed, as this region provides, I have worked both 
with Jewish students expressing through Chekhov 
their pain after the settlements were uprooted in the 
Gaza Strip, and with Palestinian students also trying 
to transmit their pain through writing and directing 
actors. My approach has always been the same: to 
develop the young artists’ unique talent and mission, 
along with a fundamental commitment to the art of 
the theater, that is to say, a sincere and unbiased 
commitment - beyond all else – to the human dimen-
sion of theater, to humanism.

With The Inheritance of Loss, Kiran 
Desai has become the youngest female 
laureate of the booker Prize (200). 
In her book she talks about exile, 
globalization and belonging to two 
cultures. born in New Delhi in , she 
left India in 8 with her mother, the 
author Anita Desai, to live in england 
and then the United states.
For Kiran Desai, life has been a heady whirl of travel 
and adulation since October 2006, when her second 
book, The Inheritance of Loss (Atlantic Monthly Press, 
2005) won her the coveted Man Booker Prize. The shy 
and unassuming 36-year old who hails from India, 
but has spent more than half her life in the United 
States, is today one of the most sought-after new 
voices on the international literary circuit.

### 158593: Kiran Desai: a life between East and West

laughingly describes her recent life as “living in car-
toon form,” where she hops from place to place. 
Desai’s new life is in stark contrast to the nearly 
eight years she spent toiling on the book that won 
her fame. “It was a long, long journey for me,” she 
admits. “I was devastated and sad at the end of it.” 
The often lonely process of writing was actually a 
happy one for her, she insists. Running out money 
after she spent her publisher’s advance and being too 
poor to afford health insurance or a place to call her 
own was not easy. 
“I was quite stern and mean-spirited while writ-
ing the book, fearful of the risk I was taking,” she 
explains. She hopes winning the Booker will change 
that, allowing her to be “more eccentric” and to “play 
more” when she writes again.
Immigration is a great con game
But the hardest part about writing was coming to 
terms with her own identity, as someone who had 
been born in one country and resided in another. The 
daughter of renowned Indian author Anita Desai, 
Kiran Desai was born in India in 1971 and immigrated 
to the United States via Great Britain when she 
was 15. 
She thought she had “migrated in quite a simple 
way at first”, until she started writing the book and 
confronting “what it means to live between east and 
west.” 
The process led her to examine her own family’s 
history of migration and exile – Desai’s maternal 
grandmother was German and never returned home 
after moving to India before World War II; her grand-
father was a refugee from Bangladesh. Her father’s 
father hailed from a small village in the western 
Indian state of Gujarat, went to England to study, 
and returned to work for the Indian Civil Service. “My 
leaving India was no accident. There were certain 
moves made long ago that ensured that I would 
leave.” 
“I think immigration is a great con game; you tell 
yourself lies, you reinvent yourself in many different 
ways, and to undo all of that took a long time,” she 
said in an interview with CNN. 
At first, Desai imagined that as time went by, 
she would feel more American than Indian, but she 
holds onto her Indian passport. “People are con-
stantly asking me where home is, and after writing 
the book, I have less of an answer than ever before,” 
she said. 
“Literature is located beyond flags and anthems, 
simple ideas of loyalty,” she feels. But working on 
the book led her back to India in many different 
ways. She felt “much more Indian” after writing 
the book than she had before. “Being part of the 
Indian diaspora gives one a precise emotional loca-
tion to work from, if not a precise geographical 
one. This book was a return journey to the fact of 
being Indian, to realizing the perspective was too 
important to give up. America might give me half a 
narrative, but I had to return to India for the other 
half of the story, for emotional depth, historical 
depth.” 
“The book is movingly strong in its humanity… a 
magnificent novel of humane breadth and wisdom, 
comic tenderness and powerful political acuteness,” 
observed the writer Hermione Lee, who headed the 
team of judges awarding the Booker to Desai, making 
her the youngest woman to win the award in its 40-
year history.

### 158593: Kiran Desai: a life between East and West

My mother opens a magic space 
to me
While Desai is quick to acknowledge the influence of 
writers including V.S. Naipaul, R.K.Narayan, Salman 
Rushdie, Chinua Achebe, Naguib Mahfouz, Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, 
Kenzaburo Oe, Kazuo Ichiguro, and Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez, it is her mother who has had the most pro-
found influence on her writing. “To my mother I owe 
a debt so profound and so great that this book feels 
as much hers as it does mine,” Kiran Desai said, as 
she accepted the prize which her mother has been 
nominated for three times, but never won. 
The mother-daughter relationship, explains Desai, 
goes much deeper than just editing manuscripts. 
“When I walk into her home (Desai lives about an 
hour’s drive away from her mother) it is almost as if 
another dimension opens up, a magic space in which 
I can work and think like nowhere else,” she explains. 
“It is the peace of it, the stillness of the light, the 
flavour of exile that seems essential to writing, the 
fact that everything seems to bend to the fact of it 
being a writer’s home. It’s the rhythm of a writing 
life that comes from 50 years of working, and from 
that older time of being a writer in India when you 
wrote for writing’s sake alone, not for the cocktail 
samosas.” 
In the not-too-distant future, Desai hopes to 
escape the limelight and spend some time with her 
mother in Mexico, where they will both write and she 
will start her new book. Like her mother, Kiran Desai 
does not feel comfortable discussing her work before 
she finishes writing it. But her third book will likely 
be set in “a mish-mash of locations for the sake of 
being able to explore the truth and lies that exist 
between places,” she reveals. 
Desai will also stray far from fiction to contribute 
to “AIDS Sutra: The Hidden Story of AIDS in India,” a 
collection of first-hand accounts by well-known writ-
ers based on encounters with a wide variety of people 
affected by AIDS in India. To be published by Random 
House India in May, the book is funded by the Bill 
and Melinda Gates Foundation, and aims to promote 
a public dialogue about the disease in India and 
abroad.

### 158596: María Medrano: inside-outside

Sunglasses propped on her head, a white iron mega-
phone in hand, she begins the day by uttering: 
“Friendship is a sacred name, a sacred thing. It exists 
only between good people […] There can be no 
friendship where cruelty, disloyalty and injustice pre-
vail.” Silvia Elena Machado reads aloud one of the 
posters an independent publisher Superabundans Haut 
stuck on the pink walls of the function room in Unit 
31 of the Ezeiza women’s prison, located in the sub-
urbs of Buenos Aires. 
Every Friday for the past five years, this room 
hosts a poetry workshop bringing together ten to 
fifteen inmates. Today, [December 7, 2007], is a day 
of celebration because it marks the second edition of 
the annual poetry festival entitled “I Didn’t Do It.” 
A crowd of people follow Silvia Elena across the 
room. She continues reading the Discourse of Volun-
tary Servitude, by French writer Étienne de La Boétie: 
“Between mean people […] there is no love, only 
fear. They are not friends, but accomplices.” The 
megaphone is passed from hand to hand, and after 
Silvia Elena, who has returned to the prison for the 
first time after having been freed ten months ago, it 
is the turn of Laura Ross, an inmate without a fore-
seen date of release: “Decide to stop being 
servile...” 
Other convicts, other voices, read with difficulty, 
timidly, encouraged by small pats on their backs from 
fellow prisoners. Applause resounds. Outside the sun 
is shining but the prison guards are not authorized 
to open the door that gives onto the small 
courtyard.
I Didn’t Do It
“I Didn’t Do It” is Bart Simpson’s favorite expression 
[Bart is the 10 year old boy who is one of The 
Simpsons main characters], which the workshop par-
ticipants selected two years ago to baptize their first 
festival. They also gave this title to their first anthol-
ogy of poems. In the anthology, María Medrano, the 
poet who, once a week, with fellow Claudia Prado, 
enters Ezeiza prison with a cartload of books, writes 
maría medrano: Inside - outside
Once a week, for the past five years, Argentine poet María Medrano gets behind the bars 
of a women’s prison near Buenos Aires to animate a poetry workshop. In so doing, she 
builds a bridge between “inside” and “outside”, which has become a vital space for the 
prisoners of different nationalities.

### 158596: María Medrano: inside-outside

“Most women who participate in 
the workshop had never had any 
contact with this literary genre. 
Some of them decided to sign up 
to ‘kill time’, others, to see what it 
was all about. But what is certain 
is that, bit by bit, the workshop 
has become a vital space [...] They 
did not want to write ‘tumbera’ 
poetry [note: tumbera is the term 
used to designate what belongs to 
the prison world in Argentina ; la 
tumba (tomb) means jail], because 
for them, this language is part of 
the depersonalization process of 
which they are victims: when you 
enter prison, you stop being a person and become a 
‘package’ (this is what the guards call the inmates), 
you receive a new first name, a new surname ‘tum-
bero’, and little by little, daily language becomes 
prison language.” 
Here, poetry becomes a space of resistance, even if 
the penitentiary system considers it part of the “non-
productive”, cultural workshops, meaning that they do 
not generate any revenues as opposed to the bread- or 
stuffed-animal-making workshops (prisoners who par-
ticipate in these receive a small salary which they can 
spend themselves or send to their families). 
Two years ago, when she read her texts at the first 
festival, Liz, a young Black woman with small braids 
cascading down her forehead, was pregnant. Today, 
she sees her son, Jehová, running among the male 
and female poets, journalists and visitors who have 
come in from the outside, while she awaits her turn 
to share her writings. She says: “I will read something 
I really like, and hope you will also like it… ‘I love 
him like the cancer that eats into my flesh.’”
Breaking the walls of language 
as well
A young, blond woman, whose pregnancy is already 
far along, asks a photographer who has come to 
attend the festival to take her picture: she wants to 
send it to her fiancé who is outside and cannot 
always visit her. She also wants to take advantage of 
the presence of a digital camera to 
see herself because there are no 
mirrors in the jail. 
Through the windows up high we 
can see airplanes: the airport is 
only a few kilometers away, which 
is also the reason why this unit 
receives women accused of traffick-
ing narcotics. They are “mules”, 
people who transit towards other 
countries, who were caught by cus-
toms officers with drugs in their 
luggage. A number of these women 
are foreigners. They did not under-
stand the details of their sentence. 
It is only in prison that they learned Spanish. 
In this little Babel, however, they have found a 
way to partake in the poetry workshop. Around one of 
the six meeting tables, we hear Polish, German, and 
Romanian words. One day, María Medrano came to the 
workshop with poems written in these women’s 
mother tongues. The prisoners of the workshop had 
the idea of bringing these texts to the festival, of 
reading them in their original version and translating 
them to share them with fellow inmates and visitors. 
Carmen, a blond Romanian woman of 52 with a 
proud and soft voice, remembers that she had cried 
that day: “Then, I began to translate the text so that 
others could understand what it says. And today, I 
wanted to sing it, but I was so moved that I did not 
dare.” It is not the fear of 
speaking in public that 
discouraged her, but rather 
the memory of her mother, 
who had passed away in 
Romania the week before. 
In February, Carmen 
will be extradited, which 
is the usual route for 
women accused of traf-
ficking narcotics.

### 158597: Theatre has to reinvent itself

There are a number of hypotheses on the origins of 
theatre but the one I find the most thought-provok-
ing takes the form of a fable: 
One night, at the dawn of time, a group of men 
were gathered together in a quarry to warm them-
selves around a fire and tell stories. All of a sudden, 
one of them had the idea to stand up and use his 
shadow to illustrate his tale. Using the light from the 
flames, he made characters appear, larger than life, 
on the walls of the quarry. Amazed, the others recog-
nized in turn the strong and the weak, the oppressor 
and the oppressed, the god and the mortal. 
Nowadays, the light of projectors has replaced the 
original bonfire, and stage machinery, the walls of 
the quarry. And with all due deference to certain 
purists, this fable reminds us that technology is at 
the very beginnings of theatre and that it should not 
be perceived as a threat but as a uniting element. 
The survival of the art of theatre depends on its 
capacity to reinvent itself by embracing new tools 
and new languages. For how could the theatre con-
tinue to bear witness to the great issues of its epoch 
and promote understanding between peoples without 
having, itself, a spirit of openness? How could it 
pride itself on offering solutions to the problems of 
intolerance, exclusion and racism if, in its own prac-
tice, it resisted any fusion and integration? 
In order to represent the world in all its complex-
ity, the artist must bring forth new forms and ideas, 
and trust in the intelligence of the spectator, who is 
capable of distinguishing the silhouette of humanity 
within this perpetual play of light and shadow. 
It is true that by playing too much with fire, we 
take a risk, but we also take a chance: we might get 
burned, but we might also amaze and enlighten.

### 158598: Rudaki: the Sultan of poets

The man whose name means “small stream” in Per-
sian Dari, Rudaki, was born in 858 near Panjakent, 
200 km north of Duchanbe, Tajikistan’s capital. At 
the age of eight, he recited the Qur’an by heart. 
Later, his fame as a fine poet, brilliant musician and 
singer having reached Bukhara (today in Uzbekistan), 
he was invited to the court as official poet. He spent 
a large part of his life in the service of the Samanid 
dynasty (875-999). 
Capital of the Arab Caliphate’s first great inde-
pendent State, Bukhara was considered the centre of 
Tajik culture. The Samanids encouraged the develop-
ment of the sciences, architecture and poetry writ-
ten in Persian. The population was known for its level 
of instruction, Islam having contributed to a wide 
distribution of sacred texts. According to the Persian 
philosopher, writer and doctor, Avicenna, the Bukhara 
library possessed “books of which numerous people 
even ignored the existence”.
The poet of inaccessible 
simplicity
A link between two epochs, Rudaki succeeded in 
merging the Pre-Islamic musical and poetic tradi-
tions, Iranian Tajik song and radically new forms of 
Arabic verse into his art. Rudaki wrote in new Persian 
(Dari). The Persian having existed until then had to 
adopt, after the Arab conquest of Central Asia and 
the spread of Islam, Arabic writing. 
The verses of the « Sultan of Poets », as he was 
called, are imbued with his faith in human reason, in 
the wisdom of experience, the will to master knowl-
edge, and the doing of good and justice. The terse-
ness, the simplicity of his poetic expression gave 
birth to a new literary style, known as the Horasa-
nian or Rudaki style, which dominated Persian poetry 
during several centuries. Still during the Middle Ages, 
scholars would qualify the style of the poet as “sakhle 
moumtans” (inaccessible simplicity). 
Celebrating nature, man, his noble feelings and 
his ideals, he broached questions of philosophy and 
ethics, attempting to improve the mores of his time 
Landmarks
rudaki, the sultan of Poets
« Since the world rose from darkness, no one yet, on Earth, has regretted to have 
devoted his life to study », wrote Abu Abdullah Rudaki (858-941), rightly considered 
the founder of Tajik Persian literature. 
Supported by Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Kazakhstan, Tajikistan 
submitted a proposal to UNESCO for the celebration of Rudaki’s 1150th anniversary.

by the power of the poetic verb. He was the first, in 
Persian poetry, not only to contemplate man but also 
to place him at the centre of his art: ordinary man, 
man on earth, “earthly” man who thinks simply and 
clearly. 
Rudaki excelled in different poetic genres: rubai, 
ghazal, qasida, kitia, masnavi and other gallant lyri-
cal poems. But of his entire work, only the qasida, 
The Mother of Wine, and some forty roubais (quat-
rains) remain. The rest is made of panegyric, lyric 
and didactic fragments of works, such as the poem 
Kalila and Dimna and five other texts. 
After having served more than 40 years at the 
Samanid court, the poet fell out of favour, towards the 
end of his life, because of his sympathies for a rebel-
lious people, the Qarmates. And because he is known 
to have died a blind man, some believe that his eyes 
had been pierced before he was banished from the 
court. He spent the rest of his life in poverty. He died 
in 941 in Panjrud, the village of his birth.

short history
Established by the United Nations in 1977, “International Women’s Day” owes its origins 
to the protests of women, particularly in Europe, who demanded, at the beginning of the 
20th century, the right to vote, improved working conditions and gender equality. 
19 March, the last Sunday of February, 15 April and 23 February are among the key 
dates for International Women’s Day. 
But where then did the 8th of March come from?
1910: in Copenhagen (Denmark), hundreds of partici-
pants gather at the Second International Conference 
of Socialist Women (the first having been held in 
1907) and decide to organize an annual day for 
women to bolster their efforts to achieve voting 
rights. 
1911: a day for women is celebrated in a number 
of European countries and in the United States. But 
this celebration occurs on 19 March, in commemora-
tion of the revolution of 1848 and of the “Commune 
de Paris”. 
1913: Russian women celebrate their first Interna-
tional Women’s Day on the last Sunday of February, 
by organizing clandestine gatherings. 
1915: As the First World War rages, a huge gather-
ing of women is held in The Hague (Netherlands) on 
15 April. Participants include over 1 300 women from 
over 12 countries. 
In 1917: Women labourers take to the streets and 
declare a general strike announcing the Russian Rev-
olution. The date was 23 February. 4

After World War II, 8 March begins to be cele-
brated in a number of countries, before being 
 recognized by the UN as International Women’s Day 
in 1977. 
19 March, the last Sunday of February, 15 April, 
23 February are among the key dates for Interna-
tional Women’s Day. But where, then, did the 8th of 
March come from? 
Ask Julius Cesar and Gregory XIII! 
Before the Revolution, Russia had not yet adopted 
the Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory 
XIII in 1582 to mitigate the errors of the Julian cal-
endar, which owes its name to the Roman emperor 
who had chosen it 46 years before the birth of Jesus 
Christ. The Gregorian calendar is used today in the 
large majority of countries. 
In 1917, 23 February in Russia thus corresponded 
to 8 March in the other European countries. It’s as 
simple as that!
