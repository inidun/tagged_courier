Nipponese noblewoman
Heavy earrings, hair held by a comb and coiled in a chignon, a
necklace of pearls and an elegant dress adorn this Japanese noble¬¨
woman whose tomb figure (detail below) was sculpted by a 5th
century "haniwa" craftsman. Haniwa, reddish brown unglazed pot¬¨
tery, were originally simple cylinders used to fence off the cemetery
mounds of ancient Japan, vestiges of which are still found in some
parts of the country. Later, the tops of the cylinders were decorated
with human figures, animals and objects. The tomb "portrait" of
this Nipponese noblewoman is one of the relatively few haniwa
that depict a full human figure. Unearthed at Yagi, north west of
Tokyo, the figure is 90 cm high.

The hectic pace of modern life subjects the
human organism to incessant tensions and
stress that overload and wear down its powers
of resistance. What harmful effects are caus¬¨
ed by stress? What are the limits of the body's
ability to adapt to the growing pressures of
everyday life ? Scientists are today studying
the nature of stress to find the answers . to
these and many related questions (see article

Any sudden break in the
rhythm of daily life produces
stress, often thought of as a
typical 20th-century ailment.
"Sound pollution" the noise
of pneumatic drills, traffic,
aircraft, etc. is only one of
many modern pressures which
inflict strain on the organism,
adding to the tensions which
have always been an inescapable
part of human life.

### Stress: the wear and tear of modern life
¬ß7¬ø?¬£SS
by Ivan S. Khorol
The wear
and tear
of modern life
IVAN SEMYONOVICH KHOROL, Soviet
physician, has devoted many years' research
to the problems of mental fatigue, and is
the author of numerous books on scientific
questions for specialist and general readers.
ODERN man Is almost con-
I stantly under stress. A scien¬¨
tist solving a complicated mathemat¬¨
ical problem, a businessman facing
keen competition, a husband watching
his wife dying of some incurable
disease and a sportsman straining
every muscle to the limit are all in
their different ways undergoing stress.
Stress has been defined as the res¬¨
ponse of the body to any demand
made upon It, whether pleasant or
unpleasant, that requires it to readjust
to an entirely new situation.
As a result of millions of years of
evolution, living organisms can func¬¨
tion efficiently in their normal environ¬¨
ment provided that their "internal
environment" remains within the fairly
narrow limits of what, for each or¬¨
ganism, are ¬°deal conditions. The
norms involved differ from one type of
organism to another the temperature
at which fish thrive, for instance, would
be lethal for rabbits.
The ideal conditions of the Internal
environment needed by an organism
if it Is to function normally have been
established by an age-long process
of trial and error. They are recorded
in the organism's gene memory and
passed on from one generation to
another. But since the world In which
all creatures exist is constantly
changing, nature has endowed them
with special mechanisms which enable
them to regulate and maintain their
internal stability.
These self-adjusting systems operate
on the feedback principle, and each
has a different function. The one
responsible for maintaining the body's
equilibrium is known as homeostasis
(from the Greek words homoios,
meaning similar, and stasis, meaning
position). As the American physiol¬¨
ogist Walter Cannon has put it,
homeostasis is "the co-ordinated
physiological processes which main¬¨
tain most of the steady states In the
organism." Other systems (uncon¬¨
ditioned and conditioned reflexes)
help living beings to find the best
possible external environment or to
change it to suit themselves.
The general way in which these two
closely connected mechanisms work
is well known. Unconditioned reflexes
come into operation first. When an
abnormal situation arises, this mech¬¨
anism sets off a series of reactions
in the organism to restore things to
normal. When an animal gets too close
to a fire it recoils; when it finds there
Is not enough to eat in its usual
feeding grounds, it looks for food
elsewhere.
If unconditioned reflexes are unable
to restore the situation to normal,
another biological mechanism, known
as homeostatic regulation, goes into
action.
An organism deprived of enough
food Is prompted by its built-in control
mechanisms to adopt a pattern of
behaviour that uses up fewer calories.
Its biological mechanisms also com¬¨
pensate for any excess in the
substances needed to sustain life:
when the blood-sugar level rises, the
pancreas secretes an increased quan¬¨
tity of insulin, bringing the sugar level
back to normal.
The purpose of these reactions by
the organism is always to preserve
its integrity and a certain degree of
independence in relation to its exter¬¨
nal environment, and also to enable It
to adjust to changes in that environ¬¨
ment. Both these processes are called
adaptation.
Hans Selye, a leading Canadian
physiologist, who has studied the
problems of biological adaptation and
stress for many years, has affirmed
that "Adaptability is probably the most
distinctive characteristic of life." In this
article I have drawn extensively on the
results of Selye's research and some
of the basic ideas of his stress
concept.
The processes of adaptation such as
I have described obviously operate in
the human organism: when we are
short of food, for instance, we do
everything possible to procure some,
and when we are cold, our blood
vessels shrink so as to reduce heaK
loss from the body's surface. r

### Stress: the wear and tear of modern life
W With the emergence of human so¬¨
ciety, however, another adaptation
mechanism evolved, which might be
termed the system of social adaptation.
The growth of civilization led to the
development of certain values and
standards of social conduct, con¬¨
sidered to be beneficial to the indi¬¨
vidual and society as a whole. Among
these values are respect for kinship,
the prohibition of incest, murder, etc.
These rules, which are transmitted
from generation to generation, vary
from one society, State or people to
another, but the important thing is that
every adult is aware of them.
When someone notes a divergence
between what he has come to accept
as normal and what is actually hap¬¨
pening, he may be impelled by the
mechanism of social adaptation to try
to change the situation. He may do
all he can to protect his family from
danger, to prevent a murder or a theft,
to attain a better place In society
always provided that these forms of
behaviour are part of the rules he has
learned from his parents and teachers.
But if in spite of all his efforts, he is
unable to change the situation in the
way he wishes (if, for Instance, he fails
in his career or loses a close relative)
then he must make the best of it and
adapt to things as they are. He must
change his outlook on the world, and
readjust his habits and his standards
of conduct. In other words he must
reduce or cancel out the difference
between things as he would like them
to be and the real-life situation.
Any discrepancy between the norms
to which the organism's adaptation
systems are attuned and the actual
state of affairs within the organism or
outside it produces stress. These
stress-producing factors (or "stres¬¨
sors" as they are known) set off first
an alarm signal and then a stress
reaction. At this point biological
mechanisms come into play to enable
the organism to adapt to the demands
being made on it.
One of Selye's most important
achievements has been to show, on the
basis of precise biological experi¬¨
ments, that the adaptive reactions of
living organisms are powered by what
he calls "adaptation energy", a kind of
"fuel" stored within the organism.
In his book "Stress without Dis¬¨
tress", he notes that the concept of
stress is very old:
"It must have occurred even to
prehistoric man that the loss of vigour
and the feeling of exhaustion that
overcame him after hard labour, pro¬¨
longed exposure to cold or heat, loss
of blood, agonizing fear, or any kind
of disease had something in com¬¨
mon."
According to Selye, adaptation
energy is not merely caloric energy.
For example, during illness, which can
be considered a form of adaptation
whereby the body endeavours either to
eliminate an infection or to live with it,
"Get set... go!"
The athlete who leaps into action at the sound of
the starter's pistol discharges the nervous and
muscular tension that has built up in him before
the race. To cope with "stress situations" of this
kind, the organism mobilizes what has been called
"adaptation energy", although no precise scientific
method exists for measuring it. But scientists have
noted that the organism reacts identically whatever
the cause of the stress (competitive sport, pressures
in professional, social or emotional life, or physical
illness). Exhaustion of adaptation energy through
demands that are prolonged, too frequent or too
intensive leads to "distress", an unpleasant
or damaging form of stress.
the patient may have a normal or even
higher than normal intake of food, i.e.
raw material for the production of
caloric energy. Nevertheless, he con¬¨
tinues to lose strength.
What can this new physiological
theory of stress and adaptation energy
tell us about the condition of modern
man? What happens when the
businessman, the scientist and the
sportsman have to respond to demands
for increased mental and physical
effort?
According to Selye, the body res¬¨
ponds in an absolutely stereotyped
manner to the many different demands
made on it. There is, for instance,
increased activity of the cortex (outer
shell) of the adrenal gland, which
secretes hormones into the blood, and
shrinkage of the thymus (an endocrine
gland in the chest).
The body's reaction is always the
same, differing only from one case to
another, if the adaptation system is
functioning normally, according to the
intensity of the stress. The behaviour
of the body can be compared with that
of a crew of oarsmen trying to follow
a course against an adverse wind: the
more the wind and waves tend to drive
the boat off course, the harder the
oarsmen must row to reduce their
effects.
This phenomenon seems at first
sight to be something of a paradox.
One can accept that the processes of
adaptation controlled by the uncon¬¨
ditioned reflexes (regulating, for
instance, the functioning of the heart
or the tone of the body's vascular
and muscular systems, etc.) have a
common basis and use some sort of
catalytic "adaptation energy" In
addition to caloric energy. Unfor¬¨
tunately, however, the carrier of this
adaptation energy is still unknown.
But how is it that purely psycholo¬¨
gical stresses cause the same bio¬¨
chemical reactions in the body as
those created by physical stresses
such as cold, hunger or exhausting
physical labour?
Everyone, as I have said, carries
around in his memory a set of social
standards. If we accept one of the
most popular current theories of
memory that living organisms retain
information by re-ordering the atoms
of the protein molecules within the
brain cells we can also accept the
argument that any stress reaction
experienced by the organism will also
have its effects at molecular level.
When it is impossible to eliminate
stress by changing our environment,
all we can do is to wipe out the "ideal"
which is recorded in our memories, in
other words, to re-arrange the atoms
in the protein molecules of our brain
cells. To do this we need to expend
a certain amount of energy adap¬¨
tation energy.
Each of us receives at birth, written
into our genetic make-up, a certain
ration of adaptation "fuel", the size of
which varies from one individual to
another but only within fairly narrow
limits. Nature has provided us with a
special mechanism which strictly
controls the rate at which this fuel Is
fed into the organism.
This mechanism can be compared
to a coalmine. Batches of "fuel" are
brought up regularly to the surface
and distributed to the various homeo-
statlc systems, enabling them to carry
out minor "repairs" and to eliminate
the stresses of everyday life. In this
situation, the body functions like a
motor engine working at cruising
speed. Fuel consumption is low and
there is enough "in the tank" for many
years of normal human life.
This is the ideal, but in the hectic
times in which we live, the reality is
very different. Nowadays, our various
adaptation systems are faced with
cases of extreme stress which demand
considerably more than their normal
ration of adaptation fuel.
In such circumstances, the organism

### Stress: the wear and tear of modern life
sends out a distress signal and all
available stocks of adaptation energy
are directed towards the disaster area.
This full-scale mobilization enables
people to perform "superhuman" feats:
someone who has never done any
sport in his life manages to jump
over a wide ditch when pursued by a
mad dog, a scientist carried away by
his own enthusiasm solves a problem
which hitherto seemed Insoluble.
Unfortunately, all these "emergency
calls" leave their mark on the organ¬¨
ism. While all the adaptation energy
is being used in the main theatre of
operations, the adaptation processes
in other parts of the organism are
slowed down through lack of fuel. The
organism's normal functioning is dis¬¨
rupted and it wears out before its
time. For example, mental fatigue can
lead to nervous disorders of the
myocardium (the muscular part of the
heart), causing biochemical changes
which in turn spark off disruptions In
the control of the blood supply.
"Distress" is simply an aggravation
of this process, which causes
myocardium to age prematurely.
the
Doctors have reported cases where
patients with extensive skin burns
have developed stomach and duodenal
ulcers. These ailments may well be
connected with a shortage of the
adaptation energy required for the
normal operation of the homeostatic
regulation system in the stomach and
intestines, all the available energy
having been mobilized to deal with the
burns.
Both unpleasant stress ("distress",
as Hans Selye calls it) and less
intensive but prolonged stress are
damaging. Distress causes a state of
shock, with the organism, even with
the help of all the available energy,
unable to cope with the imbalance (as
in the case of a man freezing to death).
Prolonged stress causes premature
and irreparable wear and tear on the
organism, as well as functional
disorders.
A person who has suffered a serious
illness or a severe shock will ev¬¨
entually recover his or her vigour, but
the "scars" left by the period of
extreme stress will never disappear.
Blood pressure, ulcers and diabetes
are all In a sense indelible scars from
wounds caused by distress.
Even more dangerous, however, are
cases when an organism placed in an
extremely critical situation forces the
"mine" to work overtime.
This means that for a while ¬°t re¬¨
ceives extra supplies of life-giving
energy. But alas, there is no fooling
nature: these inherited reserves are
limited, and it is extremely dangerous
to burn them up too fast. The first
warning signs of this impending dan¬¨
ger are already to be seen in the
present widespread increase of what
Selye calls "diseases of adaptation".
Hans Selye's stress concept gives
a new insight into several alarming
developments in the last two decades, .
such as the sharp rise in cardiovas- ^

### Stress: the wear and tear of modern life
Stress without distress
"Contrary to widespread belief, stress is not simply
nervous tension nor the result of damage", writes
the Canadian scientist Hans Selye, internationally
famous for his research into stress. "Anything,
pleasant or unpleasant, that speeds up the intensity
of life causes an increase in stress. A painful blow
and a passionate kiss can be equally stressful.
Stress is not necessarily something to be avoided.
It is associated with the expression of all our
innate drives. Indeed, complete freedom from stress
is death I"
^ cular illnesses and cancer, drug addic¬¨
tion and suicide, violence and terror¬¨
ism, and the outbreak of various
mysterious epidemics.
Could these be due to a drastic
reduction in human reserves of adap¬¨
tation energy ? Are these reserves
being squandered as the result of
disturbances In adaptive systems that
are overloaded by the stresses of
modern life?
It is generally agreed that th√© dev¬¨
eloped countries have been hardest
hit by the ills mentioned above. This
may seem surprising since progress
in industry, science, agriculture and
public health has brought favourable
living conditions to these countries.
However, the apparent paradox is
easily explained when one takes into
account the chain reaction of mount¬¨
ing pressures in everyday life faced
by people In these countries.
Men and women living in modern
Industrialized societies are subject to
far greater stress than those living in
the developing countries or our prede¬¨
cessors in the 19th century. As
already noted, each stress reaction
burns up a certain amount of
"adaptation fuel" and in cases of
"distress" all or nearly all of our
"reserve stocks" are summoned up.
As a result, the mechanisms of adapta¬¨
tion which control and regulate other
vital systems In the body such as the
cardio-vascular and digestive systems
cannot function normally.
It is probably no coincidence that
cancer has become so widespread
since we entered the age of the great¬¨
est tension and anxiety and most rapid
change that the world has ever known.
Perhaps the growth of cancer cells is
connected with disruptions of the hu¬¨
man homeostatic mechanism.
A correlation can also be made bet¬¨
ween the abuse of alcohol and drugs
and the exhaustion of adaptation ener¬¨
gy: people who are chronically short
of such energy naturally tend to turn
to stimulants. But the use of these
substitutes has much the same effect
as that of a whip on a tired horse.
We have already pointed out that
In order to live a normal life, everyone
needs to be guided by certain stan¬¨
dards. This ¬°deal model of the world
around comes from education and
upbringing, and people try to conform
to such a model from an early age._
Faced with the reality of daily life each'
person is exposed to different forms
of stress "(and sometimes distress), to
which, in practical terms, he or she
can react in one of two ways.
The first way is to try to bring
reality into line with his own standards.
However, transforming society is easier
said than done. The individual who
persists In this course may either try
to revolutionize and improve society
or he may become a social misfit, a
delinquent or criminal, and a danger to
society.
The other alternative is to readjust
his own standards, and this at first
sight seems the easier course. Un¬¨
fortunately, by choosing to conform,
he has to retreat from one ideal and
moral principle after another, and each
of these readjustments uses up adap¬¨
tation energy. Should he be unable
to cope with this problem, he turns
to drugs or alcohol in an effort to
deaden his distress.
The chronic shortage of adaptation
energy may have another even more
dangerous consequence for modern
man. In his writings on stress, Hans
Selye links the loss of vigour, the
apathy shown by people who have had
a serious Illness or been under severe
nervous strain with the fact that their
adaptation energy has been used up
In the course of the stress reaction.
It is logical to suppose that "adap¬¨
tation fuel" supplies energy for the
"reflex of purpose" to which another
great 20th century physiologist, Ivan
Pavlov, accorded such an important
tole in human life. "The reflex of
purpose is the basic form of the Indi¬¨
vidual's vital energy," wrote Pavlov.
If this is so, another modern phe¬¨
nomenon can also be attributed to the
over-consumption of adaptation en¬¨
ergy: the decline, In relative terms, In
the number of men and women of
genius, those in whom the reflex of
purpose Is most strikingly demon¬¨
strated In the form of extraordinary
intellectual power.
In some developed countries, there
has been a marked increase In the
number of suicides in recent years.
Perhaps this too may result from a
lack of adaptation energy and an over¬¨
burdening of modern man's adaptation
systems.
Unfortunately, technological pro¬¨
gress, casting its spell over us, creates
the illusion that the dangers are
exaggerated or unjustified. The facts,
however, leave no room for compla¬¨
cency. Specialists have reckoned
that although the volume of scientific
research is increasing, the number of
researchers Is mounting even more
steeply. There has been a continuous
decline in recent years in the amount
of new scientific information obtained
per scientist. Successful research
results are increasingly being achieved
by teamwork, not by outstanding
scientists working individually.
Nor should we welcome the world
population explosion. Statistics show
conclusively that the population in¬¨
crease is due mainly to the decline in
infant mortality and the rising birthrate
in the developing countries.
But coronary thrombosis, strokes,
cancer, mental disorders and suicide
are taking a heavy toll in the indus¬¨
trially developed countries, especially
among the most highly qualified,
educated and talented all those who
are subject to the greatest stresses of
modern life.
The fact is that, like a boat race
crew, people today are using all their
energy in order to go faster and faster.
But sooner or later they must realize
that although the boat is still moving
forward under its own momentum, the
crew is completely exhausted, having
used up nearly all its adaptation
energy.
I have simply wished to draw atten¬¨
tion to this global problem, though
without presuming to offer an overall
solution. But It is clear that one must
be found.
Research has hitherto been concen¬¨
trated on the biological aspects of
adaptation energy, but I would like to
emphasize the Importance of its social
aspect, which has so far not been
adequately studied.
In the final analysis It is society and
the structure of society which deter¬¨
mine the purposes for which men and
women use their adaptation energy.
And so society should not be indiffer¬¨
ent to the ways In which this energy
is used.

### Music, dance and ecstasy
Unesco-sponsored studies of different cultures
sometimes reveal the common origins of the great
currents of civilization from which the modern
world has evolved. Traditional music is a striking
example, particularly religious and ritual music
which have preserved a remarkable continuity
throughout religious, social and cultural changes.
Several recordings of religious and mystical music
were recently issued in three Unesco collections
of recorded traditional music Musical Sources,
Anthologies, and Musical Atlas produced by the
International Institute for Comparative Music
Studies (in Berlin and Venice) under its director
Alain Dani√©lou. These recordings are of outstand¬¨
ing interest since they add a new and living dimen¬¨
sion to the studies of archaeologists and linguists.
(See "Unesco Records", page 15). In the following
article, Alain Dani√©lou examines the origins, evo¬¨
lution and significance of some of the ancient
religious and ritual music that has come down

dual. A person who considers he is
being sacrificed to the overriding
demands of the group feels "re¬¨
habilitated" and uplifted through
personal contact with the mysterious
world of the spirits.
This use of sound to produce psycho¬¨
logical and magical effects would
appear to be one of the funda¬¨
mental r√¥les of music, perhaps even
its original function, though we tend
to forget this when considering the
aesthetic aspects of the art of music.
Yet this, indeed, is an essential
function of music and one that keeps
recurring. But we can only recognize
its characteristics if we are familiar
with the rhythmic, melodic and modal
techniques used and their correspond¬¨
ing dance movements.
In the ensemble of cultures spann¬¨
ing Asia from India to the Mediterra¬¨
nean the performance of certain forms
of ecstatic dances and music as a
means of communicating with the
supernatural world appears to have its
origins in a very ancient religion.
According to the Hindus, the God
Shiva created the world and all living
creatures through the harmony of his
dancing and the rhythms of his drum.
The legends of Shiva are told in a body
of texts, varying greatly as to date and
origin, somewhat similar to those of
the Bible. These texts, known as the
Pur√¢n√¢s ("ancient tales"), deal with a
wide variety of subjects.
The oldest sections of the Pur√¢n√¢s
were written at a very early date,
though they were only translated from
some now-forgotten tongue into Sans¬¨
krit at a much later period. According

### Music, dance and ecstasy
to the chronology of the Pur√¢n√¢s,
around the 6th millenium B.C. an incar¬¨
nation of Shiva with the help of his
wife, the mother-goddess P√¢rvati,
taught men the practice of Yoga and
how to use music and dance so that
they could communicate with the gods.
Rites somewhat similar to these
seem to have played a major r√¥le
throughout the Indo-Mediterranean
world. An obvious kinship exists bet¬¨
ween the ancient religion of Crete, the
Egyptian cult of Osiris and the worship
of Dionysus or Bacchus in Greece and
Rome. Descriptions of bacchanals,
dithyrambs [songs honouring Dionysus]
and the ecstatic dances of the maenads
[female attendants] that have come
down to us correspond exactly with
dance forms still current in India today.
The Nordic peoples who invaded
India, Iran, Greece, and a large part of
Europe from the 2nd Millenium B.C.
onwards and who, in India, called
themselves Aryans, a word meaning
"noble" tried to stamp out these
ecstatic rites. But the people still clung
to them as their religion, and they re¬¨
appeared when the repression abated.
At about the same time, in the 5th cen¬¨
tury B.C., ecstatic dances and rites
once more became an accepted part
of official religion in both Greece and
India.
No doubt existed in the ancient world
that the Indian god Shiva and Diony¬¨
sus, the Greek god, were one and the
same. When Alexander the Great's
soldiers reached India they immediately
went to the Hill of Nysa, the sacred
hill of Shiva, to embrace their brothers
in Dionysus, the Bacchoi (followers of
Bacchus) who in India were known as
the bhaktas (participants).
There was a great revival of Diony-
siac rites in the troubled period that
saw the birth of Christianity, and these
rites strongly influenced both Orphic
ceremonies (inspired by Orpheus) and
Christian rituals. Until quite recently,
groups performing ecstatic dance
rituals were still to be found in the
Slavonic countries, In the Rhine region
and southern Italy.
Group dancing leading to ecstatic
slates is still performed in India, in the
form of Kirtana (the Song of Glory),
which is similar to the Greek dithy¬¨
ramb. I have watched these ceremo¬¨
nies in southern India. The partici¬¨
pants, standing in a circle and chant¬¨
ing repeated invocations, dance by
swaying their bodies and shaking their
heads in time with the deafening beat
of drums.
When the movements have become
automatic and almost unconscious, the
rhythm speeds up, and then suddenly
changes. This creates a shock, a dis¬¨
turbance which throws the dancers
into a trance. Some of them, usually
the women, are then possessed by a
spirit: they tear their clothes, roll about *
on the ground, uttering prophecies. In r
During their courting
dance, cranes march
in a circle, beating
their wings and feet
to the rhythm of their
cries. Right, young
Watusi women of
the Zaire Republic
execute the "dance
of the crowned
cranes". Observation
of nature has inspired
traditional dances in
many human
communities.

### Music, dance and ecstasy
, other words, the spirit speaks through
their mouths.
The rhythms used are always un¬¨
even, in 5, 7 or 1 1 time. Even rhythms,
those with 4 or 8 beats, do not produce
this hypnotic effect. The process
Involved and the characteristics of
these dances are the same the world
over, in India, in the Middle East and
in Africa, for example.
Buddhism, which originally began
as a movement of moral, puritanical
reform known as the Hin√¢y√¢na (the
Lesser Vehicle), soon reabsorbed in
its popular forms the Tantric rites of
Shiva worship, including ecstatic rites,
dances and erotic symbols.
It was in this more popular form, the
Mah√¢y√¢na (the Great Vehicle) that
Buddhism spread to Tibet and influenc¬¨
ed the entire Far East. But while the
shomyo [classical chant of Buddhism
in Japan] contains many ritual gestures
and practices carried over from the
cult of Shiva, the ecstatic element is
completely absent.
This is not the case In the Middle
East. The Zikr or Dhekr rituals, which
are performed by Islamic brotherhoods
such as the Sufis, are directly descend¬¨
ed from the Dionysiac ceremonies of
Greece, whose musical techniques
they have preserved along with ges¬¨
tures that are practically identical to
those of India. These wonderful cere¬¨
monies give expression to one of the
mystical aspects both of Islam and
Hinduism.
Gatherings where the Zikr is per¬¨
formed are kept secret since they
demand total concentration on the part
of the participants, who must give
themselves over entirely to inspiration.
One comes across Zikrs in all the
Shiite and Sunnite Muslim countries,
in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iran, Turkey,
Algeria and Morocco. They are also
performed in Yugoslavia, where the
style of the songs has remained very
close to their ancient Greek proto¬¨
types.
We were able to make recordings
of and issue as records several Zikrs
with the permission of the spiritual
leaders of these brotherhoods. While
these leaders are reluctant to allow
the presence of outsiders to disturb
the ceremonies, they nevertheless al¬¨
lowed us to make recordings of them
for the benefit of those who are inter¬¨
ested in these profound expressions
of spiritual and mystical experience.
Only those who are permitted
to take part in the rites of a brother¬¨
hood can learn the dance movements,
the head-shaking and the swaying of
the body that produce a state of
ecstasy. Yet even in recorded form,
the music and the singing create a

deep impression on the listener, help¬¨
ing him to discover a new dimension
In the world of sound.
The Sufis, men inspired by a search
for spirituality, join together in brother¬¨
hoods, rejecting the comforts of city
life and practising a monastic austerity.
Bernard Mauguin, a French musicolo¬¨
gist, has written of them: "A great
many such groups were formed around
spiritual leaders known as Sheikhs,
in the 11th century. These groups
freely accepted a common disci¬¨
pline" and devotion to a ritual which
offered them a means of attaining the
supreme goal of their existence: a per¬¨
petual quest for perfection leading to
total dissolution of self in God (fana).
Thus were formed the great religious
brotherhoods of the dervishes (tari-
kat)... The Zikr is a formula for inward
concentration and for achieving deeper
knowledge of self... based on repeti¬¨
tion of the names of God."
The name itself cannot in this con¬¨
text be considered separately from the
rhythm of its repetition, for this alone
enables the dancers to assimilate it
into their own vital rhythms and to
identify themselves with it. This can
even be achieved through repeated
listening to a recording of the Zikr.
The aims and methods of the Zikr are
almost identical to those of certain
Tantric Yoga practices.
One can readily sense In the ins¬¨
tinctive impulses of modern youth a
yearning for a return to forms of
religious experience not limited to the
outward observance of social and
moral rules, but concerned with the
search for contact with the super¬¨
natural.
The rhythms of dance insulate man
from his material and everyday pre¬¨
occupations. It is through dance and
rhythm that people seeking to enter
into direct contact with the mysterious
spirit world attempt to ward off evil
influences and to create a kind of
safety zone about themselves. This
process plays a fundamental role in
both African cults and Hindu rites.
Dancing to music with a strong rhythm,
such as Rock, can also become a kind
of refuge, the expression ill-directed
perhaps, and at times despairing of a
deep-seated need, that can only find
fulfilment in a return to initiatory rites.
Through their music and dance, these
rites enable the entire being to partake
of an experience in which divine love
finds expression through the words of
human love Itself, as In the mystical
poems of the great Sufi poets, such
as the celebrated Persian classic, the
Mathnavi, from the pen of Jal√¢l al-Din
R√ªmi.

### Doomsday for the world's tropical rain forests? Unless present trends are reversed virtually all the world's rain forests will disappear within 20 years
DOOMSDAY FOR THE
WORLD'S TROPICAL
RAIN FORESTS ?
%ty*:
Today, faced with the pressing needs of a soaring human population,
governments are seeking new frontiers for development, and tropical rain forests
are coming increasingly under the threat of uncontrolled human interference.
Aware of the urgent need for further research on tropical forests Unesco was
responsible for establishing, in 1958, the first international research programme
in this field, the programme of Humid Tropics Research. This programme helped
to alert world opinion to the fragility of the tropical forest ecosystem.
Today, under its Man and the Biosphere Programme, Unesco is leading and
co-ordinating a vast international research effort aimed at reconciling the twin
imperatives of conservation and development.
The first steps in the conservation programme have already been taken under the
Man and the Biosphere project for "biosphere reserves" or protected natural
areas: already in Latin America, for example. Mexico is establishing biosphere
reserves in its tropical lowlands, while Brazil has earmarked large areas of
Amazonian forest in which reserves will be established.
In south-east Asia a typical pilot project on the development of swamp forest is
now starting in the Upang Delta in Indonesia. Scientists are studying the possible
impact of the large scale conversion of swamp forest into agricultural land on
the environment in general, on the nutrient cycling of soil, on flood control,
public health, on the social implications of human resettlement, etc.
In Africa, research workers are examining the possible effects of the development
of the hitherto untouched Tai forest of the western region of the Ivory Coast
In addition, a detailed state-of-knowledge report on tropical forest ecosystems,
now in preparation, will be published by Unesco with financial aid from the U.N.
Environment Programme and in co-operation with other U.N. Specialized
Agencies and several non-governmental organizations.

Apart from the forests of the Amazon basin (right above) few undisturbed natural
tropical rain forests exist today. Most are subjected to disturbances ranging from
shifting cultivation by forest communities to exploitation of large areas for their
valuable timber. Right, five tropical forest "profiles" showing effects of different
degrees of exploitation. They are taken from a Unesco report on the Increasing
impact of human activities on tropical forests.
1. In this unmanaged forest, gaps between tallest trees are due to natural factors
such as lightning, land-slides and hurricanes etc. (at left) to selective exploitation
followed by natural regeneration (centre) and to shifting cultivation (right).
2. Several management techniques, used in conjunction with exploitation, assist
natural regeneration. New trees grow between surviving tall ones from original
forest.
3. Forest management has used several methods of artificial regeneration, including
the planting of saplings in exploited areas and cultivation of tree crops alongside
farming crops.
4. Intensive management has replaced original trees with conifers or hardwood
timber plantations and trees for crops such as cocoa, palm oil or rubber.
5. Original forest has gone; land is used for settled farming, including crop
growing and livestock raising.

N OT many years ago the term
"Tropical Rain forest" would
have meant little except to a few
specialists in tropical biology or in
certain sections of the timber industry.
Today the position is quite different:
scientific and popular books and jour¬¨
nals are full of references to the
forests of the tropics to schemes
for their more intensive exploitation,
concern at the rate at which they are
decreasing and warnings of the poss¬¨
ible consequences of their disappear¬¨
ance not only for the world's fauna
and flora but for the earth's atmos¬¨
phere and climate, and the whole
human environment.
The mounting concern for the
future of tropical forests is now

### Non-article text
W reflected, as It certainly should be, In
~ the agenda of the United Nations'
agencies. Several of them are now
sponsoring programmes intended to
Improve our still regrettably deficient
knowledge of tropical ecology.
They are also aiming to promote
the more efficient utilization of tropical
forests and above all to encourage
their conservation both as a renewable
resource for the peoples of the tropi¬¨
cal countries and as natural monu¬¨
ments which should be preserved for
the admiration and study of future
generations.
Tropical forests are an Important
part of the human heritage which
should be the responsibility of all
nations and not solely of the 20 to 30
in whose territory they happen to lie.
To explain why this is so one must first
say something about the biological
characteristics of rain forest eco¬¨
systems and their significance to man.
Not all tropical forests are tropical
rain forests.
In the lowland tropics, as in other
parts of the world, the natural vege¬¨
tation depends on the climate: tropical
rain forests tall, dense forests In
which most of the trees are evergreen
are found only in regions where
rainfall is abundant throughout the
year, often falling on the average on
three days out of every five.
Annual totals are high, often over
300 cm. But not all tropical forests
are continually wet: in regions where
four or more consecutive months are
nearly rainless there are large areas of
what are sometimes termed "seasonal
tropical forests" ; in these forests
many of the trees lose their leaves
for shorter or longer periods In the
dry season. In the mountains of the
tropics the type of forest changes
with increasing elevation but usually
up to about 1,000 metres It remains
more or less similar to the lowland
forests.
A survey carried out by the Royal
Swedish College of Forestry estimates
the total area of tropical forests in the
early 1970s at 1,456 million hectares
(equivalent to about half the world's
remaining forests) of which about 560
million are different types of tropical
rain forests.
The largest area of tropical rain
forest still remaining is in Amazonia
and the adjoining territories of South
America but there are also consider¬¨
able, though fast diminishing, areas in
West and Central Africa, in the island
of New Guinea, in Borneo and else¬¨
where.
Unique diversity of plant and animal
life. The biological characteristic which
above all others distinguishes tropical
rain forests (and to a smaller extent
seasonal tropical forests) from other
natural ecosystems is the enormous
diversity of species of plants and ani¬¨
mals. While in temperate forests,
whether broad-leaved or coniferous,
an area of a few hectares seldom
carries more than a dozen different
species of trees, in tropical rain
forests It is not unusual to find over
100 different kinds of trees of 30 cm.
girth or more in an equivalent area.
In the rain forest of the Jengka
Triangle in Malaysia (since destroyed)
375 tree species 91 cm. in girth and
over were found in plots covering
just over 23 hectares.
For animals the contrast between
the tropical rain forest and .other
natural ecosystems is equally femark-
able. An area of forest in Panama has
about twice as many mammal. species
as a similar one in eastern U.S.A.
Elsewhere in Central America the
number of resident bird species can
reach five or six hundred In an area
of 700 sq. km and even the tiny
biological reserve of Finca La Selva in
Costa Rica, only 6 sq. km in extent,
has 221 species. Both these totals
are much greater than are found in the
same area of forest in the temperate
zone. In tropical forests insects exceed
all other animals put together in both
number of species and total numbers.
Why tropical forests, especially rain
forests, are so rich In different kinds
of plants and animals Is not entirely
clear; several factors may be respon¬¨
sible. One is almost certainly age.
Fossil evidence suggests that forests
not very different from those of today
already existed in the Malayan region
and elsewhere in the tropics far back
in geological time, perhaps as long ago
as 70 million years.
Another factor may be climate:
because the tropical rain forest is
never subject to frost or severe
drought plants and animals can grow
and reproduce all through the year.
Though recent research shows evi¬¨
dence of quite large variations in temp¬¨
erature and rainfall in the past cli¬¨
matic changes as catastrophic as the
Ice Ages which devastated Europe and
North America in the Pleistocene
period seem never to have occurred
near the equator.
The tropical rain forest has thus
been a sort of evolutionary laboratory
in which biological changes have been
proceeding uninterrupted by major cli¬¨
matic disasters over an enormously
long time.
New drugs and pesticides from
tropical forest plants. For modern man
this great reservoir of species repre¬¨
sents a potentially valuable pool of
genetic diversity of which only a small
fraction has been utilized so far. Eco¬¨
nomists, land planners and politicians
in tropical countries frequently regard
tropical forests merely as a reserve
of valuable timber to be exploited
as quickly as possible either to supply
local needs or to be exported to pro¬¨
vide much needed capital for develop¬¨
ment.
This point of view is understandable
but unbelievably short-sighted. Our
knowledge of tropical plants and ani¬¨
mals is still so inadequate that at pre¬¨
sent their uses are known only to a
very small minority. Even of trees
reaching timber size only a small pro¬¨
portion of the species are used for
any purpose (except when the entire
forest Is used to provide wood pulp
for papermaking). Yet among the
thousands of species of trees, vines
and other plants in the tropics there
may be many producing chemical
compounds potentially valuable as
drugs or In other ways.
Flying lizards
and 'see through' butterflies
1. The world's rain forests abound with singular creatures, many of
which have developed special abilities for swinging, jumping or gliding
from tree to tree. Here, the Draco or flying lizard in a Borneo forest uses
its wing-like membranes to glide as much as 15 metres between trees.
2. This extraordinary butterfly from Peruvian Amazonia has transparent
"panels" in its wings through which the veins of the leaf behind are
clearly visible. South America has more species of butterflies than any
other continent and thousands more species have still to be identified.
3. The fluffy tarsier from the Philippines has huge goggle eyes which, in
relation to its 1 5 cm. body, are 1 50 times bigger than a man's. A nimble
forest acrobat capable of spectacular leaps, the tarsier can swivel its
head through 180 degrees.

A wild dioscorea growing in the
forest provides the steroids used in
manufacturing contraceptive pills and
is in fact one of Mexico's most
valuable exports. L-dopa, a drug used
in controlling Parkinson's disease,
has recently been found In the seeds
of tropical vines of the genus Mu-
cuna. These are only two examples:
how many other chemical treasures lie
hidden in tropical forest plants can
only be guessed.
With tropical forest animals the
position is much the same as for
plants. A few such as apes and
monkeys, some butterflies, parrots
and birds of paradise have a commer¬¨
cial value and are in fact in urgent
need of protection, but so little is
known about the vast majority that
their possible significance to man is
still totally unrealized.
Perfectly balanced forest ecosys¬¨
tems. Another biological characteris¬¨
tic of tropical rain forests which makes
their survival of special importance
to man can be summed up in the
phrase "a stable self-maintaining eco¬¨
system". In fact many of the world's
other natural ecosystems such as tun¬¨
dras, steppes and coniferous and
broad-leaved temperate forests are
stable and self-maintaining; in the ab¬¨
sence of large-scale disturbance by
man or major climatic changes they
would continue to exist much as they
are now for thousands or millions of
years.
In the case of the tropical rain
forest its huge assemblages of plants
and animal species have existed toge¬¨
ther for so long that an extraordinarily
complex system of adaptations bet¬¨
ween the organisms and between
them and their environment has deve¬¨
loped. As a result diseases and pests
never seem to reach epidemic propor¬¨
tions because there are so many in- .
built checks and balances. r

* On the other hand, in artificial eco¬¨
systems created by man such as gar¬¨
dens, wheatfields and rubber planta¬¨
tions, damage from pests is a
continual threat and can be controlled
only by unrelenting warfare with herbi¬¨
cides, fungicides and pesticides.
Improved methods of managing
artificial ecosystems can undoubtedly
be devised by studying the controls
which exist In natural ones; this has
already been done in some instances,
for example in controlling the insect
pests of cocoa, and of mahogany,
teak and some other tropical trees.
We need to preserve what is still left
of the natural tropical forests because
there are certainly many more such
lessons we could learn from them.
Yet another field in which we may
be able to learn from the delicately
balanced rain forest ecosystems is
that of plant nutrition. The soils on
which tropical forests grow are for
the most part remarkably poor In nitro¬¨
gen, phosphorus and other elements
necessary for plant growth, a fact
which is concealed by the luxuriant
appearance of the vegetation.
The poverty of the soils is partly
due to the long-continued effects of
heavy rainfall and partly to the geolo¬¨
gical history. The explanation of the
paradoxical vigour of the vegetation
is that a large part of the nutrient
capital of the ecosystem is contained
in the trees themselves and is rapidly
recycled. When the leaves and dead
wood fall to the ground fungi and
other decomposer organisms quickly
break them down and the nutrients
released in this way are very quickly
absorbed by roots and re-used.
In tropical forests this recycling pro¬¨
cess seems to be extremely efficient
and so little nutrient is lost in the drain¬¨
age water that the streams flowing from
undisturbed forest areas, such as parts
of Amazonia, carry water little different
in composition from pure rain water.
Scientists working in Amazonian
forests, where the soil is often un¬¨
usually poor in nutrients even com¬¨
pared with other tropical rain forests,
point out that the whole structure of
the forest is a finely adjusted mechan¬¨
ism for trapping, conserving and recy¬¨
cling the very small quantities of
nutrient elements available to it in the
rainfall and soil.
Clearly In these days when rising
costs and diminishing supplies of
agricultural fertilisers are restricting
the growth of world food supplies,
we need to learn all we can from the
economical housekeeping of natural
systems such as the tropical rain
forest.
The collecting and conserving of
nutrient elements by tropical rain
forests is only one of the ways in
which they affect the environment.
Others, certainly of great significance,
include the effects which forests, in
common with all other vegetation, have
on the carbon dioxide and oxygen
content of the atmosphere, and their
effects on rainfall, evaporation and the
hydrological cycle generally. On all
these environmental effects there is
a regrettable lack of quantitative data
so that their Importance, great though
it probably is, can be indicated only
in very general terms.
How long can the tropical rain
forest survive? If the rain forest is
a stable self-maintaining ecosystem
which has survived the hazards of
millions of years, why is it now de¬¨
creasing in area so rapidly that. Its
survival for more than a few more
decades is in doubt?
Clearly the answer is that it cannot
survive the attacks of modern man
equipped with the resources of ad¬¨
vanced technology. Through its long
evolutionary history natural selection
has provided the forest ecosystem
with mechanisms for withstanding such
natural hazards as invasions of new
species, the evolution of new parasites
and pests, minor climatic fluctuations
and so on but selection has not pro¬¨
vided it with means to resist large-
scale attacks by powersaws, bulldozers
and herbicides.
To man at lower cultural levels the
forest has been fairly resistant: primi¬¨
tive hunters and gatherers (a few of
whose descendants still live in the
forest today) made little impression
on it and even agricultural peoples
living by shifting cultivation did not
damage it irretrievably so long as their
numbers were limited. It is the popula¬¨
tion explosion of the last hundred
years and the extension of advanced
technology to the peoples of the
humid tropics which has made Its sur¬¨
vival questionable.
At the present time the threats to
the tropical rain forest come from
many directions. The world demand
for timber Is rapidly growing in both
the developed and the developing
countries and as the forest resources
of temperate Eurasia become used up,
the pressure on the forests of the tro¬¨
pics increases. As a result lumber
companies financed from distant Indus¬¨
trial countries are clear-felling enor¬¨
mous areas of rain forest in Indonesia
and elsewhere.
Tropical forests are now being used,
not as hitherto, mainly to supply high-
grade hardwood timber for construc¬¨
tion, furniture-making and veneers but
also to provide cellulose for paper
making. Already whole tracts of forest
are being felled to" feed mills where
trees of all species are converted
indiscriminately into wood-chips which
are exported overseas to be converted
into paper: such Installations are
already in operation in Colombia and
New Guinea and others are being
planned elsewhere.
The inexorably rising demand for
newsprint is also leading in some
countries to large areas of forest being
cleared to make way for plantations
of fast-growing trees such as pines
and eucalypts which can produce
paper making material faster than the
native forest trees, though whether
their high rate of production can be
maintained through many successive
rotations remains in doubt.
Besides the rapidly increasing use
of tropical forests as a source of
wood, forest land Is increasingly
needed for food production and Indus¬¨
trial crops such as palm oil, cocoa and
rubber as well as for mining and
urban growth.
Plants that glow in the night
1 . A formidable array of highly-coloured fungi sprouts from the floor of the
tropical forest. Some even glow in the dark, like this Borneo fungus (Mycena
cyanophos) which gives off enough light to be photographed in the dark without
a flash.
2. Another Borneo fungus, known as a maiden's veil from its fine net-like form.
During its mature life of less than a day it gives off a strong smell, attracting
insects which feed on its sticky spore-laden cap. When the insects leave,
the spores stick to them and are carried away to grow into new fungi.
3. This handsome Malaysia forest flower is one of the more than 20.000 species
of orchids that grow throughout the world, mostly in tropical and sub-tropical
lands. The number of wild orchids is being rapidly reduced by intensive collecting.

The construction of air strips and
of road systems such as that now
being completed in Amazonia means
that large areas of forest which were
previously almost inaccessible can now
be easily reached by settlers and this
inevitably leads to much unplanned
and uncontrolled forest clearance.
Though the need for more food
production is evident, it is unfortunate
that much forest is still being cleared
for the production of low-yielding crops
and for non-permanent types of agri¬¨
culture.
It is often supposed by those not
familiar with the ecology of the tro¬¨
pical rain forests that they will quickly
regenerate after being cleared, or that
they can be easily replaced by plant¬¨
ations of useful tree species. Unfor¬¨
tunately this is not the case.
Land abandoned after cultivation
soon becomes covered with a tangle
of bushes and climbers which after
a few years develops into secondary
forest. But this forest consists mainly
of short-lived soft-wooded trees of
little economic value; only after a long
process of succession does this
second growth become more or less
similar to the primary forest which ori¬¨
ginally occupied the site.
Such evidence as there is suggests
that a long period, perhaps several
hundred years. Is required for this
process. And If the natural succes¬¨
sion is to take place, neighbouring
areas of intact forest are required to
provide the seeds and the associated
fauna necessary for colonization.
When forest clearance Is on a very
large scale, as in modern lumber un¬¨
dertakings, it is often doubtful if
enough forest is left to ensure recolo-
nization, even if this is the intention.
If deforested land is repeatedly dis¬¨
turbed, and especially when it is also
subject to fires, it is often invaded by
Imperata and other coarse grasses
which convert the forest Into a kind
of savanna. This is of very little eco¬¨
nomic value and provides a less satis¬¨
factory protection to the soil than the
former forest cover. Natural forests,
have been replaced by planted mono-p

. cultures of trees or by mixtures of
several planted species in many places
but on a relatively small scale. The
technical problems of establishing such
artificial forests are considerable and
cannot be said to have been com¬¨
pletely overcome.
As a result of these relentless
human pressures the tropical rain
forest is everywhere in retreat. It
might be expected that such a drastic
change in one of the world's major
natural features, and one fraught with
such enormous potential consequen¬¨
ces for human welfare, would have
been carefully recorded and monitored,
but so far this has not been done.
Though it would be relatively easy
to estimate forest areas on air or
satellite photographs taken at inter¬¨
vals of a few years, hardly any ac¬¨
curate comparisons of this kind exist.
In Sarawak (Malaysia), a country in
which rain forest covered about 75
per cent of the land surface In 1950,
a comparison of photographs taken in
1946-48 with those taken in 1958-60
showed a decrease of about 2 to 3 per
cent in the area of primary lowland
forest. The conclusion was that all
of this forest will have disappeared in
at most 20 years. Comparable figures
for other parts of the tropics are badly
needed and the recent decision by
the Governing Council of the United
Nations Environment Programme to
give high priority to systematic moni¬¨
toring of the area and the rate of
decrease of the world's tropical forests
is very welcome.
Forest clearance, which In many
parts of the tropics had scarcely begun
even 50 years ago, has enormously
increased as a result of the population
growth and technological advances of
the last two decades and it is cer¬¨
tainly still accelerating. It cannot be
doubted that unless present trends are
changed all the primary lowland tropi¬¨
cal rain forest in the world will have
disappeared well before the end of the
century, except in remote and inacces¬¨
sible sites and a few small biological
reserves. Within hardly more than a
generation the landscape of the Malay
Peninsula, the Amazon basin and other
humid tropical countries, will have been
completely changed.
If the vast rain forest areas of the
past were to be replaced by a smiling
landscape of productive farmlands and
plantations, there would be less cause
for concern, but unfortunately It. is
probable that much of the former forest
will be replaced by tracts of derelict
scrub, secondary savannas 'and rela¬¨
tively unproductive second-growth
forests.
Most people would agree that be¬¨
cause of their ecological complexity
and their unique wealth In wonderful
and often very beautiful forms of plant
and animal life, tropical rain forests
are a precious part of our human
heritage. The loss to human expe-
24
rience would be irreparable if they
were allowed to disappear. Leaving
aside arguments about the effects of
tropical rain forests on climate and
the atmosphere, there are very solid
economic arguments why it would be
short-sighted, to say the least of it,
to allow a valuable natural resource
to be exhausted in hardly more than
the life time of a single generation.
A large part of what remains of the
tropical rain forest ought to be con¬¨
served, some for controlled exploita¬¨
tion and some preserved intact as
natural monuments or biological
reserves.
Yet it must be recognized that there
are formidable economic, political and
practical difficulties in the way of
such a conservation policy.
One of the most Intractable practical
difficulties is that of size. It has long
been realized that unless a rain forest
area is above a certain minimum size
the ecosystem cannot maintain itself
indefinitely. This is obvious in the
case of the larger members of the
forest fauna: mammals such as ele¬¨
phants and large predatory birds
demand much space if they are to
survive. The same is also true of many
rain forest tree species which nor¬¨
mally occur in very low densities, in '
some cases less than one per hectare.
It seems probable that reserves
should be measured in thousands of
square kilometres rather than hectares
if they are to be permanently viable.
Some existing reserves such as Barro
Colorado island in Panama are actually
losing species because their area Is
too small. To set aside and police
forest areas of such large size is In
itself a serious problem.
The political difficulties are no less
formidable. Most humid tropical coun¬¨
tries are poor and in urgent need of
foreign exchange for many social
purposes. Tropical countries, like
others, must also make their contribu¬¨
tion to the world's insatiable demand
for more food and raw materials. But
since the remaining rain forest areas
have at best rather mediocre agricul¬¨
tural prospects it would still be possi¬¨
ble to conserve considerable areas of
forest with little loss to future world
food supplies However, developing
tropical countries cannot be asked to
make sacrifices and shoulder burdens
which wealthier countries are not wil¬¨
ling to share.
The problem of rain forest conser¬¨
vation thus becomes one of finding
methods of international co-operation
which are practical and politically
acceptable to the countries where the
forests are found. Here the United
Nations' agencies have a part to play.
U.N. efforts to safeguard the rain
forests. The U.N. agencies most close¬¨
ly involved in the exploitation and con¬¨
servation of tropical rain forests are
the Food and Agriculture Organiza¬¨
tion, Unesco and the U.N. Environ¬¨
ment Programme. The World Health
Organization Is marginally Involved

OLD towns, old villages, old
buildings disappear every day.
They are swallowed up by encroaching
concrete, levelled under the macadam
of new highroads, or simply lost
through incompetence and negligence.
Yet in our modern world, with its
insistent demands for roads, factories
and housing, more and more people
deplore this razing of the past and
want to save whatever can still be
rescued.
They are motivated not only by a
respect for the past and a wish to
perpetuate historical, architectural or
aesthetic values, nor merely by a
concern for the economics of the tou¬¨
rist industry. Above all they realize
that old buildings in towns and coun¬¨
tryside transmit to us today the irrepla¬¨
ceable legacy of generations who have
gone before us.
Ancient buildings bring to us an
echo of the spirit of the craftsmen who
built them; we can see the skill of their
hands, the living image even if it is
often broken and fading of the age-
old quest for harmony, stability, and
happiness.
So, we must save what we can. And
to the question, "Is there still time?",
the answer must be "Yes!" Modern
techniques are quick to destroy, but
they can also restore life. Even better,
they can find and unearth treasures
that time has buried and of which our^
own forefathers knew nothing. r

### Bulgaria gives a future to its past: a score of ancient towns and villages find new life through a nationwide restoration programme
Some countries are favoured in this
way, and Bulgaria is one of them. The
country's history, its political and
social development and natural condi¬¨
tions have combined to maintain and
preserve ancient settlements and
monuments, dating from the Neolithic
period to the modern age.
After World War II the Bulgarian
state was able to launch a nation¬¨
wide programme to safeguard its cul¬¨
tural heritage. Steps were taken to
give historic buildings and old towns
special legal protection. Precise regu¬¨
lations were laid down for the use of
public buildings and private dwellings,
as well as for the financing of conser¬¨
vation and restoration work, and of
urban development.
Provision was made for close colla¬¨
boration between organizations con¬¨
cerned with the preservation of
historic monuments and those respon¬¨
sible for planning much-needed urban
expansion and improvement.
A score of towns and villages In
Bulgaria are now protected by the law
on cultural monuments and museums.
Small groups of historic buildings
and some private dwellings in a large
number of Bulgarian towns and
villages also benefit from the pro¬¨
tection of this law.
Studies on the preservation of these
ancient buildings also try to find a
solution to the fundamental problem
of integrating them into present-day
life. Are they to live at the feverish
pace of modern life or should they
remain peaceful oases, sheltered from
the din and bustle of the 20th century?
As this problem itself changes over
the years, no hard and fast solutions
are possible.
The old Bulgarian towns and villages
which have survived to the present
day are astonishingly varied but they
have a common link: most were built
In the 18th and 19th centuries, although
some Indeed have older buildings
inside their walls generally churches,
fountains and public baths.
But basically they belong to the
period of Bulgarian history known as
the National Revival which lasted from
the middle of the 18th century to 1878,
the date when the Bulgarian people
achieved their independence after five
centuries of foreign domination.
This epoch of major economic and
social change for Bulgaria also saw
a great flowering of intellectual life
and democratic development. Archi¬¨
tecture, painting, handicrafts, all bore
the imprint of a new national con¬¨
sciousness.
Most of the builders of this period
were unknown artisans who generally
worked in teams under a master crafts¬¨
man. Their skills created hundreds of
buildings impressive for their harmo
nious proportions and artistic embel¬¨
lishments.
Bulgaria is divided up by groups
and chains of mountains into a
number of regions with distinctive cli¬¨
matic conditions, natural resources
and landscapes. Although all Balkan
architecture of the period has some
common features, building styles, like
the landscapes, vary from region to
region, thus giving rich diversity to the
Bulgarian architectural heritage.
The houses were built to last two
or three centuries, and to provide
homes for several generations. Well-
tried building techniques and good

quality materials, together with patient
and careful craftsmanship have enabled
these buildings, whose design is some¬¨
times fragile and delicate, to survive
to the present day in a relatively good
state. Most preservation work began
before the link between past and pre¬¨
sent was broken, before life had
completely gone out of the buildings.
Conservation and protection have
been financed by the State, usually
through the People's Councils. The
owners of private houses have retained
the right to own and to continue to
live in their old homes, on condition
that they undertake not to alter the
original appearance of the buildings
in any way.
If an owner wants to sell his house,
the People's Municipal Council buys
It and decides on the best use for it.
All preservation and restoration work
is based on plans drawn up by the
National Institute for Cultural Monu¬¨
ments. Directed by specialists from
the Institute, the work is carried out
by teams of highly-trained craftsmen.
During the last 15 years this work
has expanded from emergency reno¬¨
vation of individual buildings to long-
term planning of larger-scale oper¬¨
ations. Sites for preservation are
sought out and classified. Many of
them are far from the main roads,
isolated in mountain regions where as
groups of buildings they have retained
their original architectural forms intact.
Many different approaches to the
preservation of Bulgaria's architectural
heritage have been adopted, each
tailored to the specific needs of a site.
For instance, within Plovdiv, a city
bustling with economic and cultural
activity, the old town still exists as a
completely independent locality. It is

heights forming the centre of Plovdiv, r

. Along the winding precipitous streets
the houses stand on the edge of the
rocks, seeming to make them jut out
further. They are one or two storeys
high on one street and as much as
four or five on another.
Most of these houses are still
inhabited. The biggest and the most
characteristic in style have been turned
into museums. Some have been
converted into centres for artists and
scientists ; others have been made
into restaurants or caf√©s, without losing
any of their charm. The narrow cob¬¨
bled streets of old Plovdiv lead directly
into the modern city.
The town of Melnik, situated In
south-west Bulgaria on the slopes of
the Pirin, one of the country's most
beautiful mountains, presents quite
different conservation problems. Sur¬¨
rounded by remarkable natural pyra¬¨
mids of sandstone, Melnik is located
away from any main road. The vines
that grow on the mountain slopes give
the famous red Melnik wine, "so thick
you could carry it in a handkerchief",
as the locals say.
In former days the wine was trans¬¨
ported to other European countries by
camel caravans, which returned laden
with merchandise of every kind. The
townsfolk were extremely prosperous
in the 18th and 19th centuries and built
themselves new houses, summoning
master craftsmen from far and wide
and paying them in gold.
The masons built white houses with
red roofs that contrasted sharply with
the yellow background of the hills.
The different storeys, the glassed-in
balconies and the windows were care¬¨
fully outlined in wood, like old etchings.

remain. Between the first and second
world wars economic depression
forced so many people to leave Melnik
that the population fell from 7,000-
8,000 to its present 500.
Since 1965 a team has worked all
the year round to restore Melnik.
Many houses that were falling into
ruin have been strengthened. An urban
development plan was drawn up
limiting new building to a minimum,
and providing for dilapidated houses
to be rebuilt so as to restore Melnik's
former architectural harmony.
Excavations have also begun on
sites in Melnik, a town with a long
history and an important centre of
medieval Bulgaria from the 10th to the
14th centuries. Every summer now,
student volunteers come to the sites
to dig out the medieval castle, the
town fortress and its churches all
buildings that will be partially restored.
Melnik will continue to be above all a
tourist town, for the mildness of its
climate, the beauty of its surroundings
and the proximity of bathing beaches
guarantee that it will be busy for most
of the year.
Villages sprang up in the surrounding
areas in the 18th and 19th centuries,
when Melnik was at its most prosper
ous. In recent decades young people
have left these villages. Only old men
and women, robust mountain people,
still live there and maintain the tradi¬¨
tional ways of life.
But things are changing since, one
after the other, the villages have been
accorded cultural protection. At Rojen
for example, some villagers had de¬¨
cided to sell their houses, but they
have abandoned the idea now that the
State has agreed to restore the
buildings.

L has been almost completely restored.
At its most prosperous time in the last
century, the village numbered 1 1 0 build¬¨
ings houses, workshops, a church
and a school. Of these, 99 still remain
and the rest will be restored with the
help of old photographs and docu¬¨
ments. And new inhabitants are now
moving in to join the 70 or so persons,
most of them old, who form the present
population.
Some houses, abandoned by their
owners, are being bought by artists'
associations for whose members they
provide ideal conditions for work and
leisure. Others are being bought on
their own account by painters and
writers who want to settle in Bojentzi.
Here, as in all towns designated as
historic and cultural monuments, the
sales have to be authorized by the
People's Regional Councils.
At Bojentzi the roofs are covered
with attractive old stone tiles in shades
of grey-green. Against the white¬¨
washed walls the beams and the wood
frames of the doors and windows
stand out prominently.
The peaceful countryside, the charm
of the narrow streets, the fine old
trees in the courtyards and the gar¬¨
dens, all provide an ideal atmosphere
for creative work. But artists and
writers are not the only people who
appreciate Bojentzi. Bulgarian and
foreign tourists are also frequent
visitors to the village, bringing an
unaccustomed animation to its pastoral
tranquility.
In many parts of Bulgaria today,
conservation measures and a judicious
policy of protection for the cultural
heritage are restoring the spirit of the
past and giving visitors an opportunity
to enjoy peace and beauty while
learning about Bulgaria's history.

of heroic struggles, is also a holiday
resort. Here the lay-out of the streets
sets off the richly decorated house
fronts, the sculpted wood and the
painted ornamentation In a striking
harmony of colour.
Two old towns on the Black Sea,
Nessebar and Sozopol, are especially
popular as vacation resorts. In the
modern holiday towns built nearby all
the active working population of these
two old towns finds employment from
early spring to the end of autumn and
even sometimes during winter.
Some historic villages in the Rho-
dopes mountains have become holiday
resorts for the people who live in the
towns of the plains below.
While Bulgarian towns have greatly
expanded because of economic and
industrial development over the last
three decades, the link between town
and village has not been broken. It
has simply changed a little. Town-
dwellers have never really lost contact
with the old village world, and they
want this world to continue. They wish
to preserve old ways of life because
they realize that these traditions still
have living significance.
Of course the preservation of the
towns and villages is not without its
problems. But public opinion in Bul¬¨
garia is solidly behind the State in its
policy to preserve the cultural heritage.
The authorities can count on the
collaboration of specialists and special¬¨
ized Institutions, as well as national
organizations, including youth groups.
Through these efforts a new link is

### Stress: the wear and tear of modern life
STRESS (Continued from page 9)
Throughout history, people have
realized that the conflicts which have
plagued human society have often
proved disastrous for civilization. If
we regard mankind as a single living
organism rather than as a number of
warring groups, the very idea that
struggle between members of the same
species can in some way be beneficial
becomes absurd. How could one ima¬¨
gine a healthy human organism in
which the individual cells or organs
were guided by their own "private"
interests and made war on each other?
A complacent attitude with regard
to the disruption of human adaptation
mechanisms would be nothing less
than criminal. But where does the
solution lie? History may provide the
answer, for experience shows that
when a society has been faced with
a crucial problem, it has mobilized all
its thinking power to solve It.
Until now the urgent need for a so¬¨
lution to this problem has not been
fully appreciated. But once this need
is felt, the ways and means can be
found. It is more than likely that in
our age of vast scientific knowledge
and capabilities, mankind will succeed
in understanding the nature of the
adaptation mechanism and of how it
is controlled.
The problem can only be solved by
considering all the human aspects
together, including the biological na¬¨
ture of man and the laws governing
the functioning and inter-actlon of his
various vital physiological systems.
It goes without saying that we shall
meet with difficulties at every step of
the way. But as Einstein said, every¬¨
thing we know about reality begins
and ends with experience. And ex¬¨
perience does not appear to contradict
man's eternal optimism.

### Doomsday for the world's tropical rain forests? Unless present trends are reversed virtually all the world's rain forests will disappear within 20 years
DOOMSDAY FOR THE TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS? (Continuedfrom page 24)
because of its interest in diseases
such as yellow fever and malaria
which are often closely associated
with forest conditions and the World
Meteorological Organization has some
involvement, because of the possible
climatic effects of deforestation.
The Food and Agriculture Organiza¬¨
tion has long been active In tropical
forestry, in collecting and disseminat¬¨
ing information, promoting forest edu¬¨
cation, aiding forest administrators in
tropical countries and In improving
methods of growing, harvesting and
utilizing tropical timbers and other
forest products. FAO Is also con¬¨
cerned with research on tropical tree
breeding and gene resources, forest
soils and other scientific aspects of
tropical forestry.
FAO activities have thus far been
mainly connected with the more effi¬¨
cient and economical use of tropical
forests both as producers of timber
and other commercially valuable pro¬¨
ducts and with the role of forests in
soil conservation and watershed pro¬¨
tection. More recently however FAO
has also become interested in the
conservation of tropical forests and
the wild life dependent on them. It has
helped to train administrators and
experts in tropical countries in national
park and wild life management.
Investigations sponsored by FAO
into the possible use of derelict land
and second-growth vegetation for
planting pines and other trees for
making paper pulp could give much
indirect help to tropical rain forest
conservation by diverting some of the
pressure from the remaining natural
forests to land at present almost enti¬¨
rely unproductive.
Unesco's main role In the field of
tropical forest ecology and conserv¬¨
ation has of course been In education
and research, In promoting contacts
between specialists concerned with
tropical forests and their survival.
Because lack of knowledge was, and
still is, a serious problem in this field,
Unesco's role is an Important one.
Since 1960 Unesco's main efforts
have been concentrated first on the
International Biological Programme
and then on its successor, Man and
the Biosphere. In earlier years however
Unesco was responsible for some
valuable Initiatives, notably the very
useful series of symposia on tropical
ecology beginning with the Kandy
symposium in 1956. These played an
important part in bringing together the
few and scattered experts in the field
and in encouraging further research.
The International Biological Pro¬¨
gramme was concerned with worldwide
natural resources and it stimulated a
considerable amount of ecological
research in tropical countries. One of
its projects specifically aimed at the
tropical rain forest was the ecological
study of Pasoh forest in Negri
Sembilan (Malaysia), one of the few
remaining accessible areas of lowland
rain forest in the Malay Peninsula.
In this project British, Japanese and
Malaysian research workers collaborat¬¨
ed and the results presented at the
symposium in Kuala Lumpur in Aug¬¨
ust 1974 gave an impressive picture
of how much the project had achieved.
The theme of the International Bio¬¨
logical Programme was the functioning
and productivity of ecosystems such
as tundras, grasslands and forests
under natural conditions. Man and the
Biosphere is focussing attention on the
effects of man on these same systems.
The programme is organized into a
number of projects, the first of which
is the "Ecological effects of increasing
human activities on tropical and sub¬¨
tropical forest ecosystems".
A panel of experts met in Paris
in May 1972 to draw up plans for this
project and to define Its scope. A
wide range of problems is in urgent
need of investigation such as the
effects of converting tropical forests
into plantations and other forms of
land use and this will involve studying
insect and fungus populations which
are or might become pests, soil chan¬¨
ges, the loss of species diversity and
many other subjects.
Such research necessarily involves
comparisons between natural ecosys¬¨
tems and artificial ones derived from
them, so it is essential that undis¬¨
turbed samples of natural systems
should be available for study and it
is thus vitally important that tropical
forest areas such as Malaysia's Pasoh
forest, which was used in the Inter¬¨
national Biological Programme, should
continue to be preserved.
The U.N. Environment Programme
has been concerned with the future
of tropical forests since its found¬¨
ation, and in 1974 prepared a report
for its Governing Council on the pre¬¨
sent environmental situation in tropical
forests and woodlands as one of the
sectors of the world environment of
critical importance.
Studying this report at its meeting
in Nairobi in April 1975, the Council
passed a number of resolutions, one
of which was to ask for a system of
monitoring the remaining tropical forest
areas and the rate at which they are
diminishing.
Among other objectives supported
by the Nairobi meeting were the en¬¨
couragement of research on the re¬¨
lationship between tropical forest
ecosystems and water, air and soil, on
the minimum self-maintaining area for
tropical forest reserves and on agri¬¨
cultural systems for tropical forest
areas more suitable than those at
present available. It also wished to
develop guidelines for the manage¬¨
ment of tropical forest ecosystems and
their "wisest use".
The United Nations' agencies can
do much to safeguard the future of
the tropical rain forest but they will
need the support of enlightened public
opinion and the full co-operation of the
tropical countries themselves.

Letters to the Editor
BARTHOLOME DE LAS CASAS
Sir,
No one doubts that Bartholom√© de
Las Casas was a champion of Indian
rights in 16th century Spanish America
(as your June 1975 issue describes
him). He also incidentally left behind
him what was tantamount to a massive
denunciation of colonialism. Unfortu¬¨
nately, Las Casas never quite took the
step of questioning the entire concept
of European expansion.
In his own words, "I direct my efforts
not... to shut the gates of justification
and annul the sovereignty of the Kings
of Castile; but I shut the gate upon
false claims made on their behalf."
Las Casas (1550). Unfortunately any
claim at all had to be bolstered up by
slave labour, and so Las Casas, since
he accepted the claim and wished to
free the Indians, argued instead for the
replacement of Indian slaves by African
slaves. (Bartholom√© de Las Casas to
the Council of the Indies, Jan. 20, 1531).
To say that other people too had
argued for it is beside the point. Las
Casas in 1531 asked for "Negro" slaves
in spite of the fact that already in 1511,
Ferdinand I, King of Spain, had written
to Hispaniola the following: "I do not
understand why so many Negroes have
died: take good care of them". While
for Latin Americans then Las Casas
remains the champion of rights, to some
of us in the Caribbean, descendants of
African slaves, he remains the symbol
of the extent to which ecclesiastical
sophistry went to protect colonisation,
and the extent to which "Negroes"
were excluded from any rights at all.
As it turned out Las Casas did not
prevent the mass genocide of Indians
in the Caribbean; he did not prevent
the encomiendas or the confiscation of
lands in the rest of Latin America
and he did add his prestigious voice
to those who gave the Infamous African
slave trade an air of Christian morality.

AMATEUR SCIENTISTS
THE WORLD OVER
Sir.
All over the world there are amateur
scientists, individuals and groups who
are studying the world in which we live
simply for the joy it gives them. Some
belong to field groups who study insects,
plants, birds or animals. Others explore
the geological history of their own
environment. There are amateur astro¬¨
nomers, like us, who find our fun in
studying the sky.
It seems to me that you could do a
very good issue using the work of
individuals and groups who study nature
for the love of It and often make
valuable contributions to scientific
knowledge in the process.
There is a young man in Japan who
with a telescope on the roof of his
house discovered a comet a few years
ago. There is Patrick Moore in England
with his regular TV programme called
"The Sky at Night". There is a newly
formed Federation of Astronomical
Societies In the U.K., and hundreds of
folk taking part in a regular count of
the meteors both sporadic and in
showers under the auspices of the
British Meteor Society. There is a
watch for fireballs being done using
cameras with fish eye lens attachments,
also organized by amateurs here, though
the work is done in the Federal
Republic of Germany and the U.S.A. by
professionals. And I am only talking
about astronomy. Just think of all the
other sciences, geology, biology, eco¬¨
logy, radio, botany, entomology, etc.

BOTANICAL ENIGMAS
OF THE PAMIRS
Sir,
I read with interest the letters you
received from readers regarding my
article on botanical enigmas of the
Pamirs (November 1974 issue). These
responses (February 1975 letters page)
show that the work being done by the
Pamirs biologists and the importance
of the research carried on in this
remote country is widely 'appreciated.
I am especially grateful to these
readers for their pertinent comments
and remarks, such as the need for
monitoring soil radiation and the
intensity of cosmic rays, which is of>
course being done in the Pamirs Bio¬¨
logical Institute, a very young research
establishment set up only a few years
ago. In my article I wrote only about
what had already been achieved, for
scientists prefer not to talk about
experiments that have not thus far
brought tangible results.
But I did mention the contacts that are
maintained between the Pamirs bio¬¨
logists and physicists from the Moscow
Institute of Atomic Energy, who have
been investigating cosmic rays in the
Pamirs. I believe that in the near future
we shall hear more about the amazing
work of the Pamirs' scientists.

OUR POISONED SEAS
Sir.
I strongly disagree with Lidi Borovik,
who thinks your readers would be
interested to know exactly how pol¬¨
lution of the seas is bringing disease
and death to fish ("Letters to the
Editor", June 1975).
I think it would be more useful to
draw attention to the ineffectiveness of
big international conferences in pre¬¨
venting such pollution. In ten years
time, the Mediterranean, the Baltic and
the Adriatic will be dead seas, and I
don't think that Lake Baikal or the
Caspian Sea are in any better condition.
Until a strong supra-national authority
is set up to enforce anti-pollution
measures, Increasing areas of the
world's oceans will continue to die.
But we must not expect the politicians
to hand over control to an authority
of this kind; their main preoccupation.
economic growth, does not favour non-
polluting industries.

MOSCOW'S HOSPITAL
FOR DAMAGED PAINTINGS
Sir,
I was fascinated by your article and
photos about the fate of the paintings
by the 17th-century Spanish artist Fran¬¨
cisco de Zurbaran (September 1974
issue). Indeed, works of art have some¬¨
times unusual destinies as they move
along with time and travel from conti¬¨
nent to continent.
Last summer I was lucky to see ano¬¨
ther Zurbaran, St. Justa. It was shown
at the U.S.S.R. Academy of Arts in
Moscow among other paintings exhi¬¨
bited to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of the All-Russia Artistic and Scientific
Restoration Centre, founded in 1944 and
named after Academician Igor Grabar.
The exhibition displayed some 400
works restored in recent years and the
painting of St. Justa by Zurbaran open¬¨
ed up the exhibition her delicate
and gentle features appeared on posters
in Moscow's streets and on invitation
cards.
The war was still raging when Soviet
art restorers set about the job of saving
war-damaged art treasures. Since then
they have given new life to many
thousands of works both from Soviet
and other countries' museums. They
also helped to restore sculpture damag¬¨
ed during the 1968 floods In Florence.
I believe the All-Russia Restoration
Centre's Interesting work, its assistance
to museums in the U.S.S.R. and other
countries, its research, etc. all deserve
to be widely known.

WHEN THE IRISH
BEGAN TO EAT SEAWEED
Sir,
The back cover of your May 1975
issue carried a photograph entitled
"Seaweed in the Soup", depicting a
Japanese girl enjoying a bowl of
"Wakame".
Unlike the Japanese, who consider
seaweed a great food delicacy, the
Irish were driven to consuming such
nourishment when there was little else
left for them to eat during the terrible
famine which swept Ireland during the
last century and the great poverty
which ensued.
This "delicacy" Is still consumed on
the South-West Atlantic coast of
Ireland although needless to say it is
no longer the staple diet; most of the
haul nowadays goes to the iodine
factories.
The Irish, incidentally, were too poor
to elaborate ways of growing seaweed
like the Japanese. It was and still is
gathered up on the rough Atlantic
beaches by local people with their
donkey carts.
