'Outside of the United States, S 1.
WE took advantage, the otherday, of a recess in Unesco's
General Conference, to stroll
down to the Seine where two
different exhibitions of children's
paintings were open to the public.
The first, organized by the Marsh-
all Plan (ECA) is presenting the
work of children from every
country in Western Europe, while
the second shows"Paris Seen by
its Schoolchildren", arranged as
part of the French capital's 2000th-
year Festival. Both exhibitions, we
noted, are drawing large crowds of
children, often accompanied by
their teachers, as well as curious or
interested adults.
We particularly liked the atmo-
sphere in both buildings. Unlike
the calm, hushed silence so charac-
teristic of most painting exhibits,
the halls here were filled with the
loud piping voices of the youngsters
expressing their admiration of the
paintings they found specially
good, or shouting their condemna-
tion of those they deemed
unworthy.
This interest in children's art is
growing in other countries too. In
recent weeks, for example, we
have been informed of similar
exhibitions arranged in Austria,
Germany and Great Britain. The
International Youth Library of
Munich has prepared an art
exhibition of self-portraits by chil-
dren of different countries ; the
Austrian National Commission for
Unesco has organized an exhibition
of children's paintings which have
come all the way from Japan ;
Norway has recently issued an
unusual picture book of the City
of Oslo made up entirely of
children's water colours.
During July, art teachers from
many countries are meeting at a
Unesco Seminar in Bristol, Eng-
land, to study new ways in which
the arts can be used to enrich a
child's general education and serve
to foster international understand-
ing. This is a fascinating and
relatively little known aspect of
Unesco's work, we feel, and we
have therefore devoted a major
portion of this number to the
subject.
The big event in international
co-operation through education
and science during June and July
was, without doubt, Unesco's Gene-
ral Conference, the sixth in the
Organization's history as a Spe-
cialized Agency of the United
Nations. We have before us on
our desk a huge pile of newspaper
and magazine cuttings in various
languages on this conference which
have reached us from many parts
of the world.
The editorial commentaries, as
well as the general coverage given
to the proceedings and discussions,
show clearly that Unesco has
emerged considerably strengthened
from the General Conference, that
the former period of groping and
searching has now ended, and that
Unesco has now acquired the ma-
turity and experience to enable it
to pursue a continuous and
methodical course or action.
A number of newspapers, it is
true, are still skeptical or even
bitingly denonciatory. One such
paper, the London Daily Express,
dismisses Unesco in these words :
"Unesco is having another confe-
rence, this time in Paris. The
cloud of culture-mongers settles on
the boulevards, the aperitifs flow
. happily, and from the babel of
tongues emerge still more plans for
spending United Nations money-
much of it your money."
The answer to the Daily Express
has come from another Fleet Street
newspaper the Daily Mail. In an
article entitled"Tuppence Travels
Right Round the World", this
paper wrote on July 11 :
"Would you spend tuppence to
ensure that fewer Turkish houses
collapse in earthquakes, fewer
Egyptians die of cholera, and more
Guatemalans read and write ?
Well, you have spent the tuppence.
That is Britain's annual per capita
contribution to the high-minded,
faintly cranky, and frequently
abused concern known as Unesco...
And indeed, it is not hard to make
fun of it if you pick out the right
things. Is the British taxpayer
really interested, you may ask, in
financing a Human Rights Week in
Japan... or changing the mentality
of the inhabitants of the Mexquital
Valley in Mexico ?
"But before you decide you would
rather have spent your tuppence
on something different, pause and
consider what else you get for your
money. Seeing that it only has
8, 000, 000 dollars a year to spend in
all, Unesco spreads its activities
incredibly widely...
"Unesco starts out from UNO
conception that the world is one
world, and that, in the long run,
what concerns one concerns all.
So that what would once have been
considered officious meddling is
now justifiable as long-term self-
preservation..
"Education, for Instance. In
another age, the fact that half the
population of the world could not
read or write would not have in-
terested the other half. Today, via
Unesco, it certainly does... And this
basic education is not just charity.
It matters to everyone. The
world's population increases by
50, 000 a day. But the food supply
hardly increases at all. If the
world is to be fed, these backward
parts of the globe must be pressed
into service.
"'That is another of Unesco's
chores. Its scientists and engin-
eers, in a conference at Algiers,
have. got out a programme for
reclaiming dustbowls and deserts
and making them bloom like roses.
It can be done. But it won't be
done unless someone-Unesco for
instance-takes the initiative.
"It has accelerated enormously
the flow of scientific knowledge
which might otherwise Ylave got
bogged down in some laõoratory
or university... It l}. a8 got out a
coupon scheme shat anyone can
buy foreign scientific literature
regardless of currency restrictions...
"It has, perhaps, got its cranky
aspects. Its employees are rather
highly paid (but you don't get ex-
perts cheaply these days). Its
conferences (which are usually in
Paris, but have also been in Mexico
City, Beirut and Florence) do
sometimes seem a little lavish and
academic. But it is still probably
as good a twopenny-worth as you
can buy these days."
We'd like to quote some passages
from just one more editorial which
we feel typifies the attitude of most
newspapers and magazines nowa-
days. The New York Times, in
an editorial entitled"Unesco's
Pilot Plant"had this to say on
July 6 :
"Twenty million dollars, spread
over twelve years and six far-flung
areas, doesn't seem like much
money in these days. Yet, spent
as the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
tion plans to spend it, this sum can
leave its mark on the lives of
countless millions of human beings.
Unesco, meeting in Paris, has un-
animously endorsed a plan for'a
world-wide drive against illiteracy
and low living standards.'
"Specifically, it proposes to set up
educational centres in Latin Ameri-
ca, the Far East, Equatorial Africa,
the Near East, and South-east
Asia, in which teachers will be
trained for work in the field.
"The present project comes out of
the pioneer work of Dr. Jaime
Torres Bodet, former Minister of
Education in Mexico, now Director-
General of Unesco. Dr. Torres
Bodet attempted a'simultaneous
attack on illiteracy, ill-health and
soil erosion'-three of the basic
causes of rural poverty. Unesco is
now in a position to extend this
attack to all sectors of the earth
where its representatives are
allowed to operate. Several hun-
dred trained recruits a year, each
one capable of training others, will
go into this bloodless battle against
misery.
"The drama in this adventure is
not the drama of drums and
trumpets. But what if projects
like these save multitudes from
blindness or death, what if many
who have always been hungry
learn how to produce enough to
eat, what if a little light shines for
those who have been living in
medieval ignorance ! Unesco's
$20, 000, 000 and twelve years will
not bring these blessings to all who
need them, but the new pro-
gramme is at least what Dr. Torres
Bodet called his Mexican experi-
ment-a'pilot plant', a land-
mark on the road toward a happier
future."

### 74598: The 1951 General Conference of UNESCO: "a meeting of great decisions"

JULY-AUGUST) 1951 Page 3-UNESCO COURIER
THE 1951 GENERAL CONFERENCE OF UNESCO
"VA MEE, TING OF GREAT DECISIONS"
UNESCO'S 1951 General Confe-
rence has ended. Has it
accomplished anything really
worthwhile and meaningful for
the peoples of the world ? Speak-
ing at a press conference, imme-
diately after the close of the final
plenary session on July 11, Mr. How-
land H. Sargeant (United States
delegation head and president of
the conference) told radio and
newsmen that'''thi. s Sixth General
Conference of Unesco has been one
of great decisions, marked by the
launching of what I expect to be-
come one of the'extraordinary
projects'of Unesco-the world-
wide netwOrk of centres of funda-
mental education.
"Unesco has taken other deci-
sians at this conference", Mr. Sar-
geant added,"shawing clearly that
it is now ready, willing and able to
go into action when hostilities
cease or when peace is threatened.
A striking example is the approval
by the General Conference of a re-
solution which calls for Unesco to
be prepared, at the request of ECO-
SOC'to assist... the. action of the
United Nations either to maintain
peace in areas where conflicts are
liable to arise, or, after the cessa-
tion of hastilities, to'restare the
normal life of national communi-
ties in areas subject to such con-
flicts'. We can take pride in the
significance of Unesco's declared
intention to be ready to assist the
United Nations at a time when the
peace is in danger.
"Today, with the cease-fire ne-
gotia tJons in Korea fresh in the
minds of all of us, we of course
recognize the significance of Unes-
co's action in aiding schools and
providing teachers and educational
resources in Korea.
"This develops a new action
front for Unesco. It does not re-
place the basic programme and
tasks of Unesco, but it demons-
trates that the organizations is
alive, that Unesco has the resour-
ces, energy, and the will to help
its parent organization, the Uni-
ted Nations, in a time of emer-
gency and contribute effectively to
peace and security for all the na-
tions of the world."
U Truly International"
AMONG some of the other im-partant lessOns brOught Out
by the Conference, one in
particular must be recognized-
the progress made in increasing the
numerical strength of Unesco's
Member States.
A world organizations dedicated
to the social and spiritual defence
of peace and to the service of cul-
ture in its widest sense must keep
on growing ; in fact, it cannot
fully accompish its mission with-
out the collaboration of all coun-
tries.
However self-evident this may
appear, it is a fact that takes on
special significance in the light of
existing political threats and un-
rest in the world. Conference de-
legates were emphatic on this
point."'Unesco,"said Mr. How-
land H. Sargeant,"should clearly
remain as a truly international
agency dedicated to the attainment
of peace and security for all man-
kind."
Further progress was made in
the realization of this ideal, in this
march toward universality, when
the Conference admitted to mem-
bership five more States : Cam-
bodia, the Federal Republic of Ger-
many, Japan, Laos and Vietnam.
All five have since ratified the
Unesco Constitution at the British
Foreign Office, thus bringing Unes-
co's membership to 64 countries.
Yet it is not only in 64 countries
that Unesco's work must be carried
on in future, for the Conference
also decided to admit non-self-go-
verning territories or groups of ter-
ritories as associate members of
the Organization. The statute for
these associate members has been
drawn up, and their active parti-
cipation should now lead to far-
reaching development of Unesco's
work, especially in Africa.
However, to be effective, this
universality must be based on
each nation's possibilities. This i. s
why Unesco's programme, as ap-
proved by the Conference, aims
more and more to meet a variety
of needs by adapting itself to the
different capabilities of each coun-
try.
Strengthening Links
IT was natural that the Confer-ence, to counter-balance the
growth of membership, and in
order to ensure the unity of the
Organization, should call for a
strengthening of the means of liai-
son between Member States and the
Secretariat. Unfortunately, the
majority of the National Commis-
sions (whose function is to assure
this liaison) are not yet in a posi-
tion to do so adequately. It is
therefore planned to set up a net-
work of Unesco Regional offices,
starting in areas furthest away
from Paris. These will benefit
from the experience gained by the
Regional Office for the Western
Hemisphere now operating in Ha-
vana, and the scientific co-opera-
tion centres set up by Unesco in
Cairo, New Delhi, Manila, Jakarta
and Montevideo.
To the effects of this co-opera-
tive plan to unify efforts by the
various countries must be added
those of the work done by non-
governmental organizations which
bring together specialists in various
activities within Unesco's fields, or
representatives of groups particu-
larly concerned in its work.
In this way the General Confe-
rence has defined more specifically
than ever before the structure of
Unesco.
The Boldest Programme
IT is, however, the decisionstaken by the Conference on
the main tasks of Unesco that
have made the 1952 programme the
baldest and most carefully consi-
dered that the Organization has
ever had. This has been well
brought home to the man in the
street, who has followed with spe-
cial interest the work of the
Conference and in particular that
relating to the Special Project in
Fundamental Education.
Before this project had even
taken form, Unesco had already
drawn attention to a problem that
too many people seemed to have
forgotten. In the 20th century
which awes its achievements to
knowledge, and technical progress,
it is industrial development, link-
ed to education, which gives man
the prospect of living fully and
developing his abilities to the full.
But how can these ambitions for
a better life be reconciled with the
terrible inequalities which separate
the privileged peoples from the less
favoured ?
There are 1, 200, 000, 000 illiterates
in the world, people who remain
ignorant of the simplest of tech-
niques, people who are excluded
from the progress of which this
century should be proud. This
figure not only represents ignor-
ance, but in a similar measure,
ill-heath, hunger and misery. The
teaching methods which Unesco
will use to grapple with this pro-
blem are therefore not those of the
primary school-for how could
millions of schools be founded
immediately and where could the
millions of teachers who would be
needed at short notice be found ?
No, the answer is to be found in
Fundamental EducatiO'n-educ-
action which tries to give both
adults and children a minimum of
general knowledge that will enable
them to overcome the obstacles
which so cripplingly limit their
progress and that of their commu-
nity. The new Unesco Funda-
mental Education Praject can
achieve what isolated efforts in
the past could never hope to do ;
but it will use the experience they
gained, such as in the difficult
experiment in the Marbial Valley
of Haiti.
The Fundamental Education pro-
ject is a 12-year plan to provide
training centres in six areas-
Equatorial Africa, Latin America,
India, the Middle East, the Far
East and South-East Asia. Using
the most modern methods, these
centres will train teachers who will
then return to their own countries
to set up national centres.
At the end of this 12-year
period, 4, 200 specialists will have
been provided, each one capable of
organizing in the most under-
developed territories a complete
form of education, from teaching
the alphabet to hygiene, from
household techniques to rural
industries. The first centre is
already in operation at Patzcuaro,
Mexico. The second will be set up
this year, and seven countries have
asked for it to be on their territory.
This, in outline, is the plan which
a commentator has described as
"audacious and practical."It cer-
tainly strikes the imagination.
A Common Objective
THE programme which theGeneral Conference has ap-
proved is not just a lining-up
of projects, but a balanced entity
in which different techniques
are used to reach a common
objective. Education, interna-
tional co-operation, mutual assis-
tance-none of these can be
considered by itself. Whether they
refer to the efforts of pioneers in
under-developed areas or the
provision of mutual aid between
groups of specialists, their common
objective, in the final analysis,
must clearly be the consolidation
of peace through the respect of
human rights.
While each delegation wished to
make the 1952 programme as
widely effective as possible, the
limiting factor of budgetary expen-
diture made the Conference decide
to give priority to education. It is
noteworthy that the countries
which urged this priority most
strongly were those which already
have a high level of education and
which will therefore not benefit
themselves from the money ex-
pended on educational projects.
In the field of workers'education,
the Conference asked Unesco to set
up in the Paris area an interna-
tional centre to train specialists
and improve methods of teaching
about world affairs. Unesco will,
as in 1951, continue to put missions
of experts at the disposition of
States to help revise or improve
their educational systems. Among
many other educational under-
takings already started and now
to be extended, there is room here
(Continued on next page)
moved from the Arc de Triomphe
quarter of Paris to a section near
the Eiffel Tower on the Left Bank.
This was announced by the 1951
General Conference of Unesco fol-
lowing an offer made by the French
Government ceding an area of
335, 000 square feet of land for the
construction of permanent head-
quarters to house the international
Secretariat of Unesco. Speaking for
hi-Goverment M. Olivier Lapie,
French MiniSter of Education, in-
formed the Unesco Conference that
France was making available an
interest-free loan of 2. 025, 000. 000
francs (5, 800. 000 dollars} to help
Unesco erect the new building,
which will be constructed at the
Place Fontenoy (shown here) in
the Ecole Militaire district of the
capital. Contruction work is to
begin in about one year from now
and is expected to be completed 18
months later. Under this schedule,
the new Unesco headquarters will
be ready ior occupation by the end
01 april 1954.

### 74598: The 1951 General Conference of UNESCO: "a meeting of great decisions"

UNESCO COURtER-Page 4
\\ A MEETING OF GREAT DECISIONS"
(Continued from previous port)
to mention only a few main ones :
the revision of history and geo-
graphy textbooks, action in support
of women's education, and teaching
the rights of man. Unesco's work
on behalf of youth movements will
cons1st next year of giving further
help to organizations which encou-
rage international contacts, and
try to develop the moral and intel-
lectual solidarity of mankind.
,
The Right To Culture
THE main lines of Unesco's
cultural activities have al-
ready been laid down in past
years : the furthering of world
intellectual co-operation, the pre-
servation of man's cultural herit-
ages and the assurance of protec-
tion to writers and artists. But
for 1952 the General Conference
has given them more precision.
Unesco is to assist and subsidize
up to a total of 167, 440 dollars, a
number of important international
organizations, such as the Interna-
tional Council for Philosophy and
Humanistic Studios, the Interna-
tional Theatre Institute, the Inter-
national Music Council and the
International Council of Museums.
These organizations, whose mem-
bers include the most outstanding
figures in learning and the arts,
will thu. s be able to carry out stu-
dies and publish the results as
well as produce other works which
their normal finances would pre-
vent them from doing. Unesco is
also to convene next year a meeting
of thinkers, scientists and writers
in Geneva, and an international
conference of artists in Venice.
The diffusion of culture received
special consideration at the Con-
ference. Emphasis in the 1952 pro-
gramme ori the artistic education
of the general public is largely due
to efforts by the United Kingdom
and the United States. Literary
exchangers, through the translation
of classics have been given a lead-
ing place, and the efforts of
Unesco in this work will concern
masterpieces in Arab, Persian, Ita-
lian and Latin-American litera-
ture.
Science For Mankind
IN the same way as it works inco-operation with artists and
writers, Unesco will also work
for and with men of science. A
total of 218, 000 dollars will be
allocated in 1952, in the form of
subventions or service contracts., to
scientific organizations which in-
clude the International Council of
Scientific Unions, the International
Union for the Protection of Nature
and the International Union of
Mathematics.
Unesco will also increase its
efforts on behalf of international
institutes of scientific research.
It has already been decided to
strengthen the International Arid
Zone Research Council, which is to
take part in a world-wide effort to
check the encroachment of desert
conditions and soil erosion, and to
establish an International Compu-
tation Centre at a forthcoming
international conference to be held
in Paris. (See page 13,)
Emphasizing that all scientific
progress should contribute to the
improvement of living conditions
of mankind, the Conference also
decided that Unesco should carry
out a world survey of research
institutes and laboratories to study
what contributions they can bring
to the solution of modern economic
and social problems.
While the natural sciences can
help in the field of social problems,
the solution of these depends more
specifically on other specialized
studies and methods and, directed
as they are towards the study of
the behaviours of human groups,
the social sciences are more capable
than any others of helping the
modern world to resolve its diffi-
culties and problems.
Unesco's action is resolutely
aimed towards action in the cause
of peace, and here the Social Scien-
ces can make an important contri-
bution. This conviction was ex-
pressed in a resolution which pro-
vides for Unesco to collaborate
with United Nations'action desi-
gned (a) to preserve peace in areas
where a conflict is threatening and
(b) to restore normal life in terri-
tories where fighting has stopped.
Beyond Politics
THE resolution was voted with
all the more enthusiasm
since delegates immediately
saw the prospect of its being ap-
plied to Korea. The delegates of
Brazil, France and the United Sta-
tes expressed the general feeling
when they stressed that action of
this sort went beyond any political
implications. An objective analy-
sis of the facts, carried out in an
impartial spirit, is needed to
enlighten governments and public
opinion, and so track down and
prevent the causes of war.
Unesco will also continue its
work of trying to eliminate racial
prejudice and discrimination. It
will publish the results of the latest
scientific research on the subject,
while carrying out on the spot
investigations of conditions which
enable harmonious relations to
be established between different
ethnic groups. It is also proposed
to survey practical means of
removing social tensions of all
kinds.
If the Social Sciences are to be
fruitfully applied to modern world
problems, they must have efficient
international machinery and sound
working equipment. The co-opera-
tion of scientists of all nations
and the pooling of their discoveries
is a basic requirement of progress.
Rehabilitation Work
THE activities which have sofar been briefly described are
all designed to achieve their
effects progressively over a certain
period of time. There are, how-
ever, conditions which require
immediate relief action.
An important part of Unesco's
rehabilitation programme, for
example, is to be devoted to edu-
cation assistance in Korea while
educational assistance to Arab
refugee children in the Middle East
will be continued. This latter
work, started in 1949, has resulted
in the opening by Unesco of 114
schools for 44, 000 children in
refugee camps.
Another major activity-the
Coupons Programme-will be
developed. Under the Unesco Gift
Coupon Scheme, money collected
by organizations through the sale
of stamps is transferred into gift
coupons which are then sent by
the purchasing group to a rehabi-
litation project it has chosen.
Other Unesco coupons enable
people and institutions in soft-
currency countries to purchase
books, films and scientific equip-
ment in hard currency countries
while paying for them in their own
money.
The above round-up of the
programme approved by the Gene-
ral Conference is too short to
allow mention of many other
activities whose full importance
will only be revealed as they
develop in the months ahead. Just
the same, it has been sufficient to
show the immense variety of tasks
which fall to Unesco and, at the
same time, to illustrate that variety
does not necessarily mean dis-
persion.
A central idea uniting these dif-
ferent objectives was well summ-
ed up by the delegate of the
United States when he said :
"Unesco must turn to the tasks
which will help attain peace and
security, social and economic pro-
gress for all the peoples of the
world."Thus, for example, the
special project in fundamental
education which represents the
most immediate answer to this
need, also. helps to bring out in its
fullest sense the true spirit of
Unesco's Constitution.
Each delegation spoke in support
of this interpretation of the mis-
sion of Unesco which, as an orga-
nization, has now acquired matu-
rity and experience and is fully
conscious of its responsibilities.
This conception was expressed by
Mgr. Jean Maroun (Lebanon)
when he said,"Unesco looks
TEN MAJOR POINTS OF UNESCO'S
1952 PROGRAMME
1. A world-wide campaign
against illiteracy and low-
living standards. A network
of international fundamen-
tal education centres to train
specialized teachers and pre-
pare reading and visual ma-
terials. First centre-at Patz-
cuaro. Mexico-opened in May
1951 to be enlarged to receive
additional 100 students ; second
centre to be established in an-
other part of the world.
2. A world campaign for free
and compulsory primary edu-
cation. Special 1952 target :
South East Asia.

education. 1952 target : more
trained leaders in this field.
Unesco will set up International
Adult Education Centre specially
geared to workers'education.
4. Strengthening of international
scientific research institutes.
Special 1952 targets : world
campaign to fight increasing
desert zones and soil erosion
through the International Arid
Zone Council ; provide nations
with facilities for using compli-
cated, costly machines known as
"electronic brains"and promote
research in this field through
the establishment of Internatio-
nal Computation Centre.
5. Broad investigation into social
repercussions of technical de-
velopment and adaptation need-
ed by peoples so that technology
will not destroy the cultural
heritage. 1952 target areas :
Africa, South East Asia.
6. Social, economic investigations,
public opinion surveys to study
ways of maintining peace in
the world's danger tension
areas and help normalcy in

7. Work will begin on a Scientific
and Cultural History of Mankind
bearing witness to fundamental
unity of men everywhere in
conquest of knowledge and in
the arts. International Com-
mission of 51 members from 25
countries will collaborate.
8. After three years'preparatory
work, a Universal Copyright
Convention will be drawn up in
1952, marking one of the most
valuable achievements of Unesco.

and private and public institu-
tions.
clearly and confidently towards the
future ; its new programme con-
tains a message which is clearer
and more eloquent for being a
message of action."
Several delegations affirmed that
this effectiveness will be achieved
only through action and certainly
not by theoretical discussions.
"We believe", said M. Ribnikar
(Yugoslavia)"that peace is, after
all, possible. Experience has shown
to us that if men do not always
agree on a common ideological
ground, they often succeed in
achieving a community of spirit on
practical conceptions."
Speaking on behalf of the Indian
delegation, Shri Kalam Azad de-
clared :"If any hope is left, it is in
Unesco, for it is only through
intellectual understanding and
sympathy that we may yet avert
the disaster which otherwise threa-
tens to engulf the whole of
humanity in one common ruin.
Economic and political agreement
will only be achieved if cultural
agreement already exists."
Mr. Hector McNeil, Secretary of
State for Scotland, was warmly
applauded when he remarked that,
although until recently the senior
servants of Unesco had taken the
major part in shaping the Orga-
nization's programme, a greater
part of the responsibility. had been
taken over this year by the dele-
gates."We want to see the
Conference making itself respon-
sible for the success or lack of
success of the programme", he
added.
What Can Unesco Do ?
THIS responsibility which fallsto each Member State was
emphasized by M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-
General, in his closing address.
After outlining the different aspects
of the work accomplished by the
Conference, the Director-General
examined both the future of this
work and of the Organization
itself.
"What can Unesco do ?", he
asked.'''Direct action not merely
postulates technique and tools.
It also requires above all men and
money. The men-by which I
mean the experts-are hardly
enough to go round. At least
Unesco can collect and mobilize
the available ability and goodwill,
and it has resolutely applied itself
to the task of increasing the num-
ber and improving the quality of
candidates for this work, and of
training them in ever-increasing
numbers.
"There remains the question of
finance. That is where, for three
years, Unesco has been brought to
a standstill. It will come one day
to the point where it must either
surmount this obstacle or give up
altogether... For the first time,
the contributions of the majority
of Member States have decreased.
I think it my duty to warn the
General Conference very seriously
of the danger of taking this as a
precedent for the future."
Wise Proverb
AFTER showing that thebudget was not large enough
to cover all that the
Organization was capable of doing,
nor to supply all the services
which the Member States had
a right to expect, M. Torres
Bodet declared :"You cannot give
with one hand and take away with
the other. If there was ever an
institution to which that old, wise
and sensible proverb applies it is
indeed Unesco as you yourselves
have created and defined it : an
Organiz ; ; l. tion made for the eman-
cipation of the mind, for education
in peace, and to be the apes. tile of
human rights. One cannot give
with one hand in the programme
and take away with the other in
the budget."
Ending his speech, M. Torres
Bodet reminded delegates that they
would be meeting at the next
Conference in Paris in November,
1952."I hope with all my heart...
that we shall meet in peace", he
said. Emphasizing once again
that the success of the-work to be
undertaken would require the re-
doubling of faith, tenacity and
enthusiasm, he said,"Unesco is not
a luxury designed for easy times.
For my part I have always thought
of it as a fieroic effort, and it is
in the most difficult days that the
world has the greatest need of
it."

### 74597: Children as creative artists

JULY-AUGUST 95) Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
CHILDREN ARE CREATIVE ARTISTS
BUT THEY NEED FREEDOM IN ORDER TO
EXPRESS THEIR IDEAS IN THEIR OWN WAY
How many proud parents looking at someexample of contemporary art, have been
known to observe that their child could
do better than that. The obvious answer then
is"why not let them ?" For even well-meaning
parents and teachers find it hard to allow
children to express their natural creative ima-
ginations without interference. Grown-ups
have their ideas of what they approve as"art"
and they try to impose them on children.
Probably more Children in the world today
suffer from not being allowed to give creative
expression to their feelings than from physical
cruelty. Although much has been achieved in
the past few decades to liberate art education,
much more remains to be done. Official
svstems of education need to be revised.
Individual attitudes towards children and the
arts must be changed.
Although child prodigies of painting are rare
and Mozarts of the brush few and far between,
it might well be that many children would
become future artists if parents did not spoil
it all by saving, for example,"Now let daddy
show you how to draw a train,"
thus at once undermining the
child's confidence in himself and
frustrating his desire to show his
own ideas. It is this adult desire to
show off by explaining how, that
so often nips in the bud the poss-
ible creative genius of the unspoilt
child.
This kind of adult attitude is
well illustrated by the story of the
small boy who one day came home
and puzzled his parents by b) untiy
announcing that he wasn't going to
school any more."But why ?" he
was asked, since he had always
loved school. That day, he ex-
plained, had been"the drawing
lesson"and the teacher had told
them to draw a fish. But he had
drawn a boat ; so when the teacher
saw what he had done she punished
him because he had not drawn a
fish."But I didn't want to draw a
fish... I wanted to draw a boat."
Unfortunately it is not always the
unenlightened teacher who fails to
see things from the child's point of
view.

order to give tangible expression to the emo-
tional forces within and to satisfy their urge
for communication.
It is the gradual recognition, in the light of
psychological discoveries, of the importance of
that need to communicate, and its value for the
whole growth of human personality which has
charaeterized the change of attitudes upon the
part of teachers and parents towards art
education. The change has been two-fold, on
the one hand involving the prestige of the arts
as subjects which should be taught and on the
other directed towards different methods of
teaching the arts. Formerly, the arts were
regarded either as decorative accomplishments
for young persons of leisure, to be taught less
seriously out of school, or as technical skills
necessary to equip young people for industry,
to be taught drearily within school hours. The
change-over of the past fifty years has been
eharacterized by a swing from an emphasis on
technique to the current emphasis on creative
I ? OR instance, I remember visitingthe children's art group in a
progressive art gallery. The young
teacher, a recent convert to the
"new art education", first showed
the children colour slides of works
by Braque, Picasso and Matisse.
then close their eyes while she
played a record by Stravinsky.
Then they were told to open their
eyes and, as the record was played
again, to use their big brushes on
big sheets of paper wit !)"iots of
lovely colours". Naturally, most of
the children produced echoes of the
slides they had just seen, except
one small boy who drew a lively-
looking house with masses of smoke
pouring out of the chimney. The
teacher looked at him reproach-
futiy, saying,"But Johnny, why did
you do that... you know I told you today was
abstract day. *'
Neither of those extreme attitudes, both fun-
damentally wrong in their attempts to impose
ideas on the children, would be regarded today
as the best modes of child art education. But
just what is meant now by the term'''ant edu-
cation" ? Surely we all did drawing at school
when we were young and there was not all
this fuss about what we did and why we did it ?
Jt is true that there has always been some
form of child art wherever there has been any
kind of education. Yet while the children's
innate artistic abilities have remained the
same, the attitudes towards them have chang-
ed considerably, not a little affected by trends
and fashions in adult art appreciation. Some-
thing of a minor revolution in methods of art
for children has taken place in the past half
century.
P OSSIDLY one of the best. forms of art educa-tion occurs in those simple communities
where children watch and imitate their mothers
making baskets and pottery or their fathers
working in metal and carving in wood. woe
may hazard a guess that prehistoric children
tried their hands at cave paintings, dipping
their fingers in the pigment and making those
marks we now admire so much. Every child
given materials suitable for making a mark
will quickly leave his mark, as most parents
know to their chagrin, usually on new) y paint-
ed wafts. And if suitable materials arse not
accessible, it is astonishing the ingenuity most
children show in making unsuitable things
such as sand and stones and milk from their
pudding, serve their compelling purpose in
expression. In education generally, the former
bias towards intellectual book-learning has
given place to approval of educative experience
which has meanlllg for the child rather than
for the teacher. And art education plays an
increasingly important part in meaningful
experience. Education which is enjoyable,
which involves learning by doing, is proved to
be more effective than knowledge which is
drummed in by rote.
THOSE die-hards who believe that to sparethe rod spoils the child, that school-days
should be spent in being grounded in reading,
writin and arithmetic, naturally look with
suspicion if not active disapproval on these
newer art education methods. Do these new
approaches mean that the teacher can just give
the children plenty of art materials and then
sit back to make up the attendance register or
write home to mother ? On the contrary. It
was the methods of making children copy a
copy of a stereotyped design, or of setting up
for'drawing those formidable arrays of chem-
ical apparatus and those dreary combinations
of cones, cubes and cylinders, which demanded
least of the indifferent or over-burdened
teacher.
The contemporary art teacher, trained as an
artist, pedagogue and psychologist, has by far
the more difficult task and must be as wise
and intuitive as a mother, endeavouring, as
far as any adult can, to enter into sympathetic
understanding of what the child is thinking
and feeling. He or she must be capable of
indicating objectives within the range of the
child's experience, guiding rather thus pushing
are some aspects of the aims andintentions of contemporary approaches to
art education which a number of specialist
teachers, coming from some twenty countries
of the world, will be studying at a Unesco
Seminar on the Visual Arts in Education
which is being held at the University of Bristol
in the United Kingdom from 7 to 27 July.
Fot months they have been preparing reports
on art education conditions in their own
countries and collecting representative example, ;
of children's painting which are to be shown
at an exhibition in Bristol during the Seminar.
From these national reports and drawings it
is possible to sketch a revealing
picture of what has been done and
of what is happening in the sphere
of art education. In some countries
the physical conditions of the
schools, the lack of suitable mate-
rials and, even more, the unsympa-
thetic and unenterprising attitude
of the educational authorities,
means that little in the way of
results can be seen. In other
countries, where the attitudes may
be progressive, the material re-
sources are not available as a
consequence of war devastation.
Fortunately, there are a few coun-
tries where attitudes and resources
are favourable and where especially
effective work is being produced
and where serious researches of
immense value are being conducted.
The value of the first Unesco
Seminar in the field of the visual
arts is that it will enable people
coming from countries at all these
various levels of development, to
meet together, to share their
experiences and knowledge to their
mutual advantage, and to consider
new ways in which the arts can in-
crease international understanding.
school master who, in asmall village school in France,
found that the arts solved his
problem of how to teach all of his
ten pupils, ranging from four to
fourteen, in the confines of one
small classroom, will have some-
thing to tell and to learn from the
high-school teacher in Montreal
who has a modern, well-equipped
art room for her thirty pupils
who are all in the same age-group.
The Swiss who has sent in delicate
flower paintings, as precise as the
works of a watch, may find it
strange to compere notes with the
artist whose children Droduce such
boldly dashing designs in Paris. Perhaps the
teacher from Japan, with its ancient traditions
and modern techniques, will want to confer
with the administrator from Australia, where.
traditions are young and intentions ideal. Will
the teacher of those children in Norway wvho
have made such delightfully fresh, clean water-
colours want to try out the dirty clay so mag-
nificently modelled by the children in Egypt ?
So the exchanges will go on from one
country to another. Perhaps we are too
readily inclined to say that art is a universal
language ; but, as in other fields of international
co-operation, it is a language that must be
learned. Although there may be some basic
elements in child art that could be found
anywhere from northern snows to tropical
forests, the children of each nation produce
paintings that are uniquely and characteristic-
ally their own, individually and collectively.
That is one of the most desirable and
valuable aspects of art as a means of education
because, in an age of increasing standardization,
it allows the individual to develop as an in-
dividual, at spiritual and emotional levels,
within the framework of his own national
cultural pattern. Yet at the same time, it
nurtures in him a true sense of judgment, a
respect for the creative work of other people,
and an awareness of values which are universal
and imperishable. For in the long stern
judgment of centuries of time, a civilization
is remembered and the quality of its culture
is assessed not by reason of its political and
economic achievements but bv virtue of its
works of art. That is why every child has the
right to the opportunities for creative expres-
sion.

watching brief yet ready to encourage and give,
not impose, technical information when it is

merely for the sake of learning, but in order
to prepare for a life which may be lived with
judment and poise, with pleasure and partici-
paten, richly and welt.

TH E ARTS ARE NOT
JUST A PLEASANT
PASTIME
by Dr. Edwin ZIEGFELD,
Head, Department of Fine and Industrial Arts,
Teachers'College, Columbia University
ONE of the most significant discoveries of recenttimes is that all people are creative, that there
exist within each of us the potentialities for
artistic expression. The many illustrations on these
pages are eloquent testimony of the presence of that
trait among young people, for the examples are
not by specially gifted youngsters training to be
artists, but by children in the normal process of
growing up. These activities with art media pro-
vide them with essential means for developing into
emotionally-mature men and women who are
needed to cope with the problems of our twentieth-
century world.
Although the potentialities for creativity have
undoubtedly always existed in peoples, this had
never before been a pressing concern of education,
nor was there any particular necessity for it. Our
contemporary world, however, by its nature and
present condition, has made the development of
creative individuals essential and urgent. For,
increasingly, we live in a world in which it is dif-
ficult to maintain our individuality and stability.
Of the many factors that might be cited which
are complicating our existence, two appear most
important. First is the acceleration of mechani-
zation and technology. In industrialized centres
the labours of man to support himself have been
robbed of much or most of their dignity. Pride in
producing a product hardly exists since the part of
any one person is so insignificant. As a consumer
as well, he purchases and uses mass-produced com-
modities which may be exactly the same in Calcutta
or Chicago, in Anchorage or Capetown. A person
thus tends to lose his individuality and become a
cog in a machine and an anonymous consumer.
The parallel emphases on materialism which are
by-products of technology tend also to devalue the
emotional and the personal. The machine, imper-
sonal and insensitive, dominates our thinking and
our actions.
The second major factor is the present state of
world tension. Everywhere there are feverish pre-
parations against a war we hope will not be fought
and a large part of our money and energies are
diverted into channels for enormous destruction.
Never before have the demoralizing effects of uncer-
tainty and the disínteratlve effects of tension been
so widely prevalent.
These conditions and forces are a part of our
times and no one escapes them. Children, with
their particular sensitivity, are deeply affected, even
through they may not understand or even know of
the issues that form them.
It is being discovered all over the world that
children are responding to creative opportunities in
the arts with an almost fierce intensity. This is
true, not only of children but Qf adults as well. In
a world which devalues the individual they are
engaging in activities which develop the indivi-
dual : in a world which abounds in forces of disin-
tegration, they are demanding those activities which
make them whole.
Individuality and integration are two of the basic
characteristics of creative activity. Through it an
individual clarifies his world and his relation to it.
His experiences are deepened, intensi8ed, unified,
and most important, their meanings are made uni-
quely his own. Through dealing with things of
the senses, he himself becomes sensitive and emo-
tionally mature with an appreciation of human
values and feelings. The arts in life, then, are no
longer merely pleasant and superficial pastimes but
activities which are essential in our present world if
we are to maintain our dignity and integrity, our
wholeness and stability.

Tangible proof that he is a worthwhile person.
DO IT YOUR OWN WAY
by Georges Fradier
This ! s what) saw at the circus.
"YaU do not notice the beauty of the world.You do not notice the wonderful things
that make you grow strong and healthy.
If you would notice all these things, then you
would know the world and enjoy life better."
The author of these words is about twelve
years old. He took pains to form the letters,
but the words came spontaneously. He wrote
down freely and joyfully the ideas in his mind.
But, when the school year began, he had never
even given so much as a thought to the
"beauty of the world."For, living in the poor
districts of Los Angeles, this lyrical young
writer and his school friends know much more
about unemployment, alcoholism and end-of-
the-month quarre1s than the film producers in
nearby Hollywood who attempt to portray
"real life"on the screen.
These youngsters are also well acquainted
with what are called social and racial tensions,
although they have learned how to overcome
these forces of contempt and hate. Their
class at school is formed mainly of Chinese
and Mexicans ; there are also some Japanese,
and white and Negro Americans. But their
teacher did not give them any lectures on
racial and social relations ; instead, she made
them work, dance and sing together. She
taught them how to write and to paint
together. Above all, she showed them the
meaning of confidence and friendship-
without favouritism, without exceptions,
Mrs. Natalie Robinson Cole, the teacher in
question, has now told the story of her work
with these children in a simply written book
entitled :"The Arts in the Classroom."It
is a moving work because it shows the arts and
especially painting being discovered rather
than taught.
"A teacher can't force fine painting down
children's throats", she writes."She must be
content to open them up by getting and hold-
ing their liking and respect. Good children's
painting comes as a result of a rapport estab-
lished and the feeling that the teacher has
faith that they can do it."
All the time, she is reminding the young
artists that they must do things their own
way. Soon-whether it be modelling, dancing
or English composition-they begin to
understand their capabilities and freedom.
They start saying :"It's just like painting,
huh ? You got to do it your own way. You
mustn't be afraid ; just feel it inside and do it."
Supplied with colours, brushes and paper,
they produce big water-colours ; and adults
cannot help admiring the strength, the sin-
cerity and the rhythm. The subjects are
inexhaustible ; happy or sad experiences,
memories and reveries, shared or secret joys-
all the deep-seated emotions of childhood take

shape in the painting when the anxiety to
imitate has given place to a sole desire to
perfect a"beautiful picture". The best are,
of course, exhibited in the classroom, and each
pupil looks forward to his turn to have his
own picture well framed and in full view, to be
admired as it deserves.
In her book which is as studious as it is
human, Mrs. Cole gives many practical sug-
gestions, including some psychological tech-
niques. The"problem"child, she declares,
the child who is most handicapped and dif-
fident, can achieve equilibrium and self-
respect if you know how to encourage his
slightest artistic effort, if you frankly admire
his work. Don't spare admiration and praise ;
such a child is not used to it. He used to
think he could not get anything but
reproaches, rebuffs and punishments.
But each time, whatever may be the talents
or character of a pupil, the teacher should
remember that the growing process is more
important than the finished product-that
the child is more important than the picture.
Here is how one child has confided his
feelings :.'1 like to paint because it is fun.
And if you want a good picture yov have to
work on it and feel it inside and keep working
with it and take pains with it and make it
strong and don't be looking around or talking
to anyone and mind your own business and
don't be running around. Then you can make
a good picture and the teacher will hang it out
in the hall and you will have something to be
proud of."Another has not reached such
hasty conclusions. He contents himself by
saying reverently :"I like painting. 1 would
like to paint all the time, everyday. 1 am
never tired of painting."
Even if they do tire of painting, they find
fresh ardour in clay which soon takes the
shape of, say, a cow (the anatomy may be
strange, but it is unmistakeably a cow) or
an angel, whose authenticity is guaranteed
("I closed my eyes, and seen an angel, and
made one like I seen it"). They can make
and decorate plates, which will be baked in the
oven and can be used at meals. They can
engrave on linoleum those big figures with
arms upraised, those portraits. of a comrade, of
the teacher or of the cook who quite uninten-
tionally are depicted in the style of the
handsomest of African masks. They can print
on materials, dance or write, There still
remain so many means of explaining the world
that they are learning to observe, to touch, to
feel ; so many means of expressing the beauty
of the world revealed to those who are no
longer afraid of contributing to this beauty
because they know it is within them.
For they know what satisfies them ; they
know it so well that they want to hand on to
the grown-ups something of the confidence
they have gained in their school, where the
joy of making has conquered fear or the
boredom of living. Someone may say,.'You
do not know the world". So, as if she were pic-
turing an unseen world to the blind, a little
girl bravely tries to explain :"Now I will tell
you something about the earth-what's beau-
tiful on the earth. Well, here I go. The
earth is. simply marvellous  the trees, for
instance. Just think about them. Now the
pepper tree. The leaf is different than any
other leaf. Have you ever picked a pepper
leaf ? And their smell is so different, and the
little red pepper that comes on it. Everybody
should be thankful for our beautiful earth."
(l'iì% s by C. I' :. Ell/Oil. CO} JY" ; yll/ by Nai<llie Co/e.)
Do it your own way. Don't worry how others are doing it.
It is how much we feel inside that really counts,
From among the most timid children will come
some of the finest painters.
I closed my eyes and seen an angel and made one like I seen it.
Block prints capture the child's own feelings
and have a charm and beauty all of their own.

CHILD ART AS A GROVJING FORCE
.-...'........../.-.
! N EDUCATION
THE last twenty. rive years
have been particularly
important for child rt
education. Extraordinary
advances have been made in
teaching methods, classroom ac-
commodation, administration and
supervision, and in the output of
the participating children.
There are many reasons for
this, including new ideas about
art teaching which are acceptable
as part of general education. So
closely related have general and
art education become, that it is
frequently difficult to tell in
what way art education remains
a distinct subject.
This has not always been the
case. Not so long ago, art was
a separate, watertight compart-
ment in the school programme.
Its chief aim was to"develop the
hand and the eye"by telling
children to draw given objects.
Thus whole generations of chil-
. dren learned to draw old hats,
carrots and apples-and also to
dislike the school subject called
"art". Teachers felt that the
children's dislike was perhaps an
advantage, since it was a training
for discipline. They seemed to
believe that"youth should be
taught anything as long as they
disliked it". Because this form
of school art set a premium upon
the development of discipline and
skill, and further, because the
skill developed was separated
from the thoughts and emotions

Ontario Department of Educotfon.
of childhood, this method of
teaching became subsequently
known as the"nervous-twitch
programme".
The unsound nature of this
programme brought many reac-
tions. Some educators flatly
stated that art should be scrapped
as a part of general education.
Others said that the rigid forms
of discipline necessary for the
successful"training of hand and
eye"should be abandoned, and
that in their place should be
developed methods allowing com-
plete freedom of expression ; that
there should be"a charter of
human rights for children"which
would permit the young painters
to blow off steam artistically
without let or hindrance from the
clumsy adults who made them
draw carrots and apples.
EXTREMES RECONCILED
IN time, the extreme difference8between these two methods
became reconciled. Systems of
teaching have developed which
provide the freedom necessary
for artistic expression while in-
cluding the necessary self-discip-
line for the development of
worthy citizens..
The art programme in the
schools of today is in keeping
with the great tradition of art in
general. The idea is accepted
that a child should give expression
to the events in his life which
affect him. A child finds inspira-
tion for his artistic output in his
life at home, at play, in his school
and in his community. He is
allowed to make his own state-
ments in his own way. His work,
therefore, reflects his thoughts
and feelings about his world. His
output takes a form no more
mature than his own level of
intellectual, emotional and social
development. In other words,
child art looks like the work of a
child, and not that of an adult.
(The self-portraits shown on this
page are not likely to be mistaken
for the works of adults.)
Defining his reactions to life, a
child-or for that matter, anyone
else-frequently requires the
guidance of a teacher. To act as
a successful teacher of art requires
the greatest skill which fortunate-
ly is not beyond any sensitive
and sympathetic person's ability
to acquire if he is concerned with
the general education of youth.
The art teacher, like any other
teacher, or any successful parent,
must respect children as children.
He must be prepared to guide
them when the need arises, while
at the same time he must always
keep in mind that the child,
whenever possible, should act as
the controlling participant of the
activity in progress. Therefore, he
cannot inflict upon children adult
forms of expression, since this
would lead to sterility of the
child's expression and thought.
LEARNING ABOUT LIFE
WITHOUT a vigorous program-me of art education, it is
sai d, no child is adequately
educated. The act of defining
experience, inherent in the pro-
duction of art forms, is considered
to be an important part of learn-
ing. As a child considers the
events in his life which concern
him, he comes to grips with
experience. Thus he learns about
life in general. In his desire to
make statements about the world
which surrounds him he develops
manual skill commensurate with
his needs, while at the same time
he harnesses and directs his emo-
tions into worthwhile channels.
The potentialities of art educa-
tion for children have not yet
been fully realized. Progress has
been both rapid and wide-spread
but much has yet to be learned
and done. Methods are subject
to change as we gain greater
insight.

### 74597: Children as creative artists

### 74594: Stories in clay by children under ten

JULY-AUGUST) 95) Page I I-UNESCO COURIER
WHEN seven-year-old Esam Attia was brought to the
\A/Quobba Model School in Cairo for the first time, he. was very unhappy. Clinging to his father's arm, he
sobbed that he didn't want to start school, and he
finally had to be forced into a classroom.
It was not long, however, before Esam overcame his fear and
anger and settled down happily at the Quobba School. Why
he was able to do so is part of the story of an experiment in
the use of art as a means of full educational development which
I began several years ago for first grade children aged seven
to eight.
Taking art, which I regard as an instinctive form of expression
with most children, as a centre of interest, I used it as an
approach to, and as a nucleus for, many other subjects.
Art traditions, nature and the fresh ideas children absorbed
from their environment were moulded into the experiment
during its first years in 1945-1946. We arranged trips to mus-
eums and places of interest related to the problems under
study, and also made the project the subject of a play and of
articles in the school magazine.
While many kinds of art media were used to give form to
the children's expression, the most successful was clay modelling.
Examples of the work done by these seven-and eight-year-
olds which appear on this page show what can be done, even
with the simplest materials and equipment, to develop the
natural artistic abilities of children, provided they are taught
and encouraged with sympathetic insight and understanding.
When we put this experiment into operation, we faced two
main problems : how to seek out each child's inherent and
unique pattern of expression and which subject of interest to
choose to enable the integration of all learning ?
To solve the first we chose an emotional theme and asked
each child to express his ideas on it in simple patterns composed
of one object such as an animal or a man.
Some astonishing results were obtained, as in figure 4 on
this page"The expression of an angry lion", which was done
by Esam Attia, the same little boy who had to be forced into
school. Now E`sam's outward feelings of fear and anger have
left him, for they have been released and given a chance of
expression in t) his form of the angry animal. The lion has
been hit by arrows and is roaring with pain and anger. All
the subjective and dramatic feeling of the child has thus found
an outlet in his expression of the suffering lion.
A similar example is found in figure 2 where the young
artist's subject was"A man feeling the pain of hunger". Note
how the child has stiffened the man's arms and fingers and
made the form unmovable. Here the expression is shown in
a very subtle way.
After using these dramatic modes of expression, we shifted
the emphasis to another subject which could be studied within
the proximity of the school-the life of the Egyptian peasant ;
his house, work and animals. Examples of the modelling done
by the children on this subject are also shown here.
"Two farmers at work" (figure 1) has a quality of dramatic
expression that can be found in certain paintings of Geor-
ges Rouault, while"The shepherd" (figure 3) is a poetic work
characterized by the rhythmical repetitions of forms. Note the
manner of depicting the grass.
Oar aim was not to teach"art for art's sake", but to seek
the total aesthetic development of each child. At the same time
the children studied the life of the Egyptian peasant, later
comparing it with life in other lands. They also planned to
build an actual model of a peasant's house, and this involved
doing mathematical problems and writing letters and reports
on their experiences. Then they wrote a play for which they
made dresses and peasant tools, prepared stage scenery and
studied songs and music.
In this way, working from art to life and vice versa, I think
we have succeeded in giving our pupils the creative experience
which children need, and in teaching a valuable lesson in the
development of direct, honest and unspoiled artistic expression.

### 74596: Paris: how 80 children aged 9-14 see the capital of France

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 JULY-AUGUST 1951
EVERY district of Paris seems to be celebrating
the 2000th anniversary of the French capital
these days. The whol  city is d corated,
the flags are out and the shop windows and
public squares have the air of a big family birth-
day.
In the programme of festivities, something has
been thought of for everybody-including the chil-
dren. Working under the guidance of two French
art teachers, Madame Vige Langevin and M. Jean
Lombard, boys and girls have produced a remark-
able series of paintings and drawings with Paris
as their theme.
The iriteresting thing about these paintings-a
number of which we reproduce on this page-is
that they have been done according to a rather
unusual technique, developed by Madame Langevin
and M. Lombard. All of the works shown on this
page are collective paintings executed by as many
as 80 boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 14.
Madame Langevin defines collective painting and
drawing as an artistic work of quite large propor-
tions, conceived and carried out by a group of chil-
dren. The number and age of the children working
on a single painting, she points out, often varies
considerably. The same is true of the size, the
technical methods used and the length of time
needed to complete a given project.
One of the advantages of this method, according
to the two French art teachers, is that it enriches
the child's aesthetic appreciation and at the same
time gives him a lesson in social education.
Working in this way, the child learns quickly to
be selective in his own expression, to discipline
his ideas and to respect the efforts of others.
"The child acquires a collective sense", says Ma-
dame Langevin,"for he learns to understand that
a painting conceived and executed by himself and
by other members of his group must take into
account the requirements of everyone and give
aesthetic satisfaction to the whole team. Such a
painting therefore assumes greater importance and
beauty for the child since it represents the total of
everyone's efforts."
Like many other modern art teachers, Madame
Langevin and M. Lombard are interested above all
in stimulating the creative personality of children,
and tao, do this the teacher must make an effort to
understand their feelings and ideas."A teacher"
they say,"must be as much a psychologist as an
artist, and must respect the artistic efforts of the
child, however faltering or even absurd they may
at first glance appear."

### 74600: The Modern calculating machine: an aid to man in his fight for progress

JULY-AUGUST 195 I Page 13-UNESCO COURIER
Aspects of science
FUNDAMENTAL PARHCLES
WHAT ARE THEY ?
Is matter infinitely divisible, oris there a limit to the process
of cutting a substance into
finer and finer bits ? The ancient
Greeks, pondering this question, de-
cided that eventually a limit, an
ultimate particle, would be reach-
ed,-that beyond this point no
further sub-division would be pos-
sible. The idea remained almost
forgotten for over 2. 000 years. Then,
about the middle of the 17th cen-
tury, the notion began to be reviv-
ed, and there grew up a vivid
picture of matter consisting of
indestructible atoms, with all the
atoms of a given chemical element
alike but different from those of
every other element. By the end of
the 19th century, the atom was
firmly established as our first
"fundamental"particle-an ulti-
mate unit of matter, the simplest
and most primitive bit of substance
that can exist by itself.
But even before the last century
was out, new researches and disco-
veries began to undermine the su-
preme position of the atom. For
Thomson, by discovering the elec-
tron (see"What are Electrons"in
the COURIER for December,
1950), showed that the atom itself
has an internal structure. More
important, the electron is better
deserving of the term"fundamen-
tal particle"since all electrons, re-
gardless of their source, are iden-
tical. By the end of the first quar-
ter of the present century the phy-
sicist knew a great deal about the
number and arrangement of the
electrons in the outer reaches of
the atom, but little about the
constitution of the atomic nucleus.
by Ira M. FREEMAN
Not many years passed before
Rutherford, in England, showed
that a second fundamental par-
ticle, the proton, i-s a constituent
of the compact, central nucleus.
Mutual Annihilation
WITH the electron and theproton, physicists and che-
mists complacently felt that
they had attained an understand-
ing of the structure of matter.
Science, however, refused to stand
still. Before long, grave difficulties
came to light in connection with
attempts to explain the structure
of the nucleus. Happily, order was
again restored with the discovery
of a third elementary unit-the
neutron. As the name implies, this
strange particle carries no electric
charge. Neutrons were promptly
incorporated into the theory of
nuclear structure, with the result
that the whole picture was
immeasurably clarified.
Now science was in the position
of having to admit the existence
of three kinds of construction ma-
terials. Ironically, a fourth-the
positron-was unexpectedly added
within the year, as a result of ob-
servations on cosmic rays. The
new particle possesses the same
amount of mass and electrical
charge as the electron, but its
charge is positive, while that of the
electron is negative. Positrons
differ from the previously dis-
covered particles in having only a
transitory existence-they can be
created and destroyed. Within a
few thousandths of a millionth of
a second of its birth, a positron
inevitably encounters its opposite
- an electron-and the two anni-
hilate each other in a burst of
radiant energy-a prime example
of the now famous Einstein equi-
valence of matter and energy.
What may also be considered
one of the basic particles, but in a
slightly different sense, had been
discovered much earlier. It is the
photon, or quantum of radiant
energy (see"What is the Quantum
Theory"in the COURIER for No-
vember, 1950). This entity has
many of the attributes of a part-
icle ; for example, when it crashes
into matter it is able to knock
electrons out of the atoms. But
perhaps the most curious fact
about photons is that they have
never been observed to exist when
at rest, but only when moving
with the speed of light.
The Ghostly Neutrino
A NOTHER particle whose exist-ence had been suggested ear-
lier is the neutrino-the most
ghostly and intangible of all. As a
matter of fact, this member of the
company has never been directly
observed, but its presence seems to
be required in certain sub-atomic
processes in order to balance their
energy account. If the neutrino
exists at all, it must have no elec-
tric charge and virtually no mass.
However, it may turn out to be a
mere makeshift, of no further use
once our understanding of nature
advances sufficiently.
With no fewer than half a dozen
recognized particles confronting
them, scientists were becoming re-
conciled to the fact that the world
is not as simply constituted as
they once had hoped. Then, be-
ginning in 1935, a whole new
class of particles was discovered,
again through work on cosmic
rays. These were the mesons
which can be neutral or carry
either positive or negative charges.
As presently established, they
exist with at. least three distinct
masses. Mesons, like positrons and
neutrons, are unstable and almost
immediately break down into other
particles. The mesons of inter-
mediate mass are believed to be
responsible for holding the nucleus
of the atom together.
Mesons provide us with some of
the most urgent and most baffling
problems of modern physics, and
they are being investigated inten-
sively in many laboratories. The
new high-powered machines capa-
ble of giving tremendous energies
to sub-atomic particles have ac-
tually succeeded in manufacturing
mesons. Still more powerful ma-
chines, now planned or being built,
hold promise of even more excit-
ing discoveries.

DURING the last ten years, great
progress has been made in the
scope of calculating machines.
The great British diarist, Sa-
muel Pepys, would have been happy
if such inventions had been at his
service, for, although in charge of
the contracts branch of the Admi-
ralty, his arithmetic was so weak
that he had to rise at four o'clock
each morning to learn his multipli-
cation tables.
But that was 300 years ago. Only
the recent development of the
science of electronics has made it
possible to build new and elaborate
calculating machines which enable
us to tackle many mathematical
problems shunned up to now because
the calculations involved would take
the normal human computor far too
long. In science, industry and admi-
nistration the modern world is so
complex that it would break down if
rapid mathematical calculation were
not possible.
One of the newest machines, de-
monstrated in Britain a few months
ago, is so fast that it can provide
the answer in one minute to a pro-
blem that would occupy a mathema-
tic : an for a month. In a quarter-of-
an-hour it can make a calculation
which, if written out, would fill half-
a-million sheets of foolscap paper.
MACHINE WITH A"MEMORY"
THIS particular machine, known asthe ACE (automatic computing
engine) uses pulses of electricity,
generated at a rate of a million a
second, to solve all calculations
which resolve themselves into addi-
tion, subtraction, multiplication and
division ; so that for practical pur-
poses there is no limit to what the
ACE can do.
On the machine the pulses are
used to indicate the figure 1, and
gaps represent the figure 0. All cal-
culations are done with only these
two digits in what is known as the
binary scale. The number 2, for
example, in binary notation is"10".
To put a sum into the machine, the
numbers are first translated into
then binary scale. Instructions for
the calculation are given to the
machine by coding them as holes in
cards.
To carry out long sequences of
operations, the machine must have
a"memory". It may have to com-
bine the results of a dozen or more
separate calculations, and, as it can
do only one computation at a time,
the machine must remember each
one. This highly complicated me-
mory section depends on the slower
time of travel of supersonic waves,
into which the electric pulses are
converted, through a column of
mercury. One thousand pulses-
representing digits-can be stored
and extracted at the moment needed.
The complete calculation appears in
code as a holed card, representing
the answer in the binary scale, which
is translated back into ordinary
numbers.
FROM PASCAL TO AIKEN
THESE giant calculating machines,however imposing their bilities,
cannot function without being
told what to do. They are not
capable of asking questions, but only
of providing speedy answers to pro-
blems put by human beings. They
may-one expert has pointed out- perform everything that can be
called"second class brainwork".
The history of the development of
calculating machines covers many
countries. It was the Frenchman,
Blaise Pascal, who in 1642 produced
the first adding machine ; the Ger-
man, Leibnitz, who in 1671 conceived
the first multiplying machine, and
the Frenchman, Thomas, who in
1820 built it. It was the Englishman,
Babbage, who in 1832 had the idea
of a universal calculating machine-
that is, a machine handling any pro-
blem ; and the American, Aiken, who
110 years later constructed one that
worked.

THE setting up of an InternationalComputation Ce tre has been
studied and discussed at length
by the United Nations. It is part of

which-the Arid Zone Research
Council, the Laboratory for the Phy-

the International Computation Cen-
tre itself-Unesco has already
begun preliminary work.
The Sixth Session of Unesco's Ge-
neral Conference has agreed to a
series of recommendations for the
organizing and establishment of this
International Computation Centre.
The Centre's main functions in the
fields of research, education and ser-
vice would be :
To organize and make better
known study and scientific research
on use and development of mecha-
nical computation devices ;
To promote collaboration and co-
ordination between computing insti-
tutes throughout the world ;
To organize the training and im-
provement of research workers ;
To establish and maintain an advi-
sory service dealing with queries
from scientific institutions and scien-
tists, and ;
To set up laboratories equipped
with various types of calculating ma-
chines and requested to carry out
numerical computations.
Three countries-Italy, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland-
have offered to act as host for the
proposed Centre, but no decision is
to be made until a special meeting
is held in November.
This Centre will be the first of the
United Nations'research laborato-
ries, which are designed to help
improve the living conditions of
mankind.

### 74601: The Right to free and compulsory education

### 74603: Science and newsprint

UNESCO COURIER-Page t4 JULY-AUGUST 1951
THE RIGHT TO FREE AND
COMPULSORY EDUCATION
by Jean Debiesse, Assistant Director
of Primary Education in France
THE right of every human being to education is, of all the rights affirmed by the United Nations
Declaration of 1948, one of the ! east contested. Yet there are still places which have not yet
applied Article 26, which states that elementary education should be free and compulsory. Today,
the question is more alive than ever following campaigns for fundamental education and for equal
access to secondary education.
A long-term programme for free and compulsory education in the spirit of the Human Rights Decla-
ration planned by Unesco has now been approved by the Organization's General Conference. The
urgency of the problem is also shown by its choice as the main subject for discussion at the fourteenth
International Conference on Public Education, which opened in Geneva on July 12, under the auspices
of Unesco and the International Bureau of Education.
A N'CIE1'.'T holy writings, according to thehistorian Zosimus, report that certain
angels fell in love with women and went
down to the Earth, where they taught about
the workings of nature. For this, they were
banished.
According to this version, it was only after
that period that women were able to teach
their children to drink, eat, walk, k, run-to
adapt themselves progressively to the life of
adults.
Now, this basic culture may have been suffi-
cient in the caveman period, but it leaves much
to be desired in our modern world. The man
of today swims in a sea of letters and figures,
from taxes to train timetables, from farming
and machine manuals to voting. The whole
problem of living and of improving one's life
is bound up in the acquiring of these skills.
The modern State has more and more to take
up the task of completin the culture that
children receive from their family. It is a
logical outgrowth of civilization.
Society cannot permit a baby to remain
naked and without food. Society cannot permit
a baby to fall prey to disease. No more can
society permit a baby to grow up lacking
fundamental knowledge of his surroundings.
Out of this concept grew, toward the 19th
century, the idea of establishing compulsory
education. But, among impoverished peoples,
it is not possible to yield completely the
dependence on child labour : everyone, children
and adults, must spend his time in seeking
sufficient daily bread to maintain life.
It is because economic conditions were
favourable in western civilization-thanks to
the development of machines, and to general
improvement in standards of living-that
certain countries were able to pioneer the
development of compulsory education.
There were no insurmountable difficulties.
As a matter of fact, in most of these countries,
more than three-fifths of the children already
were going to school. Thus, the reform was
accepted without too much trouble and has
since helped to lay the foundation for the great
democracies of today.
But all this is no reason why an abyss should
open between the nations which instruct their
children and the ones that have not yet arrived
at that point. Both groups must work together,
for it IS intolerable in our times that nearby
half the people in this world cannot read or
write. General ignorance creates fanaticism
and superstition, and leads often to hate and
war.
It is just and it is necessary that all the
children of the world should have the right to
equal opportunity. Each child should have the
chance to reach any position through merit, no
matter what his race, reliPion or social origin.
. this ideal is the motivating force which has
led Unesco to undertake a campaign for
compulsory education. The educators of the
world, with the help uf Unesco, are consulting
together and poohng their experiences and
results in primary education.
Even the most convinced Doubting Thomas
must learn that riioney spent on education is
the most fruitful of all investments. All must
learn that the mutual aid of all the nations is
necessary to realize the instruction of all the
children on this earth, despite the very real
difficulties that lie in the way.
This is one of the ways in which Unesco can
fulfil its aim of solidarity and co-operation in
working for the general good and for peace.
SCIENCE AND NEWSPRINT
THE world today faces a desperate shortage of newsprint, the material on which our newspapersare printed. Inadequate production, rising prices, uneven distribution-all contribute to the prob-
lem whose effects are being felt in all pa. rts of the world. Concerned by the danger to the spread
of information and knowledge due to this shortage, the Unesco General Conference gave prominence
to this subject and voted a resolution calling on Unesco Member States to take urgent steps to solve
the serious problem of greater production and a fairer distribution of newsprint. The following
article describes how scientists are exploring. new ways of helping to solve the problem, thereby
ensuring individuals in all countries of one of their fundamental rights-freedom of information.
on the Ivory Coast which is to begin work
almost immediately, using tropical woods to
make paper. A new factory is being built in
Morocco which will use. eucalyptus wood.
There is a factory using bamboo in Indo-
China ; another in Algeria is using alfa, a kind
of grass. Belgium is experimenting with
papyrus in the Congo-using the reeds on
which the Egyptians wrote thousands of years
ago. India is making paper from bamboo. All
over the world this shortage is felt and all over
the world men are trying to find the answer.
Already, for example, daily newspapers in
the United States of America have been printed
entirelv on sugar cane. Australia is now using
eucalyptus for its newspapers. A pilot plant is
experimenting with still other materials in
Georgia, U. S. A., for the benefit of manufacturers
from America, Africa, India, New Zealand,
Finland and Mexico.
No one, however, has thought of trying to
duplicate one of the strangest of all the
attempted solutions for paper shorfage-that
of August Stanwood in the United States.
Stanwood was pressed for raw material to keep
his paper mill in operation during the Ame-
rican Civil war, and arrived at a novel solution.
He imported shiploads of mummies from Egypt
and used their cloth wrappings and papyrus to
manufacture a paper which eventually found
its way into the shops of grocers, butchers and
other merchants to wrap their parcels.
Obviously, this out-of-the-ordinary approac 11
has no wide application. But there may be
others which offer better prospects. That i-
why governments as well as individuals and
international gatherings are pressing their
efforts to find an answer. Unesco is directly
concerned, since the very great shortages of
paper are likely, to impede the work and
development of information and education.
All present indications are that there will not
be a single solution. Many answers will have
to be found in response to varying local situa-
tions, and the scientists' rôle must be sup-
plemented by efforts on many other levels.
THE DRAT OF A UNIVERSAL
COPYRIGHT CONVENTION designed
to protect the rights of authors of
literary, scientific and artistic works
in all counties was approved by a
,'ommiUee of copyright speciatist-
from 25 countries, during the Unesco
General Conference.
This Unesco draft convention, de-
signed to enable all countries to
adhere to it without making changes
in their national laws, will be sub-
mitted to governments and later to an
inter-governmental conference for
final adoption. Under its terms, each
country would give the same protec-
tion to the books, music, films, paint-
ings and other literary and artistic
works of foreigners as to the works
of it own nationals.
.. A PLAN TO HELP TEACHERS, stu-
dents, research workers, writers, ar-
tists and other persons engaged on
educational, scientific and cultural
work, to visit other countries more
easily was adopted by the Conference.
Under this pktn Unesco is to pre-
pare the draft of an international con-
vention aimed to remove such obsta-
cles to travel as strict passport and
visa controls, currency regulations,
high transport costs and working res-
trictions for foreigners.

DiR GEORGE PAIK, Minister of
Education of the Republic of Keren.
has asked Unesco to carry out a sur-
vey of his country's urgent educatio-
nal needs and map out plans for edu-
cational reconstruction to synchronize
with the political and economis reha-
bilitation of Korea.
Mr. Paik pointed out that when the
new school year opens in September.
Korean schools will need something_
like 62, 000, 000 textbooks. Korea is also
desperately in need of paper and
printing equipment fo the production
of these books.

. AN INTERNATIONAL PACT aimed
at ensuring the respect and defence
of monuments and other cultural
treasures in time of war was consider-
ed by the General Conference, and is
to be submitted to all countries for
signature and ratification. Declaring'
that the destruction of a master-
piece in any country is a spiritual
lmpovrishment for the world, the
convention requires belligerents to
recognize the immunity of artistic or
historic monuments, works of art,
historical documents and collection
pieces.
. UNESCO'S PROGRAMMES of Tech-
nical Assistance and Fundamental
Education in the under-developed
areas of the world call for a new kind
of library designed for readers using
hooks for the first time in their adult
lives and who, without practice, might
slide back into iHiteracy. The first
such library has now been organized
hy Unesco in collaboration with the
Indian Government as a pilot project
in New Delhi. It not only lends
hooks, but stimulates reading interest
through film shows, discussions, publi-
cation of reading lists, record concerts
and exhibitions.

In Brief
IN all the talk about the atomic age or theage of steel, few people realize how much
our civilization is based on that unromantic
substance-paper. But a moment's pause
will make you aware how much we depend on
paper for our education, our information, and
all the paraphernalia of modern living.
Over a period of time, the world has grownmore and more short of this substance.
Sources of supply have been unable to keep
pace with the growing demand for paper all
over the world.
The date usually given for the actual inven-
tion of paper is 105 A. D. It was at that time
that Ts'ai Lun first reported to the Emperor of
China that he had devised a method of making
paper from the bark of trees, discarded cloth
and hemp. For five hundred years the Chinese
succeeded in keeping the making of paper a
well-guarded secret. Thereafter, it spread into
Central Asia, Persia and Southern Russia.
In the early Middle Ages paper found its
way into Arabia, Egypt and Morocco, and
thence, after another lengthy interval, into the
Western Mediterranean. It was only in the
13th century that it was introduced into
northern Europe. Well over 1, 000 years thus
elapsed before the invention completed its
travels from East to West.
From that time onward, there was a slow but
ever increasing demand for paper in the west.
with the expansion of printing, tremendous
shortages began to develop. In both Europe
and America advertisements began to appear,
imploring the populace to save rags for use in
paper. It was at this point that inventors
began to look for new sources of paper. All
sorts of materials were tried-straw, hay,
thistles, cabbage stalks and potatoes, to name
but a few. By the middle of the 19th century,
wood pulp had established its place as the
primary source for paper.
Now'scientists are casting their eyes back at
some of the old experiments because there is
not enough coniferous wood to meet the need.

### 74602: The Paradox of British humour

JULY-AUGUST 1951 Page I 5-UNESCO COURIER
THE PARADOX
OF
BRITISH HUMOUR
by Ronald MATTHE. WS
IF there is a paradox in thebloody but unbowed Britain of
1951 inviting the world to a
Festival at all, there is perhaps an
even greater paradox in the fact
that its exhibits include one de-
voted to British humour. To dis-
play humour seems almost as
self-contradictory as to parade hu-
mility.
It is merely a Continental legend
that the British are proud of their
sense of humour. To be proud of
one's sense of humour would be as
humourless as it would be manner-
less to boast of one's good manners.
At most, the British regard with
pity or wonder the unhappy
foreigners who fail to appreciate
the spirit of the famous London
newspaper headline :"'Channel
gale : Continent cut off". While
the Latin will greet adversity with
rhetoric (which defies it) or wit
(which dominates it), the English-
man will accept it with humour
(which views it as a joke) and
includes himself in the jest.
No one could refuse to call brave
the last words of Danton on the
scaffold."Montrez ma tête au
peuple, elle en vaut la peine". No
one could deny the same adjective
to those of Saint Thomas More,
brushing away his beard from the
headman's axe :"Pity that should
be cut ; that has never committed
treason."But the first phrase is
pure Latin rhetoric, which stems
from manly pride ; the second is the
purest English humour, which
stems from humility.
The British are not generally
credited with humility-but then
they are not generally credited
with a number of virtues which are
really theirs. To European and
American onlookers, their out-
standing quality has aften seemed
their conventionality, whereas
the great glory of English life has
always been the happy persistence
of the English eccentric ; and the
English eccentric has invariably
been quite unconcerned as whether
the world laughed at him or not.
JOINING IN JOKE
CAN one conceive of any religiouspretender other than an
Englishman describing himself as
.'good Admighty's Nephew", as did
Richard Brothers, founder of the
British Israelites ; or of any other
prophetess than an Englishwoman,
such as Joanna Southcott (of the
mysterious box) claiming for her
mythical heaven-begotten child,
not only the style of"the third
representative of Divinity", but
also that of.'infant monitor of the
Prince Regent (later George IV), in
whose palaces the bantling will
pass its first years, and from whom
His Royal Highness will learn his
first lessons of reform and tempe-
rance" ?
If the English eccentric accepts
being part of a joke, the English
humorist sets out to be part of it :
the Latin wit is superior to the
amusement he provokes. There is
no reason to consider one form of
arousing the saving purge of laugh-
ter as more worthy than the other.
THE LEG PULL
THERE is all the difference in theworld between Clemenceau's
mordant :"War is too serious an
affair to be left to generals", which
is wit, and the Duke of Wellington's
first comment on the raw troops
who were to serve under him at
Waterloo : :.'1 don't know what
the enemy will think of these fel-
lows, but by God, they frighten
me", which is humour.
Significant of the difference
between the two attitudes is that
there exists no French equivalent
for the phrase.'leading up the
garden path", an activity which
forms such an esential element of
English humour. The pompous or
unconscious ass being led up the
garden path is one of the central
themes in English comedy. We
can follow it back through the
centuries, finding it in the screen
scene of Sheridan's"School for
Scandal", when Joseph Surface is
the victim, and in the letter scene
in"TWelfth Night", where Malvolio
is having his leg pulled.
One of its earlier and most
brilliant appearances occurs in
Act IV, Scene 3 of Ben Jonson's
play"The Alchemist", because the
leading up the garden is mutual ;
the victim is silently pulling the
legs of his would-be swindlers.
The egregious"Capatin"Face has
picked up a stranger whom he
imagines to be a wealthy Spanish
visitor to London and whom he
proposes to part from his money by
proposing the charms of the fair
but frail Doll Common, one of his
two partners in roguery. In fact,
the"Spaniard"is an English cha-
racter. Before ears which they
fondly believe comprehend no
English, but which in reality seize
"English is understood almost everywhere"says the inscription in the mouth
of the lion at the Festival of Britain Exhibition."And the English almost nowhere",
adds the Unicorn. Between them, under the map showing the areas of the
world where English is spoken, the caption reads :"THE ENGLISH TONGUE.
It is a language tuned for all occasions, It writes sonnets, talks shop, sings
music hall and talks volumes. It was once the dialect of a handful of islanders.
It is now the mother tongue of 200 millions."
every word they say, the rogues
boast :"You shall be emptied, Don.
Pumped and drawn dry, as they
say... Milked, in troth, sweet Don."
When the Englishman laughs at
situations like this, he is not
asserting the superiority of human
intelligence over circumstance, as
does Latin wit, nor his own super-
iority over the butt of the jest, as
does the ill-bred child who mocks
at a cripple. He knows that in the
best and least pretentious of us
there lurks a pompous or an un-
conscious ass, and when he is
laughing at that ass's discomfiture,
he is also laughing at himself.
It is surprising to find that there
is only one European national lite-
rature in which the same attitude
towards the leg-pull may be found
- and that is the Russian. Gogol's
riotous comedy of"The Inspector-
General", where a penniless stu-
dent takes in an entire provincial
town by posing as a visiting official
from the Central Government,
could only have been written as it
was written by one other contem-
porary author in Europe-and
that was that most English of all
humorists, Charles Dickens..
One characteristic of the British people is their love of
eccentric fantasy. No better summary of this exists than
Tenniel's White Knight who, mounted on his all-purpose
steed, is displayed at the pavilion providing clues to British
character and tradition, at the Festival Exhibition.
The title of"The Lion and the Unicorn"given to a
pavilion at the Festival of Britain Exhibition, serves to
symbolize two of the main qualities of the British cha-
racter : on the one hand, realism and strength ; on the
other, fantasy, independence and imagination.
CURATE'S EGG
THE Briton is prepared to laughat himself and any of his
defects, as witness the summing up
of the British character by
"Punch"in a poem which went, in
part :
"Their philosophic outlook is noto-
riously stoic ;
"They have a gift for Compromise
allied to Muddled Thinking ;
"Though slightly xenophobic, they
are highly philozoic ;
"Their incomes and their appetites
are gradually shrinking".
He also laughs at himself for his
timidity as when the curate, break-
fasting with his bishop, was asked
whether he had not been given a
bad egg, made the immortal re-
ply :"Oh no, my lord, I assure you.
Parts of it are excellent."
Though he is reverent to what
he believes are holy things, he
laughs at himself as the preacher,
as in George Herbert's gently mali-
cious lines :
"The worst say something good ; if
all lack sense,
"God takes a text, and preaches
patience."
And sometimes, to the bewilder-
ment of foreigners, he appears to
laugh at just nothing."English is
understood almost everywhere....
and the English almost nowhere",
says an inscription in the Festival
of Britain Pavilion where the
English character and English hu-
mour are illustrated. That is a
statement which only an English-
man could make with compla-
cency.
The Frenchman may pride him-
self on the clarity of his intelli-
gence, the German on the profun-
dity of his philosophic penetration,
the Russian on the deep recesses of
his soul ; but if the British do at
any time come close to conceit, it is
not on their intelligence or artistic
talents that they plume themselves,
but over the fact that they can
make jokes which no one but they
can understand. I wonder how
many foreigners would laugh as
uproariously as Englishmen did at
Harry Graham's magnificent Ruth-
less Rhyme :
"I was playing golf the day
"that the Germans landed,
"All our men had run away,
"all our ships were stranded
"And the thought ot England's
shame
"Nearly put me off my game"

### 74604: Honourable Miss Doll is more than just a toy for Japanese children

UNESCO COURIER-Page 16 JULY-AUGUST) 95)
HONOURABLE
MISS DOLL
IS MORE THAN JUST A TOY
FOR JAPANESE CHILDREN
APANESE children make no fuss
and blowout no candles when
their birthdays come around
every year. In far, the children
of Japan do not celebrate their real
birthdays at all ; New Year's day is
everybody's birthday. Children are
considered to be one year old when
they are born and on New Year's day
everyone just adds a year. The real
celebrations for girls and boys are
held on special festival days in March
and May.
On March 3, the colourful Hina-
macuria (Doll's Festival, sometimes
also called Peach Blossom Festival)
reminds girls that they must be gentle
and peaceful. A series of shelves,
placed one above the other, is set up
in a corner of the best room and
covered with a red cloth or some
precious coloured faerie to represent
a little house. Ceremonial dolls,
handed down from generation to
generation, are then arranged on the
shelves by the girls. On the top shelf
of honour are the Emperor and
Empress, while at either side or below
them are the ladies-in-waiting, musi-
cians, guards and footmen, all dressed
in the rich court costumes of ancient
times. A staircase leads down from
the top shelf to toy orange and cherry
trees, one at each side, while paper
peach blossoms and lanterns brighten
the shelves.
The girls of the family and their
friends who visit from house to house
all come to look at the dolls and to
offer red and white rice cakes and
sweets shaped like fruit and f3sh.
Then all the children share in eating
the delicacies. When the ceremony
of O-Hina-sana (Honourable Miss
Doll) is over, the dolls are put care-
fully away in another room along
with other family treasures and there
they are left until the following year.
May 5 is Tango-no-sekku day, the
Boys'Festival. Every family which
has sons proudly plants a bamboo
pole in the garden or on the roof and
floats from it a coloured paper fish (a
carp) for each boy. A hole is made in
the paper so that it swells with the
wind and twists and turns in the air.
The largest fish represents the oldest
son, the tiniest fish the baby boy of
the family. For the Japanese, the
carp symbolizes perseverance, courage
and strength.
A Danish traveller who recently
returned from a trip around the world
expressed his surprise at the impor-
tance given to dolls by Japanese
children."Never have I seen so many
dolls or doll-shops as in Japan", he
said.
Last year, the students of Komat-
sugwan Girls'High School in Tokyo
told their teachers that they wanted
to present Unesco with a gift as a
token of their interest in the world
organization. It is not surprising,
therefore, that when encouraged to do
so by the principal of the school,
they decided to present a collection of
hand-made dolls dressed in costume.
Some of the photos of these dolls,
received at Unesco Headquarters in
Paris, are published on this page. The
collection includes models dressed in
various costumes worn by modern
Japanese-a young bride in white
robes decorated with gold brocade, a
dancing girl in a brilliant red dress
with brightly coloured designs, a
puppet man (the equivalent of a Euro-
pean Guignol player)-as well as
figures from Japanese history.
What is interesting to note is that
although these small dolls represent
traditional figures of Japanese life and
history, the child artists who
executed them, managed to instill in
each form a poetic richness and ex-
pression all its own. There is a
prevailing belief among Oriental peo-
ples that everything in nature has life
and spirit. Thus the Japanese
children-and indeed the Japanese
people as a whole-are thrilled with
This small Japanese doll and the seven others shown below are part of a collection presented to
Unesco by students of a Girls'High School in Tokyo. The dolls represent traditional figures of
Japanese life and history ; but the children have succeeded ingiving each of them a spiritual quality
and graceful beauty worthy of real artists.
joy when they come in contact with
or can create life and spirit even in an
object which may appear trivial at
first glance.
By emphasizing the movement,
character and decorative beauty of
their dolls, the Japanese high school
children have sought to express such
joy and feeling. They have attempted,
essentially, to reveal the life and soul
of each personage rather than the
more physical form. And although
the Japanese passion for neatness, for
fastidious and cleanly order character-
istic of their art in general, is re-
flected in these children's dolls, their
work is imbued with a spiritual qual-
ity, a delicacy and grace inspired by
their common love for the beautiful
and exquisite detail.
As early as the sixth century, an
eminent art critic, Hsieh Ho, had
already emphasized the importance of
"spiritual rhythm and IUe movement".
placing these at the head of six canons
embodying the fundamental principles
of the arts. This was not only his
own view as a Chinese, but an ideal
of the Far East held from ancient
times and transmitted down to our
present day. Japanese children, sur-
rounded by the old customs and tradi-
tions that still pervade family life in
their country, have apparently learned
to appreciate these ideals at an early
age.
