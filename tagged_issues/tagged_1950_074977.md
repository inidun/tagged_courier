### 74263: (Julian Huxley)
### 74261: UNESCO helps educational films over frontier barriers
UNESCO COURIER-Page 2
ONE summer afternoon 20 years ago Jean Painleve, son of the late French
Premier and already famous as a producer of scientific films, hurriedly
entrained at the Gare du Nord in Paris for Brussels. His only luggage
was a large case of his films, which King Albert and Queen Elisabeth of
the Belgians had invited him to show at a palace reception that evening.
When the train reached the border a few hours later, M. Painlev√© disco-
vered that he had left his passport behind. But he was able to show Belgian
customs officials his identity card and the invitation from King Albert. The
officials were satisfied-certainly he could pass through. But the aims-
that, unfortunately, was another matter. He'd have to pay a heavy duty on
each one of them, since the Belgian tariff made no distinction between educa-
tional, scientific or cultural films and purely commercial ones ; not even if
they were to be shown before the King himself.
M. Painlev√© protested, but the offs-
cials were adamant. So he went on
to Brussels, and his films stayed at the
border.
"It's a crazy situation, Your Majes-
ties", he told the disappointed King
and Queen that evening."A film man
such as myself has been allowed to
cross the frontier without a passport,
but my films, the expression of my
ideas, cannot enter without being
taxed.
Campaign To Break
The Barriers
FROM that day M. Pa. inlev√© foughtto free educational l"lnd kindred
films from import duties. When
asked to show his films to interna-
tional conferences, he would take them
as far as the border, and, if asked to
pay duty, would leave them there.
Travelling on to the conference centre,
he would Explain his problems to the
delegates and ask them to aid his
campaign to free educational 61ms.
The International Institute for
Intellectual Co-operation was mean-
while making a survey of educational
film problems through its technical
agency, the International Institute for
Educational Films, in Rome. It found
that, in general, films of high educa-
tional but doubtful commercial value
were liable to the same duties as
"entertainment"films likely to show
a profit. One effect of this obstacle
to the international exchange of edu-
cational films was to discourage pro-
ducers from making such films.
The work of the international agen-
cies resulted in the drafting by the
League of Nations in October, 1933 of
the"Convention to Facilitate the
International Circulation of Educa-
tional Films", under which countries
would exempt imported educational
films from customs duties and grant
them the same tax privileges as might
be enjoyed by locally produced films.
The Rome Institute was authorized
to act as executive agency for the
agreement and to issue certificates for
films it approved as being educational.
By December, 1937, 24 nations had
signed or ratified the agreement and
educational films were beginning to
move more freely. Then, Mussolini
took Italy out of the League and closed
the Rome Institute. To keep the
agreement in force, the other signa-
tory nations met at Geneva in Sep-
tember, 1938 and authorized the Inter-
national Institute for Intellectual
Co-operation to carry on as executive
agency, but with the outbreak of
World War II, the agreement fell into
abeyance.
In June, 1946, six months before
Unesco came into operation, an
international meeting of mass com-
munications experts recommended
that the new agency should sponsor
a fresh agreement which would take
the place of the League of Nations
Convention. This agreement they
suggests should be broadened to
include sound recordings and other
audio-visual materials as well as films ;
it would free these aids from quotas
and other quantitative restrictions as
well as customs duties ; and it would
provide for a decentralized system of
certification in place of the pre-war
centralized one.
It took many months and many
meetings of experts to draft an
agreement likely to be generally
acceptable, but the text was finally
approved by the Unesco General
Conference when it met at Beirut in
November, 1948. This first inter-
national agreement to be sponsored by
Unesco was circulated to governments
early in 1949 and was opened for
signature last July.
Nations Support New Pact
W [TIUN six months, 16 nations had
signed it, and the first to ratify it
recently was Norway. Several
other governments are also pre-,
paring ratification, and it is expected
that the total of ten needed to put the
agreement into force will be obtained
in the near future.
The agreement will remove customs
duties, quotas, licences and other
obstacles to the exchange, not only of
educationai, scientific or cultural films,
but also of film strips, microfilms,
sound recordings, glass slides, models,
wall charts, maps and posters, to
name the more important items. It
will mean that school children in
devastated Greece, for example, will
have the latest American maps and
wall charts sent to them quickly an5
cheaply ; that villagers in the Philip-
pine mountains will learn, through
films, of the life of other villagers in
Ecuador or the Lebanon ; or that
teachers and scientists in Brazil will
keep in touch through microfilms or
recordings, with the work of their
colleagues in Norway and the Nether-
lands.

Educational, scientific and cultural
groups regard the agreement as a
valuable aid for the removal of the
many existing barriers to the free
exchange of ideas. Almost every
week Unesco receives complaints from
educationists and scientists who have
been prevented from obtaining films
for their studies and conferences
through high import costs and quota
restrictions. Meanwhile veteran pro-
ducers like Jean Painlev√© look forward
to the day when their young successors
will have real encouragement to
produce films of value, films which
will be able to circulate internationally
without being taxed, delayed or other-
wise obstructed.
Film Coupon Scheme Planned
THE ending of legal barriers willi almost certainly be ccompanied by
even more positive action to make
such material available to those whose
access to it has been barred by
economic obstacles. This would be
done through a"Film Coupon"scheme,
on the lines of Unesco's Book Coupon
system which enables"soft"currency
countries to purchase from"hard"
currency areas. It is expected that
participation in such a scheme will
soon be agreed to by Unesco's Member
States. This currency facility will
apply to prints, negatives and lavenders
of educational, scientific and cultural
films, as well as to 16 mm. raw stock
for printing such films.
Unesco is meanwhile sponsoring a
second international agreement which
would grant duty-free entry to a wide
range of educational, scientific and
cultural materials. They would in-
clude books, newspapers, periodicals,
travel literature, museum materials,
paintings and sculpture, as well as
scientific equipment and audio-visual
items for educational institutions.
Under it, countries would also grant
licences and foreign exchange for the
import of United Nations and govern-
ment publications, as well as for
publications consigned to public
libraries and other institutions.
The Unesco General Conference
decided last October to circulate the
text of this agreement to Member
States of Unesco and of the United
Nations. On the basis of their
comments, a revised text will be
prepared for submission to Unesco's
General Conference at Florence next
May.
The problem of books is perhaps
even more urgent than that of films.
Before the was, scarcely any country
taxed imported books ; today over
50 countries impose customs duties,
licence systems, postal taxes or other
restrictions on their international cir-
culation. It is evident that a for-
gotten lesson must be learned again-
that knowledge is a thing no country
can afford to hamper, limit or tax.

### 74265: Guide books to a better way of life
### 74978: Where men group themselves in co-operative organizations economics and education go hand-in-hand
Page 3-UNE ( : O COURIER
ONE among every dozen persons in the world is to-day being helped toattain a better life through shared learning in co-operative organi-
zations. In India alone there are some 175, 000 co-operatives, with a
membership of well over 10, 000, 000, getting the elements of fundamental
education as part of various forms of economic community. On all five
continents, from central Australia to Zululand, from Germany and Gary,
Indiana, to Papua and the Gold Coast, vast numbers of men and women
are living out the intimate connection between"Co-operatives and Fun-
damental Education".
This is the title of a booklet
prepared for Unesco by Maurice
Colombain, for many years head of
the division of co-operation of the
International Labour Office. It is the
second of a series, Monographs on
Fundamental Education, published by
Unesco, each dealing with a single
topic or problem in the field of
fundamental education. The first,
published in 1949, described the field
and what Unesco is doing in it to
create a common ground of human
advancement for all peoples, especially
those less favoured by historical and
other circumstances.
Co-operative organization was chosen
as the subject of the second booklet
because of its unusually wide
application. In the century since
co-operatives were first founded, at
places such as the Westerwald in the
German Rhineland, they have grown
to number hundreds of thou, sands in
all parts of the world ; and they have
become for their members-in 1939
more than 143, 000, 000, and now much
greater-an opportunity for the living
experience of active education.
Struggle Against
Ignorance and Inertia
THE Co-ope- :-ative Society is formedto serve man's economic needs.
The problem of earning a living
is common to all men and the message
of the co-operative movement is that
men, by grouping themselves in a
society, produce and sell more effi-
ciently. Thus, when a co-operative
movement is formed the members are
striving to improve their economic
conditions. This has a two-fold
educational effect. First, working
together in a group is itself a most
valuable form of adult education and
second, a rising standard of living
means that better educational facilities
can be provided for the rising gene-
ration.
"The co-operative movement",
Mr Colombain points out,"can be
regarded as a firm any in the struggle
against ignorance and inertia. The
earliest acts of co-operators have al-
ways and everywhere been to procure
for themselves and for their children
the means of education. Experience
has shown that among backward po-
pulations, co-operatives simply through
their working, and independent1y of
their economic results, have contribut-
ed to the intellectual, moral and civic
training of their members. To work,
purchase, sell and create together is
to think together, and to thi8k toge-
ther is to form communicable ideas,
that is to say rational ideas".
In French West Africa and in the
French Cameroons, for example, school
co-operatives are training children in
handicrafts. Among the 3, 000, 000
Gonds, a tribe living primitively in
the jungles of the Central Provinces
of India, a co-operative called the
Gond Sewak Sangh works with the
government to set up primary schools
where children are taught crafts and
trades ; to win over the consent of the
adults-a primary element in funda-
mental education-the ancient Karma
songs and Shails dances are used
as part of the methods of ; group
persuasion.
Keeping Community
Spirit Alive
"c O-OPERATIVES and Funda-mental Education" escribes
how, in underdeveloped regions
and communities, the educational me-
thods of the co-operatives help esta-
bluish new social tissues to replace old,
dying ones, and provide new bases in
better living for the community spirit
kept alive by ancient traditions.
Many of the old groupings are used
in the creation of new ones : the Ti-
meigida of the Berbers, the Hoh-Hui
of China, the Chittis of India, the
secret societies of Equatorial Africa,
and the organizations of the Bracc√ål : thti
based on co-operation, not only with
of Italy to nome only a few.
The second of Unesco's monographs
on fundamental education is itself
based on co-operation, not only with
the International Labour Office
(ILO), but also with many experts
who showed the value of close colla-
boration in the associated fields of
fundamental education and forms of
economic co-operation. Some 45 re-
ports went into the preparation of the
booklet to make it a reference work
on experiments throughout the world
for the benefit of specialists and field
workers in fundamental education.
While the co-operatives are an
economic movement that uses educa-
tion as an instrument, they are at the
same time an educational movement
that stresses the economic bases of
learning, especially among primitive
peoples."The main aim is not to
make money but to make men", said
Father Bernhard Huss who was
largely responsible for developing
credit co-operatives among the Bantus
of South Africa. Co-operation, said
C. F. Strickland,"is adult education
in the business of life". These views
are supported by countless examples
in the text of the new Unesco booklet.
Education Defeated
SU ! Jar Crisis
ON the Ivory Coast, Africans havebett red their lives by learning
how to use modern methods of
preparing palm oil. In Kenya, edu-
cation taught that cattle breeding
could serve a better purpose than the
traditional display of wealth. On the
island of Maur-itius, education defeated
a sugar crisis by spreading knowledge
of mixed farming. In India and
Indonesia it taught the advantages
of new crop composts and chemical
fertilizers, in the Punjab and Bengal
of land reform and irrigation.
The nature of the co-operative move-
ment prom0tes all forms of education.
This, the Unesco booklet makes clear
by describing examples among the
manifold varieties of credit, producing,
buying, selling, health and hygiene
co-operatives now functioning. The
decision to establish a co-operative
society or to join one, and the co-
operation which is necessary for its
running, require knowledge and a
suitable standard of intellectual and
moral qualities.
Dr. Spencer Hatch, a veteran adult
education leader, is quoted as summing
up the problem of fundamental edu-
cation in backward areas in the
formula : spiritual, mental, physical,
social and economic poverty form a
single whole which must be attacked
from all sides at once.
In advanced areas, the great task
of the co-operatives in the field of
education is the teaching of leaders
and teachers. The extraordinary
work being done to this end is shown
through descriptions of activities of
such institutions as the Extension
Department of Social Education at
Laval University, Quebec ; the educa-
Union of Great Britain ; the Bombay
Provincial Co-operative Institute in
India, and many others. Moreover, is
at least twenty-six countries, for the
most part in Europe and the Ame-
ricas, there are school co-operatives
whose purposes are directly educational
and cultural.
Self-help in World's
Backward Areas
BUT it is in the backward areasthat the effec s of the co-operative
movement are closest to the
primary goal of fundamental educa-
tion department of the Co-operative
tion : to help people to help themselves.
The booklet describes how the peasant
co-operatives of the African Gold
Coast, Nigeria, Tanganyika become
practical professional schools for small
farmers ; how improved living, working
and thinking grow out of the co-ope-
rative schooling among the scores of
millions of members of co-operatives
in India, Ceylon, China, the Federated
Malay States, Australia and the South
Sea Islands.
Chan ! jill ! j Faulty
Living Habits
IN such regions men are not onlyfreed f om u erers and pr fiteers
but from themselves and their own
bad habits-from faulty habits of liv-
ing, lack of hygiene, inefficient me-
thods of farming, competitive extra-
vagance of ceremonial expenditures.
Instead of squandering wealth on fire-
work d ;,. plays, elaborate festivals and
tribal rituals, primitive peoples learn
orderliness, foresight, punctuality, and
a strict respect for engagements enter-
ed into. They send their children to
schools, vaccinate them, improve the
general health by sanitation and
hygiene.
"By placing them without dis-
tinction of class or sex within a
simple framework of self-govern-
ment in which they become fami-
liar with democratic procedures",
the booklet says, this process
"trains them in their civic duties,
reconstitutes a new social fabric
which prolongs or replaces earlier
forms of collective life gradually
dying out, and without destroying
what is original and fruitful in
their national cultures, tends to
establish a natural and free com-
munication between their cultures
and the modern world".
The textbooks for adults displayed at
Unesco's Exhibition in Paris had a
special interest for M. Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General (left).
Through the intensive campaigns
against illiteracy which as Mexico's
Minister of Education he initiated
and developed from 1943 to 1946,
more than 1. 200. 000 Mexicans learned
to read and write.
'GUIDE BOOKS'
TO A BETTER
WAY OF LIFE
TEXTBOOKS in dozens of little known languages, through which Unescois helping to bring to millions of people in Africa and Asia the
knowledge which spells a better way of life, were on display in Paris
and Brussels, last month.
The exhibition opened under the auspices of the French National Com-
mission for Unesco at the Mus√©e Pedagogique, in Paris, on February
2nd, and comprised textbooks already in use in Fundamental Education
projects in Africa, Indo-China and Indonesia.
Some of these books, printed in esoteric languages, vernaculars or
dialects, show the stages of progress already made in advancing illiterate
people through reading and writing to courses in crafts, hygiene, agri-
culture, nutrition and vocational subjects. They are being displayed so
as to stimulate the preparation of similar works for new Fundamental
Education projects, part of Unesco's world-wide programme in aid of
literacy and citizenship training.
Reflecting the areas of interest, activity and need in adult education,
exhibits range from a crossword puzzle book for new literates to a ¬´ First
Aid Illustrated)). used by mine workers in Northern Rhodesia. Some of
the literacy primers are printed in large, simple type, for where there
are no schools, adults are often obliged to study in poorly lit homes.
Other books are intended for town criers, for use in newspapers, by
radio and in films.
The exhibition, in whose preparation, Unesco and its French, Belgian
and British National Commissions were assisted by the Indonesian and
Netherlands Governments was taken from Paris to Brussels where it
stayed until the end of the month. It can be seen in Amsterdam from
March 6th to 14th and in London beginning March 20th.

REFUGEES Unesco referred to the
International Refugee Organization
requests, submitted by Member States,
concerning 200 specialists and experts
in the fields of education, agriculture,
medicine and technical work. IRO is
now studying how to satisfy the re-
quests. Unesco continues to forward
suggestions to IRO about the orienta-
tion, adaptation and the material
well-being of the specialists after they
arrive at their new posts.
Mass
Communications
BUND A Committee for the Blind
met at Unesco House to discuss unifi-
cation of Braille and recommended the
creation of a world Braille Council.
This organization would co-ordinate all
possible future measures and would
form national or regional committees to
co-operate with the central council. The
Committee also formulated proposals
for the composition and agenda of the
International Congress of Experts on the
unification of Braille to meet in Paris in
may.
TECHNICAL Unesco is continuing
It investigation into
technical facilities of
mass communication in the United
States, Great Britain and Eire. Unesco
experts have already left to begin simi-
lar investigations in countries of
Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia
and Oceania.
CONVENTIONS Fifteen States
have already signed an agreement to
facilitate the international circulation of
visual and auditory material of an edu-
cational, scientific and cultural charac-
ter.
ARID ZONES In collaboration
with the London News Chronicle,
Unesco has sent the scientifIc editor of
that newspaper, Ritchie Calder on a sur-
vey of North Africa and the Middle East,
to study problems and resources of theArid Zones.
MARCH OF TIME On Unesco's
recommendation,"March of Time"has
made a film highlighting reconstruction
work in several European countries, as
well as their present needs.
Cultural Activities
MUSIC The first volume of the
Unesco Archives of Recorded Music
has been published and is dedicated to
the works of Frederick Chopin.
The Organization turned over to the
Ccnservatoire National de Paris a gift
of $4000 from the International Music
Fund, and inaugurated a monthly ra-
dio programme presenting the works
of young contemporary composers.
ARTS The International Review of
the Arts is being prepared, and will
soon be published. A second catalogue
of colour reproductions, devoted to
painting prior to 1860. has now been
completed. A second album of repro-
ductions, prepared with the co-opera-
tion of the Vatican and devoted to Ra-
phael's frescoes, will soon appear. Ne-
gotiations are in course with the
Australian Government to publish two
albums on Australian aboriginal art.
EXHIBITIONS Travelling exhi-
bitions organized by Unesco are being
shown in Australia, Brazil, Ecuador,
Haiti, India, Mexico, Norway, Iran, Tu-
nisia, Uruguay and in the British Afri-
can territories. Many others are being
prepared.
LITERATURE Discussions with
the PEN Club have led to a plan for
co-operation including organization of
an international gathering of writers
to take place in Edinburgh in August.
MUSEUMS Work is now under
way for the reconstruction of museums
in Austria and Italy, and also in con-
nection with the popular arts in Latin
America. In Turkey, a programme in-
volving Byzantine and Moslem ar-
chaeology is being drawn up, and will
be submitted to the Turkish Govern-
ment.
UNESCO COUPONS The sys-
tem of Unesco book coupons has been
extended to educational and scientific
films, and to scientific equipment.
Italy has joined the Book Coupon
Scheme, and its usefulness is steadily
becoming greater in all parts of the
world.
COPYRIGHT Unesco has con-
cluded its enquiry on bilateral agree-
ments in the field of copyright. The
results will be published shortly.
Natural Sciences
SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION III
the field of Natural Sciences. Unesco
has undertaken the preparation of ten
volumes on the teaching of science,
especially designed for under-deve-
loped countries. It has also completed
plans for a scientific museum to be
opened by the City of Montevideo in
Uruguay.
Unesco also held an important confer-
ence on the co-ordination of medical
science congresses, and work continues
for the foundation of an International
Institute of the Arid Zone, and the esta-
blishment of an International Computa-
tion Centre.
Social Sciences
SOCIAL RESEARCH A com-
mittee set up by Unesco to make a
study of the origins of Fascism, has
completed plans for a forthcoming
bcok on this subject.
At the request of the Government of
India. Unesco has appointed a coun-
sellor to direct a study on social ten-
sions in India.
Reconstruction
RELI EF Twenty-four relief projects
prepared by Unesco provide principally
for the supply of materials on adult
education, handicapped children, mu-
seums, and the provision of scientific
and artistic equipment.
"ORADOUR" In collaboration
with Unesco, the French National
Commission for Unesco is now examin-
ing a project to create a children's vil-
lage in"Oradour"-the French Lidice-

in 1948, 1 submitt-
to the United States after my two years with Unesco. You asked me then, and on
subsequent occasions, to continue my work through the 1950 Conference, sche-
duled to be held in Florence in the spring of 1950. I feel now that, contrary to to
suggestions that I should remain until the end or the year, you should definitely
not count an me after 30 June 1950.
I shall of course cantinue to serve you and the Organization to the best of
my abi1ity until that time, but I hope that you will proceed with finding my
successor, so that he may take over when I depart.
In the meantime, if you agree, I believe that this letter, together with any
reply you may care to make, should be made public.

Walter H. C. LAVES,
Deputy Director-General.
Dr. Walter H. C. Laves. Deputy Director-General of Unesco since 1947 and top-
ranking American member of the staii, will leave the Organization at the end
of Juno. following the close of the Florence Conference, it was announced at
last month's meeting of the Unesco Executive Board.
Dr. Laves was a member of the U. S. delegation to the First General Conference
of Unesco in 1946. and was appointed Deputy Director-General the following January.
serving under the Organization's iirst Director-General, Dr. Julian Huxley.
During the formative stage of the Organization. Dr. Laves was largely concerned
with creating the staff machinery and the means to carry out Unesco's programme.
This included the preparation of a programme for recruiting personnel, establishing
staff regulations, budget and administrative procedures, and the creation of a system
of financial controls. He assisted the Director-General in the development of Unesco's
programme, and was charged particularly with ensuring its coordinated execution.
Dr. Laves represented Unesco at various international meetings and undertook a
number of important missions on behalf of the Director-General. He handled the
top-level negotiations with the military commanders of the three Western zones of
Germany which resulted in the development of Unesco's German programme. At
Lake Success and Geneva he played a leading role in assuring greater co-ordination
in the work of the United Nations and Specialized Agencies.
A social scientist by training, Dr. Laves, who was born in Chicago in 1902, has
behind him a career both as educator and administrator.
During the war, he held advisory and executive posts with the U. S. Government-
among others with the Co-ordinator of Inter-American AHairs and the Office of Civilian
Defence. He served as adviser to the U. S. delegation to the U. N. Conference in San
Francisco, the first Assembly of the U. N. in London, the Economic and Social Council.
the International Labour Organization and the first General Conference of Unesco.
My dear Dr. Laves,
IT was with very sincere regret thatI learned From your lett r or t e
5th January that you had deci-
ded to leave us on the 1st July of this
year.
Several times in the past, as you
yourself recall, I have urged you to
stay in the Organization which you
have served so well and which owes
so much to your efforts. I should
have liked to think that we could con-
tinue together the work which we both
have so much at heart. But in the
light of the personal reasons which
you mention in your letter, I realize
that I cannot do otherwise than ac-
cept your decision, although I do so
with very great reluctance.
When you leave, you will have the
satisf√£ction of knowing that you have
succeeded in your mission and that
you have nursed the Organization
through is infancy at a time when
it stood most in need of your help.
My dear Director-General:
Dr. Laves
ed to you my resignation as Deputy
Director-General, effective at your con-
venience. I did this, not only in order
to give you a free hand in planning
and selecting your top personnel, but
also because I felt that, tor family and
professional reasons, I should return The organization and discipline
which Unesco possesses today and which are essential in an institution as com-
plex and many-sided as this is, are due in large measure to your initiative and it
is no exaggeration to say that its whole being has been deeply influenced by
your personality. Your devotion and enthusiasm combined with your outstand-
mg qualities of leadership and administration wilt remain a source of inspira-
tion for all of us.
I myself shalt remember you as a colleague for whose counsel and help I haze
had the highest esteem and regard. I know that you will always be a firm
friend of Unesco, and I trust that, in the important duties to which you may be
called, I shall be able to count on your co-operation.
I shall of course lay your better together with this reply before the Executive
Council at its next session.
Let me say once again how sorry I shall be to lose you and accept on behalf
of myself and the Organization sincere good wishes for your future success.
Yours very sincerely,
JAIME TORRES BODET.
Dlrector-General.

### 74980: To give new life to geography lessons a West African village comes to Paris
Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
TO GIVE NEW LIFE
TO GEOGRAPHY LESSONS A WEST AFRICAN
VILLAGE COMES TO PARIS
TilE best way to learn a country's geography is to live there, but
not every schoolboy can afford to take a trip of thousands of
miles to supplement his textbooks.
The next best approach, a group of French teachers decided last
year, was to bring the country to the pupil. That was the motiw
behind a three-month expedition to French West Africa sponsored
last summer by the French Teaching League (Ligue Fran√ßaise de
1'Enseignement), and led by Pierre Fourre,-a teacher in a Paris Lyc√©e,
The expedition bore results several weeks ago when the Leagin
opened an exhibit depicting life in a native village of French West
Africa. More than two thousand
school-children visited this corner
of Africa transplanted to a displa
room on the Left Bank of the Seine
in Paris.
For these children, and thousand
more in other French cities which
the exhibit will visit, this is a novel
and effective way of learning geo-
graphy. Even from the photo-
graphs brought back by the expedi-
tion-a few of which are shown
on this page-they can obtain a
comprehensive pictorial impression
of the way of life, customs and acti-
vities of the people. However, the
most effective lessons are learned
with peanuts. The following morn-
: ag, the seer loooks at the tracks
ipft by animals who ate the nuts
during'the night, and thus tells the
future.
From Dakar
To Timbuctu
ALL this material and data wascollected by the expedition,
partially financed by the
French Ministry of Education, on a
trip from Dakar to Timbuctu, the
door to the Sahara Desert. Its
members, who included photogra-
phers, film cameramen, a geography
specialist and a naturalist, first
travelled by train and then trans-
ferred to a truck. They made part
of their trip in a native canoe
constructed of two hollowed-out
logs lashed together. While aboard
their canoe, they were caught by
one of the 31 tornadoes they expe-
rienced during the rainy season and
forgot about education for a night
while they bailed to keep afloat.
The results of this new approach
to geography teaching so far have
been promising, and the Teaching
League now plans to send the same
group on another expedition this
summer. Their destination will
probably he French Equatorial
Africa, since this will enable them
to report on life in a forest civiliza-
tion instead of a river society, such
; as they visiled last year.
JUST LIKE THE REAL THING. French
schoolchildren, visiting the Paris exhibit on
life in French West Africa (above) examine
an exact model of Nere-Koro, a village on
the Niger River. Dr Francis Corde, medical
man of the expedition which brought back
the exhibit materials, explains that in
villages like Nere-Koro r Mopti (photo on
lett) homes are made of"banco"-heaten
earth mixed with straw. The fcunily livers

exhibits.
"Air View"of Nere-Koro
REACHING the exhibition, the sonof a Paris grocer or of a Bou-
logne factory worker might
well imagine himself arriving by
air in French West Africa. There
below him is the River Niger and,
on one of its banks, the village
of Nere-Koro. The village (a redu-
ced scale model in plaster) shows
him exactly how a native commu-
nitv lives on the banks of a river

nearly all of the village's working"

The village itself is dominated by
a mosque and dotted by small rir

cultivated during the short rainy
season. Its dwellings consist at
thirty tiny huts, with minalure

liven up a geography lesson are
there.
As he picks up one of the agricul.
tural tools at the hut's entrance, a
boy begins to appreciate the amount
of hard work that goes into the
cultivation of a mil1et crop when
only primitive implements are
available. Visitors are particularly
impressed by the"daba"-a wood-
yen-handled instrument of hammer-
pd iron-which serves fits users for
everything from a pick to a plough.
And, as a girl examines the weaving
loom used by native women to make
cloth for blankets and cloths, she
marvels at the skill and patience
that goes into the Hnished product.

### 74271: Men against the desert: a new Sahara 'garrison'; the desert scientists
UNESCO COUR4ER-Page 6
For many generations, and on every continent, the yellow sand and the grey dust
of desert areas spread like an ugly flood across the green grass upon which human
life fundamentally subsists. Here and there, and now and then, the desert's
advance was stopped, and sometimes pushed back, but, today, the arid and semi-
arid zones of the earth cover about one-third of the land surface of the globe.
Today, too, there are more men, women and children than have ever existed before.
Now, more than ever, it is true that man cannot live on only two-thirds of the word.
He needs it all. He does not accept and he need not accept the thought that his
greater numbers mean greater misery. Man demands and has the means to get a
better life.
For these reasons, the story of"The Desert Against Man"is being rewritten. Now
it must be"Man Against the Desert". Most of the desert areas of the world were
once fertile. Why do they no longer support life ? What is needed, in the way of
water, fertilizers, farming methods, to reclaim them for human use 1
Ritchie Calder, Science Editor of the British News Chronic ! e, working in collabo-
ration with the Natural Sciences Department of UNESCO, has gone to the classic desert
of all deserts, the Sahara, and is going on to other arid regions in the Middle East, for
answers to these and other questions.
Mr. Calder is not only undertaking a great and vital task of exploration, but a big
and unique reportorial and educational job. It is not enough for a few experts to know
What can be done to make the deserts useful, for the men and women of many countries
must also know-so that they will agree to support and help carry out the necessary
measures. It is not enough for the older generation to know-for they cannot com-
plete the task, and the"older generations"have had a mixed record anyway in the
wise use of the land. The children must also know, for the biggest part of the job is
for them.
Accordingly, Mr. Calder is writing a series of articles for his paper, which will be
distributed to newspapers throughout the world by UNESCO.'"collaboration with
the News Chronicle, the British illustrated weekly Picture Post is preparing text
books and film strips for schools. Other publications in several countries will deal
with various aspects of the trip. Results of Mr. Calder's studies will be widely used
in schooi courses in England dealing with history, scripture, economics, geography
and current affairs.
On these pages, the UNESCO Courier reprints the first three stories by Mr. Calder
in his series,"Men Against the Desert".
opposite side of the canyon, is the Saharan fortress of Beni Abbes, on a ridge
against mountainous sand dunes.
"Look !" cried Cvijanovich (hereinafter called"George") pointing to what might have
been an infant fortress on an adjoining ridge,"that is the laboratory of the Centre
of Saharan Research".
This was what he had been promising me all the way-from the Paris caf√© on the
Champs-EIysees, through the snows on the Atlas Mountains, through the hailstorm
on the High Plateau and across the cold (yes, very cold) desolation of the Sahara
which separates Beni Abbes from Colomb Bechar, the capital of Algerian Sahara.
George is a scientist infatuated with the desert, and this was his homecoming. And
in that first glimpse of white battlements tinted with the hues of a desert sunset J
understood.
Before leaving Paris
for North African. Rit-
chie Calder had an in-
terview with M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco
who told him :"Your
article*, by awaken-
ing public imagina-
tion to the challengo
and possibility of the
desert, will render a
valuable international
service."This photo
shows Ritchie Calder
(right) discussing this
Unesco project with
M. Torres Bodet. (cen-
tre) and Raymond Kle-
boe, the Picture Post
photographer, accomp-
anying Ritchie Calder.
It was worth the tribulations of that
journey of a thousand miles (or in
nomad measurements 40 camel-days)
from Algiers. It was worth the bone-
jarring jolting over that trail which some
humorist has signposted as"The Boule-
vard of the Foreign Legion"-a road
across black misery of sun-enamelled
rocks, through ravines where men died in
ambush, across sand crusted like a merin-
gue, with a thin layer of sun-fused glass.
This was a trail first beaten out by the
pads of camels, then by the weary boots
of marching men, and now by the enorm-
ous wheels of the trans-Saharan trucks
and of military cars like the one in which
we travelled.
ILLUSION ENDS
And then to drop into the precipitousvalley of Oued Souara, with its fortres
and its"Scorpion Oases", at the sun-
set when the muezzin was calling the
Faithful to prayer-"Allah ila la Allah"
- and when a camel caravan out of the
Great Western Sand Desert was settling
down for the night, with brushwood fires,
in the square of the cases-that was
our recompense.
The young commander of Beni Abbes,
Capt. Clarisse, and his beautiful wife
were waiting for us at the gate of the
fortress which once housed a regiment
of men. The Goum sentries passed us
through. And there the illusion of mili-
tary might ended.
The citadel of Beni Abbes houses barely
a platoon. In these days, when the slave-
raiders from the mountains of Morocco no
longer harry the desert oases, Beni Abbes
is the civil affairs administration of an
area as big as Yugo-Slavia with a popu-
lation of 20, 000 living in near-starvation.
The young captain, who embodies in
his person the entire government, glows
with Gallic excitement when he talks of
his plans. Always it is water, water, wa-
ter, and the new crops and animals which
could be produced if only there was
enough water.
In this modern military task he does
not need the rifles of the Foreign Legion
or the death-or-glory exploits of the
White Squadron, the camel corps. He
needs his new"garrison", the desert scien-
tists, with their laboratory as their for-
tress.
They might be called the new"legion-naires". George, for instance, is a state-
less Yugo-Slav, with a refugee passport a
yard long and the Research Centre was
the inspiration of another refugee-
Mr Menchikoff, a Russian.
As we came through a grim defile we
passed a memorial on the spot where the
Research Centre of the Sahara might
have perished. There is a memorial to
General Clavery and his Foreign Legion
escort who were massacred in a Moroccan
"rezzou"or raid on their way from Beni
Abbes to Colomb Bechar. Menchikoff
should have been in that party.
Today he is a professor in Paris and
creator and director of the Saharan
Centre, which has its resident staff
but is also the headquarters for visiting
scientists from Algiers and Paris.
There is a biologist, Franklin Pierre,
who is assisted by his young wife, a civil
servant from Paris, who came to Beni
Abbes to be married by"Le Capitaine"
and to receive the church benediction
from a desert priest who travelled 350 mi-
les for the ceremony.
With Pierre I went off into the sea of
sand as vast as the North Sea to inspect
his instruments and dig for beetles and
insects.
This is not just entomological curiosity.
These beetles are insect-camels, which can
store water for three months. How they
find water and how they live has human
significance. ,
UNDERMINED BY TERMITES
With Philip Guinet, the botanist. 1explored the experimental nurseries
where desert plants are studied and
where the food plants from other parts of
the world, which might replace them, are :
tested.
And I saw the miracle which water can !
work in desert sand-mandarin oranges as
big as grape-fruit ; potatoes, cauliflower. ;
asparagus, etc. And I saw the ravages off !
the inevitable sparrow, which with thel
jerboah, or desert rat, is the plague of the !
desert gardener.'
r saw, too, the tearless despair of the
desert scientist. All the way from Paris,
George, the geophysicist, had hugged like
a bridal bouquet a delicate magnetometer
for the magnetic laboratory which for
eighteen months he had mined out of the
sand and rock, 60 ft. beneath the ridge.
With pride he opened the door to
enthrone the instrument which he haa
been all the way to Paris to fetch.
Tragedy ! The termite, the white ant.
had done its own mining and undone
his work.

GOODBYE TO ANOTHER ILLUSION
t-THE RA ! NLESS DESERT
THE WELL OF IGLI (last, 30'40"N.
long. 0'20"W). S choolday illusions about the Sahara
disappear quickly in the Sahara.
Indexed, the only'. illusion" which is
real is the mirage.
The illusion which I resent most is the tis the sands of the desert grow cold"
ideas. I have been colder in the Sahara than I was in Greenland.
I have been wearing a windproof coat, a camel-hair undercoat, a tweed suit, a
pullover and winter underwear, and at high-noon, as we drove in the command car, my
teeth have been chattering.
Believe me, it is winter in the Sahara, with a north-east wind which cuts like a
knife. The French officer who is escorting us is wise : he wears an Arab burnous, that
all-service garment of the nomad, a heavy, hooded cloak of camel hair which is at
once an overcoat, a blanket and a self-contained tent.
Frost 011 tlte Desert
The cold has made George, the geo-j. physicist,"hopping mad". He despe-
rately wants a photograph of"la
dune blanche"which means a sand dune
covered with hoar frost. He wants it as
visible proof of the dew in the Sahara, of
water in the"arid"sand.
It explains a great deal of the mystery
of the hydrological cycle-water-evapora-
tion-condensation-water-wells-in whichthe scientists here are convinced that they
have a practical answer to the desert
problem.
What annoys him is that Sergeant ! Wal-
ter,. the keeper of the barrage at Igli, 70
miles north of Beni Abbes, has been seeing
"la dune blanche"for a week, for ten mi-
nutes at a time.
Sergeant Walter is a classic example of
"man against the desert". He is a giant
German who at 65 has the poker-back of
the legionnaire. In 1913 he quarrelled
with his father, left Germany and joined
the Foreign Legion-in the violent, ruth-
less days of Beau'Geste, and of men who
chose to be forgotten.
At the time of a"crue"or spate it races
from the Atlas, a wall of water which may
be ten feet high. For a few brief days it
courses as a river, spreads itself over the
valleys and disappears eventually into the
sand wastes to the south.
His Job at the barrage is to see that the
flood-wasters are directed into irrigation
canals and basins where it will linger a
little longer.
He produced for me a"sand rose"as big
as a newer-show cauliflower. George will
tell you that this"rose"is another proof
of the abundance of Sahara dew, for it is
an aggregation of sand-crystals, with
"petals"with fine veins, but as hard as
quartz. These crystals grow from a com-
bination of dew and sand and sun.
. Rain-Makers  Visit
Our mission may become legendary inthe desert-as the visit of the"rain-
makers". We brought the first rains
to North Africa, the first snows to the
Atlas, hail and rain to the High Plateau,
and as we journeyed south places which
get less than two inches of rain in ten
years have had a millimetre or two as
our"baksheesh".
At one place, under a cloudless sky, an
Arab was frantically making irrigation
canals. To our surprised interpreter he.
said a"crue"was coming. He must'have'
smelt it. Two hours later there piled up
the blackest, most sinister, thunderstorm
I have ever seen, turning daylight into
night.
'We caught the flounce of its rain, but it
broke over the mountains.
Lightning in the desert does extraor-
dinary things. As the fork strikes the
dunes it fuses the sarld into glass. I have
a hollow glass tube as a souvenir of
"lightning-glass". One of George's jobs in
this remote outpost is to study electric
storms.
FOSSATUM AfR√≠CAE.-Among the first men
to fight against the desert were the Romans. In
Southern Algeria, on the frontiers of their Afro
can possessions they erected fortifications, around
which colo. ! !. ies alew up. This aerial photograph
shows traces of irrigation works comprising low
stone walls which retained flood waters, thus
preventing it from being quickly lost and eroding
the soil. (Photo taken from <&lt; Vue A√©rienne de
L'Orgaaisation Romaine dans Ie Sud Alg√©rien >&gt;).
All his life was spent in the desert and
when he retired he could not leave it.
.. Sand Rose"In Crustal
Now he is a solitary white man, keeperof the w ters where Oued Cuir joins
Oued Saoura. An"oued"is what
appears on maps farther east as a"wadhi"- a river which news intermittently.
No Slaves To Sacrifice
son, on our transitory experience of thispart f the Sahara another illusion--
the"rainless desert"-has gone.
The sparse rain itself is no solution,
except accumulatively and in the mecha-
nism of desert dew. Rain on the rocky
desert evaporates and is gone, but in the
Vast sand dunes it is not necessarily so.
The dunes are like a sponge, which
aDsorbs water two ways (probably), by
rain (recondensed as dew and reabsorbed)
and by upward seepage from the water-
bearing strata.
This"sponge"explains the"foggara-,
the mine-shafts which one sees in the
cliff-faces from which a steady now or
water persists at all seasons. These tun-
nels go many miles into the earth, drain-
ing the water. They are age-old, tunnell-
ed by slaves into the collapsing earth.
Now they are choking up. There are no
slaves to be acrificed and no mechanised
equipment.
WASTELANDS OF THE WORLD.-Egypt is about 96"√≥ arid. Of nearly one million square kilo-
metres, only 35. 000 are arable. Twenty million people live on this arable land which thus sup-
ports 570 inhabitants per square kilometre. In the arid zone there is one inhabitant for every
: ; square kilometres. Facts such as these, revealed at the recent meeting 01 the Committee 01 Experts
on the Arid Zone project of Unesco, illustrate the immensity of the"food and people"problems
in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. One of the recommendations made by the experts
Gimed at pooling world experience to attack such problems was for the creation of an International
Council for Arid Zone Research.

"Shelter"may be the labyrinth if the ksar, the enclosed village in which the
streets are pitch-dark tunnels, with the sleeping quarters overhead and the stables
and byres on the ground noor. Or huts of sunbaked clay, which would melt like
chocolate in a downpour.
Money wages are unknown, but ex-
cept in mutual catastrophe, dependants
would never be allowed to starve. But
they cannot escape their servitude
except by trekking north to even
greater squalor in the ports, already
overcrowded with migrants from the
desert.
'"Liberation can come onlv with the
provision of new water supplies and
the creation and settlement of new
lands", said Col. Quenard,"then we
can give a freer and fuller life to the
peoples of the Sahara."
On the wall was a great map of the
Sahara on which his predecessors pre-
viously disposed troops and on which
he now pointed out to me the develop-
ment areas already in progress. On
his suggestion, we came to Abadla and
visited Taghit en route.
Taghit is a picture-postcard version of
the desert. There is a red Legionary
fort guarding an oasis in a valley
between smoking sand dunes. These
mountains with their windswept plumes of
sand might pass for volcanoes. Looking
down from the fort battlements on the
palm-treed oasis, one would say"This is
a paradise". And judging from the number
of"marabouts"or little temples conse-
crated to the memory of moslem saints,
the Arabs must find it a particularly holy
place.
NEVER SEE BREAD
BUT the sole diet of the 3000 hu-man beings who live in the five
villages"paradise"is dates and water.
They never see bread because they
have nothing to exchange for flour.
The soil is inhospitable. The river
bed is encrusted with salt as thick as
snow. They are to try a tobacco crop
there to barter for Hour.
, \had la, (jO miles tn the west, is a very
different story. The a'approach to the yalley
of the Guir is forbiddmg, through grim de-
files and over a wilderness of slatey grey-
ness, aGoigotha. of desolation.
Then over a ridge, one is dazzled buy
glitter of surprising greenness."Surpris-
ing"because in tile Sahara. where the
tamarisks, the jujubiers, the scrub and the
plants are a dusty lavender grey. one for-
gets what greenery looks like.
This, in the middle of the desert, was a
field of wheat and beside it the prosperous
market garden of the military post.
\we drove for mites across the basin of
the Guir, over a surface as. hard as
concrete. But it was sand-baked stilt.
inches thick, deposited by the spate of the
Guir, scouring the eroded soil of the
Moroccan Atlas and leaving it here.
The agricultural engineers of the
Society of Rural Amelioration showed
how, with tractors, soil-breakers and
disc-ploughs, they break up the sur-
face and find rich damp soil under-
neath. The scheme is to create units
of 1000 acres, with a heavy tractor, a
light tractor and implements for each
unit, on a collective farming basis.
The Arabs witt have their farms and
will hand over a fifth of the produce
for supplying other parts of the
Sahara.
COTTON NEXT
O YEH 50. 000 acres of this valiev. whichis 50 miles long and three mile, ;
broad, are already scheduled as
valuable soil and the total may be as high
as 125. 000 acres. The"cl"Ues"or spates of
the Guir will the controlled by a traditional
Arab system of successive weirs instead of
a great dam. A dam would choke with
still. The shallow basins will collect the
silt and become rich acres themselves, with
the river being periodically diverted over
new weirs.
Colonel Quenard reckons that the
grain from the Guir and from a
second desert valley can supply not
only the entire bread needs of the
Sahara, but provide a surplus for
export. Apart from grain and other
local crops, it is proposed to try cotton
growing for the fibre and for animal
feed. Flocks and. herds are to be
increased and improved. And this
valley of the nomads will become an
area of settled cultivation in the
desert.
VANISHED FOREST
M ; e in this vallev I may have foundthe answer to the childish question I
!) ave asked everyone in the desert :
"Where did Hasdrubal, the Carthaginian,
get his elephants. !" Ma . be from the Guir
for Suetonius Polinius, in AD 4i, reported
that there still existed here a great forest
abounding with elephants and wild ani-
malt.
A thousand years laterSidTaveh. a
powerful marabout and the St. Patrick ot
Arab legend, when bitten by a snake ordered
all the wild animals to leave the region.
And the Arabs cut down the forest which
Ire lJequpatlred to them.

### 74276: A 'Ray of sunshine' in the laboratory
### 74277: UNESCO reports on one year's reconstruction
UNESCO COURIER-Page 8
FEW months ago work-
/A men were putting the
finishing touches to a
group of buildings in
the Auer-wellsbach Park at
Vienna. The buildings, whose
modern functional design
made a striking contrast with
the ornate splendour of the
Palace of Schoenbrunn just
across the park, were intended
to house a new kindergarten
for children aged between
3 and 7 years.
But not all the children who
have been attending the
"Sonder Kindergarten"in
Auer-wellsbach Park since it
was completed and opened last
September, are the happy,
active youngsters normally
found in kindergartens.
To this modern centre each
day come children who wear
a brace on their leg, others
who cannot see the sun shin-
ing through trees, or who
cannot hear the birds singing,
and still others whose minds
are confused, who may sud-
denly burst into tears without
cause.
For the Sonder Kindergarten
is one of the most modern of
European institutions both
for the education and re-
education of young children.
The Sonder Kindergarten in Vienna is one of the most up-to-date chil-
dren's rehabilitation centres in Europe. For physio-therapy a special
bath (shown above) has been installed. Its glass side and interior
lighting allow the therapist to observe and direct the exercises which
assist disabled children to regain the use of their limbs.
Planned and built by the
Social Assistance Department
of the City of Vienna, with
financial help from the Swiss
Red Cross, it possesses an up-
to-date centre for study and
demonstration. Here educa-
tors, psychologists and other
specialists can draw on the
results of observation and
practical research to devise
new methods for the re-educa-
tion of handicapped children.
From the Research Institute
a corridor leads to a row of
six pavilions, each of which
constitutes a specialized unit
designed for a selected group
of children. One is devoted
to the study of normal chil-
dren ; the others specialize in
disabled, backward, deaf and
dumb, blind and"emotionally
disturbed"children.
Normal Children
as"Yardstick"
IN each of these pavilionsthe furnishings are simple
though perfectly adapted to
the needs of the 16 children
and members of the staff.
Each unit has a large light
airy room, whose high wide
windows look out into the
park. This room serves in
turn as dining room, playroom,
school room and, at the time
of the afternoon nap, as a
bedroom.
have been installed, made of
special glass through which
experts can observe without
being seen, so that the chil-
dren are not disturbed, or
conscious of being watched.
The inclusion of a group of
"normal"children enables the
specialists to maintain contact
with"normality"in their
work and at the same time
serves as a"yardstick"of
redactions and behaviour
against which those of the
handicapped children can be
measured.
Modern equipment, and the
re-education methods em-
ployed, have made the institu-
tion one of the most interest-
ing achievements of its kind
in Europe. In the pavilion for
maimed children, for example,
the successive stages of phy-
sio-therapy can be controlled
and observed in various ways.
The handicap of moving the
weight of limbs and bodies is
partly overcome through teach-
ing children to exercise in
water. A special bath with a
glass panel and interior light-
ing allows the therapist to
observe and teach exercises to
the child in the bath.
The children are taught and
cared for in an atmosphere
of happiness and kindness,
and each pavilion has its own
small playground complete
with sandpit.
It might seem ironic to des-
cribe these children as"the
lucky ones", but they are for-
tunate compared with the
many thousands of handicap-
ped children in the world who
get no help to overcome their
disabilities. Vienna's"Sonder
Kindergarten"should be an
example and encouragement to
educators in other countries
to help give all afflicted chil-
dren the chance of a normal
happy life.
A'RAY OF SUNSHINE'
in the Laboratory
FOil the last four years abrave game f improvisa-
tion has been played in the
laboratories of war-hit schools
and universities in Europe and
t)) Far Eas.
UNESCO REPORTS ON ONE YEAR'S RECONSTRUCTION
"It takes great courage to-day merely to go onliving, for you and I are not the only ones who
have lost hope : all men to-day are lonely and
crushed by despair and no one is able to lend them
a helping hand. One of the consequences of the war
is that despair and loneliness have taken possession
of everyone, and none can look for support to
others..."
THIS was how an Italian,Giuseppe Berto, described
in a book the post-war
sufferings of his country's
children and adolescents. But
though there are many who
still view life as darkly as this,
there is evidence in the world
that man's solitude is not ab-
solute and that his despair is
not necessarily justified. For
to counteract loneliness and
despair there are men and
organizations willing to help.
The existence of Unesco
itself is an important proof of
this and the practical work it
has been able to do for relief
and reconstruction has already
encouraged efforts by men of
goodwill in all parts of the
world.
Since its inception, Unesco
has been setting an example
to other organizations by
putting aside from its own
limited budget sums of money
for its Emergency Aid Fund.
Last year it used 175, 000 dollars
to meet the most urgent needs
in educational reconstruction,
and this money was distribut-
ed as shown in the table
below.
An additional sum of 23. 000
dollars was allocated to the
refugees in the Middle East
from a special supplementary
fund.
Two Appeals to
world's Conscience
WHEN handing over 10, 850dollars to help the re-
construction of Greek
schools, Dr. Carneiro, Unesco's
representative, indicated that
the act was a symbolic one.
Though this money could do
little to slleviate the over-
whelming needs of Greece, his
gesture drew the attention of
the world to the appalling
conditions endured by 340, 000
Greek refugee children driven
from their homes by war. A
booklet,"A Child Named Ma-
rika", published by Unesco
and describing these children's
existence was part of the
campaign Unesco launched
with an appeal to all its mem-
bers at its General Conference
last September.
An appeal for refugee chil-
dren in the Middle East was
also made by the Conference.
Important practical results
have already been achieved by
Unesco's work in this area.
Of the 200, 000 refugee children
in the Middle East, 21, 000 are
now attending 39 schools or-
ganized with Unesco's assist-
ance in the Lebanon, Syria.
Transjordan and Palestine.
But it was not enough to esta-
blish schools, find teachers and
furnish essential school equip-
ment ; the schools had also to
be given a chance of survival
Most of them are housed in
tents, and some in the open
air.
Winters are severe in the
Lebanese mountains and.
unless funds can be raised tv
build proper schools, protect
and improve existing ones.
and generally carry on the
work initiated by Unesco, the
effort will have been in vain,
for the children will be forced
to abandon their schools.
To back up its appeal Unes-
co has just published a
pamphlet"Schoolbell In The
Wilderness", describing both
the initial results achieved
and calling for help to meet
the enormous needs that still
remain.
Where. The Money goes
As well as providing emer-gency relief from its own
budget, Unesco has dis-
tributed money received from
private organizations which
has gone to help the recon-
struction of educational sys-
tems in war devastated coun-
tries.
f70, 000 sent by the Lord Mayor
pf London's Fund has been dis-
tributed to the following coun-
tries : Austria (7%), Czechoslova-
kla (8%), Greece (16%), Hungary
(6%), Italy (12%), Poland (16%)
and the British, colonies and
Malta (25%). Ten per cent of
; his sum was used in transport
and transfer charges, [ea vlng
¬£10.000, of which ¬£1.800 went to
t22. 900 which wUl be sent to
Italy, Greece. Finland and Middle
East countries for the purchase
in replacing scientific equipment
In raising and distributing
these funds. Unesco has been
greatly helped by TICER
(Temporary International
Committee for Educational
Reconstruction). This organi-
zation, which Unesco helped
to establish, comprises all the
principal private organizations
working for educational re-
construction.
International voluntary work
camps, where young people of
many nationalities work side
by side on urgent reconstruc-
tion jobs, constitute one of the
most effective means of de-
veloping international under-
standing.
In addition to supplying
camp libraries, Unesco last
year sent representatives to
see what was going on in the
39 camps organized in 12 Eu-
ropean countries.
How Youth Lends A Hund
FOURTEEN were helping tobuild houses, schools or
children's villages ; eleven
Wicks dipped in alcuhol have
replaced bunsen burners andwith a little ingenuity burned
out electric light bulbs have
been converted for use as re-
torts. But there comes a time
when this pretence must end :
when instructors find it impo-.-
sihle to continue their work for
lack of real equipment : when
students despair of ever being
ahle to see in practice the expe-
riments they have learned in
theory.
Recognising this need, Canes-
co, as part of its educational
reconstruction programme, has
during the past few months
been making efforts to supply
laboratories with equipment
they must have for teaching
and research.
Just what the anival of badly
needed equipment means l√≤
instructors and to the students
who, for the first time are able
to use modern scientific instru-
ments is expressed in letters
which Unesco has recently re-
ceived.
Work Can Now
Go Ahead
ONE of these letters wasfrom Professor'O. Kralky,
of Graz University in Aus-
tria, who wrote :'
"I understand from your last
letter that the apparatus for
which I asked you has been
ordered. I can tell you that
this news is the first ray of
sunshine in the desolation that
our experimental research ser-
vices has experienced since the
end of end of the war. This appa-
ratus will help us  greatly in
our work, which we shall now
be able to organize on a new
be, busis. I feet profondly grateful
to Unesco, and I wish to concey
my warmest thanks for your
effort."
Another Austrian scientist,
Dr. L. Ebert. of the Chemical
Laboratory at Vienna Univer-
sity, wrote :
"I am happy to inform you
that the two Roentgen tubes 
made available to us by Unesco
hare arrived to-day. As I have
already told you, our old ones 
had become unusable, and it is
catively due to Unesco's genero-
sity that we are now able to
continue our laboratory work.
Please accept our sincere
thanks, and kindly inform all
those who contributed to this
grift how grateful we are".
Many simitar letters have
been received hv L'nesco. Some
of them express the thanks not
only of those who want to
teach, but also of those who
wish to learn-students who
have been able to hegin studies
that the destruction of labora-
lory equipment had previously
made impossible.
In its reconstruction ! pro
gramme, Unesco is helping to
give men and women one of the
first essentials of life-a future.
British colonies and ¬£8.200 to
Middle East refugees.
All this money was spent either
In replacing scientific equipment
or to buy material such as gra-
mophones. records, maps and
books.
In addition M. 500 raised by the
New York Reconstruction Fund
was used to buy or reconstruct
film projection apparatus in Aus-
atria, Poland, Greece, Czechoslo-
vakia, Hungary. Italy, the Philip-
pines and Iran. Among other
gifts distributed by Unesco was
a sum of M10 raised by the Union
of South Africa.
Norway raised ¬£10, 500, ¬£10, 000 of

ted to Middle East refugees for
the organization of their winter

were preparing sports grounds
youth centres and youth
hostels ; nine were doing agri-
cultural work ; two were re-
pairing roads or des ; two
were carrying out archaeologi-
cal excavation and one was
doing social service work.
One important part of
Unesco's Reconstruction work
is aimed at helping children's
communities-through the
raising of funds, public appeals
on their behalf, and by organ-
izing such meetings as last
October's Conference at Char-
leroi in collaboration with the
International Federation of
Children's Communities.

### 81278: New uses of a key-medium of mass communications show that comic strips must be taken seriously
### 74280: What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis?
Page 9-UNESCO COURIER
New uses of a key-medium
of mass communications
show thai...'.
COMIC STRIPS MUST
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY
The comic strip is here to stay. In one country alone, the United States,between 300 and 400 titles are now on sale. Some 60, 000, 000 copies
are sold monthly. Translated into more than 30, of the principal
languages of the world, they are now widely read in more than 100
countries.
These were facts given by Dr. Lawrence A. Averill in New York at a recent
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His
conclusion was that old and young were through the comics finding"escape
from too deep concern with the deeper problems of the development of inner
control and tne cultivation of ethical value-in an age that desperately needs
them".
It is around this question 01 the social implications of comic strips that
controversy has developed. One immediate, emotional reaction has been that
comics are unsuitable reading for children. This may certainly be true of many
strips. The important thing, however, is to recognize that the comic is a key-
medium of mass communication and that it is necessary therefore to increase
its social usefulness.
To do this, there has been set up in the USA the first coLlege course on how
to create comics that stress education and information rather than murder and
sensationalism. The course is conducted by Professor Harvey W. Zorbaugh,
Chairman of the New York University Department of Educational Sociology.
He declares that the reading of comic books does not necessarily stultify a
child's interest in reading the classics or other media, but often stimulates it.
studies have shown that children may learn to read more rapidly from the
comics than through other methods.
The students at New York University are divided into teams of three : an
artist, script writer and a researcher. They work in collaboration with the
school's art, sociology and communications departments. A representative of
one of the largest comic book pUblishers in the USA provides technical informa-
tion on how to capture the interest of the reader.
Industrial, government and social welfare organizations are extremely inte-
rested in the"message-spreading possibilities"of the comics. For example, an
automobile-licensing bureau would like to get across the message of safe driving ;
an agricultural agency wishes to promote 4-H clubs (organizations for the sons
and daughters of farmers) ; and a social welfare organization seeks to develop
goodwill activities among racial and religious groups.
The Division for the Popularization of Science (in Unesco's Natural Sciences
Department) is making a survey of comic strips that stress education and
information rather than melodramatic violence. During this survey, it was
found that General Comics, Inc., is issuing a series of comic strips dealing with
science. These are"Adventures in Electricity,""Nuclear Physics,"and"Jet
Propulsion."
Permission has been obtained by Unesco to distribute these. Authority to
use them may be obtained gratis on application to Unesco.
The Division wishes to develop this scheme, and would be interested to
receive offers of similar material from organizations in other countries thus
helping to advance the constructive use of the universally-present comic strip.

vital job, helping to collect, exchange
and spread scientific information in
a two-way flow between the regions
where they are situated and other
parts of the world. Last month, the
heads of these offices met for the
first time in Paris to exchange expe-

### 74282: It happened in March...
### 81279: UNESCO's international fellowships handbook reports that travel opportunities are increasing for students and workers
TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES ARE INCREASING
FOR STUDENTS AND WORKERS
EARLY last year a young American hotel employee set off for
France to spend six months working in a Paris hotel and
thereby improve his knowledge and experience of hotel
management. At about the same time a French automobile engineer
was embarking at Le Havre, en route for a Cleveland factory where
he could study the latest technical methods of American car
production.
These two young men were part
of the ever-growing"army"of
working men and women of many
countries who during 1949 took
advantage of a chance to learn
through foreign travel and study,
and who, by the end of the year,
numbered about 40, 000. Some
learned languages and generally
widened their cultural horizons,
others studied social and labour
problems while there were others,
like the hotel employee and the
engineer, who improved their
working skills by experience under
new conditions.
This year the number of such
journeys will be even greater,
thanks to the joint co-operation of
Unesco and the International
Labour Office (ILO) with trade
unions and other organizations in
twenty countries. To ensure the
maximum result from this co-ope-
ration, Unesco and the ILO last
month called a meeting in Unesco
House of experts on education and
cultural exchange programmes for
worker.
MUCH of the agenda was basedon a panoramic survey of
international travel for workers
and others presented in Study
Abroad, Volume 11, a comprehen-
sive handbook published by Unesco
as a guide to fellowships, scholar-
ships and related educational
opportunities throughout the world.
Volume 1, published in 1948, was
the first attempt to make a uni-
versal compendium of fellowships
and grants available for study
abroad.
The value of Study Abroad
Volume II has bees widely
recognized in the world's news-
papers. Recently, for example, the
London"News Chronicle"declared
that the publication offered a
challenge to political leaders"to
pay more than lip service to the
gospel of (one world'."Another
London newspaper,"The Times",
in an editorial entitled"Wand-
ering Scholars", wrote :"The
Grand Tour is, indeed, as dead as
the Doge and the stage coach, but
√† n, ew method of travel, confusing
through the number of official and
unofficial bodies concerned, and
yet full of life and growth has
recently developed. The extent is
shown in a survey produced by
Unesco".
Volume 11, a work of 363 fact-
packed pages, shows that the free-
dom to study abroad is areater in
1950 than it. has ever been before
in the recorded history of human
scholarship : seventy-two countries
and territories, as well as the Uni-
ted Nations, Unesco and other in-
ternational organizations, have
donated 2171 fellowships to nation-
als of eighty-eight nations.
MOREOVER Volume II also showsthat the cultural exchanges
of workers have become an
important part of the world's free
flow of the kind of knowledge that
stimulates understanding and
friendship among people.
Eleven countries, according to
the Unesco handbook, have made
thirty-three international agree-
ments on workers'apprenticeship
programmes, and a number of
other agreements are being worked
out. Eighteen additional countries
furnished valuable information on
workers exchanges. The agreements
already concluded permitted some
9. 000 young men and women to
travel in 1949 to foreign countries
to participate in observation tours,
study courses, and trade union
activities. In addition, TTWre than
31, 000 travelled either on planned
educational and cultural tours, or
for general touristic purposes.
STUDY Abroad. Volume 11 devotesthirty large pages to a detailed
factual description of the pro-
grammes or workers exchanges-
either for vocational ends, or four
general cultural and educational
purposes-already carried out by
18 European countries, the U. S.
and Canada, as well as inter-
national non-governmental agen-
cies.
But professional industrial and
agricultural workers from many
other countries were also given op-
portunities for vocational travel ;
these included, for example. Austra-
lia, the Union of South Africa, Bul-
garia and a number of the nations
of South and Central. America. And
in the more general educational
field, the area covered was even lar-
ger geographically.
Among the workers whose travel
was arranged under the inter-
governmental agreements w ere
more than 3, 000 trainees-young
workers and apprentices who. went
abroad in order to increase their
occupational knowledge by taking
student-training employment in
agricultural, industrial and com-
mercial enterprises. Although all
the agreements were bi-lateral,
some were part of joint program-
mes undertaken by groups of
countries. This was true of exchan-
ges of agricultural and horticul-
tural workers between England,
Wales and various European coun-
tries, also of exchanges of agricul-
tural workers between Denmark
Finland, Norway and Sweden.
or addition to agriculture, theoccupations which traine s most
frequently entered under ths
exchange programmes, as reported
by the ILO, were the hotel industry,
engineering, jobs as mechanics and
in offices and commercial establish-
ments. Some 30 other types of
work which trainees undertook
varied from gardening to glass
blowing and From cheese making
to bookbinding.
Thirteen nations answered enqui-
ries sent out by Unesco on workers'.
cultural exchange programmes, and
the replies provided information
about programmes in eight addi-
tional countries. Most of the ex-
changes, according to Study
Abroad, Volume II, were arranged
by trade unions, workers'educa-
tional associations, and other non-
governmental organizations. Un-
like the trainees'foreign visits
which extend from twelve to
eighteen months, the educational
and cultural journeys were quite
short-one to three weeks.
The overriding pur p 0 s e of
Unesco's efforts in the field of
international exchanges was sum-
med up recently by a Scottish
newspaper,"The Evening Times"
of Glasgow, which wrote :"With
the tens of thousands of fellowships
and other aids to foreign study
available there should. be more
glimmers of understanding between
nations".
IT HAPPENED
IN MARCH...
PARCH, once the first month of the year, has always hand a special signi-ficance for poets, chiefly because its twenty-first day, the vernal equinox,
marks the beginning of Spring in the northern hemisphere. With Spring
comes the re-awakening of the earth and the resumption of ploughing, and
this, at the half U ! Gy point of a century facing gigantic agricultural problems
to feed mankind, is of special significance.
March 21 has been proposed as an appropriate date on which to honour the
nameless inventors of man's basic food producing instrument, the plough.
Unfortunately, we do not even know when or just where they lived. We do
know, however, that, four thousand years before Christ, the Sumerians inherited
the primitive swing-plough from a civilization of which all trace has been lost.
Yet, that same plough, just as Virgil described it in the first Georgie, is still
found in same countries to-day.
It was the Greeks and the Gauls who thought of attaching two wheels to the
plough, athough, after their time, it remained practically unchanged until the
eighteenth century. Then it was transformed by the addition of a mould-board,
two steel shares and four wheels. Later it was to become even more complex
and, last of all, it was fitted with a motor. In 1800 it took a man 120 hours to
plough, harrow, sow and harvest two and a half acres of ground. To-day it takes
him 15.

years later,

Rodolph Clau-
sius, a native
of Pomerania,
worked out
the rudiments

modynamics.
After 55 more years, in March 1905,
Albert Einstein published an article
entitled :"Zur Elektrodynamik
bewegterkorper" (Electro Dyna-
mics of Moving Bodies) in a Berlin
journal. Men had never dreamed
that pure science could have such
an effect on their lives. Euler, a
founder of what was called"pure
mathematics", was only investigat-
ing analysis. Clausius was only
applying analysis to the principles
of the conservation and dissipation
of energy, to deduce the bases of
the kinetic theory of gases. Ein-
tein simply discovered a mathema-
tical equivalence between thermo-
dynamics and mechanics ; energy
and mass became one and the same
thing ; and the mass of any par-
ticle of matter corresponded to a
certain quantity of energy. But
Einstein also showed that the
quantity was tremendous-that
the energy in material is equal to
its mass multiplied by the square
of the speed of light. No discovery
has ever offered greater hope-
or a greater threat to humanity.
AT the time of"his death,
on 12 March
1925, Sun Yat
Sen, who was
the first Pre-
sident of the
young Republic of China, had be-
come for his countrymen the very
pattern of the modern Chinese.
He converted the idea of the
right of the governed to call the
government to account into a
rallying-cry for millions.
Sun Yat Sen himself had writ-
ten :"I am a coolie and the son
of a coolie. I was born in poverty
and I am still poor. My heart has
always been with the struggling
masses".

"M music", wrote John Wilson, a 19th century Scottish writer,"is theuniversal language". Like all arts music should not be res-
tricted by frontiers and like the sciences it requires the co-
operation of all peoples. Yet for many years it has lacked the best
medium of assuring these two needs-an international organization
covering the whole field of musical activities.
It is true that about fifty years ago, musicians founded an inter-
national society, but this was broken up by the outbreak of the First
World War, and musicians again found themselves as isolated as before.
From that time it seemed impossible, in spite of a general desire,
to re-establish a similar organization covering the whole field of music
from composition to execution, from the history of music to modern
musical education and from the classics to the popular forms.,
It was in November 1947 that Unesco undertook to found this much
needed organization. Before it was finally set up, however, two years
of investigation, negotiation and consultation were required, for if it

CONCENTRATION ON
URGENT TASKS
THE International Music Councilhas also elected an Exec tive
Board whose chairman is M. Ro-
land Manuel, professor at the Paris
Conservatoire, and whose Secretary-
General is M. Marcel Cuvelier, founder
of the Belgian Musical Youth.
What are the aims of this new
international institution ? Firstly
its members wish to improve co-
operation between leading musical
organizations and to encourage the
foundation of new ones in fields of
music where none exist. They will
also work to promote and co-ordinate
the organization of musical congresses,
festivals, competitions and meetings
of experts.
But, above all, the Council wants
to help the dissemination of musical
works, the distribution of musical
instruments and the exchange of
musicians, individually and in groups ;
to improve the moral and material
situation of musicians generally and
to work for musical culture in all its
forms.
Such a programme is obviously a
long-term one and requires far more
resources than the Music Council at
present possesses. The greater part
of its budget is provided by Unesco,
whose own budget is very limited, and
for the rest, the Council relies on an
ever-growing number of member orga-
nizations. To manage on its present
slender resources, the Council must
therefore concentrate on the most
urgent tasks, and these are listed
among its first year's objectives.

up by the American Section of the
Intemational Society of Contempo-
rary Music to aid composers and
composers'societies in Europe.
The sum will cover the educatio-
nal expenses, food arul lodging of
the students, four of whom come
from the French provinces and

THE first theatre in the world tobe devoted exclusively to the
presentation of recorded music
and drama has been created in Cze-
choslovakia.
It is the Divadlo Hudby (Music
Theatre) opened last autumn as an
experiment in bridging the gap be-
tween the formality of the ordinary
concert hall or playhouse and the
informality of home listening to
radio or gramophone. It is also an
MANY contemporary musical worksand thousands of folklore docu-
ments have not yet been record-
ed. The Council will try to fill this
gap by choosing works, having them
recorded and getting the records put
on the market. Composers write, but
often lack the means to make known
their compositions. Seeking out com-
positions worthy of note, the Council
will have them copied, and, when
possible, arrange for the works to be
performed. Where musicologists are
unable to cbtain the books and docu-
ments needed for research the Council
will again give assistance. Finally, it
will try to improve travel facilities for
musicians attending international
meetings.
These are the main tasks. But there
are others as well, and they all have
the same objectives : mutual knowledge
and joint effort. At the beginning of
the last war, Romain Rolland wrote :
.. Let us save all the light that can be
saved. There is no brighter light than
music". The new International Music
Council Is uniting its efforts to save
that light.

Jones of the United States, Narcis
Bonet of Spain and Olivier Alain of
France.
Similar concerts will be held every
month ; programme notes will be
presented before each of the works,
and from time to time, the composers
themselves will discuss their works.
The history of this effort to make
new music known goes back two and
a half years ago, when the Radiodif-
fusion Fran√ßaise started what is
called in French"Le Banc d'Essai
des Jeunes Compositeurs". or"The
Trial Club"-a programme devoted
to works by young composers.
Then Unesco, in connection with
its efforts to stimulate the creative
activities of young artists in all
cultural fields, offered its co-opera-
tion to the Trial Club. As a result
the concerts were re-organized on a
broader and more professionnal
basis.
A committee of experts in touch
with all the public or private schools

from all countries. Each year, more
than fifty new works have been
made public.
experiment in combining various
cultural forms. Although Divadlo
Hudby means Music Theatre, many
varieties of music with drama,
dance and film have been tried.
To parallel these combinations, the
choice of material has been broadly in-
ternational. The variety of music in-
cludes Beethoven, Bach, Rimsky Korsa-
kov and the classics of many nations as
well as New Orleans and Dixieland jazz,
swing and be-bop, European folk songs
and African tribal compositions.
Programmes of Vprdi sung by Caruso
and Gigli and of Moussourgsky by Cha-
liapin have alternated with madrigal
singers and spirituals from the best re-
cordings of Marian Anderson, Kenneth
Spencer and Paul Robeson.
Drama has ranged from Shakespeare's
Hamlet as done by Olivier, Gielgud, Clu-
ner, Kacyalov and others to Chekhov
and Gorky as presented by the Moscow
Art Theatre. A regular English-lan-
guage programme has initiated a multi-
lingual project. The poems of Pablo
Neruda and Mayakowsky in English
translation were presented alollg with
music and photographic slides. Memo-
rials were held for the Czech poets Ju-
lius Fucik and Frantisek Halas.
The experiment has been so success-
ful that each of the Music Theatre's one
hundred seats has been filled since the
opening day at each of the four or five
daily performances.
Morning performances, at which pla-
ces are free, are for children and stu-
dents. Afternoon sessions are often for
the devotees of Duke Ellington, Cab
Calloway and Louis Armstrong. Every
week, the evening performances offer
at least one classical symphony, an
opera, a session of chamber music, a
concert of rare recordings, and a Mevro
- a variant of the audience particip-
ation radio programmes in the United
States.

is to achieve practical results, work
on an international level requires
long and careful preparation. Finally,
last month, the International Music
Council, as the organization is called,
held its first General Assembly at
Unesco House in Paris.
The membership of the Council can
be divided into three categories.
There are the associations-compos-
ers, musicologists, folklorists-
grouping musicians in different coun-
tries according to their specialities.
Then, there are experts, such as
Arthur Honegger or Andrzelj Panuf-
nik, chosen in a personal capacity,
and lastly, there are national com-
mittees.
These committees, which already
exist in the United States and
Holland, are now being organized in
many other countries. In several,
the delegates who will organize the
groups representing the entire musical
life of the country have already been
chosen.

A Better Chance For
YOUNG COMPOSERS
SOME composers meet with re-cognition-even fame-
when they are young. Two
centuries ago when Mozart was 13
his first opera was performed.
But despite the finish, elegance and
restraint of his work, and the
noble and royal patronage of his
day, he died in poverty. Most mu-
sicans have had to fight hard before
the public or the critics paid any
attention to their efforts. Many
received no real recognition until
after their death.
Unesco, working together with the
French Radio and the International
Music Council is now giving young
and unknown musical composers of
all nations a chance to have their
unpublished works performed before
critics and other people interested in
music.
On 1st February last a series of
regular monthly concerts of chamber
music and orchestral works by these
"unknowns"was started in the
Unesco House concert hall.
The first concert included quartets

HAS LIGHT 
On the 22nd of May, delegates from at least 53 nations will meet in one of the world's great
cities, Florence, Italy, for the Fifth Session of the UNESCO General Conference. In terms
of the number of m n and women present, and in ter s of the numb r of count ies
represented, the Florence Conference is expected to be the greatest in UNESCO's career.
In terms of the urgency of worldwide problems in the illimitable fields of education, science
and culture, the Florence Conference will be'bne of the most important international gatherings
in the still-young year of 1950. History books which are not yet written will gauge the courage,
brotherhood, wisdom and breadth of vision which the delegates will bring to Florence-measuring
them against the magnitude of the human needs they are called upon to answer.
In a sense, the work must be worthy of the city, as Florence takes its place, with London, Paris,
Mexico City and Beirut, on the list of UNESCO's conference cities.
Florence was a little town, when it was destroyed for the first time in the 6th century by barbarian
invaders. In later centuries, Florence was swept by plagues, fires and repeated invasions, climaxed
by the cruel losses in WOrlO war N, Dut It
recovered from every brutal blow to become a
great and ever greater city-a fit home for poets
painters and philosophers, who set new
standards for human achievement.
UNESCO is coming to the city of Dante.
Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Michel-
angelo, Boccaccio--who have given courage,
inspiration and beauty to generation after
generation, in every corner of the world.
The quality that lived in those great men,
and in the lesser ones who built, protected
and cherished the city of Florence, is still alive,
in the towns and cities of the world. Always,
that quality of aspiration shows itself best
under conditions of the greatest difficulty.
To-day, in Italy, after more than 20 years of
Fascism, five years of war and only a little more
than five years of peace, the determination of
the people to win a richer life, materially and
spiritually, is newly demonstrated every day.
On this page, in the story of the National Union
for the Fight Against Illiteracy, there is one
such demonstration.
DON'T sta. nd in the way when a manrecognizes ignorance as is enemy.
for ignorance is the most loathe-
some tyranny of all. It stands for
filth, darkness, cold, hunger, sickness.
loneliness and fear. It means early
death after a miserable life, and the
helpless waiting at the bedside of a
stricken child. Ignorance is everything
that man hates-and its destruction
is not to be accomplished by a few
pen strokes in the cool twilight of li-
braries.
In the departments of Calabria and
Lucania, in Southern Italy, there has
been an uprising of the people against
ignorance, stimulated and aided by the
Naticnal Union for the Fight Against
Illiteracy, an organization founded in
Rome in Deoember 1947, by a group of
seven young people who could afford to
give only their free time from regular
jobs.
Work began with statistical recogni-
tion of the affinity between ignorance
and fascism. In all of Italy'literacy
had been reduced steadily during the
50 years before Mussolini's"march on
Rome"in 1922. Spot checks in Lau-
renzana and Picerno showed that fas-
cism had stopped and reversed this
trend. Ignorance, as expressed by
figures on illiteracy, regained all the
ground it had lost since 1910.
The Union's first printed report, re-
ceived recently by UNESCO said :
"The major participation of the
people will have the result of a civic
conscience. The problem is not one
for the schools alone, but one invol-
ving the whole community. From the
community itself, in a democratic
regime, must come that force and ini-
tiative to sustain the fight and raise
the standard or the people."
A BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL
BRINGS FELICITY
.-TILL, this was talk-and perhaps
there was a danger it might notget beyond the stage of talk, but..."It was felt the convention should
prcduce something permanent, and it
was decided to build a small rural
schcol at Scalo Nova Siri, near the
plains of Metaponto.
"We had said that a beautiful
school brings felicity to the town-
because, little by litt-'e. even the town
becomes beautiful-and we remem-
bered the school of Colle di Fuori,
built 20 years ago by Giovanni Cena.
.. iso it was decided to construct the
school at Sca'o Nova Siri-because
this town was very poor and was in real
need of a beautiful school."
Detailed and orderly plans were
made-for surveys, teacher's training
courses, publicity-but it has not
been easy to preserve details and order
during the ensuing hurricane of pop'1-
lar demand. Posters were put up in
the streets of towns in Basilicata
asking the people to sign up for liter-
acy courses.
"In the brief space of 15 days", says
the report,"schools arose in and. of
Basilicata. They were so popular
that the committees did not have
enough time to cpen classes. They
would provide for three ; to-morrow
they would need five ; after two days
they would need ten. Soon there
were no more teachers available.
"There were tumults outside the
schools, as at Muro Lucano, where,
the local brigade of the carabinieri
had to come running to make peace
among the people, or in Tricarico
where for several days the people sat
waiting outside the schools, quietly, so
that the more fortunate ones could
listen to the lesson."
Learning and light were found to be
identical, in the most immediate
sense :,
"The community of BernaJda does
not have enough central electricity
and suffers from a continuous lack of
light. It was decided that the town
could very well remain dark, but the
school should always have light.
Accordingly, a special installation was
made for the school and the school
always has light.
"Now it is the light of the school,
high up there in the night, by which
the farmers coming in from the fields
at night, find their way into the
town, all of the rest of which is dark."
TEACHERS LEARNED
FROM THE PUPILS
IT is not certain whether it is thestudents or the teachers who hav
learned more from the courses :
."Many of the teachers were young
and inexperienced. Now they were to
teach adult men and women.
"So we had to prepare the teachers
not only for the courses, but we had
to impart to them specific social ma-
terial about the customs and art and
culture of the locality ; to arouse inte-
rest and admiration for the region in
which they would teach, so that they
would come to respect the adu't stu-
dents who represented the region."
The Union has specialized in teach-
ing people, not in counting them,
but it is estimated that more than
10. 000 adults in Basillcata learned to
read in the first year of work. At the
beginning of the year, there were 185
popular courses in Basilicata, and
there was pressure to reduce their
number for reasons of economy. After
a year's work, there were 291 courses.
It was an afterthought to ask for in-
ternational assistance, but news of
the campaign reached other parts
of the world. A contribution of 260
books came from the Don Suisse orga-
nizaticn in Switzerland ; two crates of
miscellaneous school supplies were re-
ceived from the children of the Mas-
ters School of Dobbs Ferry, New York.
Much more is still needed. In the
words of the report :
"A pencil, a copy-book, are pre-
cious treasures and we, who have gone
from town to town, know the requests
made by the towns are most modest.
Some of the requests are : a light by
which to conduct classes at night ; a
blackboard, glass for the windows, a
chair for the teacher."
