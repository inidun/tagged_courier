### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT

DUTIES OF
THE STATE
CERTAIN"general"questions are, in
their seeming innocence, fraught with
a Jånd of danger. These. indeed. are
the most interesting questions-those
which, ü we but probe their implications,
force us to re-examine the intellectual struc-
tures on which our communal life is based.
The United Nations Educational. Scientific
and Cultural Organization has inscribed just
such a question on the agenda of its Gen-
eral Conference, which is meeting for its
fourth session in Paris on Sept. 19.
Delegates from Unesco's 48 Member States,
including internationally known educa-
tionists, scientists and men of letters, will
devote three days to a public debate on the
theme :"What are the duties of the State
in regard to education, science and culture
for the purpose of ensuring a better under-
standing between peoples, and what poli-
tical steps should be taken in order to
L discharge those duties ?"
IT should be noted at once that the very
principle of this discussion marks a de-
t part re from the current procedures of in-
ternational organization. Unesco, like other
specialized agencies of the United Nations,
has hitherto convened its General Confe-
rence for an essentially practical purpose.
This purpose remains. Delegates at the
fourth Session will hear the first annual
report of the Organisation'5 new Director-
General, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet. They will
approve a programme of action for the
coming year and adopt a budget resigned
"to implement this programme. They will
also define and provide for Unesco's part
in the momentous Technical Assistance Plan.
which the Economic and Social Council is
expected to lay before the United Nations'
General Assembly later this year.
The General Conference or'Unesco is
constitutionally enjoined to meet in a differ-
ent country each year, mainly in order
that the nature and aims of the Organi-
zation may become as widely known as
possible. The statesmen who framed Unes-
co's Charter were fully aware that the work
of preparing and holding annual interna-
tional conferences in widely separated
cultural areas would place a heavy burden
on the Organization's Secretariat. By insist-
ing on this provision, however, they demon-
strated their belief that no consideration
should be allowed to override one vital pur-
pose : to reach the peoples of the world.
Has Unesco succeeded in this task ? Dele-
gates at the third Session, held in Beirut in
1948. were frankly not satisfied that it had
done so. It was for this reason that the
General Conference decided to give its next
Session an ideological"theme". The Execut-
ive Board was instructed to select for dis-
cussion a problem of general interest. Such
a theme, it was hoped, would provide a
prism through which the various activities
of the Organization, and the deliberations
of the Conference itself, could be seen cons-
tantly in the light of the noble purposes for
which Unesco was conceived.
By opening a full-scale debate on the
duties off States in the matter of interna-
tional cultural cooperation, the General
Conference will be turning a search-
light on Unesco's theoretical basis for
existence, as well as the machinery by which
it carries out its functions. At the same time,
it will raise some far from innocuous issues
concerning the duties of its Member States.
Since the French Revolution, most modern
democratic States have procraimed two fun-
damental ideas which historically-if not
logically-have come to contraãict each other.
On one hand, the Nation was seen as
supreme, a secular absolute. On the other,
the State affirmed the sacred character of
human rights. The very existence of such
international organizations as Unesco affirms
today that man is more than his history.
The State is not absolute, since it has duties
to perform : and these duties refer specifi-
cally tn a human ideal which transcends
the boundaries of the State.

### 74056: Food from the sea

### 74058: Most of the world: an American survey

FOOD FROM THE SEA
IT has been said that whenever a
shoal of herrings touches the Nor-
wegian coast a village springs up.
This statement is true of many other
lands bordering on the sea. Just as
peasant communities grow up and
prosper where the soil is rich, men
have always settled in places from
which fish can be easily caught.
That this has been so from the
earliest days of mankind is shown by
bone remains and drawing of fish in
palaeolithic caves. But it has often
happened that fishing villages have
decayed and become deserted. The
fish have disappeared and the fish-
ermen have been obliged to follow
suit.
The fluctuation of fish stocks was
long a mystery. Some attributed
the phenomen to sunspots or phases
of the moon. Only in the last
50 years has scientifc method been
applied to the problem. It has been
found that the migration of fish
depends on roughly the same causes
as the migration of men-that is, on
the supply of food, the temperature
and the availability of shelter. A bad
year for the microscopic form of plant
life called plankton may severely
reduce the stock of fish, just as a
drought decimates live-stock ; a heavy
swell can have the same effect on the
sea vegetation as a spring hailstorm on
ally decides what should be cultivated
each year on different kinds of soil
so as to yield the best output, the
fishery experts now strive for the
"optimum catch"-one big enough to
leave just the right number of fish
in the area, thus garanteeing the
maintenance and steady increase of
the stock.
Ninety-eight percent of the world's
annual catch of fish is hauted up from
waters north of the Equator. It is
likely that the North Sea and North
Atlanti. : : are exploited to the limit.
But, as Do. Kask, chief fisheries bio-
10gÍst of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization, told
the recently held Pan-Pacific Science
Congress in Auckland, New Zealand,
the World's greatest ocean, the
Pacific, is virtually untapped. One
rookery of seals in the Bering Sea
consumes four times as much fish a
year as man catches during the same
period in the whole of the Pacific.
ENORMOUS RESOURCES
I T is difficult to assess the foodpotentiality of the ocean depths,
but experts seem to agree that the
resources are enormous. An indi-
cation of the undiscovered possi-
bilities was provided when the
riddle of the so-called false ocean
by Lars LIND
the crops. A change in the water's
temperature forces the fish to migrate,
either horizontally or vertically.
But there are also man-made
fluctuations. Overfishing in one area
may lead to a long period of poor
hauls. Happily, however, man has
also succeeded in increasing the supply
of fish by large-scale transplantations
from one area to another, : by"manur-
ing"the seas and by artificial fertiliz-
ation.
Like agriculture, fishing has now
become a science. The fisherman's
equipment has developed from crude
hooks and spears to the highly special-
ised gear used at the present time.
There is, for example, the"atom-
. trawl", which is able to fish at all
depths, and the echo sounder, used to
locate shoals of herring and cod.
Asdic, the war-time invention used to
spot submarines, probably will soon
be used for the same purpose.
Just as the agriculturist scientific-
bottom was solved. Marine scientists
were long puzzled by the finding of
occasional bottoms where the water
should have bee much deeper. An
enterprising Norwegian sent down a
movie camera and the exposures
revealed that the bottoms really were
schools of cod-fish.
In spite of news techniques and
increased knowledge of the animal
kingdom of the seas, many areas still
remain almost untouched. Modern
fishery methods are applied only in a
limited number of countries. The
main cause for this poor utilization of
the ocean riches in face of the crying
need for increased food supplies lies
in faulty human organization. It is
here that international co-operation
comes in. Since 1902 the Interna-
tional Council for the Exploration of
the Sea, with headquarters in Copen-
hagen. has carried out a good deal of
scientific fishery research. It has also
promoted a number of conventions.

such as those establishing size-limits
for various kinds of fish and provid-
ing for the introduction of closed
seasons.
The Food and Agriculture Orga-
nization of the United Nations also
takes an active interest in fishery
problems, acting as adviser in areas
where primitive methods and gear are
still being used. The organization
supplies the secretariat for the recently
established Indo-Pacific Fisheries
Council. which will seek to alleviate
Asia's acute food shortage. The over-
all aim of these international bodies is
to bring about a rational exploitation of
the vast water-fallows of the world,
covering about three fifths of the
globe.

constitute larders crammed with food
has led the nations of the wortd.

over fishing rights, to work together
to develop this important food supply

wards political self-determination and
independence cf peoples in Asia, Afro-

The purpose of this book. Most cut the
WorM, is to paint a picture ef this last

terns of power and collaboration after

their interest, their concern not'cnly
for the geography and natural resources.
but also for the human and cultural
elements which more than any other
fa : tors will determine the future shape
and history of these areas.
What are some of the broad conclu-
sians drawn frem that detailed and
masterly picture thus presented 0
On the resources side. the picture is
of a combinÜiC'\1. vf great potentialities
and ma, sive underdevelopment. No-
where in the countries described are
there the basic foundations for the in-
tense industrial development wich
would be comparable to that seen in
the Ruhr, the English Midlands, the
Eastern U. S. A.. or the Donetz basin of
the U. S. S. R. But important industrial
growth can be fcreshadowed in N.
Eastern India. Manchuria. Japan, and
possibly Brazil. In all these areas, whe-
ther in industrialization or the mere
exploitation of resources, progress wil ;
depend on new types of organization
and skill, many of which will require
the sial reorganlzaticn of old culture
habits to bring them to full fruition.
Population Pressure
IF national self-determination is theprime political factor and driving
force behind this development, tilt>
prime Ecclal factor is population pres-
sure. Without cffering any pat solution
to the prcblem, one expert writes, ( The
entire set of life conditions which con-
tribute to high mertallty and high fer-
tility must alter... Fcr most of the
world this means that ways must bp
found to increase agricultural produc-
tion. to introduce and develop indus-
tries, te promote trade. to broaden hori-
zons, through wider education and the
promotion of literacy, to improve health
facilities and individuals welfare servi-
ces, to Insure political stability and
leadership. In short, through balanced
modernization of all the world's ba : k-
ward areas a solutlcn to problems of
overpopulation may be preached.))
The term « balanced mo : lernizatlon >&gt;
Is a useful one for those whose thoughts
have been turned of late to the pro-
grammes of Technical Assistance for
the less-developed areas of the world
now under discussicn In the Economic
and Sc_ial Council ef the United Na-
ticns, and in the United States Congress
in implementing Paint Four of Presi-
dent Truman's Inaugural address.
As this book underscores, the task
of modernization of these countries can
no lcnger be conceived in the old pat-
terns of control, and will require new
methcds of collaboration between the
more and less advanced countries of the
world. This is perhaps the challenge
and the premise ef the present Techni-
cal Assistance programme now under
discussion.

### 74060: Economic Council reviews UNESCO aid proposals

### 74059: U.N. Technical aid plan approved by ECOSOC

THE United Nations plan for
an expanded programme of
technical aid to economicallv
u n d e r-developed countries
through a pooling of the worid's tech-
nical skills was brought a step nearer
completion on August 15 when it
was approved by the Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) meeting in
Geneva.
This scheme for extending techni-
cal assistance, which is the United
Nations response to President Tru-
man's call for a <&lt;bold new pro-
gramme to help the peoples of the
under-developed countries, was first
outlined in a combined UN-Specia-
lized Agencies report issued at Lake
Success on June 2.
(A summary, of this report des-
cribing the provisional plan under
which it was proposed to use more
than $85, 000, 000 in two years for
technical assistance, appeared in the
June issue of the Courier (Volume
It, neo 5.)
The plan described in the com-
bined report was designed to pro-
vide technical assistance on a scale
never before attempted so as to am-
plify and augment existing projects
and to meet accumulated requests
from governments which it has not
to date been possible to satisfy.
ECOSOC considered this re-
port during the latter part of its
forty-one day session and on Au-
gust 15 approved, by 15 votes to 0
with three abstensions, a co-ordina-
ted programme of technical assistan-
ce together with recommendations
for its organizational machinery, fi-
nancial arrangements and principles
to be applied in its execution.
The programme is now therefore
ready for final approval at the 59
nations United Nations General As-
sembly which opens at Lake Success
on September 20,
Aid Conference Proposed
ONE of the ECOSOC recom-mendations which the UN As-
sembly must consider is for a general
conference on technical aid to he held
at UN headquarters during or im-
mediately following the Assembly
Session. All UN members and non
UN members who have joined the
specialized agencies would be invited
to the conference with the right to
vote.
This proposed conference would be
called upon to (a) determine the to-
tal amount of Voluntary contributions
which might be expected during the
first year of the programme and (b)
approve the proportionate sharing of
contributions among the participating
agencies.
To co-ordinate the activities of the
specialized agencies-the World
Health Organization, the Internatio-
nal Labour Organization, Unesco, the
Food and Agricultural Organization
and the International Civil Aviation
Organization-EGOSOC recom-
ties of the specialized agencies, it was
decided, should be on a voluntary
basis, and the need to make the
most effective use of both converti-
ble and non-convertible currencies led
ECOSOC to the decision that
contributions should go into a cen-
tral receiving pool known as the
<&lt;special account for technical assis-
tance for economic developments.
Under the plan approve by
ECOSOC. the first ten million dollars
mended the formation of a technical
assistance board-an administrative
body-comprising the executive
heads of these agencies. It also re-
commended the setting up of a com-
mittee to discuss policy matters, on
which all ECOSOC m e m b e r s
would be represented, thus consti-
tuting a governmental body.
Financing of the increased activi-
contributed would automatically be
distributed to the participating or-
ganizations according to a percentage
scale.
Seventy per cent of the next ten
million dollars would be similarly
distributed, the remaining thirty per
cent being placed in a reserve fund.
All receipts over twenty million doze
lars would also be held iu reserw
to be allocated by the technical as-
sistance board. This scale of alloca-
tions will be one of the matters for
review by the UN General Assembly
and the special conference.'-
Priority for Food
DECIDING that technical aid toincrease food production and to
reduce malnutrition should be gran-
ted the greatest share of the initial
contributions, ECOSOC r e c 0 m-
mended that the Food and Agricul-
tural Organization should receive
twenty-nine per cent.
Its other recommended percentage
allocations were : The United Na-
tions, twenty-three per cent, chiefly
for use in industrial development ;
World Health Organization twenty-
two per cent ; Unesco, fourteen per
cent ; International Labour Organi-
zation, eleven per cent, and Inter
national Civil Aviation Organization,
one per cent.
As for the principles which should
determine the spending of the funds
ccntributed for the increased tech-
nical a i d, ECOSOC considered
that assistance should only be given
to countries requesting it and that
it should not be the means for any
foreign economic or political inter-
ference. Countries receiving assistance
should normally assume responsibi-
lity for a substantial part of the costs
of technical services with which they
are provided and do their utmost in
"self-help".
The Council also recommended
that universities, technical schools,
foundations and research institutes be
encouraged to release specialists to
help in the programme. The partici-
pating UN agencies, it considered.
; hould aim at increasing
productivity of materials and
resources. The aim should also be to
achieve a wider sharing of the bene-
fits of higher living standards.
Although much administrative and
planning work will remain to be done
after the UN Assembly has dealt
with the technical aid programme.
the action of ECOSOC has al-
ready taken the project a measura-
ble step on the road to its realization.
This was stressed at the Council's
closing session on August 15 by the
President, Nor. james Thorn (New
Zcalandl who said : <&lt;A new note has
been struck. The under-developed
areas are now to be regarded as
within the sphere of influence of the
United Nations, >)
T THE plan drawn up byUnesco defining the
work it would be able to
carry out under the United
Nations extended program-
me of technical aid to un-
der-developed countries was
discussed by the Economic
iand Soelafl Council (ECHO
SOC) at Geneva, on Au-
gust 3.
ECOSOC delegates first
heard Dr. Jaime Torres
Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco describe some of the
ideas which had guided
Unesco in the preparation
of this plan.
(, Large extracts from the
text of Dr. Torres Bodet's
address to the Council are
given on page 4 of this is-
sue of the Courier.)
Unes : : o's plan which is
part of the combined UN-
Specialized Agencies plan
for technical aid considered
by ECOSOC, was ap-
proved in its entirety last
June by Unesoo's Executive
Board. (A summary of the
proposals adopted by the
Board was given in the July
issue of the Courier).
The plan will again be
considered by the Execu-
tive Board this month in
the light of the action
taken by ECOSOC, in-
cluding its recommendation
that Unesco should receive
fourteen per cent of the
tctal funds available for
technical aid, and will be
presented for approval to
Unesco's Fourth Session of
the General Conference
which opens in Paris on
September 19.
Broadly speaking, Unes-
co's aid programme provi-
des for assistance in tech-
nical, elementary and fun-
damental adult education ;
advice on the production
and use of materials for
education ; including mass
communication materials,
and the technical needs of
press, radio and film ; the
training of teachers and
other specialized person-
nel ; planning and organi-
zation of scientific research
and training laboratories ;
and help in the develop-
ment of local cultures.
Unesco's Helping
Hand
I N carrying out this pro-gramme, Unesco will
make use of different men-
thods according to the
needs of the under-deve-
loped countries. The most
direct and immediate form
of technical aid it can offer
is in sending advisers and
consultants whose work
would range from adminis-
trative advice to direct res-
ponsibility for establishing
new types of institutions
(such as teacher training
centres or scientific labora-
tories).
Other methods Unesco
can offer include explora-
tory missions, permanent
regional services through
field science offices, and a
broad training programme
covering fellowships, semi-
nars, symposia, experimen-
tal or demonstration pro-
jects in fundamental edu-
cation, and regional train-
ing centres.
Unesco also hopes to help
under-developed countries
by promoting the distribu-
tion of educational, scienti-
fic and technical books and
periodicals, by the publica-
tion of special pamphlets
and monographs, and the
setting up of scientifi and
technical institutes.
Unesco's approach to the
question of technical assis-
tance was the subject of
many favourable comments
from ECOSOC delegates
during the Council's discus-
sion of the proposals.
Emphasising that these
proposals had been con-
ceived by Unesco in terms
of the experiene it had
already gained in the. field
of technical assistance, Dr.
Sutch (New Zealand) cam-
mended the Unesco recom-
mendation that : <&lt;adminis-
trative problems... should
be solved by the co-ordi-
nation of projects and not
by the setting up of new
administrative machinery :-.
The mature and circum-
spect attitude displayed by
Unesco in that respect was
well brought out, said Dr.
Sutch, by the emphasis laid
on the selection by the re-
cipient countries themselves
of the fields in which they
need assistance, as well as
on the principle that, once
initiated, a scheme must be
continued by the country
itself.
Dr. Torres Bodet remark-
ed that the'discussion had
brought out the general in-
terest shown by members in
Unesco's programme. The
diversity of views expressed
on certain points of the
programme provided no
reason for discouragement,
he said, for it refleted the
diversity of requests which
the beneficiary countries
would address to Unesco.

### 74061: Technical aid to underdeveloped countries

TEE. scheme for Tech-
nical Assistance by
JL Un soois designed
to stimulate the pro-
gress of nations robbed
of their heritage by
geography or history. That
lofty aspiration is one of
the conditions of peace, as
was recognized by the Sta-
tes signing the Constitution
of Unesco when they pro-
claimed, in the Constitu-
tion's preamble, that a
peace based exclusively
upon the political and eco-
nomic arrangements T) f
Governments would not be
a peace which could secure
the unanimous, lasting and
sincere support of the peo-
ples of the world ; and
that the peace must there-
fore be founded, if it is not
to fail, upon the intellectual
and moral solidarity of
mankinds.
That solidarity would be
no more than an empty
phrase if we were forced to
accept as an inexorable de-
cree of fate the co-existen-
ce of communities whose
economic strength and cul-
tural resources have rea-
ched unprecedented levels
with others where poverty
remained at once the cau-
se and the effect of igno-
rance-the cause because to
it are due whole genera-
tions lacking schools, towns
without libraries, cities wi-
thout health ; the effect,
because ignorance impove-
rishes the peoples, prevents
their making rational use
of what they have and sub-
jects them to the tyranny
of nature. « The battle of
man against natures, Mi-
chelet onCe said, <&lt;of free-
will against blind fate, be-
gan with the world itself>&gt;.
And he added a phrase
which I feel bound to quote
because, to my mind, it
brings out so well the effect
our discussions may have
on history : < : The haves
will ever have more, and
the. have-nots will ever
have less, unless industry
bridges the gulf dividing
rich and poor. >&gt;
That bridge can and
must be built by technical
assistance, and it is thus
that such assistance will
serve the cause of peace.
But what kind of technical
assistance ? Help designed
by foreigners from their
own point of view only, and
seeing in the latent possi-
bilities of a country no
more than a problem of ra-
pid and all too often su-
perficial exploitation ? Or
the help which seeks first
to understand the human
factors with which it must
co-operate ? Clearly the
only possible type of help
is that which, instead of
applying a mechanical de-
velopment formula will sti-
mulate new energies, will
eek to meet the highest
aspirations of the peoples
for full self-expression and
will not confine itself to
abstract considerations of
economic mechanisms, in
other words, a type of help
which does not aim at ma-
nufacturing <&lt;robots>&gt; and
which, with reference to
<&lt;Economic Man>&gt; does not
accent the adjective or for-
get the man to exalt a sin-
gle one of his qualities.
This more human view
of technical assistance is
assuredly not the monopoly
of Unesco. However, within
the plan as a whole, it does
define our Organization's
function and, further, hap-
pens to be the ineluctable
ccndition of our effective
participation.
Priority
for Education
IT is development we
have in mind. As that
is our goal, priority
should be granted to the
programmes of education
which must precede, ac-
company and follow any
economic development wor-
thy of the name. That is
why the programme pre-
pared by Unesco accords so
much importance, in the
scheme for technical assis-
tance, to fundamental edu-
cation. Nevertheless, to con-
fine our part to fundamen-
tal education alone would
be a mistake which we
should soon regret. Cam-
paigns against illiteracy are
never more successful than
when they appeal to the
illiterate as the first stage
in a progression whose fi-
nal end is not so much
learning to read as secur-
ing the means to improve
have in mind is not a busi-
ness proposition ; not an
economic enterprise, but
economic development. To
promote the latter we have
to plan, along with measu-
res yielding early but pos-
s i b 1 y ephemeral results,
others which go deeper and
will endure. The second
group will not necessarily
require more time for put-
ting into operation than the
first. In any case their pos-
sible slowness does not
seem to cause any special
uneasiness to countries
hoping much from the exe-
cution of our projects. To
take an instance, the re-
quests so far received by
Unesco are not, as might
have been thought, for fun-
damental, but for techni-
cal, education : the coun-
tries which send us these
requests want to have their
own physicists and che-
mists, their own economists
and mathematicians. I re-
peat their own-not just
temporary foreign advisers.
Unesco is naturally con-
the elementary rules of hy-
giene and training for
small-scale industries.
In agreement with the
government authorities, we
have gone farther still in
technical assistance by ins-
tituting, in what we might
call <&lt;demonstration areas,
pilot projects suh as that
of the Gosseline Valley in
Haiti. Here, apart from the
fundamental education gi-
ven to the people as a
whole, we have opened a
Rural Teachers'Training
Centre, and to ensure
teaching material conform-
ing as far as possible to lo-
cal requirements. we have
also organized a local cen-
tre for its production. On
the same principle we have
started in China an expe-
rimental centre for the
preparation of audio-visual
educational material.
Our chief concern how-
ever has been, and remains,
to provide for the peoples
concerned, not help from
without, of whose foreign
origin they would always be
the material circumstances
of their lives. Some time
ago I myself conducted a
campaign against illiteracy
in my own country. In a
humble little village hun-
dreds of miles from Mexico
City, a peasant more than
sixty years old said to me
one day : « Well, sir, my fa-
mily and I have learnt to
read and write. For that I
thank you. But couldn't
you send us someone to
teach us something more
practical ? For instance, I
want to be an architects.
That little story is signi-
ficant. Probably the old
man had no very clear idea
of architecture, but almost
by intuition, he had hit on
the precise word whose two
Greek roots bring to our
minds the notion of man
as builder and man as lea-
der of his fellow workers.
In developing a country,
fundamental education-as
my fellow-countryman well
knew-is only a stage ; pri-
mary education is another.
Hmce the attack must be
basic, and launched simul-
taneously against both the
ignorance of the illiterate
and the inadequacy of hi-
gher scientific education.
We must train skilled
workmen, but also foremen
and supervisors, engineers
and technicians.
I repeat that what we
cerned to safeguard native
cultures. Here we fully rea-
lize that any bold scheme
of economic development
must necessarily involve a
transformation, a change
in the face of the country.
But we do not wish to sti-
mulate an artificial pro-
gress without roots in the
national life and which,
instead of fostering growth,
would impose a degree of
uniformity. My very belief
in a united world is the
reason for my rejection of
a standardized world.
Union embraces differen-
ces ; uniformity abolishes
them and thereby in some
sort destroys the very no-
tion of union. Agreement is
the direct opposite of sa-
meness.
First in the Field
UNESCO has the ad-
vantage of having
a Ire a d y practised
technical assistance before
the term was ccined, for
the educational missions
which we have sent to
countries requesting them
are surely nothing else. In
this same year seminars or
working conferences have
been arranged in Brazil on
« A Campaign against Illite-
racy>&gt;, and in India on
« AduIt Education in Rural
Areas, which includes both
conscious, but an opportu-
nity to use their own ener-
gies in their own interests,
material and spiritual. The
prcgress we have been able
to achieve through the use
of these methods is seen
in an increase in the capa-
cities of the people them-
selves, which is itself the
best guarantee for the qua-
lity and permanence of
that progress. We have fol-
lowed the same principle
in the field of science pure
and simple. For instance,
our four Sciences Co-opera-
tion Offices, each in its
own area, supply the indi-
viduals and bodies concer-
ned with documentation
such as publications, films
and details of scientific
material and equipment,
news, and grants for study
abroad.
Our scholarship program-
me has expanded to such
an extent that it is the
main activity of one of our
departments, that of Ex-
change of Persons, for
which we have estimated a
sum of more than §350, 000
in our 1950 Budget. I shall
confine myself to these
instances, selected from
those which will probably
strike you as the most to-
pical, from our existing ex-
perience of technical assis-
tance.
With all this immense va-
riety, our work none the
less remains within the
terms of technical assistan-
ce as defined by the Social
and Economic Council. Had
it been a question of mate-
rial and financial help to
secure the necessary degree
of technical progress for
the economic development
of these countries, our pro-
jects would undoubtedly
have been far different. We
might then have been near-
er meeting the aspirations
of certain States already
aware of their own pro-
blems which are less in
need of skilled advice than
of material means to exe-
cute their plans of develop-
ment. \
In such circumstances we
could have made provision,
in addition to the services
mentioned, for contribu-
tions to purchases of sc1en-
t, fic equipment, film project-
tors, motor cars fitted out
for rural education and so
on. It would then have
been possible to decide on
a fixed annual budget. Ho-
wever, for the moment we
have had to confine our-
selvs to the principle of
technical assistance.
Given a plan such as we
are now discussing, is it not
possible that the very spe-
cial features of its execu-
tion call for financial me-
thods adapted to them ? It
is hardly possible at this
stage to know either the
detailed requests that Sta-
tes make or the extent of
their own contribution. The
procedure imposed by the
rigid heads of a normal
Budget would involve
unending risks of delay and
lack of flexibility.
Would it not be appro-
priate to consider a sim-
pler formula, more in tune
with the complexity of this
undertaking, than an an-
nual budgetary appropria-
tion ? A revolving fund for
technical assistance, divid-
ed, if you like, into fairly
flexibly appropriations,
might perhaps better meet
the requirements of a
schemes many of the de-
tails of which must still
be unknown to us.
Our budgetary estimates
amount, for the first year,
to about $6, 150, 000, As mat-
ters now stand, this esti-
mate can be no more than
approximate. It seems mo-
dest enough if we think
of all that is required, from
the intellectual and social
point of view, by economic
development. If we reflect
on the number of experts
available, it is considera-
ble. It is modest again, if
we remember the lack of
schools and of school and
university equipment from
which almost every coun-
try in the world is suffer-
ing. It is substantial, inas-
much as this is essentially
a matter of technical assis-
tance. In any case, if our
proposals are approved by
the General Conference,
this sum would help us to
give to that economic deve-
lopment towards which the
United Nations'scheme is
directing our endeavours,
the social and human foun-
dations needed to ensure its
stability.

### 74063: Classical studies and UNESCO

### 74062: A Letter from Quitandinha

a
<AM&A
(hlroþol ; s. B, a : ; il. Aug. I.)
THE Seminar has begun workin a ma ner which far sur-
passed our expectations.
The preparatory work developed
by Unesco. the organization of
American States and the Brazilian
Government has been exemplary.
We have received a hundred
delegates and observers, all of
them distinguifhed educators in
their countries, who represent allthe countries of America without
any exception, plus England,
France, Holland. India and
Egypt.
The participants found the most
complete organization. As you
know, we prepared regulations for
this Seminar based on those used at
the Caracas Seminar, which is
nothing more than an adaptation
of the experiences of the German
seminar as a university institute to
the principle of international co-
operation.
The opening date was the 27th
of July. the inaugural session being
presided over by t'h Brazilian
Minister of Education. The very
same day we proceeded to orga-
nize five working groups which
was a simple task, for the delegates
had already received complete
information on the themes to be
dealt with at the Seminar. At 9
o'clock in the morning. July 28, the
groups were duly constituted and
we began work.
Group I, under the leadership
of Dr. Germano Jardim. statistical
expert of Brazil. includes such
important personages as Dr. Anixio
Texeira de Freitas. who has been
called"the wizard of Brazilian
statistics" ; and Dr. rErnesto Nel-
son, one of the most famous of
Argentine educators, who was
especially invited by the organizing
Committee.
This group has two principal
purposes. First, to present
America with the reality of the
problem of illiteracy in numerical
figures. We hope that the presenta-
tion of this problem will be
very clearly made in order that. it
may arouse public opinion in the
American nations. With this
purpose in mind, we have organized
the services of specialists in the
drawing up of statistical graphs.
who will analyze tihe numerical
data the technicians will obtain
and present their findings in the
form of graphs. The group will
use as a basis the excellent material
prepared by the Inter-American
Institute of Statistics.
The second objective of this
group refers to the study of
principles of the elaboration of
cultural statistics in the Americas.
which should be submitted to the
Inter-American Statistical Confe-
rence to meet at Bogota, No-
vember of this year. That Con-
ference will be attended by all the
American States for the purpose
of defining standards for the 1950
general census of the Americas to
take place in twenty-two American
countries.
In this way. as you see. we shall
succeed in making known the
opinion of the educators with
regard to preparing a cultural cen-
sus.
Group II is working on the or-
ganization of anti-illiteracy cam-
paigns. It functions under the
direction of Dr. lhtJrençö Filho.
well-known Brazilian educator,
head of anti-illiteracy campaign
in his country, who has prepared
a working paper for his group with
great care.
We hope that this group will
draw up complete outlines on
legislation. administrative organi-
zation, private co-operation, fi-
nancing, etc.. which will be useful
to the governments in organizing
their campaigns. We have tried
to bring into this group individuals
who are present at the Seminar
who are heads of education
campaigns, as well as persons who
are in a position of leadership for
the promotion and development of
anti-illiteracy campaigns in their
respective countries.
Group III deals with every-
thing related to objectives and
techniques in illiteracy. It studies
also the adaptation of manuals,
the psychology of adults, and
teaching methods. This group is
directed by Dr. Rex. Outstanding
in this group is Miss Ann N.
Clank, whose experience in the
production of material for illiterates
is well known.
The fourth group is working on
the subject of the American
Primary School, whose deficiency
is the ultimate cause of illiteracy in
the Americas. Statistical studies
point out that there are about) 9
million school-age children i n
America who lack schools. The
Dr. Clemente Mariani, Brazilian Minister of Education (landing) welcomes delegates
to the Inter-Americain Seminar on Illiteracy and Adult Education, which opened at the
Hotel Quitandinha, Petro polis, Brazil, on June 27. On the right of Dr. Mariani is Dr.
Frederick Red, of Unesco and on his :) eft. Dr. Lourenço Filho, Director of the Seminar.
work of this group is based on an
excellent working paper prepared
by Dr. Carmela Tejada, specialist
in education of the Organization
of American States. In addition.
the group has a complete docu-
mentation on the situation of the
primary school in the countries
participating in rhe Seminar.
Group V, under my leadership.
is working on the incorporation of
the anti-illiteracy movement within
the frame of adult education. The
group is composed of individuals of
the highest type, who have worked
in adult education in their res-
pective countries. I will send you
shortly the working papers of this
group so that the members of the
Department of Adult Education.
under your able direction, may
consult them.
I am very satisfied with the
organization and working of the
Seminar. The collaboration of the
Organization of American States
and the Brazilian Government has
been tremendous.. r.-

THE term <&lt;clas'Oical stuàles>&gt; has
not that world compass for
which Unesco strives, being
confined to studies of ancient
Greece and Rome. All the same, I be-
lieve that the development and the
international organization of classical
studies are of considerable importance
to'Unesco.
Europeans cf earlier days learnt
from the Greek school to look upon all
people of non-European civilization a :
barbarians, and the Romans invented
the notion of Pax Romana, which
f-ancticns the rule of a single people
destine, by its superior civilization.
to play the part of protector of all
nations wishing to live in peace. Al-
though these ideas, had. no doubt un-
fortunate effects, they nevertheless
contributed greatly not only towards
creating the spiritual community of
Europe, but also towards fostering the
concept of a civilizing vanguard, which
did so much for the tremendous
expansion of Europe with results
which will end either in the un : fica-
ton or in the suicide of our unhappy
plar. et.
For a long time now the European
mind has been, if I may say so,
omnivorous and, but for that western
appetite for knowledge and study of
all civilizations in the world. The
idea of creating Unesco would n : : t have
been conceived,  Now this attitude,
unique, I think, in the work c'f a l ? r : g
series of gre. Europeans, who from
their studies of the Greeks became

stEEped in the ideas of cosmopolita-
nism, respect for every man and every
individual people, and universal under-
standing.
Finally, if Unesco can hope to bring
about world understanding, it is be-
cause European civilization, building
upon the achievement of the Greek
philosophers and their successor, has
provided it with the elements of an
ideological world community, which.
despite the ambiguity of such terms
as liberty and democracy, is opening
the way to fruitful discussion. This, in
the world of the mind, represents the
utmost measu : e of agreement that can
be desired.
Aftêr these promises, which I must
! j, pologize fo : havir. g thus condensed, I
would like to add one remark of a
more special character. There is no
denying that Unesco must approach
the great periods of civilization with
the most complete objectivity. At the
same time. the almost overwhelming
greatness cf its ultimate goal must
make it humble in the setting of its
immediate : targets, There ie therefore.
reason for satisfacticn that Unesco
appears to realize the neod of a certain
selection of limed fields and un under-
stands that slow and indirect results
a : e often more effective than rapid
ard direct ones.
From thess considerations T con-
clude that Unesco has the right and
the duty to give entire encouragement
to efforts aimed at preserving the
supra-nationa : ist and peaceful essence.
the life and strength, of the civilization
which was born in Greece, grew up
under the name of European civiliza-
tion and d conquered half the world.
This means bhat its common history
must he made known and appreciated,
To take an example, we cannot
ignore studies Which endeavour to
t. hrow light on the sources common
to Stalinist communism (wich is link-
ed with G'reek civilization through
Byzantinirm and Hegelian philosophy),
to American idealism and to Unesco's
own Constitution.
Nothing, in fact, can better serve
the aims of Unesco than a re-awaken-
ing among Europeans, and among
those of kindred civilization, cf a
general interest in their common past.
And it is natural that Unesco should
undertake to represent the interests
cf that Greco-Roman civilization
which has no seat among the delega-
tions to the United Nations.
Nothing, however, would by more
disastrous than to imagine that we
can serve up the cream without regard
for those who do the work and milk
the cows. The study cf classical antiqui-
ty is continually renewed by subtle
interplay between observer and observ-
ed. Consequently, any efforts towards
popularization whioh are not based
urn solid and recent research will
have at the best a purely ornamental
value.
Philologists, archaeologists and classi-
cal historians ar aware of their
responsibility. Without neglecting re-
search, which is their spiritual daily
bread, they seek to provide the public
with a better knowledge and under-
standing of classical civilization and of
its relations with the civilizations of
today. Research workers in every pats
of Europe (including Russia) and in
the Americas and Australia have been
working for centuries in this common
field ; no profession has such a long
international tradition as c'assjcal
philology (witness the use cf Latin, the
first international language of the
West). Modern conditions, however.
call for the development of new forms
cf internationalism. We need an
international organization to secure
bibliographical service any the
establishment Or continuation of
certain great ccilective enterprises, to
rationalize and stimulate the editing
and publication of classical texts, to
organize meetings and congresses, to
enccarage the production of good
popular books, in a word, to ensure,
in forms adapted to modern needs, the
supra-national character which has al-
ways teen the mark of classical
studies, and to help disseminate the
preven knowledge of our European
past and thus contribute to that work
of mutual understanding and of peace
which is Unesco's prcud device.
That is why in 1948 we established
an International Federation of
Societies fcr Classical Studies. That
is why we are delighted to be
affiliated with Unesco. We hope tha. t
cur Federation, among the many
institutions grouped around the parent
organization, will occupy the position
which is due to the heir to such a
splendid legacy.

### 74065: A Thousand years ago... Avicenna Persian scientist and philosopher, brought knowledge to the West

A Thousand years ago...
AVICENNA,
Persian Scientist and Philosopher,
brought Knowledge to the West<0 <0
by Camille ABOUSSOUAN
IN the Middle Ages about 115U.
* some 50 years before Aristotle's
Metaphysics ways known, works
by a Persian named Avicen-
na-a Metaphysics, a book, De
Anima, treatises, De Caelo and De
Animalibus, and works on science
and philosophy-brought to West-
ern Europe the essentials of an
extensive and well-constructed
system. The philosophic East thus
first set foot in Europe, where it
was to remain, closely associated
with Thomism, until the present
day ; this Persian scholar gave the
world a body Of 335 works, scienti-
fic even more than philosophic,
which was to play an important
part in the development of know-
ledge. Up to the 18th century, his
works on medicine were stillstandards textbooks in all the uni-
versities of Europe. His studies of
mathematics, physics, chemistry,
astronomy and botany, his treat-
ises on the administration of thè
army and on the State land taxes,
his epistle on love, his correspond-
ence with other scientists of the
time, his philosophical, legal, lin-
guistic and poetic works, and even
his commentaries on magic, entitle
him to be considered as one of the
most striking figures in world civi-
lization.
A thousand lunar years ago, in
980 A. D., Abu All al Husain ibn
Abdallah ibn Sina, called Avicen-
na, was born at Afsana, near Bo-
khara, in Persia. Thanks to the
care lavished upon him in child-
hood, he very early acquired a
wide learning unusual among his
contemporaries. Although a Per-
sian, he wrote all his works in
Arabic, and only a few poems, a
'treatise on pulsation and another
'on the principles Of science were
written in his native language.
What we know of his life we have
learnt from himself. His follower,
AI Juzjani, added some details, and
writers from Al Qifti onwards have
repeated what is known, while Ibn
Khallikan and Abu Osaybia added
comments.
Opened Medical School
LIKE all good Muslims, he first
learnt the Koran ; he then
made the acquaintance of
Arabic literature, Greek philosophy,
law, theology, medicine, geometry,
physics and mathematics. Porphy-
rius, Euclid and Ptolemy occupied
most of his time until he reached
the age of 16, when, being more
learned than any of his teachers.
he established his own school,
with many doctors working under
his guidance. He was particularly
interested in philosophy and,
after devoting a year and a
half almost exclusively to its
study, he had read Aristotle's
Metaphysics more than 40 times,
although its meaning remained
obscure until one day he came acr-
oss Alfarabi's commentary on the
work, when all became clear.
"Whenever I was in perplexity",
he said,"whenever I could not
grasp the middle term of a syl-
logism, I would go to the Mosque
and pray, imploring the Creator of
all things to open my understand-
ing and smooth away the di : ffi-
culty."
When he was 18 and had acqui-
red all the learning of the time,
he was summoned, because of his
reputation as a doctor, to attend
the Sultan, who had been stricken
with a serious illness. He cured
him and, as a reward, the ruler
gave him permission to work in
his magnificent library ; he also
consulted him on State affairs
and, generally, on other matters,
and enabled him to spend much
time in study.

Philosophy and Medicine
A T 21, Avicenna wrote his first
book, Al Majmuh, a collec-
tion of philosophic writings
requested by Al Arudi. He was
then beginning to take an interest
in political life and, leaving Bo-
khara, wandered from one court
to another among'the Emirs of
Northern Persia and the lands
around the Caspian Sea. A pa-
tron named Es-Siraji showered
wealth upon him, and for rim
Avicenna wrote several works. He
began writing the Qanur or
"Canon of Medicine"at Juan ;
and then wrote his first episl. les ;
went to Rai to attend the Prince
Majd ad Dawla, who was ill ; and
finally to Ramadan where he cured
the Emir, who appointed him
Vizier. There Avicenna spent his
days on the business of the State
and his nights on his own works.
The Al-Shifa and the Qanun fi-
t-tibb his masterly work on medi-
cine, which was the Bible of all
doctors in the East and West for
centuries, were written then. In
the latter treatise, among many
lucid explanations of the functions
and disease of the human body,
Avicenna says that"the retina is
the essential organ of sight, which
had previously been thought to be
the crystalline lense of the eye ;
defines meningitis as inflammation
of the membranes enveloping the
brain ; recognize the various fund-
amental types of jaundice ; maint-
ains against Galen that apoplexy
is of plethoric origin ; postulates
the theory of the placental trans-
mission of certain infections ;
draws attention to the therapeutic
properties of aconite ; puts forward
the idea of tracheotomy ; suggests
treating cases of anaemia by
making the patient suck fresh
marrow from bones, etc."
On the death of the Emir of
Hamadan, his enemies imprisoned
Avicenna in the fortress of Fer-
dajan. There he almost completed
the sections on logic, mathema-
'tics, physics and metaphysics in
the Al-Shifa and went on to write
several works on philosophy and
medicine, including the allegory of
Hai Ben Yagzan on intelligence.
Flight to Ispahan
T HITS enforced retirement
gave him leisure for work,
but it did not las  very
long. When he returned to
Hamadan, he no longer felt secure
and, with the help of his faithful
companion Al Juzjani, prepared to
flee to Ispahan. They left the
town, disguised as Sufis, and,
after travelling for 13 months
through hostile lands, reached
Ispahan where the were welcomed
with great honor by the Emir
AlaI Addin. Avicenna completed
the Awl-shift there and, as the
work was a lengthy one, made a
summary of it, which he had
begun at Jurjan and which is
known as the Al Nadjat.
So far, the development of his
philosophy had been Aristotelian,
and these two books defined it ;
but in the last years of his life in
Ispahan there was a very definite
development in his work, particu-
larly in the Kitab el-Jcharat wa'
tanbihat, or"Book of Theorems",
the last of his works which has
come down to us complete. This
"Theorems"m3rked the end of
Avicenna's development.
Unfortunately, this work has
never yet been translated in full.
We are informed that Mile Goi-
chon, who is one of the foremost
specialists on Avicenna, has just
finished a translation into French.
This will help Westerners to
realize more clearly Avicenna's
remarkable contribution to medie-
val philosophy at a time when,
one thousand years. after his birth,
he still stands an acknowledged
master.
This great philosopher and scien-
tist died in piety at the age of
57 in Ispahan, the city of roses,
after freeing his slaves and bestow-
ing his property on the poor.

### 74068: Famine threatens man

### 74066: Mass communication: experts review technical needs of press, film and radio

### 74067: Remove the barriers

A FTEB considering the reports drawn up by the Secre-
lariat on news agencies the press, the film and the radio
in'the fourteen countries covered by the 1949 survey,
the Commission on Technical Needs, which met from
25 July to 3 August 1949, spent a week in drafting very specific
conclusions and) recommendations to Unesco, in the light of
information gathered in forty-three countries over a pericd of
three years.
The Commission emphasized, in the first place, the impor-
tance it attached to Unesco's surveys being continued so as to
cover the whole world.
Documents gathered and the findings of the Commission
enable Unesco to assist in the vigorous, promotion of the free
flow of information. As a source of reference, the importance
of the assembled data cannot be over-estimated and the Com-
mission noted the value of this documentation to many Depart-
ments of Unesco, to government services, professional associa-
tions and private workers in the press, film and radio who have
asked for either information or advice. The Commission was of
the opinion that eventually, when the world survey was com-
pleted, the collected reports, carefully brought up to date, should
be published as four separate volumes dealing respectively with
new agencies. press, film and radio. Subsequently, annual sup-
plements should be issued keeping the information up to date.
Fruit/ul Cooperation
THE Commission was glad to note the fruitful co-operationestablished between the Mass Communications Department
and the appropriate organs of the United Nations and the Spe-
ciJalized. Agencies, and particularly with the Sub-Commission on
Freedom of Information and of the Press, the FAO (in. ques-
tions related to newsprint), the Economic Commission for
Eurqpe, the International Trade Organization (GATT) and the
International Telecommunications Union. The Commission
asked that this co-operation be developed to the greatest pos-
sible degree.
It alSo recommended that the survey reports and the recom-
mendations as a whole should be taken into account in the
plans for technical assistance and economic development at
present being considered by the JUndted Nations and its Spe-
cialized Agencies.
Experts considered that the information collected by Unesoo,
<&lt; which presents a unique picture of the existing facilities for
the diffusion of ideas by word and image» : should be brought to
the knowledge of persons and organizations that could make use'
of it. The reports published after each survey, and the annual
supplements could obviously contain only apart of all the
information collected. The Commission considered that Unesco
should use this non-published information by arranging for
the publication of pamphlets on a number of special subjects.
Professional Training
THE Commission laid particular stress on professional train-ing. Thus iJt reaffirmed and supplemented the suggestion
made by previous commissions especially as regards the
establishment of an International Institute olf Press and Informa-
tion. The Commission regarded it as essential that a beginning
be made with this project in the course of 1950.
It was also recommended, firstly, that missions of experts
should'be sent to the more needy countries and should help
them, at their request, to institute new services or develop those
already in existence, and secondly that Unesco should organize
a number of seminars for radio and film personnel.
The Commission furthennore suggested a number of supple-
mentary enterprises, regarding the : use of printing characters
for printing in Asiatic languages ; the organization of collective
listening, etc.
Finally, it4 suggested the setting up of <&lt; permanent advisory
committees... composed of persons throughout the world who
have a specialized knowledge of these individual and technical
subjects : ».
It should be noted that the experts of the Commission on
Technical Needs were careful to suggest to Unesco only concrete
and practical tasks that could, for the most part, be carried out
with the appropriations and staff available to the Mass Com-
munications Department and certain other Unesco Departments
directly concerned.
REMOVE THE BARRIERS
By Julian. BEHßSTOCK,
Head of the Free Flow Division
<&lt; Division of Free Flow
of Information >&gt; is the
rather high-sounding title
given to that section of
Unesco which'seeks to en-
able the people of diffe-
rent countries to know
each other better by ex-
changing ideas and infor-
mation.
You have a personal
stake in the success of this
Division if :
You have been prevented
from ordering books from
abroad because of the for-
eign exchange regulations
in force in your country ;
Your newspaper prints
scarcely any foreign news
because it lacks news-
print ;
You have been unable to
afford a favourite foreign
print because of high Cus-
toms duties ;
As a start in removing
these and many similar
obstacles to the free flow
of information between
countries Unesco has
placed emphasis on a few
key problems capable of
yielding practical recults.
EVERYTHING good
in the world-every
chance for a peace
anì men that will last for-
ever. every hope for a happier
and nobler life-stumbles ever
the ugly fact that there is not
enough food for the people of
the earth.'
The ways are known,
whereby food enough can be
produced for any population
that experts now foresee, but
the ways are known to the
few and not to the many.
Even the fact of widespread
hunger-the very existence of
the problem-is not generally
understood, except by those
who are hungry.
Tragically, facts lie neglect-
ed and forgotten in libraries,
By Peter DUBEBG
which ar needed in the fields.
Fragments of the complex plan
which will some day end the
fear of starvation remain un-
coordinated.
The United Nations Edu-
caticnal Scientific and Cul-
tural Organisation is working
to bring the facts to every
person who can read (mean-
while striving to increase their
number). Unesco has arrang-
ed publication of a series
of pamphlets on Food and
Pecple which are being printed
in English, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, German and
Danish, with more translations
still to come. for worldwide
mass distribution.
Fourth and latest of these
pamphlets is"U. N. tackles the
Problem"prepared by Peter
Kihss, writer for the"New
York Herald Tribune"and
; authority on the work of
the United Nations. The
pamphlet sets forth the broad
outlines of the food problem.
tells of methods used to attack
it and suggests ways in which
everyone may aid these
efforts.
Other pamphlets include
'Fcod and People", a debate
between Aldous Huxley and
Sir John Russell on the
feasibility of solving the
hunger problem ;"Alphabet
of the Soil", by Dr. Guillem-
mo Nannetti, which tells of
the means for fighting soil
erosion; : a d "The Family's
Fcod"by Margaret Mead.
which tells how existing food
stocks may best be used for
u t m 0 s t nutritional values.
Supplementary materials such
as discussion guides and
picture booklets also are
available.
The Bureau of Current
Affairs, 117 Piccadilly, Lon-
den W.l, is publishing the
pamphlet series in English.
Arrangements are being made
with publishers in Latin
America and other areas in
order that these texts may be
as widely reproduced as
possible. They ill also be
obtainable through the Unesco
National Commissions of most
member nations.
Reducing Economic
Obstacles
T HUS, a great deal ofattention has been
given to overcoming eco-
nomic obstacles.
A far-reaching proposal
was submitted in March
to a 34-nation conference
on tariffs and trade at
Annecy, France, asking
the conference to reduce
duties on a wide range of
educational and scientific
materials.
The Annecy Conference,
in response to Unesco's re-
quest, reduced duties on
radio receivers and other
items of an educational
character. In addition the
34 nations pledged that in
future tariff negotiations
they would continue to
<&lt; assist in furthering the
objectives sought by Unes-
co >&gt;.
Cho-operation with
U. N. Economic Commis-
sions
e COMPEMENTING theaction to secure re-
duction of Customs duties,
Unesco has launched a
major campaign, in con-
junction with the Regional
Economic Commissions of
the United Nations, to
theirhelp countries satisfy their
requirements and cul-
tonal, scientific and cul-
tural materials, despite
acute shortages of foreign
exchange.

then circulated to govern-
ments for indications as to

exporters. On the basis of
the information received,
Unesco and the Economic

tate the conclusion of

Recommendations
to Governments
EARLY in the yearthe Director-Gelîeral
sent Member States a me-
morandum recommending
the release of larger
amounts of foreign ex-
change for educational
purchases and the simpli-
fication and co-ordination
of import procedures.
Other recommendations,
in preparation, request
wider application of plans
adopted under the auspi-
ces of the Universal Postal
Union to permit payment
in national currency for
subscriptions to foreign
newspapers and periodi-
cals and for a reduction
of 50 per cent. on postal
charges for printed matter.
Action at
Telecommunications
Conference
A T a number of techni-cal conferences under
the sponsorship of the In-
ternational Telecommuni-
cations Union, Unesco
has represented the pub-
lic's interest in receiving

called for greater priors

rates for press messages.
A Washington Conference
of Inter-American broad-
casting services adopted a
number of Unesco-initiat-
ed recommendations on
the use of radio in the
interests of peace and in
the fight against illiteracy.
The most striking suc-
cess was obtained at a 63-
nation Conference in Me-
xico for the world-wide
allocation of high frequer.-
cies. At Unesco's sugges-
tion, the Conference in
February pledged that the
frequencies allocated at
Mexico would not be used
<&lt; for purposes contrary to
mutual understanding and
tolerance >&gt;. The Fourth
Session of the General
Conference has been asked
to take the first steps
towards transforming that
pledge into an internation-
al convention on the use
of broadcasting for peace.
Freedom of information
MOTIVATED again byits concern for a
more rational use of the
means of mass communi-
cation, Unesco has prepar-
ed a number of brochures
for publication on subjects
such as professional train-
ing for journalism, and
education by radio.
Among other continuing
Unesco activities to pro-
mote more abundant and
better quality information
is its plan for the esta-
blishment of an Interna-
tional Institute of Press
and Information.

We are therefore v e r y
happy to be able to giveour readers news of current

wise do,.. We have immedia-
tely used some of the arti-
cles in Unesco Features

be of educational value to

tor of Quarante-Quatre,
A g e n, Lot-et-Garonne,
France. And the editor of a
newspaper in Wurttemberg,
Germany, writes as follows :
<&lt; Wet h a n k you for
the first issue of your out-
standing service. The con-
tents are of great help for
our editorial work and we
are sure to make use of it.»
Mr. Song Thian Eng of
the Sarawak Tribune tells
us how welcome the service
is and promises that Unesco
Features will be published
in the editorial column of
his paper, which also will
make good use of the short
items.
The Information Officer
of the French administra-
tion in Dahomey writes :
<&lt; I can assure you that
your articles will be appre-
ciated by the readers of
« France-Dahomey>&gt;, which
is the official organ of the
Dahomey colony. >&gt;
These few extracts from
many letters received by the
Press Unit well illustrate
the scope and aim of the
newly started « Unesco
Features >&gt;. Of the many
thousand recipients of this
fortnightly press service the
majority arse provincial
newspapers and the press
in under-developed areas.
It is this press which
Unesco Features mainly
serves. Items and articles
of r e c e n t advances in
science and technology are
of interest to newspaper
readers in all countries :
the race between growing
populations and the world's
food resources is a problem
for all humanity ; huma. n
rights concern all. Man is
curious and willing to
learn. He is not satisfied
with the news from his re-
ligion, his tribe, his village.
He wants to read about
other peoples. Unesco Fea-
tures tries to help satisfy
this need. Every fortnight
well over 5, 000 words of ar-
ticles and short items are
being sent from Unesco
House in the English,
French and Spanish lan-
guages to newspaper editors
in all countries where
Unesco operates.
The periodical publication
« News from Unesco >&gt; has
been incorporated in the
Unesco Features which is
now produced jointly by
the Mass COInmunk...", OlJ.
Public Information and Na-
tural Sciences departments.
H. J. Timperley is the edi-
tor.
Unesco gives still another
service to the press : spa-
cial articles, sometimes of
considerable length and
often written by outside ex-
perts. These articles are
being sent to carefully se-
lected magazines, special-
ized periodicals and big
newspapers, which are gi-
ven the exclusive rights for
their countries or areas.
The letters and cuttings
that have come in indicate
that Unesco features is al-
ready fulfilling a useful
service. Unesco Features is
one of the most powerful
means to reach the masses,
demonstrates the Unesco
method and creates sympa-
thy for Unesco's aims.
,.. UNESO FEAJTUBE'S
How the Set. vice Works
WHEREAS the fortnightly service is being produced mainlyfor the provincial press, the Special Service of Unesco
Features serves the big dailies, weeklies and monthlies on an
individual basis. The articles in the service deal largely with
the same subjects as the fortnightly features, but with a diffe-
rence. Prominent writers and scholars develop themes and
treat subjects on a slightly less popular level and at greater
length than in the fortnightly service. Writers like Pearl Buck,
! gnazio Si ! one. Martha Gelhorn, lin Yu Tang and Stuart Chase,
scholars like Hans Kohn and Henri Peyre have already contri-
buted or promised original articles for this service. leading
publications like the World Review, leader and United Nations
World in London, Combat in Paris, Corriere della Sera in
Milan, Verdens Gañg in Oslo, Cape Argus in Cape Town and
the Indian News Chronicle in Delhi, have already accepted
Unesco Features Specials.
This service makes use. also of already published articles of
special Unesco interest, obtaining the rights for publication in
all countries except in that of original appearance. The most
important deal in this reprint field has been the acquisition of
15 articles on cancer research written by lester Grant, which
appeared in the New York Herald Tribune, this summer. This
series-an outstanding achievement in science journalism-
will now be made available to readers in all or most of Unesco's
member states.
The Special Features Service has, like the fortnightly, only
just commenced. But even this short experience seems to prove
that carefully and imaginatively'planned subjects assigned to
selected writers of recognized quality and distributed in a
t sharp-shooting x manner can obtain really good results.

The facilities of the Radio Unit
are used by other specialized agencies
when something is going en in Paris
of special interest to them. It has
made recordings for the U. N.
Information Office and the Unicef
Office in Paris and the F. A. O.
A mobile recording unit has recent-
ly been added to the radio unit, and
has been used to prepare a special
series of programmes on International
Voluntary Work Camps. A Unesco
radio officer visited the camps, record-
ing interviews with the staff and the
young people who work there.
During the recent radio exhibition
in Zurich, an entire floor was devoted
to special exhibits dealing with
Unesco's radio work. The Swiss
Radio presented a special programme
prepared in the studio at Unesco
House.
A regular part of the radio output
is the weekly"Unesco World
Review"now being used in 38
countries and territories. It is sent
cut in English, French and Spanish.
National radio organizations fre-
qumtly ask for special services from
Unesco.
The Radio Unit has made it
possible for many people in distant
places hear the speeches of the
Director-Generai, Dr. Torres Bodet.
Some of his addresses, such as the one
delivered at the Elsinore Conference,
are recorded in advance. They are
then sent by air to radio stations all
over the world. The local radio
stations are then ahle to broadcast the
speech to their listeners simultaneouslv
with its actual presentation
t rPyuently the Radio Unit turns
out some programmes which might
seem, at first glance, somewhat out-
side its sphere. For example, a
special interview was recorded with
Miss Myrna Loy for rebroadcast in
the United States. But Miss Loy
was not speaking as a motion picture
star. She spoke as an active worker
fer Unesco-a member of the South-
ern California Council.
Seventeen languages have been used
in the recordings made by Unesco
radio.
Three thousand special scripts have
been sent out, not including the regular
"Unescc World Review",
The voice of Unesco has already
been heard by radio listeners in all
cf the continents of the world.

### 74071: Human rights: UNESCO exhibition in Paris

### 74072: Human rights and public opinion

THEN. on 10 December1948, the General As-
sembly of the United
Nations promulgated the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, it did
no more than place the coping stone

are today our most treasured

AND PIJBII[ OPINION
THE Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted last December by
the United Nations General Assembly will remain <just another document :.
unless public opinion as a whole supports he Declaration by declaring its
will that each of the Rights proclaimed to it shall be converted into fact.
This was one of the main points emphasised by, M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director General of Unesco, when. he addressed the closing session of the Third
Annual Summer School of the World Federation of United Nations Associations,
at Geneva, on August 23. Students from 20 nations, who attended the school
this year, heard lectures principally on the subjects of Food and. People-a Unesco
: neme-and the Rights of Man.
Unesco is pecoming well-known in Japan. This poster was issued to publicize Unesco's
work for the recognition of Human Rights.
on a task begun in past millenia.
Throughout the word, since the
beginning of history, man has con-
tinually risen in revolt against the
powers that sought to enslave
him
We are too ready to believe that
human rights were born in the Wast.
In fact the whole world has been the
battlefield of the fight for liberty,
carried on by men knowing nothing
of what others were doing for the
same purpose in countries of whose
very existence they were unaware.
Unesco undertook, at its General
Conference in Beirut, to disseminate
knowledge of that Declaration, and
to that end it is arranging a Human
Rights Exhibition at the Musée Gal-
liéra in Paris. The exhibition will
coin and from Confucius to Lamen-
nais..
Though the exhibition's purpose is
to draw attention to the magnitude
of their efforts, it will also
demonstrate that these Rights are
still a brittle thing.
It is Unesco's intention, under
a plan of which this exhibition is
only one stage, to give men a clearer
awareness of their rights. They will
thus be able to defend them better
and, particularly, to respect them
more.
The Human Rights Exhibition is to
be inaugurated on 29 September by
the President of the Republic, the
President of the General Conference
and the Director-General of Unesco.

This, said M. Torres Bodet, was the

ments that signed it and then of the
United Nations and their Specialized
Agencies. Unesco, at least, was fully
2ware of its duty and had made every

### 74074: Figures that hit

### 74073: An Index card stopped an epidemic

AN INDEX CARD
STOPPED AN EPIDEMIC
L A5T winter a strange disease paralysed the largest automobile factory
in France. In one week, 500 workmen were off the job their eyes
sWQIlen shut by a burning, blinding inflammation. The disease had
never before been seen in France. Scientists at the famed Pasteur Institute
suspected it was a rare tropical malady known as keredo-conjunct : vitis.
Searching their files for a clue to check the epidemic, they found a small
white card. This card mentioned a magazine article in an American medical
journals. issue of January 1943.
A scientist observes the Heavens with a Schmidt telescope at the world-famous
Observatory on Mount Palomar in Californi. With this telescope, an Atlas of the
Heavens is being made. Through Unesco's aid, many international research stations are
doing similar pioneer work in the field of the Natural Sciences.
From the article, which because
of the war they had never seem, the
French scientists learned that the same
eye infection had struck d) e huge
Kaiser shipyards of California during
the war.
Doctors at Columbia Medical
Center had developed a cure, and
fully described it in the magazine
article. Thus, in less than) an
hour-thanks to the liule white
card-the French scientists had a
tool to work with. In a few weeks
they stamped out the epidemic at the
factory.
The small white index card
contained what scientists call an
cornet. An abstract is a summary
or short description of a longer article.
Today a man would have to spend
his full 40-hour week merely to read
the titles of the million or so articles
appearing each year. That is why
in every field there are periodicals
devoted to printing abstracts, and
that is why most scientists make it
their business to read through the
ON March 19, 1949, the world-
famous English scientific
magazine nature wrote :
<&lt;Already, the International
Scientific Unions are functioning
more effectively because of the
help given to them by Unesco,
which has contributed during 1947
and 1948 about half a million dol-
lars in grants-in-aid to the Unions
and has been instrumental in the
formation of a new International
Union for the Protection of Na-
ture.
<&lt;The wisdom of using existing
organization in this way cannot
be challenged, and with its fel-
lowship programme, facilitating
the interchange of men of science
and other scholars and its work
in the reconstruction and rehabi-
litation of learned institutions, the

life would be proposed.
The Conference was opened by
Dr. Frank Malina on behalf of
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, w1w sent a
message of welcome to the dele-
gates.
THESE are the facts in figuresbehind this statement by Na-
ture.
During 1947, Unesco spent about
a quarter of a million dollars on
the purchase and shipment of
scientific equipment to the war-
devastated countries of Europe
and Asia. The equipment, much
of it purchased from war-surplus
stores, consisted of workshop sets
and laboratory apparatus of gene-
ral utility such as microscopes,
analytical balances, epidiascopes,
electrical meters, etc. These goods
were shipped to the Ministers of
Education of eight countries for
distribution to schools and uni-
versities. The equipment was sent
principally to Poland, Greece, Cze-
choslovakia, China and the Phi-
lippines. Later in the year, some
was also sent to Austria, Hungary
and Italy.
During 1948, Unesco decided to
operate a new scheme : credits
were allocated to various institu-
tions in the war-damaged coun-
tries for the purchase of scientific
equipment, of their own choice,
through Unesco. The advantage of
this scheme is that the schools and
universities were enabled to pur-
chase what they need most from
outside sources. Eleven benefi-
chary countries were participating
in the scheme, namely : China,
Poland, Greece, Czechoslovakia,
Philippines, Italy, Hungary, Aus-
tria, Iran, Indonesia and France.
Now let US have a look at
the Unesco transportation grants.
When Unesco helps 50 scientists to
go to a general congress or ge-
neral assembly it does not only
help the 50 scientists directly re-
ceiving the grants but all the, say,
600 scientists taking part in the
assembly. Furthermore, a scientist
who has attended the meeting of
a symposium or of a general con-
ference will relate his impressions
to his colleagues on his return to
his laboratory.
Sometimes the travel help given
one scientist might result in tra-
vel arrangements for many other
scientists-without any expense
for Unesco. For instance, Unesco
helped the Commemorial Meeting
on the 10th Anniversary of Lord
Rutherford's death in Paris with
a transportation grant. An emi-
nent latomic physicist of the U. S. A.
participate in a Unesco grant.
Through his contacts and nego-
tiations with French scientists, a
scheme for the exchange of assis-
tants between the U. S. A. and
France was evolved and has been
put into effect.
Thanks to Unesco
UNESCO has received letters ofthanks from a number of
scientists it has enabled to at-
tend a congress or a general as-
sembly. A typical one-from P.
Dustin, of the University of Brus-

abstracts concerning their chosen
field.
For example, 16, 500 scientists
subscribe to a monthly bulletin called
"Chemical Abstracts". When a
cheminal engineer-say in Czecho-
slovakia-scans the pages of this
bulletin, he learns about some 5, 000
articles appearing in some 4, 300
periodicals published in 31 different
languages. E. ven if he knew 31
languages, it is doubtful that he could
afford to subscribe to all these
journals, much less find time to read
them through. Scientists use abstracts
like detectives use fingerprint-to
identify and ferret out subjects of
special interest.
Abstracting services try to link up
the various fields of human know-
ledge ; to bridge the gaps of time,
space and language. For lack of
abstracts on Japanese science, Dr.
Anderson-an American who Won
the Nobel Prize in 1937 for work
on cosmic rays-knew nothing of a
valuable article on the subject that
a Dr. Yukawa had published two
years earlier in Japan.
Nearly), 000 organizations
throughout the world produce science
abstracts. Yet of all the scientific
articles appearing each year, fewer
than half are ever abstracted. Howf-
ever, many are condensed over and
over again by different abstracting
services. Of all the sciences, only
chemistry is fully and systematically
covered ; others-meteorology, stat-
istics, fisheries, and important
branches of botany and zoology-are
hardly abstracted at all.
A recent Unesco survey of scien-
tific articles published in the Middle
East revealed dozens of journals un-
known to Western scientists. And
only a lucky accident brought to a
Chinese nutritionist's hand the abstract
of an article from Jamaica on the use
of yeast as a food to curb famine.
To tackle such shortcomings in-the
network of science abstracting,
Unesco held a world conference in
Paris last month. One hundred and
forty-seven scientists and librarians
from 28 countries-speaking) 15
languages-attended. They decided
that world-wide, consulting machinery,
such as exists among abstracting
services in the fields of medicine and
biology, should be set up for the other
sciences, physics and engineering,
chemistry, agriculture.

### 74075: Science liaison spans the world

SCIENCE'LIAISON.
SPANS THE WORLD
IN southern India last October.scientists were examining some
300-year-otd paintings on the
plastered walls of a cave. A bit
of the white plaster had chipped
off. revealing the hard granite wall
underneath. On this rock was
revealed an earlier picture-painted
nearly a thousand years ago. How
to expose it without ruining the
plaster fresco on top ?
The Indian archeologists asked
Unesco's science liaison office for
South Asia to help. This office,
located at Delhi, relayed rhe
problem to Unesco headquarters
in Paris, and also to three other
science liaison offices round the
world-in Shanghai, Cairo and
Montevideo.
A helpful answer came from
the cur a tor of the Vatican
museums. His expert had stripped
some paintings off the Apostolic
Palaces in Rome, and thought the
carves of India might be treated the
same way. He suggested spraying
the outer fresco with chemicals to
make the oil paints insoluble ;
spreading on a thick hard layer of
glue and lint ; stripping off the
plaster, and mounting it on a new
backing. Then dissolve the glue
from in front of the plaster fresco,
and finally, scrape the remains of
plaster off the granite wall to lay
bare the long-hidden picture.
A Mixed bang
L AST year Unesco's four science
offices handled enquiries like
this from 29 countries. They
touched on every subject from the
diseases of camels to higher mathem-
actics, from synthetic gasoline to
cross-breeding of cattle.
Just recently, for instance, the
Middle ! East office at Cairo was
asked to obtain several doses of
anti-snake-bite serum against the
horned viper, cerastes cornutus
- better known as the asp that kil-
led Cleopatra, Queen of'Egypt. A
hospital in Egypt wanted the serum
to protect its laboratory workers
while they milked the vipers of
the i r venom-from which to
manufacture their own serum on a
large scale. Unesco in Paris
appealed for aid to the Pasteur
Institute, wlhidh flew the doses
straight to Cairo as a gift.
MEDICAL SCIENCE
CONGRESSES
ONE of the main achievemenu
(If the Natural Sciences De-
partment in the field of Medical
Sciences in 1949 was the forma-
tion (If the joint WHO-Unesco
Council for the Co-ordination of
International Congresses of Medi-
cal Science. An article about the
significance of this Council, en-
titled"Health Experts Set up
World Medical Council"appeared
in the Supplement to the Unesco
Courier for April 1949 (Volume
11-N 3).
Through Unesco's Far Eastern
Office im Shanghai have come
avocado cuttings from Brazil, sugar
cane samples from the Philippines.
and a set of geology journals from
South Africa, and funds for a
Chinese scientist to attend a tuber-
culosis conference in Paris.
These Unesco science liaison
offices are not merely funnels for
piping technical advice into remote
areas. Instead, they serve as two-
way channels through which China
has sent oil-seed plants to Czecho-
slovakia, wood specimens to Hun-
gary, and silk-worm eggs to Italy.
Transatlantic Data
B rESIDES handling the queries of
Latin American countries, the
Unesco science liaison office in
Montevideo has supplied data
from this area to other parts of the
world. British East Africa is
about to start the large-scale cul-
tivation of sunflowers-a plant
valuable for food and oil. As
enormous tracts of sunflowers are
grown in Uruguay and Argentina.
the East African project asked
Unesco : What part do bees play
in pollinating the sunflower seeds ?
The Latin American office was
able to return a speedy answer-
namely, tlhat Uruguayan and Ar-
gentine farmers find their sun-
flowers do quite nicely with no
help from the bees at all.
C OMETIMES. one country's
problem is another country's
blessing. Indonesia's inland water-
ways were troubled by a fast-
growing plant-a kind of water
hyacinth. This weed choked up
the streams, obstructed navigation
and discouraged the fish. Unes-
co's field liaison office helped the
Indonesians locate a potent weed-
killer. Then a new headache
cropped up : What do to with the
enormous bulk of dead and decay-
ing hyacinth weeds ? Meanwhile
the Unesco office got wind of a
succesful experiment in Western
Bengal. To revive their barren
soil and fight famine, Bengalese
farmers had discovered an excellent
new fertilizer-dead hyacinth
weeds !
Scientists everywhere have
always shared and pooled their
growing knowledge. Unesco's
liaison offices make it easier for
Latin America, the iMiddle East,
South Asia and the Far East to
benefit from scientific progress-
and contribute to it as well.
When the United Nations go to
work on their programme to raise
living standards in under-privileged
countries, the Unesco science out-
posts will serve as ready-made
centres for the increased exchange
of technical knowledge.

### 74077: National Commissions' vital role

NATIONAL COMMISSIONS'VITAL ROLE
ON August 19. 1949, the Govern--
ment of the Grand Duchy of
'Luxembourg informed Un sco
of the publication of a decree provi-
ding for the establishment of a per-
manent National Commission for
Unesco. This brings the total number
of permanent national commissions in
Unesco's forty-eight Memlber States
to thirty-six.
What is the purpose of National
Commissions and why is it important
that they should be established in
all the Member States of Unesco ?
The answer is to be found in the
conviction of the representatives of
the forty-four nations who attended
the Conference in London for the
establishment of Unesco, held in
November, 1945, that Unesco must not
become, an exclusively governmental
organization. They believed that if
Unesco's purpose-to advance
<&lt;through the educational, scientific
and cultural relations of the peoples
of the world, the objectives of interna-
tional peace and of the common
welfare of mankind. is to be fulfilled,
machinery must be provided within
the Member States for associating
their peoples with the work of Unesco.
It was in this spirit that Article VII of
the Constitution was drawn up.
Article VII states :
1. Each Member State shall make
such arrangements as Guit its
particular conditions for the pur-
pose of associating its principal
bodies interested in educational,
scientific and cultural matter3
with the work 01 the Organization,
preferably by the formation of
a National Commission broadly
representative of the Government
and such bodies.
2. National Commission'3 or natio-
nal co-operating bodies, where
they exist, shall act in an
advisory capacity to their respec-
tive delegations to the General
Conference and to their Govern-
ments in matters relating to the
Organization and shall function
as agencies of liaison in all mat-
ters 01 interest to it."
The citizen's voice
NATIONAL Commissions are thus offi-cial bodies estabilshed by govern-
ments and charged with a certain
measure of legal authority and res-
ponsibility. The diversity of cultures
and educational systems, and diffe-
rences in physical and economic
conditions is reflected in the member-
ship, organization, method of appoint-
ment and degree of authority of their
National Commissions. The member-
ship of all National Commissions has
a proportion-great or small-of
official representatives of the Govern-
ment ; the most successful National
Commissions are those where the
voice of the private citizen, represen-
ting the opinion of the organizations
to which he belongs and of the commu-
nity from which he comes, is clearly
and publicly heard.-
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, the Director-
General of Unesco, who was himself
a delegate to the London Conference
in 1945, speaking on 1 April, 1949
at the Second National Conference of
the United States National Commission
Teachers learn about Unesco. Dr. E. Aizona. secretary of the Philippines National
Commission, explains the working of the Organization to teachers at Rita ! City. Repubtic
of the Philippines.
in Cleveland, Ohio. defined a primary
duty of National Commissions as
follows :
. Unesco cannot go ahead without
the support of the great masses
which make up public opinion...
The National Commissions must
clearly understand that one of their
main functions is to bring Unesco
into direct contact with the people.
We, in our work, often need spe-
cialists, technicians and experts ; but
the greatest fruits of our efforts must
be enjoyed by the greatest number.
The man in the street must not
remain unaware that Unesco exists
and is thinking of him. His distress,
his anxieties and his desires are the
best reasons for our existence.
"There should not be a newspaper,
a university, a college, a primary
school or an adult organization that
does not know what Unesco is.
There are thousands of teachers and
writers and millions of men and
women who think as you and I do.
Why not go out to them through the
book or the spoken word, the radio
or the film, the press or television ? >&gt;
The task of the National Commiss-
ions is two-fold-to carry out the
international programme adopted by
the General Conference, composed of
delegates selected by their Govern-
ments after consultation with them.
and to ensure that this international
programme is capable of international
application'by advising their dele-
gates in this sense and by developing
programmes for adoption by the
General Conference which involve
the great masses of the people.
Dr. Milton Eisenhower, the Chair-
man of the United States National
Commission, in his address at Cleve-
land, stressed this urgent need for
developing projects and project mate-
rials to make Unesco a people's
agency for peace. He underlined the
point that while the scholarly approach
to the problems of world peace
through understanding must be conti-
nued and accelerated, the high-level
scholarly attack must be supplemented
by concrete projects in which the
peoples in cities and rural areas
throughout the world, can directly and
immediately participate.
National Commissions, if they are
to carry out their role effectively, must
achieve a form of organization which
permits high-level specialists activity
and also action on practical projects
at the community level. The United
States National Commission of one
hundred members, established in
September. 1946,'has gradually deve-
loped a network of panels of experts
and organizaticns to which programme
responsibility is assigned. In addition
to this vertical decentralization there
is also horizontal decentralization. The
holding of. regional, national and
State conferences has stimulated the
establishment of State and Local
Councils and Commissions of Unesco.
The United States Commission has
thus achieved the greatest degree of
popular participation reached SO far by
any of Unesco's thirty-six National
Commissions. The United Kingdom
Commission, which has a membership
nearly three times that of the United
States Commission, united its nine
separate elements-the United King-dom Committee and eight specia : ist
Co-operating Bodies-for the first time
this year, when they met together at
3elrU (In November, 1948, drew up two
resolutions, later adopted by the
General Conference, calling upon
Member States to assure that their
National Commissions were provided
with funds sufficient to enable them
to establish adequate secretariats, to
organize meetings and to accept
their programme responsibilities.
There is encouraging evidence that
many National Commissions are not
only attempting to carry ont projects
assigned to them in the international
programme, but are also taking the
initiative in establishing local pro-
grammes to further the aims of
Unesco in their countries.
Local programmes
I N Australia, for example, the her., tNational Seminar on Education was
organized in January, ! 949. attended
by forty-four teachers from all States
in Australia. Its purpose was to work
out methods and materials to teach
school children about the United Na-
tions and the Specialized Agencies.
Similar seminars and meetings have
heen held in the Phiiippines and the
United Kingdom. New Zealand also
plans to hold a seminar on this subject.
The Kansas State Commission in the
United States has embarked upon a
"Community Affiliation Programme"
for the exchange of people and cul-
tural materials to develop friendship
between towns in Europe and Kansas.
The Australian and New Zealand
National Commissions have developed
Fellowship Schemes to bring scholars
and students from Asia and the Paci-
fic countries to Australia and New
Zealand tor periods of study and re-
search. Many ccuntries which have
had long established fellowship pro-
arammes have developed new schemes
to assist war-dvastated areas.
The need for close and regular con-
tact between the National Commis-
sions and the Unesco Secretariat in
Church House, Westminster on It
April.
Meeting with its advisers on 17
June, 1949, the Danish Commission deci-
ded to increase its membership from
twelve to twenty-four, and to esta-
blish a small executive committee to
00 responsible for the programme bet-
ween meetings.
Commissions reorganize
IN Brazil, which has a Commission (LB.E. C. C.) of one hundred members
seventeen State Commissions have
been set up so far. A National Confe-
rence of these Commissions was held
in Rio de Janeiro from 24-31 August
1949, to inform the general public
about the aims and activities of
Unesco, and to stimulate popular par-
ticipation.
Other National Commissions reorga-
nised this year, or planning establish-
ment on a more permanent basis,
include the Austrian, Hungarian, Ita-
lian, Turkish and South African Com-
missions. The Indian, Luxembourg and
Swiss. National Commissions have
been established during recent months,
and provisional National Commissions
exist in Afghanistan, Burma, Sweden
and Thailand. In Sweden the'esta-
blishment of a provisional National
Commission of fifteen members has
preceded the formal acceptance of
membership of Unesco. National Com-
missions, like all healthy organizations,
are thus subject to growth and change.
It must be admitted, however, that the
thirty-six commissions listed as estab-
lished in Member States have not
all attained that degree of heolth and
vitality which permits them to play an
effective part in the work of Unesco.
Some, in fact exist only on paper,
and have not been provided with the
means of translating their official de-
crees into action. It was for this rea-
son that the Meeting of Representa-
tives of National Commissions, held at
Pans led the Third Session of the Ge-
neral Conference (Beirut, November-
December, 1948) to recommend that
this Director-General and other senior
members of Unesco should visit Mem-
ber States and National Commissions.
The Conference also called for an
extension of the plan to enable seer..
taries of Commissions to visit Unesco
House in Paris. During the course of
1949, therefore, Dr. Torres Bodet haa
attended meetings of the National
Commissions of France, (22 January
Belgium (21 February), United States
(30 March-2 April), United Kingdom
(11 April), and Denmark (17 June
Dr. Kuo Yu-Shou attended the first
meeting of the Indian National Com-
mission (9-10 April) and that of the
Philippines National Commission (7
June). Two Unesco representatives have
also been sent on liaison missions to
Brazi) and Turkey.
Unesco's U roots"
A T the same time the secretaries of theHungarian, Norwegian, and New
Zealand National Commissions and the
Vice-President of the Colombian Natio-
nal Commission visited Unesco Housr
and representatives of the Indian, Mexi-
can, South African and Swiss Com-
missions will arrive shortly. Other Go-
vernments which have indicated their
acceptance of similar invitations are
the Argentine, Austrian and Polish
Governments. The purpose of these
visits is to enable representatives of
the Commissions to study the work of
the Secretariat and to make personal
contacts with senior members of the
Organization.
Measures such as these will be
developed on an increasing scale for
it is realized that Unesco without Na-
tional Ccmmissions would be, as the
Polish Delegate to the Mexican City
Conference put, it,"like a tree with-
out roots"

UNESCO COURIER
ORGANIZATION OF WORK
OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE
ttt HE Executive Board has allotted two days fordiscussion of the Director-General's report by the
General Conference. A limit of fifteen minutes
is recommended for speeches on the report. This
would allow about forty speakers to take part in the
discussion.
The remaining work of the Fourth Session may be
sub-divided as follows :
PLENARY MEETINGS : These should be concerned
with the organization of the Conference, with the
adoption of decisions regarding Unesco's general
policy (particularly in the discussion of the Director-
General's report and the reports of Member States, and
in the discussion of a general theme) and with the
decisions based on the work of Commissions and the
recommendations of the Executive Board. Provision
has been made for 16 plenary meetings.
COMMISSIONS AND SUB-COMMISSIONS : The
Board has recommended the establishment of three
main commissions on which all member states should
be repre ted : Programme and Budget Commission
(with 1 eduled meetings). Administrative Commis-
sion (wi eight meetings), and Official and External
Relations ommission (with seven meetings).

mitten. and General Committee.
THE fourth session of Unesco's GeneralConference opens at the Organiza-
tion's headquarters in Paris on Sep-
tember 9th and is scheduled to last until
October 5 the
The Conference, which is the supreme
ruling body of Unesco, will, thi$ year, chiefly
be concerned with the administrative aspects
of the programme rather than with the formu-
lation of new ideas and fresh projects. A
number of new schemes will, however, be
presented to the delegates. The decision to
give the meeting this character was taken at
last year's session in Beirut, Lebanon, when the
delegates approved a long-term work plan for
the organization, which wi'll not require re-exa-
mination o. ditions every year.
It is expected that some three hundred de-
legates will attend the Conference for which
Ínvitations have been sent to the 48 member
states of Unesco, to the members of the United
Nations and of the Specialized Agencies which
are not members of Unesco as well as to the
U. N., the Specialized Agencies, international
and national organizations.
Among the main questions on the agenda
are an Extraordinary Programme and Budget
Estimates for technical assistance to under-
developed countries, a draft code of policies
and modifications to Unesco's ordinary pro-
gramme, and a public discussion on the cultu-
ral duties of the State.
The Conference will also discuss the
Director-General's on Unesco's activi-,, 1949 and the Budget for the next
cial year as well as electing six new mem-
bers to the Executive Board.
Technical A. id Programme
UNESCO'S plan for an extended program-me of technical assistance to under-
developed areas is outlined in a special
report by the Director General. In it he says
that the object of Unesco in entering into the
United Nations plan will be to furnish to eco-
nomically under-developed countries, terri-
tories or areas, at their request, such advice,
technical skull, training facilities, study groups.
pilot projects and other help, as may fall
within Unesco's sphere.
The plan of the Secretary General of the
United Nations, says the report, is one for
Technical Assistance for Economic Develop-
ment. Economic development is, therefore,
the end. and technical assistance the means.
The proposals laid by Unesco before the
Conference are only concerned with these
means. Such assistance, at the present time and
in the light of the relevant resolutions, does
not imply direct financial assistance. The
scheme envisages financing by means of volun-
tary contributions by donor Governments.
(For more details see page 3.)
Cede of foHcies and Budget
They define the chief aims and general policy
to be followed in planning and implementing
the programme of the Organization.
In addition, certain amendments to the
ordinary programme will be submitted to the
Conference for approval. They are either
deletions of resolutions. on which action will
be completed in) 949 or changes in programme
emphasis or orientation which experience has
shown to be expedient for the better imple-
mentation of Unesco's programme.-
The 1950 Budget which the-Director- Ge-
neral is submitting to the Conference totals
$8, 8_47, 000, being an increase of $1, 067, 000
over last year's budget. The budget increase
relates soiely to programme activities and, in
consequence, there is an appreciable reduction
in the proportion of administrative expenses.
General Debate
A GENERAL debate on what every nationcan and should do to ensure a better
understanding between peoples will take
place during the Conference, and the final
details will be worked out by the General
Committee.
The theme chosen is"What are the duties
of the State in regard to education, science
and culture for'the purpose of ensuring a bet-
ter understanding between peoples, and what
practical steps should be taken in order to
discharge these duties ?"
The debate will be held in a large Parisian
hall, La Maison de La Chimi-e, and the three
evenings of September 27. 28 and 29 have
been set aside for it so that Conference dele-
gates, intellectual groups, student organiza-
tions and the general public may hear distin-
guished speakers discuss the subject. The
names of the speakers have not yet been an-
nounced. The discussions wiH be broadcast
by the Radiodiffusion Francaise and interna-
tional radio hookups will make the program-
mes available to listeners in other parts of the
world.
This Supplement includes summaries of two
separate reports by the Dir (ctor-Geæral on the
work of Unesco in connection with Interna-
tional U/iorq C (JJmps and Children's Communi-
ties, from their inception to the present time.
It also deals with Unesco's practical efforts to
facilitate the free movement of educational,
scientific and cultural material and the inner-
national circulation of publications.
THE major original feature of the new pro-gramme of U esco is the inclusion of a
code of eighteen directives designed to
lay down the principles governing the organi-
zation's practical activities (See page 16,)
These directives were amended and approved
by the Executive Board at its June session.
A REMINDER

### 74079: Germany and Japan

UNESCO COURIER
GERMANY
A MEETING OF THE UNESCO ASSOCIATION WITH JAPANESE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND FOREIGN
AFFA ! RS. iN TOKYO. A JAPANESE PUBLICATION G ! VtNG UNESCO WORLD NEWS'.-
SINCE Jhe beginning. of 1949 Unesco
has been going steadily ahead with the
work of extending certain of its pro-
gramme activities to Germany and Japan,
within the limits indicated by the
General Conference at Beirut,) last Decem-
ber.
Based on the results of surveys and expe-
riments carried out during 1948, the confe-
rence decisions enabled Unesco to put into
action those projects which appeared to be
most suitable for the two countries.
The first task was to establish effective and
regular working relations with the Allied
authorities and interested individuals and
groups in both countries. For this purpose,
three offices, which are also to act as Unesco
Information Offices, were opened at Mainz,
Stuttgart and Düsseldorf in the Western Zone
of Germany, under the direction of Dr.
J. W. R. Thompson.
Unesco's work is, in fact, still confined to
Western Germany despite attempts, made as
long ago as 1947 and again in 1948, to
obtain authorization for its extension to the
Eastern Zone. On June 29, 1949, however,
M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco, made a new request for this autho-
rization in a letter he addressed to the Mili-
tary Governor of the U. S. S. R. Zone of Oc-
cupation.
As one of the first steps in its 1949 pro-
gramme for Germany, Unesco undertook the
wide distribution of its publications and
documents in order to make its aims and
achievements known to German individuals,
cultural groups, libraries, universities, news-
papers, educational and cultural journals.
Exchange of publications
THE programme already carried out hasalso included assistance in exchanging
publications between German institutions
and those of Unesco Member States, a
study of text books in connection with the
project for the world-wide revision of text
books and teaching materials, the translation
into German of several Unesco publica-
tions, the invitation of German specialists to
conferences called by Unesco and a survey
of the opportunities which exist for the ex-
change of persons between Germany and
other countries.
In May, a committee of experts set up by
M. Torres Bodet, to advise him on questions
concerning present and future Unesco acti-
vities in Germany, held its first meeting in
Paris.
After reviewing the work already carried
out, this committee formulated a series of
recommendations for future Unesco action in
Germany, calling for Unesco fellowship
opportunities for Germans to study abroad,
the extension of Unesco's Book Coupon
Scheme to Germany, participation of Ger-
man scholars and teachers in text book revi-
sion programmes and the active participa-
tion of German individuals and institutions
in Unesco's work in their country. These
recommendations for the expansion of
Unesco's programme in Germany during
1950 were submitted to Unesco's Executive
Board last June.
The experts committee held a second
meeting at the end of August and made sup-
plementary recommendations which will be
considered in the formulation of a pro-
gramme for Unesco's activities in Germany
during 1950. The final decision on this pyro.
gramme will rest with Unesco's General
Conference which opens in Paris on Septem-
ber 19.
In the case of Unesco's work in Japan,
responsibility for providing liaison with the
occupation authorities and implementing
the General Conference resolutions was
entrusted to Professor Lee Shi-Mou, who
arrived in Japan last April.
Unesco in Japan
UNESCO'S aims and activities in Japanare similar to those for Germany and in
the development of the work Unesco has had
full support from the allied authorities and
from Japanese organizations.
One of these, the National Association of
Student Clubs for Unesco, has a membership
of about 10. 000 and the other, the Federa-
tion of Co-operative Associations of Unesco,
whose membership numbers about 200. 000,
has active committees established in most
important centres.
On the initiative and at the expense of
the allied authorities, the appropriate Japa-
nese Ministries and private organizations,
some twenty Unesco publications have al-
ready been printed in English and Japanese.
In addition, a large number of tracts pro-
duced in Japan to publicize Unesco have
been issued in Japanese and widely cir-
culated.
Unesco is therefore already well-known in
Japan and. the Japanese official agencies.
particularly the Ministry of Education, are
keenly interested in its work. In 1948. for
example. the Ministry of Education set aside
30. 000 yen for work associated with Unesco
and in 1949. this was increased to 6. 000. 000
yen, or approximately $12. 000.
and
JAPAN
On May 19th, a fresh impetus was given
to Unesco's work in Japan by the holding of
the first National Conference on Unesco
which was attended by 2, 000 delegates.
As in the case of Germany, a Committee
of Experts was set up to advise M. Torres
Bodet on the execution of the programme
approved by the General Conference for
Japan. This committee met in Tokyo last
May and again last month and its recommen-
dations will be given full consideration in the
development of Unesco's programme in Ja-
pan in 1950.
An indication of the extent to which
Unesco hopes to step-up its work in both
countries during 1950 is shown by the bud-
getary estimates to cover the proposed acti-
vities, which are to be submitted to the Ge-
neral Conference. These represent an
increase of some $60, 000 over those of
1949.
BEFORE the opening of theConference, the Execu-
tive Board will meet on"Sep-
tember 15th to discuss a num-
ber of points for presentation
to the delegates, among them
the Director General's annual
report, proposed Unesco acti-
vities in Germany and Japon
and the plan of technical as-
sistance.
Towards the end of she
Conference, the delegates tâll
have to elect four a term of
three years six new members
of she Board in place or those
whose term of office u'ill then
be at an end. The latter are :
Dr Parra Perez (venezuela),
M. Roger Seydoux (France),
Professor Paulo Carneiro
(Brazt), f. R. Guntekin
(Turkey), Professor Alf Som-
merfelt (Norway), and Pro-
fessor R. Stoddard (U. S. A.).
These members are, however,
re-eligible.
I t must be noted that mem-
bers of the Executive Board
of Unesco do not sit as repre-
sentatives of their countries
but are selected for their
competence in fields of inter-
est to Unesco, and care is
always taken to see that the
chief cultural areas of the
world are represented among
them.
Finally, the delegates uill
have to decide on the venue
of the next session of the Con-
ference. In future this u ; ill be
held in the spring of each
year, at the request of the
United Nations, in order to
avoid overlapping the meet-
ing of the U. N. General
Assembly.

### 74078: The Fourth session of the General Conference of UNESCO will be held in Paris 19th September - 4th October 1949

### 74081: UNESCO Director-General presents budget estimates: million dollar increase requested

UNESCO DIRECTOR-GENERAL
presents budget estimates :
million dollar increase
requested
D IRECTCR-GENERAL Jaime Tor-
res BOOet's Budget Estimates for
Unesco's work in 1950, totalling
8, 847, 000, have been transmitted
to the Organization's 48 Member
States. They will be officially placed
before the Fourth Session of Unesco's
General Conference, which opens in
Paris on September 19,
The Estimates, representing an in-
crease of about one million dollars
over the 1949 financial period, are de-
signed to cover all phases of Unesco's
co-ordinated effort to organize inter-
national intellectual co-operation on
behalf of peace and culture. They
therefore provide for such varied pro-
jects as-to mention only a few-
the cperation of scientific liaison cen-
tr on four continents, a world clear-
ing-house for information on educa-
tional practices and materials,.. fun-
damental"education on an experi-
mental basis in Haiti, the promotion
of adequate translations of Great
Books, the establishment of an Inter-
national Music Council, and the dis-
tribution of a free cultural"feature"
service for newspapers throughout the
world.
In the words of Sir Sarvepalli Rad-
hakrishnan of India who, as chair-
man of Unesco's Executive Board, will
officially present the Director-Gene-
ral's Budget Estimates to the General
conference,"the funds proposed in
this document remain at a moderate
scale in re'ation to the world's needs
in education, science and culture".
This disproportion between needs
and resources is underscored by the
Director-General himself, in his Intro-
duction to the present volume of esti-
mates. Admitting that the peoples of
the world expect from Unesco results
which it cannot honestly hope to
achrwe with the limited resources at
its disposal, Dr. Torres Bodet points
out that a major contribution, in his
view, far more important than finan-
cial contributions, is hoped for from
National Commissions and Co-opera-
ting Bodies.
"They can and must make such
contributions when they have achieved
a degree of effectiveness which, it must
b admitted, has not yet been attained
by all. Nevertheless, the work of the
Secretariat which I do not regard in
any way as separate and independent,
is essential, and it too requires to be
strengthened and extended".
This strengthening of the Secreta-
riat, as proposed by Dr. Torres Bodet.
cannot be viewed as a mere matter of
adding personnel to the staff at
Unesco's Paris headquarters. Unesco's
position at the heart of a world-wide
movement of cultural co-operation
allows expers in the Secretariat to act
as'levers, displacing much greater
weights than their own.
"By their very nature", says the Di-
rector-General,"the progress of (our)
activities does not involve proportio-
nate increases in equipment and staff.
We make no land purchases for the
building of schools ; w are not buil-
ders of University Cities, nor publishers
either of school books or encyclopae-
dias. The best services we can render
take the form of investigations, mis-
s : ons, information, advice and SUgg2S-
tions, and these are all services re-
quiring qualified staff".
It is in this spirit that Dr. Torres
Bodet explains the increase of
gl, 057, 000 which the proposed 1950
Budget shows over that of 1949. The
largest increase in 1950 is in the ap-
propriations asked for under the
chapter of Education. Citing a typical
example, the Director-General says :
"It has been proved that educational
missions can render great services to
the Member States, but only on condi-
t : on that they are endowed with ade-
quate staff... The mere presence in
a Member State of one or more techni-
cians, who can carefully study the
conclusions reached by a mission, may
suffice to convert work half done into
a successful achievement". And, spea-
king of Fundamental Education, Dr.
Torres Bodet again draws attention to
the fact that the requested appropria-
tions will serve primarily to set in mo-
tion a multiplying process throughout
the world.
"In the present disorganized state of
fundamental education the world over,
one of the most useful steps which
Unesco can take is to create a centre
of training and production which can
provide students and specialists with
intensive and speedier training, while
at the same time ensuring the output
of teaching material. If I am propo-
sing by way of experiment to establish
such a centre in one area only-to be
selected by the Conference-it is be-
cause I am sure that success in this en-
terprise will lead in the next few years
to the establishment of similar centres
in other areas".
Answering anticipated objections to
the effect that the increased Budget
for 1950 might delay the accession to
Unesco of States not yet members. Dr.
Torres Bodet points out that he is
anxious to avoid anything which might
adversely affect the Organization's
universal nature. And here he makes
an observation which gives life to
what might otherwise have been a vo-
lume of lifeless figures :-
"Perhaps", writes the Director-Gene-
ra !, the extent of the financial contri-
bution asked for does not explain why
certain States have not yet ratified our
Constitution. What will militate in
Unesco's favour will be the services it
is in a position to render, and it is to
secure better results that I ask f01
increased resources. For Unesco's pro-
gramme to achieve sigirifiance in the
eYEs of the world, it must ba more
than a promise".
There follows a summary of the Di-
rector-General's statement on other
programme activities :
RECONSTRUCTION.
m PART from its emergency reliefprogram es, the most useful help
that Unesco can give to Recon-
struction is in encouraging campaigns
for collecting money. The appropria-
tions of the Reconstruction Depart-
ment have, therefore, been increased
to allow it to take a still larger share
in the campaigns to be launched in
North America.
EDUCATION.
EDUCATIONAL seminars, the Direc-tor-General states, have proved
themselves one of the best ways
of getting the latest techniques known
and applied over large areas of the
world. In order, however, to bear its
full fruit, a seminar must be looked
upon as an opportunity for producing
good teaching material. For that,
experience has shown, seminars must
be furnished with more teaching and
administrative personnel and the work
they do must be carried farther in the
countries which are represented at
them. If Unesco contemplates a long-
term programme of seminars, these
measures are the indispensable mini-
mum.
Further. Unesco has had to increase
its share in the pilot project in Haiti.
to undertake new preliminary surveys
in certain specified areas and to.
develop the already important public-
tions programme of the Fundamental
Education Clearing House. The grea-
ter part, however, of the new appro-
priations asked for under Fundamental
Education are intended for a specia-
lists'training centre and for the pro-
duction of fundamental education ma-
terial.
NATURAL SCIENCES.
As regards the Natural Sciencesprogr mmes, regular work co ti-
nues. In order to prepare for the
establishment of an International In-
statute of the Arid Zones. Unesco must
have sufficient funds to cover meetings
of experts and studies which are ne-
cessary for the completion of this pre-
liminary phase.
Unesco must also have funds for the
task. undertaken jointly with the
World Health Organization, of crea-
ting a Council of Medical Sciences, to
ensure the success of the International
A GROWING COMPANY Name plates of Member States being checked for use at
the General Conference.
Union for the Protection of Nature,
sponsored by Unesco, and to help the
first International Congress of Mathe-
maticians to be organized since the
war.
After an impartial examination of
the work and role of field science co-
operation offices, it has become appa-
rent that their staffs should be in-
creased by recruiting eminent scientists
from the regions concerned to carry
out liaison work with the local scien-
tific institutions and associations.
SOCIAL SCIENCES.
REQUESTS for funds for 1950 forthe Social Sciences also show a
marked increase. The reason for
this is that certain projects already
begun, which are of considerable
importance to Unesco's programme,
must be completed. If funds were not
available there would be detrimental
delay in the application of the pro-
gramme, and part of the ground gained
in preceding years would be lost.
It is Unesco's duty to show its inte-
rest in a whole series of activities of
urgent importance to the construction
of the defences of peace in the minds
of men. Thus, Unesco contributes
decisively towards the formation of as-
sociations in the field of social scien-
ces. It is obvious that Unesco must
support these groups which are further
new instruments of international col-
laboration and which ensure for too
Organization the effective and conti-
nuing assistance of specialists in such
branches as sociology, comparative
law, political economy and social psy-
chology.
By organizing meetings and initia-
ting studies, surveys and observation
missions, Unesco also encourages social
science specialists to take an interest
in the machinery of international ac-
tion and to study means whereby its
operation can be perfected.
CULTURAL ACTfVtTES.
THE budget of Cultural Activitiesalso reflects the proposed work in
hand. In the field 01 Arts, pro-
gress in carrying out the programme
has resulted in the signing of a
contract with the International
Council of Music, which will undertake
important work on behalf of the Orga-
nization, and in the proposed creation
of a Fine Arts Review. In the field
of libraries, in view of the extension Df
the Libraries programme, it is felt that
the Organization should provide for a
study course and a pilot project in
1950.
EXCHANGE OF PERSONS.
THE Director-General's report onthe budget also underlines the
success of Unesco's Exchange of
Persons programme. But much still
remains to be done to ensure that Go-
vernments, in preparing their fellow-
ship programmes, take into account
similar programmes in other countries.
In this connection, Unesco must
confine its attention to centralizing
and disseminating information.
Further, it is essential that Unesco
should co-operate with the Internatio-
nal Labour Organization in giving
further attention to workers'education
and the exchange of workers for edu-
cational purposes. Additional appro-
priations are needed for these two ac-
tivities.
The Director-General also expresses
his conviction that it is necessary not
only to increase the number of Unesco
fellowships, but to see that they make
a definite contribution to the fulfil-
ment of the Organization's programme.
TECHNICAL NEEDS.
FOR several years Unesco has car-ried out surveys of technical needs
in radio, press and film, and has
thus built a large volume of documen-
tary material which, as 1949 draws to
a close, will cover a considerable area
of the world.
It is therefore natural that in 1950
the Organization should adopt for
technical needs a policy which has
already proved successful in education,
namely, the sending of missions. Two
missions will be organized in 1950, one
for school broadcasts and the other for
educational films. In addition, a re-
gional seminar on school broadcasts
will provide an opportunity for those
countries in need of assistance and
advice, to make contact with others,
which have already made considerable
progress in this field.
UAISON WITH MEMBER STATES.
ALTHOUGH. on the whole, thefunds required are not very sub-
stantial, there is ample evidence
of the Secretariat's efforts to stimulate
and direct the work of Member States,
National Commissions and co-opera-
ting bodies towards the implementa-
tion of the Unesco programme.
The programme for the development
of National Commissions, however.
calls for measures other than the ex-
change of administrative correspon-
dence. The report outlines the extra
funds necessary for the activities of
the Bureau of External Relations,
whose services have to be extended, for
Unesco's Liaison Office in New York
and for a better presentation and a
wider dissemination of Unesco do-
cuments and publications.
EXECUTIVE BOARD'S COMMENT.
IN its report to the General Confe-rence on the Director-General's
draft budget for 1950, the Executive
Board states its conviction that the
funds asked for remain at a moderate
scale in relation to the world's needs
in education, science and culture, and
believes the Conference should adopt
it.
The Board notes that the increase
in the budget is allocated almost enti-
rely to programme items, while the
sums allocated to the units underta-
king the central direction and admi-
nistratjon of Unesco remain essen-
tially the same and, in proportion
to the total budget, they are reduced.
Finally, the Executive Board recalls
its previously expressed view that the
programme should not be basically
changed at the forthcoming confe-
rence and expresses the hope that the
Conference will concur in this view
and that it will not increase the num-
ber of activities of the Organization
beyond those presented to the Confe-
rence.

### 74084: Some of UNESCO's achievements during 1949

In his first annual Report to
the General Conference of Cones-
eo, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet, Di-
rector-General outlines his t1) own
policy and the acts pities of the
Organization since the beginning
of 1949.
* *
THE REPORT
IN the opening words of his Report, the Di-rector-G eral draws attention t  the excep-
tional difficulties encountered during the
period under review.
"By advancing its next Session to the ninth
month of the year", he writes,"the General
Conference imposed on the Secretariat, and
indeed on the whole Organization, a particu-
larly exacting timetable. In order to allow
sufficient time for the documents to be comple-
ted and despatched to Member States, the
Committees of the Executive Board had before
them, in the second half of May, the various
questions to he submitted to the General Confe-
rence, and the draft Budget for 1950.
"This preparation four the following year
absorbed a considerable prop, ortion 01'the time
and energy of the higher ranks of the Secretariat
at a moment when the}) should have lcn devo-
ting themselves wholl}) to the execution of the
Programme. The work was also undertaken
much too early or it to be based on adequate
experience derived from the ca1i. Ying out of the
CiJlrrent programme."
The change in the Director-Generalship, Dr.
Torres Bodet notes, could not fail to affect the
FAITH IN
normal development of the Secretariat's work,
in spite of his efforts to avoid any break in
continuity. It was to avoid excessive distur-
bance of the existing machinery, which would
have had disastrous consquences at a time when
work was so heavy, that he decided not to
embark this year on a radical revision of the
structure of the Secretariat.
Apart from the severe time limit imposed
upon it, the Organization found itself faced
early thins year with an additional task of the
first importance which had not been contempla-
ted by the General Conference at its Third
Session. This was Unesco's participation in
the Plan of Technical Assistance for economi-
cally under-developed countries which resulted
from the Economic and Social Council's Reso-
lution of March 4. The new proposals involved
not only the holding of an extranrdinary session
of the Executive Board (March 24-25) but
also the despatch to Lake Success of two senior
officials-Dr. Beby, Assistant Director-
General in charge of Education, and M. Auger,
Head of the Natural Sciences Department-
who were absent from their normal duties for
six weks. Meanwhile the D'rector-General,
with the help of a group of five members of the
Executive Board, began to lay the foundations
of Unesco's contribution to the Plan.
"This question", writes Dr. Torres Bodet,
"will, in fact, be one of those to which we
have had to pay most attention. It has
also materially altered the nature of the
Fourth Session of the General Conference,
which was to have been a"short business
session". Discussion of the Technical
Assistance Plan has involved an extension
of the Session by three days, and decisions
on the subject will be of greatest impor-
tance in connexion not only with that ques-
tion itself but with the development of our
cooperation with the United Nations and
other Specialized Agencies".
A Two-Year Programme
IT was clear to the Director-General and toi the Executive Board that a"short business
session"of the General Conference could not
undertake any radica ! revision of the programme
adopted at Beirut, and the addition of Tech-
nical Assistance to the agenda of the Confe-
fence did not inva. lidate this conclusion. This
meant that the-scheme adopted at Beirut must
be regarded as a two-year programme-a
circumstance that offered a welcome opportunity
to bring about greater concentration in the work
of Unesco.
Accordingly, the Director-General selected
from the'"very large and widely ranging"two-
years programme a number of permanent activi-
ties or fixed projects which would have a prior
claim this year. It was not intended to reduce
the programm decided on by the General
Conference, but to establish an order of urgency
in the matter of its execution. The various
projects were therefore divided into three
classes :
(1) Projects involving a special effort in
1949 ;
(2) Projects on which normal work shnuld
be carried out in 1949 ;
(3) Projects whose execution could be de-
ferred until 1950.
In adopting'this classification the Director-
General had the following criteria in mind :
(a) Practical value as regards raising the
standard of living of the ordinary people ;

"Surprise may be expressed", he writes,
"that these criteria do not include peace
or international understanding. It goes
without saying, however, that all Unesco'5
activities are directed towards peace and
international understanding. The ques-
tion to decide is what of project contri-
butes most to that end. It seems to me
that the best type is that which does some-
thing for man rather than merely discussing
him...,

I
The rescources of Unesco will be
devoted, on the one hand, to the
maintenance of approved con-
tinuing services, and, on the
other hand, to the execution of a
limited number of special projects
determined by the General Confer-
ence fron* time to time. Aii these
activities should form a coherent
whole and relate to matters of evi-
dent importance and usefulness.
2
In all spheres of common interest,
Unesco will co-operate closely with
the United Nations and its Specia-
lized Agencies.
3
Unesco will seek to associate at
closely as possible In the execution
of its programme those internatio-
nal governmental and non-govern-
mental organizations pursuing, In
specialized fields, ends similar or
related to its own.
4
Unesco will, If necessary, assist In
the establishment, the development
and the co-ordination of internatio-
nal organizations, whose aims and
activities are In conformity with
its own.
5
Unesco will seek to utilize, through
the National Commissions of Mem-
ber States, the services of the na-
tional organizations and institutions
concerned with education, science,
culture and mass communications,
In order to associate such bodies
and institutions In the general task
of international co-operation.
6
In Education, Unesco will act as a
centre for the exchange and disse-
mlnatlon of ideas and practices, In
order to encourage the growth of
effective systems of education,
seeking especially to bring people
to understand one another, to train
good citizens and to give every per-
son, rich or poor, in town or coun-
try, without distinction of colour,
race, sex or creed, the opportunity
for an education which best assures
him the possibility to develop his
personality and carry out his social
responsabifities.
7
As a contribution to Intellectual
progress and to the improvement of
the living conditions of mankind,
Unesco will encourage international
enterprises which seek to increase
and disseminate scientific know-
ledge.
S.
Unesco will seek to Improve and
make better known the methods
and findings of the Social sciences ;
and, in particular, their possible
contrlbution to the development of
international co-operation and un-
derstanding.
9
Unesco will encourage intellectual
and artistic exchanges between peo-
ples, to develop, in mutual respect

the Secretariat's work. he notes, has been a
considerable increase in the number of Unesco
publications. The number of works and pam-
phlets issued during the first half of 1949 was
47. as compared with 48 for the whole of the
previnus year and 46 for 1947. Some of
them were published in several languages other
than the working languages. As for periodi-
cals, which amounted to seven in 1947 and
nine in 1948. these have now reached the num-
ber of fourteen.
In a section devoted to the distribution of the
Budget and the proportion of administrative to
executive personnel, the Director-General makes
it clear that although the total Budget shows a
smaH increase over that of the previous year,
the purely administrative expenditure proposed
for 1950 represents only 10. 5 per cent of the
whole draft Budget, as compared with 12. 3 per
cent in 1949. At the same time, the propor-
tion of purely administrative staff to total staff,
which was 27. 1 per cent in 1949. is only 25
per cent under his proposals for 950."I am
for their several cultures, the
consciousness of human solidarity.
10
To assist people to develop greater
understanding of other nations
through personal contacts, Unesco
will encourage projects which pro-
mote travel abroad for purposes of
study, research and teaching.
81
Unesco will encourage the spread
of information among peoples by
seeking to facilitate, increase and
improve their mutual knowledge
through Euch methods as the press,
radio, the film and television. The
Organization will urge those In
charge of these media of informa-
tion to assist In promoting interna-
tional understanding and social pro-
gress.
12
Unesoo, taking into consideration
primarily the needs of the war-de-
vastated countries, will broaden
progressivety, within the limits of
its resources, into a more general
activity for the raising of standards
in education, science and cultures,
the energies now devoted to recon-
struction.
13
The educational scientific and cul-
tural needs of economically under-
developed countries will receive in-
creasing attention from Unesco,
which will continue to respeot the
individuality of their cultures.
14
Unesco will direct constant atten-
tion to the problems within its com-
petence arising in Trust and Non-
Self-Governing territories, with
due regard for the needs and tradi-
tions of their populations and in co-
operation with the local authorities,
through the States responsible for
the administration of such territo-
ries.
15
Unesco will take special measures
to associate young people as far as
possible, both in the execution of
its programme and in making wide-
ly known the principles upon which
it is based. For this reason Unesco
will in particular seek the co-opera-
tion of teachers and others active in
directing youth movements.
16
Unesco will maintain liaison with
international non-governmentai la-
bour organizations, in order to en-
courage them to take an active part
In the execution of the programme
of Unesco.
17
Unesco will seek to make better
known the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, to win consent for
the principles it enshrines and to
assist In bringing about the educa-
tional, scientific and cultural condi-
tions which the fuller realization of
those principles requires.
18
In all Its activities, Unesco's prime
concern will be to serve the cause
of peace to which it is dedicated.
The World Outside
TURNING from the internal organization ofUnesco t  its relatio s with the world
outside, the Director-General insists on
the importance of close and active cooperation
with the Governments of Member States and
with all the other organizations, both official
and unofficial, which are animated by the same
ideals as Unesco and are striving to. achieve
comparable aims. He writes :
'The n'or/f of the Secretariat represents
only one part of the Organization's activities,
and, moreover, that wode cannot and must not
be conceived as an ind1ependent activit)). The
real influence of the Organization's activities is
in fact attributable less to its oWn resour, ces than
to its abilit)) to coordinate the energies of the
world in carr)) ing out its purposes."
From this point of view, the Director-General
considers that Unesco's overall success depends
on a four-fold system of contacts linking the
Secretariat with the machinery on which its effi-
ciency depends. These are its contacts with :
(1) the Governments of Member States ;
(2) National Commissions :
(3) the United Nations and the Specialized
Age, ncies ;
(4) international non-governmental organiza-
tions.
Part III of the Report (Official and Exter-
nal Relations) gives a detailed account of re-
cent developments on these lines, including
the accession to Unesco membership, since the
last session of the General Conference, of four
new States-Thailand, Switzerland, Burma
and the Principality of Monaco. All of these
States have completed the formalities necessary
for their membership to become effective, and
several others have announced their intention of
becoming members.
National Delegates in Paris
A LIST of the Member States which haveddegations in Paris, tog ther with th
names of their chief delegates and their
deputies, on Juiy),) 949. is given in the Report
(Part III, page 3). The Director-General
expresses his appreciation of the help given by
the national delegates to Unesco in its work, but
in the preamble to his Report he notes that
cooperation between Unesco and the Govern-
ments of Member States needs to be strengthe-
ned :
In the case of the National Commissions,
also, the Director-General has to report that
"there is a time-lag in the development of these
essential bodies in comparison with the Secreta-
riat. This is a situation which I can most
readily understand but, unless it is corrected, it
will endanger the balance of the Organization
and jeopardize both the efficiency and the uni-
versal significance of our work".
The Machine and the Multitude
A CONSTANT preoccupation runs like a Lett-motiv through the Report : the Director-
General's sense of the social and popular
value of Unesco's work. He shows an anxious
desire to avoid building an administrative wall
between the machine and the multitude. Thus,
in the whole Report he announces only three new
appointments by name, and all of them contri-
bute to this end. They are those of Mr. Dou-
glas Schneider (U. S. A.) to be Head of the
Department of Mass Communications, Mr. A.
Ramos (Brazil) to be Head of the Department
of Natural Sciences, and Mr. Carlo a Prato
(Italy) to be Head of the Department of Public
Information.
We may be allowed to conclude with a quo-
tation from the Director-General's report on the
work of this last Department, to which the
Courier belongs :
"The Bureau of Public Formation,
which is responsible for informing the pu-
blic about Unesco's aims and work, has
continued to improve its machinery...
Besides the Press and the tireless, the Bu-
reau has its own special organs. First and
foremost we must mention the Courier,
which aims at giving a full and vivid pic-
ture of our activities every month...
"with the limited means at its disposal,
which if endeavours to utilize more effectively
by improving its contacts and adapting what it
produces to the needs of the p. ublic, the Bureau
of Public Information is helping to introduce
Unesco to pe () ple who have hitherto been in-
adequately ; nformed about it. Until last April
there was no official Head of the Bureau. The
appointment of M. Carlo a Prato should lead
to fresh progress on both the productive and the
publicity side of the wor/e."

### 74085: Free movement of persons and educational, scientific and cultural material

### 74086: International work camps

UNESCO COURIER
FREE MOVEMENT Of PERSONS AND OF
EDMATMNAt SHENHEK AND (DlrDRAl MATERIAl
UNESCO has drawn the atten-
tion of its Member States to
a recommendation passed by
the3 General Conference in
Beirut that they examine
existing national regulations and
practices governing the importation
and purchase of educational, scienti-
fic and cultural materials, in order to
introduce or extend especially favou-
rable treatment to such material. A
memorandum was alfo sent on Eco-
nomic Obstacles and Privileges per-
taining to [he free flow of educational,
scientific and cultural materials, defin-
ing in general terms the obstacles
under examination.
The suggestion was also made by
Unesco that Member States should
examine certain regulations and prac-
tices insofar as they affect the impor-
tation and purchase of such mate-
rials. They are : foreign exchange
coatrols ; customs duties ; quafltltative
restrictions ; sales taxes and similar
internal taxes ; and export regulations.
At the same time, Unesco put for-
ward suggestions for remedial action.
Unesco Schemes.
UNESCO has also embarked on a
number of schemes designed to
reduce Or eliminate certain eco-
nomic obstacles to the free flow of
educational, scientific and cultural
materials, and in the light of the
surveys undertaken, a plan of work
for consideration by the Conference
has been worked out. This plan
derives from the efforts of Unesco in
two directions :
(A)-to reduce tariff barriers
applying to educational, scientific and
cultural materials by seeking the
assistance and advice of the Third
Session of the Contracting Parties to
the G neral Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) Conference ;
(B)-to lessen the effect of foreign
exchange difficulties by formulating,
in collaboration with the Economic
Commission for Europe, a scheme for
meeting the requirements of European
countries through the conclusion of
trade agreements on such materials.
Unesco took the opportunity of the
: neeting at Annecy, France, of the
Third Session of the GATT to obtain
consideration of measures to reduce
these obstacles. The Director-Gen-
eral submitted to the Conference a
memorandum on trade barriers
affecting the import and export of
educational, scientific and cultural
materials, together with a list of items
falling in these categories. He ask-
ed GATT to include there items in
its negotiations and take into account
the desirability of achieving a maxi-
mum of international trade in mch
products. He also submitted for
study the text of the Draft Agreement
to facilitate the international circu-
lation of books, newspapers and perio-
dicals which Unesco prepared, and
sought the advice of the Conference
on it. Finally, he requested GATT to
advise Unesco on the additional prac-
tical measures it might take to im-
plement its mandate to reduce trade
obstacles affecting the flow of edu-
cational and scientific items.
The Annecy Conference agreed to
discuss these proposals and established
a working party to examine the mo't
practical means of studying and for-
mulating solutions of the questions
raised by Unesco.
In response to Unesco's request.
special attention was also given to the
reduction of customs duties through
bilateral negotiations on certain cate-
gories of educational material, and
the Conference put it on record that,
in future tariff negotiations, Govern-
ments would, as far as possible, try
to assist in furthering the objectives
sought by Unesco.
The Working Party on Unesco un-
dertook a careful examination of the
questions raised by the Director-Gen-
eral and concluded that a most
effective method for Unesco to ac-
complish its objectives in this field
would be to sponsor an international
agreement to consolidate and expand
the favourable treatment at present
accorded to educational and scienti-
fic materials in many countries. The
Party then drafted the tentative text
or an Agreement on the Importation
of Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Materials which has been transmitted
to Unesco and is being submitted to
the General Conference for discussion.
E. C. E. Help.
AT the same time, Unesco has
endeavoured to lessen those
obstacles to the free circulation
of educational and scientific materials
which derive from currency and quota
restrictions. Thus, Unesco and the
Economic Commission for Europe have
consulted together on plans to meet
the requirements of'European coun-
tries in such materials. A working
arrangement was reached between
the two Secretariats on the course of
action to be followed.
Under this plan, Unesco will submit
to the E. C. E. a list of scientific
material and apparatus, as well as
materials for elementary education
which are required in many European
countries. The E. C. E. will send this
list to its member-states and discuss
it privately with trade representatives
in order to bring together potential
importing and Exporting countries.
As [Oon as a willingness to buy in one
country is matched against a willing-
ness to sell in another, the E. C. E. will
bring the parties together and
facilitate agreement.
The first list will be limited to
items of importance to scientific and
elementary education. If it elicits a
favourable response, Unesco will stub-
mit further lists on items such as
press, film and radio equipment, tech-
nical literature, etc. which will be
dealt with in a similar way by the
E. C. E.
In the light of experience gained,
it is proposed to extend the same
working relationship as exists with
the E. C. E. to the Economic Commis-
sion for Latin America and to the
Economic Commission for Asia and
the Far East.
Movement of Persons.
THE problem of the obstacles im-
peding the free movement of
persons between nations has
been examined by Unesco, and parti-
cular consideration given to the work
done on this subject by the Economic
and Social Council of the United
Nations and its Commission on
Transport and Communications.
The conclusion reached by the Se-
cretary-General of the U. N., as a
result of the above-mentioned work
was that it was advisable to keep the
matter under review for a longer
period before recommending that any
further steps be taken on the interna-
tional level. This seems to indicate,
therefore, that for the time being no
substantial change in the general
: situation can be expected, at least
insofar as these formalities apply to
people wishing to travel irrespective
of identity of profession.
From the point of view of Unesco,
however, it is desirable to distinguish
certain categories of individuals tra-
velling for educational, scientific and
cultural purposes who, through their
professional status or purpose of tra-
vel, might benefit from a minimum
of special treatment in passport and
other formalities. Unesco, therefore,
considers that member-states might
give special facilities with regard to
visa and frontier formalities to per-
sons or groups travelling for educat-
ional, scientific or cultural purposes.
Member-states might also support any
measure : : aiming at facilitating tra-
vel for educational or scientific pur-
poses when the question of movement
of persons comes up again before the
Transport and Communications Com-
mission.
Financial Obstacles.
PASSPORT and. frontier formali-
tiec, however. are not the only
or necessarily the most i por-
tant barriers to the movement of per-
sons for Euch purposes as unèSco
stands for. Under existing condition,
the financial problem is the most
serious obstacle. Although this diffi-
culty would be lessened by a general
improvement in the international
currency situation, Unesco feels that
attempts might be made within each
interested country to increase the
amount of currency allocation gran-
ted to persons traveliing for educatio-
nal, scientific Or cultural ends.
These difficulties could a'so be alle-
viated by an increase in tiie number
of fellowships or other grants to fuch
persons from abroad and buy a more
universal effort towards providing
special reductions in transport costs.
Furthermore, host countries might
consider the possibility of making
generous fellowship grants to foreign
students and scholars, in order that
their foreign currency resources might
be supplemented.
These are the problems which the
delegates to Unesco's General Confe-
rence have to discuss with regard to
the free movement between nations of
persons and of educational, scientific
and cultural materials.
FROM its inception, Unesco
has recognized the part that
International work camps
could play in reconstruction
and in education for internatio-
nal understanding. In the
summer of 1947. it undertook a
restricted project, in cooperation
with four camps organized by
various associations in Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, France and Po-
land. Unesco representatives
visited the camps, worked and
lived with the volunteers for a
few days, and participated in the
educational activities of the
camps.
Basing themselves upon their
observations, the Unesco repre-
sentatives considered that if the
educational opportunities offered
by the camps were fully utlllsed,
the camps might become centres
for spreading the ideals and
principles which inspire Unesco's
work. The visits also enabled
Unesco representatives to observe
at close quarters the difficulties
and problems with which the
organizers were confronted, and
as a result of these observations
to develop an expanded pro-
gramme for Unesco activity in
this field.
Coordiøatioø
Coølereøce.
To enable them to consult
together, to exchange ideas
and experiences, and thereby
render their scattered efforts
more effective, Unesco, In April
1948, called a Conference of Camp
Organizers and of associations
which provide the camps with
valunteers. Nineteen organiza-
tions were represented. They dis-
cussed the technical and educat-
ional problems connected with
the organization of camps and
considered how problems might
be solved through inter-organiz-
ational co-operation government
support and Unesco's assistance.
As their continuing agency,
they created the Coordination
Committee for International
18
AT ITS LAST SESSION, THE GENERAL CONFERENCE ASKED THE DIRECTOR-
G, ENERAL TO PREPARE DETAILED REPORTS ON VARIOUS ITEMS IN THE UNESCO
PROGRAMME.
FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF HIS REPORT ON THE HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL WORK CAMPS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES.
Work Camps which has a small
working body, but also invites
representatives of all work camp
organization to attend its
meetings and participate in its
work. Unesco provides its secre-
tariat. The Committee, which
meets about once a month, faci-
litates the exchange and dissemi-
nation of useful technical infor-
mation and arranges for joint
publicity. Each meeting Is a
forum where all members help
to solve the difficulties which
may confront any one of them,
such as the recruitment and
exchanges of volunteers, visa and
travel problems, etc. It aLso pro-
vides Unesco with a valuable
means of obtaining the advice
and assistance of the work camp
associations in regard to all its
activities in this need.
When the Second Conference
of Organizing Associations met at
Unesco House in March 1949, their
number had increased to 27, aid
the interest in these conferences
is witnessed by the fact that,
although Unesco did not pay the
delegates'travel expenses. 22 of
the 45 attending delegates came
to Paris from Austria, Czecho-
slovakia, Denmark, Holland, Ru-
mania, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom. They re-
presented international and nat-
ional organizations with widely
differing aims and ideologies.
This conference formulated
specific requests for Unesco assis-
tance. Having experienced the
value of the past year's internat-
ional cooperation, It recommend-
ed that cooperation should also
be established on the nationallev l between the organizations
concerned with international
work camps and between these
organizations and the national
commissions for Unesco. The
delegates further agreed to the
principle of organizing in the
summer of 1950 a large work
project in which all associations
should participate and asslgned
the study of this plan to a
special committee.
Tupes of Camps.
THERE are two distinctly
different types of camps : the
A smaller on s with twenty to
fifty volunteers, which generally
undertake short range repair or
construction projects, and the
btgger camps with thousands of
participants, generally operated
in the Eastern European
countries, which engage in the
building of railways, canals, etc.
and organize their volunteers In
national brigades of varying
numbers.
A total number of 135 Internal-
tional camps were organized In
the Summer of M48 In 23
countries with an estimated
population of fifty thousand
volunteers. In the summer of
1949, according to the plans
announced 141 camps were organ-
Ized in nineteen countries, with
work projects to include road
building and repair, flood control
and reforestation ; agricultural
work ; medical, social and edu-
cational work ; building and
repairing schools, hospitals.
churches and homes ; building
and repairing playgrounds, youth
centres and youth hostels.
It appears from these figures
that there has been no increase
In the total number of camps
over 1948, but It should be
pointed out that the affiliated
agencies of th3 world Federation
cf Democratic Youth in the
Eastern countries of Europe
concentrated their efforts this
summer on the great Youth
Rally in Hungary, and that for
that reason they have announced
that only one symbolic internal-
ional camp will be organized in
these countries. The actual in-
crease in the number of camps
in all other countries is over fifty
percent.
Unesco's Assistance.
UNESCO maintains conti-
nuous contact with the
sponsoring organizations
and renders assistance and advice
In regard to general and specific
problems.
During the months preceding
she camp season, Unesco is
visited dully by a number of
young people anxious to obtain
Information on how they may
participate In a work camp.
Similar requests for Information
are received by mall from indi-
visuals, organizations, schools
and universities. Unesco has,
therefore, gradually assumed thy
responsibility of assembling and
diffusing data on the overall work
camp programme.
In order to meet what was
considered an existing need.
Unesco has also undertaken to
participate In the educational
activities of a certain number of
camps by the loan of Unesco
camp libraries, assistance in
procuring information on the
countries in which the camps are
located and visits of Unesco re-
presentatives to the camps.
Rapid Growth.
IN 1948, thirty libraries were
procured and distributed to
camps in"leven w -devasta-
ted countries. Embassies and Le-
gations in Paris contributed docu-
mentary material on their
countries. Each library contained
three hundred titles in English,
French and German. During the
winter months, these libraries
have, as far as possible, been
u ! lis<&gt;d in youth centres, stu-
dents'clubs or schools.
To create and stimulate interest
in the work camp movement and
thereby enlist the aid of official
authorities, the general public
and prospective volunteers, Unes-
co has undertaken, with the help
of organizing bodies, to publicize
their activities.
Intere3t in the work of camp
movements is growing rapidly.
Everywhere new groups are
being formed and plans made to
enlist, through the camps, the
cooperation of youth in the
constructive development of the
different countries.
However, in spite of the
increase In the number of spon-
soring organizations and camps,
there are never enough to absorb
the would-be campers and in
most countries more than hajf of
those who want to devote their
holidays to this voluntary work
have to be turned away. Many
problems combine to hinder the
free development of the move-
ment : difficulties in finding suit-
able projects ; difficulties In
procuring tools and equipment,
In obtaining visas and travel
facilities ; present currency res-
trictions and short holiday
periods which limit participation
in work camps. Certain govern-
ments are already taking steps
to remedy some of these diffi-
cutie3.

INTE, RNATION AL
CIRCULATION
OF PUBLICATIO, NS
FREE exchange of ideas and
knowledge between peoples is
on of the main conditions of
intellectual progress and under-
standing and, consequently, of the
establishment of world peace. It is,
therefore, a matter of primary impor-
tance to facilitate thy free circulation
of publications, since, of all media for
the interchange of ideas, the printed
word in all its forms commends itself
by reason of its long-established
use and is still-as regards both
duration and accuracy of expression,
one of the most effective instruments
of intetlsctua ! intercourse and mass
education.
The draft agreement on the inter-
national circulation of publications.
therefore, provides that contracting
parties undertake not to institute or
maintain any limitation on the entry
into their territory of publications.
Under various articles, the agree-
ment takes into account the legislation
particular to individual states but
provides for the arbitration of Unesco
and the International Trade Organ-
ization should the restrictions imposed
by one of the contracting states give
rise to representations from another
contracting state.
VISUAL AND AUDITORY
MATERIALS
THE draft agreement to facilitate
the international circulation of
visual and auditory materials
of an educational, scientific and cul-
tural nature was submitted by Unesco
to member states for signature but
has so far been signed by no member.
This agreement is designed to
remove all customs duties and quanti-
tative rstrictions on the importation of
This provides for the abolition of all
customs duties on publications coming
from another contracting party and
includes the waiving of all costs, taxes,
charges or dues which are not levied
to the same extent on publications of
national origin. It does not, how-
ever, entail the abolition of taxes,
costs, charges or dues relating to the
importation of any articles whatsoever,
including articles imported duty-fre :.
and in particular of statistics and
stamp duties.
The agreement further provides
that no quantitative restrictions would
be imposed by the contracting states
whose legislation does not establish an
exchang control system, and makes
provision for laws and regulations in
force in these states.
The-publications concerned include
all which are of an educational,
scientific and cultural character, and
many others intended for public li-
braries and collections, for the libra-
ries and collections of public educa-
tional, research or cultural institutions,
and private institutions of the same
character. The agreement also covers
publications intended for bureaux or
centres for the exchange and distribu-
tion of publications, official govern-
ment documents, publications of the
U. N. and its Specialized Agencies,
material distributed by Unesco and
reading matter in raised characters for
the blind. Finally, publications in-
tended to promote tourism (on condi-
tion that they are published or spon-
sored by an official tourist organization
and addressed to it by a similar natio-
nal organization for free distribution
and that they contain no private com-
mercial advertising matter) also come

films and other auditory and visual
materials which have been certified to
be of such a character. Including
filmstrips and microfilms, sound record-
ings of all types and forms, glass
didres, charts, maps and posters.
In all cases, the primary purpose
of this material must be to instruct or
inform or to maintain, increase or
diffus knowledge, and augment inter-
national understanding and goodwiH.
To obtain the exemption provided
under the agreement, the materials
concerned must be accompanied by a
certificate that such material is of an
educational, scientific or cultural cha-
racter. The certificates can be issued
by the appropriate governmental
agency of the State wherein the ma-
terial originated or by Unesco.,
The agreement also provides that
the contracting states undertake jointly
to consider means of reducing to a
minimum the restrictions that are not
removed by the agreement and which
might interfere with the international
circulation of educational and scientific
material.
All disputes arising out of the inter-
pretation or application of the
agreement can be referred to the In-
ternational Court of Justice or to an
arbitral tribunal unless it is agreed to
have recourse to another mode of
settlement.
G. A. T. T. TEXT
WHILE Unesco was preparing
the agreement on the importa-
tion of books newspapers and
periodicals, certain parallel develop-
ments took place which are being
brought to the attention of the General
Conference.
AT its session last year, The General Conference of Unesco asked the
Diredor General to prepare a draft agreement on the importation of
book :, newspapers and periodicals. This text was prepared by the.
Secretariat in consultation with the legal Department of the United Nations
and will be presented to the General Conference's current session before
submission to governments for sgnature.
This draft agreement is a sequel to a similar draft accord for facilitat : ng
the international circulation of visual and auditory materials of an educational.
scientific and cultural nature which was approved by the General Conference
last year and has since been submitted to member states for signature.
These two agreements are designed to promote the free flow of ideas by
word and image and to encourage the understanding of peoples in confor-
mity with the alms of Unesco.
The Contracting Parties to tIre
General Agre ment on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) which held their
third session at Annecy, France, dur-
ing the spring, received from the
Director-General of Unesco a « Me-
morandum on Trade Barriers affect-
ing the Import and Export of Educa-
tonal. Scientific and Cultural Mate-
rials. >&gt; (See also page 7.)
After carefully examining the me-
thods of reducing trade barriers to the
international circulation of such ma-
terials, a special Working Party con-
cluded that a most effective method
for Unesco to accomplish its objective
in this field would be to sponsor an
international agreement, consolidating
and extending the favourable trade
treatment at present accorded to this
kind of materials in many countries.
The Working Party then proceeded
to draft the tentative text of an
Agreement on the Importation of
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Materials, covering the following ca-
tegories : (a) books and publications ;
. (b) DJod (s of art and other objects of
'an educational, scientific and cuJtural
character ; (c) visual and auditory
materials of an educational, sc : en-tific
and cultural character.
This draft text is also being sub-
mitted to the General Conference for
discussion. But in a report, the Se-
cretan ? at of Unesco points out that the
text prepared by GATT makes pro-
vision for the materials covered by the
two draft agreements mentioned above
as well as for certain other materials
under the cat°_gory of works of art.
It will therefore, be up to the General
Conference to decide whether to act
on separate agreements or on one
broad agreement to facilitate the
international circulation of a wide
variety of educational, !, scientific and
cultural materials.
UNESCO'S CONTRIBUTION TO
L) BRAR) ES RECONSTRUCDON
AND DEVELOPMENT
IN the original conception of the Unesco Clearing House for Publi-
cation, no provision had been made for the operational distribution
of books by Unesco. In many instances, the Clearing House was,
however, obliged to accept actual book gifts for distribution to libraries
throughout the world, because the donor was unable or unwilling to
do more besides actually donating the books. This was for instance
the case last year when the French Government offered 25, 000 volumes

therlands have announoed their part-
cipation.
Egypt has Joined the Scheme both
as book-buyer and book-supplier, and
wi) i receive immediately a first alto-
cation of book coupons worth
$15, 000. As the agenoy responsible
for the sale of ooupons In Egypt, the
Egyptian Government has designated
the Administration of Qenerai Cutture
of the Ministry of Education at Cairo.
All Egyptian booksellers can now
accept book ooupons In payment fo
tnelr publications.
The Netherlands have Joined the
Scheme as book-suppliers only. The
Stiohting Qransch Export Centrum,
N. Z. Voorburgwal 5S-60, Amsterdam-
C., has been appointed as centralizing
agenoy, to which anyone wishing to
buy books, published In the Nether-
land, with Unesoo book coupons,
should send his order.
NINE COUNTRIES NOW INCLUOED
THESE two latest additions bringi the totai number of countries
benefiting from Unesco's Book Cou-
pon Scheme to nine, namely : Czecho-
slovakia, Egypt, France, Hungary,
India and the United Kingdom (all
book-buyers and book-suppliers) ; the
Netherlands, Switzerland, and the
United States of America (book-sup-
ptiersoniy).
Another important development has
been announced by Unesco. The
validity of book coupons already in
circulation, which originally had to
be liquidated within a ten-months'
experimental period, has now been
extended untie the end of 1950. Yet
In Czechoslovakia, a very active mem-
ber of the Book Coupon Scheme since
its inception, the first allocations of
sale-and gift-coupons, totalling
$27, 000, have already been exhausted,
and the central Czechoslovak distri-
buting agency has applied for another
$20, 000-worth of coupons for sale to
libraries and institutions. Other
countries are expected to present si-
milar requests at any moment.

### NON-ARTICLE-TEXT

UNESCO COURIER
CONSIDERING that Children's
Communities represented one
of its most significant and im-
portant new ventures, the Secretariat
of Unesco convened an international
conference at Trogen (Switzerland) in
July of last year. The purpose of
this meeting was to provide an oppor-
tunity for a free discussion and
exchange of views on the problems of
war-handicapped children. Thirty-five
experts and directors of children's
communities from twelve coantries as
well as observers from the Interna-
tional Bureau of Education and the
International Children's Emergency
Fund attended.
One of the greatest difficulties, the
experts found, which children's commu-
nities encounter in carrying out their
work is that of obtaining the necessary
equipment and of securing funds and
practical help in the form of goods or
voluntary services. As their educa-
tional methods are generally very
different from the traditional methods,
they receive little or no help from public
authorities and derive their resources
almost entirely from private gifts.
The provision of the help needed to
restore, maintain and establish commu-
nities appeared, at this Conference, to
be one of the most urgent and useful
tasks.
As a result of the Conference, an
International Federation of Children's
Communities (I. F. C. C.) was esta-
blished with its headquarters at
Trogen. The aim of this organization
is to trace children's communities
throughout the world, to promote the
exchange of children and teachers
between the different communities, to
coordinate research and to disseminate
information. The Secretariat of
Unesco has given the Federation its
support and has financed four meetings
of the Executive Committee.
Either directly or through National
Commissions, Unesco has encouraged
the establishment of national associa-
tions of children's communities, and
the appointment of national correspon-
dents of the I. F. C. C.
Unesoo's surveys
UNESCO is in touch with overone hundred children's commu-
nities in Germany, Belgium
France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the
Netherlands and Switzerland. It has
received full reports on the aims, orga-
nization and educational methods of
each centre, often accompanied by
photographs, drawings, statistics and
other material.
The needs of children's communities
have been systematically studied by
Unesco and are outiined in general
lists of needs common to all children's
communities and lists of needs of each
individual case, having regard to the
location, special nature of the com-
munity and the type of child for which
it is intended (mentally defective, demi-
cate, difficult children, etc.)
These lists have been published in
English, French and Spanish in
Unesco's periodicals ; they have been
distributed among organizations in
donor countries and to all the people
concerned. Unesco has endeavoured
to put each community in touch
with organizations or people who
may be able to help it. It has thus
increased the number of international
bonds which help to establish better
understanding.
Appeals for war-handicapped
children have also been launched suc-
voluntary organizations concerned to
the desirability of their assisting such
an undertaking.
Model Newspaper
S ECONDL Y, an international seminarways organized for men and
women teachers who wished to
improve their professionnal training
and to give their colleagues in other
countries the benefit of their knowledge.
The Seminar, which lasted a fortnight
was held at the lie de France Commu-
nity School last July.
At the last session of the Executive
Committee of the I. F. C. C., held at
Unesco House in June, a dummy
model of an international newspaper,
prepared by a specialist, was submitted
to the members of the Executive
Committee who decided to circulate it
to all the children's communities
concerned with the idea of producing
an international newspaper which they
would all help to edit. This ljnk
between the different communities
should help to bring about improved
international understanding.
At the same session, a member of
the Executive Committee, M. Richard,
was instructed to prepare a scheme for
setting up a"Unesco House"at
Trogen. Such an international centre
would be designed to make it possible
for children from different communities
and teachers serving in those commun-
ities to meet together for a period of
three to six months. Visitors to the
centre would thus have an opportunity
of practical experience of international
understanding. It would also make it
possible to provide a more thorough
vocational guidance service for the
children on an international scale.
cessfully in the press, by radio and by
means of exhibitions. All the necess-
ary steps have been taken to enable
donors to transmit gifts of money in
cooperation with the I. F. C. C., the
French National Associations of Chil-
dren's Communities (F. N. A. C. C.)
and the national correspondents.
Last month, Unesco helped in the
organization of an International Chil-
dren's Camp at the « Children's Re-
public» at Moulin-Vieux near La-
valdens, (Isere), France. The camp
contained about fifty boys and girls
between the ages of 12 and 17,
chosen from among war victims in
children's communities. The camp
programme included periods of physical
culture, a study of the folklore of
various countries, talks on current pro-
blems and excursions into the surround-
ing country. The children took a
share in organizing and running the
camp. They thus had an opportunity
for persona ! experience of internationa)
cooperation and took back the benefits
of it to their own communities.
As the resources of children's
communities are generally scanty, the
cost of the material organization of the
camp, which amounts to about
three million francs (approximately
$ 11. 000) was covered largely by
public subscription. As the result of
the appeal to French educational
authorities in primary, secondary and
technical schools, launched in the first
week of June under the auspices of
the French National Commission for
Unesco, in order to obtain a donation
of one franc from each pupil, over
half the sum had already been handed
to the treasurer of the F. N. A. C. C. by
the end of June. Furthermore.
Unesco drew the attention of the

### 74090: A Colonial Arts Council?

### 74091: India's health is her job

A COLONIAL
ARTS COUNCIL ?
t MONG the most sfriking"'alll
festations of the « Colonia !
Month>&gt; which ha  recently co-
me to an end were the exhibitions
of primitive art from the colonies-
in point of fact, mostly from negro
West Africa. When 1 was in Africa
in 1944, I was deeply impressed by
the range and variety of its tradition-
al art, and above all by the vigour
and high quality ; and these exhibi-
tions revived those impressions with
renewed force.
West Africa gives us the bronzes
and terracottas of Ife, whose classical
style, unique in black Africa, poses
fascinating historical questions, the
subject of correspondence in preced-
ing issues of the <&lt;Sunday Times>&gt;.
It gives us the delightful gold weights
of Ashanti ; the rich costumes of hun-
dreds of native rituals ; the bronzes
of Benin in which barbarism touches
the heights of splendour ; wood-car-
vings with the natural strength and
sense d form after which modern
Western sculpture is striving ; masks
in endless variety, some of what we
are accustomed to think of as pure
negro type, others recalling the style
of the Far East, others reminiscent

The The tragic thing. however, is that
in West Africa, as almost everywhere
else, this primitive art is rapidly dis-
appearing. The objects themselves
are disappearing, through neglect, or,
in the case of masks and wood sculp-
tures, through being eaten by ten.
mites ; the traditional skills of the
carver and the weaver are dying out ;
the old religions rituals are ceasing
to be practised as the old structure Of
African society crumbles before the
impact of our Western civilization-
or rather of the disruptive economy
cal and technological forces which
emanate from it, for the civilization
itself has not taken root in negro
Africa.
The colonial Powers, it seems to mr.
have a serious responsibility in this
matter. To begin with, they should
be much more active than they arc
in collecting and preserving all they
can of the traditional arts of the pri-
mitive peoples under their charge, and
publishing accounts of them.
But even if all art specimens of
all the colonies were properly housed
and preserved and published, primi-
tive art itself might well disappear ;
that would be Hke what has happened
with the Dodo and the Great Auk.
If something is not done, primitive
peoples all over the world run the
risk of becoming debased into a new
kind of proletariat-a geographical
appendage to the central core of in-
dustrial civilization. They will lose
an important means of self-expres-
medieval dignify, animal-masks with
astonishingly effective simplification ;
figures with an Etruscan look, a Me-
lanesian look, a look as of ancient
Mexico.
Art and Life
T HERE are even new and unfami-liar art-forms : as post-Renais-
sance Europe invented the headless
and limb'less torso, so Southern Ni-
geria. invented the armless figure-
and made an aesthetic success OIl it.
Anather thing was brought home
to me in West Africa. The art of the
region was not just a collection of
museum p'eces or objects for exhi-
bition in a gallery ; it was related to
Me. The Ash, anti gold weights were
used in the business of weighing gold.
The masks and costumes were used in
tribal and secret society ceremonials ;
they both canalised and expressed
powerful emotions. I myself saw one
ritual in which an astonishing figure,
completely concealed in a cylindrical
<&lt;dress>&gt; and surmounted by a head-
dress covered with woedcarvings,
seemed to express the very spirit of
life in the equatorial forest, from
which it impressively emerged ; and I
was shown photographs of ceremonies
in which the dancer and costumes
conspired to give an overpowering ex-
pression to the strange overtones and
mysterious depths of savage life.
Change and Decay
T 0 say that West African art isprimitive does not. of course,
mean that it is crude art or poor art :
primitive art is a descriptive term
meaning the traditional art of peoples
who have not been industrialised and
indeed have not reached the technical
levels of organization that the socio-
logists call civilization. Furthermore,
its tradition is not necessarily forma-
lized ; up till quite recently, much of
the West African art has been deve-
loping and changing with a remarkabte
degree of vitality and variety of ex-
pression.
sicn, an essential outlet, both for their
individual selves and for their group
consciousness and their national pride.
It is obviously nO good trying just
to preserved the arts in their tradi-
tional form when the social and reli-
gious basis far them has disappeared.
That would be to turn them into
living fossils, mere museum pieces
without relevance to the life around
them. Somehow the tradition must
be developed and adapted to the new
conditions. The peoples must be proud
of their traditions and past achieve.
ments, but their arts must be adapted
so that they have significance for the
present. The individual artist and
craftsman must : be able to live by his
art ; and the group must become. aware
of fhe social value of the arts for its
OW1I1 evolution.
Adjustment
IT is not true to say that traditionalart is inevitably doomed to extinc-
tion. Here and there it has been de-
literately given a new lease of life.
While travelling on behalf of Unesco,
I found that in Peru, for instance,
and Guatemala, and among some
North American Indians, the old tra-
ditions have been more or less success-
fully adapted to prosper in the mo-
deln wcrld ; and in West Africa itself
traditional music is being adapted and
used as a means of providing expres-
sion to the new society that is taking
the place of tribalism.
But in general, all too little is being
done or even attempted. The Western
world seems blinded to everything that
is not quantitative. The volume of
exports and imports ; the proportion
of children attending school ; the mum"
ber of hospitals ; the size of the popu-
lation ; these are the priorities. The
arts are treated as the Cinderellas
of Education Departments, or tidily
preserved (after killing) in museums.
We have set up an Arts Council
in Britain, and it has done a great
deal to make the arts come alive in
the life of this country. But there
are more people in the Colonies than
in Britain, and their arts are in gra-
ver danger than ours are or ever were.
Why not an Art Council for and in
the colonies ?

RA]KUMARI AMRIT KAUR,
INDIA'S HEALTH
IS S H E R JOB
by Daniel BEHRMAN
FOR fifteen years, an Indian princess
worked side by side with Mahatma
Gandhi in his patient struggle to
create a nation for over 300 million
people. As the secretary to Bapu--which
means Father-Rajkumar ! Amrit Kaur
even went to jail in support of the Ma-
hatma's beliefs. the day after an assays
sin's bullet ended Gandhi's life in Janua, y
1948, she said to a grieving nation :
« (May God have me, cy on us and give
us the strength to be true to Bapu and. thus build up the India of his dreams. >&gt;
It is this faith which she brings to her
present task as India's Minister of Health,
one of the most difficult jobs facing any
woman or man in the world. It was the
some faith which transformed her into one
of Gandhi's hardest-working followers.
For Rajkumari-meaning ( (princess>&gt; in
Hindustani-Amrit Kaur was born into
a princely family, educated in England
and France and brought up as a Chris-
tian.
As Gandhi's secretary, she religiously
followed the simple, ascetic life he laid
down. Even today, the Rajkumari still
wears a robe of khadi, or homespun, and
she is a strict vegetarian in her diet. She
has an excellent radio voice and she com-
bines Gandhi's idealism with a modern
outlook on her work.
This pleasant, sincere woman-who
looks much younger than her 60 years-
became India's minister of health in 1947
at a time when the new country was being
torn by rioting and upset by iarge-scaie re-
fugee migrations.
The difficulties before Rajkumari Amrit
Kaur are quite in keeping with the vast
size and population of India. Smallpox,
for example, is under control in large
parts of the world, but in India. there
is a constant fear that it can become an
epidemic at any time. The average life
expectancy of man in Western nations is
about 60 years ; in India it is only 27.
Much of the population lives in rural vil-
lages and must be educated in the use
of proper sanitary methods before'it can
be told to practise them.
A Million Nurses Needed
RAJKUMARI Amrit Kaur is well awareof the fact that all cannot be reme-
died overnight. The Bhore Committee
report, made several years ago, estimated
that the nation needs a million nurses to
give its population adequate protection.
It is hoped this goal will be reached in
30 years, but today there are less than
15, 000 nurses for India's 300 million, The
Rajkumari is attacking this problem, is
well as others, with patience and a belief
that whatever is done must be done well.
She already has been instrumental in sett-
ing up the first Nursing Council in India
and she has sponsored legislation raising
the pay level of nurses. last year. when
many nation ! contributed gifts ofpeni-
cillin, atabrine and other badiy-needed
drugs to Indian, she personally supervised
their distribution.
Her eventual aim is what she once
called ! ied « an adequate, efficient health ser-
vice for every man, woman and child
whether they can afford to pay for such
a service or not.)) Between the India
of 1949 and this ideal stand tremendous
obstacles such as bad housing, overcrowd-
ing, poor water supply, insufficent food
and not enough trained medical person-
nel. To all of this, the Rajkumari has ans-
wered : « Every little step forward means
a great deal. I believe that if anyone
wants anything badly enough, he gene-
rally works for it and is therefore able
in the end. to get it.))
Besides her duties as health minister,
this frail little woman also takes part in
such activities as the Indian Red Cross
and various delegations to Unesco's ge-
neral conference. It all is part of an
extremely busy rife.
« A cabinet minister's lot is a hard one)),
she said recently. There are endless in-
terviews, some very interesting, some ex-
tremely boring ; endless good deeds to be
done like the distribution of prizes at
functions ; the inauguration of something
or other, the laying of a foundation stone
somewhere or other and so on. When
I look at my programme at the beginning
of each day, I wonder how I am ever
going to get through it. And yet the
days fly by and so much is there to do
and think and discuss and write that one
has not time even to feel tired.))
She believes in direct methods to get
things done rather than the delicate pro-
cesses of protocol and formality. She
feels that a woman is much less patient
with governmental red tape than a man.
Recently, the ever-active Rajkumari attend-
ed the World Health Assembly at Rome
on behalf of her government. She took
with her this same capacity for hard work
and devotion to her job.
Not long ago, she told a radio audience
in India :
« ! t is a tremendous thing to have
attained our political independence. It
is an even bigger thing to be alive and
working one's hardest so that we may
make of India a country which will help
lead this troubled world into the paths of
peace. >&gt;

### 74093: The Viani Associated Project

### 74092: Education: UNESCO's programme

UNESCO PROGRAMME
U T NESCO'S education programme
i. based on the assumptioa
that und rstanding between
peoples-and, consequently, lasting
peace and security-are possible
only when two educational conditions
are met : every country must have a
system of universal education adapt-
ed to its cultural and economic needs ;
and there must be an organized de-
sire within each country to use edu-
cation to increase international un-
derstanding. Without this. desire a
well-organized education system can
be used to promote war as readily as
peace. On the other hand, no go-
vernments. though it have the best will
in the world, can do much to develop
internaUonar un-
derstanding in an
illiterate popula-
tion, or in one
which, through
lack of technical
skills, lives at an
economic level
far below that of
the countries to-
wards which it is
supposed to feel
understanding
and goodwill. An
empty stomach is a bad basis for hu-
man understanding.
If this point 01 view be accepted, it
goes far towards meeting the fears 01
those who feel that Unesco. in its ef-
forts to help countries to raise the
level of their general education sys-
tems. may be in danger of wandering
too far from its primary and avowed
purpose 01 contributing to peace and
security. Seminars on illiteracy, con-
ferences on university and adult edu-
cation, and missions on primary, se-
condary and technical schooling be-
come as essential to the programme as
the analysis of textbooks and the writ-
ing of pamphlets about world under-
standing.
This is not to say that Unesco's at-
titude should be exactly the same to-
wards both types of activity. It may
be assumed that most countries have
a desire, often an intense desire, to
raise the 1eve of their general1 edu-
cation and to extend its benefits to a
greater proportion 01 the population.
There is, in addition, a great deal of
the necessary technical knowledge
already scattered through the Member
States, although it is very unevenly
distributed. Unesco's main contribu-
tion is to develop services for assis-
ting the exchange of educational ideas,
practices and materials in such a way
that every country will be able to
take advantage of the experience of
the others in creating a system of
universal education suited to its needs
and to the capacities 01 its individual
citizens. This is the conception 01 an
educational clearing house or « ex-
change market", under which Unes-
co's own special responsability is to
develop killa in-brokerage techni-
ques".
FOR INTERNATIONAL
UNDERSTANDING
IN the field of education for interna-tional understanding, however,
Unesco must be prepared to take more
direct responsibility. Unfortunately.
the desire to use education delibera-
tely for this purpose is not as wide-
spread as is the wish to use it for more
obvious domestic or national purpo-
ses. This is entirely understandable.
The concept of education for interna-
tional understanding is a complex
<me, and it is. at
the present stage,
not to be expec-
ted that there will
be the same po-
pular clamour for
it as there is, for
example, for tech-
nical education.
There is, moreo-
ver, a sad lacy
01 the materials
and skills neces-
sary for this re-
'lativclly novel task. Even amongst
those who are most anxiou. s to de-
velop education for international un-
derstanding. there is no small diffe-
rence 01 opinion as to whether the at-
tack should be primarily by direct or
by indirect methods, and as to the
effect that such education can have on
the trend of world events in the im-
mediate future.
All this throws on to Unesco a bur-
den 01 responsibility that it should
have no wish to avoid. It cannot, 01
course, take sides on the question 01
"direct"or"indirect)) education for in-
ternational understanding : and must,
to the limits 01 its powers, help all
countries to develop such education in
the ways they think best. But it
cannot afford to be neutral on the
ends to be achieved : it must keep
before the countries 01 the world the
idea that, today, education 01 all
kinds and at all levels should have
as one 01 it3 functions, the develop-
ment 01 us, derstanding between peo-
ples. The <&lt;clearing house>&gt; concept
01 Unesco's functions is not, 01 itself,
adequate to meet the situation, and
the Organization must be prepared,
in the sphere 01 education for inter-
national understanding, to take the
initiative more frequently and more
strongly than in any other part 01 its
educational programme.
The notes on the education pro-
gramme to be found in this issue will
give some idea 01 how this policy has
been carried out in practice over re-
cent months. In the programme pro-
posed for 1950 it can be seen even
more clearly that Unesco's interest in
international understanding will strong-
ly influence most 01 its educational
activities.
GROWTH AND DIVERSITY OF
UNESCO'S PATTERN OF tN-
TERNATtONAL EDUCAT ! ONAL
SEMINARS
IIN the three years during which Unesco's Education Depart-
ment has undertaken the organization or sponsorship of
In emaiionalEduc tional Seminars on"Worksho", seven- such gatherings will have taken place. The locations are as
varied as the topics and the participation, for, by thel end of 1949,
France, Great Britain, U. s. A., Czechoslovakia, Honduras, : Brazil and
India will each have had their turn as host country. For 1950.
Seminars are scheduled to take place in Belgium and Canada, and
there is in existence a suggested pattern of Seminars, extending up
to 1953, for which locations have as yet to be selected.
Topics studied in Seminars have been related either to the
schooling process as it affects children, adolescents and their
teachers, or, as in the case of Seminars sponsored or assisted by
Unesco in Caracas, Brazil and India, on the great problems of
popular mass education.
For 1950 Unesco's main effort will go into preparing Seminars
'on''The Teaching of G-->graphy as a Means of Developing
International Understanding"and"The Improvement of Text-
books, particularly history books".
An interesting feature of the draft programme scheduled for
1951, 1952 and 1953 is that former Unesco Seminar participants,
who act as Unesco ambassadors of goodwill'on their return to their
various countries, have suggested many of the proposed discussion
topics. This liaison and fallow-up is a most valuable part of the
Seminar work.
Ploughing on a 55-degree Slope at Viani,
THE V ! AN)
ASSOCIATED PROJECT
VI, ANI, in Colombia, is typical of
the communities to be found in
the Andes mount ins. Covering
about j, 500 hectares, it is located in the
upper limits of the coffee belt at an
elevation of 1, 6oo metres. On its steep
and rugge. d landscape the slopes average
between 35 and 50 degrees and reach
down to deep narrow valleys where level
areas large enough to allow the building
of a normal-house are difficu'tt to find.
There are no roads in Viani except
the main street that, goes through the
village, and the 6, 000 inhabitants of the
community have to use an intricate
network of trails up and down the slopes
to reach their widely scattered homes.
For transport, they use horses and mules,
and all farming operations to raise the
principa) crops-coffee, corn, yuca, ani-
seed, bananas and sugar cane-are per-
formed t) yt) and.
After centuries of wear and tear, the
soil of Viani is nearing complete
exhaustion and as the wearing-out pro-
cess continues, the helpless farmers feel
more and more insecure as they find
no means of preventing their soil from
being eroded away.
The salvation of the people of Viani,
as is indeed the salvation of most of the
people of Colombia and other parts of
South America along the Andes moun-
tains, is soil conservation and. particu-
larly the effective control and preven-
tion of soil erosion.
It was because Viani was considered
as a typical rural area of Colombia that
the Colombian Government chose it as
the site for a fundamental education
project, which it called <&lt;Model Rural
Community».
A model community
THE M. inisters of Education. Eco-
nomy and Agriculture agreed on a
joint action to develop on an experi-
mental basis a model community, and
for this purpose they established a cen-
tre of Social Anthropology under the
sponsorship of the school located at
Viani. The new institution, whioh was
named the Civic Centre, was supplied
with adequate buildings and staff any
its director became the ex-officio direc-
tor of the Viani project.
'Finally, the Civic Centre asked that
Unesco establish an Associated. Project
in Viani and last March, on the request
of the Colombian Government, Unesco
sent to Viani Mr Patricio Sanchez, a
young and energetic soil conservationist.
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
After studying the community and its
people for several weeks, Mr Sanchez,
in co-operation with Mr Gabrie) 0spi-
na, head of the Viani Civic Centre,
began to take positive action.
'First of alp, he conducted a series of
group discussions with the farmers of
Viani, so as to bring home to them the
magnitude and seriousness of the soi)
erosion problem in their community
and to plan with fhem the practical
steps which they themselves could take
to stop it.
Then, : Mr Sanchez talked to the
school teachers of Viani so as to show
them how eaucation was closely plinked
with the problem and to urge them to
associate the question of soil conserva-
tion with the school curriculum in allgrades.
Finally, ; he organized the rurat youth
of Viani-those aged between f2 and
15 who had completed their-Mtfabe-
tismo !- and for whom there would nor-
ma) iy have'been nothing in store but to
revert back to their traditional exis-
tence. He explained to them that their
future would be of their own making
and that they could be a factor in
making their community a better place
in which to live, To do this, he told
them, they must take on the responsi-
bility of helping to prevent the further
wearing out of their land.
Beginning to realize
ArFTE>R four months, Mr Sanchezreports that the people of Viani are
beginning to realize that they can con-
serve their soil and that they alone can
prevent soil erosion through the imme-
diate, united and consistent application
of effort and intelligence,
HIs plans, however, do not end with
soil conservation for he feels that the
larger problem is human conservation
through education, of which soil con-
servation is only one of the major
means.
What Viani now needs, he considers,
are the services of a practical agricul-
turist who would help the farmers to
raise more and better crops per hec-
tare of and. There is also an urgent
need for a domestic economist to visit
the homes to show the women and girls
how to plan better meals for the fa-
mily. how to care fo !. children, the aged
and the sick and generally how to make
their homes more comfortab'e places in
which to live.
Finaitv, Viani needs a health specia-
list to show the people how disease can
be prevented and an educationist to help
in the reorientation of the educatIOnal
system and the modification of the
schools curriculum so as to make educa-
tion the key to improved living condi-
tions.
As far as possible it is hoped to
recruit these experts locally or from
Central and South American countries.
One of the aims of the project is to
develop local leadership for its further
impiementation. and later, its extension.

### 74094: Seminars in 1950: an announcement by the Director-General

### 74095: What is UNESCO doing for: adults, children, universities, child war victims

SEMINARS
An Announcement by
IN 1950 :
the Director-General
UNESCO is preparing for two International Edu-
< cational Seminars to be held in July and Au-
gust 1950, in which all Member States are
invited to participate. One Seminar will have as its
subject of study <&lt;The Teaching of Geography as a
Means of Developing International Understandings,
while the topic of the other Seminar will be <&lt;The
Improvement of Textbooks, particularly History
books. The following details can be given now :
$eminar on « The Teaching oi Geography &s a
Means of Developing International Understandings.
Probable location : Canada. Negotiations are in
progress with the Canadian Government.
Probable dates : 12 July to 23 August 1950.
Seminar on <&lt;The Improvement of Textbooks,
particularly History books.
Location : Belgium.
Probable dates : 19 July to 30 August 1950.
The working languages of the Seminars will be
French and English.
The financial arrangements have not yet been fi-
nally settled. Our estimates are based upon the
system in use hitherto, by which Unesco paid for
board and lodging of participants during their pe-
riod of attendance at the Seminars, whilst leaving
Member States to make appropriate provision for
the travel expenses of participants.
This system, however, met with considerable cri-
ticism. We are accordingly considering the adoption
of another plan, which would lead to a more equi-
table distribution amongst Member States of the
expense involved. Under the new plan, Unesco would
contribute to the travel expenses of participants
on a sliding scale and in proportion to the distance
travelled : board and lodging, on the other hand,
would be the responsibility of participants or their
governments. This plan will be laid before the
Fourth Session of the General Conference in Sep-
tember 1949, and the decision taken by the Confe-
rence will be communicated to Member States by
the end of October 1949.

WHAT UNESCO IS DOING FOR
ADULTS
A S a result of its relative
youth, the adult education
m 0 ve men t still lacks
cohesion and unity. Each experi-
ment has a character of its own
peculiar to the nation in which it
is proceeding, and public opinion
in each country is either almost
entirely ignorant or has litllle
understanding of what is going on
elsewhere. Thus Unesco's task in
this field is obvious and in strict
accordance with its duty of forging
links and facilitating exchanges.
It was in pursuance of that two-
fold task that Unesco convened
last June an international Con
ference on Adult Education, which
was held at Elsinore in Denmark.
For ten days delegates of twenty-
seven nations and of twenty-one
international non-governmental
organizations were ab 1 e to ex-
change information, to discuss
their problems and to draw up a
number of recommendations. The
latter form a kind of minimum
joint programme for adult educa-
tion, which includes a number of
activities international in nature,
such as the regular convening of
seminars, the formation of an
International Consultative Com-
mittee, the publication of a news
bulletin, abstracts, etc. The Con-
ference was of the opinion that
under p r e s e n t circumstances
Unesco was the body best fitted
adequately to execute the interna-
tional side of the programme.
In addition, Unesco will shorts
be publishing a world directs
adult education, which wiz
essential source of infor-
specialists.
UNIVERS, ITIES
TRio : four thousand universitiesand other schools of equiva-
lent standard existing in the
world to. day represent a very import.
tant spiritual force which has not yet
been fully utilized for the construc.
tion of a new and peaceful world,
Now that most of the universities
whi,'h suffered through the war have
recovered-manly 01 them through
the help of Unesco--it should be
possible for them to create a better
international unity among themselves
as a step to working for world
unity.
Among these ser : eral thousand
universities, however, there is a high
diversity in teaching plans and other
features of their activities, so that if
closer ties are to be created between
them, it is necessary to know more
completely and precisely the nature
of these differences. The need there-
fore arises for a clearing house as a
world centre of documentation and
Information.
This clearing house, the Intern-
tional Bureau of Universities, has
now been opened under the auspices
of Unesco and is developing its
activities at Unesco House.
Unesco also intends to call an
international conference with the aim
of creating an international associa-
tion of universities. Finally, Unesco
is carrying out research into how the
services of the universities can be
used most efficiently yin the interests
of international understanding.
"I too am learning, to write". One of manv
posters used in the tndian adu) t education
campaign in Bombay.
IN the programme concerned
with war-handicapped chil-
dren, Unesco has had to tackle
the double problem of the educa-
tion of children whom it is still
impossible to teach in normal con-
ditions, owing to the dislocation of
their social environment, and of
the special re-education necessary
to remedy the various forms of
handicap, due to the war, which
have caused irregularities in the
psychological development of chil-
dren.
Surveys have been carried out in
eleven European countries, with
the cooperation of governments
and charitable organizations, to
disover what are the needs, and
to study typical experiments which
may provide a solution for certain
specific educational problems. In-
ternational efforts to deal with the
question were analyzed, in consul-
tation with the technical experts
taking part in them, in order to
draw general conclusions from the
study of the many problems which
appear to differ individually.
The general report on « The
Educational Problems of War-han-
dicapped Children», with working
references attached, is at present
being published ;- this report des-
cribes the many forms these hu-
man problems take, and also deals
with work in progress and the fu-
ture efforts required to carry out
su : : cessfully a considerable task for
which the mobilization of the ac-
tive forces of society as a whole is
necessary.
The Podebrady Seminar
T THE part that war-handicappedchildren have to play in the
endeavour to secure international
understanding, and the educatio-
nal measures entailed, were des-
cribed in various talks given by
the responsible official at the
Unesco Seminar at Podebrady in
1948, and at the Second Interna-
tional Congress for the Education
of Maladjusted Children in Ams-
terdam and the Refresher Course
for Monitors organised by the I. F.
C. C. at Longueil-Annel, both in
1949. Unesco also provided finan-
cial assistance for the last two
undertakings, thus making useful
work possible.
The Children's International
Summer Camp which is at present
being held, under Unesoo's auspi-
ces, at Moulin-Vieux in France,
is also being conducted in co-ope-
ration with the I. F. C. C. A grant
was also given to the International
Council for Fre-school Education
because of the importance of edu-
cation in early childhood for the
formation of a normal personality
as an individual and as a member
of society.

horrors of enemy occupation.
With limited re3ourees, gov-
ernment and private agencies
are now struggling to restore

RECONSTRUCTION.... RECONSTRUCTION RECONSTRUCTION
"WHY harp on re-
construction ?"
Unesco represen-
tatives are often asked by
citizens of countries which
have escaped the horrors of
war."We've had nearly four
years of peace. How long
must all this reconstruction
work continue ?".
Unesco's answer is this : «it
takes far longer to build than
to destroy. The nations of Eur-
ope and Asia. experienced
continuous destruction during
six years of total war-the
destruction overnight, as it
were, of a century's accumul-
ation of all the potentialities
of future prosperity, freedom
and culture. We owe them at
least six years of peace, with
all the aid we can give. to
heal the grievous wounds they
suffered».
With the modest means at
its disposal, Unesco seeks
first to meet the high priority
needs of devastated countries.
This emergency aid is also
guided by the hope, which
recent events have fully just-
ified, that voluntary donors in
more fortunate countries will
follow the example thus set.
Over a period of three years,
Unesco has devoted $ 705. 000
to emergency purchases. In
1947 the Organization bought
equipment, mainly from war
surplus materials in Europe,
which enabled it to build up
some 50 scientific. workshops>&gt;

### 74097: Work camps for peace

WORK CAMPS
FOR
PEACE
THOUSANDS of young men
and women from ail over the
world and of all creeds and
political beliefs are working toge-
ther in Europe this summer in
special camps set up to aid the re-
construction of war-stricken coun-
tries.
Some of these young people will
reconstruct homes in a bombed-out
town, while others, hundreds of
miles away, will build a youth hos-
tel on a mountain road or lay a
section of railroad track.
In most cases, volunteers in in-
ternational work camps receive
free board and lodging, but they
usually must pay their own travel
expenses. Camp life is devoted to
the work itself-generally from
30 to 40 hours a week-and then
to cultural activities, trips to pla-
ces of interest in the camp vici-
nity, and to the establishment of
friendly relations with the local
community.
Friendships reaching across
frontiers are formed and, when
the volunteers return home to their
offices, farms, factories or univer-
sities, they become practical

Unesco Handbook
T 0 help this movement, Unescohas published a handbook en-
titled''\OTganizing International
Girls keep fit for work in a Roconstrud'en Camp,
Voluntary Work Camps". In
some 95 pages, it outlines the ge-
neral structure and administration
of the camps, with emphasis on
small organizations but devoting a
special chapter to large camps whe-
re hundreds or even thousands
may work together.
A special chapter on camp edu-
cational programmes include in-
formation on setting up study
groups, concerts, amateur theatre
projects, and a camp newspaper.
The origin of work camps goes
back to the first world war. At
Cambridge, England, in 1915, there
came into being a group of men
and women who felt obliged, for
their part, to meet the conflict in
a different way. They formed
themselves into what became
known as the Fellowship of Recon-
ciliation. At last, the war ended
and, little by little, shattered con-
tacts were restored. Finally in 1920,
the International Fellowship of
Reconciliation was formed at a
meeting in Bilthoven, Holland.
The Swiss representative at the
meeting, Pierre Ceresole, was the
son of a former president of the
Swiss Confederation and a con-
vinced pacifist. He volunteered at
once to work in an international
team doing reconstruction work in
war-devastated areas. Thus Cere-
sole <&lt; invented >&gt; the work camps,
creating at the same time the Vo-
luntary Service for Pe3lCe-known
in Frehch as the Service Civil.
This service, from 1920 to 1939, set
up work camps on four continents.
A Growing Movement
L ITTLE by little, other groupsand youth associations joined
in. Camps were organized in
France, in the United States, in
England and in the Scandinavian
countries. Each year the volun-
teers multip ! itì. il ! !. g, in Eu-
rope and in the Western Hemi-
sphere, 32 camps built playgrounds,
youth centres and hostels ; 48 built
schools, hospitals and houses ; 15
constructed railways, roads and
factories ; 14 helped on farms and
18 camps did social work.
Unesco quickly recognized the
importance of this movement in
fostering international cooperation.
In 1947, the organization coopera-
ted in the operation of four camps
and helped open a number of
others. In 1948, Unesco brought
together the organizers of work
camps from nine countries in Pa-
ris and a permanent committee
was formed. This year, each of
these camps will receive from
Unesco a multilingual library on
world affairs, the work of the Uni-
ted Nations, and the history, geo-
graphy and culture of various
countries. Unesco representatives
will visit some 32 camps. Unesco
also helps to facilitate the granting
of visas for volunteer workers
moving from one country to
another.
This is Unesco's role in a vigo-
rous movement which, over the
past 30 years, has attracted the
world's youth in increasing num-
bers.

During the three years of its
existence, Unesco has been
concerned with the administra-
tion of 262 fellowships alloca-
ted to 31 Member States. The
planning and administration
of these fellowship, s affect and
assist the component parts of
Unesco's Exchange of Persons
programme-the collection
and dissemination of informa-
tion on all types of internatio-
nal study opportunities3. and
the promotional and advisory
services to government and
accredited agencies on their
cultural exchange programmes.
Unesco fellowships aim at
pin-pointing and implementing
Unesco's on-going programme
in education, science and cul-
ture in its Member States
through the fellowships media.
Unesco fellowships are there-
fore offered to mature persons,
in established positions, who
can contribute to the recons-
truction and development of
the scientific, cultural and
educational life of their coun-
try on their return from their
period of study abroad. These
principles apply both to
Unesco-finance and to
Unesco-sponsored fellowships,
the latter being fellowships
financed by government and
accredited agencies, under the
auspices of Uneseo. Unesco's

was initiated as part of Unes-
co's assistance to war-devast-
ated Member States, is now
extended to aid under-deve-

FOUR MAJOR
SCHEMES
CINCE 1947, Unesco hasadministered four major
schemes :
a) 66 fellowships financed
by Unesco under the Unesco
Reconstruction Fellowships
jScheme, allocated to ten.
war-devastated Member States
(Austria, China. C : rechOßlova-
kia. Denmark, Greece, Hun.
gory. Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, the Philippines and
Poland), and concentrated on
six of the specific fields that
fall within the broad areas off
education, science and culture
with which Unesco is concer-
ned. nemely : Science and So-
cial Development, Cinema and
Radio Education, Educational
Problems of War-Affected
Children, Librananship, Edu-
cational Administration and
Art and Music Education, for
study in the United States and
Europe.
b) 64 fellowships financed
by the Canadian Council for
Reconstruction through Unesco
and offered to Austria, Bel-
gium, British Colonial Territo-
ries, China, Czechoslovakia,
Denmark, France. Greece, Ita-
ly. Luxembourg, the Nether-
lands, Norway, the Philippines,
Poland, and Ethiopia, under
the auspices of Unesco. These
fellowships give to specialists of
these countries an opportunity
to study in the fields of
Science and Technology, Edu-
cation, the Humanities. Mass
Medina, the Social Sciences,
Public Administration and the
Creative Arts. in which Canada
offers oustanding facilities.
c) 27 fellowships financed
by the Lord Mayor of London's
Fund allocated to Austria,
British Colonial Territories,
Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hun-
gary, Italy and Poland, which
will enable senior education-
ists from these countries to
study in England in the field
of Educational Reconstruction.

Consult <&lt;Study Abroad"-the
Unt : sco re. gister published in December
1948 as the first international handbook
providing details of available opportu-
nities for international study and organ-
ized arrangements made in this field.
As a first attempt at a comprehensive
mapping of a large and only partly
charted sea, Volume I, which report !
more than 15. 000 fellowships donated
by 37 countries, met with a striking
reception from the public and owing to
the big demand it was necessary to have
two reprints made.
Coming in November
STUDY ABROAD. Volume. II,is now in preparation and is sched-
uled for publication and distribution in
November) 949. This second volume
is planned with a view to a more com-
plete coverage of the fellowship field and
with a broader scope to include infor-
mation on all types of it. ternational edu-
cational exchange. Running into 360
pages, it reports the movement of more
than 100, 000 persons organized by over
a thousand agencies in many different
kinds of educational travel and exchange.
The Handbook is divided into four ma-
jor sections on fellowships, youth ex-
change, teachers exchange and workers
exchange.
Section I reports on international
fellowships, scholarships and related
opportunities. Reports have been recei-
ved from 42 countries. aU the United
Nations and Specialized Agencies, and
tnternational (private) organizations. The
national programmes, as reported, are
more complete and informative than
those in Volume l. For instance, India
has now reported its large annual go-
vernmentat overseas scholarship pro-
gramme. Latin America will be repre-
send by at least eight countries. Fellow-
ship programmes of Eastern European
countries will, it is hoped, be more fully
teported. and North American univer-
sities have sent data on a great many
more fellowships than previously.
Periodic publication of this informa-
tion makes for an increase in the number
and quality of candidates applying for
these opportunities to go and study
abroad. It suggests to prospective donors
areas in which new programmes might
usefully be developed and brings into
perfective possibte overtappings of em-
phasis, and areas of outstanding need.
In assembling aU this information in one
publication, Unesco is able to make more
widely known the considerable invest-
ment made by less developed countries
in international training facilities for
their nationals and similar facilities made
available to them by them more developed
countries. cStudy Abroad>&gt; will be an
important tool in the planning of the
United Nations technical assistance pro-
gramme for less developed countries, and
in extending Unesco's advisory services
to member states and agencies operating
in this fiend.
Movements
of Young People
SECTION II reports on internal. tional
U educational exchange movements of
young people. Going beyond the purely
<&lt;academic>&gt; field. Unesco organized an
enquiry into programmes of exchanges,
travel and visits of young people-that
is, persons under 25 years of age-be-
ween countries for educational and cul-
tural purposes. As a beginning, the
investigation was conducted through field
visits to nine European countries and by
correspondence with two other countries.
Volume II will include the results of
this first investigation with regard to the
various types of exchanges of young
people, such as school trips, private vt-
sits, organized tours and youth organiza-
tion exchanges ; it will be the first au-
thoritative listing of 50 organizations
with their addresses in the)) countries
surveyed. This section records that in
1948 65, 000 young persons travelled un-
der programmes organized by national
and international agencies in 11 coun-
tries.
Section ILl reports on interchange
schemes of schoolteachers and professors
between countries. Unesco's first enquiry
into programmes of teacher exchange
shows a striking amount of activity in
this field and assembles for the first time
a world picture of this type of inter-
change, including names and addresses
of 50 agencies sponsoring 3. 000 exchan-
ges. Unesco is planning to develop this
enquiry and investigate possibilities of
setting up machinery for the organization
of exchanges on a wider international
scale.
Exchange of Workers
S E. CTION IV reports on workers'I.... international exchange . I  this field
Unesco has maintained close co-opera-
tive relations with the International Labour
Organisation. The I. L. O. has underta-
len an enquiry into the international
movement of trainees and apprentices for
training and praattca) experience, the
results of which are recorded in this
section. Unesco has circulated to its
Member States a questionnaire on sche-
mes for the international movement of
agricultural and industrial workers far

poses. Reports on these schemes, where-
by workers in industrial. commercial
or agricultural employment travel to
another country for a certain period
of time to enlarge their general know-
ledge of the culture, history and/or lan-
guage of that country, to study welfare
and trade union organisation or for fra-
ternal trade union or international study
purposes in general, have been received.
Abcut 2COO training and educational
exchange opportunities organised by 100
agencies are recorded. Unesco, in colla-
boration with the I. L. O., is developing
plans to extend the area of international
educational exchange available to wor-
kers.

given for experience to be put to good
use on the recipients'return home ; fi-
nancing travel to and from the coun-
try of study. The experts will study
barriers to the movement of per-
sons, such as shortage of foreign ex-
change, high costs of transportation,
visa and other problems, legislation pre-
venting students from abroad accepting
part-time employment in their country
of study, and they will consider the
co-ordination and promotion of ex-
change opportunities.
A statistical commentary has been
prepared by t'she Secretariat on existing
opportunities for international study as
reported in Volume I of <&lt;Study
A : broaò>&gt;, While this survey makes no
claim to being. complete, nevertheless
the commentary represents an initial at-
tempt to analyze the returns compara-
tively, with a new technique and the
conclusions reached should stimulate
discussion on ways of co-ordinating
existin ; g programmes a nd promoting
further opportunities in areas of espe-
cial need.

mer. a document prepared for donors
of international fellowships, suggest,
ways in which study and travel grants
may be used as a means of promoting
priority projects in the Unesco pro-
gramme. Working papers have also
been prepared on the exchange of youth
workers and teachers, fields to which
L'nesco has this year extended its col-
lection of information and promotio-
nal work.
Discussions will cover the role of the
United Nations and its Specialized
Agencies, governments and private agen-
cies and individuals in promoting ex-
change. Finally, a paper prepared by
the Departments of Social Sciences and
Exchange of Persons will be presented
on the development of standards of eva-

### 74103: The Outlook for social science

### 74104: Social science: organizing research

### 74105: UNESCO plans world census of works on social science

THE OUTLOOK FOR
SOCIAL SCIENCE
By Dr. Arthur Ramos, Head of the Department
of Social Sciences
IT is perhaps rather early for me to have termed any definite
impressicns about the Department of Social Sciences, for
- *-I took up my post as Head of that Department only
two weeks ago.
I found the Department carrying out plans and programmes
for which a whole team of specialists and other qualified people.
devoting their best energies and ahilities to the work, is required.
My first task will naturally be to help in carrying on'hese
activities.
I have observed that Unesco's Department of Social Sciences
is fostering three of the principal social sciences : Sociology,
Political Science and Social Psychology.
Cultural Anthropology has not yet found its place in the
Department's programme. Admittedly, in the <&lt;Tensions>&gt;
project, a few problems relating to races and minorities are
being tackled, but no regular attention has yet been given to
the special problems of Man himself.
SOCIAL SCIENCE
THE BACKWARD PEOPLES
I N my opinion, the study of this problem should be amongthe most important of the activities of the Department of
Social Sciences. First of at), a general study should be made
cf the living conditions and the indigenous civilization of the
backward peoples in their native places throughout the world ;
it would then be possible to consider them in comparison with
the dominant cultures. In other words : a study of the life and
culture of non-European peoples considered in relation to the
decisive factors of European civilization.
In this connexion, a matter which I think Unesco should
raise in its Department of Social Sciences is the question of the
assimilation of the Indian and Negro peoples of the New
World and of their introduction to our culture.
Unesco's work in this direction should be tied in with the
activities already. being carried on by certain institutions such
as the/nstituto/ndigenista/nteramericano in Mexico, the Afro-
American Institute in Cuba and others.
Many questions involve more than mere listing of the data
of the problems. and I should be glad if we could employ our
hearts as well as our brains to find solutions for the many
difficulties which confront a large part of mankind, principally
the so-called primitive peoples or the backward, oppressed or
<&lt; ma1"ginal) > folk who have not yet received the benefits of
civilization.
1"1 IS one ul the paraduxe,
of the present-day scien-
tific world that the natu-
rai scien. tists-physicists, bio-
logists, astronomers and others
- are thoroughly well organi-
sed internationaHy white the so-
cial scientists-whose very study
is how people live together-
have formed hardly any inter-
nationa) associations. This is
the more strange since one of
the principal instruments of
work in the Social Sciences is
the comparative method : the
process of setting side by side
similar social phenomena deve-
loping under widely different
conditions. The international
field, rherichest of all areas
for the social scientist using the
comparative method, has hardly
been much more than surveyed.
) n recent months, however,
four of the principal Social
Science disciptines, meeting un-
der the aegis of Unesco. have
proceeded to set up internatio-
nal associations. The first of
these to come into active exis-
tence is the International Eco-
nomic Association. According to
the draft statutes previously
adopted, the International Eco-
nomic Association would come
into existence as soon as five
National, Associations had de-
dared their adherence.
Art the meeting of the inte-
rim Executive Committee of
the Association held I ;-16 July,
statement-, were made un behalf
of the American Economic As-
sociation. the Royal Economic
Society of Great Britain, the
French Joint Committee, the
Canadian Economic. A-sociations
and the Statskonomisk Foren-
ing cf Norway, announcing
their adherence to the Asso-
ciation and thereby becoming
founder members.) t was also
announced that Economic As-
sociations in Sweden. Denmark,
Finland, Belgium. the \ether-
lands, Australia, New Zeatand,
South Africa and India. were
prepared to bring the ques-
tion of adherence before their
National Associations as soon
as an invitation was issued.
National Associations of eco-
nomists in ta) y. Swit-
xer) and. Austria, Brazil and
Mexico were suggested as fu-
ture members. The. position of
Germany was made the sub-
ject of special discussion, the
Economic Association there
having been again constituted
after having deliberately dis-
solved itself at the beginning
of the Nazi Regime.
Round Table
Conference
I T was decided to call thefirst meeting of the Council
of the Association in September
1950 ant at the same time, to
FAMINE OF THE MIND

'< Lnescj, since its foundation, has been giving priority In
its work to educational and cultural reconstruction. Xo reai

can be made until reconstruction is completed-and It is fur
from being completed. The need for help the war-devastated
countries is greater than ever...'
. tatme Torres RftDRT. Uirecteur-General of Unesco
A draft Code 01 polices,
designed to furnish the
necessary link between
the general principles set
forth in Unesco's Constitution
and the detailed resolution in
the annual programmes, has
recently been adopted by the
Executive Board and is to be
submitted to the Fourth
Session of the General Confe-
rence for approval. Directives
VII to X in this Code specify
the Organization's aims, witch
particular reference to the
social sciences, scientific know-
ledge, intellectual exchanges,
and fellowships for travel and
research, in order to develop
between the peoples, <&lt; in
mutual respect for their
several cultures, the conscious-
ness of human solidarity .
Directive VIII runs as follows :
<&lt; Unesco will seek to improve
and make better known the
methcds and findings of the
Social Sciences ; and, in
particular, their possible con-
tribution to the development
cf international co-operation
and understanding. 
NEED FOR
PUBLICITY
WITH this in mind, the Se-úI"8tarjat has given at-
tenticn to one of the questions
most vitally affecting the pro-
gress of science and research- tre fact that many memo-
randa, theses for the dcctorate
and monograph are not
printed, so that numbers of li-
braries to-day possess no copies
df such works at all. Actually,
no scientific work can be
really useful unless its results
are publicized quickly and
adequately. Work and publi-
cation are very nearly indissoci-
able, as has'been said. While,
in most countries, industrial
production has now reached a
high level in comparison with
the pre-war figures (as high
as 150 %), the same cannot,
unfortunately, be said of
scientific output-that is, the
publications of works setting
out the results of research. In
humanistic studies, unpublish-
ed work might, for all that is
known df it, never have been
done. The situation of theses
for the doctorate, particularly
theses on literature and
. science, is important, for they
constitute a. considerable pro-
portion of learned work on
those subjects.
The result of such works,
not being printed is, firstly,
that students may deal with
subjects which have already
been studied by others in
universities or faculties else-
where and,. secondly, that rue-
search workers and specialists
are no longer able to obtain
the documents and works they
require from libraries. In
many case's, the originals
themselves have, been lost as
a result of the war, and the
typed copies have been scatte-
tered or have disapparead com
pletely. Some people object
that most of these studies are
of little scientific value, but
what argument can be put for-
ward when we bhink of those
remarkable works or those
writing of eminent professors
for which no philanthropic
publisher could be found ? To
take a concrete example, we
need hardly remind the reader
that such a work as Bergson's
<&lt;Essai sur les données immé-
riiates de la conic : ence was a
thesis for a doctorate. What
would happen to advance of
knowledge if such works had
remained unknown as type-
script memoranda ?
THE DANGEROUS
GAP
VIEWED from the inter-national level, this gap
seems even more disastrous
for the development of inter-
change between the peoples,
for it preserves impassable
barriers between specialists
belonging to different nations.
The exchange of printed books
provides one possibility of
international contact, and the
spread of culture is one mean. s,
with the free flow of ide. : s
and knowledge, of persuading
the peoples of their sacrej
duty to help one another. Be-
fere we considers means of re-
moving obstacles to the free
flew of information and ideas.
should we not began by
correcting the insufficiency of
infcrmation itself ? Article 19
of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, in laying
down the right of every
individual to freedom of op'nion
and expression, also includes
the right < : to seek, receive and
impart information and ideas
through any media and re-
gardless of frontiers>&gt;,
REMEDY FOR
SITUATION
WHAT then are theremedies ? The Director-
General of Unesco has decided
to take a preliminary census,
confined to works on social
: Sciences which have been
presented to a university or
academic jury since 1 January
1940. For this purpose, a
letter has been sent to all
Member States, asking them
to communicate to the Inter-
national Collaboration Division
of the Department of Social
Sciences, if pcssible before 31
December 1949, lists of such
works-drawn UD for each
university, institute of higher
Education or academy-inclu-
ding the author's name, the full
title and the number of page. s
cf the work, mention of the
degree obtained, and, if any,
the prize or honours given, and
lastly, the place where a copy
of the work can be obtained.
It is of direct interest to every
university that a list of such
works hould be published,
and, in some countries, the
Ministry of Education has ai-
r e a d y arranged fer the
centralization of such infor-
mation on a national scale. The
census should make it possible
to draw up, first of all, an
International index system,
with an analytical catalogue
arranged by subjects.
Several different possibilities
can later be considered- : f the
necessary fends are granted ;
fer instance, the best of these
studies might be reproduced
on microfilm for supply to all
specialized libraries, or printed
by the way of special grant3-
in-aid.
In this way, we shall be
able to pursue one of Ur. eco's
fundamental purposes-to
assist in maintaining and
diffusing knowledge by initia-
ting methods of international
co-operation calculated to give
the nEODle of all countries
access to the printed and
published materials produced
by any of them, and by
promcting the international
interchange of Scientific
information.

huid. i round'able conference
on : <&lt;Long-term econom ic pro-
blems of international balances
It its hoped that such round
table discussiuns. which are to
be among the principal activi-
ties of the Association, will pro-
vide authorative statements as
to the present situation of eco-
nomic thinking on some of the
Jutstaniing questions of inter-
national importance.
As such. the reports of these
discussions may prove of value
not only to research workers
but also to those engaged in the
teaching of advanced economics
throughout the world, and to
practical administrators con-
cerned with economic polity.
Another notable activity of the
Association, it is anticipated.
will be to assist national eco-
nomic bodies to come into
being in the many countries
where at present no such orga-
nisation exists.
The sociologists and political
scientists are following hard
upon the heels of the econo-
mists in organising internatio-
nally. In September 1949 an
international meeting of socio-
logists at Oslo will be taking
the final steps to constitute an
International Sociological Asso-
ciation, while a meetingofpo-
litical scientists in Paris during
the same month is expected to
set up an International Politi-
cal Science Association. An In-
ternational Comparative Law
Association is also in process of
formation under-Unesco's aus-
pices.
Help from Unesco
A S part of this function ofpromoting international ac-
tivity in the Social Sciences.
Unesco is also giving assistance
to social sciences associations
already in existence. The In-
ternational Studies Conference
is holding a plenary session in
Paris, ig August-3 September,
part of which will be devoted
to Unesco's work. The Confe-
rence of the) ntcrnationa !
Union for the Scientific Study
of Population Problems, which
is being held is Geneva, 27 Au-
gust-5 September, is examining
on behalf of Unesco the pro-
blems involved in the cultural
assimilation of immigrants.
The International Association
for Applied Psychology, which
is holding its ninth congress
in Berne, 12-17 September,
is likewise giving special at-
tention to the field covered by
the Tensions affecting Interna-
tional Understanding Project.
In this work of facilitating
and encouraging international
Organisation on the part of the
Social Sciences. Unesco's
pursuing one of its principal li-
nes of policy : to give every pos-
sible assistance and incentive to
social scientists everywhere to
direct their efforts upen the key
problem of the age-how the
peoples of the world earn learn
to live together in mutual help-
fulness and peace.

### 74106: Half the world's population is illiterate

"HALF THE
WORLDS
POPULATION
IS ILLITERATE
A Message from Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco, to the Seminar on
Illiteracy in the American Continent, meeting
at Quitandinha, Brazil, from 27 July to 3 Sep-
tember 1949./.. .-
YOU are meeting to consider
one of the most disquieting
problems of our century. I
mean the illiteracy of
millions of beings whom
we call in all seriousness
cur brothers-as indeed
they are by nature and potential
ability-and on whose shoulders we
lay a burden of civic duties nu
different from those that we ourselves
accept. Yet despite the right of all
men to culture, these, our brothers,
remain under the ycke of ignorance.
They are excluded by poverty from
that equality which is theirs by law.
They are victims of a situation which
we have done nothing to bring about,
but fer which, knowing and admitting
it as we do, we must assume the
responsibility if we take no pract : cal
and effective steps first to lessen, then
to remedy, and finally to abolish th's
evil through our combined efforts and
our unanimous will.
On 10 december 1948, at the General
Assembly of the United Nations, the
representatives of all the American
countries a3opted a Declaration, 0 :
which article 26 reads as follows :
<&lt; Everyone has the right to educa-
tion. Education shall be free, at least
in the elementary and fundamental
stages. Elementary education shall be
compulsory, Technical and professional
education shall be made generally
availlable and higher education shall
be equally accessible to all cn the basis
of merit >&gt;,
Brave words. But how much ar are
they worth, if, in the Latin American
community alone, millions cannot read
them ? If the rest of the world is
added, the problem becomes even more
desperate : half the world's population
is illitrate. In this age of aeroplanes,
radio and nuclear physics, half the
human race has still not learnt to
read and write When we speak of
Human Rights, we shall do well to
bear in mind that, as things stand.
cne human being in every two is
unable to claim respect for those
Rights in writing.
Nor is this the whole picture : tha
incidence of illiteracy is far from uni-
form ; in some regions there are no
illiterates but : n ethers only a tiny
minority of the population enjoys the
privilege cf bsing able to read. There
are great areas where men and wo-
m6n men can do no more than scrawl, at
the foot of the orders they receive or or
of the commitments they enter into,
the symbol of a great martyrdom : a
croM.
The Defences of Peace
U NESCO, which was created to
build the defences of peace in
the mind of men, must ponder
the nature of the peace
wich it is ta prepare and stnngthen
Is it the peace of slaves, who know
not but to yield ? Or is it the peace
of men, of men made free by aware-
ness of their destiny, and by intelligent
and active sharing in a common
liberty, to redeem mankind ?
Without universal education the
ideal of freedom is no more than an
unpund debt, a dangled deceit. The
problem oj illiteracy is of course one
oj of education. But it is more than this : :
it is a universal tragedy which affects
us all directly ani which is at once
economic, pclitical and social in
character.
Some may think it of little im-
portance. There is, they may say,
little relation between the cultural
level of a country and the number of
its people able to read and write at
any given moment. There were more
illiterates in the France of Loujs XIV
than in the. France cf NapolEon III,
yet the age of Racine, Pascal and
Moliere was not on that account
inferior to that of Tiers, Renan and
Victor Hugo. There was perhaps more
reading in the Spain of Isabella II
than in 16th century Spain Yet the
latter period cannet boas : a poet such
as Lope dE Vega, a playwright such
as Tirso de Molina, or storyteller such
as Cervantes. There were more illite-
rates in Shakespeare's t h a n in
Dicken's England ; yet neither did
diplomas add lus : re to Pickwick's ad-
ventures, nor did the lack of schools
J I would not warn you against
sophistries so glaring, were it not daily
apparent that minds which seem the
keenest, and hearts which seem the
soundest, are being infected by the
false notion that progress is a material
investment, a kind of merchandise, and
that with a little capital and a had-
ful oj skilled technicians we can save
whole centuries of time in our fight for
civilization. There can be few atti-
tudes mere dangerous than that of
cne whose vanity and superficiality
lEads him to think that the mere pur-
chase of a gramophone and a plenti-
ful collection of records makes him
the equal of a Beethoven or a Bach.
No one, however wealthy, is rich
enough to purchase dther the title
deeds of genuine progress or its
effective enjoyment. Peoples, like
individuals, must choose on of two
courses : either : hey may copy the
blue-print of an artificial type of econo-
mic development, which must prove
transitory and vain ; or they must pro-
gress by their own efforts, tackling
each problem from its banning,
which calls above all ior humility and
deny laurels to the author of The
Tempest.
Such arguments put the question in
a false light, and these who use them
are equivocating. Equally misleading
is the assertion that in some communi-
ties the illiterates are to be preferred
a human beings to those who have
been through the schools ; that the
value of giving an illiterate the power
to read what may not have been worth
writing is dubicus ; or, as stated by a
great South American, that men of
America need the alphabet less than
they need the plough and the hammer.
All these excuses-or, if you will,
these apologies for illiteracy-imply
some criticism of the kind of life that
awaits *he ignorant when, though still
unlettered in the strict sense, they are
no longer illiterate. Such criticisms
may seem plausible. But do they
really detract from the importance and
urgency of the question ? Do they not
denote a paradoxical superficiality ?
Far from facing the problem squarely.
do they not deliberately elude it ?
The mere fac : that illiterates exist,
who are harder-working and pleasan-
ter to deal with than university
graduates, does not mean that
universities are necessarily havens of
laziness or bitterness ; the fact that
xlcughs and hammers are necessary
does net mean that books or news-
papErs are not ; the fact that there
were many illiterates in the years
when gifted writers composed Don
Quixote or the alexandrines of <&lt; Phe-
dre gave no reason, still less
encouragement, to Cervantes to invent
the adventures cf the Knignt. of the
Lions, or to Racine to describe the
fateful loves of the stepmother of
Hippolytus.
perseverance-and, in a word, for
education at all possible levels.
Scheme for Technical
Assistance
Y YOU have probably already
heard some comment en the
Scheme for Technical Assis-
tance evolved jointly by the
United Nations and the Specialized
Agencies. Unesco shared in the pre-
paration of this plan, and its Gene-
ral Conference will next September
decide what programme and budget
should be adopted to afford technical
aid to under-developed countaes from
1950 onward.
We shall bring to this vast under-
taking our keenest enthusiasm and
our best endeavours. If we obtain
the approval of the General Confe-
rence, we shall, in agreement with
the countries concerned, investigate
their most pressing needs with the
cbject of sending them missions, teach-
ears and advisers whose essential task
will be to create, without detriment
to the cultural individuality of the
country, more favourable conditions
for the development of technical edu-
cation and scientific investigation.
I an convinced of the benefits
which this plan offers to many of the
world's peoples ; but it is also my
belief that none of those advantages
will be lasting unless a high priority
is given to education. Hence the vital
importance which I, as Direc : or-
General of Unesco, attach to the work
you are now undertaking.
The teaching of reading and writing
is not an end in itself ; it is, however,
a means to an end and an essential
cart of any well-ccnceived and well-
balanced plan of social advancement.
Any plan for technical assistance
must rest-often directly-upon a
vigorous educational campaign,'and
where illiterates are. numerous, any
educational campaign, must presuppose
an energetic struggle against illitera-
cy.
What Illiteracy Means
SOME years before I entered the
Organization to which I now
belong, I took part, in my own
country, in a national literacy
campaign. During the examination
period, I viited a rural community
which the inspectors had described to
me as one of the keenest and most
determined of the campaign. In a
strawthatched hut, hut, a girl volunteer
was teaching reading and writing to
a group of peasant women. For black-
board she had a yard or two of
shabby dark o'lcloth. After the
learners had read me a few pas-
sages I asked one of them, the
oldest, to write out two or three
sentences which I oicked from the
primer the teacher was using. With-
out hesitation she wrote out the
words I dictated.
But I was disturbed, less by her
spelling mistakes than by a certain
machine-like swiftness which suggest-
ed the motions of an automaton.
I asked her to write her own name,
and aw at once that this was an
untried task : for hand and mind alike.
She took the chalk hesitantly, and
very slowly, letter by letter, began to
trace her name. When she had finish-
ed she read it out several times under
her breath. Then suddenly, to every-
body's surprise, she burst into tears.
There was certainly no bitterness in
that weeping ; its real cause was sure-
ly the surprise of finding her real
self, suddenly, after so many years of
ignorance, during which that, self had
been absent in exile.
In those few shaky, ill-formed
strokes, She saw herself more clearly
than in a mirror-humble and obe-
dient. bowed down by her poor past.
And were not those triumphant tears
a lesson to us all, and an immense
forgiveness ?
Time presses, We cannot leave
millions of men and women injustly
isolated and cut off-from our life be-
cause the soil of their mind is untilled.
In coming to this Seminar, you, the
teachers of America, have undertaken
a responsibility to which I pay tribute
with respect and gratitude,
May your work be crowned with
success. But how can we doubt of
success, when the "ask is so noble and so oble and
you meet in this magnificent land of

said in a famous passage :
bountifulness of life itself causes free-
dom to flourish ».

UNESCO'S
Of all Unesco's activities thost
t tconm'tti with Arts and
'l tters. are. if not the most
difficult, at least the most delicate.
Th'ey are based on a fwndamental
tenet of modern thought-that
appreciation of art is essential to the
mental and moral health of everyone.
Any weakening of artistic feeling in
mankind in general indicates a decline
in the moral sense and prepares the
way for outbreaks of violence. Only
men endowed with some imagination
and, I might almost say. some creat-
ive imagination-which, fortunately,
is within the reach of all-can
understand others : if the artistic
sense were to disap, pear from mankind
or were to become the monopoly of a
jealous and exclusive caste, the world
would be a desert of dreary crime and
bloodthirsty folly.
The preservation of the artistic
sense where it now flourishes, and its
dissemination and fostering where
poverty, ignorance or the mechaniza-
tion of life have choked it, are cl0gely
bound up with Unesco's purposes. It
is principally through their art that
he peoples draw close to one another
and reach intuitive understanding ; and
to induce them to know and love their
fellows through art, in a world in
which artistic appreciation has become
general, is to induce them to iknow
and love what is deepest and most
characteristic in their feHows. The
difficulties are great. While, on the
one hand, Unesco's efforts must be
directed towards the mass of ordinary
people, in order to prepare them to
receive the message of creative minds,
and thus come under the heading of
dissemination. in other restpects. the
Organization's activities border on
creation itself. We know that no rule. ;
can be laid down for creative activity
and that, in every age, artists have
asked only to be left to woI'kj in
, r ; 1eace. But there would ! be serious
gawps in Unesco's work if the Organi-
zation could not secure their wilting
co-operation.
Unesco's Tasks
Unesco is already doing much to
popularize art. We cannot give even
a scanty idea of that wonk in a few
lines ; let it suffice to say that one
of Unesco's most important tasks in
the field of literature is to encourage
and promote the translation and publi-
cation of the classics of every coun-
try's literature, particularly in lan-

g-uages in which they have never
Ihitherto appeared. For instance. many
mamerpieces from other cultures will
be introduced into the Arab world. in
this way, it will be possible to incor-
. porate in the life of evlory people
vital elements which have so far been
lacking. The same purpose is served
by travelling exhibitions of eolour
reproductiones of masterpieces of paint-
ing' ; thanks to such reproductions,
which have reached a very high degree
of technical excellence, these master-
pieces will be known in countries they
could never have reached by other
means. : Furthermore Unesco has
undertaken to make a catalogue
of all recordings of classical and po-
pular music, and to foster their cir-
culation throughout the world, thus
opening up new paths for nusical
interchange, which is tun-day 0 diffi-

the arts in education. Appreciation of

By keeping their artistic sense alert.
we can preserve their mental balance
and give them a potent instrument to

Two Fronts
Unesco's work is always carried on.
however, on two fronts. Every one of
its activities must contribute, directly
or indirectly, to the welfare of
mankind as a whole ; but each of
those activities is also designed to
enlist the intellectual leader of the
world in this COITlJT1on task. (Tn"s,, ()
"Museums are becoming an increasingly important factor in the education of adults
and children alike".
WEare all artists in varied\\/degrees. For life itself is anart which we practise well
or indifferently, in ways that are
routine or inspired. But every-
where and always, in primitive and
civilized communities, in prehisto-
rIc as in modern times, some
people have been recognised as
more artistically endowed than
others, as having such skills and
awaraness as to mark them out as
specialists.
They are the avowed artists.
Consequently, and unfortunately,
there has been a complementary
tendency to assume that those
with less obvious-artistic abilities
were not capable of any kind of
creative expression ; they had « no
eye for painting, no ear for mu-
sics. Increasingly, this opinion is
being discredited.
In the process of initiation to
life which, is commonly known as
education, the arts in various ti-
mes and places have received
greater or lesser emphasis accord-
ing to the points of view of those
charged with educational direction.
Until quite recently, in most of the
europeanized systems of education,
the main emphasis was placed on
intellectual and physical training,
with the arts relegated to a less
important position as decorative
frills en the borders of the serious
business of rational and practical
learning, the basic grounding in
the three R's and the hard grind-
ing of facts.
Education through Art
"NOWADAYS, as a consequenceof many pioneer experiments
and researches in the past fifty
years and of increased psycholo-
gical knowledge, many educators
in many places doubt the real
effectiveness of rigidly exclusive
systems of intellectual education ;
some educators in some places are
30
putting more emphasis on methods
of education which include the
arts, whilst a few educators in a
Ïew places advocate and practice
entire education through art. For
them art is not just a part of
education ;'t is the means of edu-
cation.
Bfhind such changes in educa-
tional practice, there is usually a
feeling that one of the chief cau-
ses of individual unhappiness and
general unrest in the contempo-
rary world is to be found in those
processes of civilization and sys-
tems of education which tend to
classify and divide, to oppose in-
tellect and intuition, to separate
work from play, to offset earning
a living against enjoyment of lei-
sure. At this critical phase of hu-
man evolution, when in science,
economic, religion, and politics
the trend appears to be towards
split and fission, dualism and op-
position, ordinary men and women
. sense the deepest need of spiritual
and moral values to balance in-
tellect. They need to live by feel-
ing as much as by thought : they
require ritual and pageantry as
much as food and knowledge. We
must then recognize the value of
the arts to unite and harmonize,
not merely recuperating sick
minds and bodies, although the
therapeutic power of art is indis-
putable, but exprescsing whole and
zestful health.
It is in this light that the pro-
ject for Art in General Education
takes its place within the wider
Unesco task of seeking to unite
the peoples of the world by means
of greater knowledge and under-
standing. Art is often described as
the universal language, but this
is an obvious half-truth which we
a : cept with reservation knowing
well that the arts of one people
need interpretation to another and
that each different kind of art
requires some measure of techni-
cal knowledge for its full appre-
ciation.
A Process of Creation
\or HAT is in fact universal is theprocess of creating art. It is
for this reason that the Unesco
project is more concerned with
Educational means than with ar-
tistic ends, seeking to explore by
research and enquiry what is being
done in various parts of the world
by all kinds of people in the fields
of visual arts and crafts, music,
dance. drama and creative writing
in the domains of primary, secon-
dary and adult education. Through
the medium of a clearing house
and in the pages of a quarterly
bulletin entitled « Art and Educa-
tion>&gt; this project serves to ex-
change news and views of what
is being done from one place to
another, from individual to indi-
vidual, from group to group, wi-
thout seeking to impose or endorse
any sectional style or theory.
As the project develops it is in-
tended to arrange for the mutual
circulation of informative exhi-
bitions, to encourage and, as far
as possible, sponsor the exchange
of specialists, teachers and stu-
dents. In particular, since the ap-
proach to the arts as a means of
education is still very much in the
experimental stages in most coun-
tries, it will be dEsirable to keep
in close touch with new develop-
ments and to foster special stu-
dies and research. The possibility
of establishing an International
Committee to further such deve-
lopments is now under consider-
ation.
So it is that through the arts
the defences of peace may be con-
structed not only in the minds of
men but from their hearts and
through their hands.
must not forget that onf of its dutie :-
is to bring to artists, as to all creative
minds, a new, hope and new influence,
a new persuasive force. Artists have
too often fomented division and hat-
red between men : and it would be
sad if the development of the artistic
sense among the common People
resulted only in opening their minds
to new notions of violence-which
is always a possibility. The. present-
day artist is conscious that. if his
work cannot flourish as a part of
international life but remains confined
within the borders of a single nation,
it has in it something ineffectual, al-
most unreal. Artists of nations which
are less favourably situated, whose
art, has difficulty in overstepping
frontiers, are thus almost inevitably
driven to confuse the radiating power
of art with political might, and to
encourage among their people either
the suspicious isolation of those who
turn their baoks on the world, or the
aggressive tendencies of those who
would subjugate it. It is not for
Unesco to offend artists by vain
preadhing, to whioh they would, in
any case, remain deaf, but to bring
them to live and act naturally as
world citizens, so that the internatio-
nal outlook may become second na-
ture to them. The enquiry which
Unesco is carrying out among artists
throughout the world on the obstacles
of every sort-political, economic,
or moral-which deprive their art
of complete freedom (an enquiry
\\1hich array lead to practical results
by the irresistible force of evidence
alone) is, in our opinion, an instance
of the unobtrusive work which
Unesco can legitimately do to foster
artistic creation. The ultimate aim of
Unesco is to ensure that the defini-
tions. of artists as free citizens of a
world which desires to be free, may
be understood in the fullest sense and
hecame an accepted truth.

he can use them creatively and

bears on museums which, through

explain and illustrate the record of
all human activity, thus inc.-reasing
man's knowled. Qe of himself and of

### 74110: A Tribute to Frédéric Chopin

A TRIBUTE
TO
FRÉDÊRIC"
CHOPIN
FREDERIC CHOPIN, the Polish composer whose workrepresents the acme of pianoforte composition, did : J
in Paris on 17 October 1849, in an apartment in the
Place Vendome. The first centenary of his death is being
commemorated this year throughout the world, but on a
particularly large scale in Potand. and in France, the country
where he lived and became famous.
Unesco could not let this centenary pass without paying
its own tribute, and since the beginning of the year projects
have been under preparation :
(i) the foundation of two scholarships in Paris for young
Polish composers.
(2) the publication of a complete catalogue of the
recordings of the works of Chopin,
(3) the organization of a concert consisting of compositions
specially written for the occasion by a number of prominent
living composers.
SCHOLARSHIP,
THIS project entaicls the financial co-operation of the
International Music Fund, of which Serge Koussevitsky,
the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is
the Chairman. Thanks to ! t. two young composers from
Chopin's own country will come to Paris, as the master
himself came in 1831. to benefit from the wonderful environ-
ment the city still provides for artists from all four comers
of the earth.
So far as Chopin is concerned, there are few other
composers so many of whose works have been so
frequently recorded and played, for that purpose, by
so many different artists. Unesco has embarked on drawing
up as complete a catalogue as possible of theses recordings.
By the time this issue of the"Courier>&gt; goes to press, this
catalogue will have already appeared in the shape of a
240-page volume edited by M. Armand Panigel, with an
introduction and commentary by M. Marcel Beaufils.
A CONCERT
ON 3 October, two days before the closing of the
Fourth Genera/Conference of Unesco, there will be
a concert at the Salle Gaveau, consisting of the first
performance of"Homage to Chopin", a series of ten pieces
of chamber, vocal and instrumental music. These works have
been specially written for the occasion at Unesco's request,
in memory of Chopin, by the following composers :
Lennox Berkeley Bohuslav Martinu
Carlos Chavez Andrzej Panufnik
Oscar Esp) a Ftorent Schmitt
Jacques Ibert Alexandre Tansman
G.-F. Malipiero Heitor Villa-Lobos.
These masters of contemporary music, have expressed, in
music, their admiration for the great Polish composer. The
concert of 3 October is beIng arranged in association with
Radiodiffusion Francaise, any will be broadcast both in
France and abroad, the following artists taking part : the
pianists Hélène Pigna.-et and Arnaldo Estrella, the singer
lrène Joachim, the cellist Maurice Maréchal, the Ca ! vet

who work in public libra-

MILLIONS WITHOUT

TTNFORTUNATELY, in eventhe most highly developed
countries from a library point
of view only some-far from all
- of the public libraries play
such an active part. In fact,
millions of people are without
public library service of any
kind. One of Unesco's tasks
therefore is to promote the de-
velopment of library service in
towns and ru : al districts now
without it and to encouraga
existing libraries to do a more
complete job in the field of
popular education.

this area is being carried out

Apart from the examination
itself, the Secretariat of Unesco
is assembling the fullest possible

that the artist meets with to-day

to assemble facts of importance,
official documents and written
information from artists themsel-

brought to the knowledge of the
T>ublic through a bulletin pu-

While, however, the exami-
nation is designed to clarify the
difficult problem of the free-

world, Unesco does not intend
to confine itself to mere these-

examination, if it is to be of
any US1 :, must lead to concrete
results. It must enable Unesco
to present, to the Florence Ge-

ther in the desolate wastes
of the Arctic or the hot and steamy
jungles of Africa, the virgin forest
of the Amazon, the steppes of Sibe-
ria or the savannas of Patagonia, the
same phenomena move in the atmos-
phere, giving it life, stirring it, warm-
ing or chilling it, and giving it
colour.
Man, through his senses, interprets
what he sees and feels in that light,
then transforms it and fixes it in
art-art which is more or less endur-
ing according to the human warmth
and the force of social significance
with which he imbues that interpre-
tation of nature and its phenomena.
All the great civilizations of ancient
times have understood this, from the
primitive cultures of Mesopotamia
and Egypt, India and China onwards.
So, too, have the great corresponding
civilizations of America, Mayan,
Aztec and) nca. Thus, in all of them,
we find an astonishing similarity of
themes and symbolism in the major
and minor arts of their peoples.
A large expedition, organized and
sponsored by the Mexican National
Institute of Anthropology and the
xationotthe Hirst Mayan Empire.
The city of Palenque, rich in legen-
dary ruins, was the abode of the
chief Mayan nobles and priests, where
they built their most sumptuous pal-
aces and temples.
PALENQUE
DISCOVERIES
THE expedition explored the
Temple of Laws and brought
to slight ancient reli fs and
paintings. The Mexican
archaeologists discovered that these
paintings in the temple were
superimposed on others, and
they finally found 20 distinct layers
bearing witness to different eras in the
flowering of Mayan culture. The
tombs of the Mayan nobles buried
in Palenque have yielded to Mexican
historians a number of pottery spe-
cimens and symbolic statuettes. And
it is in those objects-the expres-
sion of what might be called a mi-
nor art-that we may see the first
signs of what has been the distin-
guishing characteristic of Mexican
civilization up to the present day :
the awe and gratitude of the people
of Mexico for the splendid panorama,
bathed in so rare a light, that lies
around them. AFRICAN DANCE,

THE MASK
Society for Andean Exploration has
just returned to Mexico City. After
three months'intensive work in-the
ancient city of Palenque, situated. in
the forest region near the Guatema-
lan frontier, the expedition made a
number of discoveries which have
enriched our knowledge of the civili-
PAPER AND STONE
It was that light of the Valley
of Mexico, at once harsh and
pellucid, which, in an Aztec era
before the time of Cortes, shone
on the pretty fretted paper hanging
on the stone statues in the temples.
The Conquistadores where. in fact ama-
zed to see the stone gods pdorned
wi. th ornaments and streamers of pa-
per. Paper and stone. Two such dif-
ferent things-the one frail, requir-
ing refined and delicate sensibility ;
the other solid, suitable for great en-
during masses. Yet the union of these
two substances perfectly symbolizes
Mexican art : the dualism of the
grandiose and the ephemeral.
Mexican native paper is an impor-
tant cultural factor in the country's
history. Witchcraft and idolatry, to-
temism and ancestor-worship still
endure almost unchanged and linked,
in many forms of art, with paper.
Before the time of Cortes, the Aztecs
used to adorn those taking part in
their solemn processions with gar-
lands of painted paper. It was also
their custom to deck with paper robes
the bodies of the illustrious dead,
whether they were warriors slain in
battle or powerful merchants.
ART AND FEATHERS
THE same luminous air which
stirred the ornamental pa-
pers, blew from hill to hill
and from valley to valley ; it passed
into the Indians'lungs, to issue forth
in music played on primitive flutes ;
and in that clear air beautiful multi-
coloured birds would fly, covered
with delicate plumage. The plumage
was used by the ancient Mexicans to
produce another great and character-
istic form of art-that of the
feather-worker, shaping the long gai-
liy-coloured plumes into ornaments,
devices and crests. The wind itself
was at last caught, fashioned and
set for all time in the native pottery.
The symbol of the wind is remark-
able for its constant hold on the
popular mind in Mexico. More than
four centuries removed in time from
the earlier world, the themes of fire
and wind, traditionally associated,
are still used in Mexican pottery and
ceramics.
WIND SYMBOLS
PREDOMINATED
N the Mayan and Aztec Emp-
I ires, those phenomena were thec ntre of complex philosophic
systems and of religious ideas.
Pots for cooking on the fire are
always ornamented with wind symools
(spirals, crossed-spirals, swirled à. r-
rows). Such representations of the
wind theme are always flat, never in
relief. Repeated close to one another
on a common earthen cooking pot.
they combine to give the whole a
peculiarly dynamic effect, savouring
strongly of the primitive.
Thus we come to present-day Mex-
ico, leaving behind the vigorous and
impressive art of the Maya and the
Aztecs. The art of great stone sculp-
ture has given place to the art of
metal jewels, earthenware toys, cut-
out paper, painted pottery and deli-
cate featherwork-in all, the de-
lightful popular art of Mexico.
The Indian chroni. tell that
when the Spanish shy the Con-
quistadores loomed over the horizon
of Anahuac-as the whole region
from the coast to the city of Mexico
was called-a doleful voice was
heard lamenting in the darkness of
the night and crying : « We must go,
my children. Our gods are dead and
we must die with them. >&gt;
In reality, what died was only one
part of a great civilization. Wind,
light-that incomparable light of
the Valley of Mexico-fire-that
element in which stone and water,
colours and music blend in such per-
fect harmony-all these have endu-
red.
And the Mexican people have also
endured and developed ; a people
able to reproduce faithfully all the
familiar elements of nature, a people
that not only take nature's gifts, but
also gradually change and mould
nature to their own measure.
